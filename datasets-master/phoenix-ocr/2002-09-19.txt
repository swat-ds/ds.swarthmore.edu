Council promises
Philly van soon,
despite problems
BY PREETY SIDHU
ssiddhul@swarthmore.edu

Despite last year's pledge to provide students with

free round-trip transportation to Philadelphia on weekends, the van program remained one vehicle short of
implementation at the end of the student council meeting Monday, the council's first meeting of the year.
Due to several accidents last semester in which students damaged college vans, the council does not have a
van available to make the Philly runs. Council members are looking into renting one to get the program
underway as soon as possible. The amount of money
allocated to the program, however, was intended to
cover only the salaries of professional drivers. To pay
for a rental van, it might be necessary to eliminate one
or two of the 10 weeks of service originally planned.
If the Philly van starts running it will be free and
open to all students. It will operate between 6 p.m. and
2 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights, leaving Parrish circle every hour. Where the vans will stop in
Philadelphia has yet to be determined. South Street and
the Electric Factory will likely be among the stops, as
well as a location in the vicinity of the University of
Pennsylvania campus. The van service will function

WSRN decides to resume
webcasting despite risks
Regulations, rulings threaten college radio as it goes online again
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE

aarondil@swarthmore.edu

A new addition to the WSRN Web site invites visitors to
"listen... online." No longer confined to the FM dial, WSRN
is now "webcasting," making its programming available
over the Internet. But not without difficulties.
WSRN's innovation is actually a reinstitution of an old
program. The station began webcasting several years ago,
then yanked the Web broadcast because of legal concerns.
Sydney Beveridge, WSRN programming director, said the
return to the Internet "seemed like sort of a natural move,"
and that the WSRN board is excited to be offering listeners
the new option.
The legal morass that surrounds webcasting, however,
has only deepened over the past three years. Congress, the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the

Library of Congress Copyright Office (LCCO) have piled
new regulations on top of those that led to the discontinu-

ation of WSRN's first webcast.
Former WSRN technical director Branen Salmon
recalled that, when the webcast was originally set up,
WSRN's board members "were very gung-ho about [the]
system, but then...[they] became aware of all these legal
issues." Congress had just passed the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act of 1998, which made operating a webcast
equivalent to tacit consent to pay
whatretroactively
ever fees the LCCO eventually decided were appropriate.
According to Salmon, there was a "very real possibility" that the record industry would succeed in "lobbying
for fee levels completely out of the reach of college radio."
Tension arose on the WSRN board between those who
favored continuing the webcast despite the risks and those
who wanted to wait out the political controversy. At the

THE PHOENIX

time, the voices of caution won.
Their victory proved to a boon for the station. On June
20, 2002, the LCCO finally set fees for webcasting. The fees
themselves are lower than anticipated and work out to a
should it decide to
$5OO annual cost for WSRN
webcast
far from the $lO,OOO annual payment some speculated might be imposed. But the LCCO made the fees
retroactive to 1998, a decision which could have created
financial difficulties for WSRN had it been webcasting
throughout the last few years.
The copyright office's decision has made it possible for
WSRN to resume its webcast, but regulations still make
the process both expensive and dangerous.
Because of the Digital Performance Right in Sound
Recording Act of 1995, radio stations with webcasts have to
pay royalties not only to the associations which represent
those who hold copyrights for songs but also to an associa-

tion called Sound Exchange, which represents the holders
of the copyrights of specific recordings.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
argues that this is a logical extension of intellectual property law. In the recording industry's view, it is the lack of
an equivalent requirement for standard radio broadcasting which is an anomaly, or what they call "a historical
accident." But many college radio stations say the new fees
make it impossible for them to broadcast on the web,
according to the RIAA Web site.
Save Our Streams, a Rice University-based organization that represents several dozen college radio stations,
lists more than thirty stations that have been forced off the

like the current movie shuttle. Students will sign in and
note the time and location at which they wish to be
picked up. Only round trips will be offered to ensure
that nobody gets left behind in the city.
"Philly is a great resource and we want to make >it
available to everyone," student council Co-president
Ryan Budish 'O4 said. "This is a good alternative to
SEPTA, since SEPTA is really expensive."
The council approached President Al Bloom with the
idea of the Philly van last year. "He gave the money and
made it happen," Budish said. "It was very nice of him
to show interest in this important issue." Budish, along
with council members Liane Rice 'O3, Ed Stehlik 'O5 and
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave, then worked
to implement the program.
The council will not be able to say when the service
will start until they obtain a van. Budish stressed, however, that there are several professional drivers who
have expressed interest in this job and that many people are committed to making the program a success..
Several other initiatives were discussed at the first

we want to make it available

council meeting. Two of the council's top priorities for
the semester are the creation of a special student wage
for especially demanding jobs and the extension of the

web by the cost.
"The plight of independent noncommercial radio is that

reading week period.
"There are a set of very demanding jobs on this campus that only get paid at the top hourly rate," Budish
said. "This makes it hard to attract people to these
jobs." Some campus employers offer special incentives,
such as unearned hours of pay or gift certificates to fill
demanding jobs. Since not all demanding jobs are
equally rewarded in this way, however, some students
do demanding work and get paid only the official top
wage, currently $7.50 per hour. The council hopes to
create a special elevated wage to make compensations
for this type of job more equitable.

U.S. News rankings again put Swarthmore near the top
BY KELSEY HOLLENBACK
khollenl@swarthmore.edu
Last Friday, when issues of U S. News and World Report
hit newsstands across the country, Swarthmore had
dropped from first to second place, tied with Williams and
behind Amherst.
Swarthmore and Amherst tied for first in 200 L Amherst
received the first-place ranking in 1998 and 2000, while
Swarthmore was ranked first in 1997 and 1999.
Swarthmore has been among the top liberal-arts
schools every year since the magazine began compiling its

rankings 16 years ago.
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 acknowledged that
this distinction can work to Swarthmore's benefit. "It
serves to attract some students who may not be as familiar
with higher education in the United States," he said. "It's
valuablefor encouraging people to take a look at us." But,
he added, "It's not a valid reason for people to come here.
"[The rankings] measure what can be measured, which
is not necessarily what defines a good educational experience," Gross said. "The real important issue, like what is
the quality of the experience that students receive, has
proven difficult to measure in any reliable way."
Twenty-five percent of a college's rank is determined by
peer assessment, in which college presidents, provosts and
deans of admission are asked to rate peer schools' academic programs. Retention and faculty resources each
account for twenty percent of the score, student selectivity
for fifteen percent, and the graduation rate, financial
resources, and alumni giving rate for the remaining twenty percent. The top-ranked college's score is set at 100, with
the others adjusted accordingly.
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Jim Bock agreed

with Gross, saying, "I think that U.S. News is striving to be
more meaningful... but it's more quantitative than qualitative. They also want to sell magazines. How meaningful
is it if it changes every year?"

"[U.S. News and World Report]
also wants to sell magazines. How
meaningful is it if it changes every
year?"
Dean of Admissions & Financial Aid
Jim Bock
Paul Statt, director of media relations at Amherst, seconded this opinion. "Do I think that somehow in the last
year Amherst has improved so much or Swarthmore has
suffered some inexplicable loss? No. Of course not. I think
that all the top schools the students at the top schools
understand that one ranking like this is in itself rather
meaningless."
So how important are the rankings to students? And
how large a role do they play in a prospective student's

decision?
"I haven't even looked at [the rankings]," prospective
student Kelsey Baldwin of Texas said. "I heard all about
how trivial and stupid they are." She cited rumors of ratings inflation as her chief reason for distrusting U.S. News'
list, adding that she believes that it's difficult to choose a
college based on rankings.
"I looked at Amherst," she said. "I hated the campus so

much, I couldn't take a tour. I really could not stand it at all."
"I haven't actually looked," said Rebecca Ortenberg, a
prospective student from California. "I wantto go to a good
school, but I don't think that the rank of the school matters
as long as you feel comfortable. There are people who go to
schools that are not highly ranked who get a good education, and people who go to really high ranking schools who
don't like it."
Christopher Hazard 'O6, from Jalisco, Mexico, said that
while U.S. News' rankings did influence which schools he
applied to, 'after I got accepted, it was one school's merit over
the others, which felt right and whichdidn't. When I stepped
onto campus it just felt right."
Bock concurs. "Typically, Swarthmore students have
not given [the rankings] a lot of weight," he said. "I'm not
impressed by someone who applies because of the ranking.
It's what they do with the information."
The administration meets each year in an effort to
improve students' academic and overall experience at
Swarthmore, Bock said. But it has nothing to do with the
magazine. "We did itbefore U.S. News existed, and we'll do
it when U.S. News disappears."

Engineering prof's GRACE wows audience
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY

kduongll@swarthmore.edu

When she reached the registration desk, she asked for a
nametag, a bag and directions to
the area where she was to give
her talk. Then, GRACE gave a
PowerPoint presentation about
herself to an audience of other
conference attendees.
She performed only one of her
tasks incorrectly: starting inside
the conference center at the doorway, she found the elevator by
speaking to one of her designers.
Once she found the proper floor
in the conference center, she
began to look for a pink sign that

it was this capacity that was put
to the test when she had to find

College changes financial management and structure
BY CYNTHIA WU
xwu2@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore College's endowment is about $B5O million
Suzanne Welsh handles it all.
Since 1989, Welsh has worked as Treasurer of the
Business Office, which is in charge of the endowment,
budgeting, cash management and the business office. This
year, Welsh has tucked yet another job under her belt: Vice
President of Finance and Planning.
1 President Al Bloom asked Welsh take over after former
Vice President Paul Aslanian decided to retire last August.
On her new position, Welsh said, "A big part of it is education and communication
making sure that everyone
understands ultimately the decisions that are made." She
cited the College Budget Committee, a group of students,
faculty and staff, as an example that financial decisions
are made in a "participatory process" at Swarthmore, and
that the college "doesn't have any secrets about the budg-

I- and

et."

Although the college's investment in the stock market
THE PHOENIX

has dropped from its peak of $1 billion in September 2000,
due to recent events like Sept. 11, Swarthmore "is still in a
good financial position to move forward," Welsh said.
"The college is in really excellent financial shape," she
added. "We've had a period of many years of good growth
and investment returns, and [until recently] we've had a
good stock market."
With the change in personnel, a few changes were also
made to the college's administrative structures. Before
Aslanian retired to spend more time with his family, the
Vice President of Finance and Planning was responsible
for three main divisions: the Treasurer's Office, the Office
of Institutional Research and the Office of Human
Resources.
Now, the new business office handles the financial
wealth of the college. "We hire and supervise outside professionals to invest the endowment in stocks and bonds,
and we use the interest to support the budget," Welsh said.

these students had a chance to
present their research to those

who dropped by LPAC Tuesday
evening and Wednesday after-

noon.

Display posters filled LPAC's
lobby with presentations from a
number of subject areas in the

sciences.
Some of the research was done
at Swat over the summer; somewas done in more far-flung areas
of the country and around the
globe. Many of the students were
offered summer jobs helping out a
professor with a specific project.
That's how Andrew Stout 'O3,
Julie Corder 'O3 and Oliver Hsu
'O3 started looking into how to
make a computer process images
for content with Professor Bruce
Maxwell.
The opportunity to discuss
summer research in detail doesn't
come up often here, Corder said.
She and a friend spent the summer together at Swat working on
different research projects, but
neither asked about what the
other was doing until they started
preparing for the poster presentations. Corder enjoyed the opportunity to share what she had done
this summer and said she was

This was Stout's second year

last year he did his research away

from Swat. He said opportunities
to share research experiences are
particularly valuable to students
who do research elsewhere, as it
is a good way to exchange ideas.
The value of such an exchange
of ideas was very evident to
Corder Tuesday night
she was
approached by several people
from the biology department who
found her work with images

directly applicable to their own
area of research.
To a large extent it is the availability of research opportunities,
rather than students' primary
interests, that determines the topics students are able to investigate over the summer. Corder had

never taken a course on the subject of image segmentation, and
said she had to do a lot of catch up
reading before starting work for
the
summer. Many of the
research projects, like Corder's,
are still in progress.
The goal of Corder, Hsu's and
Stout's project is to find a way for
computers to process images
more quickly
and to read their
content in a meaningful way. The
key to this is in finding algorithms that help computers to rec-

regions formed by either changes
in lighting or changes in material. Corder said a number of al-

gorithms already exist, but there

is no good way to evaluate how

broadly applicable the algorithms

are.
"Our goal is to create a database of a couple hundred images
and use them to compare one
algorithm with another," she
said. The next step is to run statistical analysis to find properties
unique to edges of an image.
Corder anticipates turning her
summer research into a senior

thesis, as do a number of other

college] desires" on the ratings game.
The Office of Human Resources is responsible for the employment and benefits of the college's faculty and staff. As of now, it
reports not to the vice president for finance, but directly to the president of the college. "We made this change to recognize the importance of benefit and welfare issues of the faculty and staff," Welsh
said. "We also made this change so we don't dilute our attention
from financial issues."
She hopes the personnel and administrative changes will be "a
pretty seamless transition" and expects no negative impacts on the

college community as a result.
Welsh came to Swarthmore in 1983 as assistant treasurer. She
was promoted to the position of treasurer in 1989 and continues to
hold the position today, along with her new position of vice president for finance. A financial-aid scholarship was named after her in
2000, honoring her as an "outstanding administrator."

SC starts semester with busy agenda
From VAN, pg. 3
The reading period before
exams this semester is 2 1/2 days

long. The council believes that

students deserve a longer reading
week and is working with
Registrar Martin Warner to see if
this can be accomplished.
But the fall semester is already
shorter than the spring semester.
The school does not want to start
the fall semester any earlier than
Labor Day, nor end any later, as it
already ends only two days before

Christmas. The council would
also like to eliminate the practice

of scheduling exams during an
already tight reading week.
The council also discussed an
extensive list of other proposed

projects. These ranged from
improving the faculty advising
program to removing the ban on
personal air conditioning in student rooms, to the possibility of

the

we've been kind of orphaned," Salmon said. Laws are written with
commercial broadcasters in mind, and public radio stations are
taken care of by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which
negotiates their licensing agreements outside the framework of the
1998 law. Meanwhile, college stations fend for themselves.
The worst part, in Salmon's view, is not the money but the "ludicrous restrictions placed on programming." To get a webcasting
license, a station must agree not to play more than three songs from
any album or more than four songs by any one artist in any three-hour
block, not to announce what songs will be played before playing them,
not to play bootleg recordings, and to accept all kinds of obligations for
preventing listeners from scanning songs onto their computers.

"It sucks that WSRN can't do more. But first
and foremost we're a broadcast radio station."
Branen Salmon 'O3
The last requirement gets to the heart of the recording industry's
agenda; it wants to insure that webcasting does not become another
tool for music pirating on the Web. But for stations like WSRN, the

licensing standards are a nightmarish collection of complications.
These standards preclude everything from hosting shows based
around single artists to rebroadcasting programs, meaning the station
could lose its license over a single DJ's mistake. "Expecting [each DJ]
to remember never to play a bootleg record is asking a lot," Salmon
said. No WSRN representative would comment for this article.
More worrisome than the regulations already made, he added, are
the regulations yet to come. Among the licensing requirements for
webcasts listed by the RIAA is a demand that stations make a quarterly report detailing various kinds of information concerning every song

si a iwprtilfiii-

played. The details have yet to be worked out, but the proposals include
forcing stations to track all users, which would raise privacy issues.
Other considerations would require stations to report the international standard recording code of every track played, which would
require WSRN to invest in new CD players capable of reading the
codes. "It's like playing Russian roulette," Salmon said. "The rules
could change at any time."
WSRN has signed several petitions protesting the new fees and regulations, and last year it added its name to Save Our Stream's list of college stations forced off the Web. "It sucks that WSRN can't do more,"
Salmon said. "But first and foremost we're a broadcast radio station."

Truth is cubic?

la

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

A self-proclaimed sage explains all about ultimate
reality and why everyone is just plain wrong.

Before becoming the first human to comprehend Nature's Harmonic Simultaneous 4Day Time Cube, Gene Ray was a self-described "master electrician, inventor and inquisitive thinker." Today he calls himself "The Wisest Human to ever live on Earth."
Ray, 75, says he has discovered "absolute, unrefutable proof of four simultaneous 24hour days within a single rotation of Earth." He has dedicated the past 20 years of his life
to furthering the Time Cube philosophy. He's invested an estimated $250,000 in his mission and claims to have received death threats from NASA.
Ray's Web site features a 6,200-word invective starting with the words "Tis time to kill
any educator who does not teach Cubicism against cubelessness." The diatribe is peppered with equally controversial statements, including "YOU were educated EVIL," "Evil is
cubeless. God is cubeless," "All Clock Faces Are Wrong," "I think Cubic, I am Wisest. You
think self, you are evil," and "USA on a path to cannibalism."
Despite Ray's efforts, academia and the media ignore his findings. Last January, however, students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosted Ray as a speaker.
His Web site advertised the event, offering $lO,OOO to any professor who could disprove
Time Cube. The site also said, "Your god is invited to attend, and a chair will be prepared." No professors came forward to accept Ray's challenge. A chair labeled "Your
God" remained empty. The offer still stands.

Ray (pictured at right) granted The Phoenix a phone interview from his home in
Cummings, GA.

The Phoenix: What is Time Cube?
Gene Ray: Time Cube equates the four corners of a
classroom to the corners of the Earth. Educators teach
one corner of knowledge instead of dividing the hemispheres into four corners like a pie. All further divisions
have to be made in corners. Four is the largest and smallest number in the universe.
The sun shines midday at one point, and it simultaneously creates an opposite corner point, what we call midnight. Earth
most academics refer to it as a circle, but
it's actually a solid sphere. It has a four-corner quadrant,
and it rotates around four different corners itself. Each

corner is its own separate world with its own separate
day. We teach only one corner. That's what we're doing
wrong, primarily.
It's like when a baby is born, because the mother
evolves. The mother and baby are the same age, they're
only opposite corners. There's no grandparent until the
baby is born. We don't recognize human metamorphosis.
Adults are not born; they only come from the baby. If you
don't recognize four corners, you only recognize changing
of the baby. You're just a big baby.
We are personified pyramid forms. You're only one
corner of who you think you are. Four lines go down the
corner stone [of the pyramid]. Your arms and legs represent those long lines going down. Three dimensions don't
account for that. 3-D is erroneous. All our math is erro-

neous.

Time Cube is the greatest social discovery of humanity, but it's forbidden knowledge. It's deliberately held
knowledge, because Time Cube would contradict knowledge. It would place academia in a single corner.
All creations are corners. When the mother and father
join hands, they create corners of son and daughter.
Corners of summer and winter join together create minor
corners of spring and fall. Thousands of people understand it.
We've been taught negative knowledge. For people to
comprehend Time Cube, they have to be deprogrammed
from what they're taught, so they can understand.

How did you discover Time Cube?
I've always given my mother credit for my birth rather
than Jesus or God or something of that nature. God has
nothing to do with it.
I tell scientists how a lowly earthworm has comprehended Time Cube. You divide the hemisphere into four
corners, and each has a separate day. There's a black race
day, an Indian race day, a white race day, and an Asian
race day. Midday goes 45 degrees to both sides, halfway to
midnight.
The nation of America is a fictitious nation, because
it's based on Word. All Word is counterfeit and fictitious.
Word is a more efficient form of mind enslavement than
the whip or shackle. If you get rid of Word, everybody can
do independent thinking.

The Self is the lowest form of humanity because it cannot procreate alone. It's the village that's the true perpetual body. It's like a flock of birds: each bird contributes to

8

the mass energy and spirit. It's the flocks that are the true
bodies of creation.
Time Cube is a creation of that body. It's what everything is created by. The way the earth is tilted is an
imperfection, and that's what life is based on. If there
were a perfect axis, there'd be no seasons, no life. The
earth rotates, and each season has its own separate year
on the axis of the sun. One perfect axis is like a straight
line on a heart monitor. It means death.
I got off track of your question somewhere. You can go
from the North Pole to the South Pole in zero time. Did
you know that? Time in New York City is slower than
time in Miami, Fla. The Earth is spinning faster in Miami
than it would be in New York because it's a shorter distance to the equator. Everything we've been taught is

erroneous.

You've got two cubes in a crapshoot. That's what life is about.
Gene Ray
How does Time Cube disprove God?
The Bible said God created Earth on the first day. I
have proof of four different days in one day. I've proven
four first days. Greenwich time is erroneous. There are
four simultaneous days on Earth.
Man invented Word, so he had to invent God. In [the]
beginning there was Word. That's all God is, is a word.
Judaism is Word. I have a book that talks about God, but
it's represented so you cannot speak it: KWKH or something of that nature. Four letters
you can't speak it. In
truth, you can't speak truth because it's four corners.
You can take human mind and put in tiger body, and
the mind has to conform to the tiger body. If you put a God
in a human body, then it has to conform to the limitation
of human body. No man can build the earth. God is in our
image. Man is acting like God, but he's not, he's only a
corner. God has no grandparents or grandchildren. The

principle of God is contradicted in the principle of life on
earth, because he's only one corner.
I hate to say evil things. I'm a good guy. I've been baptized, born again, all that.

Is Time Cube at all like Taoism?
Yin and yang is not cubic. Time Cube has masculine
and feminine
the two major opposites, like the two
hemispheres. Yin and yang does not have that.
What obstacles have you encountered while trying to
spread knowledge of Time Cube?
In South Florida they told me that if I came down there
again or sent another fax, they'd put me in jail.
Newspapers won't print [anything about Time Cube] for a
million dollars. No academic institution has allowed students to debate it. My brothers and sisters have some of
September 19,

2002

the highest academic degrees in Alabama, but they don't

want to know what I know.
I had to get nasty on the Web site because educators
refuse to allow students to debate Time Cube. I can't
throw rocks at them, so the only way I can accuse them is
in a nasty way. I have to do this so they'll stop ignoring it.
They'd be exposed, all educators. I get e-mail from kids all
the time. Some were suspended for looking at my Web site
at school.
[Time Cube] is coming and it will be recognized someday, because you cannot disprove it. I've got a clear plastic cube with the earth in it. It's got the earth's four corners. That cannot be disproved.
Students have to rise up and demand that Time Cube
be debated. MIT is talking about it. They may take it over
and support it and keep it going. I get a lot of email from
students saying I should be elected president of their student body, and that they'd fight the police [if necessary].
But the school threatens to kick them out. Students at
MIT debated Time Cube, but it was not supported or
endorsed by the institution. Physics majors want a Time
Cube debate at Cornell.
I've also sent stuff to Stephen Hawking in England, but
they all ignore it. They teach linear time. Time is not linear; it's cubic. Academia does not want it. Professors run
and hide. I can call them the worst names in the book, and
they run and hide. They cannot challenge me. They cannot accept the challenge because they would lose. I could.
break the plate glass windows of a newspaper building,
and I guarantee they wouldn't take me to court, because
[Time Cube] cannot come out [in the media].

How will Time Cube help people?
We're destroying everything. One day we're going to
wake up without water. All the nuclear waste put in one
dump could blow the nation half apart. We don't consider
those things. Humans are still in state of ignorance. The
world is a creation different than what we're taught. We
have to change the teachers. Teachers change for money,
not to help kids. Language is like a Trojan horse with
deadly deceits in it. All Word is counterfeit.
There's a link on my Web site to a story about some
Europeans who went to Easter Island. They cut down a
tall tree to make long boats to catch porpoises. They
moved icons. All the birds left, and the people ate all the
chickens, then they started practicing cannibalism. We're
going the same way. We're cutting down forests, plundering resources. We're on the same path to cannibalism.
You've got two cubes in a crapshoot. That's what life is
going to meet. It's all
crapshoot. I call it LET, Location Exposure Time. It dis
proves religion and academia: the sense that everything
has an opposite, so you can counterbalance it and
destroy it.

CD REVIEWS: PULP,
Less musical, but relevant
You might not remember this, but four
years ago, before you came to college,
there was a girl in your high school who
wanted to sleep with Jarvis Cocker. She
probably had dyed hair. (You know Jarvis:
Pulp's bulgy-eyed but sexy lead singer.)
And there was that Anglophile on your
bus route, reading an issue of New Music
Express with "Party Hard" in his headphones, thinking about how great it would
be to play that at a dance party. You might
not have been aware of it at the time. Or

The 1955 Halcyon

One of Swat's most famous alumni will come to campus Oct. 3. He tells The Phoenix
about his years at Swarthmore, running for President and his views on politics today
BY GREGORY NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

In

his time at Swarthmore, Michael S.
Governor
Dukakis,
future
of
Massachusetts and Democratic nominee for the President of the United States,
did not always employ the pen, podium, or
other traditional tools of the political trade.
Sometimes he chose scissors instead.
"There were three barbershops

in

Swarthmore at the time and all of them
refused to cut the black students' hair,"
Dukakis recalled. "This was long before

the sit-ins, before the civil rights movement really got started on a national scale.
I set up my own barbershop on the 3rd floor
of Wharton D. We cut a lot of hair."
Not only did Dukakis and his friends
cut the hair of the few black students
enrolled in Swarthmore at the time, but
they turned his impromptu barbershop
into a campus-wide industry. He charged
65 cents a cut, combining social activism
with private enterprise, and earned him-

self some pocket money in the process. "I
didn't have a license, though, so don't mention this to the state barber commission,"
he said.
"Eventually," he added, "one of the barbers in town, a Holocaust survivor, decided
to change his policy."
When Dukakis arrived at Swarthmore

Hall dorm room, he still had plans to follow
in his father's footsteps and become a doctor. But his sojourn as a Swarthmore premed student lasted until his first con-

frontation with freshman physics. He
received what he has since called "a charitable 'D.'"
"I came to the understanding that I'm
genetically challenged when it comes to
physics," he said. "I realized in my first
year at Swarthmore that I wasn't going to
become a doctor, that my interests lay in
political science and history. I think that's

the beauty of a liberal arts college."

Graduating at the top of his Brookline,
Mass., high school class, Dukakis was
expected to attend nearby Harvard
University where his admission was more
or less guaranteed. He didn't even apply.
Swarthmore was known then for the same
things it is now: social activism, even in
the conservative climate of the 1950s and
rigorous academics.
It is fair to say these qualities attracted
a student who would later sign up a third of
the campus for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) and graduate
among the top three students in his class.
But he also wanted to get a little farther
from home than the other side of
Cambridge. "I had never been outside of
New England before except on one visit to
Swarthmore," he said.
Dukakis managed to make his mark on
campus through more conventional means
than cutting hair. As a freshman he organized students in support of Joe Clark, a

PATRIOT Act proves tough for libraries
BY ANDREW COLLINS
The Chronicle (Duke U.)
(U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C.
As the federal government demands more information and reveals less, a surprising loser in the war on terrorism may turn out to be
the library. Among the anti-terrorism bills passed after
the Sept. 11 attacks, the USA Patriot Act may present the
biggest threat to the privacy of library users. The Patriot
Act makes it easier for the government to demand circulation records, internet logs, and lists of e-mail recipients

have decried some of the provisions of the legislation. A
joint statement released by three major library associations in October 2001 expressed significant concern that
the government's increased monitoring of communica-

tions and records would threaten the rights of library
users.
Even so, Ferriero said the public did not fully appreciate the Patriot Act's potential threat to privacy. "I don't
think a lot of people have paid attention," he said. "A
public outcry will come, but only after an egregious incident."

Other governmental measures designed to thwart ter-

from libraries.
"It raises the authority of the federal government to
capture information that librarians would consider
sacred and private," said David Ferriero, Duke
University librarian. "Where are we going with this Big
Brother thing?"
Congress hastily debated and passed the Patriot Act
over the course of six weeks in October 2001, as a part of
post-Sept. 11 efforts to curb terrorist activity. President
George W. Bush called the act essential to the war on terror, and it received overwhelming support in both hous-

es of Congress.
Both civil-liberties groups and library associations

rorism have raised questions about the public's right to
access information in libraries.
Many universities, including Duke, participate in the
Federal Government Depository Program, which means
they receive documents from the government and house
them in their library systems. After Sept. 11, certain publications were recalled from depository program participants because they contained what government agencies
believed to be sensitive material.
The libraries are obliged to comply with any federal

directive. "As we understand it, those documents still

Verba, director of the Harvard University Library.
Last March, Duke was one of at least seven universities in the depository program forced to destroy a CDROM put out by the United States Geological Survey that
contained information on water supplies, said Ann
Miller, head of the library's public documents and maps
department.
The government's recall of this CD-ROM and other
documents is a continuation of a broader trend of withholding public information, said Joe Hewitt, associate
provost for university libraries at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "They've been reducing
the number of documents we receive for the past few
years," he said. "They've been relying on saying, 'lt's on

Now, many government agencies have scrubbed sensitive material from their Web sites, leaving the information inaccessible to the public.
Many librarians have voiced their displeasure regarding the government's growing secrecy. "The reason that
they're public records is they need to be available to
future generations," Ferriero said. "They can't be

The Public Safety Committee of the Swarthmore Borough Council has been
discussing how to address concerns of business-area residents regarding loud
and boisterous behavior during the later evening hours.
Over the summer the police department received numerous calls, usually
between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., regarding excessive noise.
Officers tried their best to inform those present that they were welcome to gather peacefully in the business district but they had certain responsibilities. On several occasions the behavior and size of the crowd necessitated the officers to
order crowds to disperse after they continually engaged in loud behavior and
blocked the street. Fortunately the occa,BBI''I'III'BI''BB—sions requiring police intervention have
not resulted in enforcement actions.

One of the suggestions resulting from
the Public Safety Committee meeting

was to provide information about existing laws which officers can use to deal
There were no incidents to
with problem situations.
I report for this week.
One topic of discussion was a possible curfew. Swarthmore does not have a
curfew ordinance. However, every surrounding municipality does have a curfew. Persons underthe age of 18 should
be aware of those provisions as they may be in violation of those ordinances
when returning home. Additionally, those driving vehicles and in possession of
a junior driver's license may be in violation if driving after 11:00 p.m.
The Codified Ordinances of the Borough of Swarthmore, Chapter 624, deals
with disorderly conduct and peace disturbances. Section 624.01 identifies
twelve provisions defined as disorderly conduct. Several refer to activities that
have been observed by police. Subsection (c) prohibits the writing upon, defacing, removal, injury to, destruction of, or misuse of any real or personal property without proper authorization of the owner. Subsection (d) bans the whole
or partial obstruction of any street or portion thereof, any private walk or
entrance, where such obstruction is avoidable and unnecessary. Free access
to public and private facilities or business establishments is covered by subsection (e). Additional provisions of this section cover fighting, unnecessary
noise by human or mechanical means, being found in a drunken or intoxicated condition tending to disturb the neighborhood, and various other restric-

tions.

I am running for Student Council
Secretary/Treasurer. I am quite capable of
fulfilling the duties of the position.

jealous?) I have time to dedicate to
Student Council. If elected, I'll tackle all
those important issues: vans to

I have had as much student-government experience as is possible at the high
school level; I spent a year as my class
secretary, two years as class president,
and participated in several leadership programs and decision-making groups. I really
am competent, I promise.
And I'm a champion of the masses,
too. Please vote for me.

The police department's goal is to serve all segments of the community
including the downtown residents and visitors.
We encourage the peaceful gathering of young people looking to share conversation and company. The hope is that parents will reinforce to their children
the need to be responsible for their individual behavior and considerate of others. Officers would prefer to dedicate their time to preventive patrol of the
community and addressing more serious issues.
We look forward to the continuing dialog sponsored by the Public Safety
Committee to clarify community standards and expectations and then working
to meet those expectations.

A RECAP

At first glance, Student Council's proposed
weekend shuttle to Philadelphia seems like a
uniformly good idea. It would get Swatties out of
the bubble, expose them to real food, real
movies, and liberate them from Foucault for a
couple of hours on occasion.
The problems SC now faces getting the pro-

gram off the ground

not enough vans, and not
enough cash to buy more
seem uniformly
bad. But perhaps these obstacles are a blessing
in disguise. They will give the council more time
to gague student interest and determine exactly
what schedule would benefit students most.
There is no question that Swarthmore students lack sufficient transportation options to
Philadelphia. A round trip on SEPTA can cost
upwards of $B, and finding a friend with a car on
this road-free campus is often a futile cause. A
free Philly van would remove these economic
barriers to an occasional night out. Additionally,
the vans would run late into the night, long after
SEPTA has gone to sleep, allowing Swatties to
frequent bars and clubs without blowing a summer's savings on a taxi or camping out at

Market East.
So while we agree with the many students
surveyed by SC who think a Philly shuttle is a
great idea, we wonder how many students it
would actually serve each week. Anyone can circle "great idea" on a survey. Students with cars
wouldn't need the shuttle. Nor would students
who spend weekends in Cornell or asleep in
their rooms, despite the fact that they applied to

Swarthmore partially because of its proximity
to a big city. It is worth noting that the coUege
has run vans to Philly in the past, but the service fizzled due to waning student interest. The
council should not encourage the college to fund
what amounts to a very desirable, yet essentially
frill service, if only a few students will bother to

use it.

The fact is, though, SC has no way of knowing how many students would participate until
the shuttle starts running.
So, perhaps the council can use a the current
lack of vans to its advantage. SC need not wait
weeks or months to start up shuttle service just
because all the resources are not yet available.
The council could start the program small in
order to gauge student interest with actual num-

bers. No vans yet? Begin running the shuttle on
a limited basis, using a council van. Do just one

trip a day, going out right at 7 p.m. and coming
back at 2 a.m., so as not to interfere with other
student groups' van schedules too much.
If the van is packed every night and dozens of

Swatties are left shuttle-less on Parrish steps, SC
will know their idea has backing and will have
hard evidence to draw increased funding for the
program. Additionally, running the shuttle on
an experimental scale would give SC time to
work out logistical kinks. For example, would
students be required to take the shuttle both
ways? If not, how to deal with an overload of students waiting for pickup in Philly?
Starting up the Philly shuttle on a small,
experimental basis would provide a realistic
gauge of student interest and make the program,
when it is instated in full, all the more efficient.

that the picture on the home page, as

Reviewer misunderstood film's meaning
Dear Editor,
All that Ester Bloom's movie review "Really Bad Sex"
(Sept 12) managed to convey was her misunderstanding of
Spanish cinema and of Director Julio Medem's cinematic
project, which portrays the synthesis of sex and love in order
to paint a picture of the pathos of human suffering in its
absence. To some American audiences "Lucia y el sexo" seems
XXX rated, but Spanish audiences are much more accustomed
to and comfortable with explicitly sexual material than with,
say, overly violent (American) material in film. "Lucia y el
sexo" is a powerful film that beautifully sews together the
threads of female agency, sexual independence and familial

As is the case with many other artistic projects, it is useless to critique or to try to understand this film while taking

part should be made to understand the greater vision and purpose of films like this one

Freeing higher education
BY MAYA SCHENWAR

mschenwl@swarthmore.edu

After a rather sobering conversation with my mother about financial aid this summer, I brought the issue
up with some friends from home. Worrying about paying for college was nothing new for any of them: three
are living at home due to financial constraints, one is
commuting thirty miles a day to attend the cheapest
school in the area (a school she dislikes with a passion)
and one has transferred to a different school because of
tuition hikes.
Students across the country share these woes. As
tuition skyrockets and aid dwindles, the college-aged
population is watching its postsecondary opportunities,
shrivel faster than Enron stock. And with federal
grants down more than 11 percent since 1980, the government hasn't done much to help. The current tuition
crisis and the inherent inequality of our college funding system, however, make a clear case that the government should step in.
We cannot simply blame tuition increases on the
recent financial bust. A May study by the National
Center for Public Policy and Higher Education shows
that between 1980 and 2000, the chunk of family income
required to pay for tuition increased for all families
except those with incomes in the top 20 percent. The
increase was greatest for low- and middle-income
families.
Perhaps if financial aid were offered to all who
needed it, tuition jumps would pose no problem. But
the current aid system severely limits opportunities
for students with less-than-boundless funds. While
many private and wealthy public high schools provide
college resource centers complete with FAFSA clinics,
computer-based aid-calculating programs and multiple
college counselors, poorer schools cannot afford the
resources necessary to navigate the financial-aid web.
The inner-city high school where my father teaches
does not even have a college counselor on staff, and it
is hardly the poorest school in Chicago.
In a perfect world (where, perhaps, local property
taxes did not determine public school funding), all students would be fully educated about grants, loans and
never-ending tax forms. Yet with financial assistance
in its current state, even that would not do much good.

THE PHOENIX

Federal grants are down and are still declining. Many
students either fail to qualify for loans, exhaust their
financial possibilities before completing their degree
sometimes permaor must take time off of college
nently
in order to work. The Pentagon has even
stopped covering college for Gls. It all rounds out to a
grim reality: the current financial aid system is about

as fair as love and war combined. The fact of the matter is that, in a really perfect world, disadvantaged students would not have to overcome financial obstacles
in order to attend college.
Of course, most of us would jump at the chance to
receive a free college education. No work-study, no
interminable loans, no FAFSA forms. But most of us
also shift into scoff mode the minute a plan for government-funded postsecondary education is mentioned. As
with universal health care, prison reform and renewable energy legislation, people assume that it hasn't
been done because it can't be done.
Adolph Reed Jr., writing in Dissent, serves up a reality check: a complete college funding program would
cost about $46 billion a year at most. That's significantly less than the $6O billion that could be produced by
simply closing corporate tax loopholes. In most Western
European countries, free (or close-to-free) higher education is commonplace. Ditto for Canada, Ethiopia,
Poland and El Salvador. Government-funded college
education is not just a good idea; it's a
feasible one.
It might also be a good investment, fueling economic growth and making society safer. A 1988 congressional report estimated that every dollar spent through
the GI Bill (which funded postsecondary education for
veterans) generated about $6.90 in additional tax revenues. In addition, a recent study by the Federal
Bureau of Prisons shows an inverse relationship
between education and criminal activity. It's not hard
to see why juveniles with more education opportunities
would be less likely to turn to crime. Free access to
higher education could help every citizen, disadvan-

taged or not.
We must not let Washington ignore this issue as college becomes an increasingly difficult prospect for all
but the wealthiest Americans. Making tuition-free
higher education a part of our national agenda would
benefit us all.

Still, we drink our beer from
disposable plastic cups.
This is bad form.
Beer has a very well-recorded history. Sumerians and

Mesopotamians are thought to have been drinking a similar
beverage starting around 10,000 BC. The Egyptians and
Chinese had beer, as did natives of the Americas who made
something like it using corn. During the Middle Ages,
European monks preserved and refined the brewing
technique.

A beer revolution occurred when Louis Pasteur established that yeast was a living microorganism. His discovery
led to accurate control of the conversion of sugar to alcohol.
During Prohibition in the 1920s the quality ofbeer declined as
old breweries were replaced by gangster-controlled operations that failed to adhere to high standards of quality.
Pennsylvania is rich in beer history. Yuengling and Son in
Pottsville, Schuylkill County has been in continuous operation since 1829 (it produced what was called "near-beer" during Prohibition). In 1840, John Wagner created the first
American lager in his brewery near Philadelphia.
Still, we drink our beer from disposable plastic cups. This
is bad form, especially for students on a socially- and environmentally-aware campus. Many of us drink from reusable
mugs and water bottles during the day, but with the setting of
the sun comes the unveiling of loads of plastic and paper cups.
I have actually seen a few first-years with glass or ceramic mugs in their hands at Swat parties. I am impressed. But I
am calling for much more than a few mugs. I am calling on
the Swarthmore community to start a revolution. To all who
make beer consumption an essential element of your culture:
start shopping for your mugs now. Your landfills will thank
you. Your children will thank you.
It comes back to awareness. We don't consume alcohol as a
religious experience, but we don't drink it accidentally
although we might accidentally drink too much. If we had
mugs that we could identify as our own, we wouldn't have
excuses like "Wow, those were big cups." We wouldn't spill.
We wouldn't share germs. If our mugs had lids, we could prevent unwanted substances from making their way into our
drinks, which I'm sure can happen even here.
Earthlust has not yet invested in beer mugs, but every
beer drinker should have one. Mugs would teach us to appreciate quality despite Natty Light, and they would endure on
our windowsills and mantles for decades to come.

Opinions
Going back to Iraq
It looks like we're going to bomb Iraq in the near future. Bush
has really been pounding on the old war drums lately: declaring
that Osama bin Laden is a lesser concern than Saddam Hussein,
going to the United Nations to ask for new resolutions that would
almost certainly lead to a confrontation, and beefing up the number of jets patrolling the no-flight zones. By now, Bush has invested so much political capital in an invasion that I'm not sure he
could back down even if he wanted to.
Just for the sake of argument, let's assume that the Iraqi
regime is as vulnerable as the hawks seem to believe it is. A few
weeks or months from now, we invade with whatever allies we
can scrounge up, vaporize any Iraqi soldiers who fight harder
than Frenchmen, keep civilian
casualties to a bare minimum and
send a great big laser-guided missile
right into Saddam's stupid mus-

tache.
Then what?
Even if the coming war goes

swimmingly, we're still going to
have an awful lot of issues to deal

with vis-a-vis Iraq. The threat that

DAVID HAENDLER

Two-Fisted Punditry

Iraq represents to the West in general and the United States in particular won't vanish once the regime
has been violently overthrown. In
fact, the situation might even get
worse if certain problems are mishandled.
The most obvious concern is
finding a replacement government
for the country once Saddam has

gone the way of the dodo. We shouldn't leave Iraq under military
governorship forever, and I don't think there's support for making it into the 51st state. The only other alternative is putting in
ideally one that will be friendly to the
a new government
United States and responsive to the needs of the Iraqi people.
The worst-case scenario is that Bush transforms Iraq into
another Saudi Arabia. The very last thing we need is another
corrupt, repressive client state that blackens our already shaky
moral stature and betrays us at every available opportunity.
Fifteen of our beloved Saudi friends did a lot more damage to the
United States than Iraq's entire military has ever managed to.
To be fair, the Bush administration seems to have done a
decent job installing a new government in Afghanistan. Sure, the
central government is still pretty weak and the warlords haven't
really given up their Mad Max lifestyle, but there's only so much
progress you can expect in a country that could reasonably be
considered the worst place on Earth. After the ouster of the
Taliban, Afghanistan is at least on track for greater stability,
democracy and personal freedom. That's a happy enough ending.
The problem is that the circumstances in the two countries
are not terribly similar. In Afghanistan we had to be relatively
circumspect. There were never a whole lot of U.S. ground troops
in the country, and the natives were packing more heat than a
John Woo protagonist, meaning that we had to pay a fair amount
of attention to local sensibilities.
With the exception of the Kurds in the north, the people of
Iraq have intentionally been kept unarmed and pliable, and
there will be an awful lot of occupying ground forces. That
means the country will be easier to stabilize once the dust has
settled, but it also means that Bush could get away with plopping
down a seemingly-friendly dictator in lieu of genuine reform.
We'll also face the problem that a war might make America
more vulnerable to large-scale acts of terrorism. Unless we
miraculously manage to immediately annihilate every stockpile
of biological and chemical weapons in the country, there's a good

chance that at least a few Iraqi soldiers, scientists or janitors will
try to finance their retirements by walking out of the lab with a
few cans of smallpox.
Given that the entire rationale of the war is to keep these
weapons of mass destruction out of terrorist hands, this sort of
thing ought to be a major concern. I'm deeply pessimistic about
the military's ability to safely destroy Saddam's vaunted arsenal,
and you should be too. Heck, the United States still hasn't taken
reasonable steps to secure or destroy leftover Soviet nukes, and
the Cold War ended over a decade ago.
I still think that war against Iraq is basically a good idea. I'm
of the opinion that another conflict with Saddam is inevitable
sooner or later, and I'd prefer to get it out of the way before he
can build anything that's radioactive.
But in a war against terrorism, simply overthrowing bad
regimes isn't enough to ensure success. Iraq won't necessarily
stop being a menace even after its dictator is gone. I hope the
Bush administration understands that.

A war of credibility fought
by an army of desperation
On September 11, The
New York Times ran a

ing for a college degree. When asked about the
prospect of war, they shrug it off, saying that they're

news piece investigating

trying not to think about it, that other things (e.g. football, school, girlfriends) are more important at the
moment.
Military recruits, by and large, are college-aged.
They're kids. They're naive, they're self-centered,
they're big on immediate gratification and less concerned with potential consequences. College-aged
civilians are ideal recruits, because they're in the
prime of their lives, because they're physicaUy capable and because they're not likely to have major ideological objections, or, more to point, any realistic
notion of what they're getting into.
While these 18- and 19-year-olds are stressing over
paying for college, graduating high school and not
pissing off their girlfriends, Bush is talking war, or
rather an intervention that will prove our "credibility," in Iraq. We have to show Saddam who's boss, we
have to make him comply with the U.N. stipulations,
and we have to save the Iraqi people from his heinous,
tyrannical reign. More cruciaUy, though, we have to
find something to fixate on in order to divert national
attention from the elusive bin Laden, whose yet-undetermined whereabouts are likely to leave a nasty
imprint on Republican ratings. The whole thing
smacks a little too much of 'Nam.
I wonder why they don't make new recruits watch
the scenes from "Platoon" that graphically depict the
events of the Vietnam War. Watching these would render the event realistic for kids who may not know who
Nixon was and most certainly couldn't tell you why
the United States decided to send its youth to face
gruesome death in Southeast Asia.
I wonder why, in the midst of assurances of salaries
and college funding, recruiters aren't telling prospective soldiers that the military is sending letters to current soldiers refusing to grant them leave and telling
them to be prepared to be sent to Iraq, date as yet
uncertain.
Perhaps most importantly, I wonder how many
new recruits would still sign themselves up for 5-10
years in the military if they knew it might cost them
their lives, or how many would bother dealing with
the recruiters in the first place if they hadn't been
lured by the dangling carrot of cash in their pockets
and the possibility of forming better lives
if they'd
had the privilege to shrug off such prospects because
society provided them with other viable options.
But, for that to be the case, Bush would have to
masochistically enjoy stomping on his own toes, since
he can't very well promote forceful intervention in
Iraq without the comfortable protection of his Army of
Desperation; even he is wise enough not to wage a war
that he'd be fighting on his own.

In reality, this is not the
case. Recent high-school

their local recruiters because they're really stoked to
defend our national "credibility," as Bush called it
recently when addressing the United Nations, but
because they're in a bad place with few options.

of his high-school career acquiring an insatiable alco-

hol/drug habit and sleeping through the classes he

bothered to attend
realized that, if he managed to
earn a diploma, he'd suddenly be thrown face-first
into a world that wasn't ready to embrace him.
With extremely limited options and at my father's
insistence, he enlisted in the military. A month before
he turned 18 and three months before he graduated
from high school, my brother signed the next five
years of his life over to the government. A week after
his high school graduation, he was shipping out for
boot camp in Kentucky, sporting a classy metal tag
that claimed him as the "official property of the U.S.
Army." During his time as a Private First Class, the
military has done some wonderful things for my
brother: it's turned his life around, gotten him out of
a town that had nothing to offer, gotten him clean and
somehow managed to lure him onto a college-bound
trajectory. But he's still only 19, far from worldly-wise
and scheduled to leave for training in Iraq.
The Times article made no subjective assessment
of the increased military enlistment. It reported the
facts, complete with case-study quotations and biographical details of newly enlisted soldiers. The new
recruits have one thing in common: they are not joining the military because they feel some overwhelmingly compelling duty to serve their country. Such
patriotic notions aren't even on the horizon. What
new military recruits are thinking about is how to
find a way out of abject poverty, drug addiction, and
lives that offer next to nothing, and how to get themselves a regular paycheck and maybe even some fund-

Garnet prep for Seven Sisters Tournament
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

In the first few weeks of their season, the
field hockey team has faced some of the best
teams in the country. This experience, the

players believe, will serve them well head-

ing into this weekend's Seven Sisters
Tournament at Smith College.
Despite a pair of losses this week and a
1-3 overall record, the players and their
head coach Kelly Wilcox are impressed
with the team's play. jS(2 three losses [this
season] have been against teams that
played in the NCAA tournament last year.

We're playing at a really high level."
Early season matches with top-ranked
opponents have given Swarthmore the
opportunity to prepare for Centennial
Conference opponents.
"The teams we played exposed things we
need to work on," Wilcox said. "We're doing
well with our transitions and defensive
positioning. We need to put the ball in the

goal. In hockey sometimes that's just luck."
The Tide have yet to find the back of the
net since Lauren Sippel 'O5 dribbled past
the Ursinus goalkeeper on Sept. 10, but
players remain undeterred. "We definitely
have the skill level. It just hasn't connected
yet, but it will," Heidi Feiselmann 'O6 said.
"We are playing incredibly hard. As for
the scores, I think that's going to change,"
Katherine Athanasiades 'O5 added.
On the other hand, the Tide have had

success transitioning between two different
formations and implementing one of the
team's strengths, its depth. "We now feel
comfortable playing with different formations," Wilcox said. "A lot of players are getting experience. We have been able to sustain a high level of play because of the high
level from all of our players."
Last Saturday, Sept. 14, Swarthmore lost
4-0 to fifth-rankedLebanon Valley. The Tide

held their own until Lebanon Valley made
three quick strikes in an eight-minute span
22 minutes into the half. After the first half,
the Tide settled down on defense and denied
Lebanon Valley any more goals until
Crystal Davis sneaked in the game's final
score with one second left on the clock.
"We played with poise and skill, but we
just couldn't put it in the cage,"
Athanasiades, who led the Tide with four
shots on goal, said.
Goalkeeper Jenn Hart 'O3, stepping in
for Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3, who was ill,
stopped 14 shots to keep the game within
reach for Swat. "Jenn Hart played hard
against two tough teams, and made a lot of
saves," Wilcox said.
On Tuesday, the Garnet Tide dropped a
game to the College of Notre Dame of
Maryland Gators in double overtime, 1-0.
Although veteran goalkeeper Nelson-Lee
stopped 12 shots to keep the game close, the
Gators broke the scoreless tie when Dianna
Abramowski scored the game-winning goal
on a penalty corner 2:06 into the second
overtime period. "We had nice breaks but
we didn't complete our chances,"
Athanasiades said.
After the game, Coach Wilcox was
happy with her team's play. "We were
playing really comfortable and making
smart choices."
"Both teams played extremely well. In
the end, they had a great shot. It was down
to luck in the end," Heidi Fieselmann 'O6

added.
The team is hoping the high level of play
from these opponents will prepare
Swarthmore for this weekend's Seven
Sisters Tournament. In particular, the
team is looking forward to avenging last
year's loss to Wellesley in the championship game.
"We have a great rivalry with
Wellesley," Athanasiades said.

The way you wear your hat: Tradition,
ritual and superstition in Swat sports
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

rburstel@swarthmore.edu
For some it is a body twitch, for some a special diet, and
for still others it is the deliberate fashion faux pas. But for
all, it is a belief that adhering to a ritual will translate into
athletic success
or at least that a lapse in attention to
minutiae cannot be blamed for a defeat. It is in the realm
of professional athletics that such superstitions are most
publicized, but some of the strangest and most prevalent
seem to have developed even before the advent of the
sports superstar.
Long before it was apparent to the viewer that Michael
Jordan was indeed wearing his college basketball shorts
under his professional uniform, basketball players were
fighting over who would get the last basket in practice
because it was believed that success during warm-ups
would translate into success during games. And long before
Nomar Garciapparabegan his at-bat toe-tapping routine, it
was considered bad luck, and poor form besides, to mention
the prospect of a no-hitter while it was happening.
From baseball's unwritten rules for acceptable fan
behavior to the truly elaborate routines constructed by
athletes in order to ensure their success, no sport is
immune from its share of superstitious activities, traditional team bonding behaviors and sacred rituals perceived as age-old. Certainly, athletes at Swarthmore and
the athletic teams to which they belong are no different
from Wade Boggs (who consumed only chicken on game

or legendary Tigers pitcher Mark Fidrych (who
spoke to his baseball, imploring it to do his will).
Some rituals, like a cross-country team member's near
inhalation of a plate of pasta on the night before a meet,
are logical. Some repeated practices, like the chant used by
the women's swim team prior to Centennial Conference
meets, make less sense. But some would argue that the
chant
"T (clap, clap), T-R-U (whoo, whoo, whoo), T-R-UC-K, Swat is truckin' all the way!"
though silly-sounding
to members of the mere public, has itself been instrumental in helping the women's swimming team achieve two
straight Centennial Conference championships." Equally if
not more bizarre, but no less effective, may be the men's
ultimate frisbee team's use of a homage to well executed
plays, followed by the non-sequitur, "Eat the babies."
The more logical among us might argue that the feat of
an ultimate win was unrelated to the cheer's introduction.
The quirky habits of Swarthmore's student-athletes and
their relation to how the teams have fared, however, have
rarely been relegated to the realm of mere coincidence.
Beth Redden 'O5, a cross-country runner, admits that
she likes "to listen to Whitney Houston's 'One Moment in
Time' the night before races" because she associates it with
her first high-school soccer goal. "I like to think it brings
me luck even though the song itself sucks," Redden said.
Sarah Hobbs 'O6, a soccer player, engages in a similarly
strange ritual, wearing maroon athletic tape on game days.

match. James Zvokel 'O4, a pitcher for the baseball team, is
known campus-wide for shaving prior to games. A lesserknown ritual that Zvokel performs involves carrying a
bracelet in his pocket during games. "I've been wearing
the bracelet for three years, and I take it off for games," he
said. "I only do well if it's in my pocket."
But beyond the eccentricities of individuals driven to
quirkiness by a desire to win, teams themselves can contribute folkloric practices. According to Eric Levy 'O4, the
men's ultimate frisbee team engages in huddles of neartribal proportions, by "circling around the disk."
The women's basketball team does "specific cheers in
specific spots on the floor," co-captain Ali Furman 'O3 said.
Revealing the importance such repetitious pregame procedures have for team morale, Furman commented that "it
wouldn't be right" if the basketball players didn't have
such a complicated cheering protocol. Furman has taken a
better-safe-than-sorry approach, acknowledging that while
the ritual itself may not impact the results of the game, its
absence might adversely affect play.
Swarthmore's athletic teams may not be professional,
but the quality of their quirkiness rivals Phillies' pitcher
Turk Wendell's between-inning tooth-brushing bouts and
Bob Knight's plaid jacket. These gestures, from the obsessive search for the right ball to a concern for the physical
placement of players during a rallying cry, may seem neurotic to the casual observer. But to the players themselves
they seem to represent something larger. And even if they
don't, they certainly make athletics livelier.

My venture

into nirvana

Ele Forbes squares off against two Delaware Valley defenders during last Saturday's game. Forbes and
teammate Shavaugn Lewis lead the Garnet Tide in goals, and Forbes is second on the squad in points.

After 4-1 start, Garnet Tide
drop consecutive matches
BY DEBBIE FARRELLY

dfarrell@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's soccer team has a
motivational theme for the 2002 season: "Over the
Top." With this theme in mind, the team aims to
bring an end to 10 years of losing seasons. The
Garnet Tide continue to adhere to this motto after a
week of challenging games.
"This is the season we want to make an impression on the Centennial Conference that we are for
real and that we deserve more respect than what
has been given to us in the past," Catherine
Salussolia 'O6 said. '"Over the Top' means coming
together as a team, winning the respect of others,
and enjoying the game we love."
The Garnet, who began the season with a promising 4-1 start, dropped consecutive games this week
against Delaware Valley College and Richard
Stockton College. "Our record is 4-3, which is technically 'Over the Top,'" Sarah Hobbs 'O6 explained.
"But we are working hard to have the strongest
record that we can by the end of this season."
On Saturday, the Garnet women faced a very talented Delaware Valley squad. Throughout the first
half, Swarthmore dominated the offense, out-shooting the Aggies by a large margin. Aggressive play by
Shavaugn Lewis 'O5, Tanya Hahnel 'O5, Hobbs and
Corey Pilver 'O3 created many scoring opportuni-

ties, but the squad just could not convert those
chances into goals. "We played hard individually
and had some scoring opportunities, particularly in
the beginning, that we did not capitalize on," head
coach Amy Brunner said.
Delaware Valley came to life after the break,
scoring the first goal of the game only three minutes
into the second half. Swarthmore answered soon
after when Hahnel found Claire Hoverman 'O3 in the
right crease to tie the game at one. Ana Mecaj's goal
four minutes later returned the lead to Delaware

Valley. Swarthmore struggled in the remaining minutes of the second half to keep the ball on the offensive side, and a goal from Delaware Valley's Katie
Leach with two minutes remaining ensured the 3-1
victory for her team.
Monday's away game against powerhouse
Richard Stockton College, ranked 4th in the region
and 22nd in the nation last week, was an incredible
feat and. a growing opportunity for the Garnet Tide
despite the 2-0 loss.
Before the game, the team was excited about the
ensuing matchup with Richard Stockton, a team
that has lost only one game in the season so far. "It
was a great way to see where we are as a team,"
Brunner said. "It was our litmus test to see how
we'd stack up to the top of our conference." In the
first half, Swarthmore equaled Richard Stockton's
aggressive and skilled play, and neither team
scored. In the second half, the scoreless combat continued until the 72nd minute, when a head ball from
Stockton's Dawn Belamarich passed through the

Swarthmore goalposts.
With four minutes remaining, a second Richard
Stockton goal locked up the win. "It was a great
game, the best of the season. It shows that we can
play with the top teams in our conference," Brunner
said.
"We don't consider the game against Richard
Stockton to be a loss," Hobbs explained. "In the
records it is a loss, but for our team, it was a huge
victory. We took just as much from that game as we
would have had we won."
Women's soccer will host Goucher College this
Saturday at 12 p.m. before heading to Franklin and
Marshall next Wednesday, Sept. 25.
Salussolia and the rest of the team are prepared.
"To be successful in our upcoming games, we need
to continue to play how we did against Stockton,"
she said. "We need to communicate, transition well,
and most importantly, enjoy what we're doing."

The road to State College, Pa., is long and winding. It twists and
turns through the valleys and over the mountains that make up the
landscape of central Pennsylvania. Most of the journey is across
rural terrain, with little more to look at than trees and orange construction signs. In short, a journey that takes 3 1/2 hours without
traffic can seem like an eternity.
This makes sense of course, since
Penn State University might as well
be on another planet when compared
to Swarthmore. The two schools
have roughly one thing in common:
they are both institutes of higher
learning. After that, most anyone
would struggle to find similarities.
The students of State College run
around on the streets until the wee
hours of the morning, hopping from
bar to bar, avoiding the overzealous
and abundant town police, and generally shirking any and all academic
responsibilities. The excitement
JOSH LOEFFLER
over a football game begins roughly
as soon as the last game ends, the
Riding the Pine
school lives and dies with the team,
and students regularly place bets on
the outcome of the games.
As you can see, the differences are many and large. This
Swarthmore student found himself in some kind of beautiful culture
shock. I was a little confused and felt a little out of place, but walked
down the main street soaking in the scene.
My trip began on Friday evening; I arrived at State College
around nine. The hype surrounding the next day's game with
Nebraska was immediately evident. My companion Spoon began
asking the going price for a ticket to the game. The answer: $BO to
$lOO for a ticket that a student originally buys for $l5. Clearly, this
was no normal game.
After a night of preparation for the game, our crew awoke at
noon and began preparing once again. Wiffle ball, a keg, a PSU bar
concoction called a Monkeyboy (flavor: bongwater), and a full day
of college football had our group of Lions fans in a veritable frenzy
for the game.
The walk to Beaver Stadium was a 20-minute pep talk for us
fans, as we all tried to convince ourselves that this game was PSU's
for the taking. We headed out telling each other, "Sure, Nebraska
is ranked higher, but they're not that good." Eventually we talked
ourselves into believing that the experts were wrong; Penn State

would certainly win.
Upon arrival at the stadium, we were greeted by teeming hordes
of fans, all foaming at the mouth, screaming cheers and deriding
Nebraska. Some were painted, while others wore shirts that
screamed, "Huck the Fuskers." Most were drunk, or certainly
seemed to be.
The line was more of a mob; it surged forward, ready to break
into the stadium and will the team to victory. As we got to the ticket booth, Spoon leaned over and explained that the ticket taker was
a "friend." A ticket for a fifth row seat was then placed in my
hands, and I immediately shed a single tear. It was like I had been
told that I could drive the '9l Honda Accord to prom, and then

stumbled onto a new Porsche.
The inside of the stadium was at the very least overwhelming.
The edifice was enormous, the sheer size of the building enough to
make me feel miniscule. We shuffled down the steps, past thousands of envious fans, to our prized seats. Of course, the term
"seat" is nominal. No one sits for the entire game; this produces a
terrific effect, intimidating to the opponent, but is also a bit rough
on the knees.
I wished to jump off the bleachers and run onto the perfectly
manicured field. I had a nearly irresistible urge to run and live out
my childhood athletic fantasies. I settled for screaming until I
became hoarse. The players materialized out of the tunneland the
110,775 fans roared like a storm. Never before have these ears heard
such noise. Of course, that would all change when the game began.
For as the Nittany Lions began to utterly dominate the Huskers, the
roar grew even louder, to the point that the sound filled every inch*
of my body and sent chills down my spine.
The game was sheer nirvana. As play after great play was made
by my beloved PSU, a feeling of joy spread through me, and a funny
thing happened. As the cheers of "We are Penn State" echoed back
and forth through the stadium, something hit me. I realized that at
that moment, even though I was from a school none of these kids
seemed to have ever heard of, I was indeed Penn State, too.

Long's two goals lift Tide
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
With the much-anticipated Centennial
Conference portion of their schedule fast
approaching, the Garnet Tide improved
kJto a cool 4-2 record after splitting their
last two games against non-conference

competition.
On Saturday, the Tide overcame a sluggish first half to prevail over Lincoln
University, 2-1. A pair of Scott Long 'O6
goals combined with a relentless secondhalf attack proved to be the difference. In
their match against Baptist Bible College
last Wednesday, the Garnet fell in double
overtime, 4-3. They showed flashes of
resiliency but were ultimately outlasted
by the less talented but seemingly hungrier Baptist Bible squad. Fortunately, the
Tide were able to rebound in the second
half of Saturday's game against Lincoln to
avoid dropping a second straight game,
--sand to continue to build upon their early
success.

In the match versus Lincoln, the Tide
had faced "by far, the most athletic team
we've seen all year," noted Reuben
Heyman-Kantor 'O6, the game's winning
keeper. "They were faster and stronger
than we were physically, but in terms of
both soccer skill and organization, we
were clearly superior," he added.
Throughout the entire first half, the
Lions of Lincoln University were all over
the field, aggressively tackling and frustrating the Tide. Lincoln jumped out to an
early 1-0 lead 17:30 into the game, and it
remained that way heading into the half.
The Garnet fulfilled the cliche that
"it's not how you start, but how you fin'*-ish," putting their first-half ineffectiveness behind them and winning the game
in the second half. Freshman midfielder

Scott Long scored his first career goal on
a header off of a Cam MacDearmid 'O3

....

free kick at 52:30 to knot the game at 1-1.
Then just 3:40 later, off an indirect kick,
Long blasted a shot through a Lion defensive wall to score the game winner from
six yards out.
The freshman midfielder commented on
his scoring opportunities. "For the first
goal I sat myself a couple of steps off the offside line Lincoln was holding, waiting for a
ball over the top that I could get my head
on," Long said. "Cam served a ball where I
needed it and I got up before the goalie and
.headed it in. After we got the call that gave
us a free kick six yards from the goal, I got
opportunistic and got myself in position to
take the shot. Charlie put a touch on it and
I basically gunned it between the wall."
After, getting outshot 8-5 in the first half,
the Garnet controlled the tempo of the
game in the second half, outshooting the
Lions 13-6. Long was able to spark some
intensity in the club, teaming with Paul

the team's instant success. "At half time

on his coaching philosophy: "As the leader
of the team, I have set the goal of establishing a strong work ethic, a detail-oriented routine, and a thoughtful, intelligent style of play for the team. It is important for me to set the tone in training that

where I am coming from.

Note

•Prior to last Wednesday's game
against Baptist Bible College, the Tide
hosted a ceremony honoring the one-year
anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, and those
who lost their lives in the terrorist attacks
last year. Wagner led the ceremony and

recognized the Swarthmore Fire and
Protective Association and all those who
suffered in the attacks. The observance

also featured a speech by ChiefEd Kline of
the Swarthmore Fire and Protection
Association, which recognized its connection to and cooperation with the College.

Kline also emphasized the fact that there
are many members of the Swarthmore
community who serve as volunteers and
should be honored.
