Honors Reforms
Attract Sophs
Close to 30% of Sophomores Plan
to Apply for New Honors Program
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl
and Tara Zahra

Nearly 30% of this year's sophomores plan to apply for the Honors
program next year, according to Registrar Jane Mullins.

The figure, based on students'
sophomore papers, is substantially
higher than the 17.5% of current seniors who said as sophomores that
they planned to participate in Honors. Almost all of those students followed through on theirHonors plans:
13% of seniors are still enrolled in
the program.
"All of us who worked on therevisions [to the program] are very
pleased that they appear to have encouraged more students to apply for
Honors," said Provost JennieKeith.
But Keith and Mullins warned that
Honors participation in the Class of
1997 could change in the next two
years. Approximately 30 sophomores
have yet to submit their sophomore
papers, and students could change
their minds between now and next
spring, when they must formally apply to enroll in Honors. In addition,
some students who apply for Honors
may not be accepted.

"It's difficultto estimate what will
be the actual proportion of the Class
of '97 who will graduate with Honors," Keith explained. "I think that

Ah, The Beach in March

Suzanna Brauer '95, Josh Sperry '95, Mary Wittenburg '9B, and Laura Perry '95 relaxed under the warm sun on
Parrish Beach as 70-degree temperatures hit Swarthmore this week. All week few books were in evidence on the

could not enjoy the weather because they had to stay inside and study for upcoming Honors exams.

Council Debates Who Will
Ratify New Constitution
Vote Could be Postponed Until End
By Phil Spector

The Student Council Constitution
Committee is struggling with the issue of whether the proposed constitution should be submitted to the
entire student body for ratification,
according to committteemember Jen
Hayoun '97.
Some SC members are concerned
that students may not bother to read,
theentire proposal, and so wouldnot
be able to make an informed decision. One possibility is to postpone
the vote until spring elections to give
students more time to think about the
draft constitution.
The committee is considering a
variety ofother issues, ranging from
the creation of a Charter Committee
to streamline and facilitate the student organization chartering process,
to the possibility of instituting term
limits for Student Council members.
It is also debating whether to enact
the new rules and regulations retroactively.

The new constitution will provide
guidelines to facilitate council business, structure SC'srelationshipwith
its money-allocating committees—the Budget Committee, the Social
Affairs Committee, and the Forum
for Free Speech— and "act as ashepherd for future councils," said committee Chairman Seth Harvey '97.
Until recently, SC has operated
largely on the basis of precedent,
using an extremely outdated constitution to guide its decisions and procedures.
Newly elected Council members,
led by Mike Pan '97 and others, took
the initiative last semester in laying
down the foundations for a new constitution. The committee, which consists of Harvey and Hayoun along
with fellow SC members Tony
Cheesebrough '97, Justin Herring '97,
and Alisha Pennix '97, has been debating the details ever since.
Hayoun stressed that Student
Council is seeking to create a constitution that is "specific in goals but

of Semester

in methods." For example, fearing the future obsolescence of

not

the committee was
careful not to force future candidates
to post platforms on a Swarthmore
newsgroup. Instead it decided to require candidates' platforms to be
"well advertised."
"We hope to make the document a
concise one that addresses therealities of our present situation, but does
not limit the future councils with
outdated policies," Harvey said.
Copies of the proposed constitution are available on the Student
Council Server, in SC Servers EN
Students—Student Council, or by
contacting committee members.
SC leaders said they are extremely
interested in hearing students' opinions on theconstitution's content and
on the method of ratification. Written comments or suggestions should
be addressed to Harvey. The Constitution Committee will take suggestions, questions and comments
through March 22.

NewsWatcher,

major, said changes in the Honors
program were not a major factor in

his decision to plan to apply for Honors. "I'd have gone Honors either
way," he said. "The new system
changed my plans somewhat but I
was really rather indifferent."
History professor Pieter Judson,
who graduated fromS warthmore with
Highest Honors in 1978, favors most
elements of the Honors reforms.
He feels the Honors program remains attractive because of the opportunity it offers to participate in
seminars. "You'd be crazy not to
have that seminar experience at a
small school like Swarthmore,"
Judson said.
Some students, however, do not
want to participate in Honors precisely because they would have to
take seminars. "I don't think I'm interested in the seminars that are required," said prospective economics
major Amber Thompson '97.
And others said that although the
Honors reforms tried to increase the
program's flexibility, there is still

Rite of Spring: Student
Groups Plan Budgets
By JulieFalk

It's Spring Budgeting time, and
from over 80 student
groups will ga before the Budget
Committee with their proposals this
week and next. Several of the organization treasurers interviewed gave
precisely the same initial response
when asked how they felt about
Spring Budgeting: "It's a pain in the
butt!" But others said it is a necessary
evil.
During Spring Budgeting, treasurers draft budgets for the coming
school year. Proposals must also list
the organization's current budget,
explain how funds were used this
year, and estimate how much money
will be leftover at the end of the year.
Treasurers experienced with Spring
Budgeting said thatformulating new
budgets based on experience from
treasurers

the past year requires expertise as

well as guesswork.
Some treasurers had such negative
feelings about the process that they
were afraid to go on record for fear
that they would hurt their
organization's chances of receiving
its proposed budget. Alec Zimmer
'97, treasurer ofMotherpuckers, said,

"Although I can't think of a more
efficient way to have clubs and organizationsbudgeted, it seems as though
the budgeting process is very timeconsuming and tedious."

Determining how each dollar will
in the next year is especially
difficult for treasurers of organizations who cannot predict the number
of speakers they will bring to
S warthmoreor how many parties they
will throw. One treasurer anonymously remarked, "I know I couldn't
have come up with anything real" for
the budget proposal.

Economics professor Fred Pryor
has taken a six-month leave of absence to work in the Ukraine, according to Mark Kuperberg, acting chairman of the economics department.
Pryor, a specialist in comparative
economic systems, will be a member
of an advisory group on the economic reforms at the Ministry of the
Economy. He will be developing systems to monitor the progress of recently begun economic reforms.
In the fall semester of 1995, Pryor
plans to teach both a course and a

Scott Paper Move
Won't Hurt College

Scott Paper's decision to move its
internationalheadquarters fromDelaware County to Florida should not
substantially affect the College, even
though Scott and its executives were
major donors to Swarthmore in the
past, College officials said.
During the past two years, Scott
faced financial problems andreduced
donations, so the move will not mean
a major loss of funds for the College.
Harry Gotwals, Vice-Presidentfor
Alumni, Development, and Public
Relations, said a greater concern is
the loss of "the leadership [Scott] had
taken with us and others to help the
Chester community."
Several years ago, Scott gave
Swarthmore $125,000 to support the
Swarthmore Foundation and CIVIC,
according to Ellen Wylie, Director of
Foundation and Corporate Relations.
Scott also gave several smaller
grants over the last decade. In 1967,
Thomas B. McCabe 'l5, a chairman
of Scott, provided major funding for
McCabe Library; the Arthur Hoyt
Scott Arboretum is named for a president of Scott Paper who graduated
from Swarthmore in 1895.

Vedanthan Wins
Treasurers Tackle
Marshall Scholarship 1995-1996
Budgets
Senior to Study at Oxford University
By Jon Francis

Last month, Rajesh Vedanthan '95
was named a 1995 Marshall Scholar.
According to associate dean Gil Stott,
theMarshall Scholarship, along with
the Rhodes Scholarship, is one of the
most prestigious awards available.
"In the world of fellowship competition, one would I think place the
Marshall and the Rhodes at the top."
The Marshall Scholarship is
awarded by the British government
to American students who show distinction of intellect and character.
The scholarship covers all costs associated with attending a British university. Up to forty Marshalls are
awarded each year.
Vedanthan is the first S warthmore
student toreceive the MarshallScholarship since Claude Bart '9O. Before
Bart, the most recent winner from
Swarthmore was ChristopherChyba
'B6. Stott emphasized that the low
numbers demonstrate just how selective the scholarship is.
Applicants must first be endorsed
by a dean or president of their college. Then a small number of representatives from each offive U.S. regions are invited for further interview. "Just to be selected for [an]

Just to be selected
for [an] interview is
a big deal.
—Gil Stott
interview," Stott said, "is a big deal."
The final recipients are first chosen from those interviewed, and then
must wait for final acceptance to the
university and academic programs
they select. Vedanthan has been

aware of his selection since Decem-

ber, but he did not receive final approval until late February.

Vedanthan will attend Magdalen
Collegeat Oxford, generally regarded
as one of the most prestigious of the
Oxford Colleges. Stott noted that

I see the program as
a natural link between Swarthmore
and medical school.
—Raj Vendanthan
Magdalen is a very beautiful college
and one of the most attractive British
colleges for tourists. However,
Vedanthan did not mention the campus' aesthetics as one of his primary
criteria for choosing Magdalen.
Applicants for the Marshall Scholarship must propose an academic
"programme." Vedanthanis planning
to study human sciences, which
blends human biology with social
sciences. The program focuses on
the interrelated forces that shape human life. It forms an interdisciplinary major from fields such as genetics, demography, sociological theory,
and urban and social geography.
According to Vedanthan, the program should help develop analytical
skills and concepts that will be of use
in his future career. "I see the program as sort of a natural link between
Swarthmore and medical school. To
be an effective doctor, it will help to
be sensitive to factors that effect
health care delivery."
Vedanthan is looking forward to
the unique experience and he hopes
to be involved in all aspects of life at
Magdalen. "I am really excited about
the opportunity," he said.

Another treasurer had a very serious complaint; his liaison to the
budget committee told him "completely the WTong thing," and he had
to redo his proposal entirely the afternoon before it was due.
Another frequentcomplaint is the
rumor that no matter how much an
organization asks for, the budget
committee will cut its proposal by
$2O or $3O. Nick Lehman '97, treasurer of Ruach commented, "It
seems ridiculous to me that you can
basically counton never getting what
you ask for."
Budget Committee Treasurer

cases where a group receives exactly what they ask for... but we are

job a little easier," she said.
Budgeting is a difficult task for
all involved, and though the committee has been described as extremely conservative financially by

many, but most admit the committee has handled the Student Activi-

Roommate Move In?
From The College Press Service
Worried the dorm housing crunch
will leave you out in the cold? Take
heart all you first-years, maybe Al
Bloom will take you in like the president of Alma College did.
Incoming freshmen Lance Turner
and Paul S waneyhad plans to share a
room at the small college in Alma,
MI, but "when we didn't hear anything from Alma, we started to get a
little worried," said Turner.
It turns out the college enrolled a
record number of students and had a
temporary housing shortage on its
hands. Turner and Swaney were two
of the many incoming students who
had yet to receive information on
where they would be living because
school officials were still trying to
figure it out themselves.
"We finally heard that we'd be
split up and that we'd each have to

share a room with an R.A.," said
Swaney. "It wasn't exactly what we
wanted to hear.

The

two agreed to

take some temhousing together and wait for
an opening rather than split up. "Living with your R. A. isn't part of your
typical college experience, especially
for a freshman," said Turner. "We
wanted to see if they could come up
with a better offer."
Alma College did.
Turner and Swaney spent the first
porary

three weeks of their college careers
living with Alma President Alan
Stone and his wife, Jonieta, in their
home.
"When they first said it, I laughed,"
said Turner. "I figured they'd find us
a bed somewhere, but not in the

president's house."
The two didn'tknow what to expect, but when Turner and Swaney
pulled up in front of the president's
house justacross the street from campus, they found an eight bedroom
house where they had an entire floor
to themselves.
Living in such posh accommodations took some time to get adjusted
to. "I came home from class the first
day, and there was this woman cleaning my bathroom, said Swaney upon

finding they had twice-a-week maid
service."It was like living in ahotel."
The two freshmen said the living
arrangement was not nearly as awkward as other students would think.
"It was a lot like your typical parentchildrenrelationship, saidTurner. "At
night, they'd do the 'how was your
day' kind of thing, and we'd tell

them. They were really great."
They often shot pool with Presi-

dent Stone, but despite the sweet life,
they looked forward to getting a regular dorm room. "The set-up was great,
but we felt like we were kind of

isolated from the rest of campus,"
said Turner.
Now that they have moved into
their own room, they are stillreaping
the benefits of being on a first-name
basis with the college's president.
"We were going to class the other day
and [President Stone] pulls over in
his car and asks us to come over play
some pool that night," said Turner.

Historian Compares Patriarchy
and Colonial Government
U. Venn Professor Kicks
By Matt Hellman

In a lecture Tuesday, feminist historian Carroll Smith-Rosenberg offered excerpts from colonial magazines as evidence that in many ways
theFederalists' vision of government
paralleled late 18th-centurypositions
on gender relations.
Starting with the Federalist belief
that the ideal representative should
have a level of education and breeding superior to that of his constituents, Rosenberg, a professor of history and psychiatry at the University
of Pennsylvania, proceeded to show
how that relationship was framed in
terms similar to the one between men
and women at the time.
Her first point was that the idea of

"public servant" was completely
misleading. In reality, Rosenberg
maintained, it was the citizen who
was servile to the politically powerful representative.
To demonstrate this, she quoted
many of the writings ofnotedFederalist and dictionary publisher Noah
Webster. Webster, who wrotefor elite
colonial urban magazines, would in

of the statesman, arguing that since

reserved for the people."
Rosenberg proceeded to link this
concept of the superior, masculine
legislature, to the passive, feminine
electorate, and then to the colonial
ideal of the authoritative husband and
docile wife.

During the question and answer
session which followed her talk,
Rosenberg was asked if this com-

parison between government and
marriage was merely symbolic, or if
Federalists had explicitly used antifeminist language in their political
discourses. In response, shecitedhow

Swat Philosophers
and Sociologist
Debate Value of
Tolerance
By Erik Huneke
Darrell Moore, visiting instructor
of philosophy, and Braulio Munoz,
professor of sociology, presented
papers critiquing the value of "tolerance" as a social virtue in a symposium Wednesday funded by a Mellon
Foundation grant.Hans Oberdiek, a
professor ofphilosophy who has also

written about the subject of tolerdiscussion.
About2s listeners, firstheard about
Moore's "simultaneous attraction and
repulsion towards tolerance," specifically as it refers to the
conceptualization of an aesthetic in
African-American art and the portrayal of the African-American male
in film. Moore believes that "concerns of representation of truth,
knowledge, and justice" are not incompatible with forms of visual art,
and that the merging of the Black
Arts and Black Power movements
has enhanced African-American selfance, moderated the

determination by defining the
"boundaries ofblack nationhood and

subjectivity."
Yet critics see
film as an art form
which "fails to resist commodification" and thus
tends to reduce the
black to thelevel of
consumer. There is
also an anxiety
about the long history of visual portrayal of African
Americans in slave
auctions, urban dis-

Fiction, then it becomes acceptable
for the white character to use the
word "nigger."

Moore used these examples todemonstrate his contention that"the problem of modernity is in fact the anxiety of difference"and that "tolerance
is predicated upon not interrogating
that moment of anxiety...and on
people who occupy the norm at that
particular moment."
Munoz was also skeptical about
the notion of tolerance. Individually,
he does not necessarily dispute its

value: "If we conceive social relations in terms of porcupines and teddy
bears, I admit that I would rather be a
teddy bear." In other situations, however, he "cannot embraceliberalism"
because he believes that sometimes
one "display [s] virtue" by being intolerant.

The liberal v iew is that "we exhibit
virtue when we display tolerance"
toward practices and beliefs that are
different from our own. This view
also contends that only individauls
exercising rational thought can be
consideredtolerant, and hence,

virtuous. In order to be tolerant, "we must
see ourselves as

enlightened, and
thus superior to
those whom we
tolerate," who
can thus never
live up to our
expectations and
be among those
who are allowed
to display the

role that its view of tolerance has
played in excluding certain groups

our commonwealth."

Munoz also mentioned other cri-

tiques of liberalism, which include

the view of"the bourgeois individual

[as] a flawed historical product," because "in making the individual the
cornerstone of morality, we forget
that the individual is nothing without
the community." Another critique has
come from those "on the fringes of

liberalism" who find its doctrines
"constraining" and thus decide that
"most things and ways of being are
worthy of toleration."This result in
equating the rights of pets with those
of pregnant women. The focus on the
individual also warrants caution in a
narcissistic society in which morality might be based upon the satisfaction of personal needs and desires.

Opinions

Speaking Outside Swarthmore Unequal Privileges
Today, an all-campus Collection will discuss hate
speech at Swarthmore. While hate speech on this campus does threaten usall, it is important to remember that,
compared to the rest of the world, Swarthmore's offenses are minor. Out there, hate speech is much more
drastic.
On Monday, March 13, the New York Times ran an
article entitled "Hate Groups Use Tools of Electronic
Trade," about today's whitesupremacy movement News
like this reminds us that
multiculturalism is not as popular as
we at Swarthmore tend to think. It
may also cause us to question our
concept of a multicultural society.
The article describes Resistance
Inc., "a Detroit-based media company that markets white separatism. .." and quotes an expert as saying that it represents "a new model
for purveying hate" through various
mediamodes, especially the Internet.
New technology is allowing the
movementtoreach more people than

ever before.
The most striking part of the article is the following quote from the
group's leader, GeorgeBurdi: "I do hate. I hate what is
happening to my people, white people. I hate the fact that
we forgot the laws of nature. The laws of nature dictate
that you must look after your own kind. The laws of
nature dictate that any living thing that becomes apathetic to its own fate will perish."
It disgusts me even to type that quote into this article.
But this is what hate speechreally is. The man who said
that is an old-fashioned bigot.

People like this man pose a threat to our society. In
response, we are called to ask the question, how does
our Hate Speech Collection relate to this man.
On our campus, we are very careful about issues of
ethnicity, race, gender, and sexual orientation. Today's
Collection will doubtlessly embrace multicultural diversity, and will attempt to bring about justice for all
groups. This is good, for Swarthmore.
But this is not how it is in the
rest of the world. Beyond the
shelter of Academia, the concepts of political correctness
(there's that catchword) and
multiculturalism are not in
vogue. Beyond this campus,
people use the words "girl" and
"freshman," and ones much
worse. The George Burdis of
the world, who have access to
money and power, do not care
that Academia is embracing
ideas of political correctness.
I am not claiming that hate
speech does not exist at Swarthmore, and I am not trying to
discredit our discourse. What I
am saying, though, is that the general concept of
multiculturalrelations held at Swarthmore is unrealistic.The attempt to achieve harmony, however difficult
it may prove, is a luxury of our cloistered community.
When we graduate and go "out there," therules will be
completely different. I hope that when we get there, we
will find ourselves able to cope with the fierce climate.
Maybe we can even help to heal it.

Letters to the Editor
In Defense

of
Affirmative Action
To
the Editor:

In her March 2 editorial, "Moving
Beyond Affirmative Action," Tamar
Charry argues against affirmative action programs which pursue a course
of reverse discrimination, which she
claims uses two wrongs to make a
right, replacing "hate with hate."
Charry's argument stems from her
thwarted pursuit of a job with the
Associated Press, where she wasn't
even able to submit an application
due to its hiring policy of"the Black,
Hispanic, Native American, and
Asian ethnic groups." Yet, does affirmative action in theory or practice
actually replace hate with hate? My
understanding of affirmative action
programs is that they recognize that
minorities have been deprived of
opportunities throughout our
country's history and continue to be
deprived today, but also acknowledge and challenge the privileges
whites enjoy due to their skin color.
The myth of the American Dream,
that anyone can "succeed" in the
United States if they are willing to
work hard, has been so widely attacked (especially at a college like
Swarthmore) thatitmay seem trite to

conjure it up for another flogging.
However, the buoyancy with which
it floats into so many of our debates
is indicative of its prevalence. I am
more or less willing to concede that

the American Dream is alive and has
always existed as a tenetof our country, as long as it is understood that it
has only existed for whites.
Implicit within Charry's analysis
of affirmative action is a belief that
we are living in a meritocracy, and to
close the door of opportunity on her
before sheis even given thechance to
prove herself flies in the face of what
America is supposedly all about. But
whites, and in particular, white men
have always been the recipients of a
variety of forms of affirmative action, all of which are predicated on
the denial of these very same opportunities to non-whites. As Roger
Wilkins writes in this week's The
Nation, 'The idea of affirmative action is not to force people into positions for which they are unqualified
but to encourage institutions to develop realistic criteria for the enterprise at hand and then to find a reasonable diverse mix of people qualified to be engaged in it." In fact, it's
not as if we've been overrun by the
fruits of affirmative action atSwarthmore. As a friend pointed out to me,
how many minority, and specifically
African-American, professors can
you name?
Affirmative action is important to
me because no matter how flawed it
may be, it is a societal attempt at
racial justice. So when Charry writes,

"racism persists regardless of mandates and regulations," and thus we
should scrap affirmative action programs, claiming that the only path

"to reverse the injustice is to stop it at
its source—the individual."l see this
as not only an ineffectual move, but
as an immeasurably regressive one
as well. This seems to be a laissezfaire approach to social change; nothing more than the logic of
Reaganomics superimposed on race,
where one's enlightened individual
attitudes and actions concerning racial injustice will trickle down to
other individuals and then Eureka!
we'll be on a cruise ship heading
towards destination Racial Equality.
Whenhave people voluntarily forsaken positions of power and the
privileges associated with it? The
main reason minorities have begun
to enjoy positions of power is not
because whites changed their attitudes, but because a group of African-Americans forced society to
change. Affirmative action comes
directly from this process.
I do not mean to make light of
Charry's frustration over being refused the chance to prove herself
(and as an imminent graduate I may
certainly face the same prospect), but
I also want to see more positions
(whether it's journalists or administrators, to name two) occupied in this
country in a way that more accurately
reflect America. WhileCharry or any
white person in her position may have
experienced sight-unseen rejection, I
do not see this as reverse discrimination that "deprive[s] other groups"
like whites.
Moving beyond the individual, I
do not think of this as deprivation at
all, since it is a step towards a more
of victimhood, where after well over
300 years, itis suddenly'whites' turn.
Like the debate over welfare reform
or illegal aliens, affirmative action is
about how we conceive of America.
And in my vision, America isn't a
place seeking to discriminate against
whites because they are white. On
the contrary, it is a place trying to
rectify the ills bom from an entire
history of privilege which has been
dependent upon the denial of power
to other groups. Nothing about this
process is easy. Affirmative action
isn't without flaws. But it is necessary.

Wanted: Intern to Build Home in Beautiful Maine
Swat alum Ben Fulves 'B7 has
undertaken to establish Heartwood
builders, a construction company in
Bar Harbor, Maine.Fulves has moved
from New York City in a career
change from publishing.
"Building on the coast of Maine
puts houses up against all sorts of
extreme weather conditions: galeforce winds, subzero temperatures,
snow loads on roof systems," says
Fulves."lfyou don't build themright,
they won't stand up. Building ahouse
nowadays involves more than just
cutting wood and nailing it together.

We incorporate a design philosophy
that takes into account people's
lifestyles."
Fulves also acknowledges that
some aspects of construction are not
as pristine as the surrounding environment. There are advantages to it,
though. "The decreasing supply of
old-growth lumber means that we're
using more manufactured materials,"
he says. "Insteadof limiting us... these
new products expand the range of
what we can do. They're stronger,
more flexible, more efficient, and
sometimes less expensive. It opens

up a wholerange of possibilities."
The company is looking for a fulltime intern to help build their current
project, a 2700 foot custom house.
No prior experience is required.
The intern will be involved in every stage of the process, "frompouring the foundation toroofing, as well
as rough framing, drywall, ceramic
tile work, and trim carpentry."
Construction will extend from May
15 through November 15, 1995.
Heartwood is looking for someone to
work for the entire period, or else for

summer and one to work during the
fall. The position is unpaid, but the
company offers help securing housing and paid work in Bar Harbor.

Tenure: How the
decisions were made
By Erika Baumgartner
Last month, several members of the
Swarthmore faculty were awarded tenure. All
of them are sixth year professors who just
underwent a semester-long process of evaluation. We are all aware of the tension that rises
every time faculty members are up for tenure.
But just what does the process involve? How
does the evaluation procedure run?
All departments use the procedure
described in the Faculty Handbook for evaluating and granting tenure. Faculty members
hired onto the Swarthmore tenure track are
eligible for tenure after their sixth year.
Evaluations start at the departmental level
with the compilation of a dossier on each candidate. The department makes a recommendation based on the dossier to the Committee
on Promotion and Tenure. The committee
reviews the dossier and makes a recommendation to the Board of Managers, which
makes the final decision of whether the candidate is granted tenure.
Michael Marrisen of the Department of
Music and Dance, who was recently awarded
tenure, has "the impression that the [tenure
evaluation] process at Swarthmore is, in terms
of student and faculty input, much more thorough then at many institutions... The amount
of input that the tenure process here demands
is part of Swarthmore's focus on professors'
corroboration with other departments and a
general commitment to community."
Part of what makes this process so intensive is the amount of input involved. The
dossier ofeach candidate's work compiled by
the department includes at least 25 letters
from students, letters from faculty members
both inside and outside the department and
evaluations from experts in the candidate's
field as well as the published research of the
candidate. The candidate chooses half of the
letter writers outside of their department and
the committee chooses the other half. The
knowledge that these evaluations are being
conducted can produce the feeling of someone watching over your shoulder. Ellen Ross
of the Religion Department, another recent
recipient of tenure, said that there is a "definite sense of being evaluated. There are certain points at which people ask about the
process. It's an ever present thing, though not
the first thing on your mind."
On the basis of the dossier, the department
makes a recommendation to the Committee
on Promotion and Tenure, which includes
four faculty members, the Provost and the
President of the College. They evaluate the
dossier and make a recommendation to the
Board of Directors, who make the final decision as to whether or not the candidate is
granted tenure.
Tenure is granted to "protect the freedom
and integrity of teaching and learning, to fos-

scholarship in a context of personal and
professional development, and recognize the
special responsibility [faculty has for the welter

fare of the college]." as the Faculty Handbook
states. Tenure protects a professor's right to
academic freedom by providing job security.
Academic freedom is the freedom of scholars
to teach, conduct and publish research, as
long as they do it honestly, accurately and
without bias.
Publication is one of the prerequisites of
tenure. In different fields, what is considered
research and publication varies. Books are the
usual in the Humanities, in the Sciences, articles in professional journals are the norm.
Faculty on the tenure track is given their
fourth year's semester of leave with the feeling that, as Ross explained, the college wants
faculty to work on publication and research
but that they should never draw attention
away from teaching. Marrisen commented
that "There is less institutionalfocus here on
quantity of publication and more on quality.
In other words, what is done must be done
well. There is a large concern for scholarship." He also expressed the impression that,
though research and publication are extremely important, Swarthmore places a lot of
emphasis on skillful teachers who have the
ability to convey thought effectively rather
than on "grant getters."
The system of tenure that American colleges go by is one that was set up by the 1940
Statement of Principles of Academic
Freedom and Tenure, written by the
American Association of University
Professors. It states that academic freedom is
the right of every professor in higher education. The terms and conditions of an appointment to faculty must be stated in writing, and
before a professor receives tenure he or she is
entitled to full academic freedom and the
same rights as a tenured position. The maximum probationary period for a faculty mem-

has been approved for
dismissed only with full
academic due process, which includes a hearing and consideration by both a faculty committee and the governing board of the institution. The teacher must be informed in writing
of the charges against him/her before the hearing, and be allowed to create their defense.
Adequate cause for the dismissal of a tenured
professor includes demonstrated incompetence, dishonesty, neglect of duty and personal
conduct that prevents the professor from fulfilling duty.
The evaluation system at Swarthmore was
deemed extremely fair by both Ross and
Marrisen. Ross gave Provost Jennie Keith credit for clarifying the process in the past few
years, making things easier for all faculty members involved. She did wonder about the

dossier's emphasis on evaluation from others
without much opportunity for self evaluation,
saying that "I wouldn't have minded being able
to write something about my vision and work
and what they mean about my academic profile
and scholarly commitment." She also felt that
course syllabi were not an encouraged part of
the dossier and that they should be included
because they would show evaluators the
breadth of what professors do in the classroom.
The Faculty handbook describes the tenure
decision as "ultimately an integral decision
about performance and potentiality in which a
comprehensive judgement is likely to account
to more than simple addition of separate specific aspects of performance, despite its dependence upon their appraisal." Both research and
teaching ability factor strongly in the decision
to grant a professor tenure, with the feeling of
a focus on a learning community and communication of ideas. As Ross says, "It's a small
school really committed to teaching... the evaluation is one that reflects that commitment to
the 'spirit' of Swarthmore."

unusual plan: instead of adhering to the tradi-

By Matt Kutolowski
For an hour and a half this Friday and
Saturday nights, Paces will become a theater.
All seating is already reserved for the performance of two plays produced by Swarthmore
students. The works, Moderato Cantabile, and
Memoire d'une Amnesique are not conventional plays. Rather, they are novels adapted
for the stage by seniors Claire Lecomte du
Nouy and Dawn Cardace.
Both French majors, Lecomte du Nouy and
Cardace have used innovation in their projects
from their inception. Last semester, amidst
speculation over the senior comprehensive
examinations and paper required by their
department, the two students proposed an

tional requirements, why not write and direct
a play in French?
The French department soon gave them the
green light to produce the alternative plays,
the first of their kind at Swarthmore. Eager to
integrate their enjoyment of theater with the
academic sphere outside the classroom,
Lecomte du Nouy and Cardace began casting
for their project during the second week following the winter break.
For Lecomte du Nouy, her play Moderato
Cantabile a terms taken from music, meanis based on a
ing "moderated singing"
novel by the same title, by Marguerite Duras.
However, to appreciate the performance, anyone not familiar with the novel first should to
realize that Lecomte du Nouy has contributed
substantially to the interpretation.
The first of the evenings' performances,
Lecomte du Nouy's work reflects various
painstaking procedures. In order to ensure
originality, Claire first retyped the entire novel's dialogue. With excisions complete,
"about 50% of the pure raw dialogue
remained," which, she said, was, "an acceptable compromise to adapting the entire text."
While no additions were made to the dialogue, she encouraged innovative performance by refusing to present the actors with a
context. Meaning

and movements evolved

through interpretation by both actors and
director, allowing "an equal input of opinion,"
according to Lecomte du Nouy.
Cardace's adaptation is drawn from the
novel by Haitian author J.J. Dominique,
Memoire d'une Amnesique, translated as
"memory (or diary) of an amnesiac." "The
book is written as a 'collage* in that it switches narrative voices frequently," remarked
Cardace. "Less conventional" than Lecomte
du Nouy's play,- Cardace's adaptation
involves only two actors and two drummers.
The two actresses, Catherine Laine '9B and
Christine Poreba '97, remain "each distinct,
yet present two sides of the one character,"

stated Cardace. At times, though, the two
women's voices speak in unison, mirroring
the character's complementary sides.

Referring

to

Cardace's challenging selec-

tion, Poreba realizes that "being in this play
has made me think about what a play really
is...l've just begun wondering why I've been
keeping my definition of 'phiy' so strict."
Cardace's play focuses on various themes,
including the development of a young woman
and a commentary on political circumstances
in Haiti since 1957, when basic political tenets
were radically redefined.

More traditional in its presentation as well
as text, Lecomte du Nouy's piece is "not quite
a love story," for it plays with what she
describes as "the similarity of l'amor, love,
and la mort, death."

The director's adaptation consciously disthis ostensibly clear distinction between
life, love, and death. The play shows the
degeneration of a married woman, played by
Carolyn Harris '95. The character's deterioration raise questions about what it really means
to "live" life.
The play promises to deliver quick changes
and telling actions. In addition to providing a
juxtaposition of love and death, Lecomte du
Nouy considers her current adaptation to be
"very erotic... with a lot of alcohol, odors,
flowers, and progressive touching."
Mike Dixon '95, playing the male lead
Chauvin, echoes Lecomte du Nouy's attention
to issues of interpretation, playfully saying: "I
mistrust the author. She's quite vague, allowing many interpretations... so I keep it vague,
not projecting too much of my own reading."
For both directors, the demands of directing
their plays surpasses the rigors entailed with
the traditional senior examinations. "Writing
and creating, practicing and coordinating... by
far is the most work you can do with a text,"
says Lecomte du Nouy. Cardace points out,
though, that the task gives one a "real appreciation and respect" for the authors, the actors,
and the texts themselves.

Originally released in 1944,
Double Indemnity is a sublimely

What all the critics have missed
is that Tarantino would probably be
the last to think of himself a

Pulp Fiction never aims to provoke
more than laughter and disgust,
hopefully simultaneously. John
Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and
Ving Rhames all provide great performances; Uma Thurman and
Bruce Willis are decent if unexceptional. Although there's nothing
here as wrenching as the ear-severing sequence in Reservoir Dogs,
Pulp Fiction is an admirably ambitious second film, bettering its predecessor in scope and complexity.
It's too long by about twentyfive minutes
some of the
sequences are too long, and others
should have been cut entirely, like
a homosexual rape scene which

there are too many memorable

The American Music Industry's Largest
Convention, Hulk Hogan, and Me
By Dan Sachar
This past week, I was fortunate
enough to attend the convention of
the National Association of Record
Merchandisers (NARM), the annual
convention of the entire American
music industry. The story of my
journey to San Diego, CA, must be
explained from the very beginning,
since it was an expedition so eventful that even getting to this beautiful
city was an adventure.
This tale begins with my flight
plans. There were no direct flights
from Philly to San Diego, so I had to
first fly to Atlanta.
From Atlanta I was supposed to
fly to Dallas and then to San Diego,
but my flight to Dallas was delayed

and I was going to miss the connection to San Diego. So I was placed
on a flight to Las Vegas. Just as I got
seated in this plane, who was to

actor... Hulk Hogan. It was extremely daunting to be in the presence of

Week in Review
Men's
Lacrosse
After gaining valuable experience from an
extremely tough schedule that included seven
of the top 25 teams in Division HI, the men's
lacrosse team looks to greatly improve on last
year's 2-14 record. With virtually the entire
roster returning, as well as two seniors returning from Australia, the outlook appears very
bright for secondyearhead coach ZachColburn.
Though the Garnet had some difficulty putting in goals from the attack position last year,
this year the attack should score almost at will.

Swarthmore's men's
lacrosse team will once
again face an extremely
tough schedule. This
year's roster includes not
only five of the top 25
teams in Division 111, but
also a Division I school.
Co-captain Cary Schaub '95, who missed most
af lastyear due to injury, is the playmaker. Co:aptain Brian "Doc" Dougherty '95 and Kevin
'Aldy" Aldrich '95 are the scorers. In the first
game against West Chester, Dougherty accumulated three assists, while Aldrich found the
back of the net six times. Eric Griffin '96 will
also have a hand in the scoring at attack.
Ben Seigel '96 is the returning leading

Women's
Lacrosse
midfield scorer, having tallied 19 goals a year
ago. Andy Place '96, Mike Higgins '95, Matt
Halpern '9B and Dave Sturtevant '96 are four
more midfielders the Garnet count on for success. Additionally faceoff man Dave Martinez
'96 has the hardest shot on the team and will
score. Mark Fink '95, back from Australia, is
the quickest man on the team and can beat any
defender. Pat Donaghy '97 is recovering from
shoulder surgery but should help the team towards the end of the season.
Defense was the Garnet's strong point last
year. Co-captainShannonBrown '95 leads this
fearless bunch. Andy Petusky '95,Tom Hooper
'96, Alex DeShields '9B, and Aaron Hultgren
'9B all have quick sticks and will be counted on
to slow the opponent's best players. Communication is key in the zone defense, and no one
talks like Charles Horton '96.
Ben Henwood '97 steps up as the starting
goalie this year. Although used sparingly last
year, Henwood brings high school All-American credentials to his resume. He'll be counted
on every game, as potential backup Donaghy
recovers from his injury.
Although the team will once again face an
extremely tough schedule that includes five of
the top 25 teams in Division 111 and Division I
Drexel University, these hard workers are up
for the task. The team shouldbounce back from
it's 0-3 start, which included losses to Division
II West Chester University, Trinity (CT.), and
Randolph Macon University. The team faces
Cabrini, Tufts and Drew before playing Centennial Conference opponents.

Men's Tennis

It looks as if Swarthmore's women's lacrosse team is on target for another outstanding
season this year. Headcoach Karen Borbee and
her assisting staff of Lisa Dawes and Rose
Smithlost only three varsity players to graduation, and the Garnet are ready to make another
strong bid for a spot in the NCAA tournament
at the conclusion of the regular season. This
season, team offense will be led by co-captain
Julie Noise '95, as well as Lara Evens '96,
Kristen Osborne '97 andLia Emst '97. Defensive will be anchored by co-captain Heather
Maloney '95, as well as Sam Peltz '97, Kelly
Wilcox '97, Bess O'neil '95, MadelineFrasier
'95, Laura Starita '96 and goalie Jill Maybee
'96. The Garnet should also receive signficant
contributionsthis season from newcomers Jess
Orlowski '9B and Katherine Wu '9B. As the
season gets underway, Borbee's team has already been training for several weeks. Over
spring break, the Garnet traveled to William
and Mary College to compete in a tournament
where they broke even against stiff competition.From there, the team journeyed to Hilton
Head, South Carolina, where they practiced for
the remainder of the week.
Swarthmore's talented team will face intense competition this year. Johns Hopkins,
Franklin and Marshall, and Ursinus will all be
very tough opponents, but as Lia Ernst predicted, "We're really looking to be strong this
season." The women's first home game will be

Beware Georgetown; March Madness at
Swarthmore College comes in the form of an
angry men's tennis team looking to avenge
their first loss of the season. Staying home to
train over the break, the Garnet men split two
matches, demolishing West Chester University
with a sweet 7-0 but bowing relucantly to a
fierce Brown University team with an unfortunate 6-1.
Boasting a 3-1 record, the tennismen saw
their hopes for an undefeated season crumble in
Providence, Rhode Island against the strong
opposition from the Brown team. The match
was a great deal closer than the score indicates,
as nearly all singles and doubles were tightly
contested. Barry Mook, '96 salvaged a win for
the Garnet at second singles, while Chris
Pearson, '95 nearly stole a match from his
formidable southpaw opponent at number one
singles.
"Even though we lost 6-1, we can gain some
confidence from this match against Brown,"
postulated Chris Ciunci, '95, who went to three
sets at number five singles. Ciunci added that
although Brown presented an especially tough
challenge, "we stood up to them at almost every
position. Right now we're just building momentum."
The men's team hopes to use that momentum
to roll over Georgetown tomorrow, at 1:00, at
the Faulkner courts. "Nobody on this team
likes to lose," warned Brandt Lincoln, '95,

against Washington College on March 25, and
will be followed by another home game against
Lynchburg College on March 26.

during practice this week. "I sure am happy
that I'm not a Georgetown tennis player right
now."

Baseball Looking to Rebound to .500 After Poor '94
By Frank Amar
Like Aretha Franklin in her smash hit single,
the Garnet baseball team will be looking for
respect this year, but more than just a little bit.
Last season, faced with massive losses from
graduation, the young squad received their baptism by fire. Swarthmore suffered through a 528 season. In losing 28 games, the Garnet beat
themselves as often as their opponents did. It's
hard to find silver linings in a 28 loss cloud, but
the Garnet will look to turn last year's negative
experience into a .500 or better season. Losing
only four seniors and two juniors to study
abroad, much of last year's baseball team remains intact.

In losing 28 games, the
Garnet beat themselves
as often as their opponents did. It's hard to
find silver linings in a 28
loss cloud, but the Garnet will look to turn last

year's negative experience into a .500 or better
season.
The Achilles Heel of last year's squad was
the infield play. Errors plagued the unit and
cost the Garnet a number of close games in
conference play. Given the team's recent hitting problems, solid infieldplay could garner a
few more victories. Back for his second year at
second base is Jeremy Bonder '97. Bonder's a
smooth fielder and a perfect #2 hitter in the
lineup because of his ability to make contact
and his unselfishness. Matt Grossman '96 will
hold down the shortstop position. Grossman
solidified his hold on the position with a torrid
week in Florida, where he batted a team high

.416 with IHR and BRBI. Chuck Hudson '96
and Matt Wiggins '96 will round out the starters, with Hudson at first and Wiggins at third.
Wiggins was a starter last year and for part of
his freshman year and he will provide the infield with a sense of stability. Others vying for
time in the infield will be Jon Francis '9B, Jeff
Spritzer '96, Drew Clayton '96, Jeff Gans'9s,
and Dan Johnston '9B.
This year's outfield will take on a different
look, having lost two year starter Frank S antora
'96 to study abroad, part time starter Brian
Luetke '96 to study abroad and three others
who saw significant playing time to graduation.Craig Rodner '96 will take over in leftfield.
Craig's speed and his heads-up, aggressive
play will add another dimension to the offense.
Sharing time in centerfield will be Pat Straub
'97 and JonFrancis '9B. Straub was the team's
leading hitter last season before suffering a
season ending ankle injury. His powerful bat in
the middle of the lineup will add to an offense
that was tied for second worst in Centennial
Conference play. Francis, according to co-captainBob Mascia '96,"... knows the game well.
has a good feel for the strike zone, which
makes him a good leadoff hitter.
Drew
Clayton '96, after spending some time at first
base last year, will move to right field. Aaron
Zwicker '9B will challenge for time at all three
outfieldpositions, as will Bob Mascia '96 when
he's not catching.
With the graduation of Shiv Tandon '94, the
catching chores will be delegated to Mascia.
Mascia shared time with Tandon behind the
plate last season. Mascia, with decent speed
and a good bat, will settle in at the cleanup spot
in the order whenhe returns from a concussion.
WhenMascia isn't catching, MattWiggins '95
and Paul Krause '96 will share the duties. Both
have experience and solid defensive skills.
Last season, opponents scored an average of
9.3 runs per game in conference play and 9.5
runs per gameoverall.Thepitching staff cannot
beblamed forallof these runs, but it's clear that
..

We can't shut everybody out," said Mascia.
The rotation appears to be set, with Straub,
Bonder, and Hudson, with Sam Voolich '96
getting a spot start and coming out of the
bullpen. Straub and Bonder are opposites as
pitchers; Straub is more of a power pitcher
while Bonder relies on a variety of pitches and
more changes of pace.
Hudson will be the stopper this year . His
durable arm enables him to log a lot of innings
and his wide assortment of pitches can confound hitters who are facing him for the first
time, a valuable asset for a closer. In a season
ending doubleheader against Dickinson last
season, Hudson pitched a complete game in the
first gameand came back to notch a save in the
nightcap. The rest of thebullpen will be manned

by Caleb Olin '96, the wily Jeff Gans '95,
DavidLischer '97, DanMalkoun '97, Voolich,

and Dan Johnston '9B.
It would be very easy to write off this team,
considering last year's record. A 5-28 record
isn't very deceptive, but you have to look
beyond the surface. The Garnet lostfour games
by one run and five games by two runs, and one
game each by three runs and four runs. Given
that many of these runs were unearned, many of
these games probably should have been wins.
The experience of having lost so many close
games in the later innings, along with another
year ofexperience should benefit the Garnet. A
.500 record or better is very reachable, provided the hitting comes around (which it should)
and the fielding improves.

Motherpuckers Ends Another Season With Reflection
By Joe Khan and
Christopher Rodger
In last month's Quaker Matchbox
questionnaire, question #5 read as
follows:
5. The most athletic thing you've
done all week was
a. walk to Sharpies
b. go to Motherpuckers
c. go to practice
d. run a marathon
If you're a member of the football
team, the engineering department, the
jazz band, SWIL or the volunteer
firefighters, there's a decent chance
that you picked the second choice.
Although its popularity has been
explained in the Student Handbook
and homepages on the Internet, many
Swatties know nothing more about
the organization than the fact that its
name sounds dangerously close to a
curse word. Now that the 1994-95
season is over, we feel that it's appropriate to offer the curious a deeper
look at Motherpuckers and reflect on
some of the year's highlights.
Motherpuckers is Swat's studentrun non-competitive Ice Hockey program. Like any popular activity on
this campus, itis absolutely free. The
first (and arguably the most fun) part
ofany Thursday night "Puckers" experience is getting to therink. For the
masses (those who don't have cars)
Motherpuckers runs a shuttle from
the Rose Garden. Inspired to squeeze
in maximum rink time, rink-goers
regularly manage to challenge auto
safety laws by cramming between
400 and 500 bodies in the red van.
Limbs are broken, appendages are
bruisedand virtues are compromised.
For the unlucky few unable to squeeze
into the sea of suffocation, a second
van run is usually made by driver
Alec Zimmer '97.
Though shuttle transportation is
important, Puckers die-hards have

consistently proven that it is not necessary. Take for example, the night

that a scheduling mishap overbooked
the shuttle and folks were left without transportation to the rink. Without skipping abeat, Charles Danforth
'95, Julianna Patrick '97 and Erik
Rosolowsky '9B grabbed their skates,
sticks and helmets and madethe trek
on foot. Or the time that a few people
missed the secondvan run; Len Cuello
'96 convinced the ML shuttle driver
to make a slight detour on his way to
Mary Lyon, PPR and Woolman. And
on rare occasions, the beloved TriCollege van driver has graciously
saved Zimmer a trip and played chauffeur to eager hockey players.
After finally arriving at theSpringfield Ice Rink, players eagerly don
their gear before heading onto the
ice. Motherpuckers provides helmets, pucks, hockey sticks and skates
of all sizes. S watties then take to the
ice for a brief free skate, stretching
their muscles and testing their hockey
skills. Finally, heeding the "line up"
battle cry, the troops assemble across
one side of the rink. They are next
greeted by their generals, Ross
Dickson '97, Larry Miller '97,
Rosolowsky and Zimmer. The four
"honchos" spell out the two rules of
play (wear a helmet and protect your
fingers after falling) and then get
things started.
Cycles of four lines of play, each
lasting five minutes, soon commence.
The lines are organized by skill, beginning with the A-line, for the most
advanced skaters and ending with the
D-line, comprised of beginners. Each
line indiscriminately splits into two
"even" teams and faces off. Though
Motherpuckers does provide most
other equipment, jerseys are not issued; the confusion over who is on
whose team just adds to the fun.
This year has been a particularly
glorious one for Motherpuckers. Paul
Atwater '95, Danforth, Dave
McKechnie '97 and Cavan Fleming
'96 all had impressive weeks on Aline, posing major threats to goalies.

Victories Down South for Swarming Earthworms
By Dominic Sagolla
As you have guessed from the sunburn quotient among the Men's Ultimate FrisbeeTeam,
the Swarming Earthworms went to Florida over
break. They camped everywhere they went,
beginning in Gainesville, where they participated in the Frostbreaker Tournament.
Their first day brought several close games
and a lot of spirit, but little success. Highlights
included a heartbreaker against Florida State
University, during which Japhet Koteen '96
demonstrated that he is, indeed, "Fast." The
second day began elimination play, and the
team was matched against the University of
Pennsylvania, whom the Swarming Earthworms
defeated 15-13.
This marks the first time in recent memory
thatSwat has beatenPenn, and it bodes well for
the spring season. The stars of the game were
Sasha "Poodle" Clayton '9B (who was the first
to earn the Layout Skirt) and Ali Momeni '97,
who seemed to appear in the endzone out of
nowhere just when he was needed. With 23
points, Momeni led the team in scoring over
break, and the team expects even more from
him this season. The Earthworms were eventually knocked out of competition by Gainesville
Green, but not before co-captain Robin Mandel
'97 succeeded in showing them the meaning of
the word "bid."
After a few games of pickup with the everchallenging Demented UltimateFreaks ofFSU
(and time onsome of thebest beach in America),
theEarthworms were prepared to leave Florida
for Georgia, where they swept the competition
at an Atlanta tournamentcalledTerminus. Swarthmore defeated Solstice/Medusa, a co-edclub

less-

women's andmen's track and field teams headed
for Pensacola over spring break. They saw the
weather they expected from Florida a scant two
or three days of the seven they were there, and
enjoyed overcast skies and hurricane-force
winds theremainder of their stay.
Fortunately, one of few sunny days coincided with their meet at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee with Wabash College and
Slippery Rock University. Their opponents at

scholarship athletes and considerably larger
student bodies to draw from, and Swat track
rose to the challenge admirably.
A ferocious tailwind hindered all but the
short sprints, but Swat still managed to pull out
some pretty good performances: The men's
4x400mrelay team, plagued by injuries, put an
all-rookie team on the track to mop up the
competition. Al Molnar '97, Frank Amar '96,
Walid Gellad '97, and Wyn Strodtbeck '9B,
none of whom had been on last's year's 4x400
squad, nudged out the team from Wabash at the
line by one one-hundredth of a second to win
the event.
Molnar described the trial of endurance,
"Both Walid [Gellad] and I had just finished
running individual-events and I thinktheir team
[Wabash] had too. Despite the blistering sun
and other grueling events, we vanquished them
in a test of grit and guts."

Eric Walton '97 set yet another personal best
in the javelin at 161 feet, a scant 16 feet off the
school record, while David Rich '95 was only
one foot off his PR at 148 feet. "Rich and
Walton just picked up where they left off last
year," throws Coach Don Bums says.
The team expects even bigger and better
things from its throwers this spring, especially
with the brand-new purple men's javeline. Look
for Walton to contend for the school record in
the javeline, which "is well-within reach this
year," according to Burns. "And if we had a
couple more women throwers, it could make
the difference in the women winning the conference. The track events are so strong."
In the sprints, Catherine Laine '9B ran a
blazing 27.5 sec. in the 200m, while Jill
Wildonger '97 and Tori Washington '97 went
1-2 in the women's open 400 with times of
64.5 sec. and 64.9 sec. respectively. Andrea
Johnson '9B finished second in the 100 m with
a time of 13.3 sec, and the women's 4xloom
and 4x400m were left uncontested.
For the men, Gellad dropped below the 24second barrier in the 200 m for the first time in
his life with a blistering 23.3 seconds., and
Amar took a full two seconds off his PR with a
24.1 seconds.
Swat's decathlete, Sam Paschel '96, unfortunately had to drop out of the decathlonafter
only one day of competition, despite some
strong performances on that first day. Paschel
had been training very hard to perfect the ten
events required of his chosen discipline, and
was just worn out, according to head coach Ted
Dixon.
Performances on the whole were somewhat
less than stellar, partially because of the depleted numbers of the men's and women's
squads
not everyone was able to make the
trip—andpartially because of injuries. Sprinters Mike Turner '96 and Eric Pakurar '97 were
riding the rehab wagon over break, only running curtailed workouts, and didn't compete in
the meet. Thrower Chris Fowler's '97 sprained
ankle didn't allow him to compete either, and
NoahDaniels '9B, a long-distance runner, also
hurt an ankle at some point during the week.

Rutter led the team with 19 assists, followed by
co-captain Matt Robison '96 at 17, who topped
the statistics at sevendefense blocks. The two
are a deadly combination that will work any

zone defense into the ground. With the addition
of new players like Bob "NO!" Yang '97 and
his Amazing Thumber, the Earthworms have a
shot at taking Sectionals this year. If their skill
doesn't carry them through, their cheers certainly will.

Catherine is long-overdue for mention in this
feature. So far this year, her indoor 55m time
has been within one tenth of a second from the
school's indoor record, and she has run the
third-fastest time ever for the indoor 200 m at
Swarthmore. Her first time triple-jumping in
her life placed her five inches from the school
record and only one centimeter off provisionally qualifying for the national championships.
Interestingly enough, she has had little experience with track beforecoming to Swarthmore,
though her potential seems unbounded. Head
track coach Ted Dixon agrees, saying, "She's
already made a mark in Swarthmore track and
field, and it's obvious that her abilities are
going to take her to a super-high level with a
little more experience."

AH was the leading scorer for the Swarming
Earthworms, Swarthmore's Ultimate Frisbee
team, on their spring break trip. Ali, in his
second year throwing disc, scored 23 points to
lead Swat to victories over the Univeristy of
Pennsylvania in the Frostbreaker Tournament
and several other teams at theTerminus tournament in Atlanta, Georgia. Teammates describe
him as an excellent handler, and note that he
also plays long exceptionally well. Fellow
Earthworm Matt Lawlor '95 says, "Ali is always one of the best on the field, if not the best.
I still can't believe that he went 'ho' over
Perm's top player while we were in Florida."
The team hopes to ride Ali's skills to a winning
season and some success at Sectionals later in
the season.
