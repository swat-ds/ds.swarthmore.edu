THE PHOENIX

Chemistry professor Bob Paley hasn't given a make-up exam in his 20
years at Swarthmore. But when two of
his students came down with influenzalike illnesses, or ILI, this week, he was
forced to make an exception.
commonly known as swine
HINI
flu has officially reached Swarthmore
College. The first case was confirmed
the week before fall break, and since
then over two percent of the student
body has visited the health center with
a case of suspected or confirmed swine
flu. So far, though, there have been no
serious medical complications.
"To date, all the students who've presented with influenza-like illness have
done very very well," said Beth
Kotarski, director of student health
services. "None of them have had to
have very high medical intervention."
Following the recommendations of
the Center for Disease Control and
American College Health Association,
Worth Health Center tested any students with ILI for swine flu until confirmed cases cropped up on campus.
The first positive test results came
in the week before fall break. Since
then, the health center has treated anyone with an ILI as if they have the flu,
either seasonal or HINL "Anything that
talks like a duck and walks like a duck
is a duck," Kotarski said. She added
that seasonal flu cases are very low
right now in the area. This policy keeps
labs from getting flooded with tests.
After the health center did the numbers and sent an e-mail Friday stating
that two percent of the student body
had come down with ILIs, more cases
were reported. Kotarski said, "Over the
weekend we increased our numbers.
Really on Friday we started to see the

symptoms."

Kotarski plans to continue sending
students updates on increases in the
percentage of students presenting with
ILI each Friday. She predicts that by
the end of the week, the percentage of
students who have or have had the flu
will be up to four percent.
"We're not going to do a case count,"
she said. "We're not going to give numbers. It creates panic. I think percentages are. much more accurate in showing exactly what's going on."
Speaking in terms of how these
numbers compare with previous years,
Kotarski said, "The numbers are still
not in any way alarming to us. They're
expected. We're following the trend of
what smaller colleges are experiencing
right now."
Acting Dean of Students Garikai
Campbell '9O echoed this statement.
"If you look at what's happening
nationwide, it's only a matter of time
before flu hits," he said.
The only major difference is the
time of year at which the cases cropped
up. According to the CDC, HINI doesn't
follow the typical seasonal flu patterns,
as shown by the late spring outbreak
earlier this year.
The individual cases on campus
have lasted on average from three to
five days.
Kotarski said she could not predict

ulation.
"The other colleges in Philadelphia,
like La Salle and other places that have
had big numbers of flu cases they are
really starting to see a decline. It took
them three or four weeks to get it
through their bigger populations," she
said.
None of the students with an ILI
have experienced any complications
such as secondary infection, trouble
breathing or eating, or a high and sustained fever. Some students with asthma were sent to the emergency room
for x-rays, but they came right back to

director of Public Safety, stressed
that the blue light system is no
more effective than having regularly spaced lampposts, and so it
will not be implemented.
The council also considered
ways to prevent door propping.
Some suggested a fine for people

door propping should, instead,
simply be stigmatized.
The council also discussed
implementing universal keys. If
there were keycards, however,
video cameras would need to be
installed.
Although these cameras would
only be consulted in case of emergency rather than monitored,

There would need to be a diversity of concentrations and of honors and non-honors students on

BCC: 40 years supporting diversity on campus
BY LINDA HOU
rhoul@swarthmore.edu

For over 20 years after graduating, Maurice Eldridge '6l

was unable to cope with his
alma mater. As one of the few
black students in what was
then a predominantly white
college, his experience left him
uncomfortable
with
the
school.
But in 1981, he returned to
Swarthmore to embrace its
changes, and today he is Vice
President for College and
Community Relations. He sees
the Black Cultural Center, or
BCC, as one of the driving
forces behind these changes.
Last Friday, the BCC held
its first open house since the
center's establishment. The
event was in honor of renovations which expanded the
handicap accessibility and the
size of the building.

felt like admissions should be
doing more to recruit colored
students, and the college
should do more to support
them," Eldridge said.
The Swarthmore AfroAmerican Student Society, or
SASS (now the Swarthmore
African American Student
Society), was dismayed by the
lack of effort and sent a letter
to then-President Courtney

admissions office to increase

Olde Club to undergo flood damage repairs

Jeff Davidson Phoenix Staff

Flood repairs are underway in Olde Club basement to address ongoing problems of flooding, mold infestation and general damage but some worry this is only a temporary solution.
BY DANTE FUOCO
dfuocol@swarthmore.edu
Going into his senior year as
Olde Club Facilities Director,
Louis Jargow 'lO said that he
was passionate about pushing
for improvements and renovations to the social space. But
before classes started this year,
this goal seemed unattainable.
Over the summer, water
flooded into the social space,
which is customarily locked
and unused over the summer.
The resulting warm, damp environment brought about what he
called "a massive mold infestation," which he discovered on
his return to campus in late

August.

And this sort of problem is
not a unique or new occurrence,
he said. Jargow, who was also
Olde Club's facilities director
from 2007-2008, stressed that
there have been several problems for the past few years, listing flooding as the most serious.
"If there was a kind of fire
inspector or a safety inspector
or someone who came in, I'm
sure they wouldn't let people go
into Olde Club," he said in an
Oct. 3 interview. "It's not even a
question.
[T]here are so
many hazards."
After a walk-through of student social spaces earlier this
month, members from all corners of the college have agreed
that Olde Club
one of two student social spaces on campus
and the only one that can hold
concerts
has several problems and are aiming to work
this year to fix them.
...

And while there are smaller,
more immediate repairs being
made, the college is resistant to
making bigger renovations
because of economic constraints.

and 26 with no success.
"We went in, and basically
couldn't even clean that stuff
because we didn't have the right
equipment," he said. "It wasn't
safe for us to clean up. And it
wasn't safe for people to be in
there."
On Aug. 27, Jargow e-mailed
and
Workbox
Assistant
Coordinator
of
Student
Activities Paury Flowers to
inform them of the problem.
Flowers said that this summer's mold infestation was not
an anomaly for Olde Club,
though.
"[The infestation] wasn't
completely surprising to me
given that we've had problems

with mold before," Flowers
said.
Jargow said that flooding has
been Olde Club's biggest problem. While in the short-term
flooding can "render the basement unusable" and push a
party upstairs, the bigger problem lies in what flooding has
done over the long-term, he
said.

As already mentioned, flooding creates a warm, damp environment for mold to develop,
which is what happened earlier
this year and other times in the
past. But flooding and mold
have, in turn, made floors begin
to rot and doors begin to break
down.
Olde Club's 2008-2009 facilities director Ming Cai 'll
agreed, emphasizing that flooding was a constant issue last
year.

"Every time there was a
thunderstorm or heavy downpour I would think to myself... I
wonder how flooded the basement in Olde Club is right now,"
she said in an e-mail. "Flooding
was a serious issue especially
when there were several events
in one weekend and not enough
time for the water to drain and
dry out.
"Having wet-floors at parties
is usually not a great idea, and
the flooding definitely added to
the mold problem. The kitchen

walls and floor have black mold
growing all over the place."
Manager of Maintenance Bill
Maguire said that there is currently a leak in the basement
under the front door that has
allowed for water infiltration.
In fact, Acting Dean of
Students Garikai Campbell '9O
said that he and facilities heard
from Zalokostas that there was
some flooding this week from
the rain over the weekend.
Maguire said that a crew
cleaned up a puddle of water in
the basement on Tuesday.
Whenever there's a big problem like mold infestation,
October 29, 2009-

Jargow lets both facilities and
Flowers know about it, such as
with the mold infestation.
Flowers said that she not only
responded to the problem immediately but also checked back to
see everything was being taken
care of.
"I'm always concerned about
peoples' safety
that's my one
issue," she said. "In the case of
the mold, they were called in to
make sure that everything was
being addressed, and it was safe
for people to be in the space."
Maguire said that, from the
time he heard from Jargow on
Aug. 27, it took about week and
a half to get a contractor in
there to begin fixing the problem and about a week and a half
to completely resolve the issue.
After all of this, he said that
the basement was "thoroughly
cleaned" through actions like
removing moldy furniture and
setting up purifiers that cleared
out mold spores.
Mold can be dangerous, and,
according to Maguire, there was
a lot of mold in the basement.
But he added that the contractor
said, "It really wasn't that bad."
Though the basement was
eventually cleaned, Jargow said
that he thought it took too long.
"It wasn't like all the sudden
everything was fixed at once,"
he said. "It was more like a
gradual process, and parties
went on while there was still
tons of mold in the basement,
and it was just disgusting and
unsafe."
Though purifiers were put
into place on Sept. 4, Jargow
said in an e-mail yesterday that

he was at a party on Sept. 5 that
only used the upstairs space
because of lingering issues with
the mold. He added that the first
event that was "'technically'
safe" and "able to happen without a major problem" took place
on Sept. 10. Even then, Workbox
had other things in Olde Club to
fix.
"During each of these -weeks,
Workbox was cleaning and in
and out of Olde Club many days
of the week," he said. "I got worried many weeks that we wouldn't be able to have parties
because I thought they were in
the middle of a much longer
process. We worked around
[sic]
their
work
thru
September."

Bigger issues
Jargow said that though
Workbox has typically been
respectful and quick in responding to issues, he stressed that
the administration has not
been.
Jargow said in his interview
on Oct. 3 that when he's talked
to Flowers and Assistant
Director for Student Life Kelly
Wilcox '97, they have said that
"there's nothing they can see
the administration doing this
year with mold or renovation."
Considering that Olde Club
is a student-run social space,
Jargow said that the deans have
often directed him to the
Student Budget Committee,
which, he said, has been sympathetic. He added, however, that

SBC in the past has directed him
to Student Council, which then
has just directed him back to the
administration.
"Everyone's been pointing to
the next guy," he said. "No one
wants to take responsibility or,
especially, no one wants to cough
up money for real progress.
We're kind of stuck in this limbo
of bureaucratic nightmare. It's

trating."

Last year's facilites director
Ming Cai 'll agreed.

She said in an e-mail that
workbox, which she "ended up
at least once a week,"
calling
was easy to deal with and resposive to smaller issues, like fixing
"the toilet or whatever else was
broken."
"However, the larger problems with the space seem to be
neglected by the administration.
I understand the idea that Olde
Club is a student run venue and
space, but that does not mean the
administration should not consider putting more money into
its basic upkeep," she said.
Jargow said that Flowers' and
Wilcox have often told him this
year that the college has been
slowed down in taking action
this year because of economic
constraints. Speaking from the
position of being facilities direc...

tor two years ago, Jargow
expressed understanding of this

fact but also confusion over it.
"I do understand the times
are tight," he said. "But two
years ago when we weren't in a
recession I tried to do the same
things. And I probably wasn't as
effective or efficient at doing
this. But I also came up against a
lot of walls and nothing ever got
accomplished, even without the
recession."
the end of the
In May 2008
academic year in which Jargow
acted as facilities director for the
first time Jargow sent a report
to Flowers that included pictures
of problems with explanations.
"I think the bureaucracy of
Olde Club leaves something to be
desired," Jargow states at the
beginning of the five-page report.
"Olde Club is in a general state of
disrepair. It's an old building
that needs a lot of work some
of which I think needs to happen
over the summer, or as soon as
possible. There are a lot of problems with the facilities that have
been aggravated by use and limited maintenance this year."
Jargow goes on to define the
problems: flooding, which he
said is the biggest issue; mold;
clogged plumbing in the kitchen
sink; dented holes in the wall; a
broken keyhole on the front
door; and peeling paint.
"The administration did nothing about the report or the list of
complaints I had made two years
ago," Jargow said in an e-mail.
"In fact many of those things,
such as protecting Olde Club
from flooding, are only really
being considered two years later,

THE PHOENIX

and as far as I am concerned, the
main reason why mold has gotten so bad in that space. The
holes in the wall and the bathrooms are only being treated
now."

Walk-through and solutions
Despite Jargow's frustration

with the administration, on Oct.

6 a diverse group of members
from the college community did
a "walk-through" of Paces and
Olde Club, the two student social
spaces on campus.

Associate Dean for Student
Life Myrt Westphal said that the
walk-through was incited by concerns from both students and
facilities about the state of Olde
Club and Paces. It was not only to
"figure out what needs to be done
and who needs to do it" but also
to
foster
communication
between different members of
the college, she said.
People on the walk included,
among
others:
Jargow,
Zalokostas, Flowers, Maguire,
Campbell and Westphal.
"It almost was like a summit
of people who care about these
spaces,"
Westphal
said.
"Everybody had a chance to hear
what other peoples' concerns
were."
Maguire
agreed,
adding,
"Basically it has to be a coopera-

tive effort of the administration
to make
these spaces work."
Westphal said that the walk
revealed problems in Olde Club
that are preventable.
She said that leaks, for one,
can be patched up to prevent
flooding. Mold and mildew problems could, in turn, be stopped in
the future by installing a dehumidifier over the summer. The
[and] the students

...

way lights and speakers hang

can be made safer, just as the
upstairs banister looking down
on the floor and stage can be
checked for stability.
Jargow,
Campbell
and
Westphal said that while the
walk-through was happening,
there was a group of people
repainting some areas of Olde
Club, such as the peeling wall
along the stairwell.
Everyone who attended the
walk-through indicated that they
were pleased with how it went.
"[The walk-through] gave us
an opportunity to talk about how
[the college community] might
do better," Cambpell said, adding

that this was what he was look-

ing for beforehand.
Jargow
agreed
with
Campbell. "It seemed like it was
a relatively productive meeting
in terms of opening everybody's
eyes on how bad it is, not just
through word of mouth or e-mail
descriptions," Jargow said. "And

I think that everyone was pretty
upset about it."
When asked how she reacted
when seeing Olde Club, Westphal
said, "I don't know if I'd say
grossed out. I would just say,
'Wow. This is a really disappointing place for our students to have
fun.'

"

Jeff Davidson Phoenix Staff

Continued flooding in Olde Club's basement has brought damage to the floor and caused mold growth.
Flowers echoed Westphal
after the walk-through.
"For what Olde Club is, I'm
impressed how it's holding up,"

Flowers said. "There's going to
have to be something more done
to keep Olde Club standing, so
...

to speak."
Jargow added that one of the

first actions discussed was
"flood-proofing" the walls and

floor of Olde Club. Jargow indicated that this was a step forward considering flooding has
been his biggest concern. Both
Jargow and Maguire said that
Olde Club is. not yet floodproofed, though there are tentative plans to do so.
After the walk-through,
Jargow said that he is now more
confident that the college will
make "quick fixes" by the end of
the year. He said that these
include things like making Olde
Club flood-proofed, patching
holes and painting over moldy
spots.
Maguire said, however, that
flood-proofing isn't as easy as it
may seem for a few reasons. The
location of the basement's leak is
a problem because it is directly
below the front door. He added
that this year has been rainier
than normal, which is problematic because the work area needs
to be dry.
With all these things in mind,
Maguire said the flood-proofing
will undoubtedly happen by the
end of the year and expressed a

October' 29, 2009

hope that this can be completed
by the beginning of second
semester.
Jargow wrote in an e-mail on
Monday that Workbox has painted over peeling walls in the stairwell and basement and patched
over the walls' biggest hole.
Currently, they are also fixing
the clogged bathroom sink.

Nevertheless, he added, "We
are still faced with a bit of mold
around the basement, warped
floors, ruined tiles, a broken
downstairs sink, holes missing
baseboard, just to name a few
things."
"I think that the administra-

tion is still slow and still very
careful ifnot unwilling to give up
a lot of money for these kinds of
projects," Jargow said in a separate interview. "I think there's a
lot of deliberation for a space
that needs more immediate kind
of changes."
Jargow added that he still
doesn't think the administration
is willing to make bigger fixes
and renovations that would cost
the college more money, such as
changing the floors, creating
more space, and fixing up the
walls.
When asked about the plausibility of larger-scale updates to
Olde Club, all three deans
emphasized that the college is
currently at a financially unstable place considering last year's
economic downturn.
"[Olde Club] definitely needs

some TLC. It definitely, definitely needs it," Flowers said. "I just
don't know where the funding
and the person power would
come for updating it in the near
future. If I knew that, it probably
would've already been done."
Westphal said that it's difficult, at this point in the year, to

establish a definite timeline:
"[There are] different timeframes and different piece
because different people are in
charge of different parts of it."
Campbell added, too, that the
college needs to make sure that
the investments it makes will
last over the long-term.
"Even if money dropped out
of the sky and we were able to do
something dramatic," he said,
the college needs to ask itself:
"How do we maintain [it] so that
we make that investment last?"
Despite these administrative
concerns, Jargow said that he
hopes that at some point Olde
Club will get more major
changes.

At the same time, he said that
wants to see Olde Club at
a better place by the end of the
year, conceding that doing these
small changes is "better than
he just

nothing."
"My ultimate hope is that
[they will] actually renovate, but
my feeling is [the college will] do
these quick fixes," Jargow said
after the walk-through. "I don't
expect anything beyond that.But

I'd rather be wrong."

Guatemalan woman shares story of imprisonment
Camacho de Schmidt said. "It is very hard

BY HANNA KOZLOWSKA
hkozlowl@swarthmore.edu

The blissful marimba music in Science
Center 104 created a stark contrast with
what was in store for the attendees of
Thursday's "The Day That Changed My Life
Forever" lecture. Gladys Monterroso, a 52-

year-old Guatemalan lawyer, brought herself and several students to tears while
speaking about being kidnapped and tortured in March 2009.
As a part of an ongoing cooperation with
the Guatemalan Human Rights Commision,
or GHRC, a non-profit organization who
brought an indigenous family from
Guatemala to speak last year, Monterosso
was invited to speak at Swarthmore by

Aurora Camacho de Schmidt, associate professor of Spanish.
Monterroso is a political and human
rights activist, a law professor at the
University of San Carlos of Guatemala in
Guatemala City, secretery general for a
major political party (Encuentro por
Guatemala) and wife of Human Rights
ombudsman Sergio Morales. She was kept
in captivity, raped and tortured both physi-

cally and mentally for 12 hours before she
was thrown out on the street tied up, blind-

folded and half-naked.
Monterroso is touring colleges in the
United States to talk about her tragedy and
the situation of women in Guatemala. The
Swarthmore event was sponsored by the

Forum for Free Speech, the Lang Center, the
Intercultural Center and the Latin
American studies department.
"I wasn't sure we should invite her,"

to talk about these issues."
Monterroso's kidnapping was described
in detail during the lecture, first in a 15minute documentary film titled "Violence
Women
and
in
Against
Impunity
Guatemala" in which the whole event was
reenacted, and then retold by the speaker

herself.
Three men in yellow masks captured her
in broad daylight on a busy street and threw
her in a van, blindfolded her and tied her
up. When they arrived at their destination,
they threw her on a mattress and put a gun
against her temple. Theyraped her, beat her

and burned her arms, probably with cigarette butts. They forced her to drink liquor
and swallow pills.

It is believed that Monterroso was kidnapped to pressure her husband not to
release information about military crimes
that he had been collecting for years.

Monterroso was taken on the day the documents were to be made public by her hus-

band.
"I'm very concerned about Guatemala.
It's easy to forget about a country so small
and seemingly unimportant," Schmidt said.
Guatemala suffered a civil war from 1960
to 1996, the longest in Latin America. The
war was a guerilla conflict with insurgents
fighting against the military government.
According to the CIA World Factbook,
100,000 people were killed in the war,
although other organizations estimate that
the number is higher. One million of the
country's 13 million residents were displaced. "Almost every person in Guatemala
has been affected by the war," said the

GHRC's

Kelsey Alford-Jones, Monterroso's

interpreter. The country has been in tur-

moil ever since the war ended. Narcotics
trafficking and organized crime are preva-

lent. According to the GHRC there is a9B
percent impunity level, meaning that only
two percent of crimes are prosecuted.
Monterosso's captor, Oscar Martin
Gutierrez Valle, was released. The judges

claimed a new investigation had to be conducted.
Monterroso's lawyers are appealing the
case. When talking about the court proce-

dures, Monterroso seemed very upset. "My
huge crime was to have survived. I'm fighting with huge ghosts," she said.
The fact that Monterroso decided to litigate the case is a rare exception to

Guatemalan norms.
The crimes that go unrecorded most
often are committed against women. "All
women live in fear," Monterosso said, shaking her hands in the air. "On public buses,
they wear pants in fear of being raped, right
there, on the bus, in front of all the commuters," she said.
After telling her story she went on to
talk about other tragic and gruesome cases.
She recounted the story of Heidi, a 14- yearold girl. To become gang members in
Guatemala, boys must often rape and kill a
woman. According to Monterroso, boys as
young as eleven join gangs. Because the
three youngs boys who captured Heidi didn't know how to kill a person, they stabbed
Heidi 75 times. Monterroso could barely
speak when telling this story, choking back

tears.

This was one of the many cases of femi-

cide in Guatemala. "Femicide" is homicide
commited against a wpman for the sole reason of her being female, according to the
GHRC. In 2008 alone over 700 women were
killed. And the numbers are increasing.
"Statistics make more sense than just a
written number when coming from a real
person," said Frances Kvietok 'lO, who
helped secure funding for the event.
The lecture was followed by a question

and answer session. The majority of the students who attended were from the Spanish
and Latin American studies, peace and conflict studies and gender and sexuality studies programs. Many of the questions were
posed in Spanish by native speakers from
countries like Peru and Mexico.

Students wanted to know how they could

help with the situation in

"You feel like you want to do something,"
Kvietok said. "It is really frustrating, hearing such a strong testimony and not being
able to
do anything,"
she added.
Monterroso told The Phoenix that this was
a question posed very often by students in
the United States. "It is immensely gratifying," she said.
Monterroso encouraged the students to
form networks, to talk about the problems,
to come to Guatemala and try to change the
people's mentality by creating outside pressure. Students were provided with various
brochures and fact sheets to learn more
about the problem.
After hearing the testimony, it was difficult for students to return to class.
"Having attended such an intense, emotional event, it is hard to go back to real
life," Kvietok said.

CONTROVERSY

COSTUMES

BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT

qgounotl@swarthmore.edu

This Saturday is Halloween and
here at Swarthmore, that means it's
timefor the biggest party of the year.
This year the party will be held in
Upper Tarble, a recent decision made
as the result of a complex planning
process. Until last weekend, the
party was expected to be held in a
tent on Mertz field. However, various
issues were raised by the student
body so the Student Affairs
Committee, or SAC, reconsidered
their decision.
Until 2005, the Halloween party
took place in Mary Lyon. However,
this practice was discontinued in
2006 because ML residents found that
it disrupted their living space. Since
then, the party's location has been in
flux; The party was held in Upper
Tarble in 2006 and 2007 and in
Sharpies in 2008.
According to SAC co-directors
Rebecca Commito 'lO and Shumpei
Tse 'lO, finding a location for the
Halloween party is always difficult.
The main challenge is the size of the
room. Commito and Tse estimate
that while about 200 to 300 students
come to typical Paces parties, 800 to
1000 Swatties wiU attend the
Halloween party.
"Because it's Halloween and it's a
costume party, people dress up and
have fun. The Halloween party is
known as a time when the whole
campus comes together to share an
event," Commito said.
SAC found that having the party
at Sharpies last year required too
much work. Commito and Tse said
that "students enjoyed the new location," but that it was difficult to have
to set up the room after dinner and
clean it up before breakfast. They
found that the part of Sharpies used

was too small, but that moving the
tables in the big room would be
unpractical.

This year, SAC considered return-

ing the party to ML or having it in
the PPR dorm complex. However,

ML and PPR Resident Assistants
expressed concerns about possible
effects on their living spaces.
Moreover, the recent police raid
at Haverford, which resulted in student arrests, raised major concerns
about having a large-scale party in
an off-campus dorm, with hundreds
of students walking to and from campus. Many alternative locations are
out of bounds for such parties; for
instance, academic buildings and
their bathrooms may not be used for
the party.
SAC reasoned that having a tent
on Mertz field might be the best
option. However, many students
were unhappy with this decision,
and several important concerns
made them reconsider. First of all,
the weather remains uncertain, and
Mertz field gets very muddy when it
rains. Secondly, as in other dorms,
some Mertz residents expressed concerns about people causing possible
damage and disruption to their residences. Still, the Mertz first floor
RAs Andrew Hoot 'lO and Erin
Scanlon 'lO assured that they were
consulted about the possibility of
using their bathrooms for partygoers.
"We were told by SAC that they
would be responsible for cleaning up
any mess, and that a few Party
Associates would be positioned
inside of Mertz to make sure that
only Swarthmore students got in. We
gave the okay to have the party near
our residence," Hoot said.
Commito and Tse said that talking to people about any concerns
they might have was very important

AND

to them. "Our main goal is for every-

one to be happy. We don't want to
alienate anyone," Tse said.
SAC is not completely happy with
the new location of this year's
Halloween party, but they have taken
measures to ensure that the party
will run as smoothly as possible.
People will have to use the stairs to
get from Upper Tarble, a dry space, to
refreshments in Paces and to the
bathrooms, which could present a
safety issue.
"There will be Party Associates
checking the traffic flow in the stairs
and dealing with any spilled liquids,"
Commito said. Another issue is that
it is hard to get drinks and candy off
the "nicely polished floors" of Upper
Tarble. "We've had lots of experience
throwing parties in Upper Tarble by
now. We'll buy food more suited to
the space," Commito and Tse said.
"We're working with the Drug
and Alcohol Resource Team, the
Party Associates and the dean's
office to make the party as safe and
enjoyable as possible," Tse said.
SAC has put much timeand effort
into planning this year's Halloween
party, although it has not always
been easy, and its efforts have not
always been successful.
"It is difficult to throw [this
party]. We have to make final judgment calls, but we want to be as
inclusive as possible. We take individual concerns seriously," Tse said.
Commito said that SAC continues
to host the Halloween party because
they think it is such an important
event. She said, "It is a time for the
whole campus to enjoy an event
together. People with varying interests can come together and share
their love for Swarthmore."
The Halloween party will take
place this Saturday in Upper Tarble
from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

There are some dishes at Sharpies

the diversity of flavor choices available.
I've seen, however, earnest requests
on the 'Napkin Board' from students to
tone down the spiciness of some foods
because they're too spicy for them. I
understand spice is a good thing, but
above a certain level (which is different
for all people) it can be uncomfortable.
Sharpies tries to accommodate a wide
range of taste preferences. While it may
seem preferable for cooks to eliminate
the spice and serve pepper flakes (or
whatever spice) on the side for people
who want the spiciness, dishes just taste
better when they've been cooked with
the spices rather than when they are
added after the cooking is done. I'm saying that spicy dishes are better cooked
that way. But there is a quick solution to
masking the spiciness of some dishes.
You can rein in the spiciness with
something dairy-based or chase it with
something sweet. If the soup or chili is

spicy, eat it with a handful of shredded
cheese (at salad bar) or top it off with a
dollop of sour cream (at condiments bar).
For example, I found the jerk chicken at
Caribbean bar a tad spicy for me so I

Eating the jerk chicken with the side of

Caribbean bar) also toned down the
spicy flavor. When something chutney-

What she's wearing:
"This is a dress from Urban Outfitters. This [scarf] is
from Gap. The leggings are from Topshop, and [the
purse] is H&M," Rousseau said. With her French origins, most of her clothing is from Parisian boutiques and
stores. "The boots are from a French store called Naf
Naf. This leather jacket is from Promod." Rousseau
wears her clothes effortlessly, a technique that most
Parisians seem to have.
Though she claims she doesn't follow fashion as
closely as some, she combines simple items to make an
outfit equally comfortable and cool. The light brown
ankle boots stand out in her outfit, especially against the
black leggings. The chunky heel and suede-like material
are reminiscent of the ankle boots seen in stores and
runways. The ankle boot is the tamer of the boot trends
for the season compared to the thigh-high boots.

"H&M, Zara and Urban Outfitters,"

Her fashion influences and inspirations:
Rousseau takes fashion cues from the 60s rock era.
"I'm thinking of the girls who would go out with The
Beatles: kind of groovy and always wearing dresses and
skirts," she said. The easy-going looks of 60s style are
similar to Rousseau's approach to fashion. "I just pick
what I like, and it turns out most of the time to be shirts,
skirts and dresses."
Though Rousseau hails from one of the fashion capitals of the world, she tends to stay away from trends.
"One thing that I don't like about Paris is that a lot of the
kids that dress fashionable all dress the same and
according to these codes," she said. "They don't really
choose what they wear; they just follow whatever."
Rousseau did not dress like them while in high school,
but since coming to Swarthmore, she feels her attitude
to how she dresses has changed. "Since nobody here

Fashion blogs she follows:

In the ring, a nuanced examination of identity

swarthmorephoenix.com

acolemal@swarthmor.edu

Two people in the program for InterAct Theatre
Company's latest play stand out for their unusual
unusual, at least, for actors. Eric "The
names
Smoke" Moran and Tony "Hitman" Stetson. Hitman
and The Smoke have both worked for companies like
ECW, Extreme Championship Wrestling or the nowdefunct NWA Shockwave and have earned their fierce
nicknames in front of an audience that has virtually
no overlap with the InterAct audience, despite the
widespeared belief that wrestling is simply another
type of performance.
For just one month, however, the worlds of professional wrestling and theater are coming together on
the Philadelphia stage in a fusion that is as clever as
it is unlikely. After all, if one of the biggest critiques
of professional wrestling is that "it's all fake," then
aren't all professional wrestlers just burly actors
working on a fenced-in stage? The play, "The
Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity," explores the
nuances of the performances delivered by these beefy
brutes, the art and business of creating a story that
the audience will want to hear, and the people who
struggle to find a place in that narrative for their cul-

ture and worldview.

"The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity" gives us
the story of Macedonia Guerra (portrayed by the
slight, but athletic Juan Pacheco), a foil to the star of
THE Wrestling, Chad Deity (Donte Bonner, who
spends the entire play in a gold lame Speedo). Guerra
is looking for something more from his career and is
tired of just being "Mace," a nickname that he suspects his boss uses because he doesn't know how to
actually pronounce his name.
As a wrestler, and as a person, Guerra wants to see
the great metaphor of America, as reflected by the
wrestling narrative of Chad Deity, to expand to
include a more representative group of heroes. He
believes that he has found the answer to his quest
when he discovers the fast-talking Vigneshwar
Paduar (Shalin Agarwal) on a basketball court in
Brooklyn. Yet Guerra instead finds that no matter
what he brings to the table, THE Wrestling will appropriate it until it fits with their conception of what peo-

ple want.
,

"The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity" speaks
successfully to so many of the different issues in identity formation and the way it may be twisted that it is
hard to pinpoint which argument is the most effective, but playwright Kristoffer Diaz can be credited
with quite a few. For instance, Vigneshwar Paduar, an
Indian from Brooklyn (whose name is shortened to
"VP" because his own name is too difficult to pronounce and who is referred to derogatorily as a
"Paki" by his employer at THE Wrestling) steps onto

the stage in a new persona, "The Fundamentalist," a
role which is ah amalgam ofevery Middle Eastern terrorist stereotype the corporate higher-ups could ever
possibly dream up. He then delivers a single, brilliant
line that is enough to sum up the comedy and horrors
of the situation in which he finds himself. VP simply
states that he has no idea what a yoga mat, Greek
prayer beads' and a turban have to do with a Middle
Eastern terrorist, but that he has not bothered to
point this out to the higher-ups who control his

career.

Moments and images like these are at the heart of
the success of "The Elaborate Entrance of Chad
Deity." Mace presents himself as a storyteller, a man
striving towards an ideal of the perfect human story,
as told through wrestling, and these misappropriations are the currency in which he must trade in
order to obtain a venue for his story. It is the actor
Pacheco's job to make his character's compromises
justifiable in light of his dreams, and the relish and
love with which Pacheco speaks about wrestling is
more than enough to convince the skeptics. Luckily
for the audience, Pacheco is more than effective at
doing so, and is able to convince the audience of his
power as both a storyteller and idealist in his quest
for his story.
When Pacheco speaks, we are convinced, for a brief
moment in time, that professional wrestling is power-

12

ful because everyone knows that it is fake. The story
in Mace's mind is simple: Every member of the audience knows that both wrestlers are working as a team.
One makes the other look like he deserves his victory,
while the victor ensures that his enemy and accomplice goes unharmed in a complicated and highly choreographed dance around the ring. It may be simply a
ruse, but it is a powerful one.
Pacheco has a beautiful grasp on Mace, and his
energetic and passionate work is the pulse of a cast
that is filled to the brim with talent, from the powerful leads to the compelling portrayals of secondary
characters. Every character, no matter the size of the
role, is lovingly played and thoughtfully developed by
the talented cast, pushed to the same degree of precision expected of each move in the wrestling matches
the show is depicting and discussing.
InterAct's new play is a witty, wild, intelligent
attack on the entertainment industry and on media in
general, whose only weakness is its supposition of an
informed and open-minded audience. In other words,
"The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity" suffers from
too much faith in the theater-viewing public. For an
audience unaccustomed to political correctness and
desensitized to the problems with collapsing cultural
identities, most of the play is meaningless.lts underlying discussion of issues of identity and of life itself
may be lost to the general theater-going public.
Philadelphia is lucky to have a show like this, but
let's just hope that they're lucky enough to understand it, too.

he also has a soft side, as seen when he wishes for his
sister and mother (played by Catherine Keener, "The
40-Year Old Virgin") to pay attention to him rather
than be with their friends or boyfriend. He hopes his
imagination will make everything better. When he
arrives at the Island of the Wild Things, their world is
in chaos. Max finds a friend in Carol (voiced by James
Gandolfini, "The Sopranos"), and though the others
suspect Max is more suitable for a dinner rather than
the all-powerful position, they name him king.

and their interactions with Max. The Wi Irl Thinac

The 1963 children's book "Where the Wild Things
Are" captured the essence of the childhood world of
reality and fantasy. Written by Maurice Sendak, the
story of Max, who fought with his mother and escaped
to the imagined island of the Wild Things, was wellreceived by critics, parents and children and held a
place in many hearts as being one of the best children's books.
When the trailer for the big screen movie version
hit the Internet, ecstatic joy (I admit I teared up when
I saw the Wild Things jumping around to Arcade
Fire's "Wake Up") and slight hesitation generated lots
of buzz about whether Spike Jonze's directing and
Dave Eggers' screenplay would live up to the acclaim
of the book.

most beautiful part of it, however,
was Records' keen, nuanced performance of the frailty of childhood and the ability of a child's

there were many show-stealing scenes, it was
Max's realization that he could not be a king that

essence that makes the empty feeling at the end of the
movie not so bad. Whether it's the six-year-old boy
who was wearing his wolf costume a few rows ahead,
or the older couples who read the book as kids, the
sheer beauty of the ten-sentence picture book creates
the realization that the movie couldn't be as good as
the book, and that's okay.

Making aural babies: the sound of Lucky Dragons
BY MAIA GERLINGER
mgerlinl@swarthmore. edu

The line between audience and musician was blurred this Saturday at the Olde
Club performance of experimental band
Lucky Dragons. More group activity than
stage performance, Lucky Dragons is a
two-person band whose output is
expressed through a variety of media
predominantly performance, recorded
music and video.
Lucky Dragons member Sarah Rara
describes their sound as "ecstatic music."
Olde Club director Anna Zalokostas 'lO
said that the band had been chosen
because "they're really interesting artistiand really innovative."
cally
In particular, Zalokostas referenced
the band's Make a Baby project, which
features homemade hardware and software that allows audience members to
directly participate in the sound being
created. "This creates communicative
possibilities during the performance, both,
between the performers and the audience,
and between audience members themselves," Zalokostas said.
"What I really like is that they try to
make an intimate warm atmosphere out
of anything," Louis Jargow 'lO, the Olde
Club Facilities director, said. "They get
people not interested in participating to
participate. We don't always get this kind
of experimental music going on."

that room, human contact created music,

crowd's reaction ranged from impassioned, formless hipster dancing to grimaces of pain, as people quickly left the
building.

Then, finally, Lucky Dragons took the
stage. They set up on the middle of the
floor while the audience sat around in a
circle. Rara and Fishbeck both knelt
amidst the equipment. A third, temporary
member a friend of the band sat and
played gentle percussion next to a microphone. Rara sang pure notes that followed
no melody; processed, her voice vibrated
and shimmered. Some audience members
seemed bored; others seemed relaxed and
content.
Eventually, Fishbeck shuffled on his
knees around the circle and handed out
rocks. Gradually, the familiar scales of
Make a Baby, exuberant and hovering,
began to grow. Audience members with
rocks moved closer, waving them over the
machines as Rara played the thumb piano
in peaceful thirds.
Like all experimental music, it was
either ridiculous or interesting, depending on your point of view. After all, there
was no melody, no song structure; the purpose was to make noise together, pure and
simple. Concertgoer Will Schulz 'l3
described it as "musical feedback."
Soon, Lucky Dragons took out the
cords, and people began grasping hands,
delighting in the experience of having the

sounds completely change through touching each other. "It's corporeal music," concertgoer Will Duncan 'l3 said.
As the other sounds faded out one by
one, finally, only Rara's processed voice
was left to fill the room.

Late-night host dishes out humor with honesty
The late-night talk
show landscape has been
very busy for the past few
months.
From
the
announcement that Conan

and would no longer play

to the news that Jay would

precious hours of primePencils Down,
time to host an hour-long
talk show that would force
Pass the Remote
Conan to continue playing
second fiddle, to David
Letterman's
revelation
that he was being blackmailed after having affairs with various women on his
staff, it has been a busy and scandal-ridden time for late
night. The change that may well be the most significant
for the future of late-night comedy, however, has gone
virtually unnoticed; nobody is really talking about the
fact that over at CBS's "Late Late Show," Craig Ferguson
has been quietly reinventing the late-night talk show.
For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking
about, and who are turning to Google to prove to me that
the post-Letterman slot is still occupied by Craig
Kilborn, Ferguson is a Scottish (although now a naturalized American citizen, a fact of which he is very proud)
stand-up comic who took over "The Late Late Show" in
2005. Prior to hosting the late-night talk show he was best
known as Mr. Wick, the imperious British boss on "The
Drew Carey Show." He also wrote and appeared in the
very funny and criminally underseen film "Saving
Grace," the story of an elderly widow in massive
amounts of debt who turns to marijuana to solve her
financial problems. Basically, it's "Weeds" with old peo-

pie and better dialogue, and the added distinction of coming out in 2000, five years before the latter show aired.
Ferguson has a gift for writing, as evidenced by the
screenplay for "Saving Grace" and the two books he's
published: the breathtakingly funny novel "Between the
Bridge and the River" and the heartbreaking, darkly
comic memoir "American on Purpose." While the writing on his show is quick and clever (for evidence of this,
compare Ferguson's recent sketch called "A Party at

kind of skill as a performer that he brings to the late-

night table.
The history of vice that Ferguson brings to the show
primarily alcoholism, but also drug abuse, infidelity
and two divorces is, ironically enough, a way for the
audience to get close to Ferguson. On "The Late Late

Show" there is no veneer of Midwestern innocence disguising a penchant for sleeping with employees, and we
know far more about Ferguson than the names of his
children or that he coUects classic cars. Instead, he is
honest about the years he spent stinking drunk, snorting
cocaine, getting into fights and falling into bed with
woman after woman.
This bare, almost painful honesty often works to his
advantage; a year and a half ago, when Britney Spears
went on her head-shaving spree, the other late-night
hosts were aU making jokes at her expense (as was just
about everyone else in the English-speaking world).
Ferguson, however, refused to go there. Brit's wild weekend was also Craig's fifteen-year anniversary of being

Martial arts club packs a big punch on campus

Martial arts is not always just a sport;
sometimes, it's a way of life. The Martial
Arts Club, in operation since last
November, aims not only to teach the different forms of martial arts, but also to
teach the underlying philosophies and to
bring the styles into dialogue.
"We teach values such as etiquette,
modesty and self-control," Tom Liu 'l2
said. Liu is one of the club's senior
instructors, along with Philip Chodrow 'l2
and Joshua Vertolli 'l2, who, with assistant instructors Max Chomet 'l2 and
Brandon Snuggs 'l3, teach club members
different styles of martial arts, primarily
focusing on taekwondo.
Taekwondo can be broken into three
parts: 'tae' means "to strike or smash with

14

the foot," 'kwon' means "to strike or
smash with the hand," and 'do' means "as
a way oflife." Thus as a whole, taekwondo
is not just a method of fighting, but a philosophy on life.
Taekondo is taught the most by the
club because it is the style most familiar
to the instructors. Other styles include
karate, taught by Chomet, aikido, taught
by Chodrow, and tangsoodo, taught by
VertoUi.
The club offers three official classes a
week, all taught by the student instructors
who are certified by their home martial
arts schools.
"If they're not black belts, they're
high-ranking," Chodrow said.
In addition to the three lessons, the
club has a weekly open-mat session for
students to practice, use equipment and
gain experience. They also do self-defense
seminars, tournaments and demonstrations, and are able to give out taekwondo
rankings to members.
Every week the club takes students to
Norristown to study under Harry Plichta,
who is a seventh dan black-belt, a high
level black-belt that takes many years to
achieve. Liu is, for instance, a second dan,
and he explained, "It took me four years to
get to second dan."
"Plichta's been doing this for several
multiples of my lifetime," Chodrow added.
The instructors aim to take what they
learn from Plicta and incorporate it into
their own teachings.
The club began last November, though
as Chodrow explained, they "weren't chartered into the spring, but started running
classes before that." Chodrow was in an
aikido class, and it came to be known to
some of the other students that he knew

taekwondo. These students were interested in learning, and so Chodrow gave his
first class to three ofhis classmates.
"That was the catalyst. We almost
immediately started teaching classes,"
Chodrow said.
Spring semester 2009 served as a turning point for the club as they began intensifying their efforts to become known
across campus through demonstrations
and advertisements. They attempted to
maintain their momentum over the summer, discussing plans and coordinating for the new school year, and
the club started up again
with a more developed
curriculum and with Snew equipment. In the
upcoming
week,
members of the
club will have

Just enjoy the party, people
When the word got out that the annual
Halloween party was to be held in a tent on
Mertz field, a mild uproar surfaced among students who found the idea untenable, most
notably from the residents of Mertz dorm.
Subsequently, the Student Affairs Committee, or
SAC, which is in charge of the party, informed
the student body via e-mail last Saturday that
the venue had been changed to Upper Tarble and
Paces.

The entire episode displayed an apparent disconnect between a decision made that would
affect the entire student body and the student
body itself. Some were quick to blame SAC for
the seemingly shortsighted decision to hold the

Halloween party on Mertz field.
To be sure, there was a problem of a lack of
transparency in the process. While SAC certainly sought out the approval of Mertz's Resident
Assistants
since the first-floor bathrooms
would have to be open to the partying masses
the Mertz residents themselves were not consulted. And it is easy to imagine that at least one
person in the student body at large would have
raised further concerns about holding the
biggest party ofthe semester on Mertz field.
At the same time, there is plenty to commend
in SAC's responsiveness to the student body's
concerns. Furthermore, the explanation provided via e-mail on Saturday clearly showed a wellreasoned process conducted by an astute committee. SAC co-directors Rebecca Commito 'lO
and Shumpei Tse 'lO systematically broke down
the viability of the possible venues, effectively
silencing any opposing murmurs that this place
or that place would have been a better place for
the party.
In fact, further reflection on the whole
process casts doubt on the legitimacy ofany condemnation of SAC at all.
As Commito and Tse pointed out (though not
in so many words) in the e-mail, the Halloween
party is a privilege and not a right. SAC volun-

tarily put forth the immense effort to throw a
party of this magnitude for the benefit of the student body, because no other organization would.
Too often, there is a tendency on campus to pass
judgment without considering the alternatives.
Certainly, each individual has the capacity to
raise objections against anything be it aparty
venue or a contrasting observation but uninformed opposition should never be in order.
Any decision made will invariably attract its
detractors, and this is especially true for this
particular campus. We are pushed to and have a
propensity for making our voice heard, which is
definitely not a mindset without its merits.
Nevertheless, not even the most ideal democracy will be able to guarantee every individual's
input. Thefact of the matter is that SAC is doing
us a favor in organizing the Halloween party,
and by all rights they have total and sole control
over decisions related to it.

If you are a Mertz resident, you are clearly
justified in raising concerns against having the
Mertz field idea. Your lounge, hall and bathrooms, after all, were at risk of being adversely
affected by the process known as "partying." If
you are not, you are out of luck. This was not
your decision to make.
Obviously, there is nothing wrong with voicing an objection
it is only the expectation of
having it be considered every single time that
often leads us astray. Transparency, especially
in a decision-making process that directly
affects students, is definitely imperative. But in
a situation where a committee chooses to extend
a favor that could easily be taken up by any
other student group, there is no call for vitriol
against the organizing body.
As Tse says, "Our main goal is for everyone
to be happy. We don't want to alienate anyone."
And though some mistakes were arguably committed, it does not seem like there is much to
complain about regarding SAC's decisions. It is
Halloween, after all. Be safe and enjoy the party.

letter

to

the

editor

Vote Rick Lowe for mayor
To the Editor:
This letter tells you to vote for Rick Lowe for mayor of Swarthmore.

We know what you're thinking: "I know what's coming all politics
is local, every election matters, make your voice heard. But come on
I'm not from Swarthmore. I'm just a student here for a few years. How
does the mayor of Swarthmore really matter to me? I don't even know
who the mayor is!" We could remind you how good it felt to stand in line
last November to cast your vote for change in the Presidential election.
"Sure," you would respond, "but that was a world-changing election.
Who really cares about the mayor of Swarthmore?"
So think about it this way: If you're like most Swarthmore students,
you probably think that the election Qf President Obama was a great
moment for our country. But how much has your life changed since he
was elected? The fact is, while the national government is more visible,
it's the local governments that we have the most interaction with in our
daily lives. That's why we at College Democrats have endorsed and are
encouraging you to vote for Rick Lowe for mayor.
Rick first approached College Dems last year, telling us that he wanted to run a campaign based on bringing the college and town communities closer together. Since then, he's proven sincere in his attentiveness
to the student community. Some of you reading this may have met him
yourselves at Sharpies earlier this week or at the College Dems' weekly
meeting on Tuesday. Adopting a key college concern, he has made a campaign issue out of making Swarthmore a greener town and has suggested creating internships in the Ville to bring students into local government. Moreover, Rick would be the first Democratic mayor of
Swarthmore and a rare Democratic leader in Delaware County, which
has been controlled by Republicans for the last century. If you're seeking
a more constructive relationship with our neighbors outside the bubble
or want to strike a blow against one of the oldest Republican machines
in the country, Rick Lowe is your man.
Still not convinced? Consider this: The chief of police reports to the
mayor. Wouldn't you rather have a mayor who understands the concerns of students?
Rick Lowe will be on campus around lunch and dinner this weekend.
If you see him, ask him about local government or the election and you'll
find him eager to talk. The election will be held next week, on Tuesday,
November 3, and College Democrats will be at Parrish Circle providing
information about polling locations and transportation to the polls. We
hope to see you there.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she is "a fan

Democrats should really be less modest about their talents. I know it's been

President Obama took office, but doesn't anyone remember the Bush years?

2005,
In
January
Democratic
National
Committee
Chairman Howard Dean explained on
"Meet
the
NBC's
Press"
that
Republicans are "evil" and said "I hate
the Republicans and everything they
stand for." After all, according to Dean,
"It's a struggle of good and evil, and
we're the good."
But progressives' disrespect doesn't
stop there. In 2004, everyone's National
Public Radio favorite, Garrison Keillor,
called Republicans "freelance racists,
misanthropic frat boys, nihilists in golf
pants, brownshirts in pinstripes, sweatshop tycoons, hacks [and] fakirs." Betty
Williams, an Irish Nobel Peace Prize
recipient, said in 2006, "I have a very
hard time with this word 'non-violence'
[because] right now, I would love to kill
George Bush." (Here I was thinking all
recipients deserved this prestigious
award!)

And to top it all off, then-CBS talkshow host Craig Kilborn showed then-

Texas Governor George W. Bush delivering his acceptance speech at the 2000
Republican National Convention with
the words "SNIPERS WANTED" twinkling at the bottom of the screen.
Although it's understandable why
Democrats might want to forget the
Bush years, they surely cannot forget
the "ugly campaigns" they waged during the Bush years, when protestors
threw Molotov cocktails in the streets,
dressed as suicide bombers and waved
signs thatread "Death to America!" and
"Bush is a psychotic murderer." This
summer's rowdy town hall meetings on
health care don't seem so bad in comparison.

To many, Obama's presidency seems
entirely distinct from the Bush admin-

istration, but there is some resemblance. Similar to the Bush years, moderate Americans and some on the
fringe, for many reasons, are concerned
about and often frightened by legislation being debated in Washington. They
want to get in on the national conversation.
But unlike the Bush administration,
which by the end ignored nearly all criticism, the Obama administration, in
classic Chicago style, is doing nearly
the opposite by taking a much more
aggressive tone against critics.
President Obama's pledge to "bring
in a new era of bipartisanship and
mutual respect" has evaporated. Early
month,
this
White
House
Communications Director Anita Dunn
ridiculed Fox News Corporation on
CNN's "Reliable Sources," claiming
that it is "opinion journalism masquerading as news" and "operates
almost as either the research arm or the
communications arm of the Republican
Party." White House Chief of Staff
Rahm Emanuel echoed Dunn's comments on CNN's "State of the Union,"
saying that "[Fox] is not
a legitimate
news organization."
Although hosts like Glenn Beck and
Bill O'Reilly have been very critical of
the new administration, the White
House's efforts aren't really against Fox
News, but rather all public media. By
tying Fox News to the Republican Party,
the White House has put a popularly
...

despised face to its political opposition
and separated it from "real" media, like
CNN. The more members of "legitimate
media" distance themselves from Fox
News' dissenting opinions, the more
access the White House will invariably
grant them. But as opposing voices get
less access, the clearer it will become to
critics that the administration's ideas
can't hold up in debate.
The administration doesn't want
compromise; it wants control.
Of course, this isn't the first time an
administration has limited access to
those who hold unfavorable viewpoints.
In 2004, the New York Times complained that Vice President Dick
Cheney limited their access to his private plane because of the administration's dissatisfaction with their news
coverage.

With significant legislation being
debated on the Hill, dissent is more
important than ever. (I can't believe I'm

Obama's stimulus package, which is
supposed to create 3.5 million jobs by
the end of next year, misses the mark by
over five million jobs based on unemployment statistics released by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics last
Thursday. This error is substantial.
Don't worry, though: White House economic advisor Jared Bernstein says
that "early indications are quite positive" and "exceed expectations."
This week, Treasury Department
Inspector

Administration released a report
explaining how a provision of the stimulus package, which entitles first-time

of fundamental changes that would be
necessary to reduce the trajectory of
federal health spending by a significant
amount." (The CBO was still analyzing
the current proposal as we went to
press.) And the Baucus bill's $Bl billion
in deficit reduction actually comes from
increasing Social Security taxes and
making big cuts in Medicare that probably won't materialize.
Even CBS is skeptical of government-run health care. Last Sunday, "60
Minutes" reported on the Medicare
fraud industry that cheats taxpayers
out of $6O billion a year because
budget
Medicare's oversight
is
"extremely limited," according to Kim
Brandt, Medicare's director of program
integrity. Given that Fox News covered
this story in early October, was the "60
Minutes'" report not news, but commentary?

Either way, with 57 percent of voters
saying health care reform will increase
costs and 53 percent saying it will
reduce quality of care, according to
Monday's Rasmussen poll, the administration's attacks against Fox aren't so
surprising.

The list goes on. President Obama is
far from finished with Iran, a country
that still professes interest in international cooperation so as to buy more
time to secretly enrich uranium to
build a nuclear weapon.
The new
Obama era of transparency has left the
EPA, the organization that models
Congressional climate proposals, without details on the Boxer-Kerry cap-andtrade plan it's supposed to evaluate.
Recall the tight campaign Ms. Dunn
helped President Obama run last fall. In
reference to the media coverage of the
campaign, Ms. Dunn explained, "We
controlled it as opposed to the press
controlled [sic] it."
Fox News seems like a worthy target,
but Americans cannot allow the administration to disguise what's really going
on. The cable media market, especially
in the age of the Internet, makes propagating lies more difficult. If a news
organization files an erroneous and particularly notorious report, it's likely
competing news organizations will try
to profit from their competitor's error.
Even in 2000, before the Internet played
a large role, the media's response to
Kilborn's inappropriate editorial on
CBS prompted CBS to issue an apology
the next day.
The answer isn't to silence critics.
While claims that national health
reform mandates "death panels" and
conspiracy theories that the US government engineered the 9/11 attacks are
unproductive, it's important that we
hear criticism so we may try to objectively judge and respond to it. If Fox
News or any other news organization
consistently makes extreme attacks
against the Obama administration, then
most consumers will turn to a different
news source, of which there are many.
Like Democrats, Republicans want to
pass meaningful reform, but they want
to do so with a "post-partisan" party
that's genuinely interested in people's
ideas. Given how much health care
reform and climate change policy alone
will, affect the economy, the vigorous
debate we've seen is unsurprising. But
we'll get nowhere by shutting out the
critics. Call me quixotic.

players that can score, which

Alyssa Bowie 'l2 also finds

Though the Garnet was
unable to find the back of the
net against the Fords, another
bright spot for the Garnet has
been the emergence of Ariana
Spiegel 'l3 as a star defender.
Last week, Spiegel helped

the Garnet shut out Ursinus 2-0

goal in its 3-1 victory. Spiegel
became the second member of

Spiegel is used to the limelight. As a four-year varsity
starter, she won three state

"[Spiegel] has been really

added. "[Spiegel] plays with a

The volleyball team's record six conference wins have ensured a trip to the Centennial
Conference playoffs. Swarthmore hadn't reached the postseason since 2005.

BY TIMOTHY BERNSTEIN

tbernstl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore volleyball team's
season-high five-game winning streak
came to an end Saturday with a
straight-sets road loss at Gettysburg.
It was the first loss for Swarthmore
since Oct. 8, with a final score of 25-20,
25-19, 25-20.

"It was a competitive match; even
though the final score didn't necessarily show it, it was point-for-point every
set, until [Gettysburg] ran away with it
in that last set," head coach Harleigh
Chwastyk said after the match. "[The
Gettysburg players] are a little bit bigger [and] they were in their gym, but at
the same time, we certainly didn't execute to'the best of our ability."
Genny Pezzola 'l2 led the team with
13 kills and Hillary Santana 12 added 15
digs on defense, but all three sets ended
in Gettysburg's favor.

Bullets seniorKristina Mercier posted an even dozen kills and eight digs
with a team-best .524 attack percentage.
The victory was the sixth straight for
Gettysburg.
While the Garnet came into the
match confident, having racked up a
five-game winning streak of their own,
the matchup history between the two
teams remains extremely lopsided.
With the win Saturday, Gettysburg
improved to 28-0 all-time against the
Garnet volleyball team, an incredible
streak of dominance for a collegiate
program.
"[The Gettysburg program] is a
championship program. At one point
they won five conference titles in a
row," Chwastyk said.
"There's a championship tradition
for volleyball there, and it's been that
way for a long time, while [Swarthmore
volleyball] is just reaching that level
now," she added.
While it is only the second straightsets defeat of the season for the Garnet
(the first having come against Richard
Stockton on Sept. 26), Saturday's defeat
came at a much more critical point in

THE P.HOENIX

the season with only two games left to

play.

Swarthmore (18-7, 6-2 CC) left
Gettysburg tied with the Bullets for
third place
in the Centennial
Conference standings.
However, yesterday's conference
action brought a bigger consolation for
the Garnet. Despite dropping a 3-0 decision to No. 25 Haverford (27-3, 9-0 CC), a
loss by McDaniel (16-11, 5-4 CC) gave

Swarthmore sole occupancy of the
fourth slot in the conference standings,
meaning that even a loss against
Franklin & Marshall (22-5, 8-1 CC) will
leave the Garnet no lower than fifth.
The top five teams will play in the
conference championship tournament.
"Defense first, always," Chwastyk
said when asked what she planned to
emphasize this week in preparation for
play against the top teams in the conference.
"A focus on digging, focus on passing, and also serve-receive, which is
how ball control starts. We also want to
make sure we play up-tempo and control the pace of the game," she added.
"The way it's stacked up, we're playing the top three teams in the conference to finish the season," Chwastyk
continued.
Indeed, these final two games are
anything but pushovers; but they give
Swarthmore invaluable tune-up as the
playoffs loom large.
"It's great preparation for the playoffs," Chwastyk said.

pitcher Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles
Dodgers did in Game One of the 1965 World

Series.
Why? Simple.
It was Yom Kippur. Sandy Koufax was a
Jew.
And Jews do not work on the holiest day
of the year, even if your work is pitching in
one of the biggest Major League Baseball
games of the year.
Whether it was because it was so unbelievable that anyone would choose not to
play in the World Series, or because of the

when he was pulled in the third inning

days.
As a Jewish athlete, I have faced the same
decisions
on an obviously much smaller
and less publicized scale
that Koufax had
to make when Jewish holidays conflicted
with important games.
But as the only Jew on my soccer team for
years growing up, there was no way my
protests would warrant a change in the
game schedule, and I knew there was no way
they would change my mother's opinion on
whether going to synagogue was optional.
While this might have been the case in
high school, I never imagined that religious
conflicts would be an issue coming to such a
diverse and considerate school as
Swarthmore.
Yet sophomore year, I found myself and a
teammate in the locker room, peanut butter
and jelly, sandwiches in hand, watching the
sun set to mark the end of our 24-hour fast
before starting in a game 30 minutes later.
Not ideal playing conditions.
And this has by no means been a unique
experience. Again this year, the women's
soccer team had a game on the high holidays, this time on Rosh Hashanah.

The Centennial Conference was founded on the principle that the institutions "agree to establish an all-sports conference in the spirit of rationalizing
our competition by controlling travel, schedule and costs. Within an atmosphere of integrity and mutual trust, the member institutions pledge their commitment to the purpose and mission of the conference."
As members of Division 111, the Conference members place special importance on the impact of athletics on the participants rather than on spectators
and place greater emphasis on the internal constituency than on the general
public and its entertainment needs.
Membership in the Centennial Conference has its rewards and its responsibilities. The Conference was established in a setting of mutual respect and
confidence among the members of the Conference as institutions having a
common dedication to the purposes and principles of higher education. The
Conference enables member institutions to control athletic priorities through

especially shocking considering it is explicitly against the Centennial

Conference rules.
In the 2009-2010 Centennial Conference
Manual, it clearly states "Conference competition may not be scheduled on religious holidays."

Yet for the last two years, much to my
chagrin, it has been, and it does not look like
things are going to change: The conference
is attempting to schedule yet another conference game on Yom Kippur for next year.
This scheduling conflict has lead to a long

cooperation on athletic travel, schedules and costs.
As each member institution provides its students the resources and opportunities to excel in the classroom, so do they wish to provide student-athletes
with the resources and opportunities to excel and compete on a Conference
and national level.
The members ought to look primarily within the
Conference for standards of competitive excellence and, for most sports, ought
to measure success or failure in competition with each other.

The Presidents' Council encourages the following standards for
Conference master scheduling:
The Conference master schedules are drafted by the Executive
Director, pending approval from the Administrative Delegates.
Centennial Conference regular-season competition should be
scheduled in the latter portion of the season.
Conference competition will take precedence over non-Conference
competition in scheduling. Special considerations for "traditional
opponents," or out-of-region tournament competition may be
requested and an effort will be made to accommodate such requests.
Every effort should be made to arrange schedules to enable teams
in different sports to travel together to the same opponent.

the tedious process of rescheduling a conference match, requiring weeks of emails and

I understand that there are far more religious Christians than Jews that play in our
conference, and I am not arguing that the
conference should start playing games on
Sundays instead of Saturdays so Jewish ath-

letes can observe the Sabbath.
But it is not unreasonable to ask that
Jewish athletes not be forced to choose
between 4;heir sport and their religion on the
two most holy days of the year for them, especially since it appears that the Conference
rules say they should not have to.
Just as a game would never be scheduled
on Easter or Christmas morning, games
should not be scheduled on Yom Kippur or
Rosh Hashanah as a league-wide policy,
whether there are known Jewish athletes on
the competing teams or not.
Schedules are arranged long before the
religious affiliations of the incoming class of
athletes are known, and thus the league
should not risk the potential conflict.
