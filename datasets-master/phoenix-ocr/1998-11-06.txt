Swat's capital projects addressed
New residence hall, student
center discussed with DuPont,
Parrish, McCabe renovations
by Anne Hoang

Contributing Writer

Last Friday's Collection

presented current progress con-

cerning the five high-priced
projects in consideration: the
complete renovations of
DuPont, McCabe, and Parrish,
a new residence hall, and a new
student center. For the past year,
a committee of fifteen members,
composed of students, faculty
administration, and staff, have
met to review Swarthmore's priorities in terms of large capital
projects for the next 10-15
years.
These proposals, in total,
amount to more than $2OO million in production costs, which
"exceeds our wildest dreams in
terms of fundraising money in
campaigns," noted Larry Schall,
VicePresident for Facilities and
Services. "We have to sort out
our priorities and determine the
scopes for each project."
The Collection featured five
representatives from the smaller
committees in charge of each
project.
Lynne Molter, who represented DuPont, outlined the
building's main difficulties,
which include poor air circula,

tion, some offices without air
conditioning, leaking roofs, bad
plumbing, and a lack of classrooms. Moreover, according to
Molter, DuPont's general space
limitations present difficulties
for the two departments housed
there, Math/Statistics and
Chemistry. In order to create
adequate space for these departments, the college would have
to not only completely renovate
DuPont, but also add a structure
of 30,000 to 35,000 square feet
(for comparison, Trotter Hall is
30,000 square feet). With such
a massive addition, other science-oriented departments
would have a greater physical
connection to DuPont and benefit from the increased lab
space.
McCabe representative
Peggy Seiden pointed out that
library use has radically
changed since McCabe's inception in the 1960'5. With the increasing reliance on computer
and multi-media resources,
there is an urgent need for additional lines for equipment and
more adequate lighting. According to Seiden, McCabe has
already exceeded the maximum
number of books it can hold; the
library is already being forced

Staffing decisions face
slowed implementation
by Nate Myers and Eric
Freedman
Contributing Writers
Recommendations collected from last semester's
Long-Range Planning Subgroup on Staffing (SPSG) meetings are making slow headway,
but progress nonetheless. Gathered from those staff, students
and faculty who attended the
open SPSG meetings last spring,
the recommendations included
evaluating and changing the
staff's grievance procedure, expanding the role of the Equal
Opportunity officer, increasing
benefits and wages, reorganizing staff governance, diversifying all levels of the staff, improving a staff tuition-reimbursement program, and examining the possibility of offering
on-campus child care for college
staff.
After last semester's meetings, Barbara Carroll, Director
of Human Resources, compiled
a summary of the subgroup's
recommendations, which were
then distributed to the members
of SPSG in June. According to
Paul Aslanian, Vice President
for Finance and Planning, a few
of those recommendations
which were relatively inexpensive and easy to implement have
already been realized. The Corn-

mittee on Staff Procedures
(COSP), which formerly represented staff members and their
concerns, was reorganized into
the Staff Advisory Committee
(SAC). SAC is largely self-governing; unlike COSP, the Director of Human Resources no
longer convenes committee
meetings or sets its agenda.
"They've made good changes in
the structure of the group," says
Judy Lord, administrative assistant for the Department of Music and Dance and a member of
SAC. "It runs itself more, and
is less dependent on Human
Resources." In-house staff training programs have also been
added, and the grievance procedure is currently being revised.
Evaluating changes to the
grievance procedure is now the
focus ofactivity for SAC and the
Equal Opportunity Advisory
Committee (EOAC). Last year,
according to Professor Peter
Schmidt (previously the chair
and currently a member of the
EOAC), members of the committee attended the open staffing meetings and gathered staff
feedback about the current
grievance procedure, which had
not been altered since 1967. The
committee then came to a virtual consensus about needing to

Attempted break-in reported at
WSRN; no valuables stolen
by Tom Stepleton
Contributing Writer
A window in the WSRN
technical office and an adjacent
window in the stairwell leading
to Parrish sth were broken from
their hinges early on the morning of October 30. Nothing was
stolen from the office, and it has
not been determined whether
the acts were intentional.
WSRN's general manager
Chris DiLeo '99 was broadcasting at the time of the break-in,
which he estimated at 2:15 a.m.
"About fifteen minutes into
my show, Rory [Alarcon, a
WSRN staff member] comes
over and says, 'We just heard
something crash over in the tech
office, maybe you should come
check it out,'" said DiLeo.

A quick look into the room
revealed the damaged window
but no missing items. DiLeo
then called WSRN program director Kevin Schlottman to notify Public Safety. No one was
in the technical office at the time
of the break-in, and the identity
of the perpetrator remains unknown.
The technical office is used
to repair WSRN equipment and
does not have access to the
WSRN studios, music libraries,
or business office. According to
DiLeo, the office did not contain anything particularly valuable. Neither he nor Public
Safety would speculate why the
break-in occurred.
"We didn't think they were
breaking in to take anything,"
DiLeo said.

impeded by dual membership.
Ryan Peterson '99 agreed
with Sajdera's proposal of the
amendment, having served on
both groups last semester, but
saw the central issue somewhat
differently.
According to Peterson, it
really makes no difference
whether a conflict of interest
exists, the perception that one
exists is enough. Peterson said
that groups who keep seeing the
same faces in all of the campus'
governing bodies become uneasy and it would make them
more comfortable to remove this
overlap.
In order to make an amendment to the Student Council
constitution, Sajdera will first
have to publicize it to the student body. He will be available
this Monday at 8:30 p.m. in
Parrish Parlours to answer questions and address concerns regarding the amendment.
The amendment will then

Coffee bar reinstates night hours
by David King
Staff Writer
This past Wednesday, the
Kohlberg coffee bar was open
during the evening for the first
time since last year.
The coffee bar was not open
Thursday night, however, due to
College scheduling.
The new hours, from 7-10
p.m., will be in effect every
Wednesday and Thursday for the
foreseeable future, according to
Laurie Dibeler, Manager in Cash
Operations for Dining Services.
Evening hours were tried last
year for a period of time, but the
idea lacked the support to continue. However, now that Dibeler
has assumed her present position
within Dining Services, she plans
to work toward making nighttime operation a success.
"I'd like to see it continue,
and meet and exceed expectations," said Dibeler.
When asked whether she
would be receptive to having
musicians play in the lounge or
other incentives to bring students, she responded, "I'm open
to anything."
Since the Bean Bag,
Swarthmore's lone cafe, closed
last year, the town has lacked the
presence of a coffee house. The
Kohlberg coffee bar has filled
the need only until 4:00 p.m. on
weekdays, leaving some students without a much-needed
resource in the evenings.
For this reason, one student,
who wished not to be identified,
views the coffee bar's operations
as tailored toward faculty. He
noted that when they leave for the
day, the coffee bar closes, leaving students like him stranded at
the end of an afternoon seminar.

Whether the coffee bar's
new hours will attract a significant student following remains
to be seen. Wednesday night,
however, saw a relatively low
turnout.
At 8 p.m., about half a
dozen students were scattered
throughout the Kohlberg
lounge. Shortly after 10 o'clock,
four could be seen sitting, each
with a cup nearby, while one
more stood at the counter.
Michelle Hartel, a Food
Service worker who will be
manning the coffee bar both
evenings each week, had trouble
passing the time Wednesday and
said she would like to see a more

lively atmosphere in the coming
weeks.
"I'd be glad to see [more
students] come," said Hartel.
One student who sat in the
lounge on Wednesday night
thought the evening hours were a
worthwhile move by the college.
"People like to have a place
to get coffee at night," she said.

Kevin Schlottman 'OO agreed.
"Coffee before seminar is

Dibleler offered the idea of
having students work behind the
counter at times, citing other
colleges, where students are
hired to work in food service.
She concedes, though, that it
might be difficult to find responsible students to fit the position.
Swarthmore Dining Services currently employs no students from the college on a daily
basis, but does use them for catering, said Dibeler.

Iraqi threats warrant
greater U.S. response
by Joon Suk Choi

Contributing Writer

Iraq's latest refusal to comply with United Nations arms
inspectors is not only a sign of
Saddam Hussein's growing
boldness but of our own ineptitude.
Since the end of the Persian
Gulf War, our relations with Iraq
have been marked by a series of
confrontations. Reflecting upon
these conflicts, both past and
current, this writer cannot help
but come to the conclusion that
our greatest error has been the
continuing weakness of our responses.
Let us examine the crisis
at hand. We must consider the
fact that Iraq's disarmament
was only deemed necessary
after its defeat in a war of aggression that it had initiated.
As of this moment, Saddam
Hussein still possesses enough
stockpiles of chemical and
biological weapons to wipe
out the Earth's populations
several times over.
His proven willingness to
use such weapons against his
neighbors, American soldiers,
even his own people, dictates
that they must be removed. Yet,
in trying to accomplish this task,
the United States has all too often found itself in the illogical
position of having terms dictated to it by the nation which
supposedly lost the Gulf War.
There exists only one rationale
for this: our seeming inability,
or perhaps unwillingness, to utilize necessary force.
The sad fact of the matter is
that, over the past few years,
American responses to Iraqi offenses have been negligent, even
contemptible. Increasing Iraqi
hostility towards UN weapons
inspectors has generally been
answered with diplomatic protests and huge, expensive shows
ofrallying troops that no one has
the political will to use.
Even the greatest aggression of all, an attempt to assassinate former President George
Bush, evoked from us a military
strike so minute as to cause no
permanent damage within the
Iraqi infrastructure. Given such
weak responses, one can not
blame Saddam Hussein for his
ever-present eagerness to disre-

November 6,1998

gard the rules.
The time to act has long
since passed. Americans face a
long and difficult road ahead of
them in regaining the prestige
and credibility that Hussein has
cost them. That the world's sole
remaining superpower, with all
the resources at its disposal, can
fail to tame one two-bit dictator
is inexcusable. We can, however, start out on the path to redemption by acting appropriately through this current conflict.
I shall make this short and
simple: no more negotiations
and no more Kofi Annans. Iraq
has an obligation to fulfill its
past agreements concerning
arms inspectors.
In truth, considering how
many times we have yielded in
the past, the current obligations that Iraq has are far too
lax already. If Saddam
Hussein continues to prevent
arms inspectors from fulfilling
their duty, we must be ready
to reply with a military strike
that even this arrogant dictator cannot ignore.
Should such a strike prove
necessary, the ideal option
would be to limit our attacks to
air strikes on suspected weapons sites and Iraqi conventional
forces. We must, however, be
prepared to go even further as
the situation requires. The possibility of placing a large military ground force within Iraqi
borders, perhaps* to force access
to restricted areas for arms inspectors, is one we should keep
alive as a remote consideration.
There are those who would
deem such responses too drastic. History, however, has taught
us that our greatest enemy is
complacency. From the attack
on Pearl Harbor to the bombings
of our embassies in Africa,
Americans have paid the price
for assuming that they would
never become the victims.
Although we Swatties feel
secure within the borders of our
$30,000-a-year school, we must
not rule out the possibility that
those weapons being manufactured in Iraq may be destined for
us. The only sure way to prevent
this is to see that they are destroyed through any means necessary.

Glenn trades honor, values for shuttle ride
by Charles Fiscette
Contributing Writer
On February 20,1962, John
Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth,and a hero
to millions of Americans. He
was the cream of the crop
among the group of those select
men destined to become the first
American ambassadors to another world.

hire a full time Equal Opportunity (EO) officer, who would
settle grievance disputes. The
committee shared theirproposal
with President Bloom, who
agreed to delay hiring a parttime officer until the college
could come to consensus on the
nature of the position.
Most colleges similar to
Swarthmore in size and structure, including Amherst, Williams, Haverford, and Bryn
Mawr, already have a full time
EO officer. Presently, the
college's EO officer is only a
20% of full-time position, and
is limited to settling EO disputes
involving discrimination, as defined by federal law. The advantage of a full time position,
Schmidt explained, is that the
EO officer would be on par with
other members of the senior
staff and separate from the rest
of Human Resources. Many
staff members feel that a full
time EO position would give
them a more confidential process for handling grievance
claims, one which would not
hinder their chances of receiving raises or promotions.
Carroll explained that under
the present grievance procedure,
staff take their claims to the
Employer Relations Committee,
which is part of Human Resources. "It's kind of a catch-22," she explained. "Staff don't
want to go directly to their supervisor, but if they never do
then it is unlikely that the problem will ever get solved." Furthermore, many staff members
do not understand the process
for filing a complaint. Carroll is
currently writing a new staff
handbook which will make the
grievance procedure much more
accessible and understandable
for the staff, and she hopes to
present a revised version of the
procedure to the college com-

munity during the next few
weeks.
Since the
process
began last spring, only the
administration's senior staff and
Human Resources have been
involved in actually rewriting
the procedure. "I didn't want to
put out a policy that senior staff
didn't support right offthe bat,"
Carroll said. On the other hand,
she remarked, Carroll wanted
the final draft to represent all of
the constituencies on campus,
including students, exempt staff,
and non-exempt staff. Staff
members who work in "non-exempt" positions, such as facilities management and environmental services, earn hourly
wages instead of salaries. These
non-exempt staff members are
typically underrepresented in
college committees. Only one
non-exempt staff member, for
instance, sat on the SPSG until
February 1998, when the committee membership was restructured.
Once EOAC and SAC receive the revised grievance procedure, these committees will
begin gathering feedback from
exempt and non-exempt staff, as
well as faculty and students.
Despite such efforts, some staff
and students feel that the grievance procedure would be more
effectively rewritten through a
collaboration of the entire college community.

if the current structure forrevising the procedure contradicts the
college's value of consensus.
"True consensus would be forming a committee that represents
all the constitutive groups, including people from food service and environmental services, other non-exempt and
exempt staff, interested students, faculty, and senior staff.
Instead what we have is a pro-

cedure basically written by senior staff."
Meanwhile, the EOAC has
had to cope with a change in
committee membership over the
summer, including a new chair,
Professor Steve O'Connell. As
of last week, the new members
had neither received the revised
grievance procedure nor reached
consensus about whether or not
the EO officer should be a full
time position. President Bloom
has already allocated money for
the position in order to extend
the deadline for a final decision
beyond the College Budget
Committee meeting in early
December.
"President Bloom has
helped us quite considerably on
that end," says O'Connell. "If
we haven't seen the new grievance procedure, how can we
meet to discuss it? President
Bloom has essentially removed
that logjam for us."
While the expansion of the
EO position and reexamination
ofthe grievance procedure have
received the bulk of the college's
attention during the last few
months, otherrecommendations
gathered from the SPSG meetings have not. Aslanian observes that approving all of the
recommendations will cost
twice as much as is currently
available in the college's projected budget.
Consequently, many of
these recommendations, including those regarding benefits,
staff compensation, and the tuition-reimbursement program,
cannot be adopted as college
policy until they have been reviewed by SAC, EOAC, and
other advisory committees.
After the committees gather
feedback and evaluate the recommendations, they will prioritize and redraft the proposals for
consideration by President
Bloom and other members of
the College Planning Commit-

tee, a group composed of ad-

ministration,
and students. Pending approval at that
level, the recommendations will
be submitted to the Board of
Managers forfinal approval and
funding.
While some of the recommendations may be expensive,
in Aslanian's view, none of the
proposals for change were very
controversial. "Last year, when
the committee met and theirrecommendations were drafted, I
never felt we were treading on
any controversial ground. Is it
controversial to adequately
compensate people for their
work? No. That's about as controversial as baseball, mom, and
apple pie."
Gallagher disagrees. On the
committee I was on," she said,
"the staff opinions were virtually unanimous about needing a
full time EO officer. However,
it's obvious that there's some
controversy, because that issue
is still being debated by senior
staff and other committees, and
hasn't yet been implemented."
During the spring of 1998,
the college held a series of open
meetings for the purposes ofreviewing long range plans. The
SPSG's open meetings attracted
an unexpectedly high response
from staff members, prompting
several changes in location to
accommodate what eventually
amounted to three hundred-plus
students, staff, and faculty in
attendance.
Kae Kalwaic, the administrative assistant for the Program
in Education, approved of the
large turnout at last year's meetings. "The big meeting had crosscampus constituencies: staff, facstudents,
senior
ulty,
staff...everybody was there. That
was consensus, the ultimate in
consensus. I don'tknow how you
can get betterthan that. The problem is, how do you implement
the recommendations?"

Budget Committee debates use of old van
by Josh Bess
Contributing Writer

In its meeting last Sunday,
Student Budget Committee
again considered the purchase of
a new Student Council Van.
While the committee voted
unanimously to purchase a new
vehicle for about $24,000, an active debate began Which was
focused on the fate of the "old"
van, 16A.
In his original proposal, Student Council Van Coordinator
Dennis Cheng 'Ol introduced
this new van as areplacement for
16A, which would be traded-in
for a $2500 rebate on the new
van. While Student Council did
approve the purchase of a new
van, debate still continues on
whether 16A could have a useful role as a local shuttle.
The responsibilities of the
Van Coordinator include acting
as the contact person for van
rentals as well as keeping a close
eye on the condition in which
the vans are returned by students
who rent them. Cheng expressed
concern that Van 16A, which is
the black sheep anyway compared to its two newer, sleeker
companions, was really starting

show its age.
The 1990 Ford van is approaching the 100,000-mile
mark. While it may not seem
that the van is very old or has
too many miles, conditions of
use for many short trips have
been especially hard on the vehicle. Therefore, Cheng decided
to make a proposal for the purchase of a new van to replace
16A. He presented his proposal
to Student Council and was advised to speak with Student
Budget Committee first.
When Cheng presented the
proposal to SBC on October
25th, committee members decided that committal to such a
large expenditure for a single
item was a not a decision to be
taken lightly. They elected to
send an all-campus e-mail, asking for student input, before
making a final decision.
All SBC meetings are open
to the public and the committee
welcomes and desires student
input and reactions; this was not
the first time in recent history
that such a direct approach was
used. Last year, while considering the purchase of new projectors for Movie Committee,
both an all-campus e-mail and
to

informal surveys were used to
gauge student sentiment.
Rochelle Laws 'Ol, who
coordinated this survey, said,
"Since it is such a huge expenditure, it is important to get student opinion."
Shereported 160 responses;
123 for and 37 against. Those
in favor cited such reasons as
safety concerns and convenience, while students who were
opposed generally wanted to see
the money spent on other things.
With the results of this straw
poll in mind, SBC reached consensus to buy a new van. SBC
Assistant Treasurer and observer of the meeting Laura
Farra 'Ol was happy about this.
"The capital replacement money
from which the van will be
bought is exactly for this sort of
situation. It's good to see it
used."
Student Council approved
the proposal at their Thursday
meeting. The wheels have been
set in motion for the purchase
of a new Student Council Van.
It will be a few weeks before the vehicle is actually in the
parking lot, though. Student

Wednesday evening at 6:15
p.m. in the large room of
Sharpies, members of the Diversity coalition and other interested
students held a "Sharpies Walk
Out" in protest of the current national movement towards the abolition of affirmative action.
While many students had
been made aware of the event
through messages to SAO,
SASA, and HOLA leaders, other
students were first notified by an
all-campus e-mail Wednesday
morning which said "6:15 tonight. Sharpies. Large Room."
Shirin Ali 'OO began the demonstration by addressing the
crowd from atop a table in the
middle of the large room of
Sharpies. Ali asked students to
look around at the diversity ofthe
present crowd, then listed the current statistics on minority-student
enrollment at Swarthmore. A
lumber of minority students,
who had been given cards before-

hand, then left the room in order
to illustrate more closely the
college's racial make-up of a decade ago.
Elizabeth Lindsey 'O2, Tanya
Wansom 'O2, and Lorrin Nelson
'OO then each took a turn speaking from tables in other parts of
the room, giving parallel statistics
for students of color in previous
decades. As each speaker listed
these numbers, another pre-selected group of minority students
rose and exited the room. The student speakers also addressed the
problems affirmative action was
created to address, touching on
the Civil Rights Act of 1965, a
SASS sit-in in the admissions office in '6B, and the increase of
women professors at the college
in the 1980's.
A momentary distraction occurred when a Sharpies employee
approached Ali near the beginning of her speech and asked her
to come down from the table. Ali
hesitated, and in what several observers characterized as an extremely tense moment, the crowd

began to jeerand boo the Sharpies
worker. Eventually the demonstrators held their ground, but as
one student noted, "For a few seconds, it seemed like the confrontation might escalate and get out
of hand."
According to Diversity Coalition affiliate Eric Freedman '99,
the event had been cleared with
the Sharpies staff beforehand.
However, the organizers had
originally planned to use a microphone instead of standing on
tables, but were unable to acquire
it by the time of the walk out.
Organizers of the demonstration
did not express any resentment
later toward the staff member's
request. "I'm sure he was just
doing his job," said Freedman.
The walk-out, explained Diversity Coalition Co-Coordinator
Tina Gourd, was in part a response to recent state and national
anti-affirmative legislation.
California's Proposition 209,
which passed a few years ago, has
since caused a sharp decline in
minority enrollment in the State's

To stay within budget, last
week the Forum for a Free Press
reduced this year's funding for
all student publications. The
across-the-board 13.824-percent cut came after the Forum
had already cut some publications' initial funding requests.
This is the first year the Forum determined individual publications' budgets and funded
them with a lump sum for publications approved by Budget
Committee. In previous years,
each publication applied directly to Budget Committee for
funding.
Even with cuts in initial
funding requests, the total
spending for publications would
have been $9,625 over the
$60,000 approved by Budget
Committee, and so the Forum
decided to make the further, uniform cut of almost 14 percent.
For some publications, the
combined cuts were severe.
Jeroen vanDer Hoeven 'OO,
editor of Small Craft Warnings,
said the Forum told the editors
at the beginning of the semester
that their entire request would
be approved. The two cuts left
the literary magazine with 43
percent of its $8,500 request.
When Budget Committee announced the cut, said van Der
Hoeven, SCW had already made
a printing contract.
According
to
Nick
Attanasio 'OO, publications coordinator, the FFFP was adjusting to a new system. The Forum
approved the $8,500 for SCW
before planning the entire budget. When there was not enough
of the $60,000 left for other publications, the Forum met with
the staff again to reduce SCWs
allocation to $5,200. That
amount was then cut by the uniform 14 percent. "It was a procedural error but the Forum
thought it was the right thing to
do," Attanasio said.
Wednesday night the FFFP
rejected an SCW appeal of the
Forum's funding level and the
staff is now planning an appeal
to Budget Committee for more
funding. In the meantime, the
editors are seeking alternative
sources of funding for next semester and are planning to limit
this semester's book to about 40
pages. "In all other respects the
[fall] book will be the same in
quality," van Der Hoeven promised.
At issue in SCWs appeal
was whether the magazine could
produce two issues this year
with the $4,481 FFFP granted.
Forum members said that would
have been enough to produce
one issue a semester, but because SCWs editors planned the
fall book with a larger budget in
mind there may not be enough
money for SCW to produce a
second book this year.

maintenance schedules.
As a final note, several
members of SBC thought it unfortunate that the old van was
going to be traded in without
consideration for other possible
uses. It was brought to the attention of the committee that SC
was considering the possibility
of providing a shuttle service to
movie theaters or malls on the
weekend.
That, in addition to the fact
that one ofthe vans is co-owned
by the Peaslee Debate Society
and is used by them on the
weekend (leaving only two), led
to a discussion about the feasibility of keeping 16A for local
use. Dean Tedd Goundie, Asst.
Dean Davirah Timm-Dinkins
and Jim McKenna, who oversees the maintenance of the
vans, are currently being consulted by SBC because many
factors, including upkeep, insurance and parking, have to be
considered before it is clear

Committee treasurer, said the
committee is now deciding
whether to approve a potential
request from the Forum for additional funds. If not, publications will have to work within
their reduced budgets.
"Everybody has a fixed
amount of money," Bess said.
"There's nothing to say these
publications wouldn't have been
cut if they had gone through
spring budgeting with Budget
Committee."
According to Attanasio,
during the spring budgeting process last semester, Josh Kramer
'OO, then the publications coordinator, presented a $35,000
proposal to Budget Committee
for funding all publications except the Halcyon, Small Craft
Warnings or CelebrAsian. Budget Committee gave the forum
$30,000 for the Halcyon and
$30,000, for all other publications. Kramer declined to comment.
This fall the $60,000 wasn't
enough for all the requests. "Besides a couple new publications
that weren't allocated for, other
publications were applying for
more," said Bess.
After the 14 percent cut, the
two new publications, Elu
v'Elu, a Jewish literary magazine, and Swarthmore News on
Business (SNOB), amount to
about $ 1,100 of the $60,000 allotted to the Forum for a Free
Press.
Attanasio said he feels that
many
publications
are
underfunded. "Everybody could
use more," he said.
Although the current
method of allocating publications funding is creating difficulties, it was intended to fix
problems inherent in the old system. Bess said in the past Budget Committee had two problems trying to budget publications. First, committee members
did not have the technical
knowledge to make good decisions about the cost of printing
and quality of paper.
Second, he continued, "a lot
of publications would get budgeted and then wouldn't come
out." Even though the editors
may have had the best intentions
and tried their hardest to produce the publication, Bess said,
the money is budgeted for the
purpose ofprinting. When publications do not get printed the
money is not used for its intended purpose.
"We're working the bugs
out of a new system," said Bess,
who is discussing an improvement for next semester. If publications make funding requests
to the Forum for a Free Press
right before spring budgeting,
the forum could make a more
accurate proposal to Budget
Committee, he believes.
"It's certainly been bumpy
so far," Attanasio said, "[but
there's] no question it will be
better next year."

Plans discussed at Collection
sible locations for the hall include near Mary Lyons, near
PPR, or behind Sharpies. Being
placed behind Sharpies offers
the added advantage of accommodating spillover from meal
meetings in the dining hall.
Josh Knox, a student representative for a new student center, discussed the options of
building a new student center. A
dilemma arises between building an expansive, all-encompassing center (that might consolidate the mail center, the
bookstore, and the game room
with meeting space) or concentrating on renovating a few different student centers with an
addition of a smaller center. Old
Tarble, the Lodges, and Tarble
are a few areas under consideration for renovation towards
more student-based space.
Schall expressed "a hope to
accomplish significant things
with all five projects." Currently,
however, the project which is
most plausible in terms of
fundraising includes a new residence hall and the renovations
of Parrish and DuPont. Its cost
will be around 80 to 90 million
dollars. For more details, visit
Swarthmore's website or pick

run from the artsy to the mainstream
to the just plain weird...
Movie Theaters
Ritz at the Bourse: Located on 4th
Street right below Market, Ritz at the
Bourse shows current foreign and independent films such as "Ma Vie en

Tepid Hot Spots: Off-campus
locales for the seriously deranged
This week the Phoenix Feature's editor Lance Langdon offered $25 of his own money to the student who
turned in the best description of an off campus hot spot. In the rules of the contest he stipulated that at
least ten entries had to be recieved in order for the $25 prize to be awarded, and it's a good thing he did
because these are all the entries he got. Though not exactly a representative selection off cool off-campus
venues, they might just make you laugh. Lance chuckled all the way to the bank.

In my early days at Swarthmore, I
used to tell people, "I'm still looking
for the neighborhoods in Philadelphia
that make it a real city." I knew they
existed. After all, I had seen the cluster of skyscrapers from the SEPTA
train coming in to the University City
Station several times. I just did not
know how to get to those elusive city
buildings.
Then one day this past March, I
had plans to have lunch at a restaurant
located on Walnut Street between 15th
and 16th Streets. After taking the train
to Suburban Station, I walked upstairs,
and headed south from City Hall.
Walking absent-mindedly with Bruce
Springstein's "Streets of Philadelpia"
running through my head, it suddenly
dawned on me: this was it! Craning
my neck, I saw the skyscrapers, and
felt vindicated.
Walnut Street turned out to be no less
satisfying. The few blocks I explored
were visually stunning, similar in appearance to midtown Manhattan. The
memories are hazy, but I remember passing Le Bee-Fin, an HMV, and some upscale stores. China Town has its local
culture, as does South Street. And, the
magnanimous Philadelphia Art Museum
is, uhhh... impressive. But, Walnut Street
is where it's at.

One cold March evening, I was
waiting for a friend at the Swarthmore SEPTA station. She was late,
and I headed over to the nearest pay
phone to give her a ring. But before
I could pick up the receiver, the
phone rang, and without thinking I
answered it.
"Hello?" I said.
"Hey, is Mike there?"
"Urn, I think you have the
wrong number . . this is a pay
phone."
"Yeah, I know. Is Mike there?"
As I was about to hang up, one
of the group of ville kids that had
been smoking at the far end of the
platform came over. "I'll take that,"
he said. He talked to the person at
the other end for a couple of minutes, and hung up. Turning to me
again, he said, "Everybody calls us
here. There's always someone
around."
With all the talk about building
a new campus center, we here at
Swarthmore are overlooking the resources that already exist. There is
already a place on campus that is
free, open 24 hours, accessible to
smokers, and where one can always
be sure of finding a friend. It's time
we reclaimed the SEPTA station.

The Port Authority Bus Terminal is a urinal that takes up an entire city block. Inplaceoftheminty
cake that makes other urinals bearable, the PABT has a misinformation booth. Mere flushing will not
get this urinal clean. No, if you want
to put a scratch in the grime that
covers every surface you need napalm, but you can't call in an air
strike because the phones don't
work, so you have to sprint up the
broken escalator before you catch
the Plague. The entrance to the terminal sits at 42nd and Bth, a quaint
little area known by the locals as
"Pimptown." Feel free to talk with
the outgoing ladies you meet; for
$lO you can be infected with the
STD of your choice. Are you a
sucker for advertisements in neon?
Keep your gaze fixed on the sidewalk or you'll be enticed to purchase videos featuring activities not
covered in the safer sex seminar.
If you're looking for an antiseptic, PC destination, stay at Swarthmore, but if you've got a sense of
humor, take Greyhound to
Manhattan's 42nd street. You'll find
some really strange stuff on the
sidewalk, but you won't find any
chalkings. I promise.

Outsiders offer Swatties
opportunities for outdoor fun
by Julie Cohen

Contributing Writer

Just because Swarthmore's campus is a beautiful arboretum does not
mean that an escape to the outdoors
is not sometimes in order. Hiking,
canoeing, skiing, rock-climbing and
biking are all possible in a 5-hour
radius.
The college has an Outsiders
Club, which exists to give equipment and funding to people interested in organizing outdoor trips.
The club no longer has meetings but
is run through an email address,
<outsiders@sccs.
swarthmore.edu>, where students
can get in touch with other people
who might want to go on a trip.
Available equipment includes packs,
tents, and sleeping bags. Funding
from SAC is available for trips that
will be expensive.
The club has a website at

<www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/
~sprice/outsiders.html. It includes
a guide for planning trips and contact names for help in obtaining
gear, a van and food from Sharpies.
There is also information on upcoming trips and a short guidebook to
destinations club members have visited in the past, such as French
Creek State Park and the
Wissahickon.
Tomorrow night, Outsiders
Club, in conjunction with UPenn
Outing Club, will hold "In-formal,"
a campout at Crum Henge. It starts
in the afternoon with frisbee-playing and will feature a bonfire after
dark. The event is open to everyone.
For Swatties short on time,
Rachel Adams, 'OO, a core member
of Outsiders, highlighed some spots
close by, including Valley Forge,
which is 30 minutes away by car,
and Ridley Creek State Park, a 15minute drive to trails for biking and
running. An hour and a half away
by car is an 8-mile hike to the Pinnacle, a spot on the Appalachian
Trail that is "supposedly one of the
best views in the state," said Adams.
"The hike was very nice." This is
also a good place to mountain bike.
Chris Fanjul 'OO, who has been
involved with Outsiders Club in the
past, recommends camping on the
north end of Long Beach Island,
New Jersey, about two hours away.
"Most people think camping on the
beach is less hard-core, but it's fun,"
said Fanjul. He also recommended

the Delaware Water Gap, which is
about two hours north of Swarthmore. "It's gorgeous for hiking and
camping," he said. For skiing,
Fanjul suggests the Poconos, which
is about a 4-5 hour drive but has
slopes for all skill levels.
"The Delaware River is good
for canoeing, and there is a great
standing wave for kayakers at a
place called Scutter's Falls about an
hour from here, five to ten minutes
above where 295 meets 29 in New
Jersey," he said. According to
Fanjul, there are also places in the
Pine Barrens, which is about 1 1/2
hours from campus, that rent canoes or kayaks. Outsiders Club usually runs at least one trip a year
there.
John Rieffel '99 of the Rock
Climbing Club said that, although
it is too cold now for outdoor climbing, the club will begin going to an
indoor, off-campus rock climbing
gym relatively soon. To join the
mailing list of the club and find out
information about future activities,
send
an
email
to
<climbersrequest@sccs.
swarthmore.edu> and write "subscribe" as the subject.
Julia Trippel 'Ol recommends
a visit to Northbrook Orchards, located about 40 minutes away in
West Chester. Though the applepicking season ended about two
weeks ago, the orchard has fresh
produce and grounds for walking.

Texan takes to Philly streets and discovers
overlooked charm, urges Swatties to do the same
by Byron Chen
Contributing Writer
I cringe whenever I hear
say, "There's noth-

Swatties

ing to do here except study
and go to the movies." I am
an exchange student from
Rice University in Houston
and am originally from
California. I love both
places, but neither really
have the history and charm
that Philadelphia and the
rest of the East Coast have.
Granted, for those who
are on tight budgets, it can
be a bit difficult to shell out
$6.50 for a round-trip on the
weekends. Once past that,
though, Philly offers plenty
of cheap and accessible entertainment; you just have
to take a little time and effort to find it. One excellent
source is Swarthmore's web
page. At the bottom of Campus Links page, you can find
links to Philly News and
Liberty Net, which have entertainment sections.
A strong case can be
made that Independence
National Park is the most
historic square mile in

America. The Declaration
of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and
the U.S. Constitution were
all drafted and signed in Independence Hall (Chestnut
and 6th Streets), known as
the nation's "cradle of liberty." Admission to see the
hall and the Liberty Bell
across the street are both
free, though during peak
times, you need a time
ticket from a nearby booth
to get into the hall. Go in the
early morning or late afternoon; at these times you
most likely will not need a
ticket. Two blocks north is
Ben Franklin's grave in
Christ Church Cemetery
(Arch and sth). Throwing a
penny on to his grave is supposed to bring good luck.
Two blocks east (Arch and
3rd), you will find the house
of Betsy Ross, who designed the first American
flag.
If your SEPTA train
takes you to the Market East
station, check out Market
East shopping mall and the
adjacent Reading Terminal
Market. The mall, in fact,

was the first indoor shopping mall in America!
Christmas is right around
the corner, and the mall is
the perfect place to do your
shopping. The Reading
Market, open Mondays to
Saturdays from 10:00 am to
6:00 pm, is well-priced for
lunch and early dinners.
Sample ice cream for no
more than $2 at Bassett's,
around since the 1800's. Or
head a couple blocks north
to Race Street and duck into
a restaurant in Chinatown.
Several restaurants offer
huge plates of delicious
chow mein for $4.
Seven blocks south of
the mall and the Reading
Market is, of course, South
Street. Go to Jim's Steaks
and try a cheesesteak sandwich with Provolone
cheese, which some locals
claim is the ultimate Philly
eating experience, for just
$4.80. Or go across the
street to Starbuck's and chat
with your friends over a cup
of coffee. There are scores
of shops up and down South
Street, some of them quite
interesting.

If you get off at
SEPTA'S Suburban station,
west of Market East station,
there is just as much to see.
Check out the Avenue of the
Arts
(www.avenueofthearts.org)
which is the city's cultural
district. Here, you can find
the Philadelphia Philharmonic Orchestra, a dependable source of cheap entertainment. Its site at http://
www.philorch.org has deals
for students. If you go halfan-hour early before some
concerts and present your
ID, you can get tickets at $7
instead of shelling out the
usual $l5 or $2O. Here you
will also find the Merriam
Theater which has its share
of top plays (the hit play
Rent recently finished a
run). You can't miss the
City Hall in the center of the
district. With the statue of
William Penn on top, it was
the tallest building in the
city until 1987. There is not
much to see inside, but the
exterior is an architectural
and aesthetic wonder.
"Rocky" buffs should visit
the Philadelphia Museum of

Art at the end of the Ben
Franklin Parkway, where
Rocky ran up the 99 steps.
However, every student
should take the trip to visit
this city treasure, especially
since the admission price is
only $5. Featured artists
include Cezanne, Van
Gogh, Picasso, Rodin, and

Delacroix.

Every now and then, you
may have enough money for
a big trip. People like me
who live outside of the
Northeast-Mid Atlantic-Midwest train corridor do not get
much of a chance to take advantage of trains. Planes,
while more expensive, are
usually more convenient than
trains on the West Coast and
across the Sunbelt. In that
sense, you Swatties are lucky.
You can go to Lancaster
County and mingle with the
Amish folks for a day. This
is about $2O round-trip, but
with a Student Advantage
card from Amtrak (http://
www.amtrak.com), you can
knock this down by 15% to
$l7. For those of you who
have never been to New York
City, the back of your Student

Walkout held on Wednesday Fritz, with

mixed. "I couldn't hear a word they were
saying" one student grumbled. Another
student, speaking anonymously, said "It
was another incident about dividing
people along the lines that we're not supposed to worry about"
Others, greeted the end of the presentation with applause, and all coalition
members recalled that the students paid
attention to what was said. Asked if the
demonstration was successful, Freedman
responded "In terms of people walking
out, oh yeah."
A follow up meeting held yesterday
from 4 to 6p.m. at the BCC featured a
panel of five faculty and staff members
whose views tended to be favorable towards affirmative action. The meeting
drew thirty students. Professor Lisa
Hajjar, a 30 speaker, recalled that
Maurice Eldridge stressed to Swatties
that they need not only to concern themselves with the college's commitment to
diversity, but also with that of the larger
communities.
College admissions does not have an
affirmative action policy. However, Ben
Fritz, an interviewer of prospective students, stated that its policies aren't blind
to considerations of color and background either
"It is my understanding that race is

considered one among a variety of factors about where an applicant is coming
from and what they bring to the college
campus." he said "It is the goal of the
admissions office to bring in a racially
diverse student body. They realize that
they will have to reach out more to minority students."
In a later conversation Professor and
speaker Lisa Hajjar criticized the "merit"
rhetoric typically employed in anti-affirmative action initiatives. Debates tend
to present affirmative action and merit
as an either/or choice, she said, but
"Much of the debate over affirmative
action is premised on rhetorical manipulations. What the U.S. looked like before
affirmative action was not a bastion of
perfection. The fantasy notion that merit
used to reign is spurious .
Even for
people to make that argument says how
stupid they are."
"The point ofthe demonstration was
not in any way to imply that students of
color were at Swarthmore merely because of affirmative action," she said.
However, "The national trend toward
affirmative action has made them [the
admissions office] rethink where they
recruit from and has made an impact on
Swarthmore. It has made Swarthmore a
wonderful place. The walk out was an
attempt to show what national affirmative action policy is aiming for."

characters beyond the stereotype in
ways Travolta is not able to accomplish.
Primary Colors is bound to leave
most viewers unsatisfied, as it never

probings. The film ends with its version of the "real" questions of the
Clinton presidency, which do not fully
represent a man who has spent his life
trying to please everybody and never
being confident to hold his own in a
storm of political and personal pressures. There are scenes that amuse and
move (most notably a late-night conversation between Stanton and a mentally challenged employee at a donut
shop), but as a whole the film fails to
say anything interesting about our
president or politics. It also fails to hold
the viewer's interest through its disjointed, hackneyed narrative, the worst
sin ofall.

The Other
Unreal
World
Some of you out there seem to
think that this column, while cute in
its own way (and I don't just mean the
picture), is pretty unimportant compared to the rest of life here in the intensely academic world of Swarthmore. That may explain why so few
people seem to be aware this column
exists, perhaps because they're so
deeply ensconced in the intricacies of
postmodern critical theory that they
don't have the space in their brain or
schedule to indulge triflings such as I
write about (although I dare you to call
Gary Coleman a trifling to my, or for
that matter his, face). Well, postmodern
guys and gals, this week, my column's
for you. It's time to take the tools that
both you and I have acquired during
our Swarthmore education and apply
them to the world of entertainment; to
ask, as academics are wont, "What's
really going on here?"
I therefore offer up some analyses
of just what is really going on in some
recent films and TV shows. To what
extent do I mean each example to be
taken seriously? Well, it's postmodern
theory, so it's up to you to decide.
"Titanic:" Emasculation of a
Nation
The setting is the crowning
achievement of human technology: a
giant phallus thrusting its way through
the moist seas of the Atlantic Ocean
until an unexpected blow prematurely
sends its passengers spewing out into
an inhospitable land, where all but a few
meet their untimely death. Despite the
proudly masculine transportation, however, the main characters are a reversal
of traditional gender roles in the Hollywood blockbuster. While Rose starts off
as a repressed, traditional rich girl, the
story is all about her rebellion against
her circumstances, finding the strength
to fight the powers that be (personified
in Billy Zane, the most ridiculously evil
character since Bob Dornan). She takes
this step because she is inspired by her
love, a fair-haired waif whose artistry,
sensitivity and spunk win her over. In
the end, the giant phallus goes down
along with feminized man, representing the emasculation of a culture and
the birth out ofthose phallic ashes of a
proudly independent feminism that uses
men, instead of being oppressed by
them. And all this from James Cameron,
the proud Papa of some of the most ultra-macho films of all time (e.g. "Terminator 2," "Aliens").
"Star Wars:" Moneyshot for
the Motherland
Everything you need to know is
right there in the climactic scene. You
know it like your e-mail password: after a brutal battle where the Rebellion
forces have been massacred, only Luke
Skywalker remains to take out the
Death Star. Evil Lord Vader has his
sights on him, but then space cowboy
Han Solo vanquishes him, leaving
Luke to take his moneyshot and blow
the Empire to kingdom come. But isn't
the imagery interesting? The Death
Star, a giant round object, almost like
an egg, is attacked by a bunch of tiny
attack fighters, all piloted by men, who
are trying to evade a sea of defenses
and shoot their load, if you will, in the
one narrow opening which will take
their shot straight to the center, with
explosive results. You don't need to
remember much about your health
class to figure this one out.
But there's more. The final successful blow is struck not just by anyone, but by a sandy-haired farm boy
who rockets from obscurity to overthrow the evil forces controlled by the
man dressed, well shiver my timbers,
entirely in black! Many have described
"Star Wars" as representing the fantasy of every boy who has dreamed of
being a hero, but this sounds to me
more like the fantasy of a certain German who rocketed from obscurity to
overthrow the established powers by
vanquishing those who looked different. Heil Lucas?

LOVE WOK rfl\D LOST

Director Catherine Osbourne's valiant attempt to reconstruct "Romeo and
Juliet" forces the youthful strength and
vibrancy ofthe actors to compensate for
the artistic miscalculations. Though
dwarfed by the enormous and essentially barren stage, the seventeen-member cast, comprised primarily of freshmen, injects richness and life into the
bare setting.
To cement a solid cast there are several pillars of strength, many of whom
are freshmen making promising debuts.
Dan Belsky 'O2 as Tybalt combines his
technical prowess of fencing with refreshing energy and articulated speech.
Belsky's prior experience with epee
fencing adds agility and a convincing
edge to his stage combat sequences.
Taking liberal but clever artistic license,
Osbourne 'O2 double casts Belsky as the

intriguing effect is that the ghost of the
deceased Tybalt hands Romeo the
sleeping potion, which kills Romeo and
leads Juliet to suicide.
Jon Stancato 'O2 provides a solid
and entertaining Lord Capulet with a
strong presence and finely calibrated
delivery of speech. Opposite his dignified Lady Capulet played by Laura
Seeley 'Ol, the duo fosters the distanced
familial atmosphere crucial to the play.
Alecia Magnifico 'OO is forced to play
solo without a husband, Montague, as

idea that the members of two families
should wear armbands to easily denote
their house alliance. The dress code is
contemporary, consisting mainly of
loose dresses, jeans, and collared longsleeved shirts, and manages to be familiar without being recognizable.
With the Montagues wearing one color
and the Capulets another, this costume
design is nearly foolproof. The sole
problem with Schneider's idea is that
like the lighting, the already sparse
colors in the costumes are lost in the
big black space of the stage. If the colors ofthe costumes were not restricted
primarily to the bright patches on their
armbands, they may have been more
successful. As it is, the costume design
is an intelligent choice that falls somewhat short of its promise.
Like the rest of the set, the music
is minimal, yet it is the only facet of
design that is inconsistent. Sound designer Scott Price 'OO creates a musical map that varies from a charming,
slow and melodious rendition of Dan
Penn's "Dark Street," reused several
times, to a shimmering and metallic
ghoulish sound. The individual snippets of music are interesting, yet when
juxtaposed against one another they do
not form a cohesive sound pattern.
Clearly there are numerous talented members in the cast and crew of
Catherine Osbourne's production of
"Romeo and Juliet." The solid cast,
comprised primarily of freshman, indicates a rising generation of ingenious
and skilled actors who will hopefully
continue to showcase their talent. This
rendition of "Romeo and Juliet" is
brimming with ideas, and it is precisely
because of this abundance of ideas that
it technically falls slightly short of its
grand promise.

Visit to local mall cures homesickness in Thailand
by Rohan Hoole
Foriegn Correspondent
Living in a foreign country, there
are times when you just get so homesick it becomes almost unbearable.
Sweet green curry and pat thai are delicious, but after a few weeks of eating
only Thai food something inside just
screams for a burger or pizza. There are
times when the foreign (now domestic)
language and your sudden illiteracy feel
like they are going to crush you under
the incredible weight of being shut out
from communication. It's times like
these (at least in my case) when you
head to Kad Suan Kew âthe mall.
"The mall?" you ask, "I don't damn
well go to the mall back home, why on
earth would I go to a mall in Thailand?"
Kad Suan Kew is an enigma. It exists
in a dual world, for as surely as it is
completely and utterly Thai it is also a
cultural refuge for an American (or a
confused Australian like me).
Wandering aimlessly around Kad
Suan Kew are a handful of farangs
(westerners). At some point they will
probably stop in at Burger King, KFC,
Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen, or at least
Baskin Robbins. These are people who,
like me, love living in Chiang Mai, but
need to take a deep breath of stale recycled quasi-western air before they
dive back into noodles, rice, and dirtfloored restaurants
Thai people don't like burgers because that meat kind of disgusts them.
The mention of pizza dough makes
many of my friends clutch their stomachs in mock pain. (KFC's spicy
chicken, for some reason, is extremely

popular and invariably packs a restaurant.) On the whole, Thai people

haven't fallen in love with Western food
because it's western. The prices are so
high though, that the margins are wide
and places like Burger King which cost
the same as a upscale restaurant don't
need that many customers to make a
profit.
When I need more than a mild dose
of America to cure my homesickness,
I go to the top of the mall and catch a
movie. Don't expect any independent
movies to make it to Thailand. "Armageddon," "Rush Hour," "Mulan" and
"Blade" have been big box office hits
since I've been here. Homesick
thailophyles (who are invariably young,
leftist, Non-Governmental Organization workers) see all the big Hollywood
movies they'd probably never see back
home. They complain about Thai taste
in movies, but they're always the first
in line for the tickets. I suppose people
will do anything to have a taste of
home.
Perhaps I've given you the impression that the only thing Thai about Kad
Suan Kew is the people, but that is not
even mildly true. Every thing about
Kad Suan Kew is Thai, right down to
the "Armageddon" screening upstairs.
When Thailand incorporates parts of
American culture, it takes possession
of it and makes it its own. The little
things make the experience Thai and
you begin to think of all the little things
you took for granted back home. When
you go to the movies in Thailand, you
are assigned a specific seat and you
must pay homage to the King by standing while his personal anthem (written

by him) is played. The snacks at the
snack bar are all Thai. People laugh at
totally different jokes. Sometimes I
think I'd do anything for a box of
Snocaps, but I really only go to the mall
for a bit of a Western experience. I want
to be in Thailand, and too much
America might send me into shock .
On the floor below the movie theater is a resturant called RocketsAmerican Snacks. Sporting a futuristic space decor, Rockets good old
American mainstays such as toast covered with condensed milk, and jackfruit
flavored ice shakes. Rockets is a very
cool place to be seen, and that is kind
ofreassuring. After writing a lot ofpapers about how white middle class
American society exoticizes Asia, it's
nice to see that middle class Asian society does the same thing.
Near Rockets is my favorite place
in the entire mall. Inside a maze of narrow alley ways are the shops which sell
the clothes that all the "cool" people in
Chiang Mai wear when they go out.
Imagine going clothes shopping whenever you wanted without ever having
to worry about money. In Thailand
armed with strong US dollarsâthat
dream is a reality. By the way people
dressed, you'd guess you were in some
trendy, if slightly surreal, part of New
York City, but prices peak around ten
dollars, and Thai pop music wouldn't
go down so well in New York.
Thailand is a very socially conservative society (although that is quickly
changing), so the body piercing shop
nestled inside the maze always attracts
my attention for a few minutes. Sporting green hair and a face full of
â

piercings, the owner specializes in
tongues. The clientele are usually rich,
young, exceedingly good looking boys
and girls who want to shock and scandalize their parents and everyone else.
They trudge around, trying to look
punk and virtually screaming "not only
do I have a crush on an American movie
star, I look like one too."
I go to Kad Suan Kew for a bit of
American culture, but each trip is a
peek into the heart of Thailand. Thais
have chosen to use their new-found
wealth to construct suburban shopping
malls, and fill them with shiny floors,
expensive shops, and loud pop music.
These are places where you buy the
things to improve your image, places
where you improve you image just by
being seen.
A few hundred yards away people
struggle to put food on the table, but in
Kad Suan Kew teenagers shell out four
times more at Burger King than it costs
to buy a plate of Thai food on the street.
You can't begrudge these young people
their wealth. They are the people who
are going to pull Thailand out of the
crisis, and hopefully give everyone the
chance to eat expensive, generic,
American fast food. And you can't
blame the American chainsâthey've
come to Thailand because people buy
their food.
The truth is, everyone in Kad Suan
Kew seems very happy with the arrangement. The only hope I have is
that more people will be able to be a
part of the orgy of consumerism in the
future. Or even, like most Swatties, to
have the luxury of being rich enough
to disdainfully ignore it.

"Primary Colors" really nothing more than hackneyed failure
by Ben Fritz
Staff Writer
As disgusted as you may be by the
investigations into his personal life, as
angry as you may be that the serious
issues of our nation continue to be ignored, you've got to admit that Bill
Clinton is by far the most interesting
phenomenon in politics today.
For years, the man from Hope has
confounded every observer, rising and
falling and rising again with more frequency than my appetite before, during,
and after Sharpies. With that in mind,
"Primary Colors," director Mike
Nichols' adaptation of Joe Klein (a.k.a.

Anonymous)'s pseudo-novel about the
Clinton campaign could've been great.
If ever there were a real person whose
life had the kind of dramatic tension
films are built on, it's our president.
If that's your thinking, my advice
is to stick to reading "USA Today."
"Primary Colors" is a very weak attempt to capture anything meaningful
or interesting in Clinton. It'd be like
trying to gain some insight into Swarthmore by reading ,a summary in the
Fiske Guide.Sure, it gets the basic facts
and maybe has a few random insights,
but overall it's not going to tell you anything interesting, and it sure isn't a particularly exciting narrative. Scripter and

frequent Nichols collaborator Elaine
May simply took Klein's already lame
book and condensed it in the simplest
way possible for a film. May clearly
spent little time thinking about what she
was doing, because in the process of
adaptation she lost perhaps the book's
biggest strength, its narrator, Henry
Burton (Adrian Lester).
Burton is a young black politico
who re-enters political life to help candidate Jack Stanton (John Travolta) win
the Democratic nomination and provides a narrative center to the book,
giving us a lens through which to view
the often disjointed goings-on in the
campaign. May and Nichols do use

Burton, but they don't allow us any insight into his views on what's going on.
We can't hear his thoughts, so he's
more like a random cipher the audience
follows through the film for no apparent reason.

Travolta does an adequate job as
Stanton, nailing most of the
Clintonesque mannerisms and creating
a fairly interesting character out of the
cliches of donut-eating and empathy.
Emma Thompson and Kathy Bates are
the film's real strengths, however, as

Holden, an old Stanton friend who

Great Moments in TV History
It has been suggested
that last week's purported telecast of the football game between Swarthmore and the Diplomats of Franklin and
Marshall, the ECAC game of
the week if you believe the
hype, was in fact a scam. I've
heard it said that the cameras,
announcers, signs, and all other

ECAC mise-en-scene

were

nothing more than a cunning
ploy devised by the mastermind
behind Swarthmore athletics,
Bob Williams. The purpose of
such an insidious plot? To motivate the football team by conjuring up the threat of televised
embarrassment. I will not say
by whom such a thing has been
suggested but if you assume it
to be a member of the disillusioned athletic community of
the college, you're probably
looking in the right direction.
As I am unwilling to call any
member ofthe disillusioned athletic community out, I will, for
journalism's sake, attempt to
take the point of view of such a
person.
Such a person might
wonder what in the world any
self-respecting television station
is doing televising the Swarthmore-Diplomats football game.
Such a thing is ludicrous; it
would never happen. It's like
ABC corrupting and devastating
their Monday Night Football
franchise by televising the
Eagles. Ah, I say. The situation is somewhat different. After all, the so-called ECAC
"Television Network" was not
competing against "Miniskirt
Monday" as ABC does. What

Lf*Â»rn?.lÂ»9e.l

competition for the
Swarthmore-Diplomats telecast? Saved By the Bell, The
New Class? Surely the fascination with the abomination
combined with the strong, vocal Diplomat following in the
area could ensure a partial steal
of Saved By the Bell's ratings.
'No' such a person would say.
Nobody would watch Swarthmore versus the Diplomats
when they could watch Dustin
Diamond illustrate the psychological realism of method acting at its Brandoesque highest
level. Okay. Point taken.
However, surely Bob
Williams would never do such
a thing, right? Actually, apparently Williams decided that the
best way to spend the least
amount of money in the least
productive way (which is what
the department is in the business
of doing) was to stage an elaborate Halloween hoax. From
what I understand, all remaining funds are to be given to his
all consuming passion, the track
team. That's right, baseball and
softball...you're out! No dugouts. Lacrosse? No road meals
for you this spring. Football recruits for next year? Forget
about it.
Allright, I'm being facetious for those of you who
hadn't already figured it out.
The point was not to rip the
football team or the televising
of Saturday's game. I'm glad
that the football team got some
exposure and in the process,
played one of their strongest
games in years. Perhaps it's true
that all they needed was the
cameras. In fact, maybe the
cameras captured the hideous

and ten that cost Swarthmore
the win. It was reported yesterday that four officials in the
Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference were suspended for missing a crucial call in a game on
Saturday between William &
Mary and Hampton. The evidence against them was a game
tape. A similar review may not
get Swarthmore a victory but it
would at least produce a modicum of satisfaction for all those
players and fans devastated by
the call. Perhaps, dare I suggest
it, light bulbs are indeed flashing in the minds of athletic department mucky-mucks.
Let me also correct the
impression that I personally dislike any of the athletic department mucky-mucks. They're all
fine. But let's separate being an
accommodating person from
being a person who can do the
best work in the athletic department. What Swarthmore needs
is someone who will be strong
first and foremost for the good
of the athletic department and
the athletes. What I'm suggesting is that doingright by the athletes is in some way at odds with
a direction handed down by
those higher up than Williams.
Maybe Williams is capable of
being that strong person. Of
course it is pure speculation in
the first place to suggest that he
is a solid company man doing
his best in the face of an unyielding administration. However, the meager success of
sports teams at the school in recent years leads me to the conclusion that the people who
matter at Swarthmore view athletics as philistine, vulgar, and
unnecessary.
Maybe I'm
wrong. Maybe they've simply

Swarthmore Women's
Rugby, a Division 1 competitor,
continued their winning streak
last Saturday as they pulverized
the University of Pennsylvania
30-0. This game marked the
team's last chance to face a
team in their division.
Swarthmore dominated the
entire game and kept UPenn in
their defensive quarter for the
majority of it. The scoring
frenzy began with a powerful
put-down by Alexa Miller 'OO
before the first minute of play
was over. Swarthmore then
settled into a rhythm of skillful
inter-play of both backs and
forwards. Noelle Goodin 'OO
put the backs on the board with
two impressive tries that resulted from intricate passing
between the entire line of backs.
Nancy Craig 'Ol attained true
"Zulu Warrior" status as she
scored her first A-side try with
a mighty dive past her defenders. Rhiana Swartz 'OO, capitalizing on a Swat dominated
lineout, scored with several
helpless opponents hanging on
her. Miller closed out the game
with another awesome try, leaving Swat a 30 point victor.
Youngins Nicole GeorgesAbeyie 'O2 and Maya Peterson

of yardage and shutting down
the opposition, while Beth Vose
'99 continued her solid playing.
The B-side game, whose
length was cut in half due to
Penn's lack ofreplacement players, was played with all the intensity of a full game. Once
again lineouts and scrums were
dominated by Swarthmore as
forwards Elizabeth "Phil"
Meehan 'Ol and Tracy McNeil
'OO led the pack. Swarthmore's
backs, especially Emily Wilkins
'Ol and Danielle D'Olivera 'OO,
also gained praise from coach
Alan Matas: "It was their finest
playing yet this season." Despite the efforts of the team,
though, UPenn was awarded a
try out of pity in the last 10 seconds of the half, and the game
technically ended with a score
of 0-5.
Swarthmore injuries were
the only black sheep of the day
as captain Sarah Cross '99 was
injured playing for the other
team, Cori Garrett-Goodyear
'99 got trampled on the bottom
of a ruck, and Wilkins' nose had
an unfortunate encounter with a
UPenn elbow. Thankfully, all
are recovering well.
Swarthmore will take on
long-time foe Bryn Mawr/
Haverford this Saturday at
Haverford at 11:00 am with the
hope of winning a third game in
a row. Their last home game
will be played the following Saturday, November 14th at 11:00
am on Dupont Field.

come to the conclusion that quietly continuing a losing streak
is better than appearing on
SportsCenter some Saturday
(hopefully in the near future)
followed by the tagline: "Ends
the Longest Losing Streak in the
NCAA."
Let me say to them and
to Bob Williams that it's not
better. There is a large group of
students who consider their athletic experiences at Swarthmore
to be their most enriching. Note
to the administration: these
people are future contributors.
However, in the meantime, we
want to win. We want Swarthmore to be as acclaimed in athletics as it is in academics. We
want players. We want respectable athletic fields. We don't
want more shot-puts or javelins
or whatever it is that the athletic
department is spending its
money on. Dugouts on the baseball field would be nice. An
extra coach on every team
would be great. Allowing the
wealthiest patrons of the school
to contribute to specific athletic
programs would be superb. And
for God's sake tell us the truth
about admissions slots.
While they're at all that,
maybe they can get the tape of
Saturday's game into the right
hands at the ECAC. Any win
(actual, moral, or otherwise) is
a good win at this point. Here's
hoping that Swarthmore athletics can get themselves together
in the near future so that we can
all enjoy more greatmoments in
television history.

Cross country teams
fare well in Centennial
Conference championship
by Anne Frankenfield

Staff Writer
Despite the ominous aura
of Halloween this past weekend, the Swarthmore men's
and women's cross country
teams ran competitive races to
finish sixth and third respectively at the Centennial Conference Championships held at
Western Maryland College
this past weekend. Led by
sophomore Marc Jeuland 'Ol,
who finished 10th overall in a
time of 27:06, giving him 2nd
Team All-Centennial Conference honors, the men ran an
excellent race finishing one
place ahead of last year's results with a team score of 151.
Taking the Conference Title
was Haverford, who finished
with a team total of 26, followed by Dickinson (84),
Gettysburg (90), Johns
Hopkins (90) and Franklin &
Marshall (106). Finishing behind Swarthmore were
Ursinus (197), Muhlenberg
(242), and Western Maryland
(244).
Following Jeuland to complete the Garnet's top seven
were Josh Bloom 'OO (30th,
28:06), Phil Jones '99 (40th,
28:35), Gordon Roble '99
(41st, 28:36), Jeff Doyon 'OO
(46th, 28:51), Sam Evans 'Ol
(52nd, 29:01), and Marc
Nierman 'Ol (55th, 29:09).
Also running for the men were
Lorrin Nelson 'OO, Ambrose
Dieringer 'Ol, Michael Evans
'O2, and Nevin Katz '99. Participating in the Junior Varsity
race were Seth Steed 'Ol,
Gene Yoshida '99, Matt
Landreman 'O2, and Patrick
Dostal 'O2. No official results
were available for the JV race
run by both men and women
on the 5K (3.1 mile) course.
Coach Luci Rosalia was
pleased with the men's race

and cited Jones for running his
best race this season at conferences. Along with Jones, she
cited Roble, Katz, and Yoshida
for their consistent contributions to the team as the seniors
ran their last Centennial Cross
Country Championship.
The women's charge, which
earned them a third place Conference finish, was by Joko
Agunloye 'Ol, who finished 4th
overall in a time of 19:17. This
effort earned her 1 st Team AllCentennial Conference honors.
She was followed by Amalia
Jerison 'OO (19th, 20:45), Alissa
Parmelee 'Ol (22nd, 20:51),
Karen Lloyd 'OO (26th, 20:58),
Sarah McClure 'OO (37th,
21:22), Jessica George 'OO
(42nd, 21:28), and Jessica Lane
'99 (65th, 22:13) to round out
the women's top seven. Also
running for the Garnet were
Darragh Jones '99 and Christen
Lungren 'O2. Casey Cohn '99,
Kirsten Lindermayer '99 and
Sonia Mariano 'O2 competed in
the Junior Varsity race.
Only Dickinson (45) and
Haverford (76) could top Swarthmore, who finished with a
team score of 105. The Garnet
defeated Bryn Mawr (106),
Franklin & Marshall (119),
Muhlenberg (152), Gettysburg
(161), Western Maryland (211),
Johns Hopkins (226), and
Ursinus (309). Rosalia again
cited the seniors Cohn, Jones,
Lane, and Lindermayer for
their contributions to the team.
She also cited the team's accomplishments commenting
that, "The women's team ran a
competitive race to beat Bryn
Mawr by one point." The teams
look ahead now to the Regional
Championships which will be
held at Allentown College on
November 14th. The men's
race will begin at 11am, followed by the women's race at
12pm.

Garnet topples Haverford,
earns spot in ECAC tourney
by Jean Quinn
Sports Editor

With the toppling of neighboring foe Haverford last weekend to close out their regular
season, the Garnet field hockey
team (12-6 overall, 7-2 in the
Centennial Conference) earned
a berth in the ECAC tournament
for the second year in a row.
Swat steamrolled Haverford
in a 4-0 romp. Donna Griffin
'99 led the team with one goal
and two assists, while Holly
Baker '99, Lurah Hess '99, and
Julie Finnegan 'OO each scored.
Jane Kendall turned away eight
Fords' shots for her eighth shutout of the year. "The Haverford
game was played with a lot of
heart. We all came out ready to
have a great last regular season
game and, while Haverford
played well, they could not
match our skills and intensity,"
commented Hess.

The team received notification Tuesday that they would be
participating in the ECAC tournament which they hosted and
won last year. The tournament
was expanded to include six
teams, which necessitated the
third through sixth seeds playing an additional contest the
next night. "Initially I was surprised and somewhat disappointed we were ranked third,
since we have one of the strongest schedules around and all
but one of our losses was to a
team that is in the NCAA tournament," said Hess. "But I'm
actually excited we got the third
seed because now we are the
highest ranked team that gets to
play three more games this
week. I'm not ready for my last
game, so the longer we extend
the season the happier I am."
Swarthmore traveled to
Allentown Wednesday night to
take on the Mules on their home
turf under the lights. The Gar-

net were victorious, pulling out
a 3-2 win in double overtime.
Jen Hagan '99 scored first,
dodging an oncoming defender,
and then lifting the ball over the
defense off of a corner play. The
Mules rallied, though, and
scored the game's next two
goals. Kim Cariello 'O2 scored
on a breakaway with a couple
of fakes and dodges to evade the
defense and keeper. The score
was deadlocked at 2-2 for the
remainder of regulation and up
until 12:12 was remaining in the
second OT At this point, Baker
scored on a penalty stroke to
give her team the win.
"Muhlenberg played well on
their home turf and had lots of
fans rooting them on, but the
usual Swat intensity and desire
prevailed once again!" said
Hess.
The Garnet face the number
two seed Wesley in Dover, Delaware Saturday afternoon in the
semifinals.

Football team rallies, edged out by F&M, 21-17
J.P. Harris
Staff Writer
Early in last Saturday's
game against the Diplomats of
Franklin and Marshall, it appeared that the ghosts of
Swarthmore's last 25 consecutive losses could not be
put to rest. F&M drove 68
yards on 8 plays to take an
early lead, 7-0. By half-time,
the Diplomats had amassed
187 yards of total offense and
captured 10 first downs. In
contrast, the Tide only mustered 8 yards rushing and 3
first downs for the half. The
Garnet did manage to manufacture one score, a 64-yard
pass hauled in by senior wide
receiver Brian Bell '99. His
catch and run knotted fhe
score at seven going into the
half, but the offense was otherwise ineffective.
With 3:40 remaining in
the half, F&M took the ball
on their own 19 and marched
toward a second score. Two
quick passes and the Diplomats crossed midfield. The
opponents trampled down to
the Swarthmore 1-yard line,
poised to score. From the one,
F&M attempted a QB sneak,

a broken arm, trotted onto the
field to attempt a 43-yard field
goal. The ball careened off the
crossbar and sailed through
the uprights to give the Tide a
10-7 lead.
The Diplomats quickly regained the lead on a 53-yard
scamper and took the lead, 1410. Just as quickly, however,
the Tide returned the favor.

Julie Mazer is currently
serving as the interim field
hockey and women's lacrosse
coach while Karen Borbee is on
maternity leave. Mazer adds yet
another dose of knowledge, experience and intensity to the successful women's field hockey
and lacrosse programs.
She initially became involved with field hockey and lacrosse as an athlete. As a walkon to West Chester's teams, Mazer worked hard to excel in her
collegiate career. The lacrosse
team was undefeated PSAC
champions for three of her four
years. In her junior year, Mazer
was selected by the USWLA as
an Honorable Mention AilAmerican.
After graduating from West
Chester University with a B.S. in
Health and Physical Education,
Mazer coached high school lacrosse and field hockey to gain
experience on the other side of
the field. At the same time, she
was also substitute teaching as a
K-8 health and physical education teacher in the school district
of Philadelphia for two years. In
1996, she moved to collegiate
coaching as one ofSwarthmore's
assistant coaches. After her success at Swarthmore, Mazer decided to pursue coaching as a career and resigned from the school
district. In turn, she became the
full time assistant coach for William Smith College in Geneva,
NY at an intern capacity.
While at William Smith, she
led the field hockey team tothe
Division HI national championship and the lacrosse team advanced to the quarterfinal of
NCAA tournament. Afterthe lacrosse season, Mazer searched
for a head coaching position.
She returned to Swarthmore because she felt the position here
would offer her the best experience. Also, Mazer will be beginning her Master's degree in
the spring in either Sports Administration or Sports Psychology.
When asked to comment
on the field hockey season,
Mazer noted the success of the
team. "While they have six
losses, five of those came to
teams that were invited to
[NCAA] tourney," she said.
Mazer also stressed the extra
burden that student-athletes
shoulder at Swat. She is proud
that the field hockey team is
able to step up to the challenge
of playing top-ranked Division
111 schools like Messiah and
Lebanon Valley, while still
maintaining the intensity in
academics that the college demands.
Mazer views Division 111
athletics as a rewarding place to
be coaching because playing is
still fun for the athletes. Many
are even able to participate in
more than one sport and fulfill
other aspects of their lives.
Mazer considers herself
lucky having worked with great
coaches and teams, and the success of the field hockey team
only highlights this.
