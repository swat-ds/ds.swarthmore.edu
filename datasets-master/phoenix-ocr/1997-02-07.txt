College to Maintain LocalTalk Next Year
By Daily

Gazette

Students who thought they'd have to spend as much as
$286 to connect their computers to the campus network
next year are getting a reprieve, said Judy Downing,
director of computing and communication services, on
Tuesday.
Downing said that a campus survey last Week found
many students would not be able to use the network if
plans to install new networking technology continued on
schedule. So while the Computing Center will continue
upgrading the campus network to the faster, more versatile Ethernet technology, students will still have the
option of using the old LocalTalk network next year.
Computing Center staff originally planned to abandon
LocalTalk next year. That would have forced students
with older computers to pay anywhere from $4O to $286
for special cardsand cables required to connect to Ethernet.

Chilly Outside, but Dog Days in Parrish

(The necessary hardware is already installed in most
newer computers.)
Of the 1120 students who answered the survey, only
370 currently use Ethernet, while 553 use LocalTalk.
Another 197 don't use the network, don't know what
networking technology they use, or don't have computers. Many of those using LocalTalk are seniors witholder
computers, but even after the senior class graduates,
Downing anticipates a significant number of students
will still want to use LocalTalk.
One wrinkle in Downing's plan to extend the life of the
old network is that Swarthmore's obsolete LocalTalk
equipment is aging rapidly, and replacement parts are no
longer manufactured. Swarthmore' s limited inventory of
replacement devices may run out by the middle of next
year; at that point the College could either buy used
devices or rearrange the LocalTalk network to use less

equipment.

Swarthmore's Early Decision process for
the class of 2001 has just been completed.
Out of 336 applicants, including 56 students
of color, 148 have been accepted to attend
this fall. The early acceptances will fill about
half of next year's projected class of 360
students. This class will be significantly
smaller than the Class of2000, which came in
at slightly over 400. According to Robin
Mamlet, Dean of Admissions, "next year
there will be fewer students on campus."
The above figures are the results of two
early admission processes, both of which are
binding. For the Fall Early Decision process,
applications were due by November 15 and
the notification date was set for December
15. Additionally, Mamlet has reinstated
Winter Early Decision, which did not exist
last year. Winter Early Decision applicants
must have their applications in at the same
time as prospective students applying through
the Regular Decision process, but they hear
back at around February 1.
The number of students accepted under the
Early Decision plans this year is significantly
higher than previous years. For the class of
1999, 137 applicants applied, and 84 were

accepted. For the class ot 2000, which had
only one Early Decision option, 173 applied
and 110 were accepted.
Over 4200 applications were received in
total this year, the largest number in the
history of the college. Final decisions will be
made by April 1.
Under the Early Decision plans, 40 international students applied and 8 were admitted. Last year, a record number of international students, 547, applied to Swarthmore.
This year, 598 applied, setting a new high.
According to Mamlet, "last year we offered early admission to 11 students of color,

and this year we offered early admission to 30
students of color, so we're off to a strong
start." Of the 30 students of color accepted,
14 are Asian American, 6 are Latino/a, 2 are
African American, and 8 are multiracial and
other. Mamlet claims that these numbers are
low everywhere because typically, "few students ofcolor apply early decision to college,
and Swarthmore has been no exception."
Since the class of 2000 was the most diverse in college history, "there is a kind of
anxiety, especially among students of color,"
stated Ben Maulbeck, IC Intern for HOLA,
"Are we going to be too afraid to push ahead
and continue to make diversity a priority?"
Maulbeck, however, was not alarmed by the
diversity among students accepted under Early
Decision: "Considering there are not many
students of color who apply, those numbers
don't sound too disheartening."
Student diversity groups are continuing
theirefforts to ensure that the class of 2001 is
diverse. In addition to hosting students of
color during Minority Pre-Frosh Weekend,
SASS, SAO, and HOLA will continue their
outreach efforts. SASS, in cooperation with
the Admissions office, is currently revising
the pamphlet, "Black at Swarthmore," which
is sent to African-American applicants.

Pro-Lifers Act to Promote
Alternatives to Abortion
By

Dan Green

. Swarthmore Students Advocating Life has made its presence felt for the first time in
several years. The newly reinstituted group handed out fliers at last week's lecture by
Sarah Weddington. The response to this activity was mixed. Some students were
dismayed, but Aarti Iyer '99, Co-coordinator of Pro-Choice Task Force said, "it was
really cool that they had the guts."
Co-presidents Cathy Polinsky '99 and Julie Schwendiman '99 founded the group in
part because they felt that equating feminism and a pro-choice viewpoint excluded them
from the feminist community on campus. According to SSAL's charter, the group
intends to "encourage sexual responsibility...support restrictions on legalized
abortion...participate in dialogues with other student groups" and increase their
visibility and respect on campus. According to Schwendiman, SSAL does not expect
to change individuals' views on abortion, but they wantto promote an alternative point
of view.
At the Weddington lecture, SSAL handed out a transcript of an interview with the
plaintiffs in the original cases that led to the nationwide legalization ofabortion.
The newly revamped SSAL board in Parrish features information about abortion.
According to the board, 1.6 million babies a year are aborted in the United States.
Additionally, in the U.S. "the abortion industry makes $5OO million a year, and $lO
billion worldwide.
SSAL meets weekly, and is attempting to expand its membership and avoid
confrontation with the Pro-Choice Task Force and other student groups. Interested
students may contact Polinsky or Schwendiman for more information.

For the past ten months, a group of seven
sophomores has been busy organizing the
Summer Community Learning Project for the
daughters of faculty and staff at Swarthmore.
The program targets approximately twenty
girls in grades five through seven and will run
from June 16 to June 28, 1997.
The project will focus on the three goals of
building community across socioeconomic
and racial lines, helping the girls to understand problems of gender inequality, and increasing self-esteem. These goals will be accomplished through a series of lessons oriented around group projects and outdoor activities. The organizers are intentionally basing their curriculum on an alternative, handson style of pedagogy in order to emphasize
the experiential aspects of learning. Along
with the academic curriculum, the group will

work to increase the girls' leadership and two to three times a week to develop lessons,
self-esteem skills, encouraging them to betest portions of their curriculum in local

Web Site Wins Award

Tavern Night Approved
Tavern Night, funded by the senior class, was held in Paces
last Thursday night. Senior Class President Tony
Cheesebrough first contacted Jen Leigh, Coordinator of Student Activites to obtain a party permit for Thursday. After
consulting with Assistant Dean Tedd Goundie, Leigh granted
the permit under the conditions that the event be funded
privately and not advertised publicly. This past Wednesday
Cheesebrough talked to Goundie once more, who agreed to
make Tavern Night a monthly event, under the conditions

described above.
Students who attended the event did not notice much
difference between the new event and Pub Nite. "It was a
warm, friendly atmosphere," said Rebecca Neff '97, one of
the senior class officers, and whoalso waitressed at the event,

"very similar to Pub Nite."

Beer and snacks were served while a live band performed.
The organizers chose not to use Party Associates, but instead
handled the door themselves. The event went uninterrupted
and ended at midnight as planned.
According to Cheesebrough, the senior class earned a total
of $420 from Tavern Night. The main purpose of the event
was to raise money for Senior Week. At the beginning of the
year, the senior class took out a loan of $3OO from the
President's Office to start off their fundraising drive. So far
the drive has resulted in a pre-formal and an ongoing vegetable plate and cake delivery service. "Senior Week is
supposed to be a time when seniors enjoy their last moments
at Swarthmore, and we hope to alleviate some of the financial
burden incurred [by the events organized during the week],"
Cheeseborough said.

NetGuide, a web site rating group,
recently awarded Swarthmore's
home page its prestigious NetGuide
Gold award. The efforts of the
college's new World Wide Web Editor, Adam Preset '96, are largely responsible for the achievement.
Preset first began his work on the
World Wide Web two and a half
years ago, while he was a junior. The
NetGuide citation is the second such
award Preset has been responsible
for obtaining for the college. The
first, a Top Five Percent award, designated the Computer Science
department's web site as among the
top five percent ofall web sites. The
NetGuide award isall the more gratifying for Preset because, he says, "It
is really rare for academic sites in

now-familiar arboreal theme in the
fall of 1995. Krattenmaker says the

The Housing Committee issued its latest
news release this Tuesday. The release outlines a few recommendations and set an
agenda for future discussions.
The first recommendation was that theCollege should reconsider the existing general
safety guidelines governing residence halls.
According to the news release, this recommendation was made in light of the popularity of halogen lamps, despite the fact that they
have proven to be a serious fire hazard. The
news release also recommends that the College alsoreview potential hazards such as hot
pots, irons and hot plates.
Secondly, the Housing Committee suggested that college security begin locking
residence halls in the evening. This was proposed as a step towards eventually having
dormitories locked at all times. The committee emphasized that now that all dorms have
installed access phones, the locked doors
would not present any inconvenience.
Finally, the Committee proposes that the
College charge a fee for high security storage. The tentative suggested charge is $1 per

item. The committee hopes that the additional charge would provide for longer hours
and possibly a van driver to transport student
boxes. It also hopes to arrange for more high
security storage space with college security.
Several topics were also suggested for later
consideration. First on the agenda is a discussion of the future of substance-free halls, as
well as the way in which they should be run.
Students with any ideas or suggestions should
contact Director of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal. It was recommended that current
housing blocks should be reviewed in order
to determine if the number of blocks should
be increased or decreased
In addition, the idea behind quite halls
will be reviewed. The committee hopes to
investigate whether quiet halls are really quiet
and whether the "quietness" of a hall is taken
into consideration during dormitory selection. Last of all, the committee wants to come
up with ways to prepare regular residents for
having their rooms occupied by other people,
such as athletes and conference attendees
during Winter Break. The release states that
it is likely that the College will use dorms
other than Parrish for temporary housing.

Housing Commitee Makes Recommendations

The Clinton Address
On Wednesday, February 4, President Clinton laid out his
agenda for his final term. He argued that even within budget
constraints, the Federal Government could improve education, modernize technology and increase health care.
Clinton urged Congress to pass a balanced budget without
amending the Constitution, and reform the campaign finance
laws by July 4. He also emphasized technology, especially
the Internet.
Clinton stated that education is his "number one priority."
He outlined a 10-point plan for improving education by
plugging classrooms into the Internet, helping schools make
repairs, and increasing federal assistance to college students.
According to experts, Clinton's program in education and
worker training will cost about $5l billion, an increase of 20
percent from the current year. He also proposed incremental
steps towards extending insurance to at least half of the 10
million children without health insurance in the United
States.
Clinton stated that his budget would "provide middle-class
tax relief to pay for education and health care, to help raise a
child, to buy and sell a home."
Clinton urged that the recentl reform bill be changed to
restore coverage to legal immigrants.
Clinton attempted to moti va' Americans to act, "We must
be shapers of events, not observers," he said. "For if we do
not act, the moment will pass
and we will lose the best
possibilities pi our futuie. We face no imminent threat, but
we do have an enemy: the enemy of our time is inaction."

and the students have also received preliminary acceptance
for a Swarthmore Foundation
grant. Turner commented, "The
support and encouragement has
really proven to us how dedicated the College is to helping
students receive a meaningful
education."
The program will be held in
the WRC. The group is currently recruiting participants.
They are also looking for a recent Swat graduate working or
studying in the field of education to serve as an adult counselor during the program.
Says Breazeale of her involvement, "I would like to
make a difference in these girls'
lives, to show them that they
can thrive and succeed no matter how the system seems to be
working against them." Nigrini
agrees, adding, "I hope to provide the girls with an alternative way of viewing the world
surrounding them and an excitement for discovery."

ruary 4, the team began by defeating Columbia
School of Journalism, 350-250. Ryan, a "J-school" alum, was excited to see her alma mater
in action, even if they were her opponents.
A delay in scheduling forced an overnight stay
in New York. Miller and Bush found themselves
on Times Square when the O.J. verdict was
announced on a giant television screen, watching reporters mill about for "man on the street"
interviews.

On Wednesday, the team lost a tight match to
Villanova, 240-180, knocking them out of the

competition. The team had qualified for the
round of 16 by going 4-0 in competition
over Christmas break, winning $2,000 in
scholarship money for Swarthmore's general scholarship fund with their victories
over Quinnipiac College, Chestnut Hill
College, and Southern Connecticut State
College.

Economist Paul Portnoy Gives Wilcox Lecture
By

Jessica Harbour

On Thursday, Dr. Paul Portnoy, formerly chief economist
Council of Environmental Quality, spoke on "Why Are
Economists Messing Around With Environmental Policy?"
in DuPont lecture hall. Portnoy is a member of the Executive
Committee of the Science Advisory Board of the Environmental Protection Agency and author of the book Footing the
Bill for Superfund Cleanups: Who Pays the Bill and How?
His talk was the annual Wilcox Lecture sponsored by the
Economics Department.
The central theme of Portnoy's speech was the increasing
role of economics in U.S. environmental policy since 1970,
when the government of President Nixon instituted many of
the current economic reforms that are in effect today. Portnoy
offered five reasons why economics now plays a prominent
role. First, there is the sheer amount of money spent on
enforcing environmental protection laws —some $l5O billion dollars in 1996, as determined by the EPA, paid by state
governments, corporations, and taxpayers.
Second, environmental protection methods are, by and
large, much more expensive now than they were in 1970.
Compounding the problem is the expensive nature of solutions in the laws of the early '7o's; industries not only had to
clean up after themselves, but had to do it using particular
processes, a requirement which stifled incentive for them to
develop less expensive technology on their own.
Third, the concern remains that businesses which invest
money in environmental cleanup and protection will not earn
a profit as easily as their cost-cutting competitors. Portnoy,
however, cited a 1985 Kennedy Foundation study which saw
at the

no evidence thatenvironmental regulation affected a business' s
prosperity. During the question-and-answer session after his
talk, however, Portnoy conceded to Jeremy Weinstein '97
that technological costs have increased significantly since
1985, rendering any judgments such as the Kennedy
Foundation's suspect.
Finally, Portnoy pointed out that the EPA is expected to
tighten standards under the Clean Air Act in the next several
months. In doing so, he said, the EPA is not allowed, due to
the original wording of the Clean Air Act, to take costs of new
regulation into account. Nevertheless, the EPA faces criticism from a Congress increasingly concerned with cutting
costs.

Portnoy also discussed recent attempts in Congress to
reform the original environmental bills and predicted such
efforts would come to a head in 1997. In 1994, he said, the
House of Representatives passed a bill which would have
subjected regulatory agencies such as the EPA to lawsuits if
they did not properly support their laws with benefit-cost
analyses. A similar bill, however, died in the Senate after a
year's filibuster by a Democratic minority. Since then, laws
have been passed to emphasize cost consideration in the Safe
Drinking Water Act and the Food Quality Protection Act.
In closing, Portnoy warned his listeners to listen to broad
environmental claims with a skeptical ear. Saying that
pollution is evil, he explained, ignores the trade-offwe make
every day in producing goods.
During the question-and-answer session, Portnoy spoke
about international agreements on pollution and creative
regulations, such as allowing "pollution permits" to be bought
and sold by companies.

of the entire college curriculum.
Now, don't get me wrong, ethnic
studies programs do contribute a great
deal to the educational offerings of
any institution. However, such programs hinder the transformation of
the entire college curriculum and
pedagogy to reflect intrinsic changes
in our society.

In fact, it would seem as though
they further marginalize the contributions of various groups and diminish the perceived intellectualism of
the study, in addition to ghettoizing
Black, Latino, Asian, female and faculty members from other groups into
certain niches within the academy
given the nature of ethnic studies
programs and their low status within
most institutions of higher learning.
Consider the fact that most colleges and universities only developed
ethnic studies programs in response
to student protest, not by their own
free will. Students outside of the socalled mainstream ofAmerica began
to demand greater representation of
their experience in the curriculum
and an end to the dominant
Eurocentric bias.
After a great deal of resistance,
several colleges and universities began to design ethnic studiesprograms
to meet the needs of the students and
adhere to certain academic "standards." As a result, ethnic studies
programs were created on several
campuses despite the fact that they
were often underfunded, understaffed

of an ethnic studies program often
coincided with a decrease in efforts
to diversify the entire college curriculum.
While students could take advantage of the few classes offered under
the auspices of the ethnic studies program, the rest of the curriculum remained largely unchanged. In other
words, students continued to receive

Is Swarthmore diverse? It depends. Diversity here usually involves race
and ethnicity, but not ideology or political leanings. At Swarthmore we
sometimes take our collective viewpoint for granted—because there are so
many liberal students here, we never take the trouble to question whether
there is any other legitimate viewpoint aside from our liberal one.
The other side exists; we all know that there are conservatives out there.But
instead of smirking at the fact that we can count all the active conservatives
on campus on two hands, perhaps we should be grateful that they provide us
with some ideological diversitv. There can be no politirnl dialogue without
two voices. So, whenever a conservative group daresraise its head, we should
be appreciative.
That's why we're pleased that Swarthmore Students Advocating Life
(SSAL) has been chartered again. It promises to contribute an alternative
viewpoint to the discussions about abortion issues on campus. SSAL has big
plans to educate the campus about the pro-life stance on abortion. For
instance, they took the opportunity at the Sarah Weddington lecture (sponsored in part by the Pro-Choice Task Force) to pass out literature presenting
the "other side" of the abortion argument.
This is good. While the majority of Swarthmore students are pro-choice in
some form or another (as the size of the Pro-Choice Task Force mailing list
will attest to), there is still a place here for a group like SSAL.

these and-other obstacles persist.
Ethnic studies programs have also
been heralded for their tendency to
diversify the faculty of several colleges. Often most Black Studies programs offer classes taught by primarily Black faculty and Women Studies courses tend to be taught by
women. Granted this increases the

number of Blacks, Latinos, Asians,
women and other groups among the
college faculty; however, this situation often promotes an idea, either
consciously or subconsciously, that
certain groups can only teach certain
types of classes. Furthermore, colleges can point to those few faculty
members of color as illustrations of
their commitment to diversity. Thus,
other departments lack faculty members of color.
To make matters worse, in this
environment of growing conservatism and public resentment of political correctness and multiculturalism,
several colleges have eliminated or
drastically diminished their ethnic
studies programs for "budgetary reasons." At the same time many black,
brown, yellow and female faces and
the classes they offered disappear

Responses to the State of the Union Address Liberals Should Listen
Reagan Gets Revenge
By

After 16 Years

Ben Fritz

President Clinton's State of the
Union address represented the fulfillment of a political agenda that has
been in place for many years. After
years of skirting the issue, the President and Congress are now determined to take on a fiscal responsibility that our government has avoided
for too long. The agenda of bipartisan
cooperation to balance the budget
thatPresident Clinton set out on Tuesday is a great triumph for an American leader. Unfortunately for Clinton
and the American people, it is not our
current President's triumph at all, but
rather the final victory of Ronald
Reagan and the policy revolution he
began 16 years ago.
When President Reagan came into
office in 1981, he promised a new
agenda that was nothing less than
revolutionary. In the mind of Reagan
and many of his supporters, government was nothing less than a threat to
Americans' liberty. His rhetoric depicted the U.S. government as an
inept, irresponsible thief wasting the
money of hard-working Americans.
"Government is like a big baby," he
declared, "a big appetite at one end
and no responsibility at the other."
The economic agenda which he proposed, known as "Reaganomics,"
represented a significant shift in priorities for federal economic policy,
withthe largest tax cuts in thenation's
history (largely benefitting the
wealthiest Americans), a massive
buildup in defense spending, and reductions in domestic spending. The
effects of these policies by the end of
his term were staggering. From 1981
to 1987, domestic discretionary

by Forcing the Current Administration into Spending Cuts

spending fell 19 percent while defense spending increased 50 percent
(adjusted for inflation), and tax revenue fell from 20.2 to 18.2 percent of
the GDP. These policies were exactly in line with the anti-government, pro-military vision Reagan had
expounded during the campaign.
There was one important part of
Reagan' s economic policy which was
not as widely celebrated in public by
the President and his economic advisors. The fall in tax revenue combined with massive defense outlays
and spending cuts, which were totally insufficient to keep the budget
in balance, created massive government deficits, the like of which our
country had never seen in peacetime.
Between 1980 and 1992, after 12
years of Reagan/Bush economic
policy, the national debt nearly quadrupled to $3.5 trillion. Without the
debt interest accumulated during the
Reagan and Bush presidencies, the
federal government would presently
be running a surplus.
The most significant point about
this gigantic increase in the federal
debt is that it did not come about bv
accident. Although Reagan supporters claim otherwise, huge deficits
were the inevitable and, indeed, intentionalresult ofReaganomics.Supply-siders like to blame the Democratic Congress for the deficits by
claiming they did not cut domestic
spending enough. The fact is, however, that to whatever extent Congress refused to grant Reagan the
discretionary spending cuts he proposed, they proposed concomitantand
sometimes even greater cuts in defense spending. In fact, over the eight
years ofhis presidency, Reagan asked

Congress for $lB.l billion more in
spending than was finally passed into
law. The president's own budget director at the time, David Stockman,
later admitted the recklessness of the
policy he helped implement. In his
book The Triumph ofPolitics, Stockman describes Reaganomics as a
"lapse into fiscal indiscipline on a
scale never before experienced in
peacetime."
It was more than just willful indiscipline, however. Reaganomics created a fiscal predicament for the federal government that has fundamentally reshaped fiscal policy. Since the
American people and theDemocratic
Congress would never allow the massive cuts in social spending and entitlements that Reagan and his fellow
anti-government crusaders preferred,
they designed an alluring economic
policy that simply passed thatburden
onto future generations and allowed
the President to benefit from a temporary economic boom caused, in
part, by the stimulus to the economy
created by the deficits. Reagan and
his advisors knew that the massive
buildup of debt would eventually
force the government to either slash
spending to bring the budget into
balance or face fiscal disaster as interest payments ate up the entirebudget. That day of reckoning which
Reaganomics made inevitable 16
years ago has finally come, as a Democratic President has pledged to work
with a Republican Congress to bring
the budget into balance without cutting defense spending orraising taxes.
Not very long ago, the thought ofa.
Democratic president proposing significant reductions in social spending and cuts of over $l5O billion in

Medicare while simultaneously cutting taxes would have been unheard
of. However, the political atmosphere
created by the huge debt the government has run up forced President
Clinton, both in his original deficit
reduction plan passed in 1993 and his
current balanced budget proposal, to
give up most of the domestic investments he and other Democrats had
previously called for and instead to
make deficit reduction his top priority. With the Republican takeover of
Congress in 1994, this priority became even more urgent as the political atmosphere not only disallowed
any new investments, but madeeliminating the deficit by 2002 a top priority for Democrats and Republicans
alike.
President Reagan surely could not
be more pleased than to see a Republican Congress and a Democratic
president working together to complete his agenda of slashing government spending on social programs.
Mr. Reagan and his followers would
surely be encouraged to learn that
deficit reduction proposals enacted
in the 104th Congress and currently
being proposed contain significant,
disproportionate cuts in programs that
benefit poor Americans while not
touching defense spending or considering raising taxes. Although it is
unsure right now to what extent he is
cognizant to enjoy it, Ronald Reagan
has finally succeeded in bringing the
federal government to its knees, and
he did not even have to take the
"burden" of smashing the federal
safety net onto himself. His economic
policies have pushed a Democratic
president into finishing his agenda
for him.

Other Solutions Exist for Solving Budget and Education Problems than Relying on Bipartisanship
By

Neena Shenai

In the Stateof the Union speech on
Tuesday evening, President Clinton
emphasized the importance of bipartisanship and the prospective of both
parties working together. In fact, the
proposals in work of oratory cannot
be disputed by either party in most
cases, in principle. Mr. Clinton cited
that "the enemy of our time is inaction." Shall we equate inaction to
partisan politics?
I have argued previously that bipartisanship cannot be carried to an
extent that our political parties begin
to lose their identities. We, as Americans, elect our senators and representatives to represent our beliefs,
whether they are Republican or
Democratic. Essentially, we don't
want donkeys with elephant ears or
pachydermsresembling donkeys. Our
political parties are distinct entities
and should remain so. Christopher
Buckley, editor of the Forbes FYI
magazine, recently wrote an editorial
piece in the New York Times under
the headline "Let's Keep the Pol in
Politics." He argued that bickering
and disagreement wield the best results for our country by suggesting
that the great leaders in our past wert
not the "Great Healers" but rather the
"Great Dividers." Also, my U.S. Representative George W. Gekas, from
17th District PA, whom I spoke with
shortly after the election, raised the
same points. The Congressman suggested that Clinton was adopting
Republican plans, such as the idea of
a balanced budget, and then saying
that its passage this would need bi-

College

partisan support. Mr. Clinton must
remember that it is the Democratic
party that needs to be lobbied to adopt
a "conservative plan," not the Republicans. Bipartisanship is not stealing ideas and then rallying support
for them as ifthey were one's own.
The idea of the balanced budget,
though, is one of the most disputable
points of theState ofthe Union speech.
Mr. Clinton is calling for legislation
as opposed to the Republicans who
are aiming for a constitutional amendment. From a purely economic standpoint, Mr. Clinton is probably correct
to point out that "a balanced budget
amendment could cripple our country in time ofcrisis." Without using
too much economic jargon, if both
the Presidentand the Republicans are
speaking of a high employment balanced budget, there should definitely
be an "escape hatch" built into either
plan for times of economic slump.
Otherwise, a balanced budget could
severely damage our economy. On
the other hand, legislation is almost
as easily repealed as it is implemented.
We see this happening with the stringent welfare bill which was signed
into law in August. Though an election ploy for Clinton, the bill has
recently come under scrutiny from
both Democrats and Republicans
alike. Just this weekend, during the
National Governors' Association
Conference in Washington, even
Republican governors, such as
George Pataki, lobbied to amend the
welfare bill. Who is to say that this
will not happen withbalance-' h ' ldgct
legislation? With a balanced budget
amendment, legislators will be forced

to "tighten their belts" and spend
only as much as tax revenues allow

which should result in very controlled
growth of the government. Also, with
the federal government borrowing
less, we can promote more private
investment. Though we already have
very low interest rates, shrinking the
federal government will, in the long
run, see the growth of the private
sector. We, as a country, need to
consider the benefits and disadvantages of both options in order to ensure the best future results.
Although the balanced budget debate will dictate economic factors,
education, the President's top priority for the year, will ultimately dictate the future of America's children.
Mr. Clinton has proposed a ten-point
education plan with a $5l billion
price tag. It includes enacting national education standards by 1999
which will require fourth graders to
be tested in reading and eighth graders in math, and it also proposes pursuing national teaching standards to
preserve and elevate the quality of
teaching. Third, the President wants
to increase literacy among eight year
olds through a "mobilize[d] citizen
army." He also has encouraged the
expansion of the Head Start Program
and giving parents a choice of public
schools for their children. Next, he
suggested character education (a
rather conservative term), school
renovation, and providing more
HOPE scholarships which include a
$l5OO tax deduction for community
college tuition He also proposed an
increase in Pell Grants and even up to
a $lO,OOO tax deduction for college

focused on job training programs,
proposing a G.I. Bill for Workers,
which would channel the grants directly to the job trainee rather than
through a Federal job training program. His tenth point added the goal
of securing access to the information
age for all the nation's schools.
Overall, the plan contains some
valuable proposals that will better the
country. Setting national standards
for teaching and student proficiency
are excellent ideas. Also, expanding
tax credits for higher education should
be effective. However, we must realize that there are already a a handful
of education programs in place. Before we begin adding new programs,
we must consider which of the existing ones are defunct. Otherwise, we
will continue to fund superfluous programs while that money could be
allocated more efficiently. Who could
argue against the attempt to bring the
internet to every school? This is not
an ethical question, it is one of logistics, and it can be accomplished with
prudent spending.
Thus, education, the balanced budget, and bipartisanship dominated the

to Their Own Lessons
By Brendan Nyhan &
Hillary Thompson

"You better watch your back." Personal threats such as this do occur at
Swarthmore. In contrast to past
threats, the impetus for this statement
was not race, ethnicity or sexuality
but, rather, ideology. Why are political beliefs the last acceptable prejudice at Swarthmore?
This is, and always has been, a
liberal college. Thus, the students
and faculty who are drawn to Swarthmore are overwhelmingly left ofcenter. Many savor being in arare liberal
majority. However, majorities tend
to oppress minorities, and Swarthmore is no different.There are roughly
fifty people on the Swarthmore Conservative Union mailing list, of whom
approximately ten are vocal, on a
campus of over 1300. These conservatives face hostility for questioning
the dominant views at the College.
Professors often dismiss conservatism and students frequently fail to
consider the views of conservatives,
even attacking them for their beliefs.
These students justify such actions
by asserting that Swarthmore is a
liberal place and, thus, conservatives
have no right to be here and should
expect such treatment. This attitude
is self-perpetuating, ensuring an increasingly hostile climate to conservatives and a resulting decrease in
the number of conservatives at the
college.
Moreover, many students demonize conservatives to unite most
Swatties against a perceived enemy
in a typical "us vs. them" situation.
Polarization such as this divides our
community. Unfortunately, this division often goes unrecognized due to
the overwhelming disparity in size
between the groups. In a community
which is so strongly oriented toward
helping those marginalized in soci-

ety, those who disagree withthe Swarthmore majority are ironically relegated to the periphery. Those who
rightfully condemn persecution
should not practice it on campus.
Swarthmore professes to value diversity. Members of the college rejoice at the diversity of the class of
2000. The college's viewbook includes a statement saying, "our diversity is not only morally responsible, it's educationally sound. You
get a lot more out of an academic
discussion when different perspectives are represented." By this logic,
dissenting views are valuable to a
Swarthmore education, and students
as well as faculty should go out of
their way to ensure free and open
discourse. Criticismis necessary,both
ofconservatives in the outside world
and of liberals at Swarthmore, and
furthers the education of all students
by questioning prevailing assump-

tions and beliefs.
The writers do not advocate ideological affirmative action to achieve
these ends. Tolerance, if not open
acceptance of political diversity,
would make Swarthmore a more unified community and a stronger educational institution.
Swarthmore needs conservatives.
"If there are any persons who contest
a received opinion, or who will do so
if law or opinion will let them, let us
thank them for it, open our minds and
listen to them, and rejoice that there is
someone to do for us what we otherwise ought, if we have any regard for
either the certainty or the vitality of
our convictions, to do with much
greater labor for ourselves." John
Stuart Mill, On Liberty.
Brendan Nyhan is an officer in
College Democrats, and Hillary Thompson is an officer in Swarthmore
Conservative Union. They ask not to
be harmed for their bipartisan collaboration.

Letter to the Editor
Students

are Not to Blame for E-mail

To the Editor:
In your editorial "Stop the e-mail
madness" you call upon the campus
to cut out thefrivolous e-mails: "Let's
face it: these emails are annoying." In
a concurring e-mail of his own, Dean
Goundie asks for "cooperation to stop
sending these messages." Although
we're just as tired as everyoneelse of
17k e-mails titled "Haverford PreGame Party," we don't think blame
should be placed squarely on the
shoulders of the student body. The
faculty and administration are just as
culpable, if not more so, for the recent rash of all-campus e-mail madness. We therefore implore the faculty and administrators to exercise
the same "little restraint, arising from
the use of common sense" that your
editorials expects from Swarthmore
students.
We imagine the concept of the reserved-students list was created so
that individuals could alert the student body about important issues that
justified the attention of the majority
of students. As you note, the service
was once available for anyone with
access to e-mail. However, there were
soon repeated abuses in which students substituted all campus e-mails
for posting on NewsWatcher, advertising in the Weekly News, or hanging
signs across campus. The powersthat-be at the Computing Center decided to cut off student access, and
restrict the service to Student Council members, as well as faculty and
administrators, who would presumably use the list for more responsible
purposes. As your editorial aptly
states, "no one wanted us to get the
inane e-mails we've been getting
lately."
In the time since then, we have
seen repeated messages whose justifications for a place in our 'ln Boxes'
have been pretty questionable. We' ve
received countless reminders about
the "Frozen Foote Race" telling us to
"Catch the IM Spirit." We're not bashing the professors and staff who have
sent us these messages, but if Sherri
Johnson is going to e-mail all students to remind them to fill out a
Computing Center survey, we see
nothing to discourage students, like
Victoria Petitt, from using an e-mail
list to solicit tutors for theHomework
Enrichment Program.
Fundamentally, we see a hypocritical double-standard inrestricting student access to all-campus e-mailwhile
faculty and staff abuse abounds. Are
students any less members of the
college community? Are faculty's

Madness

ideas, suggestions, and advertising
of the potential for frozen feet any
more meritous than students'? As
your editorial quiterightly points out,
"We are not suggesting that [any of]
these more recent e-mails have not
had a worthy message, just that these
e-mails are not quite the proper means
of reaching out to the whole student
body." We agree. Therefore, we beseech the faculty and administration
to finally self-impose a limit to the
use of all campus e-mail.
Dean Goundie makes an interesting point. He says that the student's
recent e-mails carry an extra threat
that the reserved list does not; they
cause computer probems for many
and may pose a threat to the system.
We think this fact places the hypocrisy in starker relief. Why do nonstudents have access to the reserved
list, while students are placed at a
technological disadvantage and then
given restricted access because of
that disadvantage?
Goundie notes that students can go
to Student Council for permission to
send out a reserved-list mailing. But

why aren't faculty similarly reigned
in? To the best of our knowledge,
they currently aren't—if they are,
then whoever is doing the censoring
simply isn't exercising enough discretion.
Ignoring the hypocrisy for a moment, when so many professors, administrators and coaches abuse the
list to advertise their own particular
cause, no matter how worthwhile or
frivolous, we the students are left
with a curious example to follow. A
faculty member's thoughts on the
Sharpies Christmas tree broke
through the barrier of sending frivolous all-campus emails long before
Willets did. Dean Goundie states that
"such messages may be considered
violations of the "Statement on Computing" (pp. 24-26 in the Student
Handbook) in that they can be viewed
as "excess use of shared resources"
and often represent "junk mail," and
as such senders are subject to adjudication." Whoa. Watch out Professor
Frost.
We all know those crazy kids in
Willets are wacky. But contrary to
your editorial's assertion, it is not
their "example" Swarthmore students
have decided to follow. It's the
faculty's and staffs. So a message to
the next professor about to let us all
know about the next lecture, panel or
basketball game: stop the e-mail madness.

Woody Makes It Hard Not To Love Everyone Says I Love You
By

Patrick "Mr. Cairo" Runkle

The

lights went down. Trailers for some
upcoming art movies played. Then, I
had a glorious out-of-body experience,
Woody Allen's new musical Everyone Says I
Love You. For a brief 100 minutes, the
cosmos was in order.
First, I have to admit to being something of
a Woody Allen fan. He is amember of a small
group of directors, including Akira Kurosawa
and Walter Hill, who have seemingly never
made a bad movie. Therefore, criticism of a
new Woody Allen is a daunting task: how
does one criticize something that is, at its
worst moments, about 20 times better than
Hollywood's normal weekly fare?
In Everyone Says ILove You, there's nothing to criticize, because Woody has it all
right. When I heard about this movie, I was
worried the musical numbers might be similar to the Greek Chorus of Mighty Aphrodite,
Woody's last flick. While I liked that movie
as a whole, the Greek Chorus seemed more
like a gimmick than an artistic decision.
My fears were dispelled when, as Everyone
Says ILove You opens, Edward Norton sings
"Just You, Just Me" to Drew Barrymore in
front of a Manhattan fountain. It's a simply
wonderful moment, and it evoked a feeling
that didn't stop until the movie was over.
Woody is always one of his own best assets, and so it's a lot offun to see him taking
center stage in the goings-on. Here, he plays
Joe, a New York writer living in Paris, happily divorced from his wife Steffi (Goldie
Hawn), who still lives in New York and has
since married Bob (Alan Alda, a recent and
wonderful Woody regular). Joe is pretty

unlucky when it comes to women, and, as the

Be Sure To Check Out
The Absolute
Best of Woody Allen!

movie opens, he has just been dumped by his
current flame Giselle. He flies to New York
for advice and comfort.
When Joe returns to Europe, he falls for a
younger woman from New York, Von (Julia
Roberts). As he tries to work his way into her
heart, everyone else in the movie has romantic turmoil.
Joe's daughter, Skylar
(Barrymore), gets engaged and gets cold
feet; his other daughter, D.J., gets engaged
about 4 times, and his ex-wife's new children, Lane and Laura, fall for the same guy.
I've left out lots of stuff, too, and, indeed,
of all of Woody's New York movies, this is
probably the one in which the most stuff is
happening. It's delightful, and the way in
which the songs are woven into the rest of the
movie is quite wonderful. The musical numbers are sometimes contemplative (Woody
sings "I'm Through With Love" overlooking
Venice), sometimes joyous (the clerks at the
jewelry shop sing with joy at Norton &
Barrymore's engagement), but always tasteful. When I think back on it, the songs are
perfectly supplementary, putting the perfect
'spin' on each scene without banging you on
the head (like Evita).
The real standout sequence in the movie is
a wonderful scene in which Joe and his exwifedance on the banks of the Seine in Paris.
It is augmented with special effects, as Goldie
Hawn soars about, but it is the perfect climax
to a magical movie experience.
This movie is something of an accomplishment. It's fresh, exciting and yet old-fashioned, quirky, and touching. In short, it's a
perfect Woody Allen movie. I loved every
second of Everyone Says I Love You.

Power-Hungry Mafiosos Take LPAC by Storm

"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse."
This is a classic Marlon Brando line from
the movieT/ie Godfather, being shown on
campus tonight. This is an offeryou certainly
shouldn't refuse! A masterpiece by Francis
Ford Coppola, The Godfather packs enough
punch to knock out a hundred mobsters...wait,
that's what happens in the movie.
The Godfather is one of the classic Mafia
movies of all time (although we only remember three other Mafia flicks: Goodfellas, Casino and Oscar starring a stoic Sylvester
Stallone). Marlon Brando stars as The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone, the Italian-American head honcho of the notorious Corleone
crime organization based in New York City.
The Corleone family, well-known for its
merciless killing and illegal scams, is also
one incredible group of actors, including
Robert Duvall as Vito's right-hand man and
adopted son Tom, James Caan (with hair) as
Vito's hot-headed son, Sonny, and, finally,
Al Pacino as the non-conformist son, Michael,
who eventually takes over the "family
business"(what supreme irony). We suppose
we should mention the two main women,
TaliaShire as Connie Corleone, Vito's daughter, and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams,
Michael's girlfriendand, later, his wife. However, their parts are so devoid of power and
influence that they will thoroughly disgust
anyone with feminist tendencies. So don't
come looking for any fiery vixens—as Vito
says, "Women and children can make mistakes, but men can't."
The movie begins slowly at Connie's wedding in 1945 (to a husband who later uses her
as a punching bag—but don't worry, he gets
strangled by the impressively vengeful
Corleones). The opening scenes set up an
aging Don Corleone, withBrando's characteristically gravelly voice, as the head of a
vast criminal network controlling most of the
gambling and politics in the country. As the

complex plot unfurls, the rivalries between
the Five Families (the five main Italian families controlling the Mafia) escalate into an
all-out war beginning with an attempt on Don
Corleone's life. Although he survives the
shooting, he is incapacitated and is forced to
eventually pass control of the family to
Michael. In between, many (many) people

ness."
And ifthat isn't enough, on Saturday night,
The Godfather strikes (kills?) again! The epic
sequel, The Godfather, Part 11, carries the
Corleone family saga both into the future and
back to the past. This time around, the cast
from the original Godfather returns, minus
James Caan and Marlon Brando, and with the

addition of Robert DeNiro as the young Vito

Corleone.

Francis Ford Coppola introduces a new
element to the series, alternating the action in
the film between the founding ofthe Corleone
family in the first decades of the 1900s and
the present crisis in Nevada underthe leadership ofMichael Corleone. The movie opens
with an 11-year old Vito Corleone fl-einp *a
America, after his family is killed by a very
insensitive Mafia leader. Throughout the
movie, we see Vito Corleone's rise from a
jobless immigrant to, well, The Godfather. In
the present, we watch Michael Corleone
struggle with internal family problems (no,
the family turtle did not die again) and the
sinister, calculating Hyman Roth. The women

outbursts, but essentially remain insipid and

Restaurant Review

R-Way Does it Your Way—Really!
By Brantley Bryant
&

Rachel Buurma

Greetings,

Swatties. This is the first in
an indefinite number of restaurant
reviews in which we hope to give
advice to everyone who's getting sick of
Sharpies. It's a dangerous world out there,
and Swatties should be armed with the right
information before they venture out into the
wide and wonderful world of restaurants
where you don't have to eat off trays.
As our opener, we're going to explore one
of the wonders of the Baltimore Pike. There
are many businesses on the Pike that Swatties
don't know about, and the R-Way diner is
one of the best.
The R-Way (get it..."our way") diner is a
small, family-run establishment where the
staff will quickly get to know, or at least
recognize, you. It's a traditional diner setting
that looks like it was built sometime in the
60's, so the atmosphere is pretty cool, very
bright and clean, with big windows so you
can watch the Pike traffic go by. It's located
right on the Pike, a little ways down from

pitiful.
The movie has a different feel from the
first, focusing more on Michael's personal
problems than theCorleonefamily as a whole.
Michael's character is developed much more
fully, as the movie reveals his evolving relationships with his wife, his siblings, and his
children. A fair numberof touching moments
are incorporated among the tense struggles of
the Mafia thugs (but don't worry, lots of
people are still killed). Michael's philosophy
has also changed from the first movie: "I
don't feel like I have to wipe everyone out,
just my enemies." The other characters develop as well: Connie gains some semblance
of a personality (she's a floozy rather than a
punching bag); Kay works up enough courage to stand up to herhusband (perhaps given
confidence by her new hair colour); Fredo,
the long-ignored elder brother of Michael
surfaces to cause some trouble and Tom
well, he's the same, only minus a lot of hair.
The Godfather, Part II is also presented on
a larger scale than the first. It's more sweeping, taking you from Nevada \o Havana, from
New York to Italy, from jails to presidential
balls. The.family business expands into hotel
management and foreign stocks. Both the
New York of the 191 Os and the Nevada of the
late 1950s are vividly brought to life. Oh, and
for any one who likes foreign languages, a
large part of the dialogue is carried on in
Italian with English üb-titles. All of this
worldliness lets you leave the movie feeling
very cultured.
aspert ofboth these movies that really
""-m
anart from many modern producset*
tions is the careful attention paid to detail, to
simply observing scenes without cutting after two seconds ofeach shot. Coppola shows
more patience than most directors; there are
many scenes of crowds and festivals, or family occasions, accompanied by background
music and no dialogue. Although this adds to
the interminable length of the movies, it is
definitely worth the extra time. Everyone
else waits for The Godfather, so why can't
you? Do him a little favor, he'll do one for
you. He'll give you a great movie!

are shot, stabbed, and strangled, horses get
decapitated, and Michael goes on an allexpense-paid, although not risk-free, vacation to beautiful Italy.
You should see this movie, just for Marlon
Brando, if not for the dramatic, well-conceived plot, the other superb actors, and just
about everything else. The movie is long, but
it keeps youi attention with its intensity and
suspense. A word ofcaution: even for today' s
standards, this film, released in 1971, is not
for those with weak stomachs. (Remember
what we said about horses decapitated?) And
also watch out for the off-hand racist comments. And the pathetic, simpering women.
Then again, this is the New York underworld
of the 1950s which the Corleones dominated,
and Coppola does an admirable job depicting
the cold-blooded cruelty ofthis "family busi-

Genuardi' s supermarket. Look carefully, because it's not that easy to spot.
The food is traditional diner fare with a
little more variation: it's pretty good and the
portions are large.
They have the
standard range of
breakfast foods,
burgers, dinner
platters like fried
chicken or fish,
pizza, hoagies,
and greek gyros.
The prices are
pretty low, and it
beats Denny's any
day.
Something we
were surprised by was the sheer size of their
cups. We know it sounds silly, but they really
give you a gallon of Coca-Cola for about a
dollar.Their milkshakes are rather large too,
and are homemade, so they're really thick
and good. Rachel likes the egg sandwhiches,
although Brantley questions their validity.
There are some odd signs that say "Casino

Patrick "Mr. Cairo" Runkle

Customers in Back" out front. We haven't
figured out the sinister meanings of that yet.
If you get any leads, please e-mail us.
The one disadvantage of the R-way is its
hours, which are pretty hard to fit into a
Swattie schedule. It opens early (these are
rough estimations) on weekdays and closes
around 7. Basically, if it's daylight outside,
there's achance that it's open...if it's dark, it's
probably closed. The R-Way has limitedhours
on Sunday, only from 10 to 2, we think. Don't
quote us.
The R-Way is a great place to go for lunch
(or on Sundays if you miss that brunch thing),
it's cheap and the food is good. It may not be
fine dining, but it's very close to Swat and the
staff is really friendly. Try it sometime.

R-Way Diner,

Allen has averaged a
movie a year for the past 20
years. So, I've prepared a list
of lesser-known, must-see Woody Allen
movies, in no particular order. They're
all available on video.
SLEEPER (1973). A perfect bridge
between Woody's slapstick period and
his modern comedies, Sleeper is also
his most unique movie, and it's my
absolute favorite. He plays Miles Monroe, a New Yorker who goes in for an
ulcer operation and wakes up 200 years
later in a bizarre police state. He gets
mixed up with some revolutionaries,
poses as a robot, and fights with a giant
blob of chocolate pudding. Both a ridiculous sci-fi spoof and a sly social
satire, this movie has everything.
BROADWAY DANNY ROSE (1984).
Certainly a lesser-known Woody Allen
title, but no less fun. This 1984 film, in
glorious black and white, features
Woody as the title character, a smalltime New York entertainer's agent, who
has a new singing act, Tony Apollo. He
has to get Tony's mob girlfriend to the
show before Tony has to sing. Various
mob highjinks ensue.
ANOTHER WOMAN (1988). One of
Allen's few forays into non-comedies.
In this look at a woman who has made
emotional compromises in her life that
she doesn't even know about, he gives a
gripping, psychological portrait that is
pretty much unparalleled in modern
American cinema. A true actor's showcase, the film stars Gena Rowlands, Mia
Farrow, lan Holm, Gene Hackman, and
John Houseman in his final performance.
MANHATTAN (1980). While Annie
Hall certainly established Woody as the
master of the neurotic New York relationship comedy, this movie takes it a
step further by showing Woody's mastery of film as a visual medium. Manhattan is a beautiful movie; every skyline and even every room interior takes
on a life ofits own. Woody stars as one
of his normal types ofcharacters; in this
movie he falls in love with a 16-yearold (Mariel Hemmingway) after having
been dumpedby his wife (Meryl Streep)
for another woman. The ever-reliable
and ever-wonderful Diane Keaton also
stars.

Z£L/G( 1983). It'shard to find people
whohave seen Zelig, and that's a shame,
because it's quite wonderful. Zelig is
something of an experiment. It's a fake
documentary about a man, Henry Zelig
(Woody), who cannot help but change
his race, ideology, and personal appearance to match whoever is around him.
Another sly social commentary, Zelig
turns into something like Forrest Gump
(but a whole lot better—trust me) as he
pops up all over early 20th century
history.
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
(1989). I think this is pretty much the
pinnacle of Allen's serio-comic relationship movie period. Itcontains a brilliant and moving performance by Martin Landau (who should have won the
Oscar for this long before Ed Wood) as
an aging and successful dentist with a
large family. His affair with a stewardess (Anjelica Huston) threatens to break
up his marriage, and he hires his brother
(Jerry Orbach) to kill her. Meanwhile,
Woody (playing an unsuccessful documentarian) grapples with marital problems. Alan Alda also pops up in a delightful role as an arrogant businessman. It's a multi-character patchwork,
like the rest of his movies, but in
Crimes & Misdemeanors the characters
are so sharply drawnthat it almost makes
you forget you're watching a movie.

Happy

New Year! According to the
ChineseLunar Calendar, today is the
first day of the year of the Ox.
The celebration of the Lunar New Year
emphasizes good luck, prosperity, longevity, and health. Most Chinese households
engage in traditional family rituals and
foodways. Stephanie Wang '99 said that her
family usually has a traditional dinner on
New Year's Eve. Only special foods are
eaten at this meal: for instance, fish is a usual
dish because it rhymes with the word for
"extra" or "left over." It symbolizes something left over from the old year, for instance,
riches or good fortune. Other foods are eaten
because they sound like other good words
that will bring about prosperity.
There are also several traditions that may
be observed, according to Wang and Jenny
Yang 'OO. For instance, one is not supposed
to shower on New Year's Day, so that the
good fortune from the year doesn't get washed
off. There are also rules governing when
one's house may be cleaned and when one
may eat certain kinds of foods. But, these
traditions are not often followed by Chinese
families who reside in the United States.
The Swarthmore Asian Organization
(SAO) and the Pacific Rim Organization
(PRO) are working to bring the experience of
Chinese New Year to campus. PRO worked

with the Sharpies staff—including Linda
McDougal—to provide entertainment last
night at dinner, with dancers from the Philadelphia Asian American Youth Association
performing theLion Dance, and a folk dance.
SAO is hosting a SAC-funded New Year's
party for the campus tonight in Paces.
Not quite Times Square
On the streets of New York City's
Chinatown, the focus is on Lion Dancing
performances during the week of the New
Year. The Lion Dance is performed through
the streets to exorcise evil spirits and to bring
the blessings of good luck to business and
social organizations. The dancers are students from local gungfu martial art schools;
theLion Dance is the premier performance of
Chinese martial arts.
Each troupe consists of at least one 2person male lion puppet (female lions are not
used in New York), one drummer, and two
membersplaying the gongand cymbals. Most
groups also use one or two masked performers or "teasers" —Buddhas who lead the lion.
They may be male or female, and are distinguished by masks, robes, and movement styles.
At the head of the group is a rectangular
banner with the name of the school or organization. Exploding firecrackers are used to
frighten away inauspicious spirits.
The Lion Dance depicts the legendary lion
that stole the vegetable of longevity from the

sleeping Buddha:
"The story goes [...] that the Buddha was
looking for the vegetable of longevity. So he
goes through the mountains—all over
China—looking for it. And in doing so, he
finally finds it. So after a long and arduous
journey, he rakes it up and he harvests it. The
Buddha was so elated that he finally got the
vegetable of longevity that he fell asleep
from fatigue. Now, unbeknownst to him, a
lion comes out of the cave. He moves around
and he sees the vegetable. Now, the Buddha,
he's sleeping...The lion sees him. It doesn't
know who the Buddha is and doesn't know
what the vegetable is, so hp r»«ri«i« AnH
the lion jostles him—tries to wake him up.
And [Buddha] thinksit's just a fly and tries to
swat it away and finally [the lion] sees the
vegetable and he plays with the vegetable like
a curious cat. Finally he eats it. While he's
eating it the Buddha wakes up. He sees [that
the lion] ate it. Now he's mad. He tries everything to kill the lion—tries to make the lion
jump off the hill, jump off the bridge —anything to try and get it in trouble, right? So he
teases him in every way: throws firecrackers
at him, 'Come on in and get me if you dare'
he does all sorts of things. He'll stick his rear
end in his face, he picks his nose and throws
it at him, sweats and throws it at him. You
know, he tries...a little break dance routine,
Chinese style. And thus comes the 'teaser.'
So if you see the Buddha [during the Lion
'«

—

Dance performance], he teases the lion all the
time, he comes in and takes him all around the
stores" (Slovenz in The Drama Review, 83).
Though frequently performed in China, the
Lion Dance is not common in the United
States; even in New York, it is involving
fewer and fewer members of the Chinese
community. Activists are doing their best to
encourage the preservation of their culture,
but perhaps in vain. The most pessimistic of
them are predicting that within a decade or so,
the Lion Dance may disappear completely
from Chinese-American cultural tradition.
Pick and spit
Another more complex and potent ritual is
known as choi cheung in Cantonese (literally
as "begging and taking the pure green vegetable"), known in English as "picking the
greens." The green is the vegetable of longevity that appears in Chinese mythology.
Hosts construct elaborate displays of greens
either inside their establishment or out on the
street. Each green-picking is a puzzle that
challenges the martial artist's physical and
mental skills. Solving the puzzle requires
knowledge ofChinese classical literature and
the masterful execution of gungfu.
The final step is to chew the green and spit
the pieces in four directions. If the performers
fail to correctly pick thegreens, they move on
to another establishment, and no good luck
will be forthcoming that year.

intentions but with gullible widows, or
so I'm hoping. (I'm aware of the bastardly status of that garbled concatenation of
two otherwise respectable proverbs, but it
sounds good, so shut up).One subject as yet
unaddressed by any ofmy economics "classes"
is the acquisition of wealth through prudent
choice of spouse. The general response from
most people when I reveal my major (apparently economics, according to my transcript)
is unabashed envy at the wealth I will inevitably accrue because I am so learned in the ways
of money.
That's not true, and the weight on my soul
of the utter falsity of this sentiment has motivated me to confess here my genuine bereavement at the slim prospects of my finding a
job.The way I see it, there are three ways I can
approach life after graduation. One is impoverished hedonism. The other is some form of
low-exertion, high-yield gold-digging (artoc-

For thousands of years, the Chinese have

WAMs (Westerners Adverse to Multiculturalism) out there may see this as just

system features a rotating array of twelve

who take Screw Your Roommate a bit too
seriously) but a carrel in McCabe is not the
place to placate those raging hormones. So if

topic "Dating at Swarthmore College." Considering the fact thatvery little dating, at least
in the conventional sense, actually occurs on
campus, the fact that we are completely obsessed with this topic must say something
about us. I'm not sure what it says exactly,
but I bet it's pretty depressing and I'd rather
not think about it. Instead of "Dating at
Swarthmore," I think we should change it to
"Gossip at Swarthmore." I and a few wellchosen compatriots could lie camouflaged in
strategically advantageous positions across
campus and chronicle those who perform the
illustrious "walk of shame" in the wee hours
of Saturday morning. Of course, I would give
you every opportunity to explain the perfectly rational and respectable reason why
you were staggering across Parrish Beach at
6 am on a Saturday, clutching an empty bottle
of tequila and wearing only one sock. You
were probably just on your way to the nearest
laundry room when you spied that bottle on
the path and decided to recycle it. I probably
won't print that rational and respectable reason, but I'll happily let you tell it to me if it
makes you feel better.
Some frosh also have expressed an interest
in reading an article that reviews the protocols for the impending Screw Your Roommate Dance. I believe the only advice I have
to offer you concerning this dance can be
summed up in two words: mortifying humiliation. Plan it and expect it. This is the only
administratively-sanctioned chance for you
to revenge yourself on your roommate for
buying that Winger's Greatest Hits CD and
eating all the Double ChocolateMilano cook-

ies.

The final suggestion for the column this
week was an in-depth investigation into the
following thought provoking question: if you
were allowed to eat only one food for the rest
of your life, and you were given the choice
between Pringles and Junior Mints, which
would you choose? A hard decision, I know,
but one that must be made before you can
really begin to understand the nature of your
own humanity. JuniorMints will satisfy that
sometimes overwhelming desire for chocolate while leaving a clean, minty taste in your
mouth. However, if you eat too many, these
mints have been known to leave a very very
painful, raised welt on the roof of your oral
cavity.
On the other hand, Pringles, so flavorful
and crisp, come in a really nifty can, and
when two chips are positioned correctly on
lips, they form a cool duck face that will
delight and amaze your friends. Unfortunately, Pringles have been known to cause
such severe dehydration that people's heads
have actually imploded. It's true, trust me, I
swear it.
By the way, to all the people who have
helped me to write this week's article, I want
to offer you a heartfelt and hearty thanks for
nothing.

Badminton Needs a Fresh
Formula versus Bryn Mawr
Jennifer Klein

By

The women's varsity badminton
team faced a tough schedule this week

with matches against Albright College, Harcum College, and Bryn
Mawr. First on Saturday, the team
traveled to Albright where they won
3-2. Vanya Tepavcevic '97 was the
sole singles winner, defeating her opponent 10-12, 11-7, 11-3. Both
doubles teams also stepped up to their
challengers and clinched the win for
Swarthmore. The first doubles team
of Tam Doan '97 and Catherine
Chomat '97 won with scores of 15-9,
15-17, 18-17. Wendy Kemp '99 and
Becky Fischer '97, playing at second
doubles, finished offtheir opponents
at 15-9, 15-10.
On Tuesday, Harcum College met
Swarthmore in Tarble Pavilionfor an
action-packed evening of flying birdies and drop shots. Swarthmore
snatched up the victory, with both
doubles teams sweeping their
matches. The first doubles team of
Kemp and Fischer won at 15-3,15-5.
Herrin Hopper '9B and Jennifer Klein
'°B. the second doubles team, also
posted a huge win with scores of 152, 15-1. Doan had the only singles
win of the night with a resounding
victory at 11-1, 11-0.
Last night, in a home game, the
team was unable to avenge their previous loss against perennial rivals
Bryn Mawr, as the Mawrtyrs swept
the Swatties by capturing all three
singles matches and both doubles
matches. After reclaiming their first
seed by defeating Doan and Chomat
in practice, the first doubles team of

ErikaJohansen '99 and JenniferChen
99 dropped easily to theirBryn Mawr
counterparts (15-2, 15-2).
Chen said after the game, "Bryn
Mawr is always an emotional and
psychological game. HoweverJ let
Erika down. She worked so hard and
I threw the game away. I might as
well as have played for the Bryn
Mawr team."
The second doubles team, Doan
and Chomat, provided the excitement
for the evening as they challenged
every point their opponents scored.
After losing the first match at 17-18,
the pair came back to claim a tough
victory at 18-14. In the end though,
the two succumbed in the third game
by losing 9-15.

The final score was 54-68.

the only two losses of the season
coming against a polished Bryn Mawr
squad. "Bryn Mawr is a disciplined
team: thev out-plaved ns in every

Swarthmore team lost two key players to injuries, which added to the

were treated to an
emotional victory.
By

This week the men's basketball
team knocked off two more opponents to bring their current winning
streak to five games. The Garnet's

playoff hopes, which were in doubt
two weeks ago, when the team was 1
3 in the conference.
Swarthmore (11-8,5-3) pulled out
victories over both Gettysburg and
Haverford despite struggling with its
shooting from the field in both games.
The team was limited to just a 35
percent success rate against the Bullets and a 33 percent rate against the
Fords.
At the same time, the Garnet defense rose to the challenge and limited its opponents to below a 40
percent shooting as well. Despite poor
shooting, Swarthmore pulled out victories because its players cut back on
their turnovers, made their free
throws, and ultimately dominated the
boards.
Against the Bullets, the team hit 19
of their 23 free throw attempts while
limiting Gettysburg to just 11 trips to
the charity stripe. However, perhaps
even more instrumental in the team's
74-60 win was its tremendous 52-32

This past weekend, Swat's Track
Field Harriers rose to high levels of
competitive fury at the Franklin &
Marshall meet, where all the characters from around the conference came
out to show what they were made of.
This was undoubtedly the most involved meet yet for the Swat Team
this year, and they answered the situation with more spirit and ferociousness than ever. Danielle Wall had a
vivid impression of the experience:
"Have you ever seen a wild, ravenous
pack of emus charging across the
Australian Outback? Well, neither
have I, but this image filled my mind
when I looked around at the team.
We were wild...we were crazy. The
meet was our tea party and, baby, we
ate some serious cake!" Heroic and
unprecedented performances, combined with "GO SWATS" coming
out of every corner of the facility,
helped Swarthmore make a heavy
impression on the Centennial Conference.
Much speed and endurance was
exhibited in the many running events.
In the 55m hurdles, an event requiring both raw speed and finely-developed technique, Mason Tootell '99
placed sixth overall, crossing the line

rebounding advantage. Center Aaron
Bond '97 had a monster night against
the Bullets including 15 points, 14
rebounds, and two blocked shots. Cocaptain Ben Schall '97 also notched a
double-double, his fifth of the season, with 15 points and 11 rebounds.
Co-captain Colin Convey '97 led the
team with 16 points and added three
assists and a steal in directing the
attack.
Against the Fords, Swarthmore
harassed their youngeropponents into
a miserable 33% shooting. However,
the Garnet's starting guards and forwards, Convey, Tim Schofield '99,
A.J. Shanley '97, and Schall shot a
combined nine for 36.from the floor,
only a 25% mark. Bond was the only
starter who seemed to be in rhythm.
He snatched 13 rebounds on top of
ten points for his second double-

double of the week and fourth of the
season. He also added a season-high
three blocked shots.
Swarthmore got steady performances from the bench, which has
proven to be a steadier contributor
than was expected at the fvpinnino nf
the season. Sixth man J.J. Purdy '99
had a very strong night. 110 hit four cf
hisfive shots for eight points, grabbed
three rebounds, and tallied two assists and a steal without making a
turnover.

Fellow reserve Cassidy Westbrook
'OO scored five points, and grabbed a
rebound and a steal in only nine minutes of time. Mike Schall '99 hit a
three-pointer, nabbed two rebounds
and a steal in ten minutes.
While the two victories last week
were over teams that have been struggling all year, the Garnet can use the

confidence from those wins to propel
themselves through the final stretch
of the season.
Saturday, Swarthmore faces
Ursinus in a rematch of the January
18 contest, when the Golden Bears
walked away with a 55-51 victory.
The contest will be played at a neutral
site, the Palestra at the University of
Pennsylvania. Free tickets are available for the game and the subsequent
UPenn-Dartmouth contest in the athletic office.
The Garnet also gets a second
chance at knocking off Washington,
which handed them a heartbreaking
59-58 loss earlier this season. While
both gameswould be important wins,
the game against Washington could
be a battle for first place in the East
Division, a position the Shoremen do
not want to give up.

Swimming

Stephanie Herring, from the frozen tundras of Alaska, won the high jump
& Marshall meet this past Saturday. All the teams
of the
Centennial Conference were present at this meet. It was Stephanie's first
time high jumping in a meet since junior high. A regular sprinter and
hurdler, she surprised the whole conference with her performance and win
at the high jump.

MarkFriedberg, known for his humility,accomplished what no Swattie
swimmer had been able to this past Saturday. He was a triple winner over
conference champion Gettysburg, where he surpassed the field in the
1000,4001 M and 500 freestyle events, which Coach Susan Davis called
the "hardest." In this competition, Mark set the season's best times and
was only seconds off his own college records.

Last Saturday, the Centennial
Conference's two undefeated swim
teams came together in a dual meet at
Ware Pool. Gettysburg swimmers
took good advantage of the chance to
swim their Conference rivals, trying
out strategies and turning in many
well swum races.
Two of
Gettysburg's men lost races for the
first time this season, withSwat forcing them to swim their hardest. Captain Kristen Robertson '9B said of the
meet "I just think that was the best
meet we've had; we all cheered and
came together when it counted—we
came out on top anyway! In fact,
yesterday, when someone asked me
what the result was, I told them we
won by accident because it just felt
like we did." The cheering was multileveled—from the swimmers on deck
and the fans from both teams in the
bleachers above—and the excitement
was only heightened as race after
race came down to the last length of
the pool.
Topping the list of athletes with
great performances was Mark
Friedberg '9B, three-time winner in
the 1000 free, 400IM, and 500 free,
an amazing feat against a team such
as Gettysburg. Friedburg not only
earned himself some great times, but
praise from teammates and coaches
as well. "Mark was the biggest man
there," says Robertson, and coach
Sue Davis was so impressed that she
promised him a kiss.
But Friedberg's weren't the only
good races by far. Closely following
him in the 1000 came Chris Seaman
'99 and Gerry Kaufman '99, each
posting personal best times. Seaman
amazed spectators with a swift finish, passing a Gettysburg swimmer
in the final 100 yards and proving
that he can in factfinish arace as hard
as he takes it out. Kaufman had a
good meet all around, hanging as
tough as he does in workouts. The
400 IM was another event that turned

out well for Swat's men, Keith Early
'99 taking second just behind
Friedberg
On the women's side, ClaireArbour
'OO swam three very fast races in
spite of an upset stomach. Arbour
went a phenomenal 54.3 second 100
free off the medley relay and then got
back in the water just minutes later to
swim the 1000 in a swift 11:07. She
finished up her meet with a good
swim in the 500.
ErinFulkerson '99 and Kim Killeen
'97 each swam good races in the 200
breaststroke, posting good in-season
times. Molly Marino '97 also had a
good performance in the 200 IM,
posting a 2:19.
Men' s stroke events also went well.
Brandon Walsh 'OO swam his season
best time (1:59) in the 200 butterfly,
winning the event over the Conference record holder. Andy Robbins
'9B won the 200 backstroke by a
handtouch, and Tarek Radwan '99
swam a season best time in the 200
breast. Also in the 200 breast, Tyler
Stevenson '99 swam his lifetime best
time. Eric Haeker also swam a lifetime best in the 200 fly.
Finishing off the meet were both
the men's and women's 400freestyle
relays. Swat's top teams on each side
dropped four seconds from their
times, forcing their opponents to race
hard. Notable swimmers in these relays were Ryan Fruh '99, anchoring
for the men, and Cathy Polinsky '99,
who split her lifetime best 100 free in
a mere 56.8 seconds.
All in all, the team had a meet to be
proud of. After listing off five or six
teammates she was proud of, Jenny
Harvey '99 finished her praise with
the words "and Bull [Tsong Lin 'oo]
finished the meet [in the relay] despite goggles in his mouth—that
epitomizes how tough we were that
day." Happy with the way they swam,
Swat's swimmers moved on to the
final weeks of practice, resting and
honing their skills for the final event
of the year.

After an impressive three-game
winning streak, the Swarthmore
women's basketball team has lost its
last three games and is struggling to
earn a spot in the playoffs. Swarthmore lost to Widener University last
Thursday night, to Franklin and
Marshall College on Saturday, and to
Haverford College this past Wednesday. With theirrecord currently at 611 and only six more games to go, the
Garnet, currently in third place in the
Eastern Division of the Centennial
Conference, needs to pull together
and finish the season strong.
The Swarthmore women's basketball team fell to Widener on January
30, with a 73-62 score. The Garnet
started out the gamestrong and disciplined, but went into the locker room
at halftime with a one point deficit.
They outshot Widener 48 percent to
28 percent in the first half, but had
taken only 27 shots compared to
Widener's 42. In the second half the
Garnet again shot better from the
field than did their opponent, converting on 54% of their two-point
shot attempts. But the Swarthmore
women came up short in their effort
to take control of the game. With 20
turnovers and only 34 rebounds, they
failed to take care of the ball and

dominate the boards. In the last few
minutes their intensity picked up but
they were unable to seize the victory.
Lisl Cochran-Bond '97 had a
double-double,
and
was
Swarthmore's high-scorer and
rebounder, with 19 points and 12
rebounds. Pia Houseal '97 contributed 15 points from her position as
center and forward Jean Quinn '99
added 8. Holly Barton '99 was also a
key player in this contest, adding
seven points and five assists.
On Saturday, February 2, the Swarthmore women's team lost to Franklin
and Marshall, 75-44. The first half
proved to be a nightmare for the Garnet. They shot 16 percent from the
floor and scored only 12 points in this
period. Swat came out focused and
intense in the second half. In a valiant effort to overcome their huge
deficit, they scored 32 points in the
second half, but this wasn't enough
to gain the victory. Out-rebounded
51-31 and with 18 turnovers, they
could not gain enough momentum to
realize their goal.
Houseal put up 14 points on the
scoreboard and had 7 rebounds.
Cochran-Bond added 12 points and
Michelle Walsh '9B chipped in six
points and six rebounds.
