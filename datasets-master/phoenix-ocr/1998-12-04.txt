how much they would need.
At the meeting, Bess listed
the party's expenses, which included $llOO for aQIO2 DJ
and $lOOO for decorations.
Bess said that all the expenses
were verified according to the
Student Activities Fund rules
in effect at the time. "Every receipt they turned in was legitimate," said Bess.
According to SBC officials, the SAC directors did
not have a second BC employee countersign one of the
checks for the party before
cashing it.
Stefan said BC checks are
designed to require two signatures. Skiadas cashed a check
with only Bess's signature,
even though Bess said he told
the directors to have one of the
two SBC assistant treasurers
sign the checks as well. PNC
Bank accepted the check.
Skiadas told SC the error
was his fault and he did not
know he needed two signatures on SBC checks.
Stefan said that the SAC
directors once turned in receipts three or four weeks late.
"You know the two-week
rule," he told them.
"It's a learning process for
us, too," said Bell. "Most of
the things you're talking about
are one instance and one instance only. I don't want you
to get the impression that this
is habitual."
Jared Solomon 'Ol also
questioned Skiadas and Bell
about the Welcome Back

added Skiadas.
Before responding to
questions, Bell said it would

their specific concerns. "What

he asked.
Solomon responded, "Student Council [members], like
all other students, have concerns about how their money
is being spent." Solomon said
that SC wanted to hold the
meeting "just to clear the air."

BC revamps SAF rules
by Nick Attanasio
Editor-in-Chief

SBC and the treasurers of student groups. This new rule requires treasurers to contact SBC
before fall break. The committee feels thatright now, SBC and
student treasurers do not communicate enough and in the case
of many groups, SBC doesn't
even know who the treasurers
are. "We just want some sort of
contact," said Bess.
Some students expressed
concern over the rule change.
One former SBC member said,
"I just don't think [the rule
change] is feasible," citing the
increased workload for student
treasurers. SBC member Ford
O'Connell 'OO responded, "If
you get a 1300 on your SAT,
you'd think you could send an
e-mail [to SBC]."
Some of the other revisions
made by the SBC require student
groups to submit any contracts to
the Budget Committee before a
SAF-funded event happens in order for the receipt for that event
to be accepted. In addition, these
events must be well-publicized
with "at least five signs in each of
Parrish, Sharpies, and Tarble
which have been posted two days
prior to the event," according to
the revised rules.
Another revision is to the
rule requiring BC to obtain SC
approval for all expenditures
over $2,000. Under the new
rules, SC approval is required
only above $2,500.
Overall, Student Council's
opinion of the rule changes
seem positive. "These changes
are excellent," said former BC
member Chris Sajdera 'Ol.
For a more detailed account
of the revisions, see the sidebar

Last night, the Student
Council approved a series of
changes made by the Student
Budget Committee (SBC) to the
rules governing how student
money is spent. These regulations control the Student Activities Fund (SAF), that portion of
each student's tuition that goes
to student activities.
Budget Committee's revision of these rules affects every
club, publication, support
group, and other student body
which gets funding from the
SBC.
An informational meeting
was held to explain these changes
on Tuesday night in Parrish
Parlours, though fewer than 10
students attended. In response to
the low turnout, Josh Bess 'OO,
SBC treasurer, said, "I'm extremely disappointed, and for all
ofthe complaining that I have had
to listen t0... for people to not take
the chance [to learn about these
rules] is just blatant neglect of
their responsibilities as citizens
and students of this campus."
Bess went on to add that "a lot
work went into this and I feel that
people need to pay attention, especially if they're going to complain."
Many of the rules were
changed simply because they
were obsolete or not enforced
by the Budget Committee. SBC
member Jared Solomon 'Ol said
that many of these rules are "actually useless and... serve no
purpose."
One of the revisions which
prompted some debate dealt
with the relationship between on page 7.

Swat Community Donates to Giving Tree
by David King
Writer At Large
The best portion of a
good man's life is his little,

nameless, unremembered
acts of kindness and love."William Wordsworth
For members of the
Swarthmore community
caught up in the spirit of the
holiday season, the above
words should not seem all
that unfamiliar. They can be
found on little slips of paper,
adorned with glitter and festive pictures, which hang
from the branches of five socalled "Giving Trees" placed
throughout the campus.
These curious little trees
which stand about four
feet tall and bear artificial
pine needles
sprung up
shortly before Thanksgiving
break. According to Karen
Mazza, Co-Chair of the Giving Tree project, the tree
project came to fruition
about four years ago, as a
way to help needy organizations during the holiday season.
The premise behind the
trees— located in Ben West,
Parrish, Kohlberg, and
Tarble— is simple: passersby are encouraged to pick up
one or more of the tags suspended from the branches.
Instructions on the card ask

the bearer to purchase the
item listed, wrap it, and return it to the bookstore. To
ensure a variety of gifts,
each tag specifies the gender
and age range to which a
present should be targeted.
On December 11th, the
accumulated gifts will be
picked up from the bookstore and delivered to the
Big Brother/Big Sister and
Swarthmore
Coalition
groups.
We've heard from these
groups in past years that
Swarthmore's contributions
have provided much happiness for youths in the area,"
said Mazza. "The generosity of the Swarthmore Col-

lege community has always
been a wonderful outpouring
of sharing and there's hope
that the same will hold true
for this holiday season."
At noon on Thursday,
about 40 wrapped presents
sat on the designated table in
the
bookstore.
Linda
McDougall, a Co-Chair of
the Giving Tree project, said
she hoped for 150 presents.
"The amount of gifts received has dwindled some
over the past few years," said
McDougall. For that reason,
she explained, the presents
this year will go only to the
two organizations, whereas
in the past, they had been
distributed among as many

as five.

Ethan Devine '99 has
been a supporter of the tree.
Devine said he made a trip
to Target before Thanksgiving break, and wound up purchasing five gifts at once.
"I think people maybe
forget how fun it is to buy
toys," he said. "If you go to
Target, there are so many fun
things for $10."
Devine took all the ornaments from the Parrish tree
before shopping and bought
several things he said he
wanted as a child (and still
would want today), including a $lO volcano set and a
$l2 sled. He expressed excitement at finding a wide

variety of inexpensive, nonviolent toys from which to
choose.
Luis Quinones 'OO felt
strongly about the philosophy behind the Giving Tree.
"I think it is a good expression of the inner archetypal
goodness in people's hearts,"
he said. But, he thought the
sentiment "should be expressed more often and with
more dedication."
Those who would like to
support the Giving Tree, but
don't have time to shop, can
leave a monetary donation
with Theresa Handley or
Carol Forsythe, in Pearson

ends next Friday.

The Friday before Thanksgiving, 36 Swarthmore students
headed to Fort Benning, a US
military base outside Columbus,
Georgia. There they joined 7,000
protestors for two days of vigils,
networking, and civil disobedience in an annual effort to shut
down the School of the Americas, located at Fort Benning. The
School of the Americas is a government-funded program located
in Panama until the 1980s. Its
stated purpose is to bring trainees from assorted Latin American
countries together for military
training and lessons in democracy. Critics of the School, however, including SoA Watch
founder Father Roy Bourgeois,
say that torture has been advocated by instructors and point to
the involvement ofSoA graduates
in many crimes against humanity in Latin America.
Because the Swat Coalition
was not chartered (members are
currently working on a charter)
funds could not be requested directly from the Budget Committee. Instead, fundraising chair
Lindsey Newbold 'O2 led a drive
asking for money from various
other campus organizations. In
addition to the money this raised,
ten campus groups ranging from
HOLA to College Democrats
united with the Coalition. Each
group requested that Budget
Committee grant its conference
money for the semester to sponsor two representatives of their
organization for the trip. Using
the initial donations to pay for the
non-sponsored students, organizers were able to grant a full scholarship to each participant.
The final count of students
that left Swarthmore for the
weekend was 36. Because Fort
Benning is so far from Swarthmore, the Coalition rented vans
from an outside company. Each
of the three vans drove all night,
and while two arrived without incident, one van met with unexpected trouble.
The second van got lost after
exiting the interstate near Fort
Benning. Unknowingly the students drove onto the base, and
after driving in circles for a short
while they decided to stop and
switch drivers. While they were
stopped, they hung anti-SoA
signs on the sides of the van, unaware that they were violating a
federal law against engaging in
political speech on a military
base. They were stopped by military police, who arrested the students and issued them ban-andbar letters, effectively excluding
them from the grounds of Fort
Benning for five years. After two
hours in custody they were released and were able to meet the
other two vans at the vigil.
Saturday's vigil stretched
from mid-moming to late afternoon. At the main microphone
musicians alternated with political activists, persons affected by
the actions of SoA graduates in
Latin America, and street theater
performers. Singer Amy Ray of
the Indigo Girls, the sole "celebrity speaker," kept a low profile.
She sang three songs and gave a
brief speech in the middle of the
day. "Well, if democracy means
oppression,racism, homophobia,
and sexism, then I guess our
military's the right people to be
teaching it," Ray said. The vigil
ended with a drum ceremony by
a delegation from the Lakota Nation.
The Swarthmore students
then broke into three groups. One
returned to the motel, another
went to a student networking
event and the last went to a nonviolence/civil-disobedience

mechanism to gauge student
opinion also figures as a factor. The proliferation of college committees belies the actual state of administration relations. "Getting involved" is
the prerogative of those few
"activists" on campus, many
think. Student representative
positions on the various committees are advertised for, and
people run, but before you
know it it's all over. A sustained dialogue between the
administration and the student
body simply does not exist.
And Student Council, the body
that is supposed to act as a medium between the student
community and the administration, as not served the community as effectively as it is

As a member of Housing Committee, I would like to write
and clear up potential confusion over both the current and the
new room choosing systems ("New housing lottery system
agreed upon," 11/20/98). Room choosing is admittedly a rather
complex process here at Swat, and especially with two different
systems in operation, it's understandable that people may be
confused over which system applies to them.
Under the current system, rising sophomores are assigned
randomly-generated lottery numbers, which they use to pick
available rooms in campus housing. Prospective roommates
choose doubles (or triples or quads) on the better of their numbers. When no more rooms are available, remaining sophomores
are put on a waiting list; almost all of these sophomores receive
either campus rooms that become available after the lottery or
overflow housing in Strath Haven. The rising sophomores who
choose the last third of the available rooms (including those on
ihe waiting list) are guaranteed to get numbers in the top 2/3 of
their class the following April; this is referred to as lottery
insurance. Senior year, lottery insurance no longer operates, and
the class is once again assigned random room-choosing numbers.
This system, however, often means that some students get
poor to mediocre housing three years in a row. A student who
chose at the bottom of her class sophomore year might get a
number 2/3 of the way down in her junior class; with such a
number, this student might have a low chance of getting a single
and most likely would have little choice about what building that
single was in. Because there is no insurance senior year, this
student could then get a third poor number senior year and once
again have little choice about where she lived.

Under the new system, which will apply starting with the

numbers will continue to be randomly generated for rising
sophomores. After room choosing, 'cohorts' will be established ■

year, and numbers in the remaining third their senior year.
Every student will therefore have the chance to choose in the topthird at least once. Students who block may be able to get their desired housing multiple times, and no one will be forced to
choose poor or mediocre housing three years in a row.
Within Housing Committee, there was considerable discussion about this change of policy, but overall we agreed that this
change would be for the best.

SASS states postion on Unity Party fight
To the Editor:

I am writing in response to the November 20th letter to the
editor from Andy Wong 'O2 discussing the actions of "a promi- -;
nent member of SASS" at the Unity Jam held in Upper Tarble
all campus space on Saturday, November 14th. I do not defend
or justify this "promient member"'s actions; instead I am voicing
concerns for Mr. Wong's use of SASS as an organization to
mask his distaste of a particular individual choice of action. Mr.
Wong's insistence upon presenting this event as being perpetrated by a "prominent member of SASS" as opposed to simply
implicating the student directly, unfairly communicates to the
student body that this action was at the responsiblity of SASS. I j
would like to clarify that the statements which this member of
SASS made at the Unity Jam in no way represents the beliefs of ;5
the organization or its members. SASS helps to advance the
concerns of the black community in an effort to diminish racial ; j
hostility, not to perpetuate it. Second, I would like to remind Mr. |J
Wong and the Swarthmore Community that actions of this
individual are truly individual acts. It is important to remember
that ideologically, blacks are not a monolith and as with any
other ethnic group, we are a diverse group of people with a
broad range of beliefs and opinions. While lam aware that this ; I
individual is an executive board member of SASS, her statements were made in a completely unofficial and therefore
personal capacity. Finally, this statement is in no way a rebuke
of this "prominent member of SASS;" SASS will not seperate
itself from this individual. Rather we are fundamentally separated from this individual's action at that particular moment.
It is my hope that this letter clarifies any misunderstandings ;•
Mr. Wong or any members of the Swarthmore Community may ];
have with respect to SASS and its involvement in this college
community. If you have any questions or comments about
SASS, please feel free to contact me and I would be more than
willing to talk.

School vouchers provide better education

Princeton.
No, I am not here to write a
diatribe about the horrors of
public schooling in this country. In fact, education as a whole
really does not interest me that
much.
Vouchers, however, do. The
fact that vouchers provide a better education to all students for
less money is merely an added
bonus to the fact that they embody a sense of individuality
that government has stolen from
society.
Let me'lay out the basic
voucher concept first. Although
there are several voucher programs in various states, they
have several aspects in common. The idea is that the government gives
a

public school
education that
they can use to
send
their
child to any
school, public
or private. If
parents feel that private schools
offer their children a better education, they can send them to a
private school, and bad public
schools will be forced to reform
or to close.
To complicate matters, several restrictions have been
implemented in various states
limiting the families that can
receive vouchers, the amount of
money they get and the type of
school which they can send their
child, but the basic premise is
using tax dollars to pay for private schools.
The voucher idea started to
reform the public education system by privatizing it. The economic benefits of vouchers are
simple. According to Colorado
Free Market schools, "The average cost of a public school
education in 1996 was $6,576

per student per year. . . a good
private school education can be
found for $2,500."
Private school educations
are cheaper and better than public school educations. Private
schools provide a higher level
of education than public schools
because they compete in a free
market rather than being overly
restricted. Public schools are
run by the government and create incentives for efficient use
of resources in a bureaucracy is
difficult to impossible.
Colorado Free Market
schools cites, "Inflationary
school budget increase[d] 28%
from 1991-1996. The student
population... increased by 16%
during the same period. This
means that the cost is going up
faster than the demand."
Clearly public schools are
inefficient and, as a result, are
unnecessarily expensive. Private schools, on the other hand,
have to compete in a free
market, and if
they do not
produce qualeducaity
tions, parents
do not send
their children
there. There
really is no
contesting the
educational superiority of
vouchers.
If the government gives a
voucher for the cost of even half
of what a public school education costs to every student, each
and every student would be able
to go to a private school free of
cost. This seems to be the widest misconception about vouchers. They are not systems to
move the rich into private
schools and leave the poor in
private schools.
Vouchers maintain the idea
that every citizen is entitled to
a certain amount of education
and help ensure the education
is as good as possible. It is true
that vouchers would make it that
much easier for wealthy families to send their children to
more expensive private schools,
so in a way, vouchers would
contribute to the separation in
educations of the rich and the
poor.
Should the rich then be denied vouchers? Of course not.
Aside from the obvious discriminatory issue, it is not the
government's place to ensure
that all students receive the
same education, only that they
receive a certain level of education. If some families are able
to pay more money and receive
an better education, the government should help them rather
than hinder their efforts.
If not poor students, what
about problem students? Would
they not suffer from school
vouchers? Part of the success of
private schools is not only parents' ability to remove their children from schools, but schools'
ability to expel students that
cause problems.
Public schools are in some
manner made worse because

they have to keep problem students, and if vouchers were enacted, public schools would be
filled with problem students, destroying any chance of ever reforming the public school system. Yet problem students are
given the rights to the same education their harder working
counterparts are. What to do?
If you believe this doomsday prediction, all of the problem students will be isolated in
the same school and twice as
much money can be spent on
each one, because all the good
students have gone to private
schools for half as much. Everyone ends up with a better education.
Disagreeing with the equality of this statement assumes
that problem students need to be
integrated with good students in
order for the good students to
rub off on the problem students.
Students

I think a
more reason-

ing, study Columbus Day once
a year and might even learn to
respect different cultural
groups.
The public school is a
method ofinculcating similar social values in the country's youth.
If students are allowed to go to
private schools, they will be able
to go to schools that may not salute the flag, may not teach about
Christopher Columbus, may not
teach cultural acceptance and
may even teach about God. Of
course if students do not want to
learn about these topics they will
chose a different school, but the
questionremains: should students
beallowed to chose their owncurriculum?
What right does the government have-to say students cannot
learn? Government set up the
educational program in the first
place because society realizes that

They are not supposed to regulate knowledge within those

say regulating knowledge is illegal, but I really do not know.
Obviously this is due to the inferior education I received because my state did not have a

I'm not here to bore you, but

able outcome
would entail a
more equal distribution ot students among private and public
schools because, to my knowledge, misbehavior can be corrected in the classroom. I admit
that I do not know the correct
answer; however, even under
the most dire conditions, vouchers still provide superior educations.
Speaking of things I do not
know, I also do not know about
the constitutionality of spending
tax money on religious schools,
and I also do not think it matters. My reading on the separation of church and state is that
the government can pass laws
that pertain to religious groups
but not specific religious
groups.
Such an interpretation allows vouchers because they can
be used for all private schools
and do not discriminate regardless of the school's religious affiliation. Of course, the Supreme Court might disagree
with me, in which case vouchers would only be used for independent private schools.
More important, though, is
the tangential argument that a
school funded by the government should teach religious
principles or any non-mainstream principles. Here is where
the value judgment about
whether school should be used
as a method of mind control or
education and the beauty of
vouchers as a way of people asserting their individuality arises.
To some, the beauty of the
public school system is that it
teaches each student the same
curriculum. A high school
graduate that grew up in a ghetto
in New Jersey will read the
same books as another student
from the suburbs of Miami.

Whither the Simpsons?
I have no doubt that, despite
a recent and disturbing trend of
"Dawson's Creek" viewing, a
poll of Swarthmore students
would show overwhelmingly
that our favorite TV show is
"The Simpsons." The timing,
after all, has been perfect. We
were all on the verge of adolescence when the jaundiced, fourfingered family from Springfield took off like the score of a
Garnet Tide game, with the accompanying t-shirts and other
crap that made Matt Groening
rich and adults horrified at the
further dumbing-down of
American culture. Many of us
bought and wore "Don't have a
cow, man" t-shirts and watched
the show religiously. And we all
probably noticed as we entered
high school and began to find
things beyond fart jokes funny
that there is much more to the
Simpsons than pre-teen legend
Bart's antics—"The Simpsons"
is actually an incredibly intelligent, subtle show.
Although maturity played a
part in our generation's reverence for the David that took on
and overthrew the Goliath that
was "The Cosby Show" Thursdays at 8, it helped immensely
that "The Simpsons" matured
along with us. From 1992 to
1995, when most of us were in
the 13-18 range, the Simpsons
hit its stride with some of the
best episodes of any show ever
to be broadcast. "Mr. Plow,"
"Marge vs. The Monorail,"
"Homer Goes to College," "The
Be-Sharps," and "Bart vs. Australia" are just a few titles certain to go down as classics in the
annals of TV (and no, certain
snobs out there, "TV classic" is
not an oxymoron.) So the titles
don't jog your memory? How
about lines like, "Attempted
murder. Now honestly, what is
that? Do they give a Nobel prize
for attempted chemistry?"
(Sideshow Bob,) or THE classic Burns and Smithers exchange: "What do you think,
Smithers [about a woman joining the expedition]?" "I think
women and seamen don't mix."
"Yes, we know whatyou think."
Following the trajectory of
our lives (since Swatties are, after all, the center of the universe,) "The Simpsons" should
now be, or we should at least be
seeing "The Simpsons" as, a
show that continues to reward
you for education and maturity
with even more subtle satire that
we would not have understood
back in high school. A few years
ago, however, something went
seriously wrong. The trouble
started in season eight, the year
current seniors were freshmen.
Although there were still more
than a few solid episodes, derivative and bland shows like
"The Itchy and Scratch and
Poochie Show" and "Homer's
Enemy" popped up with more
and more frequency. That trend
continued until this year, when
most (although, I will grant, certainly not all,) Simpsons fans
have grown seriously disgruntled watching episode after
episode with nothing funnier
than Homer hitting his head and
yelling "D'oh!" a lot. The ratings are as high as ever—it is
ranked 20th out of all shows this
year—but true Simpsons aficionados (a category into which I
know many Swatties fall) will
tell you that something serious
is lacking in new episodes: a
subtle humor that, while filled
with obvious surface jokes, also

Outkast's "Aquemini" proves worthwhile
by Dave Roth
Staff Writer

In the last month there has
been a bumper crop ofmajor label hip-hop albums, which is not
necessarily a good thing. Unlike
big time hip-hop, underground
hip-hop offers the opportunity to
release three song singles or EPs
instead of compact discs. It
doesn't sound like much, but it
makes for less wack LPs to wade
through. The fact is that, regardless ofthe renaissance indicated
by the enormous sales of commercial hip-hop records, there
are simply not very many hiphop acts out there who have
what it takes, production-wise,
lyrically, or both, to pull off an
LP.
In the last year or so, I can
only think of two albums, major
label or independent, that deserved to be as long as they were.
As it turns out, both of these
(Rasco's "Time Waits For No
Man" and Hieroglyphics' "Third
Eye Vision") were released independently. This isn't to say
that major label hip-hop is universally over-inflated, but...
well, actually I would say that it
is. Even the most recent release
"Moment of Truth" by legendsin-their-own-time Gang Starr,
would be far tighter minus four
or five songs. The fact that seemingly anyone can release a
double-CD album (Really, now:
Eightball?) before they have released a good single-CD album
isn't helping things.
"Aquemini" the third album by Atlanta's Outkast, came
out back in October on the same
Tuesday as albums by A Tribe
Called Quest and Jay-Z, and the
debut from underground heroes
Black Star. While Jay-Z's album
is probably selling the most (not
that I am offering to explain this,
since I can't), Outkast has
emerged as the critical favorite
,

of the group, garnering a "five
mic" (essentially, five stars) review from hip-hop's "official"
magazine, "The Source"
(which, irrelevant as it may now
be, doesn't give those out that
often), and other glowing notices. I had never been a big
Outkast fan, despite some good
songs and a few crazy live performances I'd seen on TV
(they're brilliant live, and are
coming to the Electric Factory
this Saturday), but I finally gave
in and bought "Aquemini" last
week. While "Aquemini" is
clearly not a perfect record, I
consider myself converted and
convinced by it in a way that
neither of Outkast's previous
efforts,
1994's
"Southernplayalistic..." (the
real title of that album is almost
twice as long) or 1996's
"ATLiens" was able to do.
My previous resistance to
Outkast was not based on the
lyrical skills of MC's Dre
(Andre Benjamin) or Big Boi
(Antwan Patton). They're terrific lyricists who work together
very well together despite their
differing styles. As for those
styles: Big Boi is fan of the familiar Southern player/hustler
style ("Aquemini's" "Slump"
and "West Savannah" which
both fit into that category, are
Big Boi efforts sans Dre) and
Dre tends more towards things
sci-fi and fantastic ("ATLiens"
largely reflected his vision).
Both are intelligent and articulate, whatever they're rhyming
about, and address a wide range
of topics on "Aquemini" with
wit and surprising emotional
depth, from ghetto crime on the
brilliant and angry "Return of
the 'G'" to growing up in Atlanta
on
"SpottieOttieDopalicious." As
good as they were on their previous albums (and in cameos
such as the Goodie Mob's single

"Black Ice"), they are better
here.
The thing that sets
"Aquemini" apart from the
records that shared its release date
is actually the samething that ties
it in to its inferior predecessors:
its deep and unmistakable sense
of southern-ness. Hip-hop has
been tied in to either New York
or Los Angeles for so long that it
is refreshing anytime a group
comes out with a style that isn't
reminiscent of either locale's distinctive sound. This isn't to praise
the unfinished wackness ofNew
Orleans' No Limit Records
sound, but it is a relief, when listening to "Aquemini", to know
that it is not going to be a parade
of barely distinguishable spooky
piano loops or synth beats. Good
or bad, Outkast is never, ever, familiar.
Dre and Big Boi do some
distinguished production work
on this record themselves, as do
their longtime associates Organized Noize and David Sheats,
with all of them relying mainly
on live instrumentation to motivate their beats. Unexpected
production elements, such as the
harmonica break on the magnetic single "Rosa Parks" or the
70s-soul horns that grace the last
part of "Aquemini," keep the
record admirably diverse. By the
time you get to the album's second half, the fact that
"SpottieOttieDopalicious" is
basically a seven-minute hornflavored reggae/folk song or that
the incredible "Chonkyfire" is
built around synthesized strings,
electric guitar and live piano
won't even be surprising anymore. Even the best samplebased songs on "Aquemini" are
full of surprises: the righteously
indignant, ironic lyrics and
mournful beat on "Return ofthe
'G'" or the sheer propulsiveness
of "Skew it on the Bar-B," featuring a fired-up Raekwon of the

"Aroy": Confronting
Moon Ska's Independent's Day Tour
the world of Thai food showcases non-major label ska talent
by Rohan Hoole

Staff Writer

Being aforeigner in Thailand
means having a big, black X
painted on your front. As soon
as people know that you can eat
Thai food, many make it a challenge to see what exactly your
limit is. I am a stubborn fool, and
will eat anything on my plate,
even if it's just a matter of pride.
That just makes it more fun for
my Thai friends, who can sense
my discomfort at some of the
food put on my plate.
As we drove back from one
of our weekend retreats a few
weeks back, my boss Thorn decided that we were going to eat
in her village. As we neared her
house, she mentioned that we
were going to stop and buy some
"laap dip"; the response to her
comment was riotous laughter
from everyone in the vehicle .
Used to not understanding jokes
in Thai, I thought nothing of it,
until we sat down in Thorn's
house and the laap dip was revealed. Laap dip is beef. Raw
beef. With chicken intestine
mixed in.
So everyone turned to me,
and waited. I took the sticky
rice, rolled it in my palm, added
some beef, and popped it into
my mouth. Everyone waited for
me to swallow. Laap dip tastes
pretty much as I imagined it
would: like super spicy raw
beef. I defiantly raised one of
my eyebrows and proclaim
"aroy!" (tasty). Everyone broke
into cheers, and attention shifted
from me to the food as people
devour the various northern specialties laid in front of us.
The weekend after, I found
myself sitting on a straw mat, in
an open walled hut, preparing for
more Northern food. I can just
sense that my friend Tot is up to
no good, so I quickly skull another glass of Johnny Walker. I

have learned that if I'm drunk
enough, I can handle just about
anything. A few minutes later the
waitress brought two small jars to
the table. As I opened the lid of
the jar in front of me, and I was
dumbstruck by disbelief. Not only
were the tiny shrimp uncooked,
but the shrimp were also still alive
and jumping wildly. One shrimp
lept out of the jar and landed in
my lap, before flopping down to
the floor. Tot opened his jara little,
reached in with his chopsticks,
and popped one into his mouth.
"Aroy!"
Everyone was watching me
with big smiles spread across
their faces. Thankfully, from my
brief glance it looked like the
shrimp were swimming a pool
of lethal chilly sauce so hopefully I would not taste much. As
I slipped the poor shrimp into
my mouth, I felt it jump for a
second before I located it with
my teeth, and ended its misery.
My misery lasted pretty much
throughout the whole meal.
Last weekend, as we drove
to dinner at a friends house, my
friend Kaye dropped a plastic
bag on the seat next to me and
declared with a grin that it was
dinner. Peering cautiously inside
the plastic bag, I saw the corpse
of large, black, scaly, slimy,
snake. "Aroy" Kaye assured me.
"We're going to cook it before we eat it right?" I asked
t midly.
The question put my friends
into fits of laughter. When we
got to our hosts house, everyone
was amused with our choice of
meat. As my friends descaled,
skinned, and gutted the snake I
watched impassively. As the
Tom Yum Snake was brought to
the table an hour later, I still refused to respond. As everyone
watched, I popped a nice large
piece into my mouth.
I smiled, raised my eyebrows and declared, "Aroy!"

Tooth & Nail, the Christian
indie rock label out of Seattle that

and Starflyer 59, has put out three
pretty solid new CDs from the
bands Roadside Monument,
Selfminded, and Royal. The albums are all surprisingly dark,
heavy, and angry compared to the

ELECTIONS

6
Cathryn Polinsky
CPC (One semester)

In many ways the College Planning Committee (CPC) determines the future of the College. Student Council needs to expand its role
on this committee beyond addressing student
concerns in college proposals that are already
under consideration. As a member of CPC, I
would take a more active role in long-term planning by bringing
suggestions from the student body and Student Council to the committee. We need long-term planning efforts to address issues of
diversity at Swarthmore. Financial aid and student wage issues
need to be reviewed.
Maintaining the small class size of the student body would
also be a high priority for me. It is important that student concerns
such as these are not lost among the large-scale planning efforts
for the present fund-raising drive. As a current member of Student
Council, I will bring experience and enthusiasm to the table.
Imran Posner
CPC (One semester)

I feel that I could have a major influence on
the College Planning Committee. In terms of
the future facility plans, I have served as Facilities & Space Coordinator for almost two years;
I have also talked with the Vice President of Facilities about the different projects and plans for
the campus. I would bring a well-informed perspective about future building initiatives. It is evident from the Phoenix poll that
students want a new student center on campus and this is a project
that I would push for if elected.
Another topic that I am interested in is financial aid. The administration needs to change its policy on the rigid income lines
that it sets above which no financial aid is given. While I know
that Swarthmore does offer a lot of aid to students, a little more
money could be given to families on the border that have a tough
time paying tuition but receive no aid because they are just over
the maximum income line.
Another area of interest is the athletic facilities. While the
new Mullen Center is being built with indoor tennis courts and
nautilus equipment, I feel that the weight rooms at Swarthmore
are inadequate, especially free weights and other weight training
systems used by students and athletic teams.
Lastly, I feel that the food services can be improved. While
Sharpies has made some steps to improve food quality, budgetary
constraints always make it hard for major progress to occur. Therefore, the administration must substantially increase the budget allotted to the food services to help improve food quality and selection. I feel that my voice will be heard on the College Planning
Committee.
I have served on several committees and worked with the administration extensively in my past terms on Student Council. This
past experience will allow me to deal with the administration, to
get my point across, and to insure that the student's voice is heard.

Gabe Turzo
CPC (One semester)
If elected I would influence the College Planning Committee in two ways. First, I would pay
close attention to other students' opinions as to
what they feel needs to be changed on campus.
I would also increase my own acumen for problems, constantly looking out for any aspect of
student life in need of improvement. I feel that keeping my senses
attuned towards the possible shortcomings of the college and the
students' opinions regarding them is the best way to have a strong
impact on the College Planning Committee.

Will Ortman
CPC (One semester)

Kimberly Harris
CPC (One year)

In addition to the dedication and energy that
I would bring to the College Planning Committee, I would also introduce fresh ideas, especially
those that are most important to the student body.
I am hard working, have a good rapport with
many of the students, and am receptive to the
opinions of others. As a CPC representative, I would be a voice for
the community, and I would strive to keep the lines of communication open with students.
Nina Schichor
CPC (One year)
As College Planning Committee member of
Student Council, I will be sure that the students
are aware of what the faculty and administration is planning for our future and demand that
the Committee hear the voices of the students.
My plan is to gather ideas from the student body
and student council and present well articulated, thought-out proposals to the administration. For many years Swarthmore students
did not have representation on the planning committee, and I plan
to maximize our opportunity. I am an ambitious, straightforward
hard worker and want to get involved. I have experience in leadership and organizing. Recently, I helped lead the Swarthmore contingent of the Close the School of Americas protest in Georgia. I
will gather and present your opinions on important issues such as
how to incorporate a diversity of backgrounds, ideas and talents
into Swarthmore's curriculum and student life and how Swarthmore should encourage community outreach. If elected, I will insure that students are aware of administrative planning and that
the Planning Committee hears the opinions of the students.

Dave Thomas

Outreach Chair
For the Student Council to truly be an effective body, it needs the participation of as many*
people on campus as possible, in as many forms
as possible. To bring this about, I would try and
get more involved with the student body as a
whole, but not by those tedious mass e-mails, or
stupid signs hung everywhere. To be honest, though, I would probably still use e-mail to reach those not involved in any group, activities; Instead, I would try and get involved with students on a
more individual basis, by attending meetings, committee hearings,
or other large group gatherings. I would try and become more involved with groups on an individual basis, and hope that would
provide students with an outlet to the Student Council. If more
people can have their concerns addressed by the SC, it will make
the SC more representative of the campus as a whole, and therefore more effective. In short, I am particularly suited to be Outreach Chair because I have a natural propensity towards involvement with many diverse parts of the student body, i.e. I talk a lot, *■■
and have the resources necessary to increase student participation,
i.e. I have a lot of free time.

David Ellis
Outreach Chair

The student body needs to know exactly
what the student council is doing, and if the student body ever does not know, blame must lie
directly with the outreach chair. If elected, I vow
to take sole blame if there is ever a student who,;
for whatever reason, does not know exactly what
the student council is doing. To do anything less would be shirking my duty. If elected, I vow to constantly reshuffle the SC board,,
and to delegate Parrish board space more fairly. The electronic

an open suggestion box for spending ideas. The Treasurer should
be accountable to students for how money is spent, and communicating with students in the early and final parts of budgeting ensures both accountability and student involvement. I would encourage student-initiated ideas that benefit the student body; perhaps increasing council-sponsored all-campus study breaks, movies, and speakers. Student Council possesses a number ofresources
available to address student needs and interests. I would ensure
that those resources are properly allocated in order to best address
the needs of the student body. As a member of Council, I would
work to improve communication and foster coalition building be
tween on-campus groups and the Council. I think that Studen
Council has resources which could benefit student groups. I am
also interested in changing the advisor system. Improving the
quality of life for the Swarthmore student is of further interest to
me, perhaps by increasing Council sponsored social activities
Basically, however, I am running to implement your ideas, be
cause whenever I talk to students I am amazed by the innovation
they foresee. The administration already views Student Council a
an influential organization which represents the views and con
cerns of the student body at large. It is time for the student body to
use this resource to communicate student concerns, interests, an(
ideas.

OIL COMPANIES MERGE
The oil corporation Exxon confirmed its merger with Mobil Tuesday for more than 76 billion in stock.
This will form Exxon Mobil, the
worid's largest company, surpassing
GM, and the biggest corporate alliance in American history. The
merger reverses effects of the famous 1911 antitrust case against
John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil
Trust which generated the separate
companies. Lee R. Raymond,
Exxon's chief executive, emphasized that the merger was based on
efficiency not size: 'This is the case
ofthe whole being greater than the
sum of its parts." The deal will result in 9,000layoffs but is not likely
to have immediate effect on gas
prices.
GAY RIGHTS IN MIAMI
The Miami-Dade County
Commission voted to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation
Tuesday. This reversed the county's
repeal of antidiscrimination ordinances for homsexuals in the late
70s. The repeal had resulted from
Anita Bryant's heated "Save Our
Children From Homosexuals" crusade in 1977. Tuesday's amendment was seen as a vindication for
Miami's gays. Miami-Dade officials
expressed feelings that the vote
shows a changing national attitude
towards equal rights for homosexuals, especially in light of the Matthew Shepard murder.
BREAST IMPLANT UPDATE
Scientists concluded a 2-year
investigation Tuesday by releasing
a report to Federal courts. Their results deny evidence that silicone
breast implants cause disease or
immune system abnormalities.
The panel's four scientists gathered data through questioning scientists and investigating documents from womens' lawyers and
implant makers. Bristol-Meyers,
which has 6,000 cases pending in
this matter, called the report "very
strong." However, Sybil Goldrich,
a leader of an advocacy group for
women with implants, criticized
the panel for ignoring sealed individual medical records. This report is likely to have a detrimental effect on future suits by
women: it is available at

to the student body through communication. I will also work with
the diversity working group in expanding our function on campus
and pressing administration for student articulated changes. Currently I am working on a van that will transport students to the
movies and the mall each weekend. Most importantly I will function to address the needs of the students of Swarthmore.
The criteria that a new group must meet to obtain a charter are
delineated in the Constitution mat Student Council operates under. Personally, I feel as though if a group applying for a charter
has shown initiative and demonstrates a tangible benefit to the campus the organization warrants a charter. Charter Committee is presently discussing ourrelationship with Budget Committee and ways
in which we can define the relationship between the two committees better. We now operate as is stated in the Student Council
Constitution under the principle that newly chartered groups must
have a carefully and realistically allocated budget. My inclination
is that Charter Committee should play an advisory role in relation
to Budget Committee, merely suggesting budgetary constraints,
but not revamping the whole budget structure. This protects both
the autonomy of Budget Committee and Charter Committee, while
allowing the committees to communicate their concerns to one
another.

Model U.N.
Struggles

diversity affect not only the
student body, but the College
community at large, we have
associated ourselves together
in order to serve as a liaison
between the organizations we
represent, and the faculty,
staff, and administration ofthe
College, as well as to make
ourselves available to the College community as a resource
of student opinion.
With all these purposes in
mind, we, the members of
A.D.V.1.C.E., have associated
ourselves together in order to advocate for issues of diversity and
effect positive change in the institution ofSwarthmore College.

Oddly enough, at a college
where oratory clubs such as debate
prosper, and experienced delegates
from high school days abound,
Model United Nations remains
fairly small and inactive. While
other colleges such as UPenn and
UVA have high powered delegations attending conferences at least
monthly, Swarthmore attends a
mere one conference a year.
Trie main problem lies in the
exorbitant amount of money that
the conferencecharges each school
for the delegations it brings. At the
recent University of Pennsylvania
Model United Nations Conference
the weekend ofNovember 5-7, the
conference charged $2OOO per fifteen delegates,including food costs.
Thisfee was funded entirely by the
Budget Committee. "One concern
we have is that in order to participate in more conferences in thefuture, BC shouldn't be our only
source of funding," said club
founder and president Dennis
Cheng 'Ol. Cheng said the problem is that finding outside sources
or sponsors is very difficult, especially for a recendy established
team. Swarthrnore's team has no
alumni funding base or corporate
sponsor, as many Model U.N.
groups at othercolleges do.
Cheng and other Swat delegates hope to attend at least one
conference a semesterin thefuture.
The club plans to ask the Budget
Committee for additional funding
next semester to allow for more
conferences. As the club was
founded only two years ago, Cheng
believes the club needs to move in
small steps.
A typical Model United Nations conference take place over
three to four days. Students typically meet for around nine hours a
day in committee. Delegates represent nations from around the
world,makes speeches and writing
resolutions to solve international
problems. At the end, the chair of
the committee, who typically
comes fromthe college hosting the
conference, decides the winners.
Twelve Swarthmore delegates,
attended the UPenn Conference.
Cheng won an honorable mention,
and several others placed high in
competition. "We competed absolutely brilliantly, even receiving an
honorable mention in one of our
committees," said Cheng. "We all
had an extremely enjoyable and rewarding experience,and I look forward to returning next year with
more participants."

Teams should
share revenues
Steve Farneth

Staff Writer

It is becoming a bleary-eyed routine
depressing enough to erase all of my
vivid memories of the just past baseball
season. Soon after waking up, my roommate informs me that the New York stinking Mets have made Mike Piazza the
highest paid player in history orthat they
have signed Robin Ventura or that they
have signed Dennis Cook or that they
have traded for Bobby Bonilla or that
they have traded for Armando Benitez.
Meanwhile, my beloved and of late (the
last fifteen years that is) downtrodden
Philadelphia Phillies have made trading
for the middling and middle-aged outfielder Ron Gant their big off-season
move. The baseball renaissance could
only last so long.
I read an interesting article several
weeks ago which listed all of the top free
agents and predicted the teams they were
likely to sign with. It read as follows:
"Randy Johnson (P) likely to sign with
Astros, Braves, Yankees, Mets, Angels,
Diamondbacks, or Orioles. Bernie Williams (CF) likely to sign with Braves,
Yankees, Mets, Angels, Diamondbacks,
or Orioles. Mo Vaughn (lb) likely to sign
with Red Sox, Braves, Yankees, Mets,
Angels, Diamondbacks, or Orioles." Do
you notice a pattern? There were ten
players on the list and ESPN boldly predicted only the same five or six teams in
the running for each player.
Pundits have always said that the
game of baseball is stronger than the idiots who run it, and that it is too good to
be wrecked by its own executives. This
may be true, but I give these same executives a lot of credit for making the
game increasingly unrecognizable. This
offseason only reinforces what seems so
obvious: major league baseball is in desperate need of a revenue sharing plan.
The Yankees and otherrich teams ofthe
baseball world operate in a wholly different sphere from the straggling and
stumbling Philadelphias and Pittsburghs
of the world. This division has little to
do with the market size; Philadelphia is
the fourth largest market in the country,
yet they are incapable of doing what the
Yankees did in signing Bemie Williams.
Therich baseball teams are wealthy
because they are corporate owned, and
they have lucrative television contracts.
Most teams aren't so lucky. This developing class distinction within the game
is distressing for two reasons. The first
reason is that less successful teams are
holding their home cities hostage by demanding publicly funded stadiums complete with luxury boxes that can be contracted off to local corporations for high
fees. Just this week Pennsylvania denied
publicly funded stadiums to both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The Pirates, a
team with a beautiful history in Pittsburgh, responded by threatening to leave
Pittsburgh if there was no stadium deal
by the end of the year. Longtime fans
face losing a central part of their lives
for what amounts to welfare for the rich.
Even more problematic is the fact
that the rich/ poor distinction carries over
into winning and losing. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently published the following astounding statistic: in 1998, thirteen teams had a payroll of at least $4B
million, of which all but one finished
above .500. Among the other seventeen
teams, only two finished above .500. It
is all these fifteen can do to convince their
fans that they are competitive, let alone
championship caliber. Philadelphia's inability to keep up reached its nadir last
spring when they refused to sign draftee
J.D. Drew for an unheard of $l2 million
dollar contract. He went on to sign with
St. Louis. Since then, outrage has turned
to cynicism and the Phillies lack of a premier free agent signing is grumbled about
as typical of the organization.
However, this failure is less a
conscious decision than it is an incapacity. After all, who wouldn't want Randy
Johnson on theirpitching staff?The question is: who is capable offorking out $75
million over five years for a guy who is
already 35? The only way to level the
playing field and make baseball back into
America's favorite democracy is to devise a way of sharing the television and
luxury box revenue that separates rich
from poor. Maybe I underestimate the
greed of baseball's executives, or maybe
the idea is just too obvious. The people
running baseball are idiots afterall.
People complain that sports has turned
into business. True, but sports has always
been a business. It is, however, a selective
business, and the idiots running baseball are
most definitely not concerned with fixing
that which they destroy.

Women's basketball gets off to mixed start

December 4,1998

by Jean Quinn
Sports Editor
The women's basketball team
jumped with a hot start into the 199899 season, winning the inaugural
Swarthmore College Tip-Off Tournament with exciting victories over Eastern and Clarkson. In conference action though, the squad has been less
successful: the Garnet dropped its
opener against Johns Hopkins as well
as its next match to the Shorewomen
of Washington College in a heartwrenching one point overtime decision. The team has an opportunity to
reassert its talent and ability to dominate the competition this weekend as
the women participate in the Seven
Sisters Tournament at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. The squad
came out ready for action in the season opener against Eastern and dominated the entire game. The final score
was 62-53. Forward Heather Kile 'O2
led the way for the Garnet, posting 24
points and 17 rebounds in her first collegiate contest. Katie Tarr 'O2 added
12 points and pulled down 7 boards.
Point guard Kristen English 'Ol dished

out 5 assists as well as pouring in 11_
points of her own. Heather Marandola
'Ol added a career-best 7 assists and 7
points in the outing.
In the Championship, the Garnet
faced the Lady Golden Knights of
Clarkson, who had easily overpowered
the fourth school in the Tournament,
Elms, in the first round. Once again,
Swat led all the way and was victorious, 75-72. A balanced scoring attack
was central to the team's win: Kile
again led Swat with 20 points and 15
boards, English added 19 points,
Caitlin Ryland 'O2 had 18, and
Marandola chipped in 13. Kile earned
Tournament MVP honors and English
was selected to the All-Tournarnent
team to cap the celebration. Named the
Centennial Conference's Player of the
Week, Kile led the conference both in
scoring and rebounding in the first
week of the season.
Against Johns Hopkins, a school
that progressed far into last year's
NCAA tournament and was picked to
win the conference championship this
year in the pre-season coaches' poll,
the Garnet did not meet with similar
success. Although they only trailed 30-

Men's Bball starts season

Staff Writer
Before Thanksgiving break, the Garnet hosted the Equinox Classic. Swarthmore lost to Union 65-56, and to
Skidmore (who went on to win the tournament) 88-70. Tim Schofield made the
all tournament team by scoring 26 against
Skidmore and 18 points against Union.
Swarthmore won its first non-tournament
game of the season with a 62-59 win over
Gwynedd-Mercy. Senior guard Tim
Schofield scored 32 points, grabbed eight
rebounds and handed out four assists, as
the Garnet outscored the Griffins 17-6,
over the final six minutes for the win.
Senior forward Mike Schall grabbed six
rebounds and had a career-best six assists.
The Garnet then hosted Johns
Hopkins last Saturday. Swarthmore came
into the match with key factors in thenfavor. Tim Schofield was leading the
Centennial Conference in scoring with
25.3 points a game. Although Johns
Hopkins had a size advantage over the
Garnet, Swarthmore's defensive intensity
offered hope that the Blue Jays would not
dominate the offensive boards. Finally,
Swarthmore was undefeated in Tarble Pavilion against Johns Hopkins, having won
the only two games played there against
the Blue Jays. From the very beginning,
however, there was a sense that this game
was in the hands of the visitors.
In fact, the Garnet came out aggressive and stayed aggressive for the entire
game. Perhaps they are spoiling their fans
by doing so, but the hustle shown by the
Garnet for all forty minutes kept the game
in reach despite shooting a dismal 35.1 %
field goal percentage. The game started

The record of both swimming
teams has rocketed to 5-2 in last
week with wins against Drew, Washington & Lee and Widener but losing to Division I University of Pennsylvania. In a double dual meet
against Drew and Washington & Lee,
the Garnet excelled in almost every
event.
To begin the meet, the 400 Medley Relay of Becca Howes-Mischel
01, Jenny Harvey 99, Jill Belding 99
and Alice Bonarou 02 handily won
against both teams. The mens team
of Paul Dickson 00, Yasu Denda 02,
Brandon Walsh 00 and Ryan Fruh 99
also won, while the foursome of
Gabe Turzo 01, Fred Gerson 99,
Aymeric Pansu 01 and Josh Farber
02 placed second against Drew and
third to W&L.
On the women's side, Amy
Auerbach 02 and Mari McCrann 00
touched in first and second against
Drew. Unfortunately a speedy W&L
women snuck in before both of them,
so the Garnet took 2-3 against W&L.
Displaying her endurance, McCrann
then took second place in the 500
freestyle. Cathy Polinsky 99 finished
second in the 200 freestyle to W&L
and third to Drew. Again, proving
her sprinting ability, Claire Arbour
00 won the 50 freestyle against
W&L, while Drew snuck a swimmer
in before her. Arbour vindicated herself in the 100 freestyle by winning
against both teams.
The 200 Individual Medley continues to be strength for the women
with Bonarou and Harvey finishing
1-2. Polinsky and Belding continued
the trend and finished first and second in the 200 butterfly. Not to be
outdone, Auerbach and HowesMischel repeated the finishes in the
200 backstroke. Harvey and Melissa
Amir-Arjomand touched in first and
second against Washington and Lee,
but Drew grabbed both second and
third to Harvey. In the 200 butterfly,
JoDe Hendrick 00 achieved a personal best time, while Allison Lyons
02 swam well in the 200 breaststroke.
The women were victorious in the
400 Free Relay with Polinksy,
Auerbach, Bonarou and Arbour all
swimming strongly.
The men's meet was just as exciting as the women's with Chris Seaman 99 and Nik Johnson 01 demonstrating their endurance in the 1000
freestyle. They took second and
fourth to Drew and first and third to
W&L respectively. Keith Earley 99
and Ryan Muldowney 02 touched in
at first and third in the 200 freestyle.
Denda and Ted Sherer 01 swept Drew
in the 50 freestyle, while W&L's men
touched out our sprinters. In the 200
IM against Drew, Walsh and Seaman
placed 2-3 but only 3-4 against
W&L. Pansu and Tsong Lin 00
willed out the 200'butterfly finishing second and third to W&L and
third and fourth to Drew. Fruh and
Sherer sprinted to first and third
against Drew but were held to second and fourth by a strong W&L

points and ten rebounds a game. JJ Purdy
held Wertman to two points on two attempts in the first half. The Garnet also
forced eleven turnovers and claimed five
steals, three from Gregg Holtmeier.
The Blue Jayscame out strong in the
second half, going on a 6 point run after
a Schofield layup. However, four minutes into the second half two baskets by
Gregg Holtmeier and a Schofield steal
put the Garnet back in the game trailing
by six. Yet poor offensive execution and
forced shots hurt Swarthmore's chances
to close the gap. Johns Hopkins struck
back with crisp passes for easy layups
and a twelve point lead with a little more
than nine minutes in the game.
It was the good offensive execution
and superb play by Joe Culley and
Gammill that awakened the crowd and
gave the Garnet new life with 4:13 left
in the game. Yet after Gammill scored
to bring the score to 51 -56 a key steal
was ruled a foul, and Swarthmore was
held scoreless for the rest ofthe game.
Schofield was held to ten points under
his average while grabbing five boards
along with Culley to lead the team.
Both Culley and Gammill scored thirteen. Joel Wertman scored sixteen
points in the second half, and grabbed
eleven rebounds to lead the Blue Jays
in both catagories. The Garnet ended
up being out rebounded 39 27, yet
did grab 10 offensive rebounds to
Johns Hopkins' 8. The game concluded with Swarthmore down, 60 -51
to JHU.
Three years ago, Swarthmore defeated Division I Lafayatte, but this year
the Garnet remained respectable against
the formidable opponent, 75-56. Leading the Garnet was co-captain Schofield
with 16 points whileHoltmeier added 15.
The men have the weekend off and return to play on Tuesday hosting Franklin man.
Earley won the 200 backstroke in
and Marshall at 7:30 pm.

a come-from-behind race, while

Turzo grabbed second against Drew
and third to W&L. In the 500
freestyle Seaman was second again,
with Johnson pulling in a third; to
W&L and fourth to Drew. The 200
breaststroke was dominated by
Denda and Gerson with a 1-2 finish
to both teams. The men also won the
400 Free Relay with Earley, Fruh,
Walsh and Sherer sweeping both
teams. Gabe Rosenkoetter 02, Shari
Linden 99 and Lisa Ladewski 02
added depth to the Garnet's roster
which only helped against the deep
squads of Drew and W&L. This meet
was one where every place mattered
and the swimmers pulled together to
be victorious.
Right before Thanksgiving
break, both teams battled and won
against Widener University. Both
teams won the Medley Relay with
Earley, Denda, Walsh and Fruh on the
men's side and Howes-Mischel,
Harvey, Polinsky and Auerbach representing the women. Individual
winners were McCrann in 1000
freestyle and Harvey in the 200
freestyle. Auerbach touched in first
twice in the 200 IM and 100
freestyle. Polinsky won the 100 butterfly, Howes-Mischel the 100 backstroke and Amir-Arjomand the 100
breaststroke. Bonarou also finished
first in 500 freestyle. Sarah Marsh
00, Arbour, McCrann and Bonarou
finished up the meet winning the 200
freestyle relay for the women.
The men were just as successful
with Earley returning to form in the
distance winning both the 1000 and
500 freestyle. In back to back events,
Walsh won the 200 IM and the 200
butterfly. Seaman added another victory in the 200 backstroke. Widener
may have been able to win some
events, but the Garnet's depth proved
to be too much for the visiting squad.
Last year, UPenn's only win
came against the Garnet, so again the
swimmers would be hardpressed to
defeat their depth and strength.
Strong individual performers were
Auerbach winning the 200 backstroke and finishing second in the
200 freestyle. Another pair of seconds came from Belding in the 200
butterfly and Arbour in the 100
freestyle. Bonarou won the 200
breaststroke in National B cut time,
and made another B cut in the 100
butterfly while winning that event.
Polinsky added strength finishing
second in the 100 butterfly. The
men's strength continued to show in
the breaststroke events Denda and
Sherer placing 1-2 in the 200 and 13 in the 100. Walsh added another
second to the list in the 100 butterfly.
