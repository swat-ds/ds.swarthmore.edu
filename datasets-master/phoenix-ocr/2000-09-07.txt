As Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet
leaves for Stanford, The Phoenix looks
at her departure and the legacy she has
left behind. By Brendan Karen and
Mara Hvistendahl

Departure to Stanford
a 'personal' decision
BY BRENDAN KARCH

After four years as Swarthmore's
dean of admissions, Robin Mamlet has
resigned, accepting a similarposition as
the head ofStanford University's under-

graduate admissions.
JimBock '9O, currently director ofadmissions, will assume the title of Acting
Dean while the college searches for a permanent replacement.
Although Mamlet will not officially
leave Swarthmore until Nov. 1, she is on
maternity leave and, having just given
birth last Friday, will not return to work
before moving to Palo Alto, Calif.
Mamlet came to Swarthmore in 1996
after the death of her predecessor, Carl
Wartenburg, in August 1995. As dean,

she introducedthe slot system which
allows coaches of some varsity sports to
submit a list of applicants they would
like to see admitted
and she streamlined the process for reading applications.
Mamlet feels she made strides in
other areas as well, such as marketing
Swarthmore to prospective students.
"When I came
I wanted to make
Swarthmore's personality, values and
advantages more clear" to prospective
students, Mamlet said in an e-mail interview. "I believe this has happened."
One of her other goals was to allow
the campus a voice in admissions. She
noted that the Advisory Committee to
...

the Dean of Admissions has become an
integral part of the admissions process,
and its head, engineering professor
Lynne Molter '79, hasbecome a close colleague ofMamlet. Mamlet expects Molter
to remain a strong voice in admissions.

Students now also have a greater role
in the admissions process. Students take

part in group information sessions and
seniors conduct many of the interviews
with prospective students. Student tour
guides have grown in number, allowing
the office to conduct smaller tours.
"I think the greater student involve-

ment has helped families see better the
advantages of Swarthmore," Mamlet
said, "and it has also made those of us in

the admissions office more aware of what
it is like to be a student here, so that we
represent the college accurately."
With her list of accomplishments,
Mamlet views her four years at
Swarthmore in overwhelmingly positive
terms. "I've been really happy here under [President] Al [Bloom's] leadership,"
she said.
Her decision to end those years and
relocate across the country had little to
do with professional dissatisfaction, she
said, and much to do with personal direction. Stanford not only hired Mamlet,
but also her husband, Charlie Brown,
whose previous administrative post at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore

Diversity, slot system Mamlet's Swarthmore legacy
BY MARA HVISTENDAHL
When Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet departs later
this September for a position as Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid at Stanford University, she will leavebehind
an abundance of statistics illustrating her contributions to

Swarthmore.

In four years under Mamlet's leadership, the college's
yield
the percent of admitted students who attend increased from 35 percent to 40 percent, the admission rate
dropped from 31 percent to 23 percent, and the racial and
ethnic diversity rose from 35 percent to 46 percent.
The best testament to Mamlet's legacy, however, is the
1,519 students comprising the student body. Since 1996, when

she became admissions dean, the bulk ofher effortshas gone
toward making the student body what it is today. While emphasizing the continuity in the type of student that
Swarthmore has historically attracted, many administrators agree that the high levels of diversity, athletic talent
and m some cases
academic strength of today's student body
are due in no small part to Mamlet's efforts.
"In her time here, we have succeeded in bringing in the
most diverse classes in the college's history, and we've sustained that," said Vice President for College and Commu-

nity Relations Maurice Eldridge.
Eldridge conceded that increased diversity is the result
of a number of other factors, especially existing diversity,
but certainly Mamlet's efforts have also contributed to the
growth. According to Tracy Matthews 'B9, an associate dean
of admissions, Mamlet instituted the successfulfall Discovery Weekend, a program offered to 70 prospective students

of color each year.
One ofMamlet's greatest strengths as a dean is her "commitment to diversity in all respects," Matthews said.
The athletic coaches just might agree. At a Division 111
school that heavily emphasizes academics, it is difficult to
draw students with brawn as well as brains. Under Mamlet's
leadership, the admissionof talentedathletes has been made
smoother and more systematic.
Soon after becoming dean, Mamlet introduced the controversial slotting system, which allows athletic coaches to
recommend admission for a certain number ofathletes each
year.

While many students and administrators are opposed to
admission in any way based on athletic ability, Dean of Students Bob Gross pointed out that the slotting system has
simply brought order to a de facto system that was in place
before Mamlet became dean.

"There is a system of preferences that are given to certain characteristics," he said. "What [Mamlet] did was to
make it visible and rational."
Mamlet backed up this change in policy with personal
efforts to recognize the importance of athletics. According
to Associate Dean of Admissions Kennan Dick, Mamlet communicated directly with coaches rather than following previous deans' lead of delegating the work to an athletic liaison. "The coaches [had] a lot more access to the dean," he
said. "They were getting direct informationfrom [Mamlet]."
Athletic Director Bob Williams pointed out that Mamlet
could frequently be found at athletic contests. As a result of
the recent improvements in the recruiting program, he said,
"Our women's program is very well on its way to being the
competitive program it needs to be. Our men's program is
going to take some time."
Fortunately for the men's program, Swarthmore is now
in a position where it can better attract talented athletes.
"[Mamlet] placed Swarthmore more centrally in the public
mind as the institution that sets the standard for the finest

undergraduate education," President Al Bloom said.
"[Under Mamlet] there has been consistent growth in

Dorm storage ransacked during summer
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
When Christine Hancock 'O2
went to retrieve her belongings from
Wharton's storage

area after

returning to campus last Saturday,

she found several of her boxes

missing and the contents of others
strewn on the ground.
"They had been meticulously
picked through and no items of
resale value were left behind," she
said. Someonehad taken a graphing
calculator, a tent, bike tires and all
her bedding, according to Hancock.
"I was very upset. To see practically
everything I own trampled on the
floor was pretty depressing."

Several other students had their

belongings stolen from dorm storage
areas this summer, and one theft

involved a computer. Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave said
two or three of those studentsreported
the incidents to Public Safety.
The college assumes no
student
responsibility
for
belongings stored on campus over
the summer, although it does
provide a secure a storage area for
student belongings in Roberts.
There is a three-itemlimit for those
wishing to use the area.
Thefts from dorm storage areas
are a recurring problem but they have
beenminor in recent years, Redgrave
said. "The last few years we've had
very few reports of anything stolen,"
he said. "It used to be thefts were more
of problem. That's why we decided to
create Roberts."

While dorm storage areas are
often opened during the summer
for contractors and others
needing to do work on the
building, the Roberts area
remains locked. Redgrave said
thatthere has never been a report
of a theft from Roberts.
According to Hancock,
however, the Roberts storage area
provides insufficient space for
many students. Citing the high
cost of shipping the contents of a
dorm room to her home in
California for the summer,
Hancock said she would like to be
able to store more than three
items in a secure place on
campus. She added that Roberts
is only open for short periods of
time at the beginning and end of
the school year, making it
inconvenient for students to use.
To address her concerns,
Hancock and several other
students have arranged to meet
Friday with Dean of the College
Bob Gross. Hancock said she
hopes to discuss the possibility of
increasing the amount of secure
storage space available to
students.
Redgrave said that he was not
aware of any current plans to
increase secure storage space but
believes the problem will be
addressed, especially as more
buildings on campus are
renovated. "Space is a real issue
at this college, as I believe it is at
most colleges," he added.

Swarthmore falls to No. 2
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
Swarthmore fell to number two behind Amherst in
U.S. News and World Report's annual college rankings
this year in the latest tilt of the rankings teeter-totter.
The change has surprised very few; though it won the
number one spot in 1999 and 1997, the college also came
in second behind Amherst in 1998.
The frequent changes in ratings have, however, led
some to question their validity. The magazine has
sparked so much controversy withits quantitative approach to evaluating colleges that the magazine published a justification of the process on its Web site.
In that article, Nicholas Lemann points out the
schools are the ones who started to use numerical data
to make decisions regarding admissions, that colleges'
displeasure with being ranked comes from the undue
stress such publicity puts on the administration and
in general that rankings greatly benefit the students.
It seems that whatever benefits are to be had are
lost on Swarthmore students. At most, they are skeptical. At least, they think that no number could ever
capture the things that matter the most about college.
"I picked this place because of the academics and
the atmosphere," said Elizabeth Leininger 'O4.
Can these characteristicsbe measured? U.S. News has
been striving to do so for more than a decade. The breakdownof the criteria used has remained the same for the
last three years. In this configuration, academic reputation is the most important factor, accounting for 25 percent of the overall score. According to the magazine's
evaluation criteria, this factors plays an important role
in career and graduate school placement after college.
Graduation and retention rates, which allegedly
show how happy undergraduates are withtheir choice
of school, and faculty resources are allotted 20 percent of the total each. Other factors include student
selectivity, financial resources and alumni giving rate.
After the statisticians arrive at a weighed sum, the
schools are ranked. The number one school then gets
the perfect score of 100 in the overall category, and
4

the rest of the numbers are scaled to it.
The process attempts to encompass the majority
of the factors that add up to a good undergraduate education. Almost every year, though, the order of the
top schools in each category is toppled. Swarthmore's
rocky ride is not unique.
Published figures show that the data in each of the
categories has varied only by one or two percent from
year to year. What, then, is the reason for the seemingly annual change in the line-up?
One factor could be actual improvement of certain
schools. For example, according to Tracy Mathews 'B9,
associate deanofadmissions, this year Amherst completed
a capital campaign. This helped them edge past Centre
College, Kentucky for the No. 1 alumni giving rank.
It would seem that the change in the rankings reflects more so the schools' yearly progress than their
permanent status. In that case, however, the validity
ofthese articles to prospective students is questionable.
Another theory explaining the modification of the
order are the alterations in methodology. For example,
the category of the rankings issue that truly attracts
readers is the national univesities, in which the top
three spots have been inevitably occupied by Harvard,
Yale, Princeton throughout the majority of the years
the rankings have been in place. In 1999, however,
due to its added emphasis on the spending per student, California Institute of Technology took the gold.
This year, the magazine's statisticians explained
the upset, noting that their procedure for evaluating
spending per student had been flawed in its consideration of the entire student body graduate students
receive a disproportionate amount of the money.
CalTech thus returns to its former spot at numberfour.
Some may argue it was an honest mistake in the
magazine's constant search for perfection. Hilary Rice
'O2, however, seems to be of another opinion.
"I guess it's not exciting if the same school is number one each year. It's old news. It's more interesting
if you shuffle the colleges around."
After all, news magazines are rated too.

the college.

The three facilitators decided to take the
first step toward their ultimate goal by showing there to be genuine interest in the program
on the part of students and by giving credibility to the subject. To accomplish this, they put
together this semester's Introduction to Ethnic Studies course. As Li noted at the outset of
the first meeting, there is something to prove
to the administration in the running of the
course, and the future of the ethnic-studies
program may rest with the success of this first

Last Tuesday marked the inauguration of

Swarthmore's first Introduction to Ethnic
Studies course, a student-run initiative designed to commit the college to a multicultural

project. Gloria Chan 'O2, Adrian Daub 'O3 and
Duolan Li 'O3 will be student-facilitating the
course, which runs in seminar style from 6 to
9 p.m. on Tuesdays in Kohlberg 202.
Ethnic studies was originally born out of
the efforts of counterculture-era students who

were disillusioned with the consistent
marginalization of certain ethnic groups in
standard histories. The ethnic-studies project
came about so that the "untold stories" of nonmajority ethnic groups might be told and their

importance recognized.
Since its beginnings, ethnic studies has
become far larger in scope. It now encompasses
the analysis of inter-ethnic interaction at all
levels, from individuals to political institutions. In short, the discipline characterizes the
nature and ramifications of the intercourse of
one group of people with another.
The idea of bringing ethnic studies to the
college has been around for a number of years.

The ultimate aim of the ethnic studies proponents is the creationof a concentration for that
field.
The effort to realize this has not gone unopposed, though; in the view of the adminis-

step.

tration, the demands on both staff and funds
are weighty considerations. Those in opposition to the addition of the concentration to the
curriculumfeel that other disciplines cover the
aims of ethnic studies and there is no needfor

Several students, however, including Chan,

hosts the class, the group is adding more fiction to the reading list. Students are asked to

Science center
now projected

to cost $77M
Increase in building's size
major factor in higher cost
BY GERRIT HALL
The estimated cost of the
new science center has risen to
$77 million, up from the $7O
million estimated this spring.
During the summer,
architects met with the Science
Center Planning Committee and
representatives of the science
departments to finalize the
plans for every power outlet,
light switch, cabinet and other
details. When the architects, led
by primary design consultant
Einhorn Yaffee Prescott,
recalculated the cost, changes
to the plans pushed the price
above the original estimate.
According to Vice President
of Facilities Larry Schall, the
addition of more square feet of
space to the building accounted
for most of the increase rather
than unexpected construction
costs. However, the construction
costs are "on target," said
committee co-chair Rachel
Merz.
While the original
endowment contribution of $l2
million will be raised to $lB
million to cover most of the
additional expenses, the extra
size also requires that more
money be spent for
maintenance costs after the
building is finished.
But while the building price
has risen, Schall estimated the
architects saved $2 million
during the plan revision process
by remaining conscious of costs
while avoiding significant
compromises to the quality of
the building. By rearranging
rooms, they removed unneeded
staircases and decreased air
conditioning and wiring costs.

takes a lot of time to balance

Before then, the college

that this will be done sometime

which is expected to last three
years, can begin after that.
Schall said further changes

Mamlet's departure a 'personal' choice
From DEPARTURE, pg. 3
carried the toll of a long-distance relationship.
Then, the reality of long-distance marriage
turned into the prospect of long-distance parenting.
"We were both finding ourselves very concerned," Mamlet said, "about how Charlie could
play a meaningful role in raising his son."
Stanford actually came knocking on Mamlet's
door twice before, once three years ago and once at
the beginning of its search for a dean, but it was
not until they knocked a third time that Mamlet
considered applying.
"I decided to see where it would lead," she said,
adding that she was not actively seeking relocation
and had not applied for any other positions.
This is not the first time personal matters have
influenced Mamlet's career. After working at Occidental and Pomona Colleges and heading Sarah
Lawrence's admissions program, Mamlet said she
took the "mommy track" and went to
Lawrenceville, a preparatory school in New Jersey, where the perks included on-campus housing
...

and childcare.

Finding herself unhappy at Lawrenceville,
Mamletrelocated again, this time to Swarthmore.
According to Tracy Matthews 'B9, an associate
dean of admissions, Mamlet's decision to move on
yet again was not totally surprising. Admissions is
a field with high turnover, with many college graduates who work for a short time before choosing
graduate school or another profession.

"If a person stays for more than two years, we
are pleasantly surprised," Matthews said. But she
also noted that success in the field usually translates to longer tenures.
Matthews added, speaking of Mamlet, "I thought
she would be here a little longer."
Mamlet's departure leaves the admissions office
maintaining the status quo until the appointment
of a new dean. With the search committee still unformed, the process will likely run on until the end
of the school year.
Matthews, who was on the committee that hired
Mamlet in 1996, recalled the search as a drawn-out
process. "It took a long time," she said, stressing
the "o" in "long." And she expects that the upcoming search will "take a while" also.
As admissions waits until next year for a new
permanent leader, it also waits until the end of the
month for the return of its temporary head, Jim
Bock, who is on paternity leave.
His absence, combined with the recent turnover
of three admissions positions this summer, has left

a void in the admissions office. But according to
Matthews, that void is more at the top of the admissions ladder than at the bottom.
"We don't really feel shorthanded," she said.
"We're just missing a leader."
Mamlet sees the potential for worry in the wake
ofher departure. "I think that any time there is an
acting dean, people wonder whether current directions will be held to in the future," she said, "and so
there is some anxiety about what's to come."

both the quality of the applicants and
in our ability to yield them," Eldridge
added.
According to Mamlet, increased
yield was one of the changes she had
hoped to bring to Swarthmore.
"When I came I felt that too many
times Swat was perceived by admits
as a lesser choice than Williams and
Amherst, and certainly Harvard,"
Mamlet said in an e-mail. Since then,

the Sproul Observatory in early August. While the thefts date back to
May 1999, no tangible evidence has

The projector thefts, three of

Libertarians emerge on
campus as Third Wing
After a few years of dormancy, the Third Wing, a libertarian
political discussion group, has returned to add another ideological
outpost to Swarthmore's political landscape.
Recently the campus has been sprinkled with signs carrying the
words "fascism," "libertarian" and "mutant fungus" advertising
Third Wing, the new group. According to the group's leader,
Supreme Dictator Ben George 'O3, the signs are meant to convey
the sentiment of many libertarians that they are not adequately
represented or acknowledged in the U.S. political system.
Though now at the fringes of the political arena, libertarianism
has a more popular origin in the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson
that the federal government should be as small and powerless as
possible. Past libertarians also include Ayn Rand and Milton
Friedman.
Although Third Wing has only in the past few weeks been
actively promoted, it was founded several years ago by Amy Swift
'OO. Swift's orginal intention, which was to provide libertarian
students with an atmosphere in which to discuss their beliefs,
remains the aim of the group today. The publicity drive is meant
to attract new members and to advertise the group as one which
welcomes students of all political views.
The name "Third Wing" derives from the belief that the current
two-wing (left and right) dichotomy does not truly represent
American politics, which is too complex to be summarized in just
two terms. "Judging from the company to be found at various
points along this spectrum," said George, "[some of us] feel that
neither the 'right' nor the 'left' ideology represents our views, but
aren't at any point directly in between either."
While Third Wing is mainly a politically oriented group,
discussions may cover any topic, political or not. As long as the
group remains open to all students and a serves as fertile source
of discussion, George said, there are no plans to expand or
change it in the future.

Thrilling!
the

Mamlet's mark
There are other college officials who supposedly
have more power than the dean of admissions. They
are the ones who get to decide how much to spend on a
new science center or whether the college will boycott
South Carolina. While official pronouncements may
cause immediate and noticeable changes on campus,
the kinds of decisions made by a dean of admissions
are much more subtle and slow. But in the long run,
those kinds of decisions have more power to change
the school, because admissions decisions have the
power to change who the school serves and by extension, why it exists.
After four years as Swarthmore's dean of admissions, Robin Mamlet is leaving later in the fall to take a
position at Stanford. As the school enters its first, and
now last, year in which the entire student body was
admitted by an office led by her, her impact is not as
clear as it may have been when the higher classes had
been admitted by a different dean of admissions.
Changes she has made, often subtly and slowly, have
increased the diversity of the student body and the
number of student-athletes admitted. Even if her ideas
were reversed tomorrow, her legacy would still live on
in the four years of graduating classes now enrolled.
Now that Mamlet is departing, the college is faced
with the long and difficulttask of finding a replacement.
In the meantime, the admissions office will continue to
be adequately staffed and to carry out its operations.
Because productivity can be sustained even without a
dean, the admissions staff should continue its work in
the direction set by Mamlet. The college should make a
careful decision when choosing a replacement, since
the dean of admissions is so important in the school's
character. To Mamlet herself, we offer many thanks for
her service to the school and wish her luck in the future.

Storage space
lacks security
It's never hard to find the student storage room in a
dorm on campus. In almost all cases, it's the one in the
basement with the dim lighting, with tall metal shelving units dividing the room into narrow paths snaking
their way around like part of a maze. But what is really obvious is the floor. Or rather, the lack of a floor. It
is impossible to walk directly on it; instead, feet touch
squashed boxes, dirty clothes, books and whatever else
has spilled from above over the years. In other words,
dorm storage is an ideal physics demonstration ofchaos
or entropy.
Under those conditions, it is not surprising that
things turn up missing. If the incidents get reported to
public safety they are called thefts, but of course what
really happens is that periodically a black hole just
opens up for a microsecond and sucks in a few people's
most expensive belongings. In Roberts storage, where
students usually store belongings over the summer, the
college has a sophisticated high-tech black hole prevention system called tumbler locks.
Perhaps the college should consider providing additional long-term locked storage space so students can
store more belongings there, but in the meantime students have only themselves to blame for thefts from
dormitory storage. We, not the college, are collectively
responsible for security there. We decide whether to
prop open dormitory doors and let strangers in, and
we decide whether to leave valuables in insecure storage or to protect them better in Roberts.
The disgusting state of most dorm storage areas is a
good reflection of student interest in storage except

when those black holes show up every year. Ifwe want
to complain about the quality of dorm storage on campus, it behooves us to do some fall or spring cleaning
and do our part to improve the conditions.

Thoughts on the quest for self-fulfillment
BY MAUREEN VERNON

During last week's overwhelming
heat and humidity, sitting in Kohlberg
meant sitting in air-conditioning. That's
where I was when I overheard the following exchange between two recentlyarrived first-year students.

The first student asked, "What

classes are you taking?" (They were
right on schedule, I noticed: the firstyear topics of conversation had progressed from Phase A, inquiries into
place of origin, to Phase B, inquiries into

course selection.)
The second student, putting down his
pre-classes just-for-fun book, listed the
classes he'd chosen and of course returned the question, a customary step
in the New Student Conversation.
At this point the exchange took a
pseudo-intellectual turn for the worse. I
listened as the first Swattie described
her myriad Advanced Placement tests,
advanced standings, college courses
she'd already taken and so on, all of
which somehow combined to make it
nearly impossible for her to take any-

George Dubya and the Republicans
have opened the gates and set their attack
dogs loose. Gruesomely desperate for a
juicy chunk of Al Gore's not-quite-human
flesh, these bloodhounds began their vicious hunt in 17 tightly contested states
this past weekend though we will hear
about them around the country.
Those attack dogs, of course, are the

most recent Republican-funded campaign

If you haven't seen the latest Bush ad
yet, here's a synopsis: the 30-second spot
begins in an empty kitchen, with a television set left running in the corner of the
room a TV inside a TV, just to give us
some distance from whatever horrors are
about to appear on its screen. A clip of Al
Gore at a White House press conference
pops up first, and an unseen female nar-

rator snarls, "Oh, there's Al Gore ..."
"Reinventing himself on television
again," she continues. "Like I'm not going to notice. Who's he going to be today?
The Al Gore who raises money at a Buddhist temple? Or the one who promises
campaign finance reform?"
By this point the TV-inside-the-TV
we're all watching has gone a bit haywire
flipping rapidly from one embarrassing Gore moment to the next. First he is
seen sharing some sort ofritual with Buddhist monks several years ago, then at the

Democratic National Convention last
month asserting, "I will fight for you."
"Really," says the woman in the background. "Al Gore, claiming credit for
things he didn't even do." Next Gore is pictured delivering perhaps his most infamous quote, "I took the initiative in creating the Internet," and the narrator cuts
him off, exclaiming, "Yeah, and I invented
the remote control, too." Her voice drips

Bush attack ad?

"negative" ads about Bush's

with sarcasm.
"Another round of this, and I'll sell my television," she concludes.
That might not be a bad idea if this is the
sort of stuff we're going to be watching for the
next two months. Is it the first salvo in a
bloody war of negative advertising?
The Republicans say no. The Bush campaign says that Gore let loose with negative
attacks long ago, with his ads criticalofBush's
health care plan and his statement that when
it comes to providing details on his policy proposals, Bush should either "put up or shut up."
Besides, Bush's aides say, this ad is not "negait is "good-natured," "humortive" at all
ous" and "tongue-in-cheek."
I'm not sure anyone will buy either of those
explanations. The Bush campaign has tried
to blur the line between critical advertising
and character assassination. Candidates always promise not to "go negative," but politicians and pundits generally recognize the dif-

man for higher

ference between ads and statements which
criticize a candidate's record and policy position, albeit often deceptively, and those which
question a candidate's character or integrity.
The Gore campaign and its supporters
have released "negative" ads about Bush's
health plan, and Bush aides say they are
merely returning a punch with the credibility issue. But many people can probably recognize that a sarcastic monologue about Gore
"reinventing himself on television" is significantly different.
As for whether it is merely good-natured
chiding as the Bush campaign claims well,
a recent Newsweek poll had Bush trailing
Gore by as many as 10 points. I'll bet my estate tax relief that "good-natured" would not
describe the Bush team's sentiments this
week.
John McCain, Bush's vanquished rival for
the Republican presidential nomination, said
last fall that the Republican Party's challenge
in the 2000 election is to "join in the fight

Well, that unhappy-sounding woman complaining about Al Gore? She is that "pervasive cynicism" incarnate. She represents the

The rise in tuition is outpacing inflation, grants, loans, state appropriations
and other subsidiaries available to students. The same report counted 65 percent of Americans as listing the cost of
college as their most worrisome concern.
Cheney has consistently votedfor programs that would cut financial support
to students.
In 1981, Cheney voted for then-President Ronald Reagan's budget that slashed
student loans. In 1985, Cheney voted to
freeze funding for the higher-education
programs by giving his approval to the

The reality is that George W. Bush has betrayed the very campaign promise that legitimized his challenge to an establishment reto "change

cut non-student aid programs under the
Higher Education Act of 1965. Cheney

Leiberman's history with higher education programs has been the exact opposite of his opponent's.
"If the cost of college becomes a
luxury that an increasing percentage of
the population cannot afford, the economic divide between the haves and
have-nots could undercut the American
dream and stunt the nation's economic

Lieberman says he is also taking steps
to make sure that "the government is doing everything it can to ensure college
affordability." He co- sponsored an
amendment in the Higher Education Act
of 1998 that toughened teaching standards
and required schools to publicize the results ofhow they compare to those standards. The bill that was passed with the

Wednesday in quite a while that millions

watch the newest episode. It's kind of sad,

really.

For months, much of the American public had followed the saga, "leaving behind
their jobs, their loved ones and all contact
with civilization," to exist on that island
with those people and to share in their joy
and pain.
Yes, the "ultimate human experiment"
is finally over. The jury sounded off and
votedfor the "fat gay guy," Richard Hatch
(also dubbed "Machiabelly"), who drove
away in a new auto with a cool million.And
in the wake of this conclusion, a voyeuristic nation is left behind in the throws of
Survivor withdrawal.
Sort of.
After all, most of the castaways are being smothered by opportunities for public
appearances and commercial endorsements, with a seemingly countless number
of rumors and speculation abounding regarding "who" is doing "what" for "whom."
Here's just a small sample: A recent episode of VHl's The List featuring Gervase,
Colleen, Greg and Joel taking part in a
panel to decide the best "desert island al-

bums" ofall time, with fellow castaway Jenna
mediating the panel discussion and host Jeff
Probst appearing to read the final winners.
Richard, Gervase, Jenna and Sue are scheduled to appear on Hollywood Squares next
month. Ramona was a judge in last Friday's
Miss Teen USA Pageant, and runner-up Kelly
will guest-host an episode ofTalk Soup. Rumor
has it that Sue is negotiating some kind of an
endorsement with the World Wrestling Federation. And just when you think there couldn't
be a better castaway/commercial deal tag team,
it's reported that Rudy, the oldfart who "doesn't
know what MTV means," is being considered
to appear in a Bud Light commercial.
Such stretching of time, ofeach castaway's
"15 minutes of fame," will assure the continued presence of"Survivor" in public discourse,
which is, of course, a boon for host-network
CBS. What they might not have anticipated was
the immense cultural impact that "Survivor"
had on the nation. Legions offans dressed up
in tropical garb every Wednesday for "Survivor" parties. The show's interweaving, and often forced, plot lines became the primary topic
of conversation around the water coolers, coffee shops and break rooms of America. One
starving artist took enterprise and painted
"tribal art" depicting infamous scenes from the
show, selling the works on eßay (the best, perhaps, being "Rudy applies lotion to gay Rich,"
a tiny five-by-seven-inch painting that drew a
final bid of $530). And a one-man band, named
"Thirty-Nine Days," (the total time spent by
the castaway on the island) emerged, record-

ing ridiculous, though admittedly funny, songs

about "Survivor" episodes and posting them
on mp3.com-the band has made more than a
thousand dollars to date on four songs.
Which raises an essential question: Why?
What is it about stranding 16 strangers on a
desert island, watching them work simultaneously for and against one another and ultimately tearing each other to shreds that is so
entertaining?
Well, it probably has something to do with
conflict and the depressingly sad presence of
it in everyday life. Archetypal conflicts, the
same ones that lurk constantly here on the
mainland, emerged almost instantly on the island: old vs. young, men vs. women, corporate
vs. blue-collar, gay vs. straight, mental prowess vs. physical ability, your lifestyle vs. my
lifestyle, and so on.
In the end, the real struggle wasn't so much
surviving the unpredictable terrain of island
life. Rather, it was surviving the unpredictable
social climate thatexists among humanbeings
and is the product ofhuman nature —the very
same struggle that routinely aggrieves and
scourges just about everyone, every day. The
only difference is that their struggles took place
on national television, and boy did it reassure
millions ofAmericans every weekthathumans
will still be humans, even on a desert island.
After all, isn't it reassuring to know that,
even far-removedfrom civilization, people will
still hurt one another, will still connive and
deceive, all for the sake of greed? Apparently

years to $5,800 per year.

Shouldn't we put someone in office
that is as concerned about the cost ofcollege as we are? WithLieberman pushing
to pass bills thatmake college affordable,
he looks like the cheaper route to take.
If America can succeed at making
higher education more affordable, it just
might maintain global competitiveness,
what with so many more people able to
plan on a higher education.

Lesson No. 1:
Surviving Swarthmore
By Sonia Scherr

Emily

Thomforde 'O4 said she arrived at Swarthmore with no expectations
for what first-year orientation would be like. "I wanted to keep an open
mind," she explained.
But in an interview nearly a week after orientation began last Tuesday,
Thomforde had nothing but praise for the six-day program intended to introduce first-year students to Swarthmore before the start of classes and the arrival of returning students.
"I loved it," she said. "I'm so impressed with the students and people at
Swarthmore that I'm having a blast."
Thomforde said the chance to meet other students before the beginning of
classes helped her adjust to college life. "I think it was a good transitionfrom
going to school at home to going to school here because we were acclimated to
the social experience first," she said.
Her overwhelmingly positive response to orientation was typical of that
expressed by other first-year students interviewed Monday.
Most students said the orientation successfully addressed such practical
concerns as how to find their way around campus, how to plan their schedules, and what to expect from academic life. But they also said that orientation
provided an opportunity for them to interact with other first-year and
upperclass students, as well as to make friends.
"It was nice to have a couple days where the whole point was to introduce
yourself to as many people as possible," Lillie Dremeaux 'O4 said.
Matt Miller 'O4 cited a flag football session as the best example of the inter-

action that occurred between students. "None of us knew each other and yet
we were having fun together," Miller recalled.
Thebarefoot formal, whichtook place Thursday night outside the Mephistos
lounge, received rave reviews from Stefanie Fox 'O4 for similar reasons. "To
see people who a few days before were really nervous and to see those people
out there cutting loose was really great," she said.
The majority of first-year students said their 13-member campus adviser
groups, each led by two returning students, provided a helpful base during
their first few days at the college and introduced themto students they wouldn't
have met otherwise. But there were a few complaints about a lack ofcohesion
within individual groups and a surfeit of corny ice-breaking games.
In addition, many students said the speakers and planned discussions during orientation week helped familiarize them with the ideals of the college.

"Within the first week here we were talking about important issues." Fox
said. "Which is exciting because that's what the school's about."
For Evan Hensleigh 'O4, who hadn't visited Swarthmore prior to arriving for
orientation, the first collection in the amphitheater provided an introduction to
the college. "All the speeches gave me an idea of what I was in for," he said.
"It's as much as you want to make it be," Hensleigh said of the college. "If
you work at something you'll get it, though it won't be easy. Everything is still
open to you. It's very supportive but at the same time very challenging."

Other

students said orientation affirmed their choice of college, dispelling any qualms they might have had about coming to Swarthmore. "[Ori-

entation] confirmed everything I thought before, everything that made
[Swarthmore] my first choice," Sara Posey 'O4 said. "It's going to be hard, but I

wouldn't have chosen it if I wanted to be bored."
Several students also appreciated the kind of diversity they encountered at
the college. "In high school you had different groups of people but hardly any
interaction between them," Jake Beckman 'O4 said. "But that [interaction] is
something that's really prevalent here."
Amanda Cravens 'O4 commented on the expressive nature of Swarthmore
audiences, who she said tended to sing, clap, and yell during movies. "There
was a sense of community that was very impressive," she said.
Planned activities during orientation includedafternoon electives which
an evening casino party and 'Bos party, as well
ranged from sports to crafts
as presentations from administrators and faculty members.
According to the first-year students interviewed, the most difficult part of
orientation was adjusting to being away from home and having to meet new
people continually.
"The hardest thing was when there weren't planned activities," Beckman
said. "[You] came up here and started thinking. It got to you that you were
away from home."

Confronted with frequent meetings ranging from swim tests to placement
exams, as well as with a constant barrage of new faces, first-year students generally described orientation as overwhelming.
Nevertheless, most students felt that the hectic pace allowed them to become better acquainted with the college and their fellow students and prevented them from missing home excessively.

A college love affair
BY NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN

Don't make
the Sharples
people mad
That's right, O my brothers, it's time for the AnnualFresh-animate-matter advice column, wherein
I, who has hid from the rest of the campus with the
exception of the people in the fieldhouse, offer advice to people who will statistically never set foot
in the fieldhouse.
Nevertheless, by virtue of the undoubtedly masochistic following of this arrogant space-filler who
get me hired year after year, I present my half-serious advice.
Places not to go: the second floor of Cornell, unless you're a mute. They take their studying very
seriously, and they will kill you if you talk. I
coughed once and couldn't stop; I had to run before
the last engineering major still carrying a slide-rule
tried to disembowel me and figure out the cube root
of 29 at the same time. If it had been 27, I'd be a
dead man.
Places not to go, part II: Parrish Parlours after 7
p.m. It's not so much that you put your life at risk.
It's more that, if you're not careful, you'll suddenly
be a member of a group you've never heard of, likely
an officer of aforementioned group, and probably
required to go to a state or national capital and protest something you previously thought was a
Letterman punch line. And you thought Patty Hurst
had it bad.

I coughed once and couldn't stop; I
had to run before the last engineering
major still carrying a slide-rule tried
to disembowel me and figure out the
cube root of 29 at the same time. If it
had been 27, I'd be a dead man.
People not to anger: anyone in the registrar's office. You want AP credit? You think you're going to
drop a class? Not if that cadre's pissed at you, you're
not. They can get you out of the Italian Army if they
want to (true story: I had a friend who almost had to
go to the Italian Army until the registrar at the University of Chicago sent the right form to the embassy), but if they don't, you will be, as was once so
colorfully said (guess the film paraphrase), be flying
dog filth out of Hong Kong (expletive deleted). They
got me out of a $lOOO-per-year fitness membership.
Tell them they look nice today.
People not to anger, part II: any members of the
Sharpies dining staff. You're already afraid to eat
the food; imagine what would happen if one of them
had a grudge against you. You can just walk in the
kitchen. It's not as if there's security. Don't make
them mad. Sharpies and I once had a misunderstanding, but it's all taken care of now.
Things you should do: annoy your roommate(s).
What's the worst that can happen? If they hate you,
they'll move, and you'll receive that most-hallowed
"unliveable." It almost sounds
of designations
like a compliment, doesn't it?

"How's your roommate?"
"He's unliveable!"
"Yeah, he is pretty cool."
Things you should do, part II: beat Haverford in
every possible way. I have a younger brother there
as a freshmen this year, and if any, and I'm looking
at you, men's soccer, teams lose, I will, and I say
that with all the force of my 5'6" frame, cry like a
scared, frightened, little girl.

SEPTEMBER 07, 2000

THE PHOENIX

A long, long time ago in the midst of

a previous life called high school, I saw
Swarthmore College for the first time. It
was the middle of the summer; I was
planning visits to perhaps a dozen liberal arts colleges, including two in Massachusetts. I live close enough to
Swarthmore that, what with the lateteenage hormonal need to move out, it
took much parental encouragement to
get me to think about Swat seriously.
When I eventually drove down, it was a
blind date, but I fell in love. I spent the
rest of the summer visiting schools but
my heart stayed monogamous. I was an
early decision that fall.
Because I've been so in love with
Swarthmore ever since, I've never ever
thought about whether therewould be a
school better matched for me. The corollary is that because Swat is like a familiar girlfriend whose flaws I know
well and have learned to live with, I'd
never bothered to see ifother places are
more perfect.
That is, I didn't until this summer,
when my younger brother started the big
college dating game. My parents went
alone with him on most of the trips, but
as a male bonding kind of thing I went
with him to two campuses. Both are liberal arts colleges, but I will withhold
their names to protect the innocent. We
visited College A during the morning
and by the time we took the tour at College B in the afternoon the tour guides
had mentioned a half dozen things as
commonplace and completely ordinary
on their campuses that certainly aren't
ordinary here.
When I was doing my own college
visits three years ago, all the tours and
hype blended together and I came home
with only a general impression of what
college life was like. I didn't remember
stuff like how late the dining hall was
open at one school compared to another,
and didn'treally care thatmuch anyway.
Now, being in college myself, it is much
easier for me to judge what of other
schools' admissions propaganda is just
that and what is truly unique to a particular school. That is exactly what I was

doing on the tour at College B, where as
we were walking through the buildings:
I was furtively scribbling notes for an
Op-Ed on the subject on the back of a
business cardfrom my wallet. Here they

are:

Student center. College A has a huge
new student center built in the past decade and expanded since I visited it three
years ago for my own college hunting. I
don'tmuch care for the "hip" neon signs
and the walls painted in saturated clashing primary colors, but the fact remains
that there are lots of lounges and meeting rooms for student groups. I can probably name the number of Swarthmore
student groups with their own offices on
the fingers of one hand. Even Student
Council does not have any kind of permanent office space, and I think the reason is that none exists, let alone in a contiguous space with lots ofother student

After a little fooling around
I’ve discovered a few
imperfections in the current
object of my affection.
groups. I think we could definitely use
a student center, although maybe on a
more modest scale.
Food. I didn’t taste the food at either College A or College B, so the quality of the dishes is not what I mean.
But College B’s dining options are
much better than ours. You can choose
which meal plan to be on, and unlike
at Swarthmore where all the meal
plans cost the same amount, if you buy
fewer meals you pay less. College B’s
main dining hall has an open-door
policy that truly is continuously opendoor you can go in and out as many
times as you want in a day in addition
to going at whatever hours you choose.
Finally, there are student-run snack
places open until late at night, where
you can actually use meal credit after

9:30 p.m.

Real entertainment. I want to know
what our tour guides say about big
names on campus. Well-known speak-

ers are one thing, but well-known musicians are another.
Getting Dar Williams last year was
the coolest thing in recent Swarthmore
memory, but in one academic year other
schools our size sometimes get several
performers even more widely recognized. How come we don't?
Studying services. And finally, I consider Swarthmore much less of a party
school than either College A or College
B, so one wouldthink we wouldhave topof-the-line resources for facilitating academics, right? Wrong. College B has two
lounges on each floor in most of its
dorms. One is the "social" lounge, and
the other, behind relatively soundproof
glass, is the "study" lounge. And in the
library is a 24-hour reading room. The
library itself is closed for some of the
night, but the reading room has a separate entrance and you can study there
as long as you want.
After the tour was over and I had
filled the back of the business card with
those ideas of things other schools have
that I would appreciate here, I did some
more thinking during the long drive
home with my brother. One thing I've
thought of is I should not suggest that
other schools are universally better than
Swarthmore in their provision of student services. Swarthmore may be the
only college on the planet that provides
one phone per person, not one phone per
room. And then there's the matter of all
the weekend entertainment being free,
which is not true of many other campuses.

Still, the visits to College A and College B a month ago have confirmed my
belief that students at other schools live

better in several ways. Whether you
think it means Swarthmore is reluctant
to spend money on students or whether
it just means academic priorities at
Swarthmore are rightly taking precedence, I think it is significant that we
are differentfrom other schools. For me,
after a little fooling around I've discovered a few imperfections in the current
object of my affection. I will live with
them in the meantime, but because I'm
still in love with this college, hope to fix
them someday.

People need to manage work rage
STAFF EDITORIAL: DAILY TARGUM (RUTGERS U.)
(U-WIRE) NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. Going postal apparently ain't all it's cracked up to be.
A recent study conducted by the United States Postal Service Commission on a Safe and Secure Workplace revealed
that "Postal employees are no more likely to physically assault, sexually harass or verbally abuse their co-workers than
(are) employees in the national workforce."
But while the mailman may not be more likely to lose it
thanthe milkman, a Gallup Poll released last week shows that
many Americans work in fear of violence at the office.
The poll shows that as much as 10 percent of the American
workforce, or 13 million people, fear that a co-worker of theirs
will become violent.And while the media's hype of work and
school-related tragedies contributes to a general aura of fear
throughout the public sector, there are a number of legitimate
reasons for workers to be looking over their shoulders at the
-

office.
First, more than 75 percent of Americans are unsatisfied
with their careers. Workers logging a multitude of hours in
jobs that they don't want to be doing in the first place can
generate a negative attitude throughout the workspace.
Also, 75 percent of American workers believe they recognize signs of potentially dangerous behavior, but that their

companies ignore them.

The bottom line is that every individual deals with jobrelated stress differently. No policy can prevent violence in
the workplace. When companies require employees use their
allotted vacation time, they help to alleviate the build-up of
stress in employees who are logging as many hours as possible to help theirfinancial situation. By "forcing" these workers to take a break, companies can take a small step toward
creating a calmer work environment.

Workers logging a multitude of hours
in jobs that they don't want to be doing
in the first place can generate a negative
attitude throughout the workspace.
Still, the only way to combat violence in the workplace is
through awareness at the most microscopic of levels. Individual bosses must be conscious of the state of minds of all
their charges. Every person deals with stress differently. Every employee has a different threshold for the amount of
hassles they can deal with before reaching the boiling point

whether in the board room or the mail room.

Why Swarthmore's more like CBS's
"Survivor" than we'd care to believe,
and other scary thoughts.
By Christine Smallwood

Survivor"

was small enough to begin
with —just an idea, really. A bunch
of people would be "stranded" on a
deserted island, voting each other
off in a Darwinian ploy to discover who
could last the longest out there in the wilderness. They'd have nothing but the camera crews and that vaguely creepy tribal
council host leader guy to keep them company. Oh, and sometimes they'd get beer, too.
It first aired in Holland, and it's been the
most successful Dutch export sincethat miniature windmill craze of'92. A disturbing ratings grab, playing on our collective obsession with the random and personal confessions of strangers? Oh, you silly critics, taking yourselves and the fate of culture all seriously and stuff.
But don't worry. I'm not going to analyze
the psychological motivations and implications of the "Survivor" phenonemon. No important conclusions, no prophetic visions of
doom. That's been done, and overdone, by
everyone from Bryant Gumbel to Geraldo
Rivera.
But I digress. For like in Holland, there
are Dutch people at Swarthmore. Granted,
not as many, but Holland is a small country. And like on "Survivor," there is a
group plopped down here, almost randomly, and asked to team up, bear the humidity and eat a lot of rice. There are over
1000 of us out there, wandering the campus, eyeing each other suspiciously, smelling kind of funny.
So what does all of this mean? How is
Swarthmore connected to the idea of "Survivor"? Well, no one's going to ask us to eat
dead rodents, unless SWIL gets really creative this year. And when we graduate, the
reward won't be a million dollars and a gasguzzling sport utility vehicle, but rather a

piece of paper, a pat on the back and the
privilege of being $120,000 in debt.
But before leaving, there's orientation to
endure. We are split, not into competing tribes,
but into arbitrary CA groups that foster a
weird sort of fleeting communion under the
eager supervision of terrifyingly friendly upperclassmen. You know, the officious council
leader guy/gal, the Campus Advisor.
And there does seem to be an awfullot of

discussion about Swarthmore's national

ranking

during those

"Welcome to

Swarthmore" speeches. But hell, we're a
business, too. U.S News is watching, right?
So what if we create the news that sells? Titillation —be it Colleen and Greg's torridlove
affair or the hygiene habits of the girl down
the hall—just sort of disseminates. Confessions to an empty camera lens seem to make
so much sense when the fake torches are
blazing. Only later, showing up in Sharpies
on Sunday morning in Saturday night's
clothes, do we wish we could take everything
back faster than you can say voyeurism. And
sometimes we get beer, too.
So maybe Swarthmore is more like "Survivor" than previously thought. Winning
our immunity challenges, blabbing the dirt
on our friends when the camera's on, paddling our way to the top like Richard Hatch,
all for the flakes floating at the top of the
college fishbowl. Some will leave
Swarthmore embarrassingly bitter, some
ecstatic, and all bound for the talk-show circuit, justifying theirpast choicesand future
plans to family and friends.
And how fast can you say voyeurism?
Faster than you can say "Holland"? Faster
than you can say "Swattie"? Faster than you
can say "naked people do wonders for ratings, even if they're ugly"? Faster than you
can say "the end"?

MOK REVIEV

Lyrical 'Day' captures
Renaissance characters
By Catherine Osborne
Sixteenth-century Italy is commonly celebrated for its dramatic cultural and social revolutions. For the lucky and adventurous, "the world was expanding, a continent each decade."
But these innovations were balanced by the terrifying flux of
war and plague: the less fortunate "could wake up sick in the
morning and by nightfall be dead." The widely disparate inhabitants of this world are united in Adria Bernardi's new novel
by their struggles to respond to a society in upheaval.
Bernardi, an Italian
author living in Massachusetts, won the

tains, each seeking his

own kind of salvation

through his art. The
story is bookended by a
brilliantly lyrical account of the desperately poor shepherd
Bartolomeo de Bartolai, who waits patiently to be discovered by
an artist perhaps thefamous Giotto will someday pass through
his village? and brought down from themountains into a life of
fame. In the end, he discovers that the pilgrimage most important to him is not one he will make away from his mountain, but
-

-

into it: he leaves his home for a hidden cave and transforms
years ofdreams into walls ofsparkling mosaics.
Bernardi is at her best in the sections involving Bartolomeo;

she discovers an unearthly beauty in the exhausting, diseaseridden existence of his village. Bartolomeo, making his mosaic, "paints a naked man, whose arms are outstretched and
legs parted. Blackened spheres are painted symmetrically on
the man's body [in] places where the bubos of plague will appear. Each nodule is connected to another by an arching line.
The nodule on the neck is connected to the outer part of his
hand, the earlobe to the thigh. These connecting threads make
it seem that the man has wings." The powerful image of the
plague-stricken angel is couched in language typical of
Bernardi: deceptively simple, densely poetic.

Although Bartolomeo remains permanently tied to his
mountain, for better and for worse, his childhood friend Martin de Martinelli "had always been preparing to leave." The
contrast goes further: Bartolomeo is silent, withdrawn, and lives
a rich inner life, while Martin, having left the village and become an itinerant artisan, battles loneliness withincessant talk,
a ruinous fondness for gambling, and pride in his craftsmanship. Martin's wholerestless life, with its frequent debt-driven
flights to new Italian cities, is effectively juxtaposed with
Bartolomeo's patience and stolidity. By turning most of Martin's
sections intoextended monologues, Bernardi conveys the emptiness at his core. Bartolomeo says of him that "Martin de
Martinelli is the earth and everyone else is a planet circling";
but matter can revolve around a black hole, and Martin is little

more than the image he projects to his listeners. At the same
time, we are brought to sympathize with this complex creature's
frantic need to do to travel, to see the world and make his
mark in order to prove that he exists.
Bernardi's third story line revolves around the great painter
Titian, his children and his servants. The chapters dealing with
the decline ofthe historical Venetian family are by far the least
successful in the book. Dealing withreal people, instead ofcharacters that are at leasthalf archetype, Bernardibecomes caught
up in historical detail and loses much of the emotional depth
that the interweaving ofMartin's and Bartolomeo's stories provides. The first chapter ofthe book (a section from Bartolomeo's
point of view) was originally published as a separate short story.
Bernardi would have done better simply to expand on the
themes and characters she had already introduced, without
complicating the story line by the addition ofTitian's life.
Although her evocation ofhistorical people is far less successful than the exploration of her own original characters,
ultimately Bernardi shapes the pieces ofall these lives, fictional
and not, into a literary mosaic which resembles the result of
her main character's artwork. Speaking ofoutside news rising
to Bartolomeo's isolated village, Bernardi points out that "we
hear it in fragments, we hear it in imperfect remnants." Just
so, only shattered pieces of the story, many only accidentally
preserved, have reached us from Bartolomeo's time. The construction of something beautiful and whole from the shards of
glass and pottery which Bartolomeo collects, and Bernardi's
own transformationof the Italian Renaissance's historical remains into this deeply felt novel, have much in common.

'Art of War' little more than trash
Nothing comes together in
the latest action flick from
Wesley Snipes, "The Art of
War." By Morghan Holt
Balls of color bolted across the
screen, blurring, then separating,
nearly throwing me into an epileptic seizure, but captivating me in
such a way that I couldn't take my
eyes off their bouncing brilliance,
even though my eyes were pounding

in the back of my head and my retinas were burning up. The introductory credits ended and the movie
began.
It went downhill from there. All
of it. Throughout the movie, my
mind wandered, yearning for the entertainment of the fast-paced rainbow. I shut my eyes and tried to recreate it, struggling to block out the
trash that was playing on the screen.
The trash that director Christian
Duguay has mistakenly called "art."
More precisely, 'The Art ofWar."
As I sat, straining to keep my eyes
open and my head from spontaneously bashing itself into the wall beside me, I realized that this movie is
by far the worst that I've seen in a
long while (and I've seen some bad
ones). It's not that I went with high
expectations, hoping for a masterpiece, a real work of art from Wesley
Snipes, but even his action scenes let
me down. This is, of course, not entirely his fault. If anything, the directing ruined the show. Good action
flicks don't necessarily need highcaliber dialogue or even a captivating story-line, but, for God's sake,
they've gotta have some action.
"The Art of War" fails on all
counts, perhaps as a result of trying
to do too much in too few minutes.
In its 120-minute running time, the
movie jumps from poorly-shot action
scenes to a potential romance between Snipes and an attractive Chinese translator that dies because the
screenwriter never follows through
with it, and finally to a completely
unrespectable attempt to establish a
meaningful, intense political plot.
Snipes' character works undercover as a spy and saboteur for the
United Nations. He takes ordersfrom
a stuffy, self-inflated woman, whose
character seems flaky and transparent until the plot takes a flying quan-

turn leap and proves her to be actually quite conniving and, well, evil.
Apparently, her task is to convince
China to reestablish a trade agreement with the United Nations and
open its doors to America. The Ca-

nadian government, which isbehind
the whole scheme, is determined to
set things in motion. And that's
where Shaw, Snipes' man, comes in.
His job is to prowl around, collecting information with various gadgets attached to various, unpredictable parts ofhis body, for the United
Nations.
It seems relatively simple, like
the whole deal should be perfectly
easy to understand. But it's not. At
all. In fact, none of it makes any
sense. I kept trying to figure out if

they'd purposely left out crucial elements (it's a foreign film, after all), or if

it was a mistake. The whole mess was
like a dot-to-dot that's missing a few
dots. It just didn't connect.
In all, "The Art of War" is a flop, a
directorial disaster, something to which
Wesley Snipes, the rest of the not-so-hot
cast, and Morgan Creek Productions
should be ashamed to be attached. The
plot fails because it's too complicated
and too simple at once, which stifles the
action, and destroys any chance of thrill
in the film. The dialogue destroys the
viewers' interest, oscillating from
single-syllable mindrot to obviously
forcedand phony eloquence. The movie
lacks explanation; it lacks pizzazz. "The

Art of War?" More like "The Art of
Poor."

soulless attempts at
making the rappers seem more "real" and more
marketable (they are signed under Cash Money
Records).
The only surprising aspect of this record is its
recurring theme of sobriety. The Big Tymers sing

worse, becoming "sellouts."

Bad Religion has been getting flak
from fans throughout the decade for
dropping its renowned indie label, Epitaph, in favor of Atlantic Records. The
group's most recent tour, supporting

their album "The New America," has
further alienated hardcore punk's notoriously purist fan base by seeing them
opening for Carson Daly-approved punk
antichrists Blink-182. The album itself,
however, reflects the key to the band's
staying power despite such hardships.
"The New America" showcases a Bad
Religion that is intelligent, passionate,
and stillknows how to rock.
And rock they do. There's a lot to like
about "The New America." This remains one of the few bands that can pull
offpunk thatis bothmelodic and devoid
of Green Day-style whininess. The album is, even more than previous Bad
Religion albums, jam-packed with vocal

about the destructive effects cocaine and heroin
have upon the user's mind and body and urge
avoidance of them. There is a 90-second rant
about the downward spiral of hard drug use
spoken by "The Big Chief" in which he
patronizingly taunts hedonistic addicts who want
to quit but can't because they "just like it."
What's interesting about this album is how
closely its messages resemble the values of middle
and upper class white America. Its themes of
greedy materialism, sobriety and the glory of
expensive living mirror white America's capitalistic
fascination with money, power, luxury automobiles
and big-screen TV sets. While it's unlikely you'll see
Joe Businessman rolling down Fig Leaf Lane
bumping the BigTymers in his Navigator, its
amusing to think that he very well could be. That is,
if the black gangsta' style didn'talienate his ears.
There is one song on this album that almost
makes it worth buying. The last track, entitled
"Snake," is a misogynistic song in which The Big
Tymers compare their genitalia to various breeds
of snake. This album is of value only as a source of
entertainment for the less discriminating listener.

gangsterism, a realm to which a large number of
rap artists seem to gravitate. The majority of the
tracks on this record involve repetitious descriptions
of the BigTymers' extensive automobile collections,
their expensive electronics, their diamond and
platinum jewelry and
all the "nasty bitches"
they sleep with and
then discard like fast
food litter on the

late-80s antics, which included supporting the Irish Republican Army and tearing up a picture of the pope on national
television, predated Tori Amos and Courtney Love by years.
An ordained cleric in a Christian sect as well as a member
of the lesbian community, O'Connor has not lost her knack
for keeping the contradictions flowing. Her newest album,
"Faith and Courage," is an extended and occupying musical
exploration ofher two favorite things: sex and God.
"I have a universe inside me," begins the very first song,
"The Healing Room." Twenty-first century Sinead is quite
comfortable with her identity, even if it doesn't make a
whole lot of sense to the outside world. O'Connor, much
like Tori Amos, is self-obsessed, possessing a kind of personal excess that can be alternately grating and beautiful,
often within a single song. Unlike Amos, however, she is
not particularly graceful with subtlety or metaphor, tal-

O'Connor takes her "contradictory" style to the next level.
Electronic percussion and production cameos by Wyclef
Jeanand Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs lend further freshness
to O'Connor's sound. Thankfully, this time around, her
sense of experimentalism leads to nothing as ill-conceived
as her semi-legendary rap about the Irish potato famine.
And some strange musical touches, like the last track, in
which hip-hop performed by Ghetto Priest and others is
blended over the traditional Irish "Kyrie Eleison," actually work better than one would expect.
In terms of lyrics, O'Connor can, and does from time to
time, sound like every female vocalist who followed her,
from Bjork to Suzanne Vega to Alanis Morissette. The end
effect is diverse and makes for a highly mixed album. In
her strongest moments, she takes on the best sense of her
own words, becoming the archetype of the "strong, independent, pagan woman singing." At her worst, she reflects
negative qualities of all that is new age and feminist. The
thing thattilts in her direction is that she is blunt about it.
"I'm Irish, I'm English, I'm Moslem, I'm Jewish/ I'm a girl,
I'm a boy/ and the goddess meant for me only joy," she sings
in "What Doesn't Belong to Me." Intentional or otherwise,
it would be harder to find a better expression of the contradictions inherent in this kind of philosophizing.

harmonies, which work nicely with the
band's trademark clean, yet loud, guitar sound. The musicianship is, as
usual, not exceptional, butremains competent punk rock fare.
Bad Religion's real strength is
Graffin, who remains one of the nerdiest
lyricists in his field, pushing his socially
aware, mature version ofrebellion with
lyrics that are well thought-out, intelligent and endearingly naive. Only rarely
is he preachy enough to be annoying,
as in the title track, in which he proclaims "We don't have to be afraid to reinvent/ We've got to start to build,
progress and implement." But on the
best tracks, such as "It's a Long Way to
the Promise Land" and "A Streetkid
Named Desire," Graffincomes across as
a nice guy who genuinely cares about
bringing about change, which is enough
to sell just about anything, no matter
how trite. "I Love My Computer," an
anti-information age ballad, stands out
as one of the album's catchiest, making
use of the Apple Macintosh's speech capability for effects both chilling and
comic.
However, despite the album's many
concessions to the twenty-first century,
the main impression it leaves you with
is how little some things have changed.

The album's general feel is similar to
most of the rest of Bad Religion's work
over the last two decades. Sure, it's good,
but one can't help but ask the inevitable
question: "Do we really need more of
these?" And it's hard to say.
The fact remains that "The New
America" is a quality piece of mature
punk rock, as well as much-needed evidence that the phrase "mature punk
rock" is not an oxymoron. Despite all appearances to the contrary, Bad Religion
has not "sold out," and if they have, it

hasn't affected their musical ability a
great deal. "The New America" is still a
very good album, and is definitely worth
checking out before a cent of your money
goes to Blink-182.

Fall teams look to leave mark
From PREVIEWS, pg. 20

Men's Soccer

Last season wasn't a
pretty one for this squad as
they finished 4-15, 1-8 in the
Centennial Conference. They
should be able to improve on
that with nearly everyone re-

turning, including two of
their top players, GK Chris
Milla 'O3 and F Aurelio Perez
'O2. Milla weathered a storm
last season in the cage and is

the type of talent who can

play out-of-this-world games
to support an anemic offense.
Perez is a dangerous striker

with excellent pace who tied
for the team lead last season
with two goals. It is hoped
that a fresh start with new
coach Don Norton can turn
this young team around.
Early Returns: Beat
Catholic 1-0; Lost to King's
Point 5-0

Football
The light at the end of the
tunnel is rapidly approaching
for the Garnet. Third-year
coach Pete Alvanos hopes to
pick up Swarthmore's first
conference victory in five
years this season and, for the
first time, he has the firepower to do it. Captain Scott

Murray 'Ol returns as the
field general with the Centennial Conference's third leading rusher, Ken Clark 'O3, the
Garnet's main offense
weapon at tailback. Silky
smooth WR Blake Atkins 'O2
is Murray's top target in the
passing game. A stronger offensive line buoyed by a number of beefy freshmen should
be able to pave the way for
Clark, Murray & Co.
The Garnet will also be
stronger than in years past on
defense. Joe Corso 'O2 and
Axel Neff 'O2 lead a tough
front seven, while Senior DB
Tony Hillery directs a secondary that has the potential to
step it up this year.
Early Returns: Beat
Oberlin 28-6 in their season
opener.

Volleyball
First-year coach Chang
Han leads a small squad that
has the potential to surprise.
Swarthmore will be led by se-

niors Fran Smith, Bonnie
French and Lily Marsh, a
strong trio in terms of both
skill and leadership. The Garnet will be looking to improve
on last year's 4-20 season. They
went 1-9 in the Centennial
Conference, but this conference record was deceiving
-

they played close matches
with Muhlenberg, Dickinson
and Haverford where they
were barely edged out in five
sets.

Men's Cross Country
Senior Mark Jeuland
leads a team hit fairly hard by
graduation. The Garnet were
third last season in the Centennial Conference but will
need some of the younger
runners to step up in order to
repeat that performance.
Jeuland is one of the top distance runners in the conference, having placed ninthlast
year. Sam Evans 'Ol is another top 20 Centennial Conference returner.

Women's Cross
Country
With Joko Agunloye 'Ol,
the defending Centennial
Conference champion and
NCAA qualifier, as their only
established runner, the Garnet will have to rely on depth
to repeat last year's sixthplace performance. Among

their other senior runners
are Cristina Cardemil, Alissa
Parmelee, Loring Pfeiffer and
Maggie Thomer. Pete Carroll,
a former Villanova track star,
is the head coach.

Fall sports preview
BY TED CHAN

Field Hockey

Hope springs
eternal at Swat
A clean slate. It's what we all start with in the
fall. Hope springs eternal with the incoming
freshman class, whether in the form of fresh meat
ripe for the picking, or an infusion of new blood
with sprightly legs (pardon my mixed metaphors).
Think about it this way. Every team has
graduated a few significant players from last year.
But each team also has a new class of seniors who
have the potential to become the next Prefontaine
or Michael Jordan, you never know. I could list
several of these potential playmakers, but their
accomplishments have yet to be scripted. But hey,
you have a clean slate.
In my bordering obsessiveness with all that
occurs in the small world of the Centennial
Conference, I chanced upon an article on the
website (www.centennial.org has lots of random
factoids). Titled "20 Questions for the 2000
Centennial Conference Football Season" it
addresses a number of FAQs that I know you've
been wondering about. Now, for those of you who
don't follow the cutthroat Div. 11l football action, the
article essentially talked about who is or was the
"best."
A sample:
7. How does Gettysburg replace Paul Smith?
(Paul Smith, apparently, was the "best" running
back, despite his less-than-memorable name.)
14. What is the best venue for a Conference
game? Western Maryland's Scott S. Bair Stadium
wins hands-down. The natural amphitheater
permits vehicles to park around the field and view
the game, while spectators are also treated to
views of the spectacular Carroll County
countryside. (Picture the Garnet playing in the
amphitheater. Funny, isn't it?
And my favorite, by far one of the more
interesting of the FAQs in the article:
17. What is the "Conestoga Wagon Trophy"? The
trophy is presented to the winner of the annual
Dickinson-Franklin & Marshall game. It is crafted
as a miniature replica of the wagon that was used
to transport the players between the two schools
when they first met on the field in 1889.
Now CC football fans, don't kick me out of DU
quite yet. Wait until we get to
11 Is Swarthmore turning the corner? The
answer? A resounding "yes" from the CC experts.
I'm being serious here, people. Think about it.
We broke our record losing streak last year with the
big win over Oberlin. And this was not some freak
occurrence, as we beat them again 28-6 this past
weekend.
But aside from this nitpicky losing-streak
nonsense, I think our team is finally ready to take
the next step. The team now has two solid
coaching years under their belts, as well as great
recruiting classes that came with the hard work of
coach Pete Alvanos and his staff. A large number of
starters are returning to the squad this year, and
with last year's experience behind them, I'm sure
many other improved players are looking to break
into the lineup. And with all of the work these guys
have put in, I think we all have to agree that they
deserve to win a game within the Conference.
So even if we don't have to worry about how
we're going to replace Paul Smith, and we will
definitely never ever win the Conestoga Wagon
Trophy, you never know what will happen down
there on Clothier Field this year.
We have a clean slate, after all.

THE PHOENIX

Coached by Karen Borbee, field hockey

is traditionally one ofSwarthmore's strongest sports. This year should be no different. The Garnet is ranked fourth in the
preseason coach's poll but could take all
the marbles ifcertain players step up. Scoring shouldn't be a problem, with two of
the top point-getters in the CentennialConference, Erika Williams 'Ol (#1) and Allison
Gaffney 'O2 (#4), both returning. Amy

Dißenedetto 'O2 is also one of the top forwards in the conference. In the back field,
tri-captain Kristen English 'Ol will be sure
to move the ball the right direction. Big
scorer Meg Woodworth 'O3 should beable
to replace the offensive production oflast
year's senior squad members. Replacing
star goalie JaneKendall may be tough, but
Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 has the ability to
matchKendall's considerable exploits. Her
performance will be one of the keys as a
very deep junior class matures and has the
potential to put this team over the top.
Early Returns: Beat Widener 4-1 in

season opener, beat College of Notre
Dame of Maryland 3-0 in home opener.

Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman Phoenix Staff

First team All-Centennial midfielder Kristen English drives the ball towards
the goal in a recent practice.

Women's Soccer
This is a team that could come out of nowhere and surprise its onlookers. Head
coach Amy Brunner's recruiting efforts in
her first two years have turned around a
program that has only threeseniors and two
juniors. While the upperclasswomen are
scarce, they are also excellent athletes. Senior tri-captains Sari Altschuler, Heather
Marandolaand Sarah Jay are among the top
players in the conference at theirrespective
positions. Altschuler already has two shutouts. Watch out for this team as the athletic
youngsters develop cohesiveness with the
three captains as well as with one another.
They've already looked impressive early in
the season, beating up on Immaculata and
Neumann in the Swat Kick Classic before
the finals were monsooned out.
Early Returns: Defeated Immaculata 4-0

and Neumann 2-0 in the Swat Kick Classic.

Yet more rambling from Ted
From CHAN, pg. 20
with the New York Yankees.

•When our football team beat Oberlin

the first time, it was a wonderful lift for

school spirit and a well-deservedreward
for a bunch of good guys who work extremely hard for something that might
occasionally seem Sisyphean. This year
it meant about as much as a promise
from a politician. I go easy on these guys
because I deeply respect the effort the
players and coaching staff have put in.
They've got to get a conference win this
year. My prediction: Swarthmore 21,
F&M: 7 at homecoming. Ken Clark goes
for 100+ yards and 2 TDs.
Pretty soon, sports video games will
be so realistic you'll be able to choose
whether you go to the local strip joint or
go home and beat your pregnant wife afterpractice. I got sick a few years ago and
ended up at Children's Hospital in Boston, where they give you a Nintendo and
a whole pile of games (if you have an extra system or old games sitting around
while you sell your soul to Dreamcast,

donate them to the local hospital, or go
yourself and groove a ninth inning, tiegame fastball to a 11-year-old kid with leukemia.) Anyhow, at Children's, I got
hooked again on the old Nintendo. I honestly believe those old sports games were
as fun as they could get, truly charming
in their simplicity. How about these:
"Bomb

hit?" "Photon Ball?" "Miracle Catch?"
4) Tecmo Bowl
A great game with
a few loopholes. For instance, you could
always score with Clarence Verdann
(Colts KR), the 49ers, Bo Jackson and a
few others. You'd think that would have
taken the strategy out of the game, but
the key was playing with the Giants and
scoring every time, then using L.T. to
block the extra point.
Ah, I yearn for
3) Blades of Steel
the days when hockey was played by
skinny guys, fat guys and medium guys.
And the most well-animated parts of the
game were the fights.
2) Mike Tyson's Punchout

can't get the freaking timing down on the
Bull Charge.

Be the Red Sox,

pinch hit with Tony Armas; You will
be pleased with the results. This game
is truly the timeless classic, the 1927

Yankees of Nintendo sports games.
Credit old friend Scott Kushner
with this one: "They should just call
the game when the Buccaneers get to
twenty points."
Although I hesitate to say it, the
NFL should be more predictable this
year. The Colts, Jags and Titans
should be the class of the AFC, while
the Redskins, Bucs and Rams look to
be best in the NFC. You can mix and
match your Super Bowl matchup
from those teams. Ofcourse, last year,
the Jets, Falcons, 49ers and Broncos
were considered the class of the
league and all four bombed like Vanilla Ice's second album.
In any case, it was a tough six
months without football. Watching
NFL Films, the draft, and old tapes
in the off-season just doesn't cut it.

interception into the final touchdown of the game. In the end,
Oberlin had six turnovers to
Swarthmore's three and Murray
completed 10 of 17 throws for 118
yards. "He kept the offense going," said Alvanos. "There was

no letdown."
The GarnetTide has a formidable loss record to overcome
it had a record 28-game losing
streak last year, broken by the
victory over Oberlin a year ago.
But spirits are up for this season.
"The combination of senior

leadership and underclassmen
stepping up has provided us with
a strong nucleus that is prepared
to win," said Murray.
The players are especially appreciative of Alvanos' positive
influence on the program. "In the
three years he's been here, he's
taken this team and instilled in

us a great team ethic," saidoffensive
lineman Justin Pagliei 'O2, "and now
we're ready to convert that ethic
into wins on the field."
The GarnetTide plays its first conference game against Johns Hopkins
next Saturday. Johns Hopkins is expected to come in strong, having
beaten Swarthmore 157-3 over the past
three years, but the Tide is ready for
the challenge. "It's time we got back
at Hopkins for the last three years,"
said Murray.

The team hopes to see support
from other Swarthmore students as
well.
"Playing at home, we need the
twelfth man to be on our side, just
like we needed him last year against
Oberlin," Murray continued, referring to fan support.
But most of all, the Tide plans to
keep raising expectations.
"We're going to surprise some
people," said Robert Melick 'O3.
"We're going to do some damage in

the conference this year."

Picking up
the pieces
Back from Boston with none of the games I want to
watch on Philly TV, it's time for this sportswriter to
clean out the Willets storage of his brain.
■ Tiger Woods has controlled his opponents on the
PGA tour better than a $lOOO-a-night dominatrix. I'd list
some ofhis accomplishments, but if you're enough of a
sports fan to read my humble column, you probably already know that he's that damn good. What will be left
for Tiger to do after he plays five more years and wins
12 or 13 more majors? Perhaps Elvis Costello best described it when he sang "Less than Zero."
If Woods called me up and asked me for advice on
what he should do after retirement, I'd tell him to go
into politics. Like golf, I believe this is an area dominated by overweight white guys where Tiger could clean
house. He could be the first black and the first Asian
president. Remember, Tiger's got a Stanford degree and
he's charismatic, recognizable and intelligent. And, perhaps most importantly, after a few more years of "work,"
Tiger will be 10 percent richer than God and money is
the one thing you really need to succeed in politics. Hey,
if he were the Democratic nominee, I'd vote for him over
George (thanks, Dad) Bush, Jr. Then again, I'd vote for

a Satan/Stalin ticket before Bush.
■ Speaking of transcendent athletes, it's a privilege
to live in Boston and get to root for Pedro Martinez. MVP,
Cy Young, forget the honors, he's one of the five most
dominating pitchers in the history of the game.
I watched a great game Pedro pitched last week where
he hit the first batter of the game and thenretired the
next 24, taking a no-hitter into the ninth inning. What
made it especially remarkable was that first batter,
Gerald Williams, charged the mound, inciting a benchclearing brawl and touching off a series of wild events.
The Devil Rays threw at Red Sox first-baseman Brian
Daubach five times and missed basically every time.
Tampa needs to worry less about Pedro pitching inside
and more about their pitchers being unable to hit a target. When Williams charged the mound, I almost bought
a ticket to Florida to fight for Pedro. Probably most of
Red Sox Nation did.
It was real baseball, the kind that true fans like to
see. Brawls, brushbacks and good pitching. I don't like
signing on to CBS Sportsline in the morning and trying
to figure out whether I'm looking at a Cardinals-Padres
score or a Rams-Chargers one.
■ You know, the only damned Sun I saw this summer was an ElOOOO server. People asked me why I spent
this summer in a cubicle in Marlboro, Mass, while most
of my college-aged friends spent it on the beach ogling

tan booty and getting smashed and/or high. Besides a
possibly snide answer regarding my preference forfairskinned ladies who are literate, I gave 'em the real answer. I want to own the Red Sox, or at least be able to
afford the best seats in Fenway Park: right near the
bullpen so I can throw my watered-down $7 beer at the
Mariano Rivera and tell him I did his mom Dominican
style. I wantto yell, "Yankees suck," even though I know
they don't.
Most of all, I want the prom queen, the girl you know
will gouge your heart out of your ribcage and stomp on
it. That's how being a Red Sox fan feels. You know that
heartbreak is inevitable, but in September you fool yourself into thinking it won't happen. "Us, World Series
it's as sure as a prom-night blow job," you say to your-

self.

Tide defeats Oberlin again
Team shakes sluggish start to rout
Yeomen 28-6 last Saturday in Ohio
BY ANNA MASILELA
Following a tradition established last year, thefootball team
beat Oberlin, 28-6, in the first game of the year on Sept. 2. Although the away game was a non-Centennial Conference
matchup, captain Tony Hillery 'Ol was named the conference's
defensive player of the week while captain Scott Murray 'Ol
and nose tackle Matt Asano 'O2 were both named to the conference honor roll.
The team hopes to capitalize on the bright beginning to
the season.
"We have the potential," said Justin Crosby 'O4. "Now we
just need to do it."
The Garnet Tide had a soft start against Oberlin. After the

opening kickoff, the team had trouble fielding the ball. The
defense held off two attempts but Oberlin scored a touchdown on the third play.
"I must admit, I had a lump in my throat for those minutes," said Head Coach Peter Alvanos. "But to our players'
credit, they didn't throw in the towel and the defense did a
tremendous job."
Axel Neff'O2 blocked Oberlin's extrapoint, and by halftime the Tide was ahead 7-6.
The Oberlin Yeomen sank during the second half. "The
defense completely dominated the game, allowing the offense to make turnovers into touchdowns," said center
Chris Morello 'O3. A long, sustained drive gave the Garnet

Tide its second touchdown.
Matt Trakimas 'O3 blocked a punt, leading to the third
touchdown, and the offense converted a fourth-quarter
