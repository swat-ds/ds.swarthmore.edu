:00 and 2:00 a.m. on the
norning of Friday, Septem)er 25.
Kramer, outraged over
he erasure of earlier anti>olice chalkings, scrawled
he current chalkings in an
ittempt to bring the issue of
ree speech to public consciousness. "I think the inciient of anti-police chalking

Kramer said.
The chalkings were between Parrish and Magill
walk. "If you can't criticize
he men with guns, who can
tou?" one chalking stated.
Another began "The following words were erased:" and
continued, listing a number
Df police insults including
"pig," "copper" and "Jerk
Officer, Sir." Other chalkings
employed epithets and pro"anity. A final chalking stated
'For more info, contact Josh
Kramer," going on to list his
e-mail address and phone extension.
The college handbook
(1998-99 edition) states that
'Anonymous offensive exjression is generally inexcusable, but the risk of harm
in making ajudicable all
forms of offensive expression would... seriously endanger academic freedom.
Even when individuals (or
groups) admit authorship,
however, they act irresponsibly if they are unwilling to
engage in a defense of their
views, especially with those
targeted." Kramer's signature
places his speech outside of
the limits of "inexcusable"
expression.
News of the chalking first
spread when a caller to the
WSRN talk show "Red Tide"
stated that he had observed
Kramer working on the
chalkings. When questioned,
the caller said Kramer vowed
to guard the chalkings
against erasure and to explain
his position to any administrators, students, or public
safety officers that happened
to come along.
Kramer himself was the
next caller to the radio show.
He confirmed that he had been
the author of the chalkings,
though he later explained his
main purpose was not to insult
the police but to fight censorship, whatever the actual content of the speech may be.

Kramer signed his name to
the chalkings in order to open
a dialouge about censorship
on campus.
"I am not
afraid." Kramer stated. "I
intend to go down there and
talk about it."
Kramer was adamant
about the value of free speech,
explaining that his decision to
sign the chalkings"doesn't
mean I think any less of speach
that isn't signed."
When this reporter arrived to observe the
chalkings at approximately
2:30 a.m., a public safety officer was already present,
apparently recording the
words of the chalking. At approximately 2:40 a.m., Oficer Johnson arrived.
When asked if Public

chalkings, Johnson answered
"Our job has been completed

SWARTHMORE COLLEGE, SWARTHMORE, PA

The struggling Swarthmore business district is located off route 320. The problems with
the downtown's economic viability have prompted the formation of two subsequent
committees to address the matter, photo by Electra Kaczorowski

Borough task force addresses
ailing business district's woes
Second such committee
reduces college reps to single
member, Maurice Eldridge
by Lance Langdon
Staff Writer

In the face of the Swarth-

more business district's falling
revenues and prestige, the bor-

ough has formed "The Town
Center Task Force." However,
students hoping to see a rocking new pub or dance club
downtown anytime soon will be
sorely disappointed. The Swarthmore Borough Counsel still
gets the final word on what to
build downtown, and that word
won't come until late spring.
The Task Force's first open
hearing on Tuesday, September
16 passed without any incident
or overt hostility. But the apparent calm belied a town torn by
dissension over the appropriate
course of action. Many conservative, mostly older residents
favor a total freeze on the town's
development. However, there
are others that would rather
implement major projects, such
as building a town inn, than see
the Ville die away in the face of
pressure from larger businesses
along the Baltimore Pike.
Amidst this firestorm of
controversy, the Town Center
Task Force must forge a middle
path, remembering the fate of its
bolder predecessor, the "Swarthmore Strategic Planning Corn-

mittee." Last Spring, that committee dissolved in the face of
villagers' alarm about a proposed survey of the public's
tastes in new businesses. Many
villagers felt the survey should
have been given to locals first.
That the college planned to disregard town opinion only betrayed its hidden desire to use
the committee for its own purposes. The tension caused by the
survey controversy, along with
the college's strong membership
on the committee (holding 3 of
11 spots), resulted in its ultimate
dissolution.
The new Task Force is more
diverse in its composition, with
local merchants and residents
making up most of its 15 members. Maurice Eldridge,
Swarthmore's Vice President for
College and Community relations, is the only member of the
Task Force with college ties.
An outside consultant has
been hired, using equal amounts
of money from the college and
the borough counsel. As consultant, James Harding of Urban
Partners will collect dataregarding traffic patterns, consumer
and merchant preferences, the
needs of students, faculty and
staff at Swarthmore College,
and so on. This data will assist
the Task Force in writing a Draft

Final Implementation Plan this
spring. The Swarthmore Borough counsel will then review
the plan. At this point, the counsel will have many options, just
a few of which are to recruit
outside companies to invest in
the area or request participation
and funding by Swarthmore
College. The counsel mayalso,
of course, leave the town as it
is.
How can Swarthmore students get involved in this whole
process? To begin with, Task
Force meetings are open to the
public, and will provide an open
speech forum at the end of each
meeting. Meetings will be held
the first Tuesday of every month
at 7:30 p.m., in the Town Hall
located on 121 Park Ave.
Ideas about further sampling student opinion are in the
works. Right now, Harding and
Eldridge are looking into the
possibility of a student forum,
or working with the student
counsel. Already, surveys were
passed out to first years and their
parents at the beginning of the
school year in an attempt to research popular development
options. As town manager Billings comments, "There is a tremendous interest in getting student input." The next nine
months will prove decisive in
the future of the Ville. Student
participation in the decision process is necessary if that future
is to better accommodate the
1400 residents with disposable
income and a hunger for activity living at the top of the hill.

Last Wed., President Alfred
Bloom addressed the faculty
with the recommendations of
twelve planning groups who
propose radical changes to
Swarthmore over the next 10
years.
"We need a full community
discussion of the changes that
we will undergo in order to form
a mandate for change," he said.
The planning groups submitted preliminary reports to
Bloom, each proposing reforms
to specific aspects ofthe school.
The Facilities Committee
proposed renovations to several
buildings including Dupont,
Parrish, McCabe, Martin, and
the athletic facilities. The committee also proposed that Swarthmore build new residence
halls to lessen the college's dependence on off campus housing.
Some students disagreed
with this proposal.
"We don't need a new dorm.
We should just keep the college
small," said Diana Hunt '99.
Hunt recommended that Swarthmore solve its housing problems by admitting fewer new
students.
The Financial Aid Committee proposed that Swarthmore
lower student loan expectations
and allow students more leniency in paying back their
debts. Also, this committee
wanted to lift the cap on financial aid for international students, treating these students the
same as the rest of the student
body.
Financial
Aid
The
Committee's also proposed to
excuse students who get financial aid from one summer of
work expectations so they can
work an unpaid internship or
travel abroad. Many students
expressed support for this proposal.
"I've had to turn down several prestigious internships in
Washington because they didn't
pay enough," said Susan Novak
'99.
Novak traveled abroad last
semester and returned home in
July. She said she could not
earn the money that Swarthmore
requires students on financial
aid to earn because she chose to
study abroad.
"I was unable to pay for my
books this semester," she said.

dents. The planning groups recommend that the college increase second semester leaves
for professors, hire more faculty
in certain departments, and offer freshmen seminars to all students. The professors of these
seminars would serve a dual role
as academic advisors to the enrolled students.
"We have received great
feedback from freshmen who
have been enrolled in seminars,
and we feel that the intimate
environment ofthe seminar will
allow the advisors to know the
students," said Bloom.
The committees also suggested the creation of new departments such as Islamic studies or a department for film and
media.
Among other noteworthy
proposals, the planning committees have proposed a massive
publicity campaign to make
Swarthmore as well-known as
other elite and colleges and universities.
The costs of all these proposals are high. President
Bloom said the cost of renovating Dupont alone is likely to run
up to $6O million.
To implement some of the
committees' ideas, the college
plans to begin a massive fund
raising campaign.
"We hope to raise $ 150 million over the next five years,"
said Bloom, "and I am committed to doing that. This is an
awesome figure, and one we
need to raise to keep Swarthmore at a high level."
Bloom emphasized the
idea that the planning groups
are merely the brainstormers
at the beginning of a long process, and that faculty and student involvement are essential
to reforming Swarthmore successfully.

Letters

to the

Editor

Bi-partisan letter
responds to Kaufman
Dear Editor,
While reading last week's Phoenix, we were struck by
Simon Kaufman's piece "Liberal majorities need equal opposition," which we believe wholly misinterpreted the political
climate on campus. As Membership Chair of the College
Democrats and former president of the Swarthmore Conservative Union, we have seen how politics plays itself out on campus, and rarely is it in discussion.
Swarthmore's self-defined liberal majority is not one that
debates the fine points ofpolitics. Rather, it is active in fighting
against the forces that threaten its values. Take, for example, the
Pro-Choice Task Force or Empty the Shelters. In neither group is
the emphasis placed on debate over abortion or homelessness;
students know what they believe, and they fight for preservation
of those values.
This is not to say that discussion does not occur within these
groups or on the campus at large. However, theoretical political
debate is less relevant when students are consumed with the
theoretical implications of Plato or Post-Modernism. Politics at
Swarthmore is hands on, not theoretical.
The emphasis on activism is clear evidence that beliefs have
not been "imposed" on anyone, or that people have not examined what they truly believe. To the contrary, considering the
range of groups all along the political spectrum, Swatties harbor
strong convictions and act upon them.
Although most of these groups are bastions of the liberal
majority, the conservative presence is encouraged and welcomed
on campus. When discussion is appropriate, professors often
seek a range of political viewpoints on any given issue. Despite
the liberal majority, student organizations reflect political
diversity, evidenced by groups including the Third Wing,
Swarthmore Students Advocating Life, and the Swarthmore
Civil Liberties Union.
Anyone seeking "the interchange of different ideas" ought to
appreciate the challenges posed by the liberal majority. Instead
of suggesting the elimination of that majority, Mr. Kaufman
ought to appreciate it for the very reasons he suggested its
destruction. Being a part of a political minority presents challenges to any ideology, allowing for exploration of viewpoints
which might otherwise have never been encountered. Nothing is
more valuable than self-examination in the face of great opposition, and indeed, such reflection inevitably leads to a greater
understanding of one's own ideals.
No one knows this better than Swarthmore's liberal majority.
Before coming to Swarthmore, many students faced the harsh
realities of being in the political and cultural minority. They
sought out Swarthmore, knowing that this would be a place
where their ideas are valued and accepted, perhaps at the expense of a conservative point of view. For better or for worse,
the liberal majority defines Swarthmore, and likely will for years
to come.

Braveheart portrays homosexuality as comic relief
by Talia Young
Contributing Writer
CUT. Open to a small clearing in
the woods. A slender, red-haired young
woman is bound to a post. A weathered
man in armor strides up to her and
abruptly slits her throat. The audience
cringes, horrified by his brutality. Cut
to woman's lover, devastated by his loss.
The audience dabs its eyes.
CUT. Open to the interior of a
drafty stone castle. Another weathered
man, this one dressed as a king, strides
angrily down the passageway toward
two men standing in the corner. A furious conversation ensues, interrupted by
one man seizing the other and shoving
him out the window. Cut to splayed,
broken figure on pavement below. Cut
to face of man's lover, horrified. The
audience bursts out laughing.
These contrasting audience reactions seem incongruous now. Yet it
seemed almost natural to me as I sat in
the theater wanting to giggle along with
the rest of the audience enthralled by
Mel Gibson's Braveheart. After all, the
woman is an innocent young maiden,
unjustly slaughtered to spite her lover,
William Wallace. Prince Edward II and
his lover, Philip, on the other hand, are
utterly useless pansies.They wear frufru clothing and makeup, prance around
and do nothing to help King Edward
protect England from the invading Scottish barbarians. King Edward himself
says of his son, "The mere sight of him
would only encourage an enemy to take
over the whole country." Shoving Philip

out the window adds comic relief after
three hours of gory warfare, but such
mockery of gay stereotypes (like
effemininity and ineptitude) in Prince
Edward and Philip gives the audience
the right to think of them as less than
individuals and suggests that all gay
people fulfill such stereotypes. As the
LA Reader's Andy Klein points out,
"It's not merely that one of the film's
leading sources of humor is making fun

The entertainment
industry has
encouraged Mel
Gibson's bigotry.
of Edward's effeminate manner....But,
when Edward throws one of his son's
boyfriends—who seems neither incompetent nor effeminate —out the window,
the scene is played for a big laugh. That
it never happened is almost beside the
point; that if it had happened, it wouldn't
have been the least bit funny, is the
point." (<http://www.glaad.org/glaad/
9507/braveheart-demo.html>)
GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation) launched a campaign against the movie when it was
released, picketing theaters and handing out leaflets which said, "Mel
Gibson has gone out of his way to use
his powers as director and star against

gays. How brave is his gay bashing—and how funny is it—when we are
beaten up on the streets of America
because of who we are and whom we
love?"
Whenever I bring up this issue
among crowds of dedicated Braveheart
fans, they are outraged. "It's one of the
greatest movies of all time! Braveheart
was so awesome! Besides, Edward II
was gay!" It's true that the movie won
five Academy Awards (including Best
Picture) and was nominated for five others. It's true that history books cite William Wallace as "one of Scotland's
greatest national heroes." (Britannica
On-line) It is also true that historians
seem to agree that Edward II was "was
as much of a failure as a king as his father was a success," and that he had
"homosexual lovers." (Britannica Online) None of these facts mean, however, that he wore lipstick or simpered
around the castle.
Given this blatant anti-gay sentiment, I was disappointed to see signs
advertising a showing of Braveheart
last weekend at Swarthmore. I am not
in favor of censorship. I only question
why this movie, instead of so many
others, was chosen as one with something to offer us. Would an equally
blatantly racist movie have been
shown here for Saturday night entertainment? Mel Gibson's bigotry and
the entertainment industry's encouragement of it are what I take offense
to, but we at Swarthmore might have
shown more taste and sensitivity than
to condone it as well.

Conservative minority
needs to take a stand
by Justin Capps

Contributing Writer

-

Inevitably, in a demo-

cratic society, there will ex-

ist

fumbling government, since
it still controlled a third of the
electoral votes, but it re-

mained bitter about the indemnities it was forced to
pay." We can glean from this
that the South felt its grudge
was more important than the
condition of the nation as a
whole. Is Mr. Kaufman implying that the "conservative
minority" on this campus is
willing to harbor ill will toward the "liberal majority"...
even at the cost of the degradation of the school? The
over-simplified terms "liberal" and "conservative" do
not even begin to capture the
essence of the matter.
What must be considered
here is the fact that members
of the minority feel silenced.
Class discussion is limited, and
the discussion that does occur
leads to ill will. While some
might attribute this to the pressure which conservative students feel to either opt for
muteness or extremism, I attribute it to
the lack of
conviction in
the beliefs of
those who
feel silenced.
Why does a
conservative
student feel
that his or her
ideas
shouldn't be
shared? Are
the ideas not
firmly enough believed in to
lay them on the line and deal
with whatever the reaction
may be? Although the interchange of intellectual ideas is
not quite analogous to the demand for civil rights, the potential scorn and violence that
are associated withboth makes
the cases similar enough. If
one does not feel strongly
enough to state one's belief,
then why bother believing at

l

factions. Many would
view it as a "necessary evil"
: torallow the kind of openness
that is associated with that
idea. In the article "Liberal
Majorities Need Equal Opposition," Simon Kaufman
'O2 discussed the "complacent majority" that makes its
home here at Swarthmore.
According to Kaufman, this
group has dared to "manifest
itself in service clubs, campus groups, and pamphlets."
But what is wrong with these
fundamental parts of the college experience?
Mr. Kaufman has attempted to make a comparison between the current condition of our beloved school
and the falls of the Greeks
and the^reconstruction-era
South. The complacent majority in the Greek scenario
was
the
population of
Athens,
which carried
on its existence without
paying heed
to the "resentful citystates" which
were uniting
against the
residents of
Athens. The
"culture and intellectual freedom" of the society "devolved into petty bickering."
Now, perhaps I am wrong,
but wouldn't it make sense
for this resentful minority to
raise its voice in a call for
change? The idea is not original. The abolitionists and
many free blacks made the
call for change in the Civil
War era. According to Mr.
Kaufman, "[t]he South might
have been able to assist the all?

Every sexual encounter is

Because I believe the

is the duty of both houses of

It is impossible to overestimate the amount of trust we

NEWS:

September 25,1998

Students arriving on campus
this year were greeted with a few
unexpected treats on the public
area Macintoshes: a slick new
screen with 3-D icons; a new,
more advanced word processor
and updated e-mail program; and
more personal space on the student server for every student.
However, the various upgrades resulted in a noticeable
slowdown in many aspects of
computer use, a complaint voiced
often by public area users.
The Computing Center (CC)
is well aware of the speed decrease and has been taking steps
to alleviate the problem.
The perceived sluggishness
stems from several sources. In an
effort tokeep software up-to-date,
this summer CC employees installed System 8 (which gives
computers a "platinum" interface
and more stability, at the expense
of speed) on every public area
Macintosh. In addition, Eudora
Pro 4.0, the successor to last
year's version 3, became the official e-mail program, and
Microsoft Word 98 replaced
WordPerfect as the standard word
processor.
The downside to software
upgrades, though, is that newer
programs tend to have far more
features, which makes them more
monolithic and noticeably slower
at times.
The new practice of automatically allotting five megabytes
of space to each student (in the
past, students had to apply for an
account on the network) is also a
contributing factor. Since all students on campus now have a
folder on the server, it takes longer

However, said Preset, "The

two or three times faster than in
the beginning of the semester because of various adjustments
made to them since then."
Fortunately, the CC's longrun plans promise users even
greater relief. One major change
will occur this summer, when the

models have yet to be determined,
Judy Downing, Director ofComputing and Computer Services,

Downing.

that will happen."
Besides the date of the open
house, this year the admissions
office made small changes in the
activities as well.
"We involved more and
more faculty. For instance, last
year only a couple faculty members participated in drop-in conversation," said Mamlet, referring to the informal conversations with faculty members.
"This year we had several professors talking to the students."
Overall, Mamlet believed
that the open house was wellreceived by the prospective students.
"Whenever students really
spend time on the campus, they
usually end up liking it," she
said. "Students come here, and
what they find is really compelling."
Sam Prouty 'OO, a tour
guide who assisted admissions
at the open house, agreed.
"They [the visitors] certainly all seemed to be impressed with our school," he
said. To learn what students
thought of Swarthmore, one parent pulled Prouty aside, and interviewed him as if he were a
prospective student.
"He seemed happy to hear
that my original impressions of
Swarthmore turned out to be
correct," said Prouty.
"By November a lot of students are pretty certain of what
school they want to attend. But
in September most students
don't yet know where they're
going," Mamlet said.

Several homophobic
incidents plague campus
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Contributing Writer
Three anonymous acts of
homophobia have occurred
on campus since the semester began. One or more
people wrote a slur on a students dorm marker board,
scribbled on the Swarthmore Queer Union section
of the Intercultural Center
banner, and removed materials from the SQU board
in Parrish.
According to SQU cocoordinator Ben Maulbeck
'99, on Sept. 10 someone
wrote outside senior, Mark
Charette's door, "Mark is a
fag. SQU meeting tonight."
The Intercultural Center banner was vandalized
on Sept. 13. A week later,
on the evening of Sept. 20,
Maulbeck discovered that
half of the signs and announcements had been
taken off the SQU board.
Administrators cannot
respond to the perpetrators
of anonymous incidents,
said Bob Gross, Dean of
the College.
"When there are leads
we try to follow up on
them,"
said
Owen
Redgrave, Director of Public Safety. 'Typically there
aren't any leads."
The incidents will be
referred to the Dean's Advisory Council at its next
meeting, said Gross. Also,
the deans and resident advisors have been trained
about queer issues.
The speech code recommends intervention for
repeated incidents by the
same person, Gross said.
Charette said that
while the incident outside
his dormroom did not "personally threaten" him, he
was disappointed that
someone felt comfortable
writing the statement.
"They didn't think
about the impact that it
could have on other
people," he said.
Maulbeck said when
he discovered that signs
and announcements had
been removed from the
SQU board, "I guess denial
was my first reaction and I
wanted to believe they had
just fallen off. Then I felt
angry that someone had

just had so little respect."
The SQU board met the next
day to discuss the incident and
Maulbeck immediately replaced
the missing signs.
This is not the first time this
year that homophobic incidents
have occurred.
summer,
"Over
the
Maulbeck said, someone came
into the SQU room and wrote [a
homophobic statement] on one of
the bookcases."
There have also been several
chalkings around campus, said
Corey Datz-Greenberg 'OO, a
SQU advisor. "The incidents
show that people feel comfortable
expressing homophobic feelings
on this campus," he said.
Gross said that homophobic
incidents have occurred for many
years.
"It seems like every year at
the beginning ofthe year there are
homophobic incidents," agreed
Maulbeck. "They have happened
very early and in rapid succession."
Redgrave agrees. "I think it's
one of the heaviest times for all
kinds of incidents," he said. He
also pointed out that not all of the
incidents that occurare reported.
"The college should not overreact to what are obviously immature and irresponsible gestures,
but Swarthmore tries to educate
the campus about diversity. In
general, this is a queer-friendly
institution," said Gross.
But homophobia is still widespread in the general population,
he added.
People were not aware ofthe
incidents, Datz-Greenberg said.
"Why does no one on this campus know what happened?" he
asked.
The college policy on expression in the student handbook
reads, "Anonymous offensive expression is generally inexcusable,
but the risk of harm in making
adjudicable all forms ofoffensive
expression would not only outweigh the benefits ofofficial proscription, it would also seriously
endanger academic freedom."
However, those expressions
can cause harm.
"Those expressions may
make queer and questioning students feel either physically or
emotionally unsafe," said DatzGreenberg.
But there may not be any way
to prevent them.
Gross said, "I don't think
anything we do is going to prevent some kid from scribbling on
the wall."

DiLeo maintained, Schlottmann
is able to "create a coherent vision for WSRN."
As candid as Schlottmann
was about his love for music, he
was reluctant to talk about his
skill as a trumpet

likewise extends to
all of his endeavors
and only through extreme diligence can

Schlottmann's, attested to
Kevin's "profound knowledge
of music" and to his talent. He
noted that Schlottmann is gifted
with the ability to "criticize
without being critical," although
he admited that his extraordinary understanding of music
sometimes causes him to be
"frustrated by being both
teacher and student when he
plays."
The truly remarkable thing
about Schlottmann is that he has
continued with his commitment
to music and yet avoided typical Swattie stress. While others
fret, he has remained dedicated
to a different directed procrastination each semester, varying
from hackey sacking to cribbage

by Patrick Boe
Contributing Writer
Eagle Eye Cherry, descendant of Don and Neneh Cherry
and known for the hit song
"Save Tonight," can put together
and execute a decent pop tune,
because all that takes is skill.
What he can't seem to do is
make it mean something.
His show Saturday night at
the Theater of the Living Arts
in Philadelphia was a fine display of technical proficiency,
but there wasn't a lot of fun or
interest in it. Somehow, Cherry
never developed a love or pas-

sion for music.
The show opened with a
good-looking folk singer named
Jude. It was just him and his
overamplified acoustic guitar,
plus a bassist for part of the set.
He gave a very intense, stationary performance —I don't think
he even shuffled his feet until
he left the stage.
His type of guitar play was
the percussive, frenetic strumming style popularized by Ani
DiFranco. His songs focused
more on expression than melody
or sonorous singing, which
works for Dylan but didn't work
so well here. There simply

wasn't anything lying beneath
the expression.
The performance was fine,
but Jude didn't surpass your average college student folk act.
His lyrics, guitarwork, voice and
attitude were all uniformly unremarkable.
Jude did have a really cool
falsetto, however, which he
whipped out occasionally to add
interest to his songs. It would
have been fun to see him do a
whole set with just that falsetto,
because it was truly pleasing
while his regular singing voice
was just average.
He sang one good mourn-

ful song, "Lies That Tie You other percussionist who played

For those of us whose earliest memories are in the early
'Bos, irony is old hat. Ours has
always been a jaded world,
one where Quentin Tarantino
and "Seinfeld" have revolutionized their respective domains and elements of our
own childhoods already have
kitsch appeal (see "The Wedding Singer," or don't, if you
are actually interested in a
good movie).
It's not just the content of
pop culture that has been very
different for our generation,
but the way we understand it.
So many of us now watch "Access Hollywood" and read
"Entertainment Weekly" (or
its lame college magazine
equivalent) that studios and
networks put a tremendous
amount of effort into controlling that spin, sometimes, it
seems, much more than in actually making a quality product.
Last year, Miramax, to
take a rather telling example,
was revealed to have significantly doctored the reported
numbers for "Scream 2"'s
opening weekend gross in order to generate more positive
spin and, as an end result, generate more interest in the picture.
Hollywood, it seems, in
this age of ironically ironic
ironies, is no longer even concerned with image over substance, but with image of image over image itself. Are we
doomed to a neverending
cycle that will go on until, in
20 years, the director will no
longer get possessory credit
("a film by ..."), but the marketing director will?
Although irony shows
little signs of disappearing like
Dana Carvey's career, those of
us who yearn for a little bit
more substance in a world of
reflected images can take heart
when we take a look at what
have been the three biggest
surprises in the film industry
in the past year (and yes, I am
fully aware of the irony of using box-office grosses in a call
for less of a focus on image in
Hollywood).
The biggest surprise was,
of course, the mind-blowing
success of "Titanic," a film all
the "buzz" (postmodern irony
in its worst incarnation) predicted would be a flop of
"Isthtar"-ian proportions.
"Titanic" went on, of
course, to become one of the
most popular films of all time
(not the most successful, contrary to what you've read, as
reported numbers do not reflect inflation) and made everybody reconsider just what
it is the public is looking for
on the big screen.
Most of this discussion
has focused around "Titanic'"s
outstanding effects and
Leonardo DiCaprio's outstanding effects on teenage
girls (both huge factors, to be
sure) but has missed what I
think is the film's most revolutionary and demographic
boundary-crossing qualities,
which is its refreshing innocence and directness.
It is very easy to make fun
of a picture that relies on cliche piled upon two-dimensional characters —Leo and
Kate's rule-breaking love,
Billy Zane's black-hearted
evil, the freedom and joy of
third-class life versus, the
frigid suffocation of the first
class —but "Titanic" is amazingly successful in not only
pulling the viewer into its
story despite the simplicity,
but also for its refusal to stoop
to ever poking fun at or even
admitting awareness of its
cheesiness. That kind of pure
love and black-and-white conflict is rarely seen taken seriously in popular culture anymore.

Especially for those of us

who have grown up with that
state of irony being the norm,
then, "Titanic V simplicity
and directness are something
entirely new and exciting.
These qualities also reflect a
truly appealing world, and after years of "Fargo" and
"Batman Forever," who can
blame us for wanting to fantasize a bit?
Simplicity and directness
do not have to realize themselves in fantasy, however. I,
for one, rarely dream of one
day getting my balls caught in
my zipper, but seeing that,
along with a bunch of other
unfortunate, but never obnox-

iously self-referential, incidents happen to sweet-guy
Ben Stiller in "There's Something About Mary" was by far
the most fun I had in a dark
room this summer (avoid the

obvious jokes, please).
"Mary" was definitely the
biggest surprise of the summer, for, as I mentioned in a
previous column, few thought
this little $26 million grossout comedy would get anyone
besides the teenage boys to
turn out. Bucking expectations, it managed to cross almost every boundary and is on
track to become the summer's
third-biggest grosser.
Like "Titanic," "Something About Mary"'s genius
lies in its simplicity. The jokes
are crude, the plot as flimsy as
an English professor's grasp
on reality and the directing
"style" virtually nonexistent,
but the Farelly Brothers really
tapped into something by going for the jokes that don't
make us think and don't refer
to anything else, but simply
work on their own merits.
"Mary" has no references
to other movies, unwarranted
expansion of shtick that's already worked on televison
and, most importantly, no
signs that the film is "in on the
joke" with the audience at any
point.
A willingness to be forthright with simplistic jokes and
an honesty that shines through
in every glob of cum hanging
from Ben Stiller's ear are very
refreshing qualities and are
what sets "There's Something
About Mary" apart from other
films at a time when most
filmmakers can only make
jokes in terms of other films,
for that is the only real world
they know.
Finally, although it is not
by a longshot one of the biggest failures in Hollywood history, you have got to love what
has happened to "Godzilla."
Put simply, we got sick of the
sell.
It seems that even the
American public has a limit to
how much publicity they can
take without spitting it right
back in a studio's face by refusing to see its film.
The semi-serious word out
now is that "plot matters" will
be the slogan for the next Star
Wars movie (I believe it was
already posted on and then removed from the website), perhaps indicating that a few studio executives have realized
that at least claiming to possess some substantive intellectual value is a useful thing for
a movie to do (of course, most
people seem to think that
"Good Will Hunting" and "Armageddon" have a lot of substantive value, so I wouldn't
get too excited).
I think irony is a great
thing. As anyone who knows
me will tell you, I probably
wouldn't have a sense of humor without it. But after 21
years, I'm just a little sick of
it.
It would be nice, for a
change, to talk about the world
and not the endless images of
the world. I may just be reading too much into each of the
above cases, but I'm sure hoping that simplicity and honesty
are qualities that are reemerging (without dominating, because I still love Kevin Smith,
Tarantino, et. al.) in pop culture.
Oh, the irony ofbeing sick
ofirony as a child of the ironic
age.

The men's rugby team did
nothing to buck the losing trend
of Swarthmore athletics last
weekend, falling themselves by
a score of 46-10 to a very strong
University of Pennsylvania
squad. Swarthmore was undermanned, and outplayed by a surprisingly powerful Penn team
that had only squeaked past
Swarthmore the last two seasons.
The torridly hot day and the
fact that Swarthmore was only
able to bring 17 men to
Pennsylvania's dusty field did
not work in the Buzzard's favor.
The University ofPennsylvania,
using a powerful forward game
and creative plays by their Argentinian backs found and exhole
ploited
in
every
Swarthmore's defense. At the
half, Swarthmore trailed 24-5,
the sole try by the visitors scored
by Jerome Bushnell '99.
Bushnell, after being stuffed on
the tryline while attempting to
take a penalty in, got a second
chance when Pennsylvania
committed another penalty and
squirmed through their forwards

for the points.
This was but a minor blow
in
the
of
University
Pennsylvania's game plan, as
the tries came easily for them.
They evenmanaged the rare feat
of running back a kickoff for a
try. After the half, Swarthmore's
lone highlight was a try by Dan
Green '99, who picked up a
loose ball and outran everyone
to score a try.
Two Swat rookies started
Saturday's game and played remarkably well, considering their
brief exposure to the game beforehand. Josh Lindsay 'Ol and
Kyung Lee 'O2 both demonstrated that they are moving rapidly up the learning curve. Lee
even made a difficult switch
from back to forward midway
through the game.
Swarthmore's major problems came on claiming the ball
from line outs and scrums,
something that the team has
worked on fixing this week as
they prepare for always impressive West Chester this weekend.

of the season, the Buzzards host

It was the best of times, it
was the worst of times...actually,
it was just really hot on Saturday when the women's rugby
team kicked off their season at
home against Vassar College.
After losing eleven seniors, the
Garnet was completely rebuilt in
only two weeks. Despite being
outmatched in experience and
size, Swat's A-side managed to
tie the Brewers 5-5, while the
rookie dominated B-side looked
decent although they lost 0-15.
The GarnetA-side appeared
not to have a good running game
as Vassar maintained possession
of the ball throughout most of
the game. However, the resilient Garnet kept the Brewers
from scoring until well into the
second half. At this point, the
Garnet's defensive game ended
and the offensive game began.

String of shutouts
spiral Swat men's
soccer to 1-8 season
by Amber Adamson
Contributing Writer
Like vultures circling their
inferior prey, Swat's opponents
have taken advantage ofthe lack
of strength on the soccer field.
Swat traveled to Johns Hopkins
University (Md.) Saturday for a
centennial conference contest
only to be sent home with a 7-0
spanking.
"We played a valiant first
half considering we only let up
one goal and were playing on
Astroturf for the first time this
year. The team self-destructed in
the second half when our bench
fell short to theirs and we had
no more energy to match their
fresh subs; we let up six goals
in the second half," summed up
Frank Sersale 'O2.
Perhaps due to the frustration of the winless games,
Coach Dice placed an ultimatum to the team on the following Monday: Quit now or play

ter Swat's forward pack stole the
ball away from a Vassar maul.
The ball finally made its way to
the backs led by captain Meghan
Brennan 'OO and they continued
to gain yardage with their forwards in support. Danielle Thomas '99 took advantage of
Vassar's weakness and managed
to score the tying try with only
a minute left in the game.
Swarthmore's B-side
showed a great deal of composure as they faced the much
more experienced Vassar team.
Abigail Stewart-Tietelbaum 'Ol
andTamaraManik-Perlman 'O2
exemplified the aggression and
tackling prowess ofthe entire Bside as they repeatedly brought
Vassar players to the ground.
The forwards played with substantial determination. Tracy
McNeil 'OO was solid and
Nicole Georges-Abeyie 'O2
dominated the line outs.
This week's Swartz-Thomas award goes to the forward
pack for being able to walk on
Sunday (albeit slowly).

Swat hosted Steven's Tech
on Wednesday, which handed
them a 3-0 loss to add to their
ever-growing tally.
"It's frustrating to lose in
such a manner when we have all
this raw talent that is waiting to
be cultivated into a winning
team," Scott Samels '99 added.
Matt Kaelin 'O2 also voiced
his unhappiness. il came here to
play soccer on a team and it saddens me when we do not come
together as a team that I can envision us being.
Team members said they
would like to thank Tirian Mink
'99, one of the tri-captains for
his inspiring pre-game and halftime speeches. The othertri-captains are Austin Harris '99 and
Mike Schall '99.
Swat hosts Western Maryland on Saturday for a 3:30 conference game and the team travels to Widener on the 29th for a
4:00 non-conference game.

The Garnet's win streak
came to a halt last Saturday
when Swat fell to arch-rival
Gettysburg, 1-3.As anticipated,
the contest was a fierce competition, for it pitted two of last
year's tri-conference champions
against each other. The loss
brings the Garnet's overall
record to 4-1,2-1 in the Centennial Conference.
The Bullets, who entered
the game ranked 4th by a National Field Hockey Coaches
Poll, struck first, scoring on a
breakaway situation. Donna
Griffin '99, ranked 12th in the
coaches' poll, tied it upfor Swat,
though, by aggressively knocking in the rebound off a comer
play with five minutes remaining in the first half. Gettysburg,
now 6-0 overall, went on to
score two goals in the second
half to give them the victory.
The Bullets are the first
team this season to have outshot
the Garnet (10-7), including a 31 margin in the second period.
Gettysburg's first goal ended a
laudable run by Goalie Jane
Kendall 'OO, who notched over
328 consecutive scoreless minutes in front of the cage.
Captain Holly Baker '99
commented on the game, "We
dominated the first part of the
first half, the ball hardly left our
offensive 50 yard zone. As the
minutes ticked away, we did not
keep up our energy and focus.
Our stick-work and our footwork didn't stay solid.
Gettysburg beat us to the ball
and we did not recover well."
Coach Karen Borbee agreed,
"We did not play a fundamentally sound game. Gettysburg
tookadvantage of our lack of execution and the momentum
switched in the second half."
Over the weekend, Swat
will travel north to defend their
title at the Seven Sisters Tournament. "We are determined to
go to Wellesley to play good
hockey and to feel proud of our
team once the final whistle
blows," said Baker.

Women's X-Country Come In Strong, Men Suffer Setback

by

by Anne Frankenfield

Contributing Writer

This past Saturday, the men
and women's cross country
teams both traveled to Johns
Hopkins but unfortunately returned with quite different results. The women's team, who
ran a loopy 5K (3.1 mile) course
easily beat Hopkins 18-41, by
taking the top three places. Joko
Agunloye 'Ol led the pack, finishing first with an overall time
of 20:34, followed closely by
Amalia Jerison 'OO (21:51) in
second, Karen Lloyd 'OO
(22:00) in third, Alissa Parmelee
'Ol (22:12) in fifth and Christina Cardemil 'Ol (22:33) finishing seventh . Rounding off the
field for the women were Jessica George 'OO (22:38), Sarah
McClure 'OO (22:40), Saron
Harry 'OO (23:37), Christen
Lungren 'O2 (24:04) and
Darragh Jones '99 (24:19).
Coach Luci Rosalia commented that she was "very
pleased with our victory over
Hopkins. [The team was] focused and determined during the
entire race." The women im-

prove their record to 2-1 in the
Centennial Conference and 6-1
overall. McClure 'OO had a lot
to comment on in regard to the
team's performance. "As the
first competitive 5K race of the
season, the meet against
Hopkins was a great way to discover [the] team's, as well as
personal, strengths and weaknesses," which would give them
a focus point during practices.
She also commented, "I feel the
team has a lot of potential and
am looking forward to an amazing season." Agunloye 'Ol
added by describing the team as
a "strong, young team with
promising things to come."
The men's team did not
meet the same fortune in their
matchup with Hopkins. Suffering a disappointing loss by a
score of 34-23, the team ran a
"grueling 8K [5 miles] on a
rocky and poorly marked
course" as described by Coach
Rosalia. Leading the Garnet
was sophomore Marc Jeuland

(28:08). Finishing close behind
were Mark Nierman 'Ol (3rd/

Seth Steed 'Ol (36:36). Unfortunately, Sam Evans 'Ol was
unable to run because of a sore
hip. The loss against Hopkins
drops the men to a 1-1 Conference record and a 5-1 overall
record. Despite the tough loss,
the men are setting their sights
on the upcoming meets and the
Conference Championship on
October 31st where they will
race Hopkins again better prepared for competition. "We're
hoping to improve and beat
them in the Conference. It was
a tough race," commented
Jeuland 'Ol.
Both teams will look to improve on earlier performances
and better their overall and conference records on Saturday,
September 26 at Allentown College. The race will include
Muhlenburg and Lebanon Valley, starting at 10 a.m.

The Swarthmore women's
tennis team started their 1998
fall season on September 11th
with a loss to Millersville University 1-8. Swat's lone win
came at the #1 singles position
with Jen Pao 'Ol smashing her
way to a 6-0, 6-2 victory. After
losing two seniors and three
other players to other fall sports
or study abroad, the team majority is made up of talented
freshman.
