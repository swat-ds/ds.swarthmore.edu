Orientation welcomes
frosh to Swarthmore
By Ligeia Jennis and Andy Perrin
When the Class of '97 poured onto campus Saturday, they were
greetedby membersoftheOrientationCommittee.These OC members
also known as Campus Assistants helped themfind their way around
and coordinated a series of meetings, workshops, and activities designed to introduce them to each other and to life at Swarthmore.
In line withSwarthmore tradition, the students were asked to read
a book over the summer and discussit during orientation. Unlike in past
years, though, they were given a choice among six different books. All
thebooks were autobiographies, and all thestudentsread a short article
about the autobiographical genre.
Previous orientation readings have centered around books addressing specific issues. The Class of '93 read The Battle for Human
Nature by Swarthmore professor Barry Schwartz and discussed its
claims. Otherclasses have read The Second Shift by Arlie Hocschild
'62 and You Just Don't Understand by Deborah Tannen.
Some students said that the book discussions were disorganized,
and that some faculty members who led the dicsussions seemed
unprepared, but the general opinion of the session was positive.
Orientation week also included a tie-dye party at Mary Lyon
dormitory, a back rub f est, and screenings of the Rocky HorrorPicture
Show and The Graduate.
On a more serious note, students attended a talk and workshop
with Dean Ngina Lythcott on values and community living. And all
first-year students and transfers participated in workshops by the
Acquaintance Sexual Assault Preventionprogram.
Most first-year students thought orientation was fun and helpful.
Teresa Conrad '97 said, "I didn'trealize how liberal it [Swarthmore]
was until the barbeque in the outdoor auditorium.'' Laura Kozek '97
chimed in, saying the event was "psycho."
JulienLartigue '97, though somewhat confused by registration,
was pleased with orientation, claiming "it gets better every day."
The new students have settled in and are now busy meeting the
returning students and beginning classes.

Workshops discuss sex assault
First-year students worried about invitations to coffee....
By Shulamit Shapiro
and Eli Rubin
The Acquaintance Sexual Assault Prevention Program (ASAP)
the group that conducts sexual assault workshops for new students
underwent several changes in preparation for orientation.
During orientation, upperclass
f acilitatiors showed a video and held
discussion groups on sexualharassment and date rape for first-year
students. Previously, off-campus
professionals prepared the facilitators to direct the seminars. This
year, however, the facilitators felt
experienced enough to run their own
training.
"A lotof us have been active in
anti-rape activism. We felt like we
could do better training. We knew
what we were talking about," said
Andy Perrin '94, a co-coordinator
of ASAP.
The ASAP seminars are held
for approximately 20-30 students at
a time. RA Krister Johnson thought
that this helped theprogram by providing a "more comfortable" atmosphere for students to discuss issues
and emotions. Members of ASAP
agreed that when students are more
familiar with one another, theworkshops are more beneficial.
Perrin pointed out that when
participants knew each other well,
they felt freer to express their true
opinions.
"The workshops are held during Orientation Week, which is a
problem because no one knows each
other well enough to speak their
minds...thebest workshops are those
where people said what we really
didn't want them to," Perrin said.
ASAP's two main goals, according to Perrin, are to keep students from committing sexual assault and to encourage them to de-

-

velop positive models of personal
sexuality.
Students had mixed reactions
both to the video shown and to the
discussions held afterwards.
"It was good for them to have
[the workshops]," said Dianne
Drummond '97. "It gave males and
females more of an understanding
of eachother."
"There was a real lack of high
school immaturity. I was also
pleased to hear that guys wanted
girls to be more aggressive," said
Emily Mott '97.
Justin Hall '97 said that it was
"a good chance for [his] hall to
bond."
JerryKarnas, a sophomore, was
less enthusiastic. He did not feel
that the meeting was necessary at
all.
"There are two kinds of men:
those who will rape and those who
won't Those who do it don'trealize that they're committing rape,
anyway," he said.
Several students felt that the
video was ineffective and predictable.
"They were realistic scenarios
presented unrealistically," said
MotL
Nick Lehmarm '97 said "the
video was pointless" and didn't
change any views.
The current video was produced by Swarthmore students in
1990. The previous video, alsoproduced at Swarthmore, was purchased by 200 other colleges and
used to develop their sexual assault
programs.
"We got so muchnationalpublicity the message of our video was
that men and women have to communicate. If you are the woman,
you have to say 'no* forcefully and
if you are the man, you have to
make your intentions clear," said
Public Relations Officer Lorna
-

Shurkin.
When Swarthmorefirst implemented its sexual assault policies,
the school recieved a lot of media
publicity. Articles appeared in the
Boston Globe, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Time, and US. News and
World Report, stirring much controversy about the school's policy.
Many articles falsely reported that
S warthmoreCollege equates "inappropriate innuendo" with acquaintance rape.
Shurkin, who has worked for
thePublic Relations office since the
controversy, dismissed the articles'
claims. "We didn'tknow what they
were talking about," she said.
This controversy, with its media misunderstanding, has since died
down.

Perrin is pleased with the results of this year's ASAP seminars.
"Workshops have gone quite
smoothly. We took a gamblechanging training, but it's paid off."
Kari Hong '94, also an ASAP
co-director, agreed, adding that "it
is vitally important thatASAP continues to provide this service to

The Phoenix

OpiniOf! September 3. 1993

Editors announce plans
and policies for Phoenix
To those ofus whohave worked with the
Phoenix in the past (or ever held a genuine
interest in it, for that matter), this semester's
aims are going to seem familiar: to "improve
the overall quality of the paper" (Turtzo,
1992 editor). We should all appreciate the
efforts that have gone into maintaining—and
in fact, improving—the paper over the past
few semesters. But we shouldalsorealize that
a lot still needs to be done to transform the
Phoenix from an accepted establishment into
a highly respected and exciting publication.
And quite frankly, the most meaningful part
of that transition begins here.
We think a crucial difference between
this semester and the past is that, all around,
we finally have theeditorial staff(along with
theinterest of arecord-settingfirst-year class)
to accomplish some radical, and hopefully
long-lasting changes.
Listed below are sections of thePhoenix
Style & Policy Guidewhich we feel are most
instrumental in the reshaping of the publication. And, like the editors of the past, we too
have drawn from the editorial experiences of
our predecessors.

Policy/Submissions:

tent as possible. An article's sentences and
paragraphs must be kept short in order to
improve reader comprehension, and they
should be written in an inverted pyramid
style—with the most important facts at the
beginning and the smaller details at the end. It
is important that reporters talk to representatives of both sides of an issue.

Opinion:
Letters to the Editor belong in theOpinion, as do other pieces which express a personal viewpoint and are not primarily for
humorous effect
The Opinion section of the Phoenix is a
place for students, faculty, staff, and alumni
to debate and share views on issues of campus, local, national, and world importance.
Editors may omit printing something in this
section for reasons of length, humorous intent, or narrow and obscure or muddied expression of viewpoint, although this last authority should be applied sparingly.
The editors reserve theright to refuse to
print letters to the editor. Letters to the Editor
from staff members will not be printed as a
matter ofpolicy, withthe exception ofcorrections.

Swarthmore resident urges
caution on Hillborn
To the Editor:
This letteris to alert thereaders of the
Phoenix to the traffic situation along
Hillborn Avenue in the northwest corner
of Swarthmore. Many college students,
faculty and administrators use this street
to go to and from Swarthmore and the
College.
Along with cars, trucks, and motorcycles, schoolbuses and the three-college
jitney, there are joggers, runners, bicyclists, skateboarders, pedestrians, and even
animals who use Hillborn Avenue.
I have been concerned about the in-

creased and fast-moving traffic here and
hope the police of both this borough and
Springfield will give attention to thedangers along this street which, in part, divides the two municipalities.
Therefore, let me ask all who use
Hillbom Avenue to be watchful ofothers
along the street, to obey the speed limit,
and to use all safety precautions.
Sincerely yours,

A Swarthmore graduate andresident

Tri-College Institute
applauded by
students of color
reotypes, found ways to dispel them,

By Frank Kuo-Hui Yu and
Erik Huneke
Since 1972, there has been a
cooperative effort among
S warthmore, Haverford, and Bryn
Mawr Colleges to develop the Tri
College Institute, a program designed specifically for the needs
of the students ofcolor. This year
it was held at Bryn Mawr from
August 18th to August 25th. Joseph Mason, Associate Dean of
Multicultural Affairs, designed the
program in concert withECLJPSE,
an organization specializing in "human relations and cultural diversity training."
Mason coordinated activities
withdirectors from Haverfordand
Bryn Mawr, and facilitated theprogram. According to Mason, its
three main goals are to heighten
students' leadership skills, foster
understanding and awareness of
social and personal differences,
and develop a cross-cultural support system among students of
color who share similar experi-

ences.
The program is offered only
to minority students for several
reasons. First, the absence of white
students gives students of color
more power to voice the racism
and prejudices they face. Second,
it gives a unique opportunity for
students of color to share a week
withthosewhounderstandthe pain
and frustration they feel. Third,
the support of fellow students of
color encourages them to speak
out By realizing that they are not
alone and understanding that they
have similar experiences, students
ofcolor no longer feel intimidated
when expressing their concerns
on a predominantly whitecampus.
FernandoChang-Muy, Assistant Dean and Director of the
Intercultural Center, presided over
a workshop in which he detailed
the history of immigration in the
United States and the current laws
concerning this issue. His workshop on identity was wellreceived
by the students. Chang-Muy said
the sensitivity of thestudents ofall
three colleges made hisfirst experience with the program particu-

larly enjoyable.
The program included small
group discussions in which the
students identified offensive ste,

and were also able to sharepersonal
experiences. The concept of"internal colonialism," in which a society
exploits certain of its members in
order to keep them in a state of
virtual economic and political servitude, was a major part of these
discussions. Students expressed
frustration at the disparity between
government claims of equality and
the economic reality.
An important aspect of the
program was allowing students to
develop theircommunicationskills
and apply them to various forms of
conflict resolution. A game called
"Space Invaders"required the "representatives" of eight "countries"
to negotiate which of those countries should sacrificemoney, people

Students applauded the work
of the deans, student volunteers(including Josh Galban'96, Ayanda

the Conflict Resolution Workshop
equipped them to cope with possible tensions and frictions in the
future. Many students found the
departures from Bryn Mawr to
Swarthmoreand Haverford painful
because of the bonds developed
among students on all three campuses.
In the winter, there will be a
voluntary three-day program of a
similar nature open to all students
from the three colleges. Students
who participate will be expected to
design workshops to raise awareness of various issues on campus.
Citing Swarthmore's recent low
turnout at the winter sessions, Mason encouraged interested students
to grasp this opportunity to learn
about other cultures and issues.

Women's soccer kicks off
with a 9-0 victory

Men's soccer hopes to
capture former
glory of '91
by Joseph Leahy
The 1993S warthmoremen's soccer team
hopes to get back on track this season. Last
season, after two straight NCAA Division 111
tournament appearances, Swat finished with
a disappointing 8-9-1 record. This year's
team has much brighter prospects, however.
According to captain Todd Kim '94, the
graduation of nine senior starters from 1991
was a major factor in last year's mediocrity,
while the loss of only three starting seniors
from the 1992 team might also be a major
factor contributing to this year's success.
"Last year we were starting a lot of
inexperienced players, but this year we've
basically got the full team back," said Kim.
After a slow start, due to new NCAA
rules which limit the length of the preseason,
the team has come on strong in its two scrimmages. In the first, against Wesleyan, the
team tied 1-1. In
the second, the team
beat division one
Villanova.
"It was a big
deal to beat 'nova,"
said forward Len
Cuello '96.
"Yeah," said
Kim, "they're a
good team and they
beat us 7-1 last
year."
A major factor
in the victory over
Villanova was halfback Nathan Fairman '94, who scored both
the team's goals. Halfback and captain Jeff
Nebelsieck '94 and forward Len Cuello '96
assisted Fairman on the goals.
Fairman, who was missed last year when
he tookhis junior year abroad, will be one of
a host of upperclassmen who will contribute
to the team. This year's starters will be
mainly upperclassmen, according to Kim.
Other key seniors are halfbacks Kim,
Nebelsieck and Colin Heydt, sweeper Pete
Jacobs, defender Ashee Bahn, and forward
KenrickCato. Several juniors will also start
for the team, including midfieldersBen Cook
and Jay Rose, forward Krister Johnson, and
defender Jesse Murphy.
This is not to say that there are no
underclass prospects. Kim said that at least
two freshmen are likely to start this year
including marking back Dave Lane and keeper
Sean Bundy, who have been impressive in the
pre-season.
"I'm really excited to be back," Fairman
said.
Fairman thinks this year's team has the

potential to go far—perhaps as well or better
than in recent memory. "I think that this
year's success will hinge on our ability to
tighten up our defense and play up to our
ability in several key games," he said.
Fairman's concern is not somuch thatthe
defense is weaker now than the forward ark
halfback positions; he just thinks that the
"new things in the backfield" that the team is
trying, such as a zone defense, need to be
perfected soon in order for the defense to be
strong for the remainder of the season.
The team's success will dependpartly on
big games against historically strong out-ofstate opponents such as Rowan College and
Trenton State. More important to the possibility of a NCAA bid, however, will be instate opponents such as Dickinson,
Gettysburg, Muhlenberg, and Haverford.
"Muhlenberg andHaverford are the big ones,"
said Nebelsieck, "because we compete for
bids with other Pennsylvania teams."
When askec
for a prediction on
season,
the
Nebelsieck woulc
not comment. "PL
have to wait until
after this weekend.
I don't really want
to make any pre-

"I think that this year's
success will hinge on
our ability to tighten up
our defense and play up
to our ability in several
key games."

Swarthmore's women's soccer team
started its season off with a bang this week,
winning a scrimmageagainst Centenary with
an astounding 9-0margin. Whilemany of us
were eeking out a final week of rest and
relaxation before returning to Swarthmore's
intense atmosphere, our athletic teams were
hard at workrunning and sweating their way
into shape. As far as the women's soccer
team is concerned, the hard work already
appears to be paying off. Lead by Coach
Cheri Goetcheus, Assistant Coach George
Allport, and team captains Dank a Bloomquist
'94, Jennifer Ekert '94, and Miriam Marx
'94, the team is hoping for a strong and
successful season.
Thursday's scrimmage started off with
the usual first-game confusion as players on
both teams scrambledfor theball. Swat players took shot after shot on goal, but were
temporarily stone-walled by Centenary's
goalie. However, Centenary's luck could not
hold. Rachael Johnson '95 scored the first
goal of the game with a strong and wellplaced shot from theleft comer. Fifteen minutes, and many close attempts later, Swat
women scored their second goal off a welltimedpass from Marx to Julie Noyes '95.
Now securely in the lead, a quick peptalk was all that was needed for Swat to go
soaring into the lead. Taking Goetcheus' advice to heart, Swat players worked together

for a beautiful secondhalf. Relaxing enough
to remember the past weeksof drills, the team
passed the ball up the field time and time
again, frustrating and out- playing theiropponents.

The first drive up the field resulted in a
goal by Bess O'Neill '95, and was quickly
followed by a second (and left-footed!) goal
by Johnson. Again gaining possesion of the
ball, Swat deftly passed the ball up the field
once more, where Marx shot the ball over the
heads of four defenders and into the goal,
making the score 5-0. Sarah Guroff '96 had a
fantastic game, scoring the next two goals, the
first a recovered ball from one of several
powerful shots by MadelineFraser '95, and
the second the finish of a cross by Johnson.
Mary Catherine Arbour '95 and Marx scored
the two final goals of the game, bringing the
score to an impressive 9-0.
Although the first few minutes of the
game were a bit frantic, once things settled
down a bit Swat women put together some
beautiful plays. The defense was strong, and
the offense aggressive. Mara Willard '96
and other Swat defenders stopped
Centenary 'soffense time and again, and sent
the ball backup to Swat's offense with consistently we-placed passes.
Coaches and players alike were generally pleased with Thursday's scrimmage,
Goetcheus is looking forward to improving
last year's season record, and was pleased
with how well the team worked together,
especially in the second half of the game.

playing much better."
"We'd like to think we can [match that
record.]. We've got more depth than we had
last year," said Kentwell.
This depth comes in the form of new
first-year student like Lia Ernst and Kelly
Wilcox. "They've beenreally outstanding in
the preseason," saidKentwell. Additionally,
the team has more experienced goalies than it
did last year.
Swarthmorealso has a numberofreturning players, like top scorer Melissa Bonder
'95. "She scored 18 goals off us last year.
She'll have more support up front that she
didn't have last year," saidKentwell.
Winger Becky Bush '96 sums up the
team's overall feeling, "We're all a lot more
confident."
Swarthmore's first game will be home
September 9 against Kings.

The Swarthmore women's field hockey
team heads intothe 1993 season with hope as
they enter a new conference
"It's going to be an exciting year. We

have a lot of new players and a new conference. It's quite a challenge," said Coach
Richard Kentwell.
Returning senior sweeper Jane Grabbias
echoes this sentiment, "It's going to be a lot
moredifficult. It's going to be a much tougher
schedule." Swarthmore is moving into the
Centennial Conference which Kentwell describes as "probably the strongest league in
Division UJ. We probably lost 3 or 4 of our
weaker opponents."
Last year's team went 9-9. Grabbias
says, "We're in good shape. I think we'll be
