President Bill Clinton will
speak at Swarthmore on April 19.

I

!

Although his staff will not yet divulge what the topic of the
President's speech will be, they
hinted thathe would take advantage
0f Swarthmore's liberal environment to announce one of his more
progressive policy initiatives.
The plan to bring the president
tocampus was hatchedlastNovember, shortly after theelection. In his
attempt to bring more influential
and famous speakers to campus,
Swarthmore'sPresident, Al Bloom,
called the President-elect' s office to
see if an appearance could be arranged.
When his announcement of a
national service corps received a
lukewarm reception at Rutgers University, Clinton's stafffinalized the
plans for his visit to Swarthmore.
President Bloom was unavailable for comment, but Dean Ngina
[Lythcott said she was "ecstatic"
about Clinton's plans to speak atthe
college. "It will be so exciting to
have the President speak here, but
it'smore than that," she said, "President Clinton is also an academic, so
he is dedicated to the same issues
we're trying to address here."

speakers be professors who are only
known by the colleagues. "Swarthmore is ideally located for people
on the speaker circuit," said
Lythcott. "We're close enough to
Washington that a visithere doesn't
eat up as much time," she added.
President Bloom had planned
to announce Clinton's visit next

week in the same wayhe informed
the campus about Cosby's visit.
However, when Bloom's office
wouldnot confirm or deny thevisit,
The PkoetuxconTiimed it with White
House Communications Director
George Stephanopoulos.
According to Stephanopoulos,
"The president is still considering

several topics, whichincludehealth
care, the future of the Supreme
Court, and the NorthAmericanFree

Trade Agreement." He said Clinton
will announce the topic ofhis speech
a week in advance.
As president, Clinton is making a concerted effort to stroke the
feathers he ruffled as a candidate.

Many students here were disappointed that candidate Clinton did
not make any campaign stops here
last fall, but instead sent both of
Hillary Rodham Clinton's brothers
to address Swarthmore's faithfulliberal contingent.
Although Stephanopoulos did
not mention it as a possible subject,
Clinton might take advantage ofhis
time speaking at a College founded
by Quakers to make a speech addressing the future of U.S. peace
initiatives. White House officials
refused to comment on this topic.
In preparation for the
President's visit, Secret Service officers will have to work diligently to
ensure the Clinton's security while
he is on campus. If he were to speak
in the amphitheater as Cosby did, "it
wouldbe a challenge," said a White
House official. Public Safety Officers said they will be working in with
both the borough police and the
Secret Service to make S warthmore
secure for thePresident. Because of
security reasons, they might elect to
have Clinton speak in the PAC.
Although the speech will be
aimed at Swarthmore students, it
will be open to the public. Lythcott
said they have not yet decided how
they will allow in members of the
college community who want to attend while providing seats for the
general public.

more than it has in past years.
"The committee is at a stage in its work

on the cutting edge of gay and lesbian studies," said Breitenberg.
Next year the Lang Professor for Social

drama theorist and critic who will teach for
the entire year. The Committee is moving
toward the creation of more courses in the
hopes of someday creating a concentration in
gay and lesbian studies. "Swarthmore is a
college with a multcultural curriculum that is
linked to the rest of this country by a set of
political and social concerns, among which
are gay and lesbian issues. The symposium
will further the creation of gay and lesbian
studiesby making the college moreaware and
more knowledgeable about the issues that are
at stakeand about thereasons why they are so
important," said Breitenberg.
The Sager Symposium is open to the
entire college community and will take place
mostly in the PAC. All members of the
community are also welcome to attend the
party at 10p.m. on Saturday night (location to
be announced).

Peace Mission Participants Report on their Discoveries in L.A.
Trip focuses on police, media, and education
by GARY ZINS
Students from Swarthmore, Haverford and Bryn Mawr
Colleges reported Monday on their research trip to Los
Angeles in a discussion entitled "Los Angeles '92 and Beyond: the Unauthorized Biography of a City." The program
was meantto "take the students out of the classroom and into
thefield" to study the causes ofthe April 1992L. A. riots and
current rehabilitation efforts. The three main speakers were
Swarthmore students who focused on issues of media, law
enforcement, education, and individualreaction to the events
in Los Angeles.
CliffLee '93 described the media and law enforcement
inL. A. before the riots. "The media was no longer objective
about the issues at hand and leadership failed because it
became tribalizecL.they were just seeking their own interests," he said. It was primarily these two factors that heightened tensions in L.A. Prejudices against women, gays and
lesbians, and minorities existed within the Los Angeles
Police Department, he said. In addition, officers rarely ran
footpatrols, choosing instead to stay in theirpatrol cars. They
had "a cowboy attitude," notedLee.
According to Lee, the police now understand that they
need to take a more active role in the communities. Willie
Williams, the current L.A.P.D. police chief who replaced
Daryl Gates, recognizes that there needs to be more "human
relations training and cultural sensitivity training," Lee said.
In addition"there is a needfor more people ofcolor withinthe
police department...especially those who can speak a second
language." This would help to prevent wrongful arrests.
The L.A.P.D. has already taken steps to combat future
riots. In January, the police commission voted unanimously
to ask the L.A. City Council for $ 1 millionworthofriot gear,
including rubber bullets, tear gas, television monitors,
bullhorns, and more officers, he said. There has also been
"extensiveriot control training" and organization of "tactical

Student Council Plans Party Weekend
New student center, dorms discussed

by MARK KERNIGHAN
OnSunday, March 28, Student Council

met to discuss student-faculty interaction, a
new student center, dorm security, parties,
two group charters, Worthstock weekend,
and topics for the next Collection.

fiscal crisis? "LEARN has actually managed to come up with
$3 millionfrom private sources to start off the project," she
said. The bigger problem is that "the public expects change so
quickly."
MaeghanMaloney '93 focused on the students' response
to the changes in L. A. She said that one of the city's proposals
is to desegregate the schools in south-centralLos Angeles by
busing students to other schools. But some students "felt that
they were being bussed into neighborhoods where they were
not welcomed." She added that because the students were so
farfrom theirhomes, theirparents had very little opportunity
to become involved in their education.
Maloney spoke with some students in south-central L.A.
who are members of gangs. She talked to one gang member
named Juan who gave her "acompletely different perspective
on gangs than I've ever read in the newspaper." Juan was a
senior in high school, a straight "A" student, who really
wanted to get a job, but because he was involved in a gang,
nobody would hire him. The gang gave him "comfort" and
"security" that he couldn't find at home.
The FAME [First African Methodist Episcopal Church]
program was initiated to help students like Juanfind jobs,
according to Maloney. They say, "let us be your gang."
Gilbert Romero, a former gang member, is the pastor of
anotherchurch.He has formed a rock band whichplays in the
surrounding communities. He invites gang members to come
the concerts and while they are there, he tells them of his
experiences in the gangs and says, "thereis another way, there
is something else you can do with your life," explained
Maloney. Romero invites gang members to come to the
church whenever they need food or emotional support.
In the question and answer session that followed the
presentations, thestudents were asked to give their impression
of the project They said that the first-hand experience was an
indispensable part of their learning about social issues. They
felt that theknowledge they gained in school could in many
cases be directly applied to the real world. They noted that
"students can also gain experienceby working insurrounding
communities." The program in Chester is one example.
Lisa Atkins, a Bryn Mawr student who participated in
program, said that although there is little difference she can
make as a student, the experience has given her insight she can
use when she is in the workforce. "Eachof uswere developing
ways of thinking in order to make a difference in our careers,"
she said
President Bloom called this project "absolutely compelling," saying that it makes us understand "why it is that we
would be involved in the analytic world" here at Swarthmore,
He said the way that the program was structured, in looking
not only at the events in L.A. through individual and group
perspectives, but also at the larger issues ofracial tensions and
ethnic identity, this program is "the ultimate exhibit...of a
liberal arts education."

John Hearn '93 said that the Student
Pressures Task Force is designing ways to
improve student-faculty interaction. One of
the mainobstacles isfaculty pressure. Hearn
said that the current "publish or perish" attitude is "more typical of a research university" and, along with committee work, "fills
the typical faculty member's time fully."
Some professors work from 9 to 5 on com4
mittees on certain days. Rohit Malhotra 95
added that some professors are upset at being
almost randomly assigned to committees.
One idea, according to Jenny Ann Diamond '94, is a social center on North Campus
(near Pearson), open all night to both students and faculty. Hearnbelieves thatTarble
is not enough, but "there are a few people in
the administration who think we [already]
have a student center."
According to CIVIC director Serge
Francois '9l, the administration's current
plan isfor the Deans to hire one person to run
both the social center and the Intercultural
Center. Many members objected. "It's impossible to do both effectively because the
demands are so different," said Kari Hong
'94.
The new student center was suggested
as a topic for the next Collection, but Dia-

mond said that the students might take three
minutes to decide "yes, we need one," and
spend theremaining few hours justcomplaining about Swarthmore'sdim sociallife. Tanya
Byker '94 pressed for more controversial
topics and suggested that the CRC would be
a more natural place for Collection than the
Friends' Meeting House.
Hong mentioned dorm security, especially in Parrish. Diamond questioned the
effectiveness of using the desk sitter, who
usually sees only one door at a time, as an
"extensionofcampus security."Hongpointed

relatively early (midnight) may paradoxically
clear the way for trespassers, since students
prop open the door for non-residents. (Only
Parrish residents can unlock a Parrish door,
and even then, only the front door in some
cases.)
The party policy has gotten tougher since
high school kids from the Ville have crashed
parties. "Ridiculous things have happened,"
said Byker. According to Malhotra, future
parties may require a tri-college ID. Impromptu party permits are also nearly impossible to obtain without warning. Sampriti
Ganguli '95 said that the requirements for
parties (advertising, card checking, permits)
place a burden on the administration in case
someone disobeys, but also "make people
who want to throw parties thinkthree or four
times before doing it" Malhotra said that he
had been asked to charter a group that sponsored non-alcoholic parties. "Who's stopping
them?" said Byker, and many people con-

curred.
Student Council heard a charter proposal for DESHI, a South Asian group, from
Praful Saklani '95. DESHI was unanimously
chartered in minutes. It will be budgeted
through SAO, but its activities, according to
Saklani, will be more cultural and less political.
Student Council also unanimously chartered ASORA, a group for sexuality awareness and gay rights, which is open to everyone and developing fast. Diamond said that
ASORA was a good illustrationof the different needs of support groups (such as theLBG
Alliance) and political action groups.
Jerry Kamas '96 brought up the perennial problem of library hours. He called 20
colleges and couldn't find one whose libraries closed as early as ours.
The meeting ended with a long wrang) e
over scheduling ofthe last weekend in Apnl
and the solution is still unclear. Earlier, Student Council had decided to use $lO,<W
from President Bloom's Discretionary Fund
to set up a carnival on April 24-25, the same
weekend as Worthstock, several sportsevents
and
on Saturday involving over 100students,
a Washington gay rights march on Sunday
involving 70 students. Ganguli spoke up i*

Civil Liberties Society to
Focus on Rights of Disabled
byMARIA BARKER and ADAM
BLAKELY
This April, the Swarthmore
Civil Liberties Society is sponsoring Rights of the Disabled Month.
TheS warthmore staffmemberwho
deals most closely with theissues of
students withdisabilities is Patricia
Whitman.
PatriciaWhitman hasbeen the
Equal Opportunity Officer for 12
years and her jobhas involvedmaking sure that all students at Swarthmore get the same shot at an education. Although she has been working with the issues of student with
disabilities, she says that her added
position as CoordinatorforServices
for Disabled Students has only come
into being this semester. According
to Whitman, this was important
"both to give support to those students who need it and also to say
something to the community, as a
sign that the community is interested and cares."
Recent legislation has given
incentive to institutions all over the
country to take action to honor the
rights ofthosewithdisabilities. The
Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) is a revolutionary piece of
legislation that was passed a couple
of years ago. The act makes demands on public institutions which
will allow the fullest possible participation ofdisabledindividuals in
public activities.
Whitman saidthat in her twelve
yearshere, shehasnot seen a Swarthmore studentwho was confined to a
wheelchair. Practically speaking,
students with such physical disabilities that impede movement would
not be attracted to Swarthmore because the campus is inaccessible to
people boundto such alternateforms
of transportation. Whether or not
such activities as The Phoenix and
WSRN, which are both located on
the highly inaccessible fifthfloorof
Parrish, are going to have to be
moved to another location in order
to allow studentswithdisabilitiesto
exercise the right to participate in
these has yet to be decided.
On the whole, the administration has beenresponsive to theneeds
of disabled students which have
arisen, oftenwith a bit of help from
"hitman. In one case, a woman
who was a student at Swarthmore
had loupes, a degenerative disease.
In this person's case it was important that she have no sun exposure.
She had been placed in a very sunny
dorm room which was a hazard to
her health. The Assistant Dean in

chargeof housing, TeddGoundie's
predecessor, needed some "encouragement" from Whitman to move
her to a more shaded room. Although this particular instance required some effort, overall
Whitmanhas been pleased withthe
cooperation which she hasreceived
from the administration.
Whitman brings a special perspective to her work because she
has a seizure disorder. This causes
her to focus, in part, on invisible
disabilities, such as epilepsy, heart
conditions, asthma, and others. This
focus is appropriate to Swarthmore
because of her belief that there are
more people at Swarthmore with
these types ofdisabilities. "I would
like to see us do more about students with disabilities...because I
think that they are so much more
prevalent. I would love to know
how many diabetics we have on
this campus, how many people
people with cancer in their
backgrounds...how many people
with heartconditions. All of these
things critically change your life."
She believes that invisible disabilities are something that we need to
deal with more, perhaps by working with the Health Center to promote awareness, or by forming a
support group.
Whitman sees her position as
being primarily concerned with
support and empowerment of disabled students. "One of the real
frustrations that I had this semester
was that I put out a notice asking
students with disabilities of any
kind to come forward because I
wanted to form a support group. I
explained that I suffer an intractable seizure disorder and I would
help facilitate the group and I got
one person [to respond]... I know
there are students out there who are
suffering from disabilities that are
invisible." The support group did
not work out due to lack ofinterest,
andWhitmanfeels that this, inpart,
demonstrates the difficulty of talking about this issue on campus.
As the ADA is implemented
at Swarthmore, Whitman looksforward to meeting the challenges it
will present "I have always looked
upon my seizure disorder as an
opportunity toeducate...Tome, the
ability to show students that you
can have dignity in the face of
adversity is thebest lesson, thebest
gift I could give, and itis one of die
things I am most proud 0f... I think
that's what most disabled people
seek."

Starving Student's Travel Guide
by JANET SINGLETON
CollegePress Service
Can a college student experience all the glamour and excitement of Europe without having to
sleep on park benches? There are
many ways to do it without resorting to slumming, from standing up
when you eat to taking trains at
night to befriending farmers, travel
experts say.
Traveling in theoff-season is
an effective money-saving tactic.
"This is a low travel time, so airlines extend sales. All of the traditionalholidays are more expensive
because there's moredemand," said
Peggy Mahoney, spokeswoman for
Continental Airlines.
But for students who won't be
unleashed from school until May,
bargains can still befound. In most
of Europe, peak season begins
around May 23, said Will Cornell
of American Youth Hostels. Even
then, he added, it's possible to vacation on a shoestring.
"Housing isn't expensive unless you're going to spend a lot of
time in the big cities," Cornell said.
High season in Italy doesn't
start until June, said Mary Kay
Hartley of the Italian Tourism
Board. Lodging will be cheaper
until then, and food is always
cheaper if you eat it standing up.
Hartley advises budget-conscious students to dine at the little
bakeries and cafes that dot Italian
cities. They often have tables, but
"when you sit down they charge
more," she explained.
Both Rail Europe and British
Rail have special year-round rates
for travelers under 25. With a Rail
Europepass,you can travel by train
through 17 countries. British Rail
makes stops in cities throughout
the United Kingdom. A Rail Europe "YouthFlexipass"ranges from
$220, for five days of travel in a
two-month period, to $698 for two
months ofconsecutive travel. BritishRail YouthPasses begin at $ 155
for any four days in an eight-day
period, to $309 for any 15 days in
two months.
"European countries are very
close to one another," said Claude
MonteofRail Europe. "So the train
is the mainmode of transportation.
You can go from one country to
another in five hours."
American visitors should also
consider traveling through smaller
towns, rather than spending all of
their timein the major cities. Spending time in out-of-the-way towns
also is more fun because travelers

College Needs to Pay More
Attention to Student Issues
by ETHAN S. BORG

It appears as if the bubble of impunity in
which the leaders of the Kremlin on the Crum
rode high for so many years has finally burst
with a revelation that things simply are not as
wonderful as they appear; and this is good.
Finally, we, the students, are being recognized
as important players in the continuedlife of this
institution, we are not simply thepeons and the
pawns; rather, the greater problems facing us
daily are being looked at, stared down, and
analyzed. Frankly, thatis allanyone could have
asked for. It is a large step for this college. ..or so
it seems.
I commend the hiring of a studentcoordinator. I commend the donationof extra fundsfor
student use in totally non-academic areas. It is
exciting to have something to look forward to
next April, in the formof a Worths tock carnival.
Student life has become an important focus of
this campus, and it will make this schoolpowerful and exciting...that is if important steps are
taken that are not simply superficial, but bare
down on the malformed bones spreading pain
throughout the disease-racked body.
I can only hope that the administration
makes a point of emphasizing that the problems
facing the studentbody are not simply "your [the
students'] problem", but are rooted in something that touches every member ofthis institution. For too many years, important figures in
this school have raised their shoulders, sighed,
and said meekly, "What can I tell you, it's your
problem." Far too many years. To not make that
realization, to not put a finger on the overall
malaise, but instead totreat the symptoms would
be to take a step forward then two leaps back.
These positive acts must be serious, not
symbolic, and not one-time-only events. Whatever hope is raised, whatever cures are administered, must come hand in hand with structured
therapy. If we are fed only air, we will starve.
Likewise, if theadministration is willing to
take those vital steps, then they must not end
their analysis prematurely. If a building is fall-

ing, it is not simply one wall thatneeds repair, it

is theentireinterior structure that must be aligned
properly once again from the ground up.
Even if we make certain aspects oflifehere
user-friendly, such as the decayed social lifeand
the totally dissolved community, even if we can
reverse the damagesalready done,we mustnot stop
there and think that students here have it easy.
For instance, haveyou seen what thebasements look like, where students will beforced to
live with an increase in enrollment. They are
dark, morose caves, isolated and smelly. I get
depressed simply doing my laundry in their
bowels. And this school would send students
down there without a two-thirds majority override (which would no doubtbe the case).
I am not asking that this school build new
housing, which of course would be preferred.
No, what I am asking is that the school set up a
community meeting where the administration
can tell the students face to face that we cannot
afford such a measure...if that is so...whichis of
course doubtful if we have the funds to rebuild
an academic building. But don't you see, there is
a pitiful double-standard here; and it is telling
students: "Heh! Only academics. Onlyacademics.We'll makeyou live in the darkest, smelliest
hell hole, just to make our professors happy."
And that is unfair. It is unfairbecause we made
a deal wherein we would give you our last
pennies suchthatyou may improve our lives and
let us grow. Growth does not simply involve the
dirt, the minerals, and the cold water, but involves a certain amount of sunshine too. Students will not get that in the basement. Instead,
this will only increase their natural troglodytic
tendencies.

A certain amount of attention must go
towards unraveling thered tape that mummifies
us, and gluesus to the walls. If you advertise that
you will treat us with respect, and allow us to
pursue our vaguest interests, thenyou must meet
that pledge. Special majors should not be like
plunging into the jaws of the hungry beasts, nor
should be traveling abroad, nor shouldbe majoring early. Financial aid should not be a crap-

A Different Kind ofDiversity
In my conservation biology class, we
often talk about things like biodiversity and
monocultures. Just so you know, a monoculture is an area or region that is dominated by
one major species type. In a monoculture, the
environment is friendliest for one specific
organism type, enabling it to thrive and grow,
while competing organisms, which find the
environment to be less favorable, are stifled
and kept from maturingproperly and contributing to the overall community.
Ecologists and conservation biologists
generally view monocultures in a negative
light, preferring the situation created when
biodiversity occurs. It has been conclusively
proven that when a diverse range of species
inhabit an area, this results in a friendlier
community, one where all organisms contribute to the community and to one another
creating therichest possible environment. In
monocultures, however, thedominantorganism might thrive for a while, but the lack of
species richness and diversity will soon catch
up with the community, making it unlivable
and cutting it offfrom the rest of the environ—

but they are anything but firmly established
A niche, after all, cannot survive without
members to inhabit it
If S warthmore is to achieve full political
diversity, it will have to be done, at least to
some degree, through theadmissionsprocess.
This can be done by making political diversity an admissions standard, through active
recruiting of students with diverse political
backgrounds, or simply by examining the
image that Swarthmore gives its prospective
students.
While "making political diversity an admissions standard" might sound like a sugarcoated phrase meaning "conservative quotas," I assure you it is not. In the same way that
the admissions office looks for applicants
from a wide geographic base— this is not a
quota, mindyou, simply an effort to establish
a geographically diverse class— they can
apply this method to political ideologies as
well.
The Dean of Admissions, Robert Barr,
reacted negatively to this idea, however, citing a reluctance to "go hunting for certain
political views." Whilehe agreed withBloom
thatthe current political atmosphere atS warthmore is "a serious problem," one that Barr
characterized as "knee-jerk liberal," he felt
that attempting to target admissions to students with non-liberal ideologies was "not a

Why is John Tired? Organizers Rally Students for Incinerator March
by

JOHN CONNOR

To the Swarthmore College Community,

I'm Tired. I'm really truly down deep tired. Maybe it is
because I have not had much sleep lately because I had way too
many lab write-ups dueat once,but I doubtit My tiredgoes much
beyond that initialpain; and I am, torepeat myself, tired of it. If
it were just the lack of sleep I would get over it This tired has
lasted the entire semester; through my finding a job for the
summer, through the luck of being offered an RA position,
through the fact that the woman I am in love with kissed me.
I am tired because I have heard too much bitching and
whining from everyone on this campus that I know, including
myself. This realization was brought to a head when I saw the
signs up in Sharpies. 1,000bowls, 3,000 spoons. And we all
complain about the food being bad? I think it is time for this
campus torethink its values. Too many of us take being catered
to for granted, and a lot of us I guess are used to getting exactly
what they want, regardless of what we do. But considering the
fact that the campus as a whole seems to be full of a bunch of
kleptos (who really needs a cereal dispenser?), maybe there is a
reason we get food that is bad, and thatis we deserveit Hell, if
I were running Sharpies, I think I wouldprobably serve pasta for
three meals a day untilI didn't have to keep buying more bowls.
Do me a favor, do the rest of the campus a favor. Realize that
we here at Swarthmore are a small community. In fact, we are
potentially one of the richest small communities in the nation.
Not only are we diverse, we have die largest endowmentof any
small private college. Much of your happiness is tied up in how
that money is spent Right now it seems to be being spent on
bowls and little signs to alert us to our progress on petty thievery
101. Take notice of this tiny world around you and realize how
you can makeit workfor you, how muchyou are letting pass you
by whenyou are sitting on your ass bitching about howbad life
is and how awful the food is. If you want better food, don't steal
the bowls, make the college give Sharpies more money, and
realize mat you (us) as a community can run this campus if we get
off our butts.

As you may have read in last week's article regarding the
everything that we throw into a trashcan is
trucked by 18-wheelrigs through aresidenual sectionofChester
to be burned within a couple hundred yards of houses. The
incinerator facility has destroyed the surrounding neighborhood through thetruck noise, thecontinual ash residue, thetoxic
fumes released, and the rats thatthe trashpromotes.
A group of citizens living near the incinerator, Chester
Residents for Quality Living, is planning a rally for thisMonday
to generate awareness for the crime our county is committing
and to demand change from Westinghouse, Delaware County,
and the City ofChester. The rally will begin at 9:00a.m. at the
County Courthouse Annex, followed by amarch to Chester and
ultimately the incinerator.
Rally organizers are planning a peaceful protest at the
incinerator to hopefully keep it closed for a day. The County
government has been using the incinerator to help balance their
budgets at an unacceptable cost to both people and the environment, so broadsupport from around thecounty mustbe gathered
on Monday to tell the officials that the current solid waste
management practices are unacceptable. Information about
participating in the rally will be distributed from Sharpies all
weefc
Dr. Horace Strand, thechairman of CRQL, says the rally
will not only beabout the incinerator, but about the "death of
Chester" thathasbeen taking place as the rest ofthe county has
grown and prospered. It is clear that the incinerator was cited
in the neighborhood because the county and Westinghouse
thought the residents, generally a poor minority with many
senior citizens, would give little opposition. Let's help CRQL
show mem they were wrong.
The state Department ofEnvironmental Resources has just
fined Westinghouse over $lOO,OOO for emissions violations in
July, August, and September of last year, which was the first
county incinerator,

monitoring period. I am skeptical that emissions before or after
that period would be any better. The incinerator's operating
permits are still not finalized because Westinghouse has failed
to implement a household hazardous waste retrieval program to
keep deadly toxins out of the plant.
Not only has theplant destroyed the character of a neighborhood and threatened the air-quality of the region, it has
undermined therecycling programs throughout the county. The
county signed a 25-year contract with Westinghouse to provide
a given volume of trash, a volume that can only be reached with
theburning of paper. By not recycling the large volume ofpaper
generated in our society, we are hastening the destructionof the
world's forests.

Admittedly, Westinghouse, the City of Chester, and
Deleware County are making moneyoffof the project, but is the
cost acceptable? Gather with us Monday to demand a move
away from financially based politics towards one based on
justice. Now more than ever, reduce, reuse, recycle.
A group of Swarthmore students has been working independently and in conjuction with CRQL to address someof these
issues. If you wouldlike to help, or get more information, please

that an American audience would
not respond positively if it happened
to be presented with an unfamiliar

culture.

The beginning of the movie
doesn't bode well. In the opening
number, called Arabian Nights, the
peddlar who introduces the story
(and incidentally, does not reappear
at the end of the film) tells us that
he's going home to thefictional city
of Agraba where, "They'll cut off
your ears if they don't like your
face/ It's barbaric, but hey, it's
home." Less than five minutes into
the movie it has presented us with
two prevalent misconceptions of
Arabs and Arab society. The first,
and most obvious, is that Arabs are
barbaric people with barbaric, cruel
rules and customs. The second is
that Arabs are fatalistic by nature,
and will accept despotism without
question. The former aspect reappears later in themovie in a scene in
which palace guards chase Aladdin,
attempting to chop offhis hand for

stealing a loafof bread.
Another way in which Aladdin
offers negative images of Arabs is
by associating a Semitic appearance with an evil nature. The only
character in themovie with stereotypical Arab features—hooked
nose, dark ('swarthy') skin—is the
villain. Admittedly, not all Arabs
look like that, but those features are
commonly thought of as Arab. On
theotherhand, thehero and heroine
of the movie, Aladdin and Princess
Jasmine, looklike any otherDisney
couple, only with a slight tan and
darker hair.
I don't mean to trash Aladdin
entirely. It is a very entertaining
film, and quite ingenious in parts,
especially in the character of the
Genie. Robin Williams has provided his voice, and the Disney
animatorshave given him amazing
shape-shifting abilities. He mimics
almostevery iconofAmerican pop
culture imaginable. His part in the
movie shows the comic genius of

all those involved in creating him,

using that as a reason to excuse
Disney for the false images it has
presented in the movie.
In terms of offensiveness
Aladdin certainly does not come
close to manyother movies portraying Arabs that Hollywood has
churned out Aladdin is an enjoyable, benign film. But because ofits
popularity and appeal, especially to
children, it is very important that we
realize its flaws and keep them in
mind while viewing thismovie. In
the future, Arab-Americans will
hopefully be able to find positive
images ofArabs in American movies, not merely the terrorist, the oilsheik, the religious fanatic and variations thereof.

O.K. Chesterton
—

by MOHAN AMBIK AIPAKER
Two weeks ago. Read Mercer Schuchardt
wrote an op-ed article entitled 'Tolerant Re-

gime has No Roomfor Orthodoxy."Those of us
who painstakingly mine The Phoenix in search
of interesting articles are quite familiar with
Read's provocative pieces. Like many of his
previous works, this was consistent with that
world-view at Swarthmore, which condemns
theschool for its 'ill-liberal' education. Coming
from a country where the freedom to exercise
one's intellectual beliefs and political convictions carries more punitive consequences than
or
peer pressure
representational
marginalization, I find the lament misplaced.
But irrespective of its privileged lack of perspective, there are more serious problems with
Read's diagnosis of the sins of Swarthmore. It
necessitates a response, and I have drawn on
both my reflections and secondary sources.
Read's main critique of Swarthmore centers on the injury done to his personal religious
beliefs whenbiology classes at Swarthmore fail
to include Christian creation science and when
'orthodox' interpretations ofreligious faith are
left out in religion courses. Furthermore Read
complains that certainintellectual exercises like
deconstructionivist linguistics undermine his
deep-seated beliefs. All this is tantamount to
"nothing less than religious discrimination."
My main problem withRead's articleis not
that it's radical, but rather that it's not radical
enough Why stop at biology or religion? Surely
the logic must extend to sociology, history,
political science, mathematics, astronomy, etc.
Surely not studying urban problems with a faith
informedperspective is unfair.Surely looking at
third worldpoverty without recourse to biblical
references is prejudicial. Why limit faith to
biology and religion departments? And if it is a
questions of rights, why just stop at Christian
beliefs? Coming from a Hindu family and living
in a predominantly Muslim society, I surely
have the equal right to demand Hindu and Muslim creation stories be taught at Swarthmore.
Otherwise the credo that Swarthmore does not
discriminate on the basis of national origin is
sheer hypocrisy, isn't it?
Perhaps when faced with the task of accommodating too many world-views, the college prudently went the way of not wanting to
impose parochial views on its students. Given
themultitude offaiths thatthere are in the world,
how does one go aboutrepresenting all of them?
Or do we leave it to the so-called dominant
religion to holdsway? Yetreligious'orthodoxy'
of the kind Read professes only accounts for
23% of the American population, so do we
resort to a banking notion of education, where
ideas are taught according to their statistical
weight? Does that mean thenthat iftheKu Klux
Klan commands say 5% of the population's
loyalty it ought to be given a 5% allocation in the
college's canon? Just think of how the core

curriculum would look like inLouisiana, where
more than a third of the voters supported David
Duke.
But preoccupation at the level of rights to
free speech is to lose sight of a very important
distinctionbetween ideas that are toleratedand
ideas that are respected. Aspolitical philosopher
Amy Gutman put it:
'Toleration extends to a widest range of
views, so long as they stop short of threats and
other direct and discernible harms to individuals. Respect is far more discriminating. Although we need not agree with a position to
respect it, we must understand it as reflecting a
moral point of view.. .A multicultural society is
bound to include a wide range of such respectable moral disagreements, which offers us the
opportunity to defend our views before morally
serious people with whom we disagree and
thereby learn from our differences. .
Undeserving ofrespect are views thatflagrantly
disregard theinterests ofothers and therefore do
not take a genuine moral position at a 11...
In my opinion, I believe that Read is a
morally serious person, who has conservative
views, which I don't share. Unlike racist, antisemitic, misogynistic views, whichI don't have
to tolerate, much less advocate theirplace in the
curriculum, Read's attempt at addressing major
quandaries faced by our society deserves respect Chiefamong the problems are the loss of
identity and community, nihilistic relativism,
consumerism, and permissiveness. The demoralization of modern lifeis a phenomenon occurring anywhere modernization is taking place,
and religious 'orthodox' responses can befound
in the form ofrevivalist Protestant Christianity
in the U.S to Hindu and Muslim fundamentalism happening at home inMalaysia. I was constantly amazed at the similarity betweenRead's
concerns and fundamentalMuslim criesfor scriptural based education. The religious 'orthodox'
position, of whatever persuasion, aims atrestor.

ing a moral context so that human beings may
live a life filled not just with self-serving ends,

but a life livedwith responsibility, and the sense

of belonging

to a community.

Despite my respect for the merits of his
quest, however, I find Read's position, as well
as most fundamentalist positions, to be flawed.

For one thing, the fundamentalist movement
conveniently uses the avenues provided by a
liberal and plural political setting to air their
views and advocate their position, yet their
beliefin thesupremeandabsoluterighteousness
of theirfaith does not allow for inclusiveness of
any other moral world-view. The tolerance and
respect accorded to them does not find reciprocation in mutual respect for other moral positions; at most, they grudgingly tolerate differing
moral constructs.The true challenge of our time
to is to find a way to create a humane society,
whichdoes not simply advocate theblind denial
of moral diversity, that profoundly exists both
within and without national boundaries. We

have to find a way to create a society that
acknowledges the diversity and creates a community at the same time. We no longer live in
isolated, homogeneous communities, where everyone can be united by a shared overriding
vision.To quote Czech playwright Vaclav Havel,
any moral resolution "must have an element of
universality about it. In other words, it is not
something partially accessible to only a restricted
community, and not transferable to any other."
Instead, they engage in highly zealous and
sophisticated means ofevangelicalism, to propagate their views. Drawing on financial and structural advantages, fundamentalist movements are
better organized to gain an audience for their
views. Italso helps to have highly motivated and
charismatic leaders who constantly use the media to gain popularity. In some cases the financial advantage is put to unscrupulous use. For
example, the Jerry Falwell group in the U.S.
funds an urban terrorist organization calledthe
Christian Crusaders in the Philippines, which
eliminates socialist and communist leaders.
Russian aid is given on condition of religious
conversion and so on. Attacks on non-Christian
religions are also sustained by using Christian
theological concepts, which are highly difficult
to counter. For example, I repeatedly face the
question of whether I believe in God or not. But
the Hindu tradition does not have a personalized
God, and so how am I to answer? To say no
reflects nothing of the complexity of concepts
like Brahman and nirvana, which do not have
analogous equivalents in the Judeo-Christian
tradition. But does that diminish my spiritual
claims? Most people when faced with unfair
questions like this cannot summon the necessary articulation to express their indigenous
moral views.Their position is constantly diminished and trivialized.Last year, a fundamentalist preaching at the Quaker meeting house challenged the audience tonote how only theChristians were doing good in the world, and he
mockingly suggested we read the Quran to see
how inferior this text, and I suppose by extension, Moslems were.
If this is the tenor of the fundamentalist or

'orthodox' position, how is it to be incorporated
into any discipline? For most disciplines, it
wouldn't even serve a useful purpose. Fundamentalism is very unorthodox in the sense thatit
demands modernscientificcollaborationfor its
views. Hence, creation stories need to be validated by scientific experimental proof. Traditional Christianity never required such
'scientism.' As religious historian Rollo May
notes, "it didn'tmatter in the slightest whether a
man named Adamand a woman named Eve ever
actually existed; the myth about them in the
Genesis still presented a picture of the birth
development of the human consciousness that
was applicable to all people of all ages and
religions." In 12 years of schooling in an IrishCatholic school, withouta single attempt at con-

version, I heartily concur. Though I may not
share the foundational claims of Christianity,
thereligion and its virtues play an important part
in my life. However, I suspect a fundamentalist
infusedcurriculum will not allow thelatitudefor
mutual respect and morally serious (not whimsical or emotivist) choices. Imagine studying
anthropology with regular injections of creedal
injunctions. Whatcan we meaningfully say about
differing cultures ifwe only look at themthrough
our own lenses, and fail to try to see them from
their point of view, on their own terms?
Of course it might be said that I've not
given this same empathy to thefundamentalists.
Yes, I deny them moral adherence, because I
find theirposition morally flawed. Yet, as I've
said, I do acknowledge the legitimacy of their
concerns. As for the problem of educational
policy, I also believe the fundamentalist challenge has identified a crucial lack within the
teaching ofreligion. As historianßruceLawrence
pointed out, "Fundamentalists, in challenging
secular society, also call into question the adequacy of the secular study of religion. Social
scientists have repeatedly failed to take account
of the autonomous nature of the religious impulse." In turn, the fundamentalists cannot ignore moral diversity and the challenge ofengaging in inter-moral dialogue. As St. Teresa once
toldher nuns: "There is no reason why we should
want everyone else to follow our own path."
Fundamentalismis not going to go away no
matter how much we wish otherwise. Ignoring
the approaches for discourse is another mistake,
and here I find it disappointing that no professor
in thereligion or biology departmentresponded
to Read's article. Fundamentalism does make
some challenges to modern life and modem
scholarship. But given its predisposition to tautological or "totalizing" claims and unfair tactics, it must be engaged. In the recent presidential elections, a spokesperson for the fundamentalistChristianCoalition lobbying group charged
that"the elections will be the unionboiler rooms
and the black churches versus the evangelicals.
(New YorkTimes: November 2,1992). In the
interests of peace and harmony, which religions
should not be anathema to, fundamentalists
should take a critical look at themselves and
..

religious scholars should take note. The rest of

also could do better to understand the phenomenon.
As for Mr.Schuchardt and me, I hope I have
made my disagreements persuasive and clear,
rather than in the insulting style of the "Bitches
from Hell." Read and I share much common
ground and interests, including a fondness for
the writer G.K. Chesterton. But Chesterton's
attack on the "tyranny of emptiness" in modem
life was not shaped by scriptural fundamentalism; rather, it was an affirmation of a flexible
and tolerant approach to moral life. He was more
sympathetic to "the man who eats caviar on
impulse than in the man who eats grape nuts on
us

principle."

Government an Impediment to Economic Growth

by RAM LEE

government regulation and taxation. Itis very

On Feb. 16. Bill Clinton addressed a
joint session of Congress to outline his economic plan. He declared that "together we
must make our economy thrive once again."
And that "at thishistoric moment, as Communism had fallen, as freedom is spreading
around the world, as a global economy is
taking shape before our eyes, Americans have
called for change—and now it is up to those
of us in this room to deliver." Mr. Clinton
notes thefallof theSoviet Unionbut seems to
have forgotten the lessons thereof: government is an impediment, not a catalyst, to
economic growth, socialisteconomicsfails in
a country teeming with ethnic diversity, and
the road whichleads to economic recovery is
paved with individuals, not agencies.
Clinton's economic plan possesses as its
catalyst forrecovery whatI view as one ofthe
main impediments to growth: government
programs. In looking at Mr. Clinton's economic address, it is apparent that he doesn't
believe thatthe government is theproblem, he
looks to it for the solution.
Clintonomics plans "new rewards for
entrepreneurs who take risks. We will give
smallbusiness access to thebrilliant technology of our time and to the credit they need to
prosper and flourish." The reason that the
government even needs to intervene to help
small businesses is because of the excessive

dangerous in this day and age to even take the
responsibility of hiring an employee because of
the intense legal liability. As long as the
Federal government continues its present attitude towards small businesses it will be
necessary to create the programs which Mr.
Clinton proposes. The main problem here,
however, is that it creates two levels of bureaucracy where little is needed. The free
market should be able to provide the credit
necessary to fund entrepreneurs and the technology once it becomes economically feasible.
Mr. Clinton calls for Investment Tax
Credits, which would be a good idea if they
didn't just create another maze of rules for
businesses to follow. I can't say that this will
fail, but I am suspicious that this will not
accurately address the expansion needs of
many small businesses. Clintonalso is planning some Jack Kemp-style Enterprise Zones
for businesses in inner-city depressed areas.
This could work if it allows the business to
make a good profit Democrats' plans for
Enterprise Zones have come before and they
usually try to exclude the entrepreneur from
taking too sizable a profit. It is the possibility
of a profit greater than in other areas which is
necessary to draw entrepreneurs to depressed
areas, where stable economic activity can
have such a beneficial effect
Another problem in the success of the

Democrat's Enterprise Zones is all the rest of promising government jobs to all those on

by PAUL ANSCHEL and
JAMES HOCKENBERRY

James: Why are you looking in those old
Phoenixes, Paul? Don't you think we are
funny anymore? You can tell me. I can take

Paul: Actually, I was trying to see ifwe were
ever funny.
James: Any luck? We weren't always lame,

Paul: Well, thepictures are kind offunny, but

James: Are we going to have this non-funny

Paul: Hell, yes. We're enginemajors. Look
dude, on the wall they have the Phoenix
obscenity policy (we're in the Phoenix office
trying to feel like real writers). According to
it, "As a matter ofpolicy, obscenities will not
be printed. Writers are expected to be proficient enough to avoid the extraneous use of
profanity. There will be NO exceptions to
this policy unless the writer can justify the use
of profanity to the Editor-in-Chief." Shit

far as high-tech cartooning (totally slick and

haven't seen it, but Sam said that even though
the basketball stuff was pretty cool, the plot
was lame and he didn't like that woman in it.
Paul: I saw part of it over in the quint one
night, but I was pretending to study so I didn't
really see it. It is pretty lame, but it stars the
"Woody" dude from Cheers (a used-to-be-

James: What is the plot anyway?
Paul: A rather difficult question really. I
think I really don't know.
James: That's alright. It sort of fits in with
our less is more theory of explaining movies.
I had heard that they were a good pair, too.
But if you take too good people and put them
in the wrong setting, you get We're No Angels. Personally, I'd rather watch old episodes of Knight Rider than that. They play
old ones on Saturday now, score!
Paul: Dude, I'll be there.
James: Did you know that the voice ofKitt
was actually that older stuffy dude from St.
Elsewhere?
Adam: You mean it's not actually Kitt talking? What are you trying to say exactly?
James: I mean they needed to have a model
for Kitt's voice, and they used his voice.
Don't get all riled up.
Adam: Fantastic then.
Paul: Anyway, I think the plot of this movie
is centered around street basketball, and I
seem to remember one of them owes a rather
large sum of money to some loan sharks or
something; so I guess, the plot also has to do
with bets on basketball...l guess, kind of, but
not really at all.
James: Anyway, I won't be going to either
movie this week. I'm just going to wait to
next week. And for those people who won't
be going to movies for weird liberal reasons,
chill, it's just a cartoon, dude.

Conference Examines Israeli-Palestinian Relations
by LAURA GREEN
A couple of weeks ago I received a flier
in the mail entitled, "Israel, the Jewish
Diaspora, and the Peace Talks: Does American Jewry have a role in bringing about peace

intheMiddleEast?Whatisthatrole?"lknew

that as an American Jew, that question was
very relevant to me and important to address.
The flier was for a seminar, sponsored by
the Swarthmore Zionist Connection, Perm
Hillel, Bryn Mawr/Haverford Hillel, Greater
Philadelphia Hillel, and the Israeli Embassy.
The forum was to take place in Washington,
D.C. andwould featureseveral speakers from
different sides of the political and religious

issues.

I set out on the evening ofMarch 27 with

&

busload of about 40 students from eight

different colleges in

the Philadelphia area,

along with Denny Bobman of GreaterPhiladelphia Hillel and Marjorie Berman, advisor

to the Swarthmore Zionist Connection. By

the time the bus reached Washington 2 1/2
hours later, almost everyone on the bus had
met each other. This was before the activities
that had been planned to "break the ice" were
even started!
The next day was a full one, packed with
four different speakers and small group discussions. The first presenter was Jonathan

Kessler, Executive Director of the Centerfor
Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation and Advisor on Jewish Affairs to the
Clinton Campaign.
Kessler discussed the reasons behind the
creation of Israel, and the ideology ofZionism, or Jewish nationalism. He also outlined
U.S.-Israel relations and how they have
changed withthe change ofgovernments both
in Israel and the U.S. Kessler's talkclarified
the principles behind Zionism and helped me
to better understand the need that so many
Jews feel for their own nation.
After a short question-answer session
with Kessler, we split up into groups to discuss ourpersonalrelationships to Israel.Hearing whatmy peers had to say about their ties
to Israel was very informative, especially
because I have never been to Israel and therefore have felt relatively distant from it One
student from Haverford expressed how she
felt the moment she stepped off the plane in
Israel, sensing a personal bond with the Israelis.
The next speaker was Marwan Muasher,
who, as spokesman for the JordanianDelegation to the Peace Talks, offered a different
perspective on the Arab-Israeli conflict He
asked that his statements be kept off the
record, so I can only say that I appreciated the
chance to hear an official from theother side

of the aisle give his viewpoint on the issues.
After that, Warren Adelman of the Israeli
Embassy spoke about the Israeli perspective
on the conflict. He also asked that his statements stay off therecord.
Organization from the Washington end
came from Jason Hoffman, of the University
Student Department (USD) of the American
Zionist Youth Foundation. He provided us
with information on a whole range of programs in Israel available for students. Students can do archeological work, live on a
Kibbutz, or study a wide variety ofacademic
subjects, in many areas ofIsrael.
The human rights aspect ofIsraeli society was discussed by Daphna Scharfman, the
Chairpersonofthe Civil Rights Committeeof
the Israel Labor Party. She discussed the
treatment ofIsraeli Arabs (who are citizens of
Israel) versus that accorded to Palestinians in
the occupied territories. Israeli Arabs have
the same political and human rights as Israeli
Jews, except that they are not made to join the
Israeli army. Scharfman pointed out that the
problem with this system is that the benefits
ofbeing in thearmy are not available to them.
The Palestinians, on the other hand, are
not citizens of Israel, and therefore cannot
vote or be elected. Their desire for political
rights and self-ruleis the basis formuchof the
current unrest in the occupied territories.

Scharfman also describedthe progress that is
being made in promoting women to high
positions in the government, although she
still believes that there is much room for
improvement
The seminar was over before we knew it,
and as students expressed their opinions of
the conference, it was obvious that people
wanted even more time to discuss the issues
that had been presented.
Many remarked on the insight they had
gained from the speakers, the question-answer sessions, and each other in the group
discussions. Aviva Kushner '96 said of the
forum, "Raising consciousness is the fust
step in talking about the conflict."
Most students were impressed with all
the speakers and enjoyed connecting with
students on other college campuses. I appreciate the complexity of the situation in the
Middle East more than ever before participating in this seminar. In the future, there will
hopefully be more opportunities to listen to
diverse perspectives about the Middle East
conflict and other issues affecting Jews.
Anyone interested inhearing more about
theconference in Washington, D.C. is invited
to attend an informal discussion of what we
learned, sponsoredby the Swarthmore ZionistConnection.It will takeplace next Wednesday, April 7 at 7:30 p.m. in Trotter WlO2.

This April, the Swarthmore Civil Liberties Society is sponsoring Rights of the Disabled Month. Patricia Whitmanhas been the
Equal Opportunity Officer for 12 years and
her job has involved making sure that all
students at Swarthmore get the same shot at
an education. Her added position as Coordinator for Services for Disabled Students has
only come into being this semester, "both to
give support to those students whoneedit and
also to say something to the community, as a
sign that the community is interested and
cares."
Recent legislation has given incentive to
institutions all over the country to take action
to honor the rights of those with disabilities.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
is a revolutionary piece of legislation that was
passed a couple of years ago that makes
demands on public institutions which will
allow thefullest possible participation of disabled individuals inpublic activities.
Since a disability is broadly defined as
any condition which interferes with one or
more life functions, the ADAplaces requirements on thephysical aspects ofpublic buildings such as bathroom faculties, ramps and
elevators, and door and hallway widths.
S warthmoreis in the process of complying with the ADA, for example, by putting in
a ramp outsideofMcCabe library. The ADA
asks mat an institutionmake changes "within
reason,'' which the school has already done,
in some respects. Ithas yet to be determined,
and will most probably only be determined
via case law, how great an impact the ADA
will have on this campus.
Whitman said that in her twelve years
here, she has not seen a S warthmore student
who was confined to a wheelchair. Practically speaking, students with such physical
disabilities that impede movement would not
be attracted to Swarthmore because the campus is inaccessible to people bound tb such
alternate forms of transportation.
"The college needs to make choices,"
says Whitman. "The college needs to say,
'Do we wantto put an elevator in this building
so that people can be involved, or do we want
to move those things to places that will be
more accessible."*
On the whole, with a little help from
Whitman, the administration has been responsive to the needs of disabled students
whichhave arisen. In one case, a woman who
was a student at Swarthmore had lupus, a

What's On

degenerative disease and it was important that
shehave no sun exposure. Since shehad been
placed in a very sunny dorm room which was
a hazard to her health, the Assistant Dean in
charge ofhousing, Tedd Goundie'spredecessor, needed some "encouragement" from
Whitman to move her to a more shaded room.
Although this particular instance required
some effort, overallWhitmanhas beenpleased
with the cooperation which she has received
from the administration. There is a small
monetary grant available to students who
haveneeds due to physical disabilities. "We're
required to provide whatever materials are
necessary for the [disabled] person to have
the same education that [a student without a
disability] would have," said Whitman and
added that Swarthmore has been good about
utilizing the grant
Whitmanbrings a special perspective to
her workbecause she has a seizure disorder.
This causes her to focus, in part, on invisible
disabilities, such as epilepsy, heart conditions,asthma, andothers. Thisfocus is appropriate to Swarthmore because of her belief
that there are more people at Swarthmore
with these types ofdisabilities. She believes
that invisible disabilities are something that
we need to dealwith more, perhaps by working with theHealthCenter to promote awareness, or by forming a support group.
It often has been difficult to deal with
issues of disabled students. There is a rift,
sometimes, between people with visible and
invisible disabilities," which Whitman feels
is very unfortunate. Meanwhile, all people
withdisabilities want to be thesame as everyone else.
Thus, she sees her position to be concerned primarily with support of disabled
students. "One of the real frustrations that I
had this semester was that I put out a notice
asking students with disabilities of any kind
to come forward because I wanted to form a
support group. I got one person [to respond]."
The support group did not work out due to
lack of interest, and Whitman feels that this,
in part, demonstrates the difficulty of talking
about this issue on campus.
As the ADA is implemented at Swarthmore, Whitmanlooks forward to meeting the
challenges it will present "I have always
looked uponmy seizure disorder as an opportunity to educate...To me, the ability to show
students that you can have dignity in the face
of adversity is the best lesson, the best giftI
could give, and itis one of the things I am most
proud 0f... I think that's what most disabled
people seek."

Women's Center to Hold Meeting to Unite Swat Women
f
Women s Center Hopes that April 8 Meeting Will Initiate Newsletter to Bridge Communications

oncampus. Thepurpose of the umbrella group,
which will consist of all women interested,
will be to publish a newsletter that will provide updates of the activities ofall the different groups on campus and serve as a medium
for communicationbetween all women.
Although theWomen'sCenterwas originally founded to represent the needs of all
women students, many women on this campus feel excluded from the Women's Center.
One woman said that there is "afeeling across
campus that the Women's Center does not
address issues concerning women of color."
However, according to many members
of the Women's Center, this is a negative
stereotype that the group is dominated by a
certain type of woman and that all others are
not welcome to participate in meetings.
In order to get more women involved,
change the way that Swarthmore views the
Center, and shape a new Centerthat all women
feel comfortable in, Walker would like to get
more first-year women involved in theorganization during next year's OrientationWeek
In addition, by working with a faculty advisor
who will voice the Women's Center's concerns to the administration and by forming
several joint committees with other women's
groups, theWomen's Center hopes to revitalize its program over the next few years.
Wiggin believes that although this process of changing the Women's Center's image androle at Swarthmore will be a long and
difficultprocess, themeeting on April 8 is the
first step in the right direction. In the meantime, the group will continue their efforts to
raise awareness on campus.

by AMANDA ROCQUE

Since its formation over twenty years
ago, the Women's Center has become one of
the most active organizations on campus.
Women's Center intern Asahi Pompey '95
said thatthepurpose of the group is to "be the
center forall women on campus" and serve as
a space that is open for all at any time. As a
student organization, the Women's Center is
funded with a budget from the SAC to cover
costs of events sponsoredby the group.
The Women's Center has been active in
planning all-campus social events such as
coffeehouses with student a capella groups,
danceparties featuring all-female music, and
movies on, Fridays. It has also held several
discussions on women's issues and sponsored several speakers. Women's Center intern Emily Walker '96 said that one of the
most successful of these discussions was "an
all-women's talk in the IC that opened up
communication" between several women's
groups on campus. TheWomen'sCenteralso
publishes a magazine, Common Speaking,
that features writing, poetry, artwork, and
photography by female students.
The Women's Center's was active
throughout March celebrating Women's
Herstory Month. The group's most important
event of the semester, however, is an upcoming meeting for all female faculty, staff and
students. TheWomen'sCenterhopes that this
gathering will be the largest amassing of
women this year.

Einstein s Dreams DefiesTradition Three Wise Women

Lightman's Poetic Prose Blended with History and Science

PThe

Literary
Fetish

by MARY HELEN DUPREE

Alan Lightman, author of the
new bestseller Einstein's Dreams,
teaches physics and writing at M.I.T.
Given his background, one might
expect Lightman to write a melange
of Joseph Campbellphilosophy and
Mr. Wizard physics, with a little
Eastern mysticism on the side.However, Einstein's Dreams is a singular literary work, imaginative and
subtle. Although billed as a novel,
Einstein's Dreams fails as a novel
in the traditional sense. It succeeds
asan extendedpoetic work in prose,
a work which questions the representationof truth in traditionalliterary forms.
Einstein'sDreams can best be
described as a series of reflective
vignettes, connectedby a common
theme and setting which are represented in a prologue, an epilogue,
and several interludes. In 1905,
Albert Einstein, a patent clerk in
Berne, prepares to submitbis theory
of time to the journal Annals of
Physics. For the past few months,
Einstein hasbeen troubledby dreams
in which time takes on countless
forms in worlds similar to our own.
In one world, the forward progression of time promotes order rather
than disorder: "The sound of thunder makes a broken vase reform
itself, makes the fractured shards
leap up to theprecise positions where
they fit and bind." In another, time
is quantized, eachunit separated by
barely discernible gaps; in yet another, time is "a visible dimension"
through which one can move as
through space. The humanbeings in
each world struggle to adapt to the
situations time creates. In the world
without entropy, people instead of

spring cleaning "furiously lay waste
to their houses... meet atunarranged
times, throw away their watches,
drink through thenight." Where time

can be traversed like a landscape, a
dissatisfied young woman escapes
into the future only to find herself
aged andalone. Each worldreflects
some aspect ofthe nature oftime in
our own world.
We see Einstein himself as he
dreams these worlds, in search of a
unified theory of time. His ideas
possess him as the Musepossesses
an artist; in his absorption, he neglects to eat and withdraws from his
family and colleagues. "His dreams
have worn him out, exhausted him
so that he sometimes cannot tell
whetherhe is awake or asleep." Yet
Einstein's humanity emerges inrare
moments:" ...whenhe saw theissue
ofAnnalen derPhysik bearing his
first paper, he imitated a rooster for
fully five minutes." The visions of
time haunt Einstein not only because of the human problems they
present but also because of their
relevance to scientific theory.
As a whole, Einstein'sDreams
attempts to express the contradictions and sorrows of living in a
world bound by time. Each of the
worlds of which Einstein dreams
could easily be our own; theway we
really view time encompasses all of
these worldsand more. In one world,
people possess no memories; in another, people live forever trapped
within a memory. There are worlds
where timeis a reliableabsolute and
worlds where time is relative, ineffable, unquantifiable. In the world

of our own minds, time is all of
these, and cannot be characterized
by any one of its formations. In
Einstein's last dream, time exists in
theform of nightingales. If a bird is
trapped in a bell jar, time stops, but
"the trapped moment soon grows
withered and without life." As our
understanding of timeeludes us, so
too our own time; its constant movement is all we have to rely on.
Einstein's Dreams is to be
highly recommended. Lightman's
prose approaches poetry in its elegance and intensity, and he combines imagination with a subtle understanding of the human motives.
Nevertheless, as a novel, Einstein's
Dreams fails to flesh out its main
character, Einstein, whorarely transcends the mold of the withdrawn
genius; neither does it build up to a
climax and denouement.
However, what Lightman attempts in Einstein's Dreams is really an anti-novel. Rather than focus on a few central characters, it
moves from character to character
in an attempt to capture the human
condition. Where many novels attempt to definethemselves in a closing paragraph, Einstein's Dreams
expresses a physicist's skepticism
that such closing paragraphs can be
applied to real life. In Einstein's
Dreams, Lightman has attempted
what may be one of the boldest
literary ventures of the past few
years.

So you have a problem and you're not sure
how to solve it. Whether you are lonely and
depressed, tired of your friends, cracking
under academic pressure, embarrassed

Swat Track to Challenge Haverford, Saturday, at Home
TVack Team is Hungry for Competition After Rain Ruined Last Week's Meet
by MATT PECK
Spring, the season mankind's
dreams come to life. It's a time for
Spring training; March Madness;
sunshine and gentle breezes; new
loves found and lost or never acquired; and long,relaxing afternoons
spent at the track with your teammates.

This was the reality the Men's
Track Team, in their latest journey
southward, experienced last Friday.
For those fortunate enough to have
traveled within Future Van,
Virginia's Mary Washington College couldn't have been a kinder
host, sub-par track excepted, on that
fme afternoon....lt was perfect
Swat had "only" one event that
day; however, I use the term "only"
begrudgingly. Swat's 4 X 800 m
relay was nothing shortof awesome.
Co-captain Will Roth '93 avoided
the hazards of an excessively
crowded start, and used his 2:01
split to bring the Garnet to thefirst
pass in scoring range. Next, the DTrain, Co-captain Duane Malone
'93, who ran absolutely phenomenally for his last 200 m, powered

Swat into second with his awe-inspiring 1:58 split Jupiter Bridge
'94 held Swat's position with a career best 2:01 split Finally, Scott
Reents '96, the froshphenom who's
capable of beating anyone in any
race from 400 m to five miles, laid
out a career best 2:01 for the team.
If not for thetremendous effort
of a Towson State stud, the team
could have, had second. As it was,
the Garnet went for the cycle garnering a stellar 8:01 total time, two
PRs, third place, and four lovely tshirts for their effort. Those who
came to watch had a nice jog and
saw a fantastic race, like I said....it
was perfect
With a smile on his face and a
song in his heart, Coach Williams
prepared for a good night's sleep
that Friday night The stars above
shonebrightly and a good track day
seemed to be guaranteed for the
following morning.
But then...the dreamwas shattered. The team was awakened by
the pitter-patter of a light drizzle
beating upon the roof above their
heads. As the day continued, the
drizzle slowly developed into a tor-

Despite Bad Weather, Women's Track Takes Fifth at
Western Maryland Relays; Hosts Haverford Saturday

Last Saturday startedoff beautifully. (Remember how nice last
Friday was?) Seven members of the
women's track team joyfully
skipped down to the field house at
8:30 AM.,eager to compete in what
promised to be a beautiful day for an
outdoor meet. Well, I'm not sure
how the weather was here in
Swarthmore, but the cows were lying down in Western Maryland.
On our way to Western Maryland College, site of the infamous
W.M. relays, cows seemed to be a
big topic ofconversation. The fact
that they were lying down,ofcourse,
meant that it was going to rain. An
aside to this was Megan's discovery
that the black and white geometric
pattern on her pillow was not intended to represent a cow.

It's finally come down to this.
After 64 teams and 60 games, the

a weird way I sort of did. The one
thing I knew for sure was that
Indiana, the number one seed in the

Louisville to be in the Final Four,
but so what, I was kind of close.
Anyway, that's the most positive
spin I can put on that botched pick.
Now, on to New Orleans. The
first game on Saturday, Kansas vs.
North Carolina, will be a rematch of
the national semifinal from two

Men's Lacrosse Shoots Down
MAC Rivals, Drew and Dickinson
Swat Starts Season with 2-0 Division Record
By MATT WIGGINS
The Swarthmore laxmen, a

wind, rain, and cold to pull off two
victories over their first MAC opponents last week.

Ned Southworth each contributed
three goals for Swat. Freshman
Dave Sturtevant said, "We converted on our man-up offense well

and controlled the ground balls to
win." The squad enjoyed 12 Drew
penalties to gain a significant extraman advantage, as well as scooping
up almost 20 more ground balls.
Dickinson was the next stop
for Swarthmore, and the laxmen
returned witha 11-lOovertimethrilling win. Swat fell behind early in

the contest, and found themselves
playing catch-up for much of the
game. The offense rallied to tie the
game 7-7 before they fell behind
10-7 in the 4th. Swarthmore then
came back to put the score at 10-9.
In attempt to shut down the speed of
the Red Devils, Swarthmore
defenseman Mark Fink stepped up
and played tough denying D, while

Shannon Brown *95 and Ben Seigel
96 forced a turnover that waspicked
off by Gasperoni, sending the ball
theotherway. A quick goal later the
game headed for OT. In sudden
death overtime, senior Sandy
Watkins drovefrom the midfield to
stick his third goal of the day and
win the gamefor Swat.
TheS warthmorelacrosse team,
according to Seigel, has improved
on moving the ball up field, but still
needs to work on shooting. The tenacious zone defense has proved to
be a formidable force and Tim
Gasperoni '95 (or *96) has not allowed anything by in the goal.
Tomorrow the laxmen will be
tested by St. Mary's from southern
MD. Mary's, who beat West
Chester 16-8 this week, should give
Swat a good game. The game will
be played either on thefootballfield
or across the street in Cunningham
Dome, and will be a good test in
preparation for Wednesday's game

In a memo dated April Ist,
All Boom institutionalized a policy that not only gives
spousal benefits to the partners of
necrophiliacs, but also mandates a
no-holes-barred sexual ethicfor the
college. The administration's new
policy statement runs as follows:
"In the past S warthmore has been a
pioneer in crossing racial, religious,
and political borders. The administration seeks to complete theexperiment it has startedby acknowledging the true range of sexuality and
breaking down all remaining gaps

The restrictions on all sexual
activity have been lifted in an attempt to be more inclusive and understanding of those who do not toe
the party line of the traditionalbut
archaic hetero- or homo- sexuality.
A spokesperson for the president's
office said, "We have left out a
smallbutpersecuted minority in the
past, and now S warthmore has garnered the moral courage and legal
know-how to redress this injustice
by being thefirst in the country to allow

New Workshop Introduced
by the CHARRED DUTCH

SCREAMER

A new semester-long workshop was announced this week
by the Dean's Office in coordination with Psych Services. The
Mortality Awareness Workshop
will be based on the model ofthe

Sexuality Awareness Workshop,

and will explore issues of death
and dying.

Since several students will

invariably be uncomfortable

speaking directlyabout issues of
death, the first several weeks of
the workshop will be devoted to
desensitizing the students. This
will be done slowly and gently at
first with the novella Death Be
Not Proud and the film Dying
Young. From there, the class
will touch on the classical literature of the death genre,reading
the The Denial ofDeath, various
Edgar Allan Poe pieces, and the
usual Romantic poetry. The end
of the desensitivity training will
be a screening of the Faces of
Death films and may include a
few other snuff films to complete the process.
But the real focus of the
workshop is on getting each student to come to terms with his/
her own mortalityand imminent

hungry. Students would then order many
more pizzas than on a usual night.
Evidence for the conspiracy is still mounting, but The Phoenix, with the help of a
studentwho worksforRenato's whorequested
anonymity, found several peculiar aspects of
Renato's payroll. First, they hired extra help
for specific days and somehow managed to do
about double their usual business on these
nights. Apparently, the pizza owners knew
when the students were going to be more
hungry than usual. In addition, The Phoenix
learned that that same Sharpies manager was
receiving kickbacks from the pizza places
under the name Al Bloom.
With the management at Sharpies discredited, college administration scrambled to
decidewhat to do in the meantime. President
Broom said he was making "an emergency
stop-gap measure" and thus will devote a
significant chunk of the five million dollars
JamesMichener gave to the college last year
to improving the dining hall.
However, it soon became apparent that
the extra funds were not necessary when, after

further investigation, The Phoenix found out
thatthe same managerhad been skimming up
to one quarter of the dining hall budget by
jacking up the prices at Essie Mae's. Although students thought they were actually
paying $1.60 for that large orange juice,
forty cents ofit went into a slush fund which
was diverted to an account at the Credit
Union.
College officials would neither confirm
or deny that they had frozen the manager's
account, but sources in Broom's closet, office and cabinet claim they froze the account
last Thursday.
Broom said he has made a contract with
the managers of the Four Seasons Hotel for
them to start providing food service at the
college starting in the fall. "I'm very bitter at
this blatant misuse of power," said Broom,
"we are planning to press all applicable charges
and possibly also sue the bastard in court!"
In addition to the new management,
Swarthmore's meal plan will be revamped.
In response to student demands, the college
will finally provide an alternative to the current 20 meal plan. Students will have a choice
between seven, fourteen, and twenty meal
plans. Students will also be able to accumulate stockpile unused meal credits for later
use. Lastly, the snack bar will have its prices
evaluated and the credit awarded for each
meal will be adjusted as necessary.
The manager has been taken in to custody and will be arraigned tomorrow in Media
court. The borough police would not comment as to what the fate of the pizza shop
owners would be, but one officer said "they
won't get away with anything."

A Little Scandal Haunts
Spring Weekend Planners
by HELIX AUK
Scandal rocked Swarthmore's annual
"SpringWeekend" when the college community got wind of some of this year's planned
events. Plans to update this usually festive
party weekend got out ofhand with the addition of a carnival which threatens school
notions of safety and decency. Students,
faculty, andadministrationhave voiced great
concern over the appropriateness of several
carnival attractions. According to an anonymous third-year student, "the Spring Weekend carnival, in its newest incarnation, is so
violentand politically- incorrect that it would
make Andrew 'Dice' Clay blush."
The controversy centers around the carnival activity commonly known as "dwarf
tossing." Quite aptly named, this activity
entails the parabolic flight of vertically-challenged individuals. WhenSAC co-ordinators
leaked news of plans to offer this attraction,
students and faculty were incensed. Chief
Spring Weekend planners attempted to offer
an explanation to an angry group of student
protesters, explaining, "I hear it's quite the
rage in Australia. [Dwarf] tossing is very...
multicultural."
This did little to quell the campus-wide
sense of outrage. Students have voiced concern to agencies operating above and beyond
the powers Swarthmore's Spring Weekend

planning board. Several juniors and seniors
have spoken to theschool's Board ofDeans in
an effort to cancel any dwarf-tossing plans.
Others have gone further, making plans
to set up an Amnesty International letter-writing table in Parrish Parlours. One
Amnesty spokesperson elaborated, stating,
"Dwarf tossing is a hideous violationofcivil
rights. S warthmorecannot allow itself to let
this criminal activity bloom simply because
it is popular in the land of 'Crocodile
Dundee."*
In light ofthese comments, Carnival Coordinators attempted to justify their plans,
claiming "people shouldn't do it simply because of its popularity in Australia and areas
ofNew Zealand. We're also offering prizes
to thebest throwers
and dwarftossing isn't
I mean, it's much less
really that unsafe
dangerous than 'Jarts.'"
Though the advertised prizes may have
quieted a few members of the Varsity Field
squad, the college community as a whole
remains on the edge ofinternal combustion.
Some administrators are calling for compromise, recommending "a good gameofbocce"
as a substitute. Yet one unpopular individual,
requesting to remain nameless, defended the
practice. Describing it as "essentially harmless," he wished that everyone would give a
dwarf "a solid handshake, a pair of kneepads,
and a good toss."

3/27/93 At 1:10 AM me and Joey got sick of listening to the pseudo-Seattle

grunge coming from the Old Club so we busted the place. Some ofthe students got

ornery. Most ofthose middle-room types are pretty scrawny though, and the freshman
jocks are such lightweight drinkers that we ran circles around them. Anyway they
don't have big metal flashlights which pack eight, size-D batteries and a real wallop.
We took the band back to Benjamin West and forced them to listen to the Allman
Brothers until they promised to learn a few more chords. If I hear some pretentious
kid whine into a microphone about his ex-girlfriend again—l mean whatdoes he know
about real suffering, the sufferings of a lover? I'm 35-years old and divorced.
3/28/93 At 3:23 PM the Tarbte Game-Room sitter reported that some Villekid
had taken a cue ball from the pool table. The subject was described as a Caucasian
male, approximately 5-feet tall and 12 years of age. He was wearing a t-shirt
emblazoned with the name of the funk-punk band Primus. A big lock of greasy hair
hung down his facelike a funeral shroud. The subject was apprehended in the vicinity
of the train station and the cue was retrieved. We yelled at the little dirtball until he
nearly wet bis pants. Then we called his Mom. We also tookaway his cigarettes and
smoked 'em out back of Benjamin West I love my job.
A student reported the theft of a Macintosh computer with peripherals from his
room in Parrish. The theft occurred between 1:00PM and 4:45 PM. The computer
equipment was valued at less than $3OO, a quarter ofits original price since it's a year
old. Not much we could do about itbut comfort thepoorguy. S houlda locked his door.
We took him out for an ice cream cone.

3/29/93 Another weekend successfully navigated! Morale is high at Benjamin
West And tonight we got a live one! At 2:15 AM Joey calls in and tells us there's
some couple making-out on the President's Lawn. When the rest of us get there the
couple, I swear to God, is completely naked! So we stole their clothes. WTiat a gas!
I'll bet they never do that again.
3/30/93 Astudentrerx)rtedthetheftofhisbookbagfromSharplesafterlunch. We

sat him down and tried to help him deal with loss. The important thing is to confront

the pain head on, otherwise the healing process will never get started. We all bad a
good cry and sent him on his way. Shouldn'ta left his goods unattended.

3/31/93 Some nerdy dickhead wanted to stay in Trotter and study after 2:00 AM
when we lock up. He said his hall was too loud. Joey and I didn't like his attitude—
I'm positive he mumbled something about Fascists at onepoint—so we took him out
back ofBenjamin Westand beat the crap out of him. Nothing I hate more than a snotty
bourgeois.
Mac Gruffthe Crime Dog's Tip of the Week: Don't even fucking look at me.

Are you Ready for Some Good, Clean Fun?
My Johnson at
the Movies
Paul: Hey James, whatmovies are showing this weekend?
James: Tworecently releasedfilms:Fridaynight playing in the Trotter Infernois The
Dick of Death and Saturday playing in the
basement of Hicks is Sorority Babes in the
Slime-Bowl-o-Rama.
Paul: Hey, for once, I've seen both of
those. Sometimes, late night cable pays off.
James: Sure you saw them on late night
cable. I saw you sneaking out of the rental
place with them. You don'tfool anyone for a
minute.
Paul: Yen, well, you told me to get them.
Anyway, the Dick of Death is a quality film.
Judging from the our screening, it must have
been at least a good Panasonic video camera.
While the acting lacks (we've never heardof
them and I am sure you haven't), the plot is
excellent Its a horror film where the main
character assaults and kills people with his
weapon, the dick of death. Aside from the
quality horror scenes, the musical score that
accompanies them is excellent
James: There's nothing wrong with
being economical in the design and implementation of any piece of cinema. People
don't raise doubts when they see Slacker, do
they? Are you sure that you weren't in this
movie, Paul? It would explain your present
social situation. Sorority Babes is a fine
movie as well, and it even has a famous
actress, Linnea Quigley. You may have seen
her in Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, Vice
Academy or Creepazoids. It's really cool just

for thefact that it's set in a bowling alley with
an alien trapped in a bowling trophy which
thesekids awake.
Paul: And for all you rednecks out there
like us, you can really relate to hanging around
a bowling alley, sucking half-empty beers
that people left around, playing the video
games, goggling at the high-hair girls, hanging in the Pro shop, etc. But I believe thisis
a movie with a message, it makes a social
statement (where are the sororities on this
campus) about the power of women (babes)
in groups, yeh that's it, babes in groups. After
the movie, a discussion group will be held in
Palmer lounge for all interested, a keg of
BEvEßages will be present. What's the
word?
James: Thunderbird. What's the price?
Paul: A dollar twice.
James: Of course, because this movie
brings up babe issues, as many babes as
possible should come to the discussion group.
We'll have beverages that'll take the hair off
your legs! In the spirit of this movie extravaganza, I think the school should invest in a
few otherfavorites: Breeders, RedNeckZombies t and Hell Comes to Frogtown.
Adam: Yeah man, Redneck Zombies is
a great movie, a total classic.
Paul: Excellent. So folks, go to the
movies this weekend. Remember these films
are all XXX so don't bring them visiting specs
(shit, bring them too, they might learn something). I feel I must reminisce by giving these
films the second annual boners and babes
award of the week.
James: Yeah, I give them a matched set
of chicks and sticks up.

Gut Reaction:

Cleansing Away the Slimy Phlegm
To the Dictator:
This article is written in modern postmodernpositivistic Swarthmorian slurs.
Translations were done by Languages
'R' Us. Please overlook omitted words
andtryyourbestin thefill-in-the-blanks.
And remember, these are professionals, so don't try this at home.
I am responding to David A-heh,
Coughman's article from last week entitled: "HowNow Novocaine?" in which
he tried so heinously to convince usthat
Novocaine is a positive force in this
universe, providing us the numbness
necessary to be Swarthmore students.
This article stunk like rotten eggs. It
was the worst thing I have ever read in
my life, and believe me, and I'm sure
you do, I have written some pretty horrid pieces since I stepped onto thatlump
ofintellectualism so many smelly years
back.
David's piece, being a response to
my article: "Lice in America: Beware
of the Hidden Enemy," was pointless
and messy. He was flailing around like
a panicked child who had just walked
into a giant web way way way too
complex for him tofathom; and the best
he could do was try to wipe it away
from his consciousness with a few
poorly aimed swipes, looking like a
weirdo swatting away the invisible bees
ofhis psychosis to all onlookers.
Like Quaker oatmeal, "How Now
Novocaine" was watered-down, runny
and lumpy. Ittasted bad. Itneeded more
brown sugar. In essence, it was a silly
walk in the dark, and the walker ran
face first into a brick wall.
Let me make an attempt to cleanse
away the slimy phlegm Dave attempts
to use to slosh away the brilliance ofmy
profound and eye-opening piece. First
of all, Dave tries to convince us that
President Clinton, known by all of us as
"He who shares no french fries", is
actually a puppet figurehead forReverend Moonie. Not only that, Dave tells
us Clinton is not simply a Moonie, but
a Communist Moonie; and, were that
not enough, he tries to persuade us that
our very own President is none other
than a Communist, FascistMoonie, well
versed in Napoleonic sonnets (which,
as we all know, are very dirty and
robust, unbefitting a leader of our civilized country).

That is outrageous! First of all because Clinton is the big Fry, and not
some Hamburglar. Secondly, my original article was about lice, not politics.
This obviously hit a nerve in our very
hairy friend, with little dandruff. So
much so that he tries to turn our universalpsyche away from hair follicles and
towards the mouth that chews. That
simply cannot be.
I agree with many points in Dave's
piece. I agree that when the dentist
offers Novocaine, that isthe fundamental moment of decision we must all face
in our lives. I agree that McDonald's
French fries taste good. But it is just
plain stupid to buy french fries without
also purchasing a six-piece Chicken
McNugget. Dave just can't understand
that, and that is where he goes astray.
Furthermore, I agree that you can'thave
your cake and eat it too while you've
been givenNovocaine. Such would be
a gravely dangerous adventure, for after a good injection ofthat sorcery right
beside the fifth bicuspid, one can never
know for sure where one's tongue is
sloshing around. Big bites ofcake could
be fatal to one's sense of sweetness.
Nevertheless, I feel I must defend
myself against Dave's erroneous slander. No, I have never suffered from
botulism. No, I have never inhaled. No,
I did not know Lee Harvey Oswald...l
wasn't even bom yet, you vile rumormongering squid. And no, I do not floss
regularly, so sue me.
Anyone who could write such
things is no doubt villainous and dare I
say eating too many poppy seeds. My
advice to you is, seek psychotherapy.
But that is probably something you
have heard many times before.
In conclusion, "How Now
Novocaine?" was stupid and arcane.
The author needs deep analysis, for he
suffers from deep perversions. Nevertheless, I agreed with almost everything he said, and so should you. See
you in a few weeks, when I write a five
page response to Dave's vapid, fallacious, and loony response, justfor the
sake ofkeeping the Opinions page alive,
and, more importantly, to hear the cloying sweetness of my authority-stricken
voice drone on forever.
Sincerely,
Smorg S. Bored '94

United We Stand Swarthmore

Political Watch-dog Group Forms on Campus
by JAMES STOCKDALE
Last week, the StudentCouncil approved
the charterof a new political-action group on
campus, which is to be called United We
Stand Swarthmore. This group, which has
been linked to H. Ross Perot's nation-wide
political watch-dog organization, "will enable Swarthmore students to carefully monitor legislative and executive actions, and will
help to hold the government accountable for
its promises," according tocampus co-watchdogs-in-chief, H. Matthew Schenk and H.
Ron Smith.
Said Schenk, "What we got here is a
buncha sneaky ole possums. Ya follow me?
They sleep all day,hangin' upside downs an'
all that business, and then durin' the night,
tham critturs make off with all your hard
earned wagesand high-tail it to Japan. Ya got
that?"
"What we gotta do," continued Smith,
"is to get under that hood, tinker with that
carburetor, slice that deficit, fix them sheep,
and knock off that racket. We do that—then
we can start worryin' about all that hoop-dela that all them politicians up there in their
houses-o'-glass are makin' all that hootin'
and hollarin' about."
The group will be funded by a $5OO
dollar gift from All Boom, who commented,
"I admit it, I voted for the guy. Who could
possibly findfault with someone that short?";
a $750 dollar grant from TheForumfor Quaint
and Quirky Speech; an undisclosed amount
from Swarthmore alum Peter Sourbach '92,
who simply described himself as "a big fan";
and a 1.7 billion dollar donationfrom Perot
himself. SaidPerot: "Don't ya justlove these
little critturs? This is whatmakes it all worthwhile. I just look at these youngsters, out
there tryin' to make a difference, and it just
makes me wanta bust up inside."
The group hopes to hold a fund-raiser
sometime next semester, to make up for any
added costs they might incur during their
regular operations. Schenk cites that the
group will be sponsoring a membership drive
sometime in early October, enabling all
Swarthmore students to become a part of
United We Stand for a mere $19.95. Explained Schenk, "I mean, justthink of all the
meaningless stuff you spend $19.95 on dur-

ing the average academic year. Youprobably
spend at least that on pizza. Now with United
We Stand Swarthmore, you can spend that
hard-earned federal work-study money on
something meaningful* like membership into
an official political watch-dog organization.
Plus, if you act now, you get a free DownSouthDecoder Ring, which will enableyou to
understand even the most quaint and obscure
Perot sayings. It's a real bargain."
Perot enthusiast H. Alice Stillmanagrees,
adding, "I'm already a member, and it's
brought me more joy and happiness than you
could imagine." To beat the rush, Schenk
notes, you can mail him your check immediately.
United We Stand Swarthmore will soon
be putting up a bulletin board in Parrish hall.
It will be found on the same board that the
recently defunctCollege Democrats formerly
occupied. As for headquarters, United We
StandSwarthmore will temporarily be housed
in the Inter cultural Center, until the new H.
Ross Perot Performing Arts Center/United
We Stand Headquarters is completed.
From theirnew location, UnitedWeStand
hopes to link all students by means of an
electronic town-hall. Perot has okayed the
purchase of 1400big-screen TVs, so that all
students and faculty can "log-in and help
clean out the bam" together. Until this network is completed, thegroup hopes to utilize
the new campus-wide computer network by
w ay of several shortand annoying all-campus
e-mail mailings.
In order to "get right out andfeel whatthe
campus is feeling," Schenk, Perot and Smith
would appreciate it if all those interested in
"holding the government accountable for its
actions," would fill out the accompanying
survey, and mail it to: United We Stand
America National Referendum, P.O. Box
9000, London, KY 40742. The ballot was
originally intended to be completed after
Perot's March 21st program entitled: The
First NationalReferendum—GovernmentReform. In the unlikely event that any of you
happened to miss the broadcast, you can get
an in-depth summary from any one of your
hall-mates who watched the program, or obtain your own copy by sending a check or
money orderfor $49.95 toH. Matthew Schenk

THE BARKING DOG
BY DARRYL KLUSKOWSKI

Billionaire philanthropist and megalomaniac, H. Matthew Schenk, recently announced
plans to form a political watch-dog group at Swarthmore.

Swarthmore "Arrogant Pride"
Makes Jump to Ivy League
by TACT KEMP

This past week the Swarthmore Athletic
Department announced that Swarthmore College will not be joining the newly established
Centennial Conference as planned in the 199394 season. Instead, Swarthmore has decided to
leave the Mid-Altlantic Athletic Conference in
favor of joining the prestigious Division I Ivy
League.
Brenn Jones '96, a spokesman for the department, commented, "Haverford College is
simply incapable of competing with (Swarthmore College's) superior athletic prowess, superior attitude and superior state of mind. For
this reason we crave the opportunity to devour
the likes of Yale, Harvard and Penn."
The initial announcement was made on
Tuesday night in Lancaster, PA, when
Swarthmore's representatives stoodup, scoffed
roundly and proceededto walkoutofthemonthly
meeting after being asked to sign the final charter to join theCentennial League. Onerepresentative, who simply wishes to be referred to as
"Slick Willy," told us, and I quote, "Gentlemen, I
have never derived as much pleasure as when I
looked (Haverford's Head Track Coach) Tom
Donnelly in the eyes and said 'You sir are an
<§>ss.'"
The supportfor the jumpinto the IvyLeague
is not unanimous withinthe college. At a recent
roundtable discussion Ingrid Spies '96 commented, "My life will not be the same without
being able to witness the regular beatings
Haverford suffers as the result of Swarthmore
Athletics' dominance. In fact, I thinkI'm going
to cry...."
Ingrid proceeded to work off her
dissapointmentby running ten miles.
Special student Guian McKee, who actually graduated last year, has been identified as
the sneaky little mastermind who deviously decidedthat Swarthmore should move onto greener
pastures than the manure infestedMACs whose
bureacratic backwash has severely hampered
the quality of the conference.
Although Guian has not publicly commented on what first inspired his idea that Swat
should join theIvy League, it is widely accepted
that Williams ratings on the U.S. News and
World Report College rankings affected the
college's decision. It is this reporter's opinion
that President Bloom, Dean Barr, and Dean
Gross believe that by going to Division I
athletics, Swarthmore will join theranks of the
major colleges and will not be compared to
Williams anymore. That way if we come in third
it will be behind Harvard and Yale. Also, the
term Little Ivy League has been deemed unacceptable and diminutive by the PC elements of
thecampus. Thus the new motto to attract new
students to the campus might read: Swarthmore, the little-big university that we really like
to call a college.
Representatives at Penn University tell us
that before Swarthmore is allowed into the Ivy
League, the college will have to meet two criterion. First the school must be willing to change
its nickname. Our source at Penn cited the
following reason for the demand: "Well, you
'

see, Penn, being the University of Pennsylvania
and all, is ratherfond of the nickname Quakers,
and if S warthmoreCollege, you know you guys,
wantto keep thenickname Little Quakers, well,
its just going to be really confusing and everything, you know, when the mascots get together
on the football field, you see, they will justlook
all alike and all and the fans might get really
confused, then we won't even know who is
ahead and all, and that's justnot my idea of fun.
Do you see what I mean?" Instead of trying to
reason with the IvyLeague, theroundtable committee has decided that starting next season
S warthmore will don the nicknameof the future:
the Arrogant Pride; believing that the name
sounds very similar to Crimson Tide. Anyway,
the tool who is responsible for coming up with
the new nickname reportedly believes he is
Buddha and has started a cult in Tooele, Utah,
that will rival Koresh's compound in Texas.
The Ivy League's second demand is that
Swarthmore must meet the minimum
enrollementfigures for Division I schools. That
means that Swat has to increase its enrollment
with a heinously large freshmanclass next year.
That, and not the number of transfers from the
college, is why the school is pushing enrollment
to 1600 students next year. Thus, the use of
Willets and Danawell's "Lower Levels" next
year is a consequence of this agreement.
With the college's new found emphasis on
athletics, a significant portion ofthe endownment
will be used to build a new we'ight room, hardwood basketball floor, and speed-skating oval.
The new facilities will be placed where Mertz
Lawn, Old Tarble, and four acres of deciduous
forest in the Crum are currently located.
Haverford College, once againproving its
safety school status, attempted to join Swat in
the jump from the Centennial Conference into
the Ivy League. However, the Ivy League
denied their application on the grounds that
"Haverford does not have a football, swimming
or varsity badminton program. Furthermore,
theprograms that currently exist are infested by
athletes that just don't belong in major college
athletics." Too bad for Haverford.
Swarthmore looks forward to therecruiting benefits Division I status will provide. The
infamous Dick "Lefty" Vitale and "Super" Bob
system, first employed at Rutgers College in the
70's, will be used to lure the best athletes. You
see, if theathletes are willing to compete for two
athletic programs at Swat, they can garner two
one-halfcost scholarships to pay for their education. Swarthmore's Athletic Director Robert E.
Williamsrecalls that, "Thereal fun comes when
one coach screws another and the athlete plays
only one sport."
So, the legacy ofthe Swarthmore-Haverford
era will come to a close. The Hood Trophy will
be left on the shelf to rust away at the whim of
timeimmortal. The schools, have each searched
for a separate path and have finallyfound them.
The Centennial Conference and the MAC, disused and abused, will rot in the ruin they have
become, and the Ivy League will now open its
arms to the might of the Swarthmore College
Arrogant Pride.
