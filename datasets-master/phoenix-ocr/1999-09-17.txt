Alpha Phi Alpha joins ranks
of fraternities on campus
Bt Drew Adams
For The Phoenix
When posters advertising a party spon-

sored by Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.
started showing up around campus last
week, many students shared the same reIt's
action: Alpha Phi Alpha?
Swarthmore's newest fraternity, and al-

though you may not recognize the name
now, it should become more familiar as
the year wears on.
Last March, two students, William Williams 'O2 and Richard Favors 'O2, were inducted into the Psi Chapter of the Alpha
Phi Alpha fraternity, the historically black
intercollegiate fraternity that once
counted Martin Luther King, Jr. and
Thurgood Marshall as brothers. Swarthmore is the newest addition to the Psi
Chapter's membership, which already includes students from Drexel, Haverford,
Villanova, St. Joseph's, and UPenn.
Although the Swarthmore portion of
the Chapter is only in its formative stage,
Williams hopes it will catch on with students. "We want Alpha Phi Alpha to be a
recognizable name, like DU and Phi Psi,"
he said. In order to gain some of that name
recognition, the Psi Chapter sponsored
"Ice Storm on the Mainline," last Friday's
party in Upper Tarble.
Williams was quick to downplay the
event, though, calling it "just introducing
ourselves to the campus" and predicting
that the next Alpha Phi Alpha party
wouldn't be held untilDecember or January.

Caught on television

The true focus of the fraternity, he said,
is best reflected in its motto: Manly
deeds, Scholarship, and Love for All Mankind. With that in mind, Williams and
Favors are planning several events on
campus, starting with a community service event which, although not yet scheduled, should take place in the near future.
In the past, Alpha Phi Alpha has been involved in causes as diverse as Habitat for
Humanity, voter registration, sex education, and blood drives.
Williamsalso cited future plans to bring
lecturers or guest speakers to campus.
Possibly the largest benefit to students
is the Psi Chapter's connection to other
local colleges. According to Williams,
"Swarthmore students have an open invitation to any Alpha Phi Alpha event at
any of the other Phi Chapter schools,
whether that means a party, a community
service event, or a guest lecturer."
He hopes students will take advantage
of that, and says his organization aims
both to help Swatties venture out to other
local colleges and to increase the College's
name recognition in the Philadelphia
area.
All in all, Williams says he sees the potential for Alpha Phi Alpha "to do a lot of
positive things on campus." Anyone interested in joining the Psi Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha is encouraged to contact
either of the current members for information concerning an upcoming membership meeting. For further information,

Haverford begins examining alcohol on campus
Five

college students suffered from alcohol poisoning after parties in first two weeks of year

By Joseph Badtke-Berkow
and Sasha Rieders
Bi-Co News
In the first two weeks of

school, there have already been

five alcohol poisonings on
Haverford's campus. The first
occurred during Customs Week
which is technically alcohol free.
A freshman was found very sick
by his customs person after a
Yarnall party. The Bi-College
News was unable to confirm if
the individual was sent to the
hospital.
Two upperclassmen became
very ill subsequent to the Lloyd
"Around the World" party that
took place during the first week
of school. Neither of the poisonings were "official" since the students were not sent to the hospital by Safety and Security. One
of the students opted to stay in
his room and the other voluntarily went to the hospital.
The last two poisonings came
after another Lloyd party that
was held last Thursday.
The event was not an "Around
the World," party organizers purchased four kegs that were open
to revelers who had contributed
to the Haverford Social Fund.

Two freshmen became very sick
after the party and were sent to
the hospital by Saftey and Security.
Referring to the incidents last
Thursday Student Council CoPresident Jesse Ehrenfeldcalled
on the student body to take more
responsibility for the safety of
fellow party goers. "We are
never going to have a zero-statistic and I don't think that it is
really important to dwell on
that," said Ehrenfeld. "There
were 50 to 100 people at Lloyd
and nobody cut these kids off. I
think that a lot of these problems
could be averted if party hosts
would be a little more willing to
cut people off. It doesn't take
much to say noto someone."
Members of the administration recognized that alcohol poisonings are often more common
early in the year when levels of
academic stress are lowest. In
addition, Dean of the College Joe
Tolliver called the beginning of
the semester a "dangerous time"
because upperclassmen are seeing their friends again and freshmen are experiencing college
parties for the first time.

"While most Haverford students

Haverford creates draft report on campus diversity

By Joseph Badtke-Berkow
Bi-Co News

A draft of the diversity report

requested by Haverford's Board
of Managers last semester has

been completed and is being presented to several campus focus
groups before being sent for review by the board. The report is
the product of the renewed debate on diversity at the college
spawned by student petitions,
demonstrations, and the resignation of
the Office of
Multicultural Affairs (OMA)
chief, deanRamien Pierre.
The 37 page report, edited by
the Director of Athletics and
Associate Dean of the College
Greg Kannerstein, represents a
description of the current state
of Diversity programs at the col
lege and a broad range of goals
and proposed programs. Previous attempts by the college, specifically plans put into place in

response to a 1971-1972 boycott
of college diversity pollicies,
concentrated on making small
changes one at a time. The current report calls for a wide range
of changes and improvements in
many areas of college life.
"You don't make a change by
creating a new office, you need
to get at the central processes of
the college," said Kannerstein.
"We are hoping to have a lot going on in a lot of areas."
Among these areas are admissions, administration of the
OMA, athletics, and the academic program. This year minorities represent 26 percent of
the incoming freshman class, the
largest percentage of students of
color in the history of the college.
New admissions programs include the designation of Atlanta,
Los Angeles and Miami as "targeted" cities for minority recruitment, increased presence at
inner-city college fairs, and more

ties between the OMA and the
admissions office. A new admissions officer has alsobeen hired
to deal specifically with the recruitment and retention of minority students.
After extensive criticism inside and out of the OMA last
year, the office has been restructured in attempts to make it
more visible and more affective.
Former director Ramien Pierre,
who resigned at the end of last
year, cited the lack of staff and
resources as explanations for an
ineffective office.
Pierre has been replaced by
Sunni Green Tolbert who has received much acclaim from the
administration. Tolbert's position has been revamped to allow
more time for the OMA in her
schedule. A new position has
been added to the office as well,
Coordinator of Multiculturalaffairs. The college is currently
conducting a search to fill the

The 37 page report,

Dean of the College
Greg Kannerstein,
represents a description
of the current state of
Diversity programs at the
college and a broad range
of goals and proposed
programs.
new position.
The athletic department, citing the low participation rate by
athletes of color is introducing
several new programs to attract
minority students.
The department will focus on
recruiting from schools with
large minority athlete populations, will hold a Bi-College Recruiting Workshop, and lead
"Discussions of racial/ethnic
situations in new Athletic Leadership Institute this fall for captains and team leaders."
The changes to Haverford's
academic program were not the
focus of the report. The introduction explains that the "composition of the faculty and content and pedagogy in instructional offerings" are not directly
tackled due to the immensity of
the task.
Kannerstein called changes to
the curriculum the "big topic"
and explained that the issue was
too complicated to be properly
addressed in the report.
Curricular changes have
proven to be the most controversial issues facing colleges as
they move towards a more multicultural future. Haverford is
faced with the challenge of keeping the entrenched elements of
its curriculum that have made it
the successful academic institution that it isand simultaneously
adjusting that curriculum to
meet the changing expectations
of academic circles and society
at large. Traditionally the
school's curriculum was intensely conservative in nature.
In the 1950s the college was

ranked the number one men's
college in the nation largely due
to firm connections to traditional
curriculum.
"[Minorities] were told that
their past was not lonely irrelevant but inferior," said
Kannerstein who himself is a
Haverford Graduate. "You were
being told youire your past was
inauthentic."
Although this attitude has
changed immensely in the last 30
years, Haverford is being forced
to hold on to the traditions, both
curricular and social, that have
made it what it is and embrace
the changes to its foundational
principles that must define the
institution in the coming century.
The administration is careful
to point out that by no means is
the report an attempt to resolve
all of the problems regarding diversity that the college faces.
According to President Tritton,
in its broadest sense the report
represents the emergence of a
vital dialogue on diversity. However, it does outline the specific
actions that the college is taking
in order to resolve some of the
problems that exist. "The basic
message is that we are doing
things," said Tritton. "We have
talked enough and now it is time
to act."
In the coming week members
of the administration, faculty,
and student body, will be participating in a series of meetings designed to gaugeresponses to the
proposed plans and possibly incorporate suggested changes

before the report is mailed to the
Board of Managers sometime
next week.
Kannerstein believes that the
proposal represents the renewed
attention that is being placed on
issues of diversity that are absolutely necessary to the future
of the college.
He reminds Haverford that
this is an effort that involves
everyone, not just college organizations dealing with diversity
or minority students themselves.
The burden is on all members of
the community to make the vision of a truly diverse community at Haverford a reality. Says
Kannerstein, "It is on the college
to do all this: the administration,
the white students, everyone."

A DU meeting on Tuesday will

DU president Mike Lloyd said
thatthere were receipts for most
of the party's expenses, and that
any other debt will be absorbed
into the fraternity's budget.
"We do have some liquidity,"
Lloyd said.
Recently, students have expressed concern about false receipts being presented to committee members for studentfunded parties, especially following the Margaritaville incident.
However, neither the Student
Council nor the Student Budget

take the issue on.

"This was a very messy situation and the energy it wouldtake

not justified by the returns, either financial or moral," Bess
said. "While I still thinkthat SBC

It would be disastrous to pick
apart the entire sequence of

bridge."

'Alfred' serves up Hors d'Oeuvres

By Jessica Sonnenschein
For The Phoenix

As a result of his auspicious
debut at the conference of the
American Association of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Alfred,
a penguin-shaped autonomous
robot, has received invitations to
three events in the near future.
Designed this summer by a team
of two Swarthmore faculty
members and seven students,
Alfred combines vision, speech,
and navigation skills to serve
hors d'oeuvres without any human direction.Alfred's presence
has been requested by the
alumni council for their dinner
on October 22, by the Shay Eye
Institute for their Odyssey 2000
on October 29, and by DARPA
for their meeting about tactical
mobilerobots on October 19.
DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, is a government organization tasked with awarding
grants for research. Having
heard of Alfred, the Agency
asked that he serve hors
d'oeuvres at a robotics conference and will fly two faculty
members and four students to
Texas for the privilege.
At the AAAI conference, held
in late July in Orlando, Florida,
the autonomous robot built by
faculty
and students of
Swarthmore College won, as one
of its creators put it, "everything."
More precisely, this penguinshaped robot, anthropomorphically dubbed Alfred, bested robots designed by teams of graduate students to take first prize in
the hors d'oeuvres serving competition and won in addition an
independent award for the integration of various functions. A
feat almost unprecedented in the
history of the conference, it
forced the judges to reorganize
the presentation of the prizes.
Although the rules stated that
prize robots would be awarded
to the first and second place finishers in each section of the competitions, the judges chose not to
give the Swarthmore team two
prizes, and to instead bestow one
upon the third place team in the
hors d'oeuvres serving section.
Alfred's successes resulted from ten weeks of work
by a team comprising two members of the Swarthmore faculty,
Bruce Maxwell and Lisa
Meeden, and seven Swarthmore
students: Laura Brown 'OO, Paul
Dickson 'OO, Jane Ng 'Ol, Seth
Olshfski 'OO, Nii Saka Addo 'O2,
Eli Silk 'Ol, and Jordan Wales 'Ol.
According to Oshof ski, Alfred
is built on a pioneer robot, a computer that has wheels, sonar sensors, input and output capabilities, and a linux operating system. To create this complex final product, the team divided the

and construction
task of
into three areas of specialization:
vision (Dickson, Ng, and Silk),
speech (Olshofski and Addo),
and control (Brown and Wales).
In order for Alfred to
serve hors d'oeuvres, those in
charge of vision had to create a
method by which he could find
not only large groups of people,
but also individual faces. Groups
he detects by motion, but faces
demand a more elaborate system.

The final design consists of a
single color camera from which
Alfred creates color histograms
of the people he views through
his camera's lens. The designers
made Alfred learn to compare
each new histogram to a database of pictures, so that he has
the potential to recognize people.
If he does match the person in
front of him to a stored image,
he can modify his behavior to a
method of interaction appropriate to that particular human.
The vision team also brought
a sense of humor to their task.
They endowed Alfred with a system of protecting his hors

ognizing her ribbon and thinking
her a competitor, Alfred addressed her withthe sarcasm he
reserved for such people:
"You're a competitor," he told
her. "There are one thousand
horrible things I could say about
you, but I'll hold my tongue."
Luckily for the Swarthmore
team, said Olshofski, "she was
appalled and stunned, but incredibly happy. All she and her
son could talk about for the rest
of the conference was that the
"You're a competitor," he robot
had insulted her." This intold her.'There are one cident so impressed her son the
judge that when awarding the
thousand horrible things
prizes, he identified the first

I'll hold my tongue."
To enable Alfred not only to
insult people, but also to carry
on more polite forms of convertors through a ribbon identification that all contenders had to sation, the speech team used
IBM's ViaVoice™ software, a
wear. Upon spotting such a ribbon, Alfred would spew insults speech recognition engine. They
at the competitor unfortunate had to create a speech tree for

can respond both physically and

judges' mothers attended the unpredictable humans. Alfred

praised as "an incredibly good

The third component, control,
consists of two facets: providing
for Alfred's navigation abilities,
and integrating these with his
vision and speech. This integration, according to Meeden,
proved the most difficult part of
the process, "much more complex than doing any [of the three
pieces] alone." While each system may work independently,
problems inevitably arise in trying to make them function together.
"Robots, hardware entities,"
Meeden explained "can be really
frustrating. When they don't
work, you have nothing to show."
Alfred had to serve hors
d'oeuvres flawlessly, which required a seamless integration of
his vision, speech, and move-

Plant sale to showcase Arboretum collection, raise money
From PLANTS, pg. I
ies of plants started arriving on
the field by the truckload on
Tuesday. As many as 200 volunteers worked day and night
throughout the week in both setting up and guarding the area.
The sale will specialize in rare
and unusual plants, as well as
"collections" (different types
that go well together), says Sanders. The 4000 varieties of plants,
explains Necaise, have been divided by category: perennials,
those that regrow themselves
every year; and woodies, anything that has wood (including
trees and shrubs).
The sale will offer more than
just plants, however. Pots, trellises, bird houses and baths, and
even books are among the nonhorticultural offerings. Work
from local artists will be available, as well, as will products
hand-crafted especially for the
show. Of notable interest is work
from Guy Wolff, a nationally renowned potter, who will spin pots
which shoppers can buy.
Despite the sale's prominence,
though, not everyone is content
with its location. Rhiana Swartz
'OO, co-captain of the women's
rugby team, notes that rugby
players have less than half a
field on which to practice this
week. She adds that the women's
team will play their only home
divisional game tomorrow on the
Frisbee field (between Magill
Walk and Mertz dorm) with
makeshift goal posts.
Both Swartz and Claire Sawyers, Director of the Scott Arboretum, admit there was a miscommunication about the sale
between the two parties. According to Swartz, the women's rugby
team did not realize it would lose
half of its playing field until receiving an all-campus e-mail

Necaise on September 8. By that
time, she says, it would have

Sawyers cites difficulty in

have been lost in the shuffle of

the ordeal, though, "We don't really have hardfeelings about it,"
says Swartz.

Chau finds herself subject of television documentary
views that she has given.
While perhaps not totally
groundbreaking by Swarthmore
standards, Chau did something
exceptional for a student from
Hong Kong, a city often associated with high-powered financiers and ruthless capitalists.
After graduation, at which
point she had been accepted by
Swarthmore but had deferred
admission for a year, Chau spent
six months teaching at a remote
and underdeveloped village by
the name of Liannan, located in
neighboring Guangdong province.
For five straight months,
Chau taught fourth-, fifth- and
sixth-graders art and music at
a primary school bereft of even
the most basic resources (at one
point Chau had to import construction paper from home).
The conditions, needless to say,
were a far cry from the modern
comforts ofmaterial-rich Hong
Kong.

Chau had to trek over a hill to
go to the bathroom. Her diet was
reduced to rice, noodles and
some staple vegetables; meat
dishes were only prepared for

special occasions and even then
parsimoniously.
Before taking a shower, she
had to gather enough wood, boil
water over a traditional stove
and let it cool down. The electricity supply was inconsistent,
so from time to time she had to
read under the candlelight. For
Chau, network congestion was
the last thing on her mind.
On top of all these adjustments, Chaualso struggled with
the language. "At first my Mandarin (the universal Chinese
dialect) was not very good at
all," she said. "It was a big blow
to me."
After returning to Hong Kong
in March, Chau embarked on a
lecture tour of Hong Kong
schools, sharing her experience
withfellow students and raising
awareness of poverty-stricken
schools in China. In a land with
the highest per-capita population of Rolls Royces, where
Prada bags are more prolific
than Fruit-of-the-Loom T-shirts,
Chau's story was like a breath
of fresh air.
And the scandal-driven Hong
Kong media whose sensationalistic front-page stories often
are the stuff of horror movies
soon began to take notice.
While she was in China, sev-

eral local newspapers and two
television stations had already
interviewed Chau. In Hong
Kong, her story was picked up
by all the major Chinese and
English newspapers.
It is at this point that the story
caught the attention of RTHK,
a publicly funded station, and
one of the city's most respected.
RTHK happened to be experimenting with a new documentary concept called "Video Letters," and Chau's story fit the
bill perfectly. The goal of "Video
Letters," according to producer
Wong Fan, is to "flush out the
meaning behind certain relationships."
In this case, Wong wanted to
explore and continue the relationship between Chau and her
students in Liannan. It is also
meant to provide a form of direct communication between
two parties when communication is far and between, said
Wong.

The concept introduces an interactive element into the traditional documentary format as
well. For example, before coming to Swarthmore, the RTHK
crew spent time filming in
Liannan, the Chinese village
where Chau taught, and brought
the footage to the States. The
footage was then showed to
Chau, at Swarthmore, and her
responses were recorded on
film. The crew also brought actual letters from Chau's students.
Likewise, the crew will return
to China and show the footage
they shot of Swarthmore to
Chau's students at Liannan and
solicit their reactions as well.
So besides filming Chau's responses to the Liannan footage,
the main duty of the crew was
to document her life at Swarthmore.
On Friday afternoon, barely
recovered from a cross-pacific
journey, the crew swept into action at Sharpies, filming her at
lunch. On Saturday, she was allowed a rare breather during
the day, but the crew returned
in the evening to film her going
to bed.
On Sunday, the crew followed
her most of the day, even filming her while she took part in the
Mertz/Willets barbecue. Monday and Tuesday were spent
filming Chau in her classes. And
all her media responsibilities
had clearly taken their toll. "I
get tired from time to time," she
said. Since April, near the conclusion of her speaking tour,
"every speech I gave seemed
like a rehearsal," she noted.
Nonetheless, Chau was more
enthusiastic about this interview than others because of its
innovative format. "Unlike
other interviews where they
asked me to recap what happened during my six months [in
Lianan]," she said, "this interview looks forward, rather than
looking back [at the past]."
Chau, though, was also
cognisant of the limitations of
the project. "I don't think they
will understand a lot of things
they see [of Swarthmore]," she
said, referring to the stark contrast between her own background and her students'. The
one highlight of Sunday was discovering the gigantic globe in
McCabe, something she thought
her students would appreciate.
But the intense media scrutiny was not without its benefits,
either. After reading a journal
entry written by one of her students in which the student expressed her worries about financing a secondary education,
Chau was inspired to set up a
scholarship fund that would allow capable students to further

their education.
Her initial goal was to raise
$40,000 Hong Kong dollars,
roughly USD $5OOO. Expecting
an uphill battle, Hofan did her
homework thoroughly. But in
the end it wasn't necessary.
"I had conjured all these
fundraising ideas," said Chau,
"but then one day Apple Daily
(a Hong Kong newspaper that
also covered Chau's story) gave
me a call and told me someone

ing plans in her application for
deferral, Associate Dean of Admissions Susan Untereker was
so impressed that she nominated her for a Lang Opportunity Scholarship for Social Action, a scholarship given to a
select group of admitted students who, during their high
school career have demonstrated a commitment to "social
action and community service,"
which she was awarded in due
course.

In fact, Hofan's recent stint in
China is just the latest example
of her longstanding interest in
social and environmental issues. Her resume already reads
like that of the quintessential
Swarthmore student activist.
In addition to numerous community service commitments,
she worked extensively for the
Hong Kong branch of Friends of
the Earth; she also wrote a
weekly column on environmental issues for the leading Hong
Kong English daily, South China
Morning Post. She lives in a
household that practices socalled "green convictions"
one that is vegetarian and both
TV- and microwave-free.
Chau's activist background is
unusual for an international student, and especially for a stu—

dent from Hong Kong, a place
more famous for its Jackie Chan
martial arts flicks.
"She is different in her culture, in her awareness of social
and political issues," recalled
Assistant Dean of Admissions
Cathy Tak, who sits on the Lang
committee.
While Swarthmore boasts a
considerable international
population, it is still largely unknown outside of the US, let
alone in name-conscious Hong
Kong, although the number of
applications from the territory
has risen in recent years.
The documentary, which will
air during primetime in Hong
Kong, will give the college rare
exposure in a still-relatively-untapped region. "Hopefully it will
help our efforts to make Swarthmore better known in Hong
Kong and the rest of Asia," said
Director of the Office of News
and
Information
Tom
Krattenmaker.
Chau, who turned down an offer from Oxford's Queen's College, first learned of Swarthmore during a Bryn Mawr interview. The interviewer, surprisingly, told her that "she would
be happy at Swarthmore."
Given her track record, one can
only wonder why.

constant scrutiny

of the camera, Hofan Chau said she has enjoyed this particular interview format.

Throwing down the gauntlet
Given the college's supposed insulation from the outside world, it is often
amazing to what degree it is a microcosm of the nation as a whole. It
mirrors the characteristics and organization of the world around us: its
clearly defined communities, its mainstream and subcultures, right down to
its own flaccid legislature.
A miniature Congress, Student Council has suffered the same problems
our nation's Capitol faces
members protecting their own pet projects and
interests, dissent in the ranks and most of all, no plan for improving the
general welfare of its constituents.
It is in this respect that Student Council has most disappointed us over the
years. Rarely has the council done what it should do that is, to be a
lightning rod for student concerns and to organize large-scale action based
on those concerns (in other words, to be leaders). Instead, we have seen the
council plagued by resignations and petty bickering and watched it make
only small, trivial advances in student conditions on campus.
This year, we have a challenge for that august body
prove us wrong.
We want to see Jared Solomon and Nick Attanasio whipping hundreds of
students into a frenzy at a rally for a new student center. We want to take
pictures of Matt Schwartz and Rodney Morris shaking hands with Bob
Gross as they unveil a plan for bigger, better entertainment acts at Swat
and a new student stress counseling and support system.
Most of all, we want to see the members of Student Council working
together on issues that matter and getting the student body behind them. It
can start with yogurt machines and pinball proposals, but a time will come
when the council will have to step up to the big leagues.
So consider the gauntlet thrown. You can pick it up and try to dispel the
ghosts of councils past, or you can let us watch history repeat itself. The
choice is yours now.

Coercion doesn't score with us
You probably didn't notice the four words in yesterday's Weekly News,
because they were buried deep in the schedule of events for next weekend.
But better than even "Everyone should support football," they express the
administration's unrealistic inclination to unite the campus behind our
recently revived tradition.
The words "Sharpies will be closed" fit neatly between a pair of parentheses on Page 3 of the calendar this week, behind an event for 11 a.m. on
Saturday, September 25 on the baseball field: "Homecoming BBQ."
As we read it, someone in administration we're not sure who, since
unlike 69 other events listed this week, it does not name a sponsor
decided that holding a barbecue before the game with Gettysburg would
bring students to Clothier Field for Homecoming. They might have scored
with that strategy.
We noted in this space last week that we have nothing against the sport of
football or our classmates who like to play it and watch it. But we do not
believe the renewed emphasis on the Garnet Tide has the support of the
entire campus, and making attendance at the Big Game essentially mandatory by offering us our food there and only there goes too far.
Because there are students including some of us
who would enjoy
this barbecue, we wholeheartedly support the idea. But the fact is there are
others who do not want to go, and closing Sharpies as coercion will not score
points with them or change their attitudes about football here.
But more importantly, making anything tantamount to mandatory is
simply unacceptable at Swarthmore. There are no rules forcing you to
attend your classes every day or sleep in your bed every night, and no one
can force you to go to Worth when you're sick. The last mandatory Swarthmore activity you probably attended was the Safer Sex Workshop. Here,
students support activities that they enjoy but respect the right of others
not to be interested. We don't believe administrators would sponsor an allcampus barbecue before a performance of the Early Music Ensemble, and
no one has ever talked about a similar event for the much more successful
badminton, tennis or swim teams. What makes football, and only football,
deserve special treatment? Homecoming is traditional, but so is free choice.
If administrators are in favor of using more of our nearly $4OOO in annual
board costs to hold more barbecues, we are all for it. But they should be
held for academic as well as sporting events, for badminton as well as
football. They should be optional but well-promoted. Today's visit by James
Q. Wilson has had tremendous advance publicity, but for years Collection
has not been mandatory.
We suggest that Sharpies remain open for lunch on Sept. 25, as it does on
every other non-vacation day. If we weren't forced into it, you might find us
at the game. But we resent this attempt at coercion, especially since no one
was polite enough to ask, or even to inform the student body yet. We

To the Editor:
Towards the end of the Spring 1999 semester a number of incidents occurred that adversely affected SHIP, a student-run service
organization that is part of CIVIC. SHIP
an acronym for Serving Homeless Individuals in Philadelphia is comprised of a group
of students who are dedicated to helping
homeless people On the streets of Center City,
Philadelphia, largely through direct outreach
and open conversation. The goals of SHIP
are not only to meet immediate physical
needs, but to also establish a relationship with
the people visited each week and help direct
them to resources which may be useful, such
as shelters, healthcare services, rehabilitation centers, and employment programs.
Every Friday afternoon volunteers help to
prepare food bags in the Parrish North
Kitchen, which are then labeled and stored
in the refrigerator. On Saturday and Sunday
mornings, three or four students drive into
Philadelphia to distribute the food bags, coffee, blankets, and clothes to homeless individuals. Often as many as fifty or more individuals benefit from a given SHIP morning
"run." The individuals that are reached show
appreciation for the food that has been prepared and distributed weekly by SHIP volunteers.

Last Spring, some of the food needed for
SHIP was stolen. On the morning of Saturday, April 10,1999, a SHIP volunteer discovered that several of the food bags ready for
distributionto homeless individuals had been
raided. The remains of partially eaten sandwiches were scattered on the couch in the

Parrish Commons area adjacent to the Parrish NorthKitchen. On the following morning (April 11), upon return from a trip to
Philadelphia, SHIP volunteers found that several other food items had been removed from
the SHIP cabinet in the Parrish North
Kitchen. During the following week, some
of these food items were discovered in the
bathroom of the Parrish Commons. Containers of peanut butter and jelly were eaten out
ofand found smeared on the walls of the bathroom. Portions of a cake were found dumped
in the toilet.
At this point, SHIP volunteers decided to
move all foodstuffs to the Parrish East
Kitchen. However, this was not enough to
avoid yet another raid on SHIP food supplies.
On Sunday, April 17, a container ofSHIP food
was found almost completely eaten and was
consequently unfit for donation to either
homeless people on the street or a shelter.
Understandably, these incidents left the
SHIP volunteer community feeling baffled,
upset, and disappointed. While we are hopeful that such incidents will not happen again,
we believe that the Swarthmore community
should be aware of what happened. We would
like to stress that suchbehavior is not acceptable. SHIP will continue its activities on campus this semester, and we hope that the community will support us by respecting our
work, our resources, and our space.

Recreating the elite: Cultural Politics
HH-FANG "JENNY" YANG

static

This is my bi-weekly column called
"Static." Why "Static"? Two reasons: one,
I was inspired by an old The Daily of the
University of Washington column by
Michael Park called "Asiatic Static"
<http://www.nwlink.com/~park/
asiaticstatic.html>; and two, whether the
campus thinks so or not, we need to be
more conscious of the more subtle issues
of cultural politics.
My column will be similar to Michael
Park's, or the self-named "Twisted
Kimcheehead," in that my comments on
cultural politics can be on everything
from the way non-white females are portrayed in fashion magazines to the problems that my Christian friends may have
due to the culture of Swarthmore College.
Really, I have saved my last breath of
involvement as a senior at Swarthmore
College so that more people from this
community will have just one more reminder about why they need to be conscious of cultural politics. As political
science professor Cynthia Halpern vehemently reminds us, we are undergoing a

process of re-creating an elite. Someday,
I will meet you randomly in an office, I
will be your client, and you will be in a
position of decision-making power. That's
right. Every single one of you. And before you run off making your money or
gaining your power, I want my way with
you if I can. You will remember how the
many differentforms of cultural identity
influence our lives, how it is everywhere
and how it matters.
Accusation #1: This is politically-correct crap.
At times I may sound politically correct, but it's not crap. If you haven't already heard this reasoning, I'll repeat it
again and we can all go on with our lives.
Cultural diversity, in its ever-evolving
forms, is happening and at a quicker pace
than ever. We as future leaders, employees, civil adults, and humans should and
must deal with these changes. You'll be
better at your job and better as a person
(read: economic and moral incentives).
Accusation #2: Jenny is militant.
I won't front. I'm just about as interested in how cultural politics affects my
identity as I am about how it affects everyone else's lives. Through reconciling
how others read my identity and how I
understand myself I have been able to
learn a lot about different issues surrounding cultural politics. This may occur a few times in my future articles. Just
indulge me a little.
It is curious that I, of all people, would
be called "militant." On two separate occasions last semester, two people told me
that they had a conversation where I was

referred to as "militant." When I think
of "militant" I imagine combat fatigues
and a belligerent attitude. My entire
closet is full of Gap clothes and I would
consider myself rather friendly and pacifist.
It's a minor annoyance that strangers
pass judgement on me without personal
contact. But I can't help but think that it
had something to do with appearing more
opinionated and more abrasive than
people expected me to be—and the key
word being "expected." As an Asian female who could pass for discount youth
tickets at amusement parks if I squatted,
somehow others had a lower bar set for
determining my status as a "militant." I
thought about my higher campus profile
from being President of the Swarthmore
Asian Organization (SAO) and for participating in the "Respect, Safety, Unity"
Rally in the Fall of 1998 (for the firstyears' information, the rally was a huge
campus response to vandalism that occurred at the Intercultural Center). I concluded that being more visible in representing issues of multicultural politics
and being an Asian female made me that
much more susceptible to being "writtenoff as too "militant."
This little episode in my life reminded
me how I needed to stop "writing off" others when they don't meet my expectations
and to really listen to what they are saying. Perhaps you, the reader, will do this
for me in my future columns. Hopefully
reading through all my "static" can help
you to hear the sounds of cultural politics clearer in your everyday life.

International law arbitrary, ineffective
INTERNATIONAL

|

I

By David Ellis
For The Phoenix

"The only problem with international
law is that we are not willing to consistently enforce its provisions."
Howmany timeshave we heard liberal
Swatties complain about their set of laws
and ideals presented from heaven above
not being respected and followed? How
many times have we heard that if the
United States just got off its ass and enforced some international law, the world
would be a place of blissful happiness?
Unfortunately, proponents of enforcing
international law ignore one simple piece
of logic and philosophy that has been
agreed upon by virtually all democratic
philosophers through the ages.
A law isn't worth the paper it's written
on unless the means of enforcement are
expressed withinthe code. Consequently,
any enforcement of international law is
bound to be arbitrary.
When Serbia breaks international law
by expelling tens of thousands of Albanians from Kosovo, the United States
builds a coalition to bomb the hell out of
Serbia, using international law to legitimize its invasion of a sovereign, albeit
repugnantly acting, nation. But when Israel expels thousands of Palestinians, the
world does nothing. Why is this the case?
Because unlike all other legitimate systems of law, international law has little
deterrence value. Why should a nation
follow internationallaw ifbreaking it has
no clear consequence?
But a lack of a definite enforcement
mechanism is not the only reason why
international law does not meet the basic
prerequisites by which righteous and fanlaws are formulated. Any law that wishes
to be recognized as justified must have a
clearly defined manner of being passed
in a fair process. For example, the United
States clearly elucidates how a law should
be passed through the Constitution.
Unfortunately, there is no recognized
international mechanism by which a set
of ideals becomes law. International law
is passed in a rather cloudy manner.
Sometimes, a bunch of unelected, unaccountable intellectuals get together and
decide what's right and what's not. At
other times, various good-doers meet and
formulate a treaty and then proceed to
bully the rest of the world with their
higher morality into signing it.
Finally, for a law to be considered rightful, the people who make the law must be
held accountable to the population at

large. Clearly, much of the world's population does not live in a democracy. Why
should citizens of the United States allow
Chinese and Iraqi emissaries, entirely
unaccountable to their counties' populations, help formulate guidelines by which
United States citizens must live?
Because international law is fundamentally unsound, nations around the world
are under no legal obligation to follow
them, meaning thatother nations have no
legitimate recourse if a nationrefuses to
follow a treaty.
International law is disadvantageous
because of the way it is used, not just for
its philosophical shortcomings. Generally,
proponents of internationallaw are those
same manipulative buddies of ours who
also think that the United States does
mostly evil things and its power should
be limited.
An international tribunal would have
the capacity to convict United States soldiers, and it is likely that enemies of the
U.S. would, at times, be able to formulate
majorities and exploit sensitive situations. This would necessitate a U.S. withdrawal from overseas operations and
leave allies from Kuwait to South Korea
to Taiwan vulnerable. How long would it
be before these nations went nuclear?
International law has even been used
to affect domestic policy. The American
representatives involved in formulating
the Kyoto Treaty on global warming deliberately agreed to make the provisions
far more extreme than scientific evidence necessitates, and then attempted
to get the United States Congress to pass
these ridiculous provisions by exploiting
the United States' conscience and its feelings of leadership and morality.
There is no reason for the United States

How many times have we heard
that if the United States just got
off its ass and enforced some
international law, the world would
be a place of blissful happiness?
to sign treaties written by manipulative,

self-serving individuals intent on limiting
U.S. power. Rather, the United States
should seek to form its own laws through
the democratic process, and not put itself
subject to the will of dictatorships.
There are other ways of solving the
problems that internationallaw purports
to answer. Instead of the head of the War
Crimes Tribunal indicting Milosevic as a
war criminal with her higher sense of
morality, wouldn't it make more sense for
the Serbian people to charge him when
he is removed from power, thus allowing
the Serbs a sense of closure and justice
to this decade's nightmare? Instead of the
Nuremberg trials, wouldn't it have made
more sense to allow the Germans to
charge and try their despicable leaders
themselves, thus eliminating criticism of
a victor's peace? And doesn't it make
more sense for sovereign nations to act
cooperatively and willfully to formulate
effective countermeasures to evil in this
world, as opposed to pretending that international law can be effective?
For better or worse, the United States
operates through the democratic process,
and its moral power should not be eliminatedby other less free nations. The time
has come to recognize the shortcomings
of internationallaw, and realize that concepts such as sovereignty are not transient, but are actually the best way to ensure that the world continues to strive
towards freedom.

Strange ideas
in education
It doesn't take much to know that
American schools are in poor shape. Test
scores are going down, and dropout rates
are going up. Recent studies comparing
American students to those in other industrialized countries show kids here falling way behind.
So educators (and non-educators) all
over the country are seeking the perfect
solution to our educational woes. Needless to say, no one has found it.
In SAT land, the Educational Testing
Service (ETS) has been thinking about
changing the scoring system of their standardized tests to reflect more than the
"scholastic aptitude" of test-takers. Under the so-called Strivers system, students from socio-economic and racial
groups prone to lower test scores will
receive point-boosts from ETS to reflect
their disadvantage, thereby lending more
"equality" to the standardized testing process.
Another unexpected approach to education reform has been taken up in the
Denver public schools, where an experimental pilot program will assign teachers' salaries based upon the standardized
test scores of their students. The idea
here is that teachers will teach better
knowing that their salaries depend upon
student performance.
Finally, school vouchers are becoming
increasingly popular around the United
States. The concept has been around
awhile, but few states have adopted it.
Now, it's a significant issue in almost every election. The idea is that the state will
give each public school student a voucher
worth several thousand dollars that can
be used at an alternative, non-public
school. Public schools, forced to "compete" withvoucher schools, will either be
forced to improve or collapse.
Regrettably, these three ideas—SAT
Strivers, performance pay and vouchers
are missing the mark in educationreform.
They are based upon notions of education
that Americans take for granted, but really don't hold water. Many of the principles upon which thesereforms are based
are simply not applicable.
The SAT Strivers program, which ETS
is quickly backing away from, attempts
to quantify overall merit in one number.
Pretending that test scores are unrelated
to social background is silly, and so ispretending that the two are related by the
function y x 200. Universities that
know what SAT scores mean also know
that merit isn't a number, and that learning has nothing to do with merit.
In Denver, where teachers will be paid
according to the test performance of their
students, the board of education relies
upon the same incentive system that
gives construction workers bonuses if
they finish their projects on time. But
schools are not factories, and teachers do
not produce test scores in the same way
that bakers produce bread. If it were that
easy, we'd all be geniuses and our teachers would be rich.
Finally, vouchers won't save our
schools, because schools don't "compete"
with each other. Education isn't like WalMart vs. Target, where companies provide better services so they can make
money and survive. Unless we want our
schools to become corporations following
the bottom line, we should treat them like
schools, not AT&T.
The fact is, the policy-makers who are
at the helm of education reform come
from worlds where market-based principles yield success, and they don't realize that schools are not stock markets.
Learning came along before the "new
economy," so it's time to look beyond
market-based principles in the search for
meaningful education reform.

By Ben Schweigert

For The Phoenix

"I did not have sexual relations with
that woman (Monica Lewinsky)."
I did not discuss clemency for terrorists with that woman (Hillary Clinton).
Sound familiar? In yet another example of a gross misuse of power, our
most honorablePresident has once again
prostituted himself for base political interests. What is particularly incensing
about this latest violation is that the man
(if he can indeed be deemed as such) released convicted criminals in order to
help his wife secure a job in NewYork. A
strong Hispanic vote is deemed vital to
her election and the move was a transparently orchestrated attempt to curry
favor with New York's one million plus
Puerto Ricans.
Never mind that every law enforcement agency in the country opposed the
move. Worse yet, the Bureau of Prisons
cited tapes in which several of the terrorists were secretly recorded planning a return to violence in their cells.
Even as those who have traditionally
supported the Clintons hesistated to support the controversial move, the President took another extraordinarily outrageous step, suggesting that the prisoners
had been wrongly convicted "in effect by
guilt of association."
Regarding these terrorists, let's get the
facts straight right now—they are as clear
as they are repulsive. These so-called "independence fighters" were convicted of
illegally transporting firearms and explosives for FALN, a Puerto Rican terrorist
group responsible for 130bombings that
killed six and maimed scores more.
Alas, as Clinton suggests, these people
aren't so bad—they didn'tblow anyone up.
All they did was provide the bombs.
What's the big deal?
All Terry Nichols did was help make the
bomb, right? It's not as if he actually
drove that Ryder truck up to the federal
building in Oklahoma City. And what
about MarkManes ofColorado? Sure, he
provided the Columbine killers with a
Tec-9 machine pistol, but he never fired
it himself. Why aren't these not-so-bad
guys being released? I mean, we need
more room in the jails anyway—if the
President moves now, the paperwork can
be processed in a matter of days.
Perhaps the most sickeningly ironic
and profound aspect of this entire circus
is that in releasing the terrorists, Clinton
has actually betrayed some of his own
supposed ideals. This was the same man
who, in the wake of the recent gun violence, screamed for increased restrictions and tougher penalties. That was, of
course, as long as it was politically convenient. This champion of gun-legislation
has now turned around and released terrorists convicted of illegally smuggling
firearms across state lines. The only
sense of poetic justice that can be derived
from this entire farce is that Hilary so
misread the public attitude that the clemency will probably end up hurting her
campaign more than anything else.
As many people now say, what else did
you expect from Clinton, right? It is a
travesty to our national self-image that
we are led by a political animal who has
so prostituted himself that it seems impossible that he can walk straight. I sincerely pray that I am not the only one who
believes that America can and must try
better than that. Truly, I long for the day
that I do not have to lament that I have
more respect for a cockroach than I do
for the President of the United States of
America.

There is no question that gun violence is an important safety
issue in the United States. From high-profile incidents like the
Columbine massacre to the largely overlooked violence that
plagues every inner city in the country, people in this country
must live with the reality that in more than 30 percent ofhouseholds, someone has the power to take lives with ease. We live in
a country with incredibly weak and poorly enforced gun laws.
There is no federal agency whose job it is to regulate guns.
There is no gun licensing in the United States. Though the government regulates everything from hair-dryers to stuffed animals for consumer safety and hands out licenses for everything from fishing to driving, we have no counterpart regulation on devices whose sole purpose is to kill.
This lack of gun laws makes a difference. According to the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, more than one-half
of the guns used in crimes were legally purchased from a licensed dealer. According to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,
children in the United States are 12 times more likely to be
killed by a gun than are children in the rest of the industrialized world, and people of all ages are three times as likely.
In fact, the death rate from guns in the United States is third
in the world behind Brazil and Jamaica. And it is not that the
rest of the world's countries necessarily have less crime. Rather,
the crimes that are committed do not become fatal because there
is no firearm involved. Seattle and Vancouver are three hours
apart by car, are culturally similar, and have comparable rates
of robbery, burglary, and the like. Nevertheless, the people of
Seattle are five times more likely to be killed by a gun than
their counterparts in British Columbia.
But it is unlikely that new gun laws alone would solve the
problem. We also need stronger enforcement of existing gun
laws regarding who can sell guns and to whom. Recently, victims of gun violence across the country have become aware of
their right to sue gun manufacturers and distributors over the
sale and marketing of their product. In a ruling handed down
February 11, it was ruled that 15 of 25 gun manufacturers negligently marketed and distributed their product, leading to a
situation in which many guns fell into the hands of youths, criminals, and unlicensed distributors.
Gun violence is a problem of huge proportions in America.
But with determined grassroots action and persistent civil litigation, we can overcome the big-money interests of the gun
lobby and make our streets a little safer for all of us.

It's Friday morning, and once again, the government has issued a statement about how truly helpless and stupid Americans are. The government has taken no action to prevent states
from suing gun manufacturers for damages incurred when an
illegally obtained gun is used to commit a crime.
That's right, the courts have decided to allow states to sue
gunmanufacturers for selling guns.But wait, you say, isn't that
the gun manufacturers' job? I thought so too, but apparently
we were wrong. Just as so many years ago, I laughed when I
heard that someone was suing McDonald's because that person
had spilled coffee on himself. "What an idiot!" I said at the time,
sure that no jury would punish McDonald's for making hot coffee hot. Oh, those were the days of youthful optimism.
These new gun lawsuits are the same thing. By allowing states
to sue manufacturers for the products they legally produce,
the courts have opened Pandora's box. Soon, General Motors
may be held liable if a stolen car is used in a drunk driving
accident. "What a leap!" you laugh, wishing you could get some
hot coffee somewhere on a cold morning.
And it gets worse
there is even more at stake here than
just this lawsuit. In one instance, a New Jersey attorney is suing a Georgia manufacturer for a gun sold in South Carolina.
Under the old judicial rules, the lawsuit would take place in
South Carolina, the site of the sale. But currently, the suit will
go forward in New Jersey, a state far more hostile to the gunmanufacturing defendant. It is a clear violation of federalism
to be sued in a state to which you may have never been, for a
sale that happened five states away.
So what can be done? Congress could pass legislation that
allows states to impact laws and legislation within their borders, or the Supreme Court could wake up and start enforcing
150 years of legal tradition. Even if you don't approve of the
sale of guns, fine amend the Constitution.
But until such a time, how can a company be held responsible for how a gun is used? Last I checked, a gun itself has
never been accused of a crime
there has always been a person on the other end of the weapon. It's trite, but "guns don't
kill people, people kill people."
Maybe it is time Americans starting taking responsibility for
their own actions, rather than blaming the toaster manufacturer because they burned their hand or a door-makerbecause
they slammed their finger. Nah, on second thought, let's just
blame other people for our own actions.

GUEST OPINION

Mixing George W's public and
private life leads to hypocrisy
By Brian Dupre
Daily Texan (U.Texas-Austin)
(U-WIRE) —Being a cokehead 25 years
ago has nothing to do with one's qualifi-

being a
cations for the presidency
hypocrite as the current governor of
Texas does.
George W.'s "youthful indiscretions"
are innately a private matter, but combined with his Draconian drug policies as
governor, they take on a public relevance.
In 1997, Bush signed into law a harsh
measure that provides for jail time for
nonviolentfirst-timeoffenders convicted
of possessing less than 1/28 of an ounce
of cocaine. Previously, those offenders
were sentenced to mandatory probation.
Even worse, the GWB gutted a successful drug rehabilitation program for inmates begun under Gov. Ann Richards,
slashing the program from 14,000 slots
to 5,300. Bush stated, "Incarceration is rehabilitation."The facts prove otherwise,
however; the recidivism rate of inmates
who receive drug treatment in prison is
one-third that of those who don't. Considering that approximately 80 percent
of Texas prisoners have had problems
with drug or alcohol abuse, the need for
such programs is glaring.
Under the "compassionate conserva-

tism" of Bush's five-year stint as gover-

nor, taxpayers have spent $1.45 million

each day incarcerating adult drug offenders. The number of juveniles incarcerated for drug offenses has skyrocketed;
rather than divert youthful offenders
into treatment programs, Texas just locks
them away. And, under Bush's administration, funds for drug treatment were
taken away from the Texas Commission
on Alcohol and Drug Abuse and given to
prison system administrators to spend as
they pleased.
Bush's drug policies as governor speak
far more about his character than his
private behavior ever could. Bush took
the politically easy, even cowardly, road
to perpetuate our domestic "war on
drugs," and there's every indication he
would continue down that road as president.
Instead, Bush should have used his personal experiences with alcohol, and perhaps cocaine, to guide a fair and intelligent drug policy for those who don't
have rich, influential fathers to guard
them from potential prosecution.
As the presidential campaign heats up,
it's important to draw a clear distinction
between private and public morality.
Bush's failings in the former area aren't
the issue; his hypocrisy in the latter is.

Student Council convened for its second meeting of the year Tuesday in Parrish Parlours, setting goals for the

By Sonia Scherr
For The Phoenix
Midway through Student Council's
meeting Tuesday night, Co-Chair and
Observer to theBoard of Managers Matt
Schwartz 'Ol announced that the council needed a new name. He stated that
"council" implies a small, select group
of people who meet in a secret location
to make decisions affecting an entire
community. Although the council did not
discuss further a possible name change
at last night's meeting, Schwartz's suggestion is in many ways symbolic of the
council's goals for the semester. While
no one can deny thatthe council is small
and select, it hopes to dispel the widespread belief on campus that it has little
connection to the larger student body.
"Student Council needs to become relevant and take on large issues that affect everyone. [We need to] earn the respect of the faculty and administration,"
Schwartz said after the meeting. He believes that the council should accomplish
this goal by making major policy decisions. "I want to make Student Council
more than Government 101 for aspiring
lawyers and policy makers," said
Schwartz. "[lt should become a council]
for people interested in improving the
school."
Fellow co-chair and Charter Committee chair JaredSolomon 'Ol expressed a
similar sentimentfollowing the meeting.
"Student Council has two major responsibilities: We need to represent the
student body...[and we need] to take
active stands within the community,"
Solomon said.
Student Council's goals for the semester reflect Schwartz's and Solomon's
view that the organization needs to become a true representative body. Because the council intends to focus on issues that directly impact student life,
one of its highest priorities is instituting better financial aid and fair wages
for student employees, according to the
co-chairs.
"Swarthmore has one of the lowest
wage structures compared to other
small, competitive colleges," Solomon
said.
Indeed, increasing student wages was
a personal goal of many council members, including Marvin Barron 'O2, representative to the College Budget Committee, who is "concerned" by the
college's policy of "a maximum work
week" that limits the number of hours
students receiving financial aid may
work. No such limitexists for non workstudy students, Barron said.
Increasing the quality and availability of student space, as well as bringing
in more prominent speakers and bands,
have also become pressing issues that
Student Council plans to address,
Schwartz and Solomon said.
As the representative to the College
Planning Committee, Nick Attanasio 'OO
aims to work for better student space
and entertainment.

"Swarthmore [compared to similar institutions] has one of the worst situations
in terms of space," Attanasio said. Moreover, he said students have lost space over
the years and current student space remains inadequate. "A student center
would make [Swarthmore] less depress-

ing," he said.
Student Council also hopes to increase
contact between students and administrators, perhaps through dinners at Sharpies,
Schwartz said.
TUesday night's meeting revealed that
many of these goals were being actively
pursued by Student Council members.
Schwartz reported that he is currently researching employee wages at Swarthmore
in order to propose higher student wages.
Moreover, after some debate about cost,
the Council voted to support Schwartz's
proposal that Student Budget Committee
allocate $6OOO to purchase, in the words
of Attanasio, "kick-ass" pinball machines.
Schwartz believes that these machines will
revitalize the student space in Tarble,
making it more than "just a place to eat."

"Student Council needs to
become relevant and take on
large issues that affect

everyone."
Nevertheless, the money for pinball

combined with a possible $22,000 to acquire a new van to replace 16A, the movie
shuttle
may contribute to an increase
in the Student Activity Fee.
In addition to the movie shuttle, Solomon
is organizing a shuttle route that would
bring students to and from Genuardi'sand
possibly Target two days a week. Solomon
also wants to set up dinner at Sharpies and
a fireside chat with Al Bloom. To promote
volunteerism and communication among
students, faculty and staff, Solomon has
spoken to Community Service Coordinator Pat James about establishing a campus-wide community service day. He has
also talked to the administration about
improving the lighting in Sharpies,
McCabe and Tarble, though he acknowledged that it was reluctant to make the proposed changes.
As for student space, Attanasio is in the
process of compiling a report on student
space at similar institutions. Attanasio will
use the report to gain clout with the administration and to increase student interest in the issue.
The council also voted to allow Kwabena
Adu 'Ol, chair of Appointments Committee, to make all appointments to college
committees one-year positions. The general consensus was that longer terms
would allow students to serve more productively on committees.
Despite theprogress being made on these
issues, the meeting also exposed a council
still grappling with many of the problems
that the campus community hasassociated
with it in the past, including its reputation
for inaction. A council committee, chaired

rest

of the fall

semester.

by Barron, had only just determined which
students wouldreceive parking permits,
a task that was supposed to havebeen completed last spring.
For a period of time during the meeting it appeared as though college committee appointments would also experience delay. Adu reported that thus far not
enough students had applied to college
committees to fill all openpositions. Some
council membersfelt that students might
not be aware of the appointments because
of a lack of publicity. While Barron suggested extending the deadline one week,
most council members argued that the
appointments must be made as soon as
possible in order to end the precedent set
by previous councils of continually delaying appointments. The council voted to
proceed with appointments as scheduled.
Nevertheless, this decision may mean
that the appointments process will be nonselective and that some positions will remain unfilled. Furthermore, because appointments will not occur for at least another week, many committees will be
forced to make major decisions with substantially fewer members than usual.
Student Council itself is missing two
members that were elected to serve this
fall. College Planning Committee representative Jenny Yang 'OO resigned for
personal reasons. Secretary Adam Kahn
'O2 has not returned to campus.
Turnover has been a constant problem
on Student Council, according to
Schwartz and Solomon.
If Student Council becomes more responsive to student needs, however, then
more people would serve for all four
years, said Schwartz.
Confusion among members about their
responsibilities on the councilis also is a
factor in the high turnover rate, according to Solomon. He hopes to make the
council more stable by clearly defining
expectations for each position and by having all members report to the co-chairs
each week.
Although Schwartz and Solomon admitted that the council's tarnished image is
"deserved," as with turnover, they hope
to address the problem by dealing with
issues that affect the student body.
Schwartz, who acknowledged that some
former councils have done little more than
"bicker," hopes that this council will earn
the respect of the campus community by
"doing things that need to be done." This
involves initiating real change in students'
lives, such as paying student employees
an extra $1.50 for research.
Solomon blamed negative perceptions
of Student Council in part on poor publicity. He also stressed that "Student
Council isabout work" and thatmembers
must invest time in the council activities
for the organization to be successful.
Indeed, the co-chairs emphasized that
they work well together, despite being
"opposites." Perhaps the more important
issue is whether Student Council itself
can forge a strong working relationship
with the college community to become a
powerful voice for the students it serves.

Stallone's acting
efforts receive
Hollywood cold
shoulder
Desperation is not terriblybecoming in
an action star. But in Susan Faludi's new
book, "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the Modern Man," Sylvester Stallone gets desperprecisely beate, and it's becoming
cause he no longer wants to be an action
star.

In a chapter entitled "Parting Shots,"
Stallone recounts to the author how his
attempts over the last few years to branch
out beyond his usual testosterone-enriched actionflicks have gotten him nothing but cold shoulders in Hollywood. Despite being critically lauded for his role
as an overweight, sad-sack small-town
sheriff in 1997's "Copland," Stallone found
himself totally unable to get work in the
kind of ensemble dramas he desired.
Even Miramax, that bastion of indie
cinema, tried to pressure him into doing
another Rambo sequel.
"I see everyone else working and I'm
doing dick. I'm in total limbo. I'm a man
without a country," he said. "After I made
'Copland,' all of Hollywood turned their
backs."
Stallone's actorly pretensions can be
best read in the ways he has always distinguished himself from Arnold
Schwartzenegger, even at the height of
their careers. Schwartzenegger always
had this air of self-parody about him, that
knowing wink, and the films that afforded
him the most cross-over success were
inevitably comedies that poked fun at his
image or his physique. He's a Reaganite
Republican married to a Kennedy, for
chrissakes. His commitment level to
irony is very high.
Stallone, on the other hand, always infrom Rocky
stilled in his characters
to Rambo to that trucker who armwrestled for his kid
a sense of pathos.
They were always haunted by or guilty
about something, and he took as their
spiritual forefathers the broken and
poorly mended men of noir, or maybe
Jimmy Stewart in "Vertigo." You could
always see him struggling to squeeze a
third dimension out of characters that
were engineered for their two-dimensionality
That's why Schwartzenegger flicks are,
as a rule, better than Stallone's
Schwartzenegger excelled at the movies
he knew he was making. Stallone was always handicapped by some image of the
films he thought he wanted to be making.
Because of that, he could never do things
quite right; everything was always just a
wee bit off.
Hell, when you see Stallone in any interview he always come off like a character in one of those 80s out-of-body
switcheroo farces (I'm thinking of the
Dudley Moore-Kurt Cameron classic
"Like Father, Like Son," or "Dream a
Little Dream," involving one Corey with
a broken leg and the other with Jason
Robarbs trapped inside him). You do a
double take.
You're fucking blown away by the fact
that this guy who made his millions on
monosyllables and muscles just seems so
urbane and sophisticated, so fucking
smart and self-aware. He talks about his
paintings; he tosses off anecdotes about
Rodin; he uses words you have to go and
look up. It's as if John Updike had somehow rubbed a genie's lamp and end up
walking around in Shaq's body. He acknowledges the success his physique has
brought him but likewise exposes the way
in its claustrophobia.

Four real live bands, barbecue
kick off Olde Club concert season
National, local indie rockers to play outdoor concert Saturday

afternoon

By Mara Hvistendahl
For The Phoenix

After a summer of slumber (arguably, longer than that), the Swarthmore
musical scene will be revived this Saturday when indie groups Joan of Arc,
Euphone, Franklin, and Atom and His
Package will be on campus to impart
their musical wisdom and make us all
feel good.
The SAC-funded concert, which will
mark the start of the Olde Club season, includes a barbecue as well as
music beginning at 2 p.m. on the lawn
outside of Olde Club.
"The idea behind this big outdoor
show," said Andy Smith, this year's
Olde Club director, "is to introduce
people to the new Olde Club."
A cleaner, renovated interior is not
the only change that Swatties can expect in the concert space, said Smith.
He has worked to book fun and entertaining bands that he hopes students
will find more accessible than what has
been offered in the past.
Playing first will be Atom and His
Package. Atom is Adam Goren and his
package is the QY 700 sequencer that
he uses to execute his playful and innovative music. Goren, who works out
of Philly, explores such probing questions in his music as that of hockey
goalies. Why, he asks, don't the teams
simply hire extra-large men to lie
down in front of the net? His latest release, "A Society of People Named
Elihu," has created quite a buzz among
indie fans.
Franklin, a Philly group with an energetic sound, will follow. Though they
play more straight rock than the other
groups, odd influences and samples
somehow creep into their sound. For
example, one of the songs on their latest release, "Tree 11," is punctuated by
electronic clapping.
Following Franklin will be Euphone,
a Chicago-based duo who have toured
with Joan of Arc. With Ryan Rapsys
on drums, sequencer, and keyboard
(apparently all at once) and Nick Macri
on bass, they play a diverse range of
instrumentalrock, hip-hop, and lounge,
all with a heavy electronic influence.
Joan of Arc, a Chicago group comprised offive guys, will be the last act.
Probably the most well-known of the
four acts, Joan of Arc was the brainchild of Tim Kinsella, the former
frontrunner for the punk group Cap'n
Jazz. This group is more laid-back than
its predecessor. On much of their latest release, "Live in Chicago, 1999",
Kinsella's relaxed vocals are juxtaposed over a livelier guitar line. Joan
of Arc gets bonus points for their artistic sense; the photos on "Live in Chicago, 1999" were "shot to look like we

Springsteen rocks Philadelphia in reunion concert
By Steve Farneth

For The Phoenix

On the heels of "Born in the USA" and
the misinterpretation it engendered,
Bruce Springsteen dismissed the E Street
Band and embarked on a solo career that
culminated in 1996 with the triumphant
but monumentally bleak "The Ghost of
Tom Joad." The solo "Tom Joad" tour was
powerful, but it pointed out precisely
what was missing without the E Street
Band.
Springsteen's catalogue explores the
highs and lows of the American experience and, beyond any other American
rock artist's, articulates a faith in the healing power of community. A solo
Springsteen is something of a contradiction and Bruce seemed to get the message
himself. The E Street Band fully atomizes his vision of the struggle and the possibility of escape.

friend for it managed to get tickets to
the opening night of Springsteen's reunion stand in Philadelphia. Although the
tour may not change the landscape of
popular music, it succeeds on nearly every level, making good on all the promises of rock and roll. Springsteen and the
E Streeters don't just save the music industry for those who still bother playing
instruments, they save it for those who
still bother listening.
We began joking months ago that the
last three years of our lives had been
building toward Monday night at the First
Union Center, and when Monday night at
the First Union Center finally came, I felt
that such anticipation was indeed merited.
The crowd had whipped itself into a
frenzy long before the band took the

stage, and when Springsteen finally
strode out arm-in-arm with saxophone
player Clarence demons, the sense of a
history and connection between an artist
and his audience put to rest any cynical
notion of this being a nostalgia tour.
Drummer Max Weinberg pounded out the
beat to "The Ties That Bind," and the band
was off. They would not stop for three
hours.
There has been a lot of commentary
about Weinberg's dazzling playing since
taking over as bandleader on "The Conan
O'Brian Show," and the adjective is certainly deserved. I'm not sure how much
this has to do with his stint on Conan. He
has always been a good drummer, though
somewhat stifled by Springsteen's aversion to drum flourishes.

Wilson to give first Collection lecture

JANE LIU

'Moral Intuitions' first of three-part Cooper Series on contemporary liberalism

By Hillary Dresser
For The Phoenix
James Q. Wilson will have traveled a long way to deliver his
lecture, "Moral Intuitions," when he comes to Swarthmore this
Friday. All the way from Southern California, to be precise.
During a telephone conversation withWilson from his hotel room

in New York, I learnedthat Wilson's political science career has
brought him an even longer way, a journey that also began in

Southern California.

Wilson was born and raised in Long Beach, Californiaand did

not intend to go to college. He recalled that few of his peers at
the local high school expected to go to college. It wasn't until

after graduation that the idea seemed plausible. Wilson spent
the following summer working on cars in his father's garage;
one afternoon his high school
English teacher paid him a
visit and told him that the University of Redlands would offer him a fellowship to start
classes in the fall.
"He told [the University of
Redlands Admissions] that I
was a debater in high school
and thatother schools were recruiting me, and they bought
it," said Wilson. Thus began
Wilson's take on the history of
his career.
A pleasant and down-toearth conversationalist, WilJames Q Wilson
son surprised me with his insistent modesty. According to Wilson, every opportunity he
has encountered has been largely accidental. He claims that
luck (never mindthe teacher whom he had obviously impressed)
brought him to college from the outset.
Around sophomore year in college, Wilson took a political scienceclass, met a professor worthy of emulation, and was hooked.
He graduated in 1952 a political science major and a Woodrow
Wilson Fellowship scholar; the Fellowship program would pay
for him to attend the graduate school of his choice.
The Korean War forcedWilson to put off his graduate school
plans for a few years. He enlisted in the Navy, which brought
him to the east coast and allowed him to visit some schools out
there.
"I had been told that if I wanted to teach in any university on
the west coast, I would have to go to school on the east coast...of
course, I found out later that this wasn't true," said Wilson.
Nonetheless, Wilson shopped around at Yale, Princeton, and
the rest of the big-name schools; he hated them all. When it
came time to submit an application, he decided on the University of Chicago because, Wilson confessed, "I knew that [the
school] had a good reputation, and it was the eastern-most school
I hadn't seen yet." The university accepted him, and Wilson remembers his experience there very fondly.
At the University of Chicago, Wilson met another important
figure in his life, his thesis supervisor, Edward Banfield. Wilson regarded Banfield as the man who "taught me everything I
know about political science." After completing his Ph.D., Wilson stayed at the University of Chicago as a teaching assistant,
while his teacher and close friend, Banfield, moved east to take
a position at Harvard. After a couple of years, Banfield called
and told Wilson that there was a lecturing position open at
Harvard. A few logistical details later, Wilson ventured back
to the dreaded east coast himself.

Wilson's verdict was that he loved Harvard University, but
that he hated Cambridge, Massachusetts. He reflected on growing up on the west coast and moving to the east coast: "It's like
growing up in Italy and visiting Iceland. They're completely
differentcultures. I never really got used to the east coast."
He found his 26 years at Harvard, however, tremendously satisfying.
"I'd stillbe there ifthey'd only move Harvard to California."
During the earliest part of his time at Harvard, Wilson wrote
a book on police behavior, which was published in 1968 and
which presented him with another opportunity. Wilson played
down this exciting detail.
"If you're teaching in an east coast university, chances are
you will be invited to be on national policy advisory boards,
given that your field is not something utterly remote." These
are words to keep in mind.
Indeed, Wilson was invited to be on a sub-committee ofPresident Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. Subsequent to his work on that committee, he was asked to chair a task force which would narrow
down the core of the previous commission to a selection of
policy recommendations. And then, Wilson supposed, "one
commission kind of leads to another." He served on commissions through the rest of Johnson's administration, and again
during Nixon's and Reagan's administrations.
For his participation on these kinds of commissions in the
White House, among other accomplishments, a number of
Swarthmore Political Science professors have Wilson pegged
as one of the most influential political scientists in the field.
Wilson was more skeptical about the influence of his work in
Washington.
"Public policy is made as a result of a great combination of
forces...lf you're not in the room with the president, chances
are reduced that you will have any influence [on policy], and I
was never in the room with him."
So Wilson was only an advisor to the presidents' advisors,
but he does not deny that serving on the commissions was a
great opportunity.
"You're lucky if you get to play a part in any of these forces."
With regard to his resume of well over a dozen published
books, Wilson matter-of-factly stated, "Any professor at a university has to write books if he wants a promotion." His opinion of this practice, however, was clear: "One could even regard the university tenure system as a system of hiring neurotics who will write whether they want to or not."
Of his own books, Wilson insisted that they were labors of
love. "I wasn't writing them to increase my pay; I was writing
them because I was interested in

Keeping eBay at bay: auctions out of control
By Kasey Kerber
Daily Nebraskan (U. Nebraska)
(U-WIRE)
From Pez dispensers to
human kidneys to, we11... humans, things
certainly have changed a lot on the eßay
auction site.
Four years ago, it was a dream of increasing one woman's Pez dispenser collection. Good ol' Pierre Omidyar never
expected his creation to one day feature
2.6 millionitems daily. He never dreamed
that eßay would have more than 1,500
non-Pez categories.
And Pierre never thought there would
be listings for human kidneys and unborn
babies floating in cyberspace along with
listings for used jockstraps. Not that it
matters really Pierre is now a billionaire. He probably hired people whose job
at eßay is to do nothing but worry about
human kidneys and unborn baby listings
popping up.
Well, if he hired such employees, they
sure have their hands full right now. Ever
since a listing for a human kidney fetched
a bid of $5.7 million last week, a string of
copy-cat kidney listings have found their
way onto the auction site. And the ante
was raised a little higher when an unborn
baby was put on the market, a child to be
born "late in the month," whose University of Chicago law school parents' "intelligence scores" could be obtained for
the bidder "upon request." The going
-

price (before eßay shut the auction
down)? $109,100.
Yep folks, it's a

sad, sick, scary world.
I felt a particular interest when the
eßay story broke last week, because I've
been a registered seller on eßay since
January. I've sold probably 200 or so
items obtained from garage sales, thrift
shops or my own attic. It's easy really: You
throw an item description and picture on
eßay, wait a week for bids, wait a few
more days for a check to arrive and then
mail off the merchandise.
What bewilders me entirely about the
sellers of human kidneys and unborn babies is their complete disregard for postage difficulties. I mean, mailing off a 10year-old Alf doll is one thing, but how do
you pack up a human kidney? Extra plastic wrap? In a Tupperware container plastered with duct tape? Awfully messy, if
you ask me.
For $5.7 million, I damn well want to
be sure my kidney is not damaged because some moron tried to mail it in an
envelope at "book rate." And an unborn
baby? Geez, this one is a packer's nightmare. Throw the mom in a crate with
some Saltine crackers?
But let's talk about the intelligence of
the buyers and sellers of these auctions
for a minute.
It's obvious the sellers of kidneys and
babies are counting on people's frail sense
of hope. Whether their offers are serious

is questionable (eßay believes all the ads
to be hoaxes).
It's also obvious the sellers have the
intelligence ofFun Dip. Not only will they
have wasted 25 cents on a listing fee, but
after eßay sorts through its membership
information, FBI agents will soon be
staining these comic geniuses' fingers
with black ink for trafficking human organs punishable by a minimum of five
years in prison and fines ofup to $250,000.
Now, a word about the buyers. Hope,
as I said earlier, is a frail thing. When hope
is shattered, people don't hesitate to latch
onto whatever might give them hope
again. Therefore, I don't blame people
who made bids on kidneys or children out
of desperation for a happy, normal life.
I also don't condone their actions as
reasonable. It doesn't take a Nobel prize
winner to realize that little hope can come
out of an auction site that has Beanie Babies as one of its biggest categories. I do
hope false auctions such as these have
opened buyers' eyes to the truth: that
hope has to be found in other (legal) ways.
So what about eßay, the medium
through which all this madness has transpired? Well, some say this is just icing
on the cake of eßay's recent troubles: a
plummeting stock price and a multipleday outage earlier this summer boosted
the popularity of rival auction sites.

Jedis, corsetted

women descend
on San Diego for

comic convention
Five weeks ago, San Diego was invaded.
This is actually an annual event, centered
around the convention center, which
basks in the sun, overlooking a crystalline bay. Let me tell you, though, none of
the invaders were there to catch some
rays.
From August 12-15, San Diego held its
30th annual Comic-Con International.The
Con, as it is affectionatelyknown, is a potpourri of all things related to the world
of comic books. It is the largest convention of its kind in the world, and if you've
never been to the Con, the whole thing
couldappear surreal. Over 22,000 people,
ranging from five to eighty-five, cram
through aisle after aisle on "The Floor,"
shouting requests to dealers:
"How much for that?"
"What will you give me for this?"
"Do you have Pokemon cards?"
And once in a while, if you stand still
for a minute in this sea of consumerism,
a Klingon will cross your path, as will the
Joker, a few Jedi Knights, and some wellproportioned women in leather corsets
wielding whips (it's better not to question).

The exhibition floor is split into three

sections, with the dealer portion taking

up one-third of the floor. In the center, all
the publishers, big (Marvel, DC) and not
so big (Cartoon Books, Abstract Comics),
advertise their products. This is also
where fans wait for the chance to shake
hands with and get a signature ora sketch
from their favorite artists and writers.
The last third of the floor is called "Artists' Alley," where both unknown and
well-establishedartists park themselves,
just waiting to show someone their work.
Upstairs, though, is where the really
good stuff happens. Artists and writers
from the top of the industry gather in
panels to receive applause and attacks;
panelists also take the chance to sound
off. Aside from the general lamenting on
the declining state of the industry, one
trend I observed was the addressing of
what audience comic books should be
written for. There was one mother who
thanked Marvel for writing books that
were appropriate for her eight-year-old
son. Then there was the middle-aged man
who argued that, even though he's been
reading Superman since he was ten, he
didn't want his comics to be directed towards ten-year-olds anymore. Mark Waid
(Superman) responded that while he
doesn't write down to children, his books
are for children.Kurt Busiek (Astro City,
Avengers) added that, generally, one
doesn't hear requests for "smarter, more
intelligent, deeper Scooby-doo."
Waid and Busiek are two of the best
writers currently working on comics
and their books are great —but what they
were saying is true. While they both write
superhero books because they feel kids
need superheroes, they also know that we
don't want deeper Scooby-doo, because
we move on. A common misconception,
however, is that there isn't anything beyond Superman and other spandex-clad
superheroes. This false notion needs to
be wiped out. Will Eisner (Spirit, A Contract with God), a god in an industry that
profits by marketing gods, once wrote
that the "reputation of comic books has
been associated with people of low literacy and limited intellectualaccomplishment." Eisner has spent his career fighting this very attitude, and thankfully,
many have joined his efforts. There are
books out there without a trace of

'Chill Factor' a few degrees short of zero
By Morghan Holt
For The Phoenix
As a native Montanan, I was intrigued by writers Drew Gitlin and
Mike Cheda's decision to place "Chill
Factor" in the Big Sky State. On viewing the movie, however, I was disappointed by the stereotypical characters (think redneck officers in cowboy
hats and boots), and by the fact that
"Chill Factor" was actually filmed
somewhere in Utah.
Remaining optimistic, I figured that
my initial disappointments were
trivial. After all, who doesn't correlate
cowboy hats and boots with Montana?
And, it's not as though the states are
two different topographical regions;
it's the same idea. Unfortunately, these
annoyances were only the beginning
of a 100-minute barrage of disappointment.

From the outset, "Chill Factor" is
bland. The dialogue lags and the plot
staggers. The introduction is saved
only by the special effects of a chemical weapon that causes the gory deaths
of 18 servicemen. As the story unfolds,
and the overplayed characters
emerge, it increasingly numbs the
mind and suspends too much belief.
Starring Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet
Ulrich and David Paymer, "Chill Factor" proves that a bad film can't be revived by big names and handsome
faces. Paymer's contrived eccentric
government scientist constructs a
chemical weapon, named "Elvis" for
no apparent reason other than to spur
bad jokes about its leaving the building, with the potential to decimate
mankind.
Stationed on Horn Island, Dr. Richard Long (Paymer) decides to discount
the orders of commanding officer An-

p

marple

drew Brynner (Peter Firth) and continue his experiment. As a result, all
of the men, except the now pissed-off
major and flabbergasted chemist, rapidly disintegrate. Because the army
values the scientist and Brynner can
easily be replaced, the blame falls unfairly on his shoulders. Locked in
Leavenworth, the officer sits for ten
years, fuming over the injustice and
plotting his revenge.
When released, Brynner emerges an
exaggerated psychopath determined
to wreak havoc on the nation that
wronged him. Somehow, Brynner
stumbles across a clan of Stone Cold
Steve Austin look-alikes dressed in
black and toting an impressive arsenal. Just to include one significant female character, Brynner's right-hand
man is a woman, played by leatherclad, obnoxious Hudson Leick.
Brynner and companythen proceed to
kill off Fort Magruder and Dr. Long.
Dying, Long manages to stumble
into his favorite diner. Carrying
"Elvis," which is apparently what the
ten-men-and-a-woman in black want,
he pins the responsibility on Tim Mason, the night-shifter (played, again
poorly, by Skeet Ulrich).
Rehashing the "bomb-on-the-bus"
suspense of"Speed," Mason must keep
"Elvis" below 50 degrees to avoid detonation. After recruiting the help of icecream deliveryman, played, in his
worst role yet, by Cuba Gooding Jr.,
the two set off on a high-speed chase
through the rocky Montana (err...
Utah) overpasses.
After a series of action-packed
scenes, unbelievable events, and
Gooding's stale remarks, the pair
comes face-to-face with Brynner. A
few expedient moves on Mason's behalf, and the duo escapes, conse-

quently saving the world.
Average guys without training, experience, or super-hero powers preserved the welfare of the nation. Never
mind that, while on the island, the doctor told Brynner that "Elvis" would
affect a five mile radius, which, when
I last checked, was substantially
smaller than the United States.
I was on the edge of my seat during
this movie, not with suspense (the
movie was ineffably predictable), but
awaiting the writers' self-redemption.
The house lights went up, the credits
rolled, and still I waited. The movie
didn't improve. It followed a tedious,
skeletal story line, contradicted itself
(why couldn't the actors decide
whether Brynner was a major or a
colonel?), and left the audience starved
for entertainment.

R. 102 minutes.
Starring Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne.

Graham.

8:10, 10:30

Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy play director and actor in a farce about Hollywood

Starring Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, and Dave
Chappelle.

7:50,

10:15

Omar Epps plays a young undercover cop whose emotions test his ability to fight the

marriage. Expect to deal with sniffling viewers and powerfully heart-wrenching scenes and
to leave intoxicated by that wonderful warm, fuzzy feeling.

"The Thirteenth Warrior"

StarringAntonio Banderas, Diane Venora, and Omar
Sharif.

7:40

The scientific mind of Michael Crichton strikes again. Based on his new bestseller, "The

the most macho viewers with stomachs of steel.

"Outside Providence"

8:05, 10:30

As a bum teenager shipped off to prep school in the post-Watergate years.Timothy Dunphy
(Shawn Hatosy), discovers just how narrow his world is. For a film advertised as being "from
the people who brought you 'Dumb and Dumber' and There's Something About Mary',"
"Outside Providence" goes soft on the plot but still makes you laugh your ass off.

"Runaway Bride"
PG. 111 minutes.
Starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.

7:10,9:50

In this "Pretty Woman" reunion, Richard Gere is a USA Today columnist covering Julia
Roberts's nasty habit of abandoning grooms at the altar.The movie is nothing like its

and rhythmic complexities. However, prioritizing the
lyrics has sometimes led to strange and annoying
album arrangements where the band seemed to be
playing a completely different song than the one
Springsteen was singing. The revelation of seeing
Springsteen and the E Street Band live is that these
songs, which always seemed like throwaways, are
actually great songs. The band was given room to
move and they offered up "The Ties That Bind,"
"Prove It All Night" (perhaps the highlight of the
show), "Darlington County" and "Out in the Street"
in versions far superior to the album versions.
Springsteen slowed things down twice, the first
time for a full band version of "Mansion on the Hill,"
followed by a long harmonica/saxophone solo which
led into "The River," one of Springsteen's most towering songwriting achievements.
The centerpiece of the show, however, was the ferocious twenty minutes that included"Youngstown,"
"Murder Incorporated" and "Badlands." "Youngstown," an acoustic haunter on "The Ghost of Tom
Joad' and my favorite Springsteen song,received a
blistering full band arrangement powered by a long
Nils Lofgren guitar solo. "Murder Incorporated" is
all vocal fury and Clarence Clemons insouciance, and
"Badlands" offers up perhaps the central verse of
the Springsteen catalogue: "For the ones who had a
notion/ a notion deep inside/ that it ain't no sin to be
glad you're alive/1 wanna find one face that ain't
looking through me." I can't imagine a better stretch
of music. It will satisfy those who like their guitar
work jammed-out and loud as well as those who like
their lyrics biting and insightful.
The first true epic of the night was "Racing in the
Street," driven by the slowly cascading waves of Roy
Bittan's piano. The long instrumental coda to the song

I'm not so sure. eßay is about as big
and successful as all other auction sites
combined. No one has more sellers and
buyers and despite other auction sites'
gains, I don't see any other site catching
up. But eßay better bet its buttered
brown brownies that things like these
need to be avoided in the future to entail
success.
Right now, eßay relies on observant
buyers to report unlawful items for sale.
With 2.6 million items for sale, this is a
pretty unrealistic approach. It wouldn't
be too conceivable for someone to bury a
kidney listing in a category no one would
think to work (like in antique fishing
tackle). Sure, you'd get less looks at your
illegal auction, but you'd also get less attention and less time in jail.
EBay probably needs to hire employees* to screen ads. It would take a
heapload of money and time on its part,
but heck, Pierre has plenty to spare. If
things get really tight, he can always sell
his wife's Pez dispenser collection. In the
meantime, more things like kidneys and
unborn babies are going to go "on sale"
on eßay.
More fragile hope is going to be
screwed with.
More morons are going to go to jail.
And more stories are going to be written about the influence of an auction Web
site on people's lives and on the lives of
people who just want to live a normal life
no matter what the auction price of it
might be up to.

is sublime and hopeful, and the crowd roared its
approval for several .minutes before Springsteen
launched into full preacher mode on the final number of the set, "Light of Day," breathlessly intoning
the "magic and the ministry ofrock 'n roll." He closed
the set by saying, "This is about the rebirth of our
band and of our dedication to you. Thank you."
The six-song encore inevitably included "Born to
Run," which has never been a favorite song ofmine.
Live, however, "Born to Run" is something to experience. The crowd at a Springsteen concert knows
every wordof every song,but on "Born to Run," they
nearly carry the band, hooting every ad-libbed "Oh"
with fists raised joyously.
The encore also included anthems "Backstreets,"
"Thunder Road" and the most beautiful moment of
the night, "If I Should Fall Behind," where each
member of the band sang a verse back to the other
members of the band. Each of them proved to be
powerful singers, probably capable of acclaimed solo
workbut unitedby Springsteen's potent imagery and
insight.
I wonder why Springsteen is not quite the mythic
figure that Bob Dylan is, particularly here at
Swarthmore, where Springsteen's liberal generosity and concern for the way we construct our own
piece of the puzzle would seem to mesh better than
Dylan's air of detached cynicism. There are certain
artists and works of art that each of us takes very
personally, and Bruce Springsteen is one of mine.
The Reunion Tour is certainly the most exciting
concert that will come through Philadelphia this year,
and so of course I feel that the 16-24 crowd is missing out on something deeply moving and important.
Springsteen will be in Philadelphia until the end of
September, and as he said on-stage, "We're gonna
bring it to ya." The man speaks the truth.

Swatties concerned about other schools' high grades
By David Ellis
For The Phoenix
The t-shirts say it all: "Anywhere else it would have been
an A." Such is the unofficial
motto of Swarthmore College,
where popular myth has it
that professors maintain a
grade point average of about
a B, shirking the trend of
grade inflation prevalent at
colleges around the nation.
Does grade inflation exist at
Swarthmore, and if so, is this
beneficial or harmful to students and the college as a
whole?
"Swarthmore College has no
official policy of maintaining
low grades," said Maurice
Eldridge, Vice President and
Executive Assistant to the
President. "It was an unofficial approach that has come to
be a tradition over the years."
While Swarthmore does not
have official standards for
grades, statistics indicate that
across the board, professors
give grades centered roughly
on a B to B+ average. In a recent study of Swarthmore
GPAs conducted by the
Registrar's Office, the grade
point average was adjusted to
fit in ungraded Honors

courses. Swarthmore's average GPA rose from a 3.08 in
1982 to a 3.24 in 1994, where
it has since leveled off.
Such numbers are considerably below most of the nation's
undergraduates. The University of California at Berkeley
Law School used to use a quantitative GPA analysis chart
before this official method of
analysis was outlawed earlier
this decade. In Berkeley's

chart, Swarthmore students
had the lowest GPAs of any
school in the country, with
only Colgate, Duke, Johns
Hopkins, and Williams coming

relatively close.
There are numerous benefits to having proportionally
lower grades than the rest of
the nation. With a lower scale,
students' performance in
classes are delineated far better than in a grade inflation
environment.
would hope
that
"I
Swarthmore students take
pride in the fact that when
they get an A, they really deserve an A," said Tom
Krattenmaker, Director of
News and Information.
This is in stark contrast to
the environment at many
schools, where extreme grade
inflation has affected how
hard students work. A former
Swarthmore student, who
wishes to remain anonymous,
transferred to another school
and has been unhappy with
how grade inflation has affected a lax work environment.

Additionally, the fact that
Swarthmore has such proportionally low grades has given
it a great deal of positive publicity. In U.S. News and World
Report's issue a year ago on
colleges, Swarthmore was the
feature of a four page article

on grade inflation. The article

closed with the line, "As for

student boasting about lofty
GPAs from schools where
grades below B are exotic,
they will have to stand out in
other ways."
Not everyone agrees with
U.S. News writer Avery
Comarow's rosy assessment
of Swarthmore graduates'
chances. While it seems that
most graduate schools have
heard of Swarthmore's grade
scale, it is uncertain how
aware of it the corporate
world is. While medical school
advisors Gigi Simeone and
Barbara Hirchfield make an
intense effort to make sure
that medical schools are
aware of Swarthmore grade
point averages, it is much
more difficult for Career
Planning and Placement Director Thomas Francis to do
the same for the thousands of
companies that students look
at.

"If we took out an ad in The
New York Times proclaiming
Swarthmore's low grades, I do
not think that would be all that
effective," said Francis.
"Since companies may not
know of Swarthmore's grade
policy, it is essential that students talk about the caliber of
their education to whoever is
interviewing them, and I feel
that most students do this effectively."
While Francis does talk
about it with representatives
of companies that come to
campus, he maintains that,
given the sheer number of
companies out there, it would
be impossible to do this on a
national scale. Because of this
fact, students looking for jobs
outside of the academic world
are ostensibly hurt by their
low grade point averages.

"Those hurt the most are
'accepted scholars' to the federal government," said
Francis. "When a department
is hiring, they do not do a full
blown search if they do not
have a 3.5 [G.P.A.] or better.
"The bottom line is, those
with high grade point averages are not rewarded as
much as those from other
schools, and those with low
G.P.As are hurt more."
However, Francis maintains
that companies are aware of
grades' essential nature.
"Grades reflect how well a
student will do in an academic,
scholarly environment," he
said. "This does not translate
into most jobs, such as being
an effective salesperson."
The data, which shows that
Swarthmore students are not
being affected by lower grade
point averages, is somewhat
suspect. For example, the fact
that Swarthmore has an extremely high acceptance rate
to medical schools can be explained by Swarthmore's effective limitations of applicants to medical school, because medical advisor recommendations are not given to
students with lower GPAs.
Additionally, the University
of California's Law School
data on grade point averages
groups quartiles of colleges
based on grade point average.
In essence, this means that
Swarthmore students' proportionally lower GPAs are still
adjusted exactly the same
way as the GPAs from colleges like Bates, Carleton,

Harvard, Pomona, Princeton,
and Vanderbilt.
Additionally, critics maintain that it is inherently unfair
to force Swarthmore students
to come into a job interview
with a huge disadvantage

compared to students from
other schools.
"Swarthmore's practice of
grade control is fine in theory,
except no one knows we practice it," said Dave Thomas 'O2,
"It makes us look bad in interviews because no one knows
we do it. If we were Harvard,
we could have low grades, and
people would know about it,
For God's sakes, we're
Swarthmore; let's be serious."
Institutions around the nation with proportionally low
grade point averages have
taken different steps to address students' complaints
that the policy hurts them in
the workplace. Reed College
recently attached a sheet to
transcripts explaining the
college's academic philosophy
and mean GPA of 2.9.
On the other hand, three
years ago, the University of
Virginia Law School re-centered the mean grade from a
3.0 to a 3.3.
"The idea behind the change
was to make sure our students
aren't disadvantaged," said
Steve Hopson, University of
Virginia Law Recruiting
Dean.
This past year was the first
year that the effects of higher
grades couldbe measured, because it was the first graduating class affected by the recentered grades for all three
years.
"This year is one of the best
years we have ever had [in law
students getting good jobs],"
siad Hopson. "Intuitively, our
sense is that this is directly
attributable to the higher
grades."
Currently, Swarthmore College has no plans to shift
grade policies, but questions
still remain on whether this
hurts or helps students.

Men's soccer knocks off previously undefeated Albright 1-0
Garnet rebounds after two consecutive losses, wins hard-fought game on lone goal by Perez
By Aurelio Perez
For The Phoenix

On Wednesday, the rain could not stop the the
Swarthmore men's soccer team when they hosted
then-undefeated Albright College, which had won
five straight. Victory for the Garnet came after
the team had dropped to Rowan 6-1 and Moravian
2-0 at the Haverford Tournament.
Mud and all, the Garnet managed to score once
and it proved to be the difference in the non-conference match. The sole goal, a 23-yard left footed
chip that hit the upper side netting of the goal,
came off forward Aurelio Perez 'O2 in the game's
twenty-fifth minute. Senior Dan Lieberman scored
the assist on the goal.
With more than a dozen freshmen, the game offered many chances for the Garnet rookies to
shine, and many members of the team rose to the
occasion. Alex Shaw 'O3 and Cam MacDearmid 'O3
anchored a strong defense, which was led by
keeper Chris Milla 'O3, who had 17 saves and is
currently second in the league in saves per game.
The midfield worked like a well-oiled twelvepiston engine. The players distributed balls,
blocked shots, and fired some rockets agaist
Albright's goal. Midfielder Francisco Sersale 'O2
hit the crossbar, and had the ball slammed into the
back of the net by Marcus Shin 'OO. Unfortunately,
the goal was disallowed, as was a third goal scored
late in the game by Frank Yeo 'Ol.
As the hard-fought game got into the later minutes, the team was revitalized by many substitutes.
Carey Kopeikin 'O3 and Tom Lee 'Ol both worked
hard to seal the victory, as did GorleighWillis 'O3.
With this win, the Garnets improve their record
to 2-5. The team's next home game is this Saturday against Centennial Conference leader John's
Hopkins, currently ranked #4 in the nation.

on an excellent penalty stroke
less than a minute later, and
Gaffney finished off the scoring, with an assist from Ingrid
Kaszas 'O3, with fifty seconds
left in the game. Swarthmore
outshot the diplomats 19 to 9
and also led in penalty corners, 9 to 7. Kendall posted 5
saves in the shutout. Though
they had a solid win, many
Garnet team members see
room for improvement.
"I think the connection between the midfielders and offense improved this game,
and defense did a great job of
getting the ball out of the
circle," said Finnegan. "While
I think we've improved on offense, we still need to be more
efficient with the ball. With
the amount of time we had the
ball in our circle, it could have
easily been a 6 goal game."
The team will travel to
Vassar College this weekend
for the Seven Sisters tournament. They will open the tournament with a game against
Randolph Macon Women's
College.

After an impressive 4-0
opener against Widener on
Saturday the fourth, field
hockey had a tough 4-1 loss to
Centennial Conference rival
Gettysburg., but followed it
quickly with a decisive win
over Franklin and Marshall.
The Garnet tide traveled to
Gettysburg this past Saturday
to battle the Bullets. Unlike
Swarthmore's thick grass
field, Gettysburg's field was
sparse and very fast.
"Gettysburg was a skilled
team who knew how to play on
their fast field," commented
Julie Finnegan 'OO.
"After the first half we did
a good job of adjusting our
skills to match the speed of the
field and Gettysburg's style of
play," added Becca Stites 'OO.
Gettysburg led 1-0 entering
halftime, but Kristen English
'Ol scored off an assist from
Finnegan about ten minutes
into the second half to even the
score. Gettysburg turned the
tables the other way one

minute later and gained a 2-1
lead over Swarthmore.
To make things worse,
Gettysburg put in two more
goals in the next 14 minutes.
They also outshot Swarthmore
14 to 3 and led in penalty corners 12 to 5. Keeper Jane
Kendall 'OO had six saves and
Katie Tarr 'O2 had a defensive
save.
"I don't think the score reflects well how we played. We
had a good game, adjusting our
style, picking up the speed and
playing hard for the entire 70
minutes," commented Erika
Williams 'Ol.
The team was able to turn the fl
tables against Franklin and
Marshall on Tuesday afternoon.
They registered a 3-0 win over
the visiting Diplomats.
"It was a little difficult to adjust back to our field after only
between
practice
one
Gettysburg and F&M," said
Krista Hollis 'Ol.
Allison Gaffney 'O2 scored the
first goal with five minutes remaining in the first half off an
assist from Kim Cariello 'O2.

Women's rugby opens season
with overwhelming victory
A-team wins 31-0, B-team takes 0-0 draw
By Alexa Miller and Rhiana Swartz
For The Phoenix

|

Traveling with over 30 players (compared to under twenty last spring), the women's
rugby team started their season off with a big win against Salisbury State University
in Maryland. In the A-side game, played by veterans, Swarthmore won by the lopsided score of 31-0. The B-side, mostly rookies, battled to a 0-0 draw.
The A-side game was dominated by Swat. With the experience of the squad, the
ball rarely left the Garnet's offensive end. In short, Swat played like a well-oiled
machine, taking advantage of Salisbury's weaknesses.
The scoring rampage started when co-captain Rhiana Swartz 'OO ripped the ball
out of the hands of Alexa Miller 'OO, who was tied up in a maul by the try line. Swartz
slammed the ball down into the zone, marking the first points of the season. Nancy
Craig 'Ol capped the play by nailing a beautiful conversion. Miller then increased
Salisbury's deficit by touching the ball down into the try zone as she was being tackled. Minutes later, Swarthmore scored again, capitalizing on a perfect lineout in which
Craig and Swartz neatly broke through the Salisbury line, permitting Swartz to plant
the ball in the zone.
The backs played exceptionally well, running lines cleanly off the smart calls of
flyhalf Cathy Vaughan 'Ol. Lisa Jenkins 'O2, playing outside center, and Abigail
Stewart-Teitelbaum 'Ol, who played at wing with such skill that one would never
know it was her first time in the position, saw considerable action. Scrumhalf Meghan
Brennan 'OO steered the activity on the field, sealing the firm connection between the
forwards and the backs. Co-captain Noelle Goodin 'OO took advantage of one such
connection as she broke through Salisbury's last line of defense, chalking up one
more try for Swarthmore. Goodin placed the ball tactfully in the center of the goal
posts, setting up Swartz to complete an exquisite conversion. Swartz then stole one
more try, achieving a hat trick. Craig crowned the occasion with a strong conversion,
the finishing blow against Salisbury.
With 14 players on the field who had less than a week of rugby experience, the Bside team was prepared for the worst. Instead, nearly every rookie made a play that
had the fans on theirfeet. The tackling was especially notable. Fullback Katie Harper
'O2 and future scrumhalf
pro Rabi Whitaker 'O3
saved the day more than
once. Among the forwards,
Laurie Smith 'Ol and
Siobhan Carty 'Ol both
played aggressively, putting endless pressure on
their opponents.
Coach Alan Matas was
especially happy with the
rookies' performance, not
to mention their numbers.
"This crew is a very promJUSTIN KANE | Phoenix Staff

Overall, it was a great first
