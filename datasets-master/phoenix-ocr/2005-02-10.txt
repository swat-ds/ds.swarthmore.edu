Sudan group gains momentum in D.C.
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW

bbradlol@swarthmore.edu

Members of Swarthmore Sudan attended a conference hosted by the National
Holocaust Museum and the Georgetown
University student group Students Taking

Action Now Darfur in Washington, D.C,
last weekend about the ongoing violence
in the Darfur region of Sudan. The group
led workshops about its Genocide
Intervention Fund and a new campaign
called "100 Days of Action," according to
Cara Angelotta 'O5, the group's director of
communications.
Speakers at the conference included
key
endorsers of the
Genocide
Intervention Fund, which aims to raise
money for African Union peacekeeping
troops to supplement what many see as a
severe lack of funding for the mission.
Gayle Smith, a fellow from the Center
for American Progress, which has provided logistical support for Swarthmore
Sudan including giving the group financial cover as a non-profit organization
while the group looks to establish itself
independently, was a featured panel
speaker at the conference as was John

Security Council under former President
Clinton. Both have publicly endorsed the
GIF. Smith had recently returned from
negotiating with AU negotiators about
how money raised for the GIF would be
transferred to the AU peacekeeping
troops in Darfur.
The group had a meeting to talk about
the GIF with one of the main speakers,

White said that other student groups
appeared to be facing fatigue in the face of
waning public interest in the conflict in
Darfur. "Other groups seemedkind of disillusioned," she said. "We're kind of leading the effort... It's the start of something

for 100 days. "The idea of the campaign is
to return the focus to civilian protection,"
Angelotta said.
The campaign's goal is to send 100,000
letters to government officials urging
them to take action against the Sudanese
government and to raise $lOO,OOO for the
GIF, according to Angelotta.

force commander of the U.N. Assistance
Mission to Rwanda Romeo Dallaire.
"The speakers were just incredible and

inspiring," Swarthmore Sudan member
Lissie Jacquette 'O7 said, who pointed to
Dallaire's speech as a highlight.
About 400 students from 90 different

schools attended the conference, accord-

ing to Angelotta.

The Swarthmore Sudan-led workshop
on the GIF was meant to show other attendees that "humanitarian aid is a BandAid solution," Angelotta said. The group
sees the GIF as directed toward a much
more effective type of solution, where the
conflict is stopped from causing further
humanitarian damage. "People were very
supportive of what we are doing," group

One event has already been planned as
a result of the networking that went on at
the conference. Swarthmore Sudan is coordinating with Haverford, Bryn Mawr
and University of Pennsylvania to hold a

dance marathon at Penn's campus to raise
money for the GIF.
Both White and Angelotta pointed to
the networking opportunities that the
conference presented the group. "Tons of
colleges signed up to join the Genocide

Intervention Fund," Angelotta said. "We
plan on having a college launch for the
Genocide Intervention Fund in March."
Along with the expansion of the GIF,
the group is also planning a more general
campaign to be called "100 Days of
Action," which will begin April 6 to commemorate the day that the Rwandan genocide said to have begun.

Sudan and
Swarthmore Sudan's efforts to stop it.
However, the resolution does not express
specific support for the GIF. According to
Council co-president Tom Evnen 'O7, the
council took a section about the GIF out of
the resolution because of perceived controversy surrounding the issue. "We took
it out because we were made aware that a
number of people who are in the know
aren't sure it's the best policy idea," he
said. "This is not meant to indicate that
we don't support that fund."

Search for new housing director nears completion
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

The college's selection process
to fill Associate Dean for Student
Life Myrt Westphal's former posi-

tion as assistant dean and director of residential life will soon
come to an end. The search yielded a pool of over 100 applicants
that has been narrowed down to a
handful of finalists, according to

Westphal.

It was conducted by a committee chaired by Westphal and consisting of faculty members and

four students.
The position was vacated in
August when Westphal was promoted to the associate dean position that was previously held by
Tedd Goundie, now the Dean of
Students at Bates College.
Since then, Westphal has been
juggling the roles ofher new position with her previous responsibilities as director of residential
life, including running the housing lottery.

The search committee is currently

conducting

on-campus

interviews with the four finalists.
"We narrowed the pool of more
than 100 applicants first with a
paper screening, and then interviewed the remaining 40 on the
phone," Westphal said. "We're
moving quickly, but we're moving
carefully."
According to residential assistant and search committee member Sarah Goldberg 'O5, students
on the committee returned to
campus early after winter break
to begin reading applications for
the new position. "The process
has gone much faster than these
processes tend to go," Goldberg
said. "We could have a finalist in

THE PHOENIX

a couple weeks."
The four students on the
search committee, all of whom
are RAs, make up half the committee and have been present at
all on-campus interviews. "We've
had a lot of say in evaluating the
applicants," Goldberg said.

According to Westphal,

the

finalists, who are all near the

of their careers, come
from various places, including
the Philadelphia area, and are
from a variety of positions and
beginning

institutions. "The pool has been
very strong," she said. Some candidates are Swarthmore alumni,

while others are not connected to
to
college,
according
the
Goldberg.

For the next step in the selection process, the group offinalists
will be narrowed to two or three,
who will be brought to campus for
a full-day interaction with the
search committee, the housing
committee and the deans.

Although Westphal expects an
offer to be made for the position
in the next few weeks, the new
assistant dean will likely not
until
begin
the
summer.
"Initially, I'd thought that the fall
housing lottery would be my last,
but it looks like I'll be doing the
April lottery too," she said. "The
new assistant dean might not
start until June, in which case
his or her first tasks would be the
matching of freshmen roommates and dealing with the wait-

list."

She looks forward to the end of
her current juggling act between
positions and immersing herself
in her new responsibilities. "It's
been hard working two jobs
because they're very different,"
Westphal said. "Housing is very

immediate
and by now it's a
well-oiled machine whereas my
new job is more conceptual." In
her new position, Westphal is
happy to be working more closely
with students than before, serving as the director of RA selection
and the head of the judicial committee.
Westphal nonetheless looks
back fondly on her days as director of residential life. "I've been a
about
little nostalgic about it
my regime. I'll especially miss the
rave reviews I get from people
who really got along with their
freshman roommates," she said.
"But my new job will overlap
with my old one; I'll still be working closely with RAs and with students with disabilities."
Westphal has been working in
the student life section of the
dean's office, which advises students, organizes housing and
freshman orientation, holds disciplinary hearings and deals with
other non-academic student concerns for 15 years.
She served in her previous
role as director of residential life
and coordinator for disability
services since 1993.
Two-time RA and Housing
Committee member for the past
two years Val Marone 'O5 is also

nostalgic. "Myrt's phenomenal
and we'll never be able to replace

her," she said. "Next year will be
a transition period."
RA and search committee
member John Egan 'O6 agreed.
"I've come to learn that we students really don't value Myrt as
much as we ought to and as much
as she deserves," he said in an email. "It's true that You don't
know what you've got 'til it's
gone'; luckily, Myrt is moving up

and not out."

Marone, too, thinks the college
has and will continue to benefit
from Westphal's
promotion.
"She's able to interact more with
students this way, and that's what
she loves," she said.
Next year she will also serve
as a mentor to the new assistant

dean and will work

closely

with

him or her. "I look forward to the
new ideas and energy he or she
might bring," Westphal said. "It'll
be nice to have a new person on
the team."
"Certainly [the new assistant
dean] will bring new ideas and
youthful vigor," Egan said. "But
task number one will be learning
how to be The New Myrt."

La Porte was talking about his

an on-line journal
which has a link on the

Swarthmore Admissions Web site
to showcase the first-year student
experience at the college.
The Admissions Office had
long been in search of a way to
make its Web site student-oriented and organic. La Porte's
Live Journal was the perfect solution.

Though the journal is not the
first item listed in a Google

prospective Swarthmore students

made
extraordinary by the fact that his

a glimpse of the

Tom Krattenmaker
Director of News

La Porte attended a summer

He wanted to revive that practice as a first-year student at
Swarthmore. However, he wanted
to post e-mails in a LiveJournal

the Internet.
"I started putting [e-mails] on

La Porte now posts e-mails to

Facilities Coordinator Paula
Dale has been writing a psychology paper about the transition

A friend of La Porte's uncle, she
also heard about the LiveJournal.
Soon after his post about the fire
in ML, Dale sent an e-mail informing La Porte that the troublesome
fire alarm in Mary Lyon had been
replaced. La Porte was entertained by the idea that its replacement was the result of his
LiveJournal.
"Two thousand people have
visited [the Live Journal], as a
result [of the Admissions Web site
link]," he said. "Anywhere
between 30 and 50 people a day."
One of the 2000 people was a
prospective student that La Porte
hosted. According to La Porte, the
prospective student had read the
Live Journal before his college

visit and was ecstatic that his
host was its writer.
"That was kind of cute," La

excited by that, actually."

Some visitors have e-mailed
La Porte with questions about the
admissions process, which he is
unable to answer. He directs these
visitors to the Admissions Office
in reply e-mails and has posted a
disclaimer at the top of his
Live Journal: "I have no information about the mechanics of the
admissions process, and I will
simply advise you to call or e-mail

He and Bock had been in
search of an organic way to

attract prospective

Swarthmore.

They explored the possibility
of having students and faculty

write blogs about their experi-

ences before deciding against the
idea.
"Ideally, we wanted to find
someone who was doing it
already," Krattenmaker said.
"I was delighted that his blog

This perceived quality of his

page and Admissions Web site
convey the true Swarthmore
story as opposed to the institutional propaganda story is the
model for which Krattenmaker
and Bock are striving.
What Krattenmaker and Bock

especially like about the upgraded Admissions Web site is its lack
of a narrator or omniscient voice
droning about how good
Swarthmore is
in favor of the
student voice.
This is evident in the
revamped
Swarthmore
Admissions view book and the
"Swarthmore Unscripted" DVD.
"Our front page is loaded with
substance," Bock said. "It's a subtle message that Swarthmore is a
place of substance where real
things happen."

Bock said he hopes La Porte's
LiveJoumal will attract prospective students to Swarthmore.
"I think it shows another
voice," he said. "His experience is
one of 1,400 students."
Bock also said he hopes more
students will write about their
experiences at Swarthmore in
Live Journals like La Porte's. "I
think he does a really good job,"
he said.
"He doesn't tell us when he's
going to blog or what he's going to
write about," Krattenmaker said.
"In my perfect world, he would
write every week."
"I would say every day," Bock

said.
Krattenmaker and Bock view
La Porte's Live Journal as a successful venture in Admissions
student outreach but recognize
their noncommittal relationship
with him.
"We've put no restraints on
him," Krattenmaker said. "He's
free to turn off when he wants to."
"There was very little expectation on our parts," La Porte said.
The use of a LiveJournal is
nothing new to the Swarthmore
Web site.
History professor Tim Burke's
blog had beenfeatured on the Web
site for quite some time. "He
writes about political issues and
higher education," Krattenmaker
said.
Burke's blog offered a faculty
perspective of Swarthmore, however, and La Porte's LiveJournal
directly relates to Admissions
student outreach.
Bock said looks forward to seeing La Porte's name appear in
"Why Swarthmore?" essays as
Swarthmore Unscripted and
other students' names have.
La Porte does not know what
the future holds for his
Live Journal with regards to
Admissions, but he plans to continue to post e-mails.
"Why not?" he said. "I'll probably keep doing it because there
will not stop being people wanting to hear what I'm up to."

(U-WIRE) ITHACA, NY.
A
District Court judge ruled that it
is unconstitutional for the gov-

ernment to deny federal funding
to universities that restrict oncampus military recruitment.

The decision was announced
last Monday in a lawsuit filed by
Yale Law School faculty members against the U.S. Department
of Defense.
The major point of debate was
a piece of legislation called the
Solomon Amendment, which
states that law schools that deny
full access to military recruiters
will lose all federal funding for
their parent universities.
Yale Law School faculty members argued that because the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy prohibits them from hiring
openly lesbian, gay, bisexual or

transgender (LGBT) individuals,
the military is in violation of the

law school's nondiscrimination
policy. Yale's policy requires that

all campus recruiters consider

In light of this ruling, Yale
Law School Dean Harold Hongju
Koh issued a memorandum to

of

School and member of OutLaws,
the school's LGBT student organization Janna Freed said that, as
a whole, her fellow students as
well as faculty members have
been "overwhelmingly supportive" throughout this process and
that "the atmosphere right now is
very positive and hopeful."
Several other law schools and
faculties have filed lawsuits
regarding this issue, including

one that resulted in a Circuit
Court ruling last November
which also declared the Solomon
Amendment unconstitutional.

only ones affected," he said. "I
think that's a message people
need to hear."
Daren Tedeschi 'O5, who
worked for Holt in the summer of
2002, said he appreciated that
Holt highlighted the Bush administration's use of budgetary politics and deficit spending to carry
out their ideological program
based on small government.
He did, however, express
doubts about Holt's framing of
Social Security. "Social Security
forming bonds between people
and generations? That kind of
bond doesn't have a face to it,"
Tedeschi said. "I'm not sure I
want to live in the kind of place
where bonds have to be fostered
through the state."
The lecture was organized by
the Philadelphia-area alumni
club.

New SAT to be administered in March
2010
will be the first affected
According to Dean of Admissions Jim
Bock '9O, this does not spell particularly big
changes for prospective Swarthmore students.
The new writing section is essentially
the same as the current SAT II: Writing
test, which Swarthmore requires students
to submit anyway. "The writing is just
moving," Bock said. He said the changes to
the test have a greater impact on students
applying to less competitive schools that
did not previously require a standardized
essay test.
Nonetheless, prospective students seem
to be apprehensive about the changes,
according to Jessica Zagory 'O5, who served
as an admissions fellow in the fall. "We get
lots of calls and e-mails asking about which
test they have to take," she said. "It's complicated for juniors because many of them
have already taken the old one."
Bock said the admissions department
will accept either the new version or the old
one from applicants for the class of 2010,
because the scores on the two tests are
equivalent; for example, a 730 on the new
math section is equal to a 730 on the old one.
"We prefer the new one, basically
because we don't want people to give more
money to the College Board" by paying to
take the SAT II: Writing in addition to the
SAT I, Bock said. "But we'll accept either of

Last March, three executives from The
Princeton Review, which publishes test

preparation material and guidebooks to colleges, wrote an article for The Atlantic
Monthly titled "Would Shakespeare Get

Into Swarthmore?" The article examined
passages written by such literary luminaries as Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein
and Shakespeare, and held them up against
the proposed criteria for the writing portion
of the forthcoming new version of the SAT.
According to their assessment, on the
scale of one to six used by evaluators (with
6 being the highest score), Hemingway
would have scored a three, Stein, a one,
and Shakespeare, a two. And the
Unabomber? A perfect six.

This spring, high school students can

look forward to taking that test themselves.

The new SAT has been updated to
include higher-level algebra questions,
more critical reading questions and, most
notably, the addition of a writing portion
that will consist of multiple choice questions and a 25-minute essay response,
according to petersons.com, which publishes test preparation material.
The new test will be administered for
the first time this March, meaning that

Bock said the Admissions Office will
require that only two SAT lis be submitted
with the new SAT, rather than three, since
the new test replaces the SAT II: Writing.
"Some of our peers will still require three
SAT lis, and I'm not sure why that is," he
noted.

According to a Time magazine article,
one of the College Board's main reasons for
updating the test is to encourage high
schools to prioritize writing in their curricula. Bock said it is too soon to know if
the changes will really produce the intended outcome. "Promoting writing is a good

essays?" he said. "The jury is still out for
me on whether the new test will achieve its
goal."
He noted that many questions remain
as the Atlantic Monthly article suggests
about whether the test will effectively promote writing in general, or whether it will
encourage only a formulaic style of writing
narrowly geared toward the test.
However, Bock emphasized the importance of standardized testing in general for
the admissions process.
"The reason that we require SAT scores
is that it's the one thing that every applicant does. We don't compare every student,
but we look at the scores in the context of
where students are coming from. It's one
piece of the puzzle."
Richard Futrell, a prospective student
from New Orleans, said he sees the merits
of the changes but is not looking forward to
taking a longer exam. "It makes sense, but
I'm not happy about having to take it," he
said. "It's more stressful. It would be easier
to take writing as a separate test."
Futrell also had another possible explanation of the logic behind the changes.
"I think there's been a growing industry of test preparation, and by having
writing on the new SAT they're going to
help make it more fair by making it harder to coach," he said. "The writing makes
it a bit more personal."

among many voters.
"I think this is a good way to
inform people about local issues
and what they can control, so
they can take a stand on issues
that are affecting them," former
co-chair of SVRC Ethan Ucker
'O7 said.
Strong argued that there are
a variety of local issues that
would interest students if they
were aware of them. "We want
students to know who our local
leaders are, what issues they

care about. These issues affect
students and students have a
potential to sway the vote. We

represent around 20 percent of
the borough electorate," he said
in an e-mail.
Strong noted that many of
these issues could directly affect

increases and school budgets
referenda in which students
could vote," he said.
The magazine will employ the

help of an advisory board to
direct its path and provide expert
perspective on the subject matter.
"[The] advisory board will
consist of Swarthmore professors, local community activists,
Walingford-Swarthmore
a
School District Board member,
College Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l and even a former

U.S. Congressional candidate,"
Strong said.
The magazine could potentially serve as a medium, not

only for discussion about voter's
rights, but also for activist
groups across campus to talk
about their own specific pet
issues, Ucker said.
He said that he hopes the magazine will become a "venue for
people in activist groups to educate the community," and that
"publishing something in this
magazine becomes very

valu-

able."
The process of starting the
publication initially encountered difficulties

in securing

funding. An original proposal to

secure funding from the Forum
For Free Press was unsuccessful.
"FFFP spring budgeting was
simply gone," Ucker said.
Despite this setback, Ucker
and Strong looked for other
sources of funding. According to
Strong, SVRC plans "to get at
least one if not two issues out

this semester."
To fund these issues, SVRC
appealed to the President's
Office. "Maurice Eldridge has
agreed to tide us over," Strong
said.

Eldridge echoed this, but said
that the President's Office funding was only temporary.
"It has been my experience
that when new publications are

planned for campus it takes time
to get chartered and become eligible for student funds. From
time to time the President's
Office has therefore provided
seed money for a start up," he

said in an e-mail.
"Such money is available for
a limited time and would not
sustain an effort that did not
meet FFFP standards over the
course of a semester or two,"
Eldridge added.

"We currently have at least
seven articles on seven different
issues being worked on right
now with a deadline of Feb. 25,"
Strong said.
According to Strong, many
on the staff of the pub-

positions

lication are still open.
"There are editorial, journalistic and design (including Web
site) positions available," he said.

Films look at black
history diversity

A collection of documentary films, many of them
independently-produced, will be screened Friday and
Saturday as part of the film series "The Black Reel."
The events are co-sponsored by the Swarthmore
African American Student Society, the Black Cultural
Center, the department of film and media studies, the
Office of Multicultural Affairs, COLORS and
FreeCulture Swarthmore.
"We wanted to get a mix of different directors and
concepts for movies that depict the African American
experience," said Brandy Monk-Payton 'O7, a SASS
member who helped coordinate the series.
"SASS hopes to make this an annual event," organizer Kendra McDow 'O7 said. "We want to get independent films, directed or produced by and/or about
the African-American experience."

Events marking Black History Month began this
week with a screening on Tuesday of "Eyes on the
Prize," a film about the American civil rights era, cosponsored by the Swarthmore African-American
Student Society and FreeCulture Swarthmore.
The coalition between the two normally unrelated
groups was a product of a political situation in which
the documentary is mired. When the PBS film was created in 1987, the featured newsreel footage was
licensed individually from copyright holders. The filmmakers, who were working on a limited budget, only
licensed the footage for a certain number of years,
now expired.
As a result, the film will never again be broadcast
on television and cannot be released on DVD. The
Swarthmore presentation was done from videocassette, and was part of international "protest" screenings that included veteran activists in the civil rights
movement. "Imagine that you couldn't read the
papers from 20 years ago and earlier," said
FreeCulture Swarthmore co-founder Nelson Pavlosky
'O6. "You would essentially lose that part of your history, and that's what's going on here."
Kendra McDow 'O7 said FreeCulture Swarthmore
had approached SASS to see if the group wanted to
co-sponsor the event and include it in its black film
series taking place this week (see story, below).
"Eyes on the Prize," McDow said, "showed ordinary
people, what ordinary people sacrificed, by going to
jail and even sacrificing their lives for basic rights."

The football cuts. Living wage. The Meaning of
Swarthmore. In the past 14 years, College
President Al Bloom has seen significant accomplishments
and controversy. A look at the
careful balancing act between ethical intelligence
and a well-funded college, and the principles
behind the action. By Aaron Wasserman

Dartmouth

College has a football crisis. Two months ago, The Valley
News of White River Junction, Vt,
published an article disclosing excerpts of
a controversial private letter written four
years ago by Dartmouth's Dean of
Admissions Karl Furstenberg.
"Football programs represent a sacrifice to the academic quality and diversity
of entering first-year classes," Furstenberg
wrote. "Football, and the culture that surrounds it, is antithetical to the academic
mission of colleges such as ours."
The recipient of the letter was
Swarthmore College President Al Bloom.
Furstenberg was congratulating him on his

THE PHOENIX

decision, in December 2000, to eliminate
the football program at Swarthmore.

Ethics and academia

Al Bloom's presidency is now in its 14th
academic year. That span is longer than those
of most college presidents, and appropriately,
it is stuffed with changes to Swarthmore's
academic landscape. Bloom oversaw- the
establishment of the Foreign Studies Office,
the Intercultural Center and the Lang Center
for Civic and Social Responsibility. He helped
to direct new efforts by the Admissions Office
to create a more diverse student body and
approved the creation of new interdisciplinary minors. Over the course of several capi-

tal campaigns, he was responsible for the
building of Kohlberg, the Science Center and

the New Dorm.

Nevertheless, for a sizable number of
alumni, the decision by the Board of
Managers, under Bloom's direction, to
eliminate Swarthmore's football and
wrestling programs four years ago will forever define Bloom's tenure. More recently,
activists in the Swarthmore Living Wage
and Democracy Campaign were heartened
when the board approved Bloom's proposal
to raise the minimum wage of college staff.
Yet simultaneously the administration
seemed to rule out any future raises, and
Bloom carefully stepped around the term
"living wage" in describing the action.
Bloom's presidency is defined both by
how transformative and divisive it has
been. There is a tension between his desire
to think grandly
about how an institution of higher learning serves its students
and how he can personally reshape
Swarthmore's educational mission
and
individual decisions themselves, like the
one that threatens to overshadow all the
rest. Behind this friction lies the propulsive force of Bloom's entire presidency: his
inaugural speech on May 2,1992.
"It's the key to what he likes to call a
'fine liberal arts education,'" Director of

February 10, 2005

Publications Jeff Lott said. "I think that no
matter what issues he has to deal with, he
uses that [speech] as his touchstone."
Since his days as a psycholinguistics professor, the concept of "ethical intelligence"
has held strong sway over Bloom. In his
speech, he tied together the Chinese character "li," Plato, Confucius and the color
schemes of Thai and Chinese temples into a
theory of education for Swarthmore that
would work to create civic responsibility.
This might seem like a large vision for
one college president, but ethical principles
have always been central to Bloom's understanding of post-secondary education. "I
was always very interested in trying to
understand moral development and differences and similarities in moral thinking
across cultures," he said. "The way universal determinants of moral thinking undergo cultural transformations, how they
shape what you see is right and how it is
that education develops a critical moral
sense."
For Bloom, education is not a rudderless,
value-free endeavor. Rather, he said, "the
responsibility in education is to develop in
students a critical approach not only to
intellectual issues, but also to ethical issues

to develop through that their own sense of what's right for
them to do as an individual and what's right for society."
The speech outlined how higher education could be purposeful, encouraging students to involve themselves in other
while
cultures in order to create a multicultural world
simultaneously imploring students to take the values they
learn from these global experiences and turn them "into
effective and committed strategies for social change."

Diversity in education and experience

Bloom did not remain on broad visionary plateaus,
however. Halfway into the speech, he named the specific

problem hampering the college's development: the lack of
a diverse, international perspective. His vision could only
happen "through expanded study of languages and cultures on campus, through structured explorations off campus, through effective foreign-study experiences, and
through the creation of richly diverse campus communities." This foreshadowed the establishment of the Foreign
Study Office, the Intercultural Center and initiatives on
diversity in college admissions policies.
"Swarthmore was not as conscientious as it needed to be
about being a richly diverse community," Bloom said.
"Having such a community is a necessary foundation for
teaching to understand across difference, and for teaching to
lead across difference. What it needed to do was to develop
its applications to a diverse world and a global world."
Philip Weinstein, an English professor and member of
the original hiring committee, said Bloom's internationalism was the primary reason he was selected. "Because of
his linguistic background and his interest in European
and non-European cultures, it looked like we had a chance
to enter the world
a larger world," Weinstein said. "We
needed to be teaching more of other cultures."
Before Bloom's appointment, many students studied
abroad, but no institution existed to help their planning
and experience. "A significant number of students studied
abroad before Bloom became president, but for the most
part it was chaotic," Foreign Study Advisor Steve Piker
said in a recent e-mail.
"There was no semester/year abroad program in place
then, procedures for credit for foreign study were not well
worked out, financial aid was not applicable to most studyabroad [programs] then, and the college assumed no
responsibility or direction for most of the study-abroad
done then by its students," he said.
Within a year of becoming president, Bloom created the
Foreign Study Office. Better study-abroad programs for students were identified and endorsed, more departments integrated studying abroad into their programs, and students
could obtain credit for work done abroad more easily. Now,
nearly halfof the student body spends a semester abroad.
In 1990, the year before Bloom's arrival, students of
color were 16.9 percent of the student body. In 2000, that
percentage had risen to 33 percent, a number that has held
relatively steady since.
Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O, appointed in 2000,
said former Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet instituted

policies to find diverse students through new venues.
"We started working with more community outreach
organizations in addition to high schools
doing a lot of
workshops with other agencies that are providing access
to underrepresented populations, either racially or socioeconomically," Bock said.

During his tenure as president, Bloom has faced hard decisions about increasing diversity and has been a

central figure in the raising of staff wages.

Later in his inaugural speech, Bloom again spoke more

about Swarthmore's future. "To the extent we
have not already done so ... [we] must find ways to engage
our students with the full contours of the problems facing
their society and the world," he said. He wanted to
redesign Swarthmore's curricula so that their impact was
not only felt in the classroom's theoretical setting, but that
they resonated forcefully in the wider society. From this
desire sprung the Lang Center for Civic and Social
Responsibility, long-planned by Bloom, college donor
Eugene Lang '3B and former Provost Jennie Keith, and officially opened in the fall of 2003.

"The responsibility in
education is to develop in
students a critical approach not
only to intellectual issues, but
also to ethical issues."
President Al Bloom
The center provides planning and financial support for
student volunteer service groups, partnerships with community organizations, service-based summer internships
and for faculty who design curricula that join academic
topics with community-based work. Keith, now the center's director, believes it reflects Bloom's mission and
character. "He sees the potential, but also the responsibility, of people who have a fine education
who really have
educated intellectual ability to make the world a better
place," she said. "He really believes that, and he sees that
as the mission of the college."

Bloom had to confront harsh criticism after his decision to cut Swarthmore's football team in 2000.

Last November, as the Board of Managers' vote on
Bloom's new staff compensation proposal drew closer, the
Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign organized a panel of speakers from the school's administration,
alumni, faculty, staffand students. The tension was palpable.
Pat James, the Lang Center's associate director, contended
that faculty and students had "hijacked" a staff issue. When
faculty and staff members spoke, they seemed confused
about how to relate to each other
were professors the
staffs equals or part of the administration? Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l looked bored. And Aaron Bartley '97,
one of the Harvard Living Wage Campaign's founders, said
the board belonged to the "upper realms of the racist, classist
and homophobic hierarchy thatrules our country."
Several weeks later, the board adopted Bloom's proposal, raising the college's minimum wage to $10.38 and continuing a benefit bank used for healthcare or childcare
benefits. At the rally held outside the board's meeting, the
campaign's members and supporters celebrated. "I think

February 10, 2005

it's an unbelievable victory for the college and a victory
for the living wage movement," said Julia Smith 'O6.
Political science professor Jeffrey Murer said it marked
"our first victory" in a long campaign for social justice.
The board reacted differently. Chair of the Board
Barbara Mather '65 told The Phoenix that there was "no
chance" that in the future the board would add full childcare to the new compensation package. Last week, Mather
would not clarify whether the board was interested in pursuing the living wage issue further because of financial
constraints or principle.
In his proposal, Bloom was also careful not to include

"living wage" language in order to prevent the college from
being forced to revise its compensation plan accordingly.
He did not rule out raising students' tuition costs and class
sizes in order to pay for the new compensation.
Psychology professor Barry Schwartz said the conflict
over staff compensation complicates Bloom's ideasofethical
intelligence. "I think it [would] betray the tone set by his
inaugural to say the college's money should be directed to
the educational mission of the college and [that] this is not a
part of the educational mission. He doesn't say that,"
Schwartz said. There are, however, "board members who
say that... who think this is peripheral. Al doesn't; I think

that he thinks it's central."
The living wage campaign sees the same divide between
the board and Bloom. "Bloom and the campaign have been
hampered by the constraints of the system of management
at this college," they wrote in a collective statement last
semester, "in which the voices of students, staff and faculty may not be heard equally with those of the Board and
generous donors."
Schwartz said he thought members of the board were
feeling increasingly confronted by competition from other
selective institutions with larger endowments.
Swarthmore's 2003 endowment, $930 million, placed it
ahead of competitors like Amherst and Carleton but behind
colleges including Williams, Wellesley and Grinnell. In the
same year, Swarthmore had the nation's ninth-largest
endowment-to-student ratio.
Wrestling with Swarthmore's staff-compensation package thus raises a debate more profound than economic calculations: To what causes should Swarthmore devote its
funds, which causes shouldreceive priority, and how should
these resources be allocated? So far, at least, it does not seem
the college has been able to answer these questions.
Yet money and financial considerations continue to be
a driving force between the college's decisions. "One of the
things we don't do well and need to make sure is that students understand that the school is completely dependent

on money," Bloom said. "We cannot have financial aid
without money. We cannot have the best faculty without
money. Everything that we want to do depends on having
the resources to do it. And so, everything we do for staff
and the living wage depends on money."

Seeking to move past athletics cuts and controversy
From BLOOM, pg. 10
It was reasonable for Bloom to be so
money-oriented the morning he was interviewed. That afternoon he had an important development meeting
as he does
most afternoons, as the leader of The
Meaning of Swarthmore, the college's most
ambitious capital campaign ever. The
drive has amassed three-quarters of its
$230 million goal for 2006.
A college president's main job is always
to serve as the primary fundraiser, but the
current campaign has led Bloom to focus
on money over other campus matters.

Ethics and decision-making

Speculations are swirling over the
recently discovered letter from Dartmouth's
Dean ofAdmissions condemning the role of
football in academic life.
One conjecture suggests someone from
Swarthmore's Board of Managers leaked it
to the public; another that Bloom and Karl
Furstenberg crafted the letter together in
order to demonstrate to Swarthmore's
board that more elite universities were
considering cutting football. (For the
record, Bloom denied both rumors.)
Regardless of the reason, the decision to
eliminate football at Swarthmore has once
again returned to the spotlight.
The loudest response to the letter's
release was from Mind the Light, a group
that came together after the decision.
Directed by Bill Robinson '6O, a former foot-

ball player, the group has a membership of
about 500 alumni, parents and faculty.
"The group formed as a reaction to how
the decision was made in stealth and in a
hurry," Robinson said. "To be fair to 'ethical intelligence,' they needed to have had
an open discussion, and they did not."
The Board of Managers had been weighing conflicting recommendations from the
Athletic Review Committee in the fall of
2000, but could not come to a consensus.
Less than
hours after the ARC presented
its reports, the board took action. Neil R.
Austrian '6l, a member of the board who
threatened to resign over the decision, told
The Phoenix in December 2000 that the
board decided to take a vote for the first
time in at least 22 years. Eight board members voted against the resolution, which
was leaked to the college community before
an official announcement could be made.
Reflecting on his decision, Bloom said
that 'ethical intelligence" involves "balancing what people believe is best for the school,
even though at times it's going to have what
one hopes [are] short-term negative effects."
He argued, as he did in 2000, that the
decision was made quickly in order to
adjust the recruitment of athletes before
the next class of students was admitted. "If
it were possible to extend the process at the
time, it would have been a much more positive thing to have had alumni input, but
there was tremendous pressure to conclude
the process," he said.
Bloom said he did

not agree with

Furstenberg's opinion that football was
'Antithetical to the academic mission" of
elite colleges. "I think that's absolutely not
the reason why we made the decision, nor do
I think it's necessarily true at all," he said.

"To be fair to 'ethical intelligence/ they needed to have
had an open discussion,
and they did not."
Bill Robinson '6O
Bloom declined to say whether he distributed the letter to any other members of
the Swarthmore administration or board
during the sports cuts decision process.
For Bloom, the decision was the measure needed to redistribute Swarthmore's
athletic resources more equitably among
all of its programs. "You want every group
of students that you pay special attention
to in the admissions process to be a group
that adds diversity to the student body
athletics included," he said.
But not everyone is convinced. Robinson
said he had not seen any improvement in
other sports programs as a result of the football cuts. Moreover, he said, the hiring of
Tom Elverson 75 as an assistant dean is primarily about spin. Officially, Elverson,
trained as a psychological counselor, acts as
the liaison to the athletic department and

fraternities as well as an intermediary for
alumni disenchanted because of the football
cuts. One member of Mind the Light
described it as a "typical Bloom approach:
use PR to try to paper over the damage."
"The people who say that don't know
me," Elverson said. "The people who know
me, know that I'm genuine and fully
believe in this. This in not for PR."
Elverson said that when the football
program was cut he "was saddened by the
way the decision was made, but it was
more for me the actual loss of the sport and
knowing how my father would've felt about

it." After a series of conversations with
Bloom, however, he decided to remain in
contact with the college. "I had to ask
myself, 'Do I want to remain this saddened
and angry until I die?'" he said.
Though Elverson initially proposed to
do volunteer work, Bloom said he wanted
to formalize the relationship and offered
Elverson a part-time contract.
"My goal is not to have [alumni] offer
their checkbooks," Elverson said. "My goal
is to get themreconnected with the campus,
with the students and with Career Services."
"Some alumni are still deeply concerned
about the football program, but I think that
number will only decrease," Bloom said.
"I'm convinced that they will look back and
see that the athletic program has come to be
much more broadly successful than it had
been in the sense that all of our students
who participate in it will have a real sense
of excitement, ownership and excellence."

Love is just around the corner
The best spots on campus for a romantic V-Day rendezvous
BY ALYSSA WORK
aworkl@swarthmore.edu

There's Valentine's Day romance, traditional-style.

It's extra-dark Godiva chocolates that are gone too soon,

leaving nothing but a teasing photo on the box. It's
months-in-advance reservations at overrated restaurants, bouquets of roses delivered straight to your dorm,
red-ribbon bows and god-awful grinning teddy bears

named "Smooches."
And then there's the special kind of Swarthmore
romance: a brand of natural, gray stone-and-oak tree beauty that lends itself to love when you take the time to wander a little. The light and shade of the Crum Woods in the
middle of the afternoon. The sun rising from behind the
train station. The perfect seclusion of a wooden bench far
from the madding crowd.
As the icy weather thaws, so too does a certain coolness
in attitude. The same pretty face that wouldn't lift itself
from the confines of that scarf to acknowledge you in
January may be able to photosynthesize a smile come sun-

nier days. So take advantage of the romance that's right
here on campus in Swarthmore's most love-inspiring hideaways this Valentine's Day.
Who needs long walks on the beach when we've got the
Crum Woods next door?
"It's very cliche, I know, but the Crum is a really beautiful spot," Elizabeth Oppenheimer 'O5 said. "It's the seclusion and the prettiness and the quiet." Swarthmore's very
own 200-acre woodland hideaway is perfect for an evening
ramble, particularly now that a pair of hip waders aren't
necessary to navigate the several miles of thicketed trails
that overlook Crum Creek. A short walk down Harvard
Avenue is Little Crum Creek Park, recommended by
Stefanie Wong 'O6 as "very cute, especially when the trees
start being in bloom."
Behind the holly garden in the southwestern corner of
campus is hidden Crumhenge, home to Swarthmore's
Druid-esque mysterious arrangement of stones. For a
Valentine's Day excursion, pack a picnic basket, a blanket
and some candles
candles also being necessary for any
weird pagan rituals, if that happens to be your idea of

romance.
"I've found a paradise that's trouble proof," sang the
Drifters, "there's room enough for two, up on the roo-oooof." The balcony of Upper Tarble may not be the roof,
exactly (for that you could try scaling the wall of the swimming pool, a viable, if not so romantic, option) but it is a
perpetually unlocked and underused window on the world.
There are few places on campus so well-suited to a romantic banquet of wine and cheese or a late-night heart-toheart, and when the sun shines through the multicolored
glass panes in the afternoon, there are few places on campus as beautiful.
Or wander down from Tarble to the bell tower, which,
as Ethan Deyle 'OB pointed out, "depending on the season
may be cold, and kind of gross" or just a quiet, almost
monastic spot to sit and contemplate pressing questions of
life and love.
Entwined in tangles of rose bushes and shaded by
conifers and sprawling oak trees, Swarthmore's secluded
garden benches are among its most romantic spots for a
Valentine's Day canoodle. Particularly lovely are three
benches overhung by climbing plants in front of the
arboretum offices (in the Terry Shane Teaching Garden)
and, in a wooded area behind the Friends Meeting House,
three quiet benches near the campus's underappreciated
lilac garden. Share a listen to Michael de Jong's croony
"Park Bench Serenade" and absorb the peace of these garden sanctuaries.
I say "romance," you say... "McCabe library"? Well, it's
not a sunset cruise, but the most beautiful place to lay back
and watch the sky light up as the sun goes down is the
third-floor reading lounge of the library. Pull up a comfy
armchair, lay down the orgo textbook for a moment and
invite that hottie in the newspaper room up for a moment
to take in the view. How could anything
even mounds of
compare?

This 'Wedding Date' ripe for a divorce
nature. These include, but are not limited
to: 1) Relationships going from zero to 60
in two seconds flat; 2) People who would
normally avoid each other realizing that
their outfits just coordinate too well for
them not to get together; 3) Dialogue cut
from last summer's Julia Roberts release
being reintroduced; and 4) Rain falling
from skies which were, seconds before,
devoid of clouds. One or two such lapses
are forgivable. The producers of the "The
Wedding Date," however, must have had a
checklist in hand. The film hijacks our
fond indulgence for the genre and takes
us on a complete tour of Everything I
Hate About Bad Romantic Comedies.
Number one: Relationships go from zero
to 60 in two seconds flat. Kat (Messing)
hires male escort Nick Mercer (Dermot
Mulroney) to be her date for her little sister's English wedding. Though she attends
the nuptials with the purpose of kindling
flames of jealousy in her ex, Jeffrey
(Jeremy Sheffield), in less than a week her

will reconcile when Debra recognizes the

mild contempt to fiery passion over the
course offour days. Inclement weather will
be involved.
Okay, so "The Wedding Date" isn't
exactly like that. It's so much worse.

A fluffy romantic comedy is permitted
to violate a certain number of rules of
good moviemaking, as well as laws of

Dana Fox mistakes for affection.
Which leads me to number two: Kat
and Nick are unlikable, both for the audience and each other. Her self-pity complex
is the size of his ego, and they treat each
other with barely concealed condescension. Fox throws them in with exaggeratedly

despicable

characters,

including

Kat's sister Amy (Amy Adams), who has
yet to transition out of the "I'm a Disney
princess, kneel before me" stage of life,
her clueless groom Edward FletcherWooten (Jack Davenport), and Kat's unjustifiably cruel mother (Holland Taylor).

Perhaps the intent is to make the romantic
leads look good in comparison, but the
result is a complete lack of sympathy for
every character in the film.
At least with ample dislike on both sides
one would expect enough material for the
inevitable break-up scene, but here Fox also
missteps. While Kat refers to the practice of
paying for sex as "repugnant," I maintain
that the really repugnant thing in this movie
is that Nick sleeps with Kat while she is
completely trashed and out-of-control. But hj
Kat doesn't seem to mind, so moving on to ...
Number three: Dialogue cut from last
summer's Julia Roberts release is reintroduced. While I'm mentally calling out the
punchlines ("Where did you find him?"
Kat's dad asks. "The yellow pages," Kat and
I chorus together), it's time once more to
attack the script with that handy red pen,
or perhaps more appropriately in this case,
the shredder. The jokes are old, and the
rest of the script is clumsy. Kat delivers all
the plot exposition randomly to strangers
because clearly, despite being personable,
intelligent, gorgeous and successful, she
has no meaningful friendships.
And finally, number four: Rain falls
from skies which were, seconds before,
devoid of clouds. Having the weather mirror the characters' (presumed) emotional
states is the final straw. All parties (actors,
director, writer, God) are guilty as charged.
This is not reality. Worse, it isn't even
or at least, not the'fantasy of

Top 10 reasons nobody's laughing

Sobering Thoughts

Two Thursdays ago, we realized that
Sharpies was a bit somber. We sat around,
waiting for the hearty laughter of people
of all shapes, sizes, colors, and genders,
but it just didn't come. Apparently, space
exploration wasn't that funny. Some people actually like it. We realized our
columns had fallen to the level of Gerrit
and Mac 1 . We realized, we just weren't
funny anymore. Hell, this intro is about
the worst thing we've written yet.
We've spent a lot of time thinking, so

9) Honors: Our intellects are bulging
and our hats are tenting after a year and
a half in the honors program (thanks,

Frank Aydelotte). Hours of seminar have
refined our humor, and if you lowly
course majors don't get it, well screw you.
You stoopid.

8) Women: Apparently being drunk,
immature, irresponsible, and drunk all
the time is not attractive. We hit the gym,
got some seis packs and realized that the
secret source of our humor was always in
our fat asses (so Jon is still kind of funny,
but Emiliano just has an incredible ass).
7) Indie Rock: We used to spend our
time listening to class acts like Group X
and Stephen Lynch (if you don't know
who they are, download "Too Many Guys"
by Group X or "Why Your Mommy Left
Us" by Stephen Lynch). Then we became

uptight, condescending posers who chill
at Olde Club and wallow in our angst-rid-

den $40,000-a-year-educated lives. "Ice
age, heat wave, can't complain," sang
Modest Mouse, and we didn't smile for
days.

Life is meaningless, we
don't have a job, and
we've stopped bringing joy
to people's lives.

we thought about how our
insult was just a result of our patriarchal
society and then we flagellated ourselves
for being such misogynists.
It all came to a head when Emiliano
started protesting the column in his own
room while Jon did yoga on the coffee
table. The tea came to a boil and we found
Gentry's mom,

nirvana.

2) You: We said we weren't funny anymore and you're still reading this. You're
just too easy. Where was the public outcry
when we wrote about space exploration?
We haven't had a sobering thought since
2003.

We skipped six because we don't
enjoy writing columns as much as we
used to. We used to write for the love,
from the heart, to the ladies' pants. Now
we just do it for the $24.
5)

4) We were never actually funny. You
were just stupid.
3) Now

that they didn't name the new
dorm after us, there's no point in trying.
6) We probably aren't going to make
the word requirement, so we thought we'd
add this one. So yeah, six was that we
took Peace Studies, so we became all sensitive and shit. Every time we made fun of

1) We can't come up with 10 reasons for
anything, and once we lost the top 10 list,
our column was done. Life is meaningless, we don't have a job, and we've
stopped bringing joy to people's lives. If
only we were post-ironic (apparently,
we're only ironic).

The Ethics Committee

The main thing we've learned from your correspondence this week is that the pressing ethical issue on
campus is how much food you can steal from Sharpies.
We promise we'll deal with this important question in
an upcoming issue. (Though, if you're having a personal ethical attack that's impairing your ability to
perform basic life tasks, send us an e-mail and we
promise an individual response.) For now, let's talk
about the second most pressing issue (at least for seniors): the job search. If you're not a senior, clip this column and re-read it in a few years. We promise broader
questions next week.

We realize that if you're in the middle of the job
search, you're also trying to pretend this process doesn't
exist. We also realize that if rounding your GPA to the

14

We all agree that the answer is no, but it took us a
while to reconcile our ethics with the fear that they
might ruin our lives. The reason this seems clear-cut is
that you made an agreement, one your employer is
entitled to take as a commitment. Whether or not you
signed a written contract (and, if you did, whether or
not your employer could really enforce it in court), you
certainly made an implicit contract. So, once you have
accepted a job, you cannot ethically continue to search
for or pursue other jobs. (Suggestion: Spend your
energy finding jobs for your friends.) Look at it this
way: What if your employer offered you a job, then
took it back three weeks later when she found a better
applicant? Ouch.
This ethical conclusion is pretty well-accepted. In
many industries, backing out on one job for another is
considered breach of contract and certainly questionable practice. We're told that at Haverford, where
they're pretty serious about ethics, you can even be
expelled if you do this. (Next column: Is it ethical for
ethics columnists to include third-hand facts without
fact-checking?)
The best way to deal with this situation is to find
ways of avoiding the ethics conundrum altogether. It's
your responsibility, and your prerogative, to ask for
more time making your decision, and to ask your preferred employer to speed up his process. You don't
even need an excuse
unlike backing out on a job

February 10,

2005

after taking it, asking for another week to consider, or
using one job offer as leverage for another, is perfectly
acceptable.

There is an acknowledged exception to the general
rule: You're allowed to back out on a job for a Rhodes,
Marshall or Fulbright. There may not be a clear ethical basis for this; it's just that these awards are so prestigious that people are wowed by them.
We spent some time discussing whether there's one
more exception. What if you can't hurry things up
with more-desirable job two, and, while you don't plan
to pursue any additional jobs, you want to commit to
less-desirable job one and wait to hear about job two,
planning to switch to that one if you get an offer? The
ethically responsible, gut-wrenching thing to do is still
to choose: Take the first job and forgo the other, or
decline the first job and accept the risk.
The good news is, first, you have a job! Second, commitment will almost certainly make, you happier. It's
like choosing a college: Sure you could have spent four
years agonizing about why you didn't go to Williams
(and maybe you did), but you're better off working
hard here, enjoying your friends and appreciating
falafel bar when it comes. Commit yourself wholeheartedly to what you chose and to not second-guessing. Withdraw your other applications, and start the
apartment hunt.
A note on ethics and morals: People have been asking us about the difference between ethics and morals.
We would say that morals are the big questions and
ethics the small, concrete ones we are more qualified
(by which we mean willing) to answer. Both of these
are different than etiquette questions, for which you
should consult Miss Manners, who, we swear, is hilarious.

BY ALEXIS PERNAS

Most of you have seen him before, standing
behind his two-table station in the foyer of Tarble.
But how many have actually stopped and looked at
Jeff Smith's jewelry stand, which he calls "The
Jewelry Mine"? Smith, along with several other
vendors, brings his fashionable and artistic products to Swarthmore's front door, reminding us that
there is a world outside of our little community.
Smith's "door-to-door service" is probably one
of his biggest perks. Recent customer Mu Yang 'O7
explained that she is not able to get off campus to
get hoops for her newly pierced ears, so she likes
that "The Jewelry Mine" comes to Swarthmore.
"I'm pretty excited whenever he comes [because] I
can update my selection," Yang said.
Smith has quite a selection. He proudly commented that he successfully filled two tables with
his colorful items, which include earrings, necklaces and bracelets.
But this varied selection is the result of a lot of
hard work. Smith, whose father taught him to
make jewelry, produces all of the beaded pieces
himself. His favorite and most diverse creations
are his earrings. To assemble each unique pair, he
obtains glass beads from Mexico and puts them on
a headpin, mixing like and complementary colors.
Yang said Smith has a very wide color selection, making it easy to find jewelry to match any
outfit. "My favorite are these chandelier earrings,"
she said. "The beads are cool because they are this
iridescent color
black when you just look at
them, but purple or green depending on the light."
Smith uses his innate artistic abilities to make
funky designs and unique pieces. He makes many
of the necklaces personally by combining beads,
colored rope and jeweled flowers. Since his work
constantly changes as trends and styles change,
Smith said he brings something different with
each visit to Swat. In addition to the handmade
jewelry, Smith also obtains brand-name metal
pieces, like sterling silver necklaces imported
from Italy.
Smith is not just an ordinary retailer, however.
He dedicates time and effort to traveling to
Swarthmore from his home state of New Jersey a

THE PHOENIX

couple of times a month. When he first came here
in the spring of 1986, "Swarthmore was a blind try,"
he said. No stranger to this sort of living, Smith
learned the ins and out of jewelry vending from his
father, who began selling jewelry in 1979. Smith
also sets up "The Jewelry Mine" at other schools,
including Rutgers, Newark and Montclair State
University, all of which are in New Jersey. "The
space everywhere is different," he said. "My success depends on how well a student center is utilized."

"The beads are cool because
they are this iridescent
color...purple or green
depending on the light."

How does one obtain space to sell us cool stuff?
Anyone interested in selling items must first talk
to the Office Coordinator, Linda Bordley, whose
office is in the back of the bookstore. Then they
must fill out a form indicating specific rules and
regulations and submit a $5O fee and references
from two other colleges where they have sold their
products in the past.
The Tarble foyer is the only place for vendors
on campus, as they are not allowed to showcase

their products outside. Credit card purchases are
not allowed, and neither is the selling of products
similar to those available at the Bookstore.
Vendors call and book their times in advance so
that students have an idea of when they are going
to show up. Regarding Smith specifically, Bordley
is an enthusiastic customer.
"His jewelry is affordable, and he is a very nice
man. I have nothing but good things to say about

him," she said.
Smith and "The Jewelry Mine" will be on campus Feb. 18 and again on March 3. But don't worry
if you can't make it. "I'll be here until the display
case gets tenure," Smith said. "That's my goal."

ALEX LEADER-SMITH
Live of Swarthmore comedy, and
The Prodigal Prodigy
I am but a half-inflated whoopee
cushion. But for one afternoon,
decided to play with the big boys
'
Within minutes of arriving a
the Boy Meets Tractor headquarters (a.k.a. senior Sam Berger's room)
I was assisting with my first sketch. "Hooked on Phonics" was a sub
tie, nuanced piece focusing on phonics as an allegory for crack
Prepubescent junkies would commit all sorts of heinous offenses to
gain reading-material "fixes," then awkwardly and painstakingly
sound them out. It was a brilliant sociological commentary on the fail
ures of the urban education system, masquerading as a comedy piece
or perhaps vice versa. Either way, I needed to pack it with some jokes
And simple knock-knocks weren't going to cut it.
My mind raced for the perfect punch line as BMT fired out ideas
with gusto. A 12-step phonics recovery program! Illicit phoniqs distri
bution rings! Undercover phonics busts! I was yanked from my own
thought process into a critique of others' exclamations. Madalyn
Baldanzi 'OB squealed in delight at the thought of playing a bibliophile
who frolics through Borders rubbing herself with books. Meanwhile,
pondered the logistics of escaping store security. Others applauded the
notion of a Phonics support group. I debated the best name for such an
Phonics Anonymous? Phonicians Anonymous
organization
Phonicaholics Anonymous? This definitely wasn't my most inspired
moment. I was merely meddling with others' ideas instead of letting
my own creative juices flow.
In stark contrast was Stu. Stu Simpson (alias provided to protec
future political prospects) was the sort of person whose creative juice
flow could be stopped only with a pipe wrench. He's also the sort of per
son who would read that last sentence and quickly analogize "creative
juices" with another cruder, less ethereal bodily fluid. In this way, we
differed. I like to consider myself a connoisseur of high-brow humor
despite my occasional use of bad puns; Stu's self-admittedrole in BMT
is to make jokes about blow jobs.
Now, I wasn't offended by BMT's scatological humor, even if it did
disrupt my own comedic rhythm
cable television has already accli
mated me to the lewd, crude and simply distasteful. The problem was
that these jokes failed the grandmother test. Presently, I have a
Phoenix column and receive grandmotherly approbation. I write abou
the Knit-Wits and get e-mails like, "Sounds like knitting was fun! I'd be
happy to help you learn!" (This actually happened.) I doubt Stu's par
ticipation in BMT fosters the same sort of intergenerational bonding:
Grandma Simpson: "Stu, dear, how is your little comedy group
going?"

Stu: "Great, Grandma! We just finished this awesome Disney parody!

Grandma Simpson: "Oh my, that's nice."
Stu: "Yep! But we're a little heavy on the bondage and pedophilia
jokes—l'd love to balance them with more fellatio-related humor."
Grandma Simpson: *heart attack*
Thus was the dilemma. Even if I unleashed my creative juices and
launched headstrong into the artistic orgy that was BMT, how could I
endure traumatizing my family? Leader-Smith clan honor is just too
strong.

While I pondered, BMT kept churning out jokes. They seemed to
thrive on their own dysfunctionality. Sam co-wrote a brilliant sketch
featuring Jesus and Lucifer as college roommates. ("Lucifer, I can't
smoke that joint! If the RA found out, I'd be crucified!") It was one of
the funniest things I'd ever seen, and reason enough everyone should
attend the next Boy Meets Tractor show. I'll certainly be there
though only in the audience. While I have huge appreciation for BMT's
work, my humor just seems to evolve better in private. The dysfunctionality that propels BMT to ever-greater comedic heights throws me
off my game. And besides, Sam clearly has the Bible puns already covered.

My Latin

mami

I had a normal conversation with
my mother the other day, as normal
as they go with us. When I got off the
phone, I began to contemplate

whether our exchange could have
occurred between any other mother
and daughter. We were talking about
time management, or my lack of it.
"Camila, if you concentrated more
on your studies you would find you
have more free time than you
thought," she said. This seems like a
perfectly normal thing for a parent
to nag about, but this seemingly normal statement escalated into some-

CAMILA
HARRIGAN-LABARCA
The Spanish Perspective

thing much larger.
"Pero mami, I don't have time to
sit down and figure out a way to
manage my time," I protested. As
soon as it escaped my mouth I regretted saying it. I could feel the waves of
her agitation coming through the
telephone. "iCamila, como se te

ocurre hablarme de esa manera?" she
said to me. "Camila, how could you think of speaking to me that way?" At
this point my (hereditary) stubbornness kicked in. I told her that I didn't
mean for it to come out that way and that she was overreacting. Once again,
I said the wrong thing. Lesson number one for those with Latin mothers:
Never tell them they are overreacting. They never overreact and they are

always right.
I began trying frantically to save myself. It was too late. Anything I was
going to say from then on would be wrong. "Pero mami, I didn't do anything
wrong, I was just trying to explain," I pleaded. ";No!" she said. "You don't
treat me well, Camila, and one day it's going to be the death of me." I rolled
my eyes. "Are you rolling your eyes?" she asked. "No, of course not, mami"
I said sweetly. She didn'tbelieve me; she knew me too well. "I would never
speak to my mother that way she would have smacked me clear across the
face, its because we live in the U.S. isn't it, you American children don't
understand respect," she said. I sighed heavily.

Lesson number one for Latin mothers: They
never overreact and they are always right.
At this point any normal mother-daughter pair would probably have
apologized or maybe parted ways to calm down. This would never happen
to my mother and me because it would be much too easy. Next conversation
phase: the Guilt Trip. "Camila, you just don't know how hard you are on
me. If we lived in Chile things would be different...." She likes to use the "if
we lived in Chile..." technique. "Mami, honestly, it wouldn't be any different," I protested. "Are you calling me a liar, Camila?" I needed to start backing off. "No, mami, of course not," I pleaded.
Next comes the heavy preaching: "Camila, now you've given me a
migraine and this will last the whole next week." She began to cry. "Why do
you do this to me? Do you enjoy hurting your mother? Eres tan desagradecidal In Chile kids live at home while attending college, they maintain a
relationship with their families. Instead you run off to leave us all behind
and call once in a while to upset your poor mother." The only response I am
"allowed" to give is "si mama...si mami...si mama...si mami...si mama."
"Camila, when you say 'si mama' I know you're just trying to shut me up!"
she says. So I try other responses and she says, "Just be quiet and listen."
It's a lose-lose situation.
She then brings in my love life, of course: "So that boyfriend of yours,
how are things going?" I tell her they are all right but that I miss him. "So
you two have things in common? It is hard to be with someone that is so different. Not to say you're going to get married soon, but have you thought of
whether you want children or not?" I tell her I'm not thinking about that
right now. "Well, you should be. I won't be around forever and I want grandchildren; you've gotten too old to be pleasant," she says.
Despite everything I try to do, everything ends up in crying and scream-

People think that Spanish soap operas are funny because they show an
exaggerated reality. I regret to inform you that that is reality. It is my reality. However, I do not want you to think that my mother and I only fight. We
do, frequently, but it's just normal for us. When we aren't fighting we really enjoy each other's company. We frequently cook or watch movies together. The problem is that we are too similar and stubborn in our ways. She
thinks I am too American and I think she is too controlling. Hopefully
Swatties will recognize that they are not alone in their crazy family dramas,
or perhaps they will now consider themselves luckier to have less drama.
ours just involve much more
My family, like every family, has its issues
crying, screaming and Spanglish.

Al Bloom's legacy
If there's one initiative that exemplifies both Al
Bloom's administrative strengths and his ethical philosophy, it's the increase in Swarthmore's diversity
after the admission of the class of 2000. It was an example ofBloom pushing through an initiative that was his
baby but dealt with someone else's sphere of control. It
was also an example ofhis being very willing to take a
very radical action for what he saw was the greater
good of the college, and very forcefully commit to one
value over others when necessary.
Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet had, like her
predecessors, been trying to maintain a balance
between diversity of background and standards of aca-

demic achievement; Bloom's achievement was convinc-

ing her to upset that balance. Many already accepted
the theory that hidden racism in the school system and
unspoken discouragement in the applications process
that kept the school from identifying high-achieving
students, but Bloom was the one to take some initiative
to directly fight it. The class of 2000 represents a strong,
concerted effort to look for qualified students and
accepting that the traditional metrics of SATs and GPAs

were biased and flawed, admitting a far higher percentage of minority students and accepting lower numerical achievement as a consequence.
Not only did that class meet all of Swarthmore's
standards of performance, subsequent admitted classes
have gone back up in average GPA and SAT with no
drop in the number of minority students who apply and
are admitted. Rather than remain mired in endless
debate over whether this strategy of forcibly shattering
the glass ceiling was feasible, Bloom committed himself
to trying it and, working behind the scenes, proved it in

practice.

The football cuts are another example, if a more
questionable one. Once again, the problem was not a

talk of the drain Swarthmore football was
resources and admissions slots
some time. Once again Bloom
took a radical step, convincing the Board of Managers
to take action that might anger part of the community
just as radically increasing affirmative action was
controversial when Bloom entered office
but would
ultimately be, in his mind, for the good of the school.
Anyone who knows the degree to which Bloom's rhetoric about creating a diverse, integrated community has
informed his policies would reject the idea that the football cuts were about Bloom's dislike ofathletes. We can
argue over whether Bloom's decision in this case was
wise, but his role here was the same, to look for a bold
and decisive action to take rather than allow the problem to fester. Unfortunately, Bloom here erred too much
on the side of boldness, failing to fully predict the public backlash or think of ways to deal with it before voices started getting raised and fingers pointed.
The problem with the football cuts exemplifies what
we see as Bloom's greatest administrative weakness
while working very hard behind the scenes to influence
key people to work with him, he has been less successful at working within the scenes, creating a public
image for himself and his policies that can win the sympathies of comparative outsiders who might otherwise
new one

exerting on the school's
had been going on for

misinterpret his boldness for hubris. Those who have
worked with him universally praise his ethical sense
and his skills at administration, but the many who
have never gotten a chance to speak to him, like the
members of the Mind the Light organization, are free to
represent him as an amoral, capricious, dishonest
leader.

This would be a problem for any leader the college
president is a favorite target when rhetoric requires
personifying a particular policy
but it would be less
of one if Bloom were better at making people understand the rationale for his actions without having to dig
through archives to research them first. There's much
good Bloom has yet to do in his career here, and we
believe he could do it more effectively if he was better
at communicating his grand visions to the outside
world. Our study of his policy leads us to believe we
have many reasons to like our president, but it'd be easier if he made it easier for us to get to know him.

TARU TAYLOR
being lives within the
context of cosmic deterGadfly
mination.
Man, as such, analyzes. He philosophizes
when he breaks down the cosmos into categories.

According to Janheinz Jahn's classic "Muntu: African

Culture and the Western World," the African has four
categories: Muntu, Kintu, Hantu and Kuntu. "Muntu"
(plural "Bantu") denotes human beings or personal
forces endowed with intelligence, for Muntu includes the
living and the dead, gods and spirits, and God, the "Great
Muntu." "Kintu" (plural "Bintu") denotes inanimate
things as forces which can be manipulated by a Muntu.
"Hantu" is the category of space and time. "Kuntu"
denotes modality or "modal forces" like beauty and
laughter. As suggested by the common stem, the four categories ofAfrican philosophy are functions of Ntu.
Ntu is "the universal force as such." Ntu is "Being
itself, the cosmic universal force, which only modern,
rationalizing thought can abstract from its manifestations. Ntu is that force in which Being and beings coalesce." Ntu never occurs apart from the four categories,
for, to the African, all beings are forces constantly in
motion. Ntu determines his cosmic understanding just
as the Force determines the Jedi Knight's.
From an Afrocentric perspective, Ntu is the thesis.
Aristotelian Substance is the antithesis, but only
because of European imperialism, which is based on the
example of Alexander the Great, who used Aristotelian
logic as a tool of world conquest.

According to Aristotle, who almost single-handedly
authored the Eurocentric cosmology, Substance has priority as the first category from which the other nine follow. They are quantity, relation, quality, where, when,
position, having, action and passion. As the African
worldview unadulterated by European pretense to white
supremacy, Ntu is the thesis. Aristotelian Substance, as
championed by Alexander the Great and the likes of
Christopher Columbus and Cecil Rhodes, is the antithesis. Here's my question, and it's not academic. Is a
Hegelian synthesis of traditional African culture and socalled "Western civilization" possible?
Japan has taught us that such a synthesis is possible.
Zen Buddhism, which manifests as the samurai ethos
called bushido, was the thesis. Commodore Perry of the
"black ships," the American who imperialistically commanded, on behalf of Anglo-Saxon empire, that Japan
open its ports to world trade in 1853, embodied the
antithesis. The Meiji Restoration (1868-1912), during
which feudal Japan modernized and metamorphosed its
samurai into bureaucrats, achieved the synthesis of
Japanese culture and Western science & technology.
Then Japan regressed to champion pure warrior
ethos against Western bourgeois pathos, that clash of
thesis versus antithesis called World War 11. The antithesis won, but it was a Pyrrhic victory, for in the aftermath
Japan and its brother-at-arms, Germany, rose from the
ashes, phoenix-like, as syntheses of military discipline
and capitalist production in command of Asia and
Europe. The samurai of today is a synthesis who uses
"Western civilization" as an instrument of his will,
which is defined by bushido, determined by Zen.
What is contemporary Asia if it is not the Greater
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere envisioned by the samurai warlords of the mid-twentieth century? What is the
European Union if it is not the Germanic Union, the
Fourth Reich conquered by economic discipline rather
than crude military might? The synthesis of Kultur and
Substance, Nietzsche's superman, lives in Germany. The
synthesis of Zen and Substance, the modern samurai,
lives in Japan. Will the synthesis of Ntu and Substance,
the Garveyite, one day command Pan-Africa, on the con-

tinent and abroad?

residents, though neither of us noticed the sticker until a
few months ago. We're beginning to realize, however,
that a lot of things are not being noticed on Parrish's single-sex halls in particular, the recurring discomfort of
first-year female residents who specifically request
Parrish for its ovaries-only milieu. Across campus,
there are 40 members of the Class of'oB who live on halls
restricted to women. Yet Parrish and the third floor of
Dana also house a significant number of sophomore,
junior and senior women, many of whom have no explicit allegiance to the single-sex residential environment.
Do freewheeling, party-hopping, boy-banging (pardon
our French) upperclassmen have a right to invade the
all-girl territory? Do female first-years who choose single-sex housing feel that their preferences are being
respected by Parrish upperclassmen like ourselves who,
truth be told, really just want that 45-second walk to
Kohlberg in the morning?
Most of the women we interviewed about the good,

the bad and the ugly (male guests peeing on the toilet
seat) of a carelessly enforced single-sex life have come to
enjoy the close-knit relationships that can develop on a
single-sex hall, whether or not they requested the all-girl
environment in the first place. Opinions differ drastically, however, when female students are asked to discuss
issues surrounding men on the hall. Many of the young
women we talked to raised issues regarding male visitors at late hours and use of the bathrooms—"lt shouldn't happen, just go to the other end of the hall!" In the
words of one first-year, "You wouldn't think boys would
be staying the night on an all-girls hall," a position
which certainly makes sense considering many young
women request residence in a single-sex environment
because well, they don't want men residing there. Yet
for upperclassmen accustomed to co-ed life, this may not
feel like an uncommon occurrence
in fact, many said
they too are made to feel uncomfortable when male students visit and are largely unprepared for the negative
reactions they receive. "I got the funniest looks." "I felt
like I had to defend myself." Other female students
doggedly argue that male visitors should be accepted on
the hall simply "because that's life, that's college."
Many of the non-frosh we spoke with picked into single-sex halls (especially prime Parrish real estate) for
reasons like issues of location, room size, clean bathrooms and "the steady availability of romantic comedy
viewing." Yet a fair number of female first-years make a
conscious decision to live in bona fide single-sex housing
a decision that Swarthmore's administration
makes an implicit promise to respect. In the current situation, is either group of women getting what they
signed up for? Does Swarthmore have a responsibility to
strictly enforce single-sex policies for the students who
request an all-female hall? Perhaps single-sex housing,
as it currently exists, creates an environment of discomfort for virgins and non-virgins alike.

People at Swarthmore complain about the college's lack of
political and ideological diversity.
But I'm the first to counter that
there is plenty of diversity of
opinion on the left side of the
political spectrum. Take the issue

of free trade. Even a rabid freemarket economist and a militant
anti-capitalist can both consider
themselves Democrats.

RACHEL ACKOFF

So when you bring up the topic
of fair trade coffee at Swarthmore
you'd think you'd be in for some
pretty raucous debates. But what
fascinates me is how even the

Organic Politics

most staunchly neoliberal economist and the ultimate hippie leftist can get behind the fair trade

coffee movement, which, rather
than seeking to override market forces, merely promotes con-

scious consumerism.
Fair trade certification allows consumers in wealthy countries
to identify products that guarantee a fair price for producers in
developing countries. Currently, North American consumers pay
between $4 and $ll a pound for coffee bought from growers for
only 80 cents. Fair trade coffee farmers are guaranteed a price of
SL26 per pound for their harvest, allowing them to improve their
families' health care and nutrition, keep their kids in school, and
use on environmentally sustainable farming practices.
But let's face it
even the hippie leftist knows that drinking a
cup of fair trade coffee (or even several hundred) isn't going to
change the global economic system. Of 3.6 trillion dollars worth of
goods exchanged globally, fair trade accounts for only 0.01 percent.
As of January 2003, only six percent of US consumers had heard of
fair trade coffee and only two percent had actually bought any.

So then why does the leftist spend her time campaigning for
Swarthmore College to switch to exclusively fair trade coffee in
Kohlberg, the Science Center and Sharpies? Because in addition to
directly benefiting the fair trade coffee farmers,

it opens a critical

dialogue on an issue that isn't talked about enough, even at

Swarthmore.

Probably fewer than the 2 percent of Americans who have pur-

chased fair trade coffee know about Chapter 11 of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Buried within the 555page NAFTA document is a little-known provision that has been
manipulated by crafty corporate lawyers to give corporations
unprecedented power to challenge environmental, human health
and labor protections. Chapter 11 has been stretched to allow foreign corporations the ability to sue the national government of the
United States, Mexico or Canada for compensation if a government policy "harms" their profits. Since the implementation of
NAFTA in 1994, numerous cases have been filed by corporations
alleging that a variety of national, state and local environmental
and public health policies diminish their profits. The damages
claimed by the companies add up to more than $l3 billion in taxpayer money.
But while drinking a cup offair trade coffee doesn't change the
laws governing our global trade system, it does allow a space for
critical dialogue on the topic. If we switch to fair trade coffee, it'll
be a lot easier to squeeze the topic of NAFTA into a conversation
about hot guys at Kohlberg Coffee Bar. It'll make it a lot easier for
two Swatties poring over their physics problem set in Cornell to
take a study break and discuss the plight of impoverished coffee
farmers in Columbia.
And we shouldn't discount the importance of conscious consumerism even if it's just that
consumerism. The concept of votthe more dollars
ing with your dollars isn't exactly democracy
you have, the more votes you get. But since the market system
doesn't seem to be disappearing any time in the immediate future,
it's vital for a wealthy institution with a lot of dollar votes like
Swarthmore to vote its conscience. A college with significant purchasing power that expounds a mission of cultivating ethical intelligence is the ideal customer for fair trade products.
Currently, the supply offair trade far outstrips the demand. Of
the 170 million pounds of fair trade coffee produced globally only
35 million were bought on fair trade terms. Any economist would
tell you that demand needs to increase in order for the market for
this environmentally and socially responsible good to grow.
Already 15 colleges and universities brew only certified fair trade
coffee on their campuses. If Swarthmore would like to continue to
consider itself a leader among socially just educational institutions, it'd better get on the bandwagon. After all, fair trade coffee
is brewing the critical dialogue that will bring about social and
economic change, and Swarthmore doesn't want to be left out of
the conversation.

Courts killing kids

op-art

by

eliza

blair

In the next month, the U.S.
Supreme Court will decide Roper
v. Simmons, determining once
and for all whether it is legal to
execute minors in the United

States.
It's about time. For years, the
U.S. has led the pack in executions of juvenile offenders. Except
now there's hardly any pack left
to lead. Of the three countries that
still executed minors in 2000, one,
Pakistan, has abolished the juvenile death penalty, and another,
MAYA SCHENWAR
Congo, has established a moratorium. That leaves us in the cozy
Swat Meets World company of our fave, Iran. And
according
to
the
Iranian
Parliament, it too is poised to give
the juvenile death penalty the boot.
The United Nations recently ruled that executing offenders
under the age of 18 is contrary to international law, a resolution
that was supposed to be "binding on all countries." Not that the
U.S. ever likes to get bound in anything, but with this one, we
went a little overboard
in the past five years we've put 12 juveniles to death.
We already lead the world in food aid, scientific output and

soybean production; we hardly need another claim to fame.
Besides, executing kids is not popular even within the United
polls show that 70 percent of U.S. citizens oppose the
States
juvenile death penalty.

So why is the law still hanging around? Maybe it comes down
to a concept of "justice" regardless of circumstances. It's a concept
that the rest of the world is questioning and a concept that's been
haunting us for a while. This "justice" is not necessarily "an eye
for an eye," but it is a drive for generalization and a denial of
specifics, an assumption the simplest solution is always the best.
The last election's results are proof that this drive for simplification is appealing, especially nestled in with our starry-eyed fantasy of "equal opportunity." Assuming a level playing field means
no one has to mess with individual circumstances, contradictory
evidence and personal stories. One law for all means that no one
has to make rules for affirmative action, determine the cut-off
lines for abortions, judge who should have a gun and who shouldn't. Issues that aren't transparent are made so, and that makes
everyone (with a Mercedes and a top-notch lawyer) feel better.
But you can't Occam's Razor-ize people. When you try,
extraordinary violence can be passed off as "equality" without a
flinch.

The juvenile death penalty is a good example. Supporters of the
executions argue that those who are old enough to commit a crime
are old enough to suffer for it. However, psychologists and biologists have been arguing the opposite for years, saying that adolescent brains are still in a state of development
as are their cognitive abilities, emotions, judgment and impulse control. The
American Medical Association filed a brief for Roper v. Simmons,
stating that to execute those younger than 18 is to "hold them
accountable not just for their acts, but also for the immaturity of
their neural anatomy and psychological development."
The death penalty has never been found to deter crime, and

letter

this fact seems especially relevant for teens, the most impulsive

members of the population. When Christopher Simmons broke
into his neighbor's house to rob her and ended up killing her, he
probably did not devise a chart of pros and cons beforehand.
Other laws acknowledge that teens are still in a state ofmental
development
we don't allow them to vote, join the military or
enter into a contract until 18.
What's more, all of the biases entangled in the system of capital punishment apply even more to juveniles. Like the general
death row population, sentenced teen offenders tend to be black or
Latino, though whites are just as likely to be convicted of murder.
Being 16, the offenders usually have (surprise) no money. So, they
are represented by public defenders, many of whom have never
taken on a capital case and are paid about $2,000 per job. It's no
wonder that sometimes, empty-pocketed teens get executed
or
almost executed
simply based on a class-biased judicial system.
Like most teen offenders, Christopher Simmons of Roper v.
Simmons endured a childhood of abuse, neglect and potential
mental illness. Clearly he should be held accountable for his
crime. But simply matching cruel and unusual crime with cruel
and unusual punishment doesn't work; we realized that awhile
ago. It's time we recognized that the straightest line, the quickest
and most universal answer, is not always the wisest.
Hopefully the Court's decision will reflect the national and
international consensus. When it comes to executions, every child
should be left behind.

Wellness Committee undistorting Swat
Dear Editor:

For anyone who missed Ryan Croken 'os's column
"Good at Swarthmore, bad at life" (Feb. 3, pg. 15), we'd

like to commend Croken on an articulate and accurate representation of how life at Swarthmore "distorts time, space, reality and happiness." Last semester, a group of 14 students came together in partnership with Worth Health Center as the Student
Wellness Committee to address concerns like Ryan's,
specifically to design workshops, study breaks and
weekly activities to educate students about issues like
nutrition, stress relief and sleep.
The idea of the Wellness Committee is to offer a proactive alternative both to rituals of excess and to misery poker. During finals weeks we brought you homemade cookies and milk, yoga in the Science Center and
finger-painting. Here's what we have planned for this
semester: Hall study breaks designed to make your
heart light and your body pliable; working with
Sharpies to get healthier alternatives; compiling a
recipe book called "Making the Best of It: Recipes for a
Toaster Oven Gourmet" (please submit your best
February 10, 2005

Sharpies recipes to cbuffiel@swarthmore.edu); a
speaker series on the healing arts in mid-March to
answer students' questions about alternative health
care; and more yoga classes in the phys. ed. and dance
departments. We're also planning to bring a meditation teacher to campus to get a weekly meditation
group going.
Over the school year, we've been educating ourselves in stress-relief techniques like massage, acupressure, meditation, and laughter yoga in order to
share them with the Swarthmore community. We also
keep a running list of campus-friendly activities ranging from flag football and knitting to steam facials
and shopping-cart racing. Look for us at your local
hall study break. Brought to you by the Student
Wellness Committee: Keeping Swarthmore Real Since
2004.

A Garnet swimmer competes in the backstroke against the Dickinson Red Devils last weekend.

Garnet women surge to win
BY PHIL LEE

pleel@swarthmore.edu

When the Dickinson Red Devils came to Ware Pool
last weekend for a meet against the Garnet, good and
evil battled it out in the water. While the Swarthmore
women's swim team put together its best performance
of the season to defeat the Devils, the men struggled and
fell. The Garnet women triumphed over Dickinson in
an exciting meet that ended in a final score of 107-98.
The team showed exceptional mental strength as many
players overcame colds and other sicknesses in order to
rise to victory. The men's team, though, was unable to
duplicate the women's stellar performance and fell
132-71 to the Devils.
The women's team quickly took the lead, winning
the first three races of the meet. Michele Horn 'O7,
Melanie Johncilla 'O5, Whitney Nekoba 'OB and Jennie
Lewis 'OB teamed up to win the 400-yard medley relay
with a time of 4:1017. Katherine Reid 'O5 then added
another win by capturing the 1000 freestyle in a time
of 11:1185. Nekoba then led the Garnet sweep of the 200
freestyle, followed by Patricia Funk 'O6 and Lewis.
Franny Zhang 'OB won the fourth event for the
Garnet in the 200 IM, with a time of 2:15.74. At this
point, the Garnet had won four out offive total events,
leading the Devils 62-31 Victory seemed imminent. Yet,

in an unusual display of looseness, the Garnet lost the
next four events to the Devils, tying the score at 94-94.
With the score even going into the last and final
event, the 400-freestyle relay, both teams were feeling
the pressure. The Garnet came through in record-setting fashion as Zhang, Kathyn Jantz 'O5, Johncillaand
Sarah Cotcamp 'O7 captured the event and broke a 14year-old pool record with a time of 3:40.90, edging out
the Dickinson squad (3:4189).
Coach Sue Davis had nothing but praise for her
women's team following the win. "It was one of the
best meets in 30 years," she said.
"We played very well. A lot of the girls were sick
that day, but many still managed to break their personal best times. This meet definitely helped to boost
team morale," Horn said.
In the more disappointing half of the meet, the
Garnet men's team was unable to defeat the Devils.
Suffering from the recent suspension of five athletes,
the men only captured one out of 11 total events in the
meet. The sole winner for the Garnet was Andrew
Frampton 'OB, who prevailed in the 1,000 freestyle with
a time of 10:29.87.
The Garnet squads now have a week to prepare
before heading into the Centennial Conference championships, which will be held Feb. 18-20 at Franklin

and Marshall.

Swat men falter against Penn
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

Although

the groundhog
decided that it's still going to
be winter for a while, the men's
tennis team opened up its
spring season last weekend
with a match against a tough

squad from the University of
Pennsylvania. It was a rough
contest for the Garnet, who didn't capture a single set in its 70 loss against the Division I
Quakers.
Penn opened the competition

with a sweep of the doubles matches. Brian Park 'O6 and Jonathan
Reiss 'O7 went down first, losing
their doubles match 8-3 to Justin
Launer and Jimmy Fairbanks of
Penn. Zach Rodd 'O6 and Jonathan
Lo 'OB in second doubles, and
Justin Durand 'O5 and Sam Sidhu
'O7 in third doubles suffered simiTHE PHOENIX

lar fates, losing by scores of 8-0 and
8-3, respectively.

The Quakers continued the
inner-light-driven massacre, sweeping the singles matches to record a
decisive win over the Garnet. Reiss
was defeated 6-0, 6-3 at first singles,
Park 6-1, 6-1 at second singles,
Durand 6-2, 6-1 at third singles, and
Lo 6-3, 6-1 at fourth singles. Adam
Wallwork 'O7 and Sidhu were the
closest of any Swat athletes to salvaging a set, but still both fell at
fifth and sixth singles 6-0, 6-4.
Park attributed the loss to the
strength of the Penn team and the
Garnet's lack of preparation time.
"It's really early in the season, so
we only had a week ofofficial practice," he said. Though the team will
travel as far as the University of
the South and UC Santa Cruz to
play matches this spring, Park said
-the squad is most looking forward
to a home competition against

Williams at the end of March. The
Ephs, a Division 111 all-around
powerhouse, should provide an
exciting test for the squad.
Swarthmore is rebuilding after
losing three key members of last
spring's team to graduation,
including Mike Noreika 'O4 and

Frank Visciano 'O4, who represented the Garnet at the NCAA
Division 111 Championships as a
doubles team last year. But Park
has hope for the young team that
includes only one senior. "A lot of
sophomores are stepping up," he
said. "The team looks good."
The Garnet will play its next

two competitions against Division
I teams as well, going up against
Temple this weekend and St.
Joseph's the following weekend.
After a home meet against
Lafayette, the squad will travel
west for a three-meet trip to
California over spring break.
February 10, 2005

Recently, one of my friends made the argument that NCAA
athletes should really be paid for their services. Before I could
even dignify that comment, my other friend pointed out that
they already are, which really got me thinking (which, honestly,
is something I don't do that often). When it comes down to it,
most Division I athletes do get compensated in one way or
another for their
hard work and superior talent. To start
off, an education
doesn't come cheap
these days. Just
because most D-I

what their scholarships saves them
from paying) to be
small change. In
addition, we can't
forget the shadier dealings that we only glimpse through the oftreported recruiting violation du jour.
Yet, in large part, the American public refuses to acknowledge the fact that any of this shifty business routinely goes on.
We look at each violation as an aberration, an unfortunate event
that can be cured of any long-term implications with a hefty fine
and some probationary period. After last week's district court
ruling in which University of Alabama booster Logan Young
was found guilty of conspiring with a high school coach to send
Parade All-American Albert Means to University of Alabama in
return for $150,000, U.S. attorney Terry Harris justified the
harsh penalties imposed by saying, "It's wrong to buy and sell
18-year-old student-athletes."
Maybe. But, Terry, baby, you're dreaming if you

don't think
it's done all the time.
It doesn't take much digging to discover myriad instances of
athletes being bribed in one way or another. One of the first
examples that comes to mind is Johns Hopkins' lacrosse locker room, outfitted with a 70" satellite TV amid a sea of polished
oak lockers and rich Corinthian leather couches with gold and
platinum trim (okay, maybe I exaggerated a bit, but their locker room is a little cushier than the one our lacrosse team uses).
More prominent examples include Terry Bowden's report,
which claims that, when he took over the head coaching job at
Auburn, it was common practice for assistant coaches to make
"contributions" upwards of $1,500 in hopes of persuading a
recruit to sign.
It seems reasonable for a lot of us pure sports fans to want to
think that money isn't the most influential factor in determining where a prep star plays ball, but feigning ignorance isn't the
way to meet that desire. Just because ESPN doesn't print a
chart indicating the exact dollar value each school offered its
top recruit doesn't mean that money isn't being given to them
through more indirect (which somehow translates as "more
acceptable") channels. Sadly, there are people out there who
want to believe that Maurice Clarett actually earned enough to
afford that luxury SUV on his own. Let's stop kidding ourselves.
There should never be a market for boosters or high school
coaches to get involved in the recruiting process. If we eliminated that, guys like Logan Young would never be tempted by
their excessive school pride. No one should end up facing huge
fines and 15 to 20 years behind bars for liking their college team
a little too much. There's no reason for people to have their lives

ruined so unnecessarily.
We could just set a salary cap at a certain level based on past
team revenue so the best run teams would be free to spend their
profits as they wished. There could even be signing bonuses.
What would be the harm in that? I don't really think setting up
a monitored financial structure would subtract from the academic value that Jim Harrick Jr.'s "What color is a basketball?"
course and the like offer to college athletes. Sure, it might be
hard to admit that college football and basketball are de facto
pro sports, but it'd also give us more control over a corrupted
system that gets more out of hand every year.

Men's soccer hosts charity clinic
BY TARIQ FISCHER
tfischel@swarthmore.edu

A typical Swattie's to-do list:
Feed the hungry, house the homeless, shoe the shoeless, save the
rare and endangered Saharan
bread mold, increase general goodness around the globe, and get to
class on time.

A typical soccer team's to-do
list: Win games.
So no one should have been surprised to see the Swat men's soccer
team combine those two lists last
Saturday in the fieldhouse. Having
already won 12 games this fall, the
team held its third annual soccer

clinic to benefit famine relief in
Africa. Local children aged six to
16 learned soccer skills with the
school's varsity squad. "We did
some skill work, some passing,
some small-sided games and some
scoring exercises," Coach Eric
Wagner said.
The clinic was the brainchild of
Wagner
and former player
Anteneh Tesfaye 'O3. When famine
struck Ethiopia three years ago,
Wagner and Tesfaye, a native
Ethiopian, pulled the clinic together in order to help provide aid to
the relief efforts. Since then, the
team has donated more than $2,600
to help east African nations. "We
shifted gears a little bit [this year]
to help Somalia," Wagner said.

Proceeds from the first two clinics
went to Ethiopia.

The clinic also gives the team a
unique opportunity to interact with
young Garnet fans and maybe even
future stars. "Yeah, there was this
one girl that I was working with
that was just nasty [with the ball],"
Matt Schiller 'O7 said after suffering
defeat in a one-on-one exercise at
the hands of the eight-year-old.
"[The team does] such a great job,"
Wagner said. "They really connect
with the kids." Colton Bangs 'O7
capped off the afternoon with a
goal-scoring bonanza, stepping into
the kids' scrimmage to even up the

teams.

Some players, like astrophysics
major Nathan Shupe 'O5, tried to
connect with the kids on an unusual level. "Shupe is always great at
these clinics because he'll grab a
kid and try to explain density or
velocity to him," Schiller said.
"You can't put a price on stuff like
that."

"I especially like playing goalkeeper when the kids are shooting
on goal," the All-Conference goalie
said. "They get a big kick out of
watching me dive all over the place
and an even bigger kick out of scoring on me."
As Swarthmore buckles down
for spring semester, look for the
soccer team to keep mixing their
to-do lists

with fantastic results.

Philly fans know pain
BY TOMMY BENNETT
tbennetl@swarthmore.edu

I've been a Philadelphia sports fan for
most of my life. It's not easy.
As recently as last year, fans from an
increasing number of cities were adopting
the Fatalistic Sports Complex. Voodoo curses were becoming commonplace excuses
for perennial failure. The pain of Boston
and Chicago became their draw. Everybody
wanted a piece of the pain. It looked as
though the bandwagon was nearing capacity. This October, I secretly hoped there
would be no more room at the Boston inn.
You probably think I'm going to try to
one-up the pain of other cities. You're probably right. Philadelphia sports fans love the
pain. We are, as a group of fans, the people

booed the drafting of Donovan
McNabb. We breed a special kind of superstar. You'd better believe Curt Schilling
earned some of that October ankle blood in
Philly. But every one of us has answered
who

the "Why do you guys always boo your
players?" question at least once. It's not
about self-hatred or general boorishness;
it's about trust. And the truth is, Donovan
McNabb and Andy Reid broke my trust this
weekend. As I sat sequestered in my hall,
away from the New England throng in
Mephistos, I watched the Eagles mismanage the clock and make mistakes completely unbecoming of a team that has more
than enough experience losing in the play-

offs.
Of course, I did what most Philly sports
fans were doing: I booed. Thankfully, we've
got a secret weapon, a mantra and a piece
of chain mail all rolled up into one: "next
year." To be a fan of sports teams from
Philadelphia is to live with this mantra.
You not only have to live "next year," you

22

have to believe in next year. Otherwise,
your brief love affair with Philadelphia
sports will be just that. It's been 25 years
since one of the four major sports teams in

Philadelphia won a championship. The
Eagles have never won a Superbowl
(they've appeared in two). The Phillies
have won only one World Series, four years
before I was born. I was weaned on stories
of the greatest failure in modern sports history: When the 1964 Phillies, with a sixgame lead and 12 games to play, lost the
pennant race by one game to the St. Louis

Cardinals.

As much, as we love the pain of losing,
hope in Philadelphia springs eternal. Last
week, I saw banks, buses, billboards, radio
broadcasts and newspapers inundated with
Eagles love. On Baltimore Pike, I saw five
kids in full face paint and Eagles apparel
waving "GO EAGLES" signs. As much as
we hate losing, we love our teams. As a kid,
I went to Halloween as Darren "Dutch"
Dalton. I cannot tell you how many games
of Tecmo Bowl I won standing on the shoulders (and legs) of "QB Eagles." I actually
liked the Vet. That's some serious love.
Let me tell you a story. Toronto's Joe
Carter won game six, and the World Series
against the Phillies, with a walk-off home
run off Mitch Williams on Oct. 23,1993. The
reason I remember the date (and always
will) is my birthday party was that day. All
my friends were there. I was seven. The
pressure was too intense for me, so I was

watching from across the room peddling
idly on an exercise bike when Carter
ruined my childhood. Every Philly sports
fan has a story like this. A story like this is
what makes you a real Philly sports fan.
Undoubtedly, the Philadelphia Eagles
made a bumper crop of Philly sports fans
Sunday night.

Burrow sets Garnet
pole vault record
BY TORI MARTELLO
vmartelll@swarthmore.edu

While Paul McCartney's "Hey Jude"
was a touching ending to a classy halftime performance at the Super Bowl, the
Garnet track and field teams might have
preferred "A Hard Day's Night," as they
were still recovering from a long
Saturday at Ursine.

"Even though it was a
long day, people really
put out their all."
An Bui 'O5
The teams finished a typically hellish week of classes, tests, papers and the
usual Swarthmore stresses, only to be
rewarded with a 7:30 a.m. wake up on
Saturday to travel to Ursinus. Not your
cup of tea? In their never-ending journey toward perfection, these Garnet athletes dragged themselves out of bed to

compete against conference opponents
Johns Hopkins, Franklin & Marshall,
Gettysburg and Haverford at the
Ursinus Invitational. "Even though it
was a long day, people really put out
their all," An Bui 'O5 said.
Although the officials in charge may
have set a slow pace for the meet—the
team did not return to campus until 7:30
Saturday night—the Garnet harriers

drop some impressive
times. Keefe Keeley 'O6 finished with the
best result as he earned second in the
800 with a time of 1:59.57. "Overall there
were some real strong performances,"
Keeley said. "It shows how everyone's
looking to better themselves as all three
of us running the 800 improved on our
times," he continued. Duncan Gromko
'O7 and Paul Thibodeau 'O6 finished
sixth and eighth, respectively, in the
same race.
The relay teams continued their
improvement as both the 4x400 and the
4xBoo teams finished fifth in their races.
"One of our strengths as a team is our
depth, which allows us to interchange
roles in the relays," Keeley commented.
"Relays are fun because it's where track
is truly a team sport."
The women also showed they are
improving at every meet as Elizabeth
Gardner 'O5 placed fourth in the 400. She
has led the squad by example, changing
from the 800 to the 400, but still continuing to close in on the top times.
In the second meet for the field athletes, they showed promise in every
event. Rebecca Burrow placed eighth in
the pole vault, but her clearance of a
height of B'6" set a new Swat record.
Matt Singleton 'O7 placed seventh in the
long jump with a leap of 5.76.
These Garnet athletes stayed tough
throughout the day's challenges. "That's

sport—that you can measure the time,

Women's basketball wins a nail-biter
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

It was a nail-biting, voice-losing breath-stealer as the
Garnet women's basketball team squeaked by Centennial
Conference rival Muhlenberg 63-61 on Tuesday night at
Tarble Pavilion. In a game that came down to the final second, the Swarthmore defense maintained its intensity
throughout the match and the offense came up with huge
shots when necessary to sweep the Mules for the first time

in school history.

"It was very important that we won
this game; it's crucial to our place in
the playoffs."
Radiance Walters 'O6
Kristen Lee 'O5 led the Garnet with 16 points, including

from three-point-land. Radiance Walters 'O6 and
Jessica Fuhr 'O7 also finished in double figures for
Swarthmore, with 11 and 10 points, respectively. Walters,
displaying the tenacity and strength that Garnet fans have
come to expect from her, also led the team with 11 rebounds.
Debra Farrelly 'O6 contributed six assists in the game.
Swarthmore had momentum early, opening up a quick
10-2 lead on the Mules with help from two quick shots from
Lee. The Garnet basketball machine stalled, however, and
the Mules were able to cut the Swarthmore lead to 12-10,
eventually tying the game at 25 near the end of the first half.
Tight defense by the Garnet kept the Mules away from the
hoop, and three-pointers by Lee and Fuhr gave the Tide a 31going 4-7

25 lead going into the break.
The game remained close throughout the second half,
with the fans' and players' intensity increasing as time
ticked off the clock and the teams traded leads. With six
minutes to go, Swarthmore held a tight 52-51 lead. From
there, Lee hit another of her trademark treys, and Ali Wolff
'O5 banked a shot to give the Garnet a six-point lead.
Despite another bucket by Lee and four points for
Walters, the Mules came back to close the Tide'slead to four,
63-59, before calling a timeout with 1:38 remaining in the
game. Muhlenberg then came out and made a quick lay-up,
pulling within two and raising the decibel meter in the gym
a few levels. After Wolff was fouled and failed to capitalize
on her free throw, the Mules had one more chance to tie the
game or take the lead. Walters fouled the Mules' Valerie
Robuck 'O6, and with the crowd not daring to take a breath,
the Muhlenberg forward missed her first attempt and was
forced to miss her second deliberately, but Swarthmore

THE PHOENIX

came down with the rebound and took the game with it.
"It was a big win," Walters said. "We all came out ready
to play and played well as a team. It was very important
that we won this game; it's crucial to our place in the playoffs."
The win improved the Garnet's record to 13-7, 9-5 in the
Centennial Conference, to allow the team to hold on to its
fourth-place seed in the conference as the playoffs near. The
Mules fell into eighth in the conference at 9-12, 5-9 against
Centennial opponents. The Garnet play tonight at Alvernia
before finishing its regular season with a stretch of four
conference matches that will determine the team's post-season fate.
Walters said that in order to maintain the team's current
success, which includes winning eight of its last nine
games, the Garnet will need to hold its intensity from start
to finish in every match. "We are trying to stay consistent,
going into the game strong and ending the game strong,"
Walters said.
While the Garnet came out with fire early against the
Mules, the team lagged in the later part of the game before
pulling out the close win. "It could have been a better
game," Walters said, "but a win is a win."

before the game.
Andy Reid, a marvel of consistency
and solid game-

planning throughout his tenure as
coach,
Eagles
made several inexcusable coaching errors. Only his
fear of TO catching that 15th touchdown and running
back to the sidelines bearing tights could explain his

"Yes-Huddle" offense with less than six minutes on the
clock. Next year, they won't be Super Bowlrookies anymore, and they won't make rookie mistakes.
Salary Cap Space. The Eagles have only four
starters that are free agents. They also have the highest salary cap space of any team in the league. The
Eagles also have an extra second round draft pick
(from Miami), along with their full stable of picks.
Every year that Reid, Joe Banner and Tom Heckert
have been managing the team, the Eagles have
improved while avoiding crippling salaries. This year
will be no different.
A healthy TO. Terrell Owens has gotten a lot of
press this season and very little of it has portrayed
him as a positive role model. However, his hard work
and dedication to the team over the last six weeks are
astonishing. Because he has a reputation as a bad
teammate, many have twisted the story to make him
appear selfish or foolish for risking his career. Steve
Smith of the Panthers suffered the same injury as
Owens in week one of this season, and he took the rest
of the season off to recuperate. TO did risk further
injury, but with two broken bones and a torn ligament
already, what worse damage could he do? Owens himself, never at a loss for words, said it best: "If it was
Brett Favre doing this, they would have called him a
warrior." I think that Owens is a warrior and that a
healthy TO would have been enough to bring the
Eagles a victory this year. Of course, if Andy Reid hadn't crapped the bed in the biggest moment of his
career, then this column would have been about how
a gimpy TO was still great enough to bring the
Lombardi Trophy to Philly for the first time.
Weaker Opponents. The Patriots will not be in the
Super Bowl next year. I feel very strongly about this.
Bill Belichick is losing both of his coordinators, and
while I understand that he is a genius and is incapable
of making mistakes, there are limits to how much
coaching one man can do. Tom Brady's modeling
career will become more important than football, or
Pro-Bowlers Rodney Harrison and Tedy Bruschi will
quit football because they don't get enough respect, or
Adam Vinatieri will tear tendons in his ankle and be
forced to play the entire playoffs with a bloody sock
and stitches holding his foot onto his leg. On second
thought, maybe that last one wouldn't stop them. But
whatever the reason, next time around, the Eagles
will be the calm veterans and whoever comes out of
the AFC will be the wide-eyed Super Bowl rookies.
The Eagles cut Freddie Mitchell and Todd
Pinkston. Hey, a guy can dream, right?

Garnet men pull out a win over Dickinson
BY MARIA CRISTINA HERRERA
mherrerl@swarthmore.edu

Sometimes too close is just close
enough.
The men's basketball team just
barely squeaked by the Dickinson
Red Devils 67-60 at last Saturday's
Centennial Conference match-up,
giving the Garnet its third win of the

season. Swarthmore held the lead

throughout the entire game, thanks
to a heightened level of intensity
brought about by some unexpected
players after new Swarthmore alltime scoring leader Matt Gustafson
'O5, still recovering from an ankle
injury, was pulled in the second half
after putting up 10 points.
"Matt Gustafson is the leading
scorer in the league. I thought our
guys stepped up to the plate. They
knew they had to play better," Head
Lee
Wimberly
Coach
said.
Swarthmore previously lost to
Dickinson 86-78 in January, but this
gte

time the squad was able to come
through with a win. "Our guys all
year have played very hard. They
were physically and mentally tougher
under pressure at the end of the
game," Wimberly said.

Matt Kurman 'OB was instrumental
in the win, dropping a career-high 18
points to lead the team under the worst
of circumstances. "After a death in the
family last week, Matt Kurman came
back and played his best game ever,"
Wimberly said. Kurman also made all
eight of his free throw attempts, shot 66
percent from the field and had three
steals, all in 22 minutes of playing time.
His shooting accuracy far surpassed
that of any oth]er player on the court.
"It feels good to get a win, especial-

ly a conference win," Kurman said.
But Kurman was not the only one to

step up. Brandon Luzar 'O5, a new
member to the team, came through for
the Garnet to contribute to the team's
win. "Luzar, a senior who hasn't had a
lot of playing time, played really, real-

ly well. That really helped," Wimberly
said. Luzar finished with eight points.
Lan

McCormick 'OB also had an

impressive showing, putting up 12
points and leading the team along
with another first-year, Spencer Gray

'OB, with seven rebounds. McCormick
has given the Garnet hope for the
future by putting up numbers second
m only to Gustafson on the team in
points (10.8 ppg) and rebounds (5.8

rpg). Dillon McGrew 'O7, who also has
had a hot hand lately, continued his
success by contributing 10 points.
"It was our greatest win of the
year, even though we haven't had
many. With Matt Gustafson getting
hurt, we had to give up a big lead. We
had folded in past games, but I think
everyone grinded it out. Matt Kurman
really carried us," McCormick said.

"Our guys all year have
played very hard. They
were physically and
mentally tougher under
pressure at the end of
the game."
Head Coach Lee

Wimberly
Chris Casey 'O7, though only put-

ting up two points, effectively controlled the game by maintaining a

calm and strategic offensive game,
leading the team with seven assists as
well as "good defense on one of the
best players in the league," Wimberly
said, referring to the Red Devils' Brad
Litchfield 'O6.
Though
Dickinson's shooting
game was less than impressive, and
waned in comparison to the Garnet,
the Devils' desperation increased as
the clock ticked toward the end of the
game. The Garnet had a 44-27 lead
with 16 minutes left in the second
half. It soon evaporated as the Devils
increased their intensity, pulling to
within one point of Swarthmore with

three minutes left on the clock.

However, the Garnet's accuracy at the
foul line proved crucial. Free throw
accuracy combined with 13-for-15
shooting in the last three minutes to
seal the win, thanks in large part to
McCormick and McGrew.
The men's team proved last weekend that it can win even without the
highest
scoring
player
in
Swarthmore history, an important
statement to themselves as well as to
other teams in the Centennial
Conference. The Tide hopes to send
another message in the final four
games of the season, beginning with
Saturday's contest at McDaniel.

Swimmers face disciplinary action after violating rules
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

After initially being banned for the
rest of the season, five athletes on the
men's swim team were made eligible to
swim in the Centennial Conference championships after a joint decision by the athletic director, coaching staff and the team
itself. These swimmers, whose names
were not released, violated team rules
after a recent meet and faced disciplinary
~*""

action from coach Sue Davis and Athletic
Director Adam Hertz.
"The athletic department along with
its coaches have certain expectations for

behavior of their student-athletes as representatives of Swarthmore College,"
Davis said. "Coming home from the meet
at Gettysburg on Jan. 29, there was a
breach of these expectations." Davis said
that these expectations were clearly
explained to the team last spring and that,
therefore, she felt that disciplinary action
should be taken against the offenders. The
athletic department feels it is unnecessary to detail the specific infractions at
this point in time.
Davis explained that she brought the
matter to Hertz's attention; from there,
the decision to suspend the athletes for
the rest of the season was made. "It was a
February

mutual decision between the athletic
director and the coaching staff that their
actions would be addressed in a very firm
manner," Davis said.
However, once Hertz finished meeting
with the involved athletes and the coaching staff, a compromise was made by all

parites: The swimmers would be suspended from team practices, meets and all official team functions until today, when they
would be allowed to rejoin the team in
training for the Feb. 18-20 Conference
championships.
The men will be expected to make up
the rest of their suspension by working
for Hertz. "The expectation on the part of

10. 2005

the athletic director is for [the five athletes to perform] a to-be-determined number of service hours within the athletic

department," Davis said.
The suspension of these athletes contributed to a "miserable" loss for the
Garnet last Saturday against second-

ranked Dickinson. Swarthmore fell by a

132-7 L The Garnet was also
short-handed for last night's meet against
Washington, but the team, ranked fourth
in the Conference, is hopeful that the
return of the suspended players will allow
for a strong showing at the Conference
championships, where the team finished
fourth overall last year.
