Service Project To Help
Youth and Environment
By Wendy Kemp

In most classes, playing with dirt is
frowned upon. Pulling weeds is considered a waste of time and physics is more
important than planting. However, the
classes led by theUrban Gardening Group
are different. Their classrooms are not
encased by four walls; rather, they take
place in the great outdoors. The group,
led by Jon Makler '9B, is planting seeds
not only in the soil, but in the minds of
children.
"The group I lead is an urban gardening group that will be working together
withyoungerand olderkids from Chester
on urban gardening in their communities
and specifically at one park," said Coordinator Jon Makler. The Urban Gardening Group presently consists of around
twenty volunteers, and will be working
on Wednesday and Friday afternoons
every week. In addition, they will offer
monthly "work days" on Sunday afternoons for anyone, such as service or
cultural groups, who wants to have a
good time gardening.

Urban gardening is all
about using limited
resources and strong
imaginations to find
little ways to beautify
a small area and help
the environment.
The Urban GardeningGroup's project
incorporates environmental education
into gardening. The group's main focus
is using gardening work to teachchildren
that they live in an environment that can
be, and is, unhealthy. Improving the area
by gardening is one way to help the
environment and show the children that
they can be the ones who make a difference.
Making something from nothing is always hard work, but can be overcome by
teamwork, cooperation, and most of all,
imagination. 'The group is driven by the

creative energy of its members," said
Makler. "Urban gardening is all about
using limited resources and strong imaginations to find little ways to beautify a
small area and help the environment"
A project is in store for interested
students who are staying behind during
fall break, and another one will take place
during Spring break. These two projects,
the Fall and the Spring Break Service
Projects, are linked with an organization
calledThe Norris Square Neighborhood
Project, a community-based organization in North Philadelphia. One of the
projects they help facilitate is a gardening program which is linked with the
City's "Weed & Seed"program.
However, next week's agenda still remains unclear. "To be very honest, I am
not sure how much of the break will be
devoted to gardening efforts," said Sue
Hartel of the Tri-Co Catholic Campus
Ministry. "My hunch is that they will be
doing something in relation to it because
the weather is supposed to be good."
This is not due to a shortage of work,
since there is always something to be
done. A project such as this is not completed in a day, or a month, or even a
decade; it is continuous. "Thereis a lot to
be done but we don't usually find out
exactly whatthework will be until we get
there," Hartel added.
Since the weather will be cold and
snowy during the winter, other activities
have to be scheduled to replace the outdoor ones. During the winter months the
Urban Gardening Group is planning to
work in classrooms, teaching children
about the environment and how they can
help improve it They plan to cover a
variety of topics so that by the end, the
children can each make a presentation to
theirschools about what they learnedand
how they, and everyone around them,
can help their communities through gardening.
The Urban Gardening Groupis always
looking for new volunteers, so anyone
interested is encouraged to join. Jon
Makler sums up the spirit of the Urban
Gardeninggroup as enjoyable. "Hey, the
work is fun and it's a great opportunity
for a group to bond and have a good time
doing it!" he said.

Piven Speaks About Increasing Voter Registration
By Jason Zengerle
The 1996Presidential election is more
than a year away, but the campaigning is
already in full swing. Four monthsbefore
the first Presidential primary in New
Hampshire, Republican candidates have
already saturated the airwaves in that
state with advertisements. President
Clinton's White House is well ahead of
schedule in its transformationfrom a seat
of executive authority to the hub of a reelection drive. Of course, it is hard to
fault the early start to the campaign season given the fact that the 1996 election
is likely to involve, and perhaps be decided by, hundredsof thousandsof previously unregistered voters. The predicted
surge in voterregistration and voter turnout is largely attributable to the recently
enacted Motor Voter Initiative, whose
intellectual architect, Frances Fox Piven,
will deliver the political science
department's annualCharles GilbertLecture on Wednesday, October 25 at 8:15
PM in the LP AC.
Piven, a professor in the graduate program at the City University of New York
and co-founderof the non-partisan organization Human SERVE, has long been
interested in the plight of the underclass.
Muchof her research, writing, and advocacy has been devoted to increasing the
political efficacy ofAmerica's poor.The
Motor Voter Initiative, part of the NationalVoter Registration Act (NVRA) of
1993,is the most recent manifestation of
Piven's work.
The NVRA, passed by Congress and
signed into law by President Clinton in
1993, is only in its first year of implementation, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the Act has already led to
substantial increases in voter registration. The NVRA requires that states establish more accommodating and convenientregistration procedures for federal
elections, such as simultaneous application for voter registration at motor vehicle driver's license bureaus and other
state agencies. Motor Voter advocates
maintain that if the NVRA is implementedfairly andcompletely, it will raise
national voter registration from its current level of 63 percent to 95 percent
The Motor Voter Initiative stems in
large part from a book Piven wrote with
her co-author and husband, Richard A.
Cloward. In Why Americans Don't Vole,
Piven and Cloward attempt to explain

America's small voter turn-out rates.
Discovering that 80 percent of those registered do vote, the authors focus on
America's legions of unregistered voters—most of whom are poor—as the
primary cause for low voter turn-out.
Piven and Cloward trace theformation of
America's personalregistration system
a system unique to the United States
among all democratic nations—and show
therestrictive system's inhibiting effect
on voter turn-out.
—

Professor Richard
Valelly: "Piven has
always been very
clear in and true to her
goal of empowering
poor people."
Armed with the knowledge from her
book, Piven sought to devise a means
that would make voter registration more
convenient by folding it into another activity. Initially, Piven advocated the allowance of voter registration in welfare
offices, but in the ensuing political debate she modified her stance and proposed that voterregistration be linked to

drivers license applications.
Piven and other motor voter supporters engaged in a five-year battle to enact
the NVRA. The Act was viewed by some
as an effort to register new Democratic
voters and, hence, it encountered significant Republican opposition. Even after
its passage, several states—including
California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania—have openly declared their intentions to
block implementation of the NVRA, citing concerns over unfundedfederal mandates and potential voter fraud. NVRA
supporters contend that these states' real
motivation is fear thatthe changing composition of the electorate brought about
by an increase in registered voters might
unseat incumbent politicians.
Richard Valelly, Associate Professor
of Political Science at Swarthmore, believes Piven is unique in complimenting
her scholarship with activism. He points
to her critical role in not only conceiving
the intellectual foundationfor the NVR A,
but also to her efforts in lobbying for its
passage. "What's striking about Frances
Fox Piven," Valelly explains, "is the remarkable consistency ofher thinking on
this issue. Although her methods have
evolved, she has always been very clear
in and true to her goal of empowering
poor people."

people's movements has not always been
geared toward acting within the political
system. In the 19705,when she began her
work in the field, Piven believed that the
underclass should use social disruption
to empower itself and make social policy
more generous. Recognizing that policymakers would cut back on aid when disruption ceased, Piven thought that continuous social action and protest on behalf of poor people would be the only
way to increase their political efficacy.
In the 1980s, however, Piven shifted
her focus from protest to electoral politics and began to think of ways to integrate poor people into the political system. Piven realized thathundreds of thousands of newly registered voters would
be far more disruptive to policy-makers
than protest movements. She thus concluded that actions withinthe framework
of electoral politics wouldprove to be the
most effective means of achieving the
creation of more generous social policies. The Motor Voter Initiative is the
outgrowth of this intellectual shift.

Swarthmore is in good shape, McCabe
needs work, and new software is on the
way, according to the board ofmanagers
in their meeting last Saturday, October
30.
The Board of Managers, the highest
level of decision-making in the College,
meets twice a semester to act as a forum
for entertaining requests from faculty
and administrators. Said Jude Uzonwanne
*9B, student observer to theBoard, "They
chart strategic direction for the futureof
the school."
Right now, Swarthmore's non-profit
taxstatus is theBoard's biggest concern.
The local school district in recent years
has urged Pennsylvania to revoke
Swarthmore's tax-exempt status, which
would force the college to pay several
million in taxes every year. If this were to
happen, Swarthmore's budget would have
to change considerably, possibly wiping
out many Swarthmore programs. As reported in the September 22nd issue of
The Phoenix, the schoolboard' s attorney
announced in a recent meeting that it
would withdraw its tax appeal for 1996.
President Al Bloom had responded to
the school board's attack by joining a
coalition of liberal arts colleges across
the country to publicize why these col-

Uzonwanne said that in addition to
trying to publicize the plight of the colleges, theschools are lobbying state representatives to try to stop this movement. Legal action was discussed if the
situation were to become more acute,
but only as a final option to be implemented in the long-term.
On a more upbeat note. President Al
Bloom gave a report, highlighted by an
article that will appear in the upcoming

ranked several schools in two criteria:

devotion to teaching. Swarthmore was
the only school nationwide to appear in
the top group in both categories. Bloom
went on to discuss the College's priorities for the year: first, completion of
Kohlberg Hall, which will be dedicated
in March, and then new administrative
software and a renovation of McCabe.
The College recently signed a threeyear contract with SDC for new software, which will make the administration more streamlinedand efficient; other
software will be used for classes, and in
the language labs. "There's a big movement by Al Bloom to ensure that every
aspect of life on campus that can be

The Student Housing Committee met
for the second time this semester on
Monday, October 8. A major item on the
agenda was an examinationof the collective accountability part of the dormatory
damage policy in light of a recent incident of damage in Willets.
Early this semester, a window was
broken in Willets when someone threw a
table through it. According to Willets
Resident Assistants and the deans, they
are pretty certain of who was responsible
for the damage, and thatthisperson is not
a Willets resident Unfortunately, when
confronted, the student refused to take
responsibility and the only eyewitness to
the event refuses to testify. Willets residents find this frustrating because as the
damage policy stands, the cost of replacing the window ($518) will be divided
evenly among the Willets residents, and
they will have to pay theirportions by the
end of the semester. Willets RAs asked

Uzonwanne.
The Board also discussed its plans for
McCabe. "It needs to be enlarged, that's
for sure," said Uzonwanne, "and I don't
think there's any possible way in which
the library can be enlarged without building a new wing." As Kohlberg Hall nears
completion, the renovation of McCabe
will take up more of the Board's time,
and will be more publicized within the
school: McCabe's repair should be ahot
topic in the months to come. Not everyone is happy with McCabe taking first
priority after Kohlberg. Student Council
is trying to place discussion of a new
student center before renovation of
McCabe. Said Uzonwanne, "[Student
council] think[s] there is a demand out
there for a student center, so they are
trying to communicate that to the Board
of Managers."
Economically and academically, the
school is in good shape. "The class of '9B
broke a 10-year record in terms of standardized tests, and then the class of '99
broke therecord of theclass of '98," said
Uzonwanne, who described thefirst-year
class as "amazing." Moody's, a bond
company, recently approached Swarthmore with an offer torate our bonds, and
we came away with the positive "AA"

For Your Columnist, Responding to Common
Sense is Kinda Like Shooting Fish in a Barrel
By Chuck Stevens

It is a point ofhonorof sorts for your columnist
that he strives to be honest with his readers. His
columns may not always be entertaining, but,
generally, they reflect his own musings in a reasonably straightforward fashion. Accordingly, he
will be candid about his reaction to thereappearance of thatbeloved institutionCommon Sense, or
rather to the knowledge that it would shortly
appear: he was eagerly anticipating its arrival, and
not because he expected to be stimulated by
thoughtful intellectual banter.The knowledge that
our favorite conservative periodical was coming
was equivalent to at least one nicely prewritten
column, because, let's face it, your columnisthas
come to consider the stuff in Common Sense
cannon fodder, a barrel full of fish to shoot.
Suffice it to say that past issues have featured
articles that supposedly vindicated theReagan era
in 500 words, demonstrated by force of assertion
that the media is a leftist tool, babbled about
taxationbeing theft, and—best of all—complained
at considerable length that conservatives are
marginalized and silenced at Swarthmore. Your
columnist loves irony; your columnist loves Common Sense even more.
As you all know, it did indeed arrive, and your
columnist was not a bit disappointed; there was
many a juicy tidbit in those four pages to produce
either gales of laughter or forceful smacking of the
forehead (or both) on your columnist's part. Welcome as the amusement afforded by the paper
was, however, there was a disquieting message
behind it all, one that should genuinely trouble
students of both the leftand the right: if Common
Sense is any indication, there seems to be no room
for reasoned conservative discourse at Swarthmore, and theoft-heard argument that whatpasses
for Swarthmore debate resembles a lot of screaming becomes nothing other than a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
Let us glance briefly at the ways that the paper
managed to caricature itself by way of example.

There were not one, not two, but three articles that
terminated mysteriously in midsentence, two of
them in midword; admittedly, your columnist
anticipated no particularly penetrating insights,
given what had come before, but it was a bit
unsettling. There was an article on welfare that
more or less failed to take a coherent position,
there was an extended ramble that included such
useful comments as "If women are upset about
being women, then my response is: life's tough,"
and there was an observation that Americorps
should be eliminated because some of its projects
are inefficient. Most troubling, however, was the
editor's "extemporanae", which included doubts
that "the government should be funding disease
research at all," an assertion that illegal immigrants have no rights (as has been pointed out in
_swat.talk, the 14th Amendment applies to all
people), and—major highlight, this—areal thighslapper about the "Sting, Pearl Jam and Neil
Young concert on Parrish Beach," making fun of
Ruach for its objection to the scheduling of the
Dave Matthews concert. Whoo hoo. Classy publication, that Common Sense. Oughta come out
every week.
Among the, uh, arguments the paper made was
Damon Taaffe's assertion that liberal debate resorts to "emotionalrhetoric" and "hyperbolic posters and recruiting slogans." Turns out that "when
Democrats make a proposal, Republicans debate
its merits," but when "Republicans do something
which in some way could effect [sic] the Democrats' constituencies, they go into a knee-jerk
frenzy." Amusing interpretations of the ambiguous reference in the last sentence aside (Republicans going into knee-jerk frenzies?), this notion
made your columnist wonder if Mr. Taaffe had
ever noticed Republican reactions when, oh, a
gun-control bill is reduced. You don't suppose
that NR A support has anything to do with the way
Congress votes, does it? Anypossibility that, just
maybe, Rupert Murdoch pouring money into the
campaign coffersof the committeechairs in question had an effect (note spelling, Mr. Taaffe) on

LBGA, SCLU, Earthlust, and Feminist Majority,
not to mention the entire Democratic party in
general (there was even an apparent swipe at

that feminists are "bitter" and should "Get over

Congress, who "when Democrats make a prodebate its merits based on what the bill

contains" must face not reciprocation in kind, but
"liberal emptyheadedness" and "a knee-jerk
frenzy" when introducing their own bills.
Other gems of non-inflammatory rationalism
included a headline that cleverly referred to the
national service program AmeriCorps as
"AmeriWaste" and an ominous warning of the
"increasing tendency [on college campuses] to
subvert true learning," as evidenced by (gasp) the
existence of Gay and Lesbian Studies classes at
some schools.
With such openminded, reasonable discussion
as this, how could anyone fail to abandon their
ignorant liberal delusions at once? Evidently the
writers of Common Sense follow in the tradition
of the famous Brit-baiting propagandist from

the telecommunications bill? Claiming that special interests are only on the left is just silly.
Mr. Taaffe calls for "constructive" rhetoric
rather than "emotionalpsychobabble." Sure, sure,
we might all benefit from a little detachment now
and again...but Mr. Taaffe's position, after 2000
words of"constructive" arguments like "Feminist
arguments are just that—sentimental thinking,"
the observation that the "SCLU" (SCLS, Mr.
Taaffe) has discovered a constitutional right "to
go free because your trial was biased" for blacks
who murder policemen, and a "reproach to liberal
groups" to "use that which lies between most of
your ears," was less than strong. Claiming that
liberals caricature conservatives and referring a
paragraph later to "liberal empty-headedness"
never makes for an especially persuasive argument. The point behind all of this is that, evidently, conservatives commit the same sins of
polemicizing as that Mr. Taaffe attributes to liberals—but also that the aim of a balanced discourse
is not at all served by articles like Mr. Taaffe's, nor
by publications like Common Sense.
What happens when Common Sense comes
out? Some outrage is voiced, and some amusement, but little real argument; your columnist
notes, in looking back, that his own column has
been devoted largely to mocking thepaper, and he
would venture to say that there are precious few
serious arguments he could substitute for the
mockery—because the paper doesn't advance
serious arguments.
The closest it comes is the article about
AmeriCorps, which essentially cites some statistics and goes home, leaving that old line about lies
and damned lies hanging in the air. It is simply not
a possibility that this publication could provoke a
serious discussion, besides that over therelative
merits of the paper itself, because it bypasses
argument, over and over again, for baldassertion.
This maybe a subtle rejoinder to what the editors
consider baldly liberal statements incorporated
into Swat life, but it sure doesn't say anything
useful.

Commitment to Intramurals is Discouraging
By Damon Taaffe
Last year about this time I was in the typical
"school shopping" mode that allof us experience
to some extent. This is the time when everything
from location to likelihood of getting mugged is
taken into account, and students grasp at anything
they can in order to make a decision and get that
application mailed. When I passed through this
stage, I was considering Haverford and Davidson,
both of which are very comparable to Swarthmore. When I finally made the decision to apply
for Garnet-style early admission, I had chosen
Swarthmore for a few select reasons. One was
academic renown, another the preeminent debate
society, and the third was a sense I had garnered
that students here really cared about the school
and took their commitments, both academic and
social, very seriously..
More recently, I have come to question the last
issue very strongly. Why? The reason would
seem to many to be trivial: intramural sports. I
play both intramural soccer and volleyball—the
former because I lack the time to play varsity, and
the latter because, I, well, suck at volleyball. I
assume that many people in the intramural pro-

gram participate for essentially the same reasons.
After all, intramurals offer the chance to exercise
while doing something one enjoys. What many
people seem not to realize is that regardless of
whether a team is one with scheduled home games
and regional playoffs or just an intramural clutzfest, a commitment is just that: a commitment.
The volleyball team Iplay on and captain in the
organizational sense is the Screaming Turtles. I
found out about the league through Ernie Prudente,
the intramural coordinator, who is a veteran of 27
years at Swarthmore and an all-around great guy.
What is sobering is that this is his last year, and
thus this is his last impression of who Swatties are.
Consider that the Screaming Turtles are now 7-0.
An impressive record, to be sure. Now, consider
that we've only played three games. How is this
possible? More often than not, the other team
doesn't even bother to show up, or when they do,
theybring two or three people and say the rest of
the team had other things to do. It is at this point
that my previous statements about commitment
become important, for when a team plays in a
league, they not only depend on the league to
provide opponents, the leaguerelies on each individual team to uphold its end of the bargain. The

league registration sheet clearly required a minimum of eightplayers on a team and even went as
far as to mandate a 3-3 split of men and women on
the courtat all times. Assuming thateach team did
in fact register eight players, it is truly pathetic
that only two or three can take 45 minutes out of
their day to fulfill their end of a commitment.
Perhaps the intramural league here is viewed
much as clubs are: just sign up for a bunch at the
activities fair, and that way if one decides to
participate once or twice during the year, he has
that option. This is a contemptuous attitude to
have, both because one is not being true to his
word and because other people are depending on
him.
As I indicated earlier, I am but a freshman, and
as such I have no way of knowing if this lack of
commitment is a pathetic tradition or a recent
trend. If it is the former, I'm sad to say I greatly
misjudged what this school stood for. If it is the
latter, I believe it is truly a tragedy that Ernie, a
man who has given a thirdofhis life to brightening
the days of stressed-out Swatties, is running an
intramural league which in his lastyear will show
him that Swatties really don't care what they sign
their name to—they've got other things to do.

Blur Make England Sound Fun
(October 23-November 21)

By Dan Sachar

If any of you have been to England
within the past three years, chances are
you have heard of the bandBlur. Having
been there this past summer, I found
myself in contact with Blur shirts, Blur
paraphenalia. Blur hysteria. The Brits
love Blur. So who are these people
known as Blur and what's all the fuss
about? As their new album. The Great
Escape (Virgin) tears up the charts and
their latest single, "Country House,"
remains entrenched in the number one
position in the U.K., you may find yourself
asking, "What is Blur like? Is Blur a
good group? Why did they name
themselves Blur? What's the fastest
animal on earth? Did the chicken come
before theegg?" Well.l'mhere to provide
you with all the answers, as I have long
been a Blur fan and this latest album
reinforces all that I found great about
Blur.
The GreatEscape showcases the style
and unique sounds that are Blur. You
may have to give yourselves time to adjust to Blur since they sound so British.
As soon as thelead singer, Damon Albam,
starts to wail you know this guy is not
from around here. The music also finds
its roots in traditionalBritish tunes. But
donot let what you donot know intimidate
you., .allow yourself to listen to something
new and in time it will grow on you. This
four-piece band does not sound like a
four-piece band, since the instruments
(guitars, keyboards, drums, bass, strings,
horns, etc.) are all so layered, every song
comes off as majestic and magnanimous.
This is especially true of "Country
Home," a great sing-along tune which
will stay in your mind and have you
whistling during Linguistics (?!?).
While I am emphasizing Blur's unique

style and sound, I do not want to give you
the impression that all theirsongs sound
alike. "The Universal" has a sumptuous
string melody which makes it sound like
a classic waltz, while "Mr. Robinson's
Quango," is almostmamboishand funky.
Yet, keep in mind that they explore
different styles while remaining British.
For instance, "Fade Away" puts a unique
spin onreggae, making it simultaneously
reggaeish and Blurish. And "Globe
Alone" starts out sounding like a carnival
and then breaks into grungy Nirvana stuff.
Weird, but good. The other thing is,
these guys can play. Technically talented, they come up with weird chord
progressions, interesting keyboard
arrangements, and lots of other wacky
stuff.
But The Great Escape does not cap-

Blur in its entirety. To hear this
band's full sound you must go to their
past albums and revel in their diversity.
Parklife is a great album, a terrific collection of sixteen songs, including a cheesy
techno song, "Girls and Boys." Also,
check out the album, Modern Life is
Rubbish, which, if nothing else, has a
great name.
As a final note, I would mention to all
the guitar players out there. The Great
Escape provides the chords for all the
songs so you can learn how to play along
pretty quickly and then impress all your
friends (I've tried it, it works).
In the end, the point is this: Blur is a
great way to eliminate your musical
isolationism and appreciate fine,
entertaining music from across the
Atlantic.

A Headline To Die For Goes Here
By lan Bricke

a brilliant,
To Die For is just that
sexy, disturbing, and deliciously wicked
stab at the klieg-lite underbelly ofAmeri-

can society. The screenplay, by Buck
Henry (who wrote The Graduate many,
many years ago), is loosely based on
yesterday's tabloid sensation, Pamela
Smart, the New Hampshire teacher who
seduced one ofher students into murdering herhusband. On the way to the silver
screen, Pamela
Smart has become
Suzanne
Stone

(Nicole Kidman), a

ing his first big-studio picture, hereins in
his usual arty excesses (the unbearable
pretentiousness of My OwnPrivate Idaho
and the hip incoherence of Even Cowgirls Get the Blues), and subjugates his
technique to the material. The result is an
artistic tour de force. From its bravura
credits sequence to a chilling final closeup on Suzanne's face, To Die For has a
wildly original visual style, using trick
shots, slow-motion, and television footage to comment on and underscore the

ous schemes is a joy to behold. And
Kidman gives this wonderfully evil character an enormous jolt of eroticism and
depraved humor. She is aided and abetted by a first-rate supporting cast, including Andy Gedaya as Larry's mob-connected father and a scene-stealing Illeana
Douglas as Larry's sarcastic ice-skating
sister.
Gus Van Sant's direction is amazing.
Buck Henry's dialogue is delightfully

husband, Larry (Matt Dillon), doesn't

When he does, Suzanne reels in a trio
of star-struck high school losers to do all
ofher dirty work for her. She gives Lydia
(Alison Folland) the first real friendship
that she has ever had. And she gives
Jimmy (Joaquin Phoenix) sex and a vision of a happily-ever-after in sunny
California. All he has to do is pull the
trigger.
This is the setup for a wonderful black

Facts
Fun
By Girldhar Srinivasan

Everybody's psyched about the final
stages of Kohlberg Hall's construction.
Yet there's still a shroud ofmystery about

what thefinished product is going to look
like. Here are some quick tidbits I dug up.
1. Kohlberg Hall will have a
Cappuccino B at, a sort of"Borders without books," as Vice-President Larry
Schall calls it. The Cappuccino bar is
likely to have coffee, tea, and biscotti.
2. The granite block for the sundial
came from a quarry in Northern Minnesota, and has a provision for daylight
savings time.
3. Over 1000pieces of steel, weighing
over 400 tons, and stone weighing 800
tons have gone into the construction of
the building. (Sharpies was constructed
using 4000 tons of stone.)
4. The courtyard garden wall which is
to be in the courtyard will lie along the
walls of the former Parrish Annex.
5. Rainbow Granite,one of the oldest
types of granite known to exist on earth,
is being used in the construction.
6. The floor plan for Kohlberg is strikingly similar to a floor plan that an architect named Benjamin Henry Latrobe designed for a never-constructed military
academy in the 1800's.

7.1 found this information in the book
Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall ofRJR
Nabisco. Jerome Kohlberg Jr., the Swat
alum who gave the college $ 10million to
build what is going to be known as

Kohlberg Hall, is famous for having
established Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts
and Company, whichbecame theworld's
largest leverage buyout firm. Kohlberg's
firm once bought out a company in Oregon. The CEO of the company couldn't
take the fact that the firm he was working
for was being taken over, and committed
suicide by jumping out of a building.
Upon hearing of this, Kohlberg remarked
to a friend, "I just heard that some f* *ker
just jumped out the window!"
8. Almost all the glass which is to be
used in Kohlberg is art glass, a special
type of glass which can be found on
campus in certain sections of the PAC.
The color of this glass appears to change
as the light changes.
9. The floor plan of Kohlberg is said to
be in the fashion of the Ecole des Beaux
Arts, which favored orderly planning.
10. Kohlberg spelled backwards is
"Greblhok."

Menzer Fan Vents
To the Editors:
Please bring back Katie Menzer's
column. She's one of the best things
that ever happened to The Phoenix.
Even my parents, dubious subscribers that they are, always looked forward to reading her articles.

SPORTS
Women's
Soccer
Loses, 2-1
By Pat Donaghy
The women's soccer team, in themidst
of a tough losing streak, traveled to
Dickinson last Saturday with the hopes
of turning the season around. With the
overall team play steadily improving, the
women looked forward to the conference
game against the Red Devils.
For the second game in a row,
Swarthmore opened up the scoring, this
time with a goal by Sarah Jacquette '9B.
The sophomore midfielderhas picked up
the scoring as of late, netting two nice
goals in three games. A teammate commented that"Sarah has a lot of skill, and
has begun to show it in the past couple

games."

The team rallied following the goal
and played excellent soccer, holding the
one goal lead for quite some time. As
their confidence began to build, the team
looked more impressive. The Garnet
controlled the tempo while forcing several bad shots. However, the team has
had trouble holding the lead for the full
90 minutes, and once they fell to a Red
Devil second half assault. After two
goals wwe scored by the Red Devils, the
Garnet fell into a deep hole. The 2-1 lead
was enough to seal the fate ofthe women,
sending the conference record to a disappointing 0-4.
But good athletes know that it is important to learn from a loss. A team must
build from the positives, while working
on the mistakes. Jenn Vander Veer '99
commented, "The team played very well
together. While the loss was disappointing, I think we should be proud of die way
we played." Lauren Jacobi '97 added,
"Dickinson is a good team, and we played
them very tough." If the team continues
to play well as a unit more wins will
come for the women.
Once again, however, the Garnethad
troublefinishing. Coach Chen Goetcheus
has been claiming all year that she has
been looking for someone to step up and
score goals. Indeed, the women fell short
on numerous occasions, which particularly hurts after looking back on a one
goal loss.
The Garnet travelled to Drew Thursday night before playing Goucher and
Bryn Mawr over break.

Tennis Wraps Up Season with Rolex Tournament
By Charity Miller

On Saturday, September 30, the
women's tennis team faced Skidmore,
the #lO Division 111 team in the nation.
Playing #1 for Swat was Becca Kolasky
'96, who struggled against her formidable opponent She played well and
traded stroke for stroke, but was unable
to prevail. Michelle Martinez '97 also
played well, but was defeated by the #2
player. Rani Shankar '9B, Aarti Iyer '99,
Kori Bell '9B, and Wendy Kemp '99
completed the singles lineup respectively.
Kemp came closest to victory, forcing
her opponent to a third set. She lost in a
tie-break, 2-7. The doubles teams also
struggled against the experienced and
talented Skidmore team.
Although S warthmoreclaimed no victories, they gained valuable insight into
what the team needs to work towards in
order to compete at the highest levels.
The weekend of October 6-8, Swat
hosted the culminating event of the fall
season, the Eastern SmallCollege Rolex
Tournament. Four singlesplayers represented Swarthmore: Becca Kolasky '96,
MichelleMartinez '97, Hilary Gehlbach
'96, and Rani Shankar '9B.
All of the women won their opening
matches, advancing to the secondround.
Martinez defeated her Cabrini College
opponent, 6-2,6-2. She then advanced to
face a player from Rutgers Newark, and
despite an intense match, was defeated.
Gehlbach also defeated a Cabrini player
convincingly, 6-0,6-2. She lost her second round match to Mt. Clair State.
Shankar defeated her opponent from
Cabrini 6-4, 6-1 and advanced to face
Washington College. She was defeated
by the #3 seed of the tournament, but
showed her tenacity and played beautifully.
Becca Kolasky '96 once again displayed her tremendous talentby winning
two consecutive matches, advancing to
the quarterfinals of the tournament .Her
first opponent was from Mt Clair State;
Kolasky disposed of her, 6-3, 6-2. She
then faced a Salisbury player whom she

6-1. In
her quarterfinal match, Kolasky faced #1
singles player Mandy Mitchele of Trenton State.
Mitchele is a powerhouse first year
recruit for the New Jersey team. Trenton
State defeated S warthmore last year during the spring season 5-4, and thus traveled to thenational tournamentinstead of
Swat.
Becca lost the first set 3-6 but rallied to

endedher college career as a tennisplayer
with a tough match, displaying her ability and incredible style for a final time to
a Swat audience. Becca commented, "It
was an exciting match to go out on."
Swarthmore was represented in
doublesplay by the teams ofNeena Shenai

teams faced top opponents and were defeated in the first round. Shenai andBell

This past Saturday, the Lady Amazons
paved a war path over the mighty
Dickinson Invitational cross country
course. Over 28 schools participated in
this awesome display of grit and strength,
lured by the opportunity to take a peak at
theRegional Championships course and,
of course, by the chance to see the renowned Garnet Tide up-close and personal.
Despite a quick fear of famine, ahem,
on theride home, the Swat harriers managed to maintain their cool.and bask in
the glory of arace well run.
The occasional hill and flat terrain of
Dickinson High School's grounds provided the perfect setting for fast times
and challenging team competition.
The Swat women placed seventh overall, allowing the rest of the Centennial
Conference to get a small glimpse of the
threat posed by the Amazon pack.
The S chirm in ator, Alison Schirmer
"97, rocked this race, placing 28th overall and first for Swat in a stellar time of
20:07. Alison was closely followed by
fellow Amazons Shoshannah Pearlman
'9B and Becky Riskey '9B, who earned
33rd and 35th place finishes, respectively.
After keeping up a swift tempo for
most of the race, Danielle Wall '9B finished fourth for the Garnet and 42nd
overall. In a burst ofperseverence, the
wondrous Soleil Buchanan '96 crossed
the tape in a time of 20:31, earning 48th
place.

The Dickinson Invitational marks an important point in the
season for the Lady
Amazons: it is the last
low-pressure race.
From here on out, it's
crunch time.

Our hard-working men's cross-coun-

try team placed third this weekend at

Dickinson's Invitational. Tireless Swat
placed third in a field of 31 teams; trailing very closely behind nationally ranked
(21) Gettysburg and Camagie Mellon.
In a race of 251 finishers, our inexhaustible Scott Reents '96 set the pace
coming in fifthoverall. Our other leading
runners were Duncan Kirkpatrick '99,
Kerry Boeye '97, Steve Laubach '96,
Phil Jones '99, John Freeman *96, and
Brenn Jones '96.
CoachTed Dixon comments: "We are
right about where I figured we would be
at this point in the season. If we have as
strong a second half as last year's team
did, our goal of qualifying for nationals
as a team appears very realistic right
now." Freeman '96 agrees: "Our team
was a bit beaten up from hard practices
and typical Swattie sleep deprivation. In
spite of this, our performance really reaffirms that we are well within striking
distance of the #2 birth for nationals."
Laubach '96 says: "I don't think our
finish was that disappointing; it shows
that we haven't peaked as a team yet,
which is good. It gives us the inspiration
to work hard, since we are only a few
points behind some of the teams that are
the mainobstacles to getting to nationals.
If we had won the race it would be difficult to maintain thatkind ofperformance
over the next five weeks, but the race did
show how deep we are as a team. If one
or two of the top nine [runners] have a
bad race, others are ready to step in. This
week, freshman Phil Jones, for example,
ran a fantastic race as the critical fifth
runner on the team."

The GarnetTide and the Muhlenberg
Mules sloshed through the grass and mud
of Clothier Field last Saturday in one of
the uglier displays of college football
that you could ever witness. The game
was ugly, but in the end, Swarthmore
proved their defensive dominance.
A third quarter touchdown and a field
goal were all the points the Garnet Tide
needed as Swarthmore came away victorious, 11-7.
The first half was a virtual clinic for
bad football. Punters Matt Poe '96 and
Muhlenberg's Frank Grippsaw plenty of
action in the first half. Neither team's
offense was able to consistently put anything together. The Garnet Tide defense
turned in another solid first half performance, however.
Although Muhlenberg had two legitimate scoring chances, disaster was
averted both times. Muhlenberg's best
drive was ended when linebacker Jim
Hunt '96 intercepted what appeeared to
be a completed pass deep in GarnetTide
territory. Another Muhlenburg drive finished with a missed field goal.
Unfortunately, the GarnetTide offense
was not able to capitalize on
Muhlenburg's failure, producing a meager 65 yards of total offense in the first
half.
"In the first half, we were blocking the
right people, but we weren't doing it with
the right amount of intensity," said left
tackle Chuck Hudson "96. "We turnedit
up a notch in the second half and we did
what we had to do to get the victory.
Luckily, our defenseplayed its best game
of the year, or else we might not have
been in a situation to win the game."
Still, the score was 0-0 at half time.
After a profanity-laced half time tirade
by tri-captain Nick Milligan '96, the
Garnet Tide hit the field fired up, not
wanting to let Muhlenberg come away
with its first victory in over a year.
The adrenaline quickly wore off as the
GarnetTide offense went three plays and
out.Muhlenberg did the same on its first
drive of the second half.
With the ball on their 21 yard line, the
GarnetTide churned out an 11 play, 79
yard drive, most of which was on the
ground. Pat Straub '97 hit widereceiver
Sam Paschel '96 for an 18 yard touchdown pass to open the scoring.
Hunt added a two point conversion run
to make the score 8-0. A fumble recovery
deepin Muhlenberg territory set the Garnet Tide up for a 29 yard field goal by
Matt Minero '96 to make the score 11-0.
Trailing by eleven points on theroad
and not having won a football game since
early last season, it wouldhave been easy
for Muhlenberg to pack it in, but these
aren't the same Mules that were embarrassed by the Garnet Tide last year.
Muhlenberg responded with a 33 yard
touchdown run by Steve Peters, which
capped an eight play, 70 yard drive.
The restof the fourth quarter resembled
the entirefirst half. As thefield condition
deteriorated, both offenses bogged down,
struggling to gain their footing.
With 2:36 remaining in the game, the
Garnet Tide got the ball back after the
defense once again turned the Mules
away. Pat Straub's 10 yard scramble on a
critical third down and eight situation
was the coup de grace.
This weekend. Swat heads North to
scenic, upstate New York to take on
Hobart College.The Statesmen (1-4) have
struggled this year, but their aggressive
blitzing defense and physical,straightahead offense could cause lots of problems for the GarnetTide.
The Statesmen have won two in a row
in this series, including a 24-6 victory at
Swarthmore last year. In each of the last
two games in this series, special teams
have figured into the final outcome, so
the Garnet Tide special teams certainly
need to have another big game.
On October 21, the Garnet Tide will
try to play the part ofDavid as defending
conference champion Dickinson comes
to town. In 1992, the Garnet Tide was in
almost the exact same situationand came
withininches of defeating Dickinson and
possibly winning the Centennial Conference championship, instead settling for a
26-26 tie.

Team dominates,

By David Lischer

Last weekendthe women's volleyball
team traveled to Boston to play in the
Seven Sisters' Tournament. They finished a disappointing sixth, the same
result as last year, posting two victories
against three defeats. After Wednesday
night's loss to Wilmington theirrecord
stands at 6-10 (1-3).
There has been no rest or recovery
time for the Garnet. Last night they traveled to Moravian for a tri-match with
Moravian and Princeton. Today they host
Albright at 4:30 p.m. Then the team travels toBaltimore on Saturday for aconference tri-match with Johns Hopkins and
Muhlenberg. In total, they will have six
matches this week, after having had five
last weekend, on top of midterms.
At Seven Sisters', the Garnet finished
1-2 in their pool and did not advance to
the top bracket In their first match they
played St. Joseph's (CT), a team that has
vastly improved over last year. Co-captain Nancy Rosenbaum '96 admits that
the Garnet may have overlooked them.
St. Joseph's played very hard and were
able to capitalize on the opportunities the
Garnet offered them, including six
straight "free" sideouts on missed Garnet
serves.
After rallying to defeatMl Holyoke in
two games, the Garnet faced a tougher
team in Vassar. Vassar prevailed in two
games, but the Garnet were able to hang
close most of the way. "We had lapses in
serve receipt, and all day we had trouble
getting kills," said Rosenbaum.
With so many matches occurring in
close quarters, teams were able to scout
one another very closely. As a result, the
lesson of staying in position on defense
was hammered home.
In the consolation bracket the Garnet
faced two familiar teams when they
played Haverford and Bryn Mawr, fellow Centennial Conference members.

With at least a half dozen games remaining to be played, the Garnet must
strive to maintain their high-quality style
of play. "We have won some very important and difficult games already; now we
have to be careful to continue to focus on
each game as they come and not to look

After a strong showing last week, the
Swarthmore men's soccer team looked
to continue their success in a conference
game against Franklin and Marshall.
Unfortunately, things did not go as
planned. The Garnet attacked the Diplomat defense and had several shots on
goal, but were unable to convert.
The Franklin Marshall offense, however, did not have the same problem. The
first F&M goal was scored on a long shot
from midfield in the first 45 minutes.
Despite this setback, the men continued
theirassault. They finished the half with
the score remaining 1-0 F&M.
The second half looked promising as
the Garnetreturned to the field seeking
revenge and the win. They had many
goal-scoring opportunities but were still
unable to come through.
The second F&M goal came about
twenty minutes into the second half on a
bobbled ball in the goal box finished by
the F&M offense. Not soon after, senior
tri-captain Leonard Cuello fractured his
right leg in two places.
"Although we weren't playing up to
our ability before Lenny's injury, the
blow itcaused to the team's mental state
made it hard for us to get back in the
game." added Titian Mink '9B on the
loss. "We never gave up, even though our
captain was injured and we were down

After several setbacks, the Garnetkept
their morale up and continued the game.
As the end neared, the Swat offense
launched a massive attack on the defense
only to be scored on in the last two
minutes of the game by a F&M counterattack.
"The game was disappointing," commented Kyle Bamett '97, "but with five
games left in the season, we are looking
ahead especially for wins against
Hopkins, Gettysburg, and Haverford."
On a lighter note, amidst the chaos of
Homecoming and Parents' Weekend,
Swatalumnireturned to take on the men's
team. However, the current team proved
the rule that youth prevails in the end.
The Garnet won the game 6-2 with
Bamett, Dave Lane '97, and Lenny Cuello
'96 scoring two goals apiece.
The alumni's two goals were scored
by non-alumnus Jeff Reekes, who is actually a student at Davidson College.
Reekes was visiting friends at Swat for
the weekend and decided to help out the
alumni's team.
Although they were outplayed by
Swat's starters, the alumni had a good
showing and look foward to a rematch
next year.

Meanwhile, the men are looking for
support in their next game away against
a strong Gettysburg team on October 14
and for some fellow Garnet support at
their 4:00 home game against Ursinus on
October 18. Both games should prove to
be exciting and competitive matches.

War Mothers Host
Ultimate Tournament

Women Lose Six Games But Gain Experience
By Jennifer Chen
Swarthmore's women's ultimate
frisbee team, the War Mothers, stumped
into this past weekend's sectional tour-

with ambitious goals and the expectation to win at least one game
anyway. They ended the tournament
with zero wins and six losses. There
were four club teams and six college
teams present at the tournament. One
member of the War Mothers who found
time to speak to the Phoenix during this
midterms/papers-filled week, Mandy
Hourihan '9B seemed rather pleased with
theWar Mothers'performance. "We did
well breaking the zones against the other
teams on Saturday," shecommented."We
started using the dump and swing thing,
that we practiced, more in the games. So,
we were able to break well into the opponents' zone and score."
Since the War Mothers wereup against
both club teams (with "grown-ups who
brought their kids to the tournament")
and college teams, they received a real
sense of how they measure up against
various levels of ultimatefrisbee players.
The Philly Peppers, the club team which
was undefeated in the tournament (6-0)
and to which S warthmoreComputer Science Program's very own Lisa Meeden
belongs, was as formidable a foe as anyone could imagine. Mandy Hourihanfelt
that "any game against the Philly Peppers was an automatic loss for the opponent." TheDelaware Round-Up, another
nament

-

club team, finished in secondplace with
four wins and one loss. The Rutgers
ultimate frisbee team was the collegiate
team with the highest placement in the
tournament (fifth over all) and walked
away from the tournament with three
wins and three losses: the wins were
against Perm(7-4),Haverford(l3-4)and
Swarthmore (13-3) and the losses were
against the club teams.
Swarthmore's losses in the tournament included many close games. The
War Mothers lost to the Rutgers' team by
the score of 13-3, Haverford 13-6,
Princeton 10-6, Penn State 15-6, and
Penn 13-10. They were shut out against
the Philly Peppers. Hourihan evaluated
that the matches the War Mothers played
against other college teams were rather
close. "The gameI enjoyed the most was
against Princeton. The points lasted a
long time." However, the most exhilarating game had to be the one against U of
Penn, where theWar Mothers were down
eight points to one but eventually caught
up to thirteen to ten. Hourihan assessed
that "We had momentum and we might
have won had we played to fifteen points."
This past weekend definitely was not
one of the more memorable weekends
that the War Mothers have experienced.
They walked away from the tournament
as a more mature and more cohesive
group ofathletes. The War Mothers have
shown their ability to learn from previous games, and soon we'll be hearing
more about wins.

national power. In his two years there as
an assistant, Gress was very impressed
with the performances of the men's lacrosse team, noticing how tough they
play every game. Upon hearing of an
opening of the headcoach position here,
Gress jumped at the opportunity, and
Swarthmore eagerly welcomed a coach
with his impressive credentials.
A big change for the coach was to
get used to the small number of players
in the fall, as most members play other
sports. The team averaged about nine
players for the twelve practices it held.
An advantage of thesmall team is that the
coach gets to work with each player individually. Additionally, the players get
more repetitions in practice.
Unfortunately, the team was without a goalie for the fall. Last year's
starter, Ben Henwood '97, is pursuing
other activities in France, leaving the
team without a regular goalie. For most
practices, the team had no choice but to
use a wooden table. Actually, according
to captain Ben Seigel '96, "He wasn't all
thatbad. He didn't have much mobility,
but he stopped many shots."
On the plus side, Seigel stated that
the team "spent their time well on the
field. A lot was learned, especially defensively. The main idea of fall ball is
just to go out and play, get the sticks
loose. Mostof thepractice is spent scrimmaging and having fun."
Seigel later added that, "It also gave
practices.

us a chance to get used to the new coach.
He comes with a lot of knowledge of the
game and is very enthusiastic. He has a
good understanding of how to work with
our team. Everyone wants to play for
him."
In the end, however, it will be the
players who determineif they can change
the misfortunes of the past two years,
which has resulted in only six total wins.
As fall ball came to an end, players became more confident that the team will
have a strong season next Spring.

Men's Rugby Record 2-1 In Divisional Play
By Tony Sturm

MEN'S X-COUNTRY: 9/14 at Allentown Inv.

Pat Gress Attempts to Turn Around Program

October 13,1995

Two weeks ago, Swarthmore's men's
rugby team fell to a big, slow, brawling
Kutztown team. Last week, they faced a
team that was on the other end of the
spectrum: faster, smaller, and cleaner.
Swarthmore showed that they enjoyplaying teams of this style a bit more.
The Evil Buzzards defeated the University of Pennsylvania 24-20 lastSaturday on DuPont Field to raise their divisional record to 2-1. Swarthmore fell
behind 12-0 in the first few minutes, but
dominated the second half for the victory, driving Penn all over the field with
their strong forward pack.
What made this victory even more
impressive was the fact that the Buzzards
were playing without either of their starting props, who were out with "previous
commitments." Swarthmorealso started
a loose forward who had learned the
position just two days earlier.
The victory was a much-needed one
for the Buzzards, who kept their playoff
hopes alive. Things did not look good for
the team, however, early in the first half.
Less than five minutes into the game,
Penn ran weak off of a scrum, and their
player shookoff a tackleby a Swarthmore
loose forward to rumble in for the score.
Pennsylvania scored again ten minutes
later when they were able to take advantage of a break down in the Buzzard's
back line.
Chaz Teplin '96 kicked a penalty kick
through the uprights to get Swat on the
board late in the half. Then, early in the
second half, Teplin scored from five
meters out by picking the ball out of a
ruck and diving into the try zone. Teplin's
conversion brought the team within two.
The forward pack was gaining some
steam, and Penn was unable to stop them.
After Penn scored three points on a long
penalty kick, the Buzzards answered.
Two more tries were scored because
of the forward pack, who were rucking
and mauling with great success. Jason
Dougal '96 was one of the beneficieries,

falling on the ball in the try zone after an
impressive maul, and Teplin ran in another on a similar play. Teplin was perfect with his kicks on the day, scoring on
all three of the conversions, and kicking
the penalty.
Swarthmore was up 24-15 when Penn
scored a questionable, but meaningless
last minute try. The conversion was
missed, giving a final score of 24-20.
The entire forward pack played a great
game. Standouts included second row
players BryceWalker '97 and Dan
Schwan '97, who anchored the pack very
well.
Jack Schecter '96 played an exceptional game at wing for the backs, making numerous great runs despite obtaining a gash in his shin on the first tackle
that required six stitches later that day.
Simon Harding '99 made his A-side de-

Swarthmore fell behind 12-0 in the first
few minutes, but
dominated the second
half for the victory,

the field with their

but in the first half, playing wing forward
opposite of Schecter.
Swarthmore's B-side team fell to Perm
17-7. Dan Green '99 scored his first ever
try, and Tony Sturm '99 kicked the conversion to put theBuzzards up 7-0 early,
butPerm was able to use their size advantage to score three tries during the game.
Once again on B-side, Swat was not
seriously outplayed; they just weren't
able to make the big plays.

Georgine Yorgey '9B

Jason Dougal '96
Jason Dougal is playing in his seventh consecutive rugby season and his
40th consecutive game this Saturday. Dougal is known to his teammates and
friends as "Field General" because ofhis position as Forward Captain and his
overall presence on the field. Teammate Chaz Teplin v,96 said, "His play was
exemplified this past weekend as he dominated the opposing Penn wing
forward who was supposed to be a 'select-side' player." Dougal scored the
winning try in this
game against Penn. His great devotion to the
team, athleticicism, and leadership on the field define rugby at Swarthmore.

Georgine Yorgey is a phenomenal player who, in her second year with the
team, is contributing hugely to the Women's Ultimate team's spirit. Over the
weekend, the ultimate team hosted a large tournament on Cunningham fields
in which they played 6 games. She didn't miss a single game and played her
heart out during every match. Captain Lena Loewenthal '97 said, "Georgine
played a tremendous tournament. She was always making open cuts and
getting where she needed to be. She never let us down." Yorgey's levelof play
was so stellar that she earned the prestigious Lay-out Skirt (Team MVP).
