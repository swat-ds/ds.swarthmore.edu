Non-profit exploring possible Ecuadorian school
BY MINH-DUYEN NGUYEN
mnguyen4@swarthmore.edu
With two hundred dollars, you could
just buy another costly textbook. Or you
could, with the help of the Village
Education Project, send a student in
Ecuador to school. Village Education
Project founder Katie Chamblee 'O7 chose
to see the latter potential of this two hun-

dred dollars.
The Village Education Project, four
years after its creation, is now making
plans to build its own school in Otavalo,
Ecuador. This international non-profit provides summer classes in English and math
to prepare children living in villages outside Otavalo, Ecuador, for high school.
Students who do well over the summer
receive a scholarship for high school.
Although the Ecuadorian government provides free primary education to students,
many of the students are unable to afford
the $2OO cost of books, uniforms and transportation. While the organization originally sponsored four Ecuadorian students, it
has grown in past years to sponsor more
than twenty.
A new school is estimated to cost
$lOO,OOO and support 180 students. The
Village Education Project also plans to create a busing system to help students living
far away on the peripheries of Otavalo.
With all these new ideas, the organization
intends to continue its summer school and
scholarship program.

Jake Ban 'lO, director of the
Swarthmore stafffor the Village Education
Project, expressed the need for the school.
By building a new school, the Village
Education Project hopes to make its work
more sustainable. Rather than being just a
scholarship and summer volunteer program, dependent upon the facilities of the
government-run schools, the new school
will provide a base from which the program can work.
"We send these indigenous village students to the public schools where they're
really looked down upon for being indigenous," Ban said. "They're really marginal-

ized in the classrooms. We wanted to build
a school where we would have culturally
relevant curriculum that is more in tune to
their realities." Chamblee added that she
hopes the school will foster a sense of community for both students and parents.
"Schools have historically been a social
space for impoverished communities to
meet where they can have recreational
activities, that they can use as a meeting
place, where they can have some personal
capital," Chamblee said. "I hope the school
will have that effect—a real galvanizing,
mobilizing effect."
This links to Chamblee's original inspiration to start the Village Education
Project. "The students we were supporting
%vere going [to school] in isolation,"
Chamblee said. "They would be the only
ones in their community learning. We
thought that if we sponsored entire villages
all the kids would go to school together as
an entire community. They would have
each other as a support network and education would be part of the culture and
expectation of the people in these communities."
Members of the organization are working with Don Gilberto, a principal at one of
the local schools. Gilberto owns both the
hostel where volunteers both from
Swarthmore and other universities stay
for the summer and the land on which the
school will be built. "He is basically the
lynchpin of the Village Education Project.
He is our Ecuadorian connection," said
Jean Strout 'O9, a volunteer for the Village
Education Project last summer.
Plans for the school still remain in the
early stages. "We aren't sure whenthe construction will start, but we are planning to
keep the Village Education Project around
for a long time. The program is growing
bigger and bigger every year," Strout said.
"[W]e are able to provide more scholarships every year and have more students
in our program."
Chamblee said that there is still some
uncertainty over what issues will arise.
"We will find out what the biggest obstacles are once we refine our plan,"

Amelia Possanza Phoenix Staff

Jean Strout plays a game with her students in between classes in Ecuador.
Chamblee said. She added, though, "The
biggest obstacle is always money. The
biggest challenge is how we are going to
keep funding this school year after year
after year."
Chamblee was first motivated to start
the Village Education Project after she
traveled to Ecuador as a Global Vision
International volunteer in 2005. She was
supported
by
the Phillip
Evans
Scholarship.
While there, she learned from her host
father about the dearth of educational
opportunities available for students living
in indigenous areas. Chamblee described
him as "an incredibly dedicated educator
in Otavalo" who is "very passionate about
indigenous rights issues."
"We began having conversations about
how unfair it was that some of the promising students I was working with would
never have the chance to attend school,"
Chamblee said. "Through him I learned
that it is a very endemic problem that
indigenous students, who tend to be poorer

than their mestizo counterparts, are often
excluded from educational opportunities. I
realized how little financial need is needed
to send these kids to school. It's only two
hundred dollars a year."
With the new school, the Village
Education Project continues to grow.
"It's a big challenge and it's humbling,"
Chamblee said. "It's a lot of hard work. You
might prescribe a great idea but there are
people on the ground doing that work."
The project welcomes all volunteers
who are willing to learn and is offering
other positions as well. "We have to hire a
summer program director," Strout said.
"We are definitely looking for candidates
for that position for this coming summer
and volunteers who want to learn."
Ban and Strout recommend that interested students visit the group's website at
www.villageeducation.org.

dents have a false sense of security regarding underage drinking on campus.
A first citation offense carries a maximum penalty of $3OO
and 90 days imprisonment
along with a 90-day driver's

isn't a misdemeanor and does
not appear on the student's permanent record.
It is possible for the District

if they are approached pre-trial.

Feasible project ideas featured on

the college's usage of cleaner-burning natural gas while decreasing the

Sustainability Committee is currently discussing an idea from the Good

Ringle has also developed a Green
Student Committee to unite leaders
from the various environmental
activism groups on campus and
directly discuss new project ideas as
well as individual group "frustrations and triumphs" in environmental advocacy.
The Student Council also plans to
remain involved by working with
the Sustainability Committee and
Earthlust to promote the fund and
"encourage students to participate in
any way they can," Erskine said.
, Ultimately, it is the Sustainability
Committee who has the final say
over how the money is spent, but
according to Ringle the committee
will not take any actions to which
the student body would be adamant-

"If I [were] still here, I

Although new guidelines

Biology class merges research and conservation

Macy Kozar 10 and Jacob Socolar 'll
may be

tracing the footsteps of Darwin
this winter break. The two are participating in the "Sub-Antarctic Biocultural
Conservation Program," a biology-philosophy program that links students
from Swarthmore, the University of
North Texas and the University of
Magallanes in Chile together for a class
about the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve
in Southern Chile.
After taking the class, the students
will receive funding to perform independent research on a trip there during
winter break.
Set in the UNESCO Cape Horn
Biosphere Reserve in the Southern tip of
Chile, the Sub-Antarctic Biocultural
Program
Conservation
combines
research and conservation with biology
and anthropology. Members of the program aim to ethically research both the
forests and the Yaghan, an indigenous
group living in the region. Also, a portion of their research focuses on preserving both the trees and the native
culture.
The conservation area is one of the
world's richest forests in terms of biodiversity. It is also a place where Darwin
once formed many of his ideas.
"For biological fieldwork, there's no
other place like the neo-tropics. The biodiversity there is higher than any other
place," Socolar said.
"Darwin on his voyage of the Beagle
went to Cape Horn, and in his Origin of
Species, he mentions a lot of the indigenous species and a lot of the plants and
animals there," said Assistant Professor
of Biology Julie Hagelin, the students'
mentor for the class. "His experiences in
the tip of South America were very
influential in formulating his ideas
about evolution by natural selection.
This is a part of his experiences that peo...

pie don't know as much about. Going to
the Galapagos was an important part of

First
funded by
the Omora
Foundation in Chile, the program began
in 2000 with the Omora Ethnobotanical
Park along with the University of
Magallanes.

"The idea of the park is really to
unite conservation, education, the
indigenous community and research in
a way that all enforce each other,"
Socolar said.
The program also received funding
from the United States National Science
Foundation.
The project first came to Swarthmore
when the co-founder of the Omora
Ethnobotanical Park, University of
North Texas philosophy and religion
associate
studies professor
and
researcher at the University of
Magallanes
Ricardo Rozzi, asked
Hagelin if any Swarthmore students
would be interested in participating in
the program.
Hagelin
"I said, 'Yes, of course!'
said.
Swarthmore originally received funding for one student to participate in the
course. After the biology department
offered to provide additional funds
through the Fields Fund, however, the
number increased to two.
"The biology department thought
that student learning would be best
served if a student pair could take the
video conference course together, rather
than just a single student," Hagelin said.
"We offered to provide some added support to help fund two students simultaneously, and they agreed."
Last year, an ad for the course was
put out. Students had to fill out an application stating their previous experiences and goals for the program. Kozar
and Socolar were then chosen for the
"

The actual classroom portion of the
program is done via teleconferencing.
Every Thursday, students will sit in
front of a computer having a teleconference with various lecturers from both
the United States and Chile, who will
give talks on topics such as "subantarctic landscapes" and "field environmental ethics and biocultural conservation"
in both Spanish and English. They will
also be communicating with about 30
students from the University of North
Texas and the University of Magallanes.
After the classroom learning, students will then have the opportunity to
go to Chile during winter break to perform their own independent research as
a part of one of the three existing projects there: "Discovering the hidden biodiversity of sub-Antarctic watersheds,"
"Native and exotic species in temperate,
sub-Antarctic watershed ecosystems"
and "Perspectives on biodiversity, decision-making and biocultural education."
"It's quite possible that our student
participants, on their winter break,
could be on an island in the Beagle
Channel on an expedition looking for a
new species of plants unknown to
Western scientists," Hagelin said.
So far, the class has only met once,
with a lecture from Christopher
Anderson, a professor of University of
North Texas. Yet the students are now
seeing how special this program is.
"We've only had one class, and I can

already see it's so unique. It's the only

type of its kind," Kozar said. "We hooked
up online, and there was a lecturer from
Chile. Each week we have scientific
papers to read, and we have a lecture,
and we can ask questions anytime. Some
of the lectures will be presented in
Spanish. We have quizzes every week,
and we couldn't take it this week
because there was no English version."
Kozar and Socolar both have high
hopes for the class.
"What do I hope to get out of this
class? Whatever it is they have to teach
me," Socolar said. "Really, more than
anything, what I would like to get is a
kind of insider's knowledge of this area
and the experience of talking local
issues with an international perspective
and providing a kind of understanding
of how to approach these problems in an
increasingly effective way. By these
problems, I mean problems of conservation."
The two students also expressed the
wish to work in the area after graduation
and that is exactly what Hagelin
hopes will happen.
"We're hopefully creating a generation of informed scientists that care
about conservation and culture that can
work together in the future," she said.
"The only way we're going to get these
forests conserved and learn from them
is to have people from both hemispheres
working together."

Revival of photo club in planning stages
While Virginia Hottinger 'l2 and
Lamie Nguyen 'l2 both shared a strong
passion for photography as freshmanyear roomates, they were disappointed
when they started looking into photography opportunities at the college.
"Swarthmore only offers one class in
[photography], and it has an art class
as a prerequisite," Nguyen said. "We
heard that there used to be a club, but
it wasn't active anymore."
So Nguyen and Hottinger decided to
start their own and came up with
Photo Shop, a club that couples recreational photography for students with
charity at a community level.
While the club, open to beginning
and experienced photographers, would
have activities such as trips to
Philadelphia, Nguyen said that she and
Hottinger would also like to provide a
creative outlet for handicapped children and teenagers in the community,
possibly at the Children and Adult
Disability and Educational Services,
in
whose
center is located
Swarthmore.
Hottinger added that she and
Nguyen have begun planning charity
fundraisers. "In the spring semester,

6

we are planning on having a photo
show/sale where we use the money
from selling Swat students' photos to
donate to a charity," Hottinger wrote in
an e-mail.
The sale would include T-shirts and
bags screened with the photographs
and all proceeds would benefit charities for the handicapped and disabled,
Nguyen said.
So far, there's been more interest in
the club than Nguyen and Hottinger
expected. "We set up a table at the
Activities Fair, and something like 40
or 50 people signed up," Nguyen said.
Hottinger said in an e-mail that the
group is not officially a "club" because
it's waiting to get a charter, receiving
funding and gaining access to a darkroom.
Hottinger said that while it might
be helpful to have a camera, they hope
to get funding from the college for cameras they can lend. Additionally, students with no previous experience will
be able to learn in training sessions.
Those students who prefer to use digital cameras are also welcome to join
and contribute.

Visiting filmmaker invigorates growing department
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY HANNA KOZLOWSKA

hkozlowl@swarthmore.edu

In a bid to strengthen the
developing Film and Media
Studies program, Denise Iris, a
distinguished filmmaker, has
joined the faculty ranks of the
Film and Media Studies
Department as a visiting assistant professor. She was chosen
from a pool of 150 applicants.
"One of the reasons we hired
a new faculty member is that
we have been observing an
increase in the number of students interested in taking
courses in Film and Media
Studies in recent years," Bob
Rehak, the film and media studies coordinator, said. The program is small, with only four
professors on staff this year,
one of them currently on leave,
and a number of affiliates.
Iris hails from Romania, but
she attended both Brown
University
and
Columbia
University in the United States.
She has also taught at
Columbia. As a filmmaker she
explores commonplace situations and images to find their
hidden meaning. One of her
best known works is the short
"Booyaka,"
which
film
explores life in a Brooklyn

neighborhood.
Her work is
appreciated widely in the artis-

tic world. Her films have been
screened in places such as the
Museum of Modern Art in New
York, and she has received
many grants and awards, such
as the Golden Gate Award at
the
San
Francisco
International Film Festival.
Her website (www.minimentals.com) shows a collection of
her short film forms. '
At Swarthmore, Iris is
teaching
classes
in
Screenwriting and Advanced
Video Production.
The hiring process was a
very long one. Film and Media
Studies Professor Simon Sunka
said that the department put up
ads in some of its field's publications.
After many interviews and
after evaluating the candidates,
the search committee narrowed the number of candidates down to four. The candidates came to campus and gave
presentations, and students
gave their feedback on each.of
them.
Rehak explains that the
committee chose Iris because
they wanted to strengthen the
production end of the curriculum. "She is very dedicated to

film production. We want to
talk to someone who is as passionate about film as we are,"
said Kat Clark 'l2, one of several students in Iris's class who
took a Video Production class
with Bob Rehak last spring.
Both Peter Liebenson 'll
from the Search Committee
and Sunka stress how important it was for the new professor to have narrative filmmak-

ing experience as opposed to
one in the documentary field.
"We had done a lot of documen-

tary. We wanted to expose the
students to something new,"
Simon said. Simon added that
Iris was highly recommended,
and that "her stuff was very
intriguing."
Iris, too, was excited about
her new colleagues. "I am very
much interested in my col-

leagues' areas of scholarship.
That was one of the things that
drew me here. I wish I could be
a student so I could take Bob
Rehak's Conspiracy class," Iris
said.
Her students, in turn, are
excited for the coming semester and how Iris's classes will
unfold. "We're all waiting to see
what she will do next," Clark
said.

Police crack down on underage drinking, cite 31 Bi-Co students
Continued from p. 3
underage drinking following the Thursday afternoon
football game between Villanova and Temple at

Lincoln Financial Field.
La Torre's officers arrived at Lloyd around 10:30
p.m. dressed as college students and interacted with
partygoers for over 30 minutes to assess the situation.
The state police did not inform Haverford Safety and
Security and local police of their arrival, and
Emerson wasn't aware of the College Enforcement

Initiative!

Once they confirmed the presence of underage
drinking, the undercover police revealed their true
identity and intervened.
"The goal was to stop the event at the beginning,"
La Torre said. By the time the raid began, though, virtually all of the alcohol
had been consumed, eyewitnesses said.
Around 11:10 p.m., La
Torre's officers began

rounding up people at
Lloyd 10's, asking stu-

l,™■

Council and Honor Council co-presidents and cochairs. By 11:30 p.m., police officers had detained
about 40 people all students at Haverford or Bryn
Mawr
on Lloyd Green, at which point the police
individually questioned students about alcohol consumption, breathalyzed them and recorded personal
information at three stations set up near the suite
-

entrances.

Honor
Council Co-Chair Gabe
Schwartz 'lO alerted Emerson of the
raid with an 11:14 p.m. phone call.
Emerson and Watter arrived on
Lloyd Green around 11:50 p.m. and consulted with students about their well-

being.

Emerson said the administration and

Safety and Security should educate stu-

dents who couldn't
prove they were at least
21 to sit on the ground.
La Torre said protocol
was to ask students to cooperate, and if they didn't
comply, his officers would give loud commands,
which would be followed by the use of physical force
if cooperation wasn't achieved.
After a belligerent student broke La Torre's glasses, La Torre said his officers became more defensive
and physically prepared in all detaining procedures.
However, he said no students were injured in the
process.
Students ordered to their knees by police officers
witnessed multiple undercover and uniformed male
police officers leading away and restraining an intoxicated, resistant female and several uniformed police
officers forcing a male student to the ground after he
resisted police orders.
Once the uniformed police began shining their
flashlights around Lloyd Green, eyewitnesses saw
upperclassmen hiding underage, intoxicated students
inside Lloyd Hall.
The police didn't search the building, according to
a Friday morning e-mail message from the Students'

choices
rather
than
enforce
state laws.
"Part
of grow-

ing up is to learn how things actually

work in the real world," he said.
He said the administration hasn't
turned a blind eye to underage drinking
on the contrary, he believes the
administration emphasized the importance of state drinking laws and alcohol
awareness during Customs Week. La
Torre said no evidence exists of the
administration turning a blind eye
toward underage drinking.
The administration will hold a forum
on the police raid at 4 p.m. Friday in
Founders Great Hall.
Two dozen students remained
detained at 12:15 a.m. Friday and all students had been released by 1:15 a.m.
No students were charged with supplying alcohol to minors
a misdemeanor and nobody was arrested. La
Torre said the liquor control enforce-

ment will have no further involvement with the Lloyd

case.
La Torre plans to work with Safety and Security to
avoid future underage drinking incidents. "The state
police aren't going to target Haverford," he said.

Car fire kills one at Haverford
BY ROBIN RISKIN
BICONEWS.COM, SEPT. 5, 2009
On Thursday night, the cops came
to Haverford. Less than 12 hours later
in an unrelated incident, somebody
died on campus.
A car caught fire around 11 a.m.
Friday in the south parking lot behind
the Campus Center. A body was found
inside, dead at the time of investigation. The car was parked in an isolated area, therefore; no other people
were hurt and no cars were damaged.
In an e-mail to all students and at a
forum Friday evening, President Dr.
Stephen G. Emerson '74 said that the
person had no connection to the
Haverford community. At the scene of
the incident, he said that the car was
registered to a local resident.
At the forum, Tom King said that
the person had been identified and the
next-of-kin notified. Since the case is
still under investigation, King could
not reveal the person's identity, but
said there is absolutely no suspicion
of foul play.
"We don't know whether it was
intentional," said Students' Council
Co-President Harrison Haas 'lO.

8

Haas and SC Co-President Will
Harrison'lo said that there were news
choppers over the South Lot from
Channel 6, NBC and a CBS affiliate.
The administration promptly notified the community about the fire.
Systems Administrator John Castrege
sent out an e-mail at 11:30 a.m., Safety
and Security left phone messages
around 11:45a.m., and Castrege sent an
e-mail update at 12:40 p.m. saying
there was a fatality.
In a technical error, the class of
2013 was not included in Castrege's
emails or the Safety and Security message.

the start.

afternoon naps and Failßlog breaks. I
was filled with nostalgia for the time,
only a few months earlier, when my
days started at 11 a.m. and my afternoons were filled with macaroni and
cheese and Comedy Central.
This nostalgia was a contributing factor to my newfound, yet deep and abiding, love for the short-lived British sitcom "Spaced." The show was created by
Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, the
geniuses behind "Shaun of the Dead"
and "Hot Fuzz," two of my favorite
movies of all time. Pegg and Jessica

counterpart, Yvonne, in "Shaun of the

subsequently torn apart by a wild hound
trained to attack rich people. (If you
think that this is brilliant, you should
really watch "Spaced." If you don't, go
back to your room and keep watching
"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"
because I have no more use for you.)
The vivisection incident was a partic
ularly memorable one because i
involved all of the show's major
characters. On their quest to
rescue Colin, Daisy's dog, Tim
and Daisy recruit Tim's best
friend, gun nut Mike (Nick j
Frost, a Pegg and Wright stalwart who played Ed in
"Shaun" and Danny in "Fuzz");
Daisy's

of the show's two seasons. Most of the
duo's time is spent drinking, smoking
pot, playing videogames and making
"Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings" references. In other words, it was heaven,
at least to the exhausted commuter I had
become.
This isn't to say that I approve of
Daisy and Tim's lifestyle. On the contrary, I have ambitions beyond getting
wasted and occasionally going out to a
club or a piece of avant-garde theater.
However, I occasionally enjoy indulging
in a fantasy in which I have no responsibilities beyond going to the grocery
store to replenish my supply of cereal
and iced tea. Or, even better, sending my
roommate to replenish supplies.
Of course, this vision of post-adolescent slackerdom has plenty of things
going for it besides the lifestyle. The
writing, like that of "Shaun" and "Fuzz,"
is razor-sharp and filled with brilliant
lunacy, a characteristic that brings the
show closer to the absurdist aesthetic of

First-year still optimistic after one week in bubble
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ANNA SAGASER

asagasel@swarthmore.edu

Just one and a half weeks ago, the
majority of first-year students stepped
onto the Swarthmore campus as
"Swatties" for the first time.
I, like many others, arrived in a car
packed full with suitcases and duffel
bags, while other students flew into the
Philadelphia Airport from all over the
country and the world.
Cicadas buzzed, and younger siblings watched Move-In Day unfold as
teams of Campus Advisors whisked students' belongings to their new dorm
rooms in giant shopping carts.
The campus bookstore made a small
fortune selling the wastepaper baskets
and shower caddies that students had
forgotten to bring and families flocked
to Parrish Beach, the main green, to
have their picture taken atop "the giant
white chair."
Though each of us new Swatties has
come from an entirely unique background and high school, it became clear
around the time of First Collection that
the first-year students had more in com-

mon than being slightly nervous and
not knowing the names of any of the

In addition, my cell phone had a

couple of napkins. Fortunately, I managed to do a small leap to the side and
snatch my phone back from the

'Fame' one play that might not translate to film

swarthmorephoenix.com

-

context is guaranteed a lot of naysayers,

BY ANNE COLEMAN
acolemal@swarthmore.edu

When the new film adaptation of
"Fame" hits theaters on Sept. 25, it is
entirely possible that the critics will run
screaming from the theaters. Though the
production began as a film, it made a pitstop on the stage, rendering this newest
production as vulnerable to critics and
loyal theatergoers as any other stage-toscreen adaptation.
Again and again, the writers of stage
and screen revisit their work to see what
can be done to bring new life to their
work. For some, like Peter Morgan,
author of both the stage and screen versions of the movie "Frost/Nixon", the
adaptation receives equal or possibly
greater praise than the stage version. For
most who have attempted it in recent
years, however, taking their work to the
silver screen has been a fiasco. Reflect for
a moment, if you will, on Ethan Hawke's
portrayal of Hamlet or Renee Zellweger's
Roxie Hart in "Chicago."
The new production of "Fame" is not
off to an auspicious start when it comes to
appeasing the loyal theater crowd. It
appears to be a combination of "High
School Musical" and "Step Up," an idea
that could succeed at the box office but in

independent of the production's history.
"Fame'"s fresh attempt already appears to
have made too many changes to survive

the heat.

Making too few changes is equally
fatal. The fundamental differences
between live performance and film are
great enough that, for the most part, simply lifting the text of a play into a realist
film setting will create an absolutely miserable viewing experience and an insult to
both mediums.
Live theater is driven by dialogue, a
fact that stems just as much from the limitations of stage action as it does from the
ancient Greeks, who placed all of the
action offstage. Film, on the other hand, is
a more visual medium, with a history that
traces back to the almost entirely dialogue-free silent films. In order for an
adaptation to succeed, it must acknowledge the roots ofboth mediums and find a
middle ground in which both are adequately represented.
Tim Burton's "Sweeney Todd" is an
excellent example of a production that
made just enough changes toplease every-

one. His film harnessed the power of the
quick cut as a device for eliciting anxiety
from his audience, simultaneously
embracing the vicious nature of

Sondheim's vision and breaking free from
the limitations of dialogue. The opening
credits of the film set a tone that no stage
performance could capture as the camera
weaves around the gutters of London,
scurrying alongside the rats and vermin
of the city, which so closely resemble the
characters of Sweeney's world.
In other words, the film did what theatrical artifice alone could not do, but it
did so in order to enhance the existing
qualities of the production. Critics could
have no objection to the film on the basis
of faithfulness to the original, but the film
truly succeeded because Burton did not
accept the limitations of the play.
Burton's success, however, was not
without cost, a lesson that "Fame" should
take to heart. An audience experiences
something extraordinary when it gives
itself over to the theater for a few hours.
For a brief moment in time, the theater
audience experiences something that can
never truly be repeated. The audience has
the power to affect the story, to change the
way an actor responds to a moment or
scene and to enhance their own experience. The audience is empowered to
choose what it sees, in a way that film will
never permit. The film director shows the
audience a world through a lens and
manipulates what it sees and can change

the role in which it is cast. While stage
directors may have something they wish
for the audience to see, there is nothing to
keep it from focusing on something entirely different from the intended central
action.
In terms of Burton's "Sweeney Todd,"
translating the play to film meant letting
go of the haunting, uncomfortable sensation that the Michael Cerveris/Patty
LuPone production of "Sweeney Todd"
conjured up every time the audience realized how close it was to an uninvolved
character (a constant occurrence, since
characters rarely went out of sight, even
after they had died).
For "Fame," losing that flexible viewpoint will be a dramatic downside. So
many scenes call for large groups of people that the entire film will either be spent
on panoramic, overwhelming shots with
showy, contrived dance scenes, or will
diverge considerably from the original
successful version of the story.
In order for the newest version of
"Fame" to succeed, it must either adhere
very closely to Burton's model or openly
reject its production history and demand
consideration as a separate and completely new work. If the film follows neither
path, it will undoubtedly suffer the wrath
of theater audiences and critics alike.

In this new weekly feature,

Phoenix contributor Camilla
Ryder 'l3 showcases Swattie
street style.

Name: Charmaine Giles
Class Year: 2010
From: Cheltenham, PA
Current Residence: Wharton

"I got [the jumpsuit] in

Giles said.

While the '7os-style jumpsuits have been seen on runways and on celebrities over

the last few seasons, they are
not a fashion risk many women
have been willing to take. The
loose-fitting top and the MC
Hammer bottoms are not flattering on all body types, making them a difficult trend to follow. By cinching the waist with
a bright green belt, though,
Giles made the jumpsuit look
simultaneously chic and comfortable.
Down to Earth:
Giles describes her personal
style as "a hybrid of everything
that I've experienced" and "a
combination of urban and
S warthmore-earthy."
"I wear what I think is comfortable and usually that's like
jeans and a shirt with my Nike
Docs, but sometimes it's a
dress. It really depends on my
mood," Giles said.
Schooled in Style:
"One of my cousins went to
September 10, 2009

Parsons [School of Design], and
she would always dress me,"
Giles said. "It got to a point
where I was like, 'Okay, now I
can do whatever I want.'" Her
"good
cousin's
influence"
helped her create her own fashion sense. It's evident in her
outfit that Giles has developed
a skill for understanding a balance of color and shape.
Cheap Chic:
"I shop discount and I get a
rush when I find something
really good in a pile of really
bad stuff," Giles said. "I shop a
lot at TJ Maxx, Ross or
Marshalls and I'll pair it with
something more expensive
usually my shoes."
She also enjoys shopping at
flea markets, especially for jewelry. "I get a lot of my jewelry
from different flea markets just
because I live in Philly, and
because it's really easy and
cheap," Giles said.

Style at Swarthmore:
"People generally are earthi-

er and into neutral colors, but,
sometimes they'll wear something random," Giles said, mentioning that most of the international students wear many
interesting clothing
items
unique to where they are from.
In what is probably the best
way to describe a Swattie's
style, Giles said that "what
[Swarthmore students] wear is
a representation of where
they've been and where they
are going."

and

After
twenty-one
agonizing
days
of
gloom and

shadow,
the noted American economist Paul
Krugman finally split open the clouds of
intellectual nothingness and showered
His lionizers in glorious light. In the
New York Times Sunday Magazine,
Krugman writes, "How Did Economists
Get It So Wrong?" in which he discusses
the consequences of economists misconstruing "beauty, clad in impressivelooking mathematics, for
truth."
Following a lengthy discussion about
the distinction between Keynesian and
Glassical economics, Krugman concludes that "economists need to abandon the neat but wrong solution of
assuming that everyone is rational and
markets work perfectly." Underlying
Krugman's argument are two deeply
flawed propositions: 1) the contemporary crisis is evidence of irrational market behavior and 2) societies require
government intervention to mitigate
markets' inherent irrationality and
associated volatility.
Krugman's first presupposition is
actually very popular, but false. The
classic story of irrational behavior and
the economic crisis goes something like
this: Since individuals sometimes act
irrationally and aggregate irrational
behavior has terrible ramifications,
markets require a force a la Richard
Thaler's "libertarian paternalism" to
keep economies in line. Although
Thaler's thesis has merit in selected
cases, politicians and popular media
(mis)construe Thaler's conclusion as a
call for direct market intervention by
Uncle Sam.
This brings us to our second problem.
The nearly always well-meaning,
bleeding heart liberals progressives of
the Ted Kennedy-inspired noblesse
oblige mindset suffer no less from seemingly irrational impulses than do market agents. Regulators and technocrats
don't escape the wrath either. Even if
we could find some miraculously "rational" economist or group of economists
to look for and curtail the development
of systemic risk, it's unlikely this regulatory agency could consistently discern between legitimate periods of
growth and market bubbles.
And despite Yale economist Robert
Shiller's criticisms of Alan Greenspan's
contention that predicting "irrational
exuberance" is impossible, we'd be wise
to remember that even the smartest
economists are fallible. Shiller's colleague, Richard Thaler, wrote in a 1997
Journal of Economics Perspectives
paper that investors' "myopic loss aversion" and cognitive inability to assess
total returns over time stop them from

16

optimally allocating enough of their
portfolio to stocks. Imagine if Thaler

had been a Consumer Financial

encourages Americans to allocate
wealth to their homes, based on the
belief that homeownership is a public

scholar, summarizes the subsidies for
homeownership, which come "in the
form of full deductibility of mortgage
interest, lower borrowing rates derived
from government guarantees for mortgage lenders like Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, and deductibility of local
real-estate taxes."
The supposed benefits of homeownership, however, don't exist. In a 2002
Harvard
Institute of Economic
Research paper, Glaeser and Shapiro
show that the positive externalities
associated with living near homeowners are too small to justify the deduction. In fact, the deduction most benefits

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also got
busy in the early 19905. In 1992, the two
modified their directives to include an
affordable housing priority. In 1997, an
Urban Institute study found that local
lenders served LMI and minority loan
applicants better than did the GSEs.
Eager to impress the Congress, the
GSEs modified their automated underwriting programs to accept low quality
loans they had previously rejected.
According to analysis by AEI fellow
Peter Wallison, GSE leverage ratios
averaged 75:1, flooding the housing market with liquidity. These reduced lending standards and high leverage ratios
made way for loan originators like
Countrywide, which by 2006 financed a
fifth of all mortgages in the United
States.
In 1997, Fannie was offering to buy
mortgages with nearly no money down
(97% loan to value). And ten years later,
Fannie and Freddie were forced to hold
no fewer than 55 percent LMI loans, 25
percent of which had to be for low- and
very low-income borrowers.
As the GSEs increased their demand
for subprime loans, private-label
issuers like Bear Stearns and Lehman
Brothers increased their demand for
subprime mortgages as well, keen to
maintain their market share. The competition for subprime mortgages among
the GSEs and private enterprises
increased the value of subprime mortgages and decreased the risk premium
that had kept subprime originations at
bay. So from 2003 to 2006, conventional
loans declined while subprime loans
increased.
When former White House economist
Gregory Mankiw called for greater regulation of the GSEs in November 2003,
as reported by the Washington Post,
Rep. Barney Frank (D. Mass), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial
Services Committee said that the
"[Bush] administration's position [was]
driven by concerns about the financial
safety and soundness of the companies
'to the exclusion of concern about housing.'" Frank and other Democrats' opposition to more strictly regulating
Fannie and Freddie show how the complex, Wall Street-engineered mortgage
backed securities that were propagated
by low interest rates and faulty derivative risk ratings were actually favored
by much of the political class.
Although Krugman is right to
remind readers about the nuances of
microeconomics, he's wrong to ignore
the distorted market conditions that led
to what he and other writers mistakenly
call
"irrational
behavior."
Economists' "romanticized and sanitized [models] of the economy" didn't
fail; we can assuredly use them to
explain this crisis. So to prevent a
future housing bubble, we should dismantle our distortionary housing policies.

On invincibility
By now, many of the details of Haverford College's
unfortunate weekend are likely familiar to most of
the Tri-Co community. For those still in the dark, a
quick recap: Pennsylvania State Police officers,
dressed as college students, gained entry to
Haverford's "Lloyd Around the World" party last
Thursday night and proceeded to cite 31 Haverford
and Bryn Mawr students for underage drinking. The
officers had found out about the party thanks to an
anonymous tip, as well as the occasion's Facebook
event, which was left open for all to see and contained the phrase 'drink your sorrows away."
Following the raid, Haverford President Dr.
Stephen G. Emerson said, "Part of growing up is to
learn how things actually work in the real world."
Clearly, some Haverford and Bryn Mawr students
got quite the crash course in the way the "real world"
treats underage drinking differs from how the issue
is dealt with on any of the Tri-Co campuses. From
our vantage point here at Swarthmore-College, the
incident is a cautionary tale for us also.
But last weekend; Swarthmore operated with
essentially business as usual. Perhaps even
Haverford's tribulations are too far removed from us
to take seriously. Calling Swarthmore a bubble is
almost beyond cliche at this point; nevertheless, With
regards to these recent developments, there seems to
be the prevailing attitude that not even the State
Police can burst our protective shield. So allow
Karen Tidmarsh, Dean of the Undergraduate College
at Bryn Mawr, to clarify some lingering points.
In an e-mail sent out to Bryn Mawr's undergraduate students, Dean Tidmarsh noted, "Both state and
local police are within their rights to come onto campuses and to enter buildings if they have received
complaints or otherwise have reasonable cause to do
so." More ominously, "The officer in charge of the
raid at Haverford noted that the state police intend to
move from campus to campus in this area to try to
intervene and educate these communities about the
legal consequences they face for offenses such as
underage drinking." Our collective apathy towards
the police raid speaks volumes about the false sense
of invincibility that being who we are at this particespecially at Swarthmore
ular point in time
College
affords us.
We live in an era where professional basketball
players provide live game updates on Twitter at halftime and barely remembered classmates from a
decade ago can learn all about us by reading the info
section on our Facebook profile. And on campus the
information overload is magnified with flyers indiscriminately posted on lampposts and bulletin boards
alike, without regard to who might be reading. The
intention of these sentences is not to induce paranoia; it is to raise the question of just why our natural instinct is to find such worrying unnecessary.
Freely giving away information is simply asking
for unwanted trouble. Recall that the State Police
garnered most of their probable cause for raiding the
party from the Facebook event, left open for the public to read. Such an oversight is just another variation of a situation where an event is made known to
several friends, who freely mention forbidden words
like "alcohol" and "marijuana" to several other
friends, until the boys in blue come knocking at the
door. Suddenly, the notion that, "Well, it could never
happen to us at Swarthmore" becomes irrelevant
when the time comes that it is happening right now.
Prudence, then, is the name of the game, if we
hope to continue enjoying the relatively great freedoms granted us at this college. More importantly,
close reflection on just how carelessly we are wont to
give away information in a time where there are
ever-more mediums in which to do so is imperative
for navigating a brave new world where the cops too
are on Facebook.
Because even if we'd like to think we are, especially on this campus, we are not invincible. And
that seems like a ridiculously obvious statement. But
there is no denying that we not only as students
carry a sense of complacency
but as a generation
in what we choose to reveal to others, knowingly or
unknowingly. Re-evaluating our premises will show
that, even for a Swarthmore student, a little caution
goes a long way.

a.m. pretty much every day. I spring out of

Squarepants.
But today I'm not ready and rearin' to

crunch on my breakfast of potato sticks
and Doritos, my resemblance is closer to
that of Patrick Star. I wish I could say that
this break in character was simply an
aberration, that it's just the first week of
school and that I wanted to go out and
have a little fun, catch up with my friends
and relax, but my Sunday sloth has
become more routine than I'd like it to be.

at least a buzz but it seems like athletes
have more reasons than most.
Whether it's team bonding, celebrating
a victory, trying to forget a defeat or just
letting off steam from the chaotic schedule
-

that being
a student-athlete at
Swarthmore demands, on the surface, an
athlete's decision to drink looks justified.
But I want to propose a new outlook.
I'm not here to lecture on the dangers
of drinking and the social pressures of a
college lifestyle. This isn't a high school
health class, and for the most part, everyone here is a responsible adult who is
completely capable of handling him or
herself. We're all very smart people, but
we're also human beings, and unfortunately, human nature is not on the side of
being a serious athlete.
Let's take a look at some of the awful
things that have happened to athletes
recently: we've had Plaxico Burress shoot
himself in the leg, Michael Vick get
caught financing a dog fighting ring,
Donte Stallworth kill someone while driving drunk and Michael Beasley get caught
with marijuana and sent to rehab. There
are countless other examples of athletes
doing equally puzzling things that cause
them to miss games and lose millions of
dollars. Every year, another athlete is
throwing away his or her career due to
bad choices and simply forgetting how
valuable and fleeting athletic talents are.
If it's easy for someone like Vick, who
had close to $5O million in endorsements
and contracts and a legitimate shot at the
Hall of Fame, to forget how much is at
stake, then it's natural for your average
Division IQ athlete to do the very same
thing. For most of us, however, it's a slower demise that creeps in through poor
habits and a drift into the party style of an
average college kid.
All we need is a little awareness. •
It's always easier to fit in than to stand
out, so the first thing that we, as athletes,
need to be aware of is that maintaining

the lifestyle of a committed athlete is not
easy. The amount of time athletes put into
their sports is ridiculous, and the stresses
of a season can be debilitating. I believe
that there's no combination of time, effort
and emotion that even comes close to that
involved in playing a college sport. It's a
challenge to be different.
So keep in mind while reading the rest
of this article (while maybe even putting
some of my ideas into practice) that it's
just not easy plain and simple.
Think of the odds of going from
Division in athletics to playing professionally. I don't have an exact figure, but
they hover somewhere around impossible. That means that as I write this, I only
have three more years of competitive basketball left in my life, and many of you
have less time than that. College is the
time ofyour lives in many ways athletic
competition being one of them and time
flies. There's a very short window for us
to achieve our dreams athletically
because unlike most of our aspirations,
athletic ones have an expiration date.
That being said, given how valuable
and ephemeral our time to be an athlete
is, I think it deserves a little more respect.
I use something called a commitment
statement to make sure I'm respecting my
time and maximizing my athletic career.
It's simply a paragraph describing the person and player that I want to be.
"I am committed to making my time at
Swarthmore College the best I can possibly make it. I will show up to practices,
classes and workouts with the attitude of
constant improvement. I plan to leave
with clarity as to who I am as a person, a
player and a leader, which will enable me
to freely and fully throw myself into basketball and into life!"
-

-

-

Next, I put it somewhere I can see it
I'm reading my commitment
statement constantly to make sure that
every day pushes me closer to my aspirations as a player and a person. I need the
constant reminder because it is human
nature to forget about aspirations and to
just do what's easy. The challenge is to be
more noble-minded than your feelings
and urges.
The next step is to constantly be asking
yourself the question, "AmI living according to my aspirations?" because having
ambitious dreams isn't really all that special. There are a lot of people who aspire
to big dreams. Practicing and living
according to that dream on a daily basis is
what's really special.
Life is a game of habits, and this technique will help improve your habits and
keep you focused. Why do you think I
wrote this column? Now the whole school
knows my commitment statement.
I'm naked now, but more importantly,
I'm accountable.
Over a thousand people know what I'm
committed to and can call me out if I stray
(which I undoubtedly will, because it's
only human nature), which brings me to
the final step of this process of habitual
development: share. Share, share, share!
The more people who know what you're
committed to, the better. Think of snaring
your commitment statement as hiring a
referee. Empower someone you know to
make sure you live according to your aspirations and change your habits. Life is a
game of habits, so make your habits good
ones. Good luck and have fun enjoying the
fruits of your commitments. I'm sure they
taste better than beer.

title since 1954. It was destined to be. As I harmlessly channel-surfed one lazy
afternoon, a flash of
orange and black caught
my eye. And there they
were: the San Francisco
Giants. And so it began.
Growing up a San
Francisco Bay Area sports
fan, I have suffered
through too many heartbreaking

almosts to commit myself
to a team so soon after a

I started the summer

No more, at least, until

again in three months.
But while it was too soon
to look for another longterm relationship, I was
willing to entertain something non-committal.
And in fact, it started
out perfectly. They were
always there when I needed to unwind, but If a few
days passed and I hadn't
seen a game, the world did
not come to an end.
Yet my carefree summer fling was about to turn
into a full-fledged romance.
It happened one afternoon
during the Battle of the
Bay, a series pitting two
Bay Area baseball teams
against
each
other.
Looking to sweep the
three-game series for the
first time in years, the
Giants sent local-boy and
starting outfielder hopeful
Nate Schierholtz to the
plate with two outs in the
third. I didn't see what was
coming until it hit me.
Neither, for that matter,
did the Oakland Athletics;
Schierholtz hit an insidethe-park home run to put

the Giants ahead. I don't
know if it was because he
was a local trying to work
his way into a permanent
spot in the big leagues or
because it meant beating
the cross-town rivals, but
that play had me falling
head-over-heels, and I
knew that my short stint
as a non-committed sports
fan was over.
The next weeks were a
whirl of new love. It was
that stage in a new relationship where you just
cannot stand to be apart.
And when there is just no
way to avoid separation,
you spend all your time
longing for your better
half.
Thus, while my summer school organic professor lectured on the directing effects of activators in
reactions with aromatic
rings, I pondered the surprising depth of the
Giants' bullpen. And just
as Audrey Hepburn in

young love.
Yet the wonder of it all
cannot last forever, and
reality soon spoiled my
perfect summer romance.
After a longer-than-usual
break due to the All-Star
Game, the Giants and I
experienced an awkward
few games where my
unconditional love was
just not turning into runs
as it once had. My friends
began to tire of hearing
play-by-play recaps of the
games from the night
before.
Also, as it turns out,
spending all your lectures
daydreaming about what
type of player you would
get if Pablo Sandoval and
Matt Cain could somehow
produce progeny is not
good for learning. If anyone was wondering, the IR

Tim Lincecum's ERA for

to put that as an answer on
a midterm would be incorrect. Unfortunately.

Yet the call of the ball-

There is something
about the unpredictability
of sports that has even a
calloused fan like myself
thinking that maybe this
season will be different.
Maybe they won't undergo
a Bay Area meltdown and
instead win the National
Wild Card race. Maybe the
starting pitching staff can
keep it together through
the second half. Just
maybe it might be worth
sticking around, at least
for a little while longer.
Because in sports, you

Field hockey recharges, looks to return to form
BY TIMOTHY BERNSTEIN

tbernstl@swarthmore.edu

Coming off a season in which their
final record of 5-13 was greatly aided by
the fact that they had only two players to
use as substitutes, members of the
Swarthmore field hockey team could be
excused for writing off 2008 to bad luck.
Head coach Lauren Fuchs, however,
isn't interested in doing that.
"Yeah, we only had two [subs], but
that's not an excuse," Fuchs said of last
year's Garnet team, her first. When
asked what, then, was the team's biggest
obstacle, she instead said that "last year,
most of the upperclassmen we had [on
the team] were still in that 'learning'
stage [and] trying to put everything
together, and because of that, they were
thinking too much out there instead of
just playing the game."
And this year?
"This year, [the upperclassmen] are
more experienced [and] not thinking too
much, so that'll help us. The freshmen on
the team they're still in that learning
stage, but the experience gained [by the
upperclassmen] last year will go a long
way to making us a better team," she
said.
Her players share her optimism. Cocaptain Joslyn Young 'lO admitted that
while the lack of available bench players
last year contributed to the team's struggles, this year's Garnet squad will
improve by other means.
"We got tired last year [and] lost
focus, and that hurt us throughout the
season" Young said after Saturday's
game against Widener. "This year, we
have to stay motivated, stay into it and
maintain our focus the whole season.
Most of all, we need to learn to trust each
other more as a team. We also have a
very strong group offreshmen this year,
and that should help us also."
The team also feels that newfound stability at the coaching level will prove

SPORTS IN BRIEF

Women's soccer cracks NCAA poll
Swarthmore ranked 23 in first
in-season poll
On the strength of a season-opening win and a tournament victory,
women's soccer (4-0-0) has cracked
the national top-25.
The weekly poll administered by
the National Soccer
Coaches
Association of America landed the
Garnet in the 23rd slot among all
Division 111 women's soccer programs.

Swarthmore blanked Albright in
the final of the Swarthmore Kick
Classic on Sunday by a score of 2-0.
The Garnet reached the final on the
strength of a 6-1 victory against
Baptist Bible on Saturday.
Laura Bolger 'll, Emily Coleman
'l2, Maggie DeLorme 'lO and Taylor
Rhodes 'lO were named to the AllTournament Team for the Garnet.
Swarthmore is the second
Centennial Conference team listed in
this installment of the top-25.
Defending conference champion
Johns Hopkins sits in the fourth
spot.

Volleyball rebounds to top Moravian

at Greyhound Premiere

Only four days after dropping a 3-1
decision against local rival Moravian
College, the Garnet volleyball squad
turned the tables on the Greyhounds
in the championship bracket of the
Greyhound Premiere Invitational,
again winning by a score of 3-L
The hosts edged Swarthmore in
the first game of the match by a score
of 26-24. The allure of revenge was too
much for Moravian to withstand,
however, as the Garnet surged to take
the next three games (25-21, 25-15, 2518) to seal the best-of-five victory.
Swarthmore took second place in
the nine-team field with the win. The
host Greyhounds, Swarthmore and
Centennial Conferencerival Franklin
Marshall each emerged victorious
from their respective pools to gain
berths in the championship bracket.
The Garnet dropped a 3-0 decision
to the Diplomats, who won the tour-

championships, lately their success has

slowed. Last year was the Garnet's third

losing season out of the past four (a 9-8
finish in 2006 being the only exception).
The onus now falls on Fuchs to reverse

the team's fortunes.
To add to the challenge, the 2009 team
entered the season minus five departing
seniors from last year's squad. Over the
off-season, the Garnet worked on developing a new offensive attack, but will
have to do so minus these five players,
including their leading scorer. Veterans
Young and Sophia Ferguson 'lO, who
were the second and third most prolific
goal-scorers, respectively, on last year's
team, will return to lead the attack, but
the reality is clear. This team, more so
than teams past, will require as many
key contributions from its young components as it will from its returners.
So far, the results have offered promise. The Garnet opened the 2009 season
on Sept. 3 by beating Richard Stockton
by a score of 5-2. Four players Krista
Scheirer 'll Devon Novotnak 'll, Hoa
Pham 'lO and Ferguson have combined
for five goals, taking advantage of three
corner opportunities.
Against Widener on Saturday, however, the offense managed only four shots
on goal in a 4-1 loss that marked the
beginning of the "320 Challenge"
between the two schools.
"We didn't play our game today,"
Fuchs said following the Widener'contest. "We played a very crowded hockey
game not our game."
The lone Swarthmore goal was scored
by newcomer Catie Meador 'l3. It was
the first of her college career and the
first Swarthmore goal scored by a firstyear this season. The Garnet will need
many more moments like the one
Meador provided on Saturday in order to
succeed.
The first Centennial Conference game
of the season, will be played today at
Bryn Mawr at 4:30 p.m. In the past four
years, the Tri-Co rivals have played four
times, and not only has Swarthmore
swept all four games but has yet to allow
Bryn Mawr to score a goal (composite
scoring: Swarthmore 22, Bryn Mawr 0).
If any match on the schedule should
allow the Garnet to play "their game,"
this should figure to be it.

Brothers boost men's soccer in Alumni Classic
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
It took a red card, a rebound
off a saved penalty kick and a

flurry of goals in the final twenty minutes, but when the dust
finally settled in the final of the
12th Annual Garnet Alumni
Sunday,
Classic

on
Swarthmore emerged victorious
by a score of 4-1 over the
Catholic University of America.
The score does not do justice
to
the hard-fought battle
between the two teams.
Both teams were held scoreless through the first half of
play, and just minutes into the
second half, a header beat
goalie

After a flood of Swarthmore
scoring chances, Catholic goalie
Quinn Daly tripped the Garnet's
'll as he
Morgan Langley
charged on a breakaway into the
goal box. With Daly ejected,
Dylan Langley 'lO buried a
rebound off of the saved penalty
kick and the Garnet never
looked back. "Dylan's presence
of mind and conversion of that
opportunity really made a big
difference for us," head coach
Eric Wagner said.
The brothers Langley would
each add another goal (they now
each have three on the young
season), and newcomer Kieran
Reichert 'l3 added his first collegiate goal in the final minute.
"Reichert comes out, and in his
first couple sessions of preseason, really plays like an experienced, comfortable, mature
player

and

immediately com-

mands the respect of everyone

around him,"

Wagner said.
Meanwhile, Morgan Langley
cherishes the opportunity to

continue playing soccer with his
brother. "It is a lot of fun playing with my brother, especially
at the college level. There are so
many ways in which soccer can
be played, depending on what
region of the country you came
from. Having somebody on the
team who played in the same
region and same club as me
makes things easier. Even better, it's my brother."
The two Langleys, defender
Gage Newman 'll and midfielder Roberto Contreras IV 'l2 were
named to the All-Tournament
Team. Catholic finished second
in the Classic, followed by

Widener.

Defender Gage Newman (3) heads a Roberto Contreras corner kick into the net in a 3-0 victory against Wesley College on Saturday to open
the 2009 Garnet Alumni Classic.
Swarthmore has the talent and
the depth to contend again on
the national level. The Garnet
finished the 2008 season with a
record of 17-3-2 and a national
ranking of 13.
The men's soccer team lists
only two seniors on the roster
while boasting seven first-years,
many of whom have already
made substantial contributions
on the pitch.
John Pontillo 'l3 started both
tournament games at center-

back, Reichert found the back of
the net, and Thomas Drew 'l3
saw significant playing time,
playing brilliantly in the midfield and on the back line.
Even as a new addition to the
Garnet squad, Drew senses the
drive and desire of the team. "I
haven't heard much talk from
the seniors about the NCAA
tournament last year. The focus

seems to be on this season and
not on previous success."
The Garnet graduated eight
seniors from the squad last season, but Morgan Langley

believes that the Garnet can
overcome this loss. "The guys
now have the potential and ability to fill the holes we lost,"
Langley said, adding that, "the
soccer being played now is a
more advanced form of the
game. In other words, the ball

possession is much smoother
and flows between players much
easier."
Swarthmore has shown the
ability to find the back of the net

and to spread the ball around
early in this campaign. Eight
players have combined to score
the twelve Swarthmore goals
through the first three games of
the season.
Coach Wagner is equally
excited for this year's season.

who took over the
soccer program in
2002, has led the men's soccer
team to a record of 77-50-14 as
head coach and was named the
