Possible PA
shortage worries
coordinators
Several parties this semester
have gone without PA checks
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu
Party Associate (PA) coordinators worry that atten-

dance at tonight's training session may be too low to train
enough PAs to cover every party this semester, despite the
incentive of a top-pay-scale job.
"As of right now, there is a shortage of PAs," said Sasha
Ortiz 'O3, one of the program's student coordinators. "A
vast majority ofPAs were upperclassmen who have graduated since I became involved in the program." Coordinator
of Student Activities Jenny Yim agreed. "We have a few
good returning PAs," she said. "But a lot of the regulars
have graduated."

Board of Managers Chair Larry Shane '56 welcomed
the crowd to what he called a "regional campaign kick-off
that allows us to connect with many more alums."

Ortiz said she doesn't think party permits will be
denied if there are not enough PAs to go around. "After
all," she said, "it isn't the hosts' fault." Still, coordinators
and students alike are worried about the ramifications if
the PA program cannot serve all parties.
Ortiz noted that "we have yet to hold orientation, so the
actual amount of interest that students have in [the PA]
position isn't known." The orientation will be held this
evening in Kirby Lecture Hall.
So far this semester, parties have been run without PAs.
Yim said she has tried her best to make sure the absence
of PAs did not make parties held in the past few weeks
unsafe. "Each time I signed off on a party permit," she
said, "I made very clear to the hosts their responsibilities
... especially for manning the door. [Also] we've been informally trying to get people who PAed to PA for some of the
bigger events like the DU and Olde Club parties."
Ortiz said that orientation for the PA program is usually held during the second week of the semester, not the
fourth. According to Yim, however, a several-week period
before the start-up of the program is normal. More disconcerting, she added, is the possibility that there may be a
dearth of PAs even after tonight's training session, at 7
p.m. in Kirby Lecture Hall.
In addition to the loss of upper classman PAs, the

The Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts hosted the kickoff of the Meaning of Swarthmore fundraising campaign
in the Philadelphia area. About 300 alumni and their family were in attendance.

Meaning campaign kicks off in Philly
BY GREG NELSON

gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
Drawn by the promise of an open bar, free horsdevoirs, student performances and a speech by Al Bloom,
more than 300 Swarthmore alumni gathered in
Philadelphia's Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts
for the kick-off of the "Meaning of Swarthmore" fundraising campaign.

John Malcolm,
the head of Swarthmore's
Development Office, refused to divulge the event's cost.
"I wouldn't want alumni to make comparisons between
regions," he said. "I would rather look at the complete
strategy. I don't want to talk in specific terms."
According to President Al Bloom, the "Meaning" campaign has already raised $ll3 million of its $230 million
goal. But exactly how much revenue was accumulated at
Saturday evening's event remains to be seen.

"We won't know for ten or twenty years," Bloom said
early this week. "You start cultivating some people with
an event like that and they become closer and closer to
the college and we might receive very major gifts from
them ten or twenty years down the line. There are people
who have been giving all along and you make them feel

even more reinforced and more excited and they keep
giving. For other people, they send a check right away."
An hourlong reception afforded several generations of
Swarthmore graduates the opportunity to reminisce over
champagne before the group adjourned to the Perleman
Theater for a series of speeches and student performanc-

es.

Five board members failed to contribute to college last year
Five members of the Board of Managers failed to
contribute any money to last year's annual fund, a fact
revealed at this weekend's board meeting and
described by one board member as "a very powerful
message" to both the college and alumni community.
But Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice presided for college
and community relations, insisted the failure was a
"non-important, non-philosophical issue."
Eldridge, as well as other administrators interviewed for this article, refused to identify the five members who did not contribute. Eldridge was also the only
administrator who would comment; others, including
Board chair Larry Shane '56, Dean of the College Bob
Gross '62 and Director of Development John Malcolm,
directed all questions to Eldridge.
The five members' failure to contribute came out during the report from the Development Committee, a group
that reports to the board on fund raising progress and is
headed by board member Fred Kyle '54.
Immediately after reporting the failure, Kyle called it
"a very powerful message."
Forty-two members in total sit on the Board, includ-

ing eight members emeritus.
While emphasizing that the failure to contribute had
nothing to do with philosophical issues, Eldridge also
pointed out that other board members contributed any-

where from 25-50 percent of the fund's total last year,
a figure he said reflected that "Everyone on this board
thinks its important for themselves to get involved, and
they want to do it." That example, he added, set a
strong tone for the fund's drive overall, to which a little
more than 50 percent of alumni had contributed.
He agreed that a seat on the board brings it with an
expectation to support the college in all its endeavors
financial and otherwise.
"I think people come onto boards [in general] understanding that and expecting that," he said. "They're
already making a statement [of support] when they
accept the invitation to be on the board."
But he also believes all current board members
embrace whatever obligations their seat brings with it,
something he said was best exemplified when "One
person wrote me a check right after the meeting and
said, 'l'm not going to miss this year.'"

September 26, 2002

"Nobody on the board," he added, "thinks we have a
serious problem about participation and about giving."
A contribution to the annual fund could be as little
as $lO, Eldridge said. Sometimes the symbolism of the
act is more important than the amount of the gift.
"Obviously people have different capacities and you
don't have the same monetary expectations of people."
Eldridge himself said he was glad to contribute to
the fund, as a way of repaying the financial support
Swarthmore gave him during his college years.
Other famous Swat alums have felt the same
James Michener '29 made his first contribution of $2 million to the college, Eldridge said, as "a way of repaying
the scholarship that allowed him to get here."
The ever-rising price of a Swarthmore education,
and the corresponding rise in financial aid awards, has
seen more alums giving as a way of repaying what they
feel is a debt to Swarthmore.
"Sometimes people are motivated by looking back,
and looking it as a way of giving back," Eldridge said.

War with Iraq: The debate comes to campus

Faculty panel offers mixed views on Iraq invasion
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
kduongll@swarthmore.edu
Four faculty members offered varying opinions on
as more than 100 people
crowded into the Scheuer Room to hear a Why War? sponsored faculty panel addressing the issue.
Political science professor Jeffrey Murer began the talk
by presenting a history of Iraq and describing its past relations with its neighbors as well as the United States. Murer
focused on the creation of independent states in the Middle
East, the interactions of the Iraqis and the Kurds during
the past 50 years, Saddam Hussein's political contributions

to the region, the eight-year Iran/Iraq war and the U.S.
involvement in the region since the late 1980s.
Murer then went on to assert his disapproval of the
United States' current unilateral diplomatic policy of
using military force to reduce the Saudi arsenal. He compared this to the U.N.-supported use of weapons inspectors
in the 1990s to destroy biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons. "It's really important to see how effective the
inspectors were at thwarting these programs, even if they
weren't 100 percent," he said. "The notion of cooperation
with the U.N. as a way of deterring aggression is completely [different] to the
new doctrine of U.S. policy of
that the U.S. may be entitled to act aggres"preemption'
sively as it seems to know best."
After a brief introduction, chemistry Professor Jim
Rego responded to the question "Why War?" by asking,
"To what extent is any war justified?"Rego then continued
to recount past events such as the Vietnam War, the

Persian Gulf War and the fall of the Berlin Wall. He questioned the precedent the United States would set for future
diplomacy after invading Iraq, as well as some motives for
invasion, such as the need to maintain U.S. identity. "Do
we need an enemy to have an identity?" Rego asked.
In a brief discussion about freedom, he said, "Freedom is
essentially a very dangerous thing. We are very free people

said, "I think we've run out of people's butts to kick and that

Next, religion professor William Frost presented his
platform on the "ethics of humanitarianintervention." He
defined ethics as universal, not based on one's cultural or
religious background. Elaborating on the term "humanitarian," Frost said, "I am interested in humanitarianism.
That is, if you can make a case for intervention that is
going to reach me, I have to be persuaded that the inter-

must be a last resort. He concluded by asking, "Can we talk

Students' differing war opinions voiced in the Ring
BY KELSEY HOLLENBACK
khollenl@swarthmore.edu
Discussion at the student
forum last Thursday in Mephistos
ranged from violence and pacifism to the concept of a "just" war
to the possibility of war with Iraq.
While opinions on the nature of

violence varied widely, it seemed
clear that the majority of the students present at the forum were
skeptical of United States military involvement overseas.
The panel was one in a series
of upcoming discussions sponsored by the Ring.
"I think that we know a lot at
Swarthmore, but we're engaged
in a culture that is cynical about
real communication," said Jed
Cohen 'O4 of the Ring, adding.
"It's not just Swarthmore that

doesn't communicate enough. We
have a low level of dialogue on
important issues."
Once affiliated with the

designed to "stimulate a series of

discussions around campus
where people who have definite,
differing opinions on certain topics can have discussions on
them," according to Michelle
Park '9B.

Also from the Ring and present at the forum was moderator
Katrina Clark 'O3.

The topic Thursday night was
whether violence is ever legitimate in the context of Sept. 11 and
the war on terrorism.
The panel included Pete
Mohanty 'O5 of Why-War, student
council co-president Matt Rubin
'O3 and Society of Friends member Chris Segal 'O5.
"War has been far too persistent a question in our society,"
said Mohanty in his opening
statement. He outlined the history of the United States and the
conflict in the Middle East, giving
context to some of the specific
concerns addressed during the

panel.

He also addressed a concern
raised by many of the students
present, about the selectivity the
United States government seems
to keep when becoming involved

in armed conflicts abroad.
"The Bush administration has
been really pushing war with
Iraq," Mohanty said. "What we
have here is an attempt at policing

where the policeman, the United
States, decides who to police."
"In order for something to be
justified, it need not be perfect,
and it need not be ideal," Rubin

pointed out. Rubin, who identified himself as "the only right of
extremely left person here," used

a different metaphor.

He asked what actions would

should Cohen attack fellow panelist Segal and drew parallels to
the question of war in general and
the United States in particular.
The American government,
Rubin noted, has a responsibility
to protect its people. And, he
added, "The existence of weapons
of mass destruction alter what we
conceive of as self-defense.
"I don't necessarily take a stance
on the Iraqi conflict," he said. "I
don'tthink that I have enough information to make a decision."
Segal approached the violence

question from a religious view.
"The basis for pretty much all
Quaker activism and pacifism,"

he began by explaining, "is contained in the phrase, 'There is a

would argue that you could also

After the panelists had concluded, the students in the audience asked questions and stated
their own concerns and opinions.

Rajaa Shakir 'O4 observed that
involvement abroad is a two-way

she said.
She also brought up the impact

It's his ivory tower: Al Bloom speaks
BY PREETY

SIDHU
ssidhul@swarthmore.edu

Perched atop ever-growing bureaucracies, stereotypical American university
presidents spend more and more of their
days courting the dollars of wealthy alumni. Since the 19605, most large American
institutions of higher education have
attempted to deliver a value-free education
in which fact is separated from ethics and
responsibility.
In such a system, some argue, the role of
the university president has degenerated
into a purely bureaucratic job. Robert A.
Corrigan, president of San Francisco State
University, recently wrote a letter in the
New York Times imploring university
presidents to take strong leadership
stances and guide the wealth of resources
at the disposal of their institutions toward
making the world a better place. He
believes his generation of college presidents can be a turning point toward bolder
leadership and greater social and ethical
responsibility in higher education.
But how does Swarthmore College fit
into this trend? The Phoenix interviewed
President Al Bloom on his vision for this
college and his role as its leader.
The Phoenix: What are your reactions
to President Corrigan's statements?
It is true that large American universities have in general in their undergraduate
programs placed emphasis on career preparation and value-free education. But this
has not been true of Swarthmore or the
small liberal arts tradition.
I think that's something that he unfortunately omitted and something that importantly distinguishes liberal arts colleges.
Swarthmore, from its founding, has
believed in combining the development of

intellectual rigor, analytic ability, and a
broad foundation of knowledge, with an
ability to see and take responsibility for ethical and social consequences.
It's a real privilege to be president of a
college that has a tradition of combining
these: the intellectual, the ethical and
social responsibility, which produces graduates who consistently see the joining of
these as their central experience at
Swarthmore.
When I look at what alums are doing I
am always greatly impressed by their commitment to not only looking at issues in
depth, analyzing their consequences,
engaging in the complexity of the issue, but
also trying to see through that issue to how
they can use the insight they gained from
them to create a better world.
It's wonderful that presidents of larger
universities are beginning to articulate the
importance of these dimensions to their
mission. I found it particularly wonderful
in reading that article of the few presidents
listed, one was Judith Ramaley, who was a
graduate of Swarthmore, and the other was
Nan Keohane, who taught at Swarthmore.
It is interesting that those presidents that
are articulating this kind of issue have a
very close relation to Swarthmore.
How then do you see your own role as
the leader of this school?
I see this school as having a really
extraordinary mission in terms of combining preparation for the most rigorous, complex conceptual analysis with commitment
to using the insights one gains to create a
better world a more just, more generous,
and more inclusive world.
I think that the number one obligation I
have as president is, because the mission is

THE PHOENIX

so extraordinary and so right on, to make
sure this institution works in fulfilling that
mission, and in doing so it not only has an
enduring formative effect on its graduates
but it also provides a model for other colleges
and hopefully for some of the universities.
We're teaching people certain kinds of
values, like the need for deep understanding of issues, like the desire for an inclusive society and world, like the desire to
listen to people and form consensual decisions, like the desire to have more compassion and more humanity in the world. But
we're not teaching particular stances on
issues, like whether we should take a certain stand on Iraq. Rather, we are saying
this institution is about teaching people to
think deeply and come up with their own
sense of what they believe is morally right.
In that we play an absolutely singular ethi-

cal role.
There is real admiration for Swarthmore and we are in a position to influence.
I am therefore, by being able to deliver this
mission, able to provide leadership to the
country in this sense.
The Corrigan article also talks about
how the role of president, more perhaps
in the large universities, has degenerated to business manager and fundraiser.
To what extent does that apply to liberal arts presidents in general and you in

rhetoric of a well-balancedliberal arts education.
Of course, we know that, according to the case statement of the current capital campaign, the real meaning of
Swarthmore is "preserving the meaning of Swarthmore,"
whatever that means. But anyone at last Saturday's
Philadelphia launch of the campaign would be hardpressed to give that second, more official definition; they
could certainly, however, talk about the money.
In February, the college hosted a similar event at New
York City's Asia Society on the Upper East Side's Park
Avenue. Justin Kane, reporting for The Phoenix, compared that event and its slick attitude to "the machinations
of a high-class hooker."
To apply that metaphor to this past weekend's events,
the latest incarnation of the launch celebration was more
like a cheap street-walker just out for the money; no wooing this time.
As with the New York event, the college didn't hold
back, renting a newly-developed building. The Kimmel
Center for the Performing Arts on Broad Street
a.k.a.
the Avenue of the Arts
in Center City, Philadelphia, is
certainly
glassan impressive structure. The
domed ceiling stretches high above to project an atriumlike atmosphere, and the view of the Philadelphia skyline
is top-notch.
As the alumni flowed into the building, they were greeted by the welcoming table with the entireKimmel Center
as the backdrop. But after that, the view got a little bit
worse. The guests of Swarthmore were herded up to the
corner of a second-floor balcony, and they were left there

champagne and beer flowed

The space made it hard to talk to anyone. Alums were
jostling for position to catch up with old friends or hear
from the various college administrators about the
"Meaning" campaign. With 300 people crammed into a corner of the building, space was definitely at a premium, and
since there were no tables, the alums were as familiar with
someone's elbow in their backs as they were with the person to whom they were talking.
The make-or-break moment of the evening came once
everyone had been encouraged to find seats in the
Perelman Theater for a student presentation mixed with
speeches and the Meaning of Swarthmore video.
The audience heard the usual Swarthmore cliches.
"Swarthmore was a place where you were no longer the
smartest in your class," launch committee co-chair
Barbara Klack 'B6 said.

"The regional campaign kick-offs allow us to connect

with many more alums," added Chairman of the Board of

Managers Larry Shane '56.
"The meaning of Swarthmore is to consistently produce
graduates such as you. We must, if we want to fund enhancements, rely on the spirit and generosity of those who care
about the college," college president Al Bloom said.
It's what everyone wants to hear. By praising the
alums, the college makes them appreciate their time at

Swarthmore even more. Combined with three student presentations representing the diversity of the performing
arts on campus, the alums could overlook the tight space

on the balcony and the fact that the only food served were

tiny hors d'oeuvres.

Up until that point, the event had been an instance of
pleasant, subtle schmoozing. Then along came Fred Kyle '54.

Hotel plans stalled for now
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu

Many are aware of the need for a hotel near the
college where parents and visitors can stay, but it
may be some time before the physical presence of an
inn graces the college grounds.
Several years ago, the Borough of Swarthmore
appointed a Town Revitalization Committee to
explore ways of making the town center a more
vibrant and valuable resource for college students
and local residents alike. This task encompasses

everything from replacing difficult-to-read street
signs to encouraging the Co-Op to expand its facilities and improving restaurant options.

"If the project moves forward, we
have identified someone who we
think would be an appropriate
developer."
Larry Schall 75
The Town Revitalization Committee recognized a
demand for hotel space near the Swarthmore campus. Currently, parents of students must stay a 15-30
minute drive away from campus when they visit
their children. Building an inn on college property
would solve this problem. The inn would also pro-

vide a location for a restaurant and perhaps bring
more business to the area. The college agreed with
the plan and put in motion several years of discussion about the project's specifics.
The proposed inn will most likely go on the former football field on the west side of Chester Rd.,
adjacent to the train station. According to Larry
Schall, the college's vice president for administration, the Town Revitalization Committee is currently

a number of land-use issues. One of
these is how the choice of location for the hotel would
affect future building projects. The Committee is
expected to reconvene and present its conclusions to
the Borough Council in early 2003.
The new hotel will include a restaurant, which
will address a serious need in the Swarthmore area.
Since the fire in the beloved Inglenuek Tea House, a
cozy restaurant frequented by Swarthmore students
and town residents alike, the town center has suffered from a shortage of dining options. After a long
legal process, the borough has succeeded in making
re-examining

tee, and his speech
made it pretty clear
that the wining and
dining was over.
The

campaign

wanted money, and
that's why they had
the launch event. Kyle
opened his speech by
posing the question of
why the campaign
had been called the
Meaning
of
Swarthmore.
"We're leaving it to
you all to fill in the
blanks. We need $230
million to make sure
the strength of the college is perpetuated
into the future," he

said.

Ben Kabak Phoenix Staff

Board member Fred Kyle made
the main appeal to alumni.

This was the direct
sales pitch, in case
you were wondering. Back in February, the campaign
launch in New York barely mentioned money. Seven
months later, the pitch is changing.
The best line came towards the end of Kyle's speech. "It
can be just as easy as writing a check," he said.
From then on, there was no doubt that this was not one
of those so-called "launch events." It was a fundraiser,
pure and simple. Money, obviously, is the main goal of the
Meaning of Swarthmore campaign, and alums attending
the event last Saturday in Philadelphia weren't allowed to
forget that.

Swarthmore residents value the town's current

To address this issue, the borough petitioned legislators in Harrisburg to introduce a bill that would

change the options that Pennsylvania municipalities
were permitted to include on liquor-law-related referenda. The law passed, and Swarthmore held a referendum last year in which residents voted to allow
a borough liquor license to be granted only to a
restaurant in a hotel on a college campus. A similar
measure, which would have allowed liquor to be
served in restaurants and bars, had failed a vote in
the 19405.

Dorm techs' effectiveness called into question
BY CYNTHIA WU
xwu2@swarthmore.edu
At first glance, these Swatties
look like every other on campus;
they go to class, eat in Sharpies,
and don't wear the phrase "Dorm
Tech" emblazoned in bold lettering across the fronts of their
shirts. But they differ from most
other Swarthmore students in one
important respect: They know a
heck of a lot about computers.
Or do they?
The dorm consultant program
started in 1991 to provide students
with someone to go to when their
computers froze up, broke down,

or just wouldn't turn on. Ideally,
dorm techs help students with all
their technology-related problems. But some students still have
complaints about their dorm
techs' effectiveness.
When students were asked
whether they think their dorm
techs are effective, many who
haveused their help before voiced
strong,

positive

opinion.

As

JillianWaldman 'O6 said, "I think
a lot of times, they are effective
like when they just sit down and
type something and your comput-

er suddenly works."
But almost all are careful to distinguish between their own dorm
tech experience and that of the
general student population. "The
dorm techs are a good idea and are
often effective
but there are
...

going to be ineffective dorm techs

anyway. I think some dorm techs
are willing to go above and beyond
the call of duty to make sure that
things work," Joy Mills 'O5 said.
Many students are realizing
that the availability of dorm techs

is an imperative aspect of their
effectiveness. "One of the dorm
techs I had last year never fixed
my computer—but when he actually does stuff, he can fix things,"
said Ixel Cevera 'O4.
Sometimes, when a dorm doesn't
have enough techs, dorm techs are
asked to commute from other nearby
dorms to ensure that each dorm has
enough help. As the Manager of
Dorm Consultants, Sean Tinney is
responsible for making sure thateach
dorm has an average of four dorm
techs. Sometimes, this results in
dormslike Willets having more dorm
techs that live elsewhere than dorm
techs who actually reside in Willets.
Tinney recognizes that

that "dorm techs are highly net

dorm techs with too much of a
work load to refer students to a
commuting dorm tech.
Toward commuting dorm techs,

hardware, it is their responsibility to refer such problems to the
help desk. "[The ITS] kept my
computer for two days, and had to

reformat it to get it to work. But
they did fix it, so I can't complain," John Ervin 'O6 said. Other

students, however, are less than
thrilled with the way their

students have different opinions.

Special Projects of the Information
Technologies Service, the program
of dorm consultants was started in
1991, when the college first started
to network dormitories. In order

to be a dorm consultant, a student
has to have a certain amount of
technical knowledge and problemsolving skills.
But the ability to interact well
with people is an even more important part of this job. "While he or
she has to have a good technical
knowledge base, it is a lot more
important to be sensitive toward
the feelings of a person who's having a problem," Sean Tinney said.
As a result, he hopes thatstudents

see the dorm techs as open resources
for help. Although there were many
students who reported that they've
never really had contact with their
dorm techs, most of them remained
optimistic on their helpfulness.
"The rapidly changing environment. . .makes it very hard to adapt
quickly to the situation," Tinney
said in response to complaints. He
hoped students will be understanding of the fact that dorm techs "are
all students too. They have to deal
with midterms and 500 page readings just like any other student."

it's not a just war; it's just war."
The fourth panelist, history professor Timothy Burke, explained
his reasons against beginning a new war with Iraq. He first mentioned that the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan did accomplish some

important goals, such as the elimination of some members of the terrorist group Al Qaeda. He also asserted that errors were made in
these attacks. The state of civil liberties, in the United States, for
example, "was not a necessary cost but merely the cost of bad leadership from the Bush administration."

"The biggest service we can do for Al
Qaeda is to invade Iraq."
Professor Tim Burke
Burke then presented the consequences of attacking "an objective

that has no relevance whatsoever to the conflict at hand." He said
that the United States would further endanger world peace and also
lose the war on terror if it invaded Iraq. "The biggest service we can
do for Al Qaeda is to invade Iraq. We might as well put up a sign that
says 'Uncle Sam wants you to join Al Qaeda.'"
After Burke's comments, moderator Pete Mohanty 'O5 opened up
the discussion to questions and comments from the floor.
Gabriel Tajeu 'O3 made a statement on the death toll thus far and
the cost of lives another attack would cause. "The three thousand
people that got killed in the World Trade Center
that shouldn'tbe
excused," he said. "But the amount of people that the U.S. has been
responsible for killing or the amount of children that the U.S. has
embargoed in preventing food and medicine to getting .to them ...
how do you relegate yourself to saying that we can have a preemptive strike on a country that hasn't attacked us yet, while at the
same time we know that they may be able to unleash weapons of
mass destruction and maybe kill 30,000 people. Really, how many
people do you have to kill?"
Tajeu later cited the Rodney King incident as an example of performing violence "on a hunch" and of the problems of race relations
in the United States. "The U.S. feels that as a white majority it can do
whatever it wants to do," he said.
Mohanty and the faculty members both felt the panel was constructive. "We wanted something that could reach out to a larger

audience," Mohanty

Princeton, Brown in clash over early admission rules
BY DAN ROSENHECK
HARVARD CRIMSON (HARVARD

U.)

(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
In conflict with
national guidelines, Princeton and Brown Universities are
refusing to allow their Early Decision applicants to file
simultaneous Early Action applications to other schools
for the upcoming admissions season.
Their policies have set up a showdown between the two
colleges and the professional organization that establishes

those guidelines, the National Association for College
Admission Counseling (NCAC), that could result in both
colleges' expulsion from that group.
The disagreement stems from a policy change instituted at NACAC's sparsely attended convention in San
Antonio one week after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when

members voted to allow students

applying

under binding

Early Decision programs at one college to file as many
nonbinding Early Action applications as they wished.
Although students would still be required to enroll at their
Early Decision school if accepted, they could attend an
Early Action school that admitted them if they did not get
into their Early Decision college.

But Princeton's and Brown's admissions materials tell

prospective applicants that they may not submit any other
early applications
including nonbinding Early Action
ones if they choose to apply there under Early Decision.
By accepting membership in NACAC, colleges agree to
abide by the organization's policies including its definitions of Early Decision and Early Action, according to
Martin A. Wilder, NACAC's Vice President for Admission,
Counseling, and Enrollment Practices. Continued noncompliance can result in expulsion from NACAC, which
Wilder said the association has not done in 20 years to his
September 26, 2002

knowledge.
Neither Princeton Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
nor NACAC leadership appear willing to move on the issue.
Brown's Director of Admissions, Michael Goldberger, is
traveling and could not be reached for comment.
"As a matter of principle I do not think it appropriate
for a college to cede responsibility for setting its application requirements to NACAC," Hargadon wrote in an email.
"As I have discussed with the NACAC leadership, I cannot in good conscience cede to them the authority to dictate Princeton's application requirements."
One official close to NACAC leadership said the organization was frustrated by Princeton's recalcitrance.
"[NACAC has] gone toe to toe with Princeton a couple
rounds in fact, and [Princeton is] die-hard," he said.
"They're resistant to making a modification there."

and work at two parties. Yim said that the
Frisbee players "carried the [PA] program"
last year. "I would say we didn't recruit as
heavily last year because we had the
Frisbee players," she added.
Some Frisbee players may return as
PAs for pay this year. Team captain Misha
Horowitz 'O3 and Yim both said that many
of the Frisbee players PAed more than
their requirement last year. "It was fun,"
Horowitz said. "It's not like it's that hard a
job. You get to interact with all your drunk
friends. You just have to check IDs and stay
sober. I think the people who did it didn't

think it was so bad."
But even if some Frisbee players do continue to PA, a substantial number of underclassmen must be recruited to fill the needsof
all the parties on campus. "I'm hoping to really put a positive spin on being a PA," Yim

said. "I also want to make PAing more structured; for example, I want to provide kits for
PAs." Yim and Ortiz plan to advertise the PA
program with posters and mass mailings, and
they have sent out an e-mail urging students
to "get paid to attend parties at Swat."
Still, according to one past PA, the PA
program this year has not been nearly as
visible on campus as he remembers it in the

Mike Tu 'O5 believed that despite some drawbacks, an inn is a
much needed asset for the college. "Parents who come for graduation
of course must find a place to stay," he said. "If they want to room
within walking distance of campus, currently one of the only options
is to rent out a room in Willets. I think that's sad."
But some students disagree. Horrified by the prospect of an inn on
campus, Carla Humud 'O5 said, "If the town of Swarthmore had a
hotel, my parents would be here every weekend, which is a very
scary prospect. They might never leave." So perhaps it is a good
thing that the hotel project progresses but will not be a concrete reality for quite some time.

Ortiz disagreed. "On the whole, I do not
think that students' attitudes towards
PAing have become more negative," she
said. She traced the shortage of PAs to an
increase in viable financial alternatives.

Noteworthy platters from the likes of
Eminem, DJ Shadow, and Princess

attention since their releases this winter or
spring. The latest two to catch my ear are
the current releases from the Ohio-born
Rjd2 and the 20-year-old Baltimorean
upstart Cex. (If you notice a similarity in
their cover art, that would be Cex giving
smirking props to Rj, whose record
dropped this summer.) Whether it matters
if you're black or white is an issue still up
for debate among the hip-hop community;
but let's set the sociopolitical implications
of my observation aside for the moment
and peep the music.

clunky, abrasive, political aesthetic of Def
Jux, Anticon, et al. In their point of origin
these two records are closer to the latter
milieu; Rjd2 is on Definitive Jux, the bastion of what's derogatorily termed back-

beats are simple and hard-hitting, but
quirky enough to be fresh despite their
occasionally limited sonic range. Further
production elements, ranging from the
inevitable scratching and horn hits to some
sweet jazzy guitar work, a striking harp
sample, and the fly r 'n' b vocalizing of
Craig Wedren, ensure that every track is at
least aurally interesting, and make the
majority of them catchy as hell.
But the real attraction here is Cex's

flow. It's measured (as he puts it:
"each line i spit was born with 20 brothers/in order for him to live i had to sacri-

umphant opener "Brutal Exposure" (whose

Hell," in which each grade gets eight bars)
and bike riding (on standout track "Ghost
Rider," which he told me in April was
"already a hit in Thailand.") As Cex injects
his own wry sensibility into an essentially
traditionalist hip-hop record (complete
with brilliantly devised self-effacing skits
between tunes), his position relative to the
rap community at large may be ambiguous
is he, ultimately, merely a laptop dilettante, a hip-hop outsider?
but the vitality and fun of this record is anything but.

Rjd2 (presumably no relation to R2D2)
fashions instrumental hip-hop, very much
in the vein of DJ Shadow. The comparison
is inevitable (and Rj splits the difference
between the haunting, atmospheric genius
of "Endtroducing" and the more lighthearted, eclectic "Private Press"), but
whereas Shadow tends to linger and meditate on his samples, allowing his tracks to
unfold gradually, Rjd2 is more likely to
keep things moving, layer on more elements and switch up his arrangements,

eradicating any possibility of monotony
setting in. The process of sample collage,
practiced by both artists, is more readily
apparent here if Shadow is more adept at
cutting and pasting his samples so finely
that they become completely subservient to
his musical ends, the occasional sloppiness
of Rjd2's technique lends many of his
tracks an improvisatory quality that translates into pure exuberance and excitement,
as is perhaps most evident on the '7os soul
party mash-up "Good Times Roll pt. 2."
Rjd2's next regional show:

October 18th,

Gasoline

Elsewhere, Rjd2 conjures up spy-movie
sinister-synth (on lead track "The Horror"),
laid-back blues, compelling trip-hop and
straight-up rap (with fine guest spots from
MCs Blueprint, Jakki the Motormouth and
Copywrite), always with countless layers of
intriguing texture and never straying far
from a sense of funk which is far more satisfactory and organic than most of
Shadow's work. My favorite cut currently
(it changes with each listen) is probably
"Ghostwriter," which lays a blustery brass
section and a gorgeous choral sample from
Elliott Smith's "I Didn't Understand" over a
bed of acoustic guitar and a mellow but
funky hip-house two-step. Besides a great
knack for sampling, Rjd2's finest asset is
probably his marvelous compositional
sense
even the instrumental pieces (the
bulk of the record) feature intelligently
plotted song structures that make them as
rewarding for serious listening as for dancing. Achieving a balance between listening
and dancing is perhaps the ultimate goal of
rhythm-based music, and on this debut outing Mr. d2 accomplishes all the prerequisites common to both activities: variety,
creativity, fun, and groove. Respect is due.

Igby suffers from worse than a weird nickname
BY ESTER BLOOM
eblooml@swarthmore.edu

Suppose you have a wacky cousin. Suppose it was up in
the air whether that cousin is eccentric bound to live his
life on the fringe, founding new religions, braiding rugs,
attending Swarthmore College
or whether he is in actuality cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
Let's call him Igby.
There is an indie film about Igby out right at this
moment. Called "Igby Goes Down," Igby's vehicle is very
much like Igby himself: uneven, self-involved, adolescent,
spotty and depressing. But "Igby" is earnest, and occasionally "Igby" flashes with such brilliance, it's hard to
justify the straightjacket and the electroshock, no matter
how tempting that may seem.
On one hand, "Igby" is so meta it could make you tired.
Burr Steers, the writer-director, has made it clear that this
story is his story. He is Igby, or rather was, back when he
was a troubled 16-year-old with too much spirit and too little desire to please in high school.
Igby (Kieran Culkin) suffers from more than just a
bizarre nickname. He is the product of an unusually dysfunctional family: a pill-popping Wicked Queen mother,
Mimi (Susan Sarandon,), a schizophrenic father (Bill
Pullman), who's been locked away in an asylum for six
years, and a polished, neo-Fascist, nihilistic older brother,
Oliver (Ryan Phillipe, who at this point has turned the sin-

12

ister seducer into a trademark).
When his mother makes good on her threat to send him
to military school, Igby runs, and, like Holden before him,
hides out in New York City. Unlike Holden, who makes do
on his own, Igby imposes on the mistress (Amanda Peet) of
his polished, neo-Fascist and incredibly rich godfather,
D.H. (Jeff Goldblum with a tumbler of scotch and a cigar).
Every John needs his Jane. Igby's comes in the form of
Sookie (Claire Danes), a disaffected East Sider on leave
from Bennington and also free to spend her days wandering

around the city.

Igby's only goal is to take the GED. In this he succeeds,
but not before D.H. leaves him bleeding on the stairwell,
Oliver has wooed away Sookie, he has to run drugs for
money and his mother begins to die from breast cancer.
This is all pretty run of the mill for dark comedy. The
problem is simply that the film is not consistent. Some
one-liners stick; others fall way short. The pacing is choppy. Flashbacks occur without warning and only occasion-

ally advance the plot.
More fundamentally, some characters
Igby for examare well-drawn and complex. Others, like his mothple
er, merely come off as monsters, unredeemable even by

death.

Every woman in the movie is shared by two men. This
never turns out well, and consequently the females come
off as either evil or tragic. The men, while more varied,
ultimate come off as cold-hearted, except for Igby's poor

father, who is wasting away in a small white room.
Igby, to his credit, refuses to be beaten down by circumstance. He cannot survive in this world, and while at
first he seems to be waiting for, or inviting, his own nervous breakdown, by the end he has chosen another method
of escape.
This is Burr Steers' first effort and it shows. On the
other hand, it is cheering to know that Igby made it at least
as far as Hollywood and got this movie made. Now perhaps
he can reach even higher, past his past and himself.

NOW THAT MY pAfZ-fNT*
s\mC#~W TD THf PHOENIX,

Throughout the past year, the notion of a War
on Terror has slowly taken over our nation's government and in turn, the media. There have been
few hardcore hawks or diehard doves; most of us
have fallen somewhere in the middle. All of us,
though, have wanted to know more than we've
been told.
Now President George W. Bush has turned his
attention to Iraq, but his techniques for pushing
the war have been less than honest. Bush must
come clean with his war plans, to both Congress
and the American public. Only then can a truly
democratic decision be made.
Bush however has not been playing by the

t WILL

SAO\,Y

o\n £cm

&£

sb\X\H(r

?Wftc sm?£ LtKF...
}

rules. Through deceptive politics, unilateral decisions and evasion of frank messages to the public,
Bush has brought us to the edge of war without
any of us knowing quite how we got here.
However, it is in every American's best interest to stay abreast on this developing story. It is
time for Swatties, and everyone else, to pick up a
newspaper or watch the 30-minute evening news
broadcast. We could be at war with Iraq within the
next few weeks, and it's more important to know
what's going on the world than to have spent 30
extra minutes reading that book for your seminar.
Most people don't really know what's going on
right now with Iraq. Here's the situation in a

nutshell.
Last week, Bush sent Congress a draft bill that
would give him the authority "to use all means
that he determines to be appropriate, including
force" to ensure that Iraq disarms and to defend US
security interests in the area. The administration
wants this bill approved quickly; we could be at
war soon.
How did America get to this point? Last winter
the general public was not preparing for war with
Iraq. After all, we were still in Afghanistan. Iraq
was just an idea, slowly infiltrating public opinion
through the predictions of pundits. Then, in July,
The New York Times found out that Bush's plans
called for air, land and sea-based attacks on Iraq
involving as many as 250,000 US troops.
Now, a Sept. 22 New York Times article reveals
that many steps have already been taken to initiate
war with Iraq, including the deployment of thousands of marines and ground forces into Kuwait

and the relocation of elite Special Operations
troops from the military to CIA units (a process

that facilitates covert missions). Administration

officials insist Bush has "made no decision about a
war with Iraq." Still, Bush is avoiding the problem
directly.
It seems that a straightforward public
announcement regarding Bush's war plans is in
order. Even influential Republicans are becoming
impatient with the administration's evasive tactics. Until then, the past way to find out the administration's latest dealings are to keep checking up

on the news.

Although the majority of Americans support an
invasion of Iraq, they want Bush to secure
approval from Congress and the US's allies before
proceeding. On Monday, three retired four-star
generals publicly concurred with this view, and
voters in interviews across the country have
expressed unease at the quick pace of the administration's decisions regarding war. Swatties have
voiced similar reservations in recent forums.
So that's where we, as a nation, are right now.
The events of the next few weeks will determine
the U.S.A.'s course of actions in the Persian Gulf
area as posturing over the Iraqi situation wjll
increase. As the presidential administration and
the Congress rush headlong into another war over
Saddam Hussein's controlling Iraq, try to keep up
with the pace of current events. Take 15 minutes
out of that busy Swat schedule and read up on the
latest war news because before you know it, our
troops will be heading east to fight once again.

In tough times, stop and remember the Moon
BY ARTHUR CHU
achul@swarthmore.edu

Last Saturday was the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival.
Those of you who are of Chinese extraction probably
know it. It's our equivalent of the American holiday of
Thanksgiving, with its connotations of family togetherness,
of reflection on the past year, of gratitude for the blessings
life has given you.
It's a night when families go out to look at the Moon and
contemplate. We eat moon cakes, buttery pastries filled with
bean paste, preserved egg yolk, or my
■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
favorite: a sweet, airy lotus seed.
It's a harvest festival, when the
fruits of the field have been brought
in, and the long preparation for the
winter ahead begins. A middle time.
When you're in the middle, you see,
you have nowhere to go. The past year
is ending, and the coming one hasn't started yet. There is little to do but sit and think and rest, and to pay a visit to our
old friend, the Moon.
The Moon, you see, is yin: feminine, quiet, introspective.
The odd, simple joy that comes from romantic love, from
family, from a good night's sleep.
The Sun is yang: masculine, active, competitive. Western
culture worships it; Americans love to bask in the Sun, to
surround themselves with that golden aura of power and
success. To sweat in the midday heat, chasing 1600 SAT
scores and 4.0 GPAs, big paychecks and impressive titles,
Mercedes-Benzes in the driveway and cottages in the

peace that passes all understanding, that profound humility
before the universe, before God, that leaves you with nothing to prove. A deep truth that the Chinese saw in the face of
the Moon.
You can almost imagine yourself reaching out and touching that bright circle, flying away to a world where shining
stars wheel in black velvet and all is silent save the humming of the harmony of the spheres.
And even though you know you can't go there, that the
only men who ever did go there needed giant metal ships
and heavy pressurized spacesuits to escape the gravity of
this brutal Earth, even though you
know that for us in this life the Moon

You can step outside, and look past the ceiling to the

Moon.
It watches quietly from its orbit, reminding us that beautiful things will always exist up there no matter how many
things go wrong down here. That peace can come from something as simple as sitting by a tree and watching the moonlight glimmer off the clouds.
Funny, how you can forget things like moonlight and cool
evening breezes, family and friends and the peace that passes all understanding. It's too easy to spend too much time in
the Sun. Too easy to get caught up in the great game that we
Swatties play so well, and forget that it's not being played
for real stakes, that no professor, job interviewer or judgmental peer can ever take away the Moon.
I guess that's why we have festivals. To remind us.

Re-examining a living wage Practice, not theory,

Swatties, beware. One

RANDY GOLDSTEIN
Bursting the Bubble

seeks your support. The
College
Swarthmore
Living Wage Campaign
has done nothing but a
to
the
disservice
Swarthmore community
as a whole. While their
intentions may be noble,
those who promote a living wage on campus fail to
understand that the consequences of its imple-

mentation will ultimately

prove contrary to its stated purpose.
Wanting to improve the lives of low-wage workers is
a worthy and laudable goal. A magical increase in the
wages of those workers, however, is a loathsome and
myopic means to achieving that goal. One must realize
that, while employees of the college are loved and

Swarthmore's employees will be more likely to suffer
Even if one's humanitarian instincts are so blind as
to discount the importance of the employer's response
to living wage, one must realize that it also has a powerful effect on the labor pool itself. If unskilled, entrylevel positions begin to garner higher wages for the
same level of output, the number of people competing
for those positions will naturally increase. Why should
people invest their time in finishing high school or taking college courses when the same ultimate salary
could be had via artificially high payouts in the
unskilled labor sector? As the number of jobs decreases due to the high cost of human capital, the pool of
applicants begins to overflow, inevitably leaving even
more victims of the living wage stranded on the edge.
If we momentarily give into temptation and cast
aside sound logic and economic reasoning, there still
exist practical flaws in the concept of a living wage.
The Compensation Review Committee's report from
last spring explicitly states that "the College budget

has very little flexibility from year to year" and that
"for every $40,000 added to the budget, the College
would need $1 million in new endowment." With these
two facts in mind, what source of funding can we
expect for a living wage? Will it be tacked on to the ever
increasing real cost of tuition? Will it be drawn from
the financial aid that affords
Swarthmore such a diverse student body? I am confident that
the standard Swattie would be

employees

the worker's presence on
campus is due only to the
fact that the college needs
someone to clean the floors. If a machine could do the
job more reliably and at a lower cost, this person would
quickly be forced to seek work elsewhere.
The salaries of college employees are neither random nor maliciously determined. Rather, any student
of introductory economics will realize that these
salaries are determined through an intricate price system by which workers performing similar tasks in similar environments receive similar wages. Just because
Swarthmore employees work hard does not mean that
their labor is worth any more than that of their peers.
Employers purchase productivity, not effort. Why
should Swarthmore pay $9 per hour for the productivity of a single employee under the new system when it
could have paid $9 per hour for the productivity of L35
workers under the old system (at $6.66 per hour)? For
this increase to make economic sense, employees of the
college must increase their output by more than 33 percent to justify their wage increase. Yet somehow the
bathrooms in Willets just don't seem 33 percent cleaner.
And while a living wage is a nuisance to employers,
it is an insufferable blow to the employees themselves.
At a higher minimum wage, employers will be discouraged from taking on new employees, and when
they are confronted with sluggish markets, human capital will be a more attractive target for cost cutting.
That is, when Swarthmore's endowment suffers,

these proposals. Swarthmore
College exists to serve its students. To sacrifice the comfort
of those who pay to be here in
order to artificially augment
the salaries of those who are
already here, for no real increase in productivity,
would simply be asinine.
There do exist more thorough and less costly ways
of improving the lives of low-wage workers. Many
economists cite the earned income tax credit as a steppingstone for supplementing lower overall incomes.
Programs such as this one still impose a cost on society, but a cost that is more spread out and whose effects
on the labor market are less tumultuous. Another
advantage of these programs is that they benefit lowwage workers in all of society. The living wage campaign seems to want to help only those who have the
luxury of working for sanctimonious college students.
Superficial social-reform movements such as living
wage campaigns are appealing to those who fail to see
such movements' implications beyond their intentions.
To advocate a living wage is to accept a simple explanatin of a complex problem, to grasp at the seemingly

easiest solution, and to fail to realize that its execution
ultimately worsens the problem that it aims to alleviate. Before you jump on the living wage bandwagon,
realize that issues such as this one are not nearly as
concrete as certain campus groups would have you
believe. Before they get to you, please take the time and
logically.

Conspiracy Theory

My roommate used to say
that the herbal supplements in
Echinacea tea would eventually make me drop dead. This
was the roommate who would
wave a lighter wildly around
the room at night rather than
turn on the light, so I'd say I
had a pretty equal chance of
being burned alive while I
slept. The only side effect of
consuming large amounts of
Echinacea tea that I've noticed
is that I tend to be far more
incoherent than usual. So consider yourselves warned.
Being sick but feeling too
guilty to go to sleep (because
going to bed when you're sick
is only for the weak), I went to

the screening of "Senorita Extraviada: Missing Young
Woman." As you are probably all aware, the documentary is
about the nearly 300 women in Juarez, Mexico that have been
kidnapped, raped, mutilated and murdered. What was extraordinary was that not many people in Juarez seem either to care
or to have the ability to do anything about it. Not only is everyone either involved or complicit, but there is also no larger
institution
even on the national level that is able or willing to launch a serious investigation. It's like 300 Chandra
Levy cases in the same town, except that these girls are poor
so nobody cares if they disappear. A high-ranking Mexican
official even suggested that the girls themselves were to blame,
for dressing "provocatively" and being out at night.
—

Globalization does not kill yogng
women. People do.
Juarez is the largest town on the border between the United
States and Mexico and a major crossroads for bringing drugs
into the United States. The general consensus seems to be that
those officials who are not directly involved in the murders
nevertheless have a stake in the drug trade and are loath to
investigate something that could bring their own crimes to
light. Everyone else is just afraid. And after all, what is there
not to be afraid of, when women tell of being beaten and raped
by the police officers whom they have sought out for help?
Since nobody could be held responsible, globalization

emerged as a shadowy culprit that opened the United
States/Mexico border to American factories that took advantage of cheap Mexican labor without paying Mexican tariffs on
their products. These companies employ mainly young women
and make little effort to ensure that these employees make it
home alive. There is, after all, an almost endless supply of
them. Some women's groups in Juarez believe that these factories, called "maquiladoras," even facilitate the kidnapping of
women, by having them photographed so that the killers can
hand-select them. The operators of these maquiladoras include
American companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Ford Motor
Co. and General Electric. It is true that not all of the girls
killed worked at maquiladoras. But it is the highly profitable
maquiladoras that provide the economic incentive for both
Mexican politicians and American stockholders to ignore the
murders of so many young girls and women.
But is globalization, with its faceless corporations that are
concerned only with profit, actually to blame? I'm not sure I'm
convinced. Globalization is often personified as the two twin
evils of the World Bank and the IMF. Growing up in the DC
area, the greatest irritation I felt for IMF/World Bank people
was over their diplomatic license plates which they obviously
felt gave them the right to flagrantly disregard every traffic
law known to man. But they didn't scurry around wearing little black hoods, and if they danced around bonfires at night, I,

was never aware of it.

Logorrhea logically linked to a lack of laconism
(Disclaimer: the "scientific" methods here used for
"research" and "calcula-

accurate, but are indeed
precise.)

"One's eloquence is only
demonstrated by the amplitude of one's phraseology."
In other words, using big
words is good.
We all remember applying to colleges, and it was a

"well-rounded." (The people
in the admissions office
don't read this, do they?)
We remember the tiny bit of space they gave us to fit our
essays on the Common Application. But the worst part
about the whole process was trying to make a point in the
essay while fitting in as many 15-letter adjectives as we
could. Who the hell says "quixotic," anyway?
Of all academic conventions, the idea that big words
make you more intelligent is one of the most frustrating
ones. We can't count the number of times that we've racked
our brains to search for a more fitting epithet (wow, look
who's talking, eh?) or written half-a-page-long paragraphs
reiterating the same point using different words and sen-

The truth about Ray
Dear Editor:
[Re: Truth is cubic, Phoenix, Sept. 19]
Interesting interview, yet as idiosyncratic as
Gene Ray may be, in my opinion it might have been
more enlightening for readers of the Phoenix if Kate
Duffy had asked for clarification of this selfproclaimed sage's perspectives on race and racial
mixing (e.g., his views of "race days," or "racial

slop") and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories (e.g.,
Israel and the USS Liberty) in relation to his "Time
Cube" philosophy.

tence constructions. It seems that this evil doesn't really
benefit anyone. Five-page papers could easily be threepagers, which would suit both professors who have to grade
for hours and students, who have better things to do than
spend Sunday nights buried in a thesaurus looking for
words that they have never heard of. (Did you know they
even have a big word for verbal diarrhea? "Logorrhea."
Seriously, verbal diarrhea sounds so much cooler.)
But besides these obvious reasons, we have three solid
arguments for the discontinuation of the verbal furbelow

to our second theorem. You see, the girls have had a heavy
workload this semester, filled with research papers.
Theorem number two states that the stench of Roberts is
directly proportional to the amount of work being done in
the girls' quint. Let us prove this with a simple lemma.
Word use is inversely proportional to free time. Thus, if the
girls did not work so hard at finding big words for their
papers, they would have all sorts of free time. Free time to
read books, to draw pictures and, um ... shower? There you
have it: another concrete proof that extensive vocabularies
are harmful to the environment.

3. The aforementioned verbal furbelow dictatorship has
potential harm for academia.

1 Earthlust wants you to curb your word consumption.

You know Earthlust? Those peeps with the bare feet and
reusable mugs? They have a serious point! According to our
"calculations," if you cut all your 15-letter double-barrel
adjectives to words like "big" and "cool," the average 15page paper would be reduced to 3 pages. This equates to
"exactly" 10.36 tons of paper saved per semester, meaning
we would save three hundred hectares of Amazon rainforest each year. By using the words "good" and "bad" more
often, you are in fact contributing to the fight against global warming and the melting of the ice caps. In other words,
if we stop using such big words, we can save the human race

AND feel good about driving an SUV.

2. It has come to our attention that Roberts is starting
to smell. Bad.

It seems that the smell is emanating
I mean coming
from the girls' quint (you know who you are). This leads us

We have already shown two reasons why big words are
bad for one's well-being, and the third does not fall short of
the other two. Academic endeavors are worthless to the rest
of the world if only a select few can understand them. In the
field of social sciences, academic discourse is becoming
about as understandable as Jon's slurred speech on a
Sunday morning: it's a dialect of its own. We aren't saying
that all academic discourse should be accessible to the average American, just that unnecessary use of big words is
unnecessary. And it'll probably lead to you getting your ass
kicked on that late-night train back from Philly.

Arafat's invisible constituents
constituents: the approximately 400,000
Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon and the
few hundred members of the Palestinian elite who returned
with him from exile in Tunisia.
For Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, the
number one priority is creating a Palestinian state where
they live. Arafat's second constituency, on the other hand,
feels little connection to the disputed territories and cares
much less about national struggle than about ending their
individual exiles from pre-1967 Israel. These are the people
who demand an absolute Right of Return to pre-1967 Israel
for between 3 and 5 million Palestinians, a demand which
Israel can never accept and which makes a peace accord
unreachable.
For Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, violence in
the disputed territories has immediate costs and an accord
has immediate benefits. For Palestinians in Lebanon, vionearly invisible

BY AVIVA ARON-DINE

aarondil@swarthmore.edu

At the end of the Summer 2000 Camp David negotiations, Yasir Arafat rejected a peace accord that, according
to American and Israeli negotiators, offered Palestinians a
state comprising 95 percent of the West Bank and all of the
Gaza Strip, a capital in the Palestinian areas of East
Jerusalem and financial compensation for Palestinian
refugees. Negotiations continued in Taba, Egypt, even after
the Palestinians initiated the second Intifada in September.
The Taba talks yielded proposals for greater Palestinian
territorial continuity and more complete Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem. According to Israeli participants, Arafat's own negotiators were ready to accept the
agreement when he vetoed it.
To many Israeli and American observers, Arafat's veto
was inexplicable. Why choose violence over negotiation when a
viable Palestinian state was on the
table? The sticking points, apparently, were Jerusalem and the
"Right of Return" for Palestinian
refugees. Arafat refused to accept
any agreement that did not include
total Palestinian sovereignty over

East Jerusalem and an absolute
Right of Return for all Palestinian
refugees and their descendants to
within the borders of pre-1967 Israel. He claimed that an
agreement without these provisions would be unacceptable
to his people.
This explanation seemed to make little sense. Writing in
the July/August 2002 issue of Foreign Policy, Dennis Ross,
the lead negotiator on the Middle East peace process in the
Clinton administrations, pointed out a contradiction. "If
Clinton's offer was so hard to accept, why has Arafat never
honestly portrayed it?" Ross asked. "Why not say he was
offered 97 percent, instead of Bantustans or cantons? Why
not admit he would have had Arab East Jerusalem as the
capital of the state, instead of denying that?" Most West
Bank and Gaza residents have no idea what they were
offered at Camp David or Taba because Arafat prevented
them from hearing.
During the initial phases of Oslo, Palestinian residents
of the disputed territories celebrated each Israeli with-

drawal enthusiastically. Arafat's popularity rose with each
symbol of Palestinian sovereignty he produced, making it
hard to believe that the residents of a new Palestinian state
would have turned on him.
But the residents of the West Bank and Gaza are only
Arafat's most visible constituents. Arafat has another set of

lence in the disputed territories has no costs and an
accord has uncertain, intan-

gible benefits.
The problem is that
Arafat's ties to the invisible
constituency
are
much
tighter than his ties to the

visible one. Arafat lived with
the Lebanese from the early
1970s until 1982 and with the
Tunisians from then on until
he signed the Oslo Accords. He never lived with the residents of the disputed territories; until the first Intifada, he
more or less ignored them. When Arafat returned to Gaza,
he brought with him PLO leadership from Tunis, and these
people remain the core of his inner circle. Conflict between
them and the indigenous leadership of the territories simmers quietly but continuously. Recently, the indigenous
leaders have been labeled the radical wing because of the
central role they are playing in the Intifada. But when the
peace process was going well and the Palestinian Authority
was governing territory, they were the ones viewed as mod-

erate and, above all, pragmatic.
In both the United States and Israel, many peaceniks
regarded President Bush's demand for new Palestinian
leadership not implicated in terrorism as foolish. These
critics may well be right that Israel and the United States
should work with whatever Palestinian leadership currently exists. But those who call for new leaders also have
a point, albeit not the one they are usually making. If
Arafat's successors are indigenous to the West Bank and
Gaza, they will not be uncompromised by terror. But they
may be more willing to compromise, and, ultimately, that
may be what matters.

Men's rugby
squad grabs
its first win
BY KATE NELSON-LEE
knelson2@swarthmore.edu
It's two games into the fall season, and the
Evil Buzzards are l-l putting them in fourth
place in Division 111 of the Eastern
Pennsylvania Rugby Union. The Buzzards
opened their season by dropping a hard-fought
match vs. No. 1 Franklin & Marshall in
Lancaster,
PA
dominating
before
Susquehanna 24-5 this past weekend.
"We're very happy with our results so
far." Brett Klukan 'O3 said. "We have a good
chance of being up in the pack at the end of
the season."
Saturday, the Susquehanna squad showed
up with a scant 16 players. Considering both
the rough nature of the sport and the fact that
a team must field 15 players at a time,
Susquehanna was sorely outmanned by the
superior Swarthmore squad.

"We would've beaten them
by a lot more if we had
played out the game."

Garnet fall to Blue Jays
BY JIM DALTON

jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
The men's soccer team tasted defeat
in its first Centennial Conference
matchup last Saturday. Under the lights
in Baltimore, the Tide lost 4-0 to nation-

ally-ranked Johns Hopkins University,
falling to 4-3-1 on the season. The Blue
Jays of Johns Hopkins improved to 2-0
in the Centennial Conference and 6-1

overall.
With the win, the Blue Jays, who are
currently first in the conference standings, continued their dominance over the
Garnet Tide, extending their winning

streak to nine straight victories over
Swarthmore. During the streak, the Blue
Jays have outscored the Garnet 42-L
This time around, the Tide tried to

keep the Blue Jays in check with a lowpressure defensive strategy, whose goal
is to counterattack after forcing the
opponent to play the long ball. Although
the Tide were able to use the strategy to
their advantage in the first 25 minutes of
play, Hopkins dominated the rest of the
half, storming to a quick 3-0 advantage.
"We were able to execute Coach's
game plan for the first 25 minutes," goalkeeper Reuben Heyman-Kantor 'O6 said.
"They were trying to play over the top,
which played into our hands, although
they did have a lot of corner kicks.
"The first goal for them was huge,"
he added. "I played too far off the line

18

and made the mistake on the first goal.
But after that, the defense let up a little
and they were able to build upon their
lead going into the half."

"I think the team
acknowledges that
our opponents
were good."
Nick Graham 'O6
Adam Hack ignited the Blue Jays'
lightning attack, notching the critical
first goal in the 25th minute with a shot
from 40 yards out that blazed past
Heyman-Kantor. Four minutes later,
Chad Tarabolous headed a cross to Matt
Leßouf, who scored to put the Blue Jays
up 2-0. Edmond Wybaillie tallied a goal
of his own in the 40th minute of play to
give Johns Hopkins a commanding 3-0
halftime lead.

After a positive but stern halftime
talk from head coach Eric Wagner, the
Garnet Tide settled things down defensively in the second half. The offense, on
the other hand, struggled to get just two
shots on goal in the half. They were outshot 18-3 by the Blue Jays, with 13-0 corner kick advantage going to Johns
Hopkins. Chad Tarabolous added a goal

for the Jays' final score in the 65th
minute, an uncontested header that
capped a 4-0 win for Johns Hopkins.
Starting as goalkeeper for the Tide,
Heyman-Kantor recorded 10 saves in the
net. His 21 saves for the week earned
him a spot on the week's Centennial
Conference Honor Roll. "I feel like I'm
still learning a lot," he said. "I still see a
lot of improvement. I give a lot of credit
to Andy Hoopes, the assistant coach, for
working with both Nathan [Shupe 'os]
and me and helping us improve. With
Nathan it's been great competition thus
far and we're definitely going to get a lot
better pushing each other over the next
three years."
Despite the crushing loss, the Garnet
Tide are optimistic heading into their
game against non-conference opponent.
"I thought we performed at a reason-

able level for much of the game, especially for a team starting so many freshman against a nationally ranked team,"
midfielder Nick Graham 'O6 said. "All in
all, I thought we performed well in the
first 25 minutes of the first half, up until
they scored, and for much of the second
half. I think the team acknowledges that
our opponents were good and, if anything, is willing to work harder in order
to compete with them next year and to
make the most of our remaining fixtures. Personally, I think we will come
back strong on Wednesday and crush
Neumann."

was forced to forfeit after four of their players
were sidelined with injuries. John Fombonne
'O5 and John Turcick 'O5 separated the shoulders of two Susquehann players, Erik Munroe
'O4 broke another player's collar bone, and
Brian Hwang 'O5 broke another's finger.
"Some teams, like Albright are really out
there to hurt people," Munroe said, "but we
were just out there playing hard. It's unfortunate that happened, but I guess it's part of the

game."
As the half went on, the Evil Buzzards piled
on more and more points on Susquehanna, so

they were disappointed the game had to end
prematurely. "We would've beaten them by a
lot more if we had played out the game," wing
Matt Block 'O5 said.
"We just played a really good game, and we
were more fit then they were," Klukan added.
Four different Buzzards scored tries in the
match, including Zak Gelachek 'O3, Brant
Rakowski 'O6, Axel Neff 'O3 and Fombonne.
The Buzzards were especially impressed by
the play of Rakowski, considering the team
lost several solid players to graduation,
including Ted Chan 'O2 and Pablo Montagues
'O2. "Brant's a promising young freshman,"
Randy Goldstein 'O5 said.

The players cited the squad's new scrum

machine as a key part of their training this
semester. Fortunately for the club, Athletic
Director Bob Williams found a way for the college to pay for the pricey piece of equipment so
as not to drain the club's funds.
Next up for the Evil Buzzards is Saturday's
home game against rival Albright University.
When the two teams matched up last spring,

alleged dirty play by Albright spurred a
bench-clearing brawl that prompted a number
of suspensions by the EPRU. This time
around, the head of the EPRU will be personally officiating in a measure to discourage a
repeat performance.
Albright is currently 0-2 on the young season. The Buzzards are fired up to take them on
their home field and are hoping for a large
Swarthmore fan base to help urge them on.

Paced by co-captain Meg

pummeled Elms 5-1 and Vassar 30 to capture a third-place finish in

Conference
Woodworth fully credits the team
for her amazing individual performance. "Each goal was a team
effort, a result of each player on
the field having an attack mentality," Woodworth said. "It was
exciting to see our hard work pay
off in the circle."
"Meg Woodworth and Lindsay
Van Sciver ['o3] were incredible
sparks on attack, and many
underclassmen stepped it up in

the midfield and forward line
when it was needed," head coach
Kelly Wilcox added.
Woodworth, who started playing field hockey in seventh grade,
considers herself lucky to include
year's
this
Seven

Tournament performance among
her memorable field hockey
moments. "I thank God for the
experiences I've had. I've been
part of some wonderful teams,
including an undefeated team my
freshman year in high school and

the Independent School League
champions of '99 my senior year,"
she said. "I'm thankful to have

made some great friendships and
fun memories while learning a lot
about hard work and team building."

While Woodworth enjoyed success at Seven Sisters, unfortunately one of her four-year teammates had to sit and cheer on the
sidelines. The team was without
the skilled play of four-year
starter and co-captain Ingrid
Kaszas 'O3, who is sidelined for a
month with a stress fracture,
according to coach Wilcox. "We
certainly missed the leadership
and skilled play of Ingrid Kaszas,"
Wilcox said. "Her skills were
made for the type of surface we
played on up there."
Despite the loss of one of its co-

captains, Swarthmore managed
to roll over Elms College.
Woodworth knocked in three
goals for her first career hat trick,
HelenLeitner 'O4 added a goal and
an assist, and Chelsea Ferrell 'O5
notched her first career goal to
lead the Tide to a 5-1 win in the
first round of the tournament.

The Tide dominated the game
offensively and defensively, outshooting Elms College 35-20.
Goalkeepers Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3
and Jenn Hart 'O3 shared duties in
the net to allow just one goal in
the win. "The team played very

well overall. There were stretches
where everything just clicked. It
was very exciting to watch and be
a part of," Wilcox said.
In the second round, the Tide
faced Mt. Holyoke. After playing
to a 1-1 draw in the first half, Mt.
Holyoke tacked on four goals in
the second half to secure a 5-1 victory. "We came out strong against
Mt. Holyoke, Kasia Koziol-Dube
scoring the first goal of the
game," Woodworth said. "They
were a great team, which they
proved as they went on to win the
tournament. They capitalized on

Garnet Tide top Goucher 2-0 to
end three-game losing streak
BY DEBBIE FARRELLY

After snapping a disheartening three-game losing
streak, the Swarthmore women's soccer team improved its
record to 5-4 this past week.
Regarding the recent string of losses, head coach Amy
Brunner remarked, "I think it was a combination of factors. We were beginning to play tougher teams, academic
pressures were starting in, and we may have lost some
focus. There are a lot of different people on the team, and
the boat was rocking a bit, but we have stabilized it."
"I think our losing streak was a lack of intensity, heart
and togetherness in our play. We are all extremely supportive of each other on and off the field, but we just couldn't get things to click in the past couple of games," added
captain Katey McCaffrey 'O4, who scored her first goal of
the season in last Saturday's game against Goucher, which
Swarthmore won 2-0 to break the losing streak.
On Wednesday, the Garnet Tide took on the Green
Terror of McDaniel College (formerly Western Maryland).
Swarthmore came out slow in the first half and struggled
to keep up with the Terror's aggressive play. Catherine
Salussolia 'O4 helped to make up for Swarthmore's initial
lack of intensity with 12 saves in goal. Despite Salussolia's
efforts, McDaniel's Laura Cavey put her team on the board

in the 34th minute of play with a goal from the baseline.
Swarthmore came out revived in the second half, dominating the flow of the game. "We had many more shots on
goal after the half, particularly in the last 10 minutes of the
game," Salussolia said. A beautiful pass from Lauren Kett
'O5 to Shavaugn Lewis 'O5 tied the score at one, eventually
sending the game into overtime.
"In overtime we came out strong, we just were not able
to finish," Salussolia said. The teams battled for seven
minutes of sudden death overtime, before a deflection off
of a Swarthmore defender was converted to a goal by
McDaniel's Niki Lepson.
"It was really disappointing," Brunner said, "because
we are the better team. We outplayed them. We just didn't
win when we really wanted it."
Saturday's game versus Goucher College proved much
more successful as the Garnet Tide emerged with a 2-0 victory. The game started off with a quick Swarthmore scoring opportunity and numerous runs down the field. During
one of these runs, McCaffrey lost her defender and
received a pass in the open field down the left wing, facing
only the sweeper. In a play referred to by coach Brunner as
"a highlight reel," McCaffrey maneuvered the ball around
the sweeper's legs and pounded it into the upper left corner
of the goal. "I don't get a chance to score very often, so it
felt great to get that goal," McCaffrey said.

Elms 5-1 and defeated Vassar 3-0
to finish the tournament in third
place with a 2-1 record. Pg. 19.

Swarthmore maintained control of the game into the
second half, with many close looks at goals. "Julia [Smith
'o6] and Shavaugn [Lewis 'os] launched a couple ofbeautiful shots that their keeper just made nice saves on,"
Brunner said. The second goal of the game came off a
thread from Lewis to forward Stephanie Chapell 'O5, who
blasted the ball past two Goucher defensive players and
the keeper, sealing the 2-0 victory for the Garnet Tide.
"The cool thing about the game was that we all went in
motivated to win because of the losing streak, and everybody, from the starters to the people coming off the bench,
had a chance to contribute," Sarah Hobbs 'O6 said.
Women's soccer looks ahead to away games against
Franklin and Marshall and Gettysburg this Wednesday
and Saturday, respectively. The matchup against Franklin
and Marshall will be sure to pose a challenge for the
Garnet Tide, who have not beaten the Diplomats in two
years. "We are very evenly matched with [them] and we
are really hoping to pull this one out," Brunner said.
Saturday's match-up with powerhouse Gettysburg will be
another test of Swat's strength; the Bullets are currently
ranked third in the region and 17th in the nation.
"[The games] are going to be tough for us, but I love to
come in as the underdog, especially when the other team
has no idea how much better we are this year," McCaffrey
said. "We have nothing to lose."
