Contest to be mascot attracts seven potential phoenixes
BY MATT BLEI MAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

A competition will be held this weekend to choose the
first students to become Swarthmore's new official mascot.
The public event will be held this Saturday at 7 p.m. on the
main stage of LPAC.
Mascot Selection Committee member and Coordinator of
Residential Life Liz Derickson 'Ol explained that it was necessary for the competition to be open to the public. "We felt
like with the spirit of Swarthmore we should let it be an
open event and let anyone audition. Some places do closed
and private auditions but that did not feel like Swat," she
said. She said that it is not hard to get students at
Swarthmore to come out and participate in events like these.

"That's why I am trying out to
show Swat pride and give every
Swattie a chance to come laugh at
me as I make a fool of myself on
Saturday. Sweet."
Anna Baeth 'O9
Derickson said that the auditions are the final stage of the

two and a half year process that the Mascot Selection
Committee has gone through.
"It's full steam ahead. We are really ready to have a mascot on this campus and the last step is getting actual students
on board," she said.
There will be three sections to the show: a talent section,
an athletics section and a pep section. In the talent section,
contestants will be able to do anything they want and are
expected to perform a variety of talents.
After this, they will have to navigate a timed obstacle
course with contestants weaving through cones, jumping
over hurdles and doing star jumps among other feats.

NEWS

Finally, the pep section will give the contestants a
chance to bring in any of their own props and perform to
their own music completely non-verbally, as the mascot will
be mute.
Kyle White 'OB and Claire Melin 'OB will be the emcees for
the contest and the show will feature two guest performances by campus groups. Sixteen Feet will be performing twice
during the show and Rhythm N Motion will perform as well.
The selection committee is still working out who will be
on the judging panel. The panel will consist of Registrar
Martin Warner, Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal, two students who have not yet been announced
and assistant track and field coach Tom Reynolds, a former
mascot.

Another judge will be Dave Raymond, the original Philly
Phanatic who helped construct and first wore the suit for the
Philadelphia Phillies. He now owns a creative marketing
firm and helped construct and market Swarthmore's new
mascot. In addition, there will be two student judges who
have yet to be announced.
The selection committee is offering a reward for anyone
willing to try-out to become the mascot. "For even just signing up and getting the chance to perform they are getting gift
certificates to their choice of either Pei Wei, Target,
Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts," White said.
After the open try-out on Saturday, the committee will
hold a closed-door try-out on Sunday. White said that
Saturday's event is more of a preliminary try-out.
There then will be finalists selected to take part in
Sunday's audition. "Sunday is going to be a blind audition
with the contestants actually dressing up in the suit and performing a list of activities because we don't want to have the
bias of seeing someone we might have seen the night before

and have that influence our decision," White said.
The committee will be selecting more than one mascot.
"What we are really trying to emphasize with people is that
there is going to be a big team aspect to it. We are going to
have more that one mascot because we realize that the person that is filling the suit is going to have a time commitment somewhere else," White said.
He hopes to pick two or three final mascots. In addition
to the mascots, there will be a mascot team that will be mod-

The team will be headed by a mascot coordinator who will

assist the mascot and make sure he or she has any necessary
props or items for the performance. White is looking forward
to being the emcee at the try-out. "This is very exciting. It has
been a two and a half year process and it's nice to see this
finally transform into reality," he said. "The show is going to
be a lot offun. It's going to be crazy, ridiculous some of the
talents that I have seen so far are off the wall."
Derickson is also very excited about the try-outs. "Every
time you get a novel, new event it draws a lot of attention and
excitement," she said. "I think there is some buzz and I hope
a lot ofstudents will turn out. I think folks will be vocal about

the candidates and the costume."
The current contestants are Juliana Macri 'O9, Melissa

Grigsby 'O9, Alex Gilbert-Bono 'lO, Anna Baeth 'O9, Finlay
Logan 'OB, Dan Hodson 'O9 and Joel Tolliver 10.
Baeth agrees about the excitement for the mascot. "I think

I mean,
we are some of the brightest, compassionate, funniest and
strangest group of people around, but don't really demonstrate it externally. The phoenix will help us do that."
She sees the opportunity to participate in this new feature
of the college as something to promote Swarthmore pride and
have fun. She said, "We could all use a good laugh every now
and then. I suppose that's why I am trying out
to show
Swat pride and give every Swattie a chance to come laugh at
me as I make a fool of myself on Saturday. Sweet."

Alumni connect with students
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore. edu
Most Swarthmore students share a certain apprehension about life after graduation. Thankfully, most of them manage just
fine in the real world, with a little guidance
from the alumni network. The Alumni
Council, a group of alums who help
strengthen student-alumni connections

and help current students think about their
post-college lives, is in the process of
expanding its outreach to students.

While few students are well-informed
about the Alumni Council, it has existed for
over 70 years, serving the college in various
ways. Every Swarthmore alum automatically becomes a member of the Alumni
Association, which was started in 1882. In
1937, the AlumniCouncil emerged out of the
Association as a leadership team. Council
members are elected by the Association,
serve three-year terms and meet on campus
twice a year once in the spring and again
in the fall.
The Council is comprised of three
branches, each ofwhich pursues a different
objective: Alumni Support, College Support
and the Student Support Working Group.
Alumni Support organizes get-togethers in
various geographic regions across the
nation and the world. College Support handles administrative affairs. The purpose of
the Student Support Working Group,
arguably the most relevant for current students, is, according to a documentfrom the
Alumni Council workbook provided by
Alumni Relations Associate Director
Astrid Devaney, to "develop initiatives
which promote connections between students and alumni with the objective of providing support and guidance to students."
While most people know that the
Alumni Council works with Career
Services to place students in externship
programs, the Support Group also helps
with the study abroad program, social
and
responsibility
initiatives
student/alumni connections in general.
According to

Alumni Council member

Amy Knowlton 'B7, the Student Support
group helps organize a dinner each time to

gives an opportunity for students and
alums to meet. "Historically, these dinners

have focused on careers
students would

many different fields and career paths,"
Knowlton said in an e-mail
For the first time ever, the Alumni
Council Student Support group will be collaborating with the Lang Center for Civic
and Social Responsibility to organize a dinner on April 5. The dinner will center on
the theme of civic and socialresponsibility,
and students will have to the chance to
speak with alumni who are involved in that
field. A panel of speakers will discuss how
they have incorporated civic and social
responsibility into their work and post-college lives and how their activities at
Swarthmore led them to their current
activities.
According to Knowlton, who is organizing the event, the dinner will feature
themed tables, including categories like
nonprofit and health. "Students and alums
will sit at the tables according to their
interests and experience, and have further
opportunity for discussion," she said.
Devaney, one of two Alumni Relations
Office staff assigned to working with the
Alumni Council's Student Support Group,
said that the Saturday dinner is a great way
for students to connect with alumni.

According

Support Group has become increasingly

dents over the last ten years. "I think
Swat's always been good at connecting students with alumni, and this can always be
improved on, but I think the current
Council wants to connect with students on
campus," Devaney said.
The current president of the Alumni
Council, Kevin Quigley '74, is looking forward to the upcoming dinner. "It's a great
opportunity," he said. "Typically we get 50
or so alumni and 75 to 90, maybe 100 students. It's just a chance to connect and talk
a little bit about common interests and values and talk a little bit about the world after
Swarthmore and what are the kinds of
opportunities out there for students."
According to Quigley, over the past few
years, organizations such as Earthlust,
NOLArize, Genocide Intervention Network
and War News Radio have made presentations that have been "rewarding, inspiring
and motivating."
Quigley, who is also the president of the
National Peace Corps Association, comes to
the college eight to nine times a year and is
always struck by how students don't have
much of a sense of the alumni community,
despite there being what he describes as a
"natural network" for students.
"[Alums] share a lot of values [with students], a lot of similar outlooks about the
world, and one of the things that we all find
very rewarding is to be a resource for students, a resource about careers ... there are
18,000 of us who've been privileged to have
the Swarthmore experience, and I do think
we have a lot of commonality," he said.
The Alumni Council has contributed to
the Swarthmore community not only as
part of their efforts to connect students
withalums, but also through other types of
initiatives. According to Assistant Director
of the Alumni Relations Nathan Stazewski,
the Alumni Council was responsible for initiating the Web site where audio recordings
of faculty lectures are posted, making them
accessible to anyone.
The recordings are available in podcast
form. The podcast is downloaded 1,400
times per month on average and gives
alumni another way to keep in touch with
school affairs, in addition to reading The
Phoenix and the Daily Gazette, paying
attention to the college Web site, participating in connection and extern/intern events,
etc. "There are a lot of ways to stay connected," Quigley said, "but the best by far is
to get on campus and reconnect with stu-

dents."

Apart from planning the spring dinner,
the members of the Alumni Council hope to
connect with students through academic
departments, according to Student Council
Education Policy Representative Elisha
Ann 'OB, who acts as a liaison between
Student Council and the Alumni Council
and communicates with them through

e-mail. "They plan to coordinate mixers in
departments that already have mixers,
such as PoliSci and Bio, so they would
invite alumni who've majored in bio so students can connect that way," Ann said.

The Alumni Council also works with
the Career Services office. One of the major
achievements of their collaboration so far
has been the expansive alumni database
available to students on the Career
Services website. After registering, stu-

dents can search alumni by occupation and
geographic location. "It's up to the students
[to use these resources]
alums can reach

a resource out there for me, let me tap into
it," Quigley said.

Sager fund turns 20 with 'Boundaries of Queer'
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swarthmore.edu

This weekend, the annual Sager
Symposium returns to campus with a
schedule of nine events ranging from the
workshop "The Gender-Free Orgasm" to
the lecture "Dancing with Death: Black
Queer Identities and Popular Music in the
age of HIV/AIDS." The 2008 Symposium is
especially notable because it marks the
20th anniversary of the Sager Fund, which
was started in 1988 by Richard Sager '73.
Staying true to this year's theme of
"The Boundaries of Queer," the symposium explores the existence or lack thereof
of the racial, sexual, cultural and political
lines often drawn when discussing queer
issues. The theme came about from the
Symposium Committee's desire to examine
the definition of queer.
"When we were throwing out ideas at
the beginning about what we wanted the
Symposium to be about, we asked ourselves in the queer community what it
queer,"
Symposium
means to be

co-head Tatiana Cozzarelli 'OB
said. "There is a political element [to being
can you be queer and straight? Is
queer]
is it
being queer all about your desires
about who you desire and what you desire?
And where do politics fit in? So the theme
came out of that. What are the boundaries
of queer and what does queer mean? How
do gender, sexuality, race and class intersect, and can they all fit into the word
Committee

'queer?'"

Pulling from Every Edge of Campus
As has been the case in recent years, the
organizing
the
Sager
committee
Symposium is comprised entirely of students. That is not to say, however, that they
are alone in their efforts to plan the symposium. Rather, they have received help

from various administrative offices, academic departments and student groups on
campus. The symposium is co-sponsored
by a total of 25 such offices and organizations at Swarthmore. While the Sager Fund
gives significant financial backing to the

symposium, the symposium also receives

additional funds from some of its co-sponsors.
The diversity of the co-sponsors, which
includes groups such as the Department of
Sociology and Anthropology, the Office of
Multicultural Affairs and the Swarthmore
Queer Union, hint at the multifaceted
appeal of this year's symposium. Efforts
have also been made to bring in speakers
that interest different parts of campus.
According to Cozzarelli, the diversity of
the Sager's co-sponsors and speakers is key

THE PHOENIX

to the Symposium. "In terms of our speakers' cultural groups, we have one black,
two South Asians, two Latinos, some
whites, one transsexual and some people

who are both female and male identified.
We really have a diverse group of speakers,
so we can go to all the cultural groups and
say, 'Queer identities and queer people are
in your cultures, and here are a group of
people who can speak to that,'" Cozzarelli
said.
Changes through the Decades
The 2008 Sager Symposium also marks
the 20th anniversary of the Sager Fund and
the 19th anniversary of its related
Symposium. According to Cozzarelli, gender and sexuality issues were rarely discussed at the time of the Fund's inception.
"Twenty years ago, Sager was the only
one of its kind talking about LGBT issues
and funded by a major institution. At that
time, engaging in gay sex was still illegal in
a lot of states. In that time, people were not
really talking about LGBT issues, especially in institutionalized ways," Cozzarelli
said.
While the anniversary lends itself to
discussion about the progress that
Swarthmore and the nation has made on
queer issues in the past two decades, it also
opens up debate about the amount of
ground that still needs to be covered,
Both Cozzarelli and fellow Symposium
Committee co-head Matthew Armstead 'OB,
for instances, would like to see a greater
integration of queer issues into the academic side of Swarthmore. According to
Cozzarelli, the college needs more classes
on queer issues and increased efforts to
hire queer faculty.

Armstead echoed Cozzarelli's concerns.

"There is no central curriculum for queer

studies on campus," he said.

.

Alumni Outreach
To reflect the changes that have
occurred in the past 20 years, both on the
college campus and in the country, this
year's Symposium will once again include
a dinner with an alumni panel discussing
the participants' experiences as queer students at Swarthmore in the past. According
to Cozzarelli, the panel will include alums
from as far back as the 1960s to as recent as
the current decade. Utilizing Swarthmore's
alumni resources have been a key goal for
the Symposium Committee this year.
"We made a huge effort to reach out to
alums. We started this last year, and I think
it goes along with this idea of commemorating the past and of remembering our
history, of remembering queer people on
campus," Cozzarelli said.

Armstead said that it has often been difficult to connect with alumni in the queer
community. "The Sager Symposium is not
only an event, but also a queer alumni
reunion," he said. "It is there not only for
alumni and students to network, but for
them to see how their experiences after
are affected by their
graduation
Swarthmore experience. It gives people
context for queer life at Swarthmore and
its evolution."
One such alum is Katrina Clark 'O3.
Clark, who will be participating on the
alumni panel, recalls Swarthmore's attitude towards queer issues while she was a
student at the college.
"On the one hand, I would say that
Swarthmore was a little more liberal than
the country, in a sense, in terms of being
willing to talk about the issues," she said.
"But there was definitely a denial of some
of the things that went on, of kind of wanting to brush things under the carpet."
Clark particularly recalled several hate
crimes that occurred during her first year
at Swarthmore. "There was an incident
that happened on the end of my hall in
Mertz where one student was deliberately
called a name on a bathroom wall," she
said. "The hallmate was harassed and followed on campus. When we went to the
deans about it, it seemed like they didn't
necessarily want to get involved."
According to Clark, the deans then told
them that they didn't feel as if anything too
severe had occurred. "My hallmate's girlfriend's boards [on her door] got burned.
What exactly has to happen for you to feel
that something serious is happening?"

Clark asked.
Clark took two years off between her
sophomore and junior years of college, and
she remembers that noticeable changes
occurred during these times. "Over the
entire six year period, there were definitely changes," she said. "Just the number of
people who were out increased. People of
color who were out were greatly increased.
I didn't feel like there was anyone else my
freshman year. Sophomore year there were
a few more, and when I came back my junior year, I felt like there was a community
of people."
By lending her voice to the alumni
panel, Clark hopes to gives students a

broader outlook on queer issues. "I think
perspective is really important
When
you're living at Swarthmore, people always
describe it as living in bubble. It's hard to
see things on a continuum of time, and it
feels like everything's big right then and
right there. Stepping back and seeing
things on a timeline gives a perspective
that helps guide you," she said.

March 27., 2008

...

Ending with a Bang
Perhaps the most widely anticipated
component of the Symposium is the

Genderfuck

Genderfuck party that closes the weekend.
Originally named Genderfuck because of
Sager's aim to raise questions about the concept of gender and its constraints, the party
has since grown into an infamous

Swarthmore traditionand has deviated a bit
from its original intent.
"The idea is that men wear women's
clothes and women wear mens' clothes. But
it's a Genderfuck party, not a 'boys wear
dress, girls wear less' party. It goes along
with this idea of queerness, and of transgressing the boundaries of how you perform
your gender," Cozzarelli said.
According to Armstead, in the past there
was "almost always a celebratory party
attached to the Sager Symposium" that, at
times
when faculty organized the
Symposium, often took place at their homes.
However, the Genderfuck component to the
party has not always been an element of the
celebration.
As with last year, Genderfuck will be
spread out across three separate parties in
Olde Club, DU and the WRC. Tying into the
overall theme for the Symposium, the theme
for the party this year is "Sex Through the

Ages."
"We wanted to have something that gibed
with the theme of the Symposium. We
thought about boundaries of time and
boundaries of place. You can go from the
past to the present to the future in one
evening by traveling to three parties," Party
Committee co-head Andrew Owens 'OB said.
Owens described the three sites of the
party as encompassing sex in the past, present and future. DU will represent the ancient
world while Olde Club will highlight the
iconic sex scenes currently around the
world. The WRC will look into the future
with visions of how sex may be portrayed
decades or centuries from now.
"The first floor of Olde Club will have a
darker, Eastern European theme. The lower
level will be red light district themed,"
Owens said.

Owens also stressed the versatility of the
party, saying that it should be enjoyable for
everyone at the college, whether or not they
wish to adhere to the unofficial and infamous rule of "guys wear dress, girls wear
less."

"I've been here three years, I think the
party is a lot offun no matter what you come
in," Owens said. "I've always had fun with
it. There will be some people going very wild
and some who are not. I think this speaks to
the Swarthmore ethos in general of being
what you're comfortable with. We want
everyone to come and have fun."

APIA month celebrates diversity of Asian identities
In addition to hosting events, of which all but one are
open to the entire campus community, SAO views APIA

BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarhmore. edu

Asian Pacific Islander/American Heritage Month, officially celebrated by the U.S. in the month of May, began at
the tailend ofMULTi week with a workshop by Carmen Van
Kerckhove on interracial dating. Events scheduled throughout the month, including a workshop on ethnic studies led
by Toby Wu 'O9 and a performance piece by NealDandade 'O6
entitled "Mango Chutney on Mesa Street," aim to raise
awareness of issues pertaining to the Asian Pacific

Islander/American

experience.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau Web site, APIA
Heritage Month, also known as Asian/Pacific American
(APA) Heritage Month, was first officially recognized as APA
Heritage Week in 1978. It was not until 1992 that Congress
expanded the original weeklong observance to a month-long

celebration.

"I'm really interested in the racial
integration of Asian-Americans in
America, where race activism is
sometimes equated in the
mainstream as black activism."
Sonia Lee
Visiting professor of history
Although APIA Heritage Month is officially recognized
in May, celebration of the month on campus was modified to
March/April to better accommodate the exam schedules of
students and to ensure that as many people as possible from
both APIA and non-APIA communities would be able to
attend the events, according to Swarthmore Asian
Organization President Arthur Chyan 10.
"The main goal [of APIA Heritage Month] is to increase
awareness about the communities which we call the Asian,
Pacific Islander, Asian-American and Pacific IslanderAmerican communities. Who makes up those communities
is decided by individuals
we ask each student to define for
themselves whether or not they relate to these communities," he said.

Heritage Month as an opportunity to supplement the
resources of academic departments like Asian Studies,
Black Studies and Latin American Studies, according to
SAO IC Intern AndreaPien 'OB. "It's basically a chance to use
our interests and share it with the campus," Pien said.
Yesterday's event, a workshop directed by History
Professor Sonia Lee, discussed how Asians fit into the
black/white binary of racial relations in the U.S.
"I'm really interested in the racial integration of AsianAmericans in America, where race activism is sometimes
equated in the mainstream as black activism," Pien said.
"I've talked to many Asian-Americans, most [of them] not
students on campus
about how they identify with students of color, so that's definitely something I wanted to
examine more closely," she said.
The workshop on Asians in the black/white U.S. racial
binary echoes a broader theme implicit in the month's programs: the omission of the Asian/Asian-American Diaspora
community in the national dialogue surrounding people of
...

color and minority groups. "I really hope that [APIA

Heritage Month] will just make people think more critically
about the role that Asian/Asian-Americans play in the
United States. They're often a very overlooked group when
issues of race and color are discussed," Pien said.
Another event that SAO members are eagerly anticipating is the Stir-Friday Night! sketch comedy and improv performance. According to SAO Co-Publicity Chair Xiaoxia
Zhuang 'lO, Stir-Friday Night! is an all-Asian comedy group
that addresses issues relevant to the Asian/Asian-American
experience as well as negative stereotype associated with
these communities.
"I'm looking forward to Stir-Friday Night! because they

American group and are very aware of their [Asian] identity and translate that into humor," Zhuang said.
"I think that they're really coolbecause I feel like Asianness often doesn't equal coolness in mainstream American
culture," Pien said. "They're really funny to everyone and
not just to AsianAmericans."
In addition to these events, there will also be a Spoken
Word performance, a Folk music performing duo called
Good Asian Drivers and a first-time alumni panel co-sponsored with Deshi.

According to Laszlo, good business is green business
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Chris Laszlo 'BO, the keynote speaker at this year's

Jonathan R. Lax '7l Conference on Entrepreneurship,
spoke with Phoenix reporter Mary Prager 'll about his
upcoming speech, the business of sustainability and his
motivation for embarking on this particular career path.
Laszlo is the co-founder of Sustainable Value Partners, a
firm focusing on training executives at companies and
business schools worldwide on "sustainability for business advantage."
After his undergraduate studies at Swarthmore and
graduate studies at Columbia University, Laszlo worked
first for a bank on Wall Street and then for a consulting
firm before eventually moving on to a major multinational company.

"The marketplace has changed and
today if you want to make an
economic profit you have to pay
attention to environmental and
social issues in your business."
Chris Laszlo 'BO
Co-founder, Sustainable Value
Partners
After about 15 years of working in a series of traditional corporate jobs, Laszlo began to notice in the late
1990s that some of the environmental and social issues he
felt strongly about were becoming priced in the market.
Essentially, he came to the conclusion that it was not
possible for companies to ignore the environmentally
damaging consequences of industrial productivity
the
externalities, in economics jargon
and he became
increasingly aware of growing pressure on companies to
be more cognizant of their impact on water, air and soil

quality.

MP: How did you get into the business of sustainability?
CL: Well, I had been interested in environmental and
social issues back in high school, and certainly when I
was at Swat these topics were covered.
Many of the topics around emerging-country poverty
and some of the environmental issues were beginning to
emerge and at the time, it seemed like if I wanted to have
a good career and go into business, I would have to abandon the social and environmental interest and agendas
that I had in my studies, so that's what I initially did.
MP: So did your experiences in college and various jobs help you in writing your book?
("Sustainable Value: How the World's Leading
Companies Are Doing Well by Doing Good," Island
Press, 2003)
CL: It was around the late 1990s that I started saying,
"Well, there's actually an opportunity here to help companies to address these environmental and social issues
not as an ethical agenda but as a business agenda."
MP: What brings you back to Swat to talk about
this? How did you get involved with the conference?
CL: Someone recommended me to a search committee
for the Jonathan Lax Conference this year, probably
because of the book I'm delighted to be coming back to
campus. I mean, I've been back a number of times since
then, but to be coming back and talking on this topic is
certainly something that I'm delighted to have the opportunity to do.
MP: Do you expect to talk to students afterwards,
with particular student groups that are environment or business oriented?
...

~

CL: I think both environmentalists and business-oriented students should find this interesting because those
that are looking at this from an environmental perspective will be interested to see how business is thinking
about this, and students that are in the entrepreneurs'
club or wanting to go on from Swarthmore to get a business education will be interested to see how the environmental and social issues are putting pressure on and
offering more opportunities for business to compete.

named Milton Friedman who in the
1970s said that the only social responsibility of companies is to make a profit. In the 90s, there was lots of talk
about social responsibility, with the Exxon Valdez spill
and other disasters, and when "sustainability" was formally defined by the United Nations. Saffron said that in
his opinion, Friedman was right: business has no other
social responsibility than to make a profit. That's what
the institution is set up for. It creates wealth and jobs,
and you can't ask more from business than that.
What I've come to realize [despite being shocked at
the time] is that Bernie Saffron and Milton were right
after all. It's not about having three separate targets. It's
not about having economic profit, social responsibility
and environmental responsibility.

"Why are we suddenly seeing global

business leaders talking about

Chris Laszlo 'BO
Co-founder, Sustainable Value

What has happened is that the marketplace has
changed and today if you want to make an economic profit you have to pay attention to environmental and social
issues in your business
because they've become
enablers of competitive advantage. So we're back jto just
a single purpose gain. So companies have come out with
products that have environmental intelligence built in.
Consumers tend to prefer those products if they don't
have to pay more for them.
There are lots of new markets for clean energy, hybrid
cars, organic foods, biodegradable products, cosmetics
that don't contain salates or parabens and toys that don't
have leads. Suddenly the public has become very sensitized to environmental, health and social issues. There
was a period when I resisted this idea but now I think
it's right. In today's economic environment, companies
that do good also do well.

It's going from a specialty niche to larger business

they do business. A lot of my talk [centers] around this:
why are we suddenly seeing global business leaders talking about [sustainability]? Is this just a fad?
When I was in college, when you thought about business you thought, "Do I have to choose between doing
good or doing well?" Quakers have historically excluded
many types of business based on the idea that some businesses aren't doing the right thing.
Now we see that you don't have to choose between
making a profit and being socially responsible, and why
we don't have to is the topic of my talk.

Oster on empowerment of women's rights in India
The Economics department hosted a lecture by Professor
Emily Oster of the University of Chicago on Monday in
which she spoke about her recent research on gender
inequalities in India. The lecture, entitled "Gender
Inequality in India and the Power of TV," focused on the
current state ofwomen's rights in India and the surprising

-

cable has on female autonomy.
Oster is the author of numerous publications, including
"Hepatitis B and the Case of the Missing Women," published in the Journal ofPolitical Economy as well as "The
Power of TV: Cable Television and Women's Status in
India," the paper on which this talk was based, which was
co-written with Rob Jensen ofBrown University. Phoenix
reporter Hannah Purkey recently sat down with Oster to
discuss the current status of women in India and the possible effects of cable on this status.

effect that

Hannah Purkey: What is the general situation of
gender equality in India at the moment?
Emily Oster: I think that there are at least two
aspects of this that are important: one is the issue that
people are more familiar with about gender imbalances
in population, that there are more men than you would

acceptable. In these surveys, when you look at answers to
questions like who decides about you obtaining health
care, whether you want to go to the doctor, about 25 percent of women say that they decide on their own, 25 percent say that they decide that jointly with their husband,
and 50 percent say that someone else, their husband or
their parent-in-law, makes those decisions.
There are similar results with questions like are you
allowed to go out by yourself or do you keep your own
money. So these kinds of decision-making things also
tended to show what looks like women who are restricted
in their movements. The other thing that I find really
striking is when you ask people about spousal abuse, ask
women, if it is acceptable for a husband to beat his wife if
she does x, y or z, 60 percent say that there is some situation where that is acceptable. For example, if she neglects
the children, 30 percent say its okay, if she goes out without telling her husband, another 30 percent say its okay.
That kind of thing I find very striking because it doesn't
get talked about as much, but it feels like it is almost as
bad as these excessive mortalities. It affects people everyday; all the time you have these discriminations.
HP: Has the government tried to intervene and fix
any of these issues?
EO: The Indian government would love to change
these things, but it is really hard to alter these things.
Part of what makes our study about TV a little surprising
is that we actually see effects of TV on gender. This is surprising given that the government has tried to do many
different things. They tried to tell people that you should

expect based on other countries. It looks like women and
girls are dying at higher rates than you would expect
based on natural processes and that probably has to do
with discrimination, particularly in childhood with food
or vaccines or other kinds of inputs. In the end, you have
a population that has more men than you would expect.
That's been exacerbated to some extent by sex selective
abortion, which has become more and more common.
The other thing, which people talk less about but is

really value your daughter, it didn't seem to have any
effect. They tried to pay people to have daughters, which
also had no effect. They tried to outlaw dowries, but people just ignored them.
So there is a real effort to try to affect these things. I
think people understand
that this is a problem,

still a big issue, is that there is a fair amount of discrimination in terms of restricting what women can do and
also to some extent spousal abuse and what's deemed

attitudes, not as much behaviors, things like son preference and attitudes toward beating. So we think it could be
some of these changes of behavior are driven by changes
in attitude.
HP: What about TV do you think changes gender

roles?
EO: I think that the intuition we have, and again it is
a little hard to prove that this is the mechanism, is that
these people are in rural areas and what is on TV tends
to be shows that depict urban areas. The shows are not
about how women should be liberated, they are just soap
operas, but they are showing environments where
women are going to have more rights and more of these
kinds of behaviors like going out without telling our husband. Things like that are going to be much more typical.
You never see any spousal beatings, it's actually not
allowed to be shown, and girls will be enrolled in school.
There is going to be differences here so I think that
one way to think about it is that you have a peer group
that you have in your village, which before TV was the
only people you interacted with and those are the guys
that I get all of my ideas from about what is acceptable.
Then suddenly I turn on the TV and there is this whole
other peer group, who you now identify with to some
extent. The new attitudes you have are instead of being
the same as everyone around you are going to be some
average of everyone around you and also what you are
seeing on TV.
HP: So the opinions of local peers still have a large
effect on gender roles?
EO: Yeah, one way to look at it is that TV shows you
urban areas, which tend to be more favorable towards
women. So one way you can ask the question of how big
are the effects is how much of the way between your rural
areas and the urban area you get moved by having TV,
and that's about 40 percent. This is a big effect but not 100
percent. The rural areas look more like the urban by 40
percent but not completely, which suggest that you are
still getting some weight on what people around you are
doing and what you have done in the past
HP: Is it possible that the types of people getting
TVs are just more modern and therefore more progressive with women's rights?
EO: That is a concern. What we do is we have village
level variation of TV. So you don't get TV, your village
gets TV. The way we actually try to identify these effects
is by looking at villages that change their cable TV status
over the period that we observe them.
We see them three years in a row, so we have some villages that always have TV, some villages that get TV
between the first and the second survey round, some that
get it between the second and third and some people that
never get TV.
We look to see whether the changes in these attitudes
are timed with the changes in cable. We look at whether
the guys that get cable between first and second round
changed their attitudes between round one and two; if the
guys who got cable between two and three changed their
attitudes between rounds two and three and whether we
see changes in their attitude between rounds one and
two.

With tension mounting in China, the Dalai
Lama's scheduled visit to the University of Michigan next
month has taken on new significance.
The Dalai Lama is slated to deliver a lecture called
"Engaging Wisdom and Compassion" at Crisler Arena
April 19 and 20.
The Chinese government has accused Tenzin Gyatso,
the 14th Dalai Lama and spiritual leader of Tibetan
Buddhists, of inciting the recent wave ofanti-Chinese violence in Tibet.
As host of the 2008 Olympic games, China is in the
international spotlight and coming under fire from the
United States, Britain and other countries for using force
against the Tibetan protestors.
The Chinese government, which has controlled the
region of Tibet since 1951, claims that 19 protesters have
been killed as a result of the protests, but aides close to the
Dalai Lama say the toll is closer to 130.
Gyatso, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and promoter of
nonviolence, told media sources yesterday that he might
resign his post if "things get out of control."

"[The situation in Tibet] will be on
everyone's mind, and it's on his
mind, too, so he will talk about it."
Gelek Rimpoche
Founder & Spiritual Leader, Jewel
Heart
In light of recent Tibetan protests calling for independence from China, his upcoming speech would likely garner more international attention. But some fear that it
might not happen at all.
Prof. Mary Gallagher, the interim director of the
Center for Chinese Studies, said the conflict might force

izations.
Reverend Beverly Dale of Penn's Christian Association
called the bill "morally indefensible."
"For me, it's like kicking someone when they're down,"
Dale said. "What is the need for it? It's shameless."
Executive director of Equality Advocates Pennsylvania
Stacey Sobel, who is also a law school lecturer, said her
organization deals with hundreds of unmarried families
each year who need help, including heterosexual couples
who have chosen not to marry, because they aren't offered
the same benefits as married couples.

"It's critical that all families are treated the same in

Tobias Wolff, a Penn Law professor, spoke against the
bill at a Senate Judiciary hearing.
Wolffs testimony focused on the interstate implications of provisions limiting same-sex marriages in civil
unions.
Wolff also said he opposed a constitutional amendment
that limits the rights of a particular segment of the population.

"We shouldn't be writing inequality into our constitution," he said.
Supporters of the bill, like Diane Gramley, president of
the American Family Association of Pennsylvania, say
they just want to "bring the issue before the people."
Gramley said the ban must extend to civil unions as
well as same-sex marriages to prevent same-sex couples
from using "civil unions as a stepping stone to get homosexual marriages legalized."
THE PHOENIX

"There's a lot of things that are happening that make it
more important that the Dalai Lama is somewhere else,"
she said.
But Gelek Rimpoche, the founder and spiritual leader
of Jewel Heart, the organization bringing the Dalai Lama
to Ann Arbor, said he believes the Dalai Lama will honor
his speaking engagement and come to the University.

"There's a lot of things that are
happening that make it more
important that the Dalai Lama is

somewhere else."
Mary Gallagher
Interm Director, Center for
Chinese Studies
According to the Tibetan government's Web site, he is
also scheduled to speak in Seattle, Wash, in early April.
Rimpoche said he expects the Dalai Lama to discuss
the current situation in Tibet when he comes to the
University to speak. "It will be on everyone's mind, and
it's on his mind, too, so he will talk about it," he said.
Rimpoche said the Dalai Lama would likely reiterate
his demands for the Chinese government to give Tibetans
greater autonomy, like freedom of religion.
Gallagher said the Dalai Lama's speech at the university would be an ideal forum for him to express his views
on the situation in Tibet. The Dalai Lama has provoked a
reaction from the Chinese government speaking before
American government officials, she said, but at the
University, he can reach a wide audience without worrying about political ramifications.

The Dalai Lama has called the current situation in
Tibet a cultural genocide, but Gallagher said it's possible
that circumstances could "change dramatically" in the
weeks before the Dalai Lama comes to campus.

Police use 'Facebook' event to arrest for underage drinking
BY ANDY STEINKE

MINNESOTA DAILY (U. MINNESOTA)
(U-WIRE)
Cottage Grove police ticketed 12 teenagers
earlier this month for underage drinking after receiving
anonymous tips, relating to a Facebook announcement of
the house party they were attending.
In January, 17 high school students in Eden Prairie and
Woodbury were disciplined by school officials after
Facebook pictures of their drinking escapades came to light.

"If a student comes into our office

and isn't forthcoming with things,
we can look at Facebook and show
them that [their profile] isn't
matching up with what they said."
Amy Barness
U. Minn Assistant Director for Student
Conduct and Academic Integrity
Many police departments and school administrators
around the country have been using Facebook pictures and
wall posts to ticket students and levy suspensions. So who's
looking at your Facebook profile?
The University Police Department occasionally uses
Facebook in its investigations, Deputy Chief Steve Johnson
said.

University police investigators used Facebook last spring
after first-year student Kyle Sharbonno fell to his death from
the Oak Street parking ramp, Johnson said.
"The investigators looked up parties and things he was
involved in on Facebook," he said. Now, two older students
stand charged with providing the alcohol to Sharbonno that
ultimately led to his death.
The department generally uses the Web site as a way to
contact someone by finding a home address or another
phone number, University Police Lt. Chuck Miner said.
"Other campus departments look for parties going on at
their schools," he said. "That's not what we use it for at all."
Facebook has been used at least once, however, to find
associates of captured criminals in cases involving more
than one suspect, Miner said.
When a student breaks the Student Conduct Code
which covers areas such as scholastic dishonesty, theft and
violation of federal or state laws University police will
refer the case to the University's Office for Student Conduct
and Academic Integrity for further review.
Amy Barsness, assistant director in the office, said the
office doesn't actively look at Facebook profiles to charge
students, but it does use the Web site to provide context
when talking with students.
"If a student comes into our office and isn't forthcoming
with things, we can look at Facebook and show them that
[their profile] isn't matching up with what they said,"
Barsness said.
Because the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity
office is for education development, Facebook is generally
used to gain insight into the student's life, she said.
If a student requests a hearing for his or her case to determine if he or she has broken the Student Conduct Code,
Facebook pictures could be used, Barsness said.

"There have been no cases that [Facebook pictures] have
been used for that I know of," Barsness said. "They are public information; anyone can see them. So theoretically they
could be used."
Finance and marketing sophomore Sveta Gitelzon said
she was in a management lecture last semester learning
about the Internet as public domain when her teacher surprised students with the last few slides of his PowerPoint
presentation.

"As an example, he talked about Facebook and put up
pictures from people in the class," she said.
The teacher had created a Facebook account and copied
and pasted pictures of some ofhis students drinking into his
PowerPoint slides.

The students who hadn't increased their profile's privacy settings were susceptible to the teacher's search,
Gitelzon said, reinforcing that if a teacher could access the
pictures, a prospective employer could feasibly do so as
well.

Doug Kampe, an adjunct professor in the Carlson School
said learning experiences like these are
great because they aren't just textbook concepts; they
impact the students personally.

The death of cinema?

cartoon

by

work

For anyone who has
taken Intro to Film, the
name Laura Mulvey may

induce either an intellectual orgasm or a gag reflex to
profundities of film theory.
While I always wrestle
with how to study film in a
substantive, relevant way,
I still have the former reaction. I read Mulvey's cornerstone

ALEX HO
Critical Mass Media

1975

essay

"Visual Pleasure and
Narrative Cinema" in that
intro course while I was
gradually becoming cognizant of how film could be

approached from a psychoanalytical perspective as evidence of our base human impulses towards pleasure. 30 years later, Mulvey has come out
with a new book "Death 24X a Second" that approaches film
as a contradictory fusion oflife and death, a haunted illusion
of liveliness constructed from utterly dead units, still photographs demarcating time that can never be retrieved. In celebration of Mulvey's month-long residency at UPenn (or perhaps as a cop-out for this column since I already have to read
her book for a class, take your pick), I thought I would talk
about Mulvey's meditations on this apparently inherent
deathliness of film in relation to today's media landscape.
Amidst the book's huge range of ideas, the argument that
I found most fascinating was Mulvey's take on our current
digital era. Mulvey says that, pre-digital, the death and stillness always implicit in film was nonetheless elusive since a
film could only be viewed as projected at 24 frames per second. With the introduction of VHS, DVD and now Internet
video, cinema can willfully be paused and manipulated, giving greater consciousness to the still photographs that make
up film. For Mulvey, the nature of film spectatorship in
today's world changes from reveling in the fleeting present to
incessantly harkening back to the past. The observation

made me think about the bottomless resource that is
YouTube. I can watch an interview with Leslie Cheung, who
committed suicide in 2003 or watch any number offan videos
that remix films and repeatedly mull over the time when
they were shot. The effect is a compulsion to consume as
much of the past as possible.
Mulvey notes that the beginnings of cinema coincided
with the movement of Spiritualism that was infatuated with
new technology's uncanny ability to bring the dead to life
through magic shows, zoetropes and finally film. Similarly,
the new digital age has a haunted eeriness about it. In particular, I'm thinking about J-horror, which may just act as a
commentary of our media-driven world. Admittedly, I know
little about J-horror beyond its crappy American variations,
but for Gore Verbinski's "The Ring" and now the film
"Shutter," videos and photos are objects of menace. The
interesting reading of "The Ring" made by many critics was
that it was really indicting the avant-garde embodied by the
fatal video. Is "The Ring" then Hollywood's manifested anxiety over the death of the good old-fashioned narrative film?
There's also something lifeless about digital media.
Digital effects and post-production filters trying to pass as
shrewd cinematography ultimately detract from the visceral
potential of films and were the main problems I had with
recent fantasy films and graphic novel adaptations. These
films have more in common with animation, constructed in
an almost painterly manner. Another recent essay of
Mulvey's titled "The Clumsy Sublime" (which I snagged offof
Professor Bob Rehak's blog) talks about the oddly impossible
space created by a technique called rear projection that melded shots of actors with separate background shots, as in
Marion's guilty drive to the Bates Motel in "Psycho." Mulvey
discusses how these shots were so fascinating because they
were so visibly artificial. The computer-generated effects of
hardly clumsy as they have
today are the exact opposite
been streamlined to perfection, and far from sublime.
The history of film has always been a futile attempt to
recreate and reanimate life, and now that we've reached an
age where technology is no longer susceptible to the aging of
celluloid or clumsiness of claymation, the result is more lifeless than ever before. Maybe cinema is dead after all.

Yo La Tengo to head Worthstock
BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS
azalokol@swarthmore.edu

Though both low, hushed murmurs in McCabe and
overtly loud, leaning-across-the-table-type mouthstretching bellows in Sharpies have been passing the
name "Yo La Tengo" between chattering lips for a while,
it was only this week that the Large-Scale Event
Committee officially announced that the highly prolific,
greatly respected, critically acclaimed and universally
loved New Jersey based indie rock band would be headlining this year's Worthstock.
Though Worthstock is, for this year only, going to feature a total offive musical acts in addition to the winner
of Swarthmore's Battle of the Bands, the only other
group that has been confirmed thus far is Blue Method.

Since the announcement was made public, students

who are familiar with Yo La Tengo's work and reputation
in the music sphere have responded with nothing short
of effusive enthusiasm. "I am so excited about Yo La
Tengo coming," Dan Symonds 11 said. "They're the
greatest live performance I've ever seen. [When] I saw
them play at Prospect Park, they played uninterrupted
for three hours straight without making a single mistake."
"They're truly incredible musicians," Symonds
added. "Their sound is so distinct
the melodies are
good, the production is excellent, they have a very clever
use of electronics and noise and the composition [of their
songs] is great. I think [Yo La Tengo] is perfect for
Worthstock because, like I said, they put on the best per-

formance I've ever seen, and they play a lot of really good
covers they reinterpret songs and do something interesting with them to make them their own. I think that
even people who don't normally like Yo La Tengo will be
surprised by how good they are live."
According to LSE committee member Stephanie
Sampedro 'O9, the committee chose to book Yo La Tengo
was part of an effort to throw a more rock-oriented
spring event in order to balance out last semester's hiphop centered event: "We had looked at a variety of different groups that play a variety of different types of music,
March 27, 2008

but after having had a hip-hop act in the fall, we decided
to balance things out by looking into a more indie rock
group for our headliner. We had thrown around a number of ideas before finally bringing up Yo La Tengo, an
oldie but a goodie, for our headliner."
Blue Method was chosen to play at Worthstock,
according to LSE committee chair Emily Sun 'O9,
because of how successful they have been at Swarthmore
in the past.

"I think [Yo La Tengo] is perfect for
Worthstock
Even people who
don't normally like Yo La Tengo will
be surprised by how
good they are live."
Dan Symonds 'll
...

"Students have really liked them when they've played
here before, so we decided to bring them back again,"
Sun said.
"Not everyone, I suppose, will be happy with [these
choices]," Sampedro added, "but we did our best to satisfy the many musical tastes at Swat with both LSEs this
year. Not all of the groups we have planned for
Worthstock are similar to Yo La Tengo, so we're confident that every Swattie will find something they enjoy."
Though the remaining three groups have not yet been
announced, the committee has already decided upon who
they would like to bring to join Yo La Tengo and Blue
Method. "We already know who we want," Sun said,
"We're currently in negotiations [with the other three
bands] trying to make the offers work out." Sun added
that students should expect the other three musical acts
to be, relatively, much smaller, but that they were chosen
with the goal of putting together a musically diverse lineup in mind.

he is driving a rental truck. This is something
he has never done before; he informs me distractedly before apologizing several times and
hanging up. When he calls later, he sounds
more relaxed, since his sculptures have been
picked up and he has made it safely out of the
threatening vehicle. For someone who has an
entire weekend named after him, Sager seems
remarkably down-to-earth. This is evident in
his reaction to the "actual age" of the Sager
Symposium.
"Holy shit!" he says, "Has it really been 20
years?"

According to Sager, the idea for one of
Swarthmore's most well known institutions
actually occurred in a very prosaic manner
about 25 years ago. Heavily involved in San
Diego's queer community. Sager noticed that
there were no institutions to protect queer
assets in the long term. He first turned his
attention to his alma mater, where the queer
community was relatively young.

"I believe significant history
has been created, and [the
institution] is constantly
changing over the years,

He explains that he wanted the committee to
have independence and did not want to control

the subject matter and other minutiae of the
symposium. Sager is happy to offer suggestions

when he is asked for them, but otherwise
prefers not to interfere.
"My goal really was to help fund something
that would have some lasting impact. I take no
credit for the symposium. I believe significant
history has been created, and [the institution]
is constantly changing over the years, over
time/' Sager said.
Another source of happiness for Sager is
that, as time as passed, Swarthmore alums'
experiences with the symposium have inspired
them and others to donate to the Sager fund.
"It makes me feel really good to see people
coming together to make that happen," he said.
Sager has attended the symposium almost
every year. While he has enjoyed all the symposiums, the two that stick out in his memory
are a lecture from Vito Russo, author of "The
Celluloid Closet" and a speech by Dan Savage.
Another exhibit that Sager remembers was a
display of Artistic Responses to HIV AIDS,
which elicited an emotional response.
"There are so many amazing and talented
people associated with this event, and it has
everything from speakers on very specific topics to many more pop culture events," Sager
said.

"I remembered that Swarthmore had a good
reputation for managing its endowments, and
then I noticed that although LGBT student
organizations existed on campus, there were no
specific funds available to them," Sager said,
"They couldn't have visiting lecturers or anything like that."
Sager decided to put aside a queer-centric
fund for Swarthmore and got in contact with
Ken Landis '4B and Gene Lang '3B. Landis and
Sager worked together and came up with the
first draft of what would become the Sager
fund. However, they soon became aware of one
crucial problem.
"We realized that the funds were restricted,"
Sager explains and then laughs, "Before any
money could be dedicated, I would have to die!"
He then considered creating an annual fund.
The idea took two years' worth of cross country
visits and conversations to come to fruition,

Caligula, Roman emperor 37-41 BCE
Named after the boots worn by Roman soldiers,
Caligula is portrayed by historians as being wildly
decadent and perhaps legitimately insane. In 40 BCE,
he purportedly began dressing as a variety of figures
from the Roman pantheon, including the goddess of
love, Venus. With his palace as his personal whorel
house, Caligula is rumored to have slept with
countless women, as well as his three sisters.
And, when his palace became too confining,
Caligula possessed two ornate "pleasure boats"
on which to indulge his desires.

The Marquis de Sade, libertine and philosopher
1740-1814
The inspiration behind the word "sadism," the
Marquis de Sade dedicated the majority of his life to committing luridly violent affairs with male and female prostitutes and members of the French nobility. During the
late 18th century French Republic, Sade wrote a host of
explicitly pornographic novels that blended graphic sex
with pseudo-philosophical social commentary. Since
their publication, these works have been scrutinized,
criticized and praised by psychoanalysts and feminists

alike.

With his palace as his personal

Greta Garbo, actress 1905-1990
Born in Sweden, Garbo became a Hollywood success
after starring in silent films with racy titles and subject
matter to match. In 1933, she played the role of the cross-

dressing Swedish Queen Christina. Much like the Queen
Christina portrayed in the film, Garbo was strong-willed,
enjoyed cross-dressing and pursued relationships with
both men and women. Her longest relationship was with
the Cuban-American poet, Mercedes de Acosta. Although
Garbo was very reclusive for much of her later life, her
inscrutable beauty is still famous today.

Recycled Runway
series, having finished its fourth season, has inspired a huge
following even within the Swarthmore bubble.
With the last season over, Kitao Board member
EveLampenfeld 'OB found a way to cure PR withdrawal and
promote awareness about how carelessly we throw out
reusable items every day. Last Friday, March 21, Recycled
Runway, hosted by the Kitao Board in the Kitao Gallery,
encouraged students to use their creativity in a Project
Runway-like competition creating fashion out of recycled

items.
With this project, Lampenfeld combined her passion for
fashion with her interest in sustainability. Her directed
reading on sustainability inspired her to plan an event that
was both fun and thatwould spread awareness. Lampenfeld
added her own new spin onto Project Runway to combine
two interests that intrigued many who decided to participate. "I guess I wanted people to be more aware of what

they're throwing away," Lampenfeld said.
The Kitao Board, also the judges for Recycled Runway,
collected wire, newspapers, food wrappers, cardboard, and
scrap fabric from the costume shop to provide supplies for
creating eco-friendly couture fashion.
All the contestants were fashionably late, but when
everyone arrived, the competition began with a bang. Much
like Project Runway, the competitors were allowed three
minutes to gather their materials from the giant pile of recycled materials. Instead of dilemmas over whether or not to
use light-washed or dark-washed denim, the competitors had
to choose between newspaper and plastic bags.
Accompanied by upbeat music, contestants scrambled
to collect anything and everything including newspapers,
chocolate wrappers, plastic bags, bubble wrap, water bottles
and fabric. The frenzy was crazed but all in good spirits.
The contestants, who split into four groups, had an hour
and a half to design creative garments for themselves or a
teammate to model down the runway. Assisted by duct tape,
scissors, permanent markers and creative minds, the groups
quickly "made it work."
Prizes were awarded for the Most Creative Recyclers, the

March 27, 2008

Most Drastic recyclers, the Recyclers who had the most fun
and the Grand Prize. The winners received assortments of
snacks always a good idea for hungry college students.
Considering the dismal pile of scraps of plastic bags and
newspapers, I expected no more than a newspaper dress
shoddily duct-taped around a body. However, many audience
members came for the runway show with exclamations of
"ooh" and "wow" and rightfully so. Some would call the

pieces absolutely fierce.
One set of outfits that involved toga-like wraps of fabric
with capes and metal wire headband begged some explanation. Nemo Swift 'll, one of the two outfit models, said he
drew his inspiration from other artists. "The aesthetic influence I generally have in my head is Michel Gondry [whose
work] generally inspires me" Swift said as he went on to
describe the theme as being "mystical and plutonian."
Among the other designer clothing were a halter top
dress and a strapless dresses made with scrap fabric accompanied by unique hats. The two dresses, one more haute couture and one more commercial, were very different but two
of the most impressive works of the evening. The first dress
was made of a three tiered skirt made of newspapers, cut in
strips for volume, with a plastic bag train. Crinkled paper
and tape made for some environmentally friendly earrings.
On the front of the dress, the "American flag is superimposed on a crane disaster," explained designer Blaine
O'Neill. The theme of the piece was "Disastrous America."
The other dress was a tube-dress with paper ruffle edges

on top with a braided fabric strap that held up the dress in
an innovative way. "We're currently inspired by water,"
Laura Rainey 'O9 said, while Ayanna Johnson 'O9 added
"because water is a resource that is constantly recycled."
The Recycled Runway show was successful in providing
students with an opportunity to piece stylishly piece together outfits with materials normally found in a recycling bin,
which is usually only done during Halloween and Screw.
Auf wiedersehen, until the fifth season of Project Runway
begins. Until then, R stands not only for Runway, but for

Gao Xinjian's play The Other Shore' opens
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

CROSSWORD

BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

What is "The Other Shore" about? After spending an
afternoon with the cast and crew of this spring's Theater
Department Production Ensemble, I can't say I'm entirely
sure. The play first struck me as inscrutably about everything and about nothing at once. But that might just be
because of the play's convoluted origins.
To begin, "The Other Shore" is one of the works of Gao
Xingjian, a Chinese expatriate living in France who
gained worldwide recognition when he received the 2000

Nobel Prize in Literature. His play "The Other Shore"
was written in 1986 during the rising tensions over free
press and free speech that would eventually bre-ak out at
the Tiananmen Square protests. Gao's plays were soon

blacklisted, the Beijing production of his play was abandoned and he fled for France. Gao's works are still
banned in China.

But "The Other Shore" is not the brash indictment of
communism that one might imagine. One of the cast
members, Miriam Rich 'll, said, "I think a lot of the play
is the tension between the collectivism of the crowd and
the individual."
She added, however, "It's not a black and white thing,
where it's like the crowd is bad or the individual is bad."

Gao has described his works as decidedly apolitical, stating in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech "The Case For
Literature" that "if ideology unites with power and is

transformed into a real force then both literature and the
individual will be destroyed."
Cast member Chris Klanieki 'lO described Gao's
approach to drama as "different from Stanislovsky
different from Brecht," which, in a way, flies against both
Beijing opera traditions and the socialist realism that
pervaded Mao-era theater. Instead, the play's most obvious influence is perhaps French absurdism. Judging
from my vain attempts to get a summary of the play from
any of the cast and crew, "The Other Shore" eludes anything that remotely resembles a plot. Its endless procession of disjointed episodes seems, at times, to be straight
out of a David Lynch movie.
The production's director, visiting professor Kym
Moore, proposed one interpretation of the play. "It's literally a meditation, and the events that occur are events
that are thoughts," she said.
In "The Case for Literature," Gao says, "Literature
transcends national boundaries," and Gao himself is certainly an international figure. It's fitting, then, that this
week's production of "The Other Shore" is so culturally
non-specific and disorienting. The play's nine actors performing in natural, non-inflected English are nonetheless dressed in earthy 1960s era Chinese socialist garb as
created by costume designer Marsha Ginsberg.
Also added into the mix are even more nonsensicalities on the production's sound design by Nick Kourtides.
When a wayward woman, played by Sasha Shahidi 'O9 ,is
hauled away by the play's frighteningly stupid mob, we
...

inexplicably hear the Talking Heads' 80s New Wave song
"Once in a Lifetime." Old Ritz Crackers commercials precede the entrance of a charismatic businessman marketing dog skin plaster medicine to the fickle crowd mem-

bers.
Moore explained that these juxtapositions were incorporated to recontexualize the play's themes for American

culture.
"What we've done with the sound a lot is to layer in
is akin to a
how commercialism in the United States
totalitarian entity," Moore said. "In the same way that
China may be a communist society and [have] a totalitarian government, what is totalitarian [in the United
States] is consumer culture."

"The Other Shore" was originally intended by Gao to
be an exercise tool for actors, and for the cast it posed a
lot of challenges that they had yet to encounter in their
theater careers. Isa St. Clair 'll said, "A lot of what we
have done has sort of challenged the way that I think a
lot of us have learned about theater and really asked us
to come up with a completely new way of being in a show
and of actuating a character." Gao's unique approach to
acting, which forced actors to be conscious of their performance as they were on the stage, placed the cast in
roles they would never have imagined playing.

"I think a lot of the play Is the tension between the collectivism of
the crowd and the individual."
Miriam Rich 'll
Cast Member

Just as the play wrestles with collectivism, the actors
similarly had to work heavily on working as an ensemble. To prepare, the cast engaged in many group exercise
that Nell Bang-Jensen 'll said, "has just made us incredibly aware of each other and how we all move."
"It's been an interesting challenge because of the col-

laborative effort," Shahidi said. "There are times where
our director is telling us what to do, and there are times
where it's just like, 'Create this scene using your bodies
in ten minutes. Go.' It's been a really good way for us to
become an ensemble."
The sparse set
a sole giant disk with several trapdoors
shifts the theatricality of the play onto the
actor's shoulders. Assistant director Lauren Dubowski
'OB said, "There's lots of lights and lots of sound, but the
set itself is kind of like a playground for the actors." The
play's performance so heavily employs movement that
Moore enlisted Joanna Wright 'OB, a theater and dance
major, to choreograph the play.
Ultimately, for Moore, "The Other Shore" is heavily

rooted in the Buddhist philosophy of coming to terms
with yourself and your predicament. "We can't escape

commercials and dictators
all of that is mixed in with
what the world is
but we can learn to live with it and
to get to a place of peace within ourselves about it,"
Moore said. "Basically, there is no other shore."
"The Other Shore" opens tonight in the LPAC Frear
Ensemble Theater from 8 p.m. -10:30 p.m. It will also run
Friday, 4:30 7 p.m. and Saturday, 8 p.m. -10:30 p.m.
...

Each actor took on a.number of roles, including, for
Rich, "Young Man," and, for Klanieki, "Old Woman."
Rich said, "It's very different from what you think of as
usual Western theater, where you're trying to be a realistic representation of the character, whereas here it's
like a very stylized, demonstrative character."

"intelligent
traveling":
at the time, I

lot know what the language was, what currency people used, how to say "yes" or "no," whether it was part of
the EU or even where to locate the country on a map. I am
so embarrassed that my fingers are blushing as they type

this.
Like most of my traveling last fall, this trip was impulsive, last-minute and not planned by me. I blame the
accessibility and convenience of train travel.
Early Saturday morning I scraped myself out of bed at
8 or 9 a.m. and headed over to Keleti palyaudvar,
Budapest's East Station. Counter-intuitively, trains leav-

ing the East station head west; the South station, east
;and the West station to destinations within the country,
which are primarily located in the south. Ignorant as I
was of geography, the irony was lost on me at the time.
We arrived in Ljubljana at 4:30 p.m. Thanks to the
grim Eastern European winter that had sunk its claws
into the continent on exactly Oct. 3L it was already
impenetrably black (incidentally, I never managed to see
the city in daylight). Nonetheless, with the speed and

skill possessed only by savannah cats and hungry college
students who have eaten nothing all day save bread and
spread cheese, we zeroed in on the center of town and its

delicious food and drink.

According to Wikipedia, that most reputable of
sources (and nationalist propaganda organ!), Ljubljana is
the "cultural, scientific, economic, political and administrative center of Slovenia!" The emphasis is my own. This
illustrates one of the convenient aspects of small countries.

Like most of my traveling last fall,
this trip was impulsive, last-minute
and not planned by me. I blame
the accessibility and convenience
of train travel.
Apparently it is also known for its bus system, which
we had the pleasure of exploring in depth on our second
day. The plan was to go hiking in Bled, a picturesque
town about an hour and a half away famous primarily for
an unbelievably beautiful abbey perched on an island in
the middle of a lake and the formidable castle overlooking it. Good idea, right? We purchased tickets, found our
and were thwarted by the bus
bus, attempted to board
driver. Self-assured and convinced that we had a better
grasp on the situation than any transportation authority,
we flashed our tickets and mimed, "Look, we have tickets
...

already!"

"Tickets!" he mimed back.
"We have tickets!" We responded.
"You need tickets!" He mimed back.
He even went so far as to bring out a clipboard and
write some prices on it, to which I responded by writing
more prices. Like I said, we already had tickets.
Convinced either by my stunning logic, by my pigheadedness or by the impending departure of the bus, he

grudgingly let us aboard. This was tricky and lulled us
into a false sense of security, for when we arrived at our
destination, the driver disembarked with us.
Before we had fully mustered our collective miming
talents to resolve the problem, one of the many foreigners
also on the bus came to our aid by pointing out that in our
infinite wisdom, we had in fact purchased train tickets. If
this weren't humiliating enough, though, every other foreigner who followed him off the bus glanced at our tickets, nodded and agreed that they were really for the train.
Thank you Canadian brothers, Japanese tour group, Irish
university students and random Italian couple.
We apologized profusely, salvaged as much of our dignity as was possible and made our way to the lake. Most
of the day was spent exploring farmland behind the castle, admiring naked apple trees and making the acquaintance of a cow with particularly overzealous saliva
glands.
Shortly after the sun had given up at around 4:06 p.m.,
we clambered onto the bus home, this time equipped with
appropriate tickets and, surprisingly, the company of the
same Canadian brothers who had shamelessly mocked us
earlier in the day. Aided by my endless resources of
charm and the fact that I was the only one on the bus who
was feeling chatty, I made their acquaintances and got us
invited to the Coolest Hostel in Slovenia: Hostel Celica,
formerly a prison. You can actually pay a lot of money to
sleep in a refurbished cell, which I think says a great deal
about the predilections of the Euro-traveling hostel
crowd. Illustrious characters we met there included a
five-foot German woman with brilliantly purple winestained teeth and a bad sense of balance, a sober Kiwi globetrotter who smooched her and a thirty-five-year old
Californian who still lived at home (only ocasionally taking breaks to spend his parents' money traveling) and
couldn't understand why his parents were sick of him.
Instead, I opted for another highlight of budget Eurotraveling: the 2:30 a.m. train back to Budapest. I arrived
home 36 hours after I had left, or exactly in time for math

class.

It's hard to watch HBO at Swarthmore. I
know this from firsthand experience: I
haven't yet found a television set that
receives the channel and the official HBO
online video player doesn't work with Apple
computers (which, given that Macs are vastly superior to anything even remotely connected with Microsoft, remains a mystery). I
realize that HBO is a subscription channel
that doesn't sell ads and therefore can only
make money from those who pay to receive
the channel, but I don't think it would kill
them to sell episodes on iTunes.
It was, therefore, with much impatience
that I waited for the chance to return home
for Spring Break and, snacks and remote
close at hand, spend an entire day catching
up on the final season of HBO's ground-

breaking drama "The Wire."
Many

critics have called "The Wire" the

show digs deep into its subject matter, is the
best on the airwaves.
For those of you who didn't read any critic's top-10 lists in the last five or so years,
"The Wire" is a drama that deals with the
daily struggles of the Baltimore Police

year. The focus of season five was the media
more specifically, the Baltimore Sun
and its relationship with the police department and the mayor's office. The portrayal
of dishonest reporters and the decline of the
print newspaper were compelling. The
scenes set in the Sun's offices also gave time
to an issue dear to my heart: the public's fascinationwith grotesquerie and train wrecks,
encapsulated in the reporters' slogan: "If it
bleeds, it leads."
"The Wire" benefits not only from the
consistently wonderful writing that allows
the show to explore such themes without
seeming like homework; it also has one of
the best (and certainly the most diverse)
ensemble casts on television. Every charac-

ter on the show is fully fleshed out, and there
are far too many wonderful parts for me to
talk about even a small fraction. So, I'll leave
you with an example of the kind of impact
that "The Wire" has on its viewers, and the
way in which the audience was able to connect with the characters. Midway through
this season, fan favorite Omar Little
(Michael K. Williams), a vigilante who stole
money from drug dealers and killed them if
they acted out of line, was gunned down in a
convenience
store. The next week,

Little were just as real as Arthur C. Clarke.

Indie band White Rabbits gets Olde Club hoppin'

Swarfhmore's very own toy band I Saw the

Creature opened up Saturday's Olde Club
performance on a familiar note of offbeat
Stephanie
beauty and wistful whimsy
Duncan 'OB, Nick Forrest 'OB and Bizzy
Hemphill 'OB played old favorites to an intimate crowd of friends and fans who sang
along, cheered them on and were, by the
end, sad to see them go. While the stony
space of Olde Club flittered with people, I
Saw the Bloodied Snow endearingly inspirited the crowd and left everyone wanting to
hear more. Always a Swarthmore favorite,
the band's contingent group of fans was, as
usual, singing along as they closed their set
with "En Basiant," a song of twinkling exuberance and chiming prettiness.
Though I Saw the Bloodied Snow did not
return for an encore and instead left their
fans with a promise to come back soon,
Philadelphia-based indie rock swing band
Jotto returned to Olde Club's stage for the
second week in a row after The Teeth, who
were originally scheduled to open for White
Rabbits, cancelled at the last minute. Jotto,
now having reached the status of familiar
territory at Olde Club, was eagerly greeted
with warm cheers of recognition, appreciative applause and the kind offriendly smiles
reserved for moments of mutual gratitude.
Whirling through songs with clattering, jangly guitars, emphatically pattering synth

keys and rumbling percussion, Jotto played
off of the crowd's enthusiasm and kept the
energy level high throughout their entire
set; both returning fans and newcomers
enjoyed the band's danceable, restless, softly clashing music. "Jotto was really fun.
The front man and lead singer, [Aaron], had
really great stage antics," JeffSloan 'O9 said.
"He had this almost animalistic stage presence that I really liked."
While the audience swayed, clapped and
stomped along to Jotto's own songs, it was
their upbeat, clattering, electronic cover of
"Stand By Me" that truly got everyone in
Olde Club excited about the music. "The
keyboardist, [Matt], is one of the real talents
in the band, and so it was nice to see the

spotlight all on the keyboardist when they
covered 'Stand By Me,'" added Sloan.
Following Jotto's intimate performance,

White Rabbits took the stage as Olde Club
for a show that was intensely rhythmic,
sweepingly ornamental, fluttering with
multiple layers of trembling riffs and sinking into catchy hooks. Starting off by playing "While We Go Dancing" early on in
their set, White Rabbits got the room moving early on with a song full of rippling keyboard, insistently pounding drums, reverberating guitars and a fun, jaunty beat.
Plunging into their hit "The Plot," the band
kept the rhythm going with the song's dramatic percussion, tinkering, staccato piano
and thumping guitar before tapping out a
new song for the crowd that was received
warmly and enthusiastically.
Strumming out a version of "Maggie's
Farm" and ultimately ending with "Kid On
My Shoulders," White Rabbits topped off

their performance in a flurry of pattering
drums, crescendoing keyboard, headrush
sonics and twirling layers of rumbling harmonies. "I thought ['Kid On My Shoulders']
was fantastic," Madalyn Baldanzi 'OB said
about the ending. "It built very well and
was perfectly aggressive in its execution."
Though the performance fellflat at times
and the crowd's interest and engagement
occasionally faltered, White Rabbitsput on a

solid performance of fun, youthful and
danceable indie rock. Old fans of the band
enjoyed seeing themperform a good balance

highlighted on the PMA's website as providing, "a unique perspective of one of the twentieth century's most important and revered
artists." Although an interesting idea, its

After my thorough disappointment over
Renoir being the big Fall show at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, I was greatly
looking forward to the Frida Kahlo exhibition. To be totally honest, my knowledge of
both her work and her life is incredibly minimal (I feel like a bad queer for not even

knowing she openly identified as bisexual!),
but even my superficial exposure to her

100th
birth, "Frida Kahlo" first

opened at the Walker Art Center in
to
Minneapolis
traveling
before
Philadelphia, after which it will end its run
at the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art. Co-curated by Hayden Herrera and
Elizabeth Carpenter, curatorial work was
also provided by Michael Taylor and Emily
Hage at the PMA. It was the scholar Ms.
Herrera who wrote the book, "Frida: A
Biography of Frida Kahlo," upon which the
2002 major feature film, "Frida", was based.
Upon entering the exhibit, one is immediately confronted with "Self-Portrait with
Monkeys" (1943), an exemplary Kahlo piece.
A few other paintings lead into a set of three
galleries, all of which feature photographs
taken from throughout Kahlo's life. These
photos, some annotated by Kahlo with measured self-deprecation, are largely the work
of prominent photographers from the time,
but also include amateur works among their

ranks. Artists as diverse as Manuel Alvarez

Bravo and Nickolas Muray were allowed
access to Kahlo's private life
with cameras no less!
and thus given the opportunity to be a part of the self-conscious identity construction that was so vital to Kahlo's
being. The photographs give way to galleries
of paintings in Kahlo's trademark style,
some of which are fresh to the United States.
The selections ofKahlo's work is varied; not
only does the museum predictably display
many of the artist's well-known self-portraits, but also lesser-seen portraits ofothers
and explicitly political works such as the
expansive and enduring "Moses (Nucleus of
Creation)" (1945). There is also a series of
compelling still-lifes, which were unfortunately disregarded by most patrons due to
their exclusion from the audio tour.
Sufficiently fascinating as independent
artifacts ofKahlo's life, the three galleries of
photographs trouble the exhibition with
larger questions of just what is the subject of
the show, and how are the paintings meant
to be understood vis-a-vis such an overabundance of images. Detached from her displayed works in the galleries, I found the
images thoroughly arresting, but ultimately
ambiguous in their relationship to the construction of Kahlo. Was the show meant to
be biographical? Autobiographical? A sur-

vey of her work or a survey of her life?
The curation seems intent on creating an
elementary profile of the artist, a decision I

found trite and uninteresting. The show of
paintings following the photos is roughly
chronological, creating a dichotomous exhibition. The candid photos present the biographical: friends, lovers and internationally
renowned photographers who managed to
catch the "real Frida" living "real life." Her
self-portraits, naturally, are the auto-biographical: her honest depictions of otherwise
ineffable sufferings. Gliding from gallery to
gallery, I felt the curator's expectations bur-

March 27, 2008

dening me, compelling me to make strict and
banal comparisons between the two lives the
museum was presenting. "Remember in that
photo when Kahlo looked perfectly content?," the curators seemed to be whispering
in my ear, "Well, she was actually making
these tortured paintings at the same time.
Imagine that!"
If these photographs were intended to
provide additional biographical context or
to work in conjunction with the curatorial
narrative framing Kahlo's paintings, integrating them into the galleries to communicate more directly with the actual paintings
(the ostensible subjects of the exhibition)
would have been a more effective maneuver.
Alternatively, if the photographs were
intended as archival material used to provide access to a wealth of compelling documents that are nonetheless supplemental to
the main focus they would have been better situated at the end in a more "educational" setting with additional textual resources,

as some exhibits have been known to do.
Lastly, if exhibiting the full collection of
photographs in the context of an art exhibition on the same status level as Kahlo's
paintings was truly that important, they
would have been better served displayed in

a concurrent exhibition of their own right
much like the PMA chose to do with "Fragile
Demon: Juan Soriano in Mexico, 1935-1950,"
a show currently at the PMA and meant to
be seen in dialog with "Frida Kahlo."
Despite my qualms with the curation, the
power of Kahlo's paintings are undeniable.
The chance to see works ranging from her
well-known and truly monumental "Two
Fridas" (1939), to the enigmatic, miniature,
and undated "Circle" is not one to be passed
up. "Frida Kahlo" will remain at the PMA
through May 18.

List Gallery exhibit offers news perspectives on art
BY SARAH BRICAULT
sbricaul@swarthmore.edu
Let's say that we are walking in the city,
and happen to glance across the street. We
all see the same image, but some of us will
remember the sharp lines of perspective
that the skyscraper traces upward. Others
will have an impression of the sunlight
that glares off the tinted windows and casts
the scene in stark blacks and whites. Some'
might remember the blur of movement on
the street before us, or try to capture a perfect photograph of the scene in our minds.
All of these perspectives and more are

represented in the "Painting Structures:
Specificity and Synthesis" exhibit at the
List Gallery. Open March 1-30, this collection examines some of the myriad ways we
can view a structure. This show features
Sarah
Downes,
artists
Rackstraw
McEneaney, David Kapp, Sharon Horvath,
Yvonne Jacquette, Stanley Lewis and
Kevin Wixted.
Each of these seven artists "draws his
or her inspiration from architecture,"
Andrew Scott Taylor 'O9 said. On Monday,
March 24, Taylor and Clare Kobasa 'lO gave

a guided tour of the exhibit, detailing the
artistic style of each painter and drawing
the audience's attention to the specific
details of each painting.

The first artist whose work appears in
this exhibit is Rackstraw Downes. Downes'

photographic paintings capture- scenes
such as the underside of a bridge in exquisite detail. He uses lines to "frame and
direct the viewer's attention" Taylor said,
and in each painting, the audience "can
clearly see all the sources of light," Kobasa
added. In one painting, for example,
Downes uses somber tones and lines of
THE PHOENIX

shadows to capture the silence and emptiness that fill an attic.
Stanley Lewis, the next artist, shows
the depth both within the paintings and
through his use of paint as a medium. Each
ofLewis' paintings is composed of so many
layers that the scene actually appears to
change as it is viewed from different
angles. "The three dimensionality of the
paint creates a unique experience for the
viewer," said Kobasa.
This multi-dimensionality creates stark
contrast with the works of the next artist,
Sharon Horvath, whose paintings utilize
flatness to explore the abstract and surreal
nature of the empty baseball field. Horvath
has an "extraordinary use of line" Kobasa
said, and indeed the multitude of curving,
intersecting lines surrounding the stark
and empty field create an interestingly surreal scene.
Wixted, on the other hand, uses simple
colors and two-dimensional shapes to
model a city scene. In his paintings, "structures are broken down into their most simplistic forms," Kobasa said. Yet despite this
simplicity, Wixted's use of shading from
multiple light sources and different colors
"hints at three-dimensionality" Taylor
said. Wixted compellingly captures the
essence of a city scene through effective
use of simple shapes and simple colors.
The next artist in this gallery is Sarah
McEneaney. According

to Taylor, the

warm colors and open perspectives of her
paintings "convey more intimacy" and the
choice of intimate settings such as her private garden and her workroom "invite the
viewer in."
Yvonne Jacquette, however, captures a
perspective that "the viewer is not used
to," Taylor said. Jacquette's aerial views of

buildings convey a very real sense of distance and the lines in each painting interestingly separate the different elements of
each scene.
The final painter whose works appear
in this exhibit is David Kapp. Like
Jacquette, Kapp captures aerial views of
the city. However, Kapp utilizes the stark
contrast of blurred white on a dark backdrop to capture the inherent motion of the
city. Perhaps more than in any other painting in this gallery, Kapp's view of a curving highway overpass strongly suggests
movement in the sweeping curves. As

Kobasa pointed out, his "brushstrokes

March 27, 2008

really powerfully convey a sense

of

motion."
Every artist has a very specific and
unique way of viewing structures, and the
synthesis of all of these varied works creates an exhibit that is well worth seeing.
Each painting shows us a new perspective,
a way of looking at a scene that we might
not have thought of before.
However, words cannot truly do these
paintings justice, so if you have a few
moments to peruse the List Gallery before
March 30, consider stopping in on your
way past LPAC to get your own perspec-

tive.

Agribusiness. GMOs. There must
be a better answer than the marginally-better-of-two-evils. I came out in
my last column cautiously in favor
of the use of genetically modified
crops over current industrial agricultural practices. But there is also
an Option C: none of the above.
Biotechnology and gene manipulation is one way of applying all the
cool facts science has accumulated
over the years toward improving our
food supply. But like I said, there are
costs and risks. The regulatory hurdles a GM crop has to pass are wellestablished and there is general scientific consensus that bad GM crops
can get successfully weeded out in
the testing process. But GM crops
that have destructive side effects
when consumed or planted do exist
and the danger that they will accidentally make it into the food supply
the same way that bad drugs occasionally get through safety trials is
scary.

Industrial agriculture, meanwhile, is not so much an application
of knowledge to spur innovation as it
is a dogged war of attrition with the
environment. The whole enterprise
is harmfully reductionist; inputs are
quantifiable and outputs are simply
THE PHOENIX

all those chemical inputs and protecting the genetically carbon-copied
plants that are so vulnerable to infection by a single pathogen, the whole
surrounding environment gets contaminated with harmful chemicals
and too many nutrients, resulting in
things like recurring algal blooms
and marine dead zones in the
Chesapeake Bay. Increasingly low
profit margins coupled with a
messed up federal subsidy system
make things even worse and squeeze
out small and medium-sized farmers.

Farming sustainably
means farming on a
smaller scale and
farming organically.
That option C is starting to look
better and better. What is it? I'm sure
many of you see it coming. We now
know an awful lot. Why not apply
what we know in plant biology, soil
ecology and otherfields in a way that
improves the ecology of the land
instead of suppressing it? We can
plant smaller plots, even more than
one crop in the same field, so that
they are less vulnerable to bugs and
disease. We can build soil up so that
it is high in humus, retains water
and is full of beneficial fungi and
bacteria. We can be more careful
with the amount of fertilizer we
apply and avoid artificial fertilizer
all together by using commercialscale compost and planting covercrops that add nutrients to the soil.
We can, in short, farm sustainably.

Farming sustainably means farming on a smaller scale and farming
organically. Right now, both the
organic and the local movement are
niche markets because the resulting
produce is often expensive and
dependent on people with the money
and desire to pay a premium. But the

environmental and social reasons
for spending that money are very
good. Many people would also argue
that the food is much higher in quality and more nutritious.
The way I see it, the choice to
spend money on local and organic
food is, on a broad level, parallel to
the choice to spend extra money on
products like the iPhone because
they're new and innovative. One day,
touch-screen phones are going to
come free with your cell phone plan,
but that won't happen unless enough
pioneers are willing to invest in the
technology and fuel its refinement
and development for broader distribution.
In the same way, it is through
increased consumer investment that
community-supported agriculture
is becoming more common,
regional distribution centers for
small-scale farmers are being created, and pressure for federal policies
(CSA)

that better support small and organic farming is growing.
The percent of annual income
that Americans spend on food has
dropped from 24.2 percent in the
1930s to 9.5 percent by 2004, according to the USDA. It's a sign of

increased quality of life that we can
afford to spend money on college
tuition even after paying for
Renato's pizza. But what if those
with expendable income put less of
an emphasis on the Prada bag and
more on the celery and Diet Coke?
There is still a lot of room for growth
when it comes to organic and smallscale farming. Why not invest in a
good thing?

letter

editor

WWOR at Swat
To the Editor:
We are a group of students who identify as white
women who have been meeting since September 2007, to
talk about white privilege and racism. Our goals have

been to develop our understanding of racism and our role
in it as white women, to talk about the ways we have internalized racism growing up white and to support antiracist action on Swarthmore's campus and beyond. We
started meeting because we believe we have crucial personal work to do as white people around racism and white
identity.

We find that white students at Swat often co-opt multiracial discussions about racism and make them about
our needs alone, narrowing the conversation to white
guilt and white students' experiences and identities.
White students do need to be doing this work, but in ways
that are not at the expense of students of color. This group
comes out of the conviction that we as white people need
to take the responsibility onto ourselves to educate and
challenge each other around racism, in ways that are
accountable to and in relationship with people of color.
We believe that confronting racism honestly and usefully requires both reflection and action, so we have structured the group around both of these aims. We plan to
have:

Bi-weekly organizing meetings open to all students to
discuss and plan for events, etc. that the group is working
on around campus, and
Weekly discussion meetings open to students who
-

-

identify as white women to challenge each other to deepen
our understandings of racism and to process the racism

we have internalized.
We want this group to be as transparent as possible.
To that end, we are committed to posting the topic of our
weekly discussion meeting in the Campus Calendar and to
publishing minutes from our bi-weekly organizing meetings on an open SCCS website. In addition, group members will be available for questions and welcome suggestions for how to improve the transparency of the group.
We invite those interested to join us for our next discussion meeting on Wednesday, March 26th, at 9pm in
Kohlberg 328, and our next planning meeting on Sunday,
April 6th, at 9pm in the IC big room.
Please feel free to contact any of the following group
members with questions, suggestions or concerns:

our multicultural society. I found myself
contemplating what it is like to be multi

doubt my claim, which, while a bit arrogant, is somewhat understandable. They
do not know my family, they do not
know where or who I am from. "No,
really," I insist, but the response is often
the same. I have been accused of lying,
living in cultural denial and using my
last name to cheat the system. The hesitation of many people to accept me as a
Latina has often left me questioning
what possible relevance I could have in
my community when all I can offer people is my last name.
I have come to the realization that I
can contribute an understanding for the
different cultural identities that exist in
this world without being cynical or judgmental, while still holding strong to my
cultural identity. What I have to offer as
a Hispanic female with a diverse cultur-

al background are different ideas, values
and a voice. I am not ashamed of being
part Mexican or part white. The pride I
have for my culture and the love I have
for diversity (cultural, class, gender,

political, sexual orientation
the more
the merrier) is unyielding. lam not trying to speak for anyone, but I hope that
society in general can understand the
importance of being an ally for diversity.
It's not okay to normalize a person
based on their culture. It is not okay to
ostracize people of different cultural
backgrounds. And for the record, this
includes white people. Too often I hear of
people being actively excluded from certain groups because of this. That is
racism, and thinking you can generalize
a person and deny them cultural significance is ignorant. There is so much personal value in examining what your culture means to you, as well as what it
means to those around you.

I have been accused
of lying, living in
cultural denial, and
using my last name
to cheat the system.
Hopefully an opportunity to do both
will present itself to you this week in a

supportive and understanding environment. In the immortal words pf Sly and
the Family Stone, we've got to live
together. So why not make the most of it?

violence with China's brutal engagement of protesters and looters. Since then, the protests have been growing in the region
and coverage by international journalists has been suppressed,
though the Tibetan government-in-exile has confirmed at least
140 deaths of protesters as a result of police actions.
The protests are centered on the 1951 Chinese annexation of
Tibet and the subsequent denials of religious freedom and governmental representation. Since 1951, little international con-

sensus has emerged regarding the diplomatic status of Tibet,
especially following the failed Tibetan nationalist uprising in
1959. In the subsequent 49 years, the Chinese government
quelled the Tibetan uprising, exiled the Dalai Lama and
repressed outward religious expression.
The economic gains and military buildup in that time gave
the Chinese government the tools it needed to forcefully pursue
its nationalist 'One China' policy, and the 'progress' achieved
by China in that amount of time was due in no small part to its

trampling of human rights including the rights to expression
and self-determination. The violent suppression of dissenting
voices and religious expression in Tibet echoes the cries of the
Chinese massacred in Tiananmen Square, the 'June Fourth
Incident,' nearly 20 years ago.
Despite the lack ofresolution among the international community with regard to Tibet and the persistent human rights
abuses by the Chinese government, the International Olympic
Committee awarded the city of Beijing the honor of hosting the
2008 Summer Olympic Games. As such, we feel that the bestow-

ing of this honor upon China was a mistake and urge the
United States and other nations to boycott the 2008 Summer
Olympic Games. Since the Olympics provides a unique venue
with which countries can advertise their best qualities to the
rest of the world and attempt to ignore their worst qualities,
the nature of the games is very political. The political precedent for such a boycott exists, as boycotts were enacted for the
Summer Olympic Games in 1956,1976,1980 and 1984.
In the past, protests by both Chinese and Tibetan citizens
have been shown to be ineffective against the Chinese government, though the protests have gained large media coverage in
the West in the past week and a half. China's intense focus on
its success in hosting the Olympics provides a unique opportunity for Western nations to leverage public opinion in the service of political reform, with the goal being discussions between
the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama; the eventual goal,
of course, would be the achievement of a semi-autonomous
Tibetan state led by the Dalai Lama.
An American boycott of the Games would be unfortunate
for the athletes who have been preparing for the Olympics in
2008. However, there may never be a better opportunity to
stand up against Chinese human rights violations in Tibet and
China, nor a better chance for the West to show solidarity with
Tibet in order to achieve some independence for the region.
American participation in the games would legitimize Chinese
actions and in fact support them for years to come, due to the
likely financial gains and international exposure for China.
Tacit acceptance of China's violent methods would lower the
American morality to an intolerable nadir.

While Chender interprets the Muslim Student
Association's decision to forgo a religious advisor
to mean that all such advisors are redundant, we
interpret this information to mean that each religious culture on campus is unique and should have
the right to determine which structure best befits
their particular community. Many of the MSA's justifications for rejecting a campus Imam, while completely reasonable for the MSA, simply do not apply
to Swarthmore's Jewish community. The MSA, for
example, receives extensive support from campus
faculty. This semester, Ruach had to cancel its
annual Latke-Hamantaschen Debate, because we
could not find two professors (Jewish or not) willing
to participate. Our semesterly Professor Shabbats
are sparsely attended. We simply have no reasonable expectation that any Swarthmore professor is
regularly available to act as a resource to our community.

Unquestionably, Swarthmore's many Jewish
advisors over the years have all made vital contributions to Jewish life. Whether by working tire-

lessly to promote communication between the proliferation of Jewish groups, acting as a unifying
force in the Swarthmore Hillel, running workshops
on how to lead Shabbat services, providing useful
expertise, or counseling individual students in need
of spiritual guidance, our advisors have done nothing but improve our sense of community and connection to each other as Jews. For these reasons and
more, the Jewish community has for many years
been working to make the Jewish advisor a permanent, full-time position, eliminating the frequent
turnover that we feel is damaging to the cohesiveness and continuity of strong Jewish life on campus.
Contrary to Chender's insinuations, the Jewish
advisor does not in any way provide administrative
"control over 'how religious groups should or
should not act on campus'." (And we would like to
know the attribution of that quote, please.) None of
the Jewish groups on campus has ever been
approached by the administration or the Jewish
advisor and been instructed on our activities, prohibited from certain actions or in any other way
interfered with. Regular meetings between advisors
and deans are not evidence of a conspiracy. Our

wonderful Jewish advisor, Jake Rubin, provides
advice when asked and makes general suggestions,
but never demands. As with all campus life,
Swarthmore's Jewish life is student-organized and
student-run.
Finally, we feel obligated to point out in response
to Chender's facetious contention that all clubs on
campus have the right to an advisor, that
Swarthmore's spiritual advisors are not attached to
any club. They act as a resource for anyone in need,
one could even say especially for people who find
themselves alienated from the clubs geared towards
their spiritual community. The resources of the
spiritual advisors are thus not confined to one
group of students alone, but in fact open up greater
possibilities for diverse religious life for everyone.
And should the Hindu students or Baha'i students
decide to push for a spiritual advisor, we would support them.

Stat prof Wang shares unique perspective on managers

Last
month, Assistant
Professor of Statistics Steve

conference about statistical
work he had been doing to
evaluate Major League managers.

very adept at recognizing subtle differences in human faces.
So, a statistician might present multidimensional data as faces, where each category is represented by a facial feature.
For example, big ears might mean the
manager has a propensity to pull
pitchers early in a game,
while small ears mean he
lets them go for a while. In
this way, Wang constructed

a Chernoff face for each

manager.

•/>,-„,

It's an interesting challenge.
Managers are a very visible, oft
discussed part of every baseball
game, yet even the most avid
baseball fan has no grasp of a
manager's numbers. "People don

i

keep stats [about managers] very often.
Without the statistics, you really don't
know," Wang said.
For example, what was the highest
number of pitchouts called for by a manager in 2007? An observant watcher might
be able to give a ballpark figure but not
much more than that (it was 56, by the
way).

"Data visualization is
something all researchers
should do more often, and

we are fortunate at
Swarthmore to have an
expert among us."
Phil Everson
Associate professor
of statistics
By contrast, players' statistics are so
übiquitous that they alone can largely
identify a player. As Wang put it, "Player
statistics have language."
For instance, figure out which stat line
corresponds to Red Sox slugger David
Ortiz and which belongs to Red Sox outfielder Coco Crisp: 35 home runs/3 stolen
bases, 6 HR/28 SB. Any casual fan of the
sport will know that the first set corresponds to Ortiz, the latter to Crisp.
Wang seeks to bring some of that same
power of numbers to managers.
His study, which he presented to the
AAAS, sought to find differences and similarities among managers and see if such
tendencies were consistent over time.
The study compared the data of every
Major League manager across a wide
spectrum of categories, from number of
lineups used to number of runners sent in
motion on a pitch to number of pinch hitters used.
But there's a significant challenge to
be overcome in such a study. Comparison
of managers based on one stat can be visu-

alized on a number line; such a comparison for two stats can be represented on a
Cartesian plane. But what about six or
seven dimensions, or more?
"It's an interesting, challenging problem to make understandable pictures,"
Wang said. His solution was very interesting as well, and appealing to the eye.
First, he used Chernoff faces. The idea
behind this technique is that humans are
THE PHOENIX

Aside from being somewhat comical, the faces did
allow for patterns to be seen
large similarities or stark
differences were immediately
evident. However, these cartoon faces provided only so
much insight.
Wang found

a more effective

way to compare these managers over multiple dimensions. He created a table (a
"heat graph") in which each cell was specific to a certain manager and a certain
trait. For instance, the first column was
Jerry Narron, manager of the Reds, while
the first row was "long starts," the proclivity of a manager to leave in his starting pitcher. In that way, each manager
had a cell for each Category.
However, those cells did not contain
numbers; they were colored in. So if Jerry
Narron tends to leave starters in a long
time (which he does), cell 1A is a stark
red. If a manager has a low rating in a
given category, that cell is colored in blue.
In this way, the various dimensions of
these managers leap out of the table and
are very visually apparent. This allows
them to be grouped and analyzed in much
more precise and directed ways.

Though Wang's study only scratches
the surface of available research on managers, he believes he has found some
interesting results.
While managers certainly adapt to
their players, he thinks there are definitely strong tendencies that a manager will
show throughout his career, even with
different sets of players. For instance,
Tony Laßussa of the St. Louis Cardinals
has consistently used among the most different lineups over the course of a season,
while Phillies' manager Charlie Manuel
uses very few.
Wang hopes to continue his research
by using his visualization methods to
compare managers who have worked
together. For instance, while working on
his current study, he noticed that
Willie Randolph of the New York
Mets and Joe Torre of the New
York Yankees (until this year) j)
have very similar profiles.
Since Randolph worked as a
coach for Torre with the
Yankees for years, Wang

Men's lax suffers first defeats of season
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY LAUREN WALKER
lwalkerl@swarthmore.eclu
The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team ended their four
game winning streak this past week, dropping two games to

Centennial Conference opponents Ursinus and Dickinson
College. The Garnet first matched up against the Ursinus
Bears, falling short in a 13-3 loss, and then they battled the
Red Devils ofDickinson on Saturday to a tight 7-5 defeat.
The Garnet opened up their Centennial Conference
action on a rainy Wednesday night, taking on the Ursinus
Bears in Collegeville, Pa. Swarthmore was the first to strike
in the game, firing fwo goals past the Ursinus goalie before
the Bears could get on the board. Midfielder Todd Friedman
'O9 placed an unassisted goal in the upper corner about
twelve minutes in and attack Gavin Musynske 'lO fed a pass
to Stelios Wilson 'O9 for the second goal of the evening.
As the rain began to subside, however, the Bears were
able to get their offense up and running, and the momentum
shifted quickly out of Garnet control. Before the end of the
first quarter, the Bears had taken the lead, 3-2. Swarthmore
battled back and was able to get on the board again in the
second quarter, as Tyler Bradshaw 10 netted one for the
Garnet off a feed from Drew Bonessa 'OB, but the Bears once
again answered quickly with two more goals of their own,
giving themselves a 5-3 lead going into halftime.

Unfortunately, the Garnet struggled to find the back of
the net in the second half. The Bears, on the other hand,
went on a scoring frenzy, living up to their usual tendency
of scoring late in the game. Ursinus totaled seven goals in
the second half, bringing the final score to 13-3 and giving
the Garnet their first loss of the season.
On Saturday, the Garnet looked to bounce back against
their next Centennial Conference opponent, Dickinson.
They took on the Red Devils at home on Clothier Field,
playing them to a close 7-5 loss.
Dickinson struck first with a goal from midfielder Jon
Schneider with 9:36 remaining in the first quarter, but
Swarthmore responded quickly. Bradshaw notched an
unassisted goal less than three minutes later, tying the
game. The momentum shifted yet again, however, as the
Red Devils netted two more goals before the end of the first
quarter, giving them a 3-1 advantage. Swarthmore tallied
the only goal scored in the second quarter, as Wilson finished a feed from Bradshaw with 6:53 remaining in the
half, cutting the Red Devils lead to one goal going into halftime.
Both teams slipped another goal past their opposing
goalies in the third quarter. Midfielder Will Predun 'O9 put
an unassisted goal into the net a little more than six minutes into the half, but the Devils once again answered
back, reclaiming the lead 4-3. The Garnet came out fierce-

ly in the fourth quarter, as Wilson scored his second goal
of the day to knot the score up again. Soon afterwards, he
beautifully assisted Musynske, who captured the lead for
Swarthmore, 5-4.
In yet another shift of momentum, Dickinson regained

control, tying the game with about twelve minutes remaining. Then, with five minutes to go, the Red Devils struck
again, taking the lead that they would hold for the remainder of the game. As the clock wound down, a fluke goal
from midfield further extended Dickinson's lead, bringing
the final score to 7-5. It was an unfortunate end to such a
well fought battle. "Our defense played well against
Dickinson, we just caught some bad breaks," said Kevin

Friedenberg 'lO.
The losses bring the Garnet to 4-2 overall (0-2 CC).

College on Wednesday on Clothier Field at 7:00 p.m. "F&M

Women's tennis battles ranked Hopkins
BY JAYMES FAIRFAX-COLUMBO
jfairfal@swarthmore.edu
Unfortunately, the Garnet women's tennis team was unable to pull off the major
upset when they traveled to Baltimore to
face rival Johns Hopkins (ranked #l4
on Tuesday afternoon.
nationally)
However, the women still put up a solid
effort, and signs of progression and rebuilding are readily evident in the young squad.
One aspect that stands out most about
the young team is its atmosphere and the
support that the ladies give to one another.
As team captain Erica Lukoski 'OB said,
"There is
a great team dynamic.
Supporting your teammates in tennis
might be more important than it is in other
team sports, because when it comes down
to it, you are alone on the court playing
your match ... hearing others cheer or just
knowing they are there and are encourag-

22

ing you is very helpful and keeps

of the team high."

the

spirit

This team dynamic lends to the
improvement of the ladies, both as individuals and as a team. As Rachel Wallwork 'lO
described, "I think that everyone on the
team has improved an incredible amount
so far and they continue to improve all the
time. Everyone is really supportive of
everyone else, which is important for winning those tough matches."
Lukoski echoed that sentiment, stating,
"We have really come far from the beginning of the season, both on the court and
off. We have become closer as a team,
which is' important for team dynamics on
the court, especially in doubles. When we
win matches, this is being seen through
team spirit and intensity."
This type of growth as players helped
the team go into the match confident of
their ability to compete, even against a

nationally-ranked team.
Normally a
national ranking would strike fear into the
hearts of opponents, heaping extra pressure on them, but the Garnet took it in
stride. In describing the team attitude
towards the match, Wallwork stated, "I

don't think there is any added pressure
when playing a nationally ranked team.
For every match we just go out there and

play our hardest."

Lukoski shared a similar view, as she
said, "Given that we have had much experience in the past in both playing nationally-ranked teams and being a nationallyranked team, we have gotten used to a high
level of competition. It is always exciting
and usually, it elevates the level of everyone's game because there is a lot of hype.
However, the fact that Hopkins is also our
conference rival makes the match a little
more intense. These are the matches you
work so hard for in practice everyday.

March 27, 2008

When the big day comes, it is time to leave
it all out there on the court."
Though Hopkins handed the Garnet its
first conference loss and only its second
overall, the team's goals remain in focus.
"The goals of this season are to perform to
the best of our ability and be a real power
in the conference. We hope to make the
conference playoffs, as we have every year
previously. We are off to a great start... so
I think that we are working towards being
a threat in the conference and challenging
the top-ranked teams," Lukoski said.
The Garnet will get a chance at redemption this weekend when they seek to topple

another nationally ranked team, Skidmore
(#3O), at home, starting at 3:00 PM on
Friday afternoon. The team will follow that
up with conference play on both Saturday

and Tuesday when they host Washington
College a 1:00 p.m. and then travel to
Ursinus for some 3:30 p.m. action.

Swat golf gets it going Men's tennis splits pair
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY NYIKA CORBETT
acorbetl@swarthmore.edu

Unbeknownst to the wider Swarthmore community, the Swat golf team has been hard at
work these past few weeks. Coming off of a
spring break trip to Pinehurst, North Carolina,
the golfers dove straight into their busy season
schedule.

After a successful showing at Pinehurst,
where Michael Bernasek 'O9 led the Garnet to a

victory against the University of PittsburgGreensburg, the golfers suffered a disappointing
loss on their home course to the Neumann
College Knights. Despite strong play from
Jeffrey Lazarus 'lO, the Garnet couldn't compete
with the Knights, who dropped four rounds in
the 70's on Rolling Green's par-71 course.
After their first home match of the season,
the Garnet golfers traveled to Sea View Golf
Resort in Atlantic City to play Richard Stockton
College. Battling tough conditions, such as 30-40
mph winds coming off of the water, challenging
greens and the absence of two of their top playcaptains Lazarus and Bernasek
ers
Swarthmore lost to the Ospreys by a mere three
stroke margin. The Garnet was led by the only
captain present to play, Darren Johnson 'OB.
Johnson's impressive performance was the best
individual round of the match by a good deal.
Asked about the team's performance, Johnson
said, "Considering that two of our best players
weren't there, it wasn't a bad result."
Unfortunately Bernasek recently broke his toe,
but the team is hoping to have him back on the
-

-

green soon.

This past Monday, the golfers again hosted a
match on their home course. Out of the six
teams present, Holy Family University ended up
securing the team win. Two Swarthmore
golfers, Johnson and Lazarus posted 79s to tie
for eighth place individually. Swarthmore's
team score was rounded out by Armand Russo
'OB who shot an 86, followed by two 92s shot by
Michael "the BIG DOG" Johns 'OB and Kelly
Schoolmeester 'lO.
For those without much background in collegiate golf, team scoring works like this: a team
consists of five golfers, the top four of whom
count towards the team score, with the fifth acting as a tie-breaker if the need should arise. The
matches in which college teams compete consist
of 18 holes. On average, an 18-hole course takes
about four hours to complete, and can require a

great deal of walking. While these golfers rarely
get to joyride in golf carts, some of the athletes
enjoy the exercise of walking the 18 holes, while

carrying their own clubs.
In fact, the whole week of a Swarthmore
golfer is quite busy. Normally a home match on
Monday, played on the Rolling Greens Country
Club golf course, is followed by a Tuesday practice back at Rolling Green. Wednesday usually
consists of practice at a nearby driving range,
Thursday is practice again at Rolling Green,
Friday is usually an away match, or a prep for a

weekend match, and on their off-weekends the
golfers return to their place within the
Swarthmore bubble and "hit the books," as their
coach Jim Heller says.

Heller has been coaching the golf team here
for three years and has developed close relationships with his athletes. Russo described Heller
as a "good man and a good coach." Under
Heller's watch they have developed a rather successful lineup. Last year they placed second in
the Centennial Conference Championships, the
best finish in the history of Swarthmore golf.
They lost two All-Centennial players Eric Zwick
'O7 and Zach Moody 'O7, who graduated into life
after Swat and the world of business. They are
also down one other key player, David Lau 'O9,
who is studying abroad at Oxford this year.
Despite these losses, Swat is being led by a
strong, but young group of captains: Johnson,
Bernasek and Lazarus. Andy Hoot 10 described
the team as a pretty "close-knit group." While
most ofthe team members have some sort ofprevious golfing experience, Samantha Phong 'O9
said, "It's nice to play with people at a variety of
levels it makes all of us better players."
For the first time in 50 years, the Garnet golf
-

team is joined by two women. Phong and
Ashley Acle 'll Both women are from California
and compete alongside the men throughout the
season, but both will compete as individuals in
the Conference Championships where they will
be up against other women.

Golf is a mental game of intense focus, and
has a great deal of etiquette that accompanies
the sport. For example, when a fellow golfer is
hitting the ball, others try not to distract, limiting noise production and movement. As it takes
hours to get around a course, decorum keeps
tension down and allows for an enjoyable round
of golf. That being said, spectators are welcome
at matches the next match home match will be
held on March 31

Men's tennis, ranked #l2 in the
Atlantic South Region, improved their
record
to
Centennial
3-4, 3-0
Conference after consecutive conference wins March 21-22. Swarthmore
swept Ursinus College 9-0 on Friday

and went on to handily defeat
Dickinson 7-2 on Saturday. "It is
important to come out ready to play
when competing against conference
teams and our guys certainly did
that," men's tennis coach Jason Box
said.

Formerly an independent team,
this is the first season of Centennial
Conference competition for men's tennis. Rule changes at the national level

have made it harder for independent
teams to qualify for regional and
national postseason play. As a result,
men's tennis decided to join every

other Swarthmore NCAA team (aside
from Badminton) as Centennial
Conference members. "It is hard for us
to gauge the talent of all the
Centennial Conference teams that we
have never faced in previous years,"
Kevin Shaughnessy 'O9 said.
Against Ursinus (2-2, 0-2 CC),
Swarthmore began the day sweeping
doubles competition, only dropping
two games. "It was a good match to
gain some confidence," Jonathan Lo
'OB said. The Garnet continued their
sweep with victories in all six singles
matches. "I was happy to contribute to
the team's win and was especially
happy to not have dropped a single
game in my singles match," JJ
England 'O9 added.
This is the second shutout of the
season for the team (they also shut out
Muhlenberg on February 24). "We
played well against Ursinus and the
team score as well as individual scores
reflected that," Shaughnessy said.
Dickinson (20th in the Atlantic
South Region, 2-5, 0-2 CC) proved to be
stiffer competition on Saturday, as the
Garnet dropped its first two individual
matches in Centennial Conference

play. However, the Garnet passed their
first test with flying colors, winning 72. "I could sense the excitement from
the players at the beginning of the
Dickinson match because they knew
they needed to play well and were
looking forward to the challenge of a
fired up Dickinson team," Coach Box
said. "Dickinson is definitely the more
competitive of the two teams,"
England added.
The Garnet began the day sweeping
all three doubles matches in just 30
However,
minutes.
"Dickinson
stepped their game up in singles. We
weren't prepared for that and it took
us a set to adjust and get our play back
up
to where it should be,"
Shaughnessy said.
"My opponent took me by surprise

because he was unorthodox with his
forehand he only hit slice so it took
me a while to adjust. It was interesting
to see something different," added Lo,
who is ranked 24th individually in the
--

--

Atlantic South Region.
"We are happy to be 3-0 right now
in conference, but realize we have

much bigger matches ahead of us. Our
goal is to win a conference championship and each win is a step forward,
but we are still a long ways off from
the end of the road," Coach Box
explained.

"I like how our schedule is set up
the competition seems to get harder as
our season progresses," Shaughnessy
added.
Men's tennis will take a break from
Centennial Conference competition,
hosting rival Washington and Lee
University, 6th in the Atlantic South
Region, Saturday March 29 at 11 a.m.
"Washington and Lee is a tough opponent; I expect the men to be ready for
a battle against the Generals because
they are always up to play us. The
matches should be close and I feel good
about our chances if we can get off to a
good start in doubles," Coach Box said.
"They have always been our rivals
while I have played for Swarthmore,"
England added. "You can bet that we'll
be gunning for them on Saturday"

know, its like a hundred degrees out here and plus I'm nervous as hell because after all, this is The Show. Kids work

think is, "Damn these pants really itch, I hope they let me
keep them after the game." Finally I hear my personally chosen batter music come over the loudspeaker: "Milkshake" by
Kelis, of course. The sun seems really bright but I've got
some eye-black on, just to look like a badass even though I'm
not really a baseball player, I'm just a kid. Anyway, I walk
towards the batters box as 130 fans clap confusedly, not recognizing my name. The kid playing third base looks like he's
about 15 years old and about to get his first pimple but after
all he may be younger than me but he's a pro athlete.
I step in the box, and take my first look at the pitcher. On
the mound he seems like he's 6'10" and has barbed wire tats.
My blood runs cold. Stepping into the box I go through a
small pre-pitch routine, tap the far side of the plate and give
it two half swings before settling into my stance for the
pitch. I've got a million things running through my head, a
combination of everything my dad used to tell me playing
backyard ball plus everything manager Tito Francona told
me before the game. "Don't be nervous, kid," I hear in my
mind as the pitcher throws straight gas right down the pipe
for strike one. Guess he didn'tsee me as a threatening hitter.
So now I'm behind in the count and I realize I'm in way over
my head because if that first pitch had hit me it probably
would have pushed my ribs out through my back.
I step back in for the second pitch, same routine, same
drill except I give the pitcher a dirty look trying to intimidate him. His face doesn't change, terrifying. He takes the
windup and throws a screamer right at my melon. My knees

buckle uncontrollably as I bend way back like a small child,

or like Stelios Wilson playing wiffleball, right as the ball cuts
through the zone, strike two. I'm in a hole now, gotta choke
up and hang tough behind the plate. I step out and look at
Francona for the sign, he nods as if saying "swing away," and
I wonder to myself, "Why didn't I think of that?"
One more chance, I'm down 0-2 and in one pitch my
dreams could be crushed and I haven't even lifted the bat off
my shoulder. Do or die time, the third pitch comes and I
can't even react it's that fast, and my heart sinks because it
looks like its cutting a corner. The ump calls "ball!" probably out of pity for me since the pitcher looks like he's about
to murder everyone in the vicinity because of the call. So
now I'm back in the game at 1-2, looking good.
Got another chance as the pitcher winds up and slings
one, and since I haven't even brought the bat off my shoulder, I close my eyes and take a swing. I feel contact, like actual contact and it feels like all the fingers on my left hand just
got obliterated and I take off at a full sprint down the line.
Time to turn on the afterburners and bring out the speed. All
of a sudden I see the first baseman make a snag and the ump
throw a fist pump. I'm out, by a ways, a long ways.
I jog back to the bench with a huge smile, acting like I'm
the king and all Francona says to me when I get back to the
dugout is: "Run faster next time." So that's it for me, that's
all she wrote. "Run faster next time." Maybe I'll try that.

Swat hosts, plays impressively at badminton Nationals
BY SETH GREEN
sgreen3@swarthmore.edu

This past weekend, Swarthmore hosted over 15 schools
for the 2008 USA Badminton National Collegiate
Championship, and the Garnet did not disappoint. Kim
Kramer 'lO and Maithili Parikh 'll reached the women's
doubles final on Sunday before falling to Daphne Ng and
Teresa Lin from University of California Berkeley. The
doubles team is thus ranked second in the nation, while

the team earned an impressive fifth place finish.
Saturday featured many Garnet players in individual
competition. Yimei Zou 'lO lost to Daphne Ng, who went on
to win the singles competition. Karma Lama 'O9 lost to
University of Illinois' Lindsay Gibbel, who went on to be
defeated in round three.
Kramer defeated Cindy Wang of Cornell University
before succumbing in three tightly contested rounds to
Shelley Chan ofPrinceton University.
Parikh defeated Sara White of Drexel University before
falling in two rounds to Tiffany Prajudha of UC Irvine.
Alice Xiang 'lO also fell to Prajudha. Celeste Abou Negm
'O9 lost to Alice Wen of Irvine.
On the men's side, Cole Armstrong 'lO lost to eventual
champion Nicholas Jinadasa of UC Irvine, and Robert
Manduca 10 lost to Harold Juang of UC San Diego.
In doubles competition, Manduca and Armstrong lost to
a team from San Diego, as did Celeste and May Maani 'lO.
Kelly and Lama fell to a team from Berkeley. Xiang and
Zou lost to a team from the Univesrity of Virginia.
Kramer and Parikh absolutely wiped the floor with a
team from the University of Maryland, defeating them by
scores of 21-3 and 21-2. Their dominance was only matched
by their grace on the court and to their opponents following the matches.
They then faced a competitive team from San Diego, triumphing by 21-17 and 21-18. They lost one round to an
,

Irvine duo, 14-21, before winning their next two 21-17 each.
Their next round, against a Berkeley duo, was the most difficult yet. They lost their first match 12-21, before triumphing 21-17 and 21-19. In the finals, the duo succumbed to
national champions Ng and Lin by 21-12 and 21-1

"This is a huge deal. They beat west coast teams to get
that title and went home with medals," Kelly said of the
doubles team's impressive shwoing
Manduca said, "The weekend was really, really cool and
fun. It was exciting to see the best badminton players in
the country come here just to show us how awesome they
are."
Speaking of great players, Abou Negm was every excited to see an Olympic competitor, Nicholas Jinadasa, in the
Lamb Miller Field House. Jinadasa, of UC Irvine, taped
over the "USA" on his jersey and replaced it with "UCI."
He went on to capture first place in the men's singles com-

petition.
Kramer, who entered the weekend ranked 15th in the
nation, said that overall, the weekend went well. "It was
really great to have it at Swat," Kramer said of the home
court advantage.
It was a big improvement over Kramer's "hellish" trip
to the 2007 Nationals at Berkeley, in which her flight was
delayed and her luggage was lost.
Having it at Swarthmore was a great bonding experience for the team, she said.
Speaking about the matches, Kramer called the competition tough, noting that it was a "whole other level of
play" for many on the Swarthmore team, pitting people
who started playing in college against opponents who have
been playing since they were five.
Kramer has been playing badminton for much longer
than many others on the team. When she was in elementary school, she went to her local recreational center, and,
not enjoying classes in soccer, swimming or basketball,
picked badminton.

would be fantastic," she said.
"Honestly, I want to spend my life coaching," she said,

though admitting that the finances of full-time coaching
are difficult. There are, however, full-time badminton
clubs in California, and Kramer hopes to work out on the
west coast if everything goes according to plan.
Surely, many Swatties can sympathize with pursuing a
dream that might make a two-car garage lifestyle difficult,
but perhaps only Kramer's is dependent on whizzing

birdies.

Captain Patricia Kelly was delighted with the encouraging results of the tournaments and the season. "The running of the tournament was said to be one of the best ever
experienced," she said.

This concludes the season for the Swarthmore badminton team. It was a very successful one, and the ending
could hardly have been sweeter. "This has truly been one
of the best badminton seasons here and I appreciate all the
support that was showed by Swatties that came out to support. We received cupcakes and other cheers that really
encouraged us to perform as well. I could never thank
Swarthmore enough and thank my team enough for making my last season the best," Patricia Kelly said.

against each other, including a pair that went on to be a
