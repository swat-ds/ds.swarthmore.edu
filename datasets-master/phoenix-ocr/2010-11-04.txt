jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Assistant Professor of English
Rachel Buurma's newest project, the
Early Novel Database, is "sort of like a
library catalog on steroids," according
to Buurma '99. Thanks in part to a nomination from College Librarian Peggy
Seiden, the database has been awarded
the Community Contribution Award by
the National Institute for Technology in
Liberal Education.
The award will provide the database
with a small honorarium and an opportunity to publish case studies with
Academic Commons. The case studies
will be published in April 2011, under
the theme "Digital Humanities and the
Undergraduate."

Buurma said the Early Novel
Database is still in its infancy, but will
eventually allow users to create groups
of novels based on information gleaned
from the title page, biographical information about the author and even marginalia in specific copies of each book.
It draws from novels in both French
and English from before the year 1830.
"This will make possible the writing
of new histories of the novel. Usually
we rely on a very small number of
examples,
canonical,
well-known
though some novel critics try to make
big generalizations
This is going to
offer something in between," Buurma
said.
Currently, the database contains
over 3,000 novels, though several are
different editions of a novel or even different copies of the same edition.
Buurma pointed out that they are no
more interested in earlier versions of a
text than in later versions, since later
editions offer more information about
the book, its popularity and sometimes
its author.
Unlike other online literary databases, such as Project Gutenberg and
Google books, the Early Novel Database
is not going to offer full texts of novels,
but data about or describing the books.
Instead, it is about the meta-data of
books. "It emphasizes the way the novel
describes itself [on the title page and in
the preface] and information that can be
gathered by looking at the novel as
opposed to information about it,"
Buurma said.
The professor first worked on an
incarnation of this project when she
was still in graduate school, at the
University of Pennsylvania. That project came to a halt after their application
for a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities was
denied. She left Philadelphia after graduate school, but when she returned to
work at Swarthmore, she "realized [she]
was still interested and picked it up
...

...

again."

Now, two Swarthmore students,
Anna Levine 'l2 and Richard Li 'll, as
well as students at Bryn Mawr help contribute to the database. Two years ago,
the first summer they were involved
with the project, Li and Levine learned
how to analyze and then catalog rare
books at the Rare Books and
Manuscripts Library at the University
of Pennsylvania.
Levine, Li and Buurma also discussed conceptual issues relating to the

Award for her digital literary database, lectures in class.
project, and they kept a blog about their
progress. The next summer, Li and
Levine mostly worked on cleaning up
records they had already created, but
they continued to catalog books, too.
"I got involved with the Early Novels

Database as a freshman. Rachel asked
me ifI had any interest working on the
project over the summer, and it seemed

many undergraduates majoring in the
humanities get to do research," Levine
said in an e-mail.
Seiden pointed out that although
there are several ways for students to
gain research experience in the sciences, it is very difficult to find such
work in the humanities. This is partly
because humanities work is rarely collaborative. "I think in the humanities

sis," Seiden said.
Working on a project like this is a
rare chance for college students, she
said. She described once meeting a professor from the University of Chicago
who was opposed to working even with
graduate students, on the grounds that
they did not offer the same knowledge
and experience as senior researchers.
"I think [the fact] that she's bringing
in undergraduates is really wonderful,"
Seiden said.
Buurma said the people who work on
the project do not have any sort of hierarchy. "I am the faculty director, so I'm
in charge of content, you could say. But
we're non-hierarchical, we think of ourselves as collaborators."

Rendell rallies campus voters day before elections
BY JACQUELINE SMALL

jsmalll@swarthmore.edu

Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell

spoke to a small group of students in
Science Center 101 on Monday afternoon.
He urged students to vote for the
Democratic candidates in Tuesday's
midterm elections, focusing primarily on
Bryan Lentz, who ran for U.S. Congress

in the 7th district; Mike Farrell, who ran
for state senate in the 26th district, and
Walt Waite, who ran for State
Representative in the 161st district.
Farrell, Waite and Lentz all attended the
rally, as did Rick Lowe, the mayor of
Swarthmore and Maurice Eldridge '6l,
vice president for community and college

relations.

The rally started at 3:40 p.m., 40 min-

utes later than planned, because the governor had been busy campaigning at various places throughout the day and had
gotten behind schedule.

He spoke for approximately 25 minutes, followed by a brief speech by Lentz.
Natalie Litton, president of the College
Democrats, opened the rally by introducing RendeU.

"As you know tomorrow is Election
Day, and the only poll that really matters
is the one that's taken on Election Day
when we get up and get out and vote,"
Rendell said.
He believed the election was much
closer than the polls were showing. "I
have sensed a much stronger democratic
turnout than the polls are predicting," he
said. Rendell explained that in his campaigning, he has seen members of the
Latino, African American and gay communities "fired up" to vote Democratic.
Rendell went on to discuss the strides
that the Democratic party has made in
social improvements. He cited the Lily
Ledbetter bill, which ensures equal pay
for men and women, the credit card bills

said that although financial reform on
Wall Street is still imperfect, the changes
that are being made will prevent a second

Student body responds to radical posters
BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore. edu

Posters are übiquitous on campus;
posters denouncing President Obama's
presidency usually are not. That is, until
last Wednesday.
In an effort to promote a new conservative student group known as the
America's
Young
Swarthmore
Foundation (YAF), Danielle Charette 'l4
put up countless controversial posters in
various campus buildings last week
reflecting her conservative ideals.
Several of them, however, were defaced
and even taken down and replaced with
parodies of Charette's original posters.
Especially noticeable in Sharpies,
some of Charette's posters portrayed a
fractured picture ofObama's face, declaring statements such as, "Epic Fail" and
"After only one year, we are poorer, weaker, less respected, and less free." Another
poster declared, "It's the economy, stupid," over a picture ofRonald Reagan.
Also immediately after they were put
up, Charette's posters sparked a wide
response from the student body.
shocked
"Everyone was pretty much
to see that kind of rhetoric used at
Swarthmore," Andy Forrest 'l2, member
of Students for a Democratic Society,
said.
Unidentified sources have been putting satirical sticky notes on the posters
saying "down with the fascist government" and "down with bureaucracy."
Charette has also noticed that all of the
anti-Obama are missing and that several
other mock-ups have been posted around
campus, calling YAF "our local branch of
the number one conservative group in
the United States."
"If 50 percent of the American public
doesn't like Obama's policies, it shouldn't
be World War IE if one Swarthmore student criticizes the president," Charette
said in defenseof her anti-Obama posters.
Dan Symonds 'll admits that he has

own, but made sure to leave Charette's
posters alone. "I wrote some quick comebacks in the hopes of satirizing YAF's ideological kin, using the same level of emotionalism and superficiality that the
'Obama epic fail' sky-is-falling flyers did,"
he said in an e-mail.
For both Forrest and Symonds, most of
the controversy lies in the inflammatory
language in Charette's posters.
"I don't necessarily have a problem
with posting controversial views, but
when you start saying things like
'Obama's a failure because he's an
embarrassment,' it doesn't really make
much sense to me," Forrest said.
Charette's intentions, though, were

not to

anger.

"I was frustrated that we were just
having a one-sided dialogue about certain
things and I thought, 'Well, I can't really
get frustrated if I don't come back from
the other side,'" Charette said.
Thus to enhance dialogue, Charette
formed a new conservative group, YAF,
thatwould work with the national YAF
an organization specialized in helping
students promote conservatism at their
schools to bring conservative lecturers
to campus. The posters were just a way to
publicize the group.
Currently in the process of being chartered by Student Council, YAF already
has a cohort ofabout six students who are
interested in joining.
Natalie Litton 'l2, president of the
College Democrats, finds the formation of
such a conservative group healthy for
Swarthmore. "I think it's great," she said.
"I think that every student on this campus has a right to form a group to build to
the conversation."
What's interesting for Charette and
most conservative Swarthmore students is that in the real world the
posters would be considered moderate.
"I'm from D.C. and to be honest, most
of those posters were very, very tame
compared to actually offensive
posters," said Peter Ballen 'l4, who

NEWS IN BRIEF BHMI

Three incidents reported during night of
Halloween party, underage student cited
The night of the Halloween party
is usually the busiest Saturday
night for Public Safety, but this
year's party, which was held in
Sharpies, was relatively tame, with
only three reported incidents.
"If you look back at... Halloween
parties for the past five years, this
was as good as any, perhaps better
than most, so far as accidents,
injuries, alcohol [and] police
[involvement] go," Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave said.

According to Redgrave, at 12:22
a.m., Public Safety responded to a
report that an intoxicated student

had fallen off the cereal counter in
Sharpies. She was subsequently
rushed to the Springfield hospital
by ambulance and treated for a
sprained ankle.
The incident will be handled as
an accident and the student will not
receive a citation for underage
drinking.

Earlier in the night, public safety also responded to two unrelated
reports of two students with alcohol

poisoning, one at 12:08 a.m. and one
at 12:19 a.m.

Both students were taken by
ambulance to the hospital. Since
one of the students was under 21
and highly intoxicated, she will
receive a citation.
All three students are currently
in fine condition.
Redgrave attributes the decline
in number of incidents to the location of the Halloween party this
year.
Apart from last year, previous
Halloween parties have been held at
the Mary Lyons dorm. Many incidents usually occurred from students walking back to campus
intoxicated and out in public streets
and sidewalks, Redgrave said.
Swarthmore Chief of Police
Brian Craig also noticed this trend.
"The activity is much reduced from
when it was at Mary Lyons," he
said. "It is a lot less than what
we've experienced in the past."

identifies himself as conservative.
Charette figured that since the
Swarthmore community is primarily leftleaning, students would be offended by
her posters, but she did not anticipate
such a passive-aggressive response from
the student body. Despite the fact that she
provided her contact information on all
posters, only a few students have personally e-mailed Charette asking her to
defend her views.
"I don't think there was a lot of
thought behind the original removal of

Litton claims that the College
Democrats are not behind any of these
counterattacks. Though she may find
fault in Charette's posters, Litton said,
the expression of ideas at Swarthmore
should not be suppressed.
"I don't agree with the ideology, but
that has nothing to do with the right to
gather, to post their ideas or to look for
others who are similar minded," Litton
said. "I think that people should not be
taking these posters down; they should
not be writing on them; they should not
be parodying them."
But in putting up his posters,
Symonds had no intention of disrespecting Charette's right to express her ideas.
"I regret that my initial postering retort
seems to have been interpreted as a personal attack against Danielle, when I
meant only to lampoon the incendiary
bluster of the posters themselves," he
said in an e-mail.
Forrest also claims that SDS as a
group is not involved with any of the
counter posters and stands behind
Symonds' conviction that he did not
remove any ofCharette's posters.
"I definitely know that [Symonds] did-

n't take any down. He made sure that the
other posters were still visible," Forrest
said.
The taking down of Charette's posters
also sparked Kenneson Chen 14 to put up
posters with a photo of Reagan as a hero
and two shirtless men kissing with the
text, "What do you think? It doesn't matter. If you take this down
it's censor...

ship."

All of these responses show that
Charette's posters have done more than
just bring a conservative voice to campus. They have sparked many discussions about the importance of the freedom of speech and tolerance, especially at
Swarthmore where the diversity of ideas
is highly respected.
"If we really value diversity, we
should value someone who comes forth,
has a different opinion and be willing to
listen to that and tolerate that," Charette
said.
Ballen, who is considering joining
YAF, agrees. "If you want to put up a
poster that says, you know, 'Obama is a
socialist' or 'Republicans are fascists' or
'Reagan and Bush are war criminals' or
whatever you feel like, that's your right."
For Charette, these counter posters
will not stop her from continuing with
the formation of her new conservative
group.
If anything, she's found amusement in
catching people's reactions as they
passed by her posters last week. "It is
funny to watch people casually walk into
Sharpies and then their heads kind of
turn," she said.
But Charette does plan on reconsidering her advertising tactics for YAF. Based
on the response she has already garnered, she probably will not put up any
more anti-Obama posters. "If we do
advertise," she said, "we're going to need
to be much more moderate."

Studying in the Middle East among segregation
It seems as though no
place in the world receives

as much media attention as
the Eastern Mediterranean,
whose cities
such as
Beirut, Damascus
and
Jerusalem
and citizens
can barely go a day without
appearing on the front page
of the New York Times.
Those of you who excel at
counting will have noticed
that more than 70 days have
Jasper Goldberg
passed since I started travelAround the World
ing across Europe. I am now
in 70 Days
I studying in the Eastern
Mediterranean, and am desperately trying to write an
article about a place where it seems as though everything
has been written about, usually by far better writers than I
could ever hope to be.
It is difficult to write about Israel without discussing the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, to focus exclusively
on this conflict is to pay insufficient attention to the cultures ofboth peoples. I have not spent enough time in the
West Bank to write knowledgeably about Palestinian culture, and for now I think it is better for me to focus on
Israeli culture. Both societies are so much more than their
conflicts, and I believe that most people living in this
region would prefer to be known for their foods and traditions, rather than for their feuds and tragedies. My hope is
to be as evenhanded as possible in my writing, but I know
I will not succeed in the eyes of every reader.
Israeli society is much more complex than I had expected. Each of my four Israeli roommates has a differentbackground; one's family is German-Iraqi, another GermanMoroccan, a third Kurdish-Moroccan and the fourth
Moldovan. Initially, as in the United States, Europeans held
the highest social status, and there was significant discrimination against non-European Jews. Over time, nonEuropean Jews have gained greater equality and today
roughly a third of all Israeli marriages are mixed. Similar
to how military service led members of different ethnicand
socio-economic groups to intermingle when America had
the draft, the Israeli military has also broken down barri-

ers between Jews from around the world.
Just as Americans have begun to embrace their preNorth American roots, some Israelis have recently revived
traditionsfrom the Jewish diaspora. Traditional Moroccan
weddings have become very popular (one of my roommates
is attending a traditional wedding this weekend). Falafel
and Shawarma dominate the fast-food scene, along with the
Israeli chain McDavids, which sadly is being squeezed out
by kosher McDonald's restaurants.
Of course, some Jewish immigrants never lost their traditional culture. For example, later this year some friends
of mine and I might join the Bnai Yisrael, a Jewish community from near Mumbai, for an Indian-influenced
Hanukkah. My roommates have promised to teach me
Iraqi and Yemeni dishes that they have learned from
friends and family, and Moroccan dishes are a staple of our
cooking in the apartment. Perhaps only places like New
York City and San Francisco can compete with the diversity of Israeli cuisine.
Besides Jewish Israelis, there are also significant numbers ofArab Israelis and Druze. As usual with the Middle
East, names can be complicated; there are many Arab Jews
in Israel who are now considered "Jewish Israelis," while
the term "Arab Israeli" refers to the Christians and
Muslims living inside ofIsrael's 1967 borders. Arab Israelis
do not have the same political status as Arabs living in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, but most prefer to identify as
Palestinian. In the broader Arab world, they are sometimes
refered to as "The Arabs of 1948" or "The Arabs Within." To
make things a little more confusing, some Christians consider themselves Israeli, although they speak Arabic.
Many feel stuck between the Arab states, which the
Arab Israelis/Palestinians I have met told me are too autocratic or Islamic (Palestinians are among the best educated
people in the world and historically have had little interest
in fundamentalism), and Israel, which many of them view
as an occupying power. This dilemma perhaps explains
why the 2006 Herzliya Patriotism Survey found that 56% of
Arab Israelis 'are not proud of their citizenship," but 77%
consider Israel to be "better than most countries."
At my university, a large number of students belong to
this group, although I am not sure how many are Christian
and how many are Muslim. Many female Arab students
wear the hijab, and the male Arab students are among the
most politically active students on campus, but plenty of

Arab students are neither conservatively dressed nor polit-

ically active. Although Israel is the only place in the Middle
in large
numbers, there is too much social segregation between the
three religions, although less so between Christians and
Muslims. It sometimes seems as though we foreign students, who are often unable to distinguish Jews from
Muslims or Christians, are the only ones who intermingle
freely. My friends and I are planning to put on a large
Thanksgiving celebration, and it will be interesting to see
how our roommates, who come from different backgrounds, will interact if we are able to convince them to
East where people of all three faiths study together

come.
The Druze living in Israel are jokingly referred to by
Jewish Israelis as being "more Israeli than we are." They
serve in the army and border police, and do not identify
with Arab Nationalism. This is partially because some
Arab nationalists persecuted them prior to 1948. However,
Druze in the Golan Heights, which is internationally
regarded as Syrian territory, continue to identify as Syrian
citizens, and less than 10% accepted Israeli citizenship.
Interestingly, the Associated Press reported in 2007 that
many Druze in the Golan Heights quietly prefer Israeli rule
to Syrian rule, because they have more freedoms in Israel
than they would in Syria. On the other hand, Druze living
within Israel's pre-1967 war boundaries share what is
referred to as "a covenant of blood" with Jewish Israelis
from fighting together in Israel's wars.
And so, here I am in Haifa, with neither a kippah nor
keffiyeh on my head, able both to brew beer with my roommate Gil and to eat bacon while my roommate Avichai isn't
looking (to Avichai's credit, he makes awesome sushi). I
certainly don't know how to solve the conflicts I have
avoided discussing in this article, and I don't know
whether my Thanksgiving barbecue will even attract my
friends' roommates to come and intermingle.
I'm hopeful though that they may come for the food. A
few days ago, I was in the car with Avichai, Ari (my
American roommate) and two of Ari's friends who are
working at an immigration center for Ethiopians. We
passed an Arab restaurant whose tables were filled with
people devouring plates of hummus. "Most of them are
Jewish," Avichai said, laughing.

Removing the stigma of Vodou through Fet Gede
BY SERA JEONG
sjeongJ@swarthmore.edu

Haitian Vodou," professor of religion
Yvonne Chireau said of the event's impor-

While Day of the Dead celebrations
bring to mind the Latin American Dia de
los Muertos, many other religions and
countries, like Haiti, observe this day as

Fet Gede translates to "festival of the
dead" and more specifically, the festival of
the angel Gede. The purpose is to honor
ancestors by honoring Gede, who is known
as the original ancestor. The service's
atmosphere was very different from a conventional, formal religious ceremony and
is instead exactly what the Creole name
suggests, a festival. While Vodou beliefs
suggest that there is nothing to fear in
death as it leads to the immortal, Fet
Gede's honoring of the dead is conducted
in a spirit of celebration, rather than
mourning. Students were encouraged to
dance with each other and in front of the
altar; participants spent little time sitting
down.
The evening gave students a wider perspective of Vodou. "I was surprised it was
so open to non-participants [of the religion]. I thought [Vodou] was something
that involved an evil force.' I realize it is
worship of ancestors," Ted Goh 'l4 said.
Vodou is not a form of witchcraft as
commonly perceived. It is an inclusive and
multidimensional religion that borrows
elements from other religions such as
Catholicism, the predominant religion of
the masters of Haitians during the
Plantation Era. "Vodou is a collection of

well.

On Saturday, Oct. 30, the Haitian Vodou
celebration of Day of the Dead, Fet Gede,
was held in Bond Hall. Vodou often conjures images of voodoo dolls and witch doctors. However, those who attended were
exposed to a practice largely different from
the stereotype.
"What everybody knows about Vodou
they've learned from movies and TV, and
that's wrong," Mambo Pat, a priestess from
the Vodou house Sosyete du Marche in
Philadelphia, said.
Mambo Pat began the celebrations by
giving background information to Haitian
Vodou and how she became a Vodou
Priestess. Swathmore's Fet Gede event
included Sosyete du Marche's members
and founders assembling an altar and leading a service to the dead, which mostly
involved singing in Creole and dancing to
drums.
"We really have an opportunity here
tonight to see how the big question of death
is spoken to, interrogated and addressed in
a particular tradition, the religion of

8

tance to the community.

practices. We call it a Creole religion,"

Mambo Pat said.
The inclusiveness of Vodou is reflected
in the demographics of those who partake.
Sosyete du Marche includes members of
American, Latino, Haitian, pan-American
and Native American origin. Although
worship songs are conducted in Creole and
French, these languages need not be mastered to identify with Vodou.
Mambo Pat, whose full name is Mambo
Vye Zo Komande la Menfo, is not Haitian,
French or African. An American, Mambo
Pat went to Haiti to search for answers
after her mother was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's. She says she felt a calling to
become ordained after a Vodou priest read
cards that revealed her new purpose of
being a Vodou Priestess. It is now part of
her personal vision to ensure Vodou is recognized as a valid religion.
At the center of the celebrations was an
altar, an important element in Vodou as it
is a form of offering for spirits. Food is particularly significant for Haitians because,
as poverty is a major social issue, many
people do not eat everyday. The food
offered during the Fet Gede was cookies,
which are not a traditional Haitian food.
After offering the food to the spirits, participants were welcomed to eat the offerings. Typical Day of the Dead ceremonies
in Haiti can last for over five hours. The

November 4, 201G

ceremony held on Saturday lasted only
about one hour. While students had ample
space to sing and dance in Bond Hall,
Haitian ceremonies take place in much
more confined environments due to the
high population density of Haiti.
Vodou in Haiti "was more of an underground thing," according to Goh, who visited a community near Port-au-Prince this
summer. Goh could not feel an overt presence of Vodou in the community he was
staying at and noted the growing influence
of Christianity. Vodou, though, is heavily
ingrained in Haitian culture and history,
which makes it unlikely to be completely
lost.
Mambo Pat describes Vodou as being
not so different from other religions, as its
essence is to serve people and serve spirits.
Followers of Vodou serve members of the
community through education and charity
work. These factors are similar to the values of more mainstream religions like
Christianity. Perhaps once the barrier of
reputation is overcome, these similarities
will make Vodou a more acknowledged
religion.

"Vodou is growing slowly but steadily.
The conditions in Haiti are precluding people from going back and participating in
the religion there. The diaspora is growing
hugely [in the USA]," Mambo Pat said.

Living the green life: it's a lot easier than you think
swarthmorephoenix.com

Now that I have exhausted my technological treasure trove, I turn to my experience as one of your campus Green Advisors to provide some nifty green tips
and strategies that will save
you money and resources
while helping to ensure a
sustainable future for you
and for the planet. My rec-

Steve Dean
Life Tips from a Dean

ommendations here enable
you to go green without any
significant changes or costs
to your daily life
I will
not ask you to harvest your

own "humanure" or eat
exclusively discarded food. That said, if those activities
float your 100% recyclable Crum regatta boat, then by all

means continue.
At the activities fair at the beginning of this semester, I
walked past a table for the Green Advisors and decided to
sign up on a whim. I wasn't the ideal candidate for a Green
Advisor. I had never composted anything in my life, and I
was going on my third year of drinking coffee virtually
every day out of the coffee bar paper cups. But from the
moment I signed my name and thereby incorporated into
my life a new identity
a Swarthmore GA my frame of
reference was transformed such that I viewed normal dayto-day situations through a new, green lens. My challenge
to you is not to merely adopt a few of my sustainability
strategies as part of your daily repertoire, but to adopt sustainability itself as the frame through which you view your
repertoire. By enabling your green actions to both derive
from and retroactively affirm your own character, you will
have established for yourself an unlimited capacity for the
natural "feel good" psychological rewards that accompany
your every sustainable action.
Reduce

There are hundreds of simple changes you can make
that will reduce your impact on the environment while saving you money and peace of mind. When you wake up in
the morning, consider the 3-step sustainable showering
technique that can immediately cut your water consumption in half: (1) Turn on the water to get yourself wet; (2)
turn off the water while you shampoo your hair and soap
up your body; (3) turn the water back on to rinse off. Few
people actually turn the water off during what is oftentimes
the longest part of their shower; instead, they tend to let the
water run, thus diluting their lathering efforts.
After you finish up with your shower, you decide to take
the time before class to print out your readings. But don't
just set the printer to duplex and assume that you've done
all you can. Oftentimes your printed readings will contain
many extra pages of notes and acknowledgements, which
only serve to weigh down your stack of readings and trick
you into thinking that your breezy 10-page article is actually a 25-page monolith. Take the extra few seconds to
excise the offending pages before you print.
Then, when you reach for a plastic bottle of water on
your way to class, consider for a second how much that bottle cost both you and the environment. In the best case scenario, you recycle the bottle when you're done and you've
merely incurred the purchase price of the bottle itself and
the collective environmental costs of bottle production, distribution, and (in an ideal case) recycling. But now consider that your tap water in all likelihood undergoes far more
stringent health and safety requirements than that bottled
water, and to top it off, tap water is virtually free to you,
and drinking it from a mug or bottle of your own entails no
environmental repercussions. While on the topic of mugs,
let's look at that cup of coffee that you were going to buy on
your way to class. If you do not own your own mug or thermos, every cup ofcoffee that you drink out of a paper, plastic or styrofoam container will carry the cost of proper disposal, which in the case of styrofoam could mean hundreds
of years in a landfill. You can get an excellent, fashionable,
100% microwaveable and 100% recyclable mug at Target for
under ten dollars.
So now you're driving to Target, accelerating quickly
because of your excitement. But alas, aggressive driving
characterized by fast acceleration and abrupt braking can
reduce a car's fuel efficiency by up to 33% on the highway.
Basically, your Prius just became a Camry. This is the
point where you start to realize that the true benefits from
going green arise from a transformationof your approach,
not just the incorporation of unconnected green tactics.

THE PHQENIX

Reuse

The concept of reuse strikes a particularly sympathetic
chord in my heart thanks to a profound experience I had
with a piece of cardboard during my sophomore year. One
day, as I was walking to the trash room in Alice Paul, I
noticed a large, thick piece of discarded white cardboard,
which I had never seen before. Strangely, however, stuck to
it was a post-it note with nothing other than my name written on it (and not in my handwriting). I interpreted it as a
sign from the gods, and I carried it back into my room, and
it has since accompanied me for over two years. It stands
up at the head of my bed, preventing my pillows from
falling off the bed at night. In the morning, it doubles as a
tray for breakfast. Throughout the day, it works nicely as a
lap-top countertop. It serves as a reminder that reuse of
existing possessions can be incredibly rewarding.
When you bought your mug at Target, they probably

tried to give you a plastic bag. If you had planned ahead,
however, you could have, in a matter of minutes, turned
your old t-shirts into nifty totes. Just fold them inside out,
sew them shut at the base, and cut as big an opening into
the necks as you like, and voila!, you now have strong, fashionable, personally-relevant, and machine-washable tote
bags that can accompany you on all your adventures!
As for my favorite method of re-use, I recommend that
you take full advantage of the "free tables" in your dorms.
Free table items are awesome, namely because you don't
have to pay for them, and the people getting rid of them can
be rewarded with the knowledge that their trash indeed
turned out .to be another person's treasure. Plus, you might

be surprised to see some of the things people are willing to
throw away. Case in point: there is currently a working TV
(with remote!) on my hall's free table.
Recycle

We Swatties are lucky enough to have many opportunities for recycling throughout campus. I wish to offer two
insights that may facilitate your recycling experience.
First, you can recycle print cartridges and batteries in the
bins in Shane lounge, so you never again have to contemplate the world's profound recycling dilemmas, like the cutoff of environmentally destructive chemicals your print
cartridge must contain in order for it to still count as "plastic." Secondly, recycling in this area can entail some distinct monetary benefits. The Best Buy on Baltimore Pike
will happily recycle your old desktop computer towers and
laptops as long as you remove the hard drives first, and if
you recycle a monitor or TV in particular, Best Buy will
give you a $lO gift card.

When all is said and done, being sustainable is more
than just the sum of its green parts. Sustainability is a
lifestyle characterized by an internal disposition toward
environmentally-friendly, low-impact actions, and luckily
for us, a truly sustainable lifestyle can be both easy and fun
to adopt, if only we accept sustainability as a valid, worthwhile and meaningful element of our own individual identities.

Art exhibit draws inspiration from familiar themes
BY ISAAC HAN AND JOHN OH

ihanX

john2@swarthmore.edu

While the works of students and
famous artists alike grace the walls of
the List Gallery and classrooms of
Beardsley, we are rarely given the opportunity to see the artwork done by
Swarthmore art professors. Professor of
Studio Art Randall Exon's work, though,
is currently being exhibited at the
Community Arts Center's Duke Gallery
in Wallingford, PA. Exon's work in the
"At Home" exhibit draws upon themes of
familiarity and personal experience.
Running until Nov. 24, "At Home"
showcases some of Exon's landscape
paintings from the past four years. The
name "At Home" has a double meaning:
it refers both to how the Arts Center is
only a block away from his home, while
his work is typically displayed at the
Hirschl & Adler Modern Gallery in New
York, and how much his work embodies
the sense of nostalgia that he has for the
landscapes that he paints.
Exon, who considers himself a landscape painter, focuses most of his landscapes on three places that have played a
large part in his life: the Upper Midwest
and Kansas, where he spent most of his
childhood, Southeastern Pennsylvania,
where he currently lives, and Northwest
Ireland. Exon spent many summers and
holidays at his family's farms in South
Dakota as a child. The landscapes of
South Dakota and Nebraska were 'Very
mysterious place[s]" for Exon. Exon also

marvels at the landscapes near his home
now, like the Delaware Bay or the
Susquehanna River, as well as the Irish
landscape, where Exon spent time as a
Fellow at the Ballinglen Arts Foundation
in Mayo, Ireland:
"The Irish landscape, [especially] that
part of northwest Mayo, is just spectacular along the ocean," Exon said. "It
almost reminded me of the upper
Midwest, although it had this big ocean.
The terrain had some similarities."
While Exon's landscapes include
some figures and he's also painted portraits, he was drawn to landscapes
because of their ability to transcend differences. "Most people have had the
experience of going into the landscape
and having that wonderful experience of
just looking over and saying, 'Oh, how
beautiful that is," Exon said. "I think the
role of the painters in the past [was] conjuring up those moments and getting
them down in paint."
Exon described painting as a kind of
"alchemy," where it's, at the basic level,
dirt mixed with oil are placed on fabric.
"It has no value beyond the imagination
that's demonstrated and, to some degree,
the skill that's demonstrated."
Drawing from his past, Exon creates a
canvas that draws upon the experiences
of the people viewing his work, whether
it's their memories of a beautiful landscape or their childhood.
"The thing I like about his works is
that they invite people in," Debbie Yoder,
the executive director of the Arts Center,

said of Exon's works. "There is some-

thing very welcoming about his work.
Part of me thinks it has a great deal to do
with how his imagination works; the colors are accessible and awe inspiring."
Another element of his paintings that

makes his work more accessible is the
fact that Exon masterfully wields his
craft to express the very sense of nostalgia he wishes to paint.
"Clearly grounded in issues of classical ideas of design, colors, texture, he
masterfully manipulates air, light, and
space in his artwork," Profesor of Studio
Art and Chair Syd Carpenter said. "His
work is accessible and beautiful. It's the
subtle things he does in painting that can
only be done by someone who practices."
Exon is able to effectively translate
the elements of a landscape to mold a
painting that elicits a very profound personal response. Rose Cunniffe, a member
of the Exhibition Committee at the
Center, finds that his paintings, like
"Hydrangea" and "Rule of Twelfths"
show the "uncomplicated views which
have been creatively edited by his imagination." One of his oil paintings featured
in the exhibit, entitled "Sheets and
Garage," is of a clothesline and an isolated white garage on a hilltop of a rural
area, The scene achieves familiarity in
spite of its specificity. The scene is only
of one garage and clothesline but
through its color scheme acknowledges
the images reminiscent of universality.
"The exhibit is a coherent, evocative
body of work in which each painting is

absolutely noteworthy, and invites one to
pause and contemplate," Cunniffe said.
"At Home," which features both
Exon's oil and watercolor paintings, will
be on display at the Community Arts
Center until Nov. 24. Exon will be at the
Community Arts Center this Sunday,
Nov. 7 to discuss the thematic elements
of his paintings. There will also be a

Epic poem 'Beowulf returns to its musical roots
his performance work with "Sequentia,"
saw Beowulf as a performance text

BY DINA ZINGARO

Bagby

dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

Typically, one is primarily exposed to
the epic poem "Beowulf' in its written
form. Swarthmore students, however, will
have the opportunity to appreciate the

verses in its medieval oral tradition.
World renowned vocalist and musician

Benjamin Bagby will perform "Beowulf'
this Friday, Nov. 5 in LPAC at 8 p.m. in the
story telling tradition characteristic of the

medieval bard or poet.
With "Beowulf's roots in the art of the
scope or entertainer of early medieval
England, bardic story-tellers would recite
the Anglo-Saxon epic poem at formal gatherings. Drawing from this tradition of tribal society, Bagby uses a six-stringed harp
in his re-telling of the story in both song
and speech. Though a modern English
translation is projected on a screen for the
audience, Bagby even performs in the dead
language of Anglo-Saxon, or Old English.
Famous for his "Beowulf' project,
Bagby first gained worldwide acclaim in
his direction of "Sequentia," an ensemble
he founded in 1974 that is dedicated to performing medieval music. After his musical
studies in the U.S. at Oberlin College and

later in Switzerland, he founded the
ensemble in Germany and eventually relocated it to Paris where he now teaches
medieval music performance practice at
the Sorbonne University.
Bagby remembers being fond of
"Beowulf" as a child, but always considered the poem solely a literary text. After

and began to consider the project of mixing instrumeht and word.
To make the poem into a performance,
Bagby first envisioned the performance's
"sound-image," which is the image of how
the sound of the language, in this case Old
English or Anglo Saxon, can be employed
musically with singing. "It was just an
image which allowed me to then proceed
with the work kind oflike unlocking the
door," Bagby said. "In other words, I didn't
approach it as an intellectual process. It
stadted with a real gut reaction."
Bagby performed a short scene from
"Beowulf' in 1987 as a segment in a
"Sequentia" concert program ofmedieval
English music. The Utrecht Early Music
Festival in the Netherlands invited Bagby
to perform "Beowulf" in 1990 and in less
than five months, Bagby transformed his
original 10-minute song into an hour-long
performance of the epic poem. Bagby then
gained recognition in his performances
across Europe and North America.
Bards performed stories such as
"Beowulf' over a few days, usually performing about 400 lines per evening.
Currently, he performs one third of the
poem, which is about 1,062 lines of text'. To
learn the remaining two thirds would
require him to cease his other work in
order to dedicate the time for memorization.
For his performance, Bagby uses a specially made instrument, a six-stringed
harp, fashioned after the medieval lyre

excavated from a 7th-century German
nobleman's grave. Bagby taught himself to
play the instrument and studied the use of
such small-sized harps in other cultures
such as Africa and Asia. "I am not copying
techniques from another culture, but
instead I am learning from how they
approach the instrument, how they view it
and how it is employed," Bagby said.
The crafting of his performance did not
involve any musical notation, but Bagby
studied extensively early medieval modal
theory, which is the study of melodies or
harmonies based on modes other than the
ordinary major and minor scales. Bagby
used his own artistic license to choose and
combine the various sounds, especially
since he is limited in using his hands for
expressive means. However, he considers
such artistic limitations also to be a bless-

ing.

"In a way; the extreme limitationof the
circumstances of performance are to my
benefitbecause clearly when you are working with a lot of limitations, you begin [to
be] much more creative," Bagby said.
To bring life to the performance, Bagby
heightens his speech selectively and relies
on facial expressions. He also draws from
traditional story-telling techniques and
also adds his own style from his experience
in training as an actor and singer.
In 2002, Professor of English Literature
Craig Williamson attended Bagby's performance at Bryn Mawr College, Now, as
head of the Medieval Studies program,
Williamson invited Bagby to perform at
Swarthmore. He recalls how Bagby "took

on the voice of the characters," especially
when narrating verses about the monster,
Grendel.
"It's pretty spectacular. You are not
actually sitting at a table eating meat and
drinking, but it does make you feel like you
are in an eighth-century gathering,"
Williamson said. "We don't really have
many opportunities to actually experience
what oral forms of prose were like."
"Beowulf," written between the eighth

and eleventh centuries, continues to live
on in contemporary culture in novels,
translations, comic books and in the 2007
film "Beowulf." In regards to this enduring
appeal, Bagby points to the tale's "archaic
or ahistorical" character.
Bagby feels the text's universal concepts of power, strength, ambition and
especially of fearlessness attract readers.
"We would all love to be fearless, but we
live in a world of fear," Bagby said.
"[Bagby] has

"My style's kind of all over the place now," Cai said.
"There are days when I dress sort of androgynously

50s and early 60s, specifically those that have cinched

Deer cull most effective, humane way to preserve Crum
The college's decision to have anothpending the
er deer cull this winter
approval of its application
may not
initially seem comforting, but it is the
safest and most humane way to deal
with the spiking deer population in the
Crum Woods. Periodically hiring sharpshooters to hunt deer is, in fact, an environmentally ethical choice at this point
because it would most effectively preserve the woods' currently strained
ecosystem.
After years of research and consider-

ation, the college had a deer cull in the
Crum Woods last winter. Conscientious
and thoughtful, the Crum Woods
Stewardship Commitee has done an
excellent job in addressing the dangerous upsurge in deer in the Crum Woods.
Lacking natural predators and eating
a variety of plant species, white-tail deer
bring a challenge to the Crum Woods
ecosystem, as evidence has shown.
Since 2001, the college has been studying the effects that an overabundance of
deer has had on the Crum Woods. A
group of outside consultants concluded
in 2003 that the abundance of deer has
profoundly limited the forest's ability to
regenerate native plant species and
reduced the natural habitats for some
animals.
As deer eat native oak saplings and
older trees die, for instance, the forest
canopy is reduced and other animals'
habitats are consequently put in danger.
The explosion of deer has been serious. There are about 50 to 70 deer per
square mile in the Crum Woods' 170-acre
tract of land, according to 2007 data. The
problem is exacerbated with does giving
birth to one or two fawns each year.
The application for this cull asks to
hunt 50 deer.
Deer also are primary carriers of
Lyme disease-bearing ticks, a health
concern that cannot be understated considering the frequent traffic through the
woods.
Certainly, hunting animals is not an
ideal or easy decision for a largely liberal school with a focus on ethical intelli-

gence and a palpable environmental
community on campus. There has been
some backlash in recent years regarding
the deer cull, much of it centering on the
ethics of resorting to hunting as the one
and only way to solve a problem.
Though that same kind of reaction
doesn't seem to have been voiced recently, we think it is still essential to emphasize that the deer cull is the only realistic option at this point to properly
address a problem that will only get
worse if action isn't taken.
Contraceptive methods in theory
seem like a more humane alternative
than hiring sharpshooters, but immunocontraception has not been released
commercially, has not been approved by
the EPA or FDA and has not been tested

in open spaces.
Besides, deer's average lifespan in
the woods is 18 years, meaning that contraceptive methods likely would only
bring a decline too slow to make a significant difference.
Other methods have been considered
such as constructing a fencing system
or introducing natural predators
but
the effectiveness and safety of them have
continually remained unclear.
Arguing that killing animals is principally unethical at this point, then, is a
tired argument. After all, it ignores
research and effectively disregards that
other organisms and habitats will be
more negatively impacted a point that
should be the primary environmental
concern right now.
Admittedly, the thought of sharpshooters roaming the Crum Woods is not
a comforting thought considering it is
an area visited not just by the campus
but also the borough and surrounding
communities. Nevertheless, the Crum
Woods Stewardship Committee has
insisted the sharpshooters are professionals who will shoot only from elevation and at times where there will be
minimal traffic.

Making sure that these regulations
remain is absolutely vital for ensuring
that this deer cull and following ones

A case for slutty Halloween costumes

But when it comes to Halloween,
police officers, fire fighters, nurses,

remain safe not just for the woods but
also the people who visit it.
The CWSP, from continually considering other options to opening itself up
to campus and community input, has
acted conscientiously and thoughtfully
since they first commissioned research.
We expect the college will continue to
carry itself this way, as evidenced for
instance by the college's plan to use a
new research-based monitoring program

to help inform what methods should be

taken in the future.
The CWSC has clearly handled this
issue effectively and done an excellent
job in preserving one of the college's
vital assets.
And though we are at a school that
constantly calls for open forums and
campus-wide discussions, we believe
this is an issue we think can be safely
put to rest.

While it is noble that Obama said the government
shouldreduce wasteful spending, the fact that Obama criticized Las Vegas while he was in the city was the problem.
Tourists go to Las Vegas not only to gamble, but to spend
money there. I mean, the unemployment rate in the city
has topped 15 percent. Obama's comment certainly did not

help. Even Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada,
went after Obama for implying that people should not go
to Las Vegas in this economy. Reid told the White House
to "lay off Vegas."
In the latest dispute, Obama recently has been attacking the Chamber of Commerce. Obama and his
Democratic counterparts argue that foreign money is
being used by the nonprofit to bolster Republican candidates in the midterm elections.The administration admitted they had no evidence of this. Yet, they vehemently
attacked the organization that represents three million
businesses, including small businesses. The reason for
these ads is the anti-corporate climate that exists under

the Obama administration.
Now, as the midterm elections pass and we enter a
lame duck Congress, Democrats will have to decide
whether or not to extend the Bush tax cuts. The reason
this was not voted on before the midterms is that the
administration and many Democrats do not want to
extend the tax cuts for families making over $250,000 a
year.

They fail to recognize that many small businesses are
run by people making over this amount due to IRS regulations and the fact that businesses take a long time to
turn a profit. For businesses classified as standard corporations, all business profit is counted as personal income
for the business owners. It is these small businesses that
we need to create jobs.
After the bailouts were already complete, Obama
decried corporate officials taking bonuses. While this may
have been wrong, this is how to get the best officials in the
corporate world to turn around a struggling company.
Obama also said that "I do think at a certain point you've
made enough money."
We live in a capitalist society; people have the ability
to make as much money as they can, if they are successful. President Obama should not be telling Americans
how much money they should make. He should be celebrating that there is the ability to do so in this country.
But this is a column about social issues, right?

The negativity the Obama administration shows
towards business has become a social issue, maybe even a
social problem. The unemployment rate is not headed in
the right direction, nearly 15 million people can't find a
job, and individuals and families are struggling. I'm not
saying that the administration is completely at fault,
although their attitude isn't helping.
One of the major problems I have with the President is
that he does not celebrate America the way past presidents, including John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan,
have. They encouraged America's entrepreneurial spirit.
They did not demean you for being successful, no matter
the shape of the economy at the time.
We live in a society governed by the free market. I am
not saying it is always perfect, but it is the best system put
into practice thus far in the history of the world.
It bothers me to hear people talk about business like it
is the ultimate evil. The for-profit sector keeps the majority of Americans employed and prospering.
If there is one social issue that is important to me
above all others it is the ability to fulfill the American
Dream. If you play by the rules and work hard, it is all
right to be successful. That can mean advancing to the top
of your field, or starting a new business and turning a
profit.

Often this success comes with a financial reward. This
is how we measure success in the private sector in
America. The reason Swarthmore has an over $1 billion
endowment is because many of the graduates have gone
out and made a lot of money. They then gave back to the
college.

President Obama and the Democrats should be encour-

aging, not remonstrating, business. Making money
should not be considered an immoral practice, especially

in this economy.
So, as the Democrats' complete control over
Washington, D.C. comes to an end, I ask the administration and Democrats in congress to join Republicans in
promoting business. It is the only way we will get our
economy moving again.

According to Eva
comedy
series "Mike
& Molly," a show that Kelly admittedly
has never watched, she wrote: "I'd be
grossed out if I had to watch two characters with rolls and rolls of fat kissing
each other because I'd be grossed out
if I had to watch them doing anything.
To be brutally honest, even in real life,
I find it aesthetically displeasing to
watch a very, very fat person simply
walk across a room
just like I'd find
it distressing ifI saw a very drunk person stumbling across a bar or a heroine

Kelly falsely postulates, "No one
who is as fat as Mike and Molly can be
healthy
I think obesity is something
that most people have a ton of control
over. It's something they can change, if
only they put their minds to it."
As Kate Harding, co-author of

because exercise burns visceral fat
stored under the skin."
"Mike & Molly" unusually profiles
the love story of two working class
characters
that self-identify
as
overeaters. Through comedy, the audience witnesses the reality in trying to
navigate a relationship in a society
that, as Kelly exemplified, considers fat
people unlovable. Often confined to
marginal spaces, blacks, gays and the
non-thin are exclusively used in popular media for comedic relief and retribution.
It is perhaps this depiction of real
Americans that threatens women like
Kelly and large media establishments.
The critical success of shows like
"Mike & Molly" is powerful because it
will ultimately change how these vapid
institutions do business.
Though a fashion magazine, Marie
Claire has always positioned itself as
the alternative choice, slightly edgier
than their more superficial competitors. One of my favorite recent columnists is Ashley Falcon of "Big Girl in A
Skinny World." It's hard to believe that
Falcon and Kelly are a part of the same
brand, and this difference signals there
is an extreme level of inconsistency
within the magazine.
In response to the backlash, Editorin-Chief Joanna Coles seemingly
defended Kelly and the post, calling the
blogger "provocative" and awarding
Kelly legitimacy since Kelly was
"anorexic herself." The 28,000 email
responses to the piece did not warrant
a strong apology but instead "excited

"Mike & Molly" has already introduced additional sub-plots, such as the

beautiful love story. I suppose I have

might

even dust it off for the 2012 World Series.
Maybe 2013. It's a journalistic Mad-Lib:
Fill in the appropriate names and dates,
and I'm home free. How about the 2035
Series, when the Royals face off against
the Pirates? Doesn't matter. Sure, it
might be played on the moon, but the
question of whether a manager should
change his strategy for the playoffs or
continue to manage as he has throughout the season will always be an issue,
whether the games are played in zero
gravity or not.
maybe the biggest
One reason
why this will always be an issue is
because with the right cliches at your
disposal, you can make a convincing
case for either side. Observe:
"Now, [name of manager] has been
pushing the right buttons all year long.
That's what's gotten his team to this
point. He's been steady, he's been consistent and he's kept his team focused on the
goal ahead. All of a sudden, he's changing the approach that's been so successful
all year. He's asking players to do things
they never did all season, and more
importantly, the team knows he's managing tense. They feed off that tension, and
it infects the clubhouse."
"Look, the playoffs aren't like the regular season. You 're facing better pitching, better hitting, and usually a bunch
of players who have been here before.
Teams in the playoffs know how to win,
and know how to hold a lead. You can't
take the chance of letting these games get
away from you like you might on July
17th; you've got to manage with a cutthroat urgency that you didn't need down
the stretch. Manage like you did during
the regular season? Let me ask you this:
Are the STAKES the same as they were
during the regular season?
See? Listen to either of those cases
individually, and you'd be positive that
it was the right way to go. This year, the
man on trial was Ron Washington, manager of World Series losers the Texas
Rangers. He's on trial the way Joe
Girardi was last year, the way Charlie
Manuel was in 2008, Bob Melvin in 2007,
and as far back as you care to go. In each
case, most of the controversy will
revolve around managing the bullpen
and Washington hasn't proved an exception. Several times this postseason, he
declined to use his rookie closer, Neftali
Feliz, in the eighth to either preserve a
comfortable-but-not-safe lead or to keep
a deficit close to give the offense one last
chance to rally.
Instead, he attempted to mix and
match, hoping to coax one or two outs
from his palette of situational relievers.
Washington's reasoning: Feliz, although
he's been phenomenal all year, rarely
entered the game before the ninth
inning, and he didn't want him to start

now. Cue the dueling cliches:
"Now, Neftali Feliz is an electric
young closer who's got a future in this
league, but he's still only a rookie, and
now you're asking him to do something
he almost never did all season in the
biggest games of the year? COME ON!
"Look, Feliz has been 'The Guy' for
Texas all year, there to get the big outs at
the end of the game. Now you 're in the
World Series, and you 're gonna put it in
the hands of somebody else? You 're telling
me, with his stuff, that he can't come on
in the eighth inning to blow that tripledigit fastball by a couple extra batters?
COME ON!
Of course, Washington got burned
three times by this decision, once
against the Yankees and twice in San
Francisco. Not that things like evidence
and fact are all that important here
show me a hundred examples where one
approach fails; I'll show you a hundred
where it succeeds. What really is important here is the same thing that's important for every controversial decision in
sports, from an onside kick in the Super
Bowl to leaving Wilt Chamberlain on
the bench in Game 7 of the Finals: Did it
work?
Now that the Series is over,
Washington's so-called "gaffes" will be
part of the narrative explaining why
Texas lost. He didn't manage with the
necessary "urgency" that the World
Series requires. He didn't pitch CliffLee
in Game 4 on short rest to keep Texas
from getting in a 3-1 hole. Never mind
that Cliff Lee would have been doing
something he has never done in the
World Series, and that in the two starts
he did make he wasn't exactly a house of
fire.
Even the one move Washington DID
make that he never would have in the
regular season, when he put the corpse
of Vlad Guerrero in right field in Game
1 to keep his bat, was torn apart when it
didn't work*. There was a script to follow, and as soon as Washington's team
lost, it turned out that he had followed
the wrong one.
*The number of base hits that rolled
past Guerrero to the wall in Game 1:
Two. The number of hits Guerrero had
the entire Series: One.
I can't honestly say I prefer one
approach to the other, and maybe that's
why there was a part of me that appreciated how sure Washington seemed to
be in what he was doing. He must have
known what was coming in the press
conference room every time Darren
O'Day and Mark Lowe couldn't get the
job done with Feliz waiting in the wings.
"He had a rough night," he would say
of [name of Texas reliever worse than
Feliz], and move on. Never terse. Never
rude. Simply unfaltering in his belief of
what he was doing.
But it seems that even he had a limit.
Or maybe he figured he'd get some
belated back patting from the guys
who've been tearing him to shreds.
After Edgar Renteria's home run hit the
mute button on the Ballpark in
Arlington in the seventh inning and
Cliff Lee guaranteed himself a mixed
legacy as a Texas Ranger, Washington
needed two innings from his bullpen.
One guy pitched both of them. Can you
guess who it was?
Cue the dueling cliches.
On second thought... don't bother.

Garnet seniors go out with big win at Diplomats

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

The regular season finale for the
Swarthmore women's soccer showcased
both the talent of the team's six seniors
as well as the bright future of the program.

Centennial
Three
consecutive
Conference losses had dropped the
Garnet soccer team out of the
picture,
Centennial playoff
but
Swarthmore responded with a convincing 4-0 victory over the homestanding
Franklin & Marshall Diplomats.
Kirsten Peterson 'll entered her final
regular-season game tied with EB
Fortier 'O2 for the most assists in program history. In the 15th minute,
Peterson found fellow senior Hannah
Purkey who buried the ball in the back
of the net to give the Garnet the early 10 lead.
For Peterson, it was the 15th assist in
her career, giving her sole possession of
first place for the most assists in a
Swarthmore women's soccer career.
Purkey's goal was her third of the season and the ninth ofher career.
Three minutes later, seniors connected again for the Garnet as Kelsey Cline
'll headed in a Laura Bolger 'll feed for
the 2-0 lead. The goal was the first of the
season for Cline, who was limited to
four games this year due to injury. It
was the 17th of her career. Bolger's
assist was the fourth of her career.
The teams entered the half with the
score 2-0, but Megan Brock 'l4 found the
back of the net twice after halftime,
showing the team that there is much to
be excited about going into next year
despite the loss of six seniors.
Brock, who hit more posts this season than the rest of the team combined,
scored on her first shot of the match
Saturday, putting in a rebound just four
minutes after halftime. Her second of
the match came on a blast from the left
side of the box to cap the scoring.
"We're upset we aren't going to the
[Centennial Conference] playoffs, but
we also need to remember that we're a
good team. Unlucky games happen but if
we put in the work to get better every
time we play, we'll have success next
year," said Brock, who was one of four
first-year players to score for the Garnet
this year.
Head coach Todd Anckaitis was
pleased that the team was able to come
away with a victory in the final regular
season match of the year. "We feel like
we've been playing well and it was nice
to finally get a result. The team felt really good about it and I thought it was a
good performance, especiaUy because
the finishing part was there," he said.
"You can go back through the season
and find five or six plays that completely changed the course of the year,"
Anckaitis added. "In a soccer season,
you expect one of those, maybe two. But
surely not as many as we've had this
year."

Elizabeth Mills 'll and Megan
Colombo 'll also appeared in their final
regular-season game for Swarthmore on
Saturday, appearing in their 76th and
games
72nd
respectively.
When Colombo first arrived at
Swarthmore in the fall of 2007, she
didn't see herself as a big time
goal scorer.

Colombo has scored 31 goals and recorded 75 points in her stellar career.
which she established herself as the
best player
in the Centennial
Conference,
Colombo will
leave
Swarthmore with the most goals (31)
and points (75) in a women's soccer
career. Her 13 assists are just two shy of
the new program record set by her classmate Peterson.

Colombo, who led Swarthmore this
season with nine goals and twenty
points, was named first-team AllCentennial as a first-year and a junior
and second-team All-Centennial as a
sophomore. "I told [Colombo] in the offseason that I thought she was the best
player in the Conference, and she really
showed that this season," Anckaitis
said.
"Megan's presence never went unnoticed on the field. Her leadership was by
example and we're definitely going to
miss that next year," Brock said. "She
always made me want to be a better soccer player. She kept practices and
games fun while always bringing up the
intensity."

"When Megan isn't here next year, I
am really going to miss her style ofplay.
No one else on our team, or in our conference, plays the way Megan does.
When she has the ball, she shows a lot of

trickiness and is able to beat just about
any defender. It is really fun to watch
her play and her confidence on the field
is going to be really hard to replace,"
said goaltender Marie Mutryn 'l2.
While her coaches and teammates
rave about her play and her locker room
presence, Colombo also earned the
admiration of opponents as well, both
for her talent and her composure on the
field.
"I had a Centennial coach this season
ask if he could borrow [Colombo] for the
next game, I had a coach say 'Without a
doubt, she is my favorite player in the
conference,'; I had another coach come
over after a game and say 'Megan
Colombo is sick with some of the things
that she can do on the field," Anckaitis
described.
Several highlights of Colombo's
career immediately jump to Anckaitis'
mind. As a first-year player, Colombo
scored a hat trick in a late regular season match against a strong Ursinus
team. "She was just on fire," Anckaitis
said.
When the Garnet faced Ursinus again
in the Centennial Conference tournament that year, they double-teamed
Colombo, opening up scoring opportuni-

November 4, 2010

ties for the rest of her teammates.
But playing through double-teams
and physical opponents for the remainder ofher career, Colombo always handled herself with grace. "She always
just played through it, even when officials weren't making calls and protecting her," Anckaitis said.
Another highlight also comes from
Colombo's first year with the team.
Against Catholic in the finals of the
Eastern College Athletic Conference
South tournament, Colombo attempted
a bicycle kick in the box and put the
shot on goal.
"When Megan tried that bicycle kick,
Catholic's coach called out to me and so
I turned to him, and he said 'Oh my
God,'" Anckaitis said. The shot didn't go
in, but that quality set Colombo apart
for all four years with the program.
Megan Colombo and her fellow seniors left Franklin & Marshall winners in
their final regular season game, but
their contributions will not soon be forgotten by their teammates or Anckaitis.
"Megan and that whole class is just
passionate about soccer and passionate
about their teammates," Anckaitis said.
"They are real hard workers and we are
going to miss that class next year."

Garnet sweeps Bullets again to set up date with Fords

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

Prior to 2010, the Swarthmore volleyball team had
never beaten the Gettysburg Bullets. But on
Wednesday in the first round of the Centennial
swept
tournament,
Swarthmore
Conference
Gettysburg for the second time this season, setting up
Saturday's semifinal with the Haverford Fords.
After clinching a Centennial Conference playoff
spot against the Gettysburg Bullets 12 days ago, the
Swarthmore volleyball team was riding a seven game
Centennial Conference winning streak, having not
dropped a set since a Conference-opening 3-0 loss at
Johns Hopkins.
But last week, two playoff-bound volleyball teams
showed the Garnet that it must continue to improve if
it hopes to contend for a championship this year. In
Tarble Pavillion last Wednesday, the Haverford Fords
knocked off the Garnet 3-1, and Franklin and Marshall
defeated the Garnet in straight sets on Saturday.
Those two losses dropped the Garnet to fourth in
the Centennial Conference, earning the team a
rematch with Gettysburg, a team that Swarthmore
had never beaten before the victory this season.
Despite the losses, head coach Harleigh Chwastyk
emphasized that the team is not in a slump, pointing
out that Haverford and F&M are two of the top three

teams in the Centennial Conference
Each set was a battle against Haverford. After
dropping the first two sets 25-20 and 25-19, the Garnet
came back to win the third set 25-23. The fourth and
decisive set was again close, with the Fords taking it
25-19.
Swarthmore also fell to Haverford 3-1 in the
Centennial semifinals last season, dropping the first
two sets, taking the third and falling in the fourth.
Haverford finished the regular season undefeated
to secure the No. 1 seed for this weekend's tourna-

ment.

As evidence of the quality of play in the match,
four Garnet players racked up double-digit digs
against Haverford, led by 20 from Hillary Santana 'l2.
Sarah Lambert 'll, Genny Pezzola 'l2 and Danielle
Sullivan 'l4 were also active on defense, diving all
over the court against the hard hitting Fords.
The offense was strong as well for Swarthmore
with Kat Montemurro 'l3 accumulating 14 kills.
Pezzola kept pace with 12 of her own and added three
service aces as well. Allie Coleman 'l3 led the way in
setting up those kills, contributing 32 assists.
Above all, the game was a learning experience for
the team, Pezzola said. She added that the team hopes
to meet the Fords again in the playoffs.
The loss to F&M was more disappointing according
to Pezzola. Playing for a bye into the conference semi-

final round, the Garnet dropped the first set 25-19. A
hard-fought second set ended 26-24 in favor of the
Diplomats, who then rode the momentum to take the
third set 25-19.
The match moved F&M's record to 20-6 and 8-2 in
Centennial play and dropped Swarthmore into the
opening-round match with Gettysburg.
Facing the Bullets soon after defeating themfor the
first time in school history, the Garnet liked their
chances. Coach Chwastyk said that although the first
match this year against Gettysburg was close, the
Garnet had the capability to dominate stretches when
playing well.
Entering Wednesday's game, Swarthmore was 9-1
in Tarble Pavillion. The Garnet defeated Muhlenberg
at home in last season's opening-round match for the
team's first ever Centennial Conference playoff win.
Pezzola and the Garnet attack dominated the
Bullets from the opening serve. Pezolla recorded 16
kills as the team hit .264 for the match.
Gettysburg was unable to respond thanks to an
active Garnet defense that held the Bullets to an .095
hitting percentage.
Santana led the team with 16 digs and Pezzola
added 14 for the Garnet, who won in front of a boisterous crowd 25-17, 25-15, 25-2

Semifinal action from Haverford is scheduled to
begin at noon on Saturday.

Cross-country men and women fourth at CC meet
BY RENEE FLORES
rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's and
women's cross country teams each
finished fourth in the Centennial
Conference Championships hosted by
Johns
on
Hopkins
University
Saturday.
The fourth place finish was a twospot improvement for the men from
their sixth place finish last year and
the best finish in the program since
2006. The women finished fifth in last
year's championship and were just
three points shy of overtaking
Haverford for third.
For the men, John McMinn 'l3 and
Jacob Philips 'l3 led the Garnet, finishing 21st and 22nd consecutively
with times of 25:57 and 25:58.
Robert Fain 'l4 completed a top 30
finish with a time of 26:12 for a 29th
place. Finishing up the scoring for the
men were Bill King 'l3 (27:00) with a
45th-place finish and Chris Wickham
'l2 (27:01) with a 46th-place finish.
Patrick Hartnett 'll ran 27:06 to finish in 47th, and Richard Scott 'l4 finished two seconds behind Hartnett for
48th.
On the women's side, Emma Saarel
'l4 once again led the Garnet, finishing 13th with a time of 22:39. Saarel
was closely followed by Hannah Rose
'l2, Swarthmore's top scorer last season, who came in at a time of 22:50 to
finish 16th. Also with a top 20 finish
was Becky Painter 'l3 with a time of
23:10 for 20th place.
Rounding out the scoring for
Swarthmore were Rebecca Hammond
'l3, who finished 23rd with a time of
23:12 and Isabel Newlin 13 at 24:08 for
a 35th-place finish.
Caitlin Russell 'll ran 24:15 for a
38th-place finish and Rebecca Woo 'll

High expectations as swim teams begin
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS

aapostol@swarthmore. edu

The Swarthmore Garnet men's and
women's swim teams come into the 20102011 season under very different circumstances but with a shared drive to win and
focus on the here and now.
The men's team is coming off a fourthconsecutive second place finish at the
Centennial Conference Championship
meet, where they were just over 100 points
behind first-place Franklin & Marshall. The
team returns largely intact with the same
strong core of swimmers that got them so
close in 2010.
The women's team, on the other hand, is
looking to improve upon a disappointing
fifth-place finish at last year's Conferences
while attempting to fill the shoes of Anne
Miller 'lO, a seven-time All-American who
medaled in both the 100 and 200 butterfly
(taking gold in the 200) and who holds the
school records in all distance freestyle and
butterfly races.
Head coach Sue Davis, who will begin
her 27th season at the helm of both men's
and women's teams, is on sabbatical in the
fall, so her position will be temporarily
filled by assistant coach Casmera Wick.
Wick begins her second year with
Swarthmore and provides a strong figure to
take the lead until Davis' return.
On the men's side, hopes are high and
with good reason. Only three members of
last year's team, Michael Ahn, Reid
Wilkening and Danny Friel were lost to
graduation, and a large percentage of the
Swarthmore swimmers seen in the finals of
last year's Conferences belong to the classes of 2012 and 2013.
Tyler Hanson, a versatile sophomore,
will be looking to build off an impressive
freshman campaign which saw him reach
the finals in three events, medaling in two,
while posting the team's top time in the 400
IM. Charlie Hepper, Daniel Duncan, Roger
Chin, and Jacob Benveniste round out an
impressive sophomore class that combined
to win four individual medals last year.
Difference-makers among the upperinclude
senior
Sterling
classmen
Satterfield and senior captain Santiago
Lombo, and juniors Neil Palmer, Tim
Brevart, Lance Liu, Sam Bullard-Sisken
and junior captains Dante Fuoco and

Travis Pollen. Satterfield is pegged to be
one of the very top breaststrokers in the
Centennial this year after turning in
bronze and silver medal winning performances in the 100 and 200, respectively
Liu made a name for himself in the
breaststroke events as well, making the
finals in both distances. Fuoco is a solid IM
swimmer who placed in the top eight in
both the 200 and 400, and Bullard-Sisken
won a bronze medal in the 100 backstroke
while placing fourth in the 200.
Brevart, Lombo and Palmer are established competitors in sprint freestyle
events, which is an area in which Pollen
says there willbe improvement this season.
"Last year we brought in great distance
swimmers and were able to place really
highly at Conferences in the longer events,"
Pollen said. "This year, we're focusing on
improving in the sprints, because that's
where you earn a lot of points, especially
for relays."
Pollenhas gathered much attention over
the past few seasons as one of the true feelgood success stories of collegiate athletics.
An above-knee amputee, Pollen won the 50meter freestyle at Paralympic Nationals in
2010, breaking a six-year-old American
record in the 100-yard freestyle in his disability class. While turning in times at
Swarthmore that many able-bodied swimmers envy, Pollen keeps an optimistic and
ambitious eye on his future.
"I'm hoping to break one or two more
national records this year, either in
December at the Swarthmore Invitational
or at the Conference championships," he
said of his season goals. "After the college
season is over, I'll keep training for Spring
Nationals in April in Minneapolis. I'm hoping my times there will earn me a spot on
the World Championship team this coming
summer!"

In addition to this exceptionally strong
core of returning swimmers, the Garnet
men also boast a large new crop of freshmen. "We have something close to a dozen
first-years," Pollen says. "We'll definitely
see a lot of them make an impact right
away. The youngsters are probably in the
best shape out of any of us on the team, so
we're definitely going to rely on them early
on as the rest of us whip our butts back into
shape."

As for specific members of the class of

2014 who are expected to make a difference,
Pollen advises Garnet fans to "look out for
John Flaherty and Peter Ballen to make big
splashes in the shorter freestyle events,
Stan Le in the breaststroke and Brian
Nadel in distance free."
On the women's side, there is a distinct
air of determination and optimism despite
the hole left by Miller. Senior captain
Allison Bishop, while acknowledging the
huge impact that Miller made, is quick to
move the focus to the present.
"Anne Milleris a spectacular person and
one that I completely look up to and admire
and I know that feeling is shared among
many of my teammates
So yes, we will
miss her," said Bishop, an outstanding distance swimmer whose performances in the
1000 and 1650-yard freestyle last year were
second on the team only to Miller.
"But we have people ready and willing
to step into her footprints and I'm confident
that we're going to have a great season even
with last year's beloved captain [gone],"
Bishop added. "Are they difficult shoes to
fill? Sure. And I don't expect any one person
to completely fill her position on the team.
That being said, I believe that the team is
strong this year, and that we will be able to
our graduating senfill the holes left by
...

...

iors."

The team also lost Claire Shelden and
Casey Osborne to graduation, both accomplished swimmers who made strong show-

ings at Conferences.
Sophomore Hannah Gotwals, who showcased great versatility in her freshman season and is expected to become a core member of this year's team, agreed with
Bishop's sentiments. "We'll definitely miss
everything Anne brought to the pool, both
through her swimming and personality. I'll
personally miss having her and Casey
Osborne to race in the butterfly," she said.
"However, we're a deep team this year. We

have some very strong swimmers in all our
events, and if we work hard, we have a good
chance at an even better season than last

year."
In addition to Bishop and Gotwals, the
Garnet women return several strong contributors, including seniors Sarah
Bedolfe, Chelsea Brett, Melinda Neal and
Stephanie Su, juniors Jackie Scala,

Rosalie Lawrence, Naomi Glassman and
Amelia Possanza, and sophomores

were finalists at last year's Conferences,
with Gotwals pulling in a bronze medal in
the 200 butterfly. Bishop, Scala, Possanza,
Call, Bedolfe, Stevens, Brett, Su, and Neal
all made the "B" finals in at least one event
last year and will undoubtedly be hungry
for the top eight.
Lawrence and Su are both strong breaststrokers, and Scala posted the team's top
times last year in both the 100"and 200 backstroke.
The team will add ten new swimmers,
including two members of the sophomore
class, Michael-Anne Myrvang and Jeewon
Kim. "They're an enthusiastic group," said
Bishop of the incoming swim class, 'and
I'm impressed by the work ethic I see in
them. The caliber of the women coming up
is spectacular."
Gotwals echoed her captain's enthusiasm towards the new members. "I don't
think there's really any of them that I
wouldn't look out for," she said. "They've
impressed me quite a bit."
Overall, both Garnet teams hope to be
successful in the Centennial Conference
throughout the winter and set themselves
up for head-turning performances at the
championship meet.
The men are in good position to take
that next step and secure their first-ever
championship. The women are hoping to
defy expectations and put up a surprise season. "With so many fresh faces as well as
many people coming back from last year, I
see tiiis year as one where we move up in

the rankings. I want to see our women dropping time, winning meets and coming
together as a fast and united team one to
be reckoned with," Bishop said.

teams opened the season

victory.

When Sophia Ferguson 11 found
the back of the net with three minutes
remaining in last Wednesday's.field
hockey match with Haverford, it was
Swarthmore's only goal in an 8-1 loss.
But that goal epitomized Ferguson's

entire career on the field.
In practice and whenever the clock
began to run in her 55 career matches,
Ferguson battled, worked and con-

stantly learned. Every day, she fought

for the honor ofher teammates, coaches, herself, and the name across the
chest ofher jersey.
Entering the 2010 season with 14
players and only four players with
more than a year of college experience, Ferguson and her fellow seniors
knew that they needed to lead not only
through their talk but also through
their play.
Ferguson led the team in scoring,
tallying career highs in goals (9),
assists (6), and points (24). In the

Garnet's six wins this year, Ferguson
had the game-winner in three.
"Her work ethic over the last four
years has been tremendous," said
Lauren Fuchs, who has worked with
Ferguson across her college career,
the last three years as Swarthmore's
head coach.
"[Ferguson] has improved each
and every year with different skills,
and I think that she has been a
tremendous leader for us because she
led by example and you can't give
enough praise for that," Fuchs added.
During the 2010 season, Ferguson

sometimes found herself frustrated as
Swarthmore implemented a new zonemarking system and intricate attack
based off of sharp cuts. But that frustration wasn't resistance to change;
instead, it was born out of the desire
to understand and advance her individual play even quicker in order to
help her young teammates and
improve on the field.
That intensity and desire translated into tenacity in games, with

perfecting

skills that the team had focused on in
the practices leading up to each
match. In the season opener, a 5-0 win
over Immaculata, Ferugson had her
first career hat-trick, the third goal
coming on a perfectly executed tip
after the team had focused on tipping
the day before in practice.
Against Haverford in her final
home match, Ferguson and the Garnet
were stymied by the Fords defense for
the first 66 minutes of the match. But
trailing 8-0, Ferguson refused to give
in, leading the Swarthmore on a
counter attack with Nia Jones 14.
Jones sprinted onto a ball in the
right corner and sent a cross to the
front of the net where Ferguson was
there to score one of the prettiest goals
for the Garnet all season long. It was a
fitting end for Swarthmore's final
home match in the team's most successful season since 2007 one part of
the bright future of the team setting
up the senior one last time.
Ferguson ended her career with 19
goals and 12 assists for 50 points.
In each of her final two games at
Clothier Field, Ferguson scored the
lone Swarthmore goal. On Senior Day

THE PHOENIX

against Gettysburg, Ferguson, playing
in front of her parents for just the
fourth time in her career, tied the
game at one late in the first halfbefore
the Bullets went on to win the match
2-1
In both of those matches, Ferguson
was all over the turf, painting Clothier
Field with her determined cuts and
innovative runs to create scoring
opportunities. Hobbled by a stress
fracture in her right shin, Ferguson
left nothing on the field, chasing down
loose balls, forcing turnovers and
leading the Garnet attack both with
her play and with her enthusiasm.
"[Ferguson's] leadership was key
to our team's success this year," said
Sophia Agathis 13, who led the team
with seven assists. "Her intensity was
contagious. Even though she finished
the season with a serious injury, there
was never a game or practice where
Sophia didn't come ready to play with
[everything she had]. Her efforts on
and off the field were an integral part
of our teams improvement this

season."
Fuchs was amazed by Ferguson's
ability to play through the stress fracture. "She never complained and still
gave 200 percent on the hockey field in

games and in practice. To me, that's

incredible."
As a senior captain, Ferguson was
always a rock on the field, especially
during the most trying moments in
games. After an opponent goal,
Ferguson would urge the team to
respond, encouraging "Right now,

Swat," or "Next five minutes."
Game in and game out, Ferguson
battled with her head held high,
regardless of the score or time remaining, treating the opportunity to wear
the garnet and white as an privilege.
Ferguson and her fellow seniors
Katie Ashmore, Hadley Roach, and
Devon Novotnak
leave the team in
a promising position hardly imaginable after the team won just one
Centennial Conference match in both
2008 and 2009.
Ashmore finishes her career with
goaltending wins in 18 of the 22
Swarthmore victories during her four
years in the cage including two
shutouts.
Roach, a catalyst in the Garnet
midfield, finishes with four goals and
nine points, and Novotnak, the speedy
and creative defensive midfielderand
one of the stars on the Garnet corner
unit, ends her time at Swarthmore
with seven goals and 10 assists for 24
points.

After

on

Saturday to end a 3-1 loss at Franklin

team, Ferguson, head held high,

the year so successful.
"I am going to miss Sophia's competitiveness and intensity next year.
I've always looked to her to keep
myself accountable and make sure I'm
working as hard as I can," Agathis

said.
"She's just so passionate about the
game," Fuchs said. "Everything she

did was about the team's success. I'm

really going to miss her leadership

and all of her hard work and effort
next year."
After Saturday's match, Ferguson

was completely drained, having left
everything that she had on the field
one last time. Sweat and a few tears
dripped onto her Garnet jersey for the
final time. The end of a stellar career.

Men's soccer honors seniors, defeats rival Haverford

What a way to end the regular
season.
Playing in front of its largest home
crowd in recent
memory, the
Swarthmore men's soccer team shut
out Haverford 2-0 on Saturday to complete
an
unbeaten
Centennial
Conference schedule and knock their
rivals out of the Centennial playoffs.
Over 1,000 fans packed the garnet
and gray stands at Clothier Field for
Senior Night as the Garnet, after honoring Philippe Celestin 'll, Morgan
Langley 'll and Gage Newman 'll, beat
the Fords for the seventh consecutive
time.
"There is a reason why we don't typically lose at home and it's because we
have the best fans in the Centennial
Conference," head coach Eric Wagner
said. "They are loud, funny, enthusiastic and always at the games regardless
of the weather. I'm thrilled that we had
such a great crowd Saturday and it was
really a great atmosphere."
Langley continued his stellar year,
scoring both Garnet goals, the first in
the final minutes of the first half of
play off a Kieran Reichert 'l3 corner
kick. Langley found himself free in the
box to deliver a well-struck header into
the back of the net.
With just over two minutes remaining in the match, Langley iced the
game, executing a perfect give and go
with Celestin and beating Haverford's
keeper Nick Kahn.

to the success in the final three regular
season matches. "We made very minor
adjustments and reminders to the
defenders and just said listen: defense
is an important part of why we are successful. Don't neglect it and it will
make things the other way that much
easier."
The Garnet defense had one of its
best matches of the year in last
Wednesday's win over Muhlenberg,
shutting out two of the Centennial's
most dynamic scorers in Cody
Antonini and Mike Williams.
