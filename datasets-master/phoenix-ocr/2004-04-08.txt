New dorm open house draws hundreds
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY TERESA KELLEY
tkelleyl@swarthmore.edu
Over 200 students visited the unfinished
new dorm during Monday's open house to
catch a glimpse of what some hope will be their
home in the fall. With 75 beds available, only a
small portion of the open-house attendees
would be able to live in the new dorm.
Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
said she was confident the dorm would be in
high demand in the upcoming housing lottery.
"We're talking seniors choosing one-room doubles," Westphal said.
Westphal predicted a large number of block
applications for the new dorm. "People who get
the blocks will feel like they've won the lottery," Westphal said.
The purpose of the open house was to give
students a chance "see views and get an idea for
room size," Associate Vice President for
Facilities Management Stuart Hain said.
Most of those who visited were enthusiastic
about the new dorm.
"It's new. It'll be clean and not broken,"
Sally Hall 'O6 said.
Stephanie Chuang 'O7 was not interested in

trying to live in the new dorm during its inaugural year. "I don't want to risk not having
somewhere to live," she said. She is looking at
Hallowell for next year but considers the new
dorm a possibility for her junior or senior
years.

Although it is his first choice, Jeff Schneider
'O5 worried that, if the new dorm did not open
on time, "I'll be living in the Media Inn, which
is revolting," he said. "It's a definite risk."
Others were less concerned about the prospect
of living in temporary housing if the new dorm is
not finished in time. "It'll be exciting," Sabrina
Danielsen 'O7 said. Stephanie Koskowich 'O7

called the possibility "an adventure."

Delia Kulukundis Phoenix Staff

open-house tour.

Alexis Reedy 'O5, who had already turned in
her housing application for the new dorm, was
equally flexible when faced with the possibility
of spending the first weeks of her senior year

living in a hotel off campus. "I'm rooming with
friends, so I'd just be in a hotel with my
friends," Reedy said.
Westphal said some students were trying to
"talk down" the dorm in an effort to improve
their chances of living in the new building. "We
have the smartest people in America, and
they're all trying to think of angles," she said.
First-years will not be housed in the new
dorm next year because construction may not
finish in time for orientation week. Westphal
was confident the dorm would open Aug. 27, in
timefor returning students to move in, but said
public spaces would still need finishing touches. The courtyard will not be landscaped, and
the lounges may need painting.
"What the weather does to us in the next
month will determine a lot," Hain said. "If the
weather is nice, we'll finish ahead of schedule. If
the weather is bad, we'll use every day between
then and now." In addition, Hain said, the construction team is considering increasing workday hours from the current 7-a.m.-to-3:30-p.m.
schedule in order to ensure a timely opening.

How it will look
Hard hat-clad members of the construction

team were stationed on each floor at the new
dorm's open house to answer questions and
help students visualize what the dorm would
look like once it was finished.
"You can kind of see it now, but not yet,"
field superintendent Craig Ervine said. The
most dramatic change from the current cinderblock, steel-beamed and puddle-spotted structure will be the first-floor welcome lounge,

Ervine said.
In its finished state, the lounge will have

high, wood ceilings, a quarry-tile floor, warmtoned red walls, tall windows and a large staircase with ornamental handrail leading up to an
overlooking balcony on the second floor. Hain
said wireless Internet was also being considered for this space.

Accident under investigation as victim remains in hospital
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
ldremeal@swarthmore.edu
A three-vehicle accident at North Chester Road and
Oakdale Place sent all six passengers involved to the hospital last Wednesday and severely injured Kevin Lull 'O6,
who is undergoing treatment for a cracked skull, broken
jaw, broken cheekbone and punctured lung at Crozer
Chester Medical Center.
A Honda Accord, carrying Lull, Tyler Lyson 'O6, Matt
Boulay and Bev Nalven, was heading from campus to an
event for Philip Evans scholars. It made a left turn from

North Chester Road onto Oakdale Place toward the

Baltimore Pike, but it did not stop to let the oncoming
Chevrolet Suburban, which was heading down North
Chester Road, pass first.
As the Accord turned left, the Suburban smashed into
its right side, near the back passenger door above the
wheel.
Lull was sitting in the spot where the Suburban hit,
according to Swarthmore borough police Office Joseph G.

Maginnis.
The Accord passengers

two Evans scholars and two

adults who work for the Kohlberg Foundation, which
funds the program

and the two Suburban passengers

were all pinned. The Suburban knocked over a tree and
moved 15 feet up onto a lawn, Maginnis said, and the
Accord spun around.
Only Lull remains in the hospital. He is no longer in a
coma but is medically sedated, according to Chrissy
Constant 'O7, a friend who has spoken with Lull's family
members. Constant said in an e-mail that "their major concern is the swelling in his head, as he has a cracked skull,
THE PHOENIX

however, they've managed to stop the bleeding."
Lull, who is the intensive care unit, is breathing on his
own and responds by squeezing his mother's hand when
she holds his.
Constant said only immediate family members were
allowed to visit Lull but that students might be able to
speak with relatives at the hospital.
Plants are not allowed in the room, Constant said, so "if
students are looking for a way to show theirsupport, cards
would be best. Currently, he's still listed as critical but stable and seems to be improving everyday."
Another Honda that was stopped on Oakdale Place was
hit on the front end, but its driver was not injured.
An ambulance took Lull to Crozer Chester Medical
Center's trauma center, according to the Web site of the
Springfield Fire Company.
The driver of the Suburban was evacuated to
University of Pennsylvania trauma center by a helicopter
that landed on Cunningham Field, where he was treated
for head trauma.
Lyson, who had been sitting in the back seat with Lull,
dislocated his shoulder and suffered a cut.
He was sent to Springfield Hospital, along with Boulay,
Nalven and the passenger of the Suburban, who was treated for an ankle injury. Lyson was released the next day.
The accident occurred at 6:06 p.m. last Wednesday,
March 3L Maginnis said the Swarthmore police department
was on the scene within two minutes.
Assisting were the police departments of Nether
Providence and Springfield, the fire companies of
Swarthmore, Springfield and South Media, and ambulances from Swarthmore, Springfield and Media.
Firefighters remained on the scene until 8:40 p.m.

Kevin Lull was in the back right seat of a Honda Accord
that was hit by a Chevrolet Suburban last Wednesday.
"It was a mess. It was a real mess," Maginnis said. "You
don't tangle with a Suburban when you're driving a little

Honda Accord."

He said he had not seen an accident in Swarthmore that
had sent six people to the hospital in 20 years as a police
officer. But the location at Oakdale Place and North
Chester Road is not particularly vulnerable to accidents,
Maginnis said.
Maginnis is investigating, and the Delaware County
Criminal Investigations Division is in charge of accident
reconstruction.

said, but the architects opted
to revise this standard to give
the new dorm a unique facade.
Vals quartzite is also a

more easily into regular
blocks, making it a more efficient building material.
Decisions regarding furniture and paint colors will be
made before students leave for
the summer.
the
color
Although
schemes have not been finalized, Hain said the hallways
would probably be two-toned.
One side of the hallway would

be non-traditional off-white,
while the other wall would be
painted gray.

Environment-friendly dorm
Efforts were made to use
"green" methods when building the new dorm, according to
Hain. The construction team
has been conscious of recycling building materials whenever possible.
Fly ash was used in the
cement cinderblocks of the
building, recycling this coalcombustion byproduct into
usable building material
while ecreasing the need for

traditional cement components and the fossil fuel-powered energy needed to
process them.

Each room will have individual temperature controls to
reduce energy waste.
In addition, the finished
dorm will have a "green

roof," a project originally
planned for the
Science
Center but cut due to cost and

structural concerns, according to engineering professor

Carr Everbach.
The roof for the third floor
of the new dorm was designed
by Jorg Bruening, a green-roof

specialist from Germany.
Sedums, a perennial plant,
will grow in a crushed-pumicelike matrix.
The roof will reduce the
volume and lessen the acidity
of storm water that flows into
Cram Creek.
Everbach said the green
roof will also lower the temperature on the surface of the
roof and reduce air-conditioning costs in the building.

The college currently has a
green roof on a storage shed
behind Papazian.
The storage, built in 2003,
cost $600,000, according to
Everbach.

alternative medication providers.
"CVS was not small or flexible enough
to accommodate our desire to have students not pay the full amount out of
pocket and have to wait for the reimbursement," she said.
Now, Swarthmore's insurer, Mutual
of Omaha Insurance Company, is looking to Genuardi's as a possible participant in the arrangement for collegeinsured students.
But, according to Echols, the
process of forming partnerships with
pharmacies takes time, particularly
for plans as small as this one, which
benefits only the 400 or so students
insured by Swarthmore's plan.
Omaha's representative in charge
of Swarthmore's account was unavailable for comment.
"I haven't heard of anyone experiencing this hardship yet," Echols said,
"but I am sure I will soon."
For the time being, Worth has
emergency supplies of sample prescription drugs, but it does not otherwise have a contingency plan, she
said.
Students interviewed did not know
the details of prescription payment or
were not part the Swarthmore plan.
"I've never taken advantage of [the
20 percent co-pay plan] because I didn't
know about it. When I get sick I go to
Worth and they give me the medicine I
need for free. That's already a pretty
good service for students," Mark Cho

'O6 said.

Swarthmore's medical insurance

plan covers drugs when prescribed by
physicians for the purpose of treating
sickness or injury. Students are provided with $6OO maximum for prescription
drugs.
They can pay $5 in co-payments for
generic prescription drugs and $lO for
brand-name drugs, according to
Omaha's pamphlet.

Ville reacts to Michael's closure
The closing of the pharmacy will
also significantly affect life for Ville

residents.

Jack McDonnell, the owner of
Michael's, decided to close the pharma-

cy to cut down on the hours needed to
run the business, which sometimes ran
more than 60 a week, Swarthmore
Mayor Eck Gerner said. With the presence of large chain pharmacies, the
"opportunity to expand the business
was just not there," he added.
According to Gerner, McDonnell
will work at the CVS Pharmacy on
Chester Road, where the Michael's customer prescription records were sent,

to aid in the transfer ofrecords.
"My understanding is that sometime after this transition, [McDonnell]
is going to go to a CVS training center
locally
and will be reassigned to
another CVS somewhere" to work,
...

Gerner said.

"We're heartbroken
I
think the town will miss
the store more than
they ever thought of."
Marcia Bloom
Swarthmore resident
...

There have been several "different

parties who've expressed interest in"
using the former Michael's building,
Gerner said, but he would not name
which businesses where interested in
the properties.
"We want to try very hard to get a
store in there that's good at what it's
supposed to do," Gerner said, adding
that he would like to see a business
that provides "a good or service that
provides incentive for people to stop."

Goods and services that were provided by Michael's are being picked
up by other Ville businesses.
The Cheese Court now sells The
Philadelphia Inquirer and other newspapers that the pharmacy used to
carry, according to Gerner. It is also
looking to buy the pharmacy's license
to sell tickets for the Pennsylvania
Lottery.

Ville residents expressed sadness
over the loss of Michael's.
"We're heartbroken, but we understand Jack's need to cut back," resident Marcia Bloom said. "I think the
town will miss the store more than
they ever thought of. We take things
for granted. We don't realize how
much we use something until it's

gone."
"It's a great loss for us just because
of Jack being great," Kelly Caulfield of
the Swarthmore Flower Shop said.
"I would always take my children
there when they were sick
It was
like the five-and-dime stores I used to
go to when I was growing up,"
Caulfield said. "It will be greatly,
greatly missed," Caulfield said.
"I think it's a shame for
Swarthmore residents
I just hope a
unique business goes in there to keep
the flavor of Swarthmore," resident
Carol DeGuilio said. "I think the people here will miss it. I know I will."
"One of the things I think made
Swarthmore really great was having a
pharmacy and having a pharmacist
like Jack," Gerner said. But, he added,
"I think it's kind of exciting to have a
new business."

Students warned of noise from Parrish renovations

BY CHRISTINA TEMES

ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

Students thinking

of picking

into

Parrish have been warned of possible noise
and inconveniences from renovations set

to begin this summer.

Director of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal, Senior Project Manager Chas
Ricciardi and Manager for Advancement
Information Systems Mimi Geiss were on
hand Tuesday afternoon in Parrish
Parlours to present building plans and
address concerns of those interested in living in Parrish next year.

"The health center gives
out free earplugs, so folks
may be heading down
there to get [some]."
Myrt Westphal
director of residential life
The construction will take place weekdays from 7 a.m. until 3:30 p.m., with the
loudest noise between mid-September
andmid-October, according to Ricciardi.
During this time, a four-story tall stone
wall in the center section of Parrish will
be demolished to allow for a new structuring system to be built from the lower

level.
Ricciardi said that, compared with the
west side of Parrish, the east side will not be
as significantly affected by noise, since most
of the construction on that wing will be complete by the end of summer. It may experience more noise from traffic, which could
begin between 6:30 and 7 a.m.
Because the wall is in the middle of
Parrish, rooms closest to the center of the

the brunt of the
construction noise.
A temporary partition will provide
sound insulation but will not entirely block
the noise. Ricciardi described the sound as
comparable to "a small jackhammer pounding on a rock" and said "it could be some

real chipping," depending on how hard it is
to take down the wall.
"It's going to be an early-morning activity," Westphal said. "People picking in
should expect it to start early and end
early, but no night or weekend work."
Plastic sheeting and fans will also
remove dust, though "some blowback is
possible," Ricciardi said.
The work will limit storage space, as
well. "All storage [in Parrish] has to be
cleared out for the summer," Westphal
said.

Ricciardi said there might also be brief
shutdowns in water or power but that such
shutdowns would be announced well in
advance.
Since the fifth-floor lounge will no
longer be in use, rooms 401 and 400 will be
used as lounges. One will house a television, and the other will have computers,

according to Ricciardi. Westphal added
that rooms on the third floor might also be
used as lounges, though this would depend
on demand for housing.
Elevators will eventually be installed
but will not be operational until the fall of
said. According to
2005, Ricciardi
Westphal, students will be able to use the
existing dumbwaiters to get their belongings up to their rooms.
Westphal also noted that "during winter
break, some work could potentially be done
in rooms." Ricciardi said this could include
work with new power and data wiring,
which will begin this summer. Because of
this work, Mertz will house international
students and athletes who must return
early from winter break.

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES
More than 500 college mathematics
professors from 125 major universities throughout the country will
formally express their concern about the rising cost of textbooks by
issuing a joint call to action today in Schoenberg Quad at the
University of California at Los Angeles.
The event is coordinated by the California Student Public
Interest Research Group, a group that has been working to shed
light on increasing textbook costs since January.
According to CALPIRG, Thomson Learning has refused to take
simple steps to reduce the cost of textbooks, or even recognize that
there is a problem.
Merriah Fairchild, CALPIRG's higher education program advocate, said the group is trying to put pressure on publishers to
release new editions only when necessary, or release supplementary material containing new information.
A report released by CALPIRG in January argued that textbook
publishers release unjustified new editions and add useless features to drive up the price of textbooks.
The report cites what it considers unnecessary new editions of a
calculus book published by Thomson Learning. The newest edition
was reportedly released without any significant changes made to
the content of the book.
Representatives of the company have said they are taking steps
to reduce costs of textbooks for students.
In February, Thomson Learning announced a new line of books
called the Advantage Series will be available to students, starting
in the summer of 2004. The company has said these books will cost
25 percent less than the hardcover books it produces for the same

common misconception about the
Fulbright was that one has to be

Professor Ronald Miech, vice-chairman of the UCLA mathematics department, said professors do not have a choice when it comes
to introducing new editions to students, because in large classes
like calculus it is important that all students have uniform books.
Miech added that he supports CALPIRG's efforts because he has
noted that many textbook prices seem to be on the high side.
To make progress with publishers, CALPIRG is also sponsoring
a state bill that would prevent publishers from constantly increas-

Parents of slain activist recall daughter's life
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY CAROLINE GRUBBS
cgrubbsl@s warthmore.edu
Craig and Cindy Corrie spoke to students Thursday about their daughter's
death last year under the blades of an Israeli
bulldozer.
Rachel Corrie, an American peace
activist, died last March in Rafah, located in
Israel's West Bank, while protesting the
destruction ofPalestinian homes.
Her parents now travel the world to
speak about their daughter's life and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Rachel's cousin
Emily Robbins 'O7 said in an introduction to
the lecture.

"Rachel believed that her
activism would speed an
end to the conflict."
Cindy Corrie
"In even the most devastating situations,
we are able to carry on," Cindy Corrie said.
"Rachel wanted so much for the information she was gathering to get out there.
Rachel would hope that we listen to each
other and think critically about this issue,"
she added.
Cindy spoke of her daughter's life and
association with human rights activism. In
the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, Rachel
became involved with peace groups in her
hometown of Olympia, Wash.
"Rachel's response to 9/11 was to become
a peace activist," Cindy said. "She questioned the role and impact of her country in
the world and the role and impact ofherself
in the world."

To that end, Rachel became involved
with the International Solidarity Movement
and decided to protest the destruction of
Palestinian homes in the West Bank and
Gaza strip.
"Rachel believed that her non-violent
activism would speed an end to the conflict," her mother said.
Rachel was aware it was a dangerous
area but believed foreign nationals would
not be harmed. She left for Rafah in
January 2003 and lived with the Nasrallah

family for two months, learning Arabic,
sleeping in front of wells to protect them
from demolition and documenting the
destruction of Palestinian homes.
"No amount of reading, attendance at
conferences, documentary viewing and
word of mouth could have prepared me for
the reality of the situation here," Rachel
wrote in an e-mail to her family Feb. 7, a

month before she died.
"I feel like I am witnessing the systematic destruction of people's ability to survive.
It's incredibly horrifying," she said in a film
recorded two days before her death.
In September, six months after their
daughter's death, Craig and Cindy traveled
to Rafah to visit the people Rachel had met,
to learn more about the conflict and to continue to seek justice for Rachel's death.
In Rafah, Cindy and Craig met the
Nasrallah family as well as other ISM volunteers, the ambulance drivers that Carried
Rachel to the hospital and several Israeli

anti-demolition activists.
"We're still trying to find out what happened," Craig said of Rachel's death.
The Corries and their congressman have
proposed a bill that asks for an independent
investigation into the incident, Craig said.
The Israeli government conducted an investigation thatresulted in discrepancies about

the cause of Rachel's death, including the
claim that she was killed by rubble instead
of directly by a bulldozer.
"I think the Israelis believe their own
report," Craig said, but the Corries are hoping for a more conclusive, independent
investigation.
"I thought [the lecture] was extremely
informative," Peter Holm 'O7 said. "There
was an element of they felt they had to continue their daughter's work."

Palestinians recount college days
BY CAROLINE

GRUBBS

cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu

Delays at checkpoints, school closures and

restrictive curfews were just a few of the obstacles
speakers Reem Wahdan and Yasser Darwish faced
while they were students at Birzeit Univeristy in

Palestine.
Wahdan and Darwish spoke to Swarthmore students on Monday about the trials of going to college
under the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
"Palestinians have always valued education as a
way to overcome the conflict," Wahdan said.
Education has become increasingly difficult in
occupied territory since the late 1980s due to periods where the Israeli army closed schools, Wahdan
said.
Birzeit University was closed from 1987 to 1992,
interrupting Darwish's education. "It was very difficult for us," he said. "We virtually lost four and a
half years."
Even when Birzeit was open, travel to and
from the nearest city of Ramallah was difficult,
Wahdan said. Students, faculty and staff were frequently detained at checkpoints on the way to
Birzeit.
"You cannot imagine the kind of inferiority they
want you to feel at checkpoints," Wahdan said.
"When you go to a checkpoint, you don't know
what to expect."
The delays often made students late for or
absent from class. Wahdan said that, when she told
a solider at the checkpoint she had to get to an
exam, "He said, 'I know you have an exam, and

you're not going.'"
University life was further interrupted by damage from shell fire. Israeli soldiers also wrote offensive graffiti on walls and broke photocopying
machines, Darwish said. Students were often

According to Wahdan, students at Birzeit led
active lives on campus. "We have social activities
like cinema club, media club, student council,
drama groups and a campus newspaper. It's a
lively place. Everyone knows everyone, and the

Darwish encouraged students to visit Palestine
so they could judge the situation firsthand. "I hope
that some of you in the future come and study at
Birzeit University so you can see the reality of
what is happening," he said.
Around 10 students attended the lecture.
Organizer Saed Atshan 'O6 attributed the low
turnout to the event being scheduled during
Passover.
"I found it useful and interesting," Bernadette
Baird-Zars 'O6 said. "I will be studying in Damascus
next year, so it was particularly relevant to my situation." But she noted that "they tended to stick to
one side of the discourse."
"I think it was both relevant and revelatory,"
Alec Armstrong 'O7 said. "It was really interesting
trying to imagine myself not being able to go to
Swarthmore because the army wouldn't let me."
Students Against the Occupation organized the
lecture as "a way to expose Swatties to college students in another part of the world and how difficult
it is to pursue higher education under occupation,"
Atshan, a SATO member, said.
Wahdan recently graduated from Birzeit with
degrees in journalism and political science, and
Darwish is a graduate student at Birzeit studying
international affairs.
Wahdan and Darwish are members of Faculty
for Israeli-Palestinian Peace, an organization that
seeks to end the occupation and achieve peace in
the region.

He noted that the Corries had not spoken
much about the greater Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. "The entire point of the presentation was to talk about Rachel," Camacho
said.
Alec Armstrong 'O7 said the most interesting part of the presentation was the
Corries talking about their tour. "They were
conscious of not trying to demonize the
Israeli people, and I thought that was good
of them," Armstrong said.
The lecture was sponsored by Students
Against the Occupation as a way to "bring

Lecture gives way to drama in acting thesis

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Senior theater majors and outside director develop and perform "The Pilot's Thumb," based on "Macbeth"
where," Dingman
pretty frustrated."

BY EMILY GASSER

egasserl@swarthmore.edu
And I thought I was going to see a

lecture/demonstration. Despite its rather

dry billing, "The Pilot's Thumb" turned out
to be a thoroughly mind-bending performance piece, complete with body-snatching
witches, a magic tape recorder and dazzling lighting and sound effects.
"The Pilot's Thumb" was this year's acting honors thesis project, put on by seniors
Sam Dingman, Felicia Leicht, Audrey
Pernell and Adrienne Mackey. This is the
first year the theater department has had
acting majors in the honors program. In
the past, all honors majors have concentrated on directing, according to acting
chair Ulla Neuerburg-Denzer. Honors theater majors complete a thesis project

rather than

a conventional paper,
which Neuerburg-Denzer said was one of
the reasons some people decide to major in
theater. An outside examiner comes to
some rehearsals and then watches a perwriting

formance.
Usually, directing students get

a budget

to hire outside actors for them to direct.
This year, the four actors pooled their
budgets to hire a director. The process
started last spring. After talking to several
directors, they decided to hire Dan
Rothenberg '95, who suggested doing a
piece based on Shakespeare's "Macbeth."
The group started rehearsing last fall.

Its plan was for Dingman to play a security
guard watching a bank of screens that
would become possessed by the witches.
The actors worked with that premise all
semester, but "it didn't really go any-

said. "Everyone was

Returning from winter break, the
group scrapped the security guard idea
and moved
on to the supposed

"lecture/demonstration."

Dingman

described the premise they finally decided on. "I invite Audrey and Felicia and
Adrienne to be part of the lecture [on
'Macbeth'], and somewhere in the
swirling cosmos the witches hear that and
come and kill Audrey and Felicia and
Adrienne and take their bodies and then
kill me," he said.

"It was kind of 'Macbeth'
meets 'lnvasion of the
Body Snatchers.'"
Felicia Leicht 'O4
The stage at the performance was set
up as if for a lecture or panel discussion,
with a speaker's podium and a long table
with microphones. Audience members
were given programs announcing a series
of short talks, "conceived of and featuring

Sam Dingman, with guest speakers
Felicia Leicht, Audrey Pernell and
Adrienne Mackey." During his opening
remarks, Dingman's character, whom he
described as "a very pretentious acting
student who thinks ... he's going to be the
next big thing," announces that in preparation for his upcoming performance as
the title role in "Macbeth," he has invited

some fellow students to come speak about
Macbeth's relationship to the witches in
the play.
The three give their short lectures,
then have Dingman read a section of the
witches' dialogue into a tape recorder. He
leaves the stage and plays the tape, at first
just listening, then lip synching and finally reciting the words themselves as the
actors undergo an eerie transformation
from
selves
into
their
student
Shakespeare's weird sisters.
From there the play loses its coherence,
in terms of both time and plot. There are
scenes of Dingman's character asking
Leicht, Pernell and Mackey to take part in
the lecture, scenes where the witches kill
them and take over their bodies, and other
original situations interspersed with a few
taken directly from Shakespeare's text.
Certain scenes get replayed more than
once, and those that aren't are not present-

ed in chronological order.
"In the end, we had a script with the
'Macbeth' scenes pieced together and sort
of interwoven with our stuff," Leicht said.
"It was kind of 'Macbeth' meets 'lnvasion
of the Body Snatchers.'"
As inscrutable as it seems, there was a
method to the madness. Dingman's character parallels the character of Macbeth.
Both show hubris and are punished by the
witches for their presumption. "There was
this idea that [Dingman's character] was a
very prideful actor who knew beyond a
shadow of a doubt how to play Macbeth,"
Leicht said. "And the witches take that
opportunity to prove that to him, in the
worst way possible ... there was the theme
of 'pride goeth before a fall.'"

The temporal disorder was also linked
to their interpretation of the play. "Time
gets all screwed up," Dingman said. "The
result of the witches' magic is that things
come unstuck in time."
The actors also tried to experiment
with the idea of perception, which is how
the tape recorder got involved. The
recorder seems to control the action, with

scenes changing and characters reacting
on others' manipulation of the
recorder. This was all supposed to play
into the witches' absolute control of the
Sam/Macbeth character. "The magic is
that, once you take his voice, you have
him," Dingman said.
The cast also worked with ordinary scenarios to create an alternate reality. "We
worked with the idea of existing in a kind
of dream state where things kind of have
their own logic," Leicht said. "It was the
idea of having something ordinary that

based

would transition into the extraordinary." It
was this focus that lent the play much of its
creepy atmosphere.
Most of the play's material came from
improvisations created during rehearsal,
which the cast taped. "A tremendous
amount of the material that we ended up
using came out of those improvs," Leicht
said. Dingman added that there were
"hours and hours and hours of tape of
material that we came up with that are not
in the play."
"Mind-blowing" is the word he chose to
describe the process. "It opened doors in
my head that I didn't even know were
there. I'm not sure I can find my way
around the rooms behind those doors, but
at least I know they're there."

A sobering guide to the housing lottery
In the '6os, all the
hippies lived in ML and

Sobering Thoughts

did a lot, and we mean a
lot of acid and mushrooms. Today's MLers
talk about a lot of the
same things, like elves,
magic toads, warp zones
and all the colors of the
rainbow, but with capes
and coffee instead of tiedye and hallucinogens.
But if you aren't a levelfour grandmaster and
you haven't worn a cape
since Halloween in third

grade (sorry, we meant
cloak), then the tight-

knit community of ML
the housing lotmay not be for you. It's that time again
tery, also known as "pay your library fines before you
have to be a four-year resident of Willets." In true
Sobering Thoughts form, here's a great survival guide to
the chaos that is sure to ensue.
First, remember that your friends right now probably
won't be around senior year. By the time you leave here,
you will probably only be talking to three, maybe four people, max. Also, freshman, all these people who you think
are your best friends will drop you like a rock at the
prospect of a Willets triple. If you haven't done it before,
now is good time to rank each of your friends. A good
measure is their housing lottery number, how hot their
girlfriend is, and how likely she is to cheat on your friend
with you. Fo' shizzle, do the blocking thing, but don't block

8

in Willets. Aim high with your block, because, if you get it,
that will be your first cohort number. Blocking for Willets
is like buying advertising during the 2003 WNBA final a
complete waste of capital. But still, be realistic, sophomores. You won't get a four-block in Wharton, but the
lodges aren't a big stretch.
If you do try for a block, be thinking actively of a contingency plan, because, as with most people who aim high,
the majority of you will fail. Therefore, in a five-block, a
few side agreements with your preferred friends aren't a
bad idea. Here's the secret about five-blocks: Someone is
gonna get fucked if you guys miss it. For example, last
year, "anonymous friend" probably would have been stuck
in ML had we not gotten our quint in Roberts, but we did,
and all that was avoided. For everyone else, do what we
did. Pick the smelliest one of the bunch and memorize 10
words that sum up the most polite way to ditch him.
(Think of it as breaking up with your girlfriend after taking her out on a date. The longer you wait, the better.)
The most important question you will ever have to
answer at Swarthmore is where you want to live. This will
determine your general level of social acceptance (S.A.),
happiness (H) and odor (O). Starting clockwise from
Wharton on a scale of one to 10:
Wharton. S.A. 10, H. 10, O. 9.5 (decreases during honors
exams)

Parrish. S.A. 3 (the stairs), H. 3 (the stairs), O. 3 (Bob's
office at the bottom of the stairs)
Woolman. WTF.
Willets. S.A. 8 (freshmen will look up to you), H. 10
(freshmen will hook up with you), O. 1
Worth. S.A. 11 ('cause we're cool, man), H. 1 (life is
pain, wear some black), O. 5.5
Mertz. S.A. 10 (in dorm, 1 outside), H. 5 (the ML of cenApril 8,

tral campus), O. 10 (central air)

PPR. 10s all around if you're a sophomore; will be next
year's drunken paradise
Strath Haven. S.A. 1(they cut footbaU, man), H. 1 (they
cut football, man), O. 10 (at least my jock is clean)
ML. S.A. 10 (among the Druid elders), H. 10 (like
shroomin' all day long), O. (no comment)
Danawell. S.A. 5 (don't really know), H. 3 (inmates'
morale low), O. 6.834394 (this is boring)
Then comes the big week. You didn't get your block,

your number sucks, and did we mention your number
sucks? During the lottery, you also get a crush on Myrt

Westphal, only to learn Larry is a badass mother who will
go to great lengths to protect his booty (he is an economist,
after all). So, seniors, it'll be sweet, but take some shit to
throw at the top 10 numbers. Juniors, a few of you will get
screwed, a few of you won't. Some of you are thanking God

that you are RAs. Sophomores, sorry. It's gonna be terrible. It will be so terrible many of you will consider transferring. We didn't include the new dorm in our list because
it looks shitty. There seems to be little protection from the
weather, and there aren't many walls or windows. I hear
they decided to name itRacitiland (he gave Al Bloom a dollar). The best part of the lottery is when they run out of
rooms and they will run out of rooms. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha. At least 50 of you should start looking for a nice
bench or box to sleep under In the end, in the words of

Kelly O'Neil 'O5, "Fucking relax. You aren't on the streets,
and you go to a posh liberal arts college. Stop whining."

Not a handsome 'Prince'
EVA HOLMAN

eholman2@swarthmore.edu
Like "The Princess Diaries" and,
uh, that sequel to "The Princess
Diaries" that's supposed to come out
soon, "The Prince and Me," the story
of an ordinary girl's journey to royalty, has one motto: What you don't
have in reality, make up for in fantasy indulgence, big time. Aimed at
pre-adolescents, "The Prince and
Me" strives to capture its audience in
a modern-day storybook, one complete with a handsome prince and a
pro-higher-education moral. But the
contrived storyline, flat dialogue and
chemistry
mediocre
on-screen
between the two starring actors
makes this film one fairy tale you
wish had never come true.
If the message of the film is that
opposites attract, "The Prince and
Me" is hell-bent on making Paige
(Julia Stiles), a Wisconsin college
girl, and Eddie (Luke Mably), the
crown prince of Denmark, the couple
of the century. The first 10 minutes of
the film are devoted to scene cuts
between the two that enhance their
starkly different lives. He drag races
through Denmark in an expensive
car, a woman on each arm. She
dodges tractors on her way to college. From the outset, it is clear that
the two are destined to meet, and the
screen time leading up to that
moment is just filler. There's just one
problem. Neither of the characters is
likable enough for one to feel at all

invested in their romance.

Perhaps Paige would be more likable if the question, "Is she for real?"
didn't keep popping up. Everything
about her seems contrived. In practically her first breath, Paige mentions
that she always wanted to travel to

9

that she is solely careerdriven, and that her desire to get into
medical school is more important
than any urge she has to begin a
romance. Yet, as though she already
knew Eddie existed, Paige paints
herself as driven but secretly open to
love. Whatever Paige says is so obviously planted to serve the main plot
that when she complains about her
problems with her Shakespeare
class, one immediately knows that
the solution will be provided by
Eddie, even though they haven't met
yet. The woodenness of Paige's
expository scene only reinforces the
plot's transparency.
But, if nothing else, Paige is a
decent, principled person, which is
more than one can say for the Danish
crowned prince, Eddie. Rule one: If
your fairy tale features a prince,
make him somewhat likable, or at
least entertaining. Eddie's reason for
wanting to trek halfway across the
world? An ad he sees on TV for the
University of Wisconsin version of
"Girls Gone Wild." His whimsical
reason for a complete change in his
lifestyle illustrates perfectly one of
the most fundamental problems in
Europe,

"The Prince and Me"

the film fails

to give its characters any identifiable
incentive for their most sweeping

actions.

For example, a simple probing by

Paige's Shakespeare professor about

love in the play "Hamlet" has a profound effect on her while she is taking an oral exam. It causes Paige
mid-exam and in front of her entire
to realize aloud her feelings
class
for Eddie and race away to Europe,
her freshly-opened early acceptance

to Johns Hopkins Medical School
still lying on her dresser. Once in
Denmark, one glance at a world

globe (and all its complex ramifications) sends her running back to
America to pursue her dream of
becoming a doctor. Of course, there
are still greater mysteries to ponder
in "The Prince and Me," namely why
the prince falls for a girl whose best
demonstration of a sense ofhumor is
calling herself "the rain king of laundry."

Speaking of a sense of humor, perhaps the most tedious parts of the
movie were its attempts at comic
relief. Eddie's cheeky servant, forced
along to America to keep tabs on the
prince, supplies weak laughs as the
stuffy half of an odd-couple situation.
And Eddie's roommate's threats to
kill Eddie with his laser pointer if
Eddie eats "his meat" are worth far
less screen time than they are given.
The most frequent victims of unfunny jokes in this film are the citizens
of Wisconsin. According to this film,
it's perfectly natural for a Wisconsin
native to incredulously ask, when
Eddie lists the languages in which he
is fluent, "There's a country called
Phlegm?"
Obviously the writers of "The
Prince and Me" did not want to burden their footage of Denmark's royal
finery with a plot, as Eddie and Paige
glide through the last 45 minutes
nearly obstacle-free. (That's unless
you count Eddie's younger sister's
constantly saying to Paige, "Isn't this
grand? We're going to be sisters!" as
a problem. I know I did.) But the singular fairytale-esque aspect of "The
Prince and Me" does not bring this
flat film to life. "The Prince and Me"
may be trying to put on screen a
young girl's greatest fantasy, but in
doing so, it creates a new one that
involves not a prince but a movie

everything

there's a tradeoff:

JIDEKA AKUNYILI 'O4 KICKS OFF THIS YEAR'S SENIOR

Series in the List Gallery. Akunyili is a painter
of light, form and, increasingly, bold color. Her
charcoals and oils in the List this week document
her remarkable journey toward firmer shapes,
thicker paints, bolder strokes and richer colors. The

work in the exhibition focuses around her portraits

and also includes figures and still lifes.
Akunyili has grown radically as a painter during
her career at Swarthmore. A still life from her earlier days of typical Tarble fare (an apple, Dannon
yogurt and a Nature Valley granola bar) illustrates
Akunyili's older work. The paint is thin and the colors flat. Her brushstroke is shy and blurry. But the
still life already betrays her interest in shadows,
shapes and sparkling colors.
Her recent work has become more bold, buttery
and vibrant. The full-figure self-portrait glories in
confident brushstrokes, simple shapes and rich gem-

tones. Akunyili told me how hard this portrait was to
paint. She arranged herself in a chair before a mirror,
then jumped up to paint a few strokes on the canvas
before the composition slipped her mind. One can feel
the energetic activity in the strength of her brushstrokes and the straightforwardness of her shapes.
Akunyili singles out a tiny red-and-yellow still life
to represent a turning point in her painting. Since she
had begun painting, teachers and professors had been
saying her paint was too thin. She never really
understood what they meant. One day, her professor
gave her five minutes to paint a small still life. The
time limit forced her to work quickly and decisively.
Her paint went on thick and creamy, and her brushstrokes were firm and palpable. Since then, Akunyili
has let go of obsessively reworking her paintings in
favor of a more active, spontaneous aesthetic.
The dramatic lighting Akunyili loves to draw and
paint reveals why she prefers to work at night. It is
then that artificial lighting can leave the deepest
shadows and create the brightest contrasts. Her noc-

AKUNYILI

IS AN HONORS ART MAJOR WITH A MINOR AND

course major in biology. When she came to
Swarthmore, she thought she would become a

biology major on the pre-med track and do art on the
side. But she just kept taking more and more art
classes.

Eventually, she realized that art, not medicine,
was her passion. Painting, she says, never feels like
work. For her, the best part of being an art major is
"getting credit for fun." She doesn't envy her col-

leagues shut in the labs in the least. She'd rather be
shut in Beardsley until the wee hours of the morning.
The senior art majors share a studio on the third
floor, where they have been working together all
year to prepare for their upcoming shows. Akunyili
says they've learned a lot from each other, and she
credited their professor, Randall Exon, with teaching her the most these past four years.
She confessed to being a little "freaked out" about
showing her work. Akunyili is exhibiting works in
progress and quick studies as well as completed
pieces.
Audience reception has

never been one of

Akunyili's big concerns, but she admitted, "I keep
wondering what people are going to say." This exhibition is a blossoming beginning to her artistic career.

turnal tendencies also partly explain why she paints
so many self-portraits. When she feels like painting
at two in the morning, there is no one else around to
sit for her.

Inside the applications, 18 pounds of paper
BY LILLIAN DUNN
ldunnl@swarthmore.edu

Maybe you remember the terrifying
statements in all those college admissions
guides. Sentences like collegeconfidential.corn's "With acceptance rates at alltime lows, setting yourself apart requires
more than just blockbuster SAT scores and
impeccable transcripts
it requires the
perfect application essay." Statistics with
teeny percentages showing just how hard it
is to get into a place like Swarthmore,
much less pay for it. All those online essay
editing services which offered to bring
your "personal statement" up to par for the
small fee of $149.99. In the frenzied atmosphere surrounding college admissions, it's
no wonder that some applicants to
Swarthmore go to extremes to catch the

attention of admissions officers.

In this year's "highly qualified" applicant pool, there were many students with
unusual backgrounds and application
strategies, according to JimBock '9O, director of admissions. One application however
had far more weight than the others literally.
"We had a record this year," Bock said.
"We had the heaviest application ever,
weighing in at 18 pounds."
When the application appeared at the
admissions office, "it took a minute to realize it was actually an application," Bock
said. "It was about a pound for every year
of the person's life. Maybe it was a little
overkill, I think."
"The file was just recommendations,

documentations of summer experiences,
and sample writings, poetry and prose. All
the good stuff." Amin Abdul-Malik, associate dean of admissions, said.
Bock said

other zealous applicants

sometimes send gifts, especially those
applicants trying to get off of the waiting
list. This year the office hasn't received
any interesting gifts, Bock said, but in a
recent admission's season it was sent a
crate of pineapples.
Some in this year's application pool were
even more unique than their applications.
According to Bock, one admitted student
rebuilt a plane, one is an organic herbalist
who was raised in a one-room schoolhouse,
and one is an orchid cultivator who cares
for 30 different species of the flower. One

has an asteroid named after her, and one
has a patent pending on computer-gaming
security software that is being used around
the world. And one student, who is "very
Swattie," said Bock, "yells cheers in Latin at
sporting events."
Bock said he can't give away everything
about the admitted students because he
plans to include much of the information in
his speech to students at Ride the Tide, the
admitted students weekend scheduled for
April 23-26. The event is going to have several interesting features this year, Bock
said, including faculty lectures specifically
for prospective students and a tour of

Philadelphia. Both innovations are in their
second year.
"We introduced special faculty lectures
for the students last year, and all 14 were
oversubscribed. Let's say you're in a phi-

losophy discussion, and 20 prospective students come in. We encourage students to sit
in, but the separate lectures are better,"

Bock said. "Also last year, there were trolleys into Philadelphia, after people told us
that we talked about the proximity to
Philadelphia but nobody ever saw it. We
will continue with the trolleys, which offer
a driving tour and then drop the students
off on South Street for a while."

The purpose of Ride the Tide is to woo
prospective students, and in Bock's perfect
world, he said, every student would choose
Swarthmore as their

destination.

"I really enjoyed the April Fools' Daily
Gazette article, about all 900 of the admitdeciding

Swarthmore," Bock said. "It might be Myrt
[Westphalj's nightmare, but it would be my

dream."

It's not always easy to become a brother
Fraternities. Those dark, mysterious houses on the edge of
Swarthmore college life, those
clandestine organizations home
to all sorts of arcane ritual, those
hubs of esoteric custom, bathed in

Finally, I was in.
It was a dark and stormy night
when I arrived at DU. Ciar him-

self was waiting to escort me to a
lonely upstairs room. There I
waited in isolation, listening to
the raucous laughter of the DU
brothers echo up the stairs.

Chris "Ciar" Ciarleglio 'O4, asking
if I could "hang" with his "boys."
His response was typical. "Sorry,"
he explained, "we're reaUy busy

non-imported beer. A fancy podium, an antique grandfather clock,
a dirty mattress, walls with paint
chipping off, and a commandeered sign with the words
"Friends Meeting" on it. I didn't
know what to make of it all. I
would have explored further but
for the loud stampede now rumbling up toward the room. The DU
brothers were arriving. I quickly

retook my seat. The meeting was
about to begin.
In truth, no account of this

meeting could possibly do it jus-

tice. How could one put into
words the pure aural sensation of
the entire DU brotherhood belting
out their anthem in soul-wrenching unison? How could one
describe the zealotry and passion

"Flip"
that brother Mike
DeFillipo 'O4 brought to his
inspired sermon on Ezekiel 25:17?

How could one capture the drama
surrounding Flip's recap of the
latest episode of the OC?
Even business matters were
frought with emotion. The question of who would live in DU's private room in 2004-05 was one of
paramount concern. Elder brothers loudly proclaimed the superiority of the arrangement: "I
wouldn't trade [the experience of
living in DU] for anything in the
world." They offered advice: "It's
only loud Friday and Saturday
nights. And if you need to sleep,
you can drink a few beers and pass
out." They downplayed its flaws:
"You don't have to clean your own
bathroom. Get some pledge to do it
for you." Remarkably, even
despite such praise, no one volunteered for the room. Meanwhile, I
listened attentively, mostly unrecognized in the commotion. The
few overtures that were made to
me were friendly ones. I've been
visiting campus groups for three
months now, and no one before DU
was kind enough to offer me a beer
or an autographed CD of Swat foot-

ball highlights. Moreover, I experienced no exclusion or rude initiation. As Ciar explained to me later,
Delta Upsilon was founded on the
principles of openness. DU keeps
no secrets, performs no hidden

ceremonies and holds no closed
meetings. Its members work hand-

with

Swarthmore's

SBC,
SC and SAC
rather than deviously subverting them. In many

ways, DU is the polar opposite of
the ultra-secretive fraternities I'd

previously imagined.
Unfortunately, as open as DU
is in all those regards, it still is

exclusive when it comes to
pledges. Perhaps the brotherhood
of DU is for me; perhaps it isn't.

Alas, that isn't my choice. Until a

pledge ticket arrives in the mail,
I'm no better than a frat boy

Pain and pleasure Cause 'célèbre'
Why is pain pleasurable? Obviously there are
situations in which pain is inappropriate and just,
well, painful. But inflicting and receiving pain provides an opportunity for pleasure that makes it
well worth experimenting. Now, we're not talking

ous sensation of hurt and arousal. Try it.
However, if your partner has never been bitten
before during sex, introduce the teeth slowly yet
assertively, enough so that it isn't mistaken for an
accident.

that clear-cut.
The bottom line is that pain is pleasurable
because of its intensity. The feeling of being totally
out of control is similar to being turned on or even
to the powerlessness you feel during an orgasm.
Painful sensations can overlap with pleasurable

ones.
Another benefit

and drawback
of playing
with pain is that it often lasts longer than the sexual encounter itself. Whether it is the rhythmic
throbbing of a bruise, the itch of a wound just scabbing over or the ache where you resisted the
restraints, pain keeps
you thinking about

Scratching
Very much like the mouth, the fingers have the
dual quality of being soft at the fingertips and hard
at the nails. A scratch can vary from the sensual
dragging of fingernails in an almost tickling manner, to the near-penetration of the skin, forcing the
blood to the surface. Need we say more?

Spanking
Whereas the dual quality of biting and scratching can conceivably characterize them as lovemaking practices, spanking is definitely situated
in the realm of fucking. Spanking is a testament to
the abrasiveness, crudeness and aggressiveness of
sex, an acknowledgement of the sheer physicality
of the act. It is from this realm that biting and
scratching borrow. But by spanking, we don't necessarily mean the reprimanding hit on the butt
though this does have its place in some role-plays.
We're talking about spanking for the sake of touching, its abruptness and aggressive stimulation.
Imagine that, in the throes of an energetic episode,
one partner is bent over and the other's open hand
is swiftly brought down upon the poised ass of the
first, squeezing before raising the hand again. Let
us be clear that this is not lovemaking. This is
fucking, the mainstream freakiness associated

with sex.

needs to dance all day in an uncollared
shirt. You may want to play the more
extreme games when seeing only one person. After all, baring those marks for a
partner who didn't inflict them is less
than classy. Now to the logistics.

Biting
Those of you who have read any oi
"The Vampire Chronicles" by Anne Rice,
or have partaken of said activity, are
aware of the tantalizing combination of
sensuality and aggressiveness that comes
from teeth on skin. The juxtaposition of
lips and tongue, and teeth shows just how
subtle the line between pleasure and pain
can be. Biting suggests a desire to consume your partner. It adds a level of
urgency or force that the tongue and lips

simply cannot address.
Imagine the periodic dragging
one's teeth across an erogenous zone,
like the neck for example, or even a
direct bite, creating the complexly ambigu-

reality is that they require a lot of

trust. In fact, the level of trust
implied by agreeing to play with any
degree of pain is remarkable and says
something about a relationship. For
many, simply knowing what that trust
means in the context of the relationship
is enough to be a real turn-on.
While we always assume that you
practice our sex tips safely, it is especially important that you recognize that any
play that breaks skin or

Celebrities are

notorious for

sickeningly

rich

and

famous lives. But many celebs are
stepping out on issues that need to
be heard, and they hope the public
is listening. Others are being celebrated posthumously for the positive influence they exuded while

alive. Here I've provided a look at
some stars that have lit up the
scene in a good way during the last
couple of weeks, either by creating
social awareness or by carrying on
a legacy.
The Hip-Hop Summit Action
Network made its way to Chicago
March 27 to encourage young peopie to vote. The 19th summit fea-

BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
Pop Life

tured a panel discussion with
musical guests Ludacris, Kanye West, Common and Twista. It cen
tered on topics like voting and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Surrounded
by a powerhouse of board members, including chairman Russell
Simmons and members Jay-Z, Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and the Rev
Al Sharpton, HSAN promotes social and political change to fight the
war on poverty and injustice. Ventures the group has taken up in
the past include organizing grass roots youth councils to engage in
local leadership development activities. The organization has regis
tered more than 500,000 new voters at various city summits since its
start in 2001, and even more have signed up on its Web site.
Gary Sinise ("Apollo 13," "Forrest Gump") is no stranger to
activism, either. The actor recently began a school supply drive for
Iraqi kids after he visited U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf. The trip
showed him that the conditions in Iraq for education were dismal
The cause, titled Operation Iraqi Children, is a "nonpartisan, nonpo
litical issue," Sinise said at an April 1 news conference in Kansas

City, Mo.
The drive is geared toward building relationships and comforting
children who are in desperate need. Kasie Groom 'O7 weighed in on
Sinise's efforts. "Whether you're for the war or against it, that is not
the issue," she said. "The issue is that we're there now, and so are
these children, hungry for an education. This is where Operation Iraqi
Children will have such an impact." Sinise started the drive at his own
children's California school, and it now includes several non-profit
organizations and FedEx Corporations. Groom is starting a drive for
the charity here at Swarthmore.
Remembering past greats continued April 5 with the 10th anniver
sary of Kurt Cobain's untimely death. The lead singer of the grunge
band Nirvana shot and killed himself in 1994. Memorial events were
organized to celebrate his life and music, including a special service
in Seattle's Viretta Park, where many participated in a vigil and left
flowers and messages near his home. While fans gathered in places the
star had visited or lived, some rock radio stations devoted Monday to
Nirvana's music.
The Aberdeen Museum of History in Washington State displayed
an exhibit of Cobain's personal artwork contributed by his grandfa
ther. The exhibit included everything from happy childhood images to
the dark and sometimes disturbing self-portraits and paintings o:
Cobain's later years. All of this took place in the hopes that his short
success would carry on in his legacy and the hearts of those he
touched.

Britney show comes to Philly
Britney Spears did it again, bringing her Onyx Hotel Tour to
Wachovia Center in Philly last week. No one could deny the energy
emanating from the arena as the pop vixen took the stage.
"It was really fun to be in this loud space," Allen Frost 'O4 said after
seeing the concert. Frost was "overwhelmed by the spectacle" anc
equated the show to an elaborate circus.
Spears was in perfect form as she danced, writhed and actually
sang (yes, for two whole songs!) to thousands of hyper fans of all ages
genders and sexualities. The concert also utilized the tour's "hotel'
theme, with numbers including suitcases, bellhops and a lounge
jazz/cabaret remix of her first two huge hits, "Oops
I Did it Again'
and "Baby One More Time."
The performance consisted mostly of tracks from her new album
"In The Zone," including the racy "Touch of My Hand" (you can figure it out), in which Spears, clad in a nude sparkly suit, squirmed
around in a see-through tub. Minutes later, she engaged in a fairly
lengthy bedroom dance and kiss with a dancer for the song "Breathe
...

On Me."
While the show lacked true moments of spontaneity, it made up for
it through the theatricality and choreography that were on point
throughout the concert. "We were just amazed at her athleticism,"
Frost said. After the grand finale, complete with confetti, scores of
fans outside yelled, "I love you, Britney!"

The balancing act
Sometimes we can learn as much from the stories we
don't find as from the stories we do. The controversies
that aren't there may reveal more about the complexity
of our community than the exciting, titillating feuds

that make for interesting reading.
For example, we were interested in the Mullan Tennis
Center's tradition of closing on Easter Sunday. It seemed
like a glaring exception to the college's general policy of
remaining secular and not closing campus services during the semester for religious holidays. We wanted to
know how the Mullan staff justified this practice,
whether there was an ongoing fight between secularists
and traditionalists over the policy, maybe even see if students would begin protesting the policy (and if others
would begin defending it) as a result of our coverage.
We ended up feeling a bit like the Animal Rights
Coalition did when they called Sharpies about their
planned veal protest. Michael Mullan first called us saying that the Mullan staff had simply never considered
there might be opposition to their closing on Easter. Then
he called again to say that, upon reflection, they decided
closing on Easter was a bad decision and that, from this
point forward, Mullan would be open on Easter.
Our feelings were ambivalent; our intention, after all,
was to report on policy, not change it. Then again, this
was a policy that apparently survived because no one
had ever opened up a discussion about its ramifications.
There is, after all, an obvious fairness issue involved
in closing for any religious holiday, especially when an
institution only closes for one holiday throughout the
year. People for whom April 11 is only another Sunday
would be unfairly inconvenienced if they wanted to work
out. There is also legitimate concern over the message the
college, a secular institution, sends whenever it appears
to privilege one religion's observances over others'.
On the other hand, the Mullan Center, after all, is not
required to conform to the college's own business schedule. It's considered a separate institution under the wing
of the athletics department with the power to set its own
hours. And the hours weren't set as part of an abstract
set of principles based on a philosophical definition of

fairness, the sort of reasoning that makes it into printed
policies published by the dean's office, the kind it would
be easy for us to debate in the pages of a newspaper.
Instead, Michael Mullan told us it was a personal
decision based on the fact that a large percentage of
Mullan's limited set of full-time workers wanted to take
the day off to celebrate Easter. Rather than an institutionally defined day off like Thanksgiving or Christmas,

it was a day off tailored to the needs of the individual

staff members at Mullan.
That's a much more difficult situation to address,
and official Swarthmore policy doesn't provide unambiguous guidance for what the center ought to have
done. Swarthmore's human resources handbook blandly says that "while operating needs of departments must
be met, supervisors should make reasonable accommodations" for religious observances.
Suddenly we face the familiar balancing act again.
Rather than a simple question of having Swarthmore as a
secular institution or a religious one, we face the question
ofhow a secular institution must balance the needs of one
religious practice against another. Is it really fair to ask
staff members to always bow to the needs of students in
these matters? Would it be fair to ask the reverse?
Perhaps the best way to deal with this is to do what
the administration has done and trust institutions within the Swarthmore community to share our values and
make their own decisions on how to balance differing
needs. It's these personal, low-level decisions that are
most likely to meet people's diverse, changing needs.
The punch line of this story, after all, was that the
Mullan Center, when confronted with a potential conflict of interest they hadn't considered, decided com-

pletely independently to take the same course of action
we ultimately would have. Though our community may

be divided by religious and cultural differences, the

heartening thing to remember is that most of the people
in charge are alike in their commitment to balancing

these differences tolerantly and

Earthlust fights for clean energy
Dear Editor:
On April 1,

Swarthmore students
passed out windmills to promote a new
clean energy future for the school. The
action was one of more than a hundred
taking place at schools across the
country as part of a National Day of
Action and comes as the U.S. Congress
is preparing to take up an energy bill
widely viewed as continuing a policy
of dependence on fossil fuels.
Earthlust has been campaigning to
promote clean energy at Swarthmore,
particularly wind power, since 200 L
We applaud the college for the steps it
has already taken to support windgenerated electricity. We feel that this
commitment to wind power demonstrates such moral leadership and

educational responsibility as is consistent with the mission of the college,
and we hope Swarthmore will soon
increase the amount of clean, wind-

generated electricity in its budget.
There is a new generation of student activism sweeping the nation
today, and a key part is a responsible
energy future that turns against the
fossil fuel policies of the past. We are
sending a strong message that young
people in this nation have the power
to make change. Both the school

administration and the federal government should listen.
Following student-led initiatives,
Cornell, Lewis and Clark, and the
entire University of California sys-

tem have each recently pledged to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions to
meet or exceed the requirements of

the Kyoto Protocol.
The UC system passed a groundbreaking policy that mandates a 10megawatt installment of renewable
energy. Nationwide, more than 40
higher education institutions are pur-

chasing over 107,809 megawatt-hours
of wind energy.
The Climate Campaign, Student

Environmental

Action

Coalition,

Greenpeace, Southern Alliance for
Clean Energy, Utah Clean Energy

Alliance, National Wildlife Federation
and EnviroCitizen, as well as other
local and national groups, joined
Swarthmore in the National Day of

Action.
Clean energy has become a very
hot issue on college campuses. As we
join other campuses and coordinate
activities, this movement will be able
to affect serious change not only within but also beyond college campuses.
This is just the beginning.

gets sore.) The fact remains that the 12-gun-purchase-a-year folks will still have free rein with their toys. After
all, one measly gun is enough to kill a person
or lots

of people.

Here in Pennsylvania, we have nothing against laws
in general. There's no shortage of state legislation
regarding important issues besides guns. For example,
Pennsylvania has laws against sleeping on a refrigerator out of doors, singing in the bathtub, getting married
while you're drunk and hiding dirt under a rug in a
dwelling.

Yet no license or permit is required to buy handguns
in Philadelphia. There is no waiting period for gun
sales, so any angry trigger-puller can pick one up the
second she decides she needs one. Plus, no safety training is required for handgun owners, and even the guns
themselves don't have to pass a safety test before
they're sold.
Clearly, Philly needs to do more than simply triggerproof its schoolyards. 2,191 casualties per year seems
like a good enough reason
to ban handguns altogether
or at least crack down on
who is using them and
when.
It will be an uphill battle, if not a vertical one.

legal hurdles abound
for gun control reform. Pennsylvania does not allow
cities to enact gun laws stronger than the state's, so
even Johnson's wimpy proposals would have to get
through the state legislature before they could take
effect.
Could it really be that the majority of people in
Pennsylvania like guns better than, well, people (or, at
least, live ones)? Maybe
or maybe this is a case of outdated laws. Most of us agree by now that the Second
Amendment, which grants us the right to arm ourselves
as part of a "well-regulated militia," does not apply to
every random guy who decides a handgun would look
great with his cowboy boots
or, for that matter, every
7-year-old who tries on the cowboy boots and goes looking around for the gun.
Clearly, it's timefor Pennsylvania to get moving and
start pushing for stronger handgun legislation. Then
maybe we could become number two in the nation for
something else. Like best hair. Or cleanest rugs.

Every few weeks another shocking

gun death hits the news. Ten-year-old Faheem
Thomas-Childs was shot to death during a gang
shootout in North Philly while walking to school last
month. Earlier in the year, a southwest Pennsylvania
teenager killed both his principal and himself with a
gun he swiped from his stepfather. Twenty-two accidental gun deaths occurred in Pennsylvania last year,
according to the Alliance for Justice.
So, kudos to Johnson for finally broaching the gun
matter. It's gratifying to know that a law-enforcement
official is picking up on the fact that people are dying
and wants to actually do something about it. Yet

Johnson's gun control bills stop way short of where

they should.

His most radical proposal is a policy that would create "gun-free zones" around schools. Does anyone have
an open pass to tote firearms around campus now?

Think Columbine. Shouldn't this type of thing have
been whipped into place seven years ago?

Obesity not just an image issue
Dear Editor:
We would like to respond

to

Elinore Kaufman's attack on Worth
Health Center's advertisement of
the new Weight Watchers program
on campus ("Thanks,

Worth, for
added insecurity," March 25, pg. 14).
We agree with her position that selfimage should not revolve around
weight, but her letter made no reference to the obesity epidemic outside of the Swarthmore bubble.
Obesity will soon overtake heart
disease as the greatest health threat
in America. If one suffers from obesity, weight loss may save one's life,
not just one's self-image. There are
many Americans who are becoming
obese from a lack of education about
healthy lifestyle choices. Moreover,
these lifestyle choices, including
one's diet, are often greatly influenced by socioeconomic factors.
Many families with small budgets are forced to favor quantity over
quality when it comes to groceries.

mines the future of music
itself, not to mention threatening the jobs of tens of thousands," they say, and lots of
surveys exist to back them up.
However, dissatisfied by
the fallibility of surveys based

on asking people whether or

EVAN HENSLEIGH

Technological Misfit

not they were breaking the
law, two professors, Felix
Oberholzer-Gee (Harvard Business School) and Koleman
Strumpf (UNC Chapel Hill) decided to take a different
approach. They tapped into the remnants of Napster in 2002,
collected data on what songs were being traded over the
course of some 17 weeks, and matched that to the concurrent
sales of the albums being traded online.
Their result? "Downloads have an effect on sales which is
statistically indistinguishable from zero, despite rather precise estimates."
Yes, that's right. "Statistically indistinguishable from zero."
In case that didn't spell it out clearly enough, they also note,
"These estimates are inconsistent with claims that file sharing
is the primary reason for the recent decline in music sales."
The explanation that Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf give is
simple: getting the music free doesn't actually affect whether
people buy albums. People who were likely to buy albums
anyway still by and large do so. People who were unlikely to
buy music won't, although they may download it. To use their
analogy, if someone offers you a free trip to Florida, you'll
probably take it, but that doesn't mean that you'd have gone
to Florida (or even been likely to go) without the free ticket.
Now, we've known for a while that file sharing doesn't
hurt artists. Many of them support it because it spreads their
music. Moreover, most artists see so little of the money from
their album royalties when all is said and done that any drop
in sales would barely touch them. Their primary income is
almost always from tours, not albums. But this suggests that
the recording industry isn't being hurt by file sharing, either.
Digital rights activists have been suggesting this for years,
but now there's some evidential weight behind it.
The RIAA was quick to denounce the study, saying that
it runs counter to "all the other studies" on the subject
that is, survey evidence. I'm tempted, however, to agree
with Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf that there may be reason
to suspect surveys based on querying people about illegal
activity.
This does, however, underscore the crucial flaw in the
RIAA's crusade against music downloaders: Ultimately, it's a
bad idea to sue your customers. By attacking people who are
the RIAA
downloading music
ordinary folks, mostly
makes itself look bad and further alienates an already polarized consumer base. The major networks, by and large,
remain vital and full ofmusic (and the study done at Harvard
showed that, in 2002, more than half the files Americans
downloaded were served from outside the United States,

where the RIAA cannot reach). The legal campaign has largely failed in its main objective: to scare people en masse into
leaving the networks.

The RIAA has taken the wrong tack; it should turn about
and do something different now. The industry missed a golden opportunity to turn Napster into a subscription-based
service, and such an idea would never succeed now. But
there are still feasible options. Want to generate buzz about
a new album? Why not "leak" a track or two onto filesharing networks? This is what happened with Wilco's
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" back in 2001-02. The album was
delayed almost two years due to problems with Warner, the
band's label, but, in the meantime, the entire album was
leaked onto KaZaA. When it finally hit the shelves in 2002 on
a minor side label, it debuted at number 13 on the Billboard
charts, 50 spots higher than any of their previous albums,
selling 55,000 copies in the first week and 340,000 total.
Why isn't the industry turning to file sharing as a marketing tool? I don't know. But the assertion that "file sharing
hurts musicians" is ridiculous. The RIAA's self-destructive
actions are merely hurting their own industry. It's time they
tried a different tack.

What is also common among

wealthy by working in what
might broadly be defined as
"business." By exploiting free
market opportunities, they accumulated the wealth that we enjoy
today in our dormitories, concert

halls and libraries.
These men did not become wealthy by going into academia.
They did not become wealthy by joining the Peace Corps, and
they certainly did not become wealthy by working for NGOs in
third world countries. They became wealthy by taking advantage of capitalism.
Given that Swarthmore enjoys its elite status as a result of
that capitalism, it seems natural that we should not discourage
current Swatties from pursuing similar paths.
Yet among the student body, and in certain classrooms, business careers are stigmatized. They are looked down upon as
anti-intellectual and contrary to Swarthmore values. Indeed,
most Swatties have sat through classmates' rants (or made their
own) about the evils of "big business" and the moral corruption

of those associated with it.

It is not my intention to refute such claims. Rather, I cite
them out of a concern that such attitudes have resulted in, or at
least encouraged, an atmosphere in which corporate-minded
students are at a disadvantage in terms of career opportunities.
If for no other reason than the need to produce future college
philanthropists, the existence of such an atmosphere is not

acceptable.

The liberal arts education is an excellent preparation for a
business career. The ability to deconstruct problems and articulate effective solutions translates well in the boardroom. The
Lax Conference, while only an annual event, demonstrates at
least some recognition of Swarthmore alumni who have con-

tributed to the business world. Career Services does an excellent
job of connecting students with alumni in a variety of fields and
providing a number of relevant texts in its library. The recent
creation of the Swarthmore Business Association demonstrates
the existence of students for whom such resources are indeed

valuable.
Still, the corporate world is a competitive one. Swatties who
plan on becoming doctors and lawyers have a specific adviser
devoted to steering them toward relevant courses and helping
them apply to medical and law schools. Yet students who plan to
go into business have no one dedicated to them. While the
resources discussed above are helpful, they are not enough in
light of the fact that students at other schools come from entire
departments devoted to business studies, with professors who
can serve in the de facto role of advisers.
True, most business-minded students do not go straight to
graduate school from Swarthmore. Yet applying for corporate
positions requires as much preparation and foresight as applying to graduate school. The top investment banking and consulting firms look for specific applicant characteristics and
experiences in making their hiring decisions. Surely Swatties
deserve every advantage possible in this process. This holds
especially true because, while the top graduate schools are
aware of Swarthmore's reputation, human resources personnel
at larger corporations are often not. Rather, they focus on a few
top schools, leaving the task of attaining coveted positions even
more difficult for students from the relatively unknown
Swarthmore. The greater the number of resources available for
Swatties intent on business, the more accessible corporate
opportunities will become. While enjoying an endowment of
more than a billion dollars, we must recognize the primary
source of that endowment and be practical about its future. By
matriculating at Swarthmore, we make an implicit acknowledgement that there is no shame in enjoying the fruits of capitalism. To outwardly shun the corporate world, in light of this
reality, would be simply hypocritical.

Critics' disrespect inexcusable
Dear Editor:
We feel it necessary to respond to the extremely
abbreviated summary of the living wage collection
("Living wage collection incites controversy," March

25, pg. 6). The vehemence with which Director of
Dining Services Linda McDougall was attacked is
appalling and unjustified. The fact that anyone would
show support for that display alone should be enough
to call their concern into question. It is unfortunate
that McDougall's arguments, based on 14 years of
experience with Swarthmore's Dining Services, have
been overshadowed by the vicious attempts of some
(with no firsthand knowledge of her position) to discredit her over a single comment taken out of context.
Since the collection, McDougall has received
dozens of phone calls, e-mails and cards as well as
verbal gestures of support from staff at all levels and
in many departments for her bravery in facing honestly and openly what turned out to be a tremendous-

ly hostile audience. McDougall's respect for the staff

of Swarthmore is obvious in their returned respect
for her. It is not staff members who see fit to attack
McDougall, but rather it is those who claim "democ-

racy" as an ideal in a quest to "help" those same staff
members. How can silencing a wise and experienced
voice such as McDougall's be a positive contribution
to anyone's understanding all aspects of this issue?
Those truly interested in a "democratic" approach
to the living wage should be sure to take another look
at McDougall's position and seek to understand it.
There are sound reasons behind her having taken the
risk to share her opinion at the collection, which any-

one concerned with the welfare of all members of the
Swarthmore community should take to heart.
Thank you, Linda, for your bravery and honesty
in truly standing up for the future of the entire
Swarthmore community.

wage issues" and "Ad hominem

wrote about your coverage of the
town meeting on the living wage of
last March 19 ("Living wage collection incites controversy," March 25,
pg. 6). Because of my previous work
with the ad hoc committee, I had
been invited as a panelist, but I

unfortunately had to be out of town
that day.
The statement atributed to
Director Linda McDougall was put
forth in a public setting. Unless the

statement contained in the article
in quotation marks is falsely attributed, I do not see a reason not to
report it. I regret the pain that the
report
and the ensuing polemic
may have caused McDougall, as I
regret the pain her comment
caused some of her listeners. But I
could not agree with an effort to
disregard a fact of speech that
touches on a key question of the living wage proposals: how we see the
people who make the lowest wages
at Swarthmore College. The ad hoc
committee has assumed, as an
implicit point of departure, that
low wage earners are able to make
decisions on how to spend their
money.
Years ago, when the faculty con-

sidered regulations against offen-

sive speech among students, it

came to the realization that it
would be counterproductive to
inhibit it through prohibitive

measures. Instead, we thought we
needed to be able to hear it and
react as a community the only way

by talking about it and
unmasking its falsehood. This incident is clearly not in the same category, but it has the potential to
diminish some people in the eyes of
others. For these reasons, I am glad

students Harris Kornstein 'O6 and

Those idiot talkers Softball swept
People should know when to shut up. We here at 90% Half

This starts in the everyday world and extends into the sports
world. People who chat incessantly on cell phones? Can't stand

silences with anecdotal testimonials about the virtues of veganism? Or how about those other
Swatties who miserably bemoan
the suffocating blanket of so-called
liberal bias? All idiot talkers, if you
ask us.
The sports galaxy is similarly
infused with idiot talkers at aU levels. As we write this, we're being
subjected to the painful idiot talk
of CBS college basketball commentator Billy Packer. The last few
months in general were full of idiot

talk. Philadelphia Eagles

himself to Rosa Parks? Idiot talk.

BEN WHARTON

Major League Baseball Players'

Union head Donald Fehr comparing steroids to cigarettes? Yep,
more idiot talk. University of
t^m^^^^m^^^^^^^^m
Colorado football coach Gary
Barnett insinuating that former
kicker Katie Hnida somehow opened herself up to sexual harassment and possible rape because she was "terrible" and "a girl"?
Almost unfathomable idiot talk. Some other noteworthy idiot talkers include former pitcher John Rocker, golfer Vijay Singh, Red
Sox owner John Henry, big fat junkie Rush Limbaugh, and my
favorite punching bag, Pete Rose.
But we're going to leave these heavy hitters behind for now in
order to focus on a new type of idiot talker that is pissing the hell
out of us. This new breed of idiot talker is the former star pitcher
who sees fit to allege steroid use in a more recent or current star.
The prototype is Mr. Jockey Undies himself, Jim "Cakes" Palmer
Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame pitcher, who recently made vague
yet not-so-vague allegations that former Orioles outfielder Brady
Anderson was on steroids when he hit 50 home runs in 1996. These
allegations are idiot talk to a high degree. Palmer retired in 1984.
He is essentially in no better position to know about Anderson
using steroids than you or I. But don't take our word for it. Take
Palmer's. The day after his idiot talk, Palmer told The Baltimore
Sun, "I don't know if Brady took steroids. How would I know?" OK,
Jim, if you don't know, why are you going around talking idiot

90% Half Mental

talk?
And therein lies the rub. It's one thing for you or us or Carlton
to make allegations of steroid use about whatever meathead is
playing first base for the Yankees. Everyone knows we would be
talking out of our asses if we made allegations like that. But when
a Hall of Fame pitcher from within the organization in question
makes allegations, people are gonna think he knows something,
and they're gonna believe him. Which makes it all the more irresponsible when it turns out he's just talking out his Jockey-clad
ass. By the way, Palmer's also an Orioles broadcaster, which
makes him a journalist of sorts. This does not speak well of
Palmer's journalistic integrity. If we were an Oriole, we would
think twice about trusting him.
But Palmer just might luck out, as it seems this new breed of
idiot talker has already begun to procreate. Jack McDowell, longtime White Sox pitcher, has recently alleged steroid use by Cubs
ace Mark Prior, of all people, based on Prior's slow healing ankle
tendonitis. So now Black Jack McDowell, he of the Buffalo Bill
'stache, has one-upped Palmer by choosing to accuse a player openly, instead of vaguely, who happens to play for a cross town rival,
instead of for the same team, who is a skinny pitcher, instead of a
hitter who had a freakish power year. We don't really know what
more can be said about McDowell's comments.
But now it's time for the moralistic conclusion. Throwing
around allegations of steroid use when you are an idiot talker is
wrong. Kids, don't do it. But all of this steroid circus could have
been avoided if baseball had not essentially gone out of its way to
avoid penalizing its players for taking steroids so that they could
hit the home runs that the fans love so much. Baseball's steroid
policy is a joke, and all former steroid policies have been even
worse. If you ask us, baseball needs a policy similar to the NFL,
where a first-time positive via random testing results in a suspension lasting a quarter of a season. If the union complains, offer
this compromise: Accept this plan, and all existing records stand
as legitimate. No asterisks for future offenses. Baseball can save
itself from a world of suspicion and cynicism, not to mention
steroid-related idiot talk, if it would just adopt these tougher

guidelines.

Swarthmore softball finished off
a rough week, losing 0-8 and 0-3 in a

doubleheader
at Muhlenberg.
Emily Remus 'O6 and Marianne
Klingaman 'O7 both had solid performances on the mound, but they
were outmatched by the opposing
pitching staff, which allowed a

games. The Garnet are now 5-12-1

Conference.

"There is a lot to be said for both
of our pitchers today," Stephanie

the hits that got through were hits

They took to the diamond trying to

2-2. The game was then called due
to darkness. Pitcher Marianne
Klingaman 'O7 went the whole way
for the Garnet, giving up five hits
and allowing zero earned runs in

her outing. "We have a bunch of
people playing really well," coach
Renee Clarke said.
Standouts include Samantha
Brody 'O5, Danielle Miller 'O6 and
Christina Procacci 'O6. The firstyear class has provided strong contributions as well, with Ashley
Brandt 'O7, Kelly Siano 'O7 and
Klingaman all giving impressive
performances. Clarke was pleased
with the steps the Garnet had taken
as a team.

"We have made improvements

on offense, on defense and on the
mound," Clarke said. "Our average
has gone up, we've played good
defense at times, and our E.R.A.
has gone down."
The team's doubleheader April
1 against Wilmington was rained

out, but the Garnet were back on
the diamond Saturday against

conference foe Dickinson. They
dropped the first game 0-9 but
responded with a 7-1 in the second
game. In the first game, the

Garnet batters succumbed to the

pitcher

Devil's

Christine

Czarnecki, who pitched a no-hitter
and had a perfect game until

Procacci

walked

in the final

inning. Remus, back on the mound
for the Tide, was hit hard, giving
up 13 hits and nine runs. The
Garnet also struggled in the field,
committing five errors.
"Watching us in practice, we
look a lot better than I think we've
played against other conference
opponents," Procacci said. "I

think we're better than we've
shown."
Swarthmore was able to turn
things around in game two, with a
huge seven-run second inning to
break the game open. The Tide
started the inning with two singles, opening the flood gates. Siano
doubled into left center scoring
both runners. Two outs later
Rogan

doubled. A single and a

walk loaded the bases for Miller,
who promptly cleared them with a
double into left field. The final
Garnet run of the inning and the
game came on an error. Klingaman
had another strong outing, allow-

ing only one unearned run in
seven innings to pick up her third
win of the season.
The Garnet

bleheader tonight.
"If we keep our head in the

The women's tennis team knows success.
The squad has posted shutouts in three of its
four most recent matches, and the women
are 6-2, 2-1 in the conference.
Anjani Reddy 'O4 has been racking up
huge wins in both singles and doubles
matches, helping the team continue this
tradition of victory with a 40-game win

Sometimes we have bad days, but when
we're both on, we have a great time,"
Reynolds said.

of confidence in each other. We can look at
any situation and work with coach trying
different strategies out for different matches."
The two are ranked fourth in the Atlantic
South region for doubles teams. "It's really
nice, because we work well together.

streak.
The streak "is definitely a remarkable
achievement in many ways," coach Jeremy
Loomis said. "All of her wins were at the
number-one spot in singles, so she was
always going up against the best player from
each school we played. Also, in tennis, there
are many factors to contend with, like wind,
sun or unfamiliar courts, as well as the
heavy workload of Swarthmore, and Anjani
is pre-med."
Reddy is the only player in Centennial

Conference history to be named Player of
the Year three years in a row
and she still
has the 2004 season to look forward to.
Reddy has been an outstanding player for
the Garnet since she arrived in 2000 from
Singapore.

"She has always been able to pull something out. Anjani is definitely one of the
most mentally tough players. She is a pleasure to coach," Loomis said. She is the
fourth player in conference history to earn

first-team All-Centennial honors three
times.
While Reddy's individual achievements
have been exceptional, her focus is on the
squad. "I am having a great time out there,
just getting the best win possible for the
team. I just like being able to go out and
play," Reddy said. "Tennis has really
become a team thing for me. The change
from high school to college is huge, and I

love how we are able to come together and
work on goals as a team."
"This is probably my best year so far, in
the sense that I love my team, we have a
great time off and on the court, and we continue to build a great work ethic. There is
so much I have learned from everyone I've
been around," Reddy said.

Anjani Reddy practices her swing during practice on Monday afternoon.

Sonya Reynolds 'O7, Reddy's doubles
partner, credited Reddy's amiable nature.
"I love playing with Anj. She is so easy
to get along with," she said. "I think we are

"I am having a great time
out there, just getting the
best win possible for
the team."
Anjani Reddy 'O4
The team is ranked 16th in the nation

and was named conference champions in
2001 and 2003. Reddy is ranked seventh in
the Atlantic South region. Nonetheless, her
primary focus is not on numbers or titles.
"I think that competing is about how you
develop as a person more than about wins
and losses, records, or stats," Reddy said.
"This year, I am trying to close out the
season and have a great experience with it,
getting the most out of my time here,"
Reddy said. "We're still plugging through
our many matches we have left, since we're
only about halfway through the season."
As far as this season goes, Reddy and the
rest of the squad have their eyes on another
conference championship. "We really want
to win conferences. If Muhlenberg loses, we
will have a good chance. Our loss to them
was very close. It was at their home courts,
and we didn't have a full lineup, with so
many people sick with strep throat," Reddy
said. "I also think when you are the best
team in the conference, everyone is out to
get you."
The loss to Muhlenberg was "unexpected,
but we haven't let it demoralize us,"
Reynolds said.
Reddy hopes to continue her winnig
streak when the team faces the Blue Jays of
Johns Hopkins Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in
Maryland.

Jumpers, runners and throwers all strong at Muhlenberg
BY COLTON BANGS
cbangsl@swarthmore.edu
On a windy, cold and dreary day, Garnet
track had arguably its best performance all
year at the Muhlenberg Invitational.
"The weather was kind of a story in itself.
It was deteriorating before our eyes, so that
made it kind of difficult," coach Peter
Carroll said. Moreover, the team was without some of its top runners, who took the
shorter trip to compete against Division One
schools and Ivy Leaguers in the highly competitive Penn Invitational. The team also
missed its top overall sprinter, Tyler Lyson
'O6, whose injuries from a car accident last
Wednesday kept him from competition (see
story, pg. 3). Nevertheless, Swarthmore was
able to capture some high spots, and several
of the Tide bested their best.
Saturday was also a historic day for the
Garnet, as Jen Stevenson 'O6 put her name up
among past great Swarthmore long jumpers.
Stevenson launched herself over 5.00 meters
of runway and sand to move into seventh
place all-time in the Swarthmore record books
in only her second competition at the collegiate level. Her leap was good for fourth place
in the meet and put conference rivals from
Franklin and Marshall and Haverford to
shame.
"I feel pretty lucky. It took a lot of hard
work and practice. I think I will do even better after I get some more practices under my
belt," Stevenson said.
Samantha Graffeo 'O7 also etched her
name
into the record books. Unlike
Stevenson, though, Graffeo tossed her way
into history Saturday with a 10.15 meter
throw in the shot put. Out of 19 throwers, she
finished sixth in the invitational. Only in
her first year, this is Graffeo's second time
cracking the top 10 all-time throws for the
Garnet.

Matt Williams hands the baton off to Tyler Lyson in a relay run during practice.

Also on the women's side, Lauren Fety 'O6

finished strong in the 800-meter. She took
eighth place in a field of 40 with a time of
2:30.00.
The men were led by Matt Williams 'O4,
who has had a strong start this season.
Williams finished second in the 110-meter
hurdles with a time of 16.13 seconds, qualifying him for the ECAC Championships. In the
mile relay, Williams' split led the Tide. He
handed off to Dillon McGrew 'O7, who along
with Duncan Gromko 'O7 and Kier
Wachterhauser 'O4 finished the relay neckand-neck with the "A" Team from East
Stroudsburg. In the end, the relay took second, finishing just three-quarters of a second
behind East Stroudsburg.
"I am really happy with how the team ran
the 4x400. It was an exciting race all the way
down to the end. Matt Williams ran really
fast," Gromko said.
Gromko was also a strong finisher in the
800-meter, finishing in ninth place out of a
massive field of 47. The race was also the collegiate best for Duncan, as he finished with a
time of 2:01.70.
"I am happy with what I ran, considering
the conditions, but I think that if I keep working hard there is more room for improvement," Gromko said.
For many, the frigid weather coupled
with wind created obstacles. While under
armor can keep you warm in a race, it can
also be quite a hindrance, Stevenson
thought. The cold also brings strong considerations of injury potentials.
But for Jim Kreft 'O6, however, the cold
served as a perfect stage for him to take his
career to the next level. The sophomore captured fifth in the 5,000-meter run with a time
of 16:22.27, demolishing his previous personal best by around 20 seconds.
The team travels to Collegeville, Pa., for
the Ursinus Invitational April 10.

Women's rugby shuts out East Stroudsberg
BY EMILY CONLON

Still undefeated, the women's rugby
team overpowered East Stroudsburg
Saturday to capture its third win of the
season, 10-0.
Swarthmore had reason to be charged
for the game. Two years ago, the teams
competed in a match that resulted in pro-

resulting in penalties against Swat. In
addition, the muddy field conditions complicated simple catching and passing
plays.
"We weren't really setled down on
offense," Peters-Mason said. "We domi-

nated the first half and had several near
scores."

After the break, the team rallied
together. Elizabeth Buckner 'O6 put the
team on the board with the first try of the
day.
"Early on, the second half picked up
the ball on the penalty and ran it in on the
try," tri-captain Emily Rhoades 'O4 said.
"It was a super-smart play, and it got our

bation for East Stroudsburg by the
Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union. The
team was accused of making discriminatory and racist comments to Swarthmore
players during the A-side game. The Bside game, following the A-game, was
canceled halfway through due to unnecessary and dangerous play by both
teams. Both Swarthmore and East
Stroudsberg sustained injuries during
the contest.
"We had kind of vowed never to play
them again," tri-captain Aja PetersMason 'O4 said. "But their coach called
us, and he said they had a whole new,
rebuilt team. We thought it would be a
good idea to play."
Saturday's game remained scoreless
through the first half, with the Garnet in

control for most of the period. Playing
with a slightly altered back lineup, the
team committed a lot of pass forwards,

THE PHOENIX

heads back in the right place."
Teammate Lulu Miller 'O5 followed
with another try to seal the victory.
The women face off against Temple on
Saturday. Temple, which will compete in
the Division II playoffs this spring, is
reputed to have beaten William and
Mary 145-0 in a league game. With most
women's rugby games averaging scores
within the 20s, Swarthmore will have to
prepare for Temple's Goliath offensive
power.
"We've been practicing a lot of hitting," Rhoades said. "We're trying to getinto to rucks hard and fast and be right
on top of the ball."
"A score like that almost makes no
sense," Peters-Mason said. "I just told the
team to take care of themselves. It is
going to be a hard game, probably the
hardest game of the season. We just need
to try not to get flustered."

think we can do it."
"We're excited for conferences, and I think we can break
