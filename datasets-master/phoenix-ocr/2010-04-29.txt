George Lakey, a research associate at the Lang Center, and student Blaine O'Neill gather with others at a climate rally on Sunday.
BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu

Over 150,000 people gathered on the
National Mall in Washington D.C. this
Sunday to honor Earth Day 2010 and to sup-

port environmental movements at The
Climate Rally, an outdoor event comprised

of speeches, free live music and interactive
booths organized by Earth Day Network.
Among the attendees were several
Swarthmore students, all of whom are or
have been involved with Earthlust: Natali
Cortes 'l3, Sachie Hayakawa 'l3, Camille
Robertson 'l3, Erin Curtis 'l3, Ariel
Martino 'll and Kaz Uyehara 'lO.
"The sheer number of people that came
was impressive, even if they were there for
different reasons," Curtis said. "It's important to show the government that we have
that sort of impetus behind us."
The rally featured speeches by important figures in the environmental movement across all spheres, such as James
Hansen, world renowned NASA climatologist; Reverend Jesse Jackson; Robert
Kennedy, Jr.; and film director James
Cameron, as weU as prominent musical
acts such as John Legend, The Roots,
Sting, Passion Pit and Joss Stone, among
many others.
"The main goal of the Climate Rally was
to show that the community of environmentalists is galvanized, mobilized and
strong," said Nate Byer, Campaign director

ofEDN.

Taking advantage of the free student
bus to Washington D.C. provided by EDN,
the six students left campus early Sunday
morning and spent a whole day in
Washington D.C. enjoying the.free entertainment and nice weather at the biggest
climate rally ever to take place across the
globe.

said.

George Lakey, research associate at the
Lang Center, and seven additional students
stopped at the rally after spending the

weekend in West Virginia experiencing
both the social justice and environmental
issues of mountaintop removal.
At the rally, EDN also brought together
some of their partner environmental
organizations and green businesses.
Organizations had booths set up around
the Mall promoting their causes.
"They had a lot of booths and tents set
celebrating a lot
up with organizations
of accomplishments over the past decades,
trying to show what their organizations
are doing now," Cortes said. "I thought that
was a good entry point for some families
that maybe were walking around the Mall
and got kind of sucked in."
Some students found that the presence
of some of these booths took away from the
political depth of the rally and that there
was no sense of urgency.
"I felt it was kind of posed and almost
commercialized; there were a lot of booths
giving away free stuff— organizations like
the World Wildlife Fund, companies that
make reusable bags," Curtis said. "There
was a lot of emphasis on lifestyle choices
and I was a little disappointed that it wasn't more political."
Though Curtis said that the focus of The
Climate Rally for students was a bit
unclear, she also said that the rally did

the environmental movement for decades,

1970, EDN has created new organizations

Climate Rally did not aim to gather support for a particular legislation.
"This is not a time to show blind support for things we haven't seen; this is a
time to stand together and be loud and say,
'This is a nation we care about. We represent lots of communities with lots of
ideas,'" Byer said. "The last thing we're
going to do is drive support for a bill we
haven't even seen."
Partner organizations of EDN present
at the rally all utilized unique ways of
drawing in rally-goers to their booths,

Curtis said.

Representatives of BlueAvocado, an
advocacy group specializing in making
fashionable reusable bags, were handing
out their products for .free. They also had
on display a large mound of plastic bags
that they called "Schlumpy," symbolizing
the amount of plastic bags a family used in

a year, Cortes said.
There was also an "Avatar" booth
where representatives were handing out
free Sycamore tree seeds to promote their
Home Tree Initiative in which they plan to
plant one million trees in 15 countries
around the world between now and the end
of the year, Byer said.
"Avatar' is obviously about conservation, about respecting indigenous communities, about respecting the environment,"
said. "We are extremely fortunate to
be working with a movie that has such a
positive message."
According to Byer and Swann, the rally
was a success. If climate legislation is not
passed this year, they hope to hold another
rally on the National Mall next year.

STUCO HIGHLIGHTS

$90K in rollover funds to be spent
StuCo talked about how to use the
money left over from the Student
Activities Fund, which President
Rachel Bell 'lO said "will probably be
close to $90,000." In past years, this
money has gone into a capital replacement fund, which is used to repair and
replace expensive items of property.
Because of the economic crisis last
year, StuCo conducted a survey of the
student body, which indicated the
money should be put toward initiatives proposed by students. One of
these was the Renewing Fund for
Resource Conservation, which provides loans to environmentally-friendly initiatives, provided that they make
back enough money to replenish the

Coalition takes all but one spot in StuCo election

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Last
fall
members
of
the
Intercultural Center,
the Black
Cultural Center and some activist
groups formed a coalition to provide
support for specific candidates in the
Student Council elections in response
to a lack of competition and diversity.
Members of this coalition won all of the
races yesterday except for the presidential race.
During the last two elections, the
alternately referred to as a
coalition
campaign, a push and a movement by
its members
provided support for
candidates and asked community members to vote for specific candidates.
"Starting last [fall] term the IC/BCC
coalition has been doing a push for people to run for Student Council to make
sure that Student Council stays diverse
and has the interests of the whole campus in mind," campus life representative Watufani Poe 'l3 said. Though Poe
d referred to this coalition as the
"IC/BCC coalition," not everyone
involved was a member of either of
these groups.
An e-mail circulated earlier this
week encouraged recipients to tell
friends and like-minded people to vote
for the coalition's list of candidates.
"We have many candidates running

that share [a]
vision and want to continue this work.
We encourage you to vote for them,"
the e-mail said. Amelia Mitter-Burke
'l2 lost the presidential race to Simon
Zhu 'll with 220 votes to 205. Zhu said
in an interview before the election
ended that he was not aware of students running together as a group.
The e-mail also emphasized that
spreading the word about these candidates could be enough to win the election because of typically low voter
turnout.

According to professor of political
science Richard M. Valelly '75, who
studies and teaches course on voting
and political movements, this type of
campaign strategy is known as a slate.
"It's very standard in all kinds of elections," he said.
Ben Hattem 'l2, who was elected
financial policy representative, said
•that the coalition and their slate consisted of people who had similar ideas
about the role of StuCo.
"This whole IC/BCC thing is trying
to recognize that Student Council is the
right avenue to voice these concerns
about the ways that marginalized
groups are treated on campus," Hattem
said. He added that while the college
community often thinks of itself as a

"melting" pot, in reality not all groups
have an equal share of power.
The coalition campaigned in a similar manner this semester. According to
Hattem, all five of the candidates listed
Luis Penate
in the December e-mail
'l3, s student events advisor; Deivid
Rojas 'll, vice president; Hilary
Pomerantz 'l2, secretary; Sonja Spoo
'l3, appointments chair; and Poe
were elected to StuCo.
Poe said that the coalition came
together to bring more accurate representation to StuCo and that they are
continuing to work toward that goal.
"A big complaint that students have
had
in the past is that StuCo is
meant to represent the whole student
body, but in reality it only represents
one kind of student. The IC/BCC coalition is pushing so that it really represented all the students," he said.
This year's coalition began when IC,
BCC and activist groups met to talk on
April 14 about open positions and
brainstorm issues that Student Council
should address in the upcoming term.
Hattem said he attended this meeting
already knowing he wanted to run.
After the initial meeting, the coalition offered platform writing help for
those who wanted it. The candidates
met several times after the initial meeting and
together.
made flyers
According to Poe, all of these things,
...

from the large group meeting to the
postering sessions, were offered to candidates in the coalition last semester as
well.
Mitter-Burke said that while she
was aware of the slating e-mails, she
had no part in sending them.
"[The people sending the e-mails]
are identifying candidates that they see
as having an active stance on StuCo,"
she said.
Mitter-Burke added that her candidacy was not about an. individual
desire to sit on StuCo. "It's not about
my agenda. That's not why I'm interested," she said. "StuCo shouldn't be
just about the individuals on it, but
about the school community. But it also
shouldn't be about specific school communities."
Valelly said that the coalition's
strategy is a common one. "[Slating]
happens regularly in a non-partisan
[it] is a way to tell voters
election
that there are issues
and the way to
solve that issue is to vote for that
slate," he said.
Valelly stressed that slating is not
an unethical practice. "It's pretty
innocuous when you think about it."
He added that at its core the American
party system is simply two well-established slates.

Filmmaker aims to bring out meaningful work in others
BY DANTE FUOCO

As an undergraduate at Cornell
University, next year's Lang Visiting
Professor for Issues of Social Change

Louis Massiah immersed himself in the
physics, cosmolostudy of the sciences
gy, astronomy. Today, however, Massiah
is an award-winning independent filmmaker who has made documentaries
focused on politics and history.
"My initial idea in going to graduate
school was to see if I could develop visual
languages to look at ideas in science,"
Massiah said. But as he had always been
interested in narratives and drama,
Massiah said that he soon realized "the
ability to present history [and] ideas visually has enormous power."
Massiah has directed and produced a
number of documentaries, such as
"W.E.B. Du Bois A Biography in Four
Voices," which looks into the life of the
eponymous figure. His work, which has
appeared on television and at film festivals, has been nominatedfor the Emmys
and received awards from, among other
places, the Global Village Documentary
Film Festival and Columbia-DuPont. He
is also is a recipient of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
Fellowship, nicknamed "The Genius
Grant," for his filmmaking. In addition
to his own work, Massiah founded the
Scribe Center, a media arts center in
Philadelphia that supports local film-

making.

Swat

Style Snapshot

Name: Callie Feingold
Year: 2012
From: London, England and Lincoln, Nebraska
Current Residence: Willets
What She's Wearing:
Feingold bought her oversized L.L. Bean camel coat
at Goodwill, her belt is her mother's and her black
opaque tights are from Target. Her floral dress is from a
store in Cambridge, MA. "My shoes
I call these my
hon-shoes' because instead of them being a statement
item, they're kind of invisible." The quilted, black "nonshoes," a term coined by Feingold's friend Genevieve
Woodhead 'l2 (featured in the Swat Style Snapshot in
the Jan. 28 issue), are from Urban Outfitters. Her purse
is Dooney and Bourke. Her mauve taupe lip color is a
combination of Clinique and M.A.C. lipsticks.
Feingold is spot on with her camel blazer, as camel
and beige are the colors of choice for Fall 2010. The fashion world is in frenzy over the neutral color, with
designers like Chloe, Stella McCartney and Alexander
Wang using the basic hue for coats, pants, sweaters and
dresses. While Feingold's outfit is definitely for colder
weather, she injects a little bit of spring with the floral
dress. Feingold rounds off her outfit with some basic
tights and her "non-shoes," but it's her camel coat that
make her look on-trend.
How She Describes Her Style:
"One time somebody said

my style was like
Victorian cattle-rancher or cowgirl," Feingold said.
Growing up in both London and the Midwest, Feingold
finds her style was heavily influenced by the dichotomy
of these two places in terms of their striking aesthetics.
Feingold also envisions her style to be more like how a
grandmother would dress. "I think I kind of dress like
what a grandmother's house would look like," she said.
"So a lot of florals, curtain-inspired florals and lace and

chunky knits."

Rtion

Influences
and
irations:
i take my experiences in different environments and combine
them in a way that's less expected,"
Feingold said. "I draw inspiration
from cottages in the British countryside and
that urban feel of a city
and then combine [that] with very
practical basics that you find in the
Midwest." Feingold keenly observes
her surroundings and takes inspiration
from anything she fmds aesthetically
beautiful, whether it be a well-dressed
person, the look of a bustling city or a
...

vast prairie.

Where She Shops:

Feingold enjoys "shopping" in her parent's closets, taking cool sweaters or her
brother's old jeans. Besides that, she also
loves shopping at Goodwill and buying
basics from chain stores. She likes
American Apparel, Banana Republic and
J. Crew for basics but loves when "you find
those whimsical extras in unexpected places
when you're not even looking to buy something."
Designers & Blogs She Follows:
"If I weren't a broke college student, there
definitely would be designers that' I would
love to buy their clothes," Feingold said. She
listed Marc Jacobs as one of her favorite designers, with both his eponymous line and Marc by Marc
Jacobs. Feingold also enjoys perusing the pages of fashion blogs, but looks more for the aesthetic, rather than
trying to buy the exact items the person was wearing.

LSE diversifies Worthstock's typically indie lineup
All around campus this past week, students who
will be attending Worthstock 2010 have been talking
about how Man Man is coming to Swarthmore as the
headliner for Worthstock.
This weekend in Worth Courtyard, the campus is
in for another treat as the LSE Committee once again
brings top performers to

the campus. After fall's

is an adventure in and of
itself. Their concerts are
known for creating a fun and energizing atmosphere
by encouraging crowd interaction with their playful
music. As a result, Man Man provides a new way of
experiencing Worthstock that will be interactive, fun
and stimulating.
"It was one of those insanely raucous environments where you just sort ofhave to get used to being
elbowed in the face while dancing around," Alex
Weintraub 'll said of his past experience at a Man
Man concert.
Man Man, an experimental music group from
Philadelphia, is known for blending rock, blues and
pop into raucous music ready to entertain.
Consisting of members with playful monikers
(Honus Honus, Critter Crat, Pow Pow, Chang Wang,
Organ "Turkey Mouth" Freeman and Jefferson), Man
Man is a band that attempts to create emotion and a*
good sound with wide variety of instruments and
other sound sources such as pots, spoons and chopsticks. They not only create music but also an experience of that music that plays with the similarities and
distinctions of the humorous and profound, the
strange and the familiar.
In essence, their songs are quite playful. One of
their better known songs, "Top Drawer" mixes familiar guitar riffs and drum beats with stranger electronic and xylophone tingles as well as random
screams. All the while the lyrics are playfully nonsensical.
The beat is catchy and the lyrics contrast with the
beat to construct an experience that at once entrances
and befuddles the listener with such lyrics as "You
need a new body/You need a new latte/You need the
lingering scent of holiday/men doing hot pilate."
Besides Man Man, the Worthstock lineup shows
diversity with Yukon Blonde, My Brightest Diamond,
Fly.Union, and PicturePlane also performing.
"Worthstock is usually pretty laid back, so we got
the acoustic folk indie music, but we also wanted to
diversify the lineup so we got [a] hip-hop act and Man
Man, who will be very energizing," Ivana Ng 'l2, an
LSE committee member, said.
Yukon Blonde, from Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada, is the only traditional indie acoustic rock
band performing at Worthstock. They started off by
playing and writing music in the back of vans and
parking lots for anyone who would listen, and their
music is uplifting, inspiring and soothing. With their
self-titled debut album released in February, Yukon
Blonde is perhaps on the precipice of mainstream
music royalty.
My Brightest Diamond is the sole female performer
of Worthstock. Born into strong musical family, lead
vocalist Shara Worden blends diverse instruments
into a sound that explores intimacy and friendship.
She majored in vocal performance in college, and her
influences include but are not limited to the films of
Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("Amelie") and Maurice Ravel.
Incorporating her influences and experiences with
music, she continues to explore the combinations that
make pensive and profound indie rock and folk music.
Worden recently collaborated with The Decemberists

12

on their album Hazards of Love, as one of the chilling lead female vocals.
Fly.Union- is a rap group from Columbus, Ohio
whose music is reminiscent of Kanye West in that it
consists of catchy beats and rantish, profound vocals

Iferent

experimental

groups, an acoustic indie
rock group and a rap
group, hopes to draw in a

wide audience.
"Since not all of our
bands are acoustic this
year, it should be interesting to see how the
[usual laidback, mellow] vibe will be broken," LSE
committee member Callie Feingold 'l2 said. "We really wanted to give the campus something a little bit different this year."

almost every other castaway in the

way, to Terry O'Quinn, who is completely wonderful as both Locke and
Fake Locke). However, I'm not sure
that the Man In Black is the completely malevolent force Jacob described to
us. In order to really answer the questhe sidetion, we have to turn to

(Note: the next part of this theory is

presumably as a result of the hydrogen bomb that the castaways set off at
the end of season five, the Smoke

Away from The Hush Sound, exploring summer
On Wednesday, April 28, The
Phoenix's Miriam Hauser interviewed Greta Morgan, former
vocalist and pianist for The Hush
Sound. Morgan is currently working on solo project Gold Motel.
Gold Motel recently released an
EP, and its first album, "Summer
House," will come out on June Ist.
Miriam Hauser: To start off
with, would you tell me what
some ofyour inspirations werefor
Gold Motel?
Greta Morgan: Sure! Well,
it's kind of hard to say exactly,
but a lot of the music I grew up
listening to, like Peter, Paul and
Mary, the Motown collection,
The Kinks, The Beach Boys, The
Beatles, Elvis Costello
Personally, a lot went into it. One
of the biggest influences I think
was living in California. And I'm
a Chicago native, I was used to
like treacherous, awful winters,
and then was finally able to
spend one winter in beautiful
sunshine and just be able to like
just hang outside and write. So I
think sunshine was a big influstarting a new project
ence
was a big influence
sort of
...

...

falling in love was an influence.
MH: Was your process ofworking on writing the songs different
from your process previously?
GM: It was quicker and easier. I think it was simpler and easier this time around. I think I
learned more about songwriting
from experiences of being in The
Hush Sound. I just think I was a
little bit more well prepared for
what I wanted to do.
MH: How has your process
changed? What sort of things did
you learn from your work with
The Hush Sound?
GM: In terms of songwriting,
there's a lot to be learned about
what the idea of a song is and
what the idea of a song should
say. I think just structurally I
learned a lot about being able to
just simplify a song down into
the simplified version of what it
is. I feel like most classic songs
you can kind of sum up in one
sentence. You can say, "This is a
song about losing someone you
love" or "This is a song about
leaving" and I think I was kind
of able to get down to the condensed version of what a simple
song is.

MH: So, how would you
describe your current sound, the
sound of Gold Motel?
GM: Well, I'd say the sound of
the band is very crisp, fresh and
summery, and it's modern, but
it's still a little bit nostalgic. I
think it's hopeful in a way. Even
if the songs are sad, I think
there's this overriding sense of
hopefulness in it.
MH: How has working on a
solo album been different from
working with a band and with a
label?
GM: Well, I have a greater
sense of freedom
And then
also, I think in The Hush Sound
it was an equal writing division
between me and Bob [Morris, cofounder ofThe Hush Sound]. You
know, I started writing all the
songs at first, and then the band
and I had been collaborating on
some of the more recent tunes....
I felt like with The Hush Sound
we would talk about for months
and months and months which
songs would go on an album. We
had some songs, for two or three
years before they made it on an
album. But this, it's like pretty
much all the songs were written
-

...

...

and then recorded and then
released within a period of a few
months.
MH:... How have fans [of The
Hush Sound] been receptive to it?
GM: I would say 95 percent of
the reaction has been really, really positive. I've actually had a lot
of people coming and saying that
they never could get into The
Hush Sound but they really like
Gold Motel. I wasn't really
expecting that, but particularly a
lot of writers have told me that
and then there are of course the
like five percent of Hush Sound
fans that say like, "We only want
The Hush Sound. I don't like
Greta's solo stuff, I don't like
Bob's solo stuff." And I understand that as a listener
MH: Do you hope ever to try
and go back to some of the sounds
that you played with with The
Hush Sound or are you looking
completely in your solo work to
move away from that?
GM: I'm looking totally forward. We've already been running new material beyond
what's going to be on this album
coming out June first, "Summer
House," and then I'm looking for...

...

ward to making the next Gold

Motel album after that, and continuing with the sound that
we've already kind of laid a foundationfor.
MH: Do you think that working as a musician has affected the
way that you listen to music?
GM: Oh, definitely. I mean,
before [The Hush Sound] was
signed, I was just a casual music
listener, you know, I would only
listen in the car
Over the
course of kind of making albums
and touring and whatever, music
became more of a focal point in
my life then it was before
I
think music is the most instantaneous form of expression, and
being able to understand music,
it requires nothing. Like, being
able to understand the novel
"War and Peace" you need to
know how to read, and you need
to have an intellectual capacity
to understand what the writer is
trying to express, but with
music, it's like anyone can
understand it
I like how
instant it is and how instantly it
can affect someone.

World-renowned Irish poets showcase new works
BY NINA PELAEZ
npelaezl@swarthmore.edu

On the evening of April 20, dozens of
students and faculty from Swarthmore
flocked to nearby Villanova University to
attend a reading by renowned Irish poets
Peter Fallon and Seamus Heaney. The
event was packed with poets, students,
academics and locals, all eager to hear the
poets share their work.
The reading was part of the 12th
Annual Villanova Literary Festival.
Fallon and Heaney's readings were the
only event entirely sold out, and also
broadcast in the VU cinema.
"I was thrilled we had such a large
group of people [from Swarthmore] make
it to the reading," English literature professor Nathalie Anderson said. Over 32
students and faculty members made the
trek from Swarthmore over to Villanova to
hear the two poets read their work.

"It was really exciting to have that

many people sharing that particular expe-

rience," Anderson said.
Students who attended the reading
expressed their enthusiasm for the two
poets. "Seamus Heaney is legendary, and I
feel so lucky to have had the opportunity
to hear him read," Hadley Roach 11 said.
The two poets are extremely significant
figures in the canon of contemporary Irish
poetry. Both painted a rich landscape of
their homeland through the poems they
read, whilst weaving amidst them stories
and laughter.
"You could get a real sense of the
humor with which they face everything in
life. The way that humor accepts tribulations by setting it aside
I see that as a
characteristic for both," Anderson said.
The reading was moving not only
because of the exquisite lyricism and
imagery of the poetry, but because it was
filled with warm moments between the

two

poets and Jim Murphy, the founder of
the Irish Studies Program at Villanova.
"I think it sweetened the experience
because those three men know each other
so well and have such a long history with
each other," Anderson said.
Fallon began the reading, sharing
poems that showed sensitivity to the rural
landscape from which he came. Fallon,
who was born in Germany, grew up on a
farm in County Meath, Ireland. At the age
of 18, he founded the Gallery Press, which
has come to be recognized as the most significant publishing company in Ireland.
"I enjoyed Peter Fallon a great deal,"
Michael Duffy 'll said. "I had never heard
his work before but I found him to be a
very gentle and gracious writer."
Seamus Heaney began his reading with
the poem "Digging," which he described as
an effort for him to defend the practice of
writing. Heaney also hails from a rural
background, having grown up on a farm in

the County of Derry.
Roach described Heaney's style and the
elements that have drawn her to his work.
"One of my favorite things about
Heaney's style is his dirtiness and I mean
that in a sodden, boggy, frogspawn-filled
sense," Roach said. She continued by
describing his opening piece as emblematic of his work.
"He's very much a poet of the soil, and
so it was really cool to hear him begin the
reading with 'Digging,'" she said. "It gives
all kinds of insight into the rest ofhis writing, connecting generations of turf-work to
his pen."
The reading was filled with a resonant
energy that came from the persorTal connections between the poets.
"It was immediately clear how much
[the three poets] enjoyed the chance to
read together, and how much their writing
had been shaped by a sense of community," Roach said.

College must confront Arizona Student options in Africa

The bill Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed
into law last Friday has reminded activists why
they want immigration reform. The bill, SBIO7O,
would make the failure to carry immigration documentation criminal under state law, authorizing

not only federal officers to apprehend illegal
immigrants, as has always been the case, but
expanding this power to state police. Moreover, it
requires police officers to stop anyone who
appears to be an illegal immigrant and to apprehend them if they are not carrying immigration
documents. Those who are not carrying appropriate documentsmight face jail time, court fees and

other harassments.
While the bill appears to come out of the blue,
it is in fact the result ofArizona's increasing problems with illegal immigration: "The Economist"
explains in its latest issue that Arizona faces the
most border crossings of any state and now experiences drug-related crime that spills over from
Mexico, including the recent shooting of a border
rancher. These are serious problems, but they do
not vindicate the racist law recently passed,
which discriminates against Hispanics and violates civil liberties.
Two related effects make the bill unconstitutional and dangerous. First, it directly targets
Hispanics, who will be a primary target for discrimination based on their physical appearance,
resulting in harm not only to illegal immigrants
but also to the countless Hispanic Americans who
are here legally. In addition, it perpetuates the
idea that all Hispanics in the U.S. are here illegally. Punitive laws against specific groups are
banned in the Constitution for the good reason
that they violate the spirit of equality. Illegal
immigrants, too, deserve protection from targeted
discrimination by the authorities.
Second, the new law violates the civil liberties
of everyone who lives in Arizona or visits the
state. Requiring individuals to always carry proof
of national identification while in Arizona
breaches privacy and changes the role of the
police from guards ofcitizens' safety to investigators, a job that requires federal oversight and for
which they are not trained.
We must emphasize too that the new law puts
police officers in an extremely uncomfortable situation. Presumably, the state of Arizona will not
provide the police with a description of "typical"

letter

to

illegal immigrants, because it would undoubtedly
face even greater legal issues than it does already.
As a result, officers on the ground will be forced
to be racist and check on citizens or aliens when
they do nothing wrong or face job loss if they do
not execute their orders. The law, in fact, specifically encourages citizens to keep tabs on the state
police to ensure they carry out their new orders.
History has shown time and again that dangerous
expansions of police power are often a prelude to
the formation of a police state with terrible consequences for civil and political rights.
The Phoenix was glad to see that students,
upon learning of the Arizona law, promptly organized protests. Some wore provocative signs carrying slogans such as "In Arizona, would you arrest
me?" and others met to create posters that they
put up around campus. It's important to remem-

ber that some Swarthmore students are
Arizonans and that others plan to visit the state
and may now be exposed to institutionalized discrimination. But on the whole, Swatties should be
concerned because it violates the rights of a large
group of Americans that is already marginalized.
A boycott of Arizona based on avoiding the
state as a destination for official college trips
would send a strong message, especially if other
institutions and organizations follow suit.
Swarthmore should not wait to join others in a
boycott—it should reach out to others and be a
leader in such a movement. The Phoenix would
like to see a coalition of students, members of the
administration and perhaps members of the
Board of Managers that would articulate college
opposition, outline immediate measures and
reach out to peer colleges to act together. Such

inter-college cooperation, mentioning the discrimination members of our community will now
face in Arizona, could send Arizonans a strong
message that they must repeal this law before it
becomes active in August.
The college prides itself on its acceptance of

individuals and groups from different backgrounds. It should translate this acceptance into
taking the lead in an effort to tell Arizona that it
has gone too far. Moreover, while the passage and
enactment of this outrageous law is not a consequence of congressional inaction on immigration
reform, it stresses the urgent need to put the issue
on the national agenda.

the

police departments and state agencies in
enforcing federal immigration law,
authorizing both criminal and civil
penalties for noncompliance. Any person, when asked, would be forced to
prove their immigration status or face
jail time, a fine and court costs, even if
they are later found to be a legal resident.

While Arizona drivers' licenses would
be valid in proving citizenship, many
out-of-state licenses would not be, so a
visit -to Arizona requires a birth certificate or visa.

Boycotting Arizona a tried technique
To the Editor,
As a college alumnus from Arizona, I
am writing to encourage the college, faculty and all student organizations to follow the lead of Arizona Rep. Raul
Grijalva and boycott Arizona until such
time as its recently-passed, regressive
and racist immigration bill is either
repealed or overturned.
I'm sure many in the college community are aware of the unfortunate and
likely unconstitutional bill that has
passed, which would deputize local

BY BERNARD POLLACK

The college would be following precedent it set in 2000, when it pledged to
move spring athletic team training from
South Carolina in recognition of a widespread boycott of that state over the flying of the Confederate flag over the state
capitol. Many student and faculty conferences were also moved from South
Carolina for the duration of that conflict.
Would such a boycott of Arizona
work? Indeed, it already has. In the 1980s,
Arizona refused to recognize Martin
Luther King Jr. Day. A concerted boycott
throughout the country changed many

Arizonans' opinions on the matter, and
they voted in referendum to overrule the
state legislature in recognizing the holiday.

Arizona has been hit hard by the
recession, and has regrettably chose to
use immigrants as scapegoats. Arizonans
undoubtedly could use your dollars
but we could use your moral leadership
more.

I urge the college to consider such a
boycott.

the college's budget.
When it comes to the
Budget Break-down
college's budget, three
organizations are particularly important: the
Finance Committee, the Financial Planning Group, and
the Board of Managers. Four more groups of people,
which sometimes overlap with the previously named
groups, are the Audit Subcommitee, the Investment
Committee, the Property Committee and the Committee
on Investor Responsibility. All of these groups are aided
in their work by the Finance Office staff, headed by
Vice President for Finance Suzanne P. Welsh, who also
serves as the college's treasurer.
The college's budget starts with a recommendation
from a familiar face: President Chopp. Her recommended budget is reviewed by the Finance Committee, which
is also responsible for administering the college's various trusts and for reviewing the college's five year plan
and major programs (such as the financial aid program). This committee is composed of 10 members of
the Board of Managers. At present, all of the members
of the Finance Committee are Swarthmore alums, representing graduation years ranging from 1954 to 1978.
The current chair of the committee is Thomas E. Spock
'7B and the current vice chair is Richard Barasch '75.
The Finance Committee, in turn, submits a recommended budget to the full Board of Managers. While
most Swarthmore students have heard of the Board of
Managers, many have not had the chance to learn much
about the group responsible for many of the big decisions affecting Swarthmore. The Board is made up of 34
members who serve in staggered terms and are appointed by the Board itself. It does most of its work through
its eight committees: Academic Affairs, Development
and Communication, Finance, Investment, Nominating
and Governance, Property, Social Responsibility and
Student Affairs. In general, the Board operates by consensus (though there have been some notable exceptions, such as the decision to abolish football). The full
board meets on campus four times a year, twice in the
fall (generally in September and in December) and
twice in the spring (generally in February and in May).
This year, as in most years, the Board voted to adopt the

following fiscal year's operating budget (which goes
into effect in July) at the February meeting.
Just who are these managers? Among current members (including those whose terms will end in May
2010), all but one (former dean and honorary degree
recipient Janet Dickerson),are Swarthmore alumni. For
comparison to peer schools, four of the 20 non-staff
members of Amherst's Board of Trustees are not alums
of Amherst, while all current trustees of Williams
College are Williams alums. Swarthmore's managers
represent a broad swath of alums, ranging in graduation year (among non-emeritus members) from Garnet
Sages like Bruce Jay Gould '54 to familiar young alum
faces like Danielle Toaltoan 'O7. Several members have
names familiar to students because they or their families have generously donated to support facilities or
programs on campus, such as Jane Lang '67, Elizabeth
H. Scheuer '75, Giles Kemp '72 and Frederick W. Kyle
'54.
However, the body is as diverse in its interests as
Swarthmore is, with members representing a wide
variety of careers and locations. Barbara W. Mather '65
currently serves as chair and Neil R. Grabois '57 serves
as vice chair. Outside of these 34 members, the board
has five emereti members (Julia Lange Hall '55, Jerome
Kohlberg, Jr. '46, Elizabeth MeCormack, Marge Scheuer
'4B, and Larry Shane '56) and two ex officio members
(President Chopp and Sabrina Martienez '92). Longtime Swarthmore patron Eugene M, Lang '3B serves as
the emeritus chair of the board. (In the interest of full
disclosure: as a Lang Opportunity Scholar, I have been
especially fortunate as a recipient of Lang's generosity)

THE PHOENIX

The Financial Planning Group is a temporary and
relatively new addition -to the team overseeing
Swarthmore's budget, having been created to deal with
the impacts of the economic crisis on Swarthmore's
budgets. Its members included Managers, members of
the administration, faculty representatives, and

Swarthmore staff members. It was this group that recommended both rounds of budget cuts discussed in previous columns in response to the recession's impact on
the college's bottom line.
Swarthmore's investments, a key source of
Swarthmore's funds, are overseen by the Investment
Committee, which works with the Board of Managers,
Finance Office staff, and hired outside consultants. The
committee is composed of Swarthmore board members
and other alums and advisors and works closely with
the administration, particularly Mark Amstutz, the
managing director of Swarthmore's investments, and
Lori Ann Johnson, Director of Investment Operations
and Assistant Treasurer.
While the Investment Committee does not include
student members, the Committee on Investor
Responsibility, which was formed in 1997 in response to
student requests for more input into college investing
policy, does. The Committee on Investor Responsibility
advises the Investment Committee on ethical investing
policies and abides by voting guidelines that articulate
these principles, including those recommended by the
Coalition for Socially Responsible Economies, the college's commitment to equal employment opportunity
(with an especially emphatic commitment to protecting
LGBTQ individuals) and the International Labor
Organization's Declaration of Fundamental Principles
and Rights at Work. Current students members of this
committee are Kun Hee Kim 'll and Sahiba Gill 'l2,
whose terms will end at the conclusion of this school
year.
Two final groups of people are important for their
role in the budget process. First, the Audit
Subcommitee of the Finance Committee arranges an

annual independent audit of the college's books and
oversees various other college policies to ensure the college's accounting and finances are being handled appropriately. Its members are all current board members
and the current chair is Richard Barasch '75. Finally,
the Property Committee works with the college to oversee the various grounds, equipment, and other properties of the college, including approving and planning all
construction or renovation and managing all of the college real estate. David Singleton '6B serves as the current chair and the committee works closely with
Executive Assistant for Facilities and Services Paul
Dale, Vice President for Facilities and Services Stuart
Hain and Director of Planning and Construction Jane
Semler.
While this column may be ending, the stream of
information on the college's budget is not. The college's
Finance Office, headed up by Treasurer Sue Welsh,
issues an annual financial report at the end of each fiscal year, as well as numerous other reports, which are
published on the office's website. A report from the Ad
Hoc Financial Planning Group, which recommended
ways for the college to adjust for the recession, can be
found there as well. This site can be accessed from the
student dashboard. As a nonprofit, the college is also
required to file a 990 tax form each year. This form,
which provides greater, if often opaque or confusing,
information, can be accessed online at guidestar.org.
Finally, students with specific questions or concerns
can always contact the appropriate staff or committee
members.
It has been a privilege and pleasure to explore the
college's budget with you over the past several weeks. I
hope that this column has provided readers with a bit
more informationabout how the college's budget works
and the ways in which we are students are tremendously fortunate to benefit from the generosity of alums
and friends of the college.
This column has only scratched the surface of the
vast amount there is to know about philanthropy and
the college's budget. I urge all students to educate themselves as much as possible about both the donation and
the spending side of the college's budget and with that
education in mind to get involved in the decision-making process. After all, the group that is ultimately most
affected by the way the budget breaks down is us,
Swarthmore's students.

grade inflation

BY LYNDSEY WAJERT

GWHATCHET.COM, APRIL 22,

2010

Oft-mentioned sentiments from experts in higher education and high school guidance counselors say that as long
as students work hard and do their best, it won't matter
whether they choose a public university or a private one.
After all, the amount of work students put in at either
school should be proportional to the grade they receive. But

a study released last month indicates otherwise.
According to the study published in the Teachers College
Record, a comparison of 80 four-year colleges and universities showed that over the past 50 years, the rate of grade
inflation has gone up, with private universities surpassing
public universities in the trend. George Washington U. was
one of the universities studied. Looking at contemporary
grading data from 160 schools, private colleges had a grade
point average of 3.3 while public schools had a GPA of 3.0.
This is not an indication that students at private universities are smarter than those at public ones. According to
the study, students were equally qualified based on SAT
scores and other factors.
A large factor in GPAs is the rate of grade inflation, and
private universities are .the bigger offenders, the study
found. The findings are especially interesting, seeing as the
common perception is that private universities have a more
rigorous curriculum than public ones. One would expect
GPAs to be lower at these schools. And while this may not
seem like the worst phenomenon to GW students, the study
highlights the possible negative effects of grade inflation
and the need for schools across the country to level out the
playing field.
For example, grade inflation at any school gives students
a false sense of security. When we get to graduate school,
law school or our first jobs and realize we aren't the A students we were back in college, part of the blame falls on

inflated GPAs.
Institutions of higher education have a responsibility to
their students to curb grade inflation, but any effort to simply reexamine grading policies will require all schools to
make the same effort. While some schools, such as
Princeton U., have attempted to lead the charge, others still
continue to round up. In early April, Loyola Law School of
Los Angeles reportedly announced a plan to increase
grades by a third. According to a dean's memo published by
the website Above the Law, "what previously was a Bwould be a B, what previously was a B would be a B+, and
so forth." This collective action problem presents a need for
higher education to implement ways that would level out

grades for everyone.
Seeing as grade inflation has been on the rise over the
past 50 years, any effort to reduce it would need to be both
national and even coerced. If colleges and universities are
penalized for grade inflation with such consequences as losing accreditation or falling in national rankings, there
would be an incentive to stop inflating grades. A national
range of average GPAs, calculated based on grading data
from schools across the country, could act as the gauge for
possible indicators of grade inflation. If a university's average GPA falls too drastically outside of that range, that
school's grading practices should be investigated. If results
of an investigation show that grades have been inflated, the

school should face the aforementioned consequences and
end the detrimental practice. Otherwise, the rising trend
will continue for years to come. Hopefully at that point it
won't be too late to gauge the difference between a "real" A
and an inflated one.
Additionally, if administrators used averages to track
the way professors have graded in both current and previous jobs, they could then focus on hiring only the professors
who do not inflate grades. This speaks to the sources of
grade inflation, and would reduce the number of professors
who are too willing to hand out good grades to those who
don't deserve them.
as students at a private university may have an
apparent advantage now, but it may hurt us later.
Unfortunately, unless there is an incentive to stop or a
penalty for grade inflation, a harmful trend will continue to
rise. Higher education as a whole must act accordingly. In
the mean time, we will need to be cognizant of the fact that
in the post-graduation race, our unfair advantage means
that grads from public universities may have a slightly better grasp of what work actually deserves an A.

Lacrosse teams wrap up the season on Senior Day
BY MARCUS MELLO

mmello2@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday, April 24, the
men's and women's lacrosse
teams finished off the season with
the seniors playing the final
games of their careers
at
Swarthmore. Though both teams
lost to their respective opponents
on Senior Day, they played with
great effort throughout the season. Several athletes had outstanding seasons. With the men
falling to Haverford College and
the women falling to Dickinson
College, the seniors of both teams
played on Clothier Field for the
last time.

The women's lacrosse team
ended the year with an overall
record of 7-9. The team's conference record was 1-8, ninth out of
10 conference teams. The women's
only conference win was an 18-5
blowout against Bryn Mawr earlier in April. Head Coach Karen
Borbee, who has been serving the
position since 1993, said, "We had
our ups and downs this season but
overall I think we learned a lot."
Senior captain Allison Grein
stated that the final record does
not reflect the intensity and energy her team brought to the field.
"We had some amazing games
this year
I feel as though our
season was very successful."
After graduating a strong senior
class last spring, the Garnet ladies
rose to the challenge of filling in
the gaps and had some especially
...

strong games.
Grein herself had a strong senior year, topping the Centennial
Conference in saves per game
(9.50) and racking up a total of 152,
the most in the conference.
Grein's save percentage (.469) was
the eighth best in the conference.

Grein that she is especially proud

of the amount of interceptions and
turnovers she caused this year.

Grein said that it is bittersweet
for her career to come to a close.
"I've had some amazing memories
and I have loved all my teammates that I have played with
here, but I am ready to move on
from Swarthmore...."
In addition to Grein, attacker
Annelise Mowry 'l2 and midfielder Marie Mutryn 'l2 established
themselves as conference threats.
Both players finished ranked in
the conference in goals per game
(Mowry with 2.25 and Mutryn
with 2.06).
The Garnet will also be returning midfielders Beth Martin 13
and Maddie Williams 'l2, who
both had.solid seasons. "They had
incredible endurance all season
during every game. Not only did
they play fantastic defense, they

said of her

teammates.

Borbee said that she is excited
for next season. "We have a real-

ly good recruiting class coming in
and a talented and experienced
group of returners. If we take all
we learned this season and bring
it ready to work hard next season,
we will have a very successful
year."

University (8-7).

Head coach Pat Gress said that
although the win-loss record was
disappointing, the players clearly
improved during the season. He
said that the team played its best
lacrosse in the final game against
Haverford College, a team that finished third in the conference.
Despite a 7-6 loss to the Fords, the
Garnet played tough lacrosse,
scoring four consecutive goals in
the third period. But the Fords
came back in the fourth period
and captured the win. Six Garnet
players netted goals in the final
game of the season.

Anthony Phalen 'lO, a Garnet
midfielder, said that the season
was somewhat disappointing in
that his team had a lpt of close
games that resulted in one or two
point losses. According to him,
however, the team still found sucit was tough to
cess. "Although
suffer so many close defeats we
were able to come together as a
team and play solid lacrosse. The
fact that we played close against
some of the toughest teams in the
country is evidence of our team's
abilities, despite our record."
On an individual level, captains Tyler Bradshaw 'lO and
Kevin Friedenberg 'lO established
themselves as forces in the
Centennial Conference. Both
players were named Centennial
Conference players of the week at
some point in the season.
According to Gress, this season was Bradshaw's best. The
attacker's statistics were impressive. In conference standings,
Bradshaw finished in a tie for second in goals per game (2.46), 10th
in assists per game (0.92), third in
points per game (3.38), and fifth in
shots per game (7.23). Garnet
attacker Gavin Musynske 'lO was
also fifth in shots per game.
Overall, Bradshaw scored 32 goals
and had 12 assists and 44 points on
the year. The senior also ended
his career with over 100 career
goals, a huge accomplishment in
lacrosse. Teammate Phalen said
that Bradshaw had an unbelievable season. "Tyler played incredibly from an offensive standpoint
even when opposing teams were
trying to eliminate him from the
game." Bradshaw's strongest
offensive game was against
...

Christopher Newport University,

during which he scored a careerhigh of five goals, and four more

in the same week.

Friedenberg,
the Garnet
goalie, registered a total of 162
saves, the most in the conference.
He averaged 12.46 saves per game,
the most in the conference, and
his save percentage was .570, the
fifth highest in the conference.
Regarding his teammate, Phalen

said, "Kevin was the foundation of
our defense and kept us in every
single game because of his stellar
play in net." In his final game, he
had 11 saves. Friedenberg played
what Gress described as another
great year for the Garnet.

They will be missed."
Though Gress said that it is too
early to tell how much of an
impact the loss of the seniors will
have on next season, the team was
young this year and will be

"Wes Marcik [l3], John Bukawyn
