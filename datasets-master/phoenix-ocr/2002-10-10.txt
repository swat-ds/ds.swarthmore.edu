Health plan's benefits
are cut as costs rise
Prescription coverage changed to co-payment plan
BY GREG NELSON

gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

When Kasia Koziol-Dube 'O3 tore her Anterior
Cruciate Ligament (ACL) playing lacrosse two
years ago, she faced the inevitable struggle with
the pain of the injury, the subsequent surgery
and the disappointment of being kept off the playing field. But after all that there was still another
set of problems to be dealt with, problems of the
kind that are becoming as much a part of medical
care in this country as doctors and hospital beds:
problems with insurance companies.
At the time Koziol-Dube injured herself on the
lacrosse field, she was covered by her father's
health insurance policy, a benefit that he
received, as most Americans do, through his
employer. What Koziol-Dube did not realize is
that when she chose to have her surgery per-

formed in the Swarthmore area rather than
returning home to Connecticut, she was no
longer covered by her father's plan.

Because Koziol-Dube got hurt playing a sport,
her surgery was automatically covered by the
college's athletic health insurance policy.
According to a document all of Swarthmore's athletes sign at the beginning of each season, they
are covered for any "claims resulting from the
practice or play of intercollegiate or club athletics" that are not covered by their family or general college health plan.
This document has no bearing on students
who are only covered by the college's general
medical plan; the general plan excludes coverage
for injuries on the field, which are automatically
covered by a separate athletic plan. To athletes,
however, this second policy is crucial, especially
in cases like Koziol-Dube's; her insurance plan
refused to pay for an operation outside of
Connecticut. This meant that Swarthmore's athletic insurance policy was forced to cover the
entire cost of the surgery.

The premiums for Swarthmore's athletic accident insurance plan and its general student medical insurance plan are determined each year by
a method known in the industry as "experience
rating." The price Swarthmore pays
which
determines student premiums
for both insurance plans is not set according to a national standard for universities or even for small liberalarts colleges; it is simply determined by the total
value of the claims Swarthmore has made in the
past. And according to Bob Gross, who plays an
integral role in negotiating the college's coverage
each year, "our experience rating is not good.'"
This poor experience rating, coupled with the
rising cost of health care nationwide and a troubled economy, is the reason that Swarthmore's
student medical coverage costs more and covers
less than it did last year.
College policy states that all Swarthmore students who are not adequately covered by their
family's insurance or their own personal policies
are required to pay a $665 premium to join
Swarthmore's plan. This year just over 400 did so,

either because they were otherwise uninsured or
because Swarthmore's plan was superior to any
alternative. The premium is just $26 higher than
it was last year, but there have been some significant cuts in what the plan covers.
Like last year's plan, this year's will cover
each of its members up to $50,000 per illness. This
means that the plan is generous, compared to
many other plans, in covering major medical

problems.
But for a regular doctor's visit, this year's
plan will pay just 80 percent of the bill, and it will
only pay that amount for health care providers
within Swarthmore's network (the Coalition
American, Inc., multistate network). Only 60 percent of the cost of visits to health care providers
outside of the network is covered.

See INSURANCE, pg. 7

How the prescription drug plan may affect you
Most won't be drastically affected by the
new co-payment system for prescription drugs;
those who will be hardest hit will be those who
need the system most, those who must pay for
expensive prescription drugs in the short term.
A strict percentage-based system won't
substantially raise total costs. The old system
charged $lO for each individual prescription
of a brand name drug, and $5 for each prescription of a generic drug. The new one
charges 20 percent of the price across the
board. Since brand name drugs typically run
to about $5O to $6O and generics from $2O to
$3O, the cost to the patient won't drastically
change. The $6OO hard cap on coverage
remains the same under both systems.
There are wrinkles in the system, though,
especially for those in unusual situations.
Someone taking a powerful antibiotic, like
ciprofloxacin or Cipro, for a localized infection
(like the well-publicized cases of anthrax) is an
example. The patient will likely only take it for a
month or two. Cipro runs around $lOO for a
month's prescription; under the old system, he
would pay $lO a month for the few months he
was on it and perhaps not incur significant drug
costs for the rest of the year, paying a total of

$lO to $2O. Under the new system, he'd end
up paying 20 percent of the cost every month,
or $2O each month; the cost would then run
from $2O to $4O, double the old cost. If the situation is longer-term, such as a student taking
a $lOO-a-month prescription of Zoloft to treat a
six-month-long episode of clinical depression,
the student might pay $l2O instead of $6O.
Even when a student takes expensive
drugs for his whole college career, such as an
antipsychotic drug like Depakote with costs
that can run to $2OO a month or more, the
older system gives them better support that
the newer one. Under the old plan, a student
would only pay $lO for medication for the first
three months of the year, followed by a $3O
coverage for the fourth month before hitting
the $6OO cap; the new plan forces a student
to shoulder $2OO for each month and to get
reimbursements of only $l6O each month, followed by $l2O coverage for the fourth month,
when he'd hit the cap. The same $6OO is paid
out, but under the first plan coverage is distributed so that a student can go through the
first three months with freedom to save up,
while in the second, financial planning
becomes much tighter.

Once voted the most effective American governor by his fellow governors, Michael Dukakis spoke on America's 42 million uninsured.

Dukakis speaks on
America's uninsured
BY GREG NELSON

gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
Speaking without notes in his slight Boston accent and confidently
pacing the stage, Michael Dukakis entertained, educated and then
attempted to persuade a capacity crowd at the Lang Performing Arts
Center last Thursday.

The three-time governor of Massachusetts and former Presidential
candidate gave the crowd a crash course in the history of his favorite
issue health care and then argued that the United States needs to
institute a Universal health care policy.
But before he delved in to these more serious subjects, he took the
time to warm up the crowd with a few jokes. "These things can be dangerous," he said just after taking the stage, referring to the microphone
fastened to his lapel, and went on to tell a story about one St. Patrick's
Day in Chicago, when a microphone he was wearing was left on and
picked up a conversation with his wife. "I said 'when you get back to
the hotel tonight, wake me up.' And then I said a few other things. I
forgot C-Span had miced me up and all this went out over the airwaves
and all this was heard by an awful lot of people, including our younger
daughter ... who promptly called me up and said, 'Dad, I was so embar-

-

rassed.'"

"It's been half a century trying to do what
every advanced, industrialized nation has
done years, and that is to provide basic
health care for all their citizens.
Michael Dukakis '55
...

Later in on in the evening, in what would turn out to be one of several lighthearted jabs at members of his opposing political party,
Dukakis remarked, "there are ways for a defeated presidential candidate to continue to find credibility and recognition, but I had no interest in becoming a spokesman for erectile dysfunction."
With a chuckling crowd behind him, Dukakis entered into a brief
discourse on the history of the fight for universal health care in the
United States that took him from Truman to Clinton in a matter of min-

utes.
In 1971 he noted, "a well-known left-leaning liberal named Richard
Milhouse Nixon proposed universal health care to the people of the
United States" in a message to Congress.
The bill might have passed, he said, if it not for an incident corn-

After a summer in Cuba, a speech for 'EI Presidents

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Yasmin Khawja 'O3 doesn't like seeing things in black
and white. And, after spending last spring semester at the
Universidad de la Habana in Havana, Cuba, she has
become even more attuned to shades of gray. Her experiences in Cuba have given her a unique political ideology
that may cause many Americans to stop and reconsider
their own views.
Khawja's semester abroad progressed without major
incident until her last week in Cuba, when she was suddenly informed that she had been selected to represent all
the American students participating in Butler University's
Cooperating Programs in the Americas (COPA). Khawja
was invited to speak at a gathering of former President
Jimmy Carter, his American delegation, Cuban President
Fidel Castro, other Cuban dignitaries, and Cuban and
American students.
The evening's main focus was Carter's nationally televised address to the Cuban people. Khawja got to share the
spotlight when she gave a six-minute speech in Spanish
about her and her fellow students' experiences during
their four months in Cuba. "I was asked to speak about the
experiences of the American students in Cuba and keep it
as [apolitical] as possible," she explained.
The next morning Khawja was invited to Carter's
farewell dinner in the Palacio de la Revolucion, and spoke
with both Carter and Castro. Since she had wanted to
meet Castro since high school, a dream was coming true,
and her excitement when describing "Fidel" was palpable.
Meeting Castro lived up to Khawja's high expectations.
"He's a genius in economics, personal relations, politics
and religion," she asserted. She was also very impressed
with his resilience, and explained that it was incredible to
meet "somebody who has the guts to stand up to an
American superpower."
As much as Khawja respects Castro, she recognized
that it can be hard to see his actions as positive while the
Cuban economy falters. "There are a lot of internal deficiencies in Cuba that can and should be addressed to help
improve their economic hardships," she said.
Khawja also noted that the U.S. embargo isn't helping
the economic situation. She saw the effects of the embargo
daily while there, she said. "[The embargo] is completely
outdated, useless, and a personal vendetta of U.S. government officials who have an inferiority complex and pretty
much can't stand to have their pride hurt," she said.
Not all her expectations ofCuba were realized during her
months abroad. She expected to find that all Cubans were selfsufficient, happy and ardent supporters of Castro. "I learned it
was much more complicated than what I thought," she said.
But even after witnessing the many difficulties Cubans
face daily, Khawja remains a supporter of Castro's philosophy. "I still very much believe that it's the underlying ideology and unrelenting emphasis on specific values by
Castro, despite outside opposition and not much ideological external support, that has gotten Cuba to the point of
development that it is at," she said.

Cuban dictator Fidel Castro with Yasmin Khawja after her speech on her summer experiences in Cuba this summer.
Khawja's experiences have led her to conclude that the
United States and Cuba are not as different as one might
think. In her opinion; both countries have many positives
and negatives. Just because each nation does things differently doesn't make one method better than another. "The
emphasis is placed by the government on things they
believe to be important," she said.
Khawja argued that there are definite flaws with the
American system, so Americans should not be so quick to
attack communism. She described the Cuban system,
explaining the underlying humanistic ideals inspiring it.
"Democracy is not the only way to be," she said.
In her months abroad, Khawja witnessed how a set of
universal values was very much instilled in the Cuban
people. These values led her to question the shortcomings
of American democracy. "I think that most of us who went
saw a lot of the flaws of the American system," she said.
Since returning from Cuba, Khawja has been struck by
how strongly opinionated many Americans are on issues

Cuba. "I think Americans, all of us, need to
think about our views on the situation," she said.
She believes everyone would benefit from asking themselves what they really know about Cuba and Castro, and
where they are getting this information. "The American view
on Cuba is so restricted by the media and political powers that
it has just propelled ignorance from lack of contact," she said.
Back in May, Khawja ended her speech with this line:
"What I have offered have been our experiences, not solutions; although, through our experiences here, we know
that we are part of the solutions." The solution to the conflict between the United States and Cuba is not one that
can be easily resolved, she said, but is determined to try.
Through efforts like Khawja's, she said, the American
people might begin to reconsider more than just their attitudes towards Cuba. Khawja hopes that in questioning
their biases towards Cuba, Americans will begin to ask
"more questions about what's going on right now and what
we're involved in all over the world."

A changed alcohol policy one year later
Changes are taking hold, but most agree they're not affecting students' underage drinking
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE

aarondil@swarthmore.edu

A year after the college's alcohol policy
was modified, and Party Associates (PAs)
started marking hands at party doors, students and administrators agree that changes
have taken place but have not affected
underage students' access to alcohol.
Last October, the Deans' Advisory
Committee imposed new rules on all
groups that wished to host a party. These
rules require PAs to check students' IDs for
age as well as tri-college status and to mark
the hands of students under 2L
The changes were made as part of a rou-

tine review of the college's alcohol policy,

but they were motivated in part by the discovery that three teenagers from the borough of Swarthmore were served alcohol at

a party held by the Ultimate Frisbee team

in September 200
L
This year's Ultimate Frisbee team party,

which took place Saturday night, happened

without incident and showed the new policy
in action. "They were checking IDs," said
Anna Cable 'O6, a Frisbee team member who
attended the party. "There was someone at
the door, and they blocked off the other
doors. You had to get something on your
hand. I didn't see any non-Swatties there."
According to Associate Dean for Student
Life Tedd Goundie, the change in the alcohol
policy was intended "to help hosts determine
the age of students at parties." Goundie
believes most PAs are implementing the policy. "Last year I did hear occasional reports of
people not being marked as under 21," he said.
"I think the PAs for the most part are marking people's hands. Some groups, DU in par-

ticular, have taken the policy a step further
and [are] having someone put a wristband on
the people the PA marks as underage."
The policy's overall goal, Goundie said,
remains the same. It serves "to focus on
abuse of alcohol and reducing risk," he said.
But Goundie does not feel the new policy has attained this goal yet. "The bottom
line is it's still the responsibility of the
hosts of the events, and my honest assessment is that different hosts treat underage
drinking differently," he said.
By and large, that means underage students have access to alcohol.
Still, Goundie added, "I think [the
change] certainly raised awareness. It's
important that people understand that
Swarthmore isn't some sanctuary above the
law and that they know what the consequences for serving underage drinkers are."

October 10, 2002

Overall, there have been few alcoholrelated problems this year. "I haven't been
getting negative reports about parties this

year," Goundie said.
The shortage of PAs seems to have been
alleviated by the PA orientation two weeks
ago. "We actually had a good turnout at the
orientation: at least 25 new PAs were
there," Goundie said. "I've heard that the
coordinators have heard from 5-10 other
people. They're going to do another smaller
training session for them. I think that'll put
us in pretty good shape."
Still, there might yet be a PA shortage
toward the semester's end. "The end of the
year is always harder, as any person who
employs students on campus knows,"
Goundie noted. "If we don't have enough
PAs, the responsibilities will just devolve
to the hosts."

Carrying on Gandhi's legacy in Center City
BY PREETY SIDHU

ssidhul@swarthmore.edu

Fifteen Swarthmore students went into
Philadelphia to help refurbish inner-city
schools as part of the National Gandhi Day
of Service last Saturday. They joined thousands of other students from nearly 200
institutions across the country to commemorate the 133rd anniversary of
Gandhi's birth with acts of service to local
communities.
The National Gandhi Day of Service
was first organized four years ago by the
Indian American Student Association at
the University of Michigan. It went national in 1999, and the number of participating
institutions has more than doubled each
subsequent year. It is currently sponsored
by the nonprofit organization South Asian

American Leaders of Tomorrow (SAALT),
which is dedicated to building leadership
and civic engagement within the SouthAsian-American community.
This is the first year that Deshi, the
Swarthmore South Asian Association, has
sponsored Gandhi Day at Swarthmore. The
project was organized by co-presidents
Sachin Kale 'O4 and Nicola Wells 'O5 and
Deshi member Shreya Mahajan 'O5.
Kale was pleased by the enthusiastic
response of the students. "A lot of people
can be apathetic and it's hard to get them
motivated sometimes," he said. "I only sent

out one e-mail and there was no other
advertising, and still about half the people
who volunteered were not regular members of Deshi. People were willing to get up

early on a Saturday morning and devote a
whole day to community service the week

before midterms."
The program leaders originally wanted
the group to volunteer in Chester. Due to
events surrounding the inaugural ceremony of Widener University's new president,
however, all volunteer spaces in Chester
that day were booked. Instead, Deshi
signed up for Philly Cares Day, a day on

which several thousand

vol-

unteers gathered to beautify inner city
schools. The event happened to fall on the
same Saturday as Gandhi Day. Students
from Bryn Mawr, UPenn, and Temple also
did their Gandhi Day service in conjunction with Philly Cares Day.
"It was nice to see Deshi collaborating
with other Swatties and Philadelphia citizens in a project directed towards and
incorporating the greater community,"

Kale said.
The group met at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday

donned matching Gandhi Day Tshirts and took two student activities vans
to Germantown High School. By 10 o'clock
they had finished registering, grabbed
some paint rollers, and headed out to the

benches. When the work was done, the vol-

unteers had a free lunch provided by the
Philly Cares organizers at the Mann Center
then returned to Swarthmore, tired but
proud of having done a solid day's work.
"I was happy that we could see the effect
of what we did and that it was not distant,"
Mamta Jhaveri 'O6 said. "I was also excited
that so many colleges participated."

SC finalizes shuttle plans, worries about student wages
Proposal for self-scheduled exams approved despite reported misgivings from Hungerford
BY CYNTHIA WU
xwu2@swarthmore.edu

With the proposed vans to Philadelphia nearing reality,
Student Council addressed Monday how the vans will be
organized. Additionally, the council debated three other
issues, including a proposition to restructure the final exam
process.

The possibility of eliminating PDC requirements:
Education Policy Representative Lester Tran 'O3 reported
that the Council on Educational Policy (CEP) is discussing
the possibility of replacing the current Primary Distribution
Course (PDC) requirements with a more general distributional requirement, and eliminating PDCs altogether. The
possibility of offering more freshman seminars is also being
considered. Student Council will further discuss the matter
once it receives a proposal of changes from the CEP.

The shuttle to Philadelphia:
Budish was happy to report that the council is "in the
process of choosing a starting date" for the weekend shuttle
to Philadelphia. Council members discussed possible start
dates and tentatively set the first dates to be October 25 and
26. Those dates coincide with Discovery Weekend, when
minority prospective students will be visiting on campus.
Professional drivers will most likely be hired for the Philly

concerns over three potential problems. First, students
might need slides for certain exams (such as Art History)
and would need to take their finals in a big group. Some faculty would like to proctor their own exams in order to
answer any questions about the test. Finally, Hungerford felt
that this whole process might "necessitate an honor code"
because "the faculty doesn't like cheating."
After much discussion, the council added the note "excep-

first concern.
The second point was more problematic because it raised
concerns over the possibility that professors would not like
the new system and would just ignore it. Many specific suggestions were made on ways to implement the proposition so
that professors would be present at their exams. But the
Council was unable to agree on a practical solution. Finally,
Rubin reiterated, "It is not in our power to instate this

Concerns about student wages:
Student Council raised concerns over whether the most
demanding jobs on campus are offering students enough
incentive to work with top scale pay. Co-president Ryan
Budish 'O4 cited the early morning van drivers as an example. "Right now, they can't attract enough student drivers to
run the shuttle until 3 a.m. even with top pay," he said. "It is
very important that the shuttle runs reliably and we feel
that, perhaps, students who drive the shuttles from midnight to 3 a.m. should be paid more. In general, we just want
to make sure that, if we need to raise some wages in order to
fill the most demanding jobs, we should."
In talking with President Al Bloom, council member
Carmen Barron 'O5 noted that a "good set of definitions of
what is top pay scale" seemed to be a prerequisite for pursuing the possibility of raising student wages. When co-president Matt Rubin 'O3 voiced concerns over "how long [the
whole process] will take," Budish suggested that the council
"should figure out what should be top pay and then perhaps
[Bloom] will be more willing to work on it." Members agreed
that, with more information, this issue should be pursued in
the next few meetings.

THE PHOENIX

The council, having decided that a reservation system
would be necessary for the van to run smoothly, debated
about where and how the sign-up process should take place.

Everything from the message boards at Sharpies to electronic reservation systems were discussed; the council finally decided to implement the suggestion by Ed Stehlik 'O5 that
there should be a sign-up sheet near the Rose Garden, where
the van will arrive and leave. When doubts were raised
about whether students might "scratch other people's names
off the list to put theirs on," Rubin responded, "We've got to
put the power in the people."
Proposition of self-scheduled exams:
A proposition was presented to the council which would
allow students to take self-scheduled, proctored final exams.
According to the proposition, students would be able to sign
up for a time slot on a certain day for an exam, receive the
exam from the proctor when they arrive to take it, and take
all their exams at times that are convenient for them.
Tran, who had talked to Provost Connie Hungerford
about self-scheduled exams, reported that Hungerford had

October 10, 2002

continue to work with professors [on this issue]."
Most council members felt that an honor code is not and
should not be a product of trying to implement the proposition. Stehlik felt that the entire idea of an honor code "went
against the Swarthmore tradition." Most council members
agreed that the self-scheduled, proctored exams would minimize cheating as efficiently as the way exams are administered now and decided not to mention the idea of an honor
code in the proposition.
After a few revisions, the proposition passed with 9 votes
in support. Tran, the Educational Policy Representative,
voted against the proposition. Anna Morgan 'O4,
Secretary/Treasurer and former Educational Policy

Representative, abstained from the vote.
After the vote, Tran noted, "[Morgan and I] know what
it's like to work with [the CEP]." Rubin recognized that
"having contact with the CEP might cast doubts on how feasible the proposal is, but the fact that it may face serious
opposition is no reason not to go along with what we believe
is a fair and important initiative."
The council will present the proposition to Hungerford
and continue to pursue the issue from there.

Experts against war on Iraq
Voices in the Wilderness, a group that fights to end the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, stopped at
Swarthmore Monday night as part of a 100 college tour, stopping at Villanova the same day, to speak against a
U.S.-led war on Iraq. The three speakers have all traveled to Iraq and seen firsthand the results of U.S.-led economic sanctions.
The group claims these sanctions have killed more than one million Iraqi civilians, and that Gulf War bombing
let loose the diseases cholera, typhus and E. coli. Sanctions since then, the group claims, have thwarted Iraq's
efforts to fight these diseases. The group's "Mirror of Truth" tour attempted to "bring light" to the world's largest
stockpile of weapons of mass destruction those in the United States itself, according to Voices.
"The idea is to get folks to realize that the 'enemy' is not Afghanistan, or Iraq, or the U.5.," said tour coordinator Rev. G. Simon Harak, S.J. "The enemy is these terror weapons: We all have to unite to oppose them, wherever
they are."

Self-defense workshops teach confidence, empowerment
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
kduongll@Swarthmore.edu
Their most important weapon, Corinne Lagermasini
told the seven women Saturday, is fear.
Lagermasini, who instructs the women's self-defense
workshop held every weekend, addressed a group of seven

female Swatties.

Participants learn ways to avoid physical attacks, as
well as ways to protect themselves in the event of an

attack. The workshop began with the discussion of each
female's survival skills. These skills included being loud,
running or being assertive. "The fact that you have survived [until] today means that you all have [survival]
skills," said Lagermasini to the female Swatties.
Next, Lagermasini talked about fear and a woman's
intuition. After citing cold hands and shivers as examples
of the body's reaction to fear, she discussed the fight-orflight response to fear. She reminded the women that trusting one's own instincts is crucial to survival.
Another factor that could prevent physical attacks,
Lagermasini said, was assertiveness. The women were
asked to analyze the dangers of showing fear, depression
or distraction while walking. Lagermasini then gave the
women tips on walking with confidence. The women also
learned various intimidating stances and pivots that displayed power and stability. Throughout the class,
Lagermasini and Addie Candib 'O5, a WAVE (Women's
Anti-Violence Education) instructor, also noted that

yelling "No!" was important for deterring potential attackers. After Lagermasini demonstrated that the most effective way to yell was to yell from the diaphragm, the students practiced yelling "No!"

The focus of the workshop then shifted to more physical
maneuvers of self-defense. Candib helped Lagermasini
demonstrate how the palm could be used to break an
attacker's nose. Lagermasini even noted that the palms
were so strong that they could push a nose back into the
skull.
The instructors also demonstrated a technique for kicking knees. Candib explained that dislocating the kneecap
only required 20 pounds of pressure, so it can be an effective method of attack. Also, since knee height is approximately the same for all individuals, the knees of a hypothetical attacker are equally vulnerable, no matter the
attacker's size. The students then practiced these moves on
the instructors, who wore protective pads.

"It made me much more confident,
knowing that I had that kind of
power, that kind of self-awareness."
Addie Candib 'O5
During a brief rest from physical maneuvers,
Lagermasini spoke to the women about acquaintance rape,
the most common type of rape. She, Candib and some students then participated in a role-playing activity, in which
they acted out dangerous situations that women in college
typically encounter. The actors modeling as potential victims of attack used assertive and concise statements to

ward off their attackers.
The workshop ended with a brief review of possible

can be used if
the victim is on the ground.
The self-defense workshop held on Saturday, as well as
the classes that are offered each semester, was sponsored
by the campus group AWARE, a group that promotes education for women on anti-violence and self-defense strategies. The campus group also brings speakers on selfdefense and women's issues, and organizes movie nights
and awareness campaigns on campus. Candib, the campus
organizer of the workshops, took one of the classes herself.
"It made me much more confident, knowing that I had that
kind of power, that kind of self-awareness," she said.
The instructors for the workshop were trained by
WAVE, a Philadelphia-based women's group. The group
states that all women, regardless of their size and physical
ability, can learn skills that will help them to avoid and
resist assault. The organization holds classes for both individuals and groups in Philadelphia, as well as several locations in outlying suburbs. WAVE advertises that, while the
full fee for the course is $l2O per individual, no women are
denied enrollment; if women cannot afford the fee, they
simply pay what they can.
Becca Hoover '99, WAVE director, discovered the group
during 1997, when she took a year off from her studies at
ground-attack techniques and motions that

Swarthmore to dedicate herself to her Lang project.
During that year, she took classes at WAVE and later
underwent instructor training. In the fall of 1998, Hoover
began to teach classes at Swat. Since then, she has been
deeply involved in WAVE. Hoover encourages any students interested in small nonprofit organizations to volunteer or intern with the organization. "WAVE offers a different way for women to exist in the world, with less fear
and more confidence," she said.

Worth works to defray additional health costs
From INSURANCE, pg. 3
Last year, doctor's visits within the network were covered 100 percent with a $lO-$2O co-payment, and coverage
outside the network was 70 percent. In more concrete
terms, this means that a $2OO visit to a doctor who
belongs to the network will cost a student on
Swarthmore's plan twice as much as it would have last
year.
This year's plan also offers less coverage for prescription drugs. Last year's plan covered prescription drug
costs up to a modest $6OO with a $5-10 co-pay. This year, if
a student needs prescription drugs, regardless of cost or
urgency, he must pay up front. The student must also
wait to have the receipt which must be a pharmacist's
processed at
receipt as opposed to a cashier's receipt
Worth Health Center and sent to the insurance company
before that company will send them a check for reimbursement. They will be reimbursed for 80 percent of the

cost of the medication.
To put this in concrete terms, a student who fills six
$lOO prescriptions over the course of a year*will pay two
to three times more than he did last year, and he will
have to pay up front. If he needs to fill a seventh prescription, the insurance policy won't cover it at all.
The college committee responsible for negotiating
this year's student medical plan did not set out to raise
premiums or cut benefits. Student medical coverage is
not paid for by the endowment, at least not directly, but
rather by the students and families who pay the $665 premium. Students on financial aid have the cost of their
premium subsidized by the financial aid budget.
"We're simply trying to keep the plan affordable for
families in the face of escalating medical costs. We deal
with the same problems as everyone else in the country,
and we are fortunate that we've been able to hold costs
down as low as we have," Gross said. "It's as simple as
that. We are dealing with tradeoffs between benefits and
cost."
In the end, according to Gross, "The cuts were in
areas less central. We wanted to make sure that the
terms of core coverage were left in tact." Therefore, the
$50,000 coverage per illness remains untouched, as well
as $4OOO of psychiatric coverage, while other coverage

were modified.
Swarthmore's health insurance plan has been renegotiated annually over the past four years, since the college
changed to the current system from a plan offering minimal coverage to all students, which Gross described as
"unnecessary for most and inadequate for others."
Many common prescriptions exceed the $6OO per year
amount covered by the college's policy, a fact that is not
lost on the Linda Echols, director of Worth Health
Center. Echols uses a portion of the health center's budget to buy drugs commonly prescribed to students, usually when she can find them in a cheaper, generic form.
These include medications for allergies and asthma, the
most common antibiotics, and generic forms of the antidepressants Prozac and Wellbutrin. She said the health
center also provides a cheaper means of purchasing birth
control pills, and the 'morning after' pill.
"We try to get cover the things that students need, and
give them to them while they're here so they're not
socked with a huge bill that they can't pay," Echols said.
There are limits on what she can provide, however, and
she advises that students be sure to get "everything they
give you at the pharmacy in the form of a receipt" when
areas

purchasing prescription medications.
Echols also advises students to have their health
insurance card with them when visiting any off-campus
health care provider. "If you have your card on you, and
they're in network, they'll bill the company directly," she
said. "If they aren't, they'll bill you and you'll have to
wait to be reimbursed." She added that "no insurance

company will reimburse you in less than a month."
The health center can also help students deal with difficult situations related to medical care and insurance
coverage. Echols has put some students from low-income
families with high medical costs in touch with "drug
companies who have plans that cover indigent people."
Gross described Swarthmore's coverage this year as
"a better plan at a lower cost than many of our peer institutions," and his claim seems to be substantiated by the
decisions of some Swarthmore students.
When Kasia Koziol-Dube tore the ACL in her other

play sports this year. Today she graces Swarthmore's
athletic fields in a knee brace, waiting to have an
expensive surgical procedure for which her parents
might have had to pay thousands of dollars if it weren't
for Swarthmore's coverage.
For a brief time period after she received this injury,
when her parents changed insurance companies, she
was considered uncovered. This meant that her injury
was designated as pre-existing and was therefore not
covered by her new plan. Despite the similar restrictions outlined in the blue insurance pamphlets on display in Worth Health Center's lobby, Koziol-Dube is
back on the college plan, and she expects her surgery to
be paid for in full after she completes her collegiate ath-

letic career.
As Echols pointed out about Koziol-Dube's insurance coverage, "That policy was written in New Jersey.
Pre-existing illness clauses are illegal in Pennsylvania.
We have ways of getting around all that."

(U-WIRE) PROVO, Utah Brigham Young University
master's student Dave Meilstrup had a tongue-jerking
experience with an ice cream bar at a recent accounting
function in the Wilkinson Student Center.
"I could think about was 'Dumb and Dumber' and
The Christmas Story,'" said the 25-year-old from
Hershey, Penn., whose tongue was frozen to a orange
-

and vanilla dream bar. "I couldn't believe it was actual-

ly happening."
And Meilstrup isn't the only one who has been troubled by the creamsicles.
Over the past three weeks, at least a dozen BYU students received oral injuries while eating super-frozen
orange creamsicles supplied by BYU dining services.
"There were free orange creamsicles at Fall Fling,
and I really like creamsicles so I opened the wrapper
and popped it in my mouth," said Melissa Leininger, 20,
a junior from Ogden, Weber County, studying elementary and early childhood education. "Then it just stuck
to the inside of my upper lip."
Leininger said she gently tried to pull the creamsicle
from her lip, but the frozen treat was firmly stuck.

"I finally pulled really hard and it came off, but it took
a chunk of my lip with it. I bled everywhere, on my fingers, on the Popsicle
everywhere," said Leininger,
who then had to fight the crowds at Fall Fling to clean
her wound in a Wilkinson Center rest room. Lininger
said her injuries didn't heal for three days.
More then eight students had similar encounters at
an engineering function.
"I ripped it off and man it hurt" said Cory Tholl, 22, a
junior from American Fork who is studying mechanical
engineering. "It happened to at least seven or eight others."

The common culprit among those who were injured
seems to be the Blue Bunny Orange Dream Bar, a vanilla-flavored reduced-fat ice cream bar coated with
orange sherbet.
Both Lineinger and Meilstrup said they saw peers
eating creamsicles from the same box they did, with
none of the painful side effects.
"It was almost like creamsicle roulette," Lineinger
said.

trying to
do what every advanced, industrialized nation has done
for years, and that is to provide basic health care for all

He went on to analyze what he described as America's
"health care crisis."
"Forty-two million people without health care who are
overwhelmingly working people and members of working

families" are uninsured in the United States, he said.
Dukakis went on to describe a situation where a weakened economy has led to cuts in state health care, which in
turn leads to situations where uninsured, or inadequately
insured American citizens spend a thousand dollars for
emergency room visits for medical problems that should
have been handled with proper medical care.
Insurance rates are increasing five times more than
inflation, he noted. Turning over medical coverage to the
marketplace was a "disaster," Dukakis said.
"The majority of small businesses' who do insure their
employees are paying for the guys that don't," he added,
citing 20 to 25 percent of businesses as negligent in their
lack of health coverage.
He suggested a possible solution that would entail modeling a national universal health care coverage plan after
the plan currently in effect in the state of Hawaii, where all
employers are required by law to provide coverage to
employees, and the state provides temporary insurance for
the unemployed.
Before opening the podium to questions from the

'Making Noise Visually'
How to succeed in street
theater without really trying.
BY SYDNEY BEVERIDGE
sbeveril@swarthmore.edu

So, you're finally settled into Swat and
ready to try something

new. Maybe you're
looking for a potential career, or perhaps
you've always wanted to walk on stilts.
Whether for entertainment or activism,

street performance might be your calling.
Philadelphia's lively and diverse urban
atmosphere lends itself to a vibrant street

scene. Many city laws targeting public
assemblies and panhandling tend to impede
street performers, but with a little persistence you too can find some fantastic living
art and music.
At the Campus Philly College Festival
two weeks ago, I searched the city for street
performers. I expected to trip over dozens of
bad sidewalk guitarists around the city, but
never found a single one (try the Old City
area). After nearly an hour of wandering
through aisles of promotional booths, I
spotted a 10-foot-tall figure wearing giant
flared magenta pants. I followed him
through the crowd, finally catching up to
his long strides.

Live performance also
allows for engagement
with the audience rather
than just a stagnant
presentation.
Duncan Busser, a prop master at the
Wilma Theater and producer at the recent

Fringe Festival, has been a stilt-walker for
five years. He learned the art in just two
days and uses a custom-made pair of tradiSouth-American-style
tional
stilts.
According to Busser, the practice of stiltwalking crosses many cultures and began
as a method of picking olives from high
trees.
Busser works with Philadelphia's Spiral
Q Puppet Theater, a community-oriented
arts organization working to "unite neighborhoods one parade at a time." Spiral Q
strives to empower voices through puppetry by hosting performances and programs in parades, parks, church basements
and other venues. Busser describes Spiral
Q's work as a "vehicle to teach others how
to speak for themselves"; carrying out this
mission, the group rallied a neighborhood
to stop a South Philadelphia library from

closing. According to Busser, street theater
enables communities to "make noise visually." Live performance also allows for

engagement with the audience rather than

just a stagnant presentation.

Jedd Cohen 'O4 witnessed Spiral Q's

"cultural leadership in impoverished
areas," while working on the Pentridge
Children's Garden Parade this August. The
annual parade celebrates the Southwest
Philadelphia community garden run by the
Wise Women's Center. For the event he

10

area kids construct and carry puppets and assisted with parade and equipment logistics. Art's potential for social
helped

impact attracted him to street theater and
Spiral Q.
The organization collaborates with
many local school and community groups
to expose people to street theater and mobilize a message. Busser commented that people will look at a sign that a man on stilts is
carrying, such as the one he carried at the
2000 Republican National Convention: "I
have no political agenda. I am not a

protestor."
Street theater's potential for political
activism has made it the target of antiassembly policies and antiterrorism measures for decades. Matthew Hart, the
founder of Spiral Q, describes the trend as
the "sludge of anti-assembly policies."
Starting in the 1980s after Mayor Giuliani's
cleanup of New York, Ed Rendell's Quality
of Life Measures hurt public theater by
restricting public assemblies. More stringent panhandling laws and permit requirepublic
ments
also
constrain
art
performances.
Starting with the 2000 Republican
National Convention, according to an article in the Philadelphia City Paper, antiter-

rorism regulations have greatly affected
street theater's ability to organize and
engage with the public. On August L 2000,
during
Republican
the
National
Convention in Philadelphia, city police
raided the Spiral Q warehouse, seized property, detained 75 puppeteers, and charged
many of them with misdemeanor crimes,
which the court ultimately dismissed. A
year later, dozens of the activists sued the
city and as of mid-August will be settling
for $3,000 payouts from the city's insurance

policies.
Hart explains that the new conspiracy
theories and pre-emptive arrests mean that
the city is "losing a vibrant public dialogue
that needs assembly." Fellow Spiral Q stiltwalker Jakey Riotllama characterized
Philadelphia as much less appreciative of
street art than New Orleans and European
cities. Despite Philadelphia's prohibitive
regulations, Hart is enthusiastic about local
street theater. "I think it's pretty hot," he
said. "We have a pretty vibrant scene here."

streets. Beginning at the Paul Robeson House, we will

became the host of the program.
In 1957 the program became "American Bandstand"
on ABC and began its famous career in bringing rock
and roll into homes across America. Are you up for a
field trip? Before the show moved to California in 1964,
it was filmed at the WFIL Studio at 46th and Market
Streets in West Philadelphia (4548 Market Street).
Today, the building is home to the West Philadelphia
Enterprise Center.

Now that you've got a bit of knowledge about
"American Bandstand," it's time to do it. Go and listen
to rock and roll on the radio! Sure, you may have done
this elsewhere, but try it with a bit of Philly flavor.
WOGL Oldies 981 FM plays continuous rock and roll
and is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year. So
when you're feeling blue, crank it up and sing along
with your favorites.

Dick Clark's American Bandstand Grill
Not too long ago, my friend Elizabeth and I visited
this somewhat famed restaurant in the King of Prussia
Mall. I had an inkling that it would be somewhat like
those "other" chain restaurants with such themes as
rock and roll and movies. And, well, I guessed correctly.
We decided to go to the restaurant "early" on a
Sunday morning. Okay, so it was 11 a.m., but that was
when the restaurant opened. I thought it would be a
good idea to go early and beat the Sunday luncheon
crowds (I had called earlier that week to find out what
time theirbrunch hours were, but to no avail. "We don't
serve brunch anymore," explained the kind soul who
spoke to me on the phone). So, with lunch in mind, we
entered the restaurant.
Stepping into the restaurant is, well, just like step-

ping into any theme restaurant. Rock music flows from
speakers outside of the restaurant and inside the
vestibule. Upon entering the restaurant, be prepared for

a rock and roll overload. We're talking various nostalgia
such as sheet music, records (both vinyl and fancy golden ones mounted on a wood base), autographed memorabilia (I think I saw a headdress thatbelonged to one of
the Village People), numerous pictures, posters, postcards, clothing and other knickknacks related to
"American Bandstand."
Of course, what would the grill be without pictures of
Dick Clark pretty much everywhere? We were attended
to fairly quickly, though they were a bit slow to realize
someone had entered right on the dot at 11 It was kind
of odd to be in a restaurant with no other customers.
Seated at a booth, we got a full view of a number of television screens hanging from the ceiling and perpetually
displaying clips from "American Bandstand."
Photographs of random desserts somehow made
their way throughout this little television loop as well.
A quick glance at the menu made me do a double take;
there were lots of grill items and assorted appetizers and
other main dishes. As a vegetarian it seemed like it was
going to be a bit difficult to plan this meal. After scanning the menu for a long time, I finally selected a
spinach salad and corn chips with an an artichoke,
spinach and three-cheese dip. My friend ordered chicken fajitas.
Chatting over a cup of coffee and listening to rock
music in the background, we waited for our meal and

admired the interesting objects on the wall and underneath the plexiglass surface of our table. The spinach
salad was topped with tomatoes, egg, onion and bacon
(which I picked out). The dip was slightly heated when
it arrived, though it quickly congealed. The corn chips
were somewhat crunchy. The fajitas came sizzling on a
platter and looked somewhat appealing. Although confirmed that they weren't true Tex-Mex food, they were
quite good. We passed on dessert.
So, if you're looking for typical American fare, a
grill, and lots of rock and roll memorabilia, this is the
place to go. Dance parties are held throughout the week
and on weekends with a DJ spinnin' the classics. Visit
the website for more information.

Taking more than a few dictations
BY ESTHER BLOOM
eblooml@swarthmore.edu

There's a reason many secretaries prefer to be called
Executive Assistants. The word "secretary" implies subservience, low-cut blouses, high-pitched voices and coffee-making skills. In a modern-day fairy tale, a plucky heroine could
conceivably begin as secretary, slaving away in an office for a
cruel boss and seeking salvation from it.
Instead, in the darkly comic, subversive "Secretary," the
office itself provides the salvation. For the heroine in this fairy
tale, this salvation comes from not just the drudgery, but the

degradation itself.
Maggie Gyllenhall, Jake "Donnie Darko" Gyllenhall's sister
plays Lee,
but destined not to be known that way for long
the plucky heroine, who, in the first scene, leaves a mental
institution. Lee's mother had placed her there after Lee sliced
her arm. I don't know how I slipped, Lee reflects: I'd been doing
it since I was thirteen.
Lee's mother locks all the knives in the house in a cabinet,
but Lee keeps her own supply in a sewing kit under her mattress. When her father loses his job or comes home drunk and
knocks down Lee's mother, Lee takes out her frustration on her
thighs.

Lee desperately needs to leave her house, and E. Edward
a lawyer in private practice, desperately
needs a secretary. From the first moments of their interview,
they seem like a match made in heaven. Gray warns Lee that
Gray (James Spader),

the position calls for dull work. Blissfully, Lee replies, I like dull

work.
It seems to be true. Lee acts thrilled to type, to answer the
phone, to be precise and controlled. But soon she starts making
small mistakes for which Gray takes pleasure in berating her.

Bewildered and shaken, Lee continues to make mistakes and
Gray's agitation builds until, one day, he orders her to lean over
his desk, and he spanks her.
To the film's credit, the spanking comes off on the screen
exactly as creepy as it seems on paper. That Lee should enjoy it
does not seem to make any sense, yet it makes sense to her. She
channels her need for punishment into a dominant/submissive
relationship with her boss and manages to throw her sewing kit

into the river.

But although the need to control is as strong in Gray as the
need to be controlled is in Lee, he is not as comfortable with the
arrangement as she is. When he tries to put an end to their
activities, Lee becomes increasingly desperate. Finally she
forces a confrontation, and he fires her.
Even if, by some judicial miracle, everything up to that point
couldn't be construed as sexual harassment, certainly her termination could have been. But that possibility never occurs to
Lee. She sinks into depression, concerned only with how she
can win Gray back and restore her most fulfilling relationship.
She then exhibits the force of will that has powered her
throughout. This action makes the film's subtext inarguable:

being submissive is a choice requiring incredible resilience and
strength.
"Secretary" doesn't purport to be the Idiot's Guide to S&M.
It doesn't imply that the answer to your psychological problems
is to let your boss tie you to a tree. As a film, it succeeds because
it focuses so intensely on two individuals for whom this inter-

action is the ideal kind.
First-time director and co-writer Steven Shainberg strikes a
balance with "Secretary" so that it never seems either melodramatic or flippant. He treats both his characters with respect;
and the actors, especially Gyllenhall, a newcomer herself,
respond with remarkable performances. The tension between
her and Spader before they give into their desires manages to

BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

"Swarthmore was the most unfunny place I've
ever been," says one alumna. Hmm, that sounds
familiar. As a freshman, I've heard horror stories
about the lack of comedy on campus. I've even
experienced it first hand.
When comedian Dave Russo came for Welcome
Weekend, he was greeted with mixed reviews.
After a several- minute disclaimer and before a
several-minute apology, Russo told what the
majority of Swathmoreans took as a completely
offensive joke. The joke, which mocked homosexuals, permeated Swat -conversations for several
days afterward. The school was divided. Half of
Swatties took the joke to be only moderately offensive, in a sort of "If you can't laugh about it, what's
the point?" attitude. The other half saw the joke as
completely inappropriate, poking fun at something that, in their opinion, should remain
solemn. I had the opportunity to talk to Russo
after the show. "Swarthmore's a tough crowd," he
said. "Everyone told me I couldn't get away with
anything here. I apologize if I offended anyone. I
thought I could get away with that joke."
So, is Swat really too sensitive to take a joke?
Not according to Vertigo-go member Karly Ford.
"We are aware of the tastes of the population
here," Ford said. "We try to be the 'clean group' on
campus." Vertigo-go, a comedy improv group on
campus, stays away from racist or sexist humor,
aware of what Swarthmore students consider
inappropriate. "We even try to stay away from
sexual humor in our 'Pre-Screw' show," says Ford.
Adrian Mackey of Boy Meets Tractor, a sketch
comedy group recently changing from their
improv past, says that sensitivity is "something to
be aware of." According to Mackey, it is more difficult to censor improv performances than the
new sketch comedy skits, as the latter are previously scripted. "We actually used to have a last
minute rehearsal of everything we considered
inappropriate immediately before the first performance," said Mackey. "It helped us to get that
kind of humor out of our system before the first
show."
Despite its staidness, Swarthmore has actually
produced a wide array of comedians. Among them
are Michael Weithorn '7B, creator of Ned and
Stacey and award-winning writer for Cheers and
The Wonder Years; Steven Gilborn '5B who played
Mr. Collins on The Wonder Years and Ellen
DeGeneres' father on Ellen; Beth Littleford '9O,

former Daily Show correspondent on Comedy
Central, a regular on Spin City, and host of E!
Entertainment Television's Talk Soup; and Leah
Gotsik '97, a headliner at Boston's best comedy

club, "The Improv Asylum." Also among comic
alums are Tom Sgouros, a writer and actor of what
he calls "performance art," freelance writer and
political satire guru; and Martha Salzman Gay '79,
president of a retained executive search firm by
day, stand-up comedian by night.
Certainly, with the extensive list of comic
reliefers on campus, there must be some type of
humor at Swat. So, what defines Swarthmore
humor? Karly Ford says that Vertigo-go strives for
"clever, layered humor," absent of bathroom comedy or sensitive subjects. "In the manner of
'Whose Line is it Anyway?' we perform intellectual (but funny!) comedy," says Ford. Adrian
Mackey of "Boy Meets Tractor" says that her
group also strives for academic, intellectual
humor. Mackey argues that some humor is exclusive to Swarthmore: "Nowhere but Swat would
anyone laugh at a joke about a random sixteenth
century philosopher. No one would get it anywhere else."

WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu

In 1994 Beck released the song "Loser." It was about
being a loser (with a subtle, yet passionate, ambitious
streak) and the girls with the "cocaine nose jobs." Then,
Kurt Cobain turned his cocaine nose job into a bullet-brain
nose job and slackerism died along with

him.
That didn't faze Beck though; listen
closely to the coda of "Loser" and discover
the embedded lyric, "I'm a driver, I'm a
winner. Things are gonna change, I can
feel it." Remember, Beck was never really
a slacker like the rest of the alterna-scene;
it was only a joke when he asked, "So why

the studio this time around is by reading the liner notes.
The songwriting strictly focuses on Beck and his acoustic
guitar, along with Nigel Godrich, the production genius
partially responsible for Radiohead's masterpieces and the
producer of "Mutations," manipulating keyboards, strings
and loops in the studio.
Unfortunately, such a radical change, the definition of a
"sea change," takes time to get accustomed
to. On the following tracks, "Paper Tiger"
and "Lonesome Tears," the strings are the
buddies trying to get Beck out of breakup
dumping grounds. But they're only doing
more harm than good, and Beck mumbles his
lyrics about being torn apart, living lies and

don't you kill me?"

Instead, in 1996 he climbed aboard

George Clinton's Mothership with his

penchant for bluesy guitar and left-field
samples, and came back with one of the
most brilliantly composed albums ever,
"Odelay." The next two records seemed
like radical changes, but really they were
just variations on a theme: take as many
genres as possible, put them together and
see what happens. The results were the

world-blues of "Mutations"

and

SEA CHANGE

the

Prince-opera that is "Midnite Vultures."
Now, forget all of that because on
Beck's new album, "Sea Change," he's
really taking the concept of mutation to
heart. His eight-year relationship with the
girl who accompanied him during his
transformation from skinny white guy
with crazy ideas about melody to skinny
white guy who can dance amazingly well
on the stage of "Saturday Night Live"

Beck's new album "Sea
Change" is direct musical

storytelling about girls and

holding onto nothing like he really thinks he
is Mr. Cobain.
Then, another change happens; the album
becomes less of a search for pity and more of
a universal catharsis. Beginning with the
song "Lost Cause" and continuing until the
record's conclusion, "Side of the Road," Beck
and Mr. Godrich craft a marvelous song
cycle.
"Lost Cause" begins with an acoustic guitar circling around a melody and Beck
singing the ultimate self-criticism, "Baby,
I'm lost. Baby, I'm lost. Baby, I'm a lost
cause." The keyboards feel just like spinning
plates and before you know it, the song has
wrapped itself around you and you're clutching on as though it were the world's warmest
blanket. The keyboards and piano are turned
a little higher to take control of the melody
on the next song, "End of the Day," and the
track is all the better for it. It's the first time
Beck has relied so heavily on this type of
instrument, but he uses it as though he's been
doing it for years. Then, a cello accents "It's
All in Your Mind" perfectly. Even better, the
lyrics have moved from annoyingly introverted to a place where it seems like Beck has
accepted his relationship status and is, ever

ended, and then all of a sudden he was the their consequences.

Health insurance
Throughout the country, the health care industry is
failing to keep health care costs down and failing to
meet the needs of many sick and injured Americans.
As a result, as former Presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis '55 outlined in his talk here last week,
the cost of health insurance is beyond the reach of many
in this country.
We may concern ourselves with health care affordability in the abstract. We may endorse the argument
for universal health coverage as an important extension
of a liberal government safety net.
But the state of the health insurance industry also
affects us tangibly, as the changes this year in the health
insurance plan Swarthmore offers students show.
The college requires a minimum level of coverage
for all, and although it may be adequate for the 400 students on the plan, the basic level of coverage gets
skimpier each year. This fall, the premium per student
went up, while the college is paying less for medical
care by replacing a flat-rate co-pay system with a percentage-based reimbursement system, meaning students insured will fork over more for doctor visits and
prescriptions.
This increased burden is a direct result of the state
of the health care industry beyond campus. As national
policymakers continue to ignore the importance of
affordable health insurance, and the cost of health care
continues to rise, we will continue to face harder tradeoffs between affordability and adequate coverage.
Health care companies, when tied by unregulated
market forces to a sagging economy, inevitably drive up
prices, and the cost is passed on to consumers. A new
report by the Hays Group shows insurance costs rose by
about 20 percent last year. Swarthmore tries to negotiate and cut costs as much as possible, but must deal
with the offers available, and so our costs rose, too, and
will likely increase again next year.
We commend the college for doing its best to keep
costs down. But even though the administration and
Worth Health Center staff work hard to keep health care
here adequate, we aren't exempted from the economic
downturn and its effect on the health insurance and

pharmaceutical industries.

And that's where health care at Swarthmore speaks
a greater problem. At one of the wealthiest
liberal arts colleges in the world's wealthiest nation,
more and more pays for less and less.
While citizens everywhere grumble over increasing
hits from their pockets, a former Presidential candidate
and one of the nation's most effective governors was
forced to return to his alma matter to find an eager audience for his speech on our health care system's illnesses. Despite many Americans' misgivings over its country's health care system, there remains no unified
movement to effectively resolve the issue.
Uninsured Americans are unable to afford preventative health care, often ending up in the emergency
ward, where hospitals are forced to pay for expensive
operations that come out of the pockets of the insured.
Regardless of whether we agree with Dukakis' universal health care plan, his key point remains: health
care reform should be at the top of the nation's agenda.
If students are frustrated by skyrocketing premiums
and shrinking coverage, the responsibility to solve
these problems lies not with those who negotiate our
plan, but President Bush and our Congressional repredirectly to

Speak out against the World Bank
Dear Editor:
In one of last week's opinion articles, David Haendler
expressed his concerns over voicing opposition to the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund for fear of being
grouped with "pesky protestors" seen at demonstrations
such as the recent one in Washington, D.C. Though I agree
with Haendler on some points, I find it necessary, as a proud
protestor, to clarify and expand on some ofhis points.
First, what I don't understand is how anyone could hold
such strong opinions but not voice them not out of fear, but
out of being uncomfortable with those expressing the same
thing. Deciding not to show your support for something out
of fear for the label associated with it will only strengthen
your opponent. The worst thing you can do is be silent.
Secondly, "philosophically" speaking, people oppose the
IMF and World Bank for many reasons, not simply because
they seek an end to capitalism. Many others feel that the
institutions' practices need changing, but that they can be
reformed from within. Still other activists believe that the
current institutions must be abolished, but that a responsible form of capitalism can be established in their place.
-

I'd also like to comment on the smorgasbord of activist

groups often seen at anti-globalization protests, each with
unrelated agendas, often ranging from the Free Mumia
movement, to those seeking an end to the occupation of
Palestine, to more mainstream groups such as Amnesty
International. In perhaps the only point of Haendler's that I
would agree with, I must say that such a presence can be
quite overwhelming and at times frustrating when trying to
present a unified front of resistance.
On the other, more optimistic, hand, part of what has

October 10, 2002

given the anti-globalization movement such power and
momentum has been this coalition of multiple awarenesses,
such as the infamous "Turtles and Teamsters" presence at
the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle. For the most part, each
group acknowledges the legitimacy of their complementary
movements in order to show the broad base of support for
necessary reforms. Further, they are unified, as each represents a different example of injustice and their presence
demonstrates a unification of influence, not only towards
reforming the global economy, but towards creating a world
based on the basic ideals of peace, love and justice.
Finally, I'd like to clarify Haendler's question, "what
exactly do these 'Ruckus Society' clowns think they're
accomplishing when they smash a coffee shop's window?"
First, the Ruckus Society, a nonprofit organization, while
training people for nonviolent direct action, often civilly disobedient, is fundamentally opposed to the permanent damage of property or the use of harm against other people.
Second, the very purpose of a mass protest is not to create a
net loss of profit for a specific company, but rather to draw
attention to the problem, so that solutions can be discussed.
Violence and destruction, though drawing such attention,
ultimately undermine the values that protestors hope to
affirm and cast a negative shadow on the real issues.
Perhaps as more people begin to understand the ways
that each and every one of us either contributes to or is
affected by our current system, they will respond withplacards, puppets, cheers and chants, adding their voices to the
harmony of the protest chorus. Perhaps, someday, united in
our vision, we'll demonstrate that another world is possible.

Middle East blame game helps no one
Dear Editor:
I would like to respond to Jews
Against the Occupation (JATO) in

their letter to the editor in last
week's Phoenix. Though I approve
of their stance of being against the
occupation, their statements need a
bit more thought. For instance,
"Ariel Sharon is the architect of the
1982 massacres in the Sabra and
Shatilla refugee camps in Lebanon
and an internationally recognized
war. criminal," is in fact a false
statement, if not very misleading.
Although I have no deep love for the
man and I believe he should not
hold office, Sharon was not tried for
his role in the massacres, and certainly has not been convicted.
Perhaps JATO should focus on what

matters, which is that Sharon's
vision for the region is itself not
viable and is harmful to both sides.
Attacking the man himself does little, especially when the charges are

inaccurate.
I generally agree with JATO's
suggestions that Barak did not
truly offer as much as he should
have, but it was Arafat who walked
away and decided not to offer alternate solutions. This is not something for which the blame can be
easily assigned, nor should blame
be assigned at all in the interest of

neither are being reasonable. I
would ask JATO not to support one

that JATO speaks of is unprovoked

A pterodactyl
hunter's tale
This past Friday night I had

one of the most enjoyable experiences of my semester. I wasn't
drunk. I wasn't stoned. I was
intoxicated by something far
more potent: the thrill of ptero-

dactyl hunting.
For days prior to the hunt, my
friends and I joked about the
nature of this event. How could
we be expected to take seriously a
contest whose goal was to hit a
Swillie dressed as a pterodactyl
with a foam-rubber sword? I
would soon discover that sophomoric attitude was terribly mis-

was in over my head. Six garbage-

■■■■■■mmmimbbhmmb

bag-clad rugby players with foam
swords in hand huddled around a caped figure, listening

intently as he recited the rules of the hunt. We soon discovered
that the much-anticipated pterodactyl was not a target for the
neophyte Swattie. Rather, the right to even attempt to engage
in battle with this majestic creature was reserved solely for
those parties with the propensity to earn enough gold to pur-

chase the pterodactyl-hunting license, requiring my teammates and I to battle deadly ores and other creatures.
Thus, we set out on our mission. Gazing out onto the battlefield, one could only discern indistinct creatures lurking in the
shadows, enticing their prey. Before I could fully take in this
spectacle, I was charged by an angry monster who quickly took
advantage of my bewilderment and drove his dagger into my
chest. I bowed my head, handed him my sword, and shamefully returned to weapons central.
With a bit of experience under my belt, I retrieved a new
weapon and set out with one of my teammates. Cooperation,
we realized, was the key to this game. Working in tandem, we

quickly satisfied our lust for blood and gold, slowly but surely

earning the 75 necessary gold pieces to purchase the pterodactyl-hunting license.

We quickly found the beast frolicking among the trees near
the train station. Huddled just out of earshot, we quickly for-

mulated a plan and began the attack. Adrenaline pumping,

hearts pounding, my five teammates rushed the pterodactyl
with a ferocious roar and engaged his loyal guards. The fighting became fierce as the creature attempted to spray my companions with his deadly venom; I headed for the flank and
stealthily approached from behind. I quickly knocked both of
his wings out with short thrusts of my sword. It was then that
he noticed my presence and began to turn around. Before he
could discharge his lethal fluid upon me, I reached over his
shoulder and plunged my weapon into his heart. The pterodactyl had fallen. My team was victorious.
To those who would turn their noses up at this event, citing
it as geeky or childish, I suggest they lose their uninformed attitudes. SWIL was able to entice over 100 Swatties to forget their
pride and indulge in a whimsical and quirky event. Appealing
to such a large group is a true accomplishment for any campus
group.
Such a large event undoubtedly required many weeks of
planning and preparation. On behalf of my teammates and
myself, I thank you. Rest assured that your hard work has not

gone unappreciated.

Learn econ before bashing it
Dear Editor:
I was disappointed to read Lillian Ray's pronouncement
that she has never taken any economics because she believes
that "the concept of the free market is inherently flawed, since
it doesn't recognize. the influence of power dynamics on the
market." Perhaps if Ray had taken some economics, she would
have realized that there is more to economics than the perfect

competition model. She might also have realized that economists wield a variety of powerful mathematical and conceptual tools that could be used to model the effects of "power
dynamics."
Instead, Ray chooses to dismiss an entire discipline of
which she is, by her own admission, ignorant. How sad.

Sobering Thoughts

one of our "scientific" calculations, we came to the conclusion that the average Swattie
spends about 22 hours a week

in Sharpies. Just last night,
while we were sitting in Sharpies, we realized that our dining
hole is an anthropologist's dream. Do you remember how you
came to Swat to get away from high school? Apparently you
were coming to the most liberal, diverse and understanding
campus in this country. Students unaware of petty social divi-

sions were to share in the Hegelian synthesis of ideas that was
Swarthmore. This was to be your academic heaven for the next
four years, until you were cast back into the real world. Most of
the time we would buy into this image; however, after filling up
our drinks in the cafeteria, we all take places that could have
come straight out of "Varsity Blues" or any other crappy teen

movie about fake high schools with really really really hot girls.
After a year at Swat, we can almost accurately label every table
with its respective social group.
First of all, there is the conflict between the large room and
the two small rooms. We used to sit in the back room. It was

quaint, homey, and, before we started showering, was better for

the greater good of Swarthmore. Then we realized how cool we
were. We, along with all of our friends, decided we were too
good for the small room. On one occasion at the beginning of the
year, when everyone thought it was cool to go to dinner at the
exact same time, we couldn't find a seat in the large room.
Rather than sitting in the small room, we just left and didn't eat,
for fear of being ostracized by our big-room friends. Okay, so
that's a lie. Your mom is hot. We would never miss a meal. But
at the same time, I can't remember the last time I ate in the
small room. At the same time, I don't think some Swillies could
tell you the last time they ate in the large room.
We would love to examine the table breakdown of social
groups in the small room, but we can't; we don't eat with those
nerds. We have spent the last few weeks in the field researching
social interaction in the large room. Members of fraternituses

them to sit close to the soda machine. The Frisbee team seems

to make a concerted effort to sit on the round table in the back

Misha Horowitz picked up the table for a hammerthrow across
Sharpies just out of instinct. The Rugby team likes to sit in the
middle. We like attention. We also like to throw food, making i
a strategic strong point as it maximizes our range.
But seriously folks, while not everyone sits in the exac
same place all the time according to their social status at Swat
there are definitely some trends. Athletes sit together. Vintage
clothes-wearing people sit together. Hippies sit together. Fra
boys sit together. ML people sit together. And unfortunately
like most high schools, Sharpies is often divided by racial line
as well. We aren't saying you shouldn't be allowed to sit wit
your friends. After all your friends often tend to be in you
social group, so I guess our article was sort of worthless, like
tofu. However, one has to wonder whether diversity requires
simply a diverse population, or also diverse interaction. Swat
seems to be sort of good at the first, but sometimes we question
if the second is as true. Obviously we are better off than some
schools, but there is always room for improvement. Sometimes
people might feel uncomfortable sitting in certain parts of the
cafeteria, i.e. a Swillie at the DU table, and this isn't diversity.
So next time you walk into Sharpies, take a second to think
about where you sit as more than just where you eat lunch. Try
sitting in a different room, or at least a different table. Or just
go to Tarble. Shout outs to the Kohlberg coffee ladies for keeping us up in the mornings. Represent. Peace.

tial statement that Israel

CARLA HUMUD

Conspiracy Theory

is nothing more than an
offshore American military base. That remark
provoked laughter in the
audience, yet such a
relationship is hardly

unprecedented.
The
United States has maintained many client
states in the past, and Israel is by no means the only one
that remains today. Egypt and Pakistan, for example,
have effectively surrendered control of their foreign policy to the United States. Those leaders have learned, as
have many others before them, that in doing so they gain
the power to rule with impunity within their own countries. Yet there are noticeable differences between the
United States' relationship with countries like Egypt and
Pakistan and its relationship with Israel.
Egypt and Pakistan are kept in check by the knowledge that the United States could turn on them at any

moment, as it has turned against many ofits authoritarian friends in the past, from Nicaragua to the
Philippines. In Nicaragua, the United States supported
the brutal Somoza dictatorship until a member of the
Nicaraguan National Guard was caught on film as he
shot an American reporter. Immediately, the United
States withdrew all support for his regime; an Israeli
ship that was en route to Nicaragua with a shipment of
arms was ordered to turn back. Israel has no such fears.
In 1967 Israel deliberately bombed a practically unarmed

receiving rebuke. Instead, the American government
worked with the Israeli government to cover up the incident. This tight relationship continues today. Aside from
the United States, Israel may be the only country in the
world able to act with true impunity.
What is unusual about Israel is that it is the only
country whose citizens do not appear to resent living
under foreign domination. This is because they have figured out how to make the system work to their own
advantage. For example, log onto the IRS Web site. The
Web site states that contributions made to foreign organizations are not tax-deductible, with the exception of
selected organizations in Canada (on our northern border) Mexico (on our southern border) and Israel (on our,
uh, eastern border). It goes on to explain that exceptions
are made with the understanding that (with those two
countries being on our border and all) Americans might
have sources of income in either of those places. In fact,
having an income source in the country is required if
you want to deduct your contribution. Then there is a
tiny paragraph about Israel. Not only is a source of
income in Israel not required to make a tax-deductible
contribution, but the process of determining qualified
organizations is left to the discretion of the Israeli government. The eligibility of Mexican organizations, by
contrast, is determined by the American government.
This means that contributions to the Israeli army are tax
deductible. The money is funneled directly to the army
Fund for
through an organization called LIBI
Strengthening Israel's Defense. The LIBI website assures
donors that, among other things, they are "making up for
what the defense budget can't cover." Our government
gives Israel $3 billion in unmonitored aid each year;
apparently even that is not enough to cover the defense
budget of a country that has been found to be in wide violation of human rights by our own State Department as
well as by every major international human rights group
in the world. As Americans we need to rethink our commitment to Israel, because there is no need for our country to suffer the consequences of their repression.

Dickinson puts brakes on Garnet winning streak
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swartbmore.edu

Swarthmore was handed its first loss in
Centennial Conference play this season on
Saturday, falling to conference foe
Dickinson in a 1-0 double-overtime thriller.

The loss also ended a three-game winning
streak for the Garnet, during which they
allowed no goals.
"We were definitely the stronger
team," Joanna Hess 'O5 said. "We dominated the game."
Although

Swarthmore

outplayed

Dickinson throughout the game, their opponent's experience in overtime situations

proved to be the difference. "Dickinson has
had a lot of experience lately with sevenversus-seven overtimes, and it showed,"
head coach Kelly Wilcox '97 said.
Through the first two halves and the first
overtime, the Tide frustrated the Red
Devils' potent offense, and goalkeeper Kate

I

Nelson-Lee 'O3 and the Tide's defense
extended their scoreless streak to 305 minutes. Defender Katherine Murnen 'O4 attributed the defense's success to hard work and
communication. "We were channeling the
other team, forcing them to their weak side,
making them go towards their left," Murnen
said. Although the team was proud of its
effort, they were frustrated by the outcome.
"It was a hard game. It was long, and it was
frustrating because it definitely felt like we
were the stronger team," Murnen said.
The double-overtime loss puts the Tide
(2-1 Centennial Conference) in a three-way
tie for second place in the Centennial
Conference. Only defending champion and
perennial powerhouse Johns Hopkins (2-0

CC) remains undefeated in the highly competitive conference. "That's one of the great
things about our conference. For the most
part, all of the teams are very good. It makes
the competition very fun," Murnen said.
With that said, the team is vying for one

of the conference's four playoff spots."We
have an extremely strong team this year. It
would be excellent to make it to the
Centennial Conference Championships this
year," Hess said.
"This is a strong conference and we are a
strong team," Wilcox added. "I don't think
anything is going to be decided until the last
game is played in the regular season. Pretty
exciting if you ask me."
With the conference playoffs within the
Tide's sights, each upcoming conference
game has taken on increasing importance
for the players. "We have high ambitions
for the next few games, and we are very
excited about playing Gettysburg this
Saturday," Hess said. "People should come
to the game. We have an alumni game afterward, so it should be an exciting crowd."
And with conference competition looming, the Tide won't be resting over break.
Wilcox plans on using those days to get

the team mentally prepared for their playoff push. "In practice we have been focusing on playing with a purpose and taking
our game to the next level," Wilcox said.
"We will get much further in the end if we
continue to let goals pull us, rather than
pressure drive us."
"We have a big game against
Gettysburg on Saturday, and we're going
to be here Sunday, Monday and Tuesday,"
Murnen said. "After that we have off until
Saturday evening."

Sports and honors: Where athletics and academics intersect
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
rburstel@swarthmore.edu
You know the type. That kid who can do

everything. Straight A's, star of the school
play, class president, newspaper editor, varsity letters in three sports and generally
well-liked to boot. Maybe you even were
that kid
in high school. Then you got to
college and sacrificed the paper for the sake
of passing physics, cut out acting so that
you could spend more time in McCabe, and
bid adieu to athletics because you couldn't
possibly pursue an honors major and run a
six-minute mile at the same time. And then
you looked around and realized that
Swarthmore was full of people who do it all.
People who excelled in sports and in academics. People who were crazy.
"Why?" you asked yourself when the kid
next to you in seminar brought his shin
pads with his Shakespeare so as to be ready
for the game following class. Where do people like that find the time to excel both on
and off the field and what could possibly the
motivation to do so?
It's simple, said Abram Falk 'O3, an honors physics major and member of the crosscountry team. "I chose honors because I

wanted to receive everything Swarthmore
had to offer me."
But how do student-athletes balance the
demands of an honors curriculum with the

sizeable commitment sports require?
For many athletes who are honors
majors, there is no real conflict. As Sarah
Hilding 'O4, an honors American literature
and history special major and a field hockey
player, explains, participation in intercollegiate athletics actually compliments academic work. "Both provide opportunities to
challenge yourself and your classmates and
18

the skills you develop in each carry over,"

Hilding said. "After four hours of sitting and
thinking and discussing in seminar it feels
wonderful to be on the field running and
playing and putting everything academic
out of my head for two hours."
Mike Loeb 'O3, an honors physics major

who runs cross country, agrees. "I've been
much less stressed since taking up a varsity
sport," Loeb said. "Even though running
takes up time in my day, the four hours of
work I do followingpractice might take only
two hours since my focus is much better."
Nonetheless, scheduled time itself can be
less accommodating. Ongoing complaints
from Swarthmore students, coaches and the
faculty culminated in the adoption of a new
policy regarding the prioritization of academics and athletics at the college last year.
Summing up both her personal coaching

philosophy and the spirit of the approved
document, women's soccer coach Amy
Brunner said, "Anything academic that
interferes with practice time is prioritized,
whether it be a lab, class or seminar."

Swarthmore's

"Guidelines

on

Scheduling Conflicts Between Academics
and Athletics" were developed in a joint
effort by the Athletic Review Committee
and the Curriculum Committee, and are "a
formalization of unspoken policy," according to Amy Bug, chair of the physics department. Clearly stating that "Regular class
attendance is expected of all students," the
introduction to the guidelines differentiates
"between athletic practices and competitive
contests," prioritizing academics over the
former and giving the latter preference over
class time when coupled with consultation
with professors.
Characterizing the policy as "the first
time anything has been put down on paper

October

with regard to resolving and reconciling
conflicts with respect to athletic scheduling
at Swat," Associate Athletics Director
Adam Hertz explained the strength of the

procedure as the implementation of a
"process [that] calls for coaches, student athletes and faculty to each take a role in con-

flict management and resolution."

Women's field hockey coach Kelly
Wilcox '97 agrees. "I think the new policy
was a welcome addition. It demonstrates a
commitment on the part of the administration to athletics and its merits," she said. "It
helps those student-athletes who feel overwhelmed or intimidated."
But others see this larger role for the student athlete as a dependence on student

intermediaries and a liability to the effectiveness of the guidelines. "One flaw seems
to be that the student is forced to be the 'gobetween' between coach and prof," Bug
noted. "Why not have a three-way conversation? Why not have all athletes routinely
give the profs their game and practice
schedule, [and] the coaches their class, lab

[and] seminar schedules?"
This is a procedure that many coaches
report they already voluntarily follow. "I
encourage my athletes to take the classes
they need and are interested in, and then we
work around it," Wilcox said.
What about the honors student-athletes,
themselves? Is the system working for them?
Sarah Frohardt-Lane 'O3, an honors history major who joined the cross-country
team as a senior says it is. "I'm impressed
with the flexibility I've seen. Coaches seem
to make every effort to work around a stu-

dent's schedule," she said.

Falk agreed, saying, "There is rarely an
insurmountable conflict between academics
and athletics, at least as long as neither you

2002

nor your coach has a blue-collar attitude
about timing.

If your afternoon seminar is

late, you show up a little late to
practice. If you have an evening seminar,
sometimes you have to skip dinner, but no
running

big deal."
"No big deal," but the situation requires
some adjustments, according to Eric Shang
'O4, an honors economics major and a member of the swimming team. "It most certainly doesn't help that I essentially, because of
practice, spend 3:45 to 7:30 p.m. doing swimming-related stuff," Shang said. "However,
so far it's been rather unpleasant, albeit
doable, to deal with my classes. There are
other athletes in [my] class and they haven't
requested special treatment. I feel that if
they can swing it, so can I."
The idea that academics ultimately are
the burden of the student despite support

from the athletics

department is

a senti-

ment echoed by Peter Carroll, coach of the
men's and women's cross country and track
teams. "I let the students handle their work
load. I don't give advice on what to and not
to take," he said. "I am proud of the fact
[that] our kids are diversified in their
majors so that they are not just flooding two

or three subject areas."
The breadth that Carroll describes is certainly one exhibited by student-athletes at
Swat. We non-athletes can only stare wideeyed at the feats of those who just do every-

thing and do everything well. But honors

majors who also play sports are quick to
point out that participating in athletics
actually permits better performance in the
academic realm. As Frohardt-Lane said,
"Being on the team has helped me academically. I am impressed by my team members.
They are some of the hardest-working, most
dedicated Swatties I know."

Earthworms take third
place at Rutgers tourney

Last Friday and Saturday, the Swarthmore
ultimate Frisbee team took third place at
Rutgers' invitational tournament with a record
of 4-2.
The Earthworms' only losses came at the
hands of Rutgers and Wesleyan, who finished
second and first respectively.
On Friday, Swarthmore came out of the
gates strong, beating the University of
Delaware 13-6 behind tenacious defense from
Frisbee veteran Paul Wulfsberg 'O3. The
Earthworms followed up that victory with a 134 thrashing of Drew University.
After piecing together those two wins,
Swarthmore dropped its third match of the day
to Rutgers, 13-8. The game was close at halftime, but Rutgers managed to pull away late
behind its venerable zone defense. The match
was not without its highlights for the
Earthworms, however, as Brandt Rakowski 'O6
broke through nicely on his thumbers.
The Earthworms battled back on Saturday
with consecutive victories over Princeton and
Johns Hopkins before losing to Wesleyan in the
tournament semifinals. The win over Princeton,
the top seed in its pool, was an upset for the
Earthworms, who rallied behind excellent play
from their freshmen and broke Princeton's zone
defense.

Women's soccer turns
back Washington 2-1
BY DEBBIE FARRELLY
dfarrell@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore women's soccer continued in its quest
for a winning record this week with conference games
against Muhlenberg and Washington.
Last Saturday, the Garnet Tide took on two-time
defending
Centennial
Conference Champions
Muhlenberg at home. The game looked promising at the
start when Swat took early control of the ball. However,
Muhlenberg soon dominated the offensive game, and
the Mules' Becky Armstrong scored the first goal of the
game 26 minutes into the first half. "There were definitely some openings for [us]. As the game wore on, we
couldn't quite take advantage of those openings," head
coach Amy Brunner said. "Touch was just off the mark
and we weren't getting to balls on the ground or in the
air. We became disjointed."
Swarthmore came out for the second half with
renewed intensity and gained some momentum, eventually resulting in a Katey McCaffrey 'O3 goal 18 minutes into the contest. "The combinations were starting
to get there and we had a nice sustained attack for a few
minutes," Brunner said. The goal, which was unassisted, tied the game at one. Muhlenberg answered only
two minutes later with a hard shot off a rebound from
Courtney Levine that slipped through the defense, putting the Mules ahead for good. "It was a quick goal and
I think it just took us out of the game emotionally,"

McCaffrey said.
Saturday brought on the challenge of Washington
College, a team riding through a .500 season and relatively well-matched with Swat. "The past two weeks
have been an emotional roller-coaster ride for the
Garnet. We played well in tremendous spurts, a la
Gettysburg, but also fell apart in others, a la
Muhlenberg," Brunner said. "The players have been
stressed and were allowing this to seep into their play
and affect the flow of the game. We hoped to remove this
stress against Washington."
The stress was not removed immediatelyWashington had a 2-0 lead 30 minutes into the first
half. However, lineup switches and combination
changes revived the Swarthmore offense. "We started

The only real long-term career goal I ever had was to play
collegiate sports. Granted, my dream used to include
"Princeton," "All-American," and some sort of fancy championship ring, but after a two-year recruiting endeavor at
the end of high school, I'm quite happy where I am:
"Swarthmore," "Centennial Conference Weekly Honor Roll,"
and a bunch of spiffy Seven Sisters T-shirts. For me, the college choice came down not to which school was best for me

Swarthmore, as a member of
the NCAA's Division 111, fit
the bill.
Div. Ill's fundamental philosophy puts the student-athlete first. There are no minimum spectator attendance

tantly, no athletic scholarships. In fact, the Div. 11l philosophy specifically states
that member institutions "Award no athletically related
financial aid to any student," according to the Centennial

Conference's Web site.
Which is why it's shocking that in last week's Phoenix
article about slotting, Bob Williams was quoted as saying,
"We need to remain competitive. Who's to say down the road
that we won't be awarding aid for athletic merit?"

Is he crazy?
Not only is it against the founding philosophy of both the
Centennial Conference (of which Swarthmore is a charter
member) and Div. 111, but it's also against current NCAA regu-

winning balls out of the air, we stepped up and tackled
through the midfield and began sending dangerous
balls into the wings and exploiting the space,"
Brunner said. The swing in aggression resulted in a
goal from Tanya Hahnel 'O5, her third of the season,
which brought the score back to 2-1 with ten minutes
remaining in the half.
The Garnet began the second half with a lineup of
"the 11 who wanted to play hard," according to
Brunner. This combination pressured the Shorewomen
and kept the momentum with the Garnet Tide. The
intensity finally paid off with 20 minutes remaining in
the half when Ele Forbes 'O5 found Val Maulbeck 'O6 in
position behind the keeper. Maulbeck placed the ball in
the far corner in her first collegiate goal, tying the game
at two.
"Once Tanya scored that first goal, we gained an
intensity that lasted right into the second half,"
Maulbeck said. "It was amazing to score my first goal; I
was in shock."
The teams battled scorelessly for the last 10 minutes
of regulation, sending the game into overtime. Swat's
second half energy continued as they dominated the
flow of play. With two minutes remaining in the overtime period, Forbes carried the ball down the right
hand side and deftly crossed it to a sprinting McCaffrey,
who fired what looked like the game-winner at the
Washington goal. But the keeper was able to knock the

lations. And considering the continuing negative stereotyping
of athletes on this campus, I can barely bring myself to imagine what sort of uproar athletic scholarships would caiuse.
Granted, a growing disparity among Div. 11l member
institutions has fueled dissent on the subject. How can
Swarthmore hope to compete with schools like the College of
New Jersey? And with a four-year moratorium on new Div.
11l members ending in the near future, a flood of CNJ-type
schools could force schools like Swarthmore and its fellow
small liberal-arts institutions to peel off and form a new
NCAA division that remains true to the Div. 11l roots.
The reason why I chose a Div. 11l athletic program is the
emphasis on the experience of the student-athlete. The message I got from my Swarthmore coaches was (and still is)
"You're a student first, and an athlete second."
And when it comes down to it, even though I'm a "slotted
athlete," the reason why I, and all my fellow student-athletes, slotted or not, got into Swarthmore was because of our
record as a "student."
This summer, I spent a weekend at a showcase for talented senior field hockey players as a representative of the
Swarthmore program. The showcase was designed to expose
the participants to college coaches. In the informational
packets provided to coaches, each girl's SAT scores, GPAs,
and athletic honors were listed. And at the bottom of each
profile, each girl said what division she wanted to play in.
"Division III" was a rare answer. And once I gave the brief
Swarthmore spiel of "Div. 111, 1450 median SAT, small suburban campus," most girls' eyes drifted over to the long line
forming the next table over where the Division I coach was
aloofly chatting about partial scholarships.
It's hard to sell Swarthmore to a rising college senior who

another. All 21 healthy players made a tremendous
impact today at some point during the contest. This
bodes well as we head into Wednesday's home match
versus Ursinus," Brunner said.
Women's soccer is now 7-6 heading into the final
stretch of the season. They look to better their record in
the coming week with games against Johns Hopkins,
Bay Path College, and Mount Holyoke College.

has visions of championship rings.
But of the 100 or so players I talked to that weekend, two
have visited campus so far this season. And they were both
really enthusiastic about playing at Swarthmore. They have
chosen the same route I did four years ago.
Half the battle is won; they want to be part of the Garnet
field hockey tradition. But will they get in? Even if they are
slotted, whether they get "the fat one" depends solely on the
whims of the Admissions Office. Because even if a Swat
coach makes the decision to use one of the program's coveted and contested slots, it still doesn't guarantee an acceptance letter.
And athletic scholarships won't and shouldn't change
that.

said. McCaffrey then took the corner ball and drove it

Graham's hat trick powers Tide to 5-0 win over LBC
BY JIM DALTON

jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
All good things must come to an end. And everyone
sure wishes all bad things would come to an end as well.
The men's soccer team had its prayers answered on
Tuesday when it destroyed the Chargers of Lancaster
Bible College 5-0 to snap its five game losing streak.

Nicholas Graham 'O6 was on fire for the Garnet Tide as
he notched three goals and one assist to lead the team to
victory. It was the first time a men's soccer player recorded a hat trick for Swarthmore since 1995. Graham scored
the first two goals of the match, breaking a scoreless tie
with a goal off of a pass from Alex Elkins 'O6 33 minutes
into the game. Fourteen minutes later, Graham, assisted
by Scott Long 'O6, extended the Garnet lead to 2-0.
"I felt good. I felt rested," Graham said about his
demeanor before the game. "For the first goal, I took a
pass, beat a man, and side-footed it in from the corner.
The second one I scored off a throw-in."
Graham also contributed to an Anteneh Tesfaye 'O3
score late in the second half, and he capped off his hat
trick with 11 minutes remaining in the blowout victory.
But Graham thinks he could have added yet another
score to the mix. "I was pissed when Coach took me out
early because I think I could have gotten a fourth goal,"
he said.
According to Graham's teammates, he was virtually
unstoppable. "Nick was a beast out there," goalkeeper
Reuben Heyman-Kantor 'O6 said.
The five-goal attack matched the squad's most prolific
offensive outing since October 12,1994, when it edged the
Franklin and Marshall Diplomats 5-4. Swarthmore went
11-8 that year with a 4-5 record in the Centennial

Conference.
The Garnet Tide were also dominant on the defensive
side of the ball, holding Lancaster Bible to a mere five
shots. Keepers Reuben Heyman-Kantor 'O6 and Nate Shupe
'O5 split time in goal for the Garnet Tide and recorded one

and two saves, respectively.
"We had them pretty locked down in the back,"
Heyman-Kantor said. "Paul [Thibodeau 'o6] and Tut [John
Tuthill 'o6] did a good job of keeping things organized. I
think there was only one thing that could have been counted as a shot in my half."
The lopsided victory came on the heels of a five-game
losing streak which had the Tide reeling. "It's frustrating," Graham said. "I think we should really be 11-2 now.
We should have beaten Ursinus, McDaniel, Neumann,
and some others."
"You're always going to be frustrated when the wins
aren't coming, especially when you know you're a better
team than what you're showing," junior captain Brendan
R. Moriarty 'O4 said. "It's a day-by-day thing, though. If you
brood over the past, you're just going to make it harder on
yourself. You have to go out and perform your best each

day, regardless of what has happened or what is going to
happen. You have to play in the now."
The losing streak was also trying for head coach Eric
Wagner, according to players. "Coach was pretty upset,"
Heyman-Kantor said. "He has felt at times that we haven't
had the fight that he would have liked. He wants us to have
tenacity, challenge the goalkeeper, and score."
The fifth and final loss of the skid came last Saturday,
when the Garnet dropped a 3-1 match to Dickinson.
The Tide fell behind early in the match, as Dickinson's
Dave Wiatrowski scored an unassisted goal to give the Red
Devils a 1-0 advantage. After the defensive lapse, the
Garnet managed to regroup and keep the Red Devils at bay
for the remainder of the half. But in the 62nd minute, Red

Moriarty, who had been playing with a broken arm all
season, commented on his setup: "I've had my hand in a

like I used to. This was the first game I could use my hand
again. I wanted to get the ball into the six-yard box with as
