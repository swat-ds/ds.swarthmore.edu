BY CHRISTINA TEMES

In a short while, students will find a significantly different Ville at the other end of
the SEPTA tunnel.
Members of the Borough Council and
Swarthmore Town Center Inc. hosted a
town hall meeting on Oct. 19 to unveil plans
for a new streetscape design in the downtown area, as well as plans for construction
of a new street between Dartmouth and
Myers Avenues and of a new, expanded coop.
The project will end north of PNC Bank
and will affect Chester Road to Michael's
Pharmacy, Park Avenue to D. Patrick
Welsh, and Dartmouth Avenue next to the
Borough Hall, according to Borough
Manager Jane Billings.
The main features of the streetscape
will be new sidewalks with "plain sidewalk curbs and brick edging," and new,
"very wide, very clearly delineated"
crosswalks made of stamped asphalt,
which will look like brick, Billings said.
Other additions will include more pedestrian-scale lighting, new double-headed,
digital parking meters, a bike rack and
trees.
There will also be some changes in
parking. The most significant change will
be that "the angle parking that now exists
across the street from Renato's ...will
be eliminated and replaced with parallel
parking," Billing said. Overall, six parking spaces will be lost due to the changes.
A committee will also meet to redistribute
parking spaces on Myers Avenue, near
the train station, with priority given first
to the business district and SEPTA and
then to Swarthmore students, Billings

DC++ offers easy file sharing
BY PAUL

GOLDSMITH-PINKHAM

pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's internal network is
abuzz with activity and file sharing after a
drought of interconnection between computers. An implementation of a program
called DC++, which uses a protocol known
as Direct Connect, has allowed students to
share their files directly over the network.
The program's setup on the network is
characterized by a central hub to which
students connect in order to view each others' files and then determine what they
want to download. Once a selection is
made, a connection is established between
the two computers directly, and the transfer begins.
The most notable feature of the program
is the rate at which students are able to
receive files. An average file rate is 400 kbps,
which is significantly faster than the rate at
which students receive files from the
Internet. Additionally, the program does not
use any Internet bandwidth since all traffic
is internal to the Swarthmore campus.
The Direct Connect hub is being managed by Joshua Berney 'O5, Josh Hudner 'O5
and Zachary Pezzementi 'O5.
Hudner decided to install the program
on the Swarthmore network when a block

THE PHOENIX

was placed by Information Technology
Services on all P2P sharing. Because of the
block, he was unable to download files
from the Internet.
"I saw the article in The Phoenix from
two weeks ago about the campus network
that mentioned Direct Connect," Hudner
said, and he decided to install the hub.
From there, word of the network was
spread throughout the campus by Berney
and the number of users on the network
grew. The hub, before break only had about
500 gigabytes worth offiles available on the
network. Now that figure is 2.3 terabytes,
or 2300 gigabytes.
Hudner said the program kept all traffic
on the inside, preventing any possible
cease-and-desist litigation. The internalization of traffic also optimizes bandwidth
usage by the students, Hudner said. Since
this program does not interfere with the
Internet connection, ITS does not need to
interfere with the operation.
The recent blockage of P2P programs
was implemented by ITS after a large number of network connections from the P2P
program Blubster brought down campus
Internet, ITS Manager of Networking and
Systems Mark Dumic said in an e-mail.
ITS said it would be tolerant of the
Direct Connect sharing.

Another major aspect of the project is
the construction of a new, one-way street,
to be called Lafayette Court, which will
eventually connect

Dartmouth and

the borough, this change is mainly to
"improve access to downtown" and to
improve the flow of traffic in the area. "I
think having a healthy downtown is one of
the main motivations [for the project]
as
well as having a center for community
...

life," Vincent said.
Plans for the revitalization project
began around 1994. A consultant was hired
in the late 1990s to give suggestions for
improvements to the Ville, according to
Billings and Vincent. This culminated in a
list of over 30 suggestions, including the
proposed changes to the streetscape, the
creation of Lafayette Court and the
rebuilding of the co-op.
The co-op construction will also occur
in the near future. According to co-op
General Manager Jack Cavanaugh, the
borough originally planned to purchase the
property next to the existing Co-op, tear it
down and put Lafayette Court there.
However, as co-op board members saw the
increasingly deteriorating condition of the
existing co-op building, they decided to buy
the property next to it instead. The
Borough will buy the current co-op property and tear it down to make room for

Court.
The new co-op will feature double the
retail space, a patio area and tables in the
Lafayette

front, Cavanaugh said. Cavanaugh also
said the co-op planned to "focus on perishables," and will feature more organic fodds,
produce and fish as well and more produce
from local farmers.
During the construction process, the coop only plans to close for a weekend in
August in order to move items from the
existing store into the newer one.
The work on the new co-op will begin in
December or January and should end

of the cuts have healed slowly. But
for many involved, these cuts were
about improvement. In fact, the

behind the board's original pledge.
"I do think that the college has
been living up to its commitments
strengthening the program, hiring coaches, upgrading facilities.
It's been a big morale boostfor athletes and coaches," Eldridge said.
These improvements show the
board's commitment, but Hertz
said players were a big part of the
progress. "We're seeing more landmark wins," Hertz said, citing the
men's soccer team's victory over
12th-ranked Johns Hopkins and
the volleyball team's defeat of
Haverford. "These are symbolic
victories, and they are signs that
we're improving across the board."
At the same time, Hertz recognized the need for patience.
Certain teams, especially baseball, were hit harder by the cuts
than others, and while the winloss records of these teams do not
show much improvement, those
in athletics see improvements in
the quality of play.
"Because a significant number
of baseball players were also football players, baseball was more
adversely affected by the football
cuts," Hertz said. "But we're seeing improvements now in the new
team members. First off, baseball
is their passion, and we're
recruiting from a stronger baseball pedigree. When you're living
on three or four spots a year, it's
going to be a while before you

While many teams are still

affirm its commitment to building
a stronger athletics program.
"The only way to do that was
to lower the number of athletes,
and that meant cutting a team,"
said Peter Collings, chair of the

advisory committee for physical

education and athletics.
Today, the athletics department seems to have put the cuts
behind it. Coaches and administrators agree that the athletics
program is enjoying a period of
development and improvement.

A growing program
Athletic Director Adam Hertz
arrived at Swarthmore in the
wake of the football cuts. The college hired him then as assistant
athletic director to bring a fresh
face to the department, one that
would lead a department that
would soon see much growth.
"I'm in my third year here," Hertz
said, "and, since I've been here,
I've seen marked improvement in
athletics across the board."
Over the past few seasons,
Hertz explained, he has witnessed
the board living up to its commitment of strengthening the program. He cited four areas off the
field where the college has grown:
the renovated lobby areas in the
Tarble Pavilion, the dugouts
recently added to the Softball and
baseball fields, the new drainage
system on the game fields and the
state-of-the-art turf field and

divide between athletes and non-

athletes. Yet whether this gap
exists is still up in the air.
"I never thought there was as
much of a divide as people projected," Dean of the College Bob Gross
'62 said. "Athletes tend to feel this
more acutely than non-athletes.
They tend to view themselves as
separate than other students."
While Gross and others
believe the gap is closing, coaches
and the admissions office
are focused on eliminating it. "I
don't think it's perfect by any
stretch, but I think it's better,"
Shibles said. "People are really
working hard to open up lines of
communication to make sure athletics is included in the larger

Swarthmore community."
"Our primary responsibilities
are to create a more understanding relationship with admissions,
to bridge the culture gap between
athletics and mainstream Swat
life," Hertz said.
Jim Bock '9O, dean of admissions, said his office worked close-

ly with athletics to enroll athletes
well suited to Swarthmore. "We
take a holistic approach in our
review of applicants regardless of

whether sports is involved," Bock
said. "In addition to strength of
curriculum and other objective
factors, we look for signs of intellectual passion, motivation, leadership and commitment."
Hertz had no complaints about

admissions. "Where some of our
competitors may look at students'
academic records, we look at what
they've done to separate themselves from the pack. I don't think

we can complain about what's

said.

Recruiting: a manic rat race
With the current development,
progress and increased under-

standing, the future ofathletics at
Swarthmore is far from stable. "I
have a lot of questions as to how
we can maintain competitive programs
in
the
Centennial
Conference when other teams are
bringing in more and more talent
and have twice the depth that we
have. It's getting harder and harder, and I don't know what the
future is," Shibles said.
Administrators and

coaches
echoed her sentiments. Almost
everyone pointed to one area, and
Eldridge summarized it neatly:

"Recruiting and the need to recruit
has become very poisonous."
The drive to recruit at the
Division 111 level has turned into
a manic rat race, and a recent
symposium on athletics in higher
education served to drive this
point home. "What I learned at
the symposium was the incredible heavy burden on coaches,"

Gross said. "The number of athletes who can compete
at
Swarthmore athletically and academically is fairly small, and
everyone is-after them. The world
we're competing in is creating
some very difficult conditions."
"Recruiting is a challenge at all
schools," Borbee said. "We're not
looking for really smart athletes.
We're looking for scholars who
•play sports, and they're tough to
find. Students who are a fit for
Swarthmore and can help oiir program are needles in a haystack,
and everyone wants them."
In reality, administrators do
not know the future of athletics at
a college Swarthmore's size. "The
coaches have an extremely diffi-

cult job, especially at a Division
111 school in our conference with
no athletic scholarships. We definitely have our work cut out for
us for the next three to five years
and beyond," Bock said.
Closer to home, the board is
assessing the present and future
of athletics. The advisory commit-

tee for physical education and athletics is just a few weeks away
from releasing its first assessment

on Swarthmore sports. "We've
tried to say, 'Let's go look at it and
tell it how it is,' committee chair
Collings said. "What comes out is
not seen as anyone's agenda."
When the committee
composed of coaches, faculty members and students
releases its
report in the spring, Collings said
the report should simply be
viewed as an assessment of the
progress made in the year following the cuts. "I think the report
will give an assessment plan that
is fairly comprehensive. It's, a
public way of seeing if we're mak"

ing any progress," he said.
While Collings noted that not

everyone's win-loss record has

improved and that improvement
has come in the quality of competition that Swarthmore's teams
offer, Hertz is looking forward to
the day when athletics is no
longer under such close scrutiny
at Swarthmore. "I'd like to see the
success becoming a non-issue," he

said. "That will mean that we
have* seamlessly blended athletics
with the goal of Swarthmore.
That means there is no culture
gap. People won't.be looking at
win-loss records, bewildered by
them. It means we will have

addressed the concerns of our

MOVING

Old wounds heal slowly Leaving it all behind
The last football players graduate this year, and
many harbor resentment over the 2000 decision
BY AMANDA BROWN-INZ
abrownil@swarthmore.edu
When the class of 2004 graduates

in the spring, it will mark the end of
an era for Swarthmore. There will no
longer be a student left who played on
Swarthmore's football team.
Three years after the college cut
its football program, the last generation of players has moved past its
anger toward successful college
careers, but the wounds are not
entirely healed.
"As much as I'd like to say I'm
past it, it's still a sore subject," Jared

Passmore 'O4 said.

When the players first found out

that the team was being cut, "we were
all surprised," Matt Williams 'O4 said.
Chris Ciarleglio 'O4 said he
remembered the night of the cut. "I
walked into the DU lodge and saw
one of the brothers crying,"
Ciarleglio said. "I asked 'What's
wrong?' and he said, 'We're done.
Football. They cut the program.'
Brandon Carver 'O4 said the players had fought to keep the team,
mobilizing press conferences and
strategy sessions, calling parents and
"

organizing meetings with coaches,

but the Board of Managers did not
revoke its decision.
"It was pretty outrageous,"
Brandon Estrella 'O4 said. "I felt the
decision was not only stepping on the
history of the school, but also the
'consensus not to have a consensus'
stuff was bullshit."
Estrella's mention of the "consensus not to have a consensus" referred
to the board's unanimous agreement
to vote on the football question rather
than coming to a consensus, its normal decision-making process.
Williams said he was upset that
"they didn't just come out and say
why they were getting rid of us."
At that point, most of the players
considered transferring, but Wes
Sconce 'O4 said he did not want to
deal with "the challenges of adjusting

THE PHOENIX

Transfer players discuss experiences at other colleges

to a new school."
"I thought about transferring, but
in the end it was too much hassle,"
Carver said in an e-mail. "I love the
friends that I have and the networks
of support that I have found here."
Ciarleglio echoed Carver's sentiment. "I stayed because I met the best
friends of my life here," he said.
Passmore said transferring to a
new school would require giving up
something else in exchange for foot-

ball. "No school breeds the same
amount of intellectual rigor as
Swarthmore does," Passmore said.
"I chose this school for academics,

not for football," Williams said. "It
didn't make sense to completely
change my college career because of

football."
Passmore said that, after deciding
to "experience Swat without football," he found his first fall without
the sport very difficult.
"I watched a lot of 'Family Guy,'
"

he said.

But, Passmore added, he was fortunate to find basketball, which
offered him an "outlet for athletic
energy and the chance to be part of a

team."
Former football players also
joined the baseball team and the
rugby team.
Carver played rugby, but, he said,
"although the sport is fun, I don't get
the same enjoyment out of it that I
did with football."
"There was a big void in my life
after football was cut," Estrella said.
"I mean, I wasn't happy to be here."
"I'm upset that I was promised
something and it was taken away
from me," Ciarleglio said.
"Yes, I'm happy with the opportunities it [Swarthmore] has given
me," Williams said. "I made the
most of my experience. I'm glad I
stayed. But does that mean that my
bitterness for the school is gone?

No."

"I've dealt with it. I mean, there's

nothing more I can do,"

Sconce said.

BY BREE BANG-JENSEN

bbangiel@swarthmore.edu

Three years ago, when the Board of Managers
decided to cut the football program, Swarthmore
lost more than a fall sport.
More than half a dozen juniors, sophomores
and first-years transferred to other colleges in
the aftermath of the cuts. The first-year football
players who left Swarthmore are now in their
senior year.
"I've had

a really nice experience at
University of Virginia," linebacker Jeff Gouline
'O4 said of his new school. "It wasn't an entirely
easy transition. Getting used to the size was
hard. Sophomore year, I took a pysch class that

has more students than my whole freshman
class at Swarthmore."
The administration did not influence players
as to whether to transfer. "Tedd Goundie was the
only person I talked to," Gouline said. "As an
individual, he was supportive of whatever decision I wanted to make."
Gouline still keeps in touch with his friends
from Swarthmore, and he said this was the first
semester he has not gone back to visit for a weekend. He injured his shoulder during his season at
Swarthmore and is not playing at UVA.
"I do not want to talk about Swarthmore or

the decision itself," Gouline said. "Stuff happens
that you don't like, and you deal with it and
move on. The thing for me to do after that year
was to leave."
Other transfer players declined to be interviewed, explaining that they were unwilling to

talk about their experience.
Brandon Carver 'O4, a former player who
stayed at Swarthmore, said students who transferred included Nick Licciano 'O3, Matthew

Badminton expects to retain varsity status
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangiel@swarthmore.edu

Along with the high-profile
football and wrestling cuts,
Swarthmore's high-performing
badminton team was reduced
from varsity to club status

three years ago.

Outraged, team members
lobbied the Board of Managers,
explaining that there was no
reason to change their sport's
status because, unlike football,
badminton does not engage in
recruitment.
"We just recruit from the
incoming class. Whoever wants
to play comes and plays. Some
are experienced, some are not,"
Co-Captain Surbhi Gupta 'O4

said.
December 4, 2003

"It workspretty well for us,"

Coach Jeffery Loomis said.
"Not that many schools have
varsity badminton teams, so
there is not much competition
for good players."
Over the past years, the badminton team has skillfully integrated

experienced

players

with novices to have strong
seasons. Last year, the team
had a 5-2 record and some players made it to the finals and
semifinals of a major East
Coast tournament. The team
was also ranked under number-one rival Bryn Mawr in the

league.
"As a coach, it's nice to have
a varsity status, because there
are certain perks available, like
coaching and financial support,

which gives us a chance to
compete at certain tourna-

ments, like nationals in San
Diego. Without varsity status,
it would be pretty difficult to
get to nationals," Loomis said.
Players and the coach are
optimistic about the future of
the team.
"My personal opinion is
that there is no reason to
change our status as a varsity
team,"
Co-Captain
Liz
Leininger 'O4 said.
"I haven't heard of any rumblings about varsity status for
next year, so I think it ought to
be fine. I'll worry about it after
this season," Loomis said.
The board will be reviewing
badminton's varsity status in

the spring.

No crunch for spring housing Diebold withdraws suit
moves themselves.
Westphal attributed the recent housing crunches
to fewer students going abroad in the fall due to

BY ELEANOR JOSEPH
ejosephl@Swarthmore.edu
For the first time in three years, the spring housing lottery will not end with a housing crunch,

according to Assistant Dean and Director of
Residential Life Myrt Westphal.
Westphal estimated that 79 students would be
returning from abroad or from a leave of absence
next semester. Of these students, 18 have joint tenancy or are planning to live off campus, leaving a
total of 61 students who will enter the housing lottery.

This number will increase slightly when more
students enter the lottery, which they must do by
the Dec. 6 deadline. Westphal anticipates that 60-70

students will participate in the lottery.
As about 60 students return to on-campus housing, around 100 students will go abroad in the
spring, according to Westphal. This leaves a net of
30 extra beds for next semester.
Westphal said she was trying to work the lottery
so that juniors would end up with singles. The
Housing Committee is not planning to put one-room
doubles occupied by one junior on the lottery list,
which she hoped the juniors would be able to use as

a single.

"Our goal is to house the juniors in single-type
space and pressure the freshmen and sophomores to
move together," Westphal said.
Patrick Quinn 'O5, who had a roommate in a
one-room double this fall, will have the room to himself in the spring. Quinn said that, because he was

disappointed about having a one-room double in the
fall, he feels "justified in getting a single, even
though it is ridiculously big."
Westphal said that, technically, the Housing
Committee could force sophomores to move in
together. In general, however, that has not been necessary, since most sophomores choose to make the

heightened international tensions.
Additionally, in an attempt to balance a previous
trend of the majority of students choosing to go
abroad in the spring, four years ago Swarthmore
started allowing seniors to go abroad during the fall
of their senior year. Due in part to the policy
change, for the past two years, the majority of students went abroad during the fall semester rather
than the spring, causing a crunch in the December
lottery.
This year, Westphal said, the numbers are back
to normal. Sixty students went abroad or were on
leave during the fall, compared with 100 students
during the spring.
Westphal said she believed juniors had opted to
go abroad in the spring this year in order to monitor world events during the fall and assess the security of foreign travel.
505 Field House Lane, a house converted for student residence to accommodate this fall's housing
crunch, will still be inhabited during the spring,
although the number of people who live there will
decrease from four to three.
Adam Hunt 'O6, who currently lives at 505 Field
House Lane and will stay there through next semester, said living there has worked out well. Hunt is
pleased, however, that one fewer student will be living in the space this coming semester. "It's a little

FTAA student protesters arrested and jailed

The Miami police were thorough when
they searched Evan Greer 'O7 and Alec
Armstrong 'O7. They cut pant legs, ripped
kneepads and "tested" for cups with a couple punches to the groin.
Finally satisfied, they charged Greer
and Armstrong with possession of burglary tools, unlawful assembly and resisting

arrest without violence.

they said.
"Motherfucking faggots."
Greer and Armstrong spent three days
in jail the week of Nov. 20 when they joined
over 10,000 people in Miami to protest the

protest and started walking through the
deserted streets. At 10:30 a.m., they came
upon a police staging area.
"We didn't look sketchy," Greer said.
"But they stopped us and asked us to open

Before even reaching the protest, Greer
and Armstrong were arrested and headed
for the police station in a paddy wagon.

The items gave the police reason to

"There is an element of guilt," Greer

said. "We were treated well, as heterosexual white males."
In jail, he and Armstrong were placed
with other white protesters, while others

were contained elsewhere.
Armstrong said that, during the entire
time he and Greer spent in the jailhouse,
he "never, at any stage of the process, knew
what was going on" regarding police procedure and never got to speak with an attorney.
They also staged a hunger strike for vegetarian and vegan food. "That was our only
success," Greer said.
Finally, through the efforts of Katharine
Sydenham 'O7 and Anna Torres 'O7, who
were responsible for legal support at

BY MEGO LIEN

Mark Danner and Leon Wieseltier return to
Swarthmore tonight for a reprisal of their March
debate on the war in Iraq. This time, the journalists will lead an informal forum on issues in the
aftermath of the war, namely the rebuilding of
Iraq and the position of the U.S. government.
"Justice, Security and the War in Iraq" will be
held at 7:30 p.m. in the Lang Performing Arts
Center and will be facilitated by political science
professor Kenneth Sharpe. Sharpe, who also moderated the March debate, hopes that students will
attend this event armed with "lots of good questions" for the two speakers.
During "The Great Debate" in March, Danner,
a professor of journalism at UC Berkeley and a
staff writer for The New Yorker, argued against
the war on the premise that it required "unnecessary efforts" that carried "enormous consequences," The Phoenix reported.
Wieseltier, literary editor of The New
Republic, represented the pro-war side and said
the international community had the responsibility to defend the freedoms of humanity.

launch of the North America Free Trade

Agreement in 1994 with the goal to expand
NAFTA from North America to every
country in Central America, South

America and the Caribbean, except Cuba.
FTAA's Ministerial Declaration states that,
through its efforts, "barriers to trade and
investment will be progressively eliminated" in order to "maximize market openness" in 34 countries. Negotiations are
expected to be completed by 2005.
"Free trade creates more opportunities,
more prosperity for people in the world,"
Ahmed Kabani told The Miami Herald. On
Nov. 20, Kabani staged a one-man rally for
the FTAA, wielding signs that read "Peace
Prevail on Earth."
Drowning out Kabani's efforts were the
legions of activists who have reacted to the
FTAA with angry disapproval. Greer, a
self-labeled anti-authoritarianist, called
the FTAA "an attempt by the richest members of society to exploit people in the
name of free trade," using words like "antidemocratic" and "frightening" to describe
"the expansion of global capitalism."
"The movement got its ass kicked,"
Greer said, but "it wasn't a complete failure." The FTAA settlement at the end of the
Miami summit was "watered down" and
"didn't really say much," Greer said.
However, Greer believes that in light of
the obstructive brutality they faced in
Miami, activists will "require new tactics"
to fight the causes they care about.
"There is no democracy in this country," Greer said. "So we need to fight for it
in the streets, at the grassroots level."

Clinical Psychology
Understanding the Mind

Swarthmore hosted the debate, which drew an
audience of over 400.
The two speakers are old colleagues who have
agreed and clashed on issues before, though
Danner has gone to Baghdad and has "more
active" experience of the war, while Wieseltier

better represents the Washington perspective,
Sharpe said.
Meanwhile, Sharpe expects to urge both speakers to focus the discussion on issues such as the
deception of the American public, the United
States' ability to create a replacement government
in Iraq, and the state of U.S. security today.
The speakers were brought to Swarthmore by
David Gelber '63, senior producer at CBS, with the
help of Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president of college and community relations, and Director of
News and Information Tom Krattenmaker.
"The war has happened, and Danner and
Wieseltier spoke to a large audience here,"
Eldridge said. "It seemed to me that it would be
useful to have their perspectives many months
later.
"This is an important period in current political history," he said. "The campus needs opportunities to focus on this topic."

A dryer in the basement of Dana dormitory
caused smoke and possibly flames the Saturday
before Thanksgiving break, prompting RAs to
evacuate the building and the fire department to
fumigate the smoky areas. But Public Safety
records and residents' reports diverge on the
details of the incident.
Public Safety's report indicated that three
fire alarms in Dana basement went off at 4:10
p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 22. When a fire alarm
goes off in a dorm, Public Safety is notified automatically. Officer James Ellis, Officer Joe
Louderback and Corporal Merritt Harman
responded and arrived at 4:12 p.m according to
the report.
In addition, the report states that an "RA
from Dana also called at this time to report a
showing of smoke from the laundry area of
Dana." But Sarah Donovan 'O4, the RA who made
the call, said her cellular phone registered the
call to Public Safety at 3:58 p.m.
Sam Graffeo 'O7, who lives in Dana basement,
said she saw smoke in the hallway, then went to
the laundry room and saw there was a fire. A
minute after, she said, the fire alarm went off,
and she went down the hall to tell the residents
there was a fire. She came back with a fire extinguisher, but, by that time, the flame had already
put itself out.
Later, Donovan and Olivia Toro 'O5, another
Dana RA, went down to the basement to investigate the source of the alarm. Toro said they had

found "scorch marks on the wall" and "thick
smoke."

Sergeant Brian Harris agreed that "it appears

that the fire was out by the time [Public Safety]
got there." But he also said there was "no evidence of anyone extinguishing the fire," and the
report said that officers had found "no origin of

fire."
Officer Louderback said he saw smoke coming
from the basement area and requested that the

windows be opened from the outside for ventilation, the report said. Corporal Harman reported' "a.
light smoke showing and a burning odor" and
requested that the Swarthmore Fire and
Protective Association be dispatched. Officer
McCans called 911, and Maintenance Supervisor
Bill Maguire "was notified and responded."
The report noted a "problem with wiring in
the laundry area."

and appeared to have been contained within the
outlet itself, he added.
The fire department shut off the power in the
outlet and notified the college's maintenance to
repair the outlet, according to Kline.
Harris said the firefighters brought in fans to
ventilate the laundry room.
In general, Public Safety notifies the fire
department if someone calls to report a fire. If
there is only an alarm, with no confirmation of an

actual fire, Harris said, Public Safety investigates
the site without calling the fire department first.
Usually, Harris said, the smoke that has set off the
alarm is from cigarettes or unattended cooking.
In this case, Donovan, the RA, said she did
call Public Safety to report that there was a fire.
But Public Safety, according to its report, had
already left by that time, and Donovan said the
officers had not arrived at Dana by the time she
finished her telephone call. The Public Safety
report also said Donovan had reported "a showing of smoke," not fire. Public Safety said it did
not find the origin of any flame or evidence of
anyone extinguishing the fire, but Dana resident
Graffeo reported seeing a fire.
Donovan said she had two questions regarding Public Safety's response two weeks ago.
"Did Public Safety appropriately wait those 15
minutes before calling the fire department, and
should the dispatchers have immediately called
the fire department when the RA reported there

was a fire?" she asked.

Donovan said the fire department took at

to Chief Ed Kline. Public Safety had caUed to

source could not be located, Kline said.
In accordance with protocol, the fire department does not differentiate between reports of
smoke and fire

When it arrived on the scene, the fire department found a "light smoke" in the basement and

The decision was due to a lack

housing tradition.
Jon,Rosa 'O3 and Bill Wanjohi

multicultural housing option to

CBC presents budget projection
BY RYAN CROKEN
rcrokenl@swarthmore.edu

The College Budget Committee presented an
updated five-year financial projection to the
Finance Committee on Nov. 19 snowing that tuition
could reach $46,000 by 2008.
While Suzanne Welsh, vice president for finance
and treasurer, said she would not even call the projection "tentative," she pointed out that budget
planning had to begin somewhere. "The five-year
projection is kind of our framework," Welsh said.
"We use it to look forward and see if anything is
looming on the horizon that we need to start worrying about now."

"We want to get the most
accurate data out there so that
tuition can be discussed from
the beginning rather than
implemented as an

emergency

measure."
Ryan Budish 'O4

mittee members propose the

plan again, they would encour-

age more conversation within
the college community about the
concept.

Prior to the presentation of the projection, CBC
members Ryan Budish 'O4 and Charlie Sussman 'O5
discussed rising health insurance costs and the
possibility of implementing a living wage, two
issues that could become problematic for the budget.
"We thought that the predicted health care costs
might have been a little deflated in the original
model," Sussman said, "and we wanted to keep in
mind the fact that we might have to start thinking
about a living wage in the near future and that it is
something that needs to be discussed."
Both Sussman and

Budish underlined

the

importance of accurately conceiving and discussing these and other issues that factor

into the

budget projections so that the tuition projection
would be as stable and as low as possible.

entire community.
Welsh said the projection is designed with the
aim of keeping tuition increases in line with family income rates, which she predicted would rise at
a rate of 1-2 percent more than inflation.
Additionally, the CBC hopes Swarthmore's
tuition will remain competitive with comparative
schools. Swarthmore's current tuition of $37,716
ranks 15th on the Consortium on Financing Higher
Education, a grouping of 31 Institutions of compa-

rable caliber.
Columbia tops this year's list at $38,590, while

Rice claims the lowest tuition rate of $25,841 Welsh
said sharing tuition projections with other schools

at this time violates anti-trust policies.
Welsh said the college's commitment to needblind admissions stands firm and that "this policy
is designed to insulate the financially aided fami-

lies from the tuition increases."
These priorities confront what Welsh called a
"challenging" fiscal environment for higher educa-

tion. The CBC predicted only a modest growth in
college revenue in upcoming years, and the college
currently faces lower endowment

investment

returns than it did during the 19905.
But Welsh said the college has managed well
through this economic turbulence and has emerged
"with little disruption and is well-positioned for the
future."
What the future holds for the tuition rate and
the college budget will be decided in the data generated by the CBC and campus-wide discussion
from now until February.
Student
Council
Co-President
Emiliano
Rodriguez 'O5 said a fireside chat between administration and students would take place during the
first few weeks of the spring semester.

"The documents are out
there. What are they going to do?
How many people are they going
to sue?" she said. "A U.S. congressman posted the memos on
his Web site. They can't sue
him."
She added that public pressure on Diebold has not been
particularly great. "Their stock
price has gone up through all of
this. The state of Maryland is
still going through with purchasing Diebold machines," she
said. "Has Diebold been hurt?
No."

With this weekend's performance
of Edward Albee's "A Delicate
Balance," Senior Company is reaching the end of what has been, in the
view of co-director Adrienne Mackey
'O4, "one Of the smoothest end-of-production" periods she's experienced.
This is lucky, considering the
scope of the company's endeavor:
bringing to the stage a two-and-a-half
hour, dialogue-driven play in which
majority of the characters are middleaged or older and making it relevant
for college students. But with such a
talented cast
Felicia Leicht 'O4,
Audrey Pernell 'O4, Rebecca Ennen
'O4, Sam Dingman 'O4, Matthew
Fitting 'O5, and Maria Alvarez 'O4
anything is possible, Mackey said.
Although the play, "A Delicate
Balance" by Edward Albee, won the
Pulitzer Prize in 1966, it has proven
fairly easy to adapt to a modern setting, according to co-director Mark
Boucai 'O4. "The WASP culture it's
about isn't supposed to change. I
think it carries over well," he said.
Boucai had nothing but praise for
the play, calling it an "amazing piece

of realism.
"It's kind of a parable, it's kind of
simple, but, once you get into it, its

really deep," he said. Mackey agreed,
saying that she felt that "A Delicate
Balance"

was better than Albee's
more well-known play, "Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?"
The cast is excited about the
upcoming performances Friday,
Saturday and Sunday at 8 p.m.
"It's going to be a really good production," said Mackey. "I know that
sounds cocky, but I think its true."

Departing shots: a potpourri of sex tips

SARAH WALSH
Sex and the Swattie

This is my last column
of the year, since I am journeying to Italy in the
spring (thank you, God).
All week I have been racking my brain for an appropriately significant last
topic. Masturbation seemed
the logical pick, and ending
my sex writing stint with
the practice that first
launched it appealed to
me, but I've integrated it
into most of my columns
anyway. People who have

never spoken to me probably know me as "Vibrator
Girl." So I've decided that,
in lieu of a single theme, I'm going to finish up with a
handy list of some of my favorite sex tips. I am not going to

include more explicit advice regarding actual techniques,
but as always, I am always available (even next semester)
to answer e-mails or phone calls which I will handle with
the most discretion possible.
L Seriously examine your own views about sex practices, especially what you may consider "wrong." Sure,
you'll probably have some boundaries, but, if you make
them too rigid, you may be denying yourself a lot of orgasmic fun. I've noticed that it's difficult for some heterosexual people to stop thinking of "sex" only as the penis-invagina variety, even though vaginal penetration alone
does not ring many women's bells. (Sorry to any queer
readers out there. I know it is probably amusingly obvious
to you that good sex is hardly specific only to penetration
especially the penile variety.) Try to think of "sex" as a
...

10

label for a variety of acts, including but not limited to finger sex, oral sex, masturbation (mutual or solo), vaginal or
anal penetration with various body parts or sex toys, etc.
2. Try out sex toys. They are an incredible amount of
fun arid are not all "scary." There are plenty of great websites out there that will let your purchase high-quality
gadgets, but don't shop from discount stores. Even an $8
vibrator isn't worth it if it doesn't work. If you do make
these budget purchases, you may end up having a conversation like I did one Sunday morning with my friendly sex
toy salesman while getting my morning coffee. "Are you
sure it's powerful? Rate it on a scale of one to 10..."
3. Masturbate. There are still some of you out there who
do not engage in my favorite variety of self-love. Becoming
a masturbator not only provides you with regular relief
from the stress of exams, it also ensures that you will be
able to get lucky whether you have someone in your life
(or your bed) or not. Not a bad deal.
4. Masturbate during partner sex. Please, please get
yourself out of the mindset that "good sex" must only
involve one person only touching the other person.
Masturbation during vaginal penetration with a penis, sex
toy, etc. will definitely help you to orgasm during this act
if you generally do not. Most women cannot orgasm with
penetration alone, so don't resign yourself to a series of
boring experiences. Similarly, only a very small percentage of men and women can orgasm from anal penetration
without penile or vaginal stimulation (masturbation), so
make sure that you masturbate throughout the act in
order to relax your muscles and make the experience a lot
more fun. (No, anal sex should not be painful unless something is wrong. Read up about it online if you're interested.) Finally, mutual masturbation is great, because it can
be a great way to have partner sex if one of you is in the
mood but the other is not. This can take some of the pres-

December 4, 2003

sure offrelationships in which there is friction because of
differing libido levels.
5. Take a "sex-positive" view of safer sex practices.
Constantly focusing on the hassle or annoyances of using
protection means you will probably not be a consistent
user. Look at using protection as a necessary part of sex in
our culture. It is a sign that you respect yourself and your
partner. It is a sign that you take a mature and responsible
view of sex.

People who have never spoken to

me probably know me as
"Vibrator Girl."

6. Finally, read sex books. This one is self-explanatory.
No one is born a sex god or goddess. It takes practice, but
you can bypass some of the actual between-the-sheets awkwardness by reading up on what other people have learned
the, er, hard way.
Thanks to everyone who stopped me on campus to tell
me they liked the column (I think there were four in all),
especially Kate and Michelle at the Coffee Bar. Hopefully, I
will be back next year and perverted as ever ... assuming
The Phoenix will continue to tolerate my jilling-off-loving
ways.
Sarah Walsh, a junior, is going to Italy next semester.
This is her last column until next fall, but, ifyou want to get
in touch with her, you can e-mail swalshl@swarthmore.edu.
She'll answer your sex-related questions from across the
ocean.

Hall turned rotten around the age of 4, when Santa Claus failed to
deliver the only items on his Christmas list, the letters

the young child, turning him into the bitter, paranoid
shell of a human being his peers remembered him to
be. ■
Ironically, he would later receive a surplus of C's
and D 's later in life during his college education.
Hall rode the tide of academic mediocrity at his
dilapidated high school all the way to Swarthmore
College,- a self-important East Coast school known for

its inventive methods of distributing its excessive
endowment anyplace but its student body.
At

Swarthmore, Hall was active in the Hobo Trolley, a

community service organization, and the Vanilla

Eight-year bookstore veteran Tom Ermel and his wife Bonnie, a nurse's aid at Worth, will retire at the end of thesemester.

BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarth.more.edu

A few weeks after Tom Ermel retired from his management job at Boeing in July 1995, his wife Bonnie, wh©
has worked as a nurse's aide at the Worth Health Center
for 12 years, literally pushed him out of his chair. •
"He was home for three" months," she said, "and I saw
that all-he did was wake up and sit in his chair all day."
Bonnie had heard of a job opening at the bookstore on
campus, and she encouraged Tom, who had worked at
Boeing for 33 years, to apply for the job. After a successful interview, Tom was hired. For the past eight years, he
has worked as a part-time cashier at the bookstore.
>•

Putting in 22 hours a week behind the counter, Ermel has
become a familiar face to those who visit the store.
But he and his wife have decided it is time to move on.
At the end of this semester, Tom and Bonnie will be hanging up their proverbial Swarthmore uniforms as they
head winters in Florida, summers in Maryland and a life
of retirement.
Even though Tom has retired once before in his life,
this is Bonnie's first retirement, and the couple is looking forward to long-awaited downtime. "I'm looking forward to the newness of every day being Saturday or
Sunday and being able to do what we want to do when we
want to do it," Tom said. "It's a new thing for us."
Despite the desires for a life without work, it's clear
from the wistful tone in Tom's voice and look in Bonnie's
eyes that the two won't soon forget their time at
Swarthmore. "I didn't know what to expect when I started," Tom said. "I didn't know a cash register from a shoebox. But I've loved every minute of it. It turned out to be
10 times more fun that I expected it to be, and the kids
made it that way."
"It's been a wonderful experience being able to take
care of students while they're sick," Bonnie said. "Being
away from home, they come into Worth just wanting to

see people who care."
Tom has endeared himself to many students over the
past eight years as a familiar face in the bookstore, and
he knows he often provides a bright spot during stressful
days on campus. "We have a lot of fun with the kids," he
said, speaking for the bookstore staff. "We can tell when
they're down, and we always try to pick them up."
Whether it's to .pick up a copy of The New York Times,
send or receive a fax or pick up a roll of developed film,
THE PHOENIX

students are constantly running in the bookstore during
the year. Standing behind ■ the counter during the
lunchtime rush, Tom manages to make friends with lots
of what he affectionately terms "the kids."
"I bet Tknow a third of the kids by first name while
they're here," he said. "On the whole, I don't think we've
had a bad bunch of kids since I've been here."
But getting to know the students is just the beginning
for Tom. "A cashier in a bookstore is like a bartender in
a bar," Tom said. "They become a listening post, a shoulder to cry on. We can loosen the students up with a joke

or just lend them a sympathetic ear."
'Tom said the stories from the years are too numerousto recount, but he smiled as he recalls various couples he
has counseled through rough patches in their relationships and all of the students who come in looking
stressed and leave the bookstore with a smile on their
face. "These are the fun things to me," he said. "I never
had the experiences with the kids that Bonnie had. At
Boeing, it was always a" bunch of adult crises. Here,
you're wrapped up in the kids' world."
Carrying with them all of the fond memories of
Swarthmore and its students, at the end of the semester,
Bonnie and Tom will begin that second life as snowbirds.
Flying to Florida for the winter, they will return home
each summer to spend time at their home in Maryland,
near their three children and nine grandchildren.
While Tom and Bonnie will no longer be permanent
fixtures on campus, Tom thinks he'll be back. "I would
like to be here for the graduations of all the kids I know,"
he said. "I also might come back at the rush times in
September to help out the rest of the guys in the bookstore."
"It would be great to continue if we were 15 years
younger," Bonnie said, "but there comes a time your life
when it's time to do something else."
Tom's co-workers know he will be missed. "It'll be different, no matter who comes in," Charlie Stasiunas said.
"Tom had a lot of friends here. He loved the people both
in front and in back of the counter."
"We're really going to miss him," Bookstore Director
Kathy Grace said. "He's been great fun."
Although Grace said she will hire another part-time
employee to work behind the counter, she and Stasiunas
gave an impromptu tribute to Tom. As they were talking
about a future without Tom behind the counter, they
shouted in unison, "No one can ever replace him."

December 4, 2003

The beginning of Hall's end occurred when he was
forced to take a job as a newspaper columnist to offset
decreases in his financial aid, Mounting indifference
and apathy toward his column eventually boiled over,
and Hall didn't last a whole semester. Hall is survived
by his imaginary goldfish "Stinky" and his sentient
collection of stolen WSRN equipment.

Battlefield Swat: when animals attack
BY EVAN BUXBAUM

ebuxbaul@swarthmore.edu

It's something they won't tell you on the tour. You can't read it in the handbook. Swarthmore College is at war.
The enemy? A beast battalion whose ranks swell with every passing day.
Home to a national arboretum, the college houses more than just students and
and often belligerent
academics; it is also home to a host of diverse
animals. As fall shifts to winter and climates become harsher, the animals are at
their feistiest. Sometimes, the cohabitation just doesn't work.
"The animals here, they just go at you, for no reason," Amy Stocker 'O7 said.
"They see you, and they go nuts."
Most of the time, these encounters happen outside in semi-secluded areas.
Lonely paths, sheltered garden patches in between buildings, the amphitheater.
But the heavier casualties are consistently felt along the front lines: the Crum.

"I was minding my own business, orienteering in the in the Crum," Jason
Lee 'O6 said, "when this bee dive-bombed right into the side of my head. And I
didn't even touch it, it just stung me. And the stinger went right into me, and it
stayed there."
Lee found the stinger still in his head hours later. "I couldn't see it still in
there because I have black hair, so I didn't know it was there," he said. "I was
Pearl Harbor, and the bee was a Japanesekamikaze pilot."
Recently, incidents have become more widespread. Attacks are becoming
more and more common in open areas such as Parish Beach, Mertz field and
various parking lots around campus. Most of these attacks come from above, as
the exposed terrain of the areas leaves little cover for ground approach.
across the parking lot next to the Science
"I was walking to Woolman
Center
and all of a sudden something huge hits the top of my head, and scrabbles across my face," Nim Cohen 'O6 said. "It falls off and hits the ground next
to me. I was in shock. At first I thought someone had thrown something at me.
Then I noticed there was a squirrel on the ground next to me. I was like, 'I did
not just get attacked by a squirrel.' I stood there, stunned, for like five seconds.
I must have looked like a particularly short tree, or maybe the squirrel just had

a vendetta or something."
Kristen Davis 'O6 was the victim of an aerial assault on her way home to
Willets. "Out of nowhere, a big nut hit me right on the shoulder," Davis said. "I
looked up and there was a malicious squirrel perched in the tree. I know he
threw it at me, and he would do it again."
This increased incidence of animal attack, and audacity of aggression, may
have something to do with the season. As winter approaches, the animals are
left scrounging for less and less food and are faced with increasingly colder cli-

mates.
A wide variety of animals make their residence at Swarthmore: badgers, raccoons, birds, bees, mosquitoes, insects. All are threatened by winter. But the
infamous squirrels account for just over 50 percent of all animal attacks, according to an informal poll of over 20 attacked students. As winter approaches, the
squirrel must make hasty preparations by digging nuts into the ground in various locations. This can lead to a frenzy of digging around campus, higher squirrel agitation and more squirrel-student conflict.
As the most difficult season approaches, the animals won't stop at anything.
Skirmishes are breaking out all over the campus. Recently, the warfare has
even been brought to the home front: the dorms.
Sachin Kale 'O4 was attacked by a centipede, or, as they are called colloquially in Dana and Hallowell, Dana bugs.
"I went into the bathroom, and got in the shower, and there were four huge
Dana bugs in there with me," Kale said. "They all started running at my feet,
coming from different directions, encircling me. I just started jumping like mad
to get away."
But domestic animal attacks are not limited to shower encounters. Adam
Bisno 'O6 said he narrowly escaped an attack in the laundry room of Pittenger.
"I went down to do laundry, and I saw a squirrel freaking out and running
around in circles," Bisno said. "It saw me, and we had a showdown. But it stared
me down and I ran away. It was a close call."
As yet, there have been no severe casualties. "As long as we are talking about
real animals, and not party animals, then no, there haven't been any injuries,"
Geri Coles, a nurse practitioner at Worth Health Center said. "I work ten hour
shifts in the health center, and I've been doing it for ten years, and I haven't
seen any bad bites yet. We get a lot of bee stings, but no mammal wounds."
Try telling that to Nim Cohen. "I definitely bled." Cohen said. "But no

rabies."
Or to Jason Yamada-Hanff 'O7, who was attacked by bees on Parrish lawn. Or
Karen Lorang 'O7, who had a tiff with a squadron of mosquitoes that left her
with ten bites on one arm alone. Or to Reshma Pattni 'O6, who was chased by a

squirrel in front of Kohlberg.
Emily Regier 'O6 is scared to go home to Willets because of "the dirtiest thing
alive" that prowls it.
"The Willets cat is crazy," Regier said. "I saw it eating a live chipmunk."
With winter around the corner, there are fewer and fewer places to hide.
Safety becomes more difficult to find. Or perhaps, as Davis sees it, impossible.
"In the long run, if you want to be safe, avoid Swarthmore College, because
it's an arboretum and it houses lots of disgusting animals that try to kill people.
If you've ever wondered why students are a little imbalanced here, just think
about it for a second. You would be too if you had to fight off wild beasts for four
years."
"The beasts are rising," Davis concludes. "We need to get rid of the trees. It's
their last stronghold."

JAMMIN' JAMBOREE

The a cappella Jamboree, a much-loved fixture of the
reading week period, is scheduled for Dec. 9 and 10. The
Phoenix profiled several of these groups in honor of their
upcoming concert.

Jamboree allows Swarthmore's eight a cappella
groups to showcase their new material. This year's
Jamboree will feature performances by Sticks and Stones,
Mixed Company, Sixteen Feet, Grapevine, Oscar and
Emily, Essence of Soul, Chaverim and ACRONYM.
Jamboree is put together by one of the groups on a
rotating basis, with Sticks and Stones as this semester's
organizers. According to member Autumn Quinn-Elmore
'O4, organizing Jamboree mainly constitutes reserving
space at Lang, getting the technical crew in order, and,
most importantly, publicizing. "It's a place to show off, a
place to do new stuff. It's very well-attended every year
because there are eight groups on campus, so virtually
everyone knows someone in a group," Quinn-Elmore said.
The crowning point of the show is the introductory skits
the organizing group writes and performs to introduce
each of the other acts. The skits, which are top secret,
make a point to satirize the groups. Past skits have included Monty Python, 'Bos, and prehistoric themes. "It's supposed to be a surprise, so we try not to talk too much
about it, but I can say we're very excited about the skits
we're pulling together," Quinn-Elmore said.
By Melissa Phruksachart
Mixed Company
With a repertoire that includes everything from recent
pop to a Finnish drinking song, Mixed Company is perhaps the most eclectic group on campus. 'Rubber Ducky'
is a perennial favorite," group member David Mister 'O4
said. "We tend to have the occasional quirkier song, more
off the beaten path." Their playlist includes anything and
everything, whatever group members decide to arrange.
"While the music doesn't take itself seriously, the people
take making music seriously," Mister said.
Mixed Company was founded in the spring of 1991 by
seven first year students and a sophomore. At the time, the
only other a cappella groups on campus were 16 Feet and
Grapevine, so the founders decided to start a coed group.
Membership this year is up to 12 people, the largest it's
been in a long time.
Last year Mixed Company recorded its 12-track CD,
"Ducks in a Row." "I'm proud of it," said Mister. "It was an
organizational nightmare, but the time actually spent in
the studio was a lot of fun. We grew closer as a group."
The group is excited about singing at Jamboree. "We've
got one of our strongest sets ever," said Mister, "and we're
looking forward to knocking people's socks off!"

in 198 L Sixteen Feet, Swarthmore's oldest a cappella group,
had eight members. Now it's up to 10, with one more member taking a semester at Pomona College. They sing "everything from traditional 'sos doo-wop to jazz to cheesy pop and
rock," group member Allen Frost 'O4 said. "We don't really
try to concentrate on one genre; when someone thinks a
song would sound good a cappella, he arranges it, and we see
what it sounds like."
Sixteen Feet has traveled all over the US and Europe. So

far, they've done concert tours in Italy, Ireland, California,
New Orleans and, most recently, France. This year they're
performing in Carnegie Hall, and have been invited to participate in the International Competition for Collegiate A
Cappella (ICCA). "We're the only group from Swat that's ever
sent in an audition tape to the contest, and we were chosen
on our first try," Frost said.
Their CD, Feetal Position, was recorded over fall break
this year. Frost called the recording process "intense."

"We spent five consecutive days in the studio, recording
and mastering the tracks," he said. "Each day was eight
hours long, and we were exhausted by the time it was over,
"m surprised all of us are still alive. It was worth it, though."
Mobile group that they are, 16 Feet will be .singing at
Haverford, at Johns Hopkins and in the Ville within weeks
of Jamboree, so it's hard to prepare additional songs, but
they're looking forward to it anyway. "It's fun to see what the
other groups have been working on," Frost said. "We'll bring
our solid musical talent, and hopefully some fun, too."

Cantatrix
For one of Swat's younger groups (founded in 1994),
Cantatrix certainly does not act its age. Specializing in the
Renaissance period, this group reaches far into the past for
music worthy of performing. "As long as it's not modern, we
will probably sing it," group member Nathaniel Peters 'O7
said. Cantatrix sings mostly classical music, in a variety of
styles, languages, and time periods. Certainly this group will
bring a unique sound to Jamboree, and Peters put it thus:
"We'll expose the audience to Dilasso as opposed to
Divinyls," Peters said. Cantatrix has no definite plans for
their next CD cutting.
Oscar and Emily
Swarthmore's only all-jazz a cappella group, Oscar and
Emily will add a punch to Jamboree, claim its members.
"Most of the other groups are very similar in the kind of
music they do, so we're definitely a change from that," member Amara Telleen 'O6 said. "We spice things up a bit."
Oscar and Emily is not working on a CD and has no definite plans for a future one. Formerly a four-person group, O
and E has three new members. The group is in "a transitional stage," says Telleen. "We're taking our time to develop our sound and really work on producing quality jazz
music."

Grapevine
Grapevine, Swarthmore's all-female a cappella group,
sings a little bit of everything, from pop to bluegrass.
Grapevine was started in 1986 by 'la group of female singers
who wanted a group just for themselves," says group member Justene Hill 'O4. "Kinda like Sex in the City, but a cappella style." Let no one say this all-girl group doesn't define
sisterhood. "I absolutely adore the girls in Grapevine," said
Jenna Adelberg 'O6. "We have such a good time." The group
is preparing "a really great mix of music for Jamboree,
including an awesome Japanese song, so I think beyond our
fantastic good looks, we will just add more depth and variety
to the show," Adelberg said. Grapevine's newest CD, "Purple
Reign," came out last spring.

'Actually' not lovable at all
To: Richard Curtis
From: Ester Bloom
Re: "Love Actually," the Debacle of the Year
It's time for some tough love. Richard Curtis (or should
I call you Dick?): As the writer and director of "Love
Actually," when your movie crashes and burns, it is
incumbent on you to understand why. Otherwise you'll

never learn.
I don't mean to be harsh, Richard, but as you yourself
say in your movie, it's Christmas and at Christmas you tell

the truth.
"Love Actually" has everything in the world going for
it. It packs a talent wallop in the form of Emma Thompson,
Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton, Laura Linney, Liam
Neeson and Colin Firth. It's a romantic comedy, and you
already have several successful ones under your belt
("Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Bridget Jones's Diary,"

"Notting Hill.")
By now, you should know the formula cold: attractive
man attractive woman conflict resolution
happy
audiences. All that remains for you to do, Richard, is write
a story that combines these elements in a coherent, mildly
•
•
entertaining way.
To say that you overshot would be putting it kindly.
Instead of delivering one fleshed-out story with subplots,
you surprised everyone with eight: some farcical, some
tragic, some realistic, all underdeveloped and utterly

bizarre.
I don't mean to get personal, Rich, but you seem to have
a fixation on old men and young women who work for
them. Whether the young woman is a maid, a secretary, an
employee or a member of the household staff, if her boss is
sexually explicit with her in the workplace, it's not romantic, it's harassment.
On some level, you seem to understand that. Britain's
prime minister (Hugh Grant) defends the honor of a member of his staff, on whom he has a crush, once he sees the
visiting American president (Billy Bob Thornton, ham-,
ming it up as our national cowboy) groping her. The prime
minister is in fact so outraged that he delivers 'an

impromptu television address changing the direction of
British foreign policy away from America.
Why then doesn't the prime minister realize that transferring that same staff member because he's attracted to
her is also ethically questionable?
Speaking of things that are ethically questionable, why,
Rich, do you portray trying to break up other people's
marriages as a Christmas-y thing to do? In two separate
instances you show a person using Christmas as an excuse
for hitting on someone who's married. I'm Jewish, so
maybe I don't understand, but I thought Christmas was
about consumerism, family and mawkish songs. And baby
Jesus, for baby Jesus's sake! Not reckless, selfish hedo-

nism.

It must be hard for you, a Brit, to design a movie for
American, consumption. True, we're suckers for a lot of
what your movie promotes: heterosexual love, objectified
women, people hugging in airports. The problem is, you
oscillate between pandering to us and mocking us.
I'm riot saying your hostility is entirely unwarranted.
We Americans are willing to put up with a sickening number of cliches as long as they're in celebration ofLove. We
will even sit through essentially the same movie over and
over again just because we think it's-so great when an
attractive guy and an attractive girl get together.
But we buy your movies, so,
meet us halfway.
Give us characters to care about. Spend time raising the
stakes or twisting the plot. If the audience isn't invested
and is only getting off on the attractive characters on
screen getting off, then what you've made, Richard, is two
hours of expensive, well-scored, but weirdly asexual, porn.
I don't mean to be too hard on you. Liam Neeson as a
man learning to cope with the single parenthood of his
young son has poignant moments and clever dialogue, and
Emma Thompson as a wife who realizes her marriage is
being threatened is heartbreaking. Either of those storylines on its own, or even together, would make an interesting film. But, as it is, they get lost.
' ;
I hope you'll keep, some of this in mind as you polish
"The Edge of.Reason." Good luck, and have a merry

Christmas.

Furtado serves up a simmering stew of pop
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
bmonkpal@swarthmore.edu
She had people singing along to the infectious "I'm Like
a Bird" and her unique voice propelled her to a Grammy win
in 2002 for her debut album, "Woah Nelly!" With the release
of her sophomore venture "Folklore," Nelly Furtado proves
to remain an eccentric exception to an otherwise repetitive
pop music scene.
Furtado's image is largely based on a certain mystique
found in her music as well. Her dark hair, deep-set eyes,
eclectic dress and keening voice exude an aura of mystery;
she imbues the "folklore" of her music with this same exotic air. Folklore can be defined as traditional songs passed
down orally to a group of people. In this sense, Furtado is
offering her own experiences and emotions to the public and
she does so in a distinct way that gives credit to both her
lyricism and the actual music of the tracks on the album.
Born in British Columbia but of Portuguese heritage,
Furtado's range of musical influences are great and with a
stylistic twist of her own, she is able to fuse various genres
into a nonrestrictive sound. Folklore has qualities of pop,
rock, soul, Latin, Brazilian, hip hop, and, of course, folk in
each track. Termed "post folk," she receives help from the
production team of Track and Field to bring a more mod-

ernistic quality to the genre. She employs instruments such

as the banjo, tambourine, and cymbals to create a different
atmosphere redolent of foreign cultures.
On her first album, Furtado steered clear of truly nega-

tive thoughts and ideas. Folklore has found a way to connect
pessimism and optimism in a meaningful and even upbeat

of its appeal comes from its own position

almost come off as overly laudatory to those
not already convinced of the Giants' greatness, but it also provides plenty of solid evidence, mostly in the form of live performance
footage (unfortunately mostly relatively
recent). Of course, one wouldn't really expect
a lot of negative critical analysis, and there
isn't much unless you count an amusingly
parodic expose-style segment about their coffee addiction ("I've seen them abuse it ...it's
definitely a problem," the band's tour manager confides), or the insinuations of the gregarious Syd Straw ("Have people been saying
they're nice guys? Have you talked to anyone
who really knows them?") Perhaps most

touching is the film's exploration of the long-lasting
friendship and working relationship of the two markedly
different Johns, which finds each of them confiding his
admiration for and envy of the others' talent and originality (Flansburgh calls Linnell his greatest influence as a
songwriter; Linnell speaks of Flans as "the more rare commodity")

Largely eschewing a historical structure in favor of a
more topical framework, "Gigantic" isn't as fact-filled and
educational a document as it might have been, but it succeeds marvelously in almost every other respect

tribute, as an argument for the band's importance and as

As proven with her latest album, Nelly Furtado continues to break the barriers of pop music with a particular

Win or lose
One of the biggest controversies on our campus is
the issue of how we, as a Division 111 school with limited resources, ought to handle athletic recruiting. We
believe the reason for the controversy is because of a
largely misplaced priority. Too many of us still think
sports are about winning games.
Bear with us a moment.
Yes, athletic programs take most of their structure
from competing against other school's programs, and

many of the physical and psychological benefits athletes reap from their training occur as the result of
the pressure of competition. And no one can deny that
the thrill of victory is a large part of what makes
sports fun and engaging.
But ultimately, given the mission of our school and
our NCAA division, we find too many people still put
too much emphasis on win-loss records when judging
the success of a Swarthmore athletic program.
It may be a silly, overused platitude, but it's true:
It isn' about whether you win or lose, but how you
play the game, especially at our school. In its aca-

demic sphere, Swarthmore doesn't give us class
ranks, nor does it honor a valedictorian, salutatorian
or dean's list, nor does have high-power research
departments that allow professors to publish papers
for prestige. The liberal arts tradition is one where
students grow subjective and idiosyncratically as people first and attempt to score points in the world's

ranking systems second.

The stated mission of our athletic program is to
give athletes the same chance to grow as whole individuals through sports. This means that, yes, athletes
ought to train as hard as they can to win. It also
means that there is a place in the admissions process
for finding prospective students with a real love and
talent for athletics to enrich the program.
But we must not start down the path of attempting
to recruit simply to win more games, the path that
has ultimately turned Division I schools into hybrid
educational institutions and sports entertainment
franchises. To win games because one had access to
better athletes from the beginning is no testament to
the strength of one's athletic program; the real measure of our program is how much athletes improve and
grow while they are with us. If other Division 111
schools have strayed from this mission, it is more a
sign that perhaps a new division is needed to support
schools like Swarthmore than that Swarthmore
should become like other schools.

Fire hazards
Everyone knows that there are standard operating
procedures for every emergency that could arise on
campus, but very few people know what they are.

When fires break out, quick response is essential, yet
rarely are there organized systems in place in dorms
to deal with such emergencies.
The confusion over the proper procedure in the
Dana basement fire is a case in point; though nothing
serious happened, the conflicts over what ought to be
taken as a sign of a fire and what signs of fire warrant
calling the fire department show a disturbing lack of
readiness. Shouldn't we all know these rules?
In this particular case, it seems obvious to us upon
review of the incident that the best thing for a student
who sees smoke to do is call the fire department
directly, since Public Safety can do nothing but verify their sighting and then call the department themselves, giving the fire time to spread. But how many

Intolerance pervades Swarthmore
BY SUSAN ZELL

Here in our lovely little enclave of intellectualism.
as smart, generally left-leaning
young people claim to be some of the most open-minded, tolerant people you'd meet, I have still witnessed many examples of intolerance in my admittedly short time here, and
very seldom from the usual suspects.
I think we were all shocked to discover that someone had
vandalized the Intercultural Center sign this fall. That incident was random act of intolerance number one. The second
random act of intolerance was when certain professed members of the queer community declared that heterosexuals
"don't have the right" to an opinion on the vandalism or
people's reaction to it.
Then there is the matter of Israel-Palestine.
Despite the fact that we,

Acknowledging that there have been atrocities committed
by both sides and suggesting that both groups should get
their fair share of land is tantamount to being an antiSemite. Fabricating silly little ad hominem arguments doesn't seem like the best way to prove one's point.
And, even though I'm a woman, I don't agree that all men
are trying to keep us down and I don't need to read 100-plus
signs telling me that if men could get pregnant, they would
make abortion a sacrament. Save the trees, please! As a
member of the pigment-challenged, I'm hurt to hear that I'm
responsible for a bunch of white guys enslaving people back
when my ancestors were innocently hanging around
Europe. Can't we all just get along?
I could go on, but frankly, I don't care what minority you
can claim membership in if you're just a jerk about it. What
about the subjugation of the big-footed citizens of America,
when do we get a voice? (Stomp!)

My Pan-Africanism: Why I write

If you have ever been to a
protest for a leftist cause before,
then you are familiar with this
scene. Thousands of protesters
like yourself carrying posterboard signs, flags and puppets
move together toward the area
where the protest is permitted to
take place. As you walk, hundreds of cops in riot gear (plastic
handcuffs strapped onto their
belts, equipped with rubber-bullet guns, mace, stun-guns and fire
hoses) line up beside you. Their
MARISSA VAHLSING presence thickens as you walk,
and reports from ahead that fellow protesters have been arrestProgresso
ed trickle back through the
crowd. It doesn't even feel like
you're in the United States anymore.
Before you know it, the cops in their riot gear are telling you
that you can't walk any further. Confused, you ask the policemen
why you can't make your way to the permitted protest on a public street. In response, the officers start penning your group in
with corrals and telling you to stay put. In an exercise of what
they call "crowd control," you are locked into your space, pressed
up against hundreds ofothers. You can't move and you need to go
to the bathroom. Helicopters are circling above and you know
that the CNN one is not counting you as a number at the protest.
You never did make it to the permitted rally after all. (This usually helps explain why the media cites 50 percent fewer present at
the protest than you saw with your own eyes).
After hours of being locked and penned in, the crowd around
you gets restless. Cold and tired, they can't stand any longer.
Someone from behind you starts telling you to push forward.
Soon enough, middle-aged women, union workers, student
activists, reporters and even children are all pushing against the
pens, trying to escape. You all surge forward and the cops push
back. Hundreds more cops on horses arrive, and they drive the
horses into the crowd. In the chaos, you start to run from the
scene. Around you the police are indiscriminately arresting,
detaining and beating up protesters around you. Rubber bullets
are fired into the crowd, mace from police canisters burns your
eyes and the legs of horses seem to be kicking everywhere. Many
protesters sit down on the ground and hold their hands up in the
air in peace signs as a sign of submission. But the police do not
discriminate. Soon, everyone around you is detained, wrapped in
plastic handcuffs, loaded into paddy wagons or has run away for
safety. Those who were arrested will likely be charged for disturbing the peace, resisting arrest or arbitrarily construed mis-

A columnist's summary of his proactive philosophy

What just happened wasn't something out of a civil-rights
movement documentary. It is still happening today in 2003. Last
week in Miami, tens of thousands of protesters converged to
demonstrate against the proposed Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) that is predicted to only further the state of food
insecurity and poverty for many people in Latin American countries. What thousands of these protesters (including several of my
fellow Swatties) found when they arrived in Miami was not a
forum for democracy but a cold police state. Two Why War? members, in particular, were arrested on bogus charges of attempted
burglary before even arriving at the rally. (Charges were filed on
account of their having ropes and climbing equipment in their
car.) While in jail, these Swatties witnessed horrific misconduct
by the police against other fellow protesters. Most specifically, the
Why War? members cited the harassment of anarchists of color
and transgender and queer activists who were held separately
from the other protesters. In one case, the anarchists of color were
placed in "dog cages" and hosed down with cold water while in
jail. Female, queer and transgender protestors also reported cases

of unacceptable sexual harassment.
In cases such as this, we must ask ourselves what the value of
protest and the free exercise of our First Amendment rights has
become and why. At this point in history, if protest has become an
ineffective means of change, it is only because out government
has criminalized those who engage in it. Unfortunately, new legal
niceties such as the PATRIOT Act have only exacerbated the criminalization of those who hold beliefs contrary to those of the government. There has even been a new wave of proposals involving
allowing the FBI to investigate anti-war protestors as terrorists.
Thus, all those who wish for change need to implement all of the
"powers" that democracy grants us. Because of this, the vote, lawsuits and independent media must all be exercised to their full
advantage. Protest will not be fully effective until we take the law
back from those who currently abuse it.

Pan-Africanism is attitude. It is Negro proaction.
It is Afrocentric perspective. The Pan-African is no
mere organization man. He is a guerrilla, in the
Americas, a Maroon. He thinks for himself, through
to his own conclusions. He rejects dogma in favor of
dialectics. He philosophizes.
Regarding philosophy, "show, don't tell" is the
proper method. As first-person narratives designed
to provoke thought, philosophical treatises are dramatic monologues, when they aren't, as in Plato, dramatic dialogues. Philosophy is high drama, between
heroes and villains, or, to take it beyond good and
evil, between protagonists and antagonists of various
worldviews.
Ministers of information tell the Truth. I show my
truths. Indoctrinators tell what to think. I show how
I think. Sophists give answers. I raise questions. I
deal in inquiry, not instruction.
Philosophy is literally "the love of wisdom," but I
prefer to think of it as "the art of wonder." I don't
care if my reader agrees with me. I only care that he
wonders about what I say. I only care that my essays
provoke his wonderment about, and his further
inquiry into, the perspectives and truths of Negroes
in America, of Pan-Africa.

Easing finals stress

torres

The end of the semester
can make life at Swarthmore
seem pretty awful. Between
writing last-minute papers
and cramming for finals,
Swatties are more stressed
out for these two weeks than
they are at any other time in
the semester. Given this reality in tandem with the difficult

nature of Swarthmore courses in general, one would think
that the college would do
everything within reason to
make this time as pleasant

RANDY GOLDSTEIN

and convenient for students
Bursting the Bubble
as possible. Unfortunately,
there are still a number of
potential
changes
whose
implementation could result in a significant quality-of-life
improvement during this demanding time.

Swarthmore's finals policies do not afford students every
possible advantage in achieving academic success. The problem begins with reading period, the time between the end of
classes and the beginning of final exams. Our reading period
is only two days long, compared with Amherst's three days
and Williams' four days. A student whose finals all fall within the first few days of finals period would be hard pressed to
find the time to adequately prepare for all of them.
If the college is hesitant to extend reading period for fear
of ending the semester later than necessary, there is at least
one fairly easy solution. Why are there no exams scheduled
for Sunday, Dec. 14? Assuming that this is not for religious
reasons, perhaps the college intends this as an implicit time
for students to study. This would be acceptable if it were the
case that all students' exams straddled this day in fairly equal
proportions. Since that is not the case, the college is providing a study subsidy to those students whose finals are scheduled toward the end of finals period. This is in addition to the
benefit they receive by having more free days to study during
the beginning portion of finals period during which they happen to have no exams.
This evokes the issue of finals' scheduling in general.
While students with later finals receive more time to study,

Africana studies: de-centering academics
Dear Editor:
As a white student, I am writing to support the creation of a black studies department and major at
Swarthmore.
In an editorial published in your last issue
("Integrate Africana," Nov. 20, pg. 18), it was expressed
that the creation of an Africana studies department
"legitimizes Eurocentric viewpoints in the rest of academia; it establishes studying Africana perspectives as a
peculiar, separate form of
academia. It lumps all of m^^^^mm^^^^^^^^m

thought is stifling and oppressive. Do we not "lump

European philosophy in the

name it as such? Couldn't we
consider a philosophical tradition emerging from the

who provided the

of a capitalist system which has caused the massive historical genocide of people of color
"unconventional"?
As white people, we perpetuate a racist institution if
we do not work to de-centerthe prevalence of white studies here. In his weekly columns, which build on PanAfricanist themes, Taylor has been positively moving
the discussion at Swarthmore for a long time. His points
are well taken and necessary. It is time that we follow
suit. By helping to create an Africana studies department, white students begin the process of creating a true
anti-racist curriculum and liberated community.

because of their superior breadth."
Across from this editorial, one encountered Taru
Taylor's column ("Fabian Capitalism for the free Negro"
Nov. 20, pg. 19). Taylor argued that Booker T
Washington established an economic framework so that
black people could enter a capitalistic system based on
the European philosophical notion of "life, liberty, and
estate," where estate included the slaves which made
this "capitalist" economy tick. Washington was trying to
develop a firm economic base for black people in order
to build a place within a system of white supremacy and
white thought, which has linked philosophy and politics

to a continuing economic and social reality of exclusion
and oppression.
Is it not ironic that, at Swarthmore, if I want to study

while if I want to study African philosophy I am forced
to seek out tidbits of thought scattered among a variety

students with earlier finals may derive utility from being able
to leave campus earlier. Because students value these benefits differently, it seems that there should be some degree of
flexibility in scheduling finals. My own finals are scheduled
for two p.m. on Dec. 17,18 and 19 and I would sure like to have
them pushed forward. While there is a legitimately large
amount of planning and organization that goes into finals
preparation, it would be nice if the college could at least consider student input to some degree.

Aside from the problems associated with the scheduling of
finals, there are issues that could be addressed concerning
access to and quality of other campus resources. For instance,
it is an extremely difficult task to find an open public area
computer in McCabe or Beardsley during exam period. Many
students rely on these computers to finish assignments that,
for a variety of reasons, cannot be finished in their dorm
rooms. It is extremely frustrating to be unable to find a computer with the knowledge that there are locked classrooms
full of computers in Trotter, Kohlberg and other buildings.
Why not open some of these classrooms as temporary public
computing areas? This would be a relatively easy #ay to provide a resource that, during finals, is highly in demand.
Lastly, the college should extend the hours of availability
of services that are especially necessary to students during
finals. First, McCabe should be open significantly later. One
extra hour is marginal at best. The eccentricities of Swatties
are varied and many of us prefer to study late into the night.
Having an available venue in which a student is able to do his
or her best work is especially important when an upcoming
exam determines half of a final grade. Second, the coffee bar
should also extend its hours. Caffeine fuels students whose
workloads force them to forgo sleep for studying. Longer
Kohlberg Coffee Bar hours would be a welcome benefit to
these tired souls.
The potential changes suggested in this column are not
whimsical or impractical. They are simple adaptations to a
stressful time that would demonstrate to students that the college is genuinely concerned with maximizing the quality of
life on campus. If these changes could help even a few students avoid the stress and anxiety that can accompany the.
end the semester, then they would surely be worthwhile.

Hopefully, we're well on our way. In my final column of the
semester, I would like to seriously broach the topic of the college
car co-op. I advocate a Swarthmore students' car cooperative out of
the dichotomous feeling of my first two years on campus: exuberance about using public transit and walking, along with the frustration of feeling trapped on campus when I periodically became
desperate to get off campus for a hike, a public meeting or just to

is not yet an official college car cooperative in existence most
car-sharing can be found in cities with good public transportation
where cars are only needed for the occasional excursion. There are
several in Eugene, Portland and Corvallis, Oregon, one in San
Francisco and one is starting up in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The car co-op proliferates mostly in Western Europe and
Canada, with the People's Car Co-op in Kitchener, Ontario the best
known in North America, founded in 1998 by ten friends who
shared a car, which has grown to non-profit organization status
with 73 members and five cars. Members pay a flat fee for registration and a yearly membership cost and then get billed for use of
the car by the hour, with discounts for longer trips. Therefore, it's
only a lot cheaper if your membership to the co-op is in lieu of owning and maintaining your own car. (Some insurance companies
have special rates for car co-ops, but this would be the obvious difmembers might be forced to scrutificulty with a college co-op
nize potential members' driving records and even grades, which
can often earn an insurance discount.) In addition to creating a
convenient and affordable service, the essential goal is giving up
personal cars to get superfluous cars off roads, lots and driveways.
Practically speaking, a person calls up and then immediately
can pick the car up from a central location. Among the PCC's goals
are to provide good transportation that is affordable for lowincome people, to encourage people to give up individual car ownership, to use low-emissions, fuel-efficient vehicles, to support
o'l'ner co-ops and to educate the public about the "political and economic advantages of the locally-based, cooperative model".
So, this idea has as its target audience the adventuresome, carless under-21 If you don't get cabin fever, then an evening in Philly
via SEPTA or the Philly shuttle would do the trick. If you're 21,
apparently one can rent a car for $lO a day at Enterprise in Morton.
And maybe, if you were really so bold, you'd just bribe someone
into lending you their car or just hitchhike. But, as far as I can tell,
most Swatties' cars sit between painted lines, waiting to get stuffed
with books and comforters and folding closets at the end of the
semester. If you've read this far, you must share my goal of taking
cars off the road, and that's the main reason car sharing makes
sense at college—because we're idealistic enough to make sacrifices to do what's right, especially if it's financially convenient and
we have someone willing to pick us up to help haul at the end of the
semester. As for traveling to and from school during breaks, that's
what the Daily Jolt's "ride board" is for. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm ready to meet these challenges. I'm going to keep eating and try

Lucky underwear, protein shakes and smacking your

has a tradition or a routine to follow before a game, but
rituals aren't the sole means of psyching one up for competition. Without music, the team intensity is flat, and
there is nothing to cover up that awkward silence when
you can hear yourself panting through the warmup
sprints. Be it "Eye of the Tiger" or "Cotton-Eyed Joe,"
every team needs that one song to put a blaze in its eyes.
Beyond that, each individual needs a spark from Montel

know that before a volleyball game, 50 Cent
and Lil' Kim are in my ears, rapping "Magic Stick." From
there, my CD blasts Sublime's "Pool Shark" and eventually finishes with Billy Joel saying goodbye to Hollywood.
While I consider my compilation of songs perfect, my
teammates rarely join me in the chorus of "Moondance"
(track four on the masterpiece mix). If Van Morrison is

mixes had the normal kind of getup music on them."
Surbhi Gupta 'O4, badminton: "[The badminton team
doesn't] really have much of an opportunity to play music,
since we are usually playing in the Field House, unless we
brought a boom box. It's a very one-on-one type of sport.
Even when we are warming up, there is a lot of interaction, so no one really listens to music."
Joe DeSimone 'O4, men's lacrosse: "Last year [the

Cheryl Nunes 'O7, women's soccer: "I really like
Madonna's 'Like a Prayer.' Our team had a really strange
mix this year. 'What would Brian Boitano Do?' from South

some rock, some rap. It was a really diverse mix."
There is, of course, no universal mix tape to please
everyone. Someone will always complain about (and
someone will always rock out to) Beethoven's "Ode To

Bet on the Lakers
It's only one month into the 2003-04 basketball season and things are
already starting to take shape. Before I offer my analysis, I'm going to
assure you that, unlike my NFL predictions (which I could have nailed
had I set aside my burning love for the god-awful Redskins), I'm not
going to go making bold predictions that the Wizards are going all the
way. Heck, nobody even expects them to make the playoffs. Except, of
course, me. And maybe Ben Wharton. What's not to like about the
Wizards? The Cancer Known As Michael Jordan is finally gone. We've
got new management and a new coach
(and a black one at that). We've got a former number one pick in Kwame Brown;
we've got athletes who run a fast-paced
game, and our starting lineup is the
youngest in the league. For the first time
in years, we signed a high-profile free
agent in Gilbert Arenas. You might wonder how we lured him to Washington.

Well, we didn't. Gilbert flipped a coin
between Washington and Golden State,
and it landed eight out of 10 times for
Golden State. So he decided to sign with
the Wizards and promptly declared we
were going to make the playoffs this
year. Doesn't make sense to you? Well, it
CARLTON DAVIS
doesn't to me either.
I'm not going out on a limb here by
Rounding
predicting the Wizards are going to the
playoffs. Currently, we're 6-10, good
enough for one game out of the hunt. Our
best player has been on the bench all year, with our second-best player
hurt the last several games. The Eastern Conference might as well be
considered the minor leagues of the NBA. At my deadline, the Pacers sit
atop the conference at 14-3, followed by Detroit at 12-6 and New Orleans
at 11-6. All other teams are .500 or worse. That's five playoff teams from
the Eastern Conference with records that aren't even above .500! The last
time that happened, players were still shooting into peach baskets.
For what it's worth, Sports Illustrated (yeah, I know they have no clue
how to predict how teams will fare) ranks only two Eastern Conference
teams, New Jersey and Detroit, among the top nine in the NBA. This
should come as no surprise to anyone, as many experts would agree.
Since the Chicago Dynasty ended, the Western Conference has won the
last five NBA Finals, with no Eastern Conference team even winning
more than two games. The most dominating players in the game
(Duncan, Shaq, KG and Nowitzki) are all in the Western Conference. The
highest scoring teams in the league are in the Western Conference.
Simply put, the Eastern Conference is boring.
The team to beat right now is clearly the Lakers. Sure, the whole Kobe
controversy surrounds the team. His trial is next month, and who knows
how he and his teammates will react? (Boy, did I blow it drafting him in
the first round of my fantasy league.) But the Shaq-Kobe marriage right
now .is working out beautifully. Looking to add to their three titles,
they've put their preseason quarrels behind them and seem happy sharing their points and gaudy stats with each other as well as free-agent
signees Karl Malone and Gary Payton. The 14-3 Lakers have been blowing people out early and often, allowing them to tap into their bench to
gain their backups valuable experience. They haven't lost at home and
last weekend demolished the Eastern Conference-leading Pacers by 22
points. If I were a betting man (and I've been known to toss a couple'
bucks around here and there), I'd put my money on the Lakers.
The defending champion Spurs are a bit hobbled, as Tim Duncan has
already missed several games with a bum ankle that continues to bother
him. Though Manu Ginobli poses an outside threat for the Spurs, Tony
Parker and Rasho Nesterovic likely won't be able to lead the team
through the playoffs. The Kings are a solid and deep team that have
played itself to a 12-4 record thus far without its best player, Chris
Webber. They have been tough the last several years, and there is no reason to think they won't go deep into the playoffs again this year. The
Mavericks acquired both Antoine Walker (my second round pick -what
a disaster he's been so far) and Antawn Jamison in the offseason and are
off to an 11-6 start. Despite their potent offensive attack, however, the
Mavs have no clue what the word "defense" means.
Although Denver (yes, those very same Nuggets who finished with
the third worst record last year) and Utah have jumped out to strong
starts, one team to watch out for is the Timberwolves. For years, Kevin
Garnett has had to carry the team on his shoulders. In the offseason,
he was given Sam Cassell (my solid third round pick) and Latrell
Sprewell to surround him. The three are still learning to mesh together, and the addition of Wally Szczerbiak from injury will provide even
another offensive boost. If Sprewell doesn't choke (a la PJ Carlissimo)
come playoff time, I would anticipate a Wolves-Lakers showdown in
the Western Conference Finals. It doesn't matter who comes out of the
East. They'll get slaughtered worse than a dissident under Saddam's

Third

regime.

I wish you all luck during your exams, and enjoy your month off.

Men's swimming defeats McDaniel by a hair
First-place finishes in last two events secure Tide a 48-47 CC victory over McDaniel
BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
Men's swimming has been holding its own so far this

season. The weekend before Thanksgiving the Garnet
traveled to McDaniel for a very exciting match that ended
up coming down to a close finish. Swat could capture the
last two events of the meet to get a 48-47 win and bring its
conference record to 2-1.
The meet came down to the 200 breaststroke and the
400 freestyle relay. If the Garnet were able to pull those off,
the team would find itself victorious. Eric Shang 'O4
proved able to do just that, as he won the 200 breaststroke
in 2:19:26, with Swat's Andrew Koczo 'O7 placing third.
This put the Garnet within striking territory at 47-41 with
only the 400 freestyle relay left to decide the victor.

Swat was able to pull through in the relay event as
well, recording a time of 3:28:15, finishing ahead of
McDaniel by 4.15 seconds. The freestyle squad of
Johnathon Augat 'O7, Andrew McKay 'O7, Aaron Modic 'O4
and Jason Horwitz 'O7 swam to victory, leading wire to
wire to give Swat the meet. The mostly first-year team
made it clear how talented the latest additions to the
Garnet are.

The meet started out well for the Tide, with solid showa few events before McDaniel started to mount a
comeback. The 400 medley relay team of Adam Morris 'O6,

Kaena Horowitz 'O6, Modic and Aron Dobos 'O6 started

Swat in the right direction, winning in a time of 4:19.96.
Anders Taylor 'O7 continued the strong start with a victory in the 300 freestyle with a time of 1:55.17, putting the
Garnet ahead 16-9. But McDaniel stormed back, winning

"It was one of the most exciting
meets I've ever been to. The team

great swims, and it came down to

the last event."
Adam Morris 'O6
the next six events to take the lead at 44-35. The string of
first-place finishes only made the Garnet hungrier for victory as it fought back to win the two final events of the
meet.
Head coach Sue Davis made it clear how important the
final two events of the McDaniel meet were. "Every event,
every swim counts, but at McDaniel it became evident
that the 200 breast stroke and the 400 freestyle relay would

count more than the rest," Davis said. "We had to prevent
them from winning the breast stoke and from getting second or third in that event, and if we could do that we had
to win the [4OO freestyle] relay. Everyone was recording
season best times, and I am very proud of them. They

pulled it off."
Morris agreed with Davis. "It was one of the most exciting meets I've ever been to." Jokingly, he added, "After a
three hour bus ride, the last thing you want to do is get
into a pool and try to swim fast. The five-lane scoring system that McDaniel uses doesn't favor a team with the
depth of Swarthmore, so we were at a slight disadvantage.
The team came together, we had some really great swims
and it came down to the wire, but we pulled out a win in
the last event."
The Garnet's meet at Division II Kutztown proved less
successful two days before Thanksgiving. Swat lost 120-76
to fall to 2-3 this season. There were some bright spots
though, notably Brian Rose's performance. Rose 'O6 won
the 200 breaststroke in 2:29.45. Victory was also achieved
in the 400 freestyle relay with another strong group of
first-years, and an upperclassman to win the relay in
3:31.56. Anders Taylor 'O7, Shang, Horwitz, and McKay
came together to show some strength at what was otherwise a lackluster meet.
Swarthmore men's swimming returns to the pool this
Saturday when Albright visits the Garnet for a 2p.m.
meet.

Athletes make difficult
decision to study abroad

going abroad has

Leaving school and

always been

a celebrated option of the

Swarthmore experience. By and large, students are free to leave campus and travel the
world at their discretion. But the option to
travel abroad presents a dilemma for most athletes at Swarthmore, especially those who are
faced with the decision to either travel abroad
or miss their athletic season.
The decision to play the season or go abroad
is a vexing one, but it
is still a manageable

he said. "When I come back, I'll still have two

spring semester."

While the spring semester caters to students going abroad and thus puts spring athletes in tough spot, academics and the availability of specialized programs also weigh
heavily in the decision to leave campus.
"I had been planning on taking a semester

off for a while," runner Elizabeth Gardner 'O5
said. "It just turned out this was the best time
for me to go with the program I'm in. It was a
hard decision, because I love running track so
much, but I really needed to expand my horizons in French."
"Track is my forte, and I've been running
since sixth grade, but, since I'm a math major
I kind of had to go this spring to be able to fulfill all the academic requirements and still do
everything I want to do," Gardner said. "The
decision is definitely a well made one and I
won't regret it, but I will miss running."
Not only is choosing to go abroad a
hard decision for athletes, but it also has
profound effects on
coaches as well, forcing them to fill holes
they wouldn't have
otherwise had.
"It's very difficult
for a coach to accept,
because we always
want to put the best

product on the field," baseball coach Frank
Agovino said. "All coaches want to win, but in
the end if it's best for the kid, I support that,
and I think all the coaches here really support
an athletes decision to go abroad."
While a good number of athletes do choose
to go abroad, the vast majority of them decide
to schedule their trips around their seasons,
even if it might cost them the opportunity of
enrolling in a unique program. "If you play a
sport here, and it's a high priority on your list
you'd probably rather stay than go abroad,"
defender Tom Madore 'O6 said, who is considering going abroad the spring semester of his
junior year
after soccer season is over.
"Leaving can put you in jeopardy with the
team, get you out of place with team chemistry.
Also, coach wouldn't be too happy either."

Happy Thanksgiving
For some people, Thanksgiving means football. For this particular sports columnist, it does not. Allow me to explain. But first, a little background. I'm from Baltimore. But I don't have Thanksgiving
in Baltimore. I have Thanksgiving in Greensboro, N.C V because
that's where the Wharton ancestral home is and where Uncle Buzzy
lives. So why no football on Thanksgiving? Because, frankly, the
games always suck.
For the uninformed, there are always two NFL games played on

Thanksgiving. One always involves the Detroit Lions and one
always involves the Dallas Cowboys. So there's part of your answer
right there. If you watch the NFL on Thanksgiving, you're either
watching one of the past decade's worst franchises, or a team pretty much everyone outside Texas hates. And the games are nearly
that you say? The games were good this
year? Detroit upset those squeaky clean Packers and the DallasMiami game was a match up between two of the NFL's better teams?
Sure, whatever. I wouldn't have known it. The TV wasn't on at

always bad. But what's

Uncle Buzzy's house.

It hasn't always been this way.
The past three or four years, the
games have been on in the den. And
every year, invariably, they've
sucked. But I would always watch
them anyway, since I'm an idiot. So
this year, there was no football. And
no one missed it. Instead, after the
requisite mingling and hugs, we sat
down to turkey and trimmings.
Turkey, not turducken. I am not a
religious man, but some things are
sacred. Turkey on Thanksgiving is
one of them. The Whartons firmly
BEN WHARTON
eating
turkey
endorse
on
Thanksgiving, not some mutant sixlegged combo-fowl. Take your
chicken inside a duck inside a
turkey and feed it to the Detroit
Lions and Dallas Cowboys.
OK, time for a confession. There is one football game that I do
watch on Thanksgiving. That game is the Egg Bowl, the annual
match up between Ole Miss and Mississippi State played every
Thanksgiving evening. Why? Because Thanksgiving is usually the
only time I see Uncle David and he's a professor at Ole Miss. So this
game is big to him. This year's game was a lopsided blowout, with
Ole Miss rolling to a 31-0 victory. But it was good to watch while in
a turkey stupor.
So for one day a year, college football trumps professional football in my book. But one sport trumps them both. That sport is
bocce. For the sadly ignorant, bocce is sort of like lawn bowling. Its
played on a hard, level rectangular surface made of packed dirt,
clay, and sand, enclosed in short wooden walls. You play by rolling
or tossing your balls at a smaller target ball. The point is to get your
balls closer to it than the opponent can get his or her balls. Its really pretty simple. The Wharton family bocce tournament takes place
the day after Thanksgiving. This year's tournament was suitably
wild and woolly. After an inscrutable process involving coin flips,
Uncle David had the teams set. The "Ben-Dad" team would play the
"Uncle David-Granddad" team on court one, while the "Brother
Jesse-girlfriend Cheng" team would play the "Mom-aunt Marianne"
team on court two. The winners would then play a championship as
the losers played a loser game to avoid abject misery.
"Ben-Dad" got off to a flying start befitting their youthful comportment and went up 7-0 early. Games are to twelve. But that would
be all the scoring we would do in that game. We managed to give up
our seven point lead and lose 12-7. It was like some bocce version of
the Grady Little and Steve Bartman Show this last fall. Meanwhile,
despite Mom's trash talking, "Brother Jesse-girlfriend Cheng" massacred "Mom-Aunt Marianne" 12-3, causing Mom to tell Girlfriend
Cheng this would be the last Thanksgiving she would be spending
with the Whartons. Wild and woolly, to say the least.
So the stage was set for the epic championship between "Uncle
David-Granddad" and "Brother Jesse-Girlfriend Cheng." And epic
it was. Scoring proceeded exclusively by ones and twos, in a game
where field goals and grand slams are commonplace. I'm pretty sure
the game was tied 9-9 at one point. With the game on the line, Mom
pulled yet another semi-legal trick out of her repertoire and somehow subbed in for Granddad. I probably don't have to tell you that
she tossed two career-defining shots, both scoring the winning
points and setting up a block of Girlfriend Cheng's last chance
heave.
So, yeah, I had a good Thanksgiving. After all, bocce and turkey
beat football and turducken any day of the year.

Jen Stevenson, shown making a layup in Monday's victory over Ursinus, has stepped it up at point guard.

Late rally leads to win
Co-captains Wolff, Robinson lead Garnet to win over Urinsus
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore women's basketball team (3-1,1-1)

evened its Centennial Conference record Tuesday
night with a 61-51 victory over Ursinus at the Lamb
Miller Field House. The Garnet Tide opened the 200304 season by winning the Swarthmore Tip-Off
Tournament, but after falling to rival McDaniel in its
conference opener, the Garnet Tide entered Tuesday's
contest needing a win to keep pace with the conference's other top teams.
With 5:12 remaining in the second half, UC junior
Liz Munn capped an 8-1 Bear run with a three-pointer
from the corner to give Ursinus a 51-48 lead. Rather
than call a timeout, Swarthmore coach Adrienne

Shibles subbed in co-captains Alison Wolff 'O5 and
Katie Robinson 'O4. Robinson and Wolff hit back-toback field goals to give Swarthmore a lead they would
never relinquish. As the Garnet Tide rallied, the
Bears crumbled, committing three costly turnovers in
the final four minutes of play, while missing their last
five field goal attempts.
"It was a big win for us. Hopefully, it will carry us
into the weekend," Wolff said. "It was a really good
team effort. We hit the shots when it counted. We
were kind of in a slump in the first half, but we turned
it around in the second. Even when we went down, we
didn't throw the towel in." Wolff led Swarthmore for
much of the night, scoring a career-high 16 points to
go along with seven rebounds, three assists and two
blocked shots.
After center Radiance Walters 'O6 expanded the
Garnet Tide lead to three points on a layup with 2:33

24

to play, Zoey Adams-Deutsch 'O6 sealed the game, hitting five of six free throws and collecting two
rebounds and a steal in the final minutes.

The Bears battled Swarthmore throughout the second half, building up a six-point lead with under 16
minutes to play. The Garnet Tide fought back but
were unable to build a lead of more than four points
until the final minute of play. There were six lead
changes in just the final 11 minutes, but despite the
back and forth nature of the game, coach Shibles elected not to use a timeout over that stretch, instead trusting her players to rally the team to victory. "Our shots
weren't always falling, but I was impressed with our
composure down the stretch," she said. "I was just
very impressed. This was a good team that we beat

tonight."
Just four games into their schedule, Swarthmore
has already had to face adversity. The Garnet Tide lost
starting point guard Ali Furman to graduation last
year. Entering this season, coach Shibles looked to last
year's backup Debbie Farrelly to take over the point
guard duties. However, Farrelly developed a stress
fracture during preseason, and the team was forced to
scramble to find a new point guard. During the Tip-Off
Tournament, Adams-Deutsch and Jen Stevenson 'O6
shared ball handling responsibilities, but after scoring
15 points to go along with four rebounds and four
assists in the tournament final, Stevenson was able to
win the job outright, and Adams-Deutsch went back to
her traditional forward role.

come as a surprise. We all know she has the talent
