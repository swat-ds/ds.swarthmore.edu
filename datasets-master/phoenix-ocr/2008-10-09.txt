Sustainability on campus found lacking
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY AMELIA

POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu

"Anywhere else it wouldhave been an A"
a popular slogan that appears on some official college merchandise

now holds true for Swarthmore's environmental record as
well as its notoriously deflationary grading policies. For the
third year in a row, the college received a grade of B- from
the College Sustainability Report Card. This sub-par rating
has caused some members of the college community to question Swarthmore's commitment to sustainability.
According to Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l,
Swarthmore's sustainability rating was not updated this
year because the college declined to respond to the annual
questionnaire distributed by the College Sustainability
Report Card, an initiative supported by the Sustainable
Endowments Institute. "I suppose that what the grade
reflects is that we didn't really undertake to answer their
survey because I don't think we necessarily believed that
this was something useful to do, and it wasn't a way of
addressing the issues," Eldridge said.
Michael Roswell 'll, a member of Earthlust, said that the
college should not be so quick to dismiss external ranking
indicators and might actually benefit from prioritizing ratings like the College Sustainability Report Card. According
to Roswell, the B- grade is a surprisingly accurate reflection
of the college's sustainability record, even if the methodology used to compile the Report Card is not scientifically rigorous. "It is indicative, if not reliable," Roswell said. "The
outside world is a good thing to push the college." Among the
fifteen institutions that received grades of A- were Williams
and Middlebury, two colleges that compete with
Swarthmore for applicants. The college's conspicuous
absence from the A-list of sustainable schools could reflect
poorly on Swarthmore when environmentally conscious
high school students submit their applications this winter.
According to Roswell, it is no longer a question of
whether the college needs to change its approach to sustainability; it is a matter of how and when. Several student, faculty and staff groups have already been brainstorming ideas
about how the college can change to reduce its carbon footprint.

Roswell is a member of the recently formed
Sustainability Committee, a group of students, faculty and
staff charged with generating recommendations to convey to
the 2020 budgetary planning committee. "The committee's
job as a whole is not so much at this point to be a generator

of ideas as to be the conduit," Roswell said. To this end, the
committee has already placed a suggestion box, the "green
box," in Parrish as well as an electronic version on the student and faculty dashboards. The box has already yielded a
number of constructive suggestions, ranging from concerns
over a perpetually switched on light fixture to more substantial suggestions for overhauling the college's long-term

approach to sustainability.
After a few preliminary meetings, the committee has
already produced the framework of a long-term strategy that

consists of'a cohesive, broad-based program of sustainability, a program that would necessarily include policy, curriculum and operations components," according to
Engineering professor and Sustainability Committee cochair Carr Everbach.
Everbach discussed this vision with colleagues during a
recent faculty lunch. He also shared more concrete recommendations for change, such as strengthening the college's
Environmental Studies program, giving out sustainability
information during orientation and outfitting LPAC with a
green roof.
"During the Great Depression, did Swarthmore turn
inward?" Everbach asked. Continuing along the same vein,
he drew comparisons between contemporary environmental
issues intellectual movements such as the Enlightenment,
Newtonian physics and democratic theory. With these measures he sought to impart upon his peers the relevance and
urgency of environmental issues and to rally them behind
the cause.
Toward the end of the lunch, Everbach assured his peers,
"This is not a top down issue with the faculty pushing the
students." In fact, it is quite the opposite. Last week,
Earthlust was collecting signatures for a petition urging the
administration to get the college to use 100 percent of the
energy budget for the purchase of wind power credits. Their
efforts culminated in a rally on Friday to show student support for the petition.
The college already purchases some wind power credits,
but this does not mean that the college directly taps wind
turbines to run campus utilities. Electricity is generated in
different ways, from wind turbines to coal-fueled power
plants; whatever the source of the electricity, it is all conveyed through the same power grid. Because of this, it is
impossible to attribute the electricity used to light classrooms and run computers to a particular power source.
What the college can do is offset its electricity usage with
wind credits. Buying credits, in addition to regular electric-

ity, finances wind farms and gives the developing industry
an opportunity to compete in the national energy market.
"It's a little mind boggling that we're not using more
[wind power]," Jacob Socolar 11 said, an active member of
Earthlust. Haverford has been offsetting 100 percent of their
electricity usage since last year.
Currently Swarthmore holds a $20,000 contract with a
power company that offsets approximately 40 percent of the
college's electricity usage with wind credits, the result of a
2007 Earthlust campaign. The contract is set to expire in
May 2009, and offsetting the same amount of electricity
could cost as much as $BB,OOO if a new contract is drafted.
Also, in the near future paying for regular electricity could
take a more sizeable chunk out of the budget. The
Pennsylvania electricity industry will be deregulated by the
end of 2010, which could result in a 10 to 30 percent increase
in the college's electric bill.
In addition to this enormous financial commitment,
Eldridge identifiedanother problem withthe proposed plan.
"It seems to me that [wind power] is more symbolic thanreal
in terms of its effects on the campus and on how students
here learn and become agents of sustainability themselves."
Ralph Thayer, Director of Maintenance, shared
Eldridge's view that buying wind credits doesn't change the
amount of electricity the college consumes. "If you take that
potential $BB,OOO the we would be putting toward wind energy and put it in energy conservation measures, such as insulating and changing our light schemes, I think it's money
better spent," Thayer said.
Roswell and Jesse Marshall 'll are trying to help the college identify just such opportunities for energy conservation
measures. The two students, as part of their Operations
Research class, are developing a program that they hope
Facilities will use to analyze the efficiency of the, steam
plant. Roswell and Marshall's model will allow the Facilities
staff to identify pieces of equipment in the plant that could
be insulated or replaced in order to maximize overall efficiency.
While no specific measures have been taken to advance
long-term sustainability, Eldridge emphasized that the
administration is taking the issue seriously. "I'm not really
looking to fulfill my sense of pride by way of a national ranking. I'd much rather feel like the Environmental Studies
interdisciplinary program is having a positive effect. I'd like
to feel that Earthlustis doing its job of helping to educate the
community
[The administration] is open to dialogue,"
Eldridge said.

Domestic Abuse Project to collect household supplies for victims
BY CLARISSA SKINNER
cskinnel@swarthmore.edu

The Women's Resource Center is kicking
off Domestic Violence Awareness Month
with a drive to collect household goods for
the Women's Safe-House of Delaware
County. The Domestic Abuse Project, headed by Sophie Hagen 'lO and Amanda
Morrison 11, is organizing the drive.
Morrison explained that the safe-house
constantly has to replenish the supply of
household goods that it distributes to victims of domestic abuse. "The women come to
the shelter with nothing, so when they leave
they take silverware, blankets, cleaning supplies [and other] things they need," she said.
According to Morrison, the safe-house does
not want to restrict access to these vital supplies, so it is constantly in need of additional
materials.
The Domestic Abuse Project, working in
conjunction with the safe-house, aims to
alleviate the shortage of supplies. Its organizers are currently working to collect comforters, towels, sheets and other essential
products. Donation boxes will be placed in
various locations that draw high volumes of
pedestrian traffic in the borough of
Swarthmore.
Because the safe-house functions as a
refuge for female victims of domestic abuse

THE PHOENIX

and their children, the location of the house
cannot be disclosed. The shelter is located
somewhere in Delaware County, but its staff
cannot specify its address to ensure the safety of the women who live there. The shelter
is open to all women for a maximum stay of
thirty days.
According to Hagen, the safe-house provides "childcare, a kitchen, the chance to
talk to other victims, clothes" and other necessary provisions. According to the
Domestic Abuse Project of Delaware County
Web site, the shelter is designed to help
women "become self-sufficient" and eventually "live free from abuse."
Apart from providing housing for the
women, the Project also offers counseling, a
hotline, legal services, medical advice and

educational resources. For low-income
clients, the Project provides welfare advocacy and free emergency services.
Hagen, the founder of the Domestic
Abuse Project at Swarthmore, began the
project after sponsoring a discussion about
domestic abuse during Domestic Abuse
Awareness Month last year. The group's
first project was to establish the safe-house,
which was fully functional within six
months of the Project's founding.
Hagen described the house as having a
kitchen, a dining room and a communal living room, hi addition, there are seven pri-

vate rooms, some of which are in better con-

dition than others. A group of female
Swarthmore students visited the house at
the end of last semester to help renovate
some of those rooms. They first used spackling to fill the holes in the walls, then covered them with a fresh coat of paint.
At the time, a woman and her two children were living in one of the rooms that
needed repainting. After Swarthmore's
Domestic Abuse Project repainted the room,
its residents expressed their gratitude to the
safe-house coordinator.
Hagen said that she would also like to
replace the curtains, and add plants and pictures in order to make the house more
"cheery."
Marie Rousseau 'l2 commended the project for its involvement in communities with
proximity to the Swarthmore campus. "I
think it's awesome that Swarthmore students are cooperating with a local organization to help victims of domestic abuse. It's
really great that the shelter is nearby
[because] students can get so much more

involved in the process. Plus, I think it's
more meaningful to address [the immediate]
community's needs ... rather thanreach out
to people and places that aren't as related to
us," Rousseau said.
Morrison said that the most meaningful
aspect of collaborating with the safe-house

October 9, 2008

has been the outpouring of support from the
Swarthmore borough community. In particular, she commended Charles Devaney,
owner of Swarthmore Hardware, who
'donated almost all of our needed supplies
for free."

Associate Vice President ofFacilities and
Services Stu Hain and Director of
Maintenance Ralph Thayer have both visited the safe-house to help prioritize the most
essential renovations and produce estimates
for supplies and contractors. According to
Morrison, Bernard Devlin of Facilities and
Services conducted a workshop to train the
participating students in basic home
improvement techniques. "[Devlin] met
with the group in an empty house in the village and taught them how to paint, spackle

and sand," Morrison said.
Hagen said that she is interested in pursuing the development of a long-term relationship between the college and the safehouse, one in which Swarthmore will eventually take on the role of "a reliable resource
that the safe-house can fall back on."
Student volunteers said that the experience of helping the safe-house's residents
has been personally empowering as well as a
source of practical life skills. "Sometimes
it's nice to just get paint all over yourself and
to learn how to hang a clock or fix things in
the future," Hagen said.

Bloom to bring liberal arts
to NYU Abu Dhabi campus
BY ALEX ROLLE
arollel@swarthmore.edu

At the beginning of the next school

year, when Al Bloom steps down as
president of Swarthmore College, he

will have the opportunity to oversee
the establishment of a school from its

inception.

Bloom is to become Vice
Chancellor of New York University
Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) and will be leading an effort to create a liberal arts
college, along with graduate and
research programs, in NYU's name in
the United Arab Emirates. The campus will be linked with NYU's New
York campus as well as two other notyet-created campuses to form what
NYU envisions as a truly global university.

According to a BBC News article
"Web Censorship: Correspondents

that says the site is blocked "due to
its content being inconsistent with
the religious, cultural, political and
moral values of the United Arab
Emirates." For similar reasons, some
books have been banned from the
UAE.
Bloom hopes to be a part of creating a "reciprocal" relationship
between the campus and Abu Dhabi.
Just as living in the UAE will have an
impact on students at the college, he
hopes the college will have a positive
effect on the country.
Bloom said that "among issues
studied and discussed at the
University, will certainly be the value
of, and varying approaches to democracy, and the challenge which faces
the U.S. and nations worldwide of
inclusion of foreign workers. The
first step towards a better world is
being able to talk openly about what
that better world should look like and
how best to build it."
In his last year at Swarthmore,
Bloom has had to begin preparing for
his new job while still fulfilling all
the duties of a college president.
According to Bloom, he agreed to
take the position with the understanding that, until next year, his primary
focus
would
still be

According to Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l, Bloom's job performance has not been affected. "He's

College accommodates Muslims during Ramadan
BY ASHIA TROIANO
atroianl@swarthmore.edu

timewhere I can test myself. IfI can fast for this many days,
maybe I can study longer every day and get a much better
grade... Things that seem really hard can get done."
In fact, Idries used that time to really push her own academic limits. "When I got really hungry, I would actually do
the most challenging thing, which was Orgo. Literally at the
peak hour of hunger, I would do chemistry," Idries said. "It
took my mind off of the hunger, and it was some of my best
studying time. I even didflashcards I never did fiashcards
before in my life," she said.
...

Traditionally, Ramadan is a time for Muslims to connect
with their families in the context of religious traditions, but
for Muslim college students, who are sometimes thousands
of miles away from home, that is not always
feasible. However, some colleges and universities
Swarthmore included
have tried to accommodate the
needs of its Muslim students during this month of fasting.
Observance of Ramadan, which took place between Sept.
1 and Sept. 30 this year, is one of the five essential pillars of
Islam. Occurring in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar
year, it requires that each Muslim fast from sunrise to sunset daily and partake in a series of prayers.
On campus, Bond Hall has served as a prayer space, and
for the past two years, Sharpies has provided bagged meals
for Muslim students to eat when they break their fast each
night after sunset. "Swarthmore has been very accommodating during Ramadan. They are currently working on getting halal meat on campus," Ailya Vajid 'O9, a member of the
Muslim Student Association, said in an e-mail. Halal foods
are those that are permissible under Islamic law, which dictates the manner in which livestock can be slaughtered.
At this point in the year, Sharpies often closes before sunset, creating a dilemmafor Muslim students. "Sharpies closes at 7:15 p.m., and this [time of] year, the sun sets at 7:30 p.m.
We didn't ask to extend the hours because it would be pointless just for a month for a small group of students," MSA
member Nabta Idries 10 said.
Essie Mae's, which is open later than Sharpies, is the
only other option for students. "I'm always open-minded to
make sure our students get what they need ifI can manage
with space, of course. But I thinkfor a snack bar, we do very
well," said Augustine Ruhri, director ofEssie Mae's and the
Kohlberg and Science Center coffee bars.
Besides these significant accommodations, there is not
much else that Swarthmore as an institution could do.
According to Idries, "Ramadan is a time of reflecting, being
very disciplined, having self-control, reading the Quran, and
getting as close to God as possible. Those are things the
school can't help with."
RuhullahKhapalwak 'lO described Ramadan as a timefor
enhancing his relationship with the divine. "Most importantly, Ramadan for me is the way of pleasing Allah and
showing our devotion to him," Khapalwak said. "It is a
month during which we, as a Muslim community, share
with and remember those in need."
Idries noted that her Ramadan experience on campus,
while challenging, was very beneficial to her in many ways.
"When I was at home, I wasn't really doing what I was supposed to be doing during Ramadan But in college where
you have so much more control over what you're doing, I
started to focus so much more on my academics. I learned
how to put my priorities in order. I considered Ramadan a
-

...

At the end of Ramadan, the MSA hosts an Eid dinner

serving Middle Eastern and Afghani food to celebrate the
completion of the fast, which is open to all of campus. But
the festivities that come along with the Eid dinner and
even the breaking of the fast every night
can be bittersweet for Muslim students. "It's definitely different to be
practicing alone, or at least without family. During
Ramadan there's no one to wake me up and prepare food,
and there's no family to break fast with every night; however, this year I've been very lucky to have friends who came
all the way over to my apartment at 4:30 a.m. to make
omelets and eat pizza with me," Vajid said.
But the struggles of being in the minority can extend further. "Personally, it has always been difficult to fast at Swat
or generally in a country where it is not practiced.
[Tjn
Afghanistan, the working day ends at 1:30 p.m. instead of the
normal 4:30 p.m. or 5 p.m. In some countries people often
sleep during the day and work during the night. I do not
expect to miss classes or work, but afternoon classes are
very difficult, because you are tired and thirsty, and it is difficult to concentrate," Khapalwak said. "Also it is quite sad
to have to go to classes on the first day of Eid, which is
a big religious festival for us the entire Muslim world
is celebrating."
...

something that was imposed on us, so each member of my
family practices differently not the essentials but their
observances and engaging in ritualized forms of it. I like
that, though, because it allowed me to really form my own
relationship with God and really be forced to think about it,
rather than to go through the motions I'd grown up doing,"
Vajid said in an e-mail.
College also presents a unique complexity for Muslim
students accustomed to a different lifestyle. "Swat really
challenged me religiously because it is so much more liberal here. There are so many things that I could do that would
not be in line with my religion," Idries said.
Vajid found ways to weave her religion into her
Swarthmore experience. "Prayer became tougher at first
just because of the schedule and the time I spent in the
library, but over time, I found ways to make religion a very
integrated part of my Swarthmore life, and for the most part,
it's no longer difficult but just daily life," Vajid said.
For Idries at least, being on her own in college has
enabled her to define religion for herself and enhance her
sense of spirituality. "When I didn't have that group around
me telling me, 'You need to pray, you need to pray,' I had to
understand what it means for me personally, why I was
Muslim, what I thought about other religions. I had to
explore my spirituality on my own. That was a very good
thing." Additionally, both Idries and Vajid, who are minors
in Islamic Studies, cite professors as very instrumental in
their Swarthmore careers. "I have the spirituality, but the
professors have given me different ways of thinking about
the religion
critical and scholarly ways to think about it,"
-

Idries said.

MSA serves as a support network for its members,
and this was evident during Ramadan. "For me, the
most important part of Ramadan is the community it
builds. Some friends and I woke up almost every day

before sunrise and ate meals together, and it was really great to do that in solidarity with each other. Iftars
[fast-breaking] was all the better because I got to do it
with friends who were equally as hungry!" Urooj
Khan 'lO said.
Not at all surprisingly, each student goes to college
with a different background and set of experiences
religious as well as secular that serves him or her in
a variety of ways. "In Northern Sudan, the culture is
synonymous with being Muslim. Our traditions are
centered on God. So religion is extremely important in
my family; my mom taught us how to actually do the
prayers because they're very physical, and she
encouraged us to fast for Ramadan," Idries said.
But not everyone shares Idries's background. "My
parents made religion something that was individual
between ourselves and God. They also didn'tmake it

'We're All Mad Here' challenges stigmas
swarthmorephoenix.com

Boxes labeled "We're All Mad Here" have appeared
throughout the Swarthmore campus in the past week as
part of an effort to help Swarthmore students open up to

The organization's members are concerned that students on campus tend to keep personal issues to themselves. Wortmann worries that "people are encouraged to
handle [these issues] on their own," and that, in
Swarthmore's competitive academic environment, there is
"pressure to be functioning at your best 100 percent of the

any mental health issues that may afflict them. Students

are instructed to write their mental health issues on cards
and to deposit the cards in the supplied boxes. The cards
will be displayed in Parrish after Fall Break.
The project is intended to address student stigmatization of the mentally ill and to encourage those in need of
help to seek it. Organizers hope to encourage students
who may not be sure whether their particular issues are
classified as illnesses or not to seek help regardless.
According to Will Hopkins 11, peer counselor for Speak
2 Swatties, the student-run peer counseling group that is
hosting the event on campus, the definition of mental illness "is up to the students to define for themselves...We
want to have as many perspectives about mental health as
we can."
For Fletcher Wortmann 'O9, also a counselor for Speak
2 Swatties, mental health issues are extremely personal,
but in the Swarthmore community, any discussion is "completely ignored." Melissa Cruz 'lO, one of the founders of
Speak 2 Swatties, said, "Mental health issues are about the
only issues that aren't discussed on campus."
Hopkins agreed. "The Swarthmore experience for many
students involves activism," he said, but issues of mental
health are still highly stigmatized. "Many people have misconceptions about mental health issues."

"Mental health issues are about the
only Issues that aren't discussed on
It's something very
campus
personal that we want to bring to
...

the surface."
Melissa Cruz 'O9
The event hopes to address the worry that students may
not know where to go for help. Although students have
access to a variety of different types of peer counselors,
including RAs, CAPS, and Speak 2 Swatties, some student
concerns are so personal that they may not be willing to
speak with anyone about them.
"We're All Mad Here" hopes to address this issue by giving students an anonymous forum to address their mental
health issues.
Hopkins believes the anonymous nature of the event

will make the students feel "more comfortable and safe."
The display will be unveiled immediately following Fall
Break, at which point Speak 2 Swatties plans to hold a
meeting addressing mental health issues. "We hope that
people will treat the project respectfully and will treat the
people who participate respectfully," Hopkins said.
Speak 2 Swatties hopes to provide an outlet for students
to share their feelings comfortably and to encourage students to discuss such issues.
"We hope to get a dialogue going about this huge issue
that affects a good proportion of people here, including
staff and students," said Cruz. "It's something very personal that we want to bring to the surface."
Breaking the silence about struggles with mental
health may not be easy. Many students at Swarthmore
seem unaware that this project is going on. Tomorrow is
the last day for students to submit cards, and some members of Speak 2 Swatties worry that there will be few completed cards.
This is the first year that the event is being held, and
signals Speak 2 Swatties' goal to have a more prominent
role on campus in advocating for mentalhealth awareness.
This is the "first year anyone has done anything like this,"
Wortmann said.
Students can still fill out the cards for "We're All Mad
Here" at designated boxes in Parrish, Kohlberg, McCabe,
the Science Center, Tarble and the peer counseling center
located in Upper Tarble in rooms 308 and 312.

and universities around the country, including Princeton
University, Syracuse University, The College of William and Mary,
Columbia University and New York University. Seven teams from
Swarthmore were present. Two of these teams advanced past the
"heat" rounds and one pair won the tournament.
Linnet Davis-Stermitz 'l2 and Jessica Deutsch 10 were the winning pair. Although Davis-Stermitz debated in high school for four
years, Deutsch is a relative newcomer who began debating competitively just this year.

Although they did not advance to the semifinals, Crawford was
pleased with his team's performance.
"As novice debaters we are still learning the ropes on the APDA
(American Parliamentary Debate) circuit. We both debated different
styles in high school and learning this new style has been a challenging transition. Over the two days we debated in six rounds of
competition," Crawford said. "We faced a team from Columbia in
our final preliminary round and then immediately after in the quarterfinals. Even though we lost, both rounds were both fought incredibly hard, but unfortunately some days you just don't get the win."
A round in the tournament consists of two teams debating a
"case" proposed by the team representing "the government" which
is opposed by the "opposition." Cases included abolishing rent control in New York City and abolishing campaign finance reform. In
the final round, Davis-Stermitz and Deutsch proposed to abolish
closed groups on college campuses because they interfere with the
promotion of diversity.
Davis-Stermitz said he was impressed with the competition and
grateful for the support of the Swarthmore crew's more experienced
varsity members.
"There were a lot of really good judges from Columbia and
William and Mary. Those schools train their members really well. I
think that we benefitted a lot from the help of the varsity teams,"

Davis-Stermitz said.
Crawford agreed with his teammate's assessment. "The varsity
debaters volunteered their time to work with all the

Sleep deprivation plagues students, grades
BY ERICA BREUNLIN
THE MARQUETTE TRIBUNE (MARQUETTE U.)
(U-WERE)
Most every morning, Natalie Wojcik
drags herself to Starbucks for her usual tall white
mocha. It's not so much to start her day as it is to help
her get through it.
Like countless college students, Wojcik, a Marquette
University senior in the College of Arts & Sciences, all
too often faces the perils of sleep deprivation. But apart
from the typical fatigue and exhaustion, experts are now
linking deprivation to dwindling academics.
"Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is key to
overall health in general," said Amy Melichar, coordinator of Marquette's Center for Health Education and
Promotion. "Sleep deprivation over time could lead to
impaired judgment, lapses in class, during tests and in

concentration."
Melichar said that while it depends on the person,
lack of sleep most notably makes information harder to
retain, which easily increases difficulties for overwhelmed students. Wojcik in particular struggled with
grades her freshman year when studying well past midnight became a normal part of her schedule.
"I had this idea that when you're in college, you're not
supposed to go to sleep before 2 a.m.," Wojcik said. Her
GPA fell that year to its lowest average
much of which
she attributed to a lack of sleep.
She has since learned how crucial sleep is to succeeding both in and out of the classroom, and now aims for
the eight solid hours each night that experts recommend.
"One of the hardest parts about college is learning you

need sleep to do well in class," Wojcik said. "But I think
people don't get sleep because they're trying to do well in
class, and it has a reverse effect on them."
Melichar said sleep loss can further lead to a variety
of illnesses, as it depresses the immune system and
impacts stress.
This has proved to be routine for Lisa Klancnik, who
between nursing classes and Reserve Officers' Training
Corps barely scrapes five hours of sleep a night. She's
now battling to stay on top of it all with the added bonus
ofmononucleosis.

"I fall asleep in class every single
class. I've run myself down so much
from not sleeping and being so
stressed and tired."
Lisa Klancnic

while others like College of Arts & Sciences senior
Nicolle Nolen must chew gum or resort to caffeine.
But caffeine contains its own reverse effect.
Melichar said that because caffeine is a stimulant, it
only further diminishes sleep quality. This adds a complication to the balance of sleep and everyday commitments.

The growing concern in adequate sleep prompted the
American College Health Association to modify their
annual student health survey last spring and direct more
of their questions toward rest and relaxation.
"The committee that took part in the revision are in
college health," ACHA Research Director Victor Leino
said. "They felt we needed to increase the sleep items as
well as other areas. Essentially we tried to update the
survey to reflect emerging issues in college health."
Answers to the questions revealed that sleep difficulties remain the third greatest impediment to academic
performance, following stress and illness.
To correct this, a routine sleeping pattern proves to be
the best solution.
"For college students, consistency is key," Melichar
said.

"I fall asleep

in class-every single class," said
Klancnik, a freshman in the College of Nursing. "I've run
myself down so much from not sleeping and being so

stressed and tired."
Other students feel the struggle to stay awake in class
just as heavily. College ofBusiness Administration freshman Johnny Hennessy finds the only way he can keep on
track is to participate in discussion as much as possible

If a student pulls an all-nighter, they should go to bed
at their normal time the next night to get back on track.

Students can also consult Student Health Service or
the Counseling Center for issues beyond their control.
"Sleep helps college students be alert, refreshed, have
no memory lapses and have enough energy all day,"
Melichar said, emphasizing active roles in health. "We
know full well that it's hard for college students, but
sleep is just as important as eating well and exercising."

Anti-Obama shirts draw backlash Boards use Facebook
BY BROOKE LEIN
THE BATTALION (TEXAS
A&M)
(U-WIRE)
Controversy arose when
Texas A&M students began
sporting T-shirts favoring
presidential candidate John

McCain that had "Beat the
Hell Outta Obama," printed
on them.
Since
the
T-shirts
appeared on the shelves of
Aggieland Outfitters and
Inspirations, they have
been criticized by students
who argued that the apparel was politically charged
and represented Texas
A&M negatively.
The stores have since
started selling shirts that
read, "Beat the Hell Outta
McCain." They have placed
signs in stores to inform
customers that the shirts
are not affiliated with
A&M. "If someone that didn't go to A&M, who was
unaware of Aggie traditions, saw people wearing
these shirts saying 'Beat
the Hell Outta' a specific
person, it might seem
extremely offensive," said
Jeff Brannigan, a senior
political science major.
"And because [Barack
Obama] happens to be
black, it may also seem
extremely racist."
During political seasons,

"We were very careful

said.
"We've already had to place

"It's funny because I
don't think people realize
that 'Beat the Hell Outta' is

can be seen from a distance
is 'Obama,'" said journalism senior lecturer Edward
Walraven.
"So really, people who

Walraven said.

THE MACE & CROWN (OLD
DOMINION UNIVERSITY)
Students do not need to
worry about their Facebook accounts
when applying to graduate school at Old
Dominion University.
A recent survey done by the Kaplan
group showed that 10 percent of college
admissions boards have used a potential
students Internet profile site as part of
the admissions process.
(U-WIRE)

"I don't see how what is
on their Facebook
account says anything on
whether or not a student
is acadmically capable."
Bill Heffelfinger
ODU Assistant director
of Graduate Admissions
This news might be shocking to students who have racy pictures of themselves binge drinking or wearing
revealing clothing pasted to their
Facebook or MySpace accounts.
The survey also showed that one of
five employers check an applicant's
online profile when deciding whether or
not to hire that person.
Twenty-five percent of these employers said this practice had a positive
impact on the decision-making process;
38 percent said it had a negative impact.
Employers conduct the search
because they want to ensure their
organization maintains or improves its

Octobfef 9, 2008

image, and do not want to hire people
who could have a negative impact on
that goal.
Many students who post these kinds
of pictures are unaware of the consequences, and students who are aware do
not think it is an employer's business to
look at their profiles.
They also feel it is a violation of their

privacy.

"I believe that a school is not going
against privacy issues because the
information is readily available on the
Internet," Katie Mills, a history student
at ODU, said. "But they should not look
at it because of gender and sexuality
issues."
"It should also not be a factor in
admitting a student, regardless to what
is on their profile," Mills said. Other
students feel a student should be
responsible for what is or what is not
posted on their profile.
"If they are stupid enough to put that
type of informationon Facebook, they
deserve what they get," said ODU student Allen Matthews Jr.
However, ODU has yet to add student
profiles to the list of criteria used when
deciding whether or not to admit a student to undergraduate or graduate
school.
"I don't see how what is on their
Facebook account says anything on
whether or not a student is academically capable of making in the graduate
program," said Bill Heffelfinger, assistant director of Graduate Admissions at
ODU.
"It is probably better that we don't
look at their profiles, and I don't see
why we would do such a thing," Dr.
Regina Karp, of the Graduate Program
of InternationalStudies at ODU, said. "I
think that what a student does on these
web sites is the business of that particular student."

across a review
of the new CBS
show "The Ex
List." Having
actually watched the pilot episode (once again, in place of
actual work) I decided to read the review, wondering if Ginia
Bellafante could shed any light on the show's bizarre and
unrealistic premise.
She didn't I don't really think it's possible to explain
the reasoning behind a show in which the main character is
told by a psychic that she must find her soulmate (whom she
has apparently already dated) within the next year or else
end up alone. Nevertheless, she did give me something to
think about; the opening sentence ofher review bluntly and
succinctly told me something that I had thought aboutbefore
but had never really been able to articulate.
"Since the mid-1960s the history of single women on television is largely a chronicle of endearing neuroses." I

Shouldn't Carrie take a moment out
of her search for Mr. Right and
focus on, I don't know, the book
she's about to have published?
At first this seems wrong because so many female pro-

tagonists (including several who were name-checked in
Bellafante's review) are presented as successful career
women. Ally Mcßeal is a high-profile lawyer; Carrie
Bradshaw is a successful columnist and author; even
Betty Suarez, the star of an increasingly over-the-top
melodrama based on a telenovela, is an assistant at an
important fashion magazine. Yet, for varying reasons,
none of these women have the dignity and self-confidence that befit their professions. From Carrie falling on
a runway to Ally getting stuck in a toilet to Betty's truly
unfortunate braces and hair, they all act like punch lines
to some sort of cosmic joke: the single woman as laughingstock.
The most worrisome aspect of these shows, however,
isn't the embarrassing slapstick that these beautiful
women are subjected to; it's their constant obsession

with finding a man, getting married and living out some
sort of happily-ever-after. Now, I'm not the sort of radical
feminist who won't allow a date to pay for dinner and
doesn't shave her legs (I'm a broke college student and I
value hygiene, thank you very much), but I do worry
that portraying marriage as the ultimate goal leaves
career success as an afterthought, something that's nice
but isn't nearly as crucial to a woman's happiness as
landing a man. Even Blair and Serena of "Gossip Girl"
worry about getting into college, and they're boy-crazy
teenagers. Shouldn't Carrie take a moment out of her
search for Mr. Right and focus on, I don't know, the book
she's about to have published?
I don't think that Ally Mcßeal was, to paraphrase
"Time," "the death of feminism;" the death of a healthy
body image, possibly, or the death of work-appropriate
attire, but not of feminism. Feminism is still alive and
kicking, and I'm sure Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi
would agree. (Sarah Palin might agree as well, but I really don't think I can associate feminist success with someone who thinks that being able to see Russia from her
house counts as foreign-policy experience. Honestly, I
think that even a lipstick-wearing pig could explain what
)
was wrong with that statement. But I digress
However, Ally and Carrie (and all the voters who think
Hillary is a raving hormonal bitch) demonstrate that
perhaps our society hasn't come as far as we would have
liked. Women don't get equal pay for equal work, we're
called sluts when we express a healthy sex drive and we
have to put up with whiny, self-pitying characters that
are supposed to represent our gender. I personally would
rather be represented by Ripley from "Alien," memorably played by Sigourney Weaver. Ripley was a woman
who knew how to balance family and career. Plus, she
could kill aliens. This actually gives me an idea
I think, come November, that I'm going to vote Ripley

Supernatural exposition of adventure game 'Indigo Prophecy' fails
ing up after

*

JACK KEEFE
[Press Start]

Lucas slinks puppet-like out of a diner
bathroom stall, creeps up behind a middleaged man in a suit peeing in a urinal, and
stabs him twenty-to-thirty times with a
steak knife, spraying blood all over the
bathroom as strange visions play in his
head. "Where am I?" he mutters as he falls
out of the trance ... and realizes what he has
done. Such begins the Xbox adventure game

classic

"Indigo Prophecy,"

an (ultimately

unsatisfying) tale of occult mystery, racial
stereotyping, and blessed incoherence.
The primary draw of "Indigo Prophecy"
is that your decisions in-game have a significant impact on the course of events later
in the plot. This freedom of choice, which
later proves to be largely illusory, does
make for a compelling narrative in the
beginning of the story when your primary
frame is the disturbing murder your protagonist has committed. In the first scene,
you as Lucas are left with the task of cleanTHE PHOENIX

the gruesome murder you have

just committed. Will you spend time trying
to clean up the blood? What are you touching
will that leave prints? Do you remember to pay your check on the way out?
Any clues you leave behind can then be
found if (and only if) you so choose when
the scene shifts to the perspective of the
NYPD detectives tailing Lucas, Carla and
Tyler. It becomes increasingly difficult to
determine what is helping and what is hindering "yoursel[ves]" within the game
world. In the first scene, my friend Chelsea
failed to hide the murder weapon and to pay
Lucas' check at the diner, allowing the
intrepid Carla to lift prints and proffer a
forensic sketch from a waitress while Tyler

harassed a bum in an alleyway. NYPD's
finest in action? I imagine one could find
themselves picking one thread or the other
to favor, puppeting Lucas into leaving more
clues behind than he intended or having
Tyler do all of the investigative work so that
the case falls apart (more on this later), but
that wasn't for me.
While the game's tit-for tat escape and
pursuit is interesting, it is in the supernatural focus of the rest of the exposition that
the game fails. And, oh, does it fail, devolv:

ing into supernatural mumbo-jumbo that

would be more compelling if the narrative
were really suited to focusing on the exact

universal metaphysics.

Unfortunately,

the

metaphysics really just boil down to
"spooky Mayan shit." Lucas' creepy visions
(and some other powers he picks up along
the way) are due to a mysterious McGuffin
energy with a meaningless title. The villains eventually muster to their cause a
wide variety of confusing agents, including
stone angels, an entire insane asylum
(whose caretakers have made the odd
choice of arming them with knives and
other sharp implements), and a blind old

lady who may or may not actually be a
cyborg (!?!).
Sadly enough, the characterization is
also pretty hit-or-miss. On one hand, Lucas
is pretty convincing as he delves further
and further into desperation over the mindwrending horrors he faces in his search for
the truth. However, other game personalities are the victim of such absurd stereotyping that I was caught between ironic
laughter and expressions of utter disbelief.
(I frequently found myself wailing,
"Fraaaancer in a futile attempt to reason
with the developer's nation of origin.)
Carta's partner, Tyler, more or less no matter how you play his segments, is lazy,
incompetent, and obsessed with ogling his
exotified Happa girlfriend who eagerly performs coffee table strip teases for him.
Developer Quantic Dream's attempt to
stereotype Tyler's black ethnic identity
includes an unexpected interlude where he
plays a geeky Jewish cop in a game of "BBall" to settle a $lOO dollar debt that Tyler
was too irresponsible to pay back. Surprise,
surprise, Tyler easily trounces his opponent, though after he thankfully consoles
him by assuring him that he is "pretty D at
B-Ball for a white guy."
Inexplicably, the programmers included
a function where you can replay and replay
this stunning moment in race relations to
your heart's content.
The gameplay mechanics, in the "BBall" scene as much as anywhere else, are
also rather painful. It's an absolute chore to
blunder through a stealth scene in an
engine clearly not built for maneuvering a
psychic ten year old around a military base
(don't ask). The game attempts to be innovative with its control scheme, frequently
forcing you to flick the controller's two joysticks in particular directions as per a
"Simon Says"-esque array in order to sue-

"Simon Says" got old fast. Keeping your
characters alive is also a confusing affair.
Seemingly random objects and interactions
in the world will either add or subtract
from a given character's anxiety meter:

that it will bring me just over the border
between sanity and madness, but guessing
as to which random objects would help or

In the end, if only for the initial thrill of
the murder investigation, Indigo Prophecy
may be worth a look if you're desperate for
adventure gaming on the Xbox, but the
game's steady decline at its mid-point
means that you probably won't be that
interested in playing it ever again.

Peter Paone's 'Creative Wellsprings'

Paone gave a public lecture 1 on the day of the gallery
opening, in which he surveyed the evolution of his work
in painting, starting as far back as his work in high
o] and ranging to the present. He described his experiences studying at the Philadelphia College of Art, partying with the likes of George Harrison and Ringo Starr
in London in the '6os. and more generally, developing his
philosophy as an artist. "1 spent my entire life keeping

Socializing at Swarthmore outside of Sharples
&

TAMAR LERER

Everybody Eats
Having a healthy relationship with food
is particularly hard at Swarthmore, due to
what I call the "social-savory complex."
Though my take on the military-industrial
complex may not be that clever, my point
remains: Food becomes, for many of us, the
one acceptable form of socializing and the
quick and easy reward for work completed.
Think about it. Are Sharpies dates the
only time you take out of working (or pretending to work) to see people some days? It
is for many of us, which also explains why
we spend hours in Sharpies, mindlessly

going up for second- and third-helpings at
the all-you-can-eat buffet, sampling each one

of the ice cream flavors.
Or think of all the other officially sanctioned study breaks the milk and cookies
hall meeting at 10 p.m., the Parrish Parlors

Death by Chocolate Party, the
come by with buckets of candy.

SAMs who
Add to that
the fact that every group that has a meeting
and wants to entice people to come offers
pizza, and that the best part of seminar is
the study break (and, urn, present biased
preferences...sorry, Professor), and we see
the greatest problem that emerges:
All these breaks combine socializing
with food; it becomes hard to imagine one
without the other. Food becomes the way to
take a break, food becomes the way to justify leaving your room, and food becomes the
social lubricant we all need when alcohol
isn't around (and let's not get into those
empty calories). It becomes okay to relax
only if you're eating, as eating is necessary
to survival. On top of that, all these breaks
with unhealthy comfort foods tap into our
high stress levels and we gorge.

Food becomes, for many of
us, the one acceptable
form of socializing and the
quick and easy reward for
work completed.
The Catch-22 that results is awful. If we
go to one of these study breaks and eat crappy food we promised ourselves we wouldn't,
we feel like we let ourselves down, but if we
watch everyone around us eat and don't do
so ourselves, we feel isolated, maybe a bit
like a loser. The problem with food then
snowballs and becomes a problem with our
friends and even with ourselves.
And because food becomes conflated
with socializing, we start eating instead of
socializing. We treat ourselves to a donut

12

swarthmorephoenix.com

when we finish our paper, we have that bag
of chips alone in our room when we get back
from a problem session. Not only do we eat
out of stress and boredom, but also eating
becomes the easiest way to treat ourselves
it's available, and it takes no time.
Don't worry, though, there are solutions.
I present: "Ways to Socialize at Swarthmore
that do not Involve Food but are Almost as
Accessible, Fast, or Cheap." Part of the solution involves, however, giving in to the
truth: you're not as busy as you think you
are or as you should be. Even if you had so
much work that you should have no time for
fun, I bet you waste tons of time on youtube
or facebook or just starting endlessly into
space. Part of escaping the social-savory
complex is learning to recognize how efficient you are and actually will be, and capitalizing on that free time in a healthy way.
1) Tea. Yes, tea. Tea is the best way to
socialize ever, and runs from zero calories
(without milk and sugar) to 40 calories (with
normal amounts ofboth...mine is about 100
calories, but I'm abnormal). Tea is the ultimate talk stimulator, the whole process
takes about 15 minutes from start to finish,
most forms have that kick of caffeine we're
looking for, the warmth is inherently comforting, and as many people can drink tea as
you have mugs. Perfect.
2) Take a walk. While it's still nice out,
go outside. We go to a beautiful, beautiful
school. There are still flowers in bloom.
Grab a friend, have a chat, breathe the air,
and enjoy. It can take anywhere from five
minutes to as long as you want, and it's

make you feel less stressed and more on
top of your shit. Grab a few friends and
get down to Mullan! And you get to read
People guilt-free while you're on the elliptical.

Also, dear RAs, SAMs, club presidents,
and people bringing in food for break:

bring one healthy thing. As a friend of
mine said once: Keep the dip, change the
dippers. Just add carrot sticks to your
shopping list and make one person feel a

little better.

totally free.

3) Watch a 22-minute TV show. Yes,
you have time. Maybe not for 42 minutes,
but for 22 you do. Personally, I vote for
comedies such as "It's Always Sunny in

Philadelphia" and "30 Rock". Laughing that

hard will make you feel great. I hear it
releases endorphins or something. Anyway,
as many friends as fit around your laptop
can watch and with awesome sites like
hulu.com, it's totally free!
4) Go to cuteoverload.com. Seriously,
go. It is filled with the most happiness on
the internet. Surfing times can range from
30 seconds of instant gratification to hours
of cute-wrenching adorableness. And it's
free.
5) Take a creative study break. One of
my friends bought a book of prompts and
takes breaks to write poems. Another friend
of mine loves collages. Whatever it is, letting your creative side out stems the crankiness while keeping your brain moving, and
it gives you the satisfaction of producing
something. As many friends can join as you
want!
6) Do the crossword. Pick up the Times
in the Science Center, in Parrish, or in

Kohlberg and do the crossword. It's
absolutely free, and you'll need up to five
friends, depending on day of the week and
how good you are (Monday should be a 10
minute quickie for you, Mr. English Major).
If you can't find the paper, go online to
www.nytimes.com and get a free log-in from
www.bugmenot.com so you don't have to
make an account.
7) Do something productive. Shower,
shave, do the laundry, whatever. Take a
little "me" time to do something you need
to get done. Not only can you cross one
more thing off of the looming To-Do list in
your head, but getting stuff done makes
you feel more positive about getting other
stuff done. Yes, you can!
8) Go to the gym. We'll discuss this
more in depth next<time, but don't use my
former main excuse for not going to the
gym. Even going for just 20 minutes has
positive health benefits and can actually

Portrait of the artist
BY ADRIANA POPA
apopal@swarthmore.edu
On Sunday, Oct. 5, New Mexican poet and artist
Susan Gardner enchanted Swarthmore College with a
mix of visualand spoken art as she presented Spanish
and English creations from her recent books "Box of
Light
Caja deLuz" and "Stone Music."
Gardner first introduced her work by defining her
artistic credo, relating a story in which a Korean
monk told her, "The difficult thing is to look around
with open eyes and see what is right in front of you.
Not what you wish was there, not what you expect, but
what is."
In her own words, Gardner uses a blend of poetry,
photography and painting influenced by her interest
in various cultures in order to try and capture 'a
moment in time, a transparent glimpse of reality. The
work reflects the sense of the present."
With this goal in mind, Gardner spoke on how her
artistic evolution has been a perpetual and personal
process of understanding and growth, marked by her
self-confidence and determination. "You must try to
awaken yourself. No one can do that for you," Gardner
said, "I was told I didn't have talent, but I never aban-

doned art."

Bernard Woma and the Saakumu Dance Troupe mixed traditional Ghanaian culture with more contemporary dance
forms in Lang Concert Hall last Friday night.

Dancing to a different beat
BY EVA AMESSE

eamessel@swarthmore.edu

On Friday, Oct. 3 the Ghanaian Saakumu Dance
Troupe, led by musician and master of the Ghanian gyil
Bernard Woma, entered through the rear of the Lang
Concert Hall with an outburst of lively drumming and
singing in a performance that combined traditional West

African culture with more contemporary dance forms.
Woma, a charismatic performer, enraptured the audience with his powerful voice and warm persona while the
broad smile and palpable passion of Philadelphia-based
musician Gina Ferrera complemented the seemingly
effortless movements of leading Saakumu member Peace
Elewonu.
After the first few pieces, a surge of energy took hold of
the room when Woma encouraged the audience to sing
and dance along with the performers. "African music isn't
about sitting around," Woma said. Shari Rutherford 'l2
did not hesitate to respond to Woma's call for audience
participation. Eager to show off her newly acquired
African dance skills, the confident first-year boldly initiated the audience's participation by getting up on stage to
dance.
A passionate artist and educator, Woma was thrilled to
have the opportunity to share both his music and
Ghanaian traditions with the Swarthmore community. As
one of Ghana's most acclaimed xylophone players, Woma
has performed at New York City's Lincoln Center and
Carnegie Hall. In addition to his leadership of the
Saakuma Dance Troupe and Ghana's Dagura Music and
Arts Center, Woma has spearheaded an advocacy campaign to bring cleaner drinking water to the residents of
his village, Hiineteng, in the northwestern region of
Ghana. Woma said he sees his music as a medium for fostering cross-cultural communication empathy. "My music
ties cultures together. It's not about giving, it's about
sharing," Woma said.
The gyil, a Ghanaian percussion instrument that
resembles a wooden xylophone suspended on a frame of
grounds, has been a central part of Woma's life since he

14

started playing the instrument at the age of two.
Producing a distinctive buzzing sound that is both warm
and uniquely resonant, the gyil creates the impression
that multiple instruments are being played simultaneously.
Gyils are traditionally played in pairs with wooden
mallets at a variety of social gatherings, ranging from festivals to ceremonies. According to Sasha Shahidi 'O9, who
learned to play the instrument in a workshop with
Ferrera last year, "The gyil is so connected to the earth.
Original gyils did not have gourds but were played over a
hole in the ground."

"My music ties cultures together. It's
not about giving, it's about sharing."
Bernard Woma
Leader of the Saakumu Dance
Troupe
Woma's visit was particularly exciting for those students who are part of the Swarthmore Gyil Ensemble,
which is made possible by the Fetter Chamber Music
Program. Attending workshops with Woma and hearing
him play was an inspiration to the small but passionate
ensemble comprised of three Swarthmore students and
Biochemistry Professor Judy Voet.
For ensemble member Myles Dakan 'lO, who was first
exposed to the unique instrument a year ago, Woma's visit
to Swarthmore was "a whirlwind of excitement."
Madrianne Wong 'll, another member of the ensemble,
was in awe of Woma's skills. "He makes it look so natural.
His hands just fly. I can't believe he's here! He's the master of the gyil," Wong said, adding that she has been fascinated by the instrument since she was first exposed to its
unique sound. "I'd never heard anything like it."
October 9, 2008

"Poems are spoken songs. I
have tried to capture the sense
and the music of the language.
Sometimes a poem starts in
English, other times, in Spanish."
Susan Gardner
New Mexican artist and poet
Gardner's reading selections from her two books
invested her voice with both the warmth of her lyric
expression and the melody of the English and Spanish
languages used in her poetry. Her bilingual presentation not only gave a charming duality to our perception of her art but also conveyed a multi-faced image
of the world. The bilingual form of Gardner's poetry is
a choice which reflects her perception of language:
"Poems are spoken songs. I have tried to capture the
sense and the music of the language. Sometimes a
poem starts in English, other times, in Spanish."
In her quest for new artistic forms, Gardner has
explored incorporating modern techniques in her
style as naturally as possible since she considers digital possibilities to be both green and able to "leave
room for the unexpected." Gardner believes that far
from turning paintings and photography into non-art,
the computer remains a tool for the artist and she
insists on the distinction between the tool and the
idea.

Gardner's work is deceptively simple yet has
enjoyed wide success, perhaps due to the fact that
Gardnerholds the audience as such an important part
ofher artistic creation process. She considers a piece
of art unfinished until it is "communicated" and transcended to the public. Associate Dean for StudentLife
Myrt Westphal, who introduced Gardner, believes that

"the combination of visual stimulation and read poetry builds a unique atmosphere" that appeals to lovers

of all forms of art.
Audience member Michael Duffy 11 believed
Gardner's work to be "remarkable for its simplicity
and distinctiveness, unadorned and yet individual,
quietly observed and uniquely expressed."
This "quiet" nature of Gardner's work is deeply
rooted in her understanding of the artistic meaning—with the world being a very noisy place, Gardner
believes that 'an artist has two choices: be louder or be
quiet." Gardner's work embodies the type of penetrating "quietness" that cannot be ignored and that fulfills
its purpose of delivering the message to the reader or
viewer.
In a world where everyone shouts, Susan Gardner
has chosen to be silent and let her art speak for her
with astonishing effects.

Alicia Lemke at Friday's Rose Tattoo Cafe.

Olde-fashioned good music
BY DAISY SCHMITT

dschmitl@swarthmore.edu

A motley parade of performers hit the
stage in Olde Club's "Rose Tattoo Cafe," a tra-

ditional showcasing of Swarthmore talent.
Classmates, teammates, hallmates
all were
able to publicly reveal their musical flair,
whether rooted in folk, pop, punk or the
blues.
"People are so impressive here," Molly
Siegel'l2 said. "It was great to see my peers on
stage."

When James Robinson 'lO took the stage
and kicked off the night with a spot-on rendition of "Love," the enthusiasm of his fans
was palpable
and for good reason.
Robinson's presence on stage was humble
and unassuming, and his songs ranged from
tongue-in-cheek to incredibly sentimental.
Perhaps the highlight of his set was
"Alexander Hamilton," an original and
incredibly clever song about the Founding
Father. Robinson was recently contacted by
documentary filmmakers out of Washington
D.C. and asked to perform you guessed it
"Alexander Hamilton" for their documentary.
The heartfelt, genuine performance given by

Robinson was an evening highlight.
Then Ben Plotkin-Swing 'O9 charmed us all
with his ukulele and Devendra Banhart-esque
vocals. He got the crowd stomping, clapping
and bobbing their heads to his original songs.
Lyrics like, "It's a spring day, but I tell my
heart to be wary, because a spring day don't
come in February," were reminiscent of a

simple, folksy style.
In another unusual performance, Tasha
Lewis 'l2 joined Sam Goodman 'lO onstage
and the blending of female and male vocals
made for a unique contribution to the night.
Their cover of Dar Williams' "My Friends"
was especially lovely, and "The Monkey
Song" was met with great enthusiasm from
the crowd. Goodman wrote the catchy tune
himself, and I will admit to having "Hey mister, won't you tell me, does your monkey play
the blues?" stuck in my head as the night
went on.
From the moment Alicia Lemke 'O9 began
to sing, the crowd was rendered speechless by
her sultry, controlled and haunting voice.
Lemke sampled several beautiful songs:

THE PHOENIX

"Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac, "I Know You
By Heart" by Eva Cassidy and "I Will Follow
You Into The Dark" by Death Cab For Cutie.
Each song was gorgeous in and of itself;
Lemke brought her own special something to
each one, making for a truly memorable performance.
Then, Jon Peters 'O9 delivered an enthused
performance, singing about the "cruel, cruel,
cruel world" in which we all live. Joined by
Ben Starr 'll on drums, Peters strummed his
guitar left-handed and performed his own
songs with the unmistakable gusto of a born
performer. Peters expressed considerable
(faux) annoyance at not yet receiving a record

deal, but it's surely just a matter of time.
Ben Starr completely rocked out on the
keyboard, eliciting an encore. His first song,
"The Hunt" was a haunting piece with a soaring melody, which contrasted sharply with
his cover of "How to Touch a Girl" by Jojo.
Suffice it to say that his encore piece was
highly inappropriate, and the crowd loved it.
Some day, we will all be able to say proudly, "Yeah, I knew Silbia Han." Han 'l2 delivered the most professional performance of the
night. Her songs were polished, pop-tinged
and fast-paced.
Frankly, she was born for the stage. She
attracted a large group of fans and even managed to get the entire room to sing along to a
chorus of "Whoa's." Han's unassuming, humble persona made it even more pleasing when
she began to sing
a likable, impressive and
singular performance indeed.
The night closed with Olde Club veteran
Ben Hopkins 'O9 and his band, made up of
Nick Gaw 'O9 on acoustic guitar and Dan Sito
'O9 on drums. Hopkins, who cites Elliott
Smith and Neil Young as influences, got over
his self-proclaimed laziness and nerves so as
to give us a taste of his songwriting.
The simple melodies and varied styles of
guitar made for a slightly country, slightly
folk and entirely enjoyable performance,
capped off by a great cover of "Your Little
Hoodrat Friend" by, as Hopkins would say,
"the best band in the world"
the Hold
Steady.

and Jon Peters are all members of the The
Phoenix staff but were not involved in the production of this article.

The challenges of NYU in Abu Dhabi Deer cull unconscionable
As our president transitions from Swarthmore
College to New York University Abu Dhabi, he takes
with him a legacy of idealism, pragmatism and progressivism. In his 2004 Commencement Address,
Bloom issued a "pragmatic imperative" to the graduating class: "transformed global expectations join[ed] to
the ethical mandate to build an inclusive world." Next
August, Al Bloom moves on to the next step of his
career, a continuation of his dedication to education
and, in his words, "ethical intelligence responsive to
our times." As Vice Chancellor of NYU's new Abu
Dhabi campus, Bloom will be collaborating with a college administration and a government as excited about
the impact of education as he is.
First, a few quick facts about Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi
is one of the United Arab Emirate's seven emirates,
and Abu Dhabi city is the capital of the U.A.E. Led by
Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi has a
population of roughly 16 million, a large portion of
which is composed of foreign workers and other expatriates. Thanks to the nation's oil-wealth and the government's mission, Abu Dhabi has become a high-tech
city with a booming financial sector and an increasingly successful tourism industry.

These and other issues
undoubtedly exist, yet they do
not represent grounds for
dismissing
the Abu Dhabi
government's idealist project.
...

Having already constructed a thriving metropolis,
the city's leadership is now enriching its cultural and
intellectual resources and is investing significant
amounts of money to do so. Nowhere is this more evident than on Saadiyat, the island location of a $2B billion redevelopment project.
Saadiyat, it can fairly be said, is the next expression
of the Abu Dhabi government's vision; namely, a thrust
towards greater cultural and intellectual awareness
and development. The government of Abu Dhabi has
already committed $5O million to the construction and
development of the New York University campus on
the small island.
Furthermore, the government has already sought
out and paid for an infusion ofWestern art: by the time
Swarthmore's class of 2011 graduates, Saadiyat will be
home to a Guggenheim museum of modern and contemporary art designed by architect Frank Gehry, as
well as a Louvre Abu Dhabi.
By 2014, the first class to graduate from NYUAD will
have experienced a liberal arts education surrounded
not only by some of the greatest works of art and culture in Western civilization, but they will have done so
in an extraordinarily unique situation, as the proverbial guinea pigs of an experiment by a government and
an institution to extend the principles of liberal arts
education to the Middle East.
While slightly isolated from the rest of Abu Dhabi,
the enclave of western culture and intellectual life soon
to occupy Saadiyat will, its developers hope, influence
the surrounding area in a positive way. NYUAD will be
heavily recruiting international students and,
undoubtedly, students from Abu Dhabi, who will likely
represent the children of the economic and cultural
elite.
According
to Swarthmore Sociology and
Anthropology Professor Farha Ghannam, NYUAD's
location in the region makes it a much more desirable
option for parents who want a liberal arts education for
their children, but in a more familiar environment.
Also, Arab nations like the UAE recognize that oil is
not a sustainable source of wealth, and that future success rests on the innovation, intelligence and a focus on

16

their youth. Ghannam says, "My sense is that [members of the Abu Dhabi government] are so aware of the
importance of education and how it's going to make
that they
them so much more competitive globally
will give much more space than they would allow, for
instance, for local institutions."
Nevertheless, Abu Dhabi is not America, and
despite the assurances of its government, NYUAD will
stillbe subject to the law of the land. For one, questions
have already been raised about how much autonomy
NYUAD will actually have. The Abu Dhabi government
"will provide the land, funding, and financingTor the
development, construction, equipping, maintenance
and facilities' operation of the NYUAD Campus,"
according to a statement from David McLaughlin, the
Provost of NYU. McLaughlin, in the same document,
stated thatthe university will have 'absolute and unfettered authority over all academic matters," including
the right to complete academic freedom for its students
and faculty. President Bloom has also emphasized that
his decision to lead NYUAD rests on this understanding. That the government basically holds the pursestrings, however, brings the feasibility of academic
freedom into question.
Plans for NYUAD raise a number ofother short- and
long-term issues that Bloom and the rest of the NYU
team will have to address before their vision can be
realized. Two of the most prominent are that homosexuality is illegal in Abu Dhabi and that Israeli citizens
are not permitted to enter the nation.
Less obvious problems also exist. Roughly 80 percent of the population of Abu Dhabi city is comprised
of foreign workers who are routinely denied citizenship, and no comprehensive labor laws exist to protect
them from exploitation. Who will construct the
NYUAD campus, and how (if at all) will the development team address labor issues in a satisfactory manner?
What about professorial tenure? How will Emirate
law impact how the university runs itself? How does
the university perceive its relationship with the community? What if the government tries to interfere? The
list of questions and concerns continues on in this vein.
...

That the government basically
holds the purse-strings
brings the feasibility of
academic freedom into

...

question.
These and other issues undoubtedly exist, yet they
do not represent grounds for dismissing NYU and the
Abu Dhabi government's idealist project. Rather, this
is a groundbreaking opportunity to engage with the
Arab world at large and to demonstrate the compatibility of an American-style education with Arab culture and values within the specific context of Abu
Dhabi, an exceptionally cosmopolitan setting.
Over the past 17 years, we have seen Al Bloom
demonstrate his ability to understand various groups
and make pragmatic change, mostly for the better.
Under his leadership, the College has increased the
diversity of its students and staff, expanded its facilities and strengthened its commitment to environmental sustainability.
NYU's dreams for a global network of colleges, and
the Abu Dhabi government's prioritization of education, creativity and innovation are to be applauded. We
can only ask that President Bloom continue to uphold
his ideals in this radically different environment and
engage the students, university and community he will
encounter in Abu Dhabi with the inclusive and inquiring attitude he has demonstrated throughout his time
at Swarthmore.

To the Editor:
To those in favor of culling and killing the deer in Crum
Woods as nuisances consuming the College's vegetation, most
would agree first that it is unconscionable to kill when humane
alternatives exist. And they do. From the Oregonian newspaper, September 30,2008, in an article on research regarding ren-

dering animals infertile,

"...

products that were effective on

wildlife such as deer and elephant didn't work as well on dogs

and cats." Alternatives exist: killing in this case isn't a necessity. It is a convenient preference based upon selfishness.
Second, wasting disease is real, not an insult to hunters, just
a fact. Why run the risk? Third, we share this world with other
sentient beings. Dominion, the belief in a hierarchy of life with
us at the top and our needs alone as the only needs worth considering, has failed this planet. It is a belief system based upon
a sense of moral superiority clearly evident in the comments
[on The Phoenix website], and abject self absorption (only our
needs matter). It has brought us to where we are today: in trouble as a planet.
Finally, Quaker institutions have a moral
not an amoral
responsibility to apply their values in all decision making,
whether it is about the environment or the animals who occupy our world too. It is a religion based upon non-violence and
coexistence. Why would anyone in good faith exclude the lives
of animals from moral concerns? Swarthmore and those in
favor of culling and killing have. The decision to kill is not
about science. It is about morality. The decision about whether
or not a given choice is moral isn't dictated by which lobby one
aspires to: the College lobby or the gun lobby. The aerial shooting of wolves in Alaska is as immoral as killing and culling the
Crum Woods deer. Neither has a chance in hell of escaping the
largest predator, the one with the gun who "wins" the most
dubious trophy.
If interested about the subject as a whole, read Peter
Singer's many works, including his essays on speciesism. Peter
Singer is a Professor of Bioethics in the University Center for
Human Values at Princeton University. It is well worth the
effort, especially in college, where one should be challenged by
new ideas and not defensive about old ones that have served
mankind so poorly.

Lessons and opportunities of the economic crisis
just the last step in the complicated
process of pursuing the social good.

PHILIP ISSA
Philadelphia
It's hard to imagine a more breathtaking election cycle than this one. The economic crisis effectively blew a hole in the
old political rhetoric and has forced
everyone, politicians and citizens alike, to

evaluate their views on the role of government in American life. It's as if we woke
up one day and realized that this government that we've been enfeebling for so
long is actually an extension of society
and can be asked to serve it. Government
is a societal construct; this is a powerful
realization. Society designs it and society
defines it. Maybe, then, we should make a
better effort to understand it.

Understanding government begins
with recognizing the role that citizens
play in its maintenance. Citizens in a
democratic society are the sovereign
they are ultimately responsible for seeing

that government serves their welfare best.

They establish a political system, maintain it and modify it, and elect people to
represent them in this system. Voting is

tive, but this is admittedly a subjective
proposition. What is considered a social
"good," and what makes one version of
society "better" than another? Perhaps it
is the application offairness and justice in
such a manner that allows a person's welfare (individually defined) to be linearly
proportional to the amount of effort that
he put into improving his own lot. When
this linear relationship fails, is it the duty
of government to provide temporary security to those who do not enjoy their fair
due of welfare? At what cost should this
quest for fairness and justice be to indi-

vidual liberties?
How we answer these questions casts
the lens through which we view government. Somewhere along theroad since the
Great Depression, we lost sight of these
questions and fell for a desperately archaic belief of "big government bad, small
government good, individual liberties
absolutely paramount." Then, this bombshell of an economic crisis dropped in and
thrust the above questions onto the plates
of politicians.
The stakes of the bailout vote were
clear: government inaction would lead,
with great certainty, to a severe recession.
It is simply not debatable that a recession,
stemming from this economic crisis and
assured by government inaction, would
have lead to an unfair loss of welfare for
over two hundred million Americans who
work hard and have nothing directly to do
with the financial sector. Yet, one could
rationalize government inaction if one
believes that individual liberties and its
paradigm, laissez-faire capitalism, ought
to be secured by government before fairness. Under this rationalization, the liber-

ty of actors in the markets are paramount
to the insurance of fair and justreturns to
effort by non-financial sector actors, no
matter what the consequences are.
Government action, on the other hand,
might avert economic collapse (we're still
waiting to see). More importantly, though,
a vote for the bailout also implies that
fairness is a greater social good than individual liberty and that we understand our
society as being "better" if it were fairer.
Congress voted for action.
It is now our turn to pick up the discussion that Congress has unwittingly
begun, and as students at a liberal arts
college, we are among the most capable to
do so. It's not difficult to see how our
understanding of government necessarily
depends on a holistic view of society,
much as a liberal arts education emphasizes a holistic view of knowledge.
Consider, for instance, individual liber-

ties.
Can they be as expansive today, in an
increasingly interconnected world, as our
founding fathers wanted them to be? This
globalized world, where a few defaulting
mortgages in the United States can lead to
global economic meltdown and where carbon emissions from one country can redefine biomes in others? Can they be as
expansive today, when we have a vastly
superior understanding of medicine and
health? When we have drugs and guns
that are far more potent, widespread, and
deadly?

All fields of academia deal with such
issues; if not directly, then by trying to
comprehend how the human psyche and
society have responded to the never-ending cycle of change.
It's a shame that it took a major crisis
to get Congress to recognize and act on its
beliefs, namely that it exists to ensure a
fair allocation of welfare and to provide a

societal superstructure that is conducive

to steady and fair welfare growth.
But perhaps here, too, a liberal arts
education can help. Political Science deals
precisely with the efficacy of government
with respect to representation and the
aggregation of divergent individual
"goods", and it studies how different political structures and politicians deal with
crises before and after they occur.

Economics concerns itself with how free
agents respond to market circumstances
and the cost of market inefficiencies
(intrinsic and otherwise) and their potential remedies. Psychology sheds light on
how voters respond to various cues when
making political decisions. The study of
education in America has long debated
the value of promoting liberal democratic
values through schooling. History, classics, the list could go on forever
each of
these academic fields provide us with
valuable insights on how our political system can be better designed to pursue the
social good, even in times outside of a crisis.
I am neither suggesting that everyone
should make political science their primary interest, nor am I necessarily advocating a core curriculum that emphasizes
liberal democratic ideals (I'll let education theorists debate that one).
However, the economic crisis, along
with the upcoming election, presents us
with an incredible opportunity to reassess
our political system and consider how we
can improve it to better represent our
interests. We're at an academic institution where free and holistic thought are
valued above all else, so let's not now or
ever shy away from more open and
diverse discussion on American govern-

ment.

Union members are convening in Luxembourg this week
to discuss the measures forfinancial stability the importance of America in the global picture has never been so
readily apparent. Forget the Middle Eastern wars and the
terrible reality shows; when the proverbial international
wallets are affected, America has the world's undivided
attention. It is fascinating in a morbid sort of way to witness the fall of one business giant after another, like so
many misguidedly conceited dominoes.
This domino effect, however, goes beyond simple economics. At the end of the line is something much more
intangible and, I think, much more significant
the likely destruction of a romanticized outside view ofAmerica.
Despite the recent string of negative hits to its global
THE PHOENIX

image, America still remains very much a shining city on
a hill for many living in other countries.
I would venture to say that this claim applies to even
the men and women of Europe, whose sole pastime appears
to have become bashing "those arrogant Americans."
CBS's Late Late Show host, Craig Ferguson, is one Scottish
import who professes nothing but love for this nation.
And America has always been the country that could,
born out of fire against the most powerful colonial power
of that time. After the Second World War, America put the
world on her financial shoulders and still managed to
emerge as the global superpower.
The world finds it easy to forgive America, because it
has always depended on her. For all the uproar over the
Bush administration's alleged ruining of the entire Earth,
European nations still welcomed presidential candidate
Barack Obama with an excited fervor matched only by the

liberals' on this soil.
The fascination with America is that she appears to be
the land of opportunity, as it were
and
a place of hope
that she simply appears under different guises.
Overenthusiastic global policeman is the current one.
America, it seems, cultivates success that is appreciated to
a magnified degree overseas. This idea can be translated
across various arenas
it helps explain, for one, the
ridiculous amount of fandom Kobe Bryant enjoys in China,
which already has a basketball star in native son Yao
Ming.

Nowhere is such a cultivation of success so obvious,
however, as in the economic arena. If nothing already
espoused above is convincing enough proof of America's
global appeal, consider the influx of foreign students to
American universities at the turn of the century. By 2006,
according to the Institute of International Education,
America housed more than half a million foreign students,
the greatest number in the world. America offered
research grants and fast cars.

But more importantly, prospective millionairesflocked
to the big-name institutions hoping to cash in on the land
of opportunity, which this time appeared in the form of
something called investment banking. Today, the falls of
Wachovia and Lehman Bros, share headlines with suicide
bombings in Pakistan and might-be-a-cease-fire in
Georgia. All of a sudden this nation looks as vulnerable as
the broken ones that dominate international news every

day.

The fascination with America
is that she appears to be
a place of hope
and that
she simply appears under
different guises.
...

Even with all its admitted shortcomings, from seriously flawed health insurance to incomprehensible mortgage
plans, America was not some other nation in the eyes of an
international. It was the nation, even if it was hard to
express in words. The American dream wasn't something
confined to the working class and Arthur Miller, it was
something even people in other countries could strive for.
Ultimately, I think, America has always been inspiration for the rest of the world, despite her many obvious
flaws. It hasn't been about what any given administration
has done in its ruling tenure so much as the idealized
thought of this place of dreams and opportunity. And to
see the light source short-circuited is discouraging in a
time where the world really does look like it is ripping at

the seams.

The Democrats in 2008: winning by default
ly possible that Obama would win a contiguous line of states stretching from
Minnesota to Maine, and another stretching from Maine down to North Carolina.
According to Pollster.com (probably the
best site for this type of thing) it's not
improbable that Obama will receive over
350 electoral votes.
How did this happen? It was only
three weeks ago when Democrats (myself
included) were panicked, that rumors
abounded in the blogosphere that Hillary
Clinton would replace Joe Biden as vicepresidential nominee, and that Obama
was being eviscerated by his supporters
for being too calm and confident and boring.
Two things happened, in my un-pro-

JONATHAN EMONT

found estimation. The first involved
Sarah Palin and the second involved the
financial meltdown.
Sarah Palin, I still maintain, was an

Political Prisoner
I am generally interested in this type
of thing, but Tuesday's presidential
debate was boring. I don't think there
was a single meaningful exchange.
McCain referred to Obama as "that one"
which was possibly offensive. There you
have it.
Obama won the debate, although it
was more by default than deftness. He
was far more articulate than McCain, didn't sound either professorial or folksy,
and had a plan to solve the financial
crises that didn't involve lowering taxes
on the wealthy. Obama didn't pull any
punches or lose his cool or do anything
that might jeopardize his lead in thepolls.
McCain didn't land any punches or find
his cool or do anything that might jeopardize Obama's lead in the polls. A CNN
poll of debate watchers found that 68% of
them thought Obama more likeable. Only
28% preferred McCain.
So, as of this writing, things look pretty clear. Every major polling site believes
the odds heavily favor Obama, and if the
election were held tomorrow, it's perfect-

extremely smart vice-presidential pick.

We have only to remember the atmosphere after the Democratic Convention,
when it seemed that an Obama victory
was inevitable, to remember how significantly Palin changed the equation of the
race. She gave conservatives another
good reason to vote and lent the
Republican ticket some dash and sparkle.

Obama won the
debate, although it
was more by default
than deftness.
The backlash, however, was inevitable.
While every American understood that
Palin's knowledge of foreign affairs was
limited, no one suspected that she wouldn't be able to name a single news publication that she read. (Surely this is a pretty

easy answer to bullshit, no?) And her
absolutely asinine suggestion, that her
state's proximity to Russia meant that she
was somehow better equipped to deal with
the Russian menace, added a little levity
to an otherwise unrelenting race.
Palin is still the darling of the heartland, not that I claim to speak for it. But
her provincialism, her conservatism, and
her utter lack of knowledge about most
things political, made the ticket far less
appealing to the educated and wealthier
portions of McCain's base. Whatever
early polls showed about Palin switching
white women' allegiances, I don't think
that after sitting through the Katie Couric
interview many Hillary supporters continued believing that Palin was the

woman for them.

In the end though, it was the financial
crises that did her in.
One of Palin's first, and most revealing
utterances was that Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae had "gotten too big and expensive for taxpayers." She failed to take into
account that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
were, at the time, largely (alrthough not
completely) privately owned.
McCain's attempts at showing the public how serious he is about fixing the economy are somewhat undermined, therefore, by his choice of vice-presidential
nominee.
Palin was McCain's only dramatic
option, and he chose her at a time when he
needed to change the campaign's trajectory. It worked for a while, but the McCain
campaign had no follow up act. Then the
financial meltdown happened, and Palin's
inadequacies were illuminated for all to
see.
The debates have also helped Obama.
McCain has been alienating every base he
has ever courted, railing against corporate "excess and greed" a number of times
in both debates while promising these
same, presumably greedy and excessive
people, even higher tax cuts. With corpo-

rations donating in record amount to the
Democratic candidate, it's unclear who

McCain is hoping to win over with his tax
plan. It's almost admirable: McCain just
seems ideologically in favor of inequality,
whatever the political costs.
Obama, by contrast, appears calm and
commanding.
His demeanor hasn't
changed since he won the nomination,
and, at this point, there is no reason to
suspect it will.

The financial meltdown
happened, and Palln's
Inadequacies were
illuminated for all to see.
In this race, it doesn't seem like either
of the candidates' actions are variables
anymore. Their positions on issues are
clearly defined so external factors will
determine the race.
When the economy has sunk, the job
market has dried up, and the failure of
government oversight has contributed to
the mess, it isn't a good time to be a member of the ruling party. Obama hasn't said
anything particularly brilliant on the
campaign trail, but neither does he have
to. It's simply a good time to be a
Democrat.
So when you get a debate as you did
last night, with Obama declaring America
a fundamental "force for good," and a
soul-searching McCain telling us that he
believed that "America is the greatest
country in the world," Obama supporters
can take heart that between now and election day, something really, really cool is
going to have to happen for McCain to
win it.

The redefinition of 'making it': the new latchkey kids
The
unease

market
has
brought
into
sharp relief a lot
of mixed feelings about what
to
it means
"make it." As
New York Times
columnist
Judith Warner
described
in
"Waiting
for
Schadenfreude,"
those not mucking around with

speculations

face a different
standard when
faced with "the
guys who, in college, I used to
step
over on
Sunday mornings when they were lying in a pool of their
own vomit," he said. "And now they're earning millions
and millions in bonuses alone."
As a writer and creative type, Warner was doing OK,
but wanted more: "like just about everyone, we worked
hard and treaded water, but felt we were entitled to do
better than that."
Someone has to say it, so I might as well. If you want
a job that can be described as "creative," or fulfilling in a
nonmonetary sense, be prepared to not have a lot of
money, and if you want to live in places where there are
-

18

a lot of other creatives, i.e. cities, be prepared to be
around people who have a lot more than you. We really
don't know how to talk about money, and we don't talk
about how what you want often isn't practical or something that will let you retire. That's a harsh feeling, I'd
say, that success is defined by a crowd of loose-spending
vomiters that what you do will be divorced from whatever it is that makes things the way are, and that you're
not supposed to say that that's unfair. In that, you're on
your own.
From the 'Bos onward, latchkey kids have been a

perennial concern, gaining attention alongside Tom
Wolfe's commentary on Wall Street mayhem, "The

Bonfire of the Vanities."
Coincidence? No. What comes out of the synthesis of
these disparate phenomena is a sort of latchkey culture,
in that no one ever talks about how doing what makes
you happy will make it really difficult to live. Market
and meaning are divorced (were they ever really married? I sense a shotgun wedding at best), and make you
pick which one you'll live in. And the unpicked parent
will disenherit you. In that sense, none of us are well
brought up, but some are just more sensititve to that sort
ofbroken home, I guess.
People often look back at college as the best years of
their lives because it is right before when the results of
the divorce court proceedings are made clear. It's the last
place where someone else will subsidize your contempt
for the world, so I suggest you hate while you can,
because you have to drop that when you work for real,
when you "contribute."
And it's getting harder to live off of a job you don't
really like. The disjuncture between making money and
living a life where Bowie is your unironic soudtrack is
October 9, 2008

something that has to be bridged, usually at the expense
of living life the way you think it ought to be lived. It's
something that your parents had to do to foot the bill for
your first twenty odd years, and that goes a long way
toward explaining why a lot of people resent their parents.

If you want a job that can be
described as "creative," or
fulfilling in a nonmonetary
sense, be prepared to not
have a lot of money.

The scramble for success, in a way, will never be as
satisfying as self-righteous teenage angst if you don't
think that the compromise of "success" means something.
So what happens when those kids who never really
understood the whole divorce thing move to New York to
live life their own way? It becomes impossible to imagine a life where you don't have to foot the bill, that if you
went somewhere else, life wouldn't be so boring. Being
somewhere else isn't that different, apparently. In other
words, maybe you had it best when you had a curfew. So
just face up to it now, you're going to turn into your parents, just with a lot more debt. Developing a bad case of
the Morrisseys? Good.

Men's soccer bounces back Cross country competes at Lehigh
BY JARED NOLAN

jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore Men's Soccer continued its rebound from two tough loss-

es with a victory last Saturday, marking its third win in a row and
improving its record to 8-2-1 (3-1 CC). The 3-0 victory came over
Gettysburg College, 4-4-3 (1-2-1 CC), a team that historically has had success against the Garnet. The Bullets won the matchup the past two seasons, and last Saturday's match was only the second Garnet victory in 16
all-time regular season matches between Swarthmore and Gettysburg.
In the 16 meetings the Bullets have outscored the Garnet 40-8.
Through the first half it looked as if either team could gain the advantage with both squads generating opportunities; Swarthmore had six
shots to Gettysburg's three. Despite these chances on both sides, the
score remained tied 0-0 at halftime. The game heated up in the second
half, with five yellow cards given out by the referee and 27 fouls called
(one Swarthmore player was taken to the hospital after suffering a blow
to the eye). The Garnet's offense took part in this effort, scoring its first
goal in the 62nd minute.
Swarthmore midfielder Ladule Lako Lo Sarah 'O9 took a corner kick,
sending the ball to the top of the box where captain Jeff Kushner 'O9
headed it to teammate Ybi Tibbetts 'O9, who then headed the ball into the
back of the net. Lo Sarah also played a role in the second goal, when in
the 67th minute he fed the ball to Dylan Langley 'lO, who took a shot that
brought the Garnet's lead to 2-0. The final score came 13 minutes later off
an unassisted play by Swarthmore forward David Sterngold 'l2.
Sterngold dribbled the ball past two Gettysburg defenders before touching it past the goalie, finding the left side of the net.
Lo Sarah described the keys to the victory. "We neutralized their
attack and took advantage of our opportunities," he said. Swarthmore
Head Coach Eric Wagner thought that Swarthmore's game plan was
"executed perfectly." "We were patient, focused, kept wearing the other
team down, and we never got worried or concerned," Wagner said. The
idea of patience and tiring the opponent manifested itself in the Garnet's
starting lineup and substitutions. Both Lo Sarah and Morgan Langley
"lL two key players, came off the bench. With regards to Langley,
Wagner said that "Morgan is better coming off the bench and we planned
to put him in when Gettysburg got tired."
Speaking about Lo Sarah Wagner said that it was "maybe the best
game I've seen him play here in four years." It was certainly a momentous game because, with his two assists, Lo Sarah is now tied for fifth
among all-time Swarthmore assist leaders with 12. Another six assists
will put him in first. Lo Sarah did not see himself as the key to the game;
he pointed to Jason Thrope 'O9, who made his first career appearance in
goal. Specifically, Lo Sarah described an 'amazing save" that Thrope
had in the first half. "The ball broke in the middle at the 18, and they had
a breakaway through the two middle defensive backs," Lo Sarah said.
"Thrope came out and blocked the ball with his legs." The save was particularly significant because neither team had yet scored in the game.
With a converted opportunity and a Gettysburg lead, the outcome of the
game could have been vastly different.
While this was Thrope's first official start in goal, Lo Sarah revealed
that during the team's preseason trip to Brazil Thrope was called on to
play keeper. The Garnet had an exhibition match against a Brazilian
club team, Clube Atletico Paulista, which did not have a goalie. Thrope
stepped up and played for the other club and gained a valuable experience, one that Lo Sarah said prepared him for this game. Lo Sarah went
on to say that Thrope is "a player who doesn't get enough credit and he
showed how valuable an asset he is on the team. Wagner also commended the play of his ad hoc keeper, who finished the game with two saves.
Wagner describe the goalie situation as "pretty crazy." Swarthmore
began the season with Zach Weimar 'l2 as starting keeper, but he went
down with a season-ending injury. It was a hard blow for the Garnet
because Weimar was fourth in the nation in the Goals Against statistic.
"To lose a player of his caliber is tough," Wagner said. Weimer received
a medical redshirt, so he plans to come back next year as a junior and
play two more seasons for Swarthmore.
Freshman David D'Annunzio stepped in for a number of games, but
suffered a bad hit to the quadriceps. He played hurt for two more matches, but the trainers decided that if he continued to play it could result in
a more serious season-ending injury. That led to the decision to start
Thrope in goal. Wagner could not get over how impressed he was with
the performance of his improvised keeper. "He was a starting defender
on Wednesday, and his first career shutout was on Saturday. He has a
goal, assist, and shutout this year," Wagner said. Certainly not many
players can say that. Thrope should be playing the field again soon, however, because Wagner expects D'Annunzio to regain his health and
return to his spot between the goal posts.
According to D'Annunzio, "The plan is that I will play in our next
game." At least Wagner now knows he has a proven backup if the need
arises. The Garnet have a week off before they face another Centennial
Conference foe, Ursinus, home on Saturday at 7 PM. No Centennial
Conference opponent should be counted out because the conference is, in
the words of Lo Sarah, "the strongest since I've been here." Lo Sarah said
he was confident that the team can challenge any adversary if it maintains the attitude displayed in Saturday's game. "We can play with any
team in the nation when we come out focused and play hard," he said.

This past Friday, Swarthmore's Women's and
Men's varsity cross country teams raced at the 35th
annual PaulShort Invitational at Lehigh University,
where they competed against teams from schools
representing a broad regional base and Divisions I,
II and HI. Both the men's and women's team put
forth strong showings as the men finished20th out of
41 teams and the women placed Bth out of 37 entries.
Patrick Hartnett 11 led the Garnet with a time of
27:09, which put him in 51st place overall. Melissa
Frick 'l2 led the women and finished 41st out of 260
runners with a time of 23:09.
On the men's side, Erik Saka 'O9 followed
Hartnett with a 67th place finish. He was followed
closely by Dan Hodson 'O9, who finished the race in
75th place. Following them were Alex Fyre 'l2, David
Riccardi 10, Chris Wickham 'l2. In the overall competition, the men's team earned a 20th place finish.
The girl's team was led by Frick's 41st place finish. Following her lead was Bess Ritter 'O9, who
crossed the line with a time of 23:31 Although a few
girls had to miss the race due to injury and illness,
which was a noticeable disadvantage for the team,
the team showed good depth with a 36 second spread.
"Our pack was overall quite a bit faster than last
year. I think the meet was a great indication of just
how strong we are this year, especially as we get
more race-sharp in the next month," Bess Ritter 'O9,
one of the team's co-captains, said. Senior runners

Feeney,

Faith Pampel, and

Emma Stanley closely followed the lead. As a reflection of the team's performance, "the top five girls finished within 37 seconds of each other, which is out-

rageously awesome," captain Kathy Feeney 'O9 said.
The race on Friday was especially impressive considering the difficulty that the past two weeks had
brought the team after an accident involving one of
their teammates, Mairin Din 'l2. Din collided with a
vehicle while cycling near the campus on Oct. L Her
injury has been emotionally devastating for the both
women's and men's team. Despite such unfortunate
event, the Garnet channeled a lot of hope and optimism, bringing them closer as a team. "I know I had
Mairin in my thoughts during the race on Friday.
For me, it's easier to pull through the finish when
you're running for something greater than yourself," Kathy Feeney said.
The Garnet's performance on Friday demonstrates the team spirit they strive for: a uniquely
solid bond as teammates and as friends. "We work
through our races together. I think our performance
on Friday proves this. Not only did everyone run
either negative mile splits or faster than what our
coaches projected for us, but out of nearly forty
teams in the race, we had the smallest spread (the
span of time in which your first five runners crossthe line)," Faith Pampel 'O9, a co-captain, said.
The women's team will compete next in Seven
Sisters at Smith College at the end offall break. The
men's team will race at the DeSales University

So it is clear that sports teams

influence fans, but can fans truly
influence sports teams or is that
just something athletes say to
appease the masses? According to
some researchers, they can. In an
article published in the Journal
of Sports and Recreation,
researchers at Michigan State
and Northern Illinois University
showed that athletes were able to
complete well-learned skills better in the presence ofothers than
they were without an audience.
This is considered a major part of
what is known as home field
advantage.

While many aspects of the
home field can contribute to an
athlete's increased performance,
such as a familiar field or prejudiced refereeing, when asked athletes responded that it was the
positive effects of a home audience as opposed to a more hostile
road one that they felt was
responsible for their increased
abilities to play. This has been

supported by more experimental
data at several colleges.
Journalists at Rensselaer
Polytechnic University in New
York found that their hockey
team's performance at home
games was connected to the number of fans in attendance. When
attendance was over 4,000 the
team was 3-0 where as they were
only 5-7 when the crowd was
under 3,000.1 don't deny that this
,

data could be skewed because of
several other variables, but it
does bring to light interesting
questions about whether sports
fans can influence the outcome of
a game (that is to say, without
prematurely rushing the field
like the Stanford band or streaking across the ice).
My point in spending so much
time on this seemingly mundane
part of sports is twofold: first, to
prove once and for all that the
Sharks record breaking 11 game
winning streak last year was, in
fact, started because I attended
their first win against the Flyers,

and second, to try to convince
more students to come out and
support Swarthmore sports (especially the women's soccer team,
but I'm told those other fall teams
are important too).
The evidence may not be overwhelming or even completely
believable that fans play a role in
helping teams win, but there is
evidence. For those ardent
Garnet fans who are at every
game, you have athletes' eternal
thanks. For those who have not
made it out yet, I encourage you
to come at least once. You never
know, you might have so much
fun that you could even find yourself wanting to come back.

Despite valiant effort, volleyball succumbs to Terror

The Swarthmore Women's Volleyball

Team (5-13, CC 1-2) battled McDaniel
College in a fierce four-set Centennial
Conference match this past Saturday.
Though the Garnet would fall 3-1 (25-21,1525, 27-25, 25-15) to McDaniel's Green
Terror, the match was a thrill of turn-

-

arounds and near-win situations.
For most of the first set, the women's
play seemed impeccable. Gaining the lead
in the third point through a service ace by
Genny Pezzola 'l2, the Garnet would hold
onto the lead and widen it until a 20-16
margin forced McDaniel into taking a
timeout. McDaniel would strike back,
with unexpected tenacity, and capitalize
on a few Swarthmore errors to win nine of
the next ten points, taking the set 25-21.
The Garnet would crush what little
momentum their opponents had gained
and take the second set, 25-15. The third
set proved unpredictable with the lead
changing often. Notably, two serving continuums by Sarah Lambert 'll scored a
total of nine points to keep the Garnet in
the game. The first came in the beginning,
with Lambert serving four times to bring
the women to 8-L The second came after
McDaniel had taken the lead Lambert
would first supply a kill and follow with
five unreturnable serves.
Though McDaniel would eventually
win the third and fourth sets, the Garnet
proved again that they could play ferocious and outstanding volleyball. During
this match, senior libero Erin Heaney
broke the school record set by Erica
George 'O7 of 1,477 career digs to reach
-

1,483 digs.

Outside hitters Pezzola and Lambert
along with Jen Wang 'O9 would put on
memorable performances to pull the team
to a season-best hitting percentage of 142.
As has become customary this season,

and defensive presences. They would combine for 32 kills and 42 digs, more than
half of the team's cumulative kills and
digs.

Coach Harleigh Chwastyk commented
later, "I felt our effort was more consistent," adding that the women were never
"rattled" during the match. The women
handled the presence of McDaniel's 6' 1"
middle hitter Taylor Hergott especially
well by serving tough.
Lambert echoed this, stating, "Our
team has been playing a lot better.
Realization that this is conferences now
has set in
I feel like everyone is playing
harder now." Swarthmore's conference
match against Washington College this
past Wednesday proved to be a clinic with
the women winning in three sets, 26-24, 2512, 25-18.
Chwastyk said that the team could not
have been satisfied with Saturday's result
and would work on tactics that would
make stronger in its remaining seven conference matches this semester. Chwastyk
highlighted that it was important to
"make it harder for [other] teams to tranand [for us] to have better comsition

munication."

Lambert added, "We just have to work
with the plans our coaches have for each
team we play, trust them, and trust that

we can play smart as a team and we
should be money." Each match the coaches have a game plan that focuses on playing to Swarthmore's strengths and their
opponent's weaknesses.
An addition to the 'coaching staff this
year is Anthony Yoshimura 'l2, who
Chwastyk describes as more of a "studentcoach." While in the past, Chwastyk has
hired students to work as record keepers

Women's soccer takes down McDaniel in sudden-death overtime

against conference rival McDaniel. Megan Colombo 'll

necting off a pass from Maggie DeLorme 'lO, who was
credited with the assist. Swarthmore improved to 7-2
with the win, and now stands at 3-1 in Centennial
Conference play.
Boasting a 26-4 shot advantage throughout regulation
play, it seemed a Garnet goal was coming more and more
within reach with each passing minute. Colombo's gamewinner came as no surprise after a series of chances that
seemed to pop up one after another. "It was frustrating
because we had a lot of opportunities," Colombo said.
She went on to note that the team was especially motivated after a double-overtime loss at home to Eastern.
Sure enough, the Garnet wasn't about to let it happen
again, turning the tables this time by dealing a similar
fate to McDaniel. The Green Terror dropped to 4-6 (1-2
CC) with the loss.
The goal was Colombo's fifth of the season, a teamhigh along with Elizabeth Mills 'IL Meanwhile, goalkeeper Lauren Walker 'O9, bolstered by a sturdy
Swarthmore defense who kept McDaniel's conferenceleading scorer, junior Brittany Baer, at bay, posted her
third shutout of the season. "[Defender] Cait [Mullarkey
'o9] and I have been playing together for four years, and
Laura [Bolger 'll] is really strong, so I'm totally comfort-

able," Walker said of her defense.
The Garnet women plan to make easy work of conference foe Bryn Mawr (4-6-1, 0-4 CC) this Thursday in a
home game scheduled for 7 p.m. But while the Owls are
not considered to be among the Garnet's list of toughest
opponents, Walker said that she recognizes the importance of taking each game seriously
including the

upcoming contest against Bryn Mawr. According to
Walker, it is "easy to get complacent." She and her team-

October 9, 2008

mates need to "keep our heads on straight," even against
less intimidating opponents.
Over the fall break, the team will travel to the west
coast to face off against #lB University of Redlands (7-2-1)
in Redlands, CA, on Tuesday, before hosting Muhlenberg
(5-3) on Wednesday in a conference matchup. Even
though the outcome of Monday's game may not be relevant to Centennial Conference fans, Swarthmore looks to
use the opportunity to continue to make its mark on the

national level.

Colombo said that she is looking forward to the
Redlands matchup: "[There is] not less pressure [playing
an out-of-conference team]. We try to approach every
game with the same intensity. We want to play well and
make a statement [in order to] work towards our goal
of getting into the national championship."
Taylor Rhodes 'lO, a Redlands native, said that she
looks forward to the rare opportunity to play at home in
front of her friends and family. Aside from having the
team stay at her house during the trip, she is eager to
"play in front of a lot of girls [from home] and their families. Hopefully we'll come out with a win."
Swarthmore is currently ranked fifth in the MidAtlantic Region by the NCAA, and looks to break into the
national rankings with a win over Redlands next week.
With knocking off the College of New Jersey, the #lteam in the nation to their credit this season, it
seems the Garnet are only a few goals away from reach...

ing untapped potential.
