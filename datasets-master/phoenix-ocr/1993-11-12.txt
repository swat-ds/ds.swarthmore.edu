"Gay Bash '93"

New Hope neo-Nazi march draws protestors
By Frank Kuo-Hui Yu
About eighty members of the
USA Nationalist Party and Nazi
Skinheads held their hour-long
"Gay Bash '93" rally at Washington Crossing HistoricPark near New
Hope, in Bucks County, on Saturday.
Near a park entrance close to
the rally, two hundred people made
an effort to counterprotest the demonstration and held a rally entitled
"Confront Hatred." Among them
were students, community residents, and members from ACTUP, Grassroots Queers, Anti-Racist Action, National Women's
Rights Organizing Coalition, and
others. The neo-Nazi groups, originally planning to hold a march in
New Hope, canceled their plan for
fear that a parade might turn violent.
Three hundredpolice officers,
clad in riot helmets and carrying
black batons, outnumbered both
groupsand kept them apart. No one
was hurt in the rally or
counterdemonstration. The only
arrest was of a Nazi teenager who
was picked up for underage drinking. There were also 60 news people
present to report the incident.

Eight S warthmore students attended the "Confront Hatred"
march. They included Mary Helen
Dupree '96, Kate Ellsworth '96,
Justin Paulson '96, Heather
Repenning '96, Tim Hunt '97,
Annika Stroope '97, Cameron
'97,
Warner
and Katie
Klingensmith '97.
Dupree, Ellsworth, and
Paulson said some socialists and
anarchists attempted to turn the
counter-rally to their agenda and
shouted slogans not pertaining to
confronting hatred toward gays.
For example,they heard some
people shouting "Remember the
holocaust!" Moreover, the disunity
caused by the presence of numerous different organizations annoyed
the Swarthmore students who had
wishedfor a more focusedand unified protest
Dupree, Ellsworth, and
Paulson all said they respect the
rights of the neo-Nazi groups to
protest but also think that it's the
rights of people who don't agree
with their sentiments to
counterprotest. They therefore
chose to manifest their support for
gay rights by their presence in the
counterprotest.

Since many studentsregularly
participate in volunteer community
service at Swarthmore, the Curriculum Task Force last year began
to explore ways in which community-based learning could be connected to academic course work.
While many members of the faculty believed that the notion was a
good one in principle, they believed
that the "possibilities and pitfalls"
ofputting the idea into practice had
to be more closely studied.
Psychology professor Barry
Schwartz was entrusted with the
responsibility of seeing what aspects of this idea are "already done
here and what is done at other
.places." By spring break, he will
■have completed a report which he
expects the faculty to review upon
culminationof discussionabout the
Honors program.
Itis generally agreed that community service and the experience
it confers is in itself valuable, but it
is not agreed that this should be
granted credit that is otherwise reserved only for academic pursuits.
While Schwartz finds "nothing
wrong with serving meals to homeless people," what he envisions is
a type of community service which
makes "people reflective of what
they are doing in the community
and connect it to their academic
work."
Many courses in education and
some in the sociology and psychology departments currently require
work in some outside community
organization. Similarly, the public
policy concentration is "set up so
that every student has to do an
internship between his junior and
senior years." In other cases, studentsobtaincredit for summer work
through an independent study ar-

rangement.
Schwartz acknowledges that
this linking ofcommunity and classroom learning is harder to achieve
in the naturalsciences. One exception is environmental studies, in
which students could assess air or
water quality in a particular area.
If such activities are to be expanded, there are many questions
that Schwartz believes must be answered. Would work in the community be in the form of summer
internships or a certain number of
hours per week during the semester? Does Swarthmore have the
resources and the willingness to
commit to such a program? What
form of administrative assistance
would be needed "to set up and
maintain contacts with community
organizations?" Will professors
be able to assume the extraresponsibilitiesthat suchprograms would
entail without having to stop teaching some classes? "Will communities effectively become guinea
pigs" for Swarthmore students?
In Schwartz's opinion, there
are definite advantages to be gained
from the interactionbetweenclassroom and community learning.
Thoughts derivedfromreading can
be revealed in a community organization. The combination letsyou

organization in
ways that you might not otherwise
have been able to do.
"Conversely, community experience gets you to scrutinize the
reading more often than you otherwise would; you might ask, 'ls this
idealization [in the reading] making it easier to understand what is
going on or is it distorting what is
really going on?'"
Since large universities have
graduate students with more skills
to contribute to an organization than
undergraduates have, they typically
contribute to the

devote more of their resources to
such community-based learning
programs. According to Schwartz,
President Bloom has received a
grant with which he can initiate the
development of new courses for
such a program. The College must
now decide how to allocate these
funds.
A large-scale summer internship program for students would be
quite expensive since the college
would have to provide summer stipends to cover expenses. Furthermore, students on financial aid
would have to be compensated for
earnings they are expected to make
during the summer.
A part-time position could be
created to maintain contacts with
outside organizations and a few faculty members could be given stipends in order to develop new
courses during the summer, options
which would require fewer financial resources.
In talking to students who are
currently involved in community
service activities, Schwartz was
somewhat surprisedby thereaction
ofsome students to these proposals.
According to these conversations,
"they like having something that
mattersto them thatis not acourse."
Even though they recognize that
they could devote more time to their
activities if they were more integrated into the academic program,
the students still express the desire
to keep their community work separate from academics.
While many of these issues
have yet to be resolved, Schwartz
does not see them as "insurmountable difficulties." Although nothing is certain at this point, he does
envision the possibility of having
summer internship programs in
place in certain departments within
the next year.

Phyllis Fry departs from the College
By Mark Osterweil
In mid-September the computing center lost one of its most
respected and appreciated staffers.
Phyllis Fry, whohadbeen the computer center's social science coordinator for two and a half years,
left quietly, but not without making a lot of people very upset and
confused as to the nature of her
sudden departure.
Whenasked about Phyllis' resignation, Margaret Patterson echoed the thoughts of faculty and
students alike: "I was shocked."
In an interview withThePhoenix, Phyllis toldher story withsadness and resignation: "I wouldnot
have chosen to leave Swarthmore
in this particular way," said Fry, "it
didn't have to be ugly."
When asked about the reason
for her forced resignation, Phyllis
couldn't really come up with one.
Apparently she had been, quite by
surprise, confronted by Directors
ofComputingand Communication
Services Judy Downing and Pro-

fessor Boccio. In a meeting which
Fry described as tense, Downing,
without explanation, asked Fry to
"commit to changing your attitude
and behavior or think about moving on."
When Fry asked for an explanation as to what was meant by
4
attitude' there was no answer. Prepared for dialogue, Fry was anxious to understand the accusations
against her and told Downing that
she would be happy to discuss the
nature of the concerns. Downing
responded by informing her that if
she were to stay there would be no
dialogue and that she would be
told how to radically change her
behavior.
However difficult the decision, Fry felt that she had been
presented with an ultimatum for
which she had been given no explanation. He decision, however
painful, was resignation.
Always concerned for the
people who depended on her, Fry
offered to continue in her capacity
as coordinator and instructor for

Ec/Soc-Anth 39 until a replacement
could be found. The Computing
Center declinedher offer and after
two meetings, Phyllis emptied her
office and left.
When the Phoenix contacted
Boccio and Downing for an interview, they declined to comment.
The 'Try" story seemed, however,
to have touched a sensitive spot.
Phyllis Fry hadbeen a hardworking
employee, always committed to the
people who depended on her.
In addition to her computing
responsibilities, Fry was also a
dedicated member of the College
community. As well as being active with the SAGER committee,
she spearheaded the effort to renovate the Women's Resource Center. Fry was thefirst to mentionthe
idea of renovating the building
and then made sure it got done.
The abrupt end of Fry's career at Swarthmore is a loss for all
those of us who knew her or who
directly or indirectly benefited
from her efforts. She will be
missed.

There will be an ALL WOMEN'S MEETING at3:oo p-m* SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21, IN LANG PAC CINEMA to VOTE on an administrative structure for theWomen's Resource

Visiting professor lectures
on "Performing Lesbian"
By Frank Kuo-Hui Yu and Michael Brus
Sue-Ellen Case, Swarthmore's Lang
Visiting Professor of Social Change, lectured on "Performing Lesbian" on Wednesday, November 10 in thePAC.
Case is currently teaching the Queer
Studies course in the Theater Department
and will teach an English course next semester before returning to the University of
California at Riverside, where she is a professor ofEnglish andWomen's Studies. She
has written four books and is working on
another, which deals with topics she discussed in her lecture.
She hopes that her lectureand teaching
at Swarthmore can "signal a beginning" for
Swarthmore's curricular development in Gay
and Lesbian Studies. Some schools—including NYU, Berkeley, and Duke —already
have some sort of Gay and Lesbian Studies.
When asked about how she feels about
teaching at Swarthmore, she said, "The fifteen students in my class are engaged and
willing to experiment [with] all sorts of theatrical forms and various issues." Tentatively, she will offer an openclass session for
those students who want to attend her class
called "Queer Performance." Although she
appreciates the cordiality of Swarthmore
College, she feels "[it is] isolating to be the
only self-identifiedlesbian on the faculty" at
Swarthmore.
Case prefaced her lecture by stating her
desire for a Lesbian and Gay Studies programandfor therecruitment ofmore lesbian
professors. Her lecture, she said, was in-

spired by an epiphany she had while typing
on her computer. As her academic text was
interrupted by e-mailnotices and otherMacintosh icons, she realized that what used to be
regarded as isolated academic study was
being subsumed by the information superhighways of Internet and other technology.
She extended this analogyby mentioning the
disappearance of the interior self in the face
of the technological revolution. "The notion
that the interior condition could subsume
material conditions has ended," she stated.
She then related this theme to lesbianism by showing how recent medical advances, including recombinant-DNA technology, have made the concept of the transvestite obsolete. It might now be termed
"techno-millennial drag," whichinvolves the
"melting of flesh to technology."
She expanded the horizon of performing devices by the possibility of changing the
flesh of one's body. Transsexuals, for example, reconstruct their body by technologies such as injection of hormones and removalofbreasts. She furtherrelates this new
horizon to the concept of virtual reality.
In using the term transsexual, she distinguished between a person who crosses sex
lines—one who undergoes a physical operation—and one who crosses gender lines
that is, who defies his/her socially-constructed
gender roles.
The audience, mostly faculty and some
students, applauded the lecture. Sue-Ellen
Case brought the audience into a new realm
that links lesbianism, performance, and tech—

nology together.

STANFORD, California—After three
years ofdebate and rewriting, Stanford University officials enacted a new policy in early
October thatdealswith sexualharassment on
campus.
Unlike policies at some other institutions, Stanford's does not prohibit consensual relationships between students and professors, but does warn that there are risks
involved when the relationship is between
individuals in "inherentlyunequalpositions."
The policy states that those relationships may be "less consensual than the indi-

vidual whose position confers power believes."
The policy "comes down squarely on the
side of confidentiality," said President
Gerhard Casper, regarding the conflict between the desire "to establish records oftransgressions that can be reviewed later" and the
assurance of confidentiality that would encourage people to come forward.

.media were eager to stirup hostile feelings in the public.
Ellsworth, who organized Swarthmore students to attend theprotest, discerned that the
police displayed hostility toward the counterprotestors. "They [the police officers] were
very hostile to the counterprotestors. It's as if they were there to protect the Nazis."
Furthermore, she cites an example, "It was very cold. When we wanted to leave, the police
wouldn't let us go to the car."
Despite some unpleasant moments in the protest, the Swarthmore students valued this
experience and are happy that they undertook this political action. Paulson summed up the
group sentiment: "I'm glad that I was there. Our initial objective was met; they (the Nazis]
did not march intoNew Hope. Regardless of the disunity of the counterprotestors, the New
Hope residents together with the counterprotestors prevented them [again, the Nazis] from
marching to New Hope."

November 12, 1993

Political scholar Ira Katznelson, in the
last of this semester's three Cooper lectures
on "Forging Democracy in America", blamed
NewDeal discriminationfor the racial strife
that still persists in America today. This
unconventional argument carried on some of
the themesof theprevious Cooper lecture, by
Theda Skocpol, who discussed the historical
struggles of African-Americans.
Katznelson is the Dean of GraduateFaculty at the New School for Social Research
and will soon move to Columbia to chair the
history and political science departments. He
has writtenfive books and founded a journal,
Politics and Society.
Following the model of investigating
historical events first from the margins, last
from the center, Katznelson argued that the
New Deal was founded on a "tightly segregated economy" that relegated most AfricanAmericans to low-class labor. Heagrees with
Skocpol, but not with the majority ofhistorians, led by Thomas and Mary Edsall, who
preach a simplified and "complacent" tale of
the decline of the New Deal liberal legacy in
the 1960'5.In fact, Katznelson gives most of
the credit for Democratic egalitarianism to
Lyndon Johnson.
Paradoxically, LBJ's reforms only polarized the parties and drove the Southern
Democrats into the arms of the Republicans,
taking the White House away from the left
for 20 out of 24 years. Katznelson blames
party leaders, especially Democrats, for failing to stand up to the new coalition of conservatives and racists, against taxes, affirmative
action and busing, that stood behind
Goldwater, Wallace, Nixon, and Reagan.
"The marriage of semi-populist conservatism and racism worked," he said.
Katznelson believes that the government knew of thealmost unlimitedpossibilities for fast reform, but sometimes backpedaled in order to maintain the approval of
the powerful Southern Democrats.
"Katznelson rejects the idea that all roads in
history lead to the status quo, to American
exceptionalism," said political science professor Carol Nackenoff while introducing
her former dissertation reader. "It was not
inevitable that the New Deal potential to
forge a social democratic agenda would be
arrested."
The Roosevelt administration, according to Katznelson, kowtowed to the "authoritarian single party" that ruled the South,
guilty of "racial exclusion," by leaving state
and local governments free to pass Jim Crow
laws. He has referred to a "Southern veto."
For example, an anti-lynching law was defeated in the 1940's after Congressman
Rankin's warnings that the Democrats, if
crossed, would strike back by obstructing
legislation. The Fair Labor Standards Act, a

1937 minimum wage and maximum hours
bill, pitted the Northern Democrats against
the Republicans and Southern Democrats.
"The Democrats' pact with racism" in "the
elite white South" defeated the bill, and the
minimum wage fell from 40 to 25 cents. The
TV A and CCC were "thoroughly racist;"
Katznelson charges that sinceRoosevelt considered African-Americans "expendable,"
they were targeted less by explicit racial laws
thanby laws that degradedtraditionally black
jobs in traditionally black areas. Ironically,
the repression ofblacks in the South brought
a "Golden Age" to their white competitors.
The problem continues today.
Katznelson said that the residents of today's
ghettoes can trace their fate to "parents and
grandparents who were excluded from the
largesse of the New Deal." He also claimed
that "tax-and-spend" economics was born
during theNew Deal, along with the policy of
keeping "employment down and military and
pork-barrel spending up." Heavy-wallet PAC
lobbying also started gaining power during
the New Deal.
Katznelson believes that the Roosevelt
administration'sracialpolicy was "more than
morally reprehensible," possibly heartless
but not sadistic; it "didn't so much choose to
institutionalizeracism" as subordinateracial
equality to "more important goals." At least
Roosevelt believed reelection, World War II
fortification, and victory in Congress were
more important. Race was treated as "nonessential," a "nuisance" and a "side show," not
a "profound challenge."
Katznelson also attacked the textbooks
of the mid-century. A 1948text on American
government devoted three "bland and complacent" pages, out of 1135, to "race, segregation, and disenfranchisement." Historians
are waking up-slowly. A fairly new book,
The Rise and Fall of the New Deal Order,
mentions race only when discussing the fall.
According toKatznelson, America needs
a less racist, more integrated Democratic
party. Clintonhas tried toredefine the Democrats, but racially insensitive strategic moves,
such as rebuking Jesse Jackson and proudly
upholding the death penalty, have reversed
his efforts. Katznelson ended his lecture by
touting Lyndon Johnson as the champion of
the onebrief, shining moment in Democratic
racial history; he should be admired not for
completing the New Deal legacy, but "for
having bid the New Deal good-bye."
The lecture series, organized by political science professors Carol Nackenoff and
Rick Valelly, was primarily sponsoredby the
William J. Cooper Foundation and the Department ofPolitical Science. The other sponsors were the Departments of Economicsand
History, the Swarthmore African-American
Students Society (SASS), and the Forum for
Free Speech.

Have you kissed your
Republican lately?
By Alan Philips via the College Press
Service
LINCOLN, Nebraska—CollegeRepublicans at the University ofNebraska put their
mouths where the money was recently at a
homecoming week kissing booth.
Trent Steele, standing with otherRepublicans behind a table set up on a campus plaza,
said he hadkissed two people by noon during
the first 45 minutes of the booth's operation.
"There was another person who I thought
was going to kiss me," he said, "and then she
said it just wasn't worth it. I was hurt."
Fifty cents was the toll for a peck on the
cheek from the Republicans of both sexes
staffing the booth. Jennifer Vogelsberge, a
seniorbroadcasting major, plunked down her
change for Steele. She saidit was money well
spent.
"It definitely was," she said. "Especially
if it's a good cause."
College Republicans planned to donate
the booth's proceeds to a pregnancy center.
Kissers said they earned about $lO in their
first hour.
Andrew Signerson, a first-year law student and College Republican, strode up behind the booth about noon. He said he was
ready to kiss people.
"As long as it's with the opposite sex,"
he said.

Posters around campus advertising the
booth urged students to stop by and smooch
Republicans in support of Christopher Columbus, homecoming and heterosexuality.
Among the booth's ground rules was a prohibition on same-sex kissing.
As Republicans talked amongst themselves and occasionally enticed passersby to
kiss them, about six students arrived nearby
wearing pink triangle "safe place" stickers
and holding a sign saying "Queers Approve
of P.D. A." (Public Displays of Affection)
One of the students, Scott Roewer, a
junior music education major, said he and his
friends supported the College Republicans'
public puckering.
"We're just showing that we approve of
them displaying their sexuality," he said.
Christopher Becerra, sign in hand, said
he agreed with Roewer. But homecoming
week should include homosexuals, the general studies freshman said.
"They said heterosexuality is pushed
aside during Coming Out Week," he said.
"But homosexuality is pushed away all the
time."
Most students walking through the plaza
seemed to pay little attention to either group.
Freshman Dave Weisser, sitting on the edge
of a fountain with a friend, took it all in.
"I think it'skind of funny," he said. "Ah,
college."

A Case for the Children of the Canon
Normally we, the co-Editors-in-Chief, brainstorm on an editorial topic and come to an
agreement on some topic or other by the middle ofthe week. Unfortunately the sounding board
has dryrotted. So what we decided to do is provide you with a discourse which will display some
opinions ofyour co-Editors on a topic which you can't escape Swarthmore without addressing.
We do not promise that we are going to be diametrically opposed to each other (see
Point»Counterpointfor this type ofargument) or that we will even stage a debate on an issue of
mutual harmony. Itis not theblack orthe white that most separates us ideologically, but the more
compelling shades ofgray that we see, or don't see, most differently.
K. I got a topic to talk about.
I. Oh, what's that?
K. The canon...the literary canon. That topic of unavoidability in Swat's multicultural
curriculum.
I. Ah, you wantto compare the classics with the contemps?
K. I might as well, since our curriculum refuses to do50..D0 you see whatI'm saying?
I. In various cases, but I see it as a very conscious effort on Swarthmore'sport to remove the
questfonof"legitimateversusMegaimate.'' I'vealwaysconsidereditaquestionofwho'stosay?"
K. But infrail attempts to remove such questions, we are only avoiding these questions...in a
sense, displacing them. Its not thatI'ma majorproponent of the preservation of the canon—/. No?
Come, come! You're the only person I know whocites Eliot, Milton,Shakespeare, and
Thoreau like they were your personal friends.
K. In a sense, they are my friends. (You know life at a boys'prep school.) They are an
undeniably significant part of my educational experience, and an equally significant part of the
experiences ofthose contemps to whomyou allude. That's whyI have trouble making complete
sense of contemps—even minority contemps—outside of the contextof the whitemale heroesabout
whomI've learned.
I. Ahh, so the study of someone like a JamesBaldwin is inherently related to the study oftheir
canonized literary predecessors? For example, would the work ofLangstonHughes, as a poet,
reflect the work ofWalt Whitman?

Phyllis would be proud
By Alyssa Apsel and
Marybeth Lenkevich
Well.. .we allheard theconservative earful
from thePowerfulPositive Woman, Mrs. Phyllis
Schlafly. We saw theChanelsuitand even tried to
trace her trainof thought and thinly veiled "logical" argument. We, With Bared Teeth, even listened to the NancyReagan throwbackabout that
favorite topic(ornon-event)—sexual harassment
Apparently, Phyllis Schlafly, in her infinite wisdom, hasfound a solution to women's woes in the
workplace—besides the obvious barefoot and
pregnant scenario. As a career woman, she who is
"virtuous" will not be subjected to unwanted and
unwarranted (as all feminists are stupid, heinous
and can't get men) advances from those "jerks"
called men. We've stopped gagging long enough
to put two and two together to get some semblance
ofher3 l/2centson"thevirtuouswoman.""What
is a vinous woman?" you ask? Well, due to the
obvious ambiguities of said well-thought-out
theory of women, we, With Bared Teeth, have
taken itupon ourselves to sketch out said theory.
We have, yet again, proven ourselves worthy of
the task of defining these terms. Never again will
awomanaskherself,"Amlvirtuous?"Forourtest
can assure accuracy and precision in dealing with
such delicate and career-defining questions,
(ahem...) Rest easy, for our TRIED & TRUE
TEST OF THE TRULY VIRTUOUS
WOMAN really works! Scoff not!
1.You are walking down the street and
a man calls after you. "Hey baby, nice hair. It
would be even better brushing against my
thighs." You:
a) Walk faster, hoping this is not someone you have dated or hooked up with.
b) Turn aroundand get his number for a
rainy day.
c) Ignore him.
d) Gasp in shock and shame, fall down on
your knees, clasp yourhands and beg God for
forgiveness for the sins that have brought this
beastly wrath upon you.
2. Your boss brushes up against you as
you bend over at the water cooler. He looks
you up and down and says, "Wow, you've got
SOME legs! You should wear short skirts
more often. By the way. I'd like you to work
late tonight. I need someone to take Dictation, (nudge, nudge)" You:
a) Request that he "do" you right there
and then since you have errands to run after
work. (Sweeping the books and pencils off
your desk as you speak).
b) Say, "Do you kiss your mother with
that mouth, A—hole?"
c) Quit your job, go on welfare, have lots
of kids.
d) Realize that you wore too muchmakeup, fall down on yourknees, clasp your hands
and beg God for forgiveness for the sins that
have brought this beastly wrath upon you.
3. You are at party (try to relate) and
the ever gracious and very drunkhost offers to
lick you up and downlike a postage stamp, all
while breathing heavily in your ear and groping you with those Russian fingers. You:
a) Helpfully suggest the pile of coats in
the other room as the perfect cushion for this
oh-so-romatic interlude.
b) Use your right knee to your advantage
and rack him right then and there. Kick him
vigorously as he writhes in pain on the floor.
Pour your drink on his head.

c) Explain politely that he is drunk and
you are not interested in his reindeer games.
d) Realize that you should never have
been in the presence of alcohol, you should
have left when the cider ran out, fall down on
your knees, clasp yourhands and beg God for
forgiveness for thesins that have brought this
beastly wrath upon you.
4. You go to your much older and
married professor for extra help before an
exam, he places his hand on your thigh and
looks lasciviously into your eyes. You:
a) Brush away his hand and continue
asking your questions.
b) Put your hand on his thigh and hope
that this will get you a B+. After all, this is
Swarthmore, anywhere else it would have
been an "A."
c) Ask him ifhis wifeis intomenage-a-trois.
d) Realize that women don't belong in
college, since you are wasting away your
childbearing years, fall down on yourknees,
clasp your hands and beg God for forgiveness
for the sins that have brought this beastly
wrath upon you.
5.The phonerings. You pick it up only
to hear heavy breathing and obsceneremarks
including references to leather, submission
and farm animals. You:
a) Ask him when and where. (Especially
if he's from the North and wears bells on his
toes.)
b) Pull out yourrape whistle and blow it
into the phone as loud as possible. Keep
calling back and doing the same thing, at all
hours of the day and night.
c) Hang up.
d) Realize that you should havelet a man
answer the phone, women have no place
dealing with technology like this, fall down
on yourknees, clasp your hands and beg God
for forgiveness for the sins that have brought
this beastly wrath upon you.

interests of the institution.
Interestingly enough, thedecision to impose
the costs of doing good on a single generation of
studentsrather than making an institutional commitment to it led to a windfall. According to
College treasurer Sue Welsh, nearly $2 million
($1,970,000 to be exact) was reserved from the
budget over the seven years of divestment to
defray the costs of divestment- As it turned out,
though, the College has missed only about
$917,000 in potential returns as a result of the
move. The endowment has, therefore, been overpaid $1,053,000 by the last seven years' student
body.
That million dollars—toround the figure
slightly—constitutes the legacy of the institutional conservatism I discussed above. It is die
residue of the moral commitment of the generation of students who made the case that it was
worthwhile to take a firm, institutional stand
against apartheid. It is, in the last analysis, the
fragment of theinstitutional conscience that, for a

moment mSwarthmore'shistory,rnanaged to put the institutional life of the

college in line with its intellectual and
moralclaims.
Swarthmore desperately needs to
remember that there was a time and a
political climate whenit was willing to
take principled stands as an institution.
It needs that million dollars as a constant and living reminder ofits distrust
toward the project of divestmentand its
pessimism toward SouthAfrican freedom.
Toward that end, I propose that
the $1 million surplus be set aside to
endow an institutional conscience, an
enduring legacy of Swarthmore's onetime commitmenttotheliberatory needs
of the people our endowment affects.
According to the Swarthmore
Treasurer's Report, an endowment of
$ 1 million can reasonably be expected

to yield somewherearound $40,000 of
budget-ready income each year. Forty
thousand is not enough to provide an
institutional conscience, but it would
be a very good start.
With $30,000 of the yearly return, the College would provide a
full scholarship—tuition, room,
board, and travel—for a studentwith
a deep commitment to social change,
preferably a student from outside the
U.S.
With the other $lO,OOO, two annual fellowships ofup to $5,000 each
would be provided to students to support combined activist and academic
work in race and racism, African affairs, international solidarity, and relatedfields. Students could use themto
deal withany problem withinthat general framework: from the racial breakdown of Swarthmore's staff to the international dynamics surrounding
South African liberation. The fellow-

ships would cover travel, a stipend,
materials, research fees, and other expenses, and would beadministered by
a committee of students, faculty, and
staff.
It's fair for Swarthmore to be
itchy to reinvest in the seemingly lucrativeSouthAfrican marketplace, although as I've argued before, I think
it'stooearlyfor thatBut we shouldnot
forget that the endowment suffered
noneofthe"pain"of divestment;rather,
the students of the day suffered the
financial consequences and the endowment, for its part, enjoyed a minor
windfall.
It's time for us to cash in on that
windfall. Swarthmore was wrong to
shove its institutionalconscience to the
margins of its balance sheets, and it
shouldput aside thefruits ofits wishywashy politics as a permanent markof
the time it took a principled stand for
freedom.

examine, not praise
Common Sense
By Matt Trebelhorn
As usual, the arrival of the new Common Sense was a disappointment.
Looking past Phyllis Schlafly, though, I saw something that troubled me.
LurkingbnpagetwoofC<>/n^
some very confused statements. Mote baffling than the Young Americans
for Freedom themselves, this seeming torrent of "liberal" support for
Common Sense represents a basic misunderstanding of the issues at stake.
The letters-—there were ten of them— were aU variations on thethemeof "I
disagree with what you are saying, but I will defend to thedeath your right
to say it."
There are several themes which run throughout these ten letters. The
first I will mentionis thatoffree speech. The ConservativeUnion framedthis
debateand made theFirst Amendment an issue. The letter-writers have
accepted this as the case. I ask you to look again at the logic. The Office of
thePresident sponsored Phyllis Schlafly. Last year, many of the writers for
CommonSense were able to air theirviews in ThePhoenix.The Conservative
UnionisanacceptedSwarthmoreCollegeorganization.Theorgansofpower
here at Swatdon' t seemto be stomping outthis smallgroup ofconservatives.
In fact, the ideologies representedby theConservatives seem to be irrelevant
to their relationship to the administration—they are treated as any other
organization would be. Theirrights to free speech have notbeenchallenged,
much less denied.Liberals shouldnot leap to thedefenseoftheconservatives
on First Arhendment grounds. If the day comes when they are threatened
because of their ideologies, I will defend theirright to speak. Until that day,
I will say thatI find the views represented by their group repugnant.
Another theme in the ten letters Was that of maintaining a balance or a
diversity of opinions. Again, the "liberals" who use this argument are
accepting the debateon the conservatives* terms. There are two methods by
which One could attack this idea. The first is simply that the Conservatives
are mocking the tradition of tolerance and diversity. They use the language
of diversity to justify their existence while attempting to spread ideas of
intolerance.The secondcriticism of this argument is this: Nobody complains
about the lack of neo-Nazis on this campus. There isn't a Swarthmore
Coalitionof Gay-Bashers. There is no group on campus which advocates
torture and murder as political instruments. (While I do not accuse the
ConservativeUnion of these offenses, it shouldbe noted that my examples
areaHpartofthecontmuumofcon^
decisionsaboutourselves through the organizations we joinand support To
support an organization justbecause it would shake things up is, taken to the
extreme, to welcome Nazis to campus. We should not blindly praise
Common Sense simply because it causes debate. The Conservative Union
should be discussed on the merit, not on the novelty of their ideas.
I willnot praise CommonSense I will not congratulate themfor haUing
Oliver North as a hero, I will not thankthem for thoughtless attacks on what
they call "P.C." I refuse to extol thevirtues of a Reagan apologist I will not
applaud jingoism, hatred, or homophobia. Rather than standing around and
flattering thereactionarieswho vmtefocCommonSense onthe "debate''they

conservatives. They will crumble under their own weight

Swat is in Wonderland
To the Editors:

I want to thank you for providing dinner-table entertainment for
our family recently. The article in
the October 1 issue [of The Phoenix] about the "ongoing struggle to
define multiculturalism," as theprincipal occupation of the new Associate Dean of Multicultural Affairs,
gave us all a good laugh with its
insight into just what college deans
do all day. It sent my scurrying for
my copy of Lewis Carroll where I
found my favorite quote from
Humpty Dumpty: "When I use a
word," he said in a rather scornful
tone, "it means just what I choose it
to mean neither morenor less." The
King of Hearts completes the rea-

soning whenhe says, elsewhere, "If
there's no meaning in it, that saves
a world of trouble, you know, as we
needn't try to find any."
Furthermore, I am grateful to
the Swarthmore administration for
clearing up something that has long
puzzled me. I teach in college, and
am grossly underpaid, and yet my
daughter attends college at the yearly
cost of a King's ransom. Now I know
where the money goes. On a more
serious note, however, it does seem
like a dirty trick to put a nice-looking
African-American like Joe Mason
into a position where he can only
succeed by copying Lewis Carroll.

Abortion:The Promiscuous
Male's Best Choice
By Read Mercer Schuchardt
Anxious liberals will once again be gathering at Swarthmore this weekend to defend and
promote their guaranteed right to murder their
young. Not satisfied with the diabolicallaws they
have already enacted, these Darwin-thumping
liberal fundamentalists will focus on more efficient and improved murders, with big daddy
government footing the bill.
But dem's fightin' words.
Let me start again: Various pro-choice representatives will meet this weekend to discuss
future ways in which they can guarantee safe and
affordable reproductive rights for all women,
irrespective of race, class, or sexual orientation.
Now thatsoundsbetter. Nothing accusatory,
sensational, controversial, or for that matter, true.
Then again, total hypocrisy is what one should
expect from thepeople who justwon a major antichoice vote in the California school voucher
proposal.
In my opinion, the abortion debate is hot
enough to be theimmediatecause ofthe next civil
war (it has already inspired some zealots to take
the law into their own hands), so I will not mince
words on theissue. From the pro-life position, the
practice of abortion in mis country is a silent
holocaust—with the casualties well beyond
Hitler's figures, and the tollrising by over 4,000
daily. One in threepregnancies in this country are
currently terminated by abortion.
But to the deafened ears ofcommitted prochoice activists (such as our conference guests),
all this number reciting will sound like only so
much sentimental rot, and we cannotblame those
whoseeducations have permitted them to turn a
blindeye to thefacts ofmedical science, nor those
whose circumstances have betrayed their own
better instincts and hardened a once uncallused
heart If you cannot see the inescapable fact that a
fertilized egg is a human life, then no argument
will persuade you. And if you cannot tell the
differencebetween that lifedyingnaturally versus
being killed intentionally, then no argument on
your part will persuade me. Abortion eitheris or
is not murder. All the other arguments surrounding the debate are worthwhilebut secondary. The
pro-choice movement is successful exactly to the
degreeby which they make the primary argument
secondary in thepublic mind.
To say that being pro-choice does not mean
you personally accept abortion is completely
empty unlessyou have first decided that the fetus
is not human. The exact same argument was used
in thelast century bySouthern sympathizers in the
slavery debate: you can be pro-slavery while not
owning any slaves yourself as long as you agree
that the humanity of blacks is a matter relevant
only to the owner.
Pro-choicers generally like to portray the
enemyas religious bigots, hence thetitleof one of
this weekend's discussions, "The Far-Reaching
Tentacles of the Religious Right." hi truth, prolifers come in all shapes and sizes—from atheist
to homosexual to democrat—except one: the
single promiscuous heterosexual male. Thus, die
pro-life movement is not held together by a religious creed of any sort. Rather, it is comprised of
wildly varying segments of the population who
believe in individualresponsibility wherehuman
life is concerned. It is people who take the
constitution's guarantee seriously, people who
see that an inalienableright to life is a prerequisite
for enjoying any other type offreedom.
We believe mat the answer to being un-

wanted is not to be dead. The answer to
being poor is not tobe dead. The answer to
being physically or emotionally abused is
not to be dead. Webelieve that the answer
tolife's problems cannot be the negation of
life itself. One pro-choicer informed me
that unwanted children will growup poor,
neglected, abused, and will turn into mass
murderers. I thenasked him if he was for or
against the deathpenalty. He is against it
Thus, by his own logic, the unwanted
shouldbekilledbefore they become guilty
of a crime that me law can but shouldn'tkill
mem for. As a defense attorney, I imagine
hisplea wouldhavebeen, "Your honor, we
tried to kill this man long ago, and it is our
responsibility to protect him from the
unforgiving horror of the electric chair,
since theconditions that created his crime
were preventable by us who sitinjudgment
upon him."
The abortion-rights activists of this
weekend would do well to consider from
their own perspective just what they are
supporting. They claim to be supporting
women, helping women have better lives,
being pro-woman, etc. At last year's conference one leader proclaimed that "prolifers never consider the needs of the
woman." Thisls not only false, it is ridiculous in light of the true statement thatprochoicers never even discuss the possible
humanity of the developing fetus.
But see for yourself. Go to this
weekend'sconferenceand find out whether
the pro-choice movement has any set of
viability criteriaupon whichit is willing to
stand and say, "Beyond this point, abortion
is murder." You will discover not only a
lack of agreement on any criteria, but you
will find that nothing will satisfy the
movement's key leaders except abortion
on demand, whenever, no questions asked.
Death is legally definedas the cessation of
brainwaves. Ask them why they aren't
willing to let life be defined as the beginning of brainwaves.
And then find out just exactly how
pro-woman they are. They claim to be
genuinely concernedabout women' s mental and physical health. You will hearlotsof
contrived tear-jerking about how an unwanted child can ruin a woman's dreams
for career, marriage, freedom, and how an
abortion is physically safer than giving
birth. And you might conclude from these
facts that the only cure for pregnancy is
abortion. But ask the ruder questions and
see how they answer. Ask them why prochoice literature and conferences don't inform women that abortion will increase
theirrisk for breast cancer by fifty percent.
Why doesn'tit mention pelvic inflammatory disease increases of thirty percent? Why doesn't it
reveal that ninety percent of all post-abortive
women suffer mental illnesses ranging from depression to suicidaltendencies? Ask them why the
majority of post-abortive women are no longer
pro-choice. Ask them why they never have
memorial services or vigils for the thousands of
women who have died from "safe and legal"
hospital abortions. Their glad, free, and empowering speeches will quickly turn sour and they will
ultimately resort to taunting you with their infamous line, "Whose side are you on anyway?"
Good question.

Schlafly did not accomplish conservative goals
By Chuck Stevens
The Eventof theSemesterhas come and gone,and are we better
or worse for it? The hype for Phyllis Schlafly's speech caught the
public eye for a few days, and led to an atmosphere even more
politically charged thanusual (not entirely a good thingconsidering
dierancor that tends to accompany Swarthmore political dialogue.)
But such was undoubtedly the intent; theSwarthmore Conservative
Union tells us that the invitationofSchlafly and others will provide
diverseviewpoints and leave ourminds less strangledby smothering,
oppressive liberal dogma. Surely a questioning voice will cause
political self-examination. If only through sheer acrimony, such an
event can only nurture Swat's activist atmosphere.
There may well have been liberals on campus for whom the
Schlafly event represented a watershed moment in their intellectual
lives. Certainly, the effectofhearing conservative beliefsarticulated

If
about it. Terri Narkin, the Public Safety
department's secretary, keeps tabs on all the
crimes that occur on campus. Of course, that's
not all she does. She also directs lost visitors,
takes those glamorous ID pictures, and
wrestles with Swarthmore's student parking
shortage.
"In this office, there's always something
different going on," she observes. Today's
problem: "how to get thesmell ofskunk out of
a patrol car." According to Narkin, the unfortunate officer who took the car to be washed
"still smells. I'm not going near him now."
That wasn't security's first encounter
with the animal kingdom In the past, officers
have been called upon to remove a cat from
Parrish and a skunk from the vicinity of a
dorm. Sadly, that officer ended up fleeing
from the pesky little mammal. "We all wished
we had a picture of that," says Narkin wistfully.
Then there are always some calls that are
memorable for their sheer weirdness. One
report of a disturbance outside Parrish led to
the discovery of a male student dressed as
Peter Pan surrounded by other students calling him names.
Since "student ID's are like socks in the
washer and no one ever seems to find them,"
Narkin often faces the hard task of getting
people to cough up the $ 10 for a new one. She
has heard many excuses, including the favorite, "But I know it's at home in Chicago..."
Narkin's answer? "Yes dear, I'm sure it is, but
you're here, aren't you?"
From behind her desk in Ben West, she
has observed a wide sampling ofdelinquents.
"I used to think this was a job where you only

get to know people who are in trouble," she
says. However, she finds that the best part of
her vocation is working with her student
assistants. One student worked with her for
four years, and when he left, "I felt like my
son was leaving."
Narkin tries to help out students whenever she can. "When there are freshmen wandering around the first week of school and
they come in and ask questions, I try to be
patient." Narkin has a daughter in college,
and says, "I think having a college-age child
helps me relate. I know if that were my son or
daughter on a campus farfrom home, I would
want someone to help them."
Narkin's spirit ofaltruism has also spread
elsewhere in the Public Safety. Lieutenant
Brian Harris recently came up withideaof the
haunted house in Tarble, which raised over
$7OO for the AmericanCancerSociety. Harris
arranged the event with friends in the Parkside Fire Department in memory of a young
fireman who died of cancer. Plans for next
year are already being discussed.
The hauntedhouse drew a positive reaction from the college community. As Narkin
said, "It's nice to hear some praise. We often
hear negative remarks in this department. It's
like raising a child: to get a good result, you
have to hear the good with the bad."
Negative remarks Narkin has heard include complaints about parking tickets, and,
when people press theintercom button on the
gate behind Parrish and threaten, "I'm gonna
rip this &%#@! gate right off the hinges."
No two days are alike in the Public
Safety department, and Narkin knows about
everything that happens. So try to stay out of
trouble, park in the student lots, and hang on
to your ID...but don't be afraid to stop by for
directions or a little friendly advice.

Cultural Analysis:

Coke: is it the real thing?
By Ethan Borg
Coke is a surrogate to sex. It is refreshing, pleasurable, and satisfying when one
cannotbe satisfied any other way. Coke is the
mystery, the ejaculation, and the physical act
all in one—but it is pre-mature ejaculation,
and so can never fully satisfy. The explosion
begins the process, and when one has finished
the can, there is more of a sense of emptiness
than resurrection.
A can of Coke or Pepsi or Sprite, etc., is
a black box. We cannot know what is inside it
until we open it up and enter it. It standsthere
like a woman completely dressed—which
can only be imagined naked until it is possessed. It is feminine. It must be entered to
bring pleasure.
We watch it on the television in the same
close-up as we see female body parts, it is
intimate, it is exciting, it creates a sense of
ownership, and it is objectified (yet this is
really an object!). We lust for Coke...or at
least we are told we should. Coke is orgasm.
Watch those who drink it; their faces are so
bright when they pause for air. They are
exaltant. They have been satisfied in a visceral way. We too can be this way. We do not
have to struggle through gender "politics to get
there. No! We can have a Coke! We can have
itnow! We can even have more than a handful
a day—it is even better than sex. You want it.
You know you want it!
We return to the days of yore, when
women are to be bought with cows and donkeys. Our sexual satisfaction comes at a price:
not exactly a dowry, but then again this is a
slam-bam-thank-you-can one-time deal. Believe me, it's a cheap orgasm, say the
advertisers. And it is hermetically sealed.
You no longer have to fear falling in love with
an "impure" mate. You no longer have to fear
infidelities. You no longer have to fear about
protection —you will not get AIDS, herpes,
gonorrhea from this can.
Once a can is purchased it is property, to
be used at your simplest whim, with no respect to its feelings, desires, times of the
month. Again, we are told, the can is "the real
thing," it is "whatyou want," it is better than
the fake orgasm whenmale and female parts
collide. What a real man wants is immediate
satisfaction—and this is provided.
It is easy to enter the can. It is opened by
an interjection into theexpanse, a quick flick
of the wrist. And there you have it—the explosion! If shaken up a bit, the explosion is
even greater, more pleasureful to listen to,
unpredictable, wet, sticky, and slimy. Individual bubbles ofcarbon dioxide stream to the

top of the can like sperm in the hunt (but these
sperm are innocuous and will not create an
unplanned pregnancy—yes, the can is even
neutered!). When the can is open we have liftoff, we haveorgasm. Our rhythmic gulping of
the contents is like the rhythmic pulses of

ejaculation.
More poignant than a can (in the case of
the orgasm), we have the phallus-shaped
bottle. Yet in this case it is the reverse —we
are the feminineparts, and thebottle enters us.
Here, we have oral sex. It is for the company
that manufactures the product that we are
providing pleasure, that we are underneath in
a vulnerableposition. Thus, we have both the
feminine can and the masculine bottle. Both
explode. Both give us pleasure.
The drink itself is sweet—it embodies
pleasure, luxury, freedom from the social
restraints of our parents who denied us sugar,
who told us to keep our urges hidden. Now we
can drink Coke anywhere, at any time. We
drink the ambrosia. Again, Coke is the real
thing, for that other form of orgasm can't be
done freely, anywhere, or anytime.
But the company is wrong. Coke isn't
what we want. It isn't the real thing. It is a
projection of our sexual desires onto a more
acceptable form. In a society so overly sensitive of anything to do with sex, we are forced
to embody it in an aluminum can!—something cold, metallic, reproducible, and bad for
you (it rots your teethand it pumpsyour blood
with caffeine).
Furthermore, the company lies when it
tells us there is no reproduction, no growth of
new life-forms. In fact, it is the company
which reproduces and we are the vessels that
provide all the nutrients that are necessary.
Our lustand dowries pay for the expansion of
the company —and, ironically, it is the company which is fruitful and multiplies. Their
advertisers make us the objects—they seek to
possess our faithful devotion through images
and icons. We are pigeonsbeing made to push
those buttons, to have small orgasms that
fertilize the company. And it works.
It is our sexual repression which fuels
Coke and most otherAmerican industries. By
projecting our frustrations onto their merchandise, by creating associations that link
sexual pleasure to their products, we are unconsciously propelled to use their services.
Why? Because sex is so unacceptable in our
culture—sexual urges, sexual gratification,
even words that describe sex—that we must
find other ways that are acceptable to release
these unconscious desires, that are constant,
that are liberating, but which will never be
what you really want: the real thing.

WSRN reviews blues and jazz
Koko Taylor and John Lurie's new albums two excellent choices
by Guy Haskin & Alicia Wilson

Adam and Adam say:
go watch the movies!
Malcolm X and Die Hard get two thumbs
up from our split-personality reviewer
By Adam Blakeley
W: Hello. This is Will. I'm not
inright now, but ifyou'll leaveyour
name, number, and a short mes...
A: Shut up, Will. Yes, that's
right... Will's not around this week,
so I'm flying solo. For those interested, he popped off to Geneva to
visit a special someone, and I hate
him.
A: Me too.
A: Shut up, you. Right, so
anyway, the reviews. This week,
I'll be rambling on and on about two
movies, as usual, except this time,
Will won't be able to interrupt my
insightful commentary.
The movies for this week are,
on Friday night, Die Hard showing
only at 7:30 and 10 p.m. in DuPont,
and Malcolm X on Saturday, 7:30
p.m. only in the Eugene Lang Performing Arts Center, in the part
where they normally show movies.
(OK, I'm padding—l only have
myself here, you know?)
A: Tell them about me, Adam.
A: I told you to shut up! Onto
the first movie. If you were alive
sometime last year,you heard about
Malcolm X—the SpikeLee screenplay of The Autobiography of
Malcolm X (as Told to Alex Haley).
First, I must say that there are a
lot of insightful and controversial
critiques of this movie out there,
and if you're looking for one, this
ain't the place. Come on, this is The
Phoenix. I unfortunately do not
know my American history well
enough to speak with any authority
about the historical value ofthefilm.
What I can do is give my impressions.
All in all, I liked the film, and I
think it serves as a good introduction to Malcolm X. One of the
things that comes across quite well
is the fact that his doctrines were not
static. Through the course of his
preaching, and particularly after his
break with the Nation of Islam, he
molded his ideas about racial relations as he saw fit. The film also
does a good job portraying X as not
a violentcharacter himself. Rather,
he was a very devout man, disillusioned by the moral corruptness
which he observed around him.
Spike Lee is, in my opinion, a
very talented and innovative director. His chief photographer, Ernest
Dickerson, once again does an excellent job with the film. However,
Iknow thatsomepeoplefindSpike's
direction and cinematography grating. If you have seen any of Spike
Lee's other films (Do the Right
Thing, Jungle Fever, She's Gotta
Have It), let that serve as your guide.
Ifyou have not, I urge you to check
out Malcolm X.
The movie is admittedly long,
and while I can't argue that Spike
should have cut out any scenes, parts
ofit are a bit dry. On the other hand,
even if I had not liked the movie, I
would tell you to see it simply to

watchDenzel Washington. The taltherole goes
so far beyond his obvious physical
similarities to Malcolm X; it's unbelievable. I'veraved about several
acting performances this semester;
this ranks up there with the best of
them.
Todd Sasaki: Hey! I'm here,
just like you asked.
A: Thanks, T. OK, ladies and
gents, we're going to try something
a bit unusual for the Die Hard review, so please stand back. Todd
has volunteered help channelWill's
opinions all the way from Switzerland. Ready? Go ahead.
T:
A: Any time now.
T:
A: Whenever you're ready.
T:...Die Hard...
A: Yes?
T:... Genius.
A: What a surprise. Anything
else?
T: Nope. His mind's a blank
Wait.. .no, we can't print that.
A: OK, thanks T.
T: By the way, you forgot to
mention Terrence Blanchard's
soundtrack to Malcolm X. In the
words of Mr. Buttram,
A: I know, I know. Genius.
Agreed. Good-bye, Todd.
Door: SLAM.
A: So anyhow, Die Hard is a
Bruce Willis movie. And it's not
HudsonHawk. In fact, it's actually
quite good. I've only seen it about
fourteen and 1/2 times, so I haven't
quite worked out all the clever Machiavellian subtext and what-not,
and I certainly believe that Willis is
a Christ figure, and the guns are
obviously phallic symbols, and,
well, you get my point.
A: Aaaaddddddaaaammm
A: I'M NOT LISTENING!!!
Pardon me, folks. I get pretty lonely
without Will around.
A: Ohpuh-leeze.
A: All right, all right. Back to
the movie. This movie is a lot of
fun, even if you're not into movies
with a lot ofgunfire and explosions.
The movie, if you didn't know, is
about a terrorist kidnapping of a
very large building. Willis, ofcourse,
avoids being caught in the beginning 'cause he's in the 100,and from
therehe saves everyone's butt. Well,
most everyone's butt, anyway.
The movie is really the only
worthwhile thing Willis has done
since Moonlighting. It's quite funny,
and thevillain (played by AlanRickman—the Sheriff of Nottingham
who saved Costner's Robin Hood)
is hysterical. As you can probably
guess, the plot isn't quite what you'd
call absorbing, or for that matter
existent, but as I said, there are a lot
of explosions.

This week's WSRN record reviews come from Blues Director
AliciaWilson and JazzDirector Guy
Haskin. WSRN's jazz and blues
programming can be heard Monday
through Friday in the afternoon,
from noon until 6 p.m. Check it out
this week. It's great music to which
you can relax, study, or do just about
anything. WSRN has some talented
jazz and blues DJ's who are putting
on some great shows and providing
quality entertainment in the afternoon. Tune in—it's 91.5 FM on
your dial.
Koko Taylor and Her Blues
Machine: Live From Chicago..An
Audience With The Queen (Alligator Records)
"HEY, Everybody! Let's have
some fun! You only live once, and
when you're dead, your gone...Let
the Good Times Roll!" So begins
Koko Taylor's goose-bump inspiring live album, Live from
Chicago..An Audience With The
Queen. This album, off the Alligator record label, shows the best in
modem Chicago blues. It's no mistake thatKoko is called "The Queen
of theBlues"—as she rips into "I'm
a Woman" and wails to a screaming
crowd, it's obvious that no one else
could have bluer blood. Koko's
band, her Blues Machine, is better
than ever, withMichael "Mr. Dynamite" Robinson on a blazing guitar,
Eddie King also on guitar, Jerry
Murphy on bass, and Clyde
"Youngblood" Tyler, Jr. on drums.
The band jumpsthrough some
dance tunes in the concert, likeLouisiana-inspired "Going back to
Luka," and the huge crowd-pleaser
"Wang Dang Doodle." But Koko
can'thelp but grind themdown with
her famous "I'd Rather Go Blind,"
in which she wails out her sorrow
over seeing her man walk a wayfrom
her. Her voice, which usually shouts
out her proud womanhood, now conveys more sorrow thanit seems anyone could possibly have. In the, true
Chicago style, this album has a big
sound—much bigger than the actual band, but with a voice like
Koko's, every inch of therecording
is filled with her boisterous rollicking self.
If you are a blues novice, and
you're looking for a good start for a
blues collection, Koko Taylor is
the way to go—she epitomizes the
Chicago Style, and works the audience better than any performer ever
heard. If you're interested in finding out more about the blues, tune in
to WSRN (91.5 fm) on Thursdays
from 4-6 p.m., and Fridays from 24 p.m. for some great blues explorations and lots ofKoko Taylor.

John Lurie's National Orchestra: Men WithSticks (Made to Measure vol. 34)
Saxophonist John Lurie redefines the meaning of national orchestra in his 1993 CD release, Men
with Sticks. In this release, Lurie
forms a three-piece ensemble with
percussionists Billy Martin and
Calvin Weston. Although this trio
may not have the size of a national
orchestra, Martin and Weston produce an impressive variety of textures over which Lurie presents his
solos.
The music is largely free and
improvised, but don't let that scare
you off. Lurie manages to present
free improvised music in such a
way that it is accessible to listeners
from all backgrounds. The rhythmic textures provided by Martin
and Weston are open and provide
Lurie with ample space to present
his ideas. Moreover, the communi-

cation between the musicians is esown melodies before us.

Week Eleven NFL Predictions
You should bet with Rob. Last week: 11-1, Overall: 53-27 (.663).
By Rob Utley
WeekEleven marks a bye week
for the Lions and Patriots. As always, home teams are listed first.
Eagles vs. Dolphins: Hmmm,
the way that the Eagles are playing
now, they couldn't win a game of
Connect Four, much less a game of
football. I was wrong in last week's
article; the Eagles did not release
QB Ken O'Brien, ...but they should
have. In a note to Coach Kotite: sign
Bernie Kosar! But do it after you
face the Redskins. After losing last
week to the Jets, the Dolphins are in
strong need of a win. Who better
than Philadelphia to provide it?
Winner: DOLPHINS.
Giants vs. Redskins: Six weeks
ago at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., the Giants paid a visit to

the Joe Gibbs-less Redskins and

drubbed Washington to the tune of
41-7. The Redskins haven't forgotten, and they'll prove it this week in
the Meadowlands. The Giants have
lost their last two games and are still
withoutRB Rodney Hampton. New
York has scored a total of five field
goals in those two losses. Washington, behind QB Mark Rypien, must
win this game if they are to have any
chance ofmaking the playoffs. This
sense ofurgency gives the 'Skins an
advantage. Winner: REDSKINS.
Saints vs. Packers: This should
be a good game between two of the
NFL'smostunderrated teams. When
you think Green Bay, you think
Sterling Sharpe (as wellyou should).
But the Packers have a solid defense, a great TE in Jackie Harris,
and a strong-armed QB in Brett

team that could win the NFC West.
But can you even name five Saints
players? Saints fans and close football followers could, but to the rest
of the world, the Saints live in relative anonymity. Even so, the Saints
have a talented wideout in Eric Martin, a great defense anchored by
veteran LB Rickey Jackson, and a
kicker who's been known to kick a
55-yd field goal or two. In what

We put Swatties on Ice Soccer ends season, looks to future
Motherpuckers: both sport and social event
By Joe Leahy
At Swarthmore, ice hockey is a
dirty word—Motherpuckers. (Okay,
so it only sounds like a dirty word, but
if you say it fast enough nobody will
know thedifference.) But what exactly
does this word mean—what kind of
gross obscenity is this sport? Well, let
me tell you, it isn't pretty.
Ice hockey at Swarthmore isn't
pretty when or where or how it is
played, itisn't pretty in what it requires,
and itisn't pretty in theway that itlooks
(to either the hockey fan or the typical
Swattie). But it sure is a lot of fun.
For those of you who don'tknow
already (what with new pro hockey
teams sweeping the country, even Floridians and Califomians must know
about ice hockey by now, but with
Swatties you never know), ice hockey
is more closely akin to its sister sport,
floor hockey, than its distant cousin,
field hockey. (To thoseof us who hail
from ice hockey-playing areas where
there is no field hockey and who have
no clue whatishappening whenwe are
at a field hockey game, it sure seems
differentthanfieldhockey.) Ice hockey
is basically floor hockey on ice with
skates and wooden sticks.
Motherpuckersgoes a step further than
this, and requires all skaters to protect
their valuable craniums, with fullyapproved, 'puckers-provided hockey
helmets.
Of course, 'puckers' (the name
can refer to either the skaters or the
sportitself) wearing protective helmets
isn't thereason whythe sport itselfisn't
pretty (infact, thereis actually afull line
offashionheadwearwhichcan accommodate almost everyone). No, 'puckers' isn't pretty for otherreasons.
First is the van ride there. Every
Thursday night a crowded van leaves
the Rose Garden at 9:50 pmand again
at 10:05 pm to take Swatties to the
Springfield Ice Arena just a shortride
away, after 'puckers' midnight wrapup the van then takes these"Sweaties"
backintwoequally crowded tripswhich
last infinitely longer. As Charles
Danforth '95, currently the "head
honcho of 'puckerdom," said, "The
ride over is raucous and fun; people
sing and laugh and joke and squirm.
But we kind of sit around in our own
sweat on the ride home, and enjoy a
pleasant lethargy," said Danforth.
Second, there is the ice surface,
whichby mostaccounts is the smallest
rink in North America, justlarger than
a frozen-over bathtub. Third, there is
the ice time—ten-thirty to midnight,
when ice rental is cheap and many
Swatties can find free time, but alas, at
the same timethatThePhoenix is being
created upstairs in Parrish.
Fourth, is the length of time of
each 'puckers session. Those 'puckers
whoare on the iceahvays seem to leave
itgloomily after theirfive-minuteshifts
are up, whilethose watching (and waiting to go on the ice) tend to gleefully
count down the remaining seconds.
Obviously, one and a halfhours a week
is not nearly enough punishment for
thehardened 'pucker. Of course,"things
really mellow out a little bit after the
first three or four rotations—people
finally realize how exhausted they are
and how much fun they had at around
midnight," said Danforth.
This would seem paradoxical.
Isn't a little pain enough? It seems not
A closer look at the pucker experience
might shed some light on why thisis so.
At first glance, it would seem that
'puckers has something to offer everyone. There are "A,""B," "C," and
sometimes, "D" lines, so that anyone
fromthemost experienced hockeyplayers to thosewhohave never laideyeson
a sheet of ice should have their own
timeslot in which to dazzle the crowd.
But the divisions are less than
perfect and theresults are, again, less
thanpretty. Due to the smallsize ofthe
rink, the C and B lines are often overcrowded withflailingbodies and sticks,
so much so that meek first-timers are

oftenscared awaybefore they even get
their skates tied. (This is not to scare
folks off from trying puckers if they
havenot before; there are actually very
few injuries.) Moreover, even to those
hockey players that didn't make their
highschoolyMrtwrvarsity hockey team,
the A line is not much of a challenge.
Yet the 'puckers show up week after
week, and many show up year after
year. Why?
The reasons are simple enough.
Frrst, 'puckers does give some opportunity to everyone, although it might
not be exactly whatfirst-timers expect
For those ofus who have played a lotof
hockey in the past, 'puckers doesn't
offer a great chance to show off our
athletic ability, or to develop Gretzkylike passing and stick-handling abilities. But it does give a lot of semijocular Swatties a chance to feel good
about being able to run into theboards
at high speeds and remember what it
was like to crush other kids in to them
when we were in junior high. Moreover, it gives usa high thatmany of us
never got a chance to experience—our
day in the sun, on the ice. Though we
know that our skills are declining rapidly past thepoint ofno return, we still
get cheered on wildly by those who
can't skate a lick. What B and C line
don'tknow can't hurt them
For thoseSwattiesthathavenever
played hockey before, 'puckers is also
a great experience. It is a chance to try
somethingnew—in anon-competitive
atmosphere and a (relatively) safe setting. Though some may be serious
about improving their fitness or their
slapshot, puckers really offers neither
the time nor the place for that
The skates, sticks and helmets
that are provided aren't incredibly conducivetomaking abetter hockeyplayer,
but there is enough to go around so that
everybody hasachance tobe a zamboni
or a tripod (that is, to prop themselves
up with their stick as their third leg, or
fall down and mopup the ice like that
famous machine). And nobody is going to laugh at those who can't skate,
because nobody can skate.
Said CanadianDave McKechnie
'97, an A-liner himself, "It's not like
you have to be good to play because
there are alot ofpeople whohave never
skated before."
Most importantly,Motherpuckers
is a social activity. Some students
come andsiton thesidelines justtochat
withfriends who are skating that night,
perhaps hoping to get up enough courage to go out and skate. Others go
because their hall or their friends cajoled them intoit—and they generally
endup loving it, no matter how many
times they fall. To many Swatties,
Motherpuckers it a fun way to start off
theirweekendandblowoffsomesteam
after theseriousness of the work week.
Said McKechnie," 'puckers is a great
study break ifyou're busy studying on
a Thursday night and you want to get
out and do some exercise."
Puckers is also an inexpensive
form of entertainment—huddling together tokeep warm on the bench is as
interesting a wayof creating body heat
as most that can be found on campus.
Said Danforth, "I first became
involved as a pucker as a freshman. It
was a dorm bonding event I think it's
great that people from so many social
circles are into skating and having fun."
So, 'puckers might not be pretty,
and it might onlybarely behockey, but
that isn't really what it is supposed to
be, anyway. It is a club that all can
belong to, and a sport that we don't
keep score in—not seriously, at least
At a school thatmakes a big deal about
eschewing competition and allowing
students to explore new identities,
'puckers is the quintessential

that we are supposed to value here.

Women's Rugby Wins
Team beats Bucknell for 3rd place in EPRU
By Delta Ruscheinsky
The Swarthmore women's
rugby team finished the season by
capturing 3rd place in the Eastern
Pennsylvania Rugby Union
Women's Collegiate Tournament
with a 20-0 win over Bucknell on
Saturday.
In the first game of the day,
ShippensburgdefeatedScranton 100 for sth place. And in the championship game Princeton crushed
UPenn 36-6. Both teams will be
advancing to the USA Rugby East
Tournament to be held later in the
year.
Swarthmore's 3rd place finish
and 6-1 record are marked improvements for the Swat team after a sth
place finish last year. The team was
also the only unit to finish in the top
six in the EPRU without a coach.
The practices, training drills, and
game line-ups are determined by
theplayers. "A great amount of our
success was due to the organization
and efforts put forth by captains and
veteran membersof theteam," said
Margaret Patterson '95.
Swarthmore controlled the
tempo for most of the game and
maintained position within
Bucknell's 22 for most of the game.
While Swat had little trouble keeping theball in Bucknell's halfof the

field, they came up scoreless on
many occasions due to the superb
Bucknell defense led by their allstar, Renata Razza.
The first score of the game was
a 5-m run by EPRU stand-out Deb
Cunningham '94, followed by a
missed conversion by Rebecca Cole
'96. Cunningham went on to score
two additional tries and assisted
Wendy Weiner '94 in carrying in
another.
Forward Captain Jen Romich
'94 said, "We played an ideal
game.The forwards ran in support
of thebacks and were there to rip the
ball when the backs became tied

up."
While the forward pack controlled the scoring, the back line
crashed and posted the ball amazingly to gain yardage. The game's
highlight occurred late in the second half when Cole sprinted 50
meters through the Bucknell line
offa 1-4scissors from Ruscheinsky.
The season was a great way to
end the careers of eight seniors.
"Ever since freshman year, I've
dreamed of a season like this," said
Kim Lundgren '94.
Eight members of the team will
be participating in post-season play
as they travel to New York over
Thanksgiving to take part in the
Central Park Seven's Tournament.

Swarthmore swimmers race across the pool in their November 9 victory over a small Rutgers

Men's basketball looks to new season
Hopes to use depth and exciting run'n'gun approach to improve
By David Lischer

Emily Mindel

The women's basketball team practices in preparation for
their November 16 scrimmage against Penn State Delco.

With eight freshman faces on
the roster and a new offensive strategy, Swat's men's basketball team
has the necessary foundation to reverse last year's 7-17 record. In
addition, Swat will now compete in
the East Division of the newly chartered Centennial League against
rivals Muhlenberg, Washington,
Ursinus and Haverford.
With games against a highlytoutedJohns Hopkins, Franklin and
Marshall, as well as two Division I
opponents, Yale and Lafayette, Swat
faces one of the toughest schedules
of any Division HJ team. Hopkins
and F & M are members of the
Centennial Conference Western Division which also includes
Dickinson, Gettysburg, and Western Maryland. Despite thefact that
Swat boasts only one returning senior, co-captain Brett Fenster '94
feels that experience will not be a
problem even in the face of such a
tough schedule, "at one point I've
started, so have Corey Mulloy [cocaptain, '94], Kirk Daulerio ['9s],
Chad Tarr ['9s], and JayRose ['9s].
It's just that on paper, Jim Foley
['9s] is our only returning starter."

The Garnet drove right back
and scored again with another
Milligan touchdown run, this one a

However, the Garnet offense,
which had been potent most of the
day, was unable to get going during
the 4th quarter. "We stopped them
defensively and the defensestiffened
up for the first time," said Tindall.
This game marked the end of
the Swarthmore careers of seniorcocaptains Tindall, Josh Drake, Mike
Vagner, and Erik Shold.
"The future's bright. They have
everyone back except forfour guys,"
said Tindall.

Team depth is Swat's strongest
point and 10 to 11 players are expected to be in the regular rotation.
This will be critical to the success of
Swat's new transition offense, described as a "Division 111 version of
Loyola Marymount." Emphasizing
running and passing, this depth will
allow Coach Lee Wimberly to keep
fresh players onthe courtat all times.
"Unlike recent years, we are a
team which has no stars. In order to
be successful we must have fundamentally sound and intense play at
both ends of the court and the willingness of all players to be totally
unselfishand to do whatever it takes
to help us win games," said Coach
Wimberly. "It will be a big challenge for our players and coaching
staff to find the ingredients for success, but it is a challenge which can
be met withdedicationand positive
team chemistry."
That there are "no stars" on this
year's team has helped form the
vital team chemistry Coach
Wimberly described. "When you
have threemoney people[very good
players], you develop a dependence
onthoseplayers... and theothers are
left to fit around them. Last year it
didn't work so well," explained
Andy Danilchick '95. "Where you
can see it [team chemistry] the most
is in team dynamics... we really
encourage each other, there is a lot
of enthusiasm and commitment."
One of the biggest problems
last year's team faced was turnovers. In 24 games Swat committed
428 turnovers compared to 321 for
its opponents. Much of this can be
attributed to thefact that the offense
revolved around three or four players whohad to shoulder much of the
scoring load. With this year's deep
rotation, no one will be forced to
carry the load.
Since Swat has a shortage of
inside height, it will have torely on
its quickness to score and control
thepace of the game.The backcourt
is the deepest area, as Fenster described, "We can go three deep at
either the point or shooting guard
without giving up too much." He
added that regardless of how much
speed a team has, however, it must
have some kind ofan inside game or

the opponent can counter the outside game.
The new offense is ",much
more creative and freelance" according to Danilchick, and allows
the team to take advantage of its
speed but will require them to be
better athletes and play better defense.
Jeff Greeson, one of six recruited freshmen, already has experience with a high-tempo game and
intense defense from high school.
These frosh, one ofthe better classes
of recruits in recent years, will be
expected to contributefrom the start.
"A lot of them can get quality minutes," said Kirk Daulerio '95.
"I came [to Swat] for the academics but I was also impressed
with Coach Wimberly and the apparent presence of team unity and a
desire to do well despite a lack of
apparent stars," said Greeson. Other
promising freshman include Aaron
Bond, Colin Convey, Ben Schall,
and A.J. Shanley. Jacob Latham
will likely miss the season with
shoulder surgery.
Two returning players are currently suffering from nagging injuries. Daulerio is out with a pulled
groin and tendinitis in his knees, but
is not expected to miss any time.
Sam Voolich '96 has what Fenster
