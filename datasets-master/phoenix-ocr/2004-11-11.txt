BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR

...

-Three men entered Worth dormitory at 12:30 a.m. on
Nov. 3 and accosted a student with a handgun, according to
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave. The three
assailants entered the student's room in search of drugs
but left without discovering any. Before leaving, the men
told the victim not to call the police.
The victim was apparently not the student the men had
been trying to find. The student "answered the door and
didn't recognize the individuals," Redgrave said. "From
the name they asked it seemed clear that he wasn't the person they were looking for."
"They also mentioned 'Where's the weed?' to which he
responded that he didn't know what they're talking about.
They made a quick search of his room and left. They told
him not to call the police, although it wasn't clear for what
period of time," Redgrave said.
Shortly after 2 a.m., the student spoke with Public
Safety who then relayed the report to Swarthmore police.
"Any criminal incident that we're aware of, we get
involved in," Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig said.
Police cars patrol the campus' perimeter, but generally do
not come onto campus unless a complaint is filed, according to Craig.

"Swatties always think they live in a
bubble
and every so often they
get reminded that they live in the
real world."

dean of the college
...

The assault was the first armed incident to occur near
the campus since 2001, when two students were robbed at
gunpoint walking through the SEPTA tunnel from the
Swarthmore borough to campus, The Phoenix reported.
Since he began working for Public Safety 20 years ago,
Redgrave could not recall a crime involving armed individuals entering a residence hall. In 2001, three unarmed

males entered a student's dorm room in Mertz and assaulted him, The Phoenix reported.
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 said that the college
does not plan to pursue any new security measures. "We
don't see that we need to change [security]," he said.
He pointed to the common practice of propping open
dorm doors as being the main weakness in protecting
against intruders. "We can't shut the campus down, but I
think it's important that individual students take respon-

reminded that they live in the real world," he said.
The three assailants were described as 5-foot-10-inch
men with "stocky builds" in a reserved-students e-mail
sent by Public Safety on Nov. 4. One, a black man, had a
mustache and goatee; a second, a Latino man, had short
black hair and a thin mustache.
It is unlikely that the suspects are students at the college. According to Craig, the victim described them as
being in their late 20s to early 30s.

"I don't know every student on the Swarthmore College
campus, but generally they're [all] late teens to early 205,"
Craig

said.

The three assailants apparently entered Worth without
difficulty, giving rise to concerns about the security of dormitories around campus.
"I think [a crime like this] always heightens the awareness that dorms appear to be relatively vulnerable because
of door-propping," Redgrave said. "The locking mechanisms are set to be locked all the time. I don't know, unfortunately, of any college that deals well with this issue,
whether you have electronic access or mechanical or
whatever," he said.
Some students living in Worth were shaken by the incident.
"I was surprised and scared about the whole thing. It's
easy to think when you're in the Swarthmore bubble that
that sort of thing can't happen to you," Alan Smith 'OS said.
But "[the incident] hasn't reaUy affected my day-to-day
life," Smith added.
"I'm certainly concerned that there was a guy coming
around Worth with a gun. I made sure to lock my door
after that. I'm pretty surprised that something could happen like that around here," Andrew Skemer 'O6, another
Worth resident, said.
The fact that the assault appears to be drug-related is
particularly troubling to college officials and the police. "I
think common sense would dictate that when one deals
with drugs, you're dealing with an element with a higher
propensity for violence than many of the other crimes we

see on campus," Redgrave said.
"The case is actively under investigation," Craig said.
"We've been in contact with the victim. We've asked him
to prepare a statement as to what's happened. We've also
talked to two people who saw people leaving the building
about that time who gave a similar description as to what
the victim reported. We've also talked to the person whose
name these people gave when they assaulted the victim,"
he said.
The Swarthmore Police Department is small, consisting
of a chief, a sergeant and six police officers. If necessary,
the department can request help from the District
Attorney's Office, Pennsylvania State Police or other
police departments in Delaware County. The case has not

yet reached that magnitude, Craig said.
"We have to see after we get the information from the
victim what develops. Right now we have a description of
the three males. What we would like to do is possibly get
the victim in touch with one of the detectives at the criminal investigation division to do a composite drawing. If he
can do that, that right now would be our strongest lead,"
Craig said.
Craig asked that anyone with more information about
the crime call the police department.
"This is a very serious incident, and we're very concerned about it," Craig said.

College plans new design, features for Web site
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu
A committee comprised of faculty and

administrators is consulting with
Pentagram, a design and publishing firm,
to revamp the college's Web site to make it
more attractive and user-friendly.
While the Web site is an important tool
for admissions, it serves a more general
purpose than other admissions tools like
the viewbook and newly-released DVD, as
it also reaches alumni, parents and others
interested in Swarthmore, according to
Vice President Larry Schall '75. "It's for a
broader audience," he said.
"Alumni look to it as a source of information about the college so we don't want
to give it over totally to marketing,"
Director of News and Information Tom
Krattenmaker said.
Krattenmaker described the intent of
the anticipated changes, most of which are

THE PHOENIX

should be done by the end of this school
year, as being to give a more unfiltered
view of the college. "It's going to be pretty
unmediated and organic," he said.
Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O said
many prospective students look to a
school's Web site as a way to get less
processed information about a given
school. "People believe that they're going
to have access to information that they
wouldn't get from other places," he said.
Krattenmaker said that Pentagram,
which helped design the new viewbook and
DVD packaging, as well as the new Jon
Stewart book, "America, (The Book)," felt
the general focus the Web site has on providing news on major conferences and
speakers on-campus is effective. "We and
the consultants think that the approach we
take is good," he said.
To improve on this approach, Schall
said that the Web site would feature more
information about day-to-day life on cam-

pus. "We want more stories than just news
releases," he said.

"I don't know if I can

overstate [the importance
of the Web site] ...We're
seeing far more students
find us through the Web."
Jim Bock '9O
dean of admissions
Both Schall and Bock noted the centrality of schools' Web sites to the college admissions process. "Prospective students are on
the Web maybe eight to 12 times before they
apply [to a specific school]," Schall said.
"I don't know if I can overstate [the

November IX 2004

importance of the Web site]," Bock said.

"We're seeing far more students find us
through the web."
Schall said that the new Web site will feature more consistent information across the
departments about professors and the classes they teach. "We want to try to get some
uniformity," he said.
"We want to give [professors] a methodology to continue updating the sites into the
future," Krattenmaker said. He hopes to
institute some type of content management
system, like Blackboard, to make it easier
for professors to do so. "Right now you need
at least some low-level HTML or
Dreamweaver skills," he said.
The college plans to test the Web site,
along with the new viewbook and DVD, on
focus groups of prospective students at high
schools on the East Coast, West Coast and in
the Midwest, Schall said.
The Web site was last revamped about
five years ago, according to Krattenmaker.

Quakerism, past and present
A

look into Swarthmore's Quaker heritage, and how it affects the college, today

BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

Imagine this: All it took to be admitted
to Swarthmore College in the 1870s was a
membership in the Religious Society of
Friends or the son or daughter of a shareholder of the college's land, according to
Richard Walton's "Swarthmore College:
An Informal History."

"Our youth should be
enabled to obtain an
education according to the
demands of the advanced
civilization of the age."
William Dorsey
member of first
board of managers

Back then, the mission of the college
was to provide a protected place for edu-

cation of Friends, where Quakers would

be trained academically, morally and spiritually, sheltered from the influences of
the outside world.
As William Dorsey, a member of the
first Board of Managers, said at the college's opening ceremonies on Nov. 10,1869,
"Our youth should be enabled to obtain an
education according to the demands of the
advanced civilization of the age
under
the guarded religious care of Friends."
Since that time, Swarthmore's mission
has changed. Although Board members
and a large population of the student body

continued to be Quakers, the college

moved to nonsectarian control in 1908.
These days, an average of only

Quakers

have

11
at

matriculated
Swarthmore per year in the past 11 years,
amounting to a student body that is roughly 3 percent Quaker at any given time,
Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O said.

The Friends Meeting House, to which students once flocked every Sunday morning,
is now filled mostly by area residents,
accompanied by only a handful of students.
For many students, the influence of the
Religious Society of Friends is no more
than the cordoned-off Friends Historical
Library in McCabe or a tradition like
First Collection here and there.
Even when compared to Haverford and
Bryn Mawr, which are similarly no longer
sectarian, Swarthmore seems low on the
Quakerism scale. "Haverford, especially,
is more righteously Quaker," said Dean of
the College Bob Gross, referencing
Haverford's honor code.
However, Swarthmore "still values
highly many of the principles of that society" such as hard work, simple living and
service, according to the College Bulletin.
Now, over 100 years later, where are
Swarthmore's Quaker roots most evident,
and what is the college's investment in

honoring them?

Simple beginnings

Swarthmore was incorporated in 1864
by the Hicksite division of the Religious
Society of Friends, according to the dissertation, "Swarthmore College: The
Evolution of an Institutional Mission," by
Vice President Larry Schall '75. In contrast to schools like Haverford and Bryn
Mawr, which had been founded by wealthier, more urban Orthodox Quakers,

Swarthmore's founders were a younger,
more anti-authoritative group.
The college was to be primarily for
Friends, and was unusual in that it was
open to both women and men. It was
astonishing, however, in its employment
of women teachers who were paid as much
as men, and its requirement that the
Board of Managers be exactly half women
and half men. In fact, because women
were equally represented on the board,
Swarthmore required special legislation
by the Pennsylvania state government to
assure its recognition as a place of higher
learning, according to Gross.

Swarthmore
The mission of Swarthmore, however,
changed early and significantly. When the
first president Edward Parrish resigned in
1870 after a dispute with the Board, which
envisioned a more academic, less spiritual
Swarthmore, Edward Hicks Magill was
appointed by the board as his successor.
Under Magill, the traditional curriculum
was transformed to a more European one
with course electives in the hope that
Swarthmore students would adopt a
broader view of the world, Gross said.
More drastic changes came in 1921 with
the presidency of Frank Aydelotte, who
instituted the Honors Program and significantly enhanced Swarthmore's athletic
program, Schall wrote.
The first president not of Quaker background, Aydelotte took Swarthmore from
its original Quaker mission to one of peerless academic excellence. In his 1923 commencement address, he described the

Jan Grauman Neander 'OB
As for athletics, the former star
Indiana football player gave college coaches faculty standing and banned subsidies
for football players.
This marked a move for Swarthmore
"to an academic college from a social
club," Schall wrote.

'Friends, sleep, academics (pick two)'
Today, "the formal and spiritual part of
our Quaker legacy is gone," Gross said.
For many, in fact, there are features of the
school that are completely antithetical to
the mission of Swarthmore's founders.

Groups make post-election plans

Groups plan collaboration to facilitate political dialogue, combine etlorts on
BY BEN OLDFIELD

boldfiel@swarthmore.edu
Despite the culmination of their Get-Outthe-Vote efforts in the Nov. 2 presidential
election, on-campus political groups are
looking ahead to future activity.
Both the College Democrats and the
Swarthmore Voter Registration Coalition
hope the spirit of activism roused by the
election will continue.
"I still flinch when I see George Bush's
face on that Phoenix cover," College
Democrats treasurer Patrick Hart 'O6 said.
"But I think seeing Pennsylvania go blue
really vindicated a lot of the hard work volunteers did, and I'm looking forward to the
Dems continuing to be a presence on campus," he added.

"So many students
volunteered it's exciting
that there are people who
are still interested
in being involved."

...

SVRC co-founder and co-chair Ethan
Ucker 'O7 was also pleased with voter
turnout on election day. Political interest on
campus, he said, is still alive.
"So many students volunteered," he said,
"and it's exciting that there are people who
are still interested in being involved."
According to Ucker, over 90 percent of
Swarthmore students registered to vote in
Pennsylvania did so successfully. In addition, hundreds of students volunteered for

poll-watchers in Swarthmore, Chester and

Although Ucker is positive that the
SVRC will continue to promote civic

engagement on campus, he is unsure about
the coalition's new form and the possibility
of a new name. He hopes to increase contact
between other political groups on campus,
including the Swarthmore Progressive
Action Committee, College Democrats and
College Republicans.
whose
"We want to form a think tank
meetings wouldbe open to students to figure out how to proceed," Ucker said.

College Republicans President Maria
Macia also expressed interest in her group
delving into bipartisan ventures.
"We
look forward to working with the
College Democrats on hosting joint events
where there can be a productive and constructive dialogue on political issues," she
said in an e-mail.
SPAC co-coordinator Rachel Ackoff 'O7
said her organization will keep up its
...

momentum while moving away

from direct-

ly political endeavors.
For instance, SPAC is currently trying to
increase the amount of free trade products

on campus. "We've succeeded this fall in

having Essie Mae's serve exclusively fairtrade coffee, and we're hoping for the same
to happen at Kohlberg and the Science

Center," she said.
In conjunction with Ucker's proposal,
Ackoff would like to see the establishment
of a coalition for all the progressive groups
on campus, including the College
Democrats and SVRC. This way, groups
with similar goals will be able to pinpoint
where their missions overlap and eventually

collaborate.

"For example, I would expect that Enlace
and Earthlust might have special investments in promoting fair trade, which we've
taken on as a major issue," she said.
Ackoff also said it is necessary for SPAC
and other progressive groups to organize
better now than in the past, now that campus political interest has increased. "We're

group space so we can use it as storage and
maybe even for meetings," she said.
While still honing their definite postelection goals, the College Republicans
plan to continue their mission to "ensure
that the conservative view is represented
and presented in the first place on campus," Macia said. To this end, the group is
planning lectures to discuss conservative
thought and monthly political movie
screenings which will be followed by disdiscussing

cussion, according to Macia.
As for the College Democrats, elections
will be held in December and future leadership will be in the hands of underclassmen,
according to President Eva Barboni 'O6.
Neither she nor Hart is planning to run for
office again since they will not have as
much time to dedicate to the organization,

though both will stay active.
Regardless of who will be in charge, the
College Democrats are looking ahead to the
2006 elections. "Paul Scoles will be a strpng
challenger for the Pennsylvania Senate seat
in 2006," Hart said. Until then, "We'll need to

make sure [Sen. Arlen] Specter doesn't get
too conservative. We'll try to keep him honest," Barboni said.
Even though the immediate electionrelated goals are over, the political groups
plan to use the momentum from their recent
activities to pursue future objectives.
"I'm really moved by the post-election
energy, which I didn't expect," Ackoff said.
"One of the most exciting aspects is the
amount of collaboration groups are talking

about."

Quaker influence at Swarthmore still present today
From QUAKERS, pg.

Jan Grauman Neander 'OB, a member of
the Society of Friends, said the Quaker
testimonial of simplicity is greatly underexpressed and, in some ways, violated by

Swarthmore's current culture.
"This is a fantastically rich college,
and the expenses it puts forth to its students is antithetical to Quaker simplicity," he said.
But Grauman Neander recognized
Swarthmore's focus on being a premier
college and the expense that requires.
"The administration wants this to be an
outstanding academic place," he said. "It's

the college's choice, and I understand it."
Gross was wary of a Swarthmore too
busy for personal reflection. "I often
regretfully find students in a state of 'existential crisis,'" he joked. "I continually
talk to them about being centered."
Gross said he sees the silence of a
Quaker Meeting as a tool for individual

contemplation.

Hard work and rigorous education are
central values for any Quaker, but if that

means having to choose between "friends,
sleep, and academics," as the T-shirt proclaims, students are obviously denying

themselves time for the self-directed education that Quakers cherish, Gross said.

The paradox of Quaker education
Despite Swarthmore's drive to be a top
college and the busy lives most Swatties
live, the influence of Quakerism is not
entirely absent from the college. The
administration continues to honor the
presence of the college's Quaker roots in
its mission statement. Admissions still
considers membership of a Meeting a
"small plus factor" on a potential student's

application, Bock said.
Why does Swarthmore continue to
respect its Quaker tradition when it has
developed a culture that some claim is
antithetical to that tradition?
Many of Swarthmore's defining aspects
are results of the Quaker tradition. "The
governance structure and the way we
make our decisions is a legacy of our
Quaker roots," according to Schall. When
significant choices need to be made, committees are always formed and consensus
is aimed for, if not always reached because

of time constraints.
Gross also credits Swarthmore's past
for the Student Activities Fee, a small
piece of tuition that grants all students
access to activities on campus.
"Because activities on campus are free,

class differences are leveled out. Relative
to other schools, it's hard to tell who has
money and who doesn't," Gross said.
Quakerism is alive in classrooms, as
well. Swarthmore Meeting member and

education professor Ann Renninger said
she appreciated the college's lack of hierarchy in the classroom, citing the fact that
many Swarthmore professors choose to be
called by their first names.
Grauman Neander agreed. "There's an

emphasis on small classes and seminars

here that promotes a kind of equality in
the classroom where everyone can contribute. That's very Quakerly," he said.
The college also retains its past in a
more literal sense in its Friends Historical
Library, located in McCabe.
This library spans three floors of
McCabe and, according to curator
Christopher Densmore, it contains origi-

nal Quaker documents that are sought by
Friends
and
others
nationwide.
Established in 1871, the Friends Historical
Library has always been an important
asset to the college, according to
Densmore.
"Many of these documents were among
the only things to survive the great
Parrish fire in 1881, since this library was
then a fireproof vault," Densmore said.
The tension between keeping with
Quaker testimonials of equality and consensus and becoming a top college is alive
today. Gross said the tension this paradox
creates
between a Quaker simplicity
and a fast-paced academic rigor
inspires a certain unique creativity in students.
Academics come first here, but there is
also a strong urge to continually reflect on
our places in a larger society, according to
Gross.

'Let your life speak'
Most Quakerly of Swarthmore's mission today, however, is its vow to instill in
its students a deep mindfulness of the
value of our education and the responsibility with which it leaves them.
According to Renninger, the activism
of students and faculty in the recent presidential election and the presence of the
Lang Center for Civic and Social

Responsibility are both testaments to this
notion. "It shows that this is a place ofprogressive practices," she said.
"Our students must be more than

well-

trained, analytically astute, creative in
their disciplines and broadly educated.
They must also possess what I would like
to call ethical intelligence, an ethical intel-

ligence responsive to our times,"
President Al Bloom said in his inaugural
address on May 2, 1992.
The students Bloom then envisioned
were very unlike those of 1870, who came
to Swarthmore to isolate themselves from
the outside world to gain a purely Quaker
education.
But at the same time, Bloom's dream of
Swarthmore is in concert with what a
Quaker might consider an ideal college.
Here, students strive for academic excel-

lence, but they recognize that their knowledge comes with responsibility. An important Quaker testimonial is stewardship,
which calls for Friends to be stewards of
their environment and their resources.
For Bloom, then, Swarthmore is exemplary as a Quaker institution as it asks
Swarthmoreans to be stewards of their
education: Like the call to action of
George Fox, the founder of the Society of
Friends, it trains its students to let their

lives speak.

High stress levels stifle creativity, study shows
BY STEVE BROWN
THE LANTERN (OHIO STATE U.)

(U-WIRE) COLUMBUS, Ohio
Try not to get stressed
out before an exam
at least an exam that requires creative thinking.
A recent study by David Beversdorf, an assistant professor in Ohio State University's department of neurology,
and Jessa Alexander, a research assistant, revealed a correlation between medical students' stress levels and their
performance on various types of tests.
Beversdorf and Alexander gave 19 medical students
three tests, one or two days before a midterm, a time when
the students attested to being under large amounts of stress.
In a memory test, students were asked to repeat strings
of numbers up to nine in length. In the first creative problem-solving test, the same students were given three words
and then asked to think of one word that could be combined
with all three to form a compound word or short phrase.
In the last test Beversdorf and Alexander had the stu-

dents fill in the only blank spot on a grid that had a series
of shapes and symbols. The medical students were given a
list of possible solutions and asked to choose the shape or
symbol that best fit with the other shapes in the grid.
Students did considerably better on the memorization
test, indicating that they were not able to think as flexibly
during times of stress.

"We were curious in a real-world setting whether
stressers may be reacting to [norepinephrine], causing
changes in cognitive performance," Beversdorf said.
Norepinephrine is a chemical compound found in the
brain that has long been identified with subconscious
response to threatening situations.
The researchers administered similar tests to the same

students one week after their midterms, a period of time
when they were less likely to be stressed. The students performed slightly worse on the memory test, yet did better
on the word and grid test.
"We have done studies with artificial stressers in the
lab," Alexander said.
November H 2004

"I wanted to look at a more natural stresser in a setting
that occurs normally to see how identical we could get to
[the lab results]."
Other experts at OSU were not surprised by the results
of the study.
"When individuals are faced with a challenging task,
they are less likely to perform well in complex situations,"
Jennifer Graham, a postdoctoral fellow at OSU's Institute
of Behavioral Medicine Research, said. "The nature of the
two situations here is relevant only in that it indicates
recalling a list of numbers is a simpler- task than complex
problem solving."

In order to add more validity to their results,
Beversdorf and Alexander are currently in the process of
gathering a larger field of participants for similar research
to be conducted this winter.
Beversdorf is also conducting research involving functional MRI scanning to measure the effects of norepinephrine, as well as studying the effects of cocaine on cognitive

processes.

The Style Issue
From duct-tape purses to fuzzy slippers, mitten-gloves, and flip-flops
paired with parkas, the average Swattie's style is nothing if not unique.

This week, the Living & Arts section explores Swat style: what it is,
how it defines us, and how to add more of it to our everyday looks. So
don that trucker hat, belt that prairie skirt, or twirl that mustache

there's something here for everyone. Happy dressing!

Two-minute tips to hide the fact that you haven't showered in six days
We were asked

for the style issue. A
series of hilarious

mishaps, however,
left Lilli with flippers

to keep it short.
Having flippers
for hands is a good
excuse for not look-

ing one's best (opposable thumbs are apparently crucial for
the application ofpants and the shampoo lather cycle). But
even though few can cite a freak encounter with mutagenetic gel in their waffle batter, the time of the semester has
arrived in which the most that can be expected of us is that
we roll out of bed, across the field, into Sharpies, and back
into bed again. If this sounds familiar, you may need a style
defibrillation before you step out the door. CLEAR!
Perhaps we would be more likely to gain consciousness
in the morning, and walk into the dining hall in a more
sprightly fashion, if we put a paltry two more minutes into
our morning routine. We have prepared some convenient
generalizations about typical Swatwear. You've probably
read this article before, but there's nothing more fun than

The Kitao art gallery "ohlpened" its doors on Nov. 4
with an exhibit featuring outrageous and untraditional
art. The Ohlpening Exhibit, organized by Kitao Gallery
Board (KGB) members, aims to "demonstrate a vibrant
presence and bring in art from a variety of media and skill
levels," co-coordinator Stella Kyriakopoulos 'O5 said- The
artwork displayed varies considerably, from high-quality
photographed cityscapes to a found piece of wood to colored pencil on paper.
In light of the gallery's out-of-the-ordinary history, this
was a most appropriate event. Five years ago, in a campuswide vote, students decided to transform the space into an
art gallery rather than a media lounge. They named it
after one of the first art history professors at Swarthmore,
Kaori Kitao. Professor Kitao was a nontraditional professor who taught that art is a force in all things, however
mundane, Kyriakopoulos said.
Originally, the gallery was run by the Student Art
Association with just one gallery coordinator. The task
proved to be far too much for a single Swattie to manage,
so KGB was created last year to run the gallery more efficiently.

The strategy seems to have worked, as the exhibition
was well-received by the public. Board members were
quite pleased with the show.
"I was surprised over the amount of participation and
the high quality [of the submissions]. Sometimes getting
pieces is like pulling teeth," co-coordinator Tara Miller 'O7
said. "And there were no slabs of meat, so I was happy."
The exhibit features a total of 23 pieces, with a little

something for everyone. Ben Ewen-Campen 'O6, whose

two-inch cyanotype pictures of "old English guys" are also
on display, said, "My favorite thing at the show was by far
the hand-bound book of 'Harry Potter' that had certain
words highlighted or blocked out to make it dirty. That
was right up my alley."
For those who walk the same alley as Ewen-Campen,
and even for those who.don't, there are several items on
the art gallery's agenda to be featured after the close of its
current exhibit this coming Sunday, including a multimedia poetry reading. Next year, KGB plans to bring in the
Guerilla Girls, a feminist art group that promotes women
and minorities in the art world, and to hold fundraisers

like craft sales to support such endeavors.
More immediate in the gallery's future is the art of
Justin Belmont 'O5, who applies digital photographs to canvas and hosts a web-based art gallery. The objective is to
raise the question of the reproducibility of art.
KGB members also hope that in the future, more people
will become involved with the gallery and the shows.
Miller's advice is to not be afraid and to submit work,
"even if one isn't an art major or doesn't consider oneself
an artist."
New ideas and suggestions are welcome, particularly at
KGB meetings held on Mondays in Sharpies at 5 p.m. (open
meetings are the first and third Mondays of each month).
The Ohlpening Exhibit is available for viewing from
1-3 p.m. on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays and from
2-5 p.m. on Friday. It will run until Nov. 14.

The Style Issue

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

So what is Swarthmore style, anyway?
We asked: How would you describe your style of dress, and what do you think it says about you?

Nick Forrest '08: "My style says that I
appreciate a good ruffled shirt on occasion
and scarves with upset clouds on them."

Cristina Thompson '08: "I wear what fits
If it looks nice and it fits, I wear it. I think
that just means I'm low maintenance."

Christian DeSimone 'O6: "Alex's collared
shirt lends a collegiate sophistication to a
well-tempered urbanism. His love for soccer
comes out in his shoes."
Alex Wheeler 'O7: 'Christian likes to wear
sweaters and corduroy pants
today his
jacket is made out of tarp. This says he's a
warm guy, very welcoming."

Lauren Fenton 'O6: "I try to make my style
interesting. I wish I could dress like an
Indian woman with saris and all that. People
could probably make a judgment about
what I'm wearing but you can't really tell."

...

12

'O7: "How I dress says nothing
about me I don't want people to think
I'm normal just because I dress normal."

Susan Zell

...

Laura Mecklenburger 'O7: "My style
today is kind of late 1980s, early 1990s
grunge/metal. I like to mix styles, and I
think that says I don't see distinctions
where other people do."

November H 2004

Diana Kinker 'O6: "I would say my style is
very inconsistent. One day it's pajamas
and the next day it's heels."

Elsa Trimble 'O6: "I would call my personal style of dressing an attempt at a
stylish European look for the first two
weeks of class, then sweatpants. I
guess that says I sort of gave up."

Beauty in the breakdown
Even when you're down, you can ditch those fashion blues
such fun?
If MTV is any indication, barmyness
and bling-bling are directly connected;

rockstars, perhaps the most mentally
unsound people on earth, offer proof that
insanity can be cool. The louder the voices in your head, the louder your wardrobe
should be. Swarthmore breakdowns,
while common, remain highly personal
matters.

DANA SEAY
Hip-ocrite
It's that time of year again. For many,

early winter is all about sweaters, hot
chocolate, and the approaching holidays
but we Swarthmore students know bet-

ter. Early winter is breakdown season.
We've all got stress, and this is the time of
year that it really sets in. Whether it's the
loss of your summer glow, the cold weather, post-election trauma, or just the smothering, incestuous, soul-stealing, workdriven atmosphere that generally characterizes Swat (which, by the way, the dictionary defines as "to toil"), most of us are
feeling slightly less than peachy keen.

So take a cue from the rockstar and set
your own fashion rules, as strange and
individual as your inner state. If your
breakdown is the loud, angry sort, there
are many avenues at your disposal for
pulling off the perfect perfunctory pose.

Smeared makeup displays chic desperation, at once sloppy and bold. Try smeared
eye makeup, as it is the easiest to do.
Smeared lipstick, an even more daring
move, screams of sexual impropriety and
disillusionment, best attempted during
only the most extreme and dramatic

breakdowns.
Your sadness (hopefully) is only a transient state, so perhaps your look should be
transient as well. The changing of hair
color is a time-tested way of dealing with
a barmy brain. Experimenting with the
tone of your tresses communicates a shifting inner identity, and the more extreme
the shift the louder the color should be;
walk into McCabe one day with neon pink
hair and people can't help but perceive

you differently.

Finally, more than any other mode of
fashion, going Goth is a surefire way of expressing your inner despair
to the world, and the look has the added
perk of making people uncomfortable.
But, because Goth is not exactly in vogue,
try borrowing just a few key elements
depression

Tweens in middle school,
arguably the least fashionable people on earth, are
proof that distress and
impulse shopping go
together.
But there is good news: Stress-induced

insanity and depression can be tres chic if

you embrace the aesthetics of your breakdown. If the enthusiastic and constant
turnaround of Facebook pictures is any
indication, we're all ready to seek control
in our lives through a healthy dose of vanity. Not all early winter breakdowns are
the same, but luckily fashion is nearly as
nuanced as our stress-warped minds.
Feeling fed up with how small Swat is?
Hating your lack of a life outside of schoolwork? Channel this distress into an aloof
mystique. Beatniks got it right: Black is
the ultimate angsty, poetic color. Arming
vourself with a black wardrobe (sharply
contrasted, if you dare, by bright red lipstick unapologetically worn during the
day) and a disaffected heiress stare, you'll
come off looking Parisian and blase
instead of just collegiate and bitchy. Posh
pessimism is easily attained.
But sometimes all you want is a shoulder to cry on, for people to ask you if
you're OK. Stifle your inner feminist and
play dress-up, taking on the persona of the
princess-in-need-of-rescue. Start thinking
of yourself as a damsel in distress, and a
world of accessories you've never even
thought twice about will suddenly seem
like essentials. Pretty kerchiefs to wipe
your mascara-streaked eyes, a shawl to
clutch like an embittered peasant at the
mercy of the elements, and a veiled hat to
conceal your inner essence from the
world. Who knew cries for help could be

from the oh-so-extreme Gothic look. Make
like the Stones and paint it black, adding
drama by wearing black in an unexpected
way. Doing something as simple as taking
one of those big flower pins from seasons
past and dying it black, for example,
ensures that you'll turn a few heads with

your unapologetic and weird display of
sorrow. Just make sure you come up with
an appropriately witty response for why
you mourn, as people are sure to ask
when they take in the sight of your ebony
threads. (I'm sticking with the über-dramatic answer, "The loss of my soul,"
delivered slowly and paired with a dis-

tant, glazed-over look.)

Even if you don't consider yourself a
well-dressed person, someone capable of
pulling off whatever snazzy outfit your
heart desires, you should take the time to
indulge in fashion as an outlet for your
inner angst. 'Tweens in middle school,
arguably the least fashionable people on
earth, are proof that distress and impulse

shopping go together. Aware of the therapeutic effects of style, they scour the
aisles of CVS, imposing order in their
chaotic lives through careful application
of dark blue and black Wet 'n Wild nail
polish and green streaks in their hair.
When your world is spinning out of control, go for a tube of Dr. Pepper Bonne
Belle Chapstick and remember that
you've made it through harder times.

Pop Life
A sense of style makes or breaks an
artist's chances in the entertainment
industry. (Otherwise, there would never be
the forum known as "the red carpet" for
people like Joan Rivers to annoy us with
their analyses of celebrity attire.) It's
therefore understandable that many stars
have taken the hint and formed alliances
with retail companies to create their own
lines of products. From rappers to rockers,
these business ventures have taken over
Hollywood. This craze grows as more
artists try to reap the rewards of imbuing
the common man with their personal
styles.

Last month I found myself shelling out
$5O for Curious, the new perfume by
Britney Spears. Now, normally I'm a levelheaded person and would never spend
money on a celebrity's silly side-project
product. But the perfume seemed to be calling to me, with its crystal blue bottle and
Britney's steamy ad, and before I knew it, I
was out of cash that could have financed a
Target shopping spree.
Reflecting on that experience, I wonder
if I had purchased the perfume because I
was simply a fan of the pop princess or
because I actually enjoyed its scent. Either
way, it is clear that, even though we tout
ourselves as intelligent Swatties, celebrities do know how to sell themselves. And
sometimes even we become pawns in their

rousing marketing schemes.

Ask yourself a serious question: Were

November H 2004

you one of the people who started wearing
Air Force Ones because Nelly rapped
about them? Did you don a trucker hat
because you subconsciously found yourself imitating Pharell and Ashton?
Don't fret if these situations apply to
you. Existing in the Swarthmore bubble
encourages eccentricity and individuality;
we earn praise when our unique qualities
shine in everything we do. But maybe it's
time for a break from the bandwagon of
being different. Once in a while, Swatties
should enjoy some good, old superficial
conformity. And conforming to the fashion
of a celebrity can be, with its awesome
shallowness, a truly liberating action.
So ladies, if you ever get tired of working on your unique Swat image, take a day
off and channel your inner Gwen Stefani,
complete with L.A.M.B. (or wannabe)
purse. Be brave and don those Chloe-esque
sunglasses to remind you of the days when
"Charlie's Angels" was the best chick flick
on screen. Even if you can't afford a pair of
Manolo Blahniks a la Sarah Jessica
Parker, that doesn't mean you can't strut
around campus with your own high-heeled
shoes.
And guys
it's okay to rummage
through your closet and pull out the Air
Jordans you've been hiding. Rock out with
a red cap, like Fred Durst, or go bashfully
preppie like John Mayer (unwashed hair,
faded T-shirt and jeans). Take a chance and
walk into Sharpies wearing your Sean
John like there's no tomorrow. You can
even pull out those old concert T-shirts
you've always wanted to incorporate into
an outfit (Spice Girls, New Kids on the
Block and Hanson included) and reconnect
with your obsessions of the past. The
options are endless.
Just remember, there is a line you can
cross on the fan meter from Cool Fan to
Downright Scary. For example, don't let
Urban Outfitters trick you into thinking
those "I Did Justin Three Times" shirts
and other assorted "Mrs. (insert last name
of cute celeb)" are at all acceptable, under
any circumstances
because they aren't.
Just because you may borrow a celebrity's
name for the sake of fashion, that doesn't
mean you get to have the celebrity him-

self.

Olde tyme
grooming

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Hate the man, love the 'stache
Embracing the tradition of Mustache November at Swarthmore

Good grooming is hard
to find in Philadelphia. Go
to Olde City on a Saturday
night, and you'll see plenty of terribly plucked eyebrows, scruffy beards and
slicked-back Guido-style
hair. So there's definitely
something to be said

CHRIS ATANASIU
Cross the Tracks

about the guy who makes
the effort to look (and
maybe even feel) his best.
Men in smaller communities used to go to barbershops to get haircuts

and keep track of neighborhood affairs. Modern
salons provide much more
of an in-and-out haircut
experience, and most men I know would prefer the barber to
the more-feminine spa anyway.
In any case, most men these days have never had a
straight-razor shave. The idea of letting someone that close
to sensitive body parts with a highly sharpened razor is a
little frightening at first, but you can't get a better shave any
other way. Your particular brand of razor might have eight
blades, four aloe vera strips, and all sorts of pivots to avoid
cuts and burns, but it will still leave you feeling like sandpaper compared to the results of a straight razor. It certainly can't hurt when a significant other notices that your face
is twice as soft as it's ever been.
Owned by the Sgarra Brothers, Shaving Grace started as

the barbershop in Philadelphia's traditionally blue-blooded,
old-money Racquet Club. An instant hit, business grew from
the members at the Philadelphia Racquet Club to include
locations at the Borgata in Atlantic City and in Exton.
Feeling a lot more like an English gentleman's club (the
kind without strippers) than a barbershop and the closest
thing to a men's spa than anything this side of a private club
Shaving Grace gives you a massage, facial, haircut and
straight-razor shave all for about $l3O. Individual services
cost significantly less, but the package made it into
Philadelphia Magazine's Best of Philly gifts for 2003.
While it's certainly a little expensive, you also get a good
Dominican cigar and a pint of Stella Artois with every service, package or not. These should keep you occupied as you
play cards or pool in their wood-paneled, leather-couched
waiting room. You might just find yourself thinking you've
been taken back to a classier time, when it didn't really matter if you waited another 15 minutes, all in the name of good
service. Tweed suit, anyone?

it yourself. Back in the day, men used to use straight razors
to shave daily. The Black Cat Cigar Company, besides providing a great place to find gentlemanly gifts for the men in
your life, is probably the only place in Philadelphia to buy a
straight razor, badger-bristle shaving brush, or mentholated
shaving paste. Using a razor on yourself isn't as hard as it
sounds, though the less steady-handed among us might
want to use extreme caution. Real shaving brush and cream
are also unexpectedly luxurious items that make great gifts
during the holidays.
Lastly, I must mention

Mustache November. You might
have seen the signs of stubble all around you, and I encourage all of you to grow what you can. If growing your facial
hair thick and full for the pleasure of shaving it off isn't reason enough for you, you still have to admit that Tom Sellack
and Burt Reynolds pulled off their handlebars in an awesome way. So this month, get ready to groom.

Mustaches have been embraced,

of this world's greatest leaders have

Safety first
No student should ever be in a situation where
he's being threatened and intimidated by armed
strangers from off campus. Yes, such incidents are
relatively rare, but we've had incidents of assault,
attempted kidnapping, burglary and rape occur
before, many of which could have been prevented by
simple security measures. It's pure foolishness to
claim we must wait for these incidents to become
more frequent or more egregious before we address
them.
For instance, it's hard to prevent a few irresponsible students from propping dorm doors for their own
convenience, but there are things the college could do
to prevent it. Giving doors electronic locks opened by
our student ID cards would save students from having to remember their keys as well as their IDs when
leaving their rooms, decreasing the need for propped
doors, and also making more feasible the possible
solution of auto-locking doors for individual rooms
a serious inconvenience, but one that would greatly
reduce the ease of casual theft and the ability to enter
others' rooms by force.
And following the steps of other schools that set
off loud, irritating alarms when doors are kept
propped open too long would help reinforce our commitment to enforcing campus security over some students' few seconds' worth of convenience. Similarly,
we need to end the official practice of keeping Parrish
doors unlocked 24 hours a day and subjecting Parrish
residents to unequal risk of assault or theft. If
Parrish needs to be accessible 24 hours a day, then
Parrish doors can become accessible to all students
or staff with keys, but there's no reason that any
building on campus needs to be accessible to random
strangers 24 hours a day.
Finally, one major crime deterrent on other campuses is the presence of highly visible blue-light public phones that students can use to call campus police
if they're being followed or threatened. Our campus
has a comparative dearth of public telephones, and
given that we have numerous poorly lit routes across
campus students often pass through late at night, this
is an unconscionable oversight.
Of course these policies would inconvenience people and reduce Swarthmore's free-flowing traffic and
image of a safe, Utopian community. But such an
image is probably a false one
Swarthmore is not
very far from the urban center of Philadelphia or
high crime-risk areas like Chester, after all, and we
would rather the administration actively take steps
to prevent a future tragedy now than be forced into
doing so by negative publicity and lawsuits after a
preventable assault, kidnapping or murder occurs.

ML party shout-outs Registrar props
Dear Editor:

The Mary Lyon RAs would like to thank everyone who
helped at the ML Halloween party. Of course, the residents
of Mary Lyon dorm contributed heavily to having the awesomely successful party. The RAs thank the Decorations
People, Homeland Security and the Clean Up Crew. Some
"campus people" proved to be invaluable. We are giving a
huge shout-out to the Party Associates, who did an amazing
job. A special thanks go to the Public Safety officers; thanks
for doing a great job. Later on in the evening, when things
got interesting, we would really like to thank the people
who helped in crowd control. Of course, personal thanks to
the Swarthmore police officers, for being so helpful.
We hope everyone enjoyed Scary Hawaiian Mary Lyon!

Warner goes beyond duty in election
Dear Editor:
On behalf of all the students, we would like to thank

Registrar Martin Warner and many other faculty, staff

and administrators for their services to the Swarthmore
community in mobilizing registration and voting efforts

for the Nov. 2 elections. We especially would like to recognize Martin Warner for his tireless support of and advice
to the Swarthmore Voter Registration Coalition. His
understanding of the importance of this election for young
voters and for the country as a whole was integral to making us all realize the significance of our roles in the democratic process. He went far beyond his duties as registrar
and administrator of the college. Hats off to you, Martin
Warner!

ELECTION 2004: SWARTHMORE RESPONDS

Facing political reality Eternal sunshine of the apathetic mind
Swat liberals blinded by elitist prejudice
If you are an American citizen, George W. Bush is your
president. It does not matter
that you have been indoctrinated by the liberal bastion
that is Swarthmore College.
John Kerry lost and will likely
fade into political obscurity.
Swarthmore students, it

seems, cannot come to grips

with this fact. The recent buzz
around campus has been a

supposed study linking blue
states with high IQs and red
states with low IQs. Taking
this as fact, Swarthmore students find solace in their

belief that President Bush was
reelected by the relatively

unintelligent

portion

of

America's population.
If you really believe this study's claim that Connecticut
has an average IQ of 113 and Mississippi has an average IQ of
85, perhaps it is not the red states' intelligence you should be
questioning. I have scoured the Internet for the source of
these data, but have yet to find one. Further, sizeable
populations voted for Bush and Kerry in many blue and red
states, respectively. It is thus illogical and divisive to claim
that the United States exhibits such geographically polarized
levels of intelligence.
Perhaps more egregious than ranking states by intelligence is that fact that the same chart also gives a breakdown
of purported average incomes, suggesting that Republican
voters tend not only to be stupid, but also poor. While I am
certain that these data are incorrect, it may indeed be the
case that much American wealth is concentrated in the
Northeast and West Coast, which obviously went to Kerry in
this election. If wealth and education are correlated, then
many Bush states, assuming they have lower levels of
income, are also relatively uneducated compared to Kerry

states.

But what does one gain by accusing Mississippi of going to
Bush because it is poorer and less educated than Connecticut?
Does the social status of Mississippi residents make them less
adept at deciding whom they want to sit in the Oval Office?
This is especially intriguing because Swarthmore students
spent months attempting to enfranchise Chester's poor,
uneducated population in the name of non-partisan social justice. The primary difference between residents of Chester and
their economically similar counterparts in the Midwest and
South that Chester residents are black and tend to vote for
Democrats.
This fact gets at the very core of Swarthmore's brand of

liberal elitism. Students here want to give underprivileged
Americans the opportunity to vote, but those Americans
better be minorities and vote for Swarthmore's candidate of
choice.

boils down to the fact that many
Bush supporters do indeed place high priority on their own,
different set of "moral values." Whether you like it or not, it
is their constitutional right to do so. Rather than acknowledge this fact, it seems that Swarthmore students would
rather convince themselves that these people are simply
The difference

ignorant.

really

This is again indicative of Swarthmore's gross elitism.
Politics here is not a question so much as a set of undeniable
truisms: This country needs to enact gay rights, nationalize
health care, legalize marijuana, pay reparations for slavery
and apologize to the world for inciting global jihad. Each of
these issues, however, is highly debatable. Swatties may view
their positions as logical and rational, but the "logical" voter
and "moral" voter each cast an equally weighted ballot on
Election Day. Perhaps students' efforts to affect national
elections would be well served to recognize that Swarthmore
logic is not, in fact, universal.
If you wish to accuse red states of having misaligned values, it is your right to do so. To accuse them of intrinsic ignorance, however satisfying it may be, merely exposes your own
lack of understanding. Fortunately for your sake, you have
four years to realize the futility of this attitude and recognize
the need to engage, not alienate, the majority of this country.

What motivates faith-based voting?
In the days following the election, I've heard many
conversations about why and how George W. Bush
became president for a second term. Many primarily
blame Christian-based populations, and suggest that
religious value systems are not clear-sighted or are
somehow deficient.
Personally, as a faith-based voter, my priorities are
not aligned with those of the current administration,
and I find it confusing how conservative religious
groups, at times claimed to be wary of big spenders and
increasing government intrusion into private lives,
rally around a president in favor of both these things.
Further, it is confusing to me the way that Bush puts
faith into practice. In support of a "culture of life"
(debate transcripts from debates.org) Bush justifies cut-

ting funding for family-planning organizations which
sometimes provide abortion counseling, including aid
organizations fighting the spread of HIV internationally.
However, 31 percent of the budget is dedicated to violence and death, and Bush does not seem troubled by
increasing violent military conflict worldwide (budget

As a faculty member at Swarthmore, I want to thank
Ivan Boothe and Mark Hanis for their letter to the editor
"Why won't our faculty speak out?" (Nov. 4, pg. 17). I
agree with them that those of us who feel strongly about
issues have an ethical responsibility to make our voices
heard, both on campus and off. Many faculty members
already do this in ways that may not be visible to Boothe
and Hanis.
Nevertheless, their general point remains correct. As
part of my own personal commitment, I want to encourNovember

want to extend an invitation to attend a faculty symposium this spring semester (date to be announced) on
religion and politics, which follows the symposium last
year on religion and violence. Both are part of a broader
initiative that I have been working on called "Making the
Humanities Matter" at Swarthmore. In the coming days,
our voices are going to be more important than ever.

problem

with

Swatties is that we act too
much like Democrats.
I'm not talking about
our liberal values or our
priorities for the country.
As far as those go, Swatties
and the Democratic Party
have got it right. What I am
talking about is a concept
with which George W. Bush
seems especially familiar,
as he revealed by pronouncing it correctly last
week. I'm talking about

political capital.
Roughly speaking, the

Swarthmore
student and the prototypical Democrat have the same set of ideals. They both think it's
the responsibility of the fortunate and the powerful to
fix societal structures that bear people into inopportune circumstances and to help those already stuck there.
But the Democrats, for whatever reason, just can't seem to
take the reins of power for long enough to make good on
those
good intentions. Theirs has been a 40-year downward spiral,
punctuated only briefly by the Carter and Clinton years. The
political capital simply has not been there
and after last
week, things are not looking up.
As good liberals, we like to attribute the Democrats' recent
failures to the deception machinery of the Republican Party or
the brute stupidity of 51-plus percent of the American
population. But whom we lash out at is beside the point. The point is
that to make a difference in the country, the Democrats desperately need to be in power.
At the political science department's "What Now?" panel
last week, professor Cynthia Halpern suggested that a new
left
wing is the way to move the liberal agenda
an analogue, she
said, to the civil rights movement. Working within the political
system alone, she suggested, is futile.
Well, guess what, Professor? There's no impetus for
anything on that scale not now, not for a while. Wronged and
disenfranchised as they are, homosexuals and potential abortion-seekers are not going to rally around a modern-day Martin
Luther King anytime soon, and not only because they don't constitute the visible and embittered ten percent of
the country's
population that blacks did. As for the poor and poorly
educated,
yhr Republican machinery is playing them like a
fiddle.
These days, you see, the political landscape is different than
it was 40 years ago. These days, the system holds all the cards,
and so, therefore does the party in power.
Which brings me to Swatties. Swatties have always tended
to work outside the system. Anti-slavery activists and women's
rights activists were among our founders, and their change-theworld method of choice has never left the Swat psyche.
But while it retains its romanticism, has activism lost its
potency? By launching into the non-profit world instead of pursuing political or corporate influence, are Swatties confining
themselves to the same irrelevancy as the Democratic Party?
Think of the ten decisions you consider most influential in
terms of the social justice or injustice they have conferred on
the country. Then find out who made those decisions, and go
read their resumes. Are these the resumes of activists? Or
are
they the resumes of people who recognized that being in the
position to make those decisions required climbing
ladders not
quite as romantic as perhaps they might
have liked
prototypical

corporate, legal and governmental?

Activism has an opportunity cost: the development of our
own kind of political capital. In the wake of Bush's re-election
there are some things
tax cuts and Social Security reform,
for instance
over which no liberal will be able to have an
impact. As students still in the midst of developing
our own
political capital, it may not be worth the opportunity cost to try.
Of course, there are some institutions the Supreme Court
and the education system come to mind
that will have snowballing repercussions through all of society if befouled. Of
activist causes, it is these we are truly obliged to try to protect.
But there is a balance to be struck. If the Democratic Party's
predicament is any example of a position one does not want to
be in, we need to get real. Activism might be romantic and
enticing, but the Republican Party is too smart to let it have any
real effect. Idealism is better served by developing our own
political capital now than by nursing impotence later.

Last Tuesday, when most of

called a friend back in Chicago.
"Yeah, the world sucks,"
cheerfully chirped said friend,
an avid Kerry supporter. "But

percent!" This is Illinois, guys:
a state that produced Dennis

until last year, boasted 26 consecutive years of Republican

governors. But, this time
around, 55 percent of Illinois voters chose Kerry for president.
Coincidence? I think not. The fervor that Barack Obama has
stirred up in Illinois in the past six months is contagious, urging people to think critically about how government policy
affects their own lives, to hope for more than a couple of tax cuts
and a free flag in the mail. (It also doesn't hurt that everyone
wants to either marry or jump him, including my dad.)
So, instead of kicking off four years of communal mourning,
we might take a look at the strategies Obama is using to reach
America (besides his cute little ass), and how this new brand of
politics has the potential to change the world.
In his keynote speech at the DNC, Obama invoked the
"magic" of America: the promise of equal rights, the by-yourbootstraps idealism (as in his own life story), the revolutionary
freedoms of speech and press. This guy spoke about dreams, for
God's sake, MLK-style, without cracking an ironic smile.
And this new "dreamy" politics is not just about catchphrases. Barack talks about helping union workers keep their jobs,
helping parents pay for their kids' diabetes drugs, giving high
schoolers who figure they'll end up at Burger King hope of
attending college. Is it not dangerously radical to propose health
care for every child in America, full Head Start funding,
thousands of new teachers for at-risk schools and major funding
for renewable energy?
Actually, these "dreams" are in the interests of almost every
American. Most of America is not rich. The wealthiest five
percent of this country gets a third of the national income. Most
Americans need help getting medical care, keeping their jobs,
getting their kids to college. Obama shakes people out of the
party mindset and wakes up the one-issue voters. He reminds
people that they care more about saving lives and putting food
on the table than they do about keeping Halliburton afloat and
gay people in their closets. A new, post-election vision for
American politics means urging people to think about what
really matters in their own lives, instead of thinking of politics
as a sort of formal battleground for the ingrained socio-moral
positions about which no one's going to change their minds.
Barack also does something risky and weird and incredibly
un-sawy: He assumes a basic human goodness. "If there's a
child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters
to me, even if it's not my child," he said at the DNC, to thunderous applause. "Out of many, one." No political candidate has
dared to invoke the basic human sentiment of sympathy. If
other Democrats pick up on this message in the coming years,
we could truly be in for a revolution.
It's condescending and insulting to assume that W won on
Tuesday because Americans can only identify with a stupidsounding president. As we seek out a candidate for 2008, and,
perhaps more importantly, begin to rethink our political
strategies on a state and local level, we might think about what
this "identifiability" really means. Maybe people have given up
on the possibility that government can actually make a difference in their lives. That's why they're making decisions based
on which guy was more popular in high school and looks better
in hunting gear. But, as Obama has shown, people really wake
up when they see their hopes (and not just their pickup trucks)
reflected in their candidates. And those hopes are, at bottom,
remarkably similar for most Americans.
If we're going to do more than beat up Bush or elect a
Democrat in 2008, neither of which will change our lives and the
world, we need to start thinking in Barack mode. Maybe
government really can help people realize their dreams, instead
of simply providing fodder for the Onion. Maybe, instead of
seceding from the Union, those of us dissatisfied with our current lump of a president can start to think about what a "union"
would really look like, and how to get there. Change can happen
inside of this country. Besides, Finland is really expensive.

editor

Alberti's assumptions belittling, offensive
Dear Editor:
As a Sharpies staff member, I was personally offended
by the thinly veiled condescending nature of some of Joe

Alberti Ws recent statements. Joe Alberti 'o6's Oct. 28
("Schall's stonewalling on Sharpies, pg. 14) that
attempted to describe how vital employee's positions at
Sharpies are to them included the extremely offensive
line, "Without their jobs, they would have nothing." To
state that Sharpies employees have "nothing" without
their jobs implies that no one has sufficient abilities to
qualify for employment elsewhere.
My fellow employees are honest and hardworking
people from all walks of life who have accomplished
much more than Alberti acknowledges. Besides the fact
that most of the staff has acquired more wisdom with age
than Alberti's years permit, some have also completed a
higher level of education. One employee holds a master's
degree, and several others hold bachelor degrees.
Within the ranks of Sharpies' staff there is an informational risk manager, a professional singer, a single

letter

mother

working

toward a

college degree,

a private

business co-owner, a former businessman who has
worked with the U.S. embassy, several accredited cooks
and some high school and college students, to name a few.
Some students may remember Zakir Khandkar, who was
featured in the Oct. 4, 2001 issue of The Phoenix
("Immigrant doc offers Sharpies fare, medical advice,"
pg. 5) because of his position as a Bangladeshi doctor
working toward an American license. There are also
many first-generation American employees who have
afforded their children a good education and opportunities that they didn't have themselves.
Another particularly disturbing and offensive claim

November IX 2004

made in Alberti's original Sept. 30 letter ("Managers mis-

treat Sharpies employees, Sept. 30, pg. 10) insinuated
some employees are specially chosen and hired because
they "won't complain and demand equality ... Many staff
are part of special programs, making them blind to the
unfairness that exists." The dining services department
has received accolades for its welcoming of special-needs
employees. To imply that certain people are hired specifically because they won't be able to understand if they
are mistreated is not only an insult to those in charge of
hiring, it is also a slap in the face to and a devaluation of
those employees who are working hard in spite of per-

sonal challenges.
As a local resident, I came to work at Sharpies in 2000
as a high school junior for my first part-time job and had
a wonderful experience. In September 2002,1 enrolled in
La Salle University and decided to use my dining hall
expertise in their cafeteria doing a similar job. I lasted
half a semester before I decided that although I may be a
student at La Salle, I was still a worker at Swarthmore. At
La Salle, I made $515 per hour and could not work in
excess of eight hours a week. I was not trusted to do
simple tasks, and another staff member had to evaluate
my area at the end of each night to see if I had cleaned it
properly. I was subjected to a disrespectful and very
unpleasant workplace for the first time. Perhaps Alberti
has not had such an experience, because if he did he
would realize that despite any flaws, Sharpies is "a better
workplace" with higher standards than most work
environments. My fellow employees deserve more credit
than our noble crusader affords us with his unintentionally insulting and belittling assertions..

In the first conference match of
the season, the Garnet men's swimming team defeated a thin McDaniel
squad 78-59 at Swarthmore's Ware
Pool on Saturday.
Andrew Frampton 'OB won two
events to help the Tide to the victory.
Frampton swam solo for the Garnet
in the first event, capturing the 1,000
freestyle in 10:10.56, just shy of the
school record of 10:09.98 set by Mark
Friedberg '9B in 1995. Frampton took
his next victory in the 500 freestyle,
touching the wall at 5:02.61, beating

second-place finisher Mark Wheeler
of McDaniel by over 38 seconds.
"We're really happy with what we're

from our freshmen and how
our sophomores are doing," co-captain Jeff Schneider 'O5 said.
The Tide got off to an early lead,
capturing the first five races of the
meet. The 400-medley relay was won
by Schneider, Kaena Horowitz 'O6,
Wootae Min 'O7, and Andrew Koczo
'O7 with a time of 4:00.8. Frampton's
1,000 freestyle victory came next.

Over the first halfof the NFL season, I've gotten a little sick

MATT SCHILLER

make better NFL picks than a
defensive lineman, well, that
just proves that these predictions are either sheer luck or
that I'm a total idiot. We'll go
with option A for now. I
should point out that I'm a
perfect 0-0 coming into this
week, even against the spread.
Without further ado:

Baltimore at N.Y. Jets:
The Jets are tne worst 6-2 team
in the league, and if they were
2-6, I'd be saying that the Jets are the worst 2-6 team in the
league. Making his first start of the season, Quincy Carter (who
graduated from Georgia with a degree in Sports Studies) should
prepared for what Ray Lewis will do to him. Pick: Ravens.
Pittsburgh at Cleveland: The Browns have developed an
impressive ability to play the best teams in the league close
and then lose in the final minutes. Unfortunately, there isn't
a column in the standings for that accomplishment. Also,
Duce Staley should destroy the Browns defense, if for no
other reason than that I won't be starting him on my fantasy
team this week. Pick: Steelers.
Houston at Indianapolis: If Peyton Manning continues
to improve at his current rate, he should be good for about 600
yards and seven touchdowns against a passing defense that
has given up more passing scores than the Vikings, Broncos
and Redskins combined. Pick: Colts.
Chicago at Tennessee: There is NO way Craig Krenzel
leads a team to victory twice in arow. It doesn't matter that he
held a 3.68 GPA in Molecular Biology at The Ohio State
University. If that's the best thing you can say about an NFL
quarterback, there are problems. Pick: Titans.
Tampa Bay at Atlanta: Here's some logic for you: last
week, Tampa Bay beat Kansas City. Two weeks ago, Kansas
City destroyed Atlanta. Hence, Tampa will beat Atlanta.
Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? Pick: Falcons.
Detroit at Jacksonville: With QB Byron Leftwich out for
the Jags, they'll turn to David Garrard, who is second on the
Conference USA all-time passing list behind none other than
Chris Redman (who couldn't even get a roster spot on the

team that is currently starting the NFL's worst QB, Kyle
Boiler). Not exactly the finest pedigree there. Pick: Lions
Seattle at Saint Louis: Think Seattle might be a little
unhappy after blowing a 17-point lead against the Rams back
in Week Five? Pick: Seahawks.
Kansas City at New Orleans: Think my editors might be
a little unhappy if this column ends up at the 1500 words orso
that it's on pace for? Pick: Saints.
Arizona at N.Y. Giants: New York couldn't possibly lose
to the Bears and the Cardinals back to back, could it? Pick:
Giants.
Cincinnati at Washington: Possibly the only game of the
year in which fans of both teams will be rooting for their own
starting quarterbacks to get injured and not vice versa. Pick:

Redskins.
Minnesota at Green

Bay: Being Randy Moss does not
make your torn hamstring heal in under a week. For some reason, doctors needed three weeks to figure this out. Pick:

Packers.
Carolina at San Francisco: In a press conference last
weekend, 49ers WR Curtis Conway noted that their 1-7 record
indicates they might not be so good. Woah, Curtis, let's not
jump to any crazy conclusions now. Pick: Panthers.
Buffalo at New England: Drew Bledsoe should have an easier time completing passes to the other team ifWR Troy Brown
continues to play cornerback for the Pats. Pick: Patriots.
Philadelphia at Dallas: Terrell Owens handles losing
about as well as Freddie Mitchell handles catching passes
that hit him in the chest. Pick: Cowboys.

ever to win the annual Seven Sisters
Championship at Mt. Holyoke. Hobbs led
the Tide to a third place overall finish. In
the time it takes you to read this article,
Hobbs can run from Parrish Beach to The
Parrish of Our Heavenly Father in
Charleston, South Carolina. And back.

2. Field Hockey breaks Fords' hearts

Beating Haverford is always sweet, but
how about beating the Fords on their home
turf
in double overtime? That's sweeter
than Genevra's homemade cherry pie,
which is famous for filling stomachs and
breaking hearts. On Oct. 26, the Garnet field
hockey team defeated the Fords 2-1 on a
Heidi Fieselmann 'O6 goal with 4:12 left in
the second overtime period. "I was pretty
tired by the second overtime, so the goal
was a relief," Fieselmann said, spelling not
R-O-L-A-I-D-S but instead F-O-R-D-S S-U-C-K
for Swat. Swarthmore goalie Karen Lorang
'O7 made six saves for the Tide to send the
Fords back to their dorms with more tears
...

than a country music awards show.
And the one you've all been waiting for...
if you've managed to stumble this far
through the article.

1 The best fans in the conference'

The best moment of this fall season had
to go to a team that made history and per-

formed better than anyone, even them-

selves, could have hoped. The Garnet men's

soccer team finished 10-5-2 in the regular
season to earn a number-three seed in the
Centennial Conference championships,
breaking a number of school records in the
process. However, the most memorable
moment of the season came in a match the
squad didn't win
a 0-1 overtime loss
against McDaniel last Friday night. The
busloads of fans in the stands gave a standing ovation as the team walked to the bench
after the McDaniel goal, recognizing a
squad and a season that blew away so many
expectations. Hardcore fan Jeff Schneider
'O5 lauded the importance of the team's
accomplishments and the resultant fan support. "One year ago this never would have
happened," Schneider said. "This is the new
face of Swarthmore athletics."

5. Forrest Gump style
The men's cross country team had its

best showing of the season on Oct. 2 at the
Dickinson Short Course-Long Course
Invitational. The Garnet finished second
out of 21 teams in the 4k race, placing five
runners in the top 20. James "Catch Me if
You Can" Golden 'O5 was third in the meet
with a time of 12:59.09. Adam Hunt 'O6 (10th),
Jim Kreft 'O6 (12th), Keefe Keeley 'O6 (18th),
and Ross WeUer 'OB (20th) rounded out the
next four places for Swarthmore, ensuring a
bruising defeat of 19 other teams.

4. Volleyball feasts at home tournament

At its home tournament on Sept. 18, the
women's volleyball team lost only one game
in three matches to take the Garnet Classic
title. The squad devoured Cabrini and Kean
as a pack of furious piranhas would an aging
manatee. Alvernia was the next team to go,
falling in four games (30-26,30-14,23-30,30-20)
to the fearsome Tide in the championship
match. Erica George 'O7 was named tournament MVP, finishing with 36 assists, 48 digs
and 10 service aces in the tournament.

3. Hobbs doubles up
