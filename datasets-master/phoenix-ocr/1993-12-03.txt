Buckley speaks at Swarthmore

Third in conservative series packs auditorium
By Erik Huneke
William F. Buckley, Jr., a
prominent conservative thinker,
addressed a large audience in the
Lang Performing Arts Center on
Thursday, December 2. His was the
third in a series of speeches organized by theSwarthmore Conservative Union and sponsored by the
President's office and the Young
America foundation.
Buckley's speech was, in his
own words, "an attempt to track the
evolutionof theClinton fingerprint,
to try to figure out what at this stage
it is safe to conclude about whathis
political priorities are and what his
political inclinations are." He began by criticizing Clinton's use of
suchmetaphors as "force the spring"
and an attitude that every day he
could go downstairs and find another present "under the Christmas
tree."
These metaphors were themselves the product oftherejection of
the"decadeof greed" and the legacy
of the Reagan presidency. Yet he
pointed out the irony that the desire

Clinton promised to all can also be people to seek lower-cost care.

Students mark World AIDS Day

designated World AIDS Day
was a day of remembrance and
education. SwarthmoreCollege was
no exception to this participation,
which had the theme "A Day Without Art."
According to co-director Petra
Janopaul '94,World AIDS Day was
started to honor and respect people
in the arts who had died from the
disease. Now the day has been
extended to all those who are affected by the AIDS virus.
The day was filled with a series
of events starting with an information table and condom sale in Parrish Parlors. Later in the day photographer and filmmaker Georgia
Mclnnis spoke before showing her
video presentation entitled"Endure
the Winter." The video was a series
ofportraits of thelives andstruggles
of women who were HIV positive.
"I wanted to preserve and capture this moment in their lives. AIDS

is a big problem that will still be
around 10 years from now," said
Mclnnis to a crowd of about 200
students and faculty.
Right after the video a collection on ADDS and the Swarthmore
community was presented and then
followed by a discussion. Fernando
Chang-Muy, assistant dean and director of the Intercultural Center,
Scott Gilbert of the Biology department, Alexandra Juhasz in the English department, andLinda Echols
from Worth Health center spoke at
the collection, each giving a short
talk.
"We should be angry," stated
Juhasz in her speech, "because anger leads to action."
Later on, an Art Non-Opening
reception was given in honor of the
artistic communities which have
been affected by AIDS. No art was
really displayed; instead, art pedestals without sculptures and picture
frames withoutpictures were set out
to signify theloss ofartists who died
as a result of AIDS.

at th« 3 reception were
then allowed to create their own art
as a wayof honoring AIDS victims
and as "a way for people to work
things out," explained Janopaul.
A screening of the Safer Sex
video and workshop took place in
Kirby. "It was supposed to be a day
of mourning as well as educational
to try and encourage people to make
a change and to get people to talk
and discuss the AIDS issue," said
Janopaul.
The day ended at midnight as
students gathered around Clothier
Tower and the bells rang in memory
of those whohave died ofAIDSand
to signify that the time had come to
act and to stop the spread of AIDS.
"I came feeling as though I
didn't have much personal connection (to the AIDS issue), and I wanted
to build my awareness. But now I
realize that I do have personal connections," said Sara Breslow '95.

Dean's Official Notice

On Wednesday evening, November 17, 1993, a Dean's Committee met to hear a charge against a student
for "violating an active-avoidance directive issued by the Dean's Committee" on November 13, 1993. Dean
Ngina Lythcott and a student were co-complainants in this matter. The members ofthe Dean's Committee were:
Lynn Westling, Peter Schmidt, Tom Francis, Ruth Lieu '94, and Neal Potischman '95. The Committee was
convened by Joe Mason.
The Dean's Committee reached a consensus that the student was not guilty of intentionally violating the
active-avoidance directive issued on November 13, 1993. However, the Committee did find that the accused
student should have been more diligent in following the active-avoidance directive even if he assumed that the
complainant was not present in the dining hall where the alleged violation occurred.
All sanctions of the November 13, 1993 hearing remain in full effect. As a result of today's finding, the
Committee amended its November 13, 1993 sanctions in the same case as follows:
1. TheDean's Committeefelt that the active-avoidance directive did not provide enough guidance
to cover public areas like the dining hall. Both students should work with thedeans to develop a protocol
that more specifically meets the complainant's needs.
2. The Dean's Committee recommended that working with friends of the two students and the
deans, protocols for communication via the friends be worked out so that the two students can become
clearly aware of one another's presence in the same area.
3. During the first semester upon return after suspension next semester, the defendant will remain
under stricter, more narrowly defined active-avoidance guidelines arrived upon by consultation with
the deans this semester.
4. Probation remains in force: if the accused student is found guilty by any judicial body ofany
violation of the student code while active-avoidance is in effect both this semester and during the first
semester of his return to the College, he will be immediately suspended by the Dean's Office. This
means that the student is on probation for the duration of the active-avoidance.
Both the complainant and the accused student in this case have ten days in which to appeal this decision to
the President of the College.

By Ligeia Jennis and
Andy Perrin
Lynn Etheridge '6B, an independent health policy consultant,
spoke Tuesday on "NationalHealth
Insurance: Issues, Alternatives, and
Prospects."
Etheridge said the U.S. had
entered a "new era in healthpolicy"
with the Clinton Presidency and
the Health Security Act.
"I know many of you students
grew up in the Reagan-Bush era,
when government doing nothing
was the norm," he said. "Now it is
an era where the government is
really doing something."
There are currently 37 million
Americans without health insurance, said Etheridge. Until the
1980s, he said, the trend was toward more and more Americans
having health insurance; since then
thetrendhas reversed and the number of uninsured Americans has
grown.
Along with the general goal
of universal health coverage,
Etheridge pointed to several other
policy goals, including portability
of coverage (people must be able
to use their insurance when away
from home) and efficiency of the
system.

Health care costs are 14% of
the American economy, and alone
make up the Bth largest economy
in the world ("the size of Italy, and
as organized"). Factoring in the
growing cost of health care, "real
wages" are falling at a rate of$ 1,000
per family per year, according to
Etheridge.

All the health care plans before Congress aim for standard
benefits and full portability; they
differ in how they would pay for
the program. Clinton's plan asks
employers to pick up most of the
tab, with workers and government
making up the rest. The Chafee
plan, by contrast, puts most of the
cost on the individual, with some
government payment and no employer mandates. And the Cooper
plan would pay for the plan entirely by government subsidies,
with no other payment mandates.
The traditionalfree market is
failing in the case of health care,
Etheridge suggested, because of
inadequate consumer information,
ineffective institutions, and inappropriate incentives. He suggested
that the quality ofhealth care could
be improved through prevention
programs, community ratings, and
"report cards" for health-careproviders.
Etheridge graduated from
Swarthmore with high honors in
1968, majoring in Economics and
Political Science. He is president
ofhis class. He received his Ph.D.
at the University of Wisconsin,
and then worked at the Office of
Management and Budget on social reform and health care.
Etheridge left the OMB to
work at the Urban Institute and is
now an independent consultant.
He is part of thewell-known Jackson Hole Group, which formed
the intellectual backboneofmuch
ofClinton's health plan.

University officials decided
to act against the fraternity because the T-shirt incident was the
last in a series of problems with
the fraternity chapter. "It was like
the last straw," Chappell said.
"They had been a behavior problem since the mid-1980s. It was
treatment by the university as a

Among other things, fraternity members previously hadbeen
in troublefor vandalism, drinking

Chappell said the university

take action against the fraternity,
which had been ordered to write

The fraternity's case was taken
up by the Individual Rights FoundationofLos Angeles. The settlementreached October 28 thordered

"We're hoping this sends a
clearmessage to university administrators thatthe First Amendment
is not a tool. It's a principle,"
Maura Whalen, a spokeswoman

Chappell said fraternity members were not concerned about constitutional rights because they had

"We have no interest in pursuing anything thatis a violation of

Three year college degrees gaining popularity
By Sunni DeNicola
via College Press Service
If you could graduate in three years
instead of four, saving a quarter ofyour total
bill, would you? Seventy-seven percent of
high school students said yes in a recent
study.
With college being second only to the
purchase of a home as the biggest expense a
family faces, many students and parents are
beginning to inquire about this option. Several institutions are also examining the threeyear degree as one strategy in meeting the
enrollment andfiscal challenges they face.
Of course the accelerated degree is not
new. It hasexisted at most schools for some
time, but only a small percentage ofstudents
took advantage ofit, perhaps because a threeyear degree also means working hard and
abandoning activities such as sports, social
organizations, student government, internships and part-time jobs.
But some officials think this low participation rate is due to programs not being
formalized or advertised in college catalogues.
Often, shortened programs were strictly for
gifted students, or for more enterprising students to work out on their own. Now, with
skyrocketing college costs, students may reconsider.
S. Frederick Starr, president of Oberlin
College in Ohio, and one of the first administrators to advocate a three-yeardegree, sees it
as an option for students whootherwise might
not be able to afford to get a college degree.
He estimates that eliminating one year of
college could reduce costs by 25 percent, or
40 percent if potential income is factored in
for the fourth year.
"This plan actually reduces the cost of a
8.A.," he said. "Everything else, so far,
simply decreases the rate of increase."

Ivory Tower, Elitist Ghetto? "Brady Bill" gun control
Read The New York Times, The Washington Post, or any other legitimate newspaper
and you willfind, unsurprisingly, that there are severe problems thatafflict our country's
humanity. The real question this editorial poses is not how to solve such documented
conditions, but whether or not Swarthmore gives us the tools to make a difference.
In a truly ethical society that is a society based on ethical values every individual
has a responsibility to contribute to the "common good". On what level or in what ways
are we prepared to affect the "common good" in question? Do we have adequate tools
of analysis to possibly plug back into a given community? How practical are the skills
which we refine and sharpen daily? What we are actually trying to determine is the nature
and value of thiseducation we cherish so dearly. Ofcourse we are asking a multitude of
questions in an absence ofanswers; but, we are Swarthmore seniorsand are skilled at the
former and less adept at the latter.
Sometimes the Swarthmore educational experience just seems like a moral vacuum
ofintellectual masturbation.Ahh...ha! Is the acquisition ofthiselite educationfor our own
self-promotion and gratification? Oftentimes, the ego massagefeels so good—helping to
illustrate to us how witty our dialogues and debate can be. But still, do we have any real
preparation for that thing we dub with haughty reservation "the real world?"
Let's do a surface-levelreflection something Swarthmore taught us to do as well as
pose answerless questions in the abstract. For example, doBlack Studies courses actually
prepare us in any real and concrete way to deal with issues like black-on-black violence?
Do Women's Studies courses speak to medically ill working class women who can't afford
adequate health care insurance? In essence, do we ignore class to ourperil when so many
of the problems we study stem from class-related issues?
Ifwe were to actively observe and includeissues ofclass in the discourseofthe debate,
would it be worthwhile anyway? Here's an interesting picture: can you imagine a room
(or classroom if you may) filled with "gangsta rappers" and feminists? Can you see the
feminists calling the rappers and their music "misogynist" and the rappers becoming
dazed in a state of incomprehension only understanding that in their culture and lives
not only is the word "misogynist" meaningless, but such treatment ofwomen is commonplace and accepted? However, the real point at issue is whether the rappers and the
feminists could really engage in meaningful constructive dialogue as opposed to a
discussion that starts nowhere and ends in the same place.
In the "real world" there's that term again we cannot afford the luxury of
engaging in meaningless discourse for eargasmic result. For example, ifyou worked in
public housing, let's say the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to
sound official, you would be required to develop practical solutions for real people with
real issues at stake. In essence, ifyou are aformally trained academic, you are suddenly
required to make your theoretical studies shape, or at least speak to, a viablesolutionfor
effective implementation. The burning question is: "What doesSwarthmore do to enhance
our capacity to make a difference?"
This editorial was not mean to stigmatize or indict any department orfield of study.
In fact, the questions raised are meant mostly for individual reflection reflection which
is aimed at raising consciousness as to what we are, or may be, doing and why. Two
seniors were just thinking that maybe they could contribute to the "common good." Two
seniors "had a dream," so to speak, and wanted to make it a reality not just a "virtual
reality". Suddenly, they wondered if they knew how. DIXI.

Jagath Chandima Wanninayake
My main reason for running for this office is to make the process of founding and chartering a new
organization on campus a smooth and efficient one. With my own experience in founding an organization on
campus (The Forum for InternationalDevelopment) I have firsthand experience in thebureaucratic stepsfollowed
in the process of chartering an organization in Swarthmore College.With this experience, my background in
managing and working with different organizations, and my friendly and outgoing nature, I feel that I can make
the position ofthe charter chair an efficient and approachable one.
I have had extensive experience in managing and in the workings of different organizations in Swarthmore
College and in high schooL I was one of the founders and currently, the managing editorof theSwarthmoreCollege
Forum forInternational Development. I am also an active member of the International Club and a consultant in
thecomputing center. In high school I was thePresident of my house of residence, and a School Prefect in student
government. I was theDirector ofFinance of the Interact Club (Rotary International) and later President, and was
a member and bore office in numerous other clubs and organizations ranging from a-capella groups to athletic
teams. I feel that I have gained an excellent understanding ofthe administrative workings oforganizations and also
gained experience in working with different kinds of people in diverse situations. In addition, I feel that my
amicable nature and relaxed manner would make it very easy for people to approach me and work with me.
I feel that with my experience and personality, I can bring new insight to the Student Council and also make
the Charter Chair an efficient and easily accessible office.

Justin Herring

My enthusiasm lor student representation began in high school. First as a student rep., and then as an executive
board officer, I developed a strong commitment to advancing student interests. For me one of the most attractive
thingsaboutSwarthmore is the strength ofthe student voice. Students haveanimportantrolein virtually every aspect
of the college. I think it's important to take advantage of that, and would like to represent my fellow students as
Charter Chair.
From my arrival I've aspired to getting involved in the student council and its student committees. I started by
earning an appointment to the Social Affairs Committee. There and elsewhere I've been willing to accept
responsibility, and the work necessary to handle it. Because of this I was recently made the treasurer forSAC. My
position in SAC has made me very familiarwith the Budget Committee and its operations.
The Class of '97 is almost athird ofthe studentbody, and I think its important that we be represented on the student
council The Charter Chair especially is likely be dealing with newstudents and their ideas. I feel that many students
would be more comfortable approaching a member of their own class with their concerns and thoughts.
I think the single most important quality for a representative is to be responsive to students. My friends will tell
you I'm virtually always eager to talk I enjoy sharing thoughts with others, and I expect that trait would serve me
well as Charter Chair. I sincerely hope that I have that opportunity. Thank you for your consideration

Balthazar Alessandri
Idecided to run forcharter chairbecause I feel that the
StudentCouncil, atleast in the fashionit currently works,
is undemocratic and lacks transparence about the way its
decisions are made. If I were elected to the position of
charter chair, my chief concern would be to change that
situation. IthinktheStudentCouncil as it works currently
is not adequately fulfilling its role of a representative

Marjey Ghenne
Before the dawn of time, when I applied to this
school, I searched through the Student Handbook
and circled all the groups I wanted to join when I got
here. My choices ran the gamut, all the way from the
now-defunct Women in the Sciences, to Chester
Tutorial and Motherpuckers. Sadly, now that I'm
here, I 'find that time has allowed me to participate in
only a fraction of these organizations, but I am still
amazed and impressed by the number and variety of
choices we have of things to involve ourselves in.
We can laugh in the face of death and play rugby, or
escape the rigors of academia and sing with the
Gospel Choir or any ofthe other musical groups. It
seems that no matter what you like to do (be it rock

climbing or rde playing), you can find others here
who share that interest The Charter Chair makes
these choices available to us, by providing us the
opportunity to form new clubs and create more
ways to make our time here that much more
worthwhile. Allow me the opportunity to fill this
position, and I will always make myself easily
available to those who would like to create new
groups. In the years I've been at Swat, I have never
quite known who was on SC or how to find them.
If given the chance, I will make it my priority to be
easily accessible and approachable to all students

assembly of the student body. In fact, its claims to
representation arerather shallow. The position ofcharter
chair,l think,is by itsvery nature theideal position to try
and do something about thissituation. Ascharter chair,
I will develop a closer contact with the student body,
particularly with students who have projects of forming
new student organizations. I think many interesting
projects have been killed this semester by the current
Student Council without substantial justification. One
other reason I want to run for charter chair is that the
charter chair is by right a member of the budget
committee, and that one of my main concerns would be
to promote more transparence in the way thisinstitution
functions. Here are my concreteproposals: 1)Publish all

dollars ($250,000) without anyone's knowing precisely
where and how the money is spent I think thatis gravely
wrong.4)Organize monthly"Meet the members of your

student project that has been refused a charter by the
Student Council to appeal that decision.

Community service needs political consciousness
'...t0 comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable'
By Andy Perrin
Two of the things that have made S warthmore students famous over the years are their
near-legendary status as political activists and
their renowned commitment to community
service. The two tendencies are often lumped
together—both when praising and when criticizing the college—but in fact they haveexperienced a more tortuous coexistence over the
years than might be expected.
The classic disagreement is between the
activist who accuses the community volunteer
of putting 'band-aids over bulletholes' and the
volunteer who charges the activist with bringing herabstract political ideas intootherpeople's
'real world' lives.
Both accusations have merit; community
service divorced from its political context is, at
best, naive, and at worst counterproductive.
Similarly, political action separated from its
community roots is esoteric and, again, counterproductive. What is needed is a creative
synthesis between the two: a way of doing
community service thatis simultaneously concrete and politically liberating.
Community service is always political.
The problems community service tries to address—hunger, illiteracy, poverty, disenfranchisement, and so on—are unquestionably
political ones. They have theirroots in a political system and the very act of taking an interest
inpeople less fortunate is a political statement;
itis staking a claim in thepolitics of liberation.
Some people—including a former director
of CIVIC, the college's volunteer program—have suggested that doing community service
with an associated political analysis amounts to
'activist imperialism.' From this point of view,
community volunteers should do nothing more
than serve food, distribute clothing, and hammer

nails. They should deliberately avoid thinking
about their experiences and discussing the possibilities of political change.
That view ignores thefact that in ignoring
the political and social underpinnings of social
injustice, we perpetuate them. It is a political
decision to avoid politics, because it says to the
people we work with, 'we don't consider it
important to change the conditions that cause
injustice; we think it's enough to fiddlearound
the edges.'
Ultimately, ignoring the systematic injustice
that underlieshomelessness, poverty, racism, sexism, illiteracy, hunger, and so on is an excuse for
keeping that injustice going. Whether it does so
consciously or unconsciously, community service is political. The question is only whether it
will enterpolitics on the sideofliberation oron the
side ofcontinued oppression.
Any worthwhile political action has its
roots in community needs. The reason to engage in political action is a belief in social
change leading to liberation.That requires two
things: an analysis of oppression and a commitment to changing it. Those basic premises are,
in turn, bom out of an idea of the needs of a
community that are far greater than can be met

through soup kitchens and thrift shops.

A theory of political action that excludes
the active involvement of the oppressed is
useless. A political practice that is unrecognizable by the people it is supposed to liberate is
every bit as short-sighted as community service devoid of political analysis.
Political action is community service on a
grand scale; community service is political
action made real and concrete. They sometimesfind themselvesat odds with one another
because when either one is done wrong it sees
its enemy in the other.
During the Depression, political organizing circles in American cities ran soup kitchens, doling out soupwith one hand and encouraging 'customers' to develop a political consciousness with the other. They were, in large
part, successful. They succeeded because they
balanced the concrete, everyday needs of their
constituents with the broader goal of political
liberation that fit the current situation exactly.
Swarthrhore's activists and volunteers
need to develop a model that can do the same
thing. As long as the poliucal community and
the community service groupremain separate,
neither one can reach its full potential.

lives. How should affirmative action work?
How much weight, if any, should be placed
on hiring faculty members of color? What
about for classes on race and racism? What
are the merits and drawbacks of having student groups formed on the basis ofrace? We
cannot believe or even act as if these questions have clear-cut right and wrong answers. It is our responsibility as students,
teachers, and administrators to continually
ask questions concerning the very basis of
what we are learning and why. If we do not,
and if we had not, we would end up with a
truly dead and infinitely limiting education.
Mr. Trebelhorn states that "the organs
of power here at Swat don't seem to be
stomping out this small group of conservatives" and that "the Conservative Union is an
accepted Swarthmore Collegeorganization."
As many battles as are waged on our campus
about feeling oppressed or silencedby forces
that are not obviously visible or blamable, I
am surprised that Mr. Trebelhorn believes
that the administration is the "organs of
power" at this college, or that administrative
support makes the Conservative Union an
"accepted Swarthmore College organization." From my own gauging of student
response, I do not feel that there is a pervasive atmosphere of what I consider acceptance. No, the conservatives are not being
physically runoff campus, but they certainly
are being harassed, shunned, and told to shut
up. To me, this means they are not accepted
on this campus.
Mr. Trebelhorn writes, "If the day
comes when they are threatened because
of their ideologies, I will defend their
right to speak." It is my belief that "conservatives" are threatened because of
their ideologies, and that, at this time
and place, they do need defending.
What much of this comes down to are
some of the very issues of our perceptions of
merit which I mentionedearlier. I am pleased,
encouraged, and excited by the "conservative" voice because I personally feel chat
many of the issues which they have raised
are of great importance. As I strive to be a
student before being a "liberal" or a "conservative", I feel that homosexuality, feminism, abortion rights, and political correctness, among other things, are all important
and complicated issues which deserve to be
examined from as many perspectives as are
possible for me to comprehend. If there is a
point of view which does not stand up to
whatever tests to which I can put it, then I
will reject it. In the same way, if it does stand
up to my tests, no matter how unpopular,
contradictory, or difficult, I will do my best
to incorporate this new view into my opinions.
I share Mr. Trebelhom's hope and challenge for other members of the Swarthmore
community, especially students, to "look
closely at the views expounded by the conservatives." I do hope that we will look
closely enough, and discuss thoughtful iy
enough, so that we will cease clinging to any
views which are unsupportable, whetherliberal or conservative. I hope to see Swarthmore becoming an environment where challenging and changing one's views, even those
which we may believe are at the root of our
identities, is not seen as weakness, but as
strength.

Sincerely,
Briana Shay

Member-at-Large

To the Swarthmore College community,
I would like to present my candidacy as Member-at-Large for Student Council. My name is
Vittorio Agnesi. I'm a first-year student from Mexico. My previous experience with studentadministrationrelations is that of treasurer, vice-president, and president of the Student Council in
my high school. I truly miss organizing events and helping other students, and strongly believe that
increased student involvement is necessary to continuously improve the community in which we
live. Because this will be my new "home" for the next four years, I want to make sure it is the best
environmentpossible for all of us. Even ifI* m only a first-year, I have developed a deep appreciation
for Swarthmore and all thepeople who makeit the great college it is. I would love to once again be
a voice of thestudents to the administration, and though I enjoy Swarthmore as it is, I am also aware
that changes are needed. I thus commit myself to try my hardest to bring those changes about, and
to voice your concerns. I thank you for your support and interest.

My name is Darin Friess and I want to be the
Student Council Member-at-Large. Personally, I am
not large, but my experiences and ideas are. I have
recendy finished my tenure as the Budget Committee
treasurer, and am looking for new ways to involve
myself with die workings of this campus. Due to my
experience, I know how finances work for student
groups better than anyone on this campus. I am also
currently sitting on a student life committee. Things
are happening fast on this campus, and I want to be a
part of it AsBC treasurer,I showed that Ican getthings
done. Please allow me die chance to continue that
record on student council

My name is Margaret Cohen and I am a sophomore here at Swat For the last yearand a half, I have
found that the quality of this college experience is a careful blend of academic, extracurricular, and social
affairs. I am a firm believer that the success of the latter two is in the handsof the studentsthemselves and
it is up to us to make these aspects the best they can be. I know much of the student body and would like
to learn more about the workings of the Student Council so that I can help implement the things I know
the students want Iam interested in several aspects of studentlife, including improving our social activities
and our communications with the administration. I would like to get involved with the Student Council
so that I can act onsome of these issues.
Throughout high school, I did similar work for my class; I am a good organizer, and I am willing to
make necessary time commitments. I think that the position of Member-at-Large is one that is suited for
the type of involvementfor which I am looking and I am veryinterested in becoming apart ofSwarthmore's
Student Council. Thanks for taking the time to read this platform

Matt St.Clair

Member-at-Large

I've been involved in many political activities, including serving on theAda County Democratic Central
Committee, being Vice-President of Swarthmore's College Democrats, and being a Page in the Idaho State
Legislature. I've always enjoyed political activities. Working on dieClinton/Gore campaign in Idaho, I was in
charge of the campaign's budget, set up press conferences, and dealt with the media on a daily basis.
The possibility of serving on the Student Council here at Swarthmore intrigues me because of the
differences between working on an issue ofnational importance, and issues with more local impact It excites
me to know that my decisions as a memberofStudent Council would have an immediateeffect on the student
body of Swarthmore.
I consider myself uniquely qualified andexperienced. I would love to serve the students of Swarthmore
College as a memberof StudentCouncil. I would considerit a privilege, and a charge of serious responsibility.

arrived here at Swat in the class of 97 and I want to

want something to happen, all you have to do is DO it.
There are a lot of really cool things here that I want to
stay the same, but there are also some things thatcould

Dave Hordiner

College Planning Committee

There are three interrelated issues which I believe best represent my platform and my concerns
about Swarthmore: studentparticipation, community,
and social integration.
First, I strongly believe that studentparticipation
in the decision making process is the only way that
students can develop an obligation to die college and
ensure Swarthmcre's progress. I feel that the administration, faculty, and studentsoften have differentagendas, and because of die lack of student involvement,
important student issues continue to stagnate. I believe
that students, faculty, andadministration need to make
a greater effort to openlines ofcommunication with
eachother. This could be accomplished bypublicizing
existing opportunities for direct involvementandalso
by creating new ones. Students need a forum for the
debate of issues and ideas.
I also believe that the Swarthmore community is
becoming increasingly atomized. Student participation would bea first step in developing our community.
In addition, I support working toward improving
Tarble as a student union where everyone would be
welcome, and I also support implementing a free hour
for collection each week.
To carry this thought further, I believe that we are
not concentrating enough of our energy on our social
growth outside of the classroom. We must create an
atmosphere more conducive to communication be-

tween individuals and groupsand encourage activities
which are enjoyable and relaxing. These changes

wouldprovide a needed community setting at such an
academically rigorous institution.
These issues are becoming increasingly impor-

I am currendy a first year studentand I am running for theposition ofrepresentative totheCollegePlanning
Committee.My experience is as follows: in grade school I was a yearlyrepresentative as well as presidentof the
Student Council, and in high school I worked as a class president, as well as class representative to several other
committees.Overall I have worked on projects that consisted oforganizing group events (class field trips (one
to the circus)) and picnics, fund raisers, and making changes in policies and issues with which students were
unhappy such as getting windows put into doors wherepeople constantiy were being injured because of a lack
of viewing space and group goal setting for the academic year.
What I was trying to say with the experience information was that I do have a basic understanding of the
workings of student government and that I understand what the job entails.

Hi! My name is Matt SlClair and I would like to
represent you on the student council as a Member-atLarge. I am the one mistakenly listed as coming from

of the many in this year's freshman class. I feel that our
class needs to have a bigger voice in making decisions that

Cheesebrough(and hopefully also Dave Lane), to give my
class a fair representation in addressing our unique needs
as the largest class ever to attend S warthmore. I will of
course represent the entire student body as well.
I already have been doing my best to represent
Swarthmore and its students against other schools as a

the school in this arena got me interested in representing

As a sophomore, I am running tor the Student
Council position of Member-at-Large because I would
like to becomeinvolved in making sure thatthe issues and
concerns of the student body are addressed. During my
freshman year, I spent much time commiserating with my
friends over the various problems of Swarthmore life.
Amid much talk of transferring and "taking time off," one
central theme seemed to emerge: Swarthmore does not
have the balance between academic and recreational
activities that is essential to a fulfilling college hfe. While
the social aspect is bound to suffer to some degree at a
college of Swarthmore's caliber, maintaining a healthy
balance between socializing and work is a crucial aspect
in the lifeofevery student. As Student Council Memberat-Large, one ofmy primary goals would be providing the
student body with a larger selection of attractive opportunities to achieve that balance.
In working towards this goal, I would attempt to
bring more students togetherin a social environment One
major project that could go a long way towards helping
solve Swarthmore's social deficiencies would be the
gradual transformation of Clothier Hall into an actual
Student Union; in its very nature, this would be a longterm project, but severalminor changes (enhancement of
the game room, installation ofsnack machines, centralization ofcampus-wide social information, etc.) wouldresult
in immediate benefits.
If elected to the position of Student Council Member-at-Large, I would strive toward the goal of providing
better recreational facilities and social functions for the
student body.While this is one ofmy toppriorities, I would
be sure to bring all student concerns to the council in an
effort to represent the entire student body.

Eugene Sonn
College Planning Committee
First, I am running because I'm plain sick and tired
of seeing our committee student government consider
stupid issues. For example, the e-mail announcing this
election mentioned that the college might consider short-

ening Spring and Octoberbreaks. Personally, anyone who
doesn't see the stupidity ofthis proposal shouldn't be on

the committee.
Second, I will work to create an hour in the college's
weekly schedule for some sort ofcollection/student assembly/whatever you want to call it. The administration
has known for a few years that around 80% ofthe student
body favors a weekly collection if time were set aside for
it, yet no one has moved to make this a reality. I feel this
meeting time could solve a lot of problems on campus.
When a serious problem arises, the administration calls a
special collection, butbecause of the shortnotice, only the
people who are deeply dedicated to an issue show up. A
weekly collection/student assembly would give an opportunity for all students to become integrated into running
this school and allow a true student voice to be heard on
serious issues. No longer will thevoices ofactivists and
those who are elected to student council be the only ones
heard.
Finally, I'm just pissed off at how common sense
measures such as putting phones indorm rooms orinstalling
phones in front of dorms (so we don't have to prop the doors
forRenato's orfor friends coming to visit) take forever and
a day to get done at a supposedly "smart" college.
I'm pretty bitter about how things are going on
campus. If you're bitter, angry or justplain frustrated, vote

Stealing the tri-college van
By Megan Hallam
The TRI-COLLEGE SHUTTLE VAN.
We all are familiar with its awe-irfspiring,
powder-blue presence. However, with college spending growing tighter and tighter, the
blue van may soon cease to be an omnipresent
phenomena, relegated instead to the dusty
annals ofSwarthmore nostalgia.
Recently, a memo was sent from Bryn
Mawr to the deans at Swarthmore and
Haverford, proposing that Sunday service of
the tri-college van be discontinued, effective
next semester. Also included in the memo
was the proposal that spring semester, 1994
be used as an evaluation period for Saturday
service, with the option to discontinue that as
well.
The van currently has eight scheduled
weekend runs: five on Saturday, and three on
Sunday. However, Sunday's usage has fallen
to an average of only 2.7 riders between each
stop. The figures for Saturday are slightly
more encouraging, with 5 passengersbetween
stops. Unfortunately, the cost of operating
the van remains high, regardless of the number ofpassengers. All of the figures seem to
support the proposal that weekend van service be discontinued, yet they fail to take into
account the numerous benefits gained from
these van runs.
Having access to three colleges means
three times the social, cultural, and academic
options. The tri-college committee is working on publishing a calendar of events for all
three campuses, and hoping to host a number
of tri-college activities next semester. If the
shuttle is canceled for Sunday, however, students run the risk of being stuck away from
their homecampus until Monday ifthey miss
the last van on Saturday night. This possibil-

ity makes the discontinuationof the shuttle
more than inconvenient. It makes it dangerous and irresponsible. The only safe avenue
for students would then become avoiding
cross-campus visits completely.
How can we form a tri-college community if we can't establish contact with the
other colleges? The tri-college committee is
currently working to prevent this proposal
from becoming a reality, but without support
from the college community, the committee
has no leverage. If you, too, are concerned by
the possible loss of this privilege, please send

All the Rage is exactly that
WSRN reviews the stirring new Kronos Quartet CD
By Justin Paulson

While their last CD-single (At the Grave
Release" shelf at Tower, the prolific Kronos
Quartet has brought us yet another sample of
the cutting edge in contemporary chamber
music. All the Rage is a 16 minute work
written for Kronos by young composer Bob
Ostertag, and it involves techniques of sampling and pre-recorded spoken libretto similar to what the Quartet has already explored
with Istvan Marta's "Doom. A Sigh" and
Scott Johnson's "Soliloquy."
All the Rage is a highly-charged, inherently political, and strongly emotional piece
of music with an unusual history. The composer writes, "All the Rage was developed
from a recording I made of a riot in San
Francisco in October, 1991, which followed
California Governor Pete Wilson's veto of a
bill designed to protect gays and lesbians
from discrimination... I shifted through the
recording and isolated those sections that to

my ear suggested music..."
Samplings of theriot are heard rumbling
in the background except when the libretto is
read; occasionally distinct song-like phrases
and chants can be made out, such as "We're
Not Going Back," "Queers Fight Back," and
"Burn It Up" (the latter being in reference to
the Californiastate office building, which did
indeed catch fire that night). The libretto
(written by Sara Miles) is angry and powerful,
and is read effectively by Eric Gupton on the
recording.
Kronos violist Hank Dutt said it took a
lotof arguing with their producer before they
could record this piece; it was well worth it.
All the Rage is a sign of the times, not only
politically, but musically as well (it is evidence that music can often come from some
very unusual places). The disc is a must-buy
for die-hardKronos fans, and I recommend it
to all. Although most classical connoisseurs
can (and will) live without it, they will be
missing a powerful and important new work.
"All the Rage" is available only on CD.,
and can be found on display in the "Contemporary Composers" section ofTower Records'
Classical Annex in Philadelphia, as well as at
other music stores in the Delaware Valley that
carry Elektra/Nonesuch classical recordings.
The Kronos Quartet is donating its royalties
from the disc to the AmericanFoundation for
AIDS Research.

Art Nouveau
in your room
By Katie Menzer
Over Thanksgiving Break I spent a lot of
time in thedorm rooms of non-Swattiestudents.
Now whileI did not find oneroom that had such
inherently beautiful walls as mine here on 3rd

revolting to our very being in order to become
more tolerant and understanding of those less
fortunate than ourselves) and you would like to
decorateyour room. Yourfirstchoiceisnaturally
a realistically rendered marble statue of a human
body shot through the head, bleeding profusely
from an openknife wound in the chest, and lying
inahuddledmassonthesidewalk. Sometimes the
best artwork is thatwhich is most familiar to you.
However, unless your roommate is willing
to abdicate her bed to the statue and herself go
sleep in the hall, the chance thatyou are going to
be able tokeep this masterpiece in your room is
mighty slim.
So, yournext option,you naturally decide, is
that scalereplica of the Brooklyn Bridge that you
made as your third grade science fair project out
of popsicle sticks and strategically placed duct
tape. Hell, you got second place for the thing,
didn't ya? But, in order to capture the true, giant
expansiveness of the bridge, you did have to
consume 1,267fudgesicles and used a entireroll
of Dad'sfavorite tape, right? It's probably still a
little too big to fit beside the phone on your desk.
The obvious solution is, therefore, postcards. Withalittleplastitakandafewdozencards,
you can quite artistically cover your walls with

affinity. After all, who was the better
companion last Saturday night, your obnoxious,
drunken date or that bottle of Absolut?
So you might as well use that bottle as a
decorative accent for your room. Fill it full of
water and put that stinking plant your boyfriend
gave you (Didn'tyou see that exactkind offlower
on the bushesbeside the steps outside Sharpies?)
to apologize for being a drunken, obnoxiouslush
lastSaturday night Or putsome water witha little
greenfoodcoloring in it, shineyour lamp onit, and
claim that it is art nouveau. You could even go
downstairs to your dorm's laundry room, collect
some dryer lint, shove it in thebottle, put the bottle
in the middleofyour hall, exclaim thatyou are a
Dadaist and that if art no longer has any meaning
then life no longer has any meaning, run screaming to thebathroomof the opposite sex, enter, lock
the door, and cut off a major body part Hey, the
possibilities are endless.
Finally, the last main category that influences our artistic sides issex. Thisis,ofcourse,not
surprising because sex influences all of our other
sides too but I digress. Walk into justabout any
dorm room across the land and there is a 51%
chance thatthat poster of two people kissing on a

They're aerobic creatures;
and they have attitude
By Ethan Borg
Thanksgiving is a day for burping. It is a
day for licking, and sitting, and drinking, and
burping. It is a day for laughing, and picking,
and hugging, and kissing. It is a day for
burping.
Please donot essentialize our burps. There
is more between heavenand burp than there is
in your philosophy. No, a burp is not a static
thing—it is dynamic, it is raw energy, it
changes not simply the environment around
the burper, but the entire world. One burp by
Betty-Lou Farber in Tallahassee, TN blanketed Los Angeles in a repugnant smelling
smog for three weeks. She denies it. Yet, it is
documented. And it is beautiful.
Burps are intelligent creatures. They cannot be held, locked up, or stored in a safety
deposit box. Our burps are alive. They are
aerobic creatures that like to hover around
food such that when we bite into turkey, we
bite into them. They live in the intestinal tract
where sometimesthey feel too much stuffing,
and push things around in all kinds of directions. They are musical too. They have a
burping band—a trumpet, a triangle, and a
reggae singer. They like to travel in groups.
They like to watch us while we sleep. There
are artisan burps; but mostly they are plumbers, part of the proletariat, revolting against
the system.
Please don't get me wrong. Burps have
their flaws. You can have shyburps, or heavy
burps, unclean and smelly burps. You can
have burps that are impatient (seeking other
ways to exit) or burps that are lazy. Charlie
Flats of Waco, TX told reporters that he once
had a burp that took two months coming out.
And when it did, it just sagged in his mouth,
as if it justdidn'tcare whether it came or went.
If you listen quietly and hold your hand
to your ear, and your ear to your friend's
stomach, and press down gently (too quickly
and you'll frighten it), you just might hear one
sloshing around. If you do, please whisper
something to it for me: "Burp, can you play
any Bob Marley?"

NFL Week 14 Picks
Another slow week for Rob.
By Rob Utley
WeekFourteen has thefull NFL
complement of games as the 199394 regular season begins to wind
down. As always, home teams are
listed first.
Cowboys vs. Eagles(Mori): If
you saw the Cowboys-Dolphins
game on Thanksgiving Day, then
you know that the Cowboys will be
looking to (Leon) Lett their frustrations out on the Eagles this week.
Philly finally ended their losing
streak against the hapless Redskins
last week. But can you say "the win
streak will end at one game"? I
knew you could. Winner: COWBOYS.
Bears vs. Packers: The resurgent Bears, led by a devastating
defensivefront four, has played their
way back into contention in the
evenly-matched NFC Central Division. This week, they face the 7-3
Green Bay Packers. In this matchup of Packers' offense vs. Bears'
defense, give the nod to GreenBay.
In order for the Bears to win, the

weather at Soldier Field must play a
role (i.e. snow, sub-freezing temperatures). Of course, that is within
the realm of possibility, but I'll go
with the Pack by four points. Winner: PACKERS.
Oilers vs. Atlanta: After starting the season with a 1-4 record,
Houston has won six in a row. QB
Warren Moon has returned to his
Pro Bowl form and Buddy Ryan's
defensive schemes have finally
come around. Atlanta, to their credit,
have netted a few wins over the last
threeweeksbut a team only gets one
miracle victory(vs.Dallas) per year.
Atlanta's defense isn't good enough
to shoot theMoon. The Oilers should
blow 'em out big time in the Astrodome. Winner: OILERS.
Dolphins vs. Giants: Dolphin
coach Don Shula has had quite a
season thus far. First, he loses star
QB Dan "Don't call me Andrew"
Marino to an Achilles tear. Then, he
loses backup QB Scott Mitchell.
Enter Steve Deßerg, 39-year-old
journeyman. Deßerg is 2-0 as a
Miami starter, and Shulahasproven

that almost any QB (even David
Woodley) can win using Miami's
offensive scheme. The Giants are
living on borrowed time. How can
they win scoring ten points a game?
I don't know and Giants coach Dan
Reeves probably doesn't either.
However, against theNFL's quality
teams, the Giants' weaknesses will
be exploited. Winner: GIANTS.
Other games:

Winner: BILLS.

Early-season NBA offers surprises Chalk up another one

Wilkens has instilled a stronger emphasis on defense that has helped
spur the team on. The Hawks have
alsobenefitedfrom an excellent mix
ofyouth and experience. The experience comes in the form of superstar Dominique Wilkins and power
forward Kevin Willis. The youth
comes in the form of playmaking
guardMookie Blaylock and the sterling defense of former UNLV star
Stacey Augrrton.
There have also been teams
that have disappointed early in the
season. The Cleveland Cavaliers,

with the spectre of Jordan gone,
have only managed a .500 mark.
Given the success of former Cavalier head man Wilkens in Atlanta,
look for Coach Mike Fratello to be
in hot water if the situation persists.

The earlyNB A season hasbeen
replete with surprises. It has seen
the emergence of new powers in
both conferences.
The most amazing of these is
the currently undefeated Houston
Rockets. Led by All-WorldHakeem
Olajuwon, the Rockets have moved
out to a 14-0 start and are a victory
away from tying the NBA record
for victories at the start of a season.
Olajuwon has been assisted with

B-ball has mixed opening
Men win first three, then lose next three
By David Lischer
The young and relatively inexperienced Swat men's basketball
team started its season with three
straight wins, and showed all the
heart and determination of a seasoned squad. Swat won the Equinox
Classic with two dramatic comefrom-behind victories against Trinity College (74-72) and Bates College (69-68). Trailing by 11 points at
the half against both teams, Swat
utilized itsquickness, depth, and sheer
hustle to pull out the victories.
The positive emotion from the
two close wins propelled Swat to its
domination of Centennial Conference rival Western Maryland. Although the final score was a relatively close 82-75, Swat truly owned
thegame. They out-reboundedMaryland 50-34, including 16 offensive
rebounds, as many as their opponent
got on its defensive boards. In addition, Swat shot an impressive 57%
from the three-point line compared
to a dismal 7% for Maryland.
Rebounding, however, was one
of themainculprits in the three losses
that followed Swat's early success.
In the ChuckResler InvitationalTournament at the University of Rochester over Thanksgiving weekend, Swat
fell to Rochester 80-75 and Oberlin
88-71, being out-rebounded in each
game.
SwatfoughtRochester, winners
of the Division 111National Championship, hard the entire game. "It's
one of those games that could have
gone either way... we happened to
have some calls go the [other] way,"
said co-captain Brett Fenster '94.
Swat's leading scorers were Jeff
Greeson '97 with 13points and Kirk
Daulerio '95 with 12.
Pl owing
an 11-point halftime
lead against Oberlin in the consolation game, Swat lost composure and
showed some of its inexperience.
Outscored by 28 in the second half,
Swat also committed 11 more turnovers than Oberlin. "[Oberlin] is a
very emotional team and we allowed
them to gain some momentum,"said
Greeson. One brightpoint was Craig

Rodner '96, who lead Swat with 14
points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, 2 steals,
and most importantly no turnovers.
Daulerioadded 10points and a gamehigh 13 rebounds.
The sour streak appears to be
turning around as Swatplayed a solid
game in losing to a strong Dickinson
team 93-72. "I was not unhappy with
our play... we did a good job executing our game plan," said Coach Lee
Wimberly. Swat was out-rebounded,
butDickinson was a larger and more
physical team. "We didn't box out a
lot, and they crashed the boards a lot
harder than we did," said Daulerio.
"Dickinson is the type of team
we're aspiring to be... they pressure
theballvery well," saidRodner. Swat
also did a good job of this holding
Dickinson's two quick guards and
leading scorers to under 10 points
each. Attributing this success to
Coach Wimberly, Rodner said "he
[Coach Wimberly] is the best scouter
around... we knew what Dickinson
was going to do."
Daulerio led Swat's attack with
20 points and 6 rebounds, followed
by Rodner with 11 points, Jay Rose
'95 with 8, and Jim Foley '95 with 7.
Foley had to leave the game with an
injury to his lefteye and will sit out at
least three weeks. As one of Swat's
few experienced players, his presence and scoring ability will be sorely
missed.
For a team that had no apparent
stars coming into the season, Swat
has utilized its depth to a great extent
and has seen differentplayers step up
each game. "Generally speaking,
I've been very happy with Kirk
Daulerio... [he's been] playing consistently very we 11... and CraigRodner
hasbeen apleasant surprise this year,"
said Coach Wimberly. "I'm not unhappy with anybody."
"I think the leadership has really
been there from Corey [Mulloy '94]
and Brett [Fenster '94]... [the team]
has tokeep focused and not get down
about these couple losses," saidRose.
Swat's next chance is against Philadelphia Pharmacy Monday at 8:00,
and then a crucial conference game
at Haverford Wednesday.
