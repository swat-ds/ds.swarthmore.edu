Grace also points out that a major
problem for the bookstore is that many
faculty members do not provide information about required books for their
classes until the winter or summer
break, making it difficult for the bookstore to find used copies to sell the next
year.

"If we know the faculty will use a

At the same time, she understands
that it may be hard for faculty members
who may be unable to decide on books
until later for reasons such as the development of a new curriculum.
Biology professor Scott Gilbert said
that many new textbooks are sent by
publishers late in the semester, preventing the professors from choosing new
books until later. Gilbert has written
three textbooks himself.
"The reason why textbooks are so
expensive is because after the first
semester, the used book market kicks in
and the publisher, the artist and the
writer get nothing," Gilbert said. "A lot
of book publishers also need to put out
PowerPoints of all the illustrations of

ask for more than just the book."
Director of Financial Aid Laura
Talbot also emphasized the fact that in
considering financial aid, all students
were given an allowance of $14.50 for
books and expenses. Last year alone the
college spent $870,000 in textbook
allowances for students.
Symonds and Bell, along with a Class

Many environmental activists, from
Earthlust members to Al Gore,
approach issues ofclimate change from
an intellectual perspective. They cite
figures and charts to advocate recycling, use public transportation, buy
hybrid vehicles and make other
changes that will create a more sustainable society. The Awakening the

approach.

"It's inspiring. It's fun. It gives people common ground for having a conversation," she said.
Jones hopes that the symposium will
be all these things. "It sounds inspirational and great and a mid-semester

she looks forward to taking a step back
from trying to achieve specific tasks,
such as hosting 350 Week, in order to
see the movement as a whole.
Hollister Knowlton, one offive facilitators who will lead Saturday's symposium, got involved with the program
after she retired. "I left my paid work
because I wanted to do more work as a
Quaker," she said. Before retirement,
she worked in science education and
advocacy, spending several years teaching science in middle and high school,
and later joined the Pennsylvania
Environmental Council.
Just after retiring, Knowlton began
working with the Quaker Earthcare
Witness group. "I got an invitation to a
symposium that said, 'Are you interested in bringing forth an environmentally

cuts, more to come

The council added that historically,
financial aid has always been the easiest
thing to raise funds for among alumni and
that the administration remains committed to need-blind admissions. "We need all
of you to brainstorm so that the Financial
Aid department isn't the only one making

these decisions," Bell said.

Dermot Delude-Dix 'lO expressed his dissatisfaction with the planning group's recommended cuts to financial aid. He said
that recommendations for cuts in financial
aid put more of a burden on students

receiving financial aid. "The ad-hoc committee already declared that the budget for
the honors programs is too important to
cut, why not say the same for financial aid?
Students need to stand up to the Board of
Managers and tell them that we find this
part of the proposal simply unacceptable,"

FUOCO

jsmall2, dfuocol@swarthmore:edu
In an effort to address the current challenges the college faces from last year's eco-

nomic downturn, the Ad Hoc Financial
Planning Group on Friday released its recommendations for $6.85 million in budget
cuts for the 2010-2011 academic year.
The Ad Hoc Financial Planning Group's
recommended budget cuts for next academic year are more substantial than changes
already made for this year. The college
claims that the changes already in effect
such as freezes on staff and faculty salaries,

use of emergency reserves and a temporary

suspension of building and maintenance
projects
aren't sustainable endeavors for
the college to continue in the future.
While the planning group's recommended budget cuts are substantial, members of

the Student Financial Advisory Panel and
Student Council said at a presentation to
students last Saturday that the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group aimed to make
these across all areas of campus
"shared
sacrifice," as they called it.
The college will cut $2.5 million from
facilities and capital projects, push for
more fundraising from alumni and reduce
the athletic, academic and administrative
budgets. If approved by the Board of
Managers, these cuts will go into effect in
the 2010-2011 academic year.
"[Vice President for Finance and
Treasurer] Sue Welsh and Financial Aid
are doing a good job, so we're doing well
compared to peer institutions like Harvard,
Williams and Yale," SFAP member Nick
Malinak 'lO said at Saturday's presentation. "Still, the level of spending must
change. No one expects a full and complete
recovery."
These recommendations, however, only
account for roughly $6.85 million of the
expected $8 million in cuts. According to
the release from the college, the remaining
$ll5 million will be addressed in the
upcoming academic year and put into place
for the 2011-2012 school year. Overall, the
college's goal is to make cuts that will be
sustainable over the long term while still
retaining the core values of Swarthmore.
SFAP's presentation on Saturday
called "What's Going On?"
was more

informational than discussion-based. Most
students listened to SFAP and StuCo members explain the planning group's recommendations and asked only a few ques-

tions. StuCo President Rachel Bell 'lO estimated that there were about 30 or 40 people
in attendance.
"It was great to see that so many
Swatties took time to participate in this
important dialogue," StuCo Vice President
Nate Erskine 'lO said. "I thought that the
SFAP members did a fantastic job of providing their peers with a lot of detail."
Sunday's StuCo meeting showed more
...

student involvement, with many of the
attendants asking questions and volunteering for task forces to "start to meet or talk
with the relevant people," Bell said in an e-

mail. A few people, for example, volunteered for a financial aid task force.
The Board of Managers will be review-

ing and discussing the planning group's
recommendations on Friday, Dec. 4 and
Saturday, Dec. 5. In February, the Board
will deliberate about whether to adopt the
measures for the 2010-2011 school year. The
Friday meeting, which will be fully devoted
to discussions on the budget, will be closed.
On Saturday, however, there will be two
student observers at the meeting and an
open student luncheon.
At Sunday's meeting, StuCo members
and other attendants expressed a concern
that Friday's closed meeting would not

allow for enough student input.
Bell said in an e-mail that StuCo members are hoping to change that. "We are
working on getting a student observer, or
at least being able to make a presentation,
in addition to submitting a formal statement expressing opinions of students
which board members will receive with the
rest of their preparation materials," she
said.
There was significant concern from students and StuCo members at last Sunday's
meeting about the 21 percent reduction to
financial aid. The options ofhow to reduce
spending on financial aid are still under
discussion. Some expressed a concern that
the department may need to return to giving loans, instead of the current no-loan
policy.

StuCo members discussed three options
that could be taken. They include increasing the expected hourly work study from 7.5
hours to 10 hours, increasing expected summer earnings and reinstating loans. Bell
said, however, that if loans were to be reinstated, they would be brought back at a
much smaller scale than the ones from
before the college went loan-free. She noted
that the eventual decisions could be a combination of these three options.

he said in an e-mail.
Faculty and staff benefits will be
reduced, which many students found
deeply troubling. "I was particularly concerned that the school was going to cut
funding from the benefit bank for employees, and I'm glad that they're not planning
on doing this," Maddy Reichman 'l3 said.
"I'm still not satisfied, though, about the
reductions in benefits for employees." The
administration is trying to find alternate
healthcare plans for faculty and staff.
The academic budget will have a 4.6 percent reduction. There will be no firings, but
when professors retire, they may not be
replaced. Department expansions will also
be postponed and salaries will increase at a
lower rate, while remaining competitive.
The budget for the Honors program will not
be reduced, though departments will be
encouraged to bring in local examiners to

reduce the cost of travel and housing.
There may be a reduction of wages for stu-

dent jobs, like tutoring.
The library budget will be reduced by
3.5 percent with fewer subscriptions to
periodicals. As of now, there will be no
printing limits for students, but that option

may be discussed in the future.
Athletics will face a 31 percent reduction in budget. Teams will take fewer
overnight trips and there will be fewer subsidies for meals and banquets. Across the
entire Centennial Conference, the preseason has been shortened to reduce costs to

member colleges.

Information and Technological Services

will not encounter new cuts in addition to
the ones they had last year, but there will
be fewer computers in dorms.
Worth Health Center will not deny medical care because of a student's financial
difficulties, but Bell said that "we need students to use insurance when they do have
it," Bell said.She added, "We're not at the
point where we need to change any of our

core values."
Erskine expressed hope that "we can
maintain an environment where students
see the administration as a partner in
working out the budget adjustments." He

commended several people, including
Welsh, Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid Jim Bock '9O, Acting Dean of Students
Garikai Campbell '9O, Registrar Martin
Warner and Assistant Vice President and
Controller Eileen Petula for expending a lot
of effort to ensure a good channel between
students and the administration.
"They really deserve the appreciation
and the thanks of the student body," he
said.

STUCO HIGHLIGHTS ■■

Seminar break funding under review
Seminars lasting three hours or more
traditionally have a break halfway
through class. Students are often asked
to provide snacks for these breaks. Some

have voiced their concerns about funding these refreshments out of pocket. The
issue of reimbursing students for food
was brought up last spring by the Daily
Gazette. As a result, StuCo has decided to
take care of the problem. They are currently conducting research concerning
the situation and possible solutions.
"We're going to go department to
department to learn if official policies
exist, if it varies by professor, and the
ways in which it varies," StuCo president Rachel Bell 10 said in an e-mail.
Media shuttle
After deliberating whether or not to
have a weekly shuttle to Media, the council decided that it would launch a pilot
program for the next two Fridays the college is in session. The shuttle would run
from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. "Two weeks may
sound arbitrary and short, but it was
just for the rest of the semester. If people
seem to use it, we will request to extend
it for the whole spring semester," Bell
said.
Bike update
StuCo will be launching another trial
program
the bike share. They will
purchase 10 bikes for students to use
whenever they need to get somewhere in
a timely manner. They will be located in
certain designated places on campus.
Last week StuCo discussed how the
bike's lock system would Work. They are

November 19, 2009

cooperating with the library to implement a check-in/check-out system where
thestudent ID will be used to cheek out a
pad-lock, chain and helmet. The Student
Budget Committee had postponed the
proposal due to a few issues. One problem concerns question of liability.
Questions included: What would happen
if the bike was damaged or stolen? Will
the student be responsible for damage,
but not theft?
"If the student was irresponsible or

sold the bike, that student should be held
liable," said Angela Meng 'l2, Student
Events Advisor. They plan on making
the fine the equivalent price of the bike.
The problem is determining whether
students in such a situation are telling
the truth. Another issue arose when
Chester Neighborhood Bikes, the organization that StuCo is purchasing six bikes
from, became a chartered group.
"It is indeed bizarre for SBC to pay for
a chartered group's services because
essentially it's almost like students are
paying for themselves," Meng said.
A second proposal will be presented
to SBC on Sunday.
Tri-Co cooperation
The first step to ensuring

better Tri-

College cooperation, one of StuCo's
goals, is eliminating problems with the
van schedule. Esther Burson 'lO,
Educational Policy Representative, will
be talking with Provost Constance
Hungerford about ameliorating van

Cram Woods deer cull approved for winter break
BY MINH-DUYEN NGUYEN
mnguyen4@swarthmore.edu

After several postponements,

the

Pennsylvania Game Commission has
given Swarthmore College permission to
proceed with its deer cull in Crum Woods.
As a safety precaution, the College plans
for the deer cull to take place during winter break when few students will be on
campus.

To guarantee the safety of Swarthmore
students and the surrounding community
that uses the woods, the College has taken
several provisions. First, the cull will be
conducted by licensed sharpshooters
working with the Pennsylvania Game
Commission in areas pre-approved by the
college. There wilf be "No Hunting/No
Trespassing" signs posted to delineate
areas where the cull will take place.
Finally, the cull will be conducted in areas
of the Crum Woods less used by the general public.
In concurrence with changes to the
PGC regulations that specify that all private landowners and municipalities must
allow hunting to occur with any cull, the
College will be designing a controlled

hunt. According to Maurice Eldridge '6l,
College
Vice President for
and

Five students guilty of underage drinking HC female
BY ROBIN RISKIN
BICONEWS.COM, NOV. 5, 2009
Twenty-nine students with citations
for„ underage drinking from Lloyd
Around the World huddled by the

doors of the Havertown District Court

Wednesday morning, October 28.
Five Fords fought the case. They
were all found guilty.

The conviction will stay on their
records, though they can get it
expunged when they are 2L In the
meantime, they are planning on
appealing, which must occur by
November 27.
After the hearing, twenty-four students signed up for the diversion program. This clears their record once
they complete 32 hours of community
service, 12 hours ofalcohol classes, and
pay $290 in fines and fees. They also
have the option to fulfill eight of their
hours by spending $55 on canned goods
for a food pantry for the hungry.
Two of the 31 given citations (27
Haverford, four Bryn Mawr) were not
present, one Ford because of swine flu,
one Mawrtyr because the police had
written down the wrong address.
These two have a hearing scheduled
for November 16. Both plan on fighting
the case.
Of the 29, several students—all of
whom wished to remain anonymous to
avoid a record of their citation—still
had not made final decisions as of that

Wednesday morning.
A male sophomore thought he
would fight the case, but he changed
his mind after the hearing and signed
up for the diversion program. He said
later, "Just being in the court made me
realize how difficult it would be to
fight. It's basically going to be my word
versus a policeman's words, and I don't
think I'm going to win that fight."
One junior thought that she would
plead guilty and have the citation
expunged when she turned 21 in one
month.
After the judge explained that there
is a two to three year waitlist for pardons for those who pled guilty, she
opted for the diversion program. She
said it wasn't worth the risk of having
the citation on her record, since she
might want to be a teacher.
One freshman is waiting to hear her
outcome, since she received a second
citation about a month later. Normally,
the diversion program is a first-time
offense option, but she said that since
her two citations were so close together, they "might not weigh as much."
She has another hearing November 16.
Initially, Lacianca had said the trials of those who chose to fight the
charges would occur at a later date, but
she decided to hold them that same day
as everyone was there.
Attorney Anna Durbin, who came to
Haverford's forum after the Lloyd incident, represented the students. Their
trials were held individually, but they
are thinking of appealing as a group.
Durbin said that the two not present
will likely have their cases combined
with the others'.
Dean of Student Life Steve Watter
stayed for the hearing and some of the
trials "to provide moral support and to
observe the proceedings," he said in an
email.

THE PHOENIX

After the first two trials, Lacianca
and Walter Omlor, Delaware County's
Director of Community Service, made
one last offer for the rest to do the
diversion program. One junior and one
freshman accepted, leaving five to contest the charges.
The freshman and junior were guaranteed inside work, which is generally
administrative and preferable to outside manual labor. Omlor said that the
offer was an executive decision made
when it was almost 2 p.m. and no one
had had lunch.
The students waiting for their trials
were sequestered in the hall and were
not allowed to know the previous trials' outcomes. However, one who took
the offer said it was "pretty obvious"
from their expressions when the first
two students walked out that they had
been found guilty. She might have
stayed to fight if she thought her outcome would be better, but she said, "I
just wanted it to be over."
Unless they win the appeal, the five
found guilty have their driving licenses suspended for
90 days and must

police had read him his rights, he probably would have taken the community
service option. But he felt like his
rights had been violated, and he wanted to fight for justice.

As for the trials themselves, there
were variations in individual circumstances, but for all, Durbin had two
main arguments.
One, that the students should not
have been detained, since the officers
did not have reasonable suspicion
these individuals were drinking.
Two, that the evidence should be
suppressed, since the students had not
been read their Miranda Rights—which state that they have the right to
remain silent, that anything they say
can and will be used against them, and
that they have the right to an attorney.
A Pennsylvania Supreme Court case
has set the precedent for dismissing
evidence from interrogations if students have not been informed of these
rights.

For most of the students, the officers
who wrote up their citations were

assaulted
BY ROBIN RISKIN
BICONEWS.COM, NOV. 9, 2009
A female student was sexually
assaulted in the Integrated Natural
Sciences Center sometime Sunday
between midnight and 8 a.m.
The assailant was described as a college-age white male around 6 feet tall.
He has an athletic build with short,
possibly brown hair, and was wearing
a plain shirt, green hat and possibly
green shorts.
It is unknown whether or not the
assailant was a Haverford student. The
main events on campus Saturday night
were the La Fiesta dance at Founders
Great Hall, the FUCS show in Lunt
Basement, and Club Neon in Gummere
Basement, where there were no
Quaker Bouncers checking Tri-Co IDs.
It is unknown whether the assailant
attended any of these parties.
Tom King, director of Safety and
Security, sent out an e-mail notifying
the student body about the assault
around 7 p.m. Monday. He reported
that the student has been treated at a
nearby hospital and that the college is
working closely with local law enforcement on the investigation.
In a later email on Wednesday afternoon, King requested that if anyone
attending the party in Gummere basement between 11:30 p.m. on Saturday at
1:15 a.m. on Sunday has information,
they should contact him or Nora Nelle
at Safety & Security. He said that photographs could be "particularly helpful."
Haverford Township Police Officer
John Hawke and a Haverford College
Safety and Security Officer were posted
outside the Chemistry Lounge in the
INSC for several hours on Monday
starting around 3:30 p.m., preventing
anyone from entering.
They were not allowed to release
any information as to why they were
there; it is unknown whether their
presence was related to the assault this
weekend. The room looked empty from
outside with the exception of the
couches and tables normally present
and a roll of caution tape lying on a
table.
Martha Denney, Dean of the College,
sent out an e-mail slightly after 9 p.m.
Monday saying that there is no reason
to believe there is an ongoing threat to
the safety of anyone on campus, but
that the school is taking the incident
"very seriously" and "cooperating fully
with the law enforcement officials."
Students' Council Co-Presidents
Will Harrison 'lO and Harrison Haas 'lO
sent out an email slightly after 10 p.m.
Monday saying that over the next few
days, the Women's Center, Students'
Council, and Survivors of Assault and
Rape will be meeting with the administration and Safety and Security.
Tom King advised all students to
travel in groups or ask for an escort
when traveling alone, and reminded
students that counseling services are
always available. He said that anyone
with information that could aid in the
investigation should contact the
Haverford Police Department or Safety
and Security.

to attracting the male population with my
bodacious dance moves. The problem is
that I tend to attract far too wide a range of
male suitors, and often end up getting
attacked from behind by perfect strangers,

Guys, if there is one piece of advice I can
offer you now, it's to man up and approach
a woman face first. No female (without a
vomit-inducing blood alcohol level) wants
her first interaction with a boy to start

touch of something pointy and hard; she'd
rather identify you so she can decide
whether or not she wants to reject you.
In order to perfect the pre-hookup ritual, one must be confident and willing to
risk rejection.
In my case, I have not come so far as to
be comfortable going to Paces alone.

my back found
its way to the floor, my spine making direct
contact with the beer-stained tiles.
Somehow, I had managed to get all the way
down there for a sort of back-bend with my

pelvis as the hinge.
While getting up from this position
caused me a series of hamstring spasms,
the physical pain was well worth the
cathartic experience. In fact, once the
endorphins kicked in, a second wind propelled me up and down the three wooden
steps for the duration of "I'm Gonna Be (500
miles)." For the entire song, I did nothing

but march up the stairs, and then down the
stairs, and then up and down again. Of
course I threw in little hip thrusts and
some creative gesticulation, but the point
is, anyone observing me would probably
have been asking himself, "What in the hell
is she doing?"
But honestly, who cares? I was blowing
off steam and having a damn good time
doing it. Paces, despite any of the criticism
brought about by its detractors, ("Wahh,
it's sketchy. Ohh, it's lame.") is a great
place to forget about your problems and get
loose. You remember that couple jammed
in the corner inhaling each other's faces for
a solid two-thirds of the night? Mock them
you might, but they were enjoying themselves. And what the hell, weren't you
enjoying yourself by viewing? Okay, maybe
you were repulsed, but the situation is pretty laughable. I expect to see that tall, goofy
white kid grinding on that little Asian girl,
their butts jerking back and forth at about
three times the speed of the beat. And what
do I say to that? Yeahhh man!

Colored coats, too, seem to be really
in this year. From scarlet to mustard
yellow to emerald green, pea coats and
down jackets alike are appearing with
splashes of color.
Vivienne Westwood makes a red
wool coat that is absolutely to die for
with a $y.45 price tag that may actually
make your heart stop. Marc Jacobs, for
$660, has a gorgeous purple-and-green
checked coat that would update any

Spiffy up your dorm room with minimum stress
er when revamping your current space
most have been handpicked from a number of interior design blogs and websites,
although I've included some of my own
suggestions as well.
L SEEK SMALL SPACE STORAGE
• Space is an uncommon luxury in college dorms. When it comes to organizing,
IKEA and Target are your best options,
acclaimed by designers and students alike
for their affordable storage solutions.
• Bed risers are essential in providing
additional storage space, and some dorms
on campus have beds that can be raised on
their own. Invest in a queen-size comforter
or quilt, which drapes nicely over the side
of the bed, hiding away unsightly storage

bins and boxes.
Instead of your run-of-the-mill plastic
bins, use a vintage suitcase (or hatboxes)
to store papers and folders
2. SCAVENGE FOR SECOND-HAND
• Nothing says dorm quite like a futon.
Try scouring estate sales and second-hand
antique shops or vendors for quirky, easily
updatable furniture in a wide range of
styles, sizes and prices. (If you choose to
opt for a futon, try covering it with a nice
sheet or blanket and some throw pillows)
• Quirky trinkets (a souvenir from a
trip, knickknacks from home, or just a random thrift store purchase) add visual
interest and also serve as conversation
•

buried in the depths of McCabe. This stu-

This student might benefit from a room
with muted lighting and a comfy bed, a
space for restorative relaxation.
Optimum dorm room design can be as
intricate or as effortless as you want it to
be, as long as you create a place you can
call home. Here are tips you might consid-

pieces.

• Be practical. Size matters in dorms,
and spaces can easily feel claustrophobic
not cozy
with too much furniture or
with too much going on overall.

• Even the most austere dorm room can
suddenly become stylish and appealing
when certain textiles are paired well
together. There are some rules when it
comes to mixing patterns; odd numbers,
for instance, typically seem to work best

especially groups of three when choosing
patterns and colors.
• Large-scale printed fabric allows for
more freedom when it comes to mixing
and matching patterns and colors. Mix and

match medium-sized prints with a smaller

selection of different colors, and small
prints with only a couple different colors,
or simply mix different patterns in the

same color. For a simple, contemporary
look, mix two basic solids (colors, black or
white) and add in a pillow or two in a printedfabric dyed in one of these colors.

4. ATTRACTIVE ACCENTS
• Placing a soft rug next to your bed will
help make waking up in the morning a little less daunting (especially in winter or in
rooms without carpeting)
• Fear not, roommates suffering from

• Decorative lighting, artwork, and photographs of family and friends add warmth
to any room and conjure happy memories.

the day. Though it is an extension of individuality, a dorm room should always fulproviding a

new ways of making my closet fun

Name: Ann Chen
Class Year: 2013
From: Austin, TX

Current Residence: Mertz
What she's wearing:
"I'm wearing a jacket that was my mother's. I guess
it's from the 'Bos, so vintage I guess the 'Bos [are] vin-

tage now," Chen said. Her shirt is from Macy's and her
shoes are Antonio Melani. "The skirt I got from a friend;
I think it's from Express," Chen said. "[This is] a necklace that I bought at a garage sale."
Chen sticks to a mostly monochromatic, blue palette
for this look, but she also throws in burgundy heels and
a chunky, gold necklace for variety. The bold stripes of
the skirt make for an eye-catching pattern, especially
with the light blue and black combination. It is her
cobalt jacket that is the standout piece in her outfit:
With the strong shoulders and boxy shape, the jacket is
very reminiscent of the 'Bos power suit that you can find
in thrift shops everywhere, but also in Balmain's and
Stella McCartney's Spring 2009 collections. Chen's jacket is not like the jewel-encrusted kind seen at Balmain,
but it is a call back to the 'Bos.

How she describes her style:
"Colorful, maybe quirky," Chen said. "Most of what I
wear is some sort of form of or diluted version of what I
fantasize about."
Fashion influences and inspirations:
Chen is in the Swarthmore Cine-club, where students
watch two movies on Friday afternoons. "Recently,
we've been doing Italian cinema, like neo-realism and
Italian movies from the '6os," she said. In the last two
movies, "L'avventura" and "I soliti ignoti," Chen has
"been really struck by the way that the people dress,
[both] the women and the men."
"Just things that I see, they stick in the back of my
mind," Chen said about her influences. "It can be from
the fashion blogs that I visit or the movies that I see."

and exciting," Chen said.
Fashion blogs she follows:
Chen reads The Sartorialist, and
enjoys browsing the pages of blogs
like Stockholm Street Style, Sea of
Shoes and The Glamourai. Chen also
sometimes visits Fashion Toast.
Chen also frequently finds inspiration in Japanese fashion. Her favorite
blog is Drop-Fashion Street Snap. "It's
my dose of crazy, unadulterated
Japanese street style," Chen said.
Favorite places to shop:
Chen is an avid thrift store shopper in
Austin. "For the most part I get a lot of my
clothes secondhand or I get them from
friends," she said, adding that a lot of her
clothes come from her mother. While many
people find thrift store shopping stressful,
Chen has a lot of fun every time. "It can be
tiring, especially if you're in a really badly
edited thrift store," she said. "But those are
the kinds that I like the best because they're
the cheapest and it's like a treasure hunt."
Chen loves how she can sift through piles of
smelly clothes and find a standout piece.

If she could raid anyone's closet, whose
would it be?
"Probably Jane Aldridge [the blogger] from
Sea of Shoes," Chen said. Aldridge is a seventeen
bm
year old from Dallas, Texas with a former model
for a mother. "It's ridiculous how many shoes she has
and the quality of her clothing," Chen said. "I think it'd
be really awesome to spend a day in her shoes, literally."

ART IN MINIATURE

BY AMBER WANTMAN
awantmal@swarthmore.edu

Since 2005, the Village Education
Project, or VEP, has supported youth
from three rural villages outside of
Otavalo, Ecuador in their pursuit of a
high school degree. Each summer,
Swarthmore College students as well
as volunteers spanning the U.S. travel
to Otavalo in order to teach a rigorous
summer Math and English program.
"Any child who receives a 16 out of 20,
which is considered a passing grade,
will be awarded a scholarship by VEP,"
said Jake Ban 'lO, the current Director
of Operations for VEP. "As long as the

A recent exhibit at Kitao Gallery emphasized small pieces of art. Students were

invited to submit artwork with dimensions of 4X4X4 or smaller for the exhibit,
called Miniatures, either on their own time or through a study break Kitao hosted
last Thursday. "We thought that would be easy and fun. It was more about quantity than quality, the presentation [of the pieces]," GenevieveWoodhead 'l2, a member ofKitao Gallery, said. Student pieces were displayed throughout the gallery, in

until the child has graduated high

school costs nearly $2OO per year, an
impossible rate for most rural families,
the project pays the full costs of secondary education in the villages where
it works.

The other component to VEP exists
at Swarthmore, where students volunteer year-round, taking on the task of
fundraising, curriculum development,

Over
20 vendors
Swarthmore—such as Trader Joe's,
Starbucks, 320 Market and Panera
Bread—will provide the food and
drink. Attendees will pay $5 for a trip
down the buffet line, which also
includes one raffle ticket for students'
choice of 100 meal points, an $BO Target
Gift Certificate, or a 1-hour hot stone
massage.

"We're really indebted to all of our
contributors,"
said Ban. Linda
McDougal, who works as executive
director of Dining Services, helped the
Village Education Project secure a
donation of 60 muffins from Sweet
Potato Cafe, as well as 72 freshly-baked
bagels.
Barbara Magee, a massage
therapist who serves clients at Worth
Health Center, kindly agreed to donate
a 60-minute deluxe therapy session.
The Village Education invites
everyone to enter their raffles, to support global access to school, and most
importantly, to "EAT" for education.

BY BEN FRANCIS
bfrancl@swarthmore.edu
Last summer, I had the opportunity to work with a group of 15 men,
inmates at the McEver Probation Detention Center in Perry, Georgia.
Once a week, I made the drive south to discuss current
events for an hour and play chess for another hour. It
was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I
am asking you to consider dedicating a part of this
upcoming summer to the inmates of our society.
When I started my own program, I hoped to challenge the participants to think critically through the game of chess, while at the same
time ask them to think in new ways about effective democratic participation, through our discussions of current events. I did not expect to find
a tournament chess player at McEver. I did not expect to find a man who
hoped to run for mayor ofhis town upon his release. I certainly did not
expect to find 15 men who challenged me as much as I challenged them.
The first two times that I visited McEver, I was “Mr. Francis.” After
that, I was “Chess Master.”
Consider spending one day a week of part of your summer on a program of your own designing. I ask for English majors and physics
majors, music majors and economics majors, history majors and biology majors. A program centered on any subject is valuable. Wherever
you are this summer, there will be a prison where you can make a positive impact.
I believe that the men and women in our prison system can contribute positively to society and that we can encourage them to realize
this capacity by challenging their minds. At the same time, I believe
that we become richer as individuals for knowing their views and thenperspectives. I am starting a nonprofit organization, called Freeing
Minds, that will facilitate the process of implementing your program at
a local prison and cover transport and other costs. Please, contact me
with proposals for your own program or for more information. On my
final day at McEver last summer, one of the men approached me and
said, “You’re a blessing.” At the time, I was too taken aback to respond
with anything intelligent. I should have told him that he was the blessing: for listening, for challenging me and for becoming someone who I
now call my friend. I hope you will consider this opportunity to both
touch the lives of many and become richer as an individual.

Soren Larson’s most recent column fails to effectively answer the question of whether reducing income inequality will make society better off.
As students of economics, we want to address some inaccuracies and omissions in Larson’s discussion and to present
a case for increasing equality through progressive economic policy. Standard economic theory and extensive empirical evidence show a clear relationship between lowering inequality and
increasing social well-being.
Inequality encompasses both relative inequality, a comparison of the
incomes of the poor to the rich, and absolute deprivation, a comparison of
the lowest incomes to the cost of a minimal standard of living. Larson’s
assertion that relative inequality renders absolute deprivation irrelevant
is an oversimplification; absolute deprivation and relative inequality cannot be decoupled. We care about the differences between the poorest and
wealthiest, in terms of quality of life, because they are wide in absolute
terms. Put differently, since there is declining marginal utility of income
and wealth, aggregate utility could be increased greatly by transferring
wealth from the richest to the poorest. So, reducing the equality gap in a
society where absolute deprivation is high would improve the welfare of
the most deprived without endangering the fortunes of the wealthy.
From here, we show that pursuing income equality improves societal well-being. Larson ignores the fact that policies aimed at reducing
inequality likewise reduce poverty. Certainly, the concrete disadvantages
of poverty include poorer access to health care, fewer opportunities for
social mobility, worse educational opportunities and higher chances of
incarceration. Larson takes the finding that poorer Americans are less
“concerned” about inequality than their European counterparts to mean
that poor Americans will not benefit from a reduction in inequality (i.e.
more income). This is not true.
And what of the wealthy? High relative inequality has a well-documented effect of increasing crime rates, a tangible negative consequence
of inequality (Choe, 2008). Also, assuming the wealthy care about ethical
responsibilities, reducing inequality is likely to feed into the positive side
of their personal utility functions. Most Americans approve of reducing
income inequality and realize its concomitant benefits. Most economists
do too. Smaller gaps in income inequality enhance cohesion, solidarity,
public goods provision, social support and social capital (Deaton, 2003).
Thus, we view decreasing inequality as unequivocally good.
One can argue that income inequality in America is offset by
increased opportunities for social mobility. But, according to Pew
Charitable Trust’s Economic Mobility Project (EMP) mobility has stagnated over the past generation as income inequality has risen.
Furthermore, opportunities for economic mobility have accrued disproportionately to certain groups. The EMP indicates that African
Americans and women were much less likely to enjoy social mobility than
white Americans and men. For example, 69 percent of African American
children born to middle-income parents did not make more than their parents’ income, while 68 percent of white children born to middle-income
parents did earn more than their parents’ income. Once we recognize that
some Americans do not enjoy as many opportunities for social advancement, social policies that seek to lower income inequality are particular-

OP-ED

ly valuable.

We also feel compelled to address Larson’s argument on “progressive
social policy” and wealth inequality. Here, Larson attempts to place readers in a doublebind by creating a false dichotomy: If you value increasing
equality of earnings then you cannot support many progressive social
policies. To this, we have several responses.
First, Larson misrepresents the relevant economic literature, selectively choosing work in order to prove his point. To be fair, measuring the
effects of immigration has generated a lot of controversy. But generally,
economists have concluded that immigration has no effect on the wages
and employment levels of initial workers. These new workers often take
jobs not filled by the original workforce, and industries and employers
adapt to take advantage of local economies, viewing labor as one of many
inputs (Card, 2005). Borjas, whom Larson cites, is really the lone wolf in
the field and has been frequently discredited.
Second, Larson fails to break down the data on inequality of incomes
according to gender. It makes intuitive sense that women entering the
workforce and earning higher wages would significantly reduce the earnings gap across individuals. It’s important to remember that the workforce is not monolithic: Workers have varying education levels and different skill sets. New entrants may not (and often do not) perfectly substitute for longer established workers. Put simply, the trade-offs Larson
presents need not occur.
While varying objections to this article have been raised, the misuse
of the economic discipline motivated our response. In underscoring the
benefits of equality, we also hope to dispel the notion that economics
inherently conflicts with socially progressive views.

Capitalism and social ills, inextricably linked

My co-columnist Soren
Larson wrote a thoughtprovoking article last week
about the effects of income
inequality on American
society. First, I want to correct Larson's mistaken
assumption that the "capitalism is colonial" chalkings were done by Class

pose. Second, though he is
an avowedly proud economics major, I must admit
to being among the cohort of ashamed economics majors.
My embarrassment at admitting to studying economics in
social situations, however, is not a result of feeling that
the study ofeconomics is futile or lamentable. Rather, it is
rooted in my increasing awareness that economics is
quite often a self-consciously pompous discipline that
asserts itself as a self-evident Truth-wifh-a-capital-T.
With all due respect to the many economists and
Swarthmore faculty who use economics as a means to
pursue good social ends, it is difficult for me to continue
to adhere blindly to a discipline in which arguments often
begin with such dubious statements as
rational
actors" after an event like the collapse of the global economic system. Even attempts within the discipline to
inject realism into economic models and theories must
operate within a framework that privileges the scientific
discourse and relies on a mathematical abstraction of
human behavior. When the outcomes of these academic
debates affect human lives as acutely as economic decisions do, such abstraction from lived human experience
quite frankly just does not make much sense to me.
I don't seek to address Larson's central argument that
higher levels of income inequality may not make society
worse off, but rather his underlying premise that social
problems are not intrinsically linked to the capitalist
organization of our society. By decrying a "dysfunctional"
educational system and insufficient legal protection of
migrant workers as the "true" reasons for inequality, it is
easy to overlook the fact that the reasons we need egalitarian legal and educational systems in the first place is in
order to mitigate the inequalities inherent in capitalist
society itself.

'

Capitalism inherently gives those with high initial
endowments in property and other resources an advantage in accumulating even more economic profits, while it
leaves those without initial endowments in such
resources at a decided disadvantage. It's not the legal system that made migrant workers vulnerable; it's their status as migrant workers with no substantial property or
assets or fallback plan if they lose their jobs, and thus no
bargaining power, confronted with significantly more
well-endowed companies who know they have enough
bargaining power to bully their employees into providing
more labor at lower cost, in order to bolster company profits.
If I've learned anything from my honors economics
seminars, it's that government interventions in the private sector in attempts to mitigate inequalities and help
marginalized groups become incorporated into the system more often than not fail in their fundamental aims.
Take education, for example: the myth of the American
dream is based on the premise of equal opportunity, provided by universal access to free education. However,
innumerous economic studies have been conducted on
how to improve educational outcomes among 'lat-risk"
populations and the only conclusive evidence is that it all
depends on "family background." No matter how much
money the government pours into low-performing schools
and teachers, or threatens to take away from low-performing schools and teachers in an effort to "incentivize"
better performance, it seems economists are unable to
solve the problem ofhow to turn schools into a vehicle for
social mobility. Children enter school already embedded
in social contexts that too often predetermine their life
outcomes, and the reason for this goes far deeper than any
economic theory can model.
Attributing failure to produce positive change to "family background" is one of way of absolving the system
from guilt. Poverty that results from these social forces
that are beyond the realm of economics is generally seen
in economics as a tolerable, if undesirable, fact.
Minimization of poverty rates may be one of the goals of
economic policy making, but in practice it is often takes a
backseat to such issues as macroeconomic stabilization,
and no economist ever expects poverty rates to be zero.
This implicit legitimization of poverty ignores the very
human costs of living in poverty. Presuming to apply the
same notions of utility, preferences and tastes to people
who must choose between food and a winter coat as are
applied to people who are choosing between buying an
iPod or a designer handbag seems unethical, but maybe
that's just me.

A more fundamental problem with arguments like

Larson's is the assertion that discussing the problems

with capitalism and speculating about alternatives is distracting and futile. We often take the current dominant
paradigm for granted: "Capitalism" is a fact; "democracy"
is a fact. And discussing the inherent problems within
these discourses is superfluous, because they are understood as natural, unchangeable constants. But nothing
could be further from the truth. American democracy and
capitalism have hardly been unchanging constants
throughout history; rather, they are the products of constant fluctuations in the way we understand relationships
between individuals, social groups, technology and

resources.
Even the versions of democracy and capitalism that
currently exist in the United States are drastically modified forms of the initial conceptions of the terms. Various
and conflicting discourses have risen in dominance and
fallen again throughout the course of human history and
across the broad range of simultaneously existing societies at any given moment in time, and I guarantee you
that in any one given society, its members saw the particular discourse which dominated as the natural,
unchangeable order of things. Yet change it did.
What makes us think that the dominant systems currently existing are any different? Thinking about and discussing potential directions for change shouldn't be condescendingly labeled "ruminations from the theoretical
socialist wonderland" (as though economics is such a real
world discipline).
Change is what brought us capitalism, and change is
what will inevitably propel us into a post-capitalist future.
Capitalism's firm grasp over many spheres of life (not
just the economic) often prevents us, as individuals
deeply integrated into the socialfabric of capitalistic society, from being able to objectively view the problems it
generates. Even discussions of inequality and other social
problems are automatically couched in the vocabulary of
rationalism, individualism, equal opportunity and personal entrepreneurial motivation. This creates a situation
in which those who are unable to meet their needs can be
criticized for lacking the personal motivation to take
advantage of the opportunities available to them in a
"free" society.
Attempting to change the language of this debate is
nothing short of challenging the very ideological basis of
our society. Doing so, however, shouldn't be seen as a bad
thing. Capitalism is not natural, but change is.

Rights Movement is problematic
at best. All of the students from
Swarthmore were white, and
the nature of this action is different than sit-ins conducted
during America's period of segregation, where basic rights of

Rights Movement is not a finite
narrative. People of color still
face oppression in this country,
including brutalization by the
law enforcement and prison systems, and unequal access to education and health care.
The way these issues converge in this action highlights
insensitivity to the issue of what
it means for a group of students
to be in jail. What is their
responsibility to those in jail

But perhaps most telling
about Harbaugh's motivation
is his outward feelings about
his players.
He gushes about them.
Harbaugh, a former NFL star
and Heisman contender at
quarterback, said that Owen
Marecic embodies everything
he ever wanted to be as a football player; he called Andrew
Luck the best passer in the
nation and didn't back down
even after national scrutiny;
and he consistently refers to
players of all talent and skill
levels as "mighty men."
It's not just talk. When players are injured on the field,
Harbaugh helps them off.
At the Big Game media
luncheon, he arrived, ate and
left with Toby Gerhart; Cal

coach Jeff Tedford, by contrast,
arrived after his players, did
not eat with them and left
early. Without presuming too
much about Tedford, given that
there were surely other scheduling variables at play, that
encapsulates
Harbaugh's inclination toward
his players.

athletes. Harbaugh simply gets

The academic restrictions
placed on his recruiting are
stricter than at any other BCS

emphasis on blue-collar work
ethic is omnipresent, simply
views it as another challenge
that must be overcome.
Given his success on the
trail thus far, the impediment
hasn't seemed to have stopped
Stanford's development.
In other words, he's committed to the scholastic mission of
the University.
How many other Division I
coaches post top ten lists of the
players with the most units and
highest GPAs?
Don't worry, I'll wait.
He called out Michigan, his
alma mater, an excellent
scholastic institution, for lowering its standards for athletes.
He was flamed for his comments until people looked and
saw that he was right.

CROSS COUNTRY REGIONALSHH

Triumphant return
of Frick boosts XC
After having been sidelined with a hip injury,
Melissa Frick 'l2 returned to the lineup for the
women's cross country team at the NCAA Mideast
Regional Championship Meet Saturday.
In her first race of the season, Frick led the Garnet
to a ninth-place team finish in the 44-team field. Even
more impressive than the team finish was the Garnet's
depth Swarthmore was one of only five teams to land
all five scoring runners in the top 75. Frick covered the
six-kilometer course in 23:09.2, good for 35th place.
Rebecca Woo 11 came in for Swarthmore in 54th place.
Seniors Ashley Davies (63rd, 23:54.7), Nyika Corbett
(72nd, 24:017) and Lauren DeLuca (74th, 24:02.4) also
scored for the Garnet. Missing from the top places was
standout Hannah Rose 'l2, who ran with a broken foot,
finishing in 154th place.
Swarthmore was one of five conference teams to
place in the top ten; Johns Hopkins, Dickinson and
Haverford swept the top spots. Gettysburg was fifth.
Hopkins and Dickinson received automatic bids to the
national meet, and Haverford nabbed an at-large berth.
Lebanon Valley junior Jenn Cronin took the individual title in 21:39.2.
The Swarthmore men were led again by an impressive contingent of first-years at the front. Jacob Phillips
13 crossed first in the 8K for the Garnet in 26:35.1, good
enough for 54th place. He was followed by classmates
John McMinn and Brian King, who took 60th and 62nd
place, respectively. Patrick Hartnett 11 (27:313, 115th)
and Aidan Dumont-McCaffrey 'l3 (27:513,141th) rounded out the scoring positions for Swarthmore.
The Garnet men finished 14th out of 45 teams in the
regional field, just ahead of Muhlenberg, who finished
ahead of the Garnet at the Centennial Conference
Championships. The conference once again flexed its
strength, placing four teams (Haverford, Dickinson,
Johns Hopkins and Gettysburg) in the top 10 at the
regional meet. Haverford (3rd) and Dickinson (4th)
each received at-large bids to the national meet.
Allegheny's Chris Marker, a junior, won the regional title in 24:54.3.

2:18.90.

Osborn also led the Garnet in
the 200-yard individual medley,
taking second in 2:19.24.
Despite the loss, the teams' outlook remains positive. "F&M was
a really good meet for us," Laura
Pond 'l2 said. "A lot of people went
season best or even lifetime best
times. We swam really well, and
they did too. And now we have
something to prove when [the
Centennial
Conference
Championships] roll around."
Pond posted the top time for
Swarthmore in the
100-yard
freestyle, touching in 59.92.

For the swimmers, however, a
dual meet result is largely inconsequential in the quest for a win
at the eight-team conference
championship meet.
"This loss is only going to

make us work that much harder
to beat them when it really
counts," Pollen said.
For the men, the loss is the
fourth in five years to F&M, whom
they haven't beaten since 2006.
The women have fared slightly
better against them, having won
two out of the past three years
before last Saturday, but are now
on a two-year losing streak.

missed it, New England had the ball deep
in their own territory with a six-point
lead and just over two minutes left.
After a few lackluster plays and a
burned timeout, the Pats faced a fourthand-two situation and had to make a difficult decision.
Coach Bill Belichick decided to go for it
and seal the win, yet his pass to running
back Kevin Faulk came up short by less
than a foot (including a horrific spot by
the ball judge), giving Peyton Manning a
short field and a decent amount of time to

ed over Belichick's decision not to punt
and send his defense out on the field.

Having spent several hours determining

my own thoughts, I have a few words to
say about the results of the game.

There are two distinct aspects to consider surrounding the decision not to punt
the ball away on fourth down. The first
thing to understand is that the Patriot
offense is prolific to say the least. Brady
was having an excellent game, Randy
Moss had almost 200 receiving yards and
workhorseKevin Faulk was having a terrific day on the ground. Two yards is not a
long distance, and a fully elongated Brady
standing well over six feet could have fallen across the first down marker.
Additionally, historically, the Patriots
have been tremendously successful on
fourth-and-two attempts (over 70 percent),
so even though this call by Belichick
could be considered a gamble, the numbers were in fact on the Patriots' side.
Two yards was all New England needed to end the game and break the Colts'
unbeaten streak, but of course as we all
know, it was not in the cards. Not withstanding what appeared to be a terrible
spot on the play by the ball judge, even
though the Patriots came up short, the call
to go for it seems to have made sense from
a historical perspective, based on the
given information.
The other thing to consider about
Belichick's decision (and also the-reason

for the controversy) is that by electing to
go for it, there is a strong implication that
Belichick did not trust the defense to go
out and get a stop after the punt. Sure,
defensive players were probably disappointed by this decision (ESPN columnist
Teddy Bruschi certainly hammers this
point home).

It was as if Belichick had decided that
if Manning got the ball back into his
hands, he would lead the comeback drive
in the final minutes (which, of course, he
did). Yet it doesn't make sense, many
argue, to punt the ball away in that situation and make Manning drive 60-plus
yards downfield to earn the win, rather
than 30?
My opinion on the subject is that
Belichick made a good decision that just
went the wrong way. Looking at the numbers purely, though the Patriots historically had converted a vast majority of
fourth-and-two situations in the past, they
were not perfect. Naturally, some of the
time they are going to fail on that play.
That is why those eleven guys on defense
are on the field in the NFL they are the
best defensive players that the country
has to offer. Sure, it backfired on
Belichick, but let's remember, after all,
that it was a gamble not a sure thing.
Sometimes you just have to go for it.
Say history was on the Patriots' side
last night and they converted easily and
ran the clock out for the win. Would peo-

November 19, 2009

pie hail Belichick as a hero for gutting it
out? Probably not. I feel like most people
would just consider the fact that the
Patriots' offense is nothing short of terrific, and in a game where their stars really
showed up to play, converting a fourthand-two would have been just about par

for the course.
For these reasons, I stand behind the
call made by Belichick. Though of course
I wish New England had won the game, I
will always back an aggressive coach. Any
coach who makes a decision that says, "I
have enough faith in my team to make a
big play when it matters," should not be
maligned when it doesn't go his way. This
is life. We are human, and we make mistakes. Maybe this one play will prove to be
a tremendous catalyst for the Patriots who
will win out and go 15-3.
Maybe it will prove to be an epic collapse for a defense that now believes that
it doesn't have the full support of its coach
to make a stop late in the game when it

really matters.
However, given the demeanorand the
history of the Patriots franchise, I would
be surprised ifthis is talked about at all by

any members of the team or staff from
today on. The Patriots are defined by their
focus, and certainly I would like to see
them chalk this one up to chance and
move on in the season.

less empha-

sized reasons why sports are meaningful
to such a large portion of the U.S. population (98.7 million people, or a little less
than a third of the population, watched
last year's Superbowl). I wanted to provide reasons for every individual to be

even those individthankful for sports
uals who wouldn't find spending a
Thanksgiving evening watching the
Detroit Lions or Dallas Cowboys play football enjoyable (but who can blame them
for not wanting to watch the Lions?).
Late this summer, I read an article by
ESPN columnist Rick Reilly ("Camp
Sundown shines in the Bronx") describing a trip taken by 11 kids, diagnosed with
xeroderma pigmentosum, to Yankee
Stadium. Children with XP can never be
exposed to sunlight because they develop
cancerous tumors at the mere exposure to
UV rays (Reilly notes that individuals
with XP rarely live past the age oftwenty).
Yet here these kids were in Yankees
Stadium at 3 a.m., wearing sunblock and
covered head to toe with layers of clothing. There too were Yankees A.J. Burnett,
Alfredo Aceves and Derek Jeter, playing
Wiffle Ball with these children who could
barely imagine playing Wiffle Ball out in
the sun, let alone with professional athletes. And the kids loved it. Reilly's article
moved me.
Many people believe professional athletes earn too much money for performing
such an "unimportant" job; few deserve
the millions they are paid. To some, their
money spent on unnecessarily large houses and cars would be better spent, for
example, invested in the research for terminal illnesses.
But not all athletes are mercenaries
only seeking a higher paycheck. Many
athletes give back to the community. They
create funds and foundations to provide
better opportunities for impoverished
children or to provide aid to areas hit by
natural disasters. The Giving Fund,
which annually ranks the top celebrities
who have made the largest public donations, ranked six athletes in its top 30 for
2008. Pat Tillman, a former NFL player,
left his career as an athlete to enlist in the
U.S. Army months after the 9/11 attacks
(he was killed by friendly fire on April 22,
2004). Tillman was anything but a mercenary in pursuit of personal monetary
gain. He gave up his career, and ultimately his life, to do what he believed was
defending his country.
Most people think about the failure of
the government to provide aid and relief
to the inhabitants of the gulf when they
think about Hurricane Katrina. Most
think about the disaster's devastating
impact and the poor preparation that
allowed the calamity to occur. Few people
think about the NFL New Orleans Saints
when they think about the aftermath of
Katrina. But some of those inhabitants of
New Orleans who faced the decision of

THE PHOENIX

whether to leave the city they loved or to
in the metropolis that was devastated
by the natural disaster might. That year
the
Saints
reached
the
NFC
Championship Game. And I don't doubt
that their success gave the inhabitants of
New Orleans something to be proud of
and to be happy for amidst a year of devastation.
As seen by the impact of the Saints on
New Orleans residents, sports do not just
provide entertainment for some individuals; they become integrated into an individual's life and traditions. Sports have
the incredible ability to unite people
together over generations, religions, ethnicities and classes. One of the most powerful memories I have of my childhood
was watching the Yankees play baseball
with my father. For years, we watched the
Yankees win championship after championship. Together. Even when the Yankees
lost, the time we spent watching was
important; it gave us time to bond and talk
about a common interest, something that
was lacking in our relationship when I
was younger due to a cultural gap. The
effect sports had on our relationship may
seem petty to other people, but I still
called my dad from Swarthmore the night
the Yankees won the World Series this
year. And I'm sure there are many sports
fans out there who can recall similar experiences when sports brought family members across generations together.
But the unifying power of sports isn't
just restricted to a single household;
sports can unify entire cities (as seen in
New Orleans, or other cities with strong
historic backgrounds for sports such as
Pittsburgh) and can unify entire countries. It can resolve conflict. Most people
are familiar with how a segregated town
was united by football during the Civil
Rights Movement in Remember the
Titans (hearing Hurst and Harris chant
"Left side!" and "Strong side!" still gives
me chills). But how many people know
that the 2006 World Cup caused fighting
factions in the Cote d'lvoire, a country in
the midst of a civil war, to agree to a ceasefire? And how marly believe that one
hockey game can have a huge impact on a
country's morale? The U.S.'s victory over
the Soviet Union (who at the time had
what most considered the best hockey
team in the world) in the 1980 Winter
Olympics atLake Placid obviously did not
end the Cold War, but can there be any
doubt of the victory's impact on the
American people's morale? For a few
weeks that winter, nearly all the people in
the entire country, in spite of differences,
united in support of a hockey team comprised of college kids, who were able to
pull off one of the hugest upsets in sports
history. Are there more telling examples
depicting the power of sports?
Most athletes don't spend their time
trying to discover cures for terminal illnesses or fighting for equality for less fortunate individuals. The majority of professional athletes can hardly be considered angels, but sometimes making a difference in the world for some of these athletes does not necessarily, mean donating
millions to charity. Sometimes something
as simple as giving a child who lacks the
opportunity the experience of his or her
lifetime is just as important and meaningful. Sometimes individuals don't need athletes to be their saviors; sometimes it's
enough that sports bring people together.
At the very least, sports are something
everyone can be thankful for.

Purkey 11 to put the Garnet ahead in
the 71st minute. This would prove to
be all Swarthmore needed to reach
the final.
Meanwhile, Behrend, the fourth
seed, knocked off top-seed Penn
State-Altoona in the semifinals in a
5-3 penalty kick decision after overtime periods still left the teams in a
scoreless draw.
The Garnet end the 2009 campaign
with a record of 16-4-1. Swarthmore
will return 20 players in 2010 in what
looks to be a promising outing to
make good on its early-season rankings and gain a berth in the NCAA
tournament.

Soccer reaches second consecutive Round of 16
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
In the final month of the 2009
regular season, the men's soccer
team won just twice in a five-game
stretch after starting the year at
13-L But in the first weekend of
the 2009 NCAA Tournament, the
Garnet equaled its post-Oct. 13 win
total, defeating the United States
Merchant Marine Academy and
Hobart College, each by a score of
2-L
After finishing the regular season at 14-1-2, the Garnet lost in the
semifinals of the Centennial
Conference playoffs to Johns
Hopkins before earning an at-large
bid to the NCAA Division 111
men's soccer Tournament.
In Saturday's first round
matchup on Clothier Field, the
team found themselves down
early, as the Mariners capitalized
on a pretty back-door run just four
minutes and four seconds into the
game to take a 1-0 lead. But the
Garnet showed resilience, battling
back and tying the game on a Gage
Newman 11 header off a free kick
from Kieran Reichert 13.

With just 4.6 seconds remaining in the half, a Dylan Langley 'lO

cross deflected off the head of a
defender and into the back of the
net, giving the Garnet the 2-1 halftime lead a lead that would never
be relinquished. That goal allowed
the Garnet to play defensive soccer in the second half as the
Mariners pushed for an equalizing
-

goal.

"{Getting that own goal] was
just to completely
enormous
turn the momentum in our favor,
and to be able to come out in the
second half and protect the lead as

opposed to get the lead

unbe-

lievable. It made for a completely
different mindset and made for a
huge amount of confidence on our
team," said head coach Eric
Wagner, who led the Garnet to the
Sweet 16 in last year's NCAA
Tournament before falling to
Amherst College.
The Garnet has now allowed
just three second-half goals all
year while it has scored 22. "We
are very fit, and we are very deep,
and we know how to take a game
all the way through
it makes a
big difference when your mindset
...

is "we have to go to the end and we
have to play as hard as we can

throughout'
we do set our
resolve a lot more firmly in the
second half. Guys know when the
game is on the line," Wagner
added.
But it was Zach Weimar 11 in
goal who made the play of the second half, helping to preserve the
Garnetvictory. With the ball loose
in the Swarthmore box, Weimar
made two quick saves, including
one while lying on the ground,
before diving across the goalmouth to block a third shot.
The win on Saturday set the
stage for a Sunday showdown with
Hobart College, a team that
unleashed 43 shots in a Saturday
win over St. Josephs (L.1.), just two
off of the NCAA Division 111
But on
Tournament record.
Sunday, in a game that featured
...

eight bookings and three red
cards, the Garnet was able to shut
down the Statesmen attack, holding Hobart to just two shots after

halftime.

For the second night in a row,
the Garnet men found themselves
down a goal early, as a deflected
shot bounced into the net just
under 17 minutes into the game.
After a flurry of fouls and cards,
the Garnet began to dictate play,
taking 15 shots and gaining 12 corners in the second half.
As the Garnet pressured the
Statesmen defense late into the
second half, it was John Pontillo
'l3 who came
off of the
Swarthmore bench in the second
half, finding Morgan Langley 11 at
the top of the Hobart box. Langley
turned inside and unleashed a
laser, and with 4 minutes and 40
seconds remaining in the second
half, the Garnet tied the game at
one. For Langley, the team's leading scorer, it was his 14th goal of
the year. For Pontillo, it was his
first career point.
"We subbed [Pontillo] in late in
the game, thinking that he would
give us a better chance to score,
primarily because he is so good in
the air, and we were getting all
these headers and corner kicks
and chances in their box and so
for him to set up the goal in the
way he did, it was a bit unusual,
but no surprise, because he is a
good player," Wagner said.
"I was shocked and relieved
when that ball hit the back of net.
The first thought was 'How did
that happen?' Then I was just
excited because I knew the game
would be ours after that," said
Langley, who averaged just under
a goal per game during the regular

was Phillipe Celestin 11, with his

the Garnet back to the Sweet 16.

career goal could hardly have
come at a better time.
Though the Garnet had played
four NCAA Tournament games
entering Sunday, Celestin had not
been active for any of them. After
suffering a broken hand last season before the Tournament, he
was unavailable on Saturday
while directing a composition on
campus.
"As soon as I took the shot, I

Celestin, who has worked through
