Symposium tackles issues in women's athletics
BY DANTE FUOCO
dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

Jenepher Shillingford admits
that her collegiate coaching days

are over. But as the keynote
speaker at last Sunday's first
annual Women in Sports
Symposium, she said that sports
are always going to be a part of
her life.
"There are a lot of ways you
can give back to women's athletics without coaching," she said to
a room of about 50 students, faculty and coaches. "I'm 76, and I'm
going to stay involved until my
last breath."
In an effort to both celebrate
the history of women in athletics
and address still-present gender
inequality in sports, Anna Baeth
'O9 and Erin Heaney 'O9 organized
a three-hour symposium last
Sunday afternoon in the Scheuer
Room.

"The symposium today was to
celebrate the history of women in
sport, celebrate current female
student-athletes at Swarthmore,
and learn how we can stay
encouraging
involved
and
women and girls to stay in the
sport in the future," Heaney said.
Baeth and Heaney, who were
captains of the college's field
hockey and volleyball teams,
respectively, were inspired to
holdthis symposium after attending
Snell-Shillingford
the
Symposium this past January,
which was founded and hosted in
part by Shillingford. The symposium focused on promoting
careers for women in athletics,
stressing that while the number
of women's teams today is at an
all-time high since the implementation of Title IX, the representation of female college coaches is
actually at an all-time low.
In 1972, Title IX was passed,
which states that "no person in
the United States shall, on the
basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."
Back then, women coached more
than 90 percent of women teams;
now it is roughly 42 percent, the
lowest ever, according to a 29 longitudinal study conducted by
Linda Jean Carpenter and R.
Vivian Acosta of Brooklyn
College. The percentage of all
women head coaches is also at an
all-time low of roughly 18 percent.

Athletics falls under the provisions of Title LX. The most common way to discern equality
between male and female teams
is to compare certain areas, such
as opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring, provision oflocker rooms and practice
and competitive facilities, medical training facilities and services, and financial assistance.
In addition to celebrating
women's history, Baeth said that

THE PHOENIX

the college's symposium was
meant to "[educate] current student-athletes about Title LX and
the implications of it in our daily
lives and in the future of other

student-athletes."
"We wanted to come back
[from the Snell-Shillingford conference] and share what we
learned with the campus," she
said.
The symposium started with a
panel of six women who are
involved in sports, from current
college head coaches, to the college's own associate athletic
director, to an internationalfield
hockey umpire. Baeth asked
them, among other questions,
how gender has affected their
role in athletics and what ways
women in the future can stay
involved.
Of the 50 people who attended,
an overwhelming number of
them were female student-athletes. Despite the fact that Baeth
and Heaney said that they invited
all of the college's sports teams,
women's head soccer coach Todd
Anckaitis and men and women's
cross country and track head
coach Peter Carroll were the only
men who attended.
After the panel, Shillingford
gave an hour-long talk, followed
by a question and answer session. She talked about how Title
LX has and still does face criticism. The law became defunct
between 1980 and 1992. And, in
2003, the Bush administration
considered ending it.
"I'm not sure if the fight will
ever be over... because it's about
money and power," she said. But
having a symposium like this is a
positive "way to spread the word
that things are still in flux."
She added that, for change to
be made, 'everyone needs to get
involved," whether it be coach-

ing, participating, encouraging
others to participate or even writing about sports.
In addition to helping found
the
Snell-Shillingford
Symposium, Shillingford is a former president of the United
States Hockey Association, and

she served as a coach and
Athletic Director at Bryn Mawr
College for 20 years.
Lacrosse player Kelsey Hatzell
'O9, who attended the symposium,
said in an e-mail that she thought
the symposium helped to "create
a space for sharing experience
multiple
generations
from
regarding the ongoing struggle
with Title IX."
"While I have not witnessed
the Title LX struggles first hand, I
have reaped the benefits that
came with Title LX, and thusI feel
an obligation to stay informed,
and seek out methods to address
the present problems," she said.
Hatzell added that she was
surprised that Title IX, though
enacted decades ago, still doesn't
stand on "firm ground."
"The fact that there exists a
contingent that opposes its pur-

pose was shocking," she said.

"This is an ongoing problem, and
while we have made great
strides, continued progress can
only be met with the current generation's participation."
Heaney and Baeth were
pleased with how the symposium
went. In some ways, they were
surprised at some of the panel
and audience's responses, namely about what it means to be a
feminist.
When Baeth asked the panel if
they considered themselves feminists, its members were split.
When a member of the panel
turned the question to the audience, Heaney said, "not as many

hands shot up as we thought
would, which is interesting
because this is Swarthmore."
"It brought up some new
issues, even for Erin and I,"
Baeth said. The question prompted many to ponder what the term
means, such as if it's stigmatized
as equivalent to "man-hater,"
Heaney added.
The college's most famous
feminist, Alice Paul, was actively
involved in sports, Baeth said.
Paul, who was at the forefront of
the women's movement in the
early 20th century, played three
sports at the college and started
the college's women's basketball

team.

"I feel like people always disregard athletics at Swarthmore,
but it really is embedded in what
Swarthmore is," Baeth said.
Though she and Baeth are
graduating, Heaney said that
they both hope that the symposium continues in the future.
"We'd be willing to help anyone that wanted to [organize it],"
said Heaney.
And though there are still
obstacles ahead, Shillingford
ended the symposium on a positive note, citing an Irish proverb.
"Life isn't about surviving the
storm," said Shillingford. "Life is
about taking a deep breath and
dancing in the rain."

NEWS IN BRIEF ■■

Student issued citation after Genderfuck
Early morning on Sunday,
April 5, a Swarthmore student
walking
home from the

Genderfuck Party was given a
citation by the Borough Police
for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. The student,
who the incident report
described as a 22-year-old white
male, was stopped on North
Chester Road and brought to
the Swarthmore police station
to wait for Public Safety.
According to the report, Public
Safety was then called to transport him back to his residence.
According to Swarthmore
Police Chief Brian Craig,
Springfield police officer Sean
Clifton found the student, who
was wearing a dress, in the
company of others walking on
North ChesterRoad. "He was in
the middle of the highway and
he wouldn't get out of the highway,"
said.
The
Craig
Springfield officer detained the
student until a member of the
Swarthmore police department
arrived.
According to the incident
report, "Upon arrival [Roger
Hinckley, the Swarthmore officer who responded to the call]

did observe Officer Clifton

attempting to secure the subject
who was combative. [He] then
assisted in placing the subject

In speaking
...

with both the officers on location and his friends, [the student] was loud and yelling profanities."
However, the student gave a
different account of the incident. He stated that he was
walking on the sidewalk when
the officers first detained him,
though he said that he hadbeen
walking in the street prior to
their arrival. He claims thatthe
officers assaulted him. "After
being taken off of the sidewalk,
a third police car pulled up:
another officer emerged and
immediately placed a boot on
my neck, while I was face down
and handcuffed, without knowing anything about what had
been going on," he said in an email to The Phoenix.
Though the student was not

Craig, police protocol does not

er when issuing a citation for

public drunkenness.

While most students who are
citations for public
drunkenness are not brought to
the police station, Chief Craig
stated that the student was
detainedfor his own safety, and
that he was brought to the station to wait for Swarthmore
Public Safety, who transported
him back to his residence. "He
was brought into the station
because of the way he was
behaving," said Craig. "Our
main concern was his safety."
However,
the
student
believed that his "status as a
partying college student in a
dress influenced the officer's
unfortunate handling of the situation."
Craig, though, denied that
the student's dress made him a
target.
"He was in the company of
other people who were similarly attired, but that's not why he
was stopped," he said.
The student said that he is
considering "the best way to
take action against the
Swarthmore and Springfield
Police."

Alumna opens Costa Rican
summer primate field school

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Xingyu Zhang Phoenix Staff

Peace Week represents the refugees who will die in Bhutan, Palestine, Darfur
and the Congo due to a lack of response through a Die In demonstration

Last year alumna Lorna Joachim 'B5 started a primate field school in Costa Rica alongside Grainne McCabe in hopes of changing
systemic problems in the field of behavioral
studies such as the lack of interest in local
populations. The field school, TREE (Tropical
Research in Ecology and Ethology) Field
Studies, offers students a month-long course
during the summer where they are immersed
in the environment they are studying.
"The idea behind our field school, in
terms of the primate courses, is to give students who've never been in the field before a
safe experience, as safe as you can make it,"
Joachim said. "We focus primarily on the
tools that they might need to start in graduate school. "The program mainly focuses
upon primate behavior and ecology. It gives
students the opportunity to pursue an independent research project on one of three
species of monkeys while simultaneously
learning basic observational skills.
"Part of the difficulty is learning how to
figure out that that's a monkey up there and
not a bunch of birds or a bunch of leaves,"
Joachim said. "We introduce them to the forest, and some of themdon't even know how to
navigate, let alone use a compass or a GPS."
Joachim created the school after completing a traditional academic course of study.
She graduated from Swarthmore with a
degree in biology, a passion for macrobiology
and no career plans. Back at home, Joachim
took classes at UCLA in primate behavior
and collected data at a zoo. She went to graduate school at the University of New Mexico
and got a doctorate in evolutionary psychology.

McCabe, a behavioral ecologist, noted that
most field school instructors are in her field.
She finds Joachim's field of study to be a

Chamber Concert in Lang Concert Hall.

great extenuation of the school's focus.
"As a psychologist, Lorna approaches the
study of primate behavior from a slightly different angle, bringing in neuropsychology,
theories of child development, personality
and cooperation among individuals to our
discussions of why the monkeys behave as

they do, which is a fantastic compliment to
the main socio-ecological theories of physical
anthropology that focus on food availability, seasonality, predator protection and competition as drivers of wild primate behavior,"

McCabe said.
Joachim teaches part-time at the
University of New Mexico and does behavioral research on primate intelligence.
Originally, the problems that Joachim and
McCabe saw in other field schools prompted
them to form their own. "We wanted our own
business so that we could control the way we
were run," she said. The school gives students space to make mistakes and discover
whether fieldwork is for them before they are
thrust into a pressurized graduate school
atmosphere.

She also referred to the way that some
field schools can be proprietary, exclusive
and uninterested in local populations. "We
wanted to not treat residents of the country
poorly. Part of every student tuition goes to
pay for a year of high school for a needy
Costa Rican student." In addition, field
school students must participate in Spanish
lessons. According to the school's website,
this measure is "to encourage cooperation
and collaboration with local Costa Rican
scholars and students."
Joachim attributes part of this social consciousness to her time at Swarthmore.
"There's a certain kind of person that wants
April 9, 2009

to make sure they're not leaving a big huge
negative imprint on everything
I can't
...

even separate that from my academic interest. I can't go into a place and decide I'm
going to use something and just leave it. I
think that I got a lot of that from socializing
with like-minded people [at Swarthmore]."
Swarthmore's educational values also
gave Joachim a sense ofhow to teach, both in
the undergraduate classroom and out in the
field. "I run into students getting upset
because they have professors and can't find
them," Joachim said. "During office hours,
they lock themselves in. That's not
Swarthmore. Their doors are open, and that's
a really important aspect of this process."
The sheer academic rigor of Swarthmore
also gave her a great push in graduate school
and beyond. Joachim described her experience in graduate school as comparatively
easy: "The rigors of Swarthmore made everything afterwards just simple. I think that the
big thing about Swat is that it's so darn hard
and rigorous. It's just easier when you get

out."
The field school gives Joachim a chance to
get to know students one-on-one. "The thing
that makes the field school for me fun and
interesting is that I feel like we spend a ton of
time with students and that there's a real
connection there in terms of mentoring and
friendship," she said.
The close living quarters and constant
contact force Joachim to also act as a mediator. "It's sort of like the first week of school,
but for a month," she said. "There are some
clashes, so part of our job is to be den mothers."
This "den mother" role is partially the
product of Joachim's background in psychology and behavioral observation. "It's hard to
separate out humans from the rest of primate
being an expert in
order in my mind
behavioral observation, I can't just not sit
there and not see what's going on behaviorally. It almost invariably happens that
someone comes up and says, 'hey, you may
not know that this is going on, but I see the
tension.'"
McCabe also commented on the exciting
yet difficult aspects of running a field school.
"We've been chased by herds of cattle,
trapped between a fer-de-lance (an incredibly poisonous and aggressive snake) and a
deep rushing river, stuck in mud up to
our knees, had close calls with machetes
while cutting trails and had to handle both
the social drama and inevitable physical
injuries of the students, such as infected
insect bites and mystery rashes," McCabe
said. "But through it all we have helped each
other remain positive and keep the goal in
mind, to educate these students about the
importance
of primate conservation
and understanding animal behavior in
the wild."
In addition to improving the social relations among students, Joachim would also
like professors and students to get more use
out of the resources she's set up in Costa
Rica. "We have all the contexts. What we
really want to do is get people utilizing this
resource," she said. She envisions professors
teaching courses and students pursuing independent research projects during breaks.
She also hopes to offer more courses over
the summer. Hosting additional professors
and courses allows her to expand the student
experience and to continue developing her
own skills.
"One person, Alain Houle from the
Harvard Natural History Museum, wants to
teach for us," she said. "He does tree climbing. If he's down there, I'm going to do it."

Rooted in the sciences, two named Goldwater Scholars
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE, ASHIA TROIANO

arollel@swarthmore.edu,
atroianl@swarthmore.edu

Two Swarthmore juniors, Benjamin
Good and Markus Kliegl, were recently
named Goldwater scholars for the 2009-10
academic year, and another junior, Julia
Berthet, received Honorable Mention.
Named after Senator Barry Goldwater,
the scholarship provides rising-juniors
and rising-seniors with up to $7,500
towards their annual school-related
expenses. The scholarship is geared
toward students who have demonstrated
commitment to and are pursuing studies
in natural sciences, mathematics and
engineering.
Colleges and universities can nominate a maximum of four students for the
award. This year, 278 undergraduates

across the country were selected for the
award, out of an applicant pool of more
than 1,000 students who were nominated
by their faculties. After an internal
review process, Swarthmore nominated
four students. "There's no cap [to how
many people can apply for nomination],
but usually we get in the neighborhood
of eight to ten," said Melissa Mandos,
Fellowships and Prizes Advisor. "We'd
like to encourage people interested in the
sciences to take a good look at the scholarship."
Good thought that, overall,

it was not

the application process that involved a
lot of work though.
"It's surprisingly easy in terms of the
amount of work you have to do compared to a lot of the other big scholarships. Really you just have to fill out an
application and you write an essay about
your summer research and you have to
go through an interview to get nominated, but other than that it's pretty
straightforward," Good said. "The real
work comes both in the couple years
here in courses and doing research."
Most students who apply for the
Goldwater have already done some sort
of research in their respective fields.
Even though it does not necessarily need
to be research the student plans on pursuing in the future, Kliegl said "it's
important to be able to talk about what
research you did in a sensical way." Both
Good and Kliegl have done in-depth
research so far at Swarthmore.
"I worked on a subject called quantum walks, which is a quantum mechanical analog of classical random walks
that draws on topics like graph theory,
convergence theory," Kliegl said. "People
have become interested in it because of
its applications in quantum computers."
"I was doing my research in mathematical network theory and by network
I mean
it could be really a network of
anything, a network of friendships,"
Good said. "Specifically I was working

on codifying group structure of really
large networks."
As Goldwater scholars, Kliegl and
Good are now preparing for careers in
the sciences. "After Swarthmore I plan to
go to graduate school, right now I'm trying to decide between going to graduate
school in physics or going to graduate
school in applied math," Good said.
"There's also this area called complex

Kliegl plans on getting a Ph.D. in

In the past couple of years, there has
been at least one Swarthmore student
that has received recognition from the
Goldwater. "We've had great fortune
with the Goldwater. We have a really
good track record with it," Mandos said.
"Professors are really encouraging students to apply."
Kliegl is an honors math major, an

International Week kick-off
showcases cultural talents
BY KATHERINE ERNST
kernstl@swarthmore.edu

The International Club, known as i2O
after the form that allows foreign students
into the United States, kicked off
International Week on April 5 with the
annual Cultural Show in Upper Tarble. The
show celebrated cultures from across the
globe and featured performances by students, most of whom were internationals.
In order of appearance, Sergio Rivas 'lO
remixed and sang pop hit "Uno y Uno Igual
a Tres" by Venezuelan-Brit Jeremias; five
members of the Capoeira group showcased
an Afro-Brazilian blend of martial arts and
dance; Ozan Erturk 'l2 wove complex rhythmic patterns of Turkish drumming; Aakash
Suchak 'll read aloud his own South Asian
poetry and that of a Swarthmore alum; Min
Sern Teh 'l2 shared Malaysian folk songs;
Haichao Wu 'l2 wrote a favorite poem from
his childhood in Chinese calligraphy and
explained its meaning; the Mariachi Band
performed three songs with string instruments, brass and vocals; and Michael Park
'll, Daniel Hwang 'll, Steve Han 11, Jun Seop
Lee 'll and Hae-in Park 'l2 performed the
Korean Stomp Nanta Dance.
The final performance was an impressive
showcasing of Taekwondo by Taekwondo
and Karate Club officers Philip Chodrow 'l2

with the foot,' kwon means 'to strike or
smash with the hand,' and do means 'as a
way of life.' You're supposed to show etiquette in what you do, modesty, perseverance, self-control and indomitable spirit."
This year, Adriana Popa 'l2, the
International Club's public relations officer
and the only first-generation Romanian student currently attending the college, hosted
International Week's Cultural Show. Popa
also performed a set of personal narratives
and a Romanian folksong during the event.
According to Popa, the purpose of the
Cultural Show was to "start International
Week with a 'boom' and to get people to actually participate and be interested in it."
Furthermore, the show was intended "to
give people a chance to perform and show off
their talents" as well as to "advertise the
club a little bit, because there are a lot of
people who don'tknow what i2O is about, the
people who are part of it, or the activities,"
she said.
This year, International Week events will
include various film screenings in the LPAC
cinema, including "Sepet" from Malaysia,
"Amores Perros" from Mexico, "Let the
Right One In" from Sweden, "Yesterday,"
from South Africa and a film from India that
has yet to be determined. In addition, on
Friday, April 10 from 4 to 6 p.m. there will be
an international fair on Parrish walkway.

Haverford selects new dean CR/NC change denied
BY ANDREW THOMSPON

BICONEWS.COM, MARCH 24
Concluding a search process over three months
in the making, Haverford has selected Dr. Martha J.
Denney as the new Dean of the College. Denney will
replace current Dean of the College Greg
Kannerstein '63, who will be moving to a new position as Senior Advisor to Institutional

Advancement.
Since July 2008, Denney had been serving at
Georgetown University as the Associate Dean and
Director of the Undergraduate Program at the
Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service.
President Stephen G. Emerson '74 said she will
start at Haverford on July L
"She's delighted to come, and she's really looking
forward to it," said Emerson.
Adam Lewis 10, one of three student representatives to the Dean Search Committee, explained the
35-page, single-spaced final report the committee put

together.
"[The Report] basically outlined the whole
process: how many applications we'd screened, how
many people we went through in the 12 airport interviews in the hotel, and then the four [candidates]
that came to campus, and the responses they had. We
also included the general senses from the [online]

feedback forms," said Lewis.
Maria Yee 'O9, another student representative to
the Committee, said that at the Committee's final
meeting on Friday, March 6, "we went around and
asked everyone to rank the candidates one through
four, and the report we sent to Emerson included

[those rankings]."

Ammanuel Zegeye 'O9, the third student representative, explained that while they only got to see
the student responses to the online feedback forms,
they got to see every form at the meeting.
"Every evaluation we received was read aloud at
that meeting," Yee added.
Zegeye also said that President Emerson "came to
us Friday afternoon, and asked us to justify our
choices."
Emerson commented on the other forms of input
he and the Committeereceived.
"Lots of folks came in the door to talk," he said.
"We had reference letters, the dean's office staff
themselves. As with any search process, you get ref-

erences from people who call, and also people who
don't, to [get a good sense of the person]."
Emerson added, "The overall preference of the
Committee was very clear. Martha was on everybody's list, top one or two people."
Students' Council Co-President Harrison Haas 10
concurred.
"There were two candidates that students had
really strong, positive feelings for," Harrison Haas
said. "Though there were some students who liked
the other candidate better, there were a lot who like
Martha Denney, and I think as we get to know her
better, that will increase."
Students' Council Co-President Will Harrison 'lO
described Denney as a "strong presence, but genuine."
"She also seemed to be very comfortable in general with the idea of student self-government," added
Will Harrison.
Zegeye said being a representative to the Search
Committee was a good experience.
"It's good to meet new people on the back end, the
faculty and the administration, and also see how the
process works. I had to remember all the time that I
wasn't just representing my own views, I'm representing everyone else as well," explained Zegeye.
Lewis said, "It was really cool to see how much
our opinions were valued, with students serving on
the committee as equal members."
Said Yee, "I was always conscious of my biases
and how they would effect the committee, which is
why I tried not to pick a favorite until the end."
Current Dean Kannerstein said that his new job
at Haverford will be 50 percent time as Senior
Advisor to the Institutional Advancement Office.
"The part I'm most excited about will be connecting
alumni," he said.
Kannerstein will also teach a course each semester.

"The first semester will be on the history ofliberal arts colleges in America, specifically in the case of
Haverford. I think I might be doing some journalism
stuff as well," saidKannerstein.
Kannerstein also mentioned his plans to write a
book about the college. "I'm seeking advice from former colleagues, I also think the history course will
kickstart that process, the students will be doing a
lot of research, and there's a lot of undiscovered lore
about the place."

During Fall Plenary, Dasha Mikic 'O9 proposed a resolution to
allow grades that are covered through the Credit/No Credit
(CR/NC) option to be uncovered, should a student so chose. The res-

olution passed, but was not put into immediate effect because of
Faculty Curriculum Committee (FCC) concerns.
The next the student body heard of the resolution was in an
email addressed from Judy Barr 'O9, Head of the Student
Curriculum Committee (SCC), a few days before spring break. The
email included the FCC's response on the subject. In short, they
were against the CR/NC policy change.
students who performed well would
"If we made this change
uncover their grades and students who performed poorly would not
do so. The implication would be that any grade of 'CR' that
remained on the transcript would be covering a low grade. Making
this change therefore undermines the intent of the CR/NC system,"
wrote the FCC.
As demonstrated at Fall Plenary by the strong student support
for the resolution, some Mawrters feel differently about the issue.
"I've taken Credit/No Credit classes in the past and had experiences where I performed exceptionally well in classes that I would
have otherwise been hesitant to take," said Mikic.
Mikic notes that it would be advantageous to gain numerical
credit for a class that would otherwise merely go down as simply a
"pass." Before writing the resolution, she consulted friends on the
issue and found that they felt the same.
Although the faculty rejected the resolution, Barr acknowledged
"the FCC is very much interested in maintaining the dialogue with
the student community."
Mikic, however, thought there needed to be more dialogue
between the FCC and students from the onset of the discussion
process. The faculty's decision should have been more visible to
students, she said, rather than in an email that could easily be overlooked. "If students can't hear the points that are being made, they
can't respond to it," Mikic said.
Mikic's goal is to keep the dialogue between faculty and the students alive. "I am trying to start a dialogue, trying to keep it going
and not disappear," she said.
The resolution, having twice been proposed and successfully
passed at this past Fall Plenary and another plenary two years ago,
appears stuck in a stagnant state. Yet, clearly all sides of the equation including the FCC, the SCC, and Mikic herself, are willing to
continue to refine the resolution. "It is true that [the FCC] did not
accept the resolution, but they are willing to work on it," said Barr,
who added that few students have approached her with ideas about
how to improve the resolution. She encourages any student to
email her at jebarr@brynmawr.edu with concerns or suggestions.

BMC Board requests input for Halloween Party changes
BY LARKEN WRIGHT-KENNEDY

BICONEWS.COM, APRIL 3

In preparation for submission
of its final report on the Rhoads
and Radnor Halloween parties to
the Bryn Mawr administration,
the Alcohol Concerns Review
Board held an open forum on
Wednesday, March 25, asking for
student input about possible
changes to the parties to make
them a safer, more enjoyable
experience for all involved.
The Board tried to make it
clear that they recognize student's desire to have the
Halloween parties, which are an
"unofficial tradition" at Bryn
Mawr, according to Horvath.
However, the Board emphasized that given the six hospitalizations, two arrests, and property damage that happened at this
year's parties, something must be
done before next year.
"We want the events to happen, but they need to change,"
said Mary Beth Horvath, Student

Activities Coordinator.
The Alcohol Concerns Review
Board
members present at

THE PHOENIX

Wednesday's

discussion were
Horvath, Dean Raima Evan,
Director of Public Safety Mike
Hill, and SGA-appointed student
member Jessica Coulter 10.
Theresa Cann, Assistant Dean
and Director of International
Programs, Associate Director of
Public Safety and Transportation
Steve Green, and Katherine
Lewis 'l2 also sit on the board but
were unable to attend the discussion.
Horvath insisted that the
Board was not the "final decisionmaker" and they were only
responsible for providing the recommendations to President Jane
McAuliffe. Horvath admitted that
there had been talk of not having
the parties next fall due to the
events that occurred during this
year's event.
For Hill and the rest of Public
Safety, "overcrowding is a concern" for multiple reasons.

Both Radnor and Rhoads go
over their maximum capacity
each Halloween because of the
number of people waiting to get
into the parties. In addition, a
majority of the people who come

to Bryn Mawr for the parties do
not actually get in, resulting in
strangers wandering around campus.
However, these attendees are
not Bi- or Tri-Co students; they
are people who come to Bryn
Mawr
from Drexel,
Penn,
Delaware, New Jersey, and even
upstate New York, looking to

have a good time but who are
unable to get into either party.

The far-reaching appeal of the
Bryn Mawr Halloween parties,
with its resultant overcrowding
and displacement of strangers
onto campus, is why the Board
initially suggested changing the
party guest policy to include Bryn
Mawr students only, allowing
each Mawrter to bring one guest.
Many students spoke against
the suggested change.
Steph Hilton 'O9 advocated for
keeping the party open to the BiCo so as not to damage relations
between the two schools.
"If Haverford was having a
party that I knew I couldn't go to,
I'd be reaUy mad," said Hilton.
Tally Cox 'lO pointed out that if
the party were closed to

April 9, 2009

Haverford students, then they
would start having their own parties and Halloween would
"become just like every other

Bryn Mawr party."
Taking student's views into

consideration, the Board decided

a negative response from the students surrounding the suggestion, but multiple people supported the change.
Changing the location would
allow 150 more people into the
party. Also, moving the party out
of a residence hall would ensure
greater safety for residents.
Horvath hopes that changing
the location of the party from

included access to bathrooms and

students that would feature their
host student's name. Having the
host's name on the wristband
would make that student responsible for the person she choose to
let in as her one guest.
Alternative events, such as a
horror movie marathon in the
Campus Center, were also proposed to give students who do not
want to attend the parties a celebration of their own.
The biggest change, however,

that is considered a national landmark. Also discussed was hiring
professional bouncers to monitor

the entrances of the parties.
Nearly everyone agreed that
doing so would be beneficial for

student safety. Having heard student suggestions and concerns,

Film series talks normalcy of porn
BY MAKI SOMOSOT
msomosol@swarthmore.edu
How does someone attempt to contextualize and historicize something
like porn? This happens to be the big
overhanging question that accompanies "Moving Image Pornography," the
contentious three-part film and lecture
series currently being featured during
open hours at the Women's Resource
Center. More importantly, how do we,
as an audience, respond to a cultural
taboo like pornography with open
minds when it is being shown in a public setting?
Featured for three Tuesday nights
in a row from 9:30 p.m. to 12:00 am (the
last screening is next Tuesday, April
14), "Moving Image Pornography" is an
upfront investigation of the early historiography, the various evolutions
involved and the polemic stemming
from the porn industry. More than a
documentation of its intricacies and
special context, the series also explores
the numerous modes of public distribution of pornography, and how they
have shifted over time. From a timeline of stag films, vintage erotica
(namely "Emmanuelle," "Polissons et
Galipettes," "Suburbia Confidential"),
to more contemporary video-graphic
representations of sex ("Pornotopia,"
"American Porn," "Deep Throat,"

"Midnight Cowboy"), "Moving Image
Pornography" tracks how the tastes of

the

mainstream audience have
changed toward pornography.
"Porn started out as an underground genre which was illegally produced and viewed," said Kevin Kim 'll,

the creative mind behind the series.
"There was initially this idea of
home-sociality in the early stag films of
the 1900s, where porn was only shown
in elk clubs, fraternities and male civic
groups. Then there was "porn chic' in
the 19705, a point when everyone was
watching it in movie theaters."
"Porn chic" refers to a specific time
period in the early 1970s when it was
considered fashionable to watch and
discuss pornographic films such as
"Deep Throat," "Behind the Green
Door" and "Boys in the Sand" in mainstream moviehouses. For instance, the
soft-core
erotic
French
film
"Emmanuelle," which was featured
this past Tuesday, became a definitive
symbol of the porn chic phenomenon
when it was taken up by Columbia
Pictures Industries, Inc. for massive
public distribution.This begs the questions as to when and how pornography
was originially integrated into the
mainstream cinema experience as a
legitimate genre. Through public film

screenings,
"Moving
Image
Pornography" attempts to channel this
mode of public consumptio which is
an approach to porn-watching that
modern audiences would recoil at.
"I'm not going to pretend it's not terribly awkward to watch porn with a
bunch of people you know, but as we
learned at the first session, that's just
getting back to its historical roots,"
,

Lauren Stokes 'O9 said. "So the very
idea and experience of the porn film
series is a weird way to transport yourself into the pre-Internet era of pornography, which is neat."
After taking Marjorie Murphy's his-

Tory class "Engendering Culture" his
freshman year, Kim became interested
in the academic and social discourse of
pornography, especially in its resulting
impact on how norms and stereotypes
have been engendered. "There has
been a transformation in perceptions
of masculinity in American pop culture
men have been making use of
domestic spaces to express their masculinity, through the bachelor pad and
the office, and to some extent, even
through women to serve as their accessories," Kim said. He also emphasized
the importance of looking beyond the
superficial associations that are part of
the mainstream porn label to probe
deeper social issues. "It's an important
discussion to have, how to move
beyond the porn vs. anti-porn debate.
How should we study porn?"
The Women's Resource Center
board had their own reasons for sponsoring and publicizing Kim's event for
the Swarthmore student community at
large. "I think this is the sort of thing
we need more of at Swarthmore: interested students coming together to listen to interested students speak about
their passions," said Jessica Holler 'lO,
a board member. "I hope that the WRC
open hours continue to be used for
events of this sort: interactive, contemporary talks on the intersection
between lived sexualities and academic
discourse on sexuality."
Feminist Majority member Katie
Seville 'l2 spoke for the possibly more
skeptical members of the Swarthmore
movie-going audience. "We'll never
know how this'll go at Swat until we
try it, so we might as well," she said.

Rudo y Cursi
BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

Playing this past weekend at the Philly Film
Festival was the Mexican comedy "Rudo y
Cursi" directed by Carlos Cuaron. The film is
about two brothers who get caught up in the
world of professional soccer and consequently
have their lives turned upside-down by the
temptations and corruptions that come with
fame. The brothers go through very different
experiences but still end up equally corrupted.
Tato, nicknamed Cursi, (Gael Garcia Bernal)
gets signed to a wealthy team and is treated to
a life of luxury and fame. Meanwhile, Beto
(Diego Luna), nicknamed Rudo for his temper,
gets signed to a poor team and has to live a hard
life to keep playing soccer. Interestingly, in
spite of their differences, each brother gains
and then loses fame Cursi through living life
too extravagantly and Rudo through an addiction to gambling.
As much as "Rudo y Cursi" is about the pitfalls of fame, it is equally about how fame
affects the relationship between the brothers.
Tato is well-respected, gets paid well and lives
in luxury, while Beto is barely respected, gets
paid only when he plays and lives in relative
poverty. Although the two brothers' experiences with fame are very similar, Beto is still
treated with less respect because he is a goalie
while Tato is a striker, the stars in soccer
because they score goals. This jealously breaks
them apart, and the brothers can only reconcile
once their fame has gone.
The differences in the way that the two are
treated based on the positions they play on the
soccer pitch indicates the hierarchy of respect
embedded in the sport, in which, much like in
American football, the kicker is less-respected
than the quarterback even though both are
essential to the team. The film uses this hierarchy in soccer culture to engage in larger human
issues of morals and ethics. Throughout the
film, the agent and narrator, Batuta, (Guillermo
Francella) offers caveats about soccer that double as metaphors and allegories for life.
Because of this moralistic teaching, the film
is at once enlightening and tedious. The moralistic observations are thought-provoking touches, but they come up too often in the course of
the movie. Although I concede that many great
movies, such as "Almost Famous" and
"Amelie," thrive on narration as a storytelling
device, my issue with this movie is that there is
too much narration. I don't need to hear a soccer allegory every five minutes. I need to see
scenes that allow me to experience the trials
and tribulations of the film's characters, not
scenes that explicitly underline them. In one
scene, Tato is making love to his girlfriend, and
the narration tells a cute story about how handling a soccer ball is like handling a woman.
Now, this story may be briefly entertaining, but
it ultimately is just smoke and mirrors, as it
has nothing to do with the conclusion of the
film that fame corrupts people. The narration is
a flaw that doesn't allow the viewer the room to
fully experience the events of the film on their
own terms and come to their own conclusions
about the meaning of the story.
"Rudo y Cursi" certainly has its humorous
moments and makes for a reasonably pleasurable viewing experience. But be aware of the
many morals that are thrown around in the
film in an attempt to make the story more
meaningful than it should be.

BY ALEX ISRAEL

opening credits of Glenn
McQuaid's raucous, hilarious, violent
and frightening film "I Sell the Dead,"
which had its East Coast premiere at the
Philadelphia Film Festival last week, tell
you just about everything you need to
know about the film. The credits are artfully macabre and feature forbidding
The

ghouls. The images are a play on the
memento mori sensibility that pervades
this pitch-black comedy about two grave
robbers whose alternately humorous
and horrifying exploits provide the

film's narrative.
The film's framing device is a narrative by one of the grave robbers, Arthur
Blake (Dominic Monaghan of "Lost" and

occultist who shows a keen interest in
Arthur's history. Before long, the grave
robber's stories are flowing as freely as
the whiskey that Father Duffy brings
with him, and the fun of the film begins.
The center of the film is the relationship
between
Arthur and
his
partner/mentor Willy Grimes (Larry
Fessenden). Fessenden and Monaghan
have an easygoing comedic chemistry
that keeps even the most macabre
scenes grounded in some sort of reality.
The blend of high Gothic horror (in the
spirit of Shelley and Stoker) and easygoing humor is what keeps the film, as
well as our intrepid heroes, lively and
fun, even in the face of some truly
incredible obstacles. Those obstacles
include zombies, vampires and a very
nasty rival gang known as the House of
Murphy, which consists of Bulger
(Alisdair Stewart), a man whose teeth
have been replaced by those of a dog;
Valentine Kelly (Heather Bullock), a
woman who hides her burn-scarred face
behind a mask and only reveals it to
those she is about to kill; Cornelius
Murphy (John Speredakos), who as a
child killed and devoured his pet rabbit
to keep it away from his father; and
Samuel Murphy, the father, a figure so
terrifying that we never even see his
face. (Well, until the end of the film
but if I told you about that it would give
...

away two really wonderful twists, and I
refuse tq give away twists.)
The Murphy gang is a group of
vicious thugs, and their unpleasant
habits, ironically enough, provide some
of the funniest moments in the film.
The scene in which Arthur recounts the
rabbit-eating story comes with a series
of flashbacks to the event in question,
and I can tell you that you haven't really experienced black comedy until
you've laughed at the sight of an angelic child holding a dismembered bunny
whose blood is smeared all over his
face. The reveal of Valentine's face also
mines comic gold; instead of falling into
the Two-Face trap and showing the
audience some laughably fake burn
scars, McQuaid leaves Valentine's face
to our imaginations, instead allowing
Arthur and Willie's increasingly panicked expressions (and Fessenden and
Monaghan's fantastic comic timing) to
hint at the utter horror they are witnessing in a way that sent the entire
audience into fits of hilarity.
I've come back again to Fessenden
and Monaghan's chemistry and comic
timing, because that Chemistry is what
really sells the film. In the end, what
made the film memorable wasn't the
gothic horror or the zombies (although
both those elements were skillfully executed); it was Monaghan's charismatic
swagger, Fessenden's grumpy scowl, and
the way that those elements came together to create a comic twosome the likes of
which I haven't seen for quite some time.

Summer Hours
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

"Summer Hours," which had
but one measly screening at the
Philadelphia Film Festival, is
both a departure and a fitting
addition to the trajectory of
Olivier Assayas' film career.
Like the globetrotting "Irma
Vep," "demonlover," "Clean,"
and "Boarding Gate," Assayas'
latest film can be considered yet
another treatise on globalization
and the cheapening of human
relations in a capitalist existence. What "Summer Hours"
adds to the mix is a tempered
appreciation for the ailing legacy
of family and past tradition.
Never

leaving

Assayas'

native France, "Summer Hours"
observes three 40-something siblings as they decide what to do
with the majestic country home
of their recently deceased mother Helene (a vibrant Edith Scob)
as well as her vast collection of
art nouveau pieces. The film
opens with the last of the extended family's annual summer gettogethers at Helene's home. Hugs
and smiles are generous in this
bucolic paradise, but it quickly
becomes clear that the members
of this reunion are all living very
separate lives. Frederic (Charles
Berling) is the only one of the
three who remains in Paris with

THE PHOENIX

a family. Adrienne (Juliette
Binoche), the free spirit of the
three, is a designer who splits

her time between the U.S. and

Japan. Jeremie (Jeremie Renier)
is a businessman preparing his
family for a permanent move to
China for his work.
Like any good French filmmaker (Assayas once wrote for
the "Cahiers du Cinema" as
Truffaut and Godard once did),
Assayas places the meaning of
the film not in any emphatic plot
points, but in between the lines,
so to speak. Frederic, Adrienne
and Jeremie's gift to their mothimmediately
er a cell phone
illuminates the generational gap
that is at the core of the film.
Later,
when Frederic and
Adrienne revisit their mother's
house to prepare its various
pieces of art for transfer to a
museum, a long tracking shot
boldly follows the former housekeeper Elo'ise (Isabelle Sadoyan),
up-until-now a background figure, as she returns to the house
unannounced and takes one of
the vases out of its bubble wrap
to house the flowers that she's
brought. The virtuosic sequence
-

breathlessly (and wordlessly)
posits that art is best appreciated
as a part of one's daily life rather
than embalmed in exhibition.
And the point is made all the
more poignant when Frederic

and his wife later visit the same
vase, antiseptically displayed in
a museum.
Far less heady than, say,
"demonlover'"s ambition (or perhaps pretension) to bridge the
disparity between cinema and
new media, "Summer Hours"
feels downright old-fashioned.
There's little self-reflexivity or
hip homage to be seen here. The
film is unabashedly ingenuous
and even has moments where its
characters softly break down
into tears and the picture fades
out. In an interview with "Time
Out London," Assayas said that
the film "has taken me into areas
that are very interesting for me.
I was in a cinema, debating with
the audience in a provincial
French town. Those people didn't want to know about cinema,
about modernity, about narrative or whatever they wanted
to discuss the issues in the film
and how the characters react or
don't react.... All of a sudden, I'm
exactly where I've always wanted to be as a director: having a
straightforward

between the siblings, between
Helene and Frederic, between
Frederic and his own daughter.
It's candid talk that anyone can
relate to as they speak to those
universal
familial
bonds.
Reflecting real life, the dialogue
of the film is often insipid. A conversation at the reunion about
the economy doesn't get more
illuminating than "America benefits the most." Most interesting
are the layers of cordiality, formality and pragmatism that
color the dialogue in a scene,
after the funeral, when the siblings must decide whether to
keep or to sell their mother's

house. Both Adrienne and
Jeremie manage after some courtesy gum chewing to acknowledge that they are living their
own lives and the house no
longer matters to them.
The film's amusing ending, a
coda to its opening, returns to

the country house, this time
with Frederic's daughter, and is
a way for "Summer Hours" to
come to terms with the loss of
generational history, like the
cycle of seasons. "Summer
decepHours" is a quiet piece
tively simple, but as thought provoking and inquisitive as any of
Assay as' recent films.

relationship

with an audience who have
reacted directly to the story I'm
telling."
It's no wonder that Assayas
finds his audience wanting to
continue the conversation of his
film. "Summer Hours" is largely
made up of everyday talk talk

Rejudging

BY MICHAEL GLUK

mglukl@swarthmore.edu
Before "12 Angry Men" went
into production, directors Dustin

Trabert 'lO and James Robinson
'lO sat each actor down individually to ask a series of questions
about their characters, the

answers to which could not be
found directly in the script.
"Essentially," Trabert said, "we
were asking who each character
is and the actors would fill in the
blanks." The unusually character-driven nature of the play
demanded just such an unusual
directing approach. The entirety
of "12 Angry Men," written by
Reginald Rose, takes place in a
single jury deliberation room as a
lone dissenter tries to convince
the eleven-member majority to
reverse its guilty verdict on the

grounds of reasonable doubt.
Such a set up means that the

action of the play is impelled by
individual charactersrather than
by
external circumstances.
Trabert continued, "It's a play
about democracy and the political process and exclusion, but it's
more about characters than politics. It's really about the interplay
between different individuals."
All 12 characters remain on
stage throughout the entire play,
resulting in a "big ensemble piece
without any star roles," Robinson
said. This aspect of the script has
fostered particularly strong relationships between the play's cast
members, as each member must
be present throughout the entirety of each thrice-weekly rehearsal. Hopefully, this closeness will
manifest in particularly developed and realistic dynamics

'12

Angry

between actors during the production. "So few plays are written like this, where all actors are
on stage at all times," Jessica
Schleider 'l2, a cast members,
said. "It really forces you to know
every character and everyone's
backgrounds and what is going
into the play at all times."
The attention to character
makes the play well suited to its
directors. As Robinson explained,
"We're both in a lot of ways
actors by trade. Theater is really
an actor's medium more than a
director's medium. It's a director's job to give directions to the

actors, to make sure thatthe play
coheres." Trabert said, "Twelve
people approaching the same
script [are] not going to approach
it the same way. We need to make
sure everything fits together."
Perhaps the most interesting
challenge involved in the production of this

play is the issue of gender. As its

title might suggest, "12 Angry
Men" was written for and origi-

nally performed exclusively by
men in the script's initial 1957
motion
picture
debut.
Swarthmore's performance of the
play will defy this convention by
making the play gendered, featuring both male and female actors

characters of their gender. "At least for me, the choice to
use actresses was a very deliberate one," Robinson said. "We
wanted to make the play ours."

playing

Including both genders adds
the entirely new aspect of gender
dynamics to the play. "Really, the
gendered characters translated

unexpectedly well into the play.
There was no real need to rework
the script," Schleider said. The
production adheres almost exactly to the original script, altering
only words that denote a specific
gender. On the play's inclu ci of
both genders, actor Will

several patronizing lines about
women in the play and those are
all the more important now that
we have women on the stage."
Sarah Chasins 'l2 added, "It's
interesting going back to the
19505, when women wouldn't
have been doing the things
they're doing in this show." The
inclusion of both genders provides a modern perspective on
this classic script.

who subsists entirely on Dr. Pepper and
pizza and can't leave her apartment.
The play opens when Bo (Kaci M.
Fannin), a versatile thief, breaks into Ata's
apartment only to find that everything in
the apartment has already been lifted, with
the exception of the mattress and Ata's
large supply of old pizza boxes and soda
cans. The one who is truly in a fix, however, is not Ata: it's 80. Ata suffers from a
very literal interpretation of 'freezing'
under pressure, so when she manages to
wrestle Bo's gun away, her hand promptly
locks down and will not let go of the gun.
Her unstable antics (and finger hovering
over the trigger) force Bo into a corner, but
Ata eventually releases her, having bonded during the high-pressure situation. The
next time Bo is robbing an apartment in
Ata's building, she swings by to ask for her
gun back, only to find that Ata hasn't let go
of it yet. Unable to pry the gun away from
Ata, Bo is delayed on the job and her partner Robbie (Damon Bonetti) bursts in to

see what's up. Robbie sees the potential for
collaboration with Ata; Bo and Robbie
want the stuff that they were expecting to
steal from Ata and Ata wants revenge on
her sleazy husband Wib (Lenny Haas).
The action of the play happens in Ata's
apartment and the story is driven by Ata's
troubles
and
her neuroses,
so
'

Eisenhower's performance is understandably at the core of the show's success or
failure. Eisenhower has solid comedic timing, ertough facial expressions to keep
things thoroughly entertaining, and the
ability to charm with traits that would be
gratingly annoying on anyone else.
On the page, Ata isn't the only character with the potential to get on your
nerves. All four characters are composites
of recognizable personality types and the
obnoxious, obscene and stupid. The comedy here stems from the absurdity of the
people, not from the ridiculous plot. In fact,
the Walnut Street's production is more
about a bunch of kooky characters than it
is about the story, the bonding experience
between two women negotiating the desire
to trust one another in a world that doesn't

reward such decisions.
Relying on the individual abilities of
the actors was the right decision for director Madi DiStefano. The script isn't partic-

ularly crafty beyond its characterizations,
and the situational farce could very easily

bomb. When Ata makes her dramatic exit
from a fight with Wib into the closet

(where Robbie is hiding) instead of out the
door, we could be watching any number of
plays. The story has nothing new to offer

to audiences, no quirky twists or subversive alterations, and the play is very talky.

April 9, 2009

The play could've been written by a high
school student, albeit one with an excellent
vocabulary
Ata's words would be at
home in an SAT prep book.
What no high school student could do,
however, is make the very limited space of
the Independence Studio as vibrant and
lively as this cast of misfits does. The lights
haven't even come up on the scene when
Bo and Ata kick into gear, and the first half
is pure pep. After the intermission, the
play loses momentum
a feature of the
writing, not the individual performances
boosted only by the arrival of Ata's husband Wib, complete with orange self-tanner, country club attitude, and a grin that
could induce nausea. Haas' performance
as Wib is fun and fresh, but it isn't enough
to bring the second act up to par.
Playwright Jane Martin, if that is

indeed

his/her name

(there is

some

debate), made it simply impossible for
even the best performers and directors to
keep the second act going strong. The end
of the play sags with the weight of sudden
humanity, overestimating the power Of the
sincerity when the audience has spent the
past hour and a half learning to love everything sordid and ludicrous.
The Walnut Street Theatre production
of "Criminal Hearts" runs through April
19.

or
Holy Week,
the week leading up to Easter. This column
details the first half of my travels to Poland

and the Czech Republic.
Liverpool, England
We begin our journey in an overnight
layover, sleeping in shifts at the airport in
order to best fend off moochers from our
prime carpeted sleeping spot next to a
slightly creepy John Lennon statue. I wake
up to the horrified expression of my friend
Patty, who informs me that I had punched
her when she tried to shrug my head off
her shoulder during the night.

Wroclaw, Poland
After falling asleep on a very understanding Irish man, I arrive in a city that
honestly looks like it should be edible. In
the Old City, we are surrounded by rainbow sherbet houses With ridiculously high
peaked roofs and a gorgeous university
established in the 1500s. To add to the preciousness, the city boasts 15 hidden
gnomes. My favorite place is Marii
Magdaleny Church, which has a Lego-like
red and green checkered roof and a Bridge
of Penance that we huffed up ten flights Of
flimsy metal stairs to get to, only to be
bludgeoned by pigeons.

Krakow, Poland
Krakow, like the rest of Poland, is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic and the birthplace of Pope John Paul 11. The entire city
is turned out for Easter. I mean, even the
Dunkin' Donuts has adorable pink bunny
doughnuts and stores display elaborate
Easter egg trees in their windows. We
stumble on churches and cathedrals at
every other corner and wolf down pierogies with a priest on one side and two nuns
on the other. My friend Patty spent a good
five minutes in the old Market Square
two,
delightedly counting, "One nun

Spanish jamon a run for its money. At the
Easter Market, I purchased a cut of ham
cooked slowly over hot coals. Despite the
fact that the ham was roughly 2 inches
thick, I proceeded to eat it with a quickness
that laid wasteto many a plastic spork.
It is also here that we discover that
Czech, like Polish, is pretty much impossible to puzzle out and even harder to pronounce due to the most arbitrary pairings
of multiple consonants. For example, my
favorite dessert, a chewy, piping hot roil
with vanilla, cinnamon and caramel, is the
trdlnik. Unfortunately, the deliciousness of
the dessert has an inverse relationship to
the number of vowels in the name. Luckily,
I quickly mastered the word for marzipan
and spent the rest of my time here eating
my way through a menagerie of marzipan

animals.
So far, what I really noted here is the
absolute quiet in the city. Spaniards are
loud, and I am used to being greeted by a
dull roar when I enter a bar or a restaurant. The gentle murmuring I hear just
throws me off and I almost miss having
someone roaring into my ear at any given
moment.

Whether it was spending an afternoon
in Wenceslas Square (provoking a rousing
and off-tune chorus of the namesake's
song), where the people flooded for two
weeks in 1989 to oust the communists, or
walking along the Charles Bridge on the
Coronation Path of the Czech kings, it was
easy to feel like I was several centuries
back in time. That is, until someone tries to
sell me the furry weasel toy chasing a plastic ball that is inexplicably popular here.
Carlsbad, Poland
At Carlsbad, we spent the afternoon in a
surreal Disneyland-like resort town while
sipping mineral water from tiny porcelain
cups dipped into the 14 hot springs in a
Wonderland-esque fashion. After only
slightly faltering at a particularly foulsmelling spring, our brave efforts are

rewarded with hot water with varying
degrees of cabbagey-ness. So far, no effects
reported from imbibing the water, except

extreme discomfort on the two-hour bus

ride back into Prague.
For the next week or so, I am traipsing
off to Hungary and Austria, and finishing
up in Italy in time for Easter. Yes. Italy, the
Catholic Spiritual Center. Easter, the holiest day of the year. We are idiots. Barring
death by Catholic mob trampling, ta luego!

industry,
particularly in

regards to high fashion. Many

consider
this to be a problem because they believe
men to have distorted views about
women and women's bodies, and that the
height and weight conditions for models
lead to unrealistic expectations for the
everyday woman. It does seem to be the
case that female designers, such as
Betsey Johnson, tend to have curvier
models than male designers like Calvin
Klein. But given the male dominance of
the industry, waifish frames seem to
always be in fashion.
But if there is a problem with men
designing women's clothing, then what
about men designing for men? Don't the
same unattainable calls for physical perfection apply? Well yes, but perhaps to a
lesser degree. Because a typical
menswear runway show is comprised
mostly of suits, and suits by nature are
designed and tailored to compliment the
body, men's fashion appears to be
empowering. A good suit can make bodily imperfections unnoticeable, but the
assortment of dresses, skirts, etc. that
women wear on the catwalk are more
prone to variation. Because women's
wear tends to be more conceptual or
artistic, the usual considerations for flattering fits may be sacrificed in maintaining the overall "vision" of the collection.
Ideally, women should want to wear such
clothing, but designers usually do not
have the goal of making collections that
sell commodity comes second to art.
Still, there are men designing for
menswear who produce collections that
bend the traditional gender norms of
dress. This does not mean that they send
men down the runway in dresses; the

Prague, Czech Republic
Prague is divided into Stare Mesto, the
Old Town, with its enormous Old Town
Square, and the glitizier Nove M sto. or
New Town. We chose to spend most of our
time gawping at the ridiculously ornate
buildings clustered around Old Town.

effect is a more androgynous, or a feminine take on menswear. European
designers seem much more comfortable
doing this than do American ones, it is
possible that it is a matter of difference
in culture. The designers who experiment the most with de-masculinizing
menswear, however, also happen to be
the ones who have more androgynous
women's wear. For example, Jil Sander's
Fall 2009 women's collection (below) contained minimahstpower suits and dresses that empowered rather than sexualized the female body. Raf Simons, the
designer for the collection, also has his
own mertswear label. His Fall 2009 collection (above) for that label started off with
traditional suits, but then became
increasingly more ambiguous. Suits
with sloped shoulders worn under
corset-like tops and cinched waistcoats
exaggerated proportions of the body. Jil
Sander's Fall 2009 menswear collection

was even closer to the shapes seen in the
women's wear collection. Most of the
coats were structured to exaggerate an
hourglass figure, and looked like the
item could have been part of the
women's wear collection. Viewing the
collections side by side, one has to wonder, is it possible to completely blur the
line between male and female fashion?
If it is possible, then it seems to only
be happening with designers who have
the same or similar visions for both collections, and the number of these designers is still very low. For those who critique the idea of men making women's
fashion, it is important to take note that
menswear adheres much more strictly to
gender norms than does women's wear.
The patterns, materials and colors may
change, but the basic structure of any
collection still relies on suits. The
greater likelihood of masculine or
androgynous women's wear also seems
to either be a reflection of or an influence
on the fact that women wearing "men's"
clothing is Common practice in everyday
life. Boyfriend jeans, blazers, button
downs and pantsuits are all testament to
this socially accepted notion. Obviously
this does hot mean that the fashion

thoughts.

I was told this countless
times, from a small army

of OCD specialists, and
yet each time I heard a
clinical variation of the
teacher's dialogue from
old Charlie Brown cartoons, wa-wa-wa-wa.
Our culture perpetuates the myth of psychiatric treatment as a
malevolent conspiracy
that eliminates individuality and leaves the
patient in a state of idiot
narcotic bliss. Forgive
me for saying so, but that
sounds fantastic. Please,
I told my new psychia-

these evil magic drugs
that will turn me into an
unfeeling plastic conformist robot, because I
have experienced the
alternative and if given
the choice, I will now take
the blue pills over the red
ones without hesitation
or regret. I begged each
professional to electrocute my brain or to saw
open my skull and take
out the naughty bits, but
each time I was denied.
Sadly, no amount of psychiatric
intervention
would transform me into
corporation-conthe
trolled joy-robot of my
dreams. It was my new
therapist, an extremely
practical
warm
and
woman, who explained
how I could make myself
well: through self-administered psychological torture.
Exposure
Response
Prevention therapy operates on the principle that

each obsession is fueled

by irrational but genuine
terror, triggered by the
hyperawareness of the

risks and uncertainties of
everyday life. To protect
ourselves, we construct
elaborate, ever-convoluted ritual behaviors: handwashing to neutralize disease and prayer to stave
off damnation, unending
silent vigilance to ward
off troubling thoughts.
But these rituals can
never completely eliminate the uncertainty that
drives the obsession, and
the sufferer becomes
increasingly

desperate.

The only alternative is to
face the fear without protective ritual, naked and
alone, and to learn to
exist despite the terror of
complete vulnerability.
Eventually, the sufferer
habituates to the anxiety

and can survive uncertainty without resorting
to obsession.
Having been pushed,
filed, stamped, indexed,
briefed, debriefed and

numbered, I was finally
admitted to McLean's
hospital's OCD Institute

enroll, overwrite years of

painstakingly-constructed maladaptive neurological programming in about
ten days, maybe stand
sobbing in the rain symbolically baptized, and
return to Swarthmore
utterly sane in time to
purloin a "Welcome Class

Alumni' Office. It soon
became apparent, however, that I required more
extensive treatment. I
learned I would be unable
to return to Swarthmore
that fall. Twitching on
the hospital's lawn, I
fibbed my way through
phone conversations with
concerned friends; early
on I had panicked and
blurted out to a friend
that I was taking a semester off for treatment of
"stomach problems." I
immediately wished I
could retcon my alibi (a
friend on the unit recommended "family issues")

academia is a world of privilege. For millions of Americans,
working to the point of exhaustion is a necessity, especially
given recent developments, which leads me to ask the question. For all the work that we do, how are we benefitting the
world? With all the unrealistic piles of work that we're
assigned, it seems as if we're all too busy to answer the really
important questions.

Civic education is essential to ensure that people
don't instinctively oppose or support policies on the
basis of their personal values that they might feel differently about if they knew more.
Recognizing the importance of values matters
because it helps us understand and sympathize with
the arguments of others, even when those arguments
conflict with our own notions. Understanding the values of other people can also help us recognize what
and
arguments that people may be receptive to
what arguments that they may be unlikely to respond
to.

I'm not saying we're going to easily fix our political culture of talking heads yelling past one another. I
do believe, however, that failure to recognize different
not to even to go so far as to tolerate, which
values
is a different and much harder matter, but simply to
recognize other values' existence and importance
makes it much more difficult to engage in productive
political debate.
And debate is something we need a lot of. These
things are pretty complicated.

Committing to a standardized writing requirement
Swarthmore has a tradition of graduating great writers. Indeed, academic writing is a skill that is emphasized in the curriculum, and students are given a wide
range of resources on campus to nurture their writing
abilities. The primary method through which the
school ensures every student graduates at least as a
competent and coherent writer is through the writing
requirement, which advises that students complete
three W-designated courses by the end of sophomore
year.

This aspect of the Swarthmore curriculum is one of
the several that distinguish us from other schools, and
it is easy to see the potential benefits of such an endeavor. Writing is a necessary skill for any student, from the
honors Biology student constructing a lab report to the
Philosophy major penning another dissertation.
However, students have consistently noted that
some W-designated courses do not focus on improving
writing skills nearly as much as other W-designated
courses
or even non-W courses
do. The current
method of determining which classes count as W courses results in vast disparities across the board.
If the college is committed to ensuring a writing
requirement system that results in student entering
junior year knowing how to effectively write an academic paper, then the curriculum requirements of W
courses, which are mostly solid in principle, must be
consistently upheld. And for the arguably weaker parts
of the writing requirement system, a more rigorous
evaluation of what constitutes a writing course is necessary.

According to the Swarthmore website, in order to
receive W-designation, a course has to fulfill three
requirements. First, writing classes must mandate
"twenty pages of analytic writing per semester."
Second, they must "pay explicit attention to helping students develop, compose, organize, revise and edit analytic prose." Finally, they must allow students to "use
feedback" to revise their writing. Unfortunately, these
listed criteria are not always followed in the classroom.
or for
Frankly, they are too vague to give professors
that matter, students
a clear idea of what, exactly, a
W course entails.

The most obvious criticism of the Writing Course
designation is that many Writing Courses do not
demand the 20 pages of writing they are supposed to.
This is a problem that, for whatever reason, has not
been rectified by the semester-end student evaluations.
The school is right in requiring that every Writing
Course have a very significant writing component
after all, effective writing only comes about through
practice. What is commendable in theory only becomes
problematic when students are not actually required to
fulfill the 20-page requirement in their W courses.
Yet this is exactly what is happening: students, many
of whom have taken writing courses in a variety of different disciplines, are not being asked to fulfill one of
the explicitly defined tenets of a W course. Though
some may argue that the page requirement is an arbitrary standard that does not necessarily reflect writing
growth, it is nevertheless a standard. And standards
must be adhered to if W-designation is to mean anything. To that end, the Curriculum Committee must do
a better job of ensuring that each listed writing course
meets the page requirements standards.
The second aspect of Writing Courses is that they
have professors who take time out of their regular lessons to actively teach discipline-specific writing skills.
There are certainly a number of professors of Writing
Courses who do just this. But there are also a large percentage of writing courses whose professors do not
actively teach writing skills to the students. Nor do the
professors at least utilize the Writing Associates and
the writing experience they offer that may be available
to attach to a course.
It is doubtful that any professors are purposefully
violating this precept. It is the standards that need to be
made clearer. What exactly does the Curriculum
Committee mean by "payfing] explicit attention to helping students develop [and] compose ... analytic prose"?
Does it intend professors of Writing Courses to give regular lessons on writing and grammar, as some professors of Writing Courses have opted to do? Or does the
Committee intend professors to make casual remarks
about writing only when student essays are handed
back? Both approaches are defensible, and both

approaches are practiced. In fact, both approaches can
be quite effective. But without explicit direction, the
Committee's words leave room for neither approach to
be taken, and that is where the problems begin. Thus, it
is imperative that a course that "helps" students write
analytic prose knows exactly what "help" means.
The final requirement of W courses is that they
"must have students use feedback to revise their writing." But feedback has multiple meanings. Feedback
could mean anything from a few jotted notes on the
back of the paper to a one-on-one conference with the
professor. Professors of W courses regularly opt for
both strategies. In fact, professors of non-W courses regularly opt for both strategies. Delineation, then, is needed to justify this separate writing requirement and
ensure that the requirements are in fact met.
It seems problematic that professors of W courses
are not required to do anything more specific than
"give [students] feedback to revise their writing." As it
turns out, professors of non-W courses often impose
more stringent writing requirements, and give more
detailed feedback, than professors of W courses.
There are a number of simple strategies that could
rectify this. Professors of W courses should be explicitly required to meet individually with students to go
over their papers, or, if the class is too big, students
meet with a WA to go over the professor's feedback on
the paper. Otherwise, why establish a separate W
course system?
If students are required to fulfill a set writing
requirement, if students are required to take courses
they otherwise would not, then it is imperative that the
"W" designation actually mean something. The 20
pages must be written. Professors must go over student
writing in a painstaking fashion. Further, it is essential
that professors do take special efforts to communicate
feedback on writing.
Swarthmore has established a system that is in the
best interests of student development, and the college
takes student writing very seriously. But in order for
principles to translate to results, Swarthmore must
take the student writing requirements very seriously
also.

programs

for largescale conventional wars and emphasizing counterterrorism technologies.
Although the budget is a significant
step away from outdated defense paradigms, it would probably maintain current overall spending levels through its
new programs and increases in Army
and Marine Corps personnel. And while
I strongly believe that we need to shrink
defense spending in favor of wiser
domestic investments, Gates is to be
commended for his efforts to cut inefficiencies and Cold War anachronisms
out of the budget, and Congress should
embrace his proposals.
But first, a little perspective. Defense
spending is the behemoth of the discretionary federal budget. Although actual
accounting varies, a conservative estimate puts the figure around $527 billion.
To rattle off a few well-worn but telling

16

figures: the U.S. is responsible for
almost half of the world's military
expenditures; the next biggest NATO
spender is Britain at $6O billion; for context, the development of our F-22 fighter
jet was $65 billion alone.
These figures alone, however, do not
paint a full portrait of our swollen, misguided spending. One must also consider that the wars we face are not the type
that involves dogfighting jet aircraft
and missile-to-missile deflection systems. In Iraq, six weeks of "shock and
awe" wrought by tanks, carriers, missiles, aircraft and mechanized infantry
quickly gave way to six years and counting of foot patrols through bazaars and
Humvee rides around Baghdad.
Gates recognized these trends at the
hearing on Monday, but his budget only
responds in part to these recognitions.
He plans to finish purchasing F-22s in a
few years, but still plans to buy thousands of Joint Strike Fighters, a model
still under development.
The reality is that supersonic jets
and high-tech bombs have largely exacerbated already high levels of antiAmerican sentiment and swelled the
ranks of insurgent groups. "Smart"
bombs have been all too often stupefied
by malfunction or dubious "intelli-

gence."

On the other hand, the roundly
praised "surge" strategy that has been
credited with staving off total failure in
Iraq was almost archaic in nature.
Caesar could have devised it to quell an

unruly Gallic village. If U.S. and British
forces ever prevail in Iraq, it will be
thanks to such low-tech (and relatively
low-cost) initiatives like special training for troops to build partnerships with
Baghdad community leaders and the
uninspiring but effective strategy of
pacifying troublemakers by putting
them on the government payroll.
In other words, we could slash all
sorts of programs in the defense budget
and our military campaigns would not
suffer, nor would our troops lack firepower or logistical support. We would
still be able to "project influence"
around the globe. New weapons technologies would still be developed, but at
a slower pace.
And perhaps we would have to make
do without certain pieces of equipment
designed to fulfill extremely narrow
combat roles, such as a type of small
tank that can fit two-to-a-plane and be

actually downsized the Army's sensornetworked "Future Combat Systems"
program, which judging by an artist's
rendering means that we would be
granted a brief reprieve from "Attack of

For many Americans our military
spending is linked to our preeminence
as a global power; it is the rock that
props up our eagle-perch. In their eyes
any reduction or restructuring of the
defense budget would spell the end of
the American Era. This is a simplistic
understanding of American power, and

April 9, 2009

it is somewhat akin to the spending spiral that some say precipitated the Soviet
Union's demise.
If these people are right about anything then they only sense what lots of
people already know, which is that the
U.S. certainly is not as powerful as it
once was. So let's not chase the ghosts of
past glory.
And of course, the most serious
obstacle to a reduced or restructured
defense budget is our entrenched military-industrial complex. This hurdle
has only grown as a result of our economic woes. Beyond all of the pressure
from lobbyists and campaign contributions from corporations, each defense
contract translates into a certain number of jobs, and it is not unusual for a
single program to employ workers in
states
to
ensure
forty
or
so
Congressional support.
All told, it will take a truly
Herculean effort on the part of the
Obama administration to convince
Congress that the military's need to
remake itself is more important that a
handful of manufacturing contracts.
In this respect, an overall decrease in
defense spending could actually help
ease Gates' budget through Congress, as
money freed up from defense could be
used for infrastructure, education and
other stimulus projects. Hopefully,
defense budgets will take that tack in
the future.

League sea-

son. It was
a dual celeb rat ion:

in the 2008 World Series victory as well
as the start of 2009.
While it was exhilarating to be there
when the defending champions were
introduced, the game left a lot to be
desired, as the champs fell behind early
and never really mustered any sort of
offense.
In fact, by the second inning (that is,
two innings after the Phillies won the
World Series), the fans were booing.
Brett Myers was harangued with the
usual spousal abuse jeers as he surrendered homer after homer, Ryan
Howard's new supersized contract was
mocked as he struck out twice, and
there were a lot of anguished faces in
the seats around me.
I really thought that winning a World
Series would win at least a week, perhaps a month, of mercy for the Phils.
Even in a city that cherishes its reputation for giving athletes a tough time,
I expected the championship to alter
the dynamic a bit, at least for a little
while.

Shows what I know.
Beer is still beer, and the Eagles still
haven't won a Super Bowl, so I guess
it's safe to assume that Philadelphia
fans will continue to be generally
pissed off and vocal about it.
But for me, even that cipher of a
game couldn't blot out the wonderful
truth: baseball is back.
There's nothing better than being a
baseball fan. For seven months, there's
daily drama.
While football fans stew over their
games for a whole week (sometimes
two), baseball fans only have to wait for
the next day.
When your team suffers a devastating loss, the next game can't come soon
enough.

When they pull out a good win, you
want nothing more than to see them
back out there again. Baseball indulges
that impatience.
Here are some key storylines that
should be fun to watch unfold over the
next seven months, one day at a time.

watching the other three powers duke it
out could be quite a show come late

summer.
The NL East has been all about MetsPhillies the last three years, but the
recharged Braves, though overlooked,

could disrupt that storyline in 2009. The
Braves' revamped rotation, the Mets'
greatly improved bullpen, the Phillies'
beautiful new banner and the Marlins'
Hanley Ramirez should provide great
drama through September.

Surprises out West
In both leagues, Los Angeles is the
too-easy pick to win the division
(Angels in the AL, Dodgers in the NL).

Beasts in the East
In both the American and National
Leagues, the East divisions are deep
and potentially dominant. In the AL,
this is old news to some degree.
The Yankees and Red Sox have long
been two of the best teams in baseball.
But the emergence of the Rays and the
quiet competence of the Blue Jays make
this one of the best divisions we've ever
seen.
Throw in the Orioles' impressive
crop of rising stars, and the AL East is
downright scary. Ultimately, it's hard
to imagine the Orioles or Blue Jays factoring into the playoff picture, but

new power out West.
It may be a bit early, but 2009 could
be the beginning of the Rangers' reign.
In the NL, the Dodgers need to look
out for the Diamondbacks, whose group
of young hitters has been ready to
explode for two years.
If Chris Young, Mark Reynolds,
Stephen Drew and friends put it together, they could dominate that division.

There are also some fun microplots.
After an inspiring second half of 2008
with the Brewers, C.C. Sabathia is now
the latest installment of the Yankees'
search for a true ace.

The final tally was 8-3

While the Garnet was

coach
Stan
Exeter said that "we'll
know better by the end of

On the whole, however,
a bright spot for the

lower than
McDaniel's and good for
seventh in the conference.
"We've faced better
pitching
[in
the
Centennial Conference],"
Koshkin explained, "but
to an extent, the opponents' hitting has not
been as good."
The team still lacks a
fourth starter, however,
and recently the team has
opted for a pitcher-bycommittee strategy.
In the second game
against Johns Hopkins,
nine pitchers saw action,
none for more than two
innings.

A similar tactic was

employed

against

Haverford,
when six
pitchers took the mound,
all for under two innings.
Koshkin said he does not
know if this will be the
long-term solution. "It
easily could be," he said.
"We don't have a set
fourth starter."

however,

Exeter,

is

not keen on settling into
such a strategy, pointing
out that the tactic is "not
a solution" to the lack of
a fourth starter.
For now, though, there
are no other options.

"This is where we are

right now," Exeter added.

Garnet wants to avoid a

The 2008 team entered

three games in the conference.
This year the team
started the season 8-8, but
has gone 0-8 in the first

"The

An old Bruins fan reflects on his tenure with hockey
swarthmorephoenix.com

,

I haven't written a
whole lot about the NHL
in recent years for a few
reasons, the main one
being the lack of popularity of professional hockey
among the campus body.
However, my hometown's Boston Bruins
recently clinched the first
seed in this year's playoffs, a feat I'm not sure I
had ever personally witnessed.
I wanted to write about

Kevin Friedenberg
Get Down With
Your Bad Self

m

hockey

because

specifically
watching the

Bruins surge into first

place in the Eastern Conference this year has made me
reflect on my own experiences with hockey.
The Bruins' epic season made me think of their
years of yore (some more fondly than others).
Hockey holds a particular place in my heart.
Growing up, I played hockey from the time I was about
three until my sophomore year of high school. I remember getting up at the crack of dawn with my parents for
practice in ±he early years. It's hard not to be nostalgic
when I think about all the Bruins games I went to as a

child.

I remember one day, I wished to be like them and
wear that black and gold sweater with the spoked "B"
on the front. Since I began following hockey years and
years ago through my idols Adam Oates and Ray
Bourque, I have seen a lot of changes in the game.
Aside from just the rule changes that were implemented as a result of the lockout a few years back, I also
have been around the game long enough to watch many
players blossom and fade over time. I have seen trends
shift from overseas talent to North American talentand
back and forth again. I remember that a few years
before the lockout, when there seemed to be a change in
professional hockey opinion, speedy, younger players
were growing to become preferable to older (yet more
experienced) players.
There is nothing comparable to watching hockey.
My coaches used to say that hockey was the fastest
game on two legs, and my father has said that of all the
sports my sister and I played growing up, he liked hockey the most because of the speed.
As a local Bostonian, it was clear that my affinity lay
with the Bs. I had the privilege of watching a Bruins
game this year on Black Friday, and I have to say that
the place was electric.
The arena that theBruins play in (now called the TD
Banknorth Garden) is the benchmark by which I measure other sporting arenas. Sorry, Wachovia Center
you den't stack up.
Even when the Bruins were having less than stellar

seasons, I remember being at games and thinking the
noise in that arena was going to bring the roof down. I
can't think of any other hockey arena in the country
that is as intense as the Garden. The building itself is
packed to the gills with history: Stanley Cup wins,
Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, John Bucyk, Eddie Shore and
Terry O'Reilly, just to name a few.
What makes the Bruins playoff seed particularly
special to me this year is the fact that I have supported
these guys in years that were absolutely brutal for them
(believe me, they happened, and not even that long ago).
I remember before the season started, when there was a
lot of buzz and optimism surrounding this year's squad,
and I thought to myself that I wouldn't count those
chickens before they hatched.
However, to my delight, theBruins played an incredible season. Through a lot of young talent and stingy
goalkeeping, theBruins have made a magical run that I
can only hope takes them deep into the playoffs. In my
never-ending quest to make people better sports fans, I
urge them to look on the example of the Bruins.
Observe how a team can fluctuate from decent years
to terrible ones (and to the occasional stunning ones),
and take note that even if your particular team is in a
drought, it only takes one year to turn things around.
And for goodness sake, people, start watching
hockey!

6-6 with the win.
On Sunday, April 5, Swarthmore fell to
Johns Hopkins University (6-3, 4-0 CC) in
their only Centennial Conference loss
thus far, by a final score of 7-2.
The Blue Jays are ranked #l3 nationally, and although the final result seems to
indicate a decisive Hopkins win, many of
the matches were close.
Additionally, Swarthmore did garner a
few notable individual wins. Zak Kelm 'l2
continued a personal winning streak, taking down Hopkins freshman Warren
Elgort in three sets.
Kelm, along with his doubles partner
Kevin Shaughnessy 'O9, were victorious at
No. 1 doubles over Hopkins' second-ranked
All-American doubles pair of David
Maldow and Andrew Wang, coming away
with the upset and a final score of 8-4.
Hopkins aside, the Garnet has been
making easy work of its other Centennial
Conference opponents.

In singles play, Stephen Youngblood 'l2

On the road on Saturday, Swarthmore
defeated the Gettysburg College Bullets in
an 8-1 contest, despite less-than-favorable
conditions.
With 40 to 50 mph gusts interspersed
amongst a constant 30 mph wind, finding a
rhythm was a challenge for both squads.
"For most of the team, it was the windiest conditions we had ever played in," said
Shaughnessy.
Despite the weather, Garnet victories
were certainly not in short supply that
Saturday. Mark Wee 'll secured a victory

in three sets during singles play, along with
four of his teammates. Swarthmore swept

sophomore Adam Cranford, 6-7, 6-3,14-12.
But Swarthmore was able to win the
match on the strength of the doubles victories, combined with singles victories by
Shaughnessy, Kelm, Mark Greenburg 'O9 and
J J England 'O9.
Kelm's victory on Tuesday was his fifth
singles victory in Centennial Conference
matches this year, boosting his in-conference record to 5-0.
Playing at No. 3 singles for the Garnet,
Kelm's success is a testament to the depth of
the Swarthmore squad.
Having such consistency at third-singles
indicates Swarthmore's ability to field several top-level players, while other squads
may have to go to second string behind their
No. 1 and No. 2 standouts.
Looking ahead, the team continues to set
its sights on a Conference playoff bid. "As a
team, we are very confident right now,"
Shaughnessy said, adding that the Garnet
are "looking forward to playing Haverford
next week."
One area the team and head coach Mike
Mullan have focused on recently is doubles
play. "Winning all of the doubles or even two
out of the three matches really provides
momentum going into singles play," continued Shaughnessy, who noted that coaching
doubles is an area of expertise for Mullan.

Mullan has coached the Swarthmore

men's tennis team for 31 seasons. During his
playing days, he occupied the #2 singles and
#1 doubles spots at the University of
California at Berkley, once securing a bid to

the U.S.
