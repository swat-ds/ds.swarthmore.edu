"We kept up an almost continuous vigil on the porch from

The protest was a means of

to the 1991 GulfWar. According to current policy they will
persist until Iraq complies with
U.N. weapons inspection demands. These are some of the

Huff presents research
Ben Huff '99 presented his research on liquid crystals to the Council on Undergraduate Research in
Washington April 13. Only 80 out of several hundred nominees were chosen to represent student research to United States Representatives.
Huff's research began the summer of his sophomore year when Physics Department Chair Peter
Collings suggested he help him with his work on liquid crystals. Liquid crystals are in a state of matter
between solid and liquid and are used for displays in
instruments like calculators and laptops.
Huff was nominated by Collings to participate in
the conference.
CUR is organized by lawmakers to mobilize support and sustain funding for the National Science
Fund and the National Institute on Health, explained
Huff.
Overall, Huff felt that the conference was poorly
conducted. Huff said that the conference was not as
successful as it should have been because the organizational process was moved from the hands of the
scientists to those of lawyers and lobbyists. "It was
basically a day-long cheerleading session," he said.
The day began with an orientation that was designed to "brainwash students" and give them "practice on how to beg for money," lamented Huff. Then,
all the students were scheduled to meet with their
representatives: Huff met with both the representative for Delaware County and Rep. Peter Defazio of
his home in Oregon, neither of whom really seemed
interested in what he and his peers had to say, said
Huff. The students were to present their research at a
poster session attended by all the representatives and
their aides and lobbyists, but Huff said that was a
veritable fiasco.

Europe and U.S. enter
trade dispute
Wednesday evening, chiefs of the European Commission voted to bar all imports of American beef
over fear of a cancer link. The European Commission has been worried about the use of growth hormones in cattle by US farmers. The ban, which starts
on June 15, also applies to beef liver. Growth hormones for cattle were banned in Europe in 1989.
America, which has not barred them, produces hormone-free beef for Europe. Tests by EU scientists
found 60 out of 500 samples contained traces ofhormones. Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said
the ban would be reversed only when the EU was
convinced all American beef imports were hormonefree. The move is the latest twist in years of trade
wars between Europe and America and threatens to
worsen a current dispute over banana sales.

Patient nationalism in
Palestine
After days of debate, the Palestinian leadership of
the PLCs Central Council voted Thursday in Gaza
City to delay a decision on their statehood until after
Israel's May 17 election. The chairman of the PCC,
Salim Zanoun, said the 124-member council voted
overwhelmingly today to convene a general meeting
in another month and to form a committee thatwould
begin drafting a Palestinian constitution, with the help
of the Arab League.
The council also authorized a smaller group, the
18-member PLO Executive Committee, to review
letters of assurances to Arafat from the EU and the
US. In exchange for agreeing to delay a declaration
of statehood, Arafat won EU support for a Palestinian state within a year and the strongest expression
of support yet for Palestinian self-determination from
President Clinton. Netanyahu has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank in retaliation for a unilateral Palestinian declaration q£statehood. The United
States and other countries had pressed Arafat not to
declare statehood, fearing it could kill chances for

Owl Bookshop to close

permanently

The Owl Bookshop, run by volunteers for the benefit of the Bryn Mawr Regional Scholarship Fund,
will not be relocating to another site, contrary to previous reports. The bookstore will be closing on April
30 in preparation for its final sale from May 1 to 15.
The bookstore sells used and second-hand books
and other items such as postcards, prints, magazines,
and records. Volunteers who run the store are mostly
Bryn Mawr alumnae. The proceeds from their sales
provide funding for the Regional Scholarship Fund,
benefiting students coming from half of the Pennsylvania area and southern New Jersey.
It was previously reported that The Owl had plans
to relocate after it moves out to open up space for
the new building that will house the Admissions
Office, the Financial Aid Office, and the Office of
Public Information. The construction of this new
building is part of a series of infrastructure projects
and renovations dubbed "The Gateway Project." The
Gateway Project, in turn, is a major component of
the College's $3O million capital plan.
According to Ethel Jackman, one of the directors
of the Owl Bookshop, the decision not to relocate
was made because the volunteers were concerned
about taking on the financial responsibility that relocation would entail. Jackman says that the expenses
that they would incur in paying for the rent of another Owl Bookshop building would diminish the
funds that could be directed instead to the Regional
Scholarship Fund.
"I do hope for the possibility for finding space [to
relocate] in the future," said Jackman.
The Owl Bookshop has already contributed close
to $1 million towards the Regional Scholarship Fund
in its 28 years of existence. The College pays for the
very little expenses that they incur throughout the
year, such as telephone bills. Jackman saidthat they
will still continue to contribute to theFund by holding annual sales in a rented space, possibly on the
Bryn Mawr campus.

Copies of Littleton
The last two weeks have witnessed several copycat Internet threats to those made prior to the massacre in Littleton, CO. Classrooms across the country
have been emptied, lockers searched and students
questioned because of threats to mimic the crime.
Incidents range from rumors of threats, to Internet
hitlists, and to students bringing weapons into school.
Many have turned out to be hoaxes, but reaction has
been swift and serious. In Cadillac, Mich., Tuesday,
schools were closed for all 4,000 students when authorities were alerted to an Internet threat against
them. Two ninth graders are being expelled for making the threat, according to Dr. Fred Carroll, superintendent, after police found bomb-making materials in the bedroom of one of the boys. "Parents have
to know what their kids are doing," Carroll says. "We
felt that about alcohol, we felt that about drugs, and
we now feel that about the Internet." In addition to
the Michigan threat, many other Internet threats
against schools have recently been made, including
towns in Wisconsin, West Virginia and Texas. In fact,
Cadillac officials found out about the threat against
their schools from people in Florida and Arizona.

House debates on Balkans

Wednesday, in the first major congressional debate
since NATO's 5-week-old bombing campaign ofYugoslavia began, the House of Representatives voted
249 to 180 across party lines to limit President
Clinton's ability to wage war, with legislation demanding prior congressional approval before combat troops may be sent into the Balkans. Democrats
and Republicans sparred over Clinton's capacity to
send ground troops without Congressional consent,
some arguing for limitations, other highlighting his
role as commander in chief. A proposal to withdraw
all U.S. troops from the NATO campaign within 30
days, sponsored by Rep. Tom Campbell (CA,) was
defeated 290-139. Campbell had emphasized thai a
continued air war without congressional approval was
a violation ofthe War Powers Act, a Vietnam-era bill.
Although Clinton maintains that NATO has no intention of introducing ground troops, the alliance s
military commanders are reviewing options for a land
war, and the United States has sent more troops and
equipment to the Balkan region.

Haverford students
address Board of
Managers meeting
Following through on a commitment to continue
debate on the rejected Students' Council Constitution, a group calling itself Concerned Students of
Haverford College (CSH) was permitted to address
the Board of Managers at their meeting on Saturday
morning. After being told by the administration that
the Board's agenda was full, in last minute negotiations with the Vice Chair of the Board Asia Bennet
the student organization managed to convince the
Board to add their shortpresentation to the meeting's
agenda.
Fifteen students, including nine seniors, filed into
Founders Common Room Saturday morning in a
demonstration of solidarity and briefed the Board on
the current situation regarding the new SC Constitution that was rejected by President Tom Tritton in
March because he believed that it did not sufficiently
acknowledge the relationship between student government and the rest of the College.
Senior David Cooper spoke on behalf of the Concerned Students and outlined plans for a "framing
document" that would reflect the cooperative and dependent relationship between students, faculty, administration, and Board of Managers. Cooper emphasized that the document would be drafted jointly
with the administration and placed at the front of the
SC Constitution "as a reference point for students to
look to when considering their Constitution."
Unlike the Constitution, the "framing document"
would not be subject to ratification or amendment at
Plenary. It would become college policy regarding
the relationship between student government and the
administration, and a fixed guide to current and future constitutions.
More than just seeking to make the Board aware
of the controversy, Cooper called on them to take
action to remedy the situation, specifically asking that
they support the idea of the "framing statement"
which would then subsequently be worked out with

the administration and that the rejected Constitution
be accepted. However, there is little chance that the
Board will interfere in the situation at all. After the
meeting adjourned members ofthe Board expressed
their gratitude fhat CSH made the presentation but
did not take any action, leaving the controversy to be
worked out between Tritton and the students.

700 students sign
diversity petition at BMC

A group of concerned Bryn Mawr students has
come up with a petition for increased diversity on
campus. A campus-wide signature campaign was
conducted, calling for action in a wide range of diversity issues from campus accessibility, to race relations, to the creation ofan Ethnic and Multicultural
Studies department. At press time, about 700 or so
signatures had already been tallied and counted,
which represents overhalf ofthe entire student body.
According to Mary Plummer '99, one of those
spearheading the campaign, "the petition was the
brainchild ofa group of angered friends who decided
to meet with other student activists on campus to talk
about how we could best take action to see certain
goals accomplished on campus."
There is no formal student organization which oversees the petition process. The campaign is spearheaded entirely by a group of concerned students,
many of whom are members or heads of organizations on campus. Evelyn Lynn '99 says that activism
on the Bryn Mawr campus works through a core
group composed of about twenty student leaders who
organize or head about all of the cultural and other
activism-oriented groups. These students have
worked closely in one way or another with the administration and understand how and where to work
or complement in areas where action is lacking.
After all signatures have been collected and final
tallies obtained, the petition will be presented to the
SGA, President Nancy Vickers, the Board ofTrustees, and other organizations.

Makers screen IC rally's documentary video
by Tanya Wansom

Staff Writer

The "Respect Safety Unity"
Rally documentary video, produced by Prachi Patankar 'OO
and Maria McMath '99, was
presented for the first time last
Friday in Kirby Lecture Hall.
Before the video was shown,
McMath and Patankar gave a
short presentation on their
backgrounds at Swarthmore
and a history of the making of
the video.

McMath and Patankar began
working on the video in November and finished the video
last month. They both felt that
the incident of vandalism that
occurred at the Intercultural
Center last October should not
be forgotten, and decided to
document the incident, the
rally, and the aftermath of the
rally in the video.
Both said they wanted the
video to be used as "a tool of
empowerment" for the IC
groups targeted in the incident,

but they have not yet decided
whether to show it on other
campuses or how else to use it
in the future.
The screening was advertised around campus with flyers asking provocative questions such as "Have you seen
the pictures taken by Public
Safety?"
At the beginning of the
video, text was shown stating
what each of the three groups
housed in the Intercultural
Center do and stand for, and a

Diversity Coalition sponsored Merge '99, a series of
events intended to promote the
concept of unity in diversity,
held from April 15-18. Events
included a music night featuring Liz Nickrenz and the Backwater Wayne Miller Tribute
Band, the Sager party, a Henna
Party/Movie Night, and an outdoor fair.
The fair, designed to be the
culmination ofMerge '99, was
planned by Bjorn DittmerRoche 'OO, Rachel Kane 'O2
and Mavis Biss 'O2. Itfeatured
booths from several campus

organizations under the DC
umbrella,
including
Swarthmore Asian Organization, which taught fairgoers to
write different Asian languages, Swarthmore Queer
Union, which promoted protection "day or night" by offering condoms and sunscreen,
Swarthmore Christian Fellowship, which offered free foot
washing and bibles, and many
others.
Keeping with tradition, the
fair also offered traditional fair
cuisine: ADVICE put on a barbecue in the fragrance garden,
and Queer Straight Alliance
served free popcorn and cotton
candy. Music was provided by

Dave Auerbach' 01, and a performance was given by the
Gumboot Dancers.
Diversity Coalition sponsored other bring-you-back-toyour-childhood activities during the fair, including a dunking booth, a bungee run, and
boxing in a moon walk with big
gloves. Jared Solomon 'Ol,
Bohee Yoon 'Ol, Patrick Boe

were some of the voluntary
dunkees.

Board of Managers to tour DuPont,
discuss $60.5M plans for building
by Andrew Fefferman
Staff Writer

Senior members of the Col-

lege Planning Committee

(CPC) will make a presentation to the Board of Managers
today seeking approval of an
assortment of large-scale
projects, including the proposed renovation of DuPont,
the renovation of Parrish and
the construction of a new
dorm.
The College plans to spend
$60.5 million on the renovations of DuPont. According to
Vice President of College and
Community Relations Maurice
Eldridge, the renovations are
crucial. "We've got to do it,"
Eldridge said. "How else is this
going to remain the top school
in the country?"
The renovation of Parrish,
expected to cost $24 million,
is essential because it is the
oldest building on campus. The
renovation of Parrish is dependent upon the construction of
a new dorm because the dorm
space in Parrish will not be in
use during renovation. The
dorm is expected to cost $l6
million.
Eldridge also mentioned that
it is possible that some administrative offices could move
into the Lodges after the new
dorm is built and Lodges are
vacated. He added that once
this was done, the planners
could be more creative about
how to use the bottom floor of
Parrish for student space.
The emphasis on student
space in the renovation of
Parrish is evident in the itemization of costs in CPC's proposal sent out by Student

Under the College Planning Committee's proposal,
Swarthmore's main science building, DuPont, would receive
$60.5 million of renovations, file photo
Council Co-Chair Jared
Solomon 'Ol April 23. Of the
total cost of work on Parrish,
$l6 million is subsumed under
the "Student Life" heading,
while the remaining $8 million
is subsumed under the "Institutional" heading.
Eldridge said that there is
also the possibility of renovating Tarble and the Intercultural
Center. In the CPC's proposal,
the projected cost of these
renovations is about $4.5 million.
The focus of CPC's presentation to the BOM will be to
point out the problems with the
current facilities. The board
will take a tour of DuPont so
that they may inspect the inadequate facilities. Eldridge said
that many of the problems are
not visible but that the board
will be able to "breathe the air"
and that this should elucidate
the nature of the problems.

Members of the DuPont faculty will be leading the tour,
and one of the problems they
will be able to point out is the
inadequate number of fume
hoods.
When asked about the plans
of the Biology Department,
which has not been planning
for renovations of Martin as
long as the DuPont faculty has
been planning renovations of
their facility.
Eldridge only said that Martin would not be renovated as
extensively as DuPont. This is
because many of the labs in
Martin have already been renovated, he said.
Eldridge said that the CPC's
plan will be financed primarily
through fundraising. Much of
the funding for such projects
comes from alumni and members of the board, with less
funding provided by corporations.

the specs who did not misconduct themselves have
gone home with the wrong

such misconduct."
"We did not feel there was
any institutionalized system
for responding to this sort of
event," said Mary Lyon RA
Chris Flood '99.
The letter also recommends that Orientation
Committee form earlier in
the semester, which would
allow other organizations
more time to plan dry events
for the weekend.

Text of the letter the RAs sent to Dean Goundie,
as provided to The Phoenix:
Dear Tedd Goundie:
The Resident Assistants would like to recommend some
slight changes in Student Activities policy.
We make our recommendation in light of problems that
occured during "Spec Weekend." On Saturday night of that
weekend, SAC funded a party serving alcohol in Paces,
having responsibly sent out an all-campus e-mail indi- filing that specs were not allowed to attend. Unfortunately,
this proclamation proved unenforceable; as you may already know, many specs were able to either sneak or persuade Party Associates to let them into the party. Whether
because they were under the influence of alcohol or because this party attracted specs prone to innappropriate
conduct, some ofthese specs verbally and sexually harassed
several Swarthmore students at this party. Our campus is
still feeling the disturbingrepercussions ofthis misconduct:
many are hurt, confused, and angry. Moreover, the specs
who did not misconduct themselves have gone home with
the wrong idea about how Swarthmore entertains itself;
those who are offended by this behavior will be reluctant
to attend, and the perpetrators will come to our school thinking they can continue such misconduct.
Although the complex causes of this problem require difficult and potentially controversial long-term solutions, we
the undersigned feel that two immediate short-term adjustments are in order. First, we request that "Spec Weekend"
becomes officially dry; in other words, large parties intent
on serving alcohol shall no longer be funded or given party
during this weekend. As representatives of student
ody and extensions of the administration, we feel that, to
avoid such disturbances in the future, this campus is willing to look to small, controllable gatherings for the provision ofalcohol during this one weekend of the whole year.
Second, we suggest that Orientation Committee forms earlier in the semester for the purpose ofcoordinating the spec
events, enabling other campus organizations to focus on
dry activities geared towards Swarthmore students.
We hope that you find these suggestions reasonable.
Sincerely,

Eermits

added, "I think my attempted

Dave Thomas 'O2, SAC liaison to SC, expressed additional
concerns Monday evening over
the ramifications ofBess's decision. Afraid of a new SBC
policy that would endanger
party permit signers, Thomas
suggested that SAC would effectively discourage people
from throwing parties in the
future. These sentiments were
reaffirmed at the SAC meeting
Tuesday night, along with
questions of SBC's veto power.
"It felt to me like they were

co-chair Chris Sadjera 'Ol said
at Tuesday's meeting.

Many
downplayed the major issues at
stake over the raid and emphasized no need for policy
change. Though in the minority, Solomon was vocal in demanding action to avoid a repeat incident this weekend.
However, no one, including
Solomon, could come up with
feasible policy changes.
"I don t see a problem with
the current system," said Matt
Schwartz 'Ol, who added that
he expected better adherence to
the rules in light of this past
weekend's events. Other SC
members agreed, affirming a
self-regulating policy for party
throwers.
The general sentiment at the
meeting led to indecision over
whether to hold a chat with
administrators Tuesday night.
Several SC members, including Schwartz and Rodney Morris 'Ol, initially felt the meeting was unnecessary. Only
when aDU brother, one of several observing the meeting,
adamantly expressed the desire
and necessity of an open forum, did SC concur on the issue.

Past issues revisited
The raid at DU has rekindled
issues raised last September
after three students were arrested for underage drinking.
Fears spread that borough police were systematically cracking down on Swarthmore students. Though the police denied any policy changes, the
arrests engendered a negative
attitude toward Ville cops and
seemed to indicate tension between Public Safety and law
enforcement officials.
Schall indicated, however,
that the current relationship
between Public Safety and
Borough police is not
adversarial. He noted that the
Ville force is being very cooperative in trying to sort out this
weekend's issues, and that the
College is working with the
Borough to find a solution that
works best for the 27 cited
partygoers. Police Chief Craig
expressed similar sentiments
over town-gown police relations.
"We do not want to spend
our time up on campus but it's
in our area of responsibility,"
said Craig.
Antagonism between the
College and outside law enforcement was only one ofthe
issues that prompted Tuesday

The raid at Delta Upsilon last
Saturday will likely bring
about changes not only in the
PA system but also in students'
attitudes about drinking and
the campus environment.
"There used to be a myth that
the College campus is a sanctuary," Bob Gross said at
Tuesday's chat. If nothing else,
that myth has been deeply
shaken by the events of this
past weekend.

surer Josh Bess 'OO dediced to
refuse to accept receipts from
the party, both because the
party was abruptly canceled
and because he believed some
of the $2,300 SBC approved
for it was used to buy alcohol.
That would have violated
SAC policy. "Individual students or student organizations
may apply to the Social Affairs
Committee (SAC) to obtain
funds to sponsor an All-College party," the student handbook states. "No part of this
funding may be used to purchase alcoholic beverages."
"But we all know that SAF
money goes to alcohol," Student Council co-chair Jared
Solomon 'Ol interjected to
laughter at a tense moment at
an all-campus meeting with
administrators. "Let's enforce
the system we have with PAs
so we don't get caught," he
continued at the Tuesday meeting organized by SC.
The raid started when an undercover policewoman entered
the party at about 8:30 Saturday night, saw illegal activity
and called the rest ofthe force.
"She walked in unchallenged," said Dean of the College Bob Gross. "She walked
over to the bar and helped herself to a drink. She walked
down to the basement and saw
people smoking marijuana."
The incident might have
been prevented if PAs had
checked ID cards and kept the
undercover agent out, college
administrators agreed.
Party associates "will be paid
an hourly fee and they will be
required to remain sober

throughout the party. Their
duties will include door/ID
checking, ensuring that party
guidelines are followed, escorting impaired students, and
contacting the Office of Public Safety if events get out of
hand," the handbook states.
"ID checkers must be stationed
at the doors to regulate entry
into the party and to ensure that
alcoholic beverages are not
carried out ofthe party."
"It seems that a lot of problems could have been avoided
if people were following their
own rules," Greg Ingber '99
offered at the Tuesday meeting.
By all indications, the party's
organizers and the arrested attendees will get off easily.
Swarthmore Borough police
and the college have agreed,
pending a decision by a Delaware County judge, to commute the sentence of those arrested for underage drinking.
Instead ofbeing fined and having driver's licenses suspended, the 27 people may perform community service. The
party's hosts have not been
charged, although if they were
they would face a fine of $ 1000
per underage drinker.
After the surprise raid that
occurred too early to net a full

partygoers, the police in some
ways appear lenient.
Gross said he did not believe
the police intended to make
many arrests, but instead simply wanted to "send a message

to Swarthmore."

A week after the message
was sent, with another big all-

campus party tonight, the question remains: will anything
change because of it?

ready caught the door on fire.
"I stamped it out and called
Public Safety," he said.
The Swarthmore Police, in
cooperation with Swarthmore
College Public Safety, came to
the scene and called in the
Pennsylvania State Police Arson Investigation Unit.
Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave said that the
investigation is ongoing and
active, and he cannot divulge
any details at the present time.
Swarthmore Police Chief
Brian Craig said that the arson
investigators are testing the
mop to determine if gasoline
or any other substances were
used to help itburn. They have
not yet reached a conclusion.
Booth, however, is con-

vinced that the fire was intentional. "Absolutely. The mop
itself was shoved under the
door, but it wasn't next to the
door originally," he said. "It
was definitely purposely
done."
As for suspects, Booth gave
Public Safety a few possibilities.
Craig said, "The investigation provided us with several
pieces of information, and
we're following several leads.
At this point I'm not aware that
we have a specific suspect in
mind."
However, Craig added that
the police are pursuing some
threats which may have arisen
from the association between
Swarthmore's fraternities, and
are looking at the Delta Upsilon fraternity.

There is a link between the
fire and a police raid last weekend at DU's Margaritaville
party. According to Craig, in
the arson investigation "information was obtained that there
were violations of underage
drinking at the fraternities."
This led to a joint operation
with the Liquor Control Unit,
which involved an undercover
LCU agent at the party.
Booth said, "I know if the
fire didn't occur then this past
weekend the party wouldn't
have been stopped."
As the investigation continues, Craig said, "We're working with the College and with
Public Safety to make sure that
the College has a safe environment, and that something like
attempted arson doesn't happen again."

Party Associate policy
should be revised
The recent DU raid served as a reminder that there are flaws
in the current party system which lie neither with the alcohol
policy nor with SAC, but with the Party Associate (PA) system,
which has become a token nod to safety. The PA system must be
revised because it is evident that alcohol consumption must be
more closely monitored.
It would be foolhardy, however, for the administration to have
a knee jerk reaction and implement a more stringent alcohol
policy since it would merely drive drinking underground. Students drinking in their rooms would no doubt result in more
visits to the emergency room. It is also inappropriate for the
College community to blame SAC for the alcohol consumption
on campus since money allocated by SAC is regularly channeled into alcohol, and neither SAC nor the administration seems
bothered. The administration reiterated its laissez-faire stance
on campus alcohol consumption at the Wednesday fireside chat
when Dean Gross explicitly stated that the administration has
no intention of modifying the current policy nor of implementing a new and more stringent policy.
The real issue at hand is that PAs are ineffective, and as a
result Swarthmore parties are an an open invitation to raids.
In order to ensure that parties are well monitored, SAC
should make it part of its policy that PA attendance be directly incorporated into all proposals for party permits.
The administration must make the job of PA more attractive and increase the number of PAs, since there are currently no more than a handful of students who are willing to
work the tiresome four-hour shifts at the meager wage of
$6.50 an hour. The first improvement would be to reconsider the pay scale for PAs; not all campus jobs are the equivalent, especially those that require a student to forego the precious few hours that they have to socialize during the weekend. Another improvement would be to shorten the length of
the shift from four hours to two hours since students would
be more likely to work if they did not have to commit their
entire night to being a PA.
Ultimately, it is the health and safety of the students that is
at stake, and revitalizing the PA system is the only plausible
way to ensure the well-being of the student body.

Diversity more than Consensus system, lack of
recognition of equality responsibility hurts school
If people are going to accept
diversity, they have to acknowledge the different ways in which
people are diverse. Too often
people decide
to accept diversity by denying that others are different. Although
pretending
that everybody is the
same
may
lead to a surface recognition of
people's equality, it does not allow for the deeperand more consequential realization that people
are equalas individuals precisely
because they are all different, not
because they are the same.
Consider the statement that
African Americans are better at
sports than Asians, who are better at academics than African
Americans. I know that there is
a larger percentage of African
Americans playing professional
sports and Asians enrolled in
higher education than one would
expect from the percentage of
these groups in the population.
The question is basically
whether higher percentages of
minorities in certain areas are an
aspect of culture, genetics, or
social condition.
I do not think the question can
be dismissed off hand as not genetically based. Certainly there
are several genetic differences
between people of differentraces,
ranging from height to immunity
to certain diseases. People that
refuse to acknowledge that some
groups might be better than others at sports because of certain
physical characteristics are fooling themselves.
The same can be said for mental characteristics. The brain is an
organ, just like all the others in
the body, that has evolved slighdy
differently in different races.
There is no reason to believe that
certain races do not undergo certain mental processes diflferendy
than others. Indeed, different rates
ofmental diseases are proof that
races are genetically different.
Too often, when people point
out differences between races,
others get offended.People seem
to believe that there is some universal meter stick by which talents are evaluated, and through
some strange calculation everyone comes out equally. Talents
are in some way spread equally
overthe population, and a talent
in one area necessarily means a
detraction in another. Any deviation from the average measurement oftalents is doubly dangerous, because it implies that there
is afurther deviation in the other

Unfortunately, the result of

is no single characteristic that

Of course, while whites may

As long as the faculty and administration are
pouring so much time and energy into removing all vague references to God from the diploma, perhaps we can convince them to remove another religious element from
Swarthmore: the truly awful Quaker tradition
of doing everything by committee. It sounds
like a wonderful system, where everyone's
opinion matters and we reach consensus by
making "I" statements and avoiding personal
attacks, but in reality it works about as well as
a papier-mache surfboard. There's something
wrong with a system under which anyone's
opinion, no matter how uninformed, ill-conceived and ludicrous, can influence the action
the committee takes. After having its teeth extracted with the pliers of consensus, a good idea
becomes a proposal that means little and does
less.
Perhaps this is the reason that it does not seem
to make a lick of difference that the only clear
function ofStudent Council is to hold elections
to replace whichever member resigned since
the last meeting. While it is just a bit disturbing to see the members of our student government abandon their posts on a scale we have
not seen since the GulfWar when the Republican Guard was tying any white fabric they could
get their hands on to poles and surrendering to
CNN, the school seems to be faring well nonetheless. Somehow the breakdown of our august
body has not resulted in widespread anarchy—or even a chalking.

The attractiveness of the committee system
rests upon two things, the first being a nearly
compulsive desire for inclusiveness on every
level. It is hardly surprising to see one of the
most leftist institutions in the free world adopt
a process by which each individual on the committee has equal opportunity to contribute his
ideas for the sake of hearing all possible perspectives on an issue. I'm really sorry that I
have to say this to the best and the brightest,
but once in a while you come up with some
really stupid ideas, ideas which should be voted
down. The Waylon "Smithers" Experience was
a stupki, idea. Conducting that nationally embarrassing rally when virtually no facts were
known was a stupid idea. Slashing the funding
of many active political groups was a stupid
idea.
Anybody can make poor decisions, but the
committee system makes them difficult to prevent. When one person or a handful of individuals are charged with making a decision, it
is likely to be made swiftly and with accountability, and those responsible for the decision
can be quickly dispatched. This is the second
attractive element ofthe committee system: no
one has to take responsibility for his mistakes
because everyone on the committee is equally
to blame and hence no one is to blame. Accountability gets spread so thin that no individual ever need fear being criticized for his
decisions. The result of this is that we become
angry at no one in particular for a few days,
our anger subsides, and the following weekend we are treated to the Superintendent
Chaumers Experience.

"One man, one vote!" Sound familiar? During the civil rights
movement, the argument was made
that every man deserved an equal
voice in government. And yet, with
the current graduated income tax
system in place, some people are
forced to carry an uneven load of
responsibilities for their government.

There are two good arguments to
be made for a flat tax; the first is
purely economic, the second of a
moral nature.
But first, what is the flat tax? The
Armey flat tax bill, H.R. 1040, replaces the current federal tax code
with a system whereby both individuals and businesses pay the
same 17% tax on all income. Individuals would pay this rate after
taking a generous personal exemption; that means, for example, that
a family of four would pay no tax
on the first $35,400 oftheir income.
Additionally, the flat tax would
eliminate special exemptions in the
tax code, benefits which affect
mostly the rich. No loopholes for
powerful lobbies; just a simple tax
system that treats everyone the
same.

The depersonalization of Swat
by Min Lee

Editorial Board Director

In a campus-wide mass
mailing several weeks ago,
the Dean's Office put in the
hands of every student a set
of papers bearing incredibly
fine print and cluttered little
circles, reminiscent of an
SAT exam. They called it
"The Cycles Survey."
The survey, usually administered to seniors only, for the
first time will document the
attitudes and opinions of all
Swarthmore students, an unprecedented feat, as Bob
Gross boasts in the cover letter that accompanied the survey. The survey questions
students about every conceivable topic, ranging from
housing to social life, in meticulous detail. The use of the
rank variable allows for five
levels ofresponses.
On the surface, this seems
like a laudable effort, an attempt to find out precisely
what's

and hopefully make improvements on the basis of the findings. But the way in which
this survey was carried out,
we believe, reflects an extremely worrying trend: the

would lead to deficit if the taxes are
lowered on the upper class, but in
fact the flat tax makes sense economically.
Dr. Alan Auerbach, a professor of
economics at the University of California at Berkeley, a former chief
economist at the Joint Committee on
Taxation and a Democrat, released a
study of the economic effects of a
flat tax. Using estimates based upon
a 19% flat tax plan, he found the
economy would be 5.7% larger after five years than it would be if the
current tax code were left in place.
That translates into $522 billion in
higher output, or more than $3,000
in higher income for the typical family of four.
The Clinton Treasury's claim that
the flat tax will lead to deficit is simply not true, nor is the claim that the
flat tax will increase burdens on the
middle class. As long as the first
$35,000 in income is tax deductible,
the middle-class tax burden will not
change drastically.
So, if the flat tax makes sense economically, why not switch, especially
given the fact that we Americans, and
especially we Swatties, are greatly
concerned with equality? If everyone's
vote counts equally, why shouldn't
everyone's taxes? The rich will still
pay more, they will just pay the same
proportionally. One vote, one tax.

Kosovo overshadows
continuing conflict in Iraq
by Pete Schilla
Staff Writer
Since the conflict in Kosovo
began to grab headlines a
couple of months ago, news
about the U.S. military presence in Iraq has slowed to a
trickle. We hear about the occasional bombing of an air defense target, but the media, and
the American people as a result, seem to have forgotten
that Saddam Hussein promised
to eliminate all ofhis weapons
of mass destruction as part of
the cease fire that ended the
Persian Gulf War.
All those months ago, the
Clinton administration considered the possibility that
Hussein would develop chemical, biological, and nuclear
weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs) a very grave threat.
After the UN weapons inspectors were frustrated by Iraqi
officials and left, we bombed
Baghdad for three days. Did
that solve the problem? Definitely not, but now that the
media will not call any attention to it, Clinton is happy to
ignore this difficult issue. If
Iraq develops those weapons,
Saddam would likely become
the military leader of the Arab
world. He has already shown
that he feels no moral restraint
against attacking his neighbors
or even his own people, and a
big leap in his military capabilities and the support of the
otherArab countries could give
him the confidence to instigate

a major Arab-Israeli, or even
Arab-U.S., conflict.
So what can be done to
maintain the current level of
security in the Middle East?
The inspections and subsequent airstrikes were intended
to eliminate Saddam's ability
to manufacture WMDs, but
neither of those has taken
place for months, allowing the
Iraqi government to resume
research and development.
Economic sanctions have only
succeeded in severely diminishing the quality of life of the
average Iraqi. Clinton has said
that he considers the overthrow of Hussein to be a major U.S. goal and Congress
has authorized $97 million to
be spent for aiding rebels, but
that is not enough. Most military experts agree that even a
well-funded and U.S.-trained
force of Iraqi dissidents could
not topple Hussein's regime.
In other words, nothing short
of a full-scale invasion with
the intent of establishing a
new government has a significant chance of successfully
removing him.
Given that invasion is not
an option, the best solution,
though one that is not guaranteed to succeed, is a combination of limited military
action and diplomacy. Any
confirmed research, manufacturing, or storage sites
should be destroyed in order
to limit Saddam's develop-

sires. In fact, the acting judge
warned Abu-Jamal to note the
race of each prospective juror,
so as to ensure a diverse jury.
Not only did the defendant ignore this sound advice but he
repeatedly interrupted the
court proceedings with outbursts, finally necessitating his
removal.
As for those who argue that
Abu-Jamal was rushing to the
aid of his brother who was being brutally beaten by Officer
Faulkner, that brother later
confessed to having been the
one to initiate the struggle.
Several eyewitnesses verified
that Officer Faulkner was in
fact the one trying to protect
himself.
What does all this mean?
Essentially, various activist organizations have adopted a
monster to promote their interests. So consumed are some
with their social experiments
that they are willing to shake
hands with the devil himself.
Just what is the rationale here:
the ends justify the means?
Everyone is entitled to an
opinion. Some believe the
death penalty to be morally
wrong and they have the right
to that belief. Others lament
what they deem a racist judicial system, perhaps with some
justification. Alas, the case of
Mumi Abu-Jamal must be considered individually, not as part
of a social trend. The fact of
the matter is that rather concrete evidence exists as to
prove Mr. Abu-Jamal's guilt,
from ballistics to eyewitnesses.
Our differences in deeming
how this convicted killer
should be punished should not
detract from what should be a
common consensus as to the
violent criminal he truly is.

SWAT PULSE
Q.

The United States is currently engaged in an air war against Yugoslavia to
prevent Serbian expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the territory of
Kosovo. Alas, air-strikes have thus far failed to halt the Serbian offensive.
In your opinion, what option should the United States now take and why?
•

The ethnic Albanians of
Kosovo should stand and
fight this civil war instead of
running away and crying to
NATO. The KLA needs more
volunteer troops, not deserters and NATO bombs, to
stand up to Milosevic. Wake
up, America —there is no
genocide going on in Kosovo.
There have been only 2,000
civilians killed there in the
last year, par for the course
in a civil war. The U.S. has
no business bombing or intervening in any other way in a
six-hundred-year-old civil
war, and should immediately
cease all military operations
related to this conflict. Let
these people have it out once
and for all.

The air strikes were ill conceived to begin with; such tactics have never really been effective in this type of situation.
I can't say that I can think of
anything that would have
brought this conflict to a conclusion without bloodshed.
Since we are already committed to the use of armed,
forces perhaps we should
launch a full scale invasion
and then run the country for
however long it takes to ensure
that the conflict will not arise
again. What will probably
happen is that when the Albanians have been pushed out of
Kosovo the conflict will end
and the problem will be finding a place to put the refugees.

Finding faith at Swat
Staff Writer
LastApril, an anti-death penalty meeting was held at the Swarthmore Presbyterian Church that included some area
residents and Swarthmore students. At a
round table discussion, all were asked to
give their names and their religious affiliations. Going around the room, people
often placed themselves in two faiths or
as a non-practicing member of a faith.
Finally, a Swattie gave his name then
shrugged his shoulders and said, “I’m a
college student.”
Swarthmore encourages students to
question themselves, their motivations,
the authorities around them,and the ideologies oftheir society by studying economics, anthropology, psychology, politics, philosophy, the arts, and religion.
However, questioning can have a painful
effect on religious faith as Swarthmore
seems to cultivate a spiritofanalysis, critique and deconstruction.
One meets the sentiment at Swat that
religion is something to be tolerated rather
than cultivated.Perhaps this is due to fear
ofalienation; Swarthmore prides itselfon
diversity, and the presentation of any one
totalizing viewpoint, especially areligious
one, is bound to challenge someone’s
individual experience. Consequently, social issues are often divorced from spiritual considerations.
For example, a recent proposal for a
candlelight vigil for the victims in
Littleton, Colo, was proposed not by the
Protestant or any Christian community
here, but by SPAC, a secular activist
group. It is also interesting tonote that in
the recent impassioned panel on the U.S.
role in Kosovo, among multiple political, historical, and moral debates, spiritual issues never arose. Peace Studies and
Religion Prof. Jerry Frost labeled U.S.
foreign invasion as often “deplorable,” yet
the concept ofevil never entered the conversation, maybe because offear that the
issue would then become too heated.
Philosophy Prof. Hugh Lacey has
much to say on these issues. He is a

Philadelphia and has taught at Catholic
institutions in the area, such as Villanova

Student-run Ruach creates community
by Malika Krasik-Geiger
and Rachel Labush
Contributing Writers

Imagine yourself at Paces, watching
two of your professors passionately debating the relative merits of the Chanukah
latke and the Purim hamentashen. No,
you aren’t dreaming—you’re at the SecondAnnual Latke-Hanientashen Debate,
a wacky and popular Ruach event.
Ruach is a campus group for Jewish
life at S warthmoie. Although commonly
misspelled, mispronounced, andreferred
to as Rauch oreven Runch, Ruach is actually a Hebrew word meaning wind or
spirit.
While maintaining a close relationship
withthe Hillel-sponsored Jewish advisors
at Swarthmore, Ruach is a completely student run group, with an eleven-person
board working to make sure that frequent
events meet the varied interests of
Swarthmore’s Jewish community and the
College at large. Ehr v’Ehr, tire Jewish literary magazine, is loosely affiliated with
Ruach since many ofthe same people participate in both, and a Queer Jews group
also exists alongside the larger organization, with some shared programming.
Rebecca Grabiner, one of the two Ad-

visors for Jewish Life on campus, has
been pleased to see the strong student
leadership in Ruach and the wide-ranging events it offers on campus. She is also
struck by the inclusive atmosphere and
notes that “people feel very comfortable
bringing theirnon-Jewish roommates or
friends to Jewish events.”
These events range from screenings of
Mel Brooks movies such as “History of
the World Part F and “Men in Tights” to
discussions led by visiting scholars to
special services for the Jewish holidays.
For Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, which took place last week,
Ruach tabled in Parrish Parlors with posters about different groups targeted by the
Nazis and black ribbons for people to
•wear inrecognition ofthe twelve million
victims of the Holocaust
There is no typical Jewish background
for a Swarthmore student. Some Ruach
participants attended JewishDay Schools
or grew up speaking Hebrew, while others find religious ritual completely foreign. Accommodating people from such
varying backgrounds can be achallenge,
butRuach manages to incorporate aspects
of several different traditions into one
weekly student-led Shabbat service every Friday evening, a practice rare on

college campuses.
The Shabbat dinner following services
is cooked by students downstairs in
Ruach’s kitchen. Ruach keeps thekitchen
kosher-dairy so that any Jew would feel
comfortable eating food from it, even
though very few Swarthmore students
keep strictly kosher. Ofthe weekly meal
itself, Shira Kost-Grant ’O2 says that “Friday night dinner with Ruach is a really
nice break from Sharpies food because
it’sbasically like a home cooked meal—and the desserts are really good too.”
Under the guidance ofArm Fmkelstein
’Ol, Ruach Kitchen Coordinator, Ruach
studentcooks have provided international
Jewish cooking to hundreds of Swarthmore students at holiday parties, the
wildly popular annual Jewish Food Festival in Paces, Ruach Bagel Brunches, and
at the Diversity Fair this past Sunday.
Many students who participate in
Ruach activities feel a strong sense of
Jewish identity that is not based on religious conviction, but on a sense of
shared history, community, and culture.
Says, Geoff Anisman ’OO, a former
board member and organizer of last
year’s Mel Brooks film festival, “Judaism is just as much about the food you
eat and your sense ofhumor.”

Psalters

combines
religion and
a cappella
by Bubu Banini and Linda Thai
Phoenix Staff

Although it is just one of the
myriad of a cappella groups at
Swarthmore College, Psalters
considers itself a spiritual experience with a religious goal.
According to the Psalters web
page mission statement, “Our
first and highest objective as a
group is to spread, by word and
example, the good news of
Christ: to preach that he lived on
earth, died for our sins, and rose
again to bring us to new life in
him. Our commitment is not to
performing catchy or entertaining or even beautiful music, but
to proclaiming that message in
the most effective way possible... We choose songs that we
feel tell the truth about Christ in
a way that will make people listen.”
Psalters, a Christian a cappella
group, was founded in the fall of
1992.
At the beginning of the semester, Psalters holds auditions for
new members and decides on the
music it will sing for the year.
Most of the music performed is
contemporary, much of which
can be desribed as Christian pop.
In addition to performing
these songs in the Jamboree, a
concert at Swarthmore that includes all the a cappella groups
on campus, and the Christmas
Carol Sing, Psalters has performed in the past two years at
concerts held at the University
of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and a number of area
churches.
But Psalters does more than
perform; the group also incorporates prayer at its meetings.
Three times a week. Psalters
meets to pray for each other and
extend those prayers to the entire
campus.
Combining religion and music is certainly not a new idea,
but for Psalters, it is a way to
uplift one’s spirits and feel
closer to one’s faith. As group
member Bubu Banini ’O2 commented, “The songs we sing do
not only minister to our audience, but to us as well. By practicing our songs over and over
again, we believe that God’s
word will become embedded in
us. We hope that God will continue to strengthen us and give
us sincere hearts when we
sing.”

dialogue between religious
groups and provide information
for the campus at large. The
statement says, “Our purpose as
an organization is to provide a
means of encouraging and facilitating communication between
the different religious groups on
campus. We also desire to engage
the wider campus in discussion
and education on topics of religion and spirituality.”
The statement also lays out the
rules of conduct for the Interfaith
Center, which currently consists
of areas in Bond, including the
Common Worship Room. The
council took great care in defining the terms “safe space,” “respect,” and “welcome conversation.” These efforts were made in
order to encourage discussion
between individuals without
making any individual feel uncomfortable or threatened. The
statement concludes with the Interfaith Council taking responsibility for dealing with any disputes in the Interfaith Center.
Lack of continuity has hindered the Council from achieving some of its goals. The representatives on the Council
changed almost entirely between
the fall and spring semesters this
year due partially to students
studying abroad. Most members
of the Council, including the intern, will either continue next

year or be replaced by former
members returning from study
abroad programs.
On Friday, April 23, the Interfaith Council sponsored a Fun
Day Carnival. Due to bad
weather the event was held inside
in Upper Tarble, probably contributing to low attendance. The
purpose of the event was simply
to promote interaction between
members of the Swarthmore
Community. Activities included
three-legged races, musical
chairs, an origami table, and an
unexpected massive cup game.
During the event, the Council
also handed out a survey. The
questions concerned students’
attitudes to the current aspects of
religion at Swarthmore. In response to whether religious
needs were being met, answers
were mixed.
Early next semester the Interfaith Council plans to hold a
retreat to discuss plans for the
future. Topics expected to be
discussed include religious tolerance on campus, the relationship of religious advisors to
the administration, the possibility of an Interfaith Director
and improvements to Bond.
Next year the Council also
plans on starting a library in
the Common Worship Room
and inviting speakers to campus.

Society of Friends
embraces diverse views
by Hilary Rice
Staff Writer
The Society of Friends and Quakerism have their origins in seventeenth-century English society.
George Fox did not find the answers
to his questions in any of the
churches of his day, and called for
the church to return to what it had
been in the days of the Apostles.
Says Ted Hoare of the Australia
Yearly Meeting, “He maintained that
the message of the early church had
been lost when the church became
institutionalized and believed that he,
and others with him, could stand in
exactly the same state as Apostles,
with the same power to teach, to heal,
and to prophesy that the Apostles
had.”
Fox challenged the necessity for
and the authority ofthe hierarchical
structure of priests and bishops, and
taught that the responsibility for ministry rested upon all. Fox’s views, and
those of his followers, were not
popular in England, and were persecuted by both Cromwell’s Puritan
government and Charles IPs Restoration regime.
The religious beliefs of the Society of Friends have a very large influence on the manner and direction
in which they conduct their lives.
Quakers believe that religion, or belief, is experiential. It is not enough
to accept words or practices; instead
one must experience God for oneself.
This is part of the larger belief in life
as both an inward and an outward
journey. “You go inward to wait upon
and receive the word and support of
God and then take this out to action
in the world,” explains Hoare.
This emphasis on both the inward
and outward journeys has led Friends
over the years to embrace a multitude of causes, including many pioneering social action programs such

as reforming prisons, schools, men-

tal institutions and labor conditions
as well as supporting refugees and
others in need.
Another factor in the progressive
action of the Quakers is their belief
that all are equal under God. While
in this country this is no longer seen
as a radical notion, for most of the
Friends’ history it has been regarded
as such by the rest of society.
Friends have always given men and
women equal status, along with
members from every race and class
of society. This commitment to
equality led to the involvement ofthe
Friends in drives to eliminate political and social discrimination against
people based upon race, sex or class.
Connected to the Quaker belief of
equality under God is the belief that
all have been given a measure ofthe
power, or the light, of God. This “inner light” is a source of unity among
those who respond to it or answer it
within one another. From this belief
in the inner light comes the Peace
Testimony, an important Quaker
principle, which holds that “if that
of God was a reality within oneself
it would be denying the inner Spirit
to take up arms against one another.”
As a result ofthis belief, the Society
ofFriends has always played a leading role in opposing war and preparations for war.
As an alternative to force, Quaker
practice emphasizes the integration
of various points of view into a new
and higher level. Hoare explains that
“in appealing to the Light within another we also appeal to the Light
within ourselves; as a result, we may
find that the other is right and we are
wrong.” The use of force, which only
has the power to create temporary
unity, is avoided in favor of the rational discussion and deeper understanding that comes from appealing
to the Light within one another.

Swarthmore Mormons
need chartered group
by Julie Schwendiman
Contributing Writer

There are few people who can
claim to understand the subcultures
of both Swarthmore and Mormonism. In any given year, there are usually just a handful of Mormons at
Swarthmore, and within that small
group there is no consensus on the
question of how one’s Mormon perspective influences one’s Swarthmore experience.
Mormons, accurately referred to as
Latter-Day Saints or members of the
Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-Day
Saints, get their nickname from the
ancient prophet Mormon, who was
one of the last prophets to write in
The Book ofMormon. The Book of
Mormon and the Bible are the central scriptural texts of the religion and
provide the doctrinal basis for the
Mormon faith. Mormons are Christians, although they do not fall into
the category of Protestantism.
The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-Day Saints was organized by a
modem-day prophet in the early
1800’s. Today, the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-Day Saints continues to be led by a prophet and a council of twelve apostles who adhere to
the principle of modem-day revelation.
The cultural aspects of Mormon-

ism are entrenched in the typical
Latter-Day Saint lifestyle. Mormons
hold to a common “Health Code,”
which includes the strict prohibition
against alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and substance abuse.
Also, an enormous emphasis is
placed on family life. A central teaching of the Mormon faith is that family should be one’s first priority. For
many Mormons, one’s family plays
the single most important role in
one’s life.
Part of being Mormon at Swarthmore requires traveling off-campus for
worship services and other activities.
Currently, the Swarthmore Mormons
attend a congregation ofapproximately
100 students and young professionals
from the Philadelphia area.
The Mormon students on campus
are .considering re-chartering an official organization called the LatterDay Saint Student Association; many
similar groups (of the same name)
exist on college campuses throughout the country.
Chartering the organization would
benefit Latter-Day Saint students by
providing them with more visibility
to the Swarthmore community. More
importantly, however, a chartered
group would insure that Mormon students at Swarthmore are supported
by the College as well as by their student congregation.

Swarthmore's stubborn and irrational
refusal to welcome the same standard
for grades that the rest of the United
States has embraced has severely limited the options of many students.
If our grade point averages only mattered within Swarthmore, then one

Swarthmore have practical consein the outside world. Oxford's
?|uences
oreign exchange program demands at
least a 3.5 GPA, and, according to Foreign Study Advisor Steven Piker, makes
no exception for Swarthmore students.
As I was looking through internships
for the summer, numerous programs
had minimum GPA requirements of
3.5. While this is comparatively easy
to attain at other colleges and universities, we all know this is fairly difficult

at Swarthmore. How many brilliant and
enterprising Swarthmore students are
kept out of promising jobs because of
the College's obstinacy in not maintaining GPA proportionality with the rest
of the nation? And these are just official grade cutoffs; how many other
firms see a Swarthmore student's low
GPA and immediately discard the application?
Personal anecdote: my brother was
on a committee of ten interviewers at
one of the largest and best regarded
consulting firms in the country. When
a Swarthmore student applied to this
firm with a 3.4 GPA, all nine other
members of the committee were ready
to dismiss him immediately for low
grades. Had my brother, the recipient
of my constant bitching about
Swarthmore's ridiculous grade policy,
not coincidentally been on the committee, the applicant would have been rejected right away.
It is already asking a lot for top companies and graduate schools to have
heard of Swarthmore at all. Is it not asking a little too much for them to have
heard about our grade policy too? Are
we not a little bit too small to unilaterally fight grade inflation?
So maybe Berkeley Law School and
a few other institutions are aware of
Swarthmore's grading policies. But
why should Swarthmore students be

Pop culture "Pushing Tin": Movie caught
more telling the wake of an injured 747
than any ism

by Brendan Karch

Online Editor

Ben Fritz
The Other

Unreal World

Unfortunately, there aren't any loud
plane crashes in "Pushing Tin," a new
film about life's stresses at the busiest
air traffic control center in the world.
The only crash in this film is much,
much quieter—the slow free-fall of insipid, lifeless filmmaking.
"Pushing Tin" is all the more disappointing because it brings together one
director and two actors whose combined work is promising. Mike Newell,
the director of the impressive "Donnie
Brasco," brings to us the story of two
air traffic controllers and their personal
battles to control the finite New York
air space. Nick Falzone (John Cusack)
is the hottest of the hot-shot air traffic
controllers at Terminal Radar Approach
Control (TRACON) until a half-Native
Westerner by the name of Russell Bell
(Billy Bob Thornton) challenges his
throne and his masculinity.
The two play out their competitive
urges not only in the air traffic control
terminal, where they bring planes headon only to turn them away at the last
minute, but also in such mundane locales as at the free-throw line and at an
annoyingly authentic Italian restaurant.
Nick can't seem to beat the ultra-cool
Bell, whose superficial Zen calm masks
a really screwed-up mind. So instead,
in a fit of manly lust, Nick cheats on
his wife with Bell's very own siliconladen spouse.
Most critics agree that after this intriguing opening the film rums sour.

It's often enjoyable to make fun of

ignorant of the "real world" and to
laugh at how we couldn't handle life
outside our bubble. That funny little
quirk is actually quite revealing, however, and a bit disturbing. Maybe there

It is, of course, a very fine line between a healthy awareness and appreciation of popular culture and mindnumbing consumption of whatever

If you haven't stopped through 30th

restaurants serving many different
types of food, including Chinese,
Southern, Italian and American. There
is even a McDonalds for those of you
who haven't seen the golden arches in
a while. The highlights are usually
found in the buffet-style restaurants.
Specifically, All-American Cuisine
has a delightful fruit salad and unbelievably tender chicken. Unfortunately,
as most good food is, the buffet restaurants tend to be a bit pricey, (about $B- per plate) because the food is sold
by the pound. If these prices seem a
little out of your league, there is a stand
that sells pizza by the slice for $2-$4.
However, because it is pre-made, the
pizza is often dry.
Although the 30th Street Station is a
bit unkempt at times, one must consider
that it is primarily a train station, not a
restaurant. Overall, the atmosphere is

"Rise Up Singing" comes to Swarthmore
by Shira Kost-Grant
& Arts Editor

Living

A special treat came to the Swarthmore Friends Meeting House last Sunday for a large crowd of Swarthmore
students and adults from this area: the
creators of a songbook entitled "Rise

Up Singing" graced us with a singalong concert that was well worth the
two-and-a-half hours of missed homework time.
From 7:30 to 10:00 p.m., Peter Blood
and Annie Patterson led the enthusiastic audience in several familiar tunes
from different eras, genres, and cultures, and taught a few new ones. Songs
such as "Circle Game" by Joni
Mitchell, the John Denver favorite
"Take Me Home, Country Roads," and
the classic "Goodnight Irene" filled the
air as everyone in the audience joined
in harmony to bring back all the old
memories.
After a lively rendition ef "Study War
No More" began the event, Patterson
expressed excitement at the impressive
crowd and energy level in the room.
Last year when the singing duo visited,
the turnout was not as strong, but an
informal poll of this year's attendees
puts Sunday's attendance estimate at a
notable 200 people.
The first half of the sing-along was

Women's rugby struggles at W. Chester tourney
by Kathy Vaughn
and Nancy Craig
Staff Writers
After a tough 15-0 loss to
17th,
on
the
Lehigh
Swarthmore headed into this
weekend's West Chester
Tournament hoping to turn
things around and come out
victorious. Considering
Swarthmore's impressive
showing in last year's tournament —losing only narrowly to state champs Penn
State—and the fact that Swat
had taken the tournament in
1997, the team expected to do
well. Unfortunately, the
women ruggers were unable
to make good on these predictions, finishing the tournament with a 2-1-1 record.
Swarthmore came out kicking in their first game, defeating Salisbury 29-0. Scrum
Half Meghan Brennan 'OO
started things off early, barreling into the try zone off the
scrum and putting the ball

down within the first two
minutes. Not to be outdone,
Laura Blume 'Ol ran past
three Salisbury backs and
into the center of the try
zone shortly thereafter.
Flanker Elizabeth "Phil"
Meehan looped off the back
line to put one down before
time ran out in the first half.
By this time Swarthmore
knew they had the game in
the bag, but the women
weren't quite ready to relax. Swarthmore kept the
intensity up—playing the
entire period in Salisbury's
half of the field and eventually giving both Brennan
and Blume the chance to
score again. With two hit
conversions by Nancy
Craig 'Ol, Swarthmore
won the game 29-0.
Moving to a second, considerably smaller field,
Swarthmore played their
next game against the considerably
larger
Shippensburg girls. The

cramped field made it difficult
for Swat's backs to get around
Shippensburg, so the team
compensated—keeping the
ball in the forwards and
rucking hard throughout the
game, matching Ship's forwards tit-for-tat. Despite a
great effort by both teams, the
game ended scoreless.
Swarthmore played their
third game on yet another
field. A little larger than the
last one, but still not nearly
regulation size—this field
was located on a 45 degree
incline that torqued considerably to the left. There was not

advantage. Considering,
however, that neither Swat
nor their actual opponent,
BC, was accustomed to
these ridiculous conditions,
we can only report that the
field was a major factor in
the game. Both teams made
impressive up-hill drives
toward the try zone but.in
the end, however, BC was
able to convince the

Amidst much confusion,
Meredith Hegg was able to

ball firmly in the try zone early
in the second period. In an
incredible display of teamwork shortly thereafter, Nancy

'Ol scored a try together—both scrambling for a loose
ball in the try zone and touching it down at exactly the same

Swat hosts badminton tournament
Four swatties win medals in
national competition
by Wendy Kemp
Staff Wrtier

Tarble Gymnasium played
host to the annual National Collegiate Badminton Tournament
last weekend, and four Swarthmore players received medals.
The tournament, comprised of
the best college-level players
from all over the country, featured players from New York to
California.
To be eligible, players needed
to at least havereached the quarter-finals in theirregional tournament, a qualification met by
five members ofthe Swarthmore
women's badminton team. In
the Northeast Regional Tournament held in March, doubles
teams Erika Johansen '99 and
Jennifer Chen '99, and Siobhan
Carty 'Ol and Karen Lange 'O2
reached the quarter-finals in
women's doubles, whileWendy
Kemp '99 reached the semi-finals in the women's singles
competition and won second
place in the consolation round
of mixed doubles.
At the Nationals, four of the
Swarthmore women walked
away with five medals. Kemp
won second place in the main
draw of women's doubles, making her and her partner the No.
2 women's doubles team at the
badminton collegiate level.
Chen was the consolation
singles victor, and Carty walked
away with not one, but two med-

als: second place in the consolation singles round; and first
place in consolation doubles,
which she shared with Lange.
In the women's singles competition, Chen and Carry each
lost their first match and were
moved to the consolation round,
where they both won their next
three matches to reach the final
round. For this last match, it was
Swarthmore against Swarthmore, Chen against Carty. Only
after a long, dueling match did
Chen eventually triumph, capturing the women's consolation
singles title. Kemp, the remaining Swat singles player, won two
matches and reached the main
draw quarter finals before falling to Susanna Chong of Cornell
University, who eventually captured second place in the singles
tournament.
All five Swarthmore women
entered the women's doubles
tournament. As the odd one out,
Kemp was paired up with
Kokoe Tanaka of the New England Conservatory of Music.
Ranked as the third seed in the
competition, they won theirfirst
two matches and then faced a
doubles team which included
Holly Raiter of Pennsylvania
State, seeded second in the
women's singles competition.
The match lasted for three
games, with Penn State winning
the first game 15-8, and Kemp
and Tanaka rebounding back to

Men's tennis clinches regionals berth
by Peter Schilla
Staff Writer
The men's tennis team secured the N0.2 seeding at the
Northeast Regional of the
NCAA tournament last week
by defeating MIT and
Haverford. Williams College,
which defeated Swarthmore
earlier this year, will be the
No.l seed, while Trinity and
Amherst will most likely take
the third and fourth spots, respectively.
The winner of the tournament, which will take place
on May 8-9 at one of the participating schools, will advance to the final four at
Claremont McKenna. In the
first round, Williams will
probably play Amherst and
Swarthmore will play Trinity.
The Garnet hosted a muchimproved MIT squad on a
sunny Saturday afternoon
two weeks ago. The doubles

matches all started out close,
but the N0.2 and N0.3 teams
of Jon Temin 'OO and Scott
Grant 'Ol, and Dennis Mook
'Ol and John Thomas 'O2 all
pulled away at the end for
convincing victories and
earned the crucial doubles
point.
Greg Emkey '99 and Pete
Schilla 'Ol swept the doubles
when they avenged their loss
to MlT's top team at the National Rolex last fall with an
8-5 win. But soon after the
singles began, it was clear
that the rest of the match
would not be as one-sided.
Schilla and Mook both
managed to take down their
opponents in straight sets, but
the last four matches were
excruciatingly close and
wound up in third sets. After
Nick Slimack '99 and Temin
finally succumbed, N0.5
Thomas stepped up his game
in the final set and won the

deciding match.
After the victory over MIT,
only Haverford stood between the Garnet and a date
at Regionals. After an hourlong rain delay, the singles
matches went on first in case
the bad weather returned.
Mook easily finished off
his opponent and was followed shortly thereafter by
Thomas, Schilla, Emkey and
Temin. After Slimack's
match was over, all three
doubles teams took the court
and promptly trounced their
adversaries.
Now that a trip to Regionals
is certain, the whole team is
focused on an effort to make
the final four.
Says Coach Mullan, "The
level ofintensity at practice has
definitely gone up, everyone
really wants to beat Williams.
But we've never played Trinity before, so we're not going
to take anything for granted."

Women's lacrosse
finishes season with a
solid 8-8 record overall
by Sari Altschuler
Staff Writer

The women's lacrosse
team finished their relatively successful season
with an overall record of
8-8. The squad faced
many tough match-ups
throughout the season
and performed well despite some minor setbacks. The team lost
their goalie, Jane Kendall
'OO, who left to study
abroad, but luckily the
team was able to compensate with the outstanding training and
play of two new freshmen goalies, Amy
Dißennedeto 'O2 and
Heather Kile'o2. While
numerous key starting
players struggled with
injuries, the team managed to continue playing
with strength, a feat that
was made possible by the
depth and talent of the
majority of the players.
The incorporation of
eight solid freshmen
players proved challenging and profitable for
both team unity and play
on the field.
On Tuesday, April 21,
the Swarthmore squad
demonstrated their talent
in a 15-5 victory against
Bryn Mawf. The team
took an early 6-0 lead
and co-captain Holly
Baker '99 performed
spectacularly, producing
4 goals and 2 assists.
Both the coaches and the
players were pleased
with the advanced level
of play and the intensity
the team displayed.
The team's next game

against Western Maryland proved exciting yet
frustrating. The team
pulled out a clear lead
within the first ten minutes of the game with offense and defense performing well, including
especially notable play
by both Jen Hagan '99
and Kristen English 'Ol.
Unfortunately, Western
Maryland managed to rebound and after a close
game and the Garnet suffered a 19-18 defeat.
Holly Baker '99 demonstrated outstanding skill,
scoring nine times with
three assists, while Katie
Tarr 'O2 scored eight
goals and three assists.
Swarthmore's game
against Haverford last
Tuesday proved exhilarating for the women.
After losing to the Fords
12-9 earlier in the season
in an exciting game, the
team pulled a 14-13win.
The game was close and
each member ofthe team
displayed outstanding
skill. The win against
Haverford was a team
effort in which several
players demonstrated
considerable skill, notably Baker who contributed four goals and one
assist, Katie Tarr who
made six goals and one
assist, Erica Williams
'Ol who scored two
goals, Alicia Googins
'OO who contributed
two assists, and Mariam
Levy 'O2 who scored
one goal. In addition,
the defense played a
tremendous game in
which both Levy and
Sarah Singleton '99

were able to shut down
Haverford's top two
scorers. Kristen English
'Ol, Jen Hagan '99,
Becca Stites 'OO and Kim
Cariello 'O2 all contributed to the team's defensive success. Goalie
Dißenedetto,
Amy
saved 23 of Haverford's
shots. This victory
against Haverford will
count toward the Hood
Trophy where as the results of the first match
up will not.
On*'
Wednesday,
Swarthmore's women
again demonstrated
their skill and team
unity on the field.
Coach Karen Borbee
commented at half-time
that the team was working together more successfully than they had
all season. They finished up the season
with a 21-11 win over
Widner to give the team
a .500 record for the
season with a 5-5
record in the Centennial
Conference. The greatest excitement in the
game came when senior
Holly Baker managed
to attain enough goals
and assists to name her
the all-time career leading scorer for the Centennial Conference.
The women's lacrosse team finishes out
the season with a fairly
successful record. A
young team, they will
lose only three seniors:
Holly Baker, Jen Hagan
and Sarah Singleton; all
are optimistic about the
team's bright future in
the next season.
