Several students notified of copyright infringement
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu
What some call Internet piracy and others call file sharing is a fact of life here at Swarthmore, where consumers
of music, movies and software have access to speedy
Internet connections

The industries most affected by the new challenges

peer-to-peer file sharing presents to copyright and fair-use
laws are not ignoring the illegal file-sharing practices of

college students.
Already this semester, the Motion Picture Association
of America has complained to Swarthmore that a student
was sharing the movies "Office Space," "Unbreakable,"
"The Virgin Suicides" and "Ronin" off a computer, identified by its IP address.

"What we wanted to do was to
give students an opportunity to
say, 'Look, they're wrong, I'm not
doing this,' or 'lt's just not valid.'"
ITS Director Judy Downing
Information Technology Services Director Judy
Downing said such complaints from copyright holders
usually come two to three times each semester.
Most often, the notices come from the Recording
Industry of America. Others have come from the Business
Software Alliance, which alerted the college in 2001 that a
student was serving copies of Adobe Photoshop. NetPD has
contacted the college on behalf of Sony, and MediaForce on
behalf of Warner Brothers in February.
After receiving a notice, Downing sends an e-mail to the

student and notifies the deans. She also gives students a
heads-up call to let them know that they will be receiving
a "very official-sounding" e-mail from her and walks them
through the college's copyright policy. "It doesn't really
matter how we feel about various forms of copyright; it is
the law," she said.
Students have three days to respond to the notice. In all
cases, Downing said, the students have taken the files
down.
"We had one student who didn'tknow that she had file
sharing turned on," Downing said. In many cases, students
are surprised to receive the notices that the film and

recording industries are taking note of their file sharing,
Downing said.
Students also have the option of claiming fair use

that they were not using files in an illegal way. "What we
wanted to do was to give students an opportunity to say,
'Look they're wrong, Fm not doing this', or 'lt's just not
valid,'" Downing said. "That's never happened, so I don't
know exactly how that would work."
If the student does not respond within 10 days, the college will block access to the student's site if the infringing
material has not been removed. That means Internet
access will be turned off for a particular IP address. "That
would be a very severe penalty for a student," Downing

said.

After a student responds, Downing writes to the industry representative who contacted the college to let them
know that "access has been removed." But Downing would
not say whether that means the student had deleted a file
off their computer or if the student had simply turned off
file sharing capabilities. "I'm afraid to be that specific,"
Downing said. "We don't go out and look. I'm trying to protect the student as much as I protect the college. In each of
these situations, the student has said to me that they have
removed the files," she said.
A committee formed during the 1999-2000 academic year
drafted the college's current copyright policy. It outlines

Student sentenced in child porn case
DA says student described contact with minors; judge includes jail time in sentencing
BY GREG NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Ivan Boothe 'O4 was sentenced to six to
23 months of incarceration and three years
of probation after pleading guilty to all
charges against him on Monday. Boothe
will serve 30 days of this prison time over
15 weekends in a Delaware County correctional facility. The remainder will be
served as home incarceration by electronic

monitor.
Boothe was arrested on April 29 after he
had a sexual conversation over the
Internet with a police detective posing as a
15-year-old male. Upon his arrest, Boothe
admitted to having phone sex with a 17year-old male and possessing and dissemi-

nating images of child pornography.
Pornographic images depicting both pre-

and post-pubescent children were found on
his computer.

"Nothing can justify or
ameliorate the pain that
I've caused."
Ivan Boothe 'O4

At the Delaware County District Court
in Media, Boothe entered an open guilty
plea to all the charges against him. Boothe
answered a question from Judge Charles
Keeler about his educational status by
describing himself as "a junior at
Swarthmore College." Keeler then listed
and described the charges against Boothe,
who pleaded guilty to each of the charges
as they were listed.
The first charge was of "criminal communication with a minor." The second was
of 506 counts of "criminal use of a communication facility," for using a computer "to
commit the crime of sexual abuse of children." The third charge was of six counts of
"the dissemination of child pornography,"
for uploading six images of child pornography, and the fourth was of 171 counts of
"possession of child pornography."
After Boothe pleaded guilty to each of
the charges in turn, his lawyer, Joseph
Fiorvanti of Media, submitted a report
from the Joseph J. Peters Institute, a facility in Philadelphia that treats sex offenders,
where Boothe has been evaluated.
Fiorvanti then argued for a "mitigated sentence" before the court.
"Ivan has never had contact with the
criminal courts," Fiorvanti said. He added
that "it turns out that Ivan was leading a

Fiorvanti pointed out that Boothe had

"Nothing can justify or ameliorate the
pain that I've caused," Boothe said at the
trial. "I don't think I can ever make up for
the trust that I've lost from my family or

After the horn: inside Swat's fire culture
Volunteering as EMTs and firefighters, students find their niche and make a difference
BY MATTHEW FITTING

mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

Cliff Sosin 'O4 has seen more
eventful days volunteering for the
Swarthmore Fire Department. He

remembers vividly an accident
last fall on the nearby Blue Route,
when an entire family died
despite Sosin and others' best
efforts. But this Wednesday afternoon was less hectic, less dire
and, according to many students
who volunteer at the station, the
kind of day that makes their
involvement so worthwhile.
Sosin recalled the experience
from his regular position in the
front seat of the station's newest
truck as it pulled back into the
station house. Chief Edwin Kline
greeted the junior first, as Sosin
and about 10 other firefighters
returned after responding to a
routine fire alarm at a church a
few miles away.

dents like Sosin make his department run
and run well. Of the
department's more than 100 members, as of graduation last year
about 68 attended the college.
The number of students
involved now, Kline said, is prob-

ably closer to 50, but the students'
importance to the department
can't be overestimated, and Kline
goes so far as to describe the stu-

dents as "our main source of man-

power all the time." Summers, in
fact, are hardest on the depart-

ment, because most students are

away. A student who volunteers,
Kline said, will "run calls the day
after they join," and the depart-

ment continually recruits at the
college, often in engineering
classes, where eager students like

sm

"Hey, Cliff, what's the first
rule of talking on the radio?"

Kline asked.
"Make stuff sound cool?" Sosin
replied, jumping down and getting laughs from the others.

Kline smiled himself, then
made his point: "Know what

you're going to say before you say
it." He went on to mimic Sosin
stuttering over the radio after
checking in with the department

while on the road.

For Kline, kidding aside, stu-

A distinctly un-Swarthmore
experience is what many students
seem to be looking for when they
volunteer. "The nice thing about
firefighting is that it's simple
parts of it are complicated, don't
get me wrong

but it's unlike

most of what we're doing at
Swarthmore, which is never sim-

ple," he added. "When you're
doing it you're not thinking about
anything else."
Nicole Gorby 'O3, who, unlike
Sosin, took training as an EMT as
opposed to a firefighter (the
department allows students to
specialize in either or both, and
full training for each takes about
a year and a half to finish), calls
the two codes to which she's
responded her most memorable
experiences. A code is when a
patient goes into cardiac arrest.
"Not only is it a medically

challenging call, but
they're always in the
Law
toughest locations," like the third
floor of an apartment, or in a
bathroom, she said. "It's also the
most interesting because those
are the calls where most of your

skills can be used."

But aside from those unique
incidents, Gorby values especially the summer after her sophomore year, when she stayed in the
Swarthmore area. After taking
the basic EMT training that
spring, Gorby ended up going out
on almost every run. "They had
no choice
we had nobody," she
said. Getting thrown in like that,
she said, educated her more than
any individual training session.
A better understanding of the
local area, added Edwin Nam 'O4,
is another motivator for involvement in the department
involvement that, for some students who work as EMTs, adds up
to more than 20 hours a week.
Nam began volunteering his
freshman year, as both an EMT
and firefighter. "When you're at
the college, you get into a groove,
you're doing your stuff," he said.
"It's good to be in the real world
once in a while, and to be one of
those people who knows what to
do when people are at their
worst."
For Nam, "Part of you does it
because you want to see the more
intense stuff, but usually it's

much more mellow than that."
"We had a call today where a
woman fell," he said. "She was
elderly and she wasn't too seriously injured, but it was good to
just be there with her."
Volunteering can consume a
student's life, Nam admitted, and

sometimes even finds its way into
a student's schoolwork.
Bringing his fire department
experience into the classroom is
something Sosin is considering

for his senior E9O project, where
he might try to solve what has
been "a classic problem in firefighting for a long time,"

trapped firefighters in burning
buildings.
"You can't see in a fire at all,"
he said. "You can't see your hand
in front of your face," and many

have died as a result of this inability to find fallen firefighters.
Partial fixes, Sosin said, have
come from better leadership and
management in firefighting, but,
"The bottom line is that eventually the solution will be technical."
The engineering major envisions

the Global Positioning
Satellite (GPS) system to fit onto a
firefighter's body, probably as

Problems include difficulties
usually faced when GPS is used in
a 3D setting and often fires take
place on more than one floor of a
building. But, according to Sosin,
"The
biggest one is heat.

Electronics don't like temperature."

Other students involved in the
department don't intend to let
leaving Swarthmore stop them
from continuing work in the field.
Gorby plans to volunteer at the
local department wherever she
ends up after graduation next
year,

then head to medical school.

Junior looks to Europa for possible signs of life
BY PREETY SIDHU

ssidhul@swarthmore.edu

Aaron Goldman 'O3 did research last summer on the

possibility of life existing on an icy sphere far from our
planet. He presented his findings in a lecture entitled
"Extraterrestrial Origins of Life in Our Solar System" to
students and professors Wednesday evening in Kirby
Lecture Hall. Goldman, who is majoring in biology and
minoring in astronomy, spent 12 weeks this summer doing
research at the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence
(SETI) in his hometown of San Francisco. His study
focused on whether or not Europa, the second moon of
Jupiter, has conditions conducive to the origin of life.
"I wanted to be an astronomer since I was about four,"
said Goldman. During his freshman year, he attended a
lecture by Chris Chyba 'B2, where he learned about the
budding field of astrobiology. The summer after his freshman year, he worked at the NASA Astrobiology Institute
and last spring he decided to contact Chyba, who is now
the director of the Life in the Universe department of SETI.
Chyba agreed to take him on as a visiting scientist for the
summer. The project was funded by the environmental
studies concentration and the physics and astronomy
department at Swarthmore.
Astrobiology is the study of life on other planets. It is a
mixture of astrophysics, planetary science, geology, chemistry, biology and psychology. Astrobiologists search for
signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, study how life originated on earth, assess the habitability ofboth nearby planets and other regions of the universe and search for life on

THE PHOENIX

earth in extreme conditions similar to those of other planets. In the future, NASA plans to visit planets and moons
of interest, study and design biological systems for human
exploration and colonization in space, and telescopically
examine the composition of extrastellar planets. SETI is
the largest and most ambitious privately funded organization devoted to astrobiology.
Europa is one of the best candidates for extraterrestrial
life in our solar system. It is covered with a layer of ice, but
Goldman believes that there is probably some liquid ocean

underneath the ice. Liquid water, or some substance that
allows sufficient molecular movement, is necessary to harbor life. Also necessary is some form of chemical disequilibrium that could provide a source of energy to life forms.
Environments with Earthlike conditions are important as
well. Europa has all of these necessary pre-conditions for life.
If Europa is habitable, there are two possible ways in
which life could get there. It could either originate on the
planet (abiogenesis) or come from somewhere else
(panspermia). In this case, only abiogenesis is even
remotely probable. While previous research about life on
Europa, usually done by geologists and chemists, focused
only on the habitability of Europa, Goldman's research
focused on whether or not the more stringent requirements for abiogenesis were met on the moon.
Building on new research by David Deamer at the
University of Santa Cruz, which showed that life could not
originate in saltwater, Goldman concluded that the
Europan ocean was likely too salty to give rise to life.
However, he believes that the Europan ice crust, which is
less salty, may be able to support the origin of life. The fricOctober 24, 2002

tion of the crustal tectonics could melt some water, or basal
heating might create pockets of water in the ice that would
rise to between two and six kilometers from the surface.
Once life has originated in the ice crust, it must proliferate in order to evolve and diversify. There are several
possible ways in which this could happen. The water
might remain liquid long enough for proliferation to
occur. The simple forms of life that do form might be freeze
tolerant, or they may arise repeatedly until conditions are
favorable for proliferation. Once created, the crustal tec-

tonics could also

disperse the life

across the surface of the

planet, where it could find some habitable environments.

Goldmanconcluded from his summer research that life
was more likely to originate in the ice crusts of Europa
rather than the oceans, although the oceans are potentially habitable. His research may be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Astrophysics.
Goldman will graduate from Swarthmore this spring. "I
want to teach high school or maybe write a book," he said.
"Eventually I want to doresearch on the origins oflife on Earth."
"There are two things about my research that I think
are important," Goldmanconcluded. "First, life is nothing
special. It is just a combination of chemicals that can
reproduce themselves. And intelligence is just one trick
that evolution uses to reproduce. Secondly, life is really
amazing. We're just chemicals and look at all we're doing,
look at all the consequences of life. We can produce something that transcends that mere reproduction. This is not
a contradiction. Life is not rare, it is not special only to
Earth. Yet we can produce so many amazing things. That's
why I'm so driven in this field."

Cheese Court collision
The Cheese Court, at the corner of Park Avenue, suffered a broken window
and damage to its front wall when an elderly woman drove her car into the
building on Saturday, October 12.
At around 11 a.m., Francis Haury, 73, was parking her 1989 Honda Accord
in the handicap space in front of the restaurant at 1 Park Avenue. As she was
pulling into the parking space, she "hit the gas and not the brake," according
to Cheese Court owner Dale Kerns.
As the Accord lurched forward, Haury first hit the PECO energy pole on the
corner, followed by the parking meter. Then, she hit and shattered the front
window of the Cheese Court. "A ton of glass flew away from the window,"
Kerns, who was outside at the time, said. "One man who was sitting at a table
near the window jumped up because he thought it was a terrorist attack."
After hitting the window, Haury "kept her foot on the gas the whole time,"
Kerns said. "Bystanders across the street rushed over to tell her to take her
foot off the accelerator."
Since the building, according to landlord William J. Pastuszek, is made of
24-inch thick steel I-beams and solid brick construction, the car stopped after
contact. "It's a very well-built building with tons of steel supporting the building," Pastuszek said. "It's certainly not in danger of collapsing." No one was
injured during the accident.
The building sustained about $9,000 to $lO,OOO worth of damage, according to Pastuszek, who now plans to make more extensive renovations on the
building. "I'm going to try to match it to [the front of] 5 Park Avenue," he said.
"It's going to be a whole new look," Kerns said. "I just wish it were done
already."

Administrators, faculty call self-scheduled exams unlikely
Exams with special requirements, possible cheating are among obstacles facing SC proposal
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu
When Student Council representatives voted two weeks
ago to investigate the possibility of offering self-scheduled
exams, they hoped they were taking a first step toward alle-

viating problems ranging from test anxiety to the shortness
of reading week to complicated vacation planning.
But according to Registrar Martin Warner and Provost
Connie Hungerford, self-scheduled exams are unlikely to

become reality.
In the system of self-scheduled exams council imagines,
students would sign up to take all their exams at times convenient to them. The exams would still be proctored, but
the proctors would supervise all students taking any
exams at a given time. Student Council approved a proposition authorizing looking into such a system, but the
council by itself can take no action to implement it.
"In realistic terms, we have zero power," said SG copresident Ryan Budish 'O4. Even creating new guidelines
for exam scheduling would require the assent of the
Council on Educational Policy (CEP), a group of faculty,
administrators and students. But, Budish said, "the power
that we do have is the power to say this is something that
many students might benefit from."
Council members believe students would benefit from
self-scheduled exams for several reasons. The idea was

first raised during a conversation council members had
with Warner about lengthening reading period. Since
starting classes on Labor Day, offering an October break,
and scheduling exams before winter break leaves no time
for a full reading week, the participants in the meeting
turned to other alternatives.
"The possibility that emerged was that if there was
more flexibility with exams then students could lengthen
reading week for themselves," Budish said. "It was really I
think his [Warner's] suggestion, although it came out of
the discussion."
Objections raised to the self-scheduled exams proposal
center around fears of cheating and logistical concerns.
The greatest worry is that, with students taking the same
exams at different times, word would inevitably get out
about the exams' contents.

Budish thinks this is a surmountable obstacle. Pointing
out that many students already take exams earlier than
their classmates to go home sooner, he argued that "it hasn't caused too many problems. The college talks so much
about how it treats students as adults
if the faculty's so
concerned about cheating then there isn't that level of
trust."

But Warner and Hungerford disagree. "If you're leaving
if you take the exam, but then you're gone, maybe
then it's more comfortable [for faculty]," Warner said.
"What Ryan is thinking about is a minority situation, and
I'm not sure it can be scaled up even though it probably
does work just fine in these minority situations."
"I think that [the cheating worry] probably is going to
be insurmountable," Hungerford said. While some exams
are written so as to make cheating impossible, "I don't
think the faculty are going to want to restructure the good
exams they have developed."
Integrity issues loom especially in large classes.
"Informally, whenever the topic comes up, faculty are generally negative about self-scheduled exams. A handful will
say, T already do take-homes.' But especially faculty who
teach the larger classes are generally very opposed,"
Warner said.

...

"The college talks so much about how
it treats students as adults... if the
faculty's so concerned about cheating
then there isn't that level of trust."
SC co-president Ryan Budish 'O4
Astronomy professor David Cohen agreed that large
classes create the largest difficulties. "I pretty much let all
my classes except the biggest intro classes take takehomes," he said. "The bigger the class the more problematic it is. I might be a little reluctant [to implement selfscheduled exams] in Astro 1 and 3, which are the two big
intro classes."
Some disciplines, such as art history, raise more problems specific to their field. "In theory I like the idea of students being able to choose," art history professor Janine

Mileaf said. "[But] it just wouldn't work for art history."
Art history exams require slides, which all students need
to look at together. While the Student Council proposal
specifically suggested exempting classes with exams
requiring supplementary materials, Mileaf saw other disadvantages to self-scheduling. "I think there's a good spirit of all students in the room together [taking the exam], all
in it together," she said.
For Lester Iran 'O3, Education Policy Representative
and the only council member who voted against the self-

scheduled exams proposal, both cheating and logistics are
October 24, 2002

valid concerns. The proposal "would entail a lot of administrative procedure," he said. It could create problems for
professors, who might find themselves with less time to
grade exams. It could even,, he said, make life more diffi-

cult for students.

"The students would have to figure out scheduling

....

It's an additional burden on the student... on top of studying for exams." Furthermore, "the idea [of self-scheduled
exams] is a compromise between what Haverford has and
what we have. I believe an issue as important as final
exams demands a simple, clear-cut procedure and not an

ambiguous compromise."
Tran noted that a policy of self-scheduled exams might
require the institution of an honor code. Hungerford and
Warner both agree, but view the creation of an honor code
as unlikely. Haverford's honor code permits all exams to
be scheduled at students' convenience, but it also requires
that students report any acts of cheating they witness.
"I don't think an honor code is very Swarthmore-like,"
Budish said. "That whole sense of suspicion that it generates is very anti-collegial." Student Council contemplated
creating an honor code in 2000, but the idea sparked heated controversy and was quickly abandoned.
Council members met with Hungerford about the self-

scheduled exams proposal on October 11 She encouraged
them to support their proposal by finding examples of
other schools with self-scheduled exams and without
honor codes, but she also expressed doubts about the viability of the idea. "I think logistically [self-scheduled
exams] are just really not viable, although I sympathize
with the pressures that would make Student Council interested in them," she said.
Warner argues that, in light of all the difficulties surrounding the exams proposal, council would be better

served by working to protect the existing reading period.
In his meeting with the SC representatives, he said, "We
also talked about helping reading week be more focused on
reading. There is anecdotal evidence that many students
have had some kind of required exam or quiz during reading period
I think that getting more support for reading
period being special is achievable."
New guidelines developed during last year's review of
conflicts between academics and athletics urge faculty to
respect reading period. According to Hungerford, the
guidelines were a response to "the complaints that some
athletes rightly have about faculty who schedule their own
exams." Since other students also have concerns about
invasions of reading period, she said, "I think it is worth
reminding faculty of the complications they create when
they reschedule exams [during reading period]."

Many Swarthmore students look forward to October
break as a week to relax after an intense six weeks of
writing papers, doing problem sets and studying. Some
Swatties, however, devote their October breaks to confronting some of the world's problems. This year, two
groups of Swarthmore students did just that.
A dozen members of the Swarthmore Christian
Fellowship (SCF), as well as several students involved
in Christian organizations at Haverford and Bryn
Mawr, worked with the Salvation Army in Chester to
improve the town's community center and assist in
after-school programs for children ages 6-10. "Children
should have certain basic experiences and have certain
resources at their disposal," said Tamika Songster 'O4,
who organized the project. "SCF hoped that we would
facilitate that need by supplying labor or materials."
Songster became interested in organizing the project
after her involvement with a similar SCF service project last fall. This year she and the other students
focused on the crafts room and library in the Chester

community center. They painted the walls, purchased
new furniture, installed carpet and linoleum, and decorated the rooms to make them more comfortable for the
children. As they were painting, students received
input from the children as to what they wanted to have
on the walls. The volunteers also tutored and performed

various activities with the children.
"The kids were so excited to see the rooms," she
said. "The best part was feeling like or knowing that the
kids were going to enjoy and take full use of them."
She added, "Children should not be hampered by the
neighborhoods they live in or in the way their schools
are run."
Also during October break a smaller group of
Swatties worked with underprivileged children in
Norris Square, a north Philadelphia neighborhood
troubled by drugs and crime. Norris Square has been
an area of community service for Swarthmore students
over the past seven years. Organizer Lola Irele 'O5 said
the neighborhood park, intended for children, used to
be called "Needle Park" because many drug dealers sold
and used drugs there.
Irele and the others painted walls in that town's
community center and in two houses in Norris Square,
pulled weeds in the neighborhood, picked up trash in
the neighborhood gardens, and took children in after-

school programs on field trips. Irele, who had worked in
Norris Square over the summer with Higher Ground,

felt that one of the most rewarding parts of the experience was assisting the children explore their own city.
America Holloway 'O5 expressed sadness at the situation in Norris Square. "The hardest part was having to
see where they lived," she said, and described how the
group accidentally came upon a house in which cats and
dogs roamed about freely, leaving their feces on the floor.
No one bothered to clean the house in which the walls
had turned yellow and brown.
While this was an extreme case, Holloway found it
"horrible to think that people actually have to live in
those types of conditions."
She also said that instead of being made helpless,
"They [the residents of Norris Square] were made
stronger." She acknowledged that Swarthmore has had
a major effect on the community but that many of the
improvements seen in the past few years such as the
"cleaning up" of what used to be called "Needle Park"
by 250 citizens are primarily due to the willingness of

"Children should not be hampered
by the neighborhoods they live in
or in the way their schools are run."

the residents to change the neighborhood.
She also noticed this sentiment in the children and
in their drive to succeed. Holloway remarked that a
young girl she was tutoring had the habit of skipping
words while she read sentences. Even if the girl did not
skip a word while she read, she would read the sentences repeatedly to make sure that she did not leave
words out. "It's rewarding to see kids that have a hard
life, but you know they're going to make it," she said.
Both projects were funded by the Swarthmore
Foundation, which provides funds for faculty, staff and

students to undertake community service projects to
promote a sense of social responsibility in the college
community. Director of CIVIC Pat James and the members of the Swarthmore Foundation committee review
grant applications, conduct interviews throughout the
year and try to award as many grants as possible.
"We often do not have to say no because we have a
resource-rich institution. When we say no it's often
because there is a gap between the applicant's skills
and abilities and what they were planning," James said.
She noted that grant applications for winter and spring

The five-day, 30-mile hiking trip through New York's
Harriman State Park offered freshmen from Swarthmore,
Haverford and Bryn Mawr the chance to bond with their
upperclassman team leaders and each other.
"A lot of us came into the trip with preconceived notions
about what students from the other two schools were like, and
after the trip we realized how wrong a lot of those ideas were,"
Miriam Perez 'O6 said. "It's just something about being out in
you let down your guard a lot more
the woods with people
and the bonding just occurs naturally."
With 32 participants from across the three colleges (16
were Swarthmore students), this year's TrOOP trip was divided into smaller groups who hiked independently of each
other. About nine freshmen were in each group with two or
three upperclassmen leaders and two professionals from
Project USE, a company that sponsors outdoor programs and
provided gear and camping instruction.
The leaders' helpfulness impressed Jessica Gersh 'O6. "If you
were hurt, [the people from Project USE] could help fix you,"
she said. "They helped tape up my feet every morning. They
were easygoing, but they were definitely there when you needed then:. The upperclassmen, aside from leading discussions,
kept our spirits up and made sure that we could keep going."
The weather, however, was less helpful. It rained all day
on the second day and a little on the evening of the third day.
But the participants did not let the rain dampen their spirits.
"Those low points, like when we were tired and hungry and
cold, made the high points, like when we reached the top of a
mountain and had an awesome view of the countryside, so
much better," Perez said.
Lisa Nelson 'O6 said, "Hardship, like rain and blisters, really fostered bonding."
In addition to hiking, the groups held discussions about
issues like diversity and gender in the evenings. In the morning,
everyone was given a discussion question to ponder during the
hike. "You discussed [the question] with the people you are hiking, and you wouldn't feel so alone in the woods," Gersh said.
"All our talks help facilitate our understanding of each
other," Win Chia 'O6 said. "Since we were such a diverse
group, we had people from different backgrounds and it really added to the experience."
Bonding among the participants was further encouraged
by activities such as massage circles. Julia Gayner 'O6 said,
"After a day of hiking with heavy packs on your back, everyone's muscles would be really sore
so we formed massage
lines every night
it really helped."
Plenty of unexpected adventures kept the trip exciting for
everyone. Gersh noted with a grin, "The most memorable part
of my trip was getting charged by a cow. We were walking
through a pasture where there were some black cows. I turn
around, and there was a cow that's just running at me. The
TrOOP leaders were all trying to chase it away." Luckily, this
close encounter did not produce any injuries. "The cow came
within two meters of me, spitted, snorted, and ran off," Gersh
said. Although jokes about bear encounters were also frequent
among TrOOP participants, everyone felt safe camping outside.
When asked how the program might be improved, Perez
commented, "If the administration would fully back it, it
could be done as a pre-orientation trip like a lot of schools do."
Currently, the program receives about $3,000 from each of the
colleges and asks each of the participants to pay $l2O, unless
they are candidates for financial aid.
Heather Jones 'O6 offered other suggestions for improvement. "A balance needs to be found between hiking and curriculum (discussion)," she said. "It's not possible to do a full
day of hiking and still have plenty of time for curriculum."
When asked whether the trip accomplished its goals, freshmen participants gave a unanimous yes. Joe Alberti 'O6 said, "I
truly think that this trip achieved what it had intended and well
I can say that I have formed friendships with
beyond that
such awesome people that I know will last for a very long time.
It was one of the greatest things that ever happened to me."

"I think the policy works well, or it has up until
this point," Downing said, adding that it also allows
the college to maintain the student's privacy.
Matt Wallaert 'O5 appreciates the college's treating its students as adults. "Personally, I'm not for
or against Internet piracy," he said. "The college's
piracy policy is much like the alcohol policy, in that
it allows students to make their own decisions and
to face the consequences for those decisions."
In Waellert's opinion, "One of the major issues
of piracy is volume. There is a rather large difference between someone who downloads a movie to
watch once in a small group and piracy on a grand
scale by people who are in it for profit."
The college reminds students that their activities on the network shouldn't keep others from
using network resources by tying up too much of
the bandwidth. The college's bandwidth shaper,
installed in the fall of 2000 has helped control the
volume of traffic on the college's network that goes
towards peer-to-peer file sharing.
Karl Heideck 'O3 takes a very different view of
the situation. "Most people stealing music off the
Internet have deluded themselves into believing
that it's a victimless crime, when it's absolutely
not. Record companies are already gouging the
artists we like. If we download their music for free,
we're hurting them even more."
Heideck combats what he sees as unfair prac-

tices of record companies towards artists by "making every effort to buy CDs directly from the musicians who make them."
The Motion Picture Association of America says
the industry loses in excess of $3 billion annually in
potential worldwide revenue due to piracy, but
does not break that number down to show how
much of those losses are due to internet piracy.
But is this an exaggeration proliferated by a corporate America that fears losing power over its
consumers? Swarthmore computer science professor Robert Richardson also warned against taking
the MPAA's stance at face value.
"In general," he said, "people accept the use of
the word 'piracy' to describe all kinds of copying of

copyright-protected materials, simply because
industry organizations of copyright holders insist
on using the term. In point of fact, U.S. copyright
law carves out significant protections for friendly
copying of music by way of the Audio Home
Recording Act of 1992, to take just one example. In
other words, sharing music isn't 'piracy' and we
shouldn't call it that just because the recording
industry wants to suggest that all such activity is
illegal
whether it really is or not."

Opponents say statistics don't prove
treatment possible for sex offenders
From EXPERTS, pg. 3
selves in the presence of children," Pedigo said. "But
there are also a fair number of people who, with psychotherapy, do not have to struggle with urges, and
can be around children."
The diagnostic criteria for pedophilia according to
the DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for
Mental Disorders) is met when "repeatedly for at least
6 months, a patient has intense sexual desires, fantasies or behaviors concerning sexual activity with a
sexually immature child" that causes "clinically
important distress or impairs work, social or personal functioning, or if the patient has acted on these
desires." The patient must also be 16 or older and at
least five years older than the child in question.
Phone or Internet contact, according to Pedigo, is
considered "acting" on these desires.
Pedigo said that psychological treatment combined with the legal process is the best way for society to react to sexual offenders. "If they are not convicted they almost never seek treatment," he said.
"Most don't benefit from incarceration, but the public
must be protected."
However, he said, "Research now shows that sexual offenders who successfully complete" treatment
specifically designed for sex offenders "are 30 percent
to 50 percent less likely to recidivate."
"They should be mandated into therapy and super-

vised throughout their treatment," Pedigo said.
Norman E. Friedman is not impressed with these
numbers. For the past 12 years Friedman has worked
as a private consultant for schools, day care facilities,
private corporations and religious institutions on
issues related to the sexual abuse of children. Before
that he ran a residential treatment center for emo-

tionally disturbed children.
Friedman, who often gives a lecture entitled
"Inoculating Your Children to Prevent Sexual
Abuse," contends that a 30 to 50 percent decrease in
recidivism rates is not enough. "I would not let any of
these people anywhere near my child," he said.
"I take a very rigid position towards treatment,"
he said. "My position is that there is no cure. There
are some beginning stages of work that can be done,

but that's as far as it goes."
"If a drug comes out on the market that they say is
a cure for something, they have to produce evidence
of this in what is called a longitudinal study," he
added. "They would have to prove that it works
through years of data before it would become
approved by the FDAA. And this for a drug. Therapy
is not a science, it's an art."
"Show me hundreds or thousands of patients with
a recidivism rate that's low or nonexistent, then you
would convince me," Friedman said. "There hasn't
been a study that's come anywhere close to doing
that."

Fiorvanti said the report from the Joseph J. Peters Institute
estimated that Boothe's "recidivism quotient is quite low, 14 percent." The recidivism quotient is the likelihood that an individual
will re-offend after treatment. The institute recommended that
Boothe enter an "offense-specific treatment program."
Fiorvanti then said to the court that Boothe had described having sexual contact with minors in his Internet conversations with
the police detective. But, Fiorvanti said, Boothe would testify that
these descriptions were part of his "fantasy world" and had never
actually taken place.
...

"In explicit detail he makes it clear that
he has had previous sexual contact
with minors."
Delaware County Asst. D.A. Bill Davis
Fiorvanti added a letter from Swarthmore College into evidence and said that, based on the letter, Boothe's "ability to return
to Swarthmore is dictated by sentencing. If he goes to jail he
won't be let back in."
Fiorvanti recommended Boothe be sentenced to treatment at
the Joseph J. Peters Institute instead of incarceration.
"Ivan Boothe is at a crossroads of his life," he said. "He's
thankful he was caught. He wants to be in treatment."
Boothe expressed regret for his actions to the court, and stated that he had been making progress in therapy.
Assistant District Attorney Bill Davis argued against a mitigated sentence, recommending "the standard incarceration."
Davis argued that the punishment was justified because Boothe
"was not only a consumer, but he took the second step to have
contact with children."
"In explicit detail he makes it clear that he has had previous
sexual contact with minors," Davis said, referring to a transcript
of the conversation with the police detective posing as a 15-yearold. "We can't trust that these are just figments of his imagination. I suggest they describe in specific terms a deviant sexual
behavior that is a danger to society."
Fiorvanti responded, "If there was anything on the computer
to prove he had any physical contact with a minor I suggest that
it would be before the court now. It's just not available in evi,

ST

dence."

After reviewing the evidence and deliberating for about five
minutes before the court, Judge Keeler sentenced Boothe to six to
23 months of incarceration. Thirty days of this time will be served
over 15 weekends in a Delaware County correctional facility, and
the remainder will be served through home incarceration by electronic monitor. This time will be followed by three years of pro-

bation. Boothe must also undergo treatment at the Joseph J.
Peters Institute for a time period the institute will determine.
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62 said that the college "wouldn't have a categorical decision one way or another" on Boothe's
eligibility for re-admission until they received a "formal request
to return."

Financial aid tries to meet rising tuition
A 2001 nationwide report by the nonpartisan
(U-WIRE) WALTHAM, Mass.
National Center for Public Policy has established what most college students and
parents have been saying for awhile: Higher education is just too expensive.
The report focused on a state-by-state comparison of college affordability
(among other categories) by comparing the 2000 statistics with those from 2002.
The report also noted the trend of large gaps among income groups in their ability to pay for college.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated similar findings, using more quantitative means. According to its report, the tuition component of the Consumer Price
Index has risen by 8 percent per year from 1979 to 2001 If the trend continues,
children born today will face college costs three to four times greater than current
prices. The report concludes that on average, parents should expect to pay twothirds of college costs through savings, current income and loans.
For those whose eligibility increases, financial aid in the form of grants can be
another option for assistance. This is also applicable to students whose change
of circumstance leaves them with a greater source or availability of income. A student whose siblings either leave or graduate while they are in college is given less
of a priority for financial aid.
"What was contributed to his siblings for their college tuition can now be spent
on the student," Giumette said.
One of the variables in a family's ability to manage, Giumette said, is the recent
decline in the economy. He said the appeal for greater aid has increased within
the last nine months, and added that Sept. 11 and the decline of the stock market have exacerbated the situation.

Rutgers professors analyze effects of sniper
Rutgers University professors commented on
how media and law enforcement agents are handling the Washington, D.C., area
shooting crisis, the sniper's motivations and the effect the spree is having on children in that community.
Barbara Reed, an associate professor of journalism, offered her opinions on
the ethical dilemmas facing the media in covering the attacks.
Investigators are welcoming the media attention and people have been
earnest about talking to the police, said Reed, who has been distressed with
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose's anger over the tarot card information leak. She said somebody must have thought the release of that information would have been helpful.
"If there was some real damage done, it wasn't articulated. Instead we get a
broad-sided idiot attack on the media," Reed said.
Jon'A Meyer, an associate professor in the department of sociology, anthropology and criminal justice at Rutgers-Camden, offered three suggestions on possible motivations the sniper may have.
Meyer said he might be mentally ill, believing he is on a mission from God or
he might be upset or angry with the government or an event. He could be angry
with an individual: President George W. Bush, a priest at a church or maybe a girlfriend. His condition causes him to act as a threat, she said.
Naomi Marmorstein, an assistant professor of psychology at Rutgers-Camden,
specializes in depression and anxiety in young children and adolescents. She said
there is no right way for the Washington area administrators and teachers to handle this situation because it is difficult to balance the students' need for safety
while trying to retain a sense of normalcy in their lives.
Marmorstein advised parents to continue with normal activities, but "Give an
extra hug before sending a child to school, an extra 'I love you' or give something
tangible maybe." She said it's important not to give into the children's fears and
let them stay home from school.

Coming elections weigh on women's issues
With Election Day drawing near, the outcomes of each
state's Senate race have a potentially strong impact on the future of the Supreme
Court and several key women's issues.
One justice is likely to retire during the remaining two years of the current Bush
administration term, which means the Senate will approve or reject the president's nominee for the Supreme Court, said James Hutter, associate professor of
political science.
Currently, eight states host Senate races between anti-abortion and abortionrights candidates, including lowa.
According to the lowa Right to Life Committee Web site, www.irlc.org, "removing
the protection of the law [as a result of Roe v. Wade] has combined with decaying
ethical standards, ignorance of the facts of unborn human development, and the
promotion of abortion as a solution to social problems by pro-abortion groups."
In the past, "human life amendments" have been introduced to the Senate but
have never passed. Such an amendment would be a constitutionally capable of
overturning Roe v. Wade.

New Sandler pic shows all you need is 'Love'

Latest Anderson-helmed film reveals comedic actor's sensitive side in quirky story
BY ESTER BLOOM

eblooml@swarthmore.edu

Sometimes it seems like filmmaker P.T. Anderson is one
of the handful of people in the world without even a touch
of ADD. His last two productions, "Boogie Nights" and
"Magnolia," clocked in at two-and-a-half and over three
hours respectively. Both films feature the grand scope,
spectacle and unabashed dazzling weirdness of a circus.
That P.T. Anderson's name echoes visionary P.T.
Barnum's does not seem like a coincidence. Anderson
likes his movies to be splendid and inscrutable, to be
talked about; and to that end, he will, if he must, rain frogs
from the sky.
So Anderson's latest endeavor, a romantic comedy
called "Punch Drunk Love," comes as a surprise. Neither a
decade-spanning orgy, nor a character study with Biblical
undertones, nor a gangster/gambling flick (like "Hard
Eight," Anderson's debut), "Punch Drunk Love" hardly
seems, at first, to fit in Anderson's oeuvre.
Except that it's so damn weird.
Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a soft-spoken awkward guy with seven sisters, his own fledgling company
and a whole lot of suppressed rage. At his sister's birthday
party, after breaking three windows, he confides to his
brother-in-law that he needs help.
His brother-in-law betrays him to his sisters; his sisters
pester him until he backs down. Desperately lonely, Barry
tries calling a phone-sex line and engaging the sex worker,
Georgia, in a conversation.
Even that backfires. The next day, Georgia attempts to

extort money from Barry. When he refuses, the head of her
operation, Trumbell (Anderson staple Phillip Seymour
Hoffman), sends his crew of blond hooligans to Barry's
house to teach him that you can't be a pervert and expect
not to pay.
Despite all this, Barry is soft-shoeing down supermarket aisles because he has met Lena (luminous Emily
Watson of "Hillary and Jackie" and "Breaking the
Waves"). Oddly drawn to Barry and just plain odd herself,
Lena is someone Barry can actually communicate with.
When she has to go to Hawaii for the weekend, he drops
everything and follows.
In most Hollywood films, characters fall in love for logical reasons. Personality trait A in Attractive Man matches or complements personality trait A in Attractive
Woman. Barry and Lena can't explain why they fall in
love, but when they lie in bed and share their mutual
desires to bite off each others' cheeks and suck on each
others' eyeballs, the chemistry speaks for itself.
Here, for the first time, Sandler achieves poignancy.
Not just as any character, but as his character, the
repressed man-child he's played for laughs and millions of
dollars since his SNL days. This film could do for him
what "The Truman Show" did for Jim Carrey. The two
men could even race to see whom the Academy deigns to
recognize first.
Picking Sandler was one of the many risks Anderson
took in making this film, and virtually all pay off.
Surrealistic touches, reminiscent of the Coen brothers,
balance out moments of painfully awkward realism. One
eerie song functions both as a theme and the entire score.

Adam Sandler and Emily Watson share a poingnant
moment in P.T. Anderson's "Punch Drunk Love."
Somehow, like the psychedelic swirls of color with which
"Punch Drunk Love" begins, everything blends.
Love saves Barry: it prompts him to action, inspires
him and ultimately redeems him. That's typical
Hollywood. But it's Anderson's brilliance that takes that
storyline and makes it into such a memorable, quirky film.

aural equivalent of the poor teenage couple the song

It would seem ridiculous to think that such sparseness
could propel an entire album, but it works miraculously.

Spoon is a direct band. After the release of their debut
album "Telephono" on Matador Records, they immediately made the jump to a major label, joining the roster at
Elektra Records.
Then, four months after the band dropped "A Series of
Sneaks," Elektra unceremoniously dropped them. But
instead of pouting and getting tied up in a legal mess,
Spoon went and released the EP "The Agony of Lafitte," a
two-song cycle which was an obvious, blatant criticism of
the way Elektra, specifically A&R representative Ron
Lafitte, had treated them. Forget about sending a kiss-off
to a former employer or burning bridges, this act was
blowing up bridges with a lot of dynamite.
On Spoon's return to an independent label (Merge
Records in early 2001), they managed to boil rock *n roll
down to its essence simply by titling their album "Girls
Can Tell." No other title will ever come close to conveying
such brilliance, as the band openly declared that music is
an outlet for solving relationships and then went and
wrote an album that lived up to this hype.
"Girls Can Tell" opened with "Everything Hits at
Once," featuring a slinky lounge keyboard line as the
backdrop for rolling over in bed expecting to find your
girlfriend and recalling how she walked out on you over
dinner last night. The album reached its pinnacle with
"Anything You Want"—the best song ever written. It's
about drinking and perpetually falling for your ex-high
school sweetheart, but that was irrelevant compared to the
number of keyboard hooks crammed into its two-minute
length; the melody was introduced by a swirling, staccato
keyboard, followed by a line in the lower end of the piano's
bass and then completed by a light, ephemeral flick of the
wrist at the top end of the keyboard. The most important
part of all this was the simplicity; no great musicianship
was required, yet Spoon displayed unparalleled genius for
having the capacity to write such a catchy song with such
restrained songwriting.
On the band's new release, "Kill the Moonlight," Spoon

THE PHOENIX

takes the minimalist approach that developed on
"Anything You Want" and the directness that had already
defined their career back into the studio, then ditches the
equipment to go out drinking. A rattling keyboard opens
the record as the introduction to "Small Stakes" as lead
singer/songwriter Britt Daniel sneers, "Cause it's alright

around, the piano, guitar and drum sounds sometimes
drop to be barely audible The band proves that such tenuous melodies can sustain themselves for 35 minutes, but
what really holds this record together is Britt Daniel's
chameleon-like voice. He sings in a muffled drawl that
threatens to come out like the southern accent one would
expect from a band hailing from Austin, Texas but ends up
sounding very affectionate, like the twenty-something
who keeps screwing up but can't be criticized because his
smile is just too damn charming.
It enables him to toss off lines about naive love ("I'm
not dumb, just want to hold your hand") and sentimental
longing ("Everything moves so fast, I should know it won't
last") without seeming coy or arrogant. It allows him to
turn "Jonathan Fisk" into a hurtling barn-burner about a
protagonist with a penchant for bar fights all by himself. It
lets him turn the end of "Small Stakes" into a darker '6os
Hawaiian pop song and allows him to bust out the human
beat box to provide the cement for "Stay Don't Go" so the
female vocalist can contemplate confession. With his
incredibly versatile voice, Spoon creates the most appealing songs with the smallest possible number of ingredients. It's an album of minimalism at its finest: short, sweet
and to the point.

Inflight Rock Band began as inflight, a small-time operation opening for a cappella gr
in the Ville. Capitalized anew, the group now hopes to sell out Madison Square Garden,
Challenging listeners to "Rock more, swarth less," Inflight Rock Band established itse
a major musical presence on campus last spring. Though its unofficial Web site describes
group as "a ragtag bunch of classically trained Swarthmore Honors students," Inflight
es to outgrow a strictly Swarthmorean label with upcoming shows in Philadelphia and
York City.
"Last year we were a student band that was at first shitty, then okay. But this year w
grown up. We've taken a step. We're actually making real music that people would act
like to listen to, not just because they're our friends," said vocalist, cellist, analog synth|
er and guitarist Joel Blecher 'O4.
Inflight has no front man or single creative personality; each band member contribut
the writing of every tune. Joining Joel on vocals and guitar, Matt Rubin 'O3 brings a dl
endearing arrogance to the band's tuneful potluck. Aaron Goldman 'O3 picked up bas!
semester. He can tame an unruly sax as well. Providing a plethora of percussive beats is
Hoffman 'O4, the man behind the other men.
Yet these are but cursory glimpses. Who are Inflight? Why do they walk among us?
Though Ross was unavailable for comment at press time, The Phoenix tracked down
Joel and Aaron for separate phone interviews.

For the midterm of Rock 'n Roll History,
all you need to know about Jeff Buckley is
that his only studio album was "Grace," he
did an amazing (some say "transcendental"
or "angelic") version of Leonard Cohen's
"Hallelujah" (yes, Rufus Wainwright did
one too with some nice reverb, but it wasn't
as dynamic), and he died young like his
father, folk artist Tim Buckley. On May 29,
1997, the junior Buckley mysteriously
drowned in Mississippi, just weeks before

n

out, and Buckley unpacked his full voice
and emerged as a solo artist with "Live at

Sin-e" (EP 1993) and "Grace" (1994).

This second post-mortem Buckley
release made me a little nervous. In 1998,
Columbia released "Sketches for My
Sweetheart the Drunk," an awkward mix of
overly polished tracks and the roughest of
rough cuts. The studio assembled the bloated double album from demos and unofficial
recording sessions. Buckley would have
likely altered or cut many of these recordings from the final album. The CD also
included a screensaver and other pretty but
pointless enhancements. The pictures of
Buckley's lyric notes felt much more
voyeuristic than celebratory.
I wasn't sure if I was ready for another
peek into Jeff Buckley's unreleased tapes.
Hal Willner, the producer of the album, was
also hesitant. He wrote in the liner notes of
the compilation, "I am usually suspicious
of this kind of thing, but I decided to take it
on because I knew that this project or a similar one would be done eventually whether
it was authorized or not, so I told myself
that Jeff would have wanted me to do it."
Willner selected 11 solid and complete
tracks for inclusion. The studio overdubbed
two songs to flesh out some of the band
instrumentation. Bill Frisell added guitars
to the quiet cover of "Satisfied Mind," and
jazz rock outfit Sex Mob contributed catchy
but cool sounds to "She Is Free." The
album's production and release happened
at Knitting Factory Records, a division of
the New York City jazz and rock institution
The Knitting Factory, where Lucas and
Buckley performed and recorded four of the
songs. Ultimately, Willner said he was satisfied with the integrity of the project, and I
tend to agree.
"Songs to No One" offers a new starting

point for Buckley fans. Listeners can trace
the evolution of Buckley originals and
notable covers. Later versions of "Mojo

Pin" retain the

12

song's dreamy organ-like

sounds and dripping guitars but allow his
singing to step forward. The shuffling guitars, prominent harmonica and backup
vocals on "Grace" disappear in subsequent
recordings, eventually creating the lush
album version that showcases Buckley's
voice so well. The nascent version of "Mojo
Pin" trails off into a snarling guitar riff.
This album can stand on its own as a disparate but impressive collection of the
shaky, talented collaboration between
Buckley and Lucas. The album showcases
early versions of Buckley's "Grace" and
"Mojo Pin." Willner includes gentle covers

of Port Wagner's classic "Satisfied Mind"
and Edith
s "Hymne a l'Amour," providing a peek into Buckley's emerging guitar work and vocal range. The album also
includes twangy numbers, including the notquite-country title ballad "Songs to No One"

and the bluesy "Harem Man" jam. The
romantic "How Long Will It Take" and "She

Is Free" highlight Buckley's sultry but sturdy voice. The later tracks of "Cruel" and
"Malign Fiesta (Soul)" kick up the rock edge.
The album stays true to the audience,
borrowing mostly from live performances
and practices. Unlike "Sketches," these
tracks existed outside the recording studio.
Though Buckley and Lucas did not intend to
release the songs at the time, they performed them. The tracks of"Sketches" seem
to be the actual songs to "no one."
For the essentials, try "Grace" (you can
trace the evolution of the title track, "Mojo
Pin," and "Hallelujah" through several
other Buckley releases). For something a little more organic and intimate, try "Live at
Sin-e," complete with coffee bar applause
(including an Edith Piaf lullaby and powerful Van Morrison cover, with skat sounds).
For arena rock and riffs, try "Mystery
White Boy Tour (Live)" (which includes a
playful and wistful Nina Simone cover, a
massive Big Star cover complete with guitar
climax, the edgy "I Woke up in a Strange
Place," the accusatory "What Will You
Say?" and the ominous "Hallelujah/I Know
It's Over"). Try "Live At Olympia" for a similar mix of tour recordings with a little more
French banter. To read a lot about Buckley
and his father, check out "Dream Brother"
by music journalist David Browne.

you listen to the Inflight Rock Band, you hear the honesty of what it is to be self-contrai

critical people trying to write honest songs, and it's an interesting product.
I think we're really enjoyable to listen to. We're all very dedicated to the idea of me
but we don't want to cheapen that idea.

Who's that on the unicycle?
BY SUE CHEN

schenl@swarthmore.edu
Some people come home from Great Britain
with false accents. Some come home with Big Ben
keychains. James Kalafus 'O5 came home with a

dream.
Someday, he would own a unicycle.
On a visit to England three years ago, Kalafus
stopped by a small town and saw, in the basement

of a clown supply store, what was to become his
trademark.
"We were juggling and screwing around with
all their different toys and they had this unicycle
up in the corner. I think it was for 80 or 90 pounds;
I was like, 'okay, I don't have that much money
right now...but nevertheless, someday I will buy a

unicycle,'" he said.
The promise went unfulfilled until Kalafus
came to Swarthmore and saw Stefan Gary 'O2 riding one. "When I saw him riding around, it just
rekindled my interest in the idea of getting a unicycle," he said.
Kalafus bought a unicycle from eßay for $9O last
November and proceeded to teach himself to ride.
Mertz, his freshman dorm, was the ideal place for

a novice unicyclist.
"The walls were the perfect place to just be able
to hang on and just ride back and forth. Actually, a
lot of the people on the next hall over got really
interested too, and we'd just unicycle around for

Jason

Perini Phoenix Staff

the evening," he said.
For Kalafus, riding the unicycle was very much
an impulse. "My life is pretty whimsical whenever
I get an idea; unless I see something against it, I
would just do it," he said.
He gradually moved on from the halls of Mertz
to the rest of Swarthmore's campus, and the sight
of a man riding a unicycle has become a familiar
one. Now, almost a year after he began riding,
Kalafus can simultaneously juggle and ride and
can easily pedal up the hill from Sharpies to

Parrish.
"The hills are a lot of fun, actually. I really love
just starting on top ofParrish and just flying down
the grass as fast as I can go," he said.
Kalafus has simple advice for those who want to
start riding. "Get a unicycle and start. You just
have to do it. It just takes some time and you have
to teach your muscles what they're doing and eventually it'll be second nature."
The idea of riding on one wheel seems to be a
contradiction of the laws of physics. The unicycle
evolved from the penny-farthing bicycle, which
has a large wheel in the front and a smaller one in
the back, according to The Unicycle Page
(www.unicycling.org). Since its appearance in the
late 1800s, unicycling has branched off into different disciplines such as unicycle hockey and mountain unicycling.

Of

course, riding

a unicycle comes with its

share of spills. But because the unicycle is so light,
Kalafus explained, it always slides out from under
the rider, which allows him to land on his feet.
Unfortunately, Kalafus accidentally dented the
rim of his unicycle a month ago and has not been
able to ride since.
"I'd actually like to get a whole new unicycle,
something much more bad-ass," he said. Kalafus's
dream unicycle, with its bigger wheel and grind
plates, would allow him to perform a variety of
tricks.
"I could bunny hop like a mad man; I could
grind out stuff—it would be out of control," he said.
This past summer, Kalafus's skills caught the
eye of a group of traveling performers and the
manager asked him to join the group to take his
unicycling and juggling skills on the road.
"I guess that's one possibility, but I don't really
know," he said.
Since last November, Kalafus has become somewhat of a campus celebrity. Few actually know his
name, but everyone, it seems, knows of him. "I love
the attention I get," he confessed.

Inflight Rock Band to play Philly, New York
star is that they can only see first three rows... That happened at the Dismemberment Plan
show. Being a rock star for a night turned me into a little bit of an asshole.
Joel: It was definitely our best show...There were so many people in the crowd, and we
had a lot of energy. We hung out with Travis, and he was really nice to us and really
encouraging. I felt like we gave Detachment Kit [the other opening band] some music to be
reckoned with. After we were done and they got up, I feel like we definitely held our own.
It was really cool. It was real rock show.
Next week you're playing at CBGB's in New York City. Should the audience expect
anything different?
Matt: Definitely. We all have very different visions of what should go on. Ross's logic is
we should just go into this venue and play our songs. I've played CBGB's before, with my
high school band, but we got booed off the stage. There's a definite aesthetic and style, but
we didn'tfit it. We played after a band called Negative Hate and before Stereo Mud. And
we were called The Milk Tradition. Come on, right? They hated us.
Your ultimate goal should be getting the people in the venue to enjoy your

music...Altering songs to make them more palatable is fine. We're going to play a little
faster, a little harder. One way for us to achieve that is to play more hard rock-oriented
songs. When we play Rose Tattoo the week after that, we'll play a Joel Blecher ballad that
would literally get you banned from CBGB's for the rest of your life.
Joel: We have some new songs and new surprises. We've changed a lot since last year.
We've gotten a lot more mature, and we've been practicing religiously. Just by virtue of
that, I think we've gotten infinitely better. I'm confident we're not going to get booed off
the stage. It should be a lot offun.

Aaron: We're not so much changing the music that we play, but it's definitely going to
be the type of set you would expect at CBGB's. Anyone who goes will really enjoy it.

Will Inflight Rock Band ever get too big?
Matt: Inflight can never be too big. When Inflight sells out Madison Square Garden in a
year and a half, it still won't be too big. The name Inflight shows where it's going. We want
to bring it to as many people as possible, and we want to live the rock star life.

Welcome to Nextdoorland
BY ROSS HOFFMAN

khoffmal@swarthmore.edu

If one were to listen consecutively to "Underwater
Moonlight" and "Nextdoorland," the two most recent
albums by the Soft Boys, the fact that 22 years have passed
between their original releases would not be immediately
apparent. Although the new record (which I don't feel
quite right calling a 'comeback album') is far from sounding dated, its sonic similarities with its predecessor are
fairly remarkable.
Coming hot on the heels of last year's reissue of 1980's
"Moonlight," when that album was finally recognized as
the seminal masterwork that it apparently was (don't

worry, I had never heard of it at the time either),
"Nextdoorland" manages to brilliantly recapture its
vibrant guitar sound (with that full trebly tone that is
seemingly absent from the scene these days), powerful pop
sense and lovely harmonies.
Their rightful place is with the great guitar bands
from the Ventures to Television to Guided by Voices.
Emblazon it all you like with qualifiers like punk, psychedelic and sugary; at its essence the Soft Boys ken is pure
rock *n roll. Normal rock 'n roll, one could almost say,
except that the slightly askew lyrics of iconic front man
Robyn Hitchcock give one pause (as sincere as he sounds
when singing, "I adore you like a Japanese captain"). Their
classic quirkiness is significantly more toned down on this

new album, though it still comes through in the lyrics and
on tracks like "Strings," the album's only real flirtation
with dissonance. But from the bouncy, almost-instrumental
opener "I Love Lucy," which is more fun than a Nick-atNite marathon, to mellower numbers like "The Pulse of My
Heart" (which flirts with sappiness) and the pure-pop goodness of instant gems "Sudden Town" and "Lions and
Tigers," that quirkiness is transmuted into nostalgia.
They may have become, as Hitchcock says, "grown-up
and cuddly," but the Soft Boys stop short of living up to the
negative connotations of their name. The appropriately
titled "Nextdoorland" offers most of what anyone would
want from a rock record while remaining perfectly friendly and familiar.

A new exposure for Williams in 'Photo'
BY AMANDA

BROWN-INZ
abrownil@swarthmore.edu

Whenever Robin Williams decides to do a movie in
which he does not play a goofy yet lovable man who makes
the world a little brighter, he should be applauded. And
when that movie also has cinematic merit, there should be
some prize, a Cracker Jack box or something, to let him

know he's done good.
For "One Hour Photo," I'd give him an extra-big prize
for effort. His performance as Sy the Photo Guy, a lonely
clerk at a one-hour photo development counter in

SavMart, is both eerie and touching. Despite Williams's
gripping performance, however, the movie is not great.
Not bad, but neither insightful nor exciting enough that
I'm particularly glad to have seen it.
Sy is a lot like Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver," a man

trying to make himself visible by lashing out against what
he thinks is wrong with society. But this is where the
movie's greatest fault lies: it lands just short of giving the
thrill that the ending of "Taxi Driver" provides. Not that
I'm a real blood-and-guts person, but the buildup to the
ending just ended up being a letdown.
Perhaps I was misinformed by the advertisements,
because I went into the movie expecting to see Robin
Williams turn psychopathic. The truth is, "One Hour
Photo" is an art film masquerading as a thriller. The
strengths in the movie lie in the visual motifs, in the
bland whiteness surrounding Sy and ever-present photographs, in Sy's dream and fantasy sequences with clearly symbolic meanings. The portrayal of an invisible man
is much more interesting than the thrills that fail to

14

thrill and probably deserved to be delved into more
deeply.

It is clear that Sy is desperate for human contact from
the beginning of the movie, when he is overly attentive in
serving a boy and his mother who are picking up their
photographs. But when we see that he makes an extra set
of the pictures and puts them in frames on his night table
and pastes them to his living-room wall, the eerie part
kicks in. Sy's obsession focuses mainly on one family, the
Yorkins, whose son is eight or nine years old. The father is
Michael Vartan, who gave a charming performance as the
teacher of Drew Barrymore's dreams in "Never Been
Kissed." The little boy, Jake, is played by Dylan Smith. He
hasn't had much previous exposure, but after his breakthrough in this film he is sure to be seen in something like
"Stuart Little 4" or "Spy Kids 3."
Sy fantasizes that he is a part of the Yorkins family as
"Uncle Sy" and begins to overstep the customer/photo guy
relationship by going to Jake's soccer practices and "accidentally" running into the mom, Nina, at the food court of
the mall.

Throughout this, Sy remains somewhat deserving of
our sympathies. We observe his neat, empty house and
complete lack of human contact outside of work, and it
becomes clear that Sy merely wants to be part of a family.
His groping for companionship gives him the graining
habit of repeating people's names constantly, as if saying a
person's name would bring him closer to them.
When Sy is fired from his job due to his "bonus"
prints, his fragile sanity begins to fade. And when another SavMart client's photographs reveal that she is having
an affair with Will, Sy becomes outraged and maneuvers

one of the photographs into Jake's birthday photos for
Nina to discover, but he is disappointed by her lack of a

reaction.
This is where the suspense part of the movie kicks in.
Leaving work on his last day, Sy swipes a Cut-Co knife
from a display case. It is clear that Sy is angry, and that
having lost his job, the constant in his life, he is liable to

do anything.

It is at the end of the movie that the realization comes
that the movie is more of a character portrait than an actual plotted film. It's not an uninteresting movie, and as I
said, it has cinematic merit. But just rent "Taxi Driver,"
"American Beauty," or "Death of a Salesman" —it'll be a
better experience, and you'll save seven dollars.

Every musical act has one or two rare live performances that are nearly impossible to find in a
commercial market. People in search of these jewels of the music world nowadays turn to the
Internet and file sharing programs to locate these
songs. Usually, it's easy to locate a decent-quality
version of a desired file.

But the Recording Industry Association of
America believes this kind offile sharing is in violation of copyright laws, and if it has its way, file
sharing will stop being a benefit of the World Wide
Web, and that should not be.
Currently, the RIAA is engaged in a prolonged
legal battle against numerous file-sharing services.
Police have been stepping up raids against those
who host copyrighted digital media on network
servers. This includes students who have movies,
music and software on the Swarthmore network.
Congress has passed bills that are redefining
acceptable use of digital media, including a recent
one that, if passed, would require federal enforcement of encryption on any and all digital media
storage.
Yet if corporations were to truly pursue the letter of the copyright law as the legislative bodies
wish, they would most likely end up prosecuting

and shutting out an overwhelming majority of
their consumer base. File sharing is a übiquitous
and seemingly unstoppable habit for millions of

people. Swarthmore students hooked up to the net-

work automatically have access to hundreds of
copyrighted files on other students' hard drives at
any time, without even using a third-party filesharing systems. Widespread prosecution could
not occur without a massive overhaul of Internet
services personnel and more important, major
revisions to existing individual privacy rights.
Even at an institution like Swarthmore that in
theory has the power and the right to monitor all
traffic on its network, Information Technology
Services candidly admits that to monitor even a

small fraction of the material on the network
would require a tremendous investment of time
and energy that would leave them unable to
address more pressing technical support questions.
The RIAA is not interested in this excuse
though, and they have been known to take matters
into their own hands. By sending out query hits
and downloading their copyrighted materials from
remote hosts, copyrighted property owners can
pursue legal challenges against those possessing
their materials. Their latest initiatives include

constructing CDs with copy-protected technology
so that the songs cannot be encrypted into digital
computer files. These techniques have increased

the sense of alienation between the consumers and
the recording industry, especially as the tradition
of allowing consumers leeway in their use of copyrighted material is a long one, from the practice of
allowing radio stations to broadcast music on the
airwaves for free to older laws allowing people to
make mix tapes of music for their personal use.
Such practices helped rather than hindered the
ability of artists and distributors to make a living.
File sharing does not necessarily diminish
music sales. The audio and video storage on computers are still too clunky to replace recorded
media anyone who's heard MP3-quality and CDquality audio knows the drastic differences
between the two. And nothing quite compares to
watching a major motion picture on a big-screen
theater with surround sound.
The RIAA must stop trying to curtail this swapping offiles and find other ways to encourage consumers to buy

what they download. Already,

record labels have begun to include bonus DVDs
and enhanced CDs on new commercial releases.
Hopefully, the RIAA will realize the benefits of the
Internet, instead of attacking it.
In the meantime though, we'll keep swapping
those MP3s.

LWDC fosters campus democracy
Dear Editor:
Randy Goldstein's article re-examining a living wage warrants a response from a member of the campaign who would be
greatly affected by a living wage. We applaud Goldsteinfor his
determination to question the legitimacy and credibility of the
Living Wage and Democracy Campaign because checks and
balances are healthy vessels for scrutiny. The challenge is
accepted as a blessing.
We are certain that most fellow community members are
aware that LWDC is rooted and governed by democratic principles and in the same perpetual spirit that the Framers envisioned, "WE The People!" The campaign invites everyone on
campus to participate and contribute. We encourage all to view
our web site at http://www.swatlivingwage.org as we have
shared our research, documents and history. In contrast, can
we truly claim that Swarthmore is governed by democratic
principles? Are community members invited and encouraged
to participate in committee of their choice?
Goldstein alleged that LWDC is annoying to employers and
an insufferable blow to employees as well. Workers' struggle
for decent wages is not a recent phenomenon. Sweepers have
sought adequate compensation as far back as 1776. Sweepers

have always been taken for granted despite the significant and
important services they render. Joining together to form labor
unions was the primary solution to low wages and improvements in the workplace conditions. Of course, nickel-and-dime

wages are no indication of respect or appreciation for the art
of sanitizing, beautifying and restoring order and cleanliness
to the campus. Students may be unaware that Environmental
Service Technicians are evaluated on our care of working with

hazardous chemicals and that we must be trained and experienced in using a wide variety of floor-care equipment. I'm sure
students are not annoyed by the fact that they work and live in
a clean and healthy environment.
The lack of adequate compensation forces many low-wage
workers to secure more than one job or sometimes three jobs in
order to take care of their family's basic needs. In the absence
of a labor union, the LWDC serves as an instrument of hope
that some day soon the low-wage workers will be the beneficiaries of their own labor and not the victims of exploitation.
Sweepers say: beware of those who will dazzle you with
speech and who pride themselves as experts and masters of
.

what makes the economic system. Change comes, to be sure,

when we shift corporate or governmental policies, elect more
accountable leaders, or create effective institution alternatives. But change comes when we stir the hearts of previously
uninvolved citizens and urge them to take their own moral
stands. If enough people put their minds and bodies into this
cause, a living wage will become a global phenomenon, and all
will win.

To the Ivy League and back
BY SARAH COHODES
scohodel@swarthmore.edu

Imagine strolling down Magill Walk and passing dozens
of athletic men wearing khakis, button-down shirts, and
slightly dirty white baseball caps. The women you pass are
less strikingly uniform, but all seem to have made their
major purchases at Banana Republic and J. Crew.
Welcome to Princeton University. I was cultureshocked when I spent some of my break visiting an old
friend at the alma mater of Ralph Nader, Donald Rumsfeld
and my first celebrity crush, Dean Cain.
Some things are essentially the same: college kids
socializing and studying, construction, parties that smell
like sour beer. But even these are wrapped in a swankier
context. You think Swatties have privilege
go to

Princeton!
Case in point: the parties are similar to Olde Club.
Drinks in the basement, dancing on the first floor, overly
warnf everywhere. But their parties are on "The Street," a
collection of mansions-turned-eating-clubs (expensive
alternatives to the dining hall). The dozen or so clubs host
weekly parties with professional DJs and lights.
The main differences, though, are not in the social scene,
the campus buildings or the number of famous alumni. The
intellectual and political character of Princeton is far from
the norm at Swarthmore. Granted, my view is jaundicedby
my short stay and my Swattie outlook.
Still, there is a different attitude to intellectual pursuits
at Princeton. Nobody says things like "hegemonic discourse" or "the dominant patriarchal paradigm." Beyond
not using the sometimes-annoying academic jargon,
Princetonians aren't discussing the. ideas behind the jargon that so envelop Swarthmore conversation. Even
Princeton students notice their lack of casual intellectual
banter and examination of topics like identity politics,
privilege and power dynamics. Recently, some students on
a Princeton committee wrote an open letter to the administration lamenting the lack of out-of-class intellectualism
«

THE PHOENIX

and asking the administration and student body to do
something about it. Here at Swarthmore, I love watching
earnest Intro, to Philosophy students and cynical seniors
alike engage in lively discussion now and then between
rounds of misery poker.
What do we have that Princeton doesn't? For the most
part, I think, we have self-selection out of the Ivy League.
Though some of us have regrets, most of the student body
here chose Swarthmore because of the nature of an excellent liberal arts college. We chose an intellectual atmosphere. We chose peers who are political in a very different
way than Princeton students.
At Swarthmore, students put their efforts into political
action. At Princeton, campus politics are in an argumentative stage. Princeton is still struggling over the unwieldy
LGBT versus Queer and facing some opposition to any
non-straight presence. While Swarthmore is papered with
signs declaring "War in Iraq is so 10 years ago," a
Princeton club recently sponsored a debate about the war.
I did not see signs for marches, protests or phone calls. In
Princeton's focus on organized debate, they lose what
activism. Though
Swarthmore students love so much
we have arguments in letters to the editor, campus groups
spend most of their time on community action and politi-

cal change, not argumentation. Princeton students seem so
caught up in who has moral authority that no one acts on
either side of an issue.
The reverse issue affects our campus. Swarthmore has
many options for activism but not necessarily for debate.
With our dual drives for action and consensus, we can
trivialize, opposing viewpoints. There is value in hearing
the opposition and coming to a conclusion or compromise.
We don't need to truck in Princeton conservatives, but we
could see more ofThe Ring and debates between organizations like College Democrats and Republicans or JATO and
Im Tirtzu. Then, campus groups could clarify their positions and strengthen their actions.
I'm glad I'm at Swarthmore, but that doesn't mean we
are perfect. We could truck in some hot Princeton boys ...

REFUGEE RAMON: Help me, Leftist Louis! All I did

Castro's human rights abuses one-tenth as much as you
criticized Bush or Sharon, maybe the international community would take some interest in my suffering.
FIDEL: You get a punch! Now it's off to the gulag

LEFTIST LOUIS: That was good work, Fidel. Most of
the time I approve of anti-government dissent, but that
Ramon fellow went too far. Not only did he neglect to
thank you for his health care and education, but I

think he's affiliated with the Miami Cubans. Those ani-

FIDEL: That's right. The fact that thousands of
refugees risk their lives trying to flee Cuba should not
be seen as a sign that my regime is unpopular. It's a
sign that evil conservatives are somehow brainwashing my people.
LEFTIST LOUIS: Fidel, I have a confession to make.
Your anti-American posturing, Papa Smurf beard, and
rugged machismo have overwhelmed me. I have fallen
in love with you!
FIDEL: What did you say? Like emigration, independent journalism or the reading of unlawful books,
homosexuality is against the law in Cuba. You will go
to the same gulag as Refugee Ramon, you counter-revolutionary pervert.

thought that as a Communist, anti-American dictator,
you would have more respect for my freedom.

equality, you are much worse than the U.S. government I used to criticize. Every time I break a rock in
the gulag, I will imagine it is your head.
FIDEL: Ha ha ha! That's a lie and you know it. As
long as I continue to defy the "imperialism" of the U.S.,

Admit it: randomness
reigns in sniper case
I think, at this point, most
everyone probably agrees: this

sniper business is downright
bothersome. What's most bothersome about it, however, is not
the fact that innocent people are

dying, which seems to be the
predominant focus. Innocent
people are always dying. In all
sorts of situations. A mother and
her five children all innocently

died when some crackhead
torched their house in Baltimore
because the woman was trying

MORGHAN HOLT

to reign in the rampant crime
that plagues her neighborhood
Ruminations
streets, her children's playground. A despicable, devastating tragedy, to be sure, yet somehow more palatable than the sniper deal. Innocent people
have died by the thousands in the Israel-Palestine clash. We
recognize these deaths as tragedies as well and might even
mourn them, yet we somehow find solace in the fact that they
are not entirely random.
,

Instead of admitting that we don't
have a clue, we adamantly assert that
the sniper is linked to Al Qaeda.
Random: In the recent release of the cinematic version of
Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, the primary detectives agonize
over linking the most minute aspects of murder victims' lives
together so as to understand the killer's selection criteria.
With this they hope to be able to inform themselves well
enough to stave off the next slaying. The audience derives a
certain degree of reassurance from the fact that, ultimately,
the murders do have some connection and are not entirely
random. Born of the mind of a maniacal madman, sure, but
at least they're somehow bound to each other, however flimsy the logical line may be. Likewise, it's more comforting to
us, as an audience, to watch news stories detailing the gruesome and tragic consequences of pissed-off boyfriends who
brutally murder their girlfriends.
At least they have a reason; at least we can sort of make

sense of it for ourselves as the investigators detail the linear

evolution of the crime.
The fact that the sniper's victims seem to be selected
entirely at random (that's the point, right?) has everyone
grasping at straws, conspiracy theorizing to try to make
sense of what is going on. The fact is, we don't know and,
more bothersome still, neither do the cops. So we make up
possibilities for ourselves and the authorities dish them out,
trying to establish some semblance of control over the situation, trying to make it seem as though the Innocent team's
got some knowledge that gives them power over the man
(woman?) behind the gun. Instead of admitting that we don't
have a clue, we adamantly assert that the sniper is linked to
Al Qaeda. He has to be. That makes it make sense. That puts
his random murdering into perspective. He's Arab and he
hates us, so he's killing us.
But the innocence of the victims is not, as the papers are
making it seem, what makes this particular blood binge
more heinous or newsworthy than the next. We're comfortable with people flipping out and killing others, not happy
when it happens, but comfortable, because the killers are
obviously nuts. The killers have an established persona and
motive, something we can draw on to explicate the source of

their actions. Without a tangible personality, without a
character sketch like that of the Red Dragon murderer
(where it's pretty obvious that the dude's fucking bonkers)
for the elusive sniper, we're creating the schema for ourselves, when what we really need to do is recognize the futility of the fabricated fictions and have the full-service dude
pump our gas. Hiding behind the allegorical baby blanket of
our myths won't change reality: this sniper is a nutcase (a
calculating good shot of a nutcase) and he's still very much

at large.

Dissenters should urge caution
Simply protesting war proves more annoying than effective
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
This afternoon, a whole bunch of Swarthmore students will be protesting the possibility ofWar with Iraq.
Then, over the next few weekends, a whole bunch of
Swarthmore students will be traveling to various cities
in order to participate in protests against the possibility of War with Iraq. Every time, these same students
wonder why the protests are ignored and why their representatives in Congress seem to ignore these cries
against the actions of our government.
I think there's a really good reason for that, and I
think that the protestors just don't want to admit it to
themselves. These protests over the last few months
have gotten completely out of hand, and they increasingly feature messages that are inappropriate considering the current international situation facing the

United States today.
It started last year with protests against the War in
Afghanistan. It has continued with what seems like
monthly protests against the IMF and the World Bank,
and it's going strong with continuous protests against a
possible war against Saddam Hussein. But no one

wants to hear it anymore.
Protesting the War in Afghanistan clearly did not
appeal to most people's patriotism, despite what the
signs around campus proclaim. After Sept. 11,
Americans wanted those responsible for the actions to
pay, and in the end, American aggression in
Afghanistan resulted in important advances for human
rights with the removal of the Taliban. Additionally,
the loss of civilian life was minimal compared to other
uses of force similar to this one. Casualties on the
American side were few, and in the end, the protestors
were made out to appear un-American.
Now, it's happening again. Each week features
another protest against the possible War in Iraq in a different city up

and down the Eastern Seaboard.

When political helplessness hits
BY MAYA SCHENWAR
mschenwl@swarthmore.edu

Skimming the Congress roll call for the resolution on
outrage, for the most
a cry of outrage
part, directed at myself. Rod Blagojevich, the representative I voted for in the Illinois governor primaries, had
voted to back Bush's right to unilaterally send thousands
of troops into battle. "But how could he?" a whiny voice
in the back of my head protested. "I voted for him!"
The idea that, in a democratic system, constituents
should expect their elected representatives to vote,
well, representatively, doesn't seem like such a wild
one. But even though half the country is wary of war on
Iraq, both the House and the Senate wholeheartedly
endorsed it. Should we follow the Hillary Clinton logic
that by voting for war, they're actually helping us avoid
it? Maybe I'm a pessimist, but I go for the more straightforward explanation: we, the people (you, me, our professors, parents, dogs, aunts and stepcousins) have no
control over our country's (or, more accurately, our
president's) actions, whatsoever. After I read that roll
call, my illusion that the real power resides in the voters, spun since second-grade mock elections and hanging on by a thread ever since, finally fell flat.
No, this op-ed is not a plug for direct democracy, or
anarchy or the post-nationalist-post-structuralistsocialist-small-state model. It's simply a recognition of
helplessness, that rare brand of helplessness that much
of America must be feeling right now. It's not futility or
depression or loss of control. It's the realization that the
small bit of control you thought you had was, perhaps,
never really there.
My sociology professor cancelled our regular class
the day before the Senate
discussion two weeks ago
voted yes on the Bush Doctrine to provide time to talk
about Iraq. We talked about authority, and how it's constituted. The president has the right to declare war. How
many things do most of us have the right to "declare"?
When the president decides that we, the United
Iraq, I uttered

October 24, 2002

However, those citizens choosing not to exercise their
no longer care to hear the protests. Too
many gatherings against wars and banks have caused
the public to view the protestors as annoyances that
will go away after a few hours. Plus, with many people
in support of the Bush administration's plans to
remove Hussein from power, the protestors are often
scorned upon as well.
This lack of respect for protestors though means
something else must be done. Is a War on Iraq necessarily the best possible path to take in order to pursue
George Bush's plan to fight terrorism? I don't think I or
anyone else can definitely answer this question right
now. It might end up that a war which results in the
removal of Saddam could be the best course of action.
However, there is not enough information available to
fully support peace or war.
Instead, what today's protestors should be pushing
for is more responsibility on the part of our government. It would be downright stupid for the United
States to fight against Iraq without support from our
European and Asian allies who have the most to lose
if the turmoil in the Middle East spread as a result of
U.S. aggressions. Additionally, if Iraq is really willing
to let United Nations weapons inspectors into the
country for a really thorough examination of the
country's weapons capabilities, this would obviously
be a better step than launching into war.
But the protestors must convey this message of caution and not the one of unconditional peace that does not
really appeal to the majority of Americans today. These
protestors should spend their energy urging our community and the country as a whole to find ways to tell their
congressional representatives that the United States
should not wage war until we have established that there
are no other options left and have built up an international coalition to fight Iraq. The American public would
be much more responsive to this kind of message, and
who knows? Maybe our government would be too.
right to protest

States, declare war on Iraq, all of us are automatically
part of that "we." I'm an American citizen, and thus,
President Bush and Rod Blagojevich can speak for me,
even if I disagree with them more than I disagree with
pop-up ads, Sonny Bono and the Britney Spears LookAlike Contest put together.
So, how to separate ourselves out? How to take ourselves out of the "we" that declares war on Iraq? Will congregating in a protest ring in Central Park do the trick?
I'm not so sure. Over the course of last year, I went to antiwar protests, determined to make my voice heard by
someone besides my roommate and my mom. The
protests were fun. Amid calls of "Whose streets? Our
streets!" it's hard not to believe the world is listening. But
each time, after the shouts ceased and the gaping street
puppets were dismantled, I went home to stale peanut butter and jelly, a New YorkTimes with a scant blurb on page
34 about the protest, and a country still at war. Protest
doesn't take us out of the "we," and the vast majority of
the time, it doesn't let us change the "we's" actions.
Still, this afternoon at 4:30 I'll be donning a radical
cheerleading outfit and screaming my head off at the
SPAC Peace Rally. (Parrish Steps rain or shine: be
there.) Why? Because protest gets the word out. Protest
if little ones
makes waves
on the "we's" radar
screen. If nothing else, it's a personal action: when I'm
speaking out, I can hear myself, and I'm reassured that
I exist outside of the "we" that defines me on a national
stop writing op-eds, stop
scale. If we
the little we
calling our congresspeople, stop complaining to each
other, for gosh sakes, then we forfeit that last bit of
agency that lets us speak, even if we can't declare.
What does all this mean? Is it silly to persist, even
though I probably won't get anywhere, even though the
"we" doesn't have to listen? Maybe. But in this time
when we're forced to recognize our helplessness as voters, I like to remember that I can still act, even without
authority. Maybe it means no one will listen. (Rod
Blagojevich sure didn't.) But at least, if I'm loud
enough, maybe someone will hear.

Conservation the

be directly consuming the
energy we've purchased, bu

making an important invest
ment in a renewable energy
source). Of course, it's no
original to suggest energy con
servation as a way to drive down oil prices, and thereby encour
age the ousting of oligarchies in the Middle East, as well a
curbing pollution, slowing global warming and saving money.

The single greatest action we can take
against war is to conserve energy.
In his October 20 New York Times column, Thomas
Friedman wrote that if we drive down the price of oil through
conservation, Iraq won't be able to derive its income from its
natural resources; it will move to its human resources. To
access the talents of its citizens, it will need to open doors of
opportunity with freedoms of speech and the press, educademocratic freedoms, and a vast
tion, science and trade
revision of governance. If this happened, the Iraqi people
would oust Hussein themselves, and we could avoid the
United States playing the role of an imperialist police force.
Friedman asks, "Which was the first and only real Arab
democracy? Lebanon. Which Arab country had no oil?
Lebanon. Which is the first Arab oil state to turn itself into a
constitutional monarchy? Bahrain. Which is the first Arab oil
state to run out of oil? Bahrain."
Locally, you may recently have signed a postcard in
Sharpies supporting the Sierra Club's Freedom Option
Package campaign, which a number of Swatties are working
on. This campaign asks Ford to incorporate existing fuel-effe-

ciency technology into its fleet. The reason Ford is not using
fuel-saving technology it already owns is because it believes
that raising the up-front cost of its vehicles will deter buyers,
even though buyers would make up the difference in saved
gas over three years. The point of relevancy here is that the
activists tabling weren't asking us to improve air quality,
they were shouting, "Reduce our dependence on foreign oil!"
As citizens of the world's most powerful and most energyconsuming nation, we wield a great deal of responsibility. The
single greatest action we can take against war is to conserve
energy. Lucky for us, there is a group on campus devoted to
teaching us how and monitoring our progress. Last year
Earthlust and its allies succeeded in making a case for the college to purchase 2.5 percent of its energy from wind power,
hoping for this percentage to increase over the years. Part of

the agreement with the administration said that Earthlust
would conduct a Campus Energy Efficiency Campaign to help
offset the cost of buying wind power. So, in accordance with
the plan, the first Dorm Storm will take place October 28;
members of Earthlust will be going door-to-door, to make the
campus aware that fluorescent light bulbs are better than
incandescent ones, hanging clothes is better than using the
drying machine, and a computer on automatic sleep is better

than a screen saver. They will provide details about how
reducing the amount ofhot water used for showers and washing clothes, turning lights off when you leave a room and
keeping windows closed in winter make a serious difference
in both energy use and cost.
It's uncanny that an idea like conservation reaping a
wealth of returns could be true on so many levels. Personally
speaking, in fourth grade, I learned to define energy as the
potential to do work. I'm only coming up on 20 years; there's
a lot of work to be done. I'm going to save every ounce I can.

Recycling through competition
BY KEEFE KEELEY
kkeeleyl@swarthmore.edu

First, Earthlust wants to thank all of you: faculty,
students and anyone else on campus who has ever
thrown a recyclable piece of waste into a blue bin
instead of in a gray trash receptacle. Granted, it's not
the most challenging thing you've ever done, but it is a
noble and good cause nonetheless. With your simple
wrist flick, you have contributed to a wonderful cause.
Here's a fact: One ton of recycled paper uses 64 percent
less energy, 50 percent less water, 74 percent less air pollution, saves 17 trees and
creates 5 times more jobs ■
than one ton of paper products from virgin wood pulp.
Recycling is easy and it
benefits business, the environment and everyone who
breathes. But does every-

the contest. There is some sort of prize involved if
Swarthmore comes out on the top of the other colleges
and universities participating, but surely the lofty ideal
of saving the earth by simply sorting your paper scraps
from your banana peels is enough for you.
Be warned though, one banana peel in a paper recycling bin is enough to send the whole treasure chest
into the common trash. Any trash that is not supposed
to be in a recyclable bin will cause that entire bin to be
added to the regular waste.
If you have any confusion about what can be recycled,
look a little closer. Earthlust will soon have signs near
many bins that outline

everyone who breathes.

one do it? Every Sunday,
the United States wastes nearly 90 percent of the recyclable newspapers. This wastes about 500,000 trees.
Recycling may seem like an old-school environmental
issue, but there is not much debate that we could still
do a lot more.
You may have seen a banner or two around campus
that call the words "Rush to Recycle" to your attention.
"Rush to Recycle" is a recycling challenge sponsored by
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection that our college is participating in right now.
The challenge is to have the highest percent increase in
the gross weight of material recycled over the course of

what is recyclable. One
bin is for paper and card-

board, and the other is for
glass, aluminum and
plastic. Please check that
any plastic you wish to
recycle has the number
one or two inside the little recyclable arrow triangle. Also, a little liquid left in a
bottle or can is not a big deal, but clinging Campbell's
soup or pumpkin paste needs to be rinsed out.
It has been said that there are two types of people in
this world, those who recycle and those who don't. I
don't know if that is true, and I don't know who said it,
but I do know which one of these types of people holds
my respect. I challenge any person who does not recycle to come up with a solid reason why recycling isn't
worth your effort. Recycling is something all of us can
do every day to make the world a better place, so bring
it to the bin.

No double standard between Israel, Iraq
Security Council resolutions. Those

BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu

In his opinion piece "War
Against Iraq Violates All Reason,"
Kent Bassett argues that the United

States applies a "double standard"
in its dealings with Iraq and Israel
in that Israel, like Iraq, is in violation of United Nations Resolutions
but the United States is not threat-

passed under Chapter Six deal with
the peaceful resolution of disputes
and entitle the council to make nonbinding recommendations. Those
under Chapter Seven give the council broad powers to take action,
including warlike action, to deal
with 'threats to the peace, breaches
of the peace, or acts of agression.'
Such resolutions, binding on all

the Israeli-Arab conflict comes

U.N. members

Bassett's argument ignores
major and obvious differences
between Iraq and Israel (Israeli
democracy, to name just one), but it
flies in the face ofinternational law.
Responding to a similar claim of a
double standard, the Economist
noted on October 12: "The U.N. distinguishes between two sorts of

Resolution 242 calls for a "just
and lasting peace in the Middle East
which should include the application of both the following principles:

withdrawal of Israel armed forces

the sovereignty, territorial integrity,
and political independence of every
State in the area and their rights to

under Chapter Seven."
Even more importantly, Bassett
misrepresents U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242, describing it as calling only for Israeli withdrawal from

Resolution 242 by itself. Other
agents of action in the region also
need to decide that they are interested in negotiating a "just and last-

Okay, I know that most of us, myself included, have

who practice these virtues in all aspects of their life.

BY RACHEL BURSTEIN

Come on, what's not to love about an
all-California World Series? Good baseball,
mild mannered season ticket holders, and
sunny skies to boot. Southern versus
Northern California. It doesn't get much

four guys, all very much immersed in the
baseball game. My heart beats wildly.

understand why those "thunder stix" of
inflated noise are necessary, or even why
West Coast dwellers can't seem to spell
according to standard usage. But so what if
the Rally Monkey, whether gorilla faced or
stuffed or displayed on the scoreboard at
Edison Field, makes baseball purists
cringe? Certainly Gene Autry's baseball
cowboys of the west give us something to
root for. A bunch of overachievers vying
for the sport's top honor where the triumvirate of Nolan Ryan, Rod Carew and
Reggie Jackson once failed hell, it's reminiscent of "Angels in the Outfield." So,
why does no one seem to care about these

write an article about, I think.

10:34: Hallowell's basement is playing
host to three World Series watchers. One is
wearing a faded Yankees cap, but I ask his
baseball preference in the vain hope of fulfilling my mission. It turns out he's a visitor to Swarthmore, and strangely, really
does like the Yankees after all. The other
two don't care one way or the other about
the outcome of the game. One guy gives me
a vague hint about someone he thinks
might be an Angels fan. I set out to find
this person, and others like him.
Series watchers: 3. Angels fans: 0.

Maybe, perhaps, I've found true fans of
California baseball. But when I tally up the
viewers, I've got two Mets fans, a Phillies
fan and a Brewers fan (and no, that last
category is not an oxymoron). No Giants
or Angels fans to be found. I decide that my
visit shouldn't be in vain, so I ask about

better than this, folks. Quit rolling your
eyes. How can you not like those Disney
wonder kids from Anaheim? For 42 years
their underdog status has been confirmed,
but now, in their first World Series appearance ever, the Angels get to atone for the
sins of previous playoff performances in
1979, 1982 and 1986. Baseball writers live
for this stuff. Sure, the people at Angels
games come clothed entirely in red, as if to
antagonize the enemy like seasoned bullfighters. Yes, we East Coast fans can't

loveablelosers?
Or the San Francisco Giants for that
matter. Yes, there are a few wrinkles, but
if you can forgive Anaheim's gimmicks,
you can get past how the Giants deserted
New York after the 1957 season (hey, how
many ball clubs does the Big Apple really
need, anyway and how can you not love
Willie Mays?). You can even get over the
fact that the team plays in a stadium
called Pac Bell. (But at at least 20 degrees
warmer than Candlestick Park, how bad
can it be?). And the players, themselves.
Surely they are worthy of support. You
might not like Barry Bonds, but don't tell
me you're not watching every time he
steps up to the plate. So why in heaven's
name does this World Series have the lowest viewership in the history of televised
ratings? Yes, that's right folks, it's worse

than 1997's Cleveland-Florida matchup.
Cleveland-Florida. Where have all the fans
gone?

Scouring the deep dark depths of baseball fandom at Swarthmore, this reporter
set out to find them. It'll be easy, I thought.
I'll go to the first floor Mertz lounge or to
Willets basement and even ifI can't find an
Angels fan right away, there'll be a Giants
fan, fading San Francisco hat perched precipitously atop the head, mouth forming a
snarl at Angels shortstop David Eckstein's
I'm-five-foot-six-and-a-bundle-of-energy
cuteness. There'll be that fan, that collection of fans, even, willing Barry Bonds to
hit one out of the park. Surely the Giants,
ranked number one in game attendance
figures on a percentage filled basis and
number two in exact numbers with an
average crowd of 40,888 for the 2002 season,
could claim at least one Swattie among
their enthusiasts. But it was not to be, as I
soon found out.
Game two of the 2002 World Series
began at 8 p.m. last Sunday, so that's when
my quest for someone who actually cared
about this Series began. But after a trip to
lounges in Willets, Mertz, Dana, Hallowell,
Wharton and Parrish, I had counted a
bunch of sorta-maybe-when-they're-winning type fans of the Giants, and absolutely no fans of the Angels. You think I'm kidTHE PHOENIX

8:20: Willets' basement is completely
deserted. There is a .note on the television
alerting any potential fans that it is "broken, and will be fixed by Friday." Just in
time for game six, as if anyone gives a

at first glance like a television. It turns out
they are playing Snood.

8:30: Mertz's first floor lounge has a
working television and the game is on. I
begin to get excited. Perhaps one of the five
guys putting off the work that's accumulated from break in order to watch the
game is rooting for the Giants or the
Angels. I ask about team allegiance, but
the responses are lukewarm. Zach Rodd 'O6
says he "doesn't really like the Giants." I
ask if that's because he's an Angels fan,
but it turns out he just wants the Yankees'
playoff loss to the Angels to be validated by
an Anaheim win in the World Series.
Likewise, Tom Madore 'O6 is cheering for
Anaheim because as a Red Sox fan he is
pleased that the Angels "beat the shit out
of the Yankees." Jesse Taylor 'O3 says he's
"kinda rooting for San Francisco because
Barry Bonds deserves a ring" and one girl
stops by long enough to ask who's playing,
then declares herself a fan of the Giants
because

"San Francisco's

cool." Then

'O6 arrives and tells me she's
a Giants fan. I nearly die. "You're kidding,"
I say. Nelson assures me she is quite serious. But then Nelson leaves the room and I
am forced to reevaluate her commitment. I
am thus sulking when the conversation
shifts to Fox baseball announcer Tim
McCarver's broadcasting skills as compared to those of ABC football analyst
John Madden and the discussion begins to
get animated. As a bottle of vodka is
brought out, Adam Schlossman 'O6 tells me
that he doesn't "really think the crowd for
baseball would compete with Monday
Darcy Nelson

Night Football." Deciding that I'm probably not going to find an Angels or Giants
fan in what is quickly becoming a drunken
gathering, I decide to leave.

10:02: In the Dana well trailer I find
Sally Hall 'O6 watching the game, accompanied by a friend who is not watching the
game. If she is dedicated enough to be
viewing baseball without another seasoned sports fan around (and in the trailer
to boot) maybe she has a special attachment to the Angels or Giants. I begin to get

excited again. But Hall tells me that she
doesn't "care a whole lot about who wins."
She's rooting for the Giants "but only
because they're in the National League,"
like the Atlanta Braves, Hall's team of
favor. Surely there must be someone on

Wharton's basement and see a television

10:57: I decide to take one last look in
Mertz, and sure enough, a sizeable crowd
has gathered, as much to drink alcohol and
eat pizza as to watch the game. Maybe
there is an Angels or Giants fan among
them, I think. I ask around. Charles Small
'O3 tells me he has an Angels shirt. I nearly die. I have found my Angels fan, I think.
Who has an Angels shirt, if not a fan? But
it turns out he's not actually a fan; he's
just from the Anaheim area. "It's about
which California is better, southern or
northern," Small says. Funny that I can't
seem to find a spokesman for either.
Series watchers: 7. Angels fans: 0.
Giants fans: 0.
11:46: The fifth floor Parrish lounge
contains two guys watching the game, but
they are engaged in a conversation and
seem not to want to be bothered, so I leave
them alone. After a game nearly four
hours long during which I've tried to find
one, just one, lone Angels or Giants fan,
I'm tired. I watch the remaining minutes
of eighth and ninth inning heroics, and
then go to sleep. The next day I return to
Mertz and find that Schlossman was correct and that the Monday Night Football

S-P-I-R-I-T Tough break: Garnet
In homage to Josh Loeffler, last weekend I road-tripped it
to a football game. Well, perhaps the actual destination was
the Cloondocks and Niagara Falls, but I did watch a half of
football. Live and in person. And despite my sport enthusiasm, it is rare that I actually attend a game that doesn't
include Swarthmore as one of the teams.
After a few days of boozing it up and gambling in Casino
Niagara, I trekked out to Fairport High School with Cloon to
watch her brother's final
season home game.
A fantastical experience, I
was consumed in a sea ofred
with buttons, cake, clappers
and the like. Considering I
attended a high school that,
like Swat, didn't have a football team, it was definitely
an experience. All the moms

charge of umbrellas and seat
cushions, with many donregular

The Centennial Conference's website, www.centennial.org, called Saturday's contest with Johns Hopkins
a "four-star matchup". Playing at Johns Hopkins, the
Garnet adjusted quickly to a much faster game on the
turf, focusing on controlling the ball defensively.
Though Johns Hopkins was able to penetrate through
the Swat defense on several occasions early on, goalkeeper Catherine Salussolia 'O4 handled each shot, ending up with nine saves on the game.
Thanks to both teams' strong defensive play, the
game was scoreless at halftime. But both teams came
out with renewed offensive intensity in the second

"The second half had tremendous possessions for
us," head coach Amy Brunner said. "[We] controlled the
ball and found many opportunities with the wing play

And despite my jaded and blase view of such things as

moment in time, I actually wished I was a boy and played
football, most specifically for the Fairport Red Raiders. The
guys on the sideline started each kick off with an advanced

Fantastic.
The day had its disappointments as well. The football
itself was what you would expect. I don't think I've ever seen
so many fumbles or dropped passes in a quarter offootball. It
was too wet for the dance team at halftime. And let's hope
that the cheerleaders were saving their moves for the next
day's competition at the middle school. But all in all, I had a
good time.
And after returning to the likes of field hockey on
Cunningham Field, I wonder at the spirit surrounding FHS's
football community. Don't get me wrong, Swat hockey has its
fair share of dedicated fans. That Scott works that video camera quite well. And the games that Ingrid's mom makes that
tasty banana bread are the best. And of course, the
boyfriends make it out to many a game.
But I want a sideline that has noisemakers and wears all
garnet. I want chanting and cheers. And I think a crazy group
of guys that yell at the refs would be nice as well. I want tailgating and balloons and little ball girls running around.
One of my favorite Garnet Tide memories is attending the
first round NCAA Championship game that featured our
women's basketball team vs. Gwynedd-Mercy. Tarble
Pavilion was packed, and shirtless boys were painted with
letters. I've never seen so many fans making so much noise
at Swarthmore. But it was a rare special occasion.
Yet, the Raiders fans in Fairport do it for every game.
They make the special effort for every player (including the
exchange student) for every game.
Why don't we?
And don't tell me it's because you have too much work to
do. Or that you have rehearsal, or band practice, or your
WSRN show, or there's that protest you need to make ifrto.
Between today and Halloween, there are six home games,
and that's not counting the club sports. Over the next three
weeks, there will be three home games against our archrival
Haverford. Swimming has its home opener on Nov. 9. Both
basketball teams have their tip-off tournaments right before
Thanksgiving. There's definitely at least one game that will
fit into your schedule.
So put on your Swarthmore sweatshirt and bring your
friends down to the fields. Maybe grab that cowbell that's
been collecting dust on your shelf. And, without a doubt,
there is at least one girl on your hall who owns a lipstick that
could be interpreted as garnet colored that you can use to
paint your face with.
If the Cloondocks can do it, so can we.

It was one of these crosses which was headed in by a

make a definitive call on the forward's controversial
move, the goals Counted.
With less than two minutes to go, Forbes tied the
game at two off a pass from Tanya Hahnel 'O5, sending
the game into overtime.
"We've gone into overtime on four occasions this
season, and sometimes we just get so excited that we
allow them to possess the ball," Brunner said. "When
we lose that first possession, we go on the defensive

right away."
Bay Path attacked offensively for the first three minutes of the overtime period, but Swat's defense stopped

each shot attempt. After one attempt, Salussolia found
Forbes upfield with a powerful punt.
Forbes manipulated the ball around the sweeper and
pounded it past the keeper to win the game for the
Garnet 3-2. "Now that we are right up there with the top
teams, we have had to build up our confidence in those

situations," Forbes said.

"Catherine has one of those personalities where she
wants to win the game and she makes that happen,"

Brunner said. "As soon as she got that ball, she said,
'l'm getting it to Ele and she will score'. They controlled
the ball for the first three minutes, but we scored and
walked off the field with a play that lasted five seconds."
Wednesday's win was followed by a tough 1-0 loss to
Mount Holyoke on Thursday. Despite the loss, however,
the Garnet's record remains above .500. The victory
over Bay Path broke the program record for most wins
in a season, and with two games remaining, the team
hopes to finally achieve an "Over the Top" record.

advantage, scoring their first goal 20 minutes into the
game, but Swat came alive after the goal and pushed the
ball up the field with aggression. A run down the left
wing by Jessica Zagory 'O5 got the ball to feet of Katey
McCaffrey 'O4, who took a hard shot at the left post. The
keeper was able to get her hands on the ball, but could
not stop it from crossing into the net.
The second half began with the score tied 1-1 and
both teams raring to go. It was the Wildcats who capitalized first with a questionable goal. On the goal
"Catherine had made a diving save to her left, had the

"Regardless of how we do in these last two games, we

on Wednesday they face Haverford at 3:30. "We are
expecting two really tough games, but we have a really
good chance of winning both of them," Forbes said.
"We can't wait for these games," McCaffrey added. "I
expect that they will be the most intense yet. I really
believe that we will play our best soccer in the last two
games of our season."

Women's x-country takes third at Seven Sisters
With the Centennial Conference

Championship looming on the horizon, the
Swarthmore women's cross-country team is

capture the Seven Sisters crown was Joko

Men's soccer drops
pair over fall break
BY JIM DALTON

jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

After a blowout victory against the Chargers,
of Lancaster Bible, the Garnet Tide rolled into
the fall break facing powerhouse teams
Franklin and Marshall and Tufts. The Tide were
blanked in both games, losing 4-0 to Tufts on the
road and getting narrowly edged out by
Franklin and Marshall in the last minute of
play, 1-0. Despite the back-to-back losses, the
Tide feel strong and upbeat heading into what
should be a very exciting and competitive final
stretch of the season.
In the game against Tufts last Tuesday, Oct. 15,
the Tide came roaring out of the gates, surprising
the Jumbos early on. The Garnet dominance was
short-lived, however, as the team grew tired trying to match up with the talented Jumbos.
"Well, against Tufts, we came into the game as
if shot out of a cannon" commented captain
Brendan R. Moriarty 'O4. "I think we really surprised the Jumbos. However, as the game progressed, our players fell victim to fatigue because
playing such a skilled team requires a lot of
effort."
Jumbo Matt MacGregor scored his first of two
goals in the 18th minute to give Tufts a 1-0 advantage. Then, Todd Gilbert notched the-first of his
two goals in the 37th minute of play to give Tufts
a 2-0 lead at the half. The Jumbos added scores
late in the second half on counterattacks, with
MacGregor and Gilbert scoring in the 80th and

85th minutes respectively.
The Garnet, who had no answer for the
MacGregor-Gilbert combination, took chances in
the second half by bringing their defense further
up the field and into scoring position, but they
did not profit from the aggressive play. The
Garnet were outshot 13-4 in the match, with keeper Reuben Heyman-Kantor 'O6 recording 6 saves
in 90 minutes of play.
This past Saturday, Oct. 19, the Tide hosted
Centennial Conference rival, Franklin and
Marshall College, who came into the match vying
for the top spot in the conference. Playing
inspired soccer, the Garnet hung with the
Diplomats throughout the contest. But in the 89th
minute of play, Diplomat Eric Marshall curved a
direct kick off the far post for the game-winner.
Garnet keeper Heyman-Kantor turned in a solid
performance in the net, recording 11 saves. But

the Garnet feU to a 5-9-1 overall (0-5 CC) as the
F&M Diplomats improved to 6-8-1 (5-1 CC).
"We played our best soccer of the season up
until the end when they converted a free kick,"
Moriarty explained. The shot was tremendous,
the sort of thing you couldn't do much about.
That's the nature of the game, you can play a
team even for 90 minutes, but in a split second,
anything can happen, and it can feel out of con-

trol."

"They scored on a free-kick that I am 110 percent convinced the guy will never ever reproduce
in another game. We are just not getting the luck
we deserve when we are able to outperform our
opponents,"

said midfielder Nick Graham 'O6,
who was recognized on the Centennial
Conference Weekly Honor Roll.
Against both high-caliber opponents, the Tide
used an altered formation, bringing the second
forward back into the midfield to help defensively and in the transition from defense to offense.
Moriarty commented that the coaching move was
very "necessary because both Tufts and Franklin
and Marshall are very skilled teams."
Moriarty is confident that the team is coming
into its own heading into the final stretch.
"Finally the team is really coming together. In
we brought intensity, determination, and team play that has been sporadic
and lacking throughout much of the season," he
said. "The exciting part about our schedule is
that the home stretch of the season has us playing the best competition."
The Garnet's game against Gettysburg, which
is ranked No. 3 in the nation by the National

the last two games

Soccer Coaches Association of America, has been
rescheduled for Sunday Oct. 27, and will give the
Garnet a chance to derail a national powerhouse.
The Tide will have another opportunity to make
some real waves with a win over last year's
NCAA Division 111 champion Richard Stockton,
who they play in their final game of the year,
Nov. 4, on the road. But of course, the game to
watch is on Saturday, Nov. 2, when the Garnet
Tide take on archrival Haverford for area bragging rights.

Graham summed up the team's outlook for the
remainder of the season: "We still have a lot to
play for, namely our pride and our record, and of
course we have the much-anticipated match
against Haverford, which I am sure we will win,
making us the hottest team on campus."

mercial. Sunday and game two? NFL for me, baby.
The weird thing is, I don't even really
miss the game all that much. Used to be,
the playoffs rolled around and I was glued
to the television, absorbing the tension of
each pitch, going breathless with every
knock of the bat against the ball.
Nowadays, I am content to watching the
highlights the next day on Sportscenter,
tuning in every once in a while to catch an
at-bat, watching the score roll by on the
Fox Sports Ticker.
I felt guilty about not watching the
World Series at first. But then it hit me.
Why should I blame myself for my disinterest in Major League Baseball? This sport
has done nothing in my lifetime to reach

fact, the organization that runs the highest
level of America's pastime has done the

exact opposite. Major League Baseball has
taken the sport that once represented all
that was pure and good in America, and twisted it into an unfriendly,
greedy empire that acts as though it can do no wrong.
Well let me tell you something: it is exactly that attitude that makes me
care less and less about this sport. Join me as I give all of you four good reasons why you do not have to watch baseball anymore. (For those of you
wondering what happened to the six pack of reasons; well, we all get a little

roughly 1 a.m. now, but can't anyone think of a way to speed up the game?
I know, part ofbaseball's beauty is the fact that the game is not governed by
a clock, and the game is left alone to determine a winner at it's own pace.
But does that pace have to be so slow that I find myself dozing off in the middle of the third? Simple rules changes would help here, guys. Batters do not
need to readjust their cup, gloves and helmet between each pitch.
Commercial breaks need not be so long that I can write economics papers
before the next pitch is thrown. And for the love of Pete, please bring back
the bullpen cart; I do not need to see Rich Garces waddle out to the mound
in roughly an hour. The fact that MLB has not caught on to the fact that the
sport is losing fans because of game speed is mind boggling. Want to make
sure the youth of America keeps watching, guys? Adjust. The ADD generation is quick to change the channel.
2. The Management Issue: Wow. Where to begin here? The logical place
to start is with Bud Selig, I guess. Hands down, this man is the worst commissioner in professional sports. Not only is he an ex-owner, and therefore
always on the owners' side, but his vision for the sport seems about as
myopic as Mr. Magoo. To put it simply, the most recent ideas in order to
popularize the MLB have been bad
very bad. Let's recap. Baseball in
Florida? The Marlins and Devil Rays are at the bottom in attendance.
Baseball in Colorado? Altitude makes a mockery of the sport. Contraction?
Ask the folks in Minnesota how this one went over, Bud. In conclusion,
there is absolutely no reason to believe that Bud Selig can take baseball to
new heights in the twenty-first century. In fact, there is no reason to believe
that Bud Selig can keep baseball going into next week.
3. The Steroids Issue: Sick of this one? Well, I can't blame you, but the
fact still remains that baseball has become a smorgasbord of home runs,
each one of them causing fans to question the legitimacy of the hit. It is simply impossible to watch a game these days, observe some musclebound
freak launch a rocket into the upper deck and not question whether the
player is on the juice. The issue is not going to go away either. The steroid
testing policy states that tests will be administered next season to establish
whether or not a steroid problem exists. If the percentage of players using
steroids is below a "problem level," the testing will cease. Do you think I am
a moron, Bud!? Do you? This is the stupidest policy since the rugby team
was put in charge of alcohol education. Do you think that I don't see what
is going on here? Most ballplayers are dumb, yes, but not dumb enough to
get caught when the tests will be for one year only. I mean, does anyone else
see this? I feel like I'm on crazy pills!
4. The Fox Issue: Ok, ok, this is a short one, but a good one. Does anyone
else hate Tim McCarver? Is it just me or is he the worst broadcaster ever?
The personality of a toad, the vocabulary of a fourth grader, and not one
viewer remembers him being any good. In short, you have an ex-journeyman catcher with little on-air skill broadcasting the most important games
of the season. That makes sense. And, boy, does it make me want to tune in.
Of course, why should it? Nothing else in baseball does.

Meg Woodworth fights for possession during Swarthmore's game against Muhlenberg on Tuesday. Woodworth leads the Garnet Tide with eight goals and 17 points on the season

Tide edge Mules, improve to 3-1 in conference
is paying off now."

BY DERRICK WU

With only three weeks remaining in the regular season
and a difficult conference schedule ahead, the Garnet Tide
(7-6, 3-1 CC) took one step closer towards the Centennial
Conference playoffs by defeating the Muhlenberg Mules
(10-5, 2-3 CC) 1-0 in a battle of wills on Tuesday.
Playing in front of their home crowd, the Tide jumped
out to an early lead eight minutes into the match when for-

ward Helen Leitner 'O4 knocked in her fourth goal of the
season. Midfielder Heather Doyle 'O4 sent a hard shot from
outside the circle, and Leitner capitalized off the rebound.
"It was a team effort," Leitner said.
The lone goal proved to be the only offensive output the
team needed that day, as goalkeeper Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3
and the stingy Tide defense shut out the Mules for the
entire 60 minutes.
"That was a big conference win," head coach Kelly
Wilcox '97 said. "The players really stepped it up."
After the team suffered its third double-overtime, 1-0
loss of the season on Sunday against non-conference foe

Chestnut Hill, Wilcox was ecstatic to see her team respond
positively two days later: "This match is a turning point
for us. The mental stuff we focused on earlier in the season

The Tide, who boosted their record to 5-1 when they
scored in the first half, dominated the Mules throughout
the game. The team applied constant pressure on
Muhlenberg goalkeeper Josephine Fasolino by initiating
the attack with Meg Woodworth 'O3 from the left side, and
Leitner- posing an ever-present threat cherry-picking on
the right. With the defense forced to respect Woodworth's
ability to create her own shot, the Muhlenberg defense

left the middle and right sides exposed for Doyle and

Leitner.
"Our offense played one of its most cohesive games of
the season," Doyle said.
Although Swarthmore dominated much of the game,
they barely outshot Muhlenberg 12-1 L The most potent
threat posed by Muhlenberg came when freshman sensation Kristin Bruschi ripped a shot in the circle with 14

play of Doyle and Woodworth helped inspire their teammates and maintain the intensity of the game. "Heather
has been playing amazing- she's our leader in the midfield.
Meg sets the standard for desire and attack."
The Tide have five games remaining on their regular
season schedule, all conference games. The next two games
are pivotal, since they will be facing Centennial
Conference top dog Johns Hopkins (9-5, 4-1 CC) and confer-

ence contender Washington.
"We have really big games coming up. Washington beat
Johns Hopkins today, so each team in the conference has
at least one loss," Leitner said.
The seniors, in particular, are relishing the opportunity to take on Johns Hopkins this Saturday, since the Blue
Jays narrowly defeated the Tide 1-0 two years ago in the

Centennial Conference Championship. "I have a personal
vendetta against Johns Hopkins," Doyle said. "We've been
in all of those games [we lost over the past two years]. It's
going to happen for us this year."
"It's definitely a big game this Saturday. We want to
avenge our loss," Leitner said.
The rest of the season, then, hinges on these next two

minutes left in the second half. Nelson-Lee made a kneejerk kick save, and the defense killed Muhlenberg's second
chance opportunities by quickly clearing the ball.
"Kate was solid in goal," Wilcox said, although she
admitted, "there were a few scary moments."
