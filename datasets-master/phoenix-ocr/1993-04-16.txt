on the path from
Parrish to Sharpies. The rally was
precipitated by slander found recently on desks in McCabe thatlisted
names of two students whom the
graffiti claimed were infected with
the HIV virus.
Graffiti has weighed heavily
on Swarthmore's mind lately. Several offensive desks were sanded
andrevarnished in Cornell, and two
especially telling "witticisms" were
copied and distributedall over campus to raise awareness.
Last week, more graffiti was
discovered that referred to a Phoenix article claiming that four to six
students on campus had HTV. The
graffiti gave the names of two students, stating they were among the
supposed four to six. The Phoenix
article refered to in the graffiti contained a misprint. The article had
meant to say that 4-6 students had
HPV and it had been mistakenly
printed "HIV". The health center
says it doesn'tknow ofany students
on campus with HTV.
The graffiti was sanded, and
six groups quickly organized
Wednesday's rally to raise awareness
of AlDSphobia
and
homophobia at Swarthmore. The
groups were theAlliancefor Sexual
Orientation Rights and Awareness
(ASORA), The Lesbian Bisexual
GayAlliance (LBGA), AidsAction
Alliance (AAA), Survivors, Safer
Sex workshop facilitators, and the
Safer Sex Video Group.

considered AlDSphobia or
homophobia an aberration that afflicted only a few frustrated deskscrawlers. Mostconsideredit deeply
ingrained in the atmosphere and
outlook of much of the campus,
though, according to ASORA member Mary Helen Dupree, there are
only "a few people here who are
very openly homophobic or
AlDSphobic." Nevertheless,
Dupree clarifies, "a lot ofpeople are
shelteredfrom these issues and don't
want to deal with them...that's the
real problem."
"It's so clear on this campus
that there's an attitude of 'tolerance'," adds Rebecca France, "but
that attitude is so provisional and so
contingent on people not asserting
themselves."
Some Safer Sex workshop facilitators said they noticed that"during workshops it's very clear that
people are very uncomfortable with
issues of homosexuality andAIDS.
They don'trelate therisk of getting
HIV and AIDS to their own
lives...The ignorance around this
issue is shown by the writing on
McCabe's desks—that people think
they canprotect themselves by staying away from certain people."
The facilitators are trying to
get their workhops run during orientation, but have encounteredhesitancy and resistance from the administration.
The Safer Sex Video Group is

video that will be shown April 23rd

volvespersons under the influence ofalcohol.
The Committee will be examining the
system of"sanctions" and punishments currently in place for violators of the policy.
One specific target for examination is
the policy that "assistance or rehabilitation"
programs may be required in addition to or
substitutedfor other disciplinary actions. The
goal of the committee is to identify on- and
off-campus options for these programs.
Also under study is the College's policy
of enforcement, especially in light of recent
incidents in which Swarthmore Borough Police cited students (both on and off campus)
for alcohol violations.
Another concern the College has is with
individuals with drinking problems. In the
past, education and prevention activities in
the College community have consisted of
training peer educators to conduct seminars
throughout the college. However, this was
not done this year. The Committee may decide to resurrect and "institutionalize" these
programs, according to Gross.
The first step, according to Gross, will
be communicationwiththe College community to determine the needs and attitudes on
campus. There will probably be an invitation
for written commentary in addition to a Collection addressing the issue. Input will be
specifically requested from Public Safety,
Worth HealthCenter, and RA 's in addition to
the general appeals for participation.
Although the Committee is going to
"move quickly" to make recommendations,
no significant changes will be seen before
extensive discussion with the College community. The first decisions will probably not
be implemented until next fall.

.

On Thursday, April 8, theAlcohol Policy
Review Committee met for the first time to
review the college's policy on drinking. The
policy is under review, according to Dean
Bob Gross, to comply with a federal law, and
because the college reviews its policy periodically anyway.
This meeting of the committee, Dean
Gross noted, is not due to any particular
incidents or any "alcohol crisis" at Swarthmore. In fact, he says, it should be remembered that "Swarthmore is not a major party
school" and any alcohol problems we have
are minor, especially when compared with
those at larger schools.
One aspect of the policy which is being
reviewed is Swarthmore's compliance with
federal law. At the moment, the Alcoholic
Beverage Policy, as stated in the Student
Handbook, says that "while College officials
normally do not serve as enforcement agents
for the government, they will not shield students or employees who violate the law."
Pertinent federal regulations, however,
require that "Institutes of Higher Education"
(IHE) must distribute to all students "a clear
statement that the IHE will impose disciplinary actions on students and employees (consistent with local,State, andFederal law), and
a description of those sanctions, up to and
including expulsion."
Another part of the policy under review
is its effectiveness in preventing underage
drinking. The presence of high school and
even junior high school students at College
parties is a "particular irritant to the community," according to Gross. This means students are not checking for ID's at parties.
Another important issue is the fact that

Swarthmore to Host Environmental Conference This Weekend
by JOSHUA SPERRY
Swarthmore will host an environmental conference entitled"Science, Policy, and Action" thisweekend. This event,
organized by members of a student-run class in biology and
political science, will bring prominent figures in biology and
environmental activism and* protection together on
Swarthmore's campus to discuss how the newest biological
knowledge is being (or should be) applied to policy problems
across the country.
Panels and individual speakers will discuss solid waste
issues
and
particularly in our own Delaware County
more general forestand land-useissues. Talks will rangefrom
local and regional issues to national and international ones
such as the Endangered Species Act and tropical deforestation. The conference will take place all day on Saturday, April
18 and from 9 to 5 on Sunday, April, 19.

The conference hopes to create many differentkinds of
opportunitiesfor all its participants. Many local environmental activists, both students and part- or full-time environmentalists, havebeen invited to attend the conference. In addition,
conference planners hope thatmany visiting parents will drop
in on whatever events they find most interesting.
Conference planners are trying to create both formal
situationsfor well-known speakers to present their latest work
to the audience, but also informal opportunities for networking and sharing ofinformation. Video tapes on environmental
issues will play in Parrish parlors all weekend, and information and letter-writing tables will be available so that the
motivated conference-goers can turn their attendance into
action. As one conference organizer said, "this conference
isn't just about talking, it's about making a difference."
The keynote speaker of the conference is Judi Ban, an
environmentalist from California who is associated with the

After all of the information presented was
carefully considered the the Dean's Committee decided on the following sanctions:
Both students have been given a nonrotational suspension for fall semester, 1993.
It was then decided that both students will be
allowed to remain on campus for theremainder of this semester, though they may not
consume or be in the presence ofothers consuming alcohol; must leave campus at the end
of classes each week and not return before
Sunday after dinner; must leave campus immediately after theirlastclass of the semester
andmay notreturn to campus except on days
when they have scheduled exam, unless with
permission from a dean. Both must practice
"active avoidance" of each other, and the
ruling states that if either should violate this
practice then the Committee will reconvene
to considerharsher sanctions. No morecan be
said about the incident at this time.

Other major speakers fromaround the country are Jasper

to protect endangered species and entire ecosystems; Amy

Also on the program are Swarthmore's own Prof. Rich

Students Demonstrate
Against McCabe Graffiti

,

At 3:40 a.m. on April 2nd, Public Safety
officers answered a call of two students fighting in the CommunityResource Center. The
caller described the scene as a medical emergency. One interpretation of the scene was
that a weapon was involved, and thus the
SwarthmorePolicewere called in. No weapon
was found on the scene. Both students were
injured, and one was taken to the hospital.
"Fights are not common, but not unheard
ofeither," stated Owen Redgrave, Directorof
Public Safety," Approximately 3-4 times a
year we are called in to break up a fight"
The two students charged each other
with assault, and a Dean's Committee consisting of Rachel Merz, Tom Stephenson,
Tom Francis, Meaghan Maloney, Eric
McCrath and NginaLythcott heard the cases.
In both cases the student was found guilty.

many of us felt as if there was no
way of knowing who the people
were, we did not even think about
the racial andgender identity of the
individuals, which was racist and
sexist in itself.
Out of respect for their privacy, we chose not to focus our
attention specifically on those two
people or whatwe thought we knew
of their "identities*\ In trying to
deal with what we felt was a crisis
situation, we didnot think through
our actions and their implications.
Unfortunately, by purposefully
avoiding dealing with individuals,
we ended up in an abstract space
where all we could see was
AlDSphobia and homophobia. Although we chose not to deal with
the individuals, we didnot deliberately choose to avoid issues of race,
gender, or class. We know however that there is no excuse for this

Fleisher was also a finalistfor
the Watson Fellowship earlier this
year, ifhe had won, he would have
studied religion in India and the
Sudan. But he said that winning the
Fulbright instead was the perfect
outcome.

AfterSri Lanka, Fleisher plans
toenter a master's program in theological studies at Harvard Divinity

School. Later, he might teach comparative English at a high school
and possibly go on for a PhD.
Obler will also be working in
religion. Until late March, Obler
had no idea what the coming year
wouldbring: "I thought I'd be working at Burger King or something."
Now he will be spending theyear in
Germany, all expenses paid, studying Western religious history.
"My backgroundfitin very well

said Obler, who is a religion major.
He chose Germany (and was chosen) because he is experienced in
German, one of the most important
languages ofreligious literature. The
Fulbright program at Heidelberg will
begin with two months of language
study. Afterwards, Obler hopes to
"flesh out some of the gaps in my

knowledge" thathe has not filled at
S warthmore, including Judaism, the
Old Testament, and medieval religion.
Obler's plans are still rather
fuzzy, since the program begins in
August and he won't even see a
Heidelbergcatalog until July."I just
applied for it sort of on a whim," he
said. However, Obler knows his
project will be "very broad-based"
and more historical than philosophical. Heis considering going to graduate school in American religious

Walker, who first became interested in Waldorf education as a

in America once her Fulbright year

American education with German

Walker said that she applied
for a Fulbright last September during the "crisis" of realizing that she

der. The choice is exercisedregardless of
the law,and as aresult is not the key issue
and should not be indicated as such by the
name. The more pertinent issue is whether
or not the activity should be legal. When
it comes to abortion, Pro-life advocates
believe that it should not, and therefore
are not "Anti-choice" or "Pro-life," but
"Anti-abortion."
Now the "Pro-choice" movement,
(f 11 call them that for now), wants abortion to be legal and available to just about
anybody forjust about any reason. Right
off, I notice that choice really isn't the
issue here, either; the legality of abortion
is. Women choose to have abortions
whether or not they are legal, and, as any
good Pro-choicer will attest, will continue to do so even if they are made
illegal. Women always have, and will
always have, the right to choose to have
an abortion. The issue at hand here is
whether or not they will be choosing
something that is legal.
Everyday, people choose to run red
lights, sing in the shower, rob a bank,
drink a beer, shoot up a McDonalds, or
read a book. Some of these things are
legal, others are not; some are legal for
some but illegal for others. No matter
where abortion ends up, it will still be a
choice, and to battle for the choice to
abortion is a rather irrelevant and unnecessary act.
The truly accurate title for those favoring the legal right to an abortion is
simply: "Pro-abortion." Now I am certain that cries will beraised here by people
claiming that Pro-abortion is another
misnomer, and that if anything, the name
shouldread "Pro-abortionrights." While
some might try to draw a distinction between these terms, they are, in actuality,
synonymous. To say that they are different is to try to distance oneselffrom ones'
conceptions of right and wrong. If you
claim a person's right to an action, then
you are, at that same moment, rendering
that action acceptable. To say that you
believe in the right of people to speak
freely means that you are forfree speech,
and thus, "Pro-free speech." Maybe you
don't personally want to speak freely,
and maybe you wouldn't advise any of
yourfriends to do so, but you are Pro-free
speech nonetheless.
Asfor the othernames that this group
is commonly called, such as "Pro-murder" and "Pro-baby killers," well I suppose that really depends on whether or
not you believe that abortion is murder or
thekilling ofbabies. But we allknow that
these names are mainly used to get the
other side all riled up; remember, we're
all trying to agree on a common ground
here.
As far as I can see, the bickering over
names has centered around a lack of understanding as to what each side is fighting for. The names produced by and
given to each are a good example of this
lack of understanding. While the issue
itself may be irreconcilable, the names,
certainly, are not.

Swarthmore Celebration Not Well Planned
Dear Student Council,

I appreciate the hard work you have put into planning the upcoming weekends, but I have a
serious concern about the scheduling of the carnival, whatI understood to be the biggest event,
for April 25th. For several weeks, long before the dates for the weekends were announced,
students have been planning to go in large numbers to join the march in Washington in support
of gay and lesbian rights, and to pressure the Clinton adminstration to make civil rights and
AIDSresearch and education a priority. On a campus in whichmany gay, lesbian, and bisexual
students struggle daily for recognition of their existence here, I think it is very ironic and sad
that this celebrationfor all of Swarthmore would be scheduled for the day when so many
students, both gay and straight, wouldbe planning to go to DC to make gaysand lesbians heard
and recognized. It seems that Student Council has failed to recognize the gay, lesbian, and
bisexual presence in their own community.

Professors Need More Contact with Students
by ETHAN S. BORG

Over the last several months, I have

frequently remarked about the veryreclusive

society of Swarthmore professors. Patiently,
I have waited, hoping someone would take
the challenge and respond with wise, insightful words, putting student-professor (that is a
minus sign, and not a hyphen) life into appropriate perspective. That hasn't happened.
Perhaps I can take that to illustrate once again
the utter lack of concern professors have
regarding student life. Or, more importantly,
perhaps I can assume professors agree with
me, have nothing new to add, and are simply
stuck in a terribly dizzying cycle from which
they cannot free themselves, such that they
cannot reach out and make contact. Assuming
this to be the truth, I can take advantage of the
situation, knowing full well no professor will
darerespond, and shall spewmy rhetoric with
impunity.
That being so, I posit that professors do not
attend enough to their students. Of course,
this isn't surprising. No one is going to grab
hisorherheadandcryout:"Hesaidwhat?!@!"
The fact is, there is power in this being a
frequent comment; and it comes from the
utter quiet that follows. Professors, though I

know many disagree with it, don't hold their
lines together yelling, "RedRoverRed Rover,
send that ignorant lying rat right over." I wish
that they would, but they don't. They don't
say anything loudly. Most ignore it, as they
ignore anything dealing with students. Perhaps it is a lack of concern. Perhaps their
bosses are slave-drivers making sure no community grows from beneath their control. I
don't know. All I know is professors are
failing to dowhat wouldbe mutually productive; they are not attending.
• This does not hold in the opposite direction. Students are attending their professors.
In fact, they are listening to their professors,
nevertalking when theirprofessors talk, seeking eye-contact when possible, trying to connect, to relate, to befriend. And to say professors gain nothing in that kind of a relationship
is bull burps. They gain esteem, confidence,
self-respect, and a reason to continue what
they are doing, areason to brave the frightful
scholastic ecosystems. Professors have a reason to feel good, despite their sacrifices. And
the fact is, students do not. Those that somehow manage to survive, fight tremendous
odds. But I believe a majority suffer a loss in
self-esteem, and must tailhook through a college slump that is infinitely difficult to navi-

gate around. One reason for this, which I have even know who is my new advisor. I doubt

by ANDY PERRIN

A crucial change has been quietly taking
place in Swarthmore's consideration of the
volunteer program. The decision itself—which I will discuss in a moment —is disturbing. But the process by which it was made is
truly shocking; a fundamental change in the
characterofCIVIC was never discussed, never
debated, never even announced to the College in general. Instead, it has turnedup
in private administrative discussions, not
exactly confidential, but certainly not
private.
The issue in question is the role of the
Volunteer Coordinator, also known as the
director of CIVIC, in relation to the College
administration. During the terms of the two
Volunteer Coordinators prior to the current
Coordinator, Serge Francois, the Volunteer
Program was known as an institutional effort
to facilitate and coordinate students' involvement in volunteerand political activities. The
office served as a meetingpoint for activities
from tutoring to marching, from protest to
social service. Most importantly, it was an
office geared to the needs of students: those
involved incommunity service workand those
who were interested in getting involved.
Although there is no official announcement, the consensus among administrators I
talked to is that thisrole has changed. Instead
of being an office to facilitate student interest
in volunteer work, the next CIVIC coordinator will be largely responsible to the College
administration, providing training and volunteers for the programs the administration
favors and (by extension) sending students interested in otherprograms, other
work, other activities, into second-class
status.

This plan is a problem on several levels.
To begin with, it is simply a bad idea for the

telling the S.O. this will not occur.
It has been assumed that total secrecy is available. So, even the old
"what will the neighbors think" argument is null and void. The final
risk is to your emotions. There is
the chance that your actions will
lead you to leave your significant
otherforyourlover. This is the only
question you, when thinking ofbeginning the life of a tart must ask
yourself. Will you be tempted to
leave your significant other? If the
answer is no, then the actions you
are considering are, to be frank, as
dangerous as masturbation.
Immediately I can hear thechorus of indignants shouting for my
blood. What about fidelity and loyalty? Essentially I am suggesting
that the physical act of sex does not
necessarily have to be, even here,
infidelity. The adultery described
here betrays no emotions and offers
no physical risks. The only danger
of "free love", assuming away the
veryreal medical risks, is the temptation to hurt another person. Here
this can only be accomplished by
the manipulation of emotions. If
you can assume away this temptationthenthe sincalled adultery hurts
no one and is, indeed, no sin.
Now realistically our society
puts in several hindrances to making this adultery, as contrived as it
is, dangerous. First, we tend to mix
physical actions with emotions. To
separate them entirely wouldbe difficult. If you cannotmanage it then
you should not play the tart. Secondly, and this is tied in to the first,
if for some reason you feel the need
to tell of your adultery you have
again run the risk of hurting your
significant other. Unfortunately this
guilt fest is a rather common occurrence, given our society's insistence
on the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.
Now, just to say it once more
Realistically this adultery is as contrived and unwieldy as can be. The
reality of adultery is risky. But, the
point here, more than go cuckold
your lover, is theway people define
their actions. As free thinkers we
must look at the real meanings of
our actions. What exactly constitutes sin? It is always easier to
accept the societal standard and
sometimes this is even the right
thing to do. But, before we accept
something we ought to consider its
conception and reasoning. There
are times when a "sin" is not a bad
thing to commit. Indeed, there are
times when a "sin" is the only honorable thing to do.

Advocacy at Swarthmore Struggles for Secure Future
by COREY MULLOY
Advocacy Group Training Project has recently grown dramatically in student involvement
and potential. Just this semester, there are about
sixty participants in the program (compared to last
semester's 30). For the first time, the program is
almost entirely student-runand has been chartered
as an official student organization. This coming
Fall semester thenumberof trained facilitators will
expand from five to ten. Doubling the amount of
facilitators promises easily 200 participants in the
program next year ...but only if there is funding for
sufficient professional supervision of facilitators
now provided by Program Director Patricia
Whitman. Without funding, the program may stop
dead in its tracks.
Although being a chartered student organization makes Advocacy eligible for funding from
Student Budgeting Committee, die project's petition to fund an intern for facilitator supervision
next year was rejected as beyond the domain ofBC.
The administration likewise feels Advocacy is not
their financial responsibility: President Bloom and
Dean Lythcott have made it clearthat AGTP is not
a College priority. Their emphases instead are on

issues of "student life."
In other efforts to gather support, one student
collected 512 signatures in a petition asking the
College to maintain Project Director Patricia
Whitman, 1 in her current full-time position. Despite this expression of student support, the College Budgeting Committee declined to continue
funding her full-time position. To supplement this
loss in her salary she will be forced to work outside
the College, making her unavailable to guide Ad-

vocacy.
The administration places priority on issues
of student life with good reason. A perusal of any
will tell you that dissatisfaction
with student life is indeed high: opinion articles
frequently decry the unbalanced emphasis of the
intellect at the expense of the whole person; the
ways that students neutralize interactions with each
other rather than treating them as people charged
with passion [p.s, iss. 17]; or the ways that "superficial" efforts are made to throw money at the
suffering, rather than deal with the root of the
problem (e.g. Worthstock carnival) [p.s, iss. 21].
Even active members of organizations are described as spending their time in a typical College
activity, "just complaining about Swarthmore's
recent Phoenix

dim social life"[p,2, iss.2l].

Advocacy was founded precisely to address
this imbalance, by forging the links between the
emotional side of human relations and die cognitive side of practical problem solving, and by
providing an opportunity to critically examine the
dynamics of power as they occur on a daily basis.
Group members have an opportunity to see themselves from a broad range of perspectives in a
supportive environment which fosters both expression and critical reflection about the values they
hold. As people learn to come face-to-face with
each other in growthful confrontation, they ultimately learn to appreciate each other's styles and
ways of being, and to explore and expand their
range of personal expression and style.
Communication skills are not something inherent in people: they are learned through experience and practice in a supportive environment
Swarthmore's failure to educate students in these
areas leads not only to a generally sterile social
environment, but also to down-right hostility between students of differing cultures which does not
get effectivelyresolved. Instead die feelings about
differences between and within groups of various
races, religions, genders, and sexual orientations

fester silently and emerge in the ugliest ways,
creating an atmosphere of distrust, intimidation,
and fear.
The College has placed new rhetorical emphases on multi-culturalismand experiential learning. But if there is ever to be an inclusive community in which people can securely advocate their
differences, it will take more than the
administration's mere lip-service to minority
groups. It will take nothing less than a change of
the College's values to include die needs for students' interpersonal growth as well as for their
intellectual growth. Advocacy is the onlyplace on
campus where students have a chance to consciously develop the skills of human relations.
This organization could serve 200 students next
year, but will not exist unless the administration
quickly recognizes the program's value and finances Patricia Whitman's position as Program
Director.

Future Swatties Pursue Intellectualism and Entertainment
bySTACEYNAKELL

They have been congregating in the
lounges, setting up sleeping bags in the dorm
rooms, eating bagel breakfasts in the admissions office, and checking out thesocial scene
at TIC: yes, Swarthmore's prospective students have hit the campus for a special Spec
Week. The campus provided numerous activities, including movies every night, for
these students, Sharpies had special, exciting
meals, and head tour guides rushed around
frantically trying to find hosts for the numerous students, to convince them that Swarthmore will somehow be more suitable to their
college needs than the otherschools they are
looking at.
The specshave thedifficulttaskofevaluating theirpotential for happiness at Swarthmore in a few short days, and each has a
unique way ofsearching for this information.
Dana Evan, from New York City, decided
that because superior academics are the most
important aspect she wants to see in a university, she would spend her first day going to
classes, and was impressed what she found.
"I went to a wonderful poetry class, and every
one seemedreally into it. People seemed to
respond to eachother in a nice way, and the
teacher was incredible." Michael Brus from
New Jersey wanted to see what the student
body was like, "I spent this afternoon talking
to people in the dorms."
Some got experiences withintimateparts
ofSwarthmore life. AlexFastov from Washington D.C. was able to visit the house of a
professor of someone she met here for dinner.
"It was really cool, there were speakers there
and we got to ask them questions." Most of
specs jump on the chance to ask Swarthmore
students all of the questions they have on the ir
minds. The most common question heard
was, "Is it really stressful here?", while others
asked students if they were happy, if the
people are nice, how big the classes are,
whether the department of their interest is
impressive, and what the students do on the
weekends.
Specs seemed generally happy withwhat
they were seeing on their visits. Helgi Blum
expressed the feeling that was most often

stated, "Everyone'sbeenreally friendly." Brus
experienced thiswarmth when he went around
from room to room in different dorms and
found that people welcomed him in to talk.
Asim Rehman found that he liked the school
better than he had expected to. "Before I
came I had a sense that thework andpressure
were really intense. Now it seems like even
though there's a lotof work, everybody's at a
high intellectual level and can be relaxed
while still getting it done."
This week has been interesting not only
for the Specs, but for the students around
S warthmorewhocame into contact withthem.
Gabriel Quinn Bauriedel '94 encountered a
variety of prospective students, some who
didn't impress him and some who he hopes to
see here. "I went to thebarbecuefor specs and
I found that many thought they had better
choices and expected me to convince them of
what Swarthmore had to offer them. I met

some interesting people, too, like one guy
who had enormous dreams ofwhat he will do
when he comes here, including directing a
musical his freshman year." Many students
chose to host specs in their rooms. These
hostshad variousmotivesfor their generosity
in sharing their rooms. Gerardo Aquino, '96
wanted to make a stay at Swarthmore as
pleasant for this year's specs as it was for him
when he came to visit. "One of my best
experiences was coming to Swarthmore and
staying on campus." Leah Oppenheim '96
took advantage of the opportunity to make a
new friend, "My spec is definitely coming
here, and we have a lot of things in common,
so I think it could lead to a friendship."
Others, such as MarcPachon '96, wanted
to make sure thatthespecs got a realistic view
of Swarthmore life. "When I came I stayed
with an over-ebullientfreshman who told me
nothing was wrong with theschool. I've been

telling my specs what it's really like, that its
a great place but they'll have both their ups
and their downs here."
An important question remains, how
many oftheseSpecs will we be seeing around
campus next year? Rehman wants to give
himself time to decide away from the campus. "I'm tending to lean towards it since I'm
having so much fun here, but I have to go
home and think about it."
Fastov has had a good time here, but is
feeling thedifficultiesofthe decision-making
process. "I'm so clueless, I know I'dbehappy
here, but I could be happy somewhere else
too." Amanda Vogel from Maryland feels
that after her weekend here she knows that
this is the place for her. "I love it here, the
people I've met are so great, I thinkI'm going
to come here." We will be seeing many of the
faces that have popped up around campus
popping up again next year.

Students Display Energy Concern in Biosphere Survey
by ALLISON MELLOY

The Swarthmore and theBiosphere class is
examining electrical power issues on campus.
Swarthmore College uses about 860,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity per month. This
translates into 12,000 100-watt bulbs burning
simultaneously. The college spends about
$76,500 per month for all the electricity used in
all campus dorms and buildings. In other words,
forty or so students sink their entire tuition and
expenses costs into paying the electricbill.
SwarthmoreCollege purchases its electricity from PECO (Philadelphia Electric Company). The power company gets its juice from
a variety ofsources. According to PECO spokesperson Michael Wood, about 60% of PECO's
powercomes from nuclearpower plant production,
20% from coal, 5% fromhydroelectric sources and
20% is purchased from other utilities.
What does this mean in terms of
Swarthmore's power use and theenvironment?
Consider the 20% of our power that comes from
coal burning plants (172,000 kwh). According
to estimates madeby other college studies similar to Swarthmore's, this would mean that a half
millionpounds ofcarbon dioxideis produced by
our electrical use each month. It is likely that
this figureis significantly larger given that much
of the 20% of power PECO buys from other

utilities is coal produced.

you find to grunge on the album is three

Coverdale does that well for one reason or

Healer by John Lee Hooker (Electra).
For those of you who don't know, John Lee
Hooker is the man. He is one of the original
blues singer/guitarplayers whomade it out of
the South in the early thirties and is still alive.
His style of playing, if you don't know, is
much quieter than most blues players. No
flashy leadlicks. Just his voice and his guitar.
His voice has a lonely, haunting quality to it
that no other singer I know has. And his
guitaring is described as "boogie." A swinging style ofguitar playing that gets your foot
tapping, but the music never drowns out the
voice, it only complements it He has a style
of guitaring that is difficult to emulate —it is
not what he does, it's how he does it.

traditional boogie. The boogie is present, but
it is controlledand polished. In addition, each
artist adds a strong impact to the flavoring of
the songs. For example, the first song feature
a congo-like beat and Santana's guitar filling
the song. However, as the album progress,
these other players drop out or become less
prominent in the songs and JohnLee Hooker

more into the foreground. By the end of the

If We Told You More, You'd Know Too Much
Johnson at
the Movies
by PAUL ANSCHEL and
JAMES HOCKENBERRY
Paul: This week, folks, we're having a slight
change in the column, since I've managed to
lose James (I can't find him anywhere) so it's
just poor me and poor Adam (I suckered him
into helping me).
Adam: Boy, if you thought they weren't
funny last weekPaul: But we gotta be funny, we're writing
from the shuttle while I drive (shit there's
security, "shuttle at the rose garden"). Anyway, I wanna know what happened to our
penises last week?!?
Adam: You mean in the article? You see,
folks, Paul and James said Penis a lot in the
article last week and Matt took it out (probably to protect my reputation) because they
talked about MY PENIS and I didn't want my
penis in the Phoenix. (Please wear seatbelts?
There aren't any seatbelts, whatthe hellkind
of sign is that?)
Paul: My favorite shuttle sign is Stay Off
Grass... This Friday showing in the PAC at
7:30 and 10:00 P.M. is The Man Who Knew
Too Much. Saturday in thePAC at 7:30 and
10:00 P.M., Howard's End is showing. I
haven't seen either.
Adam: Me neither, but I know that The Man
Who Knew Too Much is about a guy and he
gets chased around India (maybe) and you
know why? Because he knows too much.
Paul: Score, we found him.
Adam: We looked for you everywhere. We
even went to Willets.

Adam: Worse yet, he remade it badly.
James: This is probably the first one.

James: How about the othermovie then?
Adam: Well, I can safely say that Andy

I think that's whatpeople said. And someone
on the shuttle said something about a castle,
but I think they're wrong.
James: Well, popular opinion seems to be
thatthis is one of thebest movies showing this

people anyways. As I rationalize writing yet

Adam: Oh, something else. On the shuttle,

Amy Wilson '93 wouldn't tell us the ending
because she said it would spoil it for us. So,
maybe there's a twist..like in The Crying
Game.
James: If there was, perhaps we could ask
Matt and he'd give it away. Anyway, I have
no idea what it's about at all, despite several
people asking when it was showing and expressing extreme interest in seeing it. So if
you are a lemming, I'd suggest seeing it for
sure.
Adam: This beer is crap! And yet James
strangely enough still seems to be drinking it.
James: I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not I tell

Hey, that was a good one!
Adam: I got to piss.
James: Watch that toilet! It's a wily one.
Make sure to flush or Paul will be upset when
he comes back. Did youknow he's a flushing

Adam: So, doyou want to bring this to a close
soon? Folks, I realize that we didn't saymuch
about these movies, but if we had, then you'd
be like the man who knew too much. Unless
you're a woman, then you'd be like the woman

Alice Enchants Audiences With the Wit of Wonderland
Acting HI Combines Music and Dance to Present Creative Adaptation
by AMANDA ROCQUE
For many people, the mere mention of
the name Alice brings to mind an image of a
little blond girl running around a colorful
Wonderland in a blue dress.Like the Disney
fairytale, Alice, Acting Ill's collection of
scenes adapted from Lewis Carroll's Alice in
Wonderland and Through theLooking Glass,
features animated performances and upbeat
musical numbers. However, this play is far
more complex than the children's cartoon
version.
Alice is a set of scenes that tries to
examine the line betweenreality and illusion.
With fast-paced dance scenes, poetic recitations, a clever puppet show, and the brillant
incorporationofsimple movement techniques,
Acting m's theatrical adaptation of this classic fairytale may be one of the best student
performances of the year.
Created withclass collaboration, theplay
developed from a series of improvisational
rehearsals. According to Stage Manager Tara
Webb, when the rehearsals began, the class
had "no fixed ideaofhow the final production
would look," but as the ensemble continued
to play around with the script and experiment
withrole-playing, the play started to structure
itself around a chorus made up of the entire
cast

The chorus embodies many different
voices of Alice. Throughout the play, each
member of the nine person ensemble takes a
turn playing Alice. Although changing the
role ofAlice tends to confuse the audience at
times, for the most part, the actors do an
excellent job making clear which actor is
playing Alice. Webb believes that Alice's
character, who constantly questions the confusing events that she encounters during her
Wonderland adventure, does not have "one
voice, but many voices, just as people are
multifaceted and 'multi-voiced.'" Therefore,
while an actor may be playing "Alice" in one
particular scene, the rest of the chorus often

delivers Alice's lines along with that actor.
By using this technique of overlapping voices,
the audience realizes that these backround
chorus members are like various voices in
Alice's head which "offer opposition, support, admonishment, caution, temptation and
forgiveness," said Webb.
When they are not acting as Alice, the
other cast members play a numberofdifferent
roles.For example, Jen Setlow ('95) plays the
WaterRat in one scene and gives a humorous
portrayal of the King ofHearts at the end of
the second act The ensemble performs a
series of musical numbers, ranging from the
bittersweetsoup songperformed by theMock
Turtle (Ted Pierce '94) to a lively Lobster
Quadrille. Alice effectively adapts the poem
about the dreaded Jabberwocky into a haunting musical piece, adding a spooky poetic
recitation in the middle.
Perhaps the play's most memorable
musical number is Tweedledum (Marc
Chernoff '95) and Tweedledee's (Pierce)
musical rendition of the story ofWalrus and
theCarpenter.The Chesire Cat (Dave Hanson
'95) accompanies the song with a humorous
puppet show deatiling thestory of the oyster's
fate.
The actors' wide range of talent shines
through in several scenes that feature difficult
movement techniques. By flailing theirarms,
running around in a circle, and spinning Alice
in the center of the ring, the cast does an
excellent job convincing the audience that
Alice is truly falling down a rabbit hole. In
scenes that show Alice growing and shrinking, the actors successfully use movement to
create the illusion that Alice is really only
threeinches tall.Anotherscene that sucessfully
employs groupmovement is the croquetscene
where the balls, hedgehogs with peppers in
their mouths, dance around the stage in slow
motion each time they receive a whack by the
Queen ofHearts (Chernoff).
Perhaps the most creative use of movement in Alice is the body of the Caterpilar.

Christopher Leßoy '93, wearing a bowler hat
and standing in front of the other five male
cast members, forms the long, leggy body of
the Caterpillar. As Irene Pedraza '94, who
plays Alice in this particular scene, sings an
innocent version of thepoem "You Are Old
Father Williams," the Caterpillar seductively
caresses her, with two sets of arms eerily
grabbing her from behind.
Alice brings the audience memorable
scenes such as an encounter with Humpty
Dumpty (Adam Koplan '95) and a fleet of
birds running around in the Caucus Race to
the schreeching squawks of Mei-Ling
McWorter '94. Ofcourse, this fairytale would
not be the same without the mad tea party.
With Leßoy as a sarcastic Mad Hatter, Eric
Rehl as the March Hare, and Pedraza playing

of Carroll's Fairytale

the Doonnouse, this scene delivers Carroll's
clever puns with a new twist
The set foxAlice is simple yet beautiful
with an ornate circle on the center of the floor
and a panelled wall in the backround. Yet itis
the very simplicity of the design that permits
easy transformationsfrom a Victorian parlor
in the opening scene to a rose garden to a
courtroom. The elegant costumes, formal
black evening gowns for the women and coat
and tails for the men, help the cast members
quickly change from one character to the next
with ease.
Although nonsense abounds throughout
the entire script and the cast members frequently change characters, Acting HI presents a creative production of this enchanting
story.

Swarming Earthworms' to Battle Lafayette at Home
Youth, Renewed Determination Has Made Squad Competitive

by KEVIN KEENAN
This

marked a new

level of serious fun for the Swarming Earthworms, Swarthmore'sUltimate Frisbee Team. An influx of
talentedfreshmen and an increasing
desire for competitiveness on the
part of the upperclassmen set the

stage for an Ultimaterevival. First,
the team got more organized, as
evidencedby new discs ($7 cheap),

says co-captain Kevin Keenan '95.

Bandits Fall to Division Powerhouses Pomona, Emory
-

Host University of Pennsylvania Wednesday

by BRANDT LINCOLN
Once again, the Men's Tennis
Team was involved in two close
matches against top-ranked Division 111 opponents. On Saturday,
the Bandits facedthePomona-Pitzer
Colleges at the Arthur Ashe Tennis
Center, and on Monday they were
matched against Emory University
at the Wharton Courts. This was a

very important weekend for the
Bandits because a victory would
increase their chances for making
the NCAA Nationals at the end of
the year. The Garnet, however, fell
just short of this goal as they were
beaten by both schools in two very
tight matches.
The match with Pomona was
originally scheduled to be played at
the Wharton Courts on Saturday

afternoon. However, because ofthe
drenching rain, the match was postponed until the evening so that it
couldbeplayed indoors at theArthur
Ashe Center in Philadelphia. The
team was once again led by the
excellent play of the two upperclassmen on the team. At first
singles, senior Phil Rosenstrach
pulled out a close two-set match to
give the Garnet theirfirst point. The

victory put him one step closer to
receiving All-American status as he
has been winning convincingly at
the top spot The Garnet's second
point was earned by the ever reliable juniorJeremy Shweder at third
singles. Rosenstrach and Shweder
have formed the backbone of the
team this season with their consistent play and their excellent leadership on and off the court. Despite
their two wins, thematch soon turned
sour for the Garnet as they dropped
theremaining four singles matches.
There was a glimpse of hope,
though, at fourthandfifth singles as
Brandt Lincoln and Barry "Fist"
Mook were involved in close threeset matches. Lincoln lost a heartbreaker in a thirdset tie-break while
Mook lost his third set by the score
of 6-4. Pomona was able to clinch
the match at first doubles as Phil
Rosenstrach and ChrisPearson lost
in two tight sets.
On Monday, the Bandits had
their fourthhome matchof the season against Emory University at the
Wharton courts. As they had done
against Pomona, the Bandits went
down by the score offour points to
two after singles. Vijay Toke '96
garnered thefirst point for the Bandits at the sixth position. He was
victorious in three sets as his picture-perfect serve-and-volley game
proved to be too much for his opponent to handle. The second point
was once again earned by Jeremy
Shweder at third singles. He won
the first set rather routinely by the
score of 6-2. However, the second
set proved to be a different story as
he was forced to a tie-breaker before he was able to close out the

-

match.
Despite being down, the Garnet still felt confident about their
chances ofwinning. This was shown
by the Garnet’s explosive doubles
performances. All three doubles
matches went to three sets adding
excitement for the spectators and a
possible nervous breakdownfor the
Emory coach. Sophomore Chris
Pearson teamed with Phil
Rosenstrach at first doubles to earn
the the Bandits’ third point of the
day. After losing the first set in a tiebreaker, they came back to win the
second set tie-break before closing
their opponents out in the third set.
Unfortunately, this was the last point
that the Garnetrecorded for the day
as both second and third doubles
lost theirthird sets, BrandtLincoln
and Vijay Toke lost theirthirdset by
the score of 7-5 after winning the
first set rather convincingly. At
third doubles, Jeremy Shweder and
George Khalaf played excellent
doubles as they were matched
against an obviously stacked tandem. After dropping the first set,
they came back to win the second in
a tie-break; however, the third set
was taken by Emory to clinch the
team victory*.
The Garnettravels to NewYork
thisweekend to face two more Division ID opponents before returning
home next week to face the University of Pennsylvania. This Saturday, the Bandits will meet SUNY
Binghamton and, on Sunday, the
University of Rochester to closeout their Eastern Division matchups. The Garnet will be playing the
Quakers on Wednesday afternoon
at the Wharton Courts.
