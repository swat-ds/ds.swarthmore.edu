SWARTHMORE COLLEGE Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

NOW President Discusses
Her Perceptions of the
Women's Movement
by Emily Shartin
Patricia Ireland, President of the National
Organization for Women (NOW), visited
Swarthmore on Tuesday. Her lecture was
the second and final installment of a series
entitled "Progressive Visions" sponsored by
the William J. Cooper Foundation and the
College Democrats. Before her talk, Anya
Freiman 'OO and Emily Shartin '9B, sat
down with Ms. Ireland for a short interview.
Phoenix: What do you make of the claim
that feminism is an "allowable" mainstream
structure for women to work within? Do
you see yourself and the organization working within that structure or moving toward
something more radical?
Ireland: Well I think that NOW's role has
always been in part to be pushing on public opinion, to try to be a leader of public
opinion rather than a follower of public
opinion. I look back over the thirty years
plus that NOW's been an organization, and
we've often taken some very strong stands
that were... radical at the moment, just as
women demanding the right to vote was
quite radical at a time when women weren't
even allowed to speak in public. And so
when we came out in favor of lesbian and
gaycivil rights and said that was a feminist
issue, that was within the feminist movement, within the women's rights movement,
it was very controversial. I think...that even
within an allowable structure there are always the cutting-edge issues. If we now
have achieved a point where the majority
of people agree that there should not be job

discrimination against lesbian and gay
workers, then we need to take on the issue
of lesbian and gay families and equal marriage rights. There are those people who
will then run screaming from the room going, 'Well of course I believe in equal employment rights, but don't talk to me about
that other stuff. That's just wrong, that's
heresy! A man and a woman, you know,
that's just how it is!' So I think that much
of the agenda that was quite radical in the
beginning of the modern women's rights
movement has now been incorporated into
the mainstream and yet, whether we're talking about fair share of power... I would give
the guys 50 seats in the Senate. We're 51
percent of the population, but I would settle
for a mere 50 seats in the Senate... Or taking on the Promise Keepers, when everyone else was portraying the Promise Keepers as this great Christian men's group that
was building strong families and helping
men take responsibility... Those are issues
that are allowable to some extent and at the
same time they bring harsh repercussions.
Phoenix: How do you see the younger
population responding to or treating feminism?
Ireland: I don't think it's any more difficult now than it's ever been, I don't think
it's more likely now for feminism to be the
'f-word' on a campus than it was when I
was in school thirty years ago, but I think
that the imagery of what a feminist is is
sometimes frightening to people because
it's so skewed. The quote from that direct

In the midst of a massive Asian financial
crisis, many international students from
Asia studying in the U.S. cannot afford to
come back to school this semester. Although international students at Swarthmore have not been greatly impacted by
the economic crisis, students from other
colleges have not been as fortunate. At
schools such as George Washington University and the University of Pennsylvania, where there are larger numbers of international students, some Asian students
have had to take a semester off or leave

According to Grace, expenses include overhead, which is usually
higher at a college bookstore than that
of a Barnes and Noble or a Borders.
Additionally, because Swarthmore has
an unusually high rate ofbook returns,
costs for freight and processing tend
to be more substantial.
Publishers will often give commercial bookstores
including online
bookstores
still larger discounts off
the suggested retail price than those
offered to campus bookstores. Grace,
who views the price discrimination as
"vastly unfair to students," notes that
publishers are facing lawsuits alleging

bookstore's buy-back policy. A new
book that costs $4O might only be
worth $5 according to the College's
contracted agent for resale. Yet the
same book might be on the shelf the
following semester selling for $35.
Only when the bookstore is certain that
the same edition of text will be used
the following semester will it buy back
the book for half of its original price.
Grace says that resale policies are
largely beyond the bookstore's control
and are in the hands of national companies that act as re-distributors of reused books. Reused books, furthermore, are especially expensive to process.
There are, of course, alternatives to
selling books back to the bookstore.

History Month Committee, co-chaired by seniors
Tamala Montgomery '9B and Maurisa Thompson '9B,
has been preparing for the celebration since the fall.
The theme of the month, "The Black Continuum," was
selected by Tim Sams, the Director of the Black Cultural Center. According to Montgomery, "the theme relates to this year's focus for SASS [the Swarthmore
African American Student Society], which is to build
bridges between the diverse communities encompassed
by the greater black community at Swat." When asked
what message, if any, they expected to convey as a result of their organizational efforts, Thompson says that
she "hopes the various events will encourage the Swarthmore community to not only remember but appreciate the integral role blacks have played in this country
both in the historical and contemporary sense."
The festivities began last Saturday at the Intercultural
Center with a convocation ceremony entitled "The Colors of America: An Evening of Soul," organized and
hosted by Rodney Morris 'Ol. The ceremony featured
performances by several black students on campus including the a cappella group Black Coffee, which especially moved the crowd with its rendition of "Lift Every Voice and Sing." The performances were followed
by an open mike session. According to Morris, the
evening was designed to "expose the Swarthmore community to the past and present struggles ofblack people
from Africa, the Caribbean, and America, through poetry and song."
Upcoming events organized in the spirit of the month
include "Soul Cafe," a poetry/open mike session served
up with soul food, live music and a Harlem Renaissance
theme.This weekend there will be a dance performance

altogether.
The crisis has caused economic turmoil
in Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, and
Thailand for the past six months. The currencies in these countries have devalued by
at least 40 percent against the U.S. dollar.
The crisis has also had repercussions in
other Asian countries, as some of the largest brokerage firms in Japan and China
have collapsed.
Although no Swarthmore students have
left this semester, the economic strain has
been rough for some students such as Miho
Tsujii '9B, who could not afford to buy
books this semester. Tsujii worked in Japan last semester and now the money she
earned is worth half the value that it was
last year. She was able to get a loan for
her books this semester through the Foreign Aid Office.
Laura Talbot, the Director of Financial
Aid, says that about two students on campus have approached her with concerns
about their financial situation. The administration has decided to give those students
more time to pay for their tuition. Exactly
how much more time a student gets is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, says James
Cavanagh, the Controller. There is no specific time limit except that it is a graduation requirement that all bills be paid. Yet,
he adds that, "We do not think it wise for a
student to increase the amount due to the
College if it is clear that the balance cannot be paid."
Talbot says that the College reviews its
policies for situations such as theAsian financial crisis on a yearly basis. A drawback for international students is that if they
did not apply for financial aid when they
initially applied to the Swarthmore, they
are not eligible to receive aid anytime during their four years. "The policy is explicitly written all over the Swarthmore application form," says Talbot.
Swarthmore is one of the few institutions
in the nation that offers aid to international
students. Its budget for foreign national
students is approximately $1 million each
year or 10 percent of the financial aid budget. They also have funds to help students
who cannot afford a trip home after five
consecutive semesters.
Although the majority of Swarthmore
students do not have to face the possibility
of leaving school, many Asian international
students and Asian students at Swarthmore
have still been affected by the crisis. Bohee
Yoon 'Ol says that her parents are sending
U.S. dollars back to family members in
Korea in the hopes that as more dollars circulate in the Korean economy, there will
be more faith in the Korean won. Steve
Shin '9B, was planning on working at a firm
in Korea after graduation, but many Korean firms have laid off 30 percent of their
employees.
In Indonesia, many people are suffering
as well. Aryani Manring 'Ol says that
many people were stocking up on staple
goods like as rice and sugar when she went

Bookstore Says
Prices Are
Comparably Low
Perennially accused of inflating its
prices, the College Bookstore is seeking ways to reduce costs to students.
However, its director maintains that
even now prices at the bookstore are
lower than those of most comparable
colleges.
"Textbook price are an issue at every school in the country, but absolutely everything we sell in the bookstore is at or below the manufacturer's
suggested retail price," says Kathy
Grace, Director of the Bookstore.
Swarthmore's relatively small size
and its tendency to use nontraditional
course material limit the bookstore's
buying power, according to Grace. The
College-managedbookstore is not designed to make a profit and operates
on a break-even basis. Approximately
$1 million dollars worth ofbooks and
other merchandise are ordered every
year.
Generally, publishers give the bookstore a 20 percent discount off the suggestedretail price on purchases of new
textbooks—hardback texts of the $7O,
$BO, and $9O variety. The bookstore
charges the full suggested retail price
and covers its expenses through the 20
percent discount.
More than most other schools, Swarthmore uses course materials beyond
standard textbooks. In these cases,
publishers will often give the bookstore a 40 percent discount on new
books, 10 percent of which the bookstore passes onto students. Again, the
bookstore uses the 30 percent savings

Since the retirement of former
College Librarian Michael Durkan
in 1996, Swarthmore has been trying to find a replacement.
Before beginning the search, the
search committee, headed by Associate Provost Barry Schwartz,
decided to examine the relationship
between libraries, computing and
media. According to Schwartz, the
position of library director has significantly changed in recent years.
Two of the major qualifications the
search committee is looking for in
its applicants are the ability to adapt
to new technology, and the skills
for encouraging others to embrace
it. The committee would also like
to see the library reach out to the
community more by familiarizing

students and faculty with the
library's resources.
The search for a new librarian
began in the fall of 1997. Advertisements were posted in academic
publications and nominations were
accepted. Seventy people applied or
were nominated, from which four
were chosen to come to Swarthmore for two days. The four candidates gave talks, and met with the
president, provost, library staff,
members of
the faculty,
students, and other community
members. At the end of the fall semester, Victoria Hanawalt, the library director at Reed College, was
offered the Swarthmore position.
However, she declined the offer a
week before this semester started.
Another of thefinal four candidates
withdrew her application as well.

The search committee has now
returned to square one. Additional
job candidates will visit Swarthmore during the month of February, and will undergo a process
similar to the one used to select
from the previous four candidates.
Amy Morrison is currently the
Acting College Librarian, and the
search committee hopes to choose

a head librarian by spring break. In

addition, as a result of the examination conducted before the search,
the committee ended up drafting a
report recommending the creation
of a new position entitled Associate Provost for Information Technology. Tom Stephenson was chosen to take the new position, which
is part-time for three years.

About The Phoenix Editorial Board
In light of the recent and past confusions about the nature ofThe Phoenix's
editorial board, we would like to make the following clarification.
The editorial boards of most professional papers are charged exclusively
with the duty of writing editorials on current events and affairs, both domestic and international. They are not responsible for charting the editorial
direction of the paper, however they do comprise experienced and in many
cases, veteran writers who have a personal stake in the paper after many
years of service, hence the name "staff editorials." These are also people
who have been instrumental in shaping the editorial direction of the paper,
and whose views and opinions have been shaped by the paper's philosophy
as well. It naturally follows that their opinions are somewhat reflective of
the underlying ideologies of the paper as a whole.
The Phoenix editorial board does, like its counterparts, comments on current issues, placing a focus on college-related affairs, and does not have
any influence over The Phoenix's editorial philosophy whatsoever. Yet
for pragmatic reasons, unlike at most professional papers, it does not
represent the official stance of the paper. As mentioned in our first editorial of the semester, the staff changes from semester to semester, people
come and go—in general there is a lack of sustained committment to the
paper. (Very few members of the existing staff serve on the editorial board.
)It also follows that a "Phoenix ideology" is non-existent, or rather, to be
more specific, it fluctuates so much as to not qualify as an ideology. We are
nevertheless, as we have forcefully pledged in the first issue, working hard
towards the day when the entire operation is consistent and self-sustaining
enough that a stable identity will fall into place.
In the meantime, we have adopted what we believe to be a creative and
constructive compromise. The editorial board is currently open to everyone. Both editors-in-chief serve on it to guarantee that there remains a
substantial Phoenix input, but the main goal is to encompass as diverse and
representative a body of opinions as possible. The edtorial board, as it is,
thus aims to serve as a barometerof popular opinion, with a slight Phoenix
slant. And it is a barometer that does not go unheard. The staff editorial is
the first column that many key admnistrators read when they pick up the
paper.
The editorial board in its current form will only live up to its full potential
when its composition does in fact reflect the composition of the entire student population as a whole.
Hence we hereby invite all interested students to join the editorial board
and have their voices heard.
Under the existing format, the board first has an elaborate discussion on
the issues raised and reaches a consensus, after which the topics are assigned to be written by individual members. Members alternate in their
writing, and usually write once every three weeks. So we are looking at at
most a two, three hour weekly committment on a writing week. Meetings
are held every Sunday night at 7:30 in Kohlberg 115.
This is your chance not only to serve your fellow students by speaking
out on their behalf, but also to possibly translate your deeply rooted convictions into reality by getting them heard by the right people.
Remember, you have the power to make a difference.

A Phoenix Policy Clarification
We have received and continue to receive requests from students, faculty
and staff alike for coverage of events or activities with which they are affiliated. These "tips," however, do not necessarily translate into stories. Yet the
impression that we have gotten from certain people who have approached
us in the past is that they expect coverage, as if it is our responsibility to
report on their event or activity. Sometimes the tone of the request is simply
downright presumptuous. We would like to reiterate here that The Phoenix, unlike the Weekly News, does not play the role of "official state
media apparatus," so to speak. The Phoenix will exercise its own independent judgment in deciding what is newsworthy and what not. As a
community newspaper, The Phoenix has a duty to the Swarthmore community not to cover every single campus event, but to cover the campus well,
by developing a refined and accurate news judgement to filter through the
bulk of happenings and picking out those that are most relevant to, or have
the most impact on the campus community. As always, we welcome tips
and suggestions of all sorts, simply because we can'tpossibly find out about
everything. Yet ultimately the prerogative to decide whether or not to print
is exclusively ours and will not be compromised under any circumstances.
(We are, however, more than willing to provide free advertising for any oncampus events or activities. Yet note that they will take second priority to
paid ads and hence are not guaranteed to print.)

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Protest of Girl Scouts Inappropriate, Irresponsible
To the Editor.
Many ofyou have seen the signs posted on
the outside doors to Sharpies while young Girl
Scouts sell cookies at the table inside. The
signs are made by someone who identifies
him/herself as "A SURVIVOR" of "EMOTIONAL RAPE" by Girl Scouting. These
signs urge passers by not to buy cookies. This
past weekend, a group of young Girl Scouts
put up a sign, decorated with their own artwork, in the lobby of Sharpies, letting students
know that they would be selling cookies during dinner on Monday night. When I arrived
at dinner Monday, the scouts had not arrived
yet. The sign the girls had made had been torn
down and shredded, each piece ceremonially
placed in a pile on the table where they were
to sell cookies. A sign had been posted whose
highlights included an accusation by the author of "EMOTIONAL RAPE" by "a local
Girl Scout organization." The author of the
sign stated that (s)he could not sign his/her
name, because the Girl Scouts of the USA
(GSUSA) had threatened legal action against
him/her.
While a staunch supporter offree speech and
free thought, as a member of the College
Community, there are two things in this story
that I must speak out against: 1) vandalism of
the children's sign 2) a break of the public
trust through anonymous hate speech.
While I do not doubtthe severity of the emotional pain the author feels, nor her passionate convictions (nor her right to express them)
that girl scouting is a creeping evil in our society, I do condemn her way of expressing her
pain and her convictions. Imagine, for a
minute, that you are an 8-year old girl, arriving to sell cookies for your troop's camping
trip, and you find the sign you have decorated
ripped to pieces and a sign posted on your way
in accusing the Girl Scouts of "Emotional
Rape." While unlikely to elicit change in an
organization of 3.4 million women, this scene
is likely to traumatize these girls, and make

the campus feel like a place where they are,
(as they are Girl Scouts) so unwelcomed that
they need fear destruction of their property.
There are appropriate channels for activism,
such as putting up signs stating damaging
facts about the Girl Scouts (not just charges)
writing letters to policy-makers in the Girl
Scouts organization, asking the deans not to
allow the scouts to sell on campus, or dealing
through the WRC, (if girl scouting is harmful
to young women) or even Conscious Consumers. Where does the appropriate/inappropriate line lie? I don't know. But actions that
are both likely to hurt small children and unlikely to accomplish much more than a couple
less boxes of cookies sold definitely crosses
'
it for me. '
The second decision of the author that
deeply disturbs me is that (s)he stated at the
end of the last sign that she couldn't sign it
because GSUSA had threatened legal action
against him/her. In researching this article, I
called both local and national Girl Scouts offices, and not only had the signs not resulted
in threat of legal action, but my inquiry was
the first either had heard of anti-Girl Scout
signs or vandalism on the Swarthmore College Campus. But the threat could have come
from another incident, so it becomes an unprovable, un-disprovable convenient way to
claim necessary anonymity. I do not wish to
state that (s)he should be forced to identify
her/himself, if so disinclined. But there are
other ways in which one can stand up and take
responsibility for one's actions. A more responsible way to maintain anonymity would
have been to arrange with a campus group or
the deans that (s)he could be contacted
through them. The core of Collegiate open
debate of issues is openness and honesty.
Anonymous, unsubstantiated vilification is
also called Hate Speech, and there are reasons it is not tolerated on this campus. The
The College Community cannot make informed decisions on critical issues from

anonymous, unproven conclusions and
charges. I would hope that those who
would place issues in the public eye would
inform the community both through, and by
taking responsibility for, the facts they
present, and let us reach our own conclusions.

An Open Letter to the Swarthmore Faculty
To the Editor:
Ask not what your students can
do for you, ask what you can do
for your students. When John F.
Kennedy used similar sentiments,
he was demanding service, not
offering if. Thus, I use this space
to
ask for more from
Swarthmore's faculty.
In the course of my couple of
years here, I have found that my
professors have an incredibly
strong tendency to avoid interesting conversations. Almost every
question I ask is met with a response which is designed to terminate the present interaction as
soon as possible, and avoid future
discussion on the same topic.
I understand that this is not the
experience of every Swarthmore
student. There are those students
say that they have had long, interesting discussions with their
professors. Every student should
find such conversations at Swarthmore. It is a professor's responsibility to foster an environment
in which these experiences are
common. I am disappointed to

discover that I would be amazed
if a professor told me that they
were interested in my question
and that they would go get some
more information on the subject.
I would be even more amazed if
they wanted me to study it myself, perhaps in the lab. It always
saddens me when I would be
thrilled if someone else did what
I would do by reflex were I in
their position.
I know that professors have
many things to do outside of
class. Thus I ask that while taking care of their paperwork and
delegating their research, they
make themselves available to the
students. What does it mean to
be available to students?

Being present in your office
is not all it takes to be available.
It is not enough to gladly answer
any question. A professor should
TRY to interest students enough
that they ask their own questions.
Professors need to help Swarthmore to live up to its name by
facilitating meaningful discourse
-

-

with and between students.
Professors should be glad to
invest significant amounts of their
timefor a student that requests it.
-

It has been my experience that
professors do not live up to these
expectations. Let alone academic
attention, departments often do
not provide critical information to
students. I had to go to the wrong
person several times before I was
told who my advisor was for junior year. To the best ofmy knowledge, no junior was sent an e-mail
or letter with
that information.
How
could anyone
expect to get
useful, mean-

ingful guidance
if they are not
even told who
their faculty advisor is?
I ask that professors open
themselves up
to their stu-

dents. There is time. If a professor does not have timefor interesting discourse with students,
there is something seriously
wrong. If a professor does not
desire interesting discourse with,
students, something is amiss. If
a professor does not have interesting discourse with several students every day, there is a problem. Swarthmore and, in fact,
education should be about intellectually challenging and interesting discourse.

some serious doubts about what was going on in the White House. What possible motivation could Bill have in getting caught in this Sexgate thing?
If you were as confused and concerned as I was, perhaps the dialogue
below, purloined from a bedtime chat
will prove reassuring. It suggests our
country is being led by a shrewd helmsman after all. A person sacrificing personal embarrassment for the national

B: What's bothering you?
H: Remember thefilms we previewed
last week. The Bond thing and the Wag

B: Sure, 007 saws up the mad media

story. This media guy threatens to start
world war HI. First, though he kills his
wife, murders lots of innocent British
seaman and steals a nuclear warhead
all to get higher ratings for his worldwide, media network. Sort x of like
Saddam Hussein plays Ted Turner. But
what's that got to do with our problems?
And that other film
that was horrible
suggesting a President would try to
worm out of a sex scandal by making
up a war?
H: The connection is simple, honey.
Those films portray the media as conspiratorial, evil, and out to make news

by getting people to act
badly. They urge folks
to "shoot" or get laid in
public to make headlines. It's the theme of
the Bond film and the
assumption in the tail

B: So the media are
assholes, that's not

problem is that we must
do something about
Saddam Hussein and his
weapons of mass destruction. Why do you

B: Enough
I don't
know why I ever

You're just too sensitive.
Hell, if Madeleine, Defense, the NSC and the

we're just stuck. My ratings are sliding;
I don't have enough support to take out
those weapons or Hussein. Sure, talk is
not working, but to really do something
we need to use big stuff, even troops in
Iraq. And that is politically impossible.
The whole damn thing is worse than

What Should We Do With Budget Surplus?
by Owen F. Lipsett
If we are to believe President Clinton's
fiscal 1999 budget proposal, the United
States is headed for at least five consecutive years of budget surpluses, the first of
theirkind in thirty years. While commentators from all portions of the political
spectrum favor using the windfall to pay
down the national
debt, thereby alleviating the huge interest payments
that have saddled
the budget since
the Reagan years,
the long-term concerns about spending break down
much more. In
view
of
the

countries such as the United States, the
relatively high wages mean that products
produced there must be skill and knowledge intensive. Producing a workforce out
of welfare rolls and educating future generations are two programs which would
cost money in the short term, but help ensure further economic productivity in the
long run.
While many continue to debate it,
welfare reform has
become a necessity.
For all its unpleasantness for those
who formerly did
not have to work to
receive benefits,
workfare is a positive program which
should be continued. The benefits
of a program that
forces those on the public dole to earn the
money which the government previously
gave them in the past are twofold: first,
the work accomplished, second, it gives
welfare recipients work experience, allowing them to acquire skills that allow them
to gain jobs in the private sector. This in
turn breaks the cycle of poverty and dependence that the old system fostered. In
the face of efforts for further "reform"
however, the system must be given a human and more subjective face, grants
should be made more flexibly. For example, in an oft cited example, a man who
needs a one-time loan to repair his car to
commute to work is denied the money,
thereby costing the government many
times the value of the loan and relegating

economy's current

health, the wisest
course would be to ensure its future health.
Two ideas spring to mind: workfare and
an emphasis on education. The structure
of the public assistance system was recently amendeddue to justified fiscal concerns. In theprocess though, many people
lost track of the purpose the public assistance system should serve: to help the indigent in the short term financially but
more importantly help them acquire skills
to fend for themselves in the marketplace
in the long-term. In addition, as the "global economy" has become a cliche on par
with the "Post-Cold War Era," it has become vital for developed countries such
as the United States to have educated
workforces. This is because other countries can provide unskilled labor much
more cheaply, while in long-developed

Face/Off, page 4

by Grant N. Nachman
Much talk has occurred concerning a
supposed budget surplus, the first of its
kind since the late 1960'5, and of course,
the liberals on Capitol Hill have already
devised a way to spend it. However, in
truth there is really no surplus at all, and
even if there were, wasting such money
on social spending
would be unacceptable.
The budget surplus exists only on
paper because of
the fairly recently
adopted unified
which
budget,
the
social
lumps
security trust fund in
with the operational budget of the
federal government. Social Security took in more money
than it paid out this year; however, that
money is separate from the government's
operational budget because every cent is
earmarked to be paid out to retirees. Excluding Social Security, which is a separate trust, the government actually disbursed $6O billion more than it took in.
Nonetheless, Clinton wants to spend our
mythical budget surplus like a kid in a
candy store who just got his allowance.
However, the candy Clinton wants to
spend our money on will make us sicker
than just a few chocolate bars, because
the President wants the budget to digest
new social programs. Clinton wants to
expand Medicare, allowing people to pay
into the system in order to receive coverage. Already, Medicare faces a huge

crunch as the boomers retire. If individuals value such coverage, they can purchase
it from private companies, which will provide if they see a demand. Expanding a
bloated, inefficient social program to fit
this need borders on lunacy. Clinton also
wants to throw more money at inefficient
public school systems. Money alone,
however, cannot solve the problems faced
by our schools. To
solve America's
education crisis,
we must begin by
reducing the power
of teachers' unions
and teach fundamental skills instead of new age
feel-good mantras.
Spending more
money on education oftenproduces
the worst results;
reforms will ensure that additional monies go to thestudents and not to the NEA's
political action slush fund. Only after the
public schools undertake serious reform
should they be entrusted with more of our
scarce resources. While education is one
of the most importantpublic goods a government can provide, it is necessary first
to ensure that additional resources reach
those whom they are intended to help.
In short, there is no excuse for expanding government. Even if the budget truly
were balanced, economists estimate that
social programs exert a dead weight loss
on the economy between twenty and fifty
cents on every dollar they require. And
with the budget still unbalanced everywhere but on paper, new social spending
is a recipe for disaster.

"Clinton wants to

spend our mythical
budget surplus like
a kid in a candy
store."

for our national environment hidden in the
back pages of the newspapers. Two weeks ago,
the National Forest Service proposed a moratorium on road building in roadless areas of
national forests. The proposal, which defines
a roadless area as a one in which 5,000 or more
acres currently have no roads, would temporarily ban road construction on over 33 million acres of national forest.
Why get excited about road building? With
440,000 miles of roads, the National Forest
System boasts eight times as many roads as
the entire U.S. highway system. In fact, the
Forest Service has been termed the "largest
socializedroad building program in the world".
Funding for these roads is, not surprisingly,
provided by U.S. taxpayers. This vast network
of forest roads allows for extensive logging
operations in national forests. In addition to
incurring environmental costs, logging in national forests has been losing money for the
past several years.
Roads are a source of significant ecological
damage to forest ecosystems. Roads cause
erosion and often serve as a starting point for
landslides. For example, a U.S. Forest Service study found that 58% of the 905 landslides in the Clearwater National Forest in
1995-1996 were due to logging roads, while
another 12% were tied to timber harvest activities (Associated Press, 10/03/97). Erosion
caused by timber roads often changes stream
ecosystems as well. Streams in roadless areas
are some of the last habitat for endangered
species of fish.
Roads can have tremendous impacts on the
integrity, of forest ecosystems through their
effects on forest fauna. Many animals require
large, unfragmented areas of wilderness for
survival. Several such animals function as
keystone species, or species whose impact on
their ecosystem is large with respect to their
relative abundance. Wolves and grizzly bears
are two examples ofkeystone predators which
require low road densities for survival. The
presence of these species is essential for controlling populations of herbivores, which in
turn impact sensitive species of plants. The
loss of keystone predators due to high densities of roads in a forest can produce effects
which ripple through the entire ecosystem.
The National Forest Service road building
moratorium would provide roadless areas with
immediate, short term protection if it goes into
effect. The ban would supply Congress with
a window of opportunity in which to form legislation giving roadless areas permanent protection, a step which President Clinton endorsed in November. The currently proposed
moratorium, however, contains large exemptions. The Tongass National Forest in Alaska,
which is the largest national forest in the U.S.,
the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota, and several areas of forest in the Pacific
Northwest are exempted from the plan.
What can you do? If you have an interest in
the management of the U.S. national forests,
this is the time to get involved. The National
Forest Service is considering public comments
regarding the proposed moratorium untilFebruary 20th. If you want to comment, stop by
the EFMCP (Eastern Forests and Mountains
Conservation Project) table in Parrish Parlors

Black History Month
Comes to Swat

by the Bebe Miller Dance Co., and next
week will see the beginning of a faculty lecture series featuring professors
Tim Burke, Allison Dorsey, and Sarah
Willie. There will also be a film series
featuring four Africana films, and several discussions/lectures on topics such
as the history of blacks in the south,
black children in Philadelphia schools,
and black Africans in Zimbabwe. A
number of guest speakers are scheduled to lecture as well, including Craig
Wilder, author of In the Company of
Men: African Rebellion in New York
City, Julius Garvey, son of the worldrenowned black activist Marcus
Garvey, and Farai Chideya, CNN political correspondent and author of
Don't Believe The Hype.
In addition to these events, a three
day Diversity Conference entitled "Beyond the Box" is scheduled for the
weekend of February 20-22. Amy
Albert '9B, one of the student organizers, states that the conference "is designed to explore diversity at small liberal arts colleges by discussing issues
thatrelate specifically to small college
environments." She also explains that
the title "Beyond the Box" is meant to
encourage students to look beyond racial "boxes" and move from race to dis-

cussions of other matters that are important to college students in general.
Eight small liberal arts colleges have
been invited to attend the conference,
including Haverford, Williams, and
Union. The conference will feature keynote speaker Manning Marable, and
workshops will focus on such topics as
faculty diversity, race and feminism,
and building and maintaining support
groups.
The grand finale of the Black History
Month celebration will be a Jazz Concert followed by a semi-formal Caribbean Dinner Party on the weekend of
February 28th.
Since 1976, February has been officially designated the month for America
to bear witness to the progress ofblack
people and reflect upon the richness of
black culture, diversity, and contributions to society. As the campus commemorates Black History Month, however, it is important to remember that
to celebrate black history is to also celebrate American history. According to
Tim Sams, Black History Month offers
a healthy and progressive reminder of
the trials, tribulations, and accomplishments of a significant sector of our
population
peoples of African descent. "Black History Month," he believes, "is absolutely necessary in every venue, not just at Swat."

Bookstore Prices
Reasonable, Says Director
from BOOKS, page 1
reflect prevailing market conditions,
most students have taken advantage of
the free market and sold their books at
greater prices than they would receive
from the bookstore to other students
which, in turn, makes the books
cheaper for other students," says Owen
F. Lipsett 'Ol. Typically rates on this
market range from one-half to twothirds of the original bookstore price
for the book, making it more rewarding, economically, than even the highest rate of buy-back.
Grace has also recently considered
the Internet as a means of purchasing
books. The two most popular Internet
sites for buying books are Amazon
(www.amazon.com) and Barnes &
Noble (www.barnesandnoble.com)
and Grace acknowledges that Internet
prices are sometimes significantly better than Swarthmore's prices.
"If thebest possible price is on Amazon or Barnes & Noble Online, students should go for it. However, online
bookstores aren't necessarily reliable
or fast enough for class needs," says
Grace. "We cannot stop carrying certain books thinking that students will

buy from the Internet. I have thought
about ordering books online, but the details, especially return policies, are still
sketchy."
A spot check of various books available in the bookstore and online at
Amazon suggests that prices vary somewhat. A new introductory Biology text
costs $68.95 at Swarthmore and $74.95
through Amazon. A $22 International
Politics paperback was slightly less expensive at Amazon. And a Sociology
textbook that cost $34 in the bookstore
was only $24 online. In general, the
bookstore's prices and Amazon's prices
were fairly comparable, with many
online discounts being diminished as a
result of additional shipping and handling charges.
In addition to exploring the Internet
as an alternative supplier, Grace is also
evaluating the College's suppliers of
general merchandise. "I think prices
are reasonable given our buying power.
We don't buy millions ofnotebooks like
Staples... we don't always have the
lower price compared to Staples, but
compared to other small college bookstores, our prices are exceptionally low.
We're not in it for profit; it's a breakeven enterprise," says Grace.

College Planning
Committees Report
Progress to Students
by Nate Stulman

to outline at least some priorities over
the next several weeks.

The ten Planning Subgroups (PSGs)
of the College Planning Committee are
holding open forums this month to
bring the college community up to
speed on their planning efforts and to
seek the input and participation of students, faculty, and staff.
Seven of the ten PSGs held forums
last Friday. All ten are expected to hold
similar meetings next Friday, February 13, during Collection. The PSGs
are Admissions; Curriculum and Faculty Experience; Facilities; Financial
Aid; Proactive Regional and Local Efforts; Staffing; Student Experience;
Student Government; Technology; and
Visibility and Leadership in Higher
Education. The subgroups have been
meeting on a regular basis throughout
the year and are scheduled to present
their reports
including priorities for
theCollege over the next 10to 20 years
to the CPC this spring.
The Admissions subgroup, convened
by Hans Oberdiek and Robin Mamlet,
discussed a variety of issues in front
of an audience of 30 to 40 students,
faculty, staff, and administrators.
Members of the subgroup spoke about
issues of diversity in admissions,
legacy admission, early decision admission, and the increased competition
among top liberal arts and Ivy League
schools for prospective students.
Committee members stressed that
they are still grappling with these and
other issues and have not reached a
consensus for final recommendations.
Similarly, the Curriculum and Faculty
Experience subgroup, convened by
Jennie Keith, has been studying and
considering a host ofissues and expects

The Curriculum and Faculty Experience subgroup, encompassing the
standing Council on Education Policy,
is dealing mainly with problems of allocation and distributionof faculty. "It's
an economic problem: We have limited
resources and have to decide how to
allocate our resources to meet as many
of our needs as possible," says economist and subgroup member Mark

Kuperberg.
Committee members suggested that
although some academic departments
in the College are content with their
current number of faculty, most are vying for a limited number of new faculty
positions. Consequently, the subgroup
is considering ways of complimenting
new faculty positions with faculty
leaves and faculty teaching in concentrations. Keith suggested that at least
some of the additional tenure-track positions that are expected to result from
the subgroup's recommendations will
involve extensive cross-departmental
teaching responsibilities.
The Curriculum and Faculty Experience will also study Primary Distribution Requirements, graduation requirements, and minors over the course of
the next year. Consideration of
Swarthmore's graduation requirement
is likely to focus on foreign language
study, although members of the committee did not indicate whether this
meant an increase or decrease in the requirement. Primary Distribution requirements may also be reconsidered.
Possible alternatives may include new
divisions by type of learning instead of
the now familiar Humanities, Natural
Sciences, and Social Science divisions.

Leading Feminist Speaks at Swat
from NOW, page 1
mail piece
was it Pat Robertson or Jerry
Falwell?
feminism is not a movement about
equality but a movement designed to teach women
to kill their children, leave their husbands, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become
lesbians, you know, it's like, 'Whew!'And I think
that takes its toll when there is such name-calling, such ad hominem arguments thrown out, and
especially if you're young and you're looking to
have successful life. You want to have work that's
satisfying, you want to have family that fills your
soul, and so you get this imagery thrown at you
that says 'Feminists are ugly, hairy, man-haters
with no sense ofhumor' and I think it is hard then
to proudly call yourself a feminist. That's why I
like to do campus speaking, why I like to have a
lot of opportunity to interact with people, because
the very notion that you can't have a satisfying
and fulfilling life... I can't imagine any better way
to have a satisfying and fulfilling life than to act
on your principles and to have that sense of selfworth that comes along with the idea that you're
changing the world. And I think that a lot ofyoung
activists are there... even the ones who don't call
themselves 'feminists' now have an expectation
that they're going to be treated equally, and when
I was growing up we didn't have that expectation. It wasn't anywhere in our consciousness at
all that we could be fire fighters, police officers,
letter carriers, I mean it just wasn't. And it certainly wasn't in most of our minds that we could
have an equal partnership in marriage. And now I
find that even these T'm-not-a-feminist-but'
women, expect that they're going to have equal
treatment in the workplace, they expect that they
will be treated with respect and have dignity and
equal partnership in their families... So in that
sense again, I think that there's a much higher
consciousness level among men and women in
your generation and that some of that progress is
pretty secure. That's not to say that we don't need
the folks who self-identify as feminists, who are
activists, who keep pushing the edges, who keep
us from getting pushed back. But I'm really encouraged... We had a young feminists' summit last
year and we had middle school students come in,
twelve-year-olds, females that even I have to call
'girls' coming in and telling me about the choir
director in their junior high school choir who was
trying to make them sing 'Runaround Sue' and
told some girl from the chorus that she was supposed to strut around and slink around in front of
the choir and they were going to sing to her and
she was going to be Runaround Sue. And she objected, and the whole choir, boys and girls, signed
a petition and made the choir director change his
mind. So you know, I see that and I'm like "Wow!"
I don't care if they call themselves feminists,
they're doing it. It's really good stuff happening
out there.

Phoenix: How do you respond to popular criticism that NOW is an organization for white,
middle-class women?
Ireland: I think that the feminist movement and
NOW have the same difficulties that the rest of
the culture does in many ways. We can't grow up
in a culture like this and not pick up some, what
I've always called 'the outposts of the patriarchy'
in my mind. You internalize the things that are in
your culture, so I think that we always have to be
conscious of racism, classism, and all of the other
isms that divide us. The National Organization for
Women was founded by white and black women.
The statement of purpose was written in part by
an African-American women who was an Episcopalian minister... so I think that we have a good
history. We have a strong affirmative action program in the organization, and right now two of
the four national officers are women of color, a
third of the national board is women of color. In
that sense the affirmative action program has been
very successful, and also in helping to keep our
agenda broad so that we're talking not only about
birth control and abortion, but about the right to
have and raise our children, and that does mean
Head Start, it means food stamps for some
people... so we do, I think in our agenda, incorporate issues of broader concern to a lot of women.
And having said that, if you have a grassroots Organization with 500 chapters, and the chapters are
based in communities, and the communities are
segregated by race... I can tell you in Miami. I
don'tknow Philadelphia or other parts of the country as well but I can tell you in Miami and Washington by neighborhood who lives where. And I
can even tell you it's not just that Latinos and
Latinas live over there, but there's where thePuerto
Ricans are, there's where the Cubans are, there's
where the Nicaraguans are, here's where the African-Americans are who don't mix with the Haitians who don't like the Africans... there are those
housing patterns, and if you're going to have community-based chapters and the communities aren't
integrated, it is a real hurdle to overcome. I think
that the commitment to ending racism is very
strong and it's very difficult. It's like any other
issue actually. If you ask me 'Are we doing enough
to
fill in blank?' I would have to say 'No.' Are
we doing enough to end violence? No. Are we
doing enough to protect reproductive freedom?
No. We can't do enough. It's like a neverending
job. 50... I do take those issues seriously, I do take
those assertions with great concern, [but] they
don'treflect our history, they don'treflect our current composition, and often I think they are put
forward by people who really don't have our best
interests at heart. And at the same time I think
that this Women of Color and Allies summit will
have some very difficult discussions about times
that people have felt excluded or times when
people's issues were not included... it's hard work.

a productive worker to a place on the
welfare roll. In addition, people on
workfare could help to staff certain
undermanned day care centers,
thereby allowing still more people
to work.
As the economy globalizes, jobs
in developed countries become more
skill and knowledge intensive as
low-skill jobs are exported to developing countries. This is inevitable
and indeed desirable, free trade legislation only accelerates the process.
Knowledge intensive industries require an educated labor force, both
as workers and as visionary entrepreneurs.
Beginning with
Confucius, philosophers and governments everywhere have recognized
the value of education in producing
a capable workforce. In view of the
overcrowding in American classrooms, President Clinton's proposal
to build more schools and hire more
teachers in order to produce smaller
classes for young children is a wise
acknowledgement of the value of
giving children more individual attention in theirformative years. This
extra attention has been shown to
enhance their ability to learn later on.
Providing classrooms across
America with access to the World
Wide Web is likewise a positive nod
toward improving the intellectual
and skill development of students.
His proposals for a tax credit to allow virtually any capable student to
attend junior college and 220,000
Pell Grants are likewise helpful. An
area that still needs resolution, however, is the way in which a college
education has become less and less
affordable for the average American
student.
Although social spending is often
regarded as highly unpopular and excessive (which it is in many cases),
expanding workfare and extensive
funding for education are three vital
programs that make sound social and
economic sense. Workfare, though
it lacks the generous guarantees of
the previous version of welfare,
serves society and those on it by providing them with job experience and
society with work in exchange for
the money expended on the program.
In addition, it provides former welfare recipients with a path to work
in the private sector. Further welfare reform is risky, and would very
likely involve the same sort of thinking as the exonerable and inhumane
decision to take away health insurance for indigent disabled children,
the most defenselessmembers of society. While it is fair to expect ablebodied people to work in return for
government assistance, theose who
cannot work must be provided for.
As the economy globalizes, workers in countries such as the United
States will need to be highly skilled
to justify their relatively high wages
in economic terms. Improvements
in the public educational system
such as smaller classes and universal Internet access will help to make
future generations ofAmerican children better thinkers and later on,
better workers. Together, workfare
and improved educational programs
would create a more effective
American working class and
economy for the 21 st century.

Watching the
Heavens

Sincerely,

Record-breaking prof to retire after
lifetime of discovery
by Elizabeth Cho
Astronomy professor Wulff Heintz
greeted me at his Sproul Observatory
office with a quick firm handshake and
distracted air. He looked like a typical
work-absorbed scientist, with tousled
gray hair, a comfortable old sweater,
and slacks. Throughout our interview,
he frequently got up to show me papers that included stars named after and
discovered by him, or a framed picture
that he had drawn of the Mars' Lake of
Tithon. Later, he led me to the telescope
area where he joked, in his thick accent, "As you can see, I'm the honorary janitor here." Wastebaskets were
placed over the wooden floor to catch
leaks from the damaged and paint-peeling ceiling; as Professor Heintz pointed
them out to me, he realized one was
full and ran to empty it onto the grass.
His panic when he thought that the
wooden boards might be damaged
struck me as an expression of love for
the observatory, where he has studied
the stars for over thirty years. This is
the last semester he expects to teach at
Swarthmore College.
■

Liz: What does astronomy mean to
you?
Wulff: I have been in astronomical
research now for almost half a century.
I have mostly been working with binary stars; that is, stars which look like
one, but on close inspection are two or
sometimes three stars, and they orbit
one another. I have made some 50,000
observations by eyepiece, and many

this inphotographic observations
cluded 900 newly discovered binary
stars...l have an obituary, what I call the
list of publications, and that runs now to
172 [publications]. The one hundred seventy-third was just submitted.
Liz: When you make a discovery about
a star, what does that feel like?
Wulff: After you've done it nine hundred times, it becomes routine...l hold a
world record for orbit studies
I have
investigated almost five hundred stars for
that.
Liz: How did you decide to study astronomy?
Wulff: There were mainly two causes.
First, I was always interested in mathematics. Then, in World War 11, we had
a beautiful blackout, a wonderfully dark
so I could observe with binocusky
lars or a small telescope. Immediately
after the war, with all the destruction, and

Liz: Where were you during World War

Wulff: Mostly in my hometown in
northern Bavaria, except for the last
month in the war when I was hiding from
the Nazis. I went to friends in the country, peasants, and live [sic] in the attic.
Liz: Why were you hiding?
Wulff: Because I got an order to report

Liz: Was he trying to fight against
Wulff: No, no. You cannot fight the
Nazis. If you fight them, you land in
an extermination camp, or a concentration camp. No, you can just voice your
displeasure and already that is intensely
disliked.
Liz: What was it like when you were

which they were evicted because it was
declared a Jewish house. In the winter
of 1940, there were still Jews in the
area...then it was said they were resettled in areas in the East and now we
know they were largely murdered. In the
first years of the Nazis, they [the Nazis] had to do a lot with their political

they were the first
either to be kicked out or to go to concentration camps.
Liz: What was the general sentiment

which was the best-known concentration camp. So you see, there was an enormous fear. What happens is you find the

on the opposite side and therefore persecuted, and a large middle part
which
means you pull your head in and hold your
breath. It was an unpleasant time, but it

you grow up faster.
Liz: Is that really an advantage?
Wulff: No, no, it was not an advantage.
You learn to hate. But you also learn to
mature
to develop your own judgement.
Liz: What do you learn to hate?
Wulff: The Nazis. The ones who brutalize you. During late 1944, when the bombing by the Allies got more severe, the Nazis grabbed us [schoolchildren] and we
had to clean out their property and put it
on trucks so it could be brought out of the
town. The age for drafting went down to
the age of fourteen.
Liz: What changes have you noticed in
the time you've been here at Swarthmore?
Wulff: Since I came, the student body
has increased by fifty percent. We had 900
and we have 1350 now. The faculty has
increased by ten percent, or maybe twenty
percent. The administration has increased
by 450 percent. However, it [the administration] used to be understaffed. This
[trend] is not restricted to Swarthmore. I
hear similar things from my colleagues at

Restaurant Review

Authentic Taste of the Orient in Upper Darby: Woo
Rae Kwan Serves up Exciting Korean Cuisine
by Rachel May Adams and Joanna Perry
When Rachel Buurma and Brantley Bryant wrote
the food column, we heard their pain. Week after week
they were forced to explore alternative dining cuisine
t0...n0 don'tsay it...our very own...Sharpies. We knew
it was really rough, and when they stopped doing the
column, we could understood why they just couldn't
take it anymore. A few weeks ago, the Phoenix ran a
column about how the editors wanted more student
participation. Fine upstanding members of the community that we are, we realized that we had to take a
stand and as painful and difficult as it might be, we
had to write the food column, even if that did mean
going without Sharpies "crunchy cod" night. We then
feared that people might feel sorry for us and we
thought about creating a pen name...like, I don't
know...we're cute chicks...the spice girls are cute
chicks...we're writing about food...spices. This soon
fell through, however, when we realized that we all
wanted to be "likes to eat" spice. We also decided that
we won't want to wear such short dresses when all of

these different foods begin to accumulate on our thighs.
The next realization to hit us was, why would we want
to be the spice girls when we could just use the identities of five cool Swattie women, Mary-Jean Chen,
Joanna Perry, Rachel Adams, Cayley Pendergrass and
Arati Davis? There were originally only three of us
who were planning on writing this column (Mary-Jean,
Joanna and Rachel), but the thought arose that we
might be biased in one way oranother, so we recruited
the help of two other students (Cayley and Arati) to
get an unprejudiced account of the different restaurants we'll be visiting.
For this first review, we decided to go to a Korean
restaurant because Arati had been talking about the
amazing Korean food in Upper Darby for just about
as long as we've known her. I know, you're thinking,
who goes to Upper Darby? It's a reasonable question
because there isn't actually that much going on there,
but this restaurant was good. Although it wasn't too
difficult to locate, we managed to drive past it two or
three times before realizing we had come to the right
spot. It's right in between a liquor store (don't even

bother if you're under 21...n0t that we tried, of
course...) and a Korean market. When we finally saw
the flashing neon sign that said "Restaurant," however, we knew we were in for a night of quality dining.
Contrary to the shabby exterior, the restaurant was
very pleasant. Arati felt that the dark wood paneling
and all of the plants made for an atmosphere that was
"homey except for the dragon-like woman who looked
like she was going to sacrifice us." (It's true, she did
go a little heavy on the lip liner.)Once seated at our
table, we immediately noticed the pretty metal chopsticks and beautiful teacups.
None of us had ever had Korean food before, so
we were somewhat out of our element, but our waiter
was great about offering us suggestions and showing
us how to eat our food. Cayley and Rachel had some
difficulty, as vegetarians, finding Korean food on the
menu that they could eat (there restaurant also served
Chinese dishes and Japanese sushi). While the restaurant was very accommodating about making a

Hell on Wheels
Dear Hell on Wheels,
Well, first of all, you need to put down the Harlequin Romances and take a cold shower. You are out
of control.
TheBear understands young love. Once I was frolicking in the forest under the lustrous light of the
winter moon when I suddenly became aware that
something was watching me. I looked around and
saw the shadowy figure of another bear peering intently at me from betwixt the trees. The bear's steady
gaze seemed to pierce the deepest recesses of my
soul, and I felt the waves of excitement surge beneath my fur. The air around us seemed electrified
as I ran toward the bear, flinging myselfthrough the
trees and into the awaiting arms ofmy new soulmate.
Unfortunately, the bear turned out to be a large, dead
shrub.
Hey, give me a break. It was dark, and it was mating season.
Anyway, it is not surprising to this wizened bear
that you would fall for your shuttle driver. Where
else will you find a mate who is dependable, on time,
and does what you ask him to do? It makes you
wonder how much better this world would be if you
could buy love for minimum wage. But the world
being what it is, the only way to ease your swollen
heart is to profess your love to the shuttle driver.
There are several ways you can do this.
First, you want to draw attention to yourself, right?
You must somehow differentiate yourself from the
multitudes of other love-struck passengers. While
there are many ways to do this, like wearing a pretty
dress or donning a silly hat, the most sure-fire way
to get yourself noticed is to wear no clothes at all.
That's right. Ride the shuttle buck naked. It doesn't
matter how immersed he is in his girly, bubble-gum
pop music, he can't ignore you in the buff.
Unfortunately, unless you time your arrival perfectly, you might be waiting nekkid in the Rose Garden for longer than the weather man would advise
at this time of the year. The Bear knows, love ain't
worth a frost-bitten bum. Not to worry, though, for
the Bear has alternate ideas.
After getting your dinnerTarble credit in Snapple
and cheesy-poofs, climb into the back seat of the
shuttle and "accidentally" roll one of your juice
bottle underneath his seat. Exclaim, "Oh my God! I
just dropped a bottle of juice under your seat! That
is so dangerous! I must fetch it!" Then dive beneath
his legs and "fetch."
You could also get on the shuttle at the beginning
of his shift and refuse to get off. After you've been
driving around in silence for a couple of hours, he'll
probably ask you if there is anyplace in particular
that you like like to go. Gaze deeply into his eyes
and say, "Drive me to ecstasy." He'll probably get
the idea.
If none of these approaches seems to be working,
you might have to try something more drastic. Try
hiding in the bushes behind Willets on a particularly overcast evening. As your intended drives by,
leap into the path of the shuttle and let him hit you.
Be sure to roll up onto the hood of the van so he can
get a good look at you, for he might not stop to render aid if he thinks you are merely a professor. Once
he gets out of the car, if you are unlucky enough to
still be breathing, hold your breath so that he will be
forced to give you mouth-to-mouth. Then, just let
nature take its course.
Good hunting!

The Swarthmore Phoenix

FEBRUARY 6,1998

The Rising and Fernea Shatters Stereotypes
Fallen of Lame
January Movies
ney, Elizabeth Warnock Fernea intervenes in this chain of thinking that reasons Islamic feminism out of existence. Fernea is a scholar and filmmaker who has written extensively
about the Middle
East, and as the
former director
of women's studies at the University of Texas, she
is steeped in
American feminist thought.
Fernea's academic
work
takes place at a
fascinating intersection, precisely
because so many
of us tend to
think of Islamic
feminism as a
null set. The
book chronicles
a two-year journey through the Islamic
world, a trip in which she gave lectures
and ran discussions, while interviewing hundreds of women, trying to get
a sense ofhow Muslim feminists think
about themselves.
She learns strategies that American
feminists have built for themselves,
and spent a great deal of energy promoting in our own cultural context.
One of my favorite incidents in
Fernea's book occurs when she is talking with a group of Moroccan women
intellectuals, trying to persuade them

It has long been said
that January and February are studio "dumping
grounds." That is, movies that didn't quite turn
out well or would have
trouble finding an audiAltered States ence in a "blockbuster"
season get excreted into
Patrick Runkle
theaters as studios ride
their big holiday hits all the way to the bank.
Two recent releases, Fallen and Deep Rising, fit this
description perfectly. They are both mid-budgeted studio features that have been completely dumped and
will likely disappear from theaters in relatively short
order.
Fallen stars Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, a
Philadelphia homicide detective who, in the first 10
minutes of the movie, witnesses the execution of a
serial killer (Elias Koteas) he captured. Of course,
after the execution, the spirit of the condemned man
inhabits random people in an attempt to get revenge
against Hobbes.
It's all standard thriller stuff, with Donald Sutherland
in the Donald Sutherland role, as Hobbes' slightly
shady boss, and dependable John Goodman as Hobbes'
partner.
Fallen is filled with spooky shots, showy
camerawork, and general weirdness that isn't quite as
effective as it could be. It's in the long tradition of
executed-serial-killer-comes-back-to-life movies, and,
unfortunately, the genre is pretty lifeless to begin with.
Still, there are moments of effectiveness in Fallen,
mostly coming from the believability of Denzel in the
lead role. He has always been a commanding screen
presence, and his performance in this movie solidifies
his ability to look good in the midst of a below-average production. Gregory Hoblit's direction is solid,
and the Philadelphia locations (I saw this being shot
in the fall of '96) look great.
Deep Rising is another story. During my brief stint
as a film student at the University of Southern California, 1 met USC Film School grad Stephen Sommers,
the writer/director of Deep Rising, and, well, let's just
say I don't have a high opinion of his abilities. Like
most other high-profile film student projects, Deep Rising is a collection of ideas, plotlines, scenes, and even
individual camera angles from other movies.
Treat Williams stars as Finnegan, a boat captain who
is hired by a bunch of mercenaries to take them to a
luxury liner in the South Seas, so they can destroy it
with their large weaponry.
Of course, by the timeWilliams and the mercenaries get to the luxury liner, it has been attacked by something from the deep waters. What follows is a tiresome Aliens/Predator retread that is completely dead
on arrival. Even make-up effects master Rob Bottin's
designs can't help this turkey, which totally overstays
its welcome. Treat Williams' smarmy screen presence
and veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith's score are its
only redeeming features.

you are an American, you think of the
veil
that powerful
symbol that makes
many Muslim women
different from most of
us. As with so many
topics, public discussion balances atop a
fulcrum, a single focus ofenergy that polarizes and simplifies
the discussion. Of
course, in many ways,
the veil is a good
place to start a dialogue on the place of
women in Islam, as
shown by the fruitful
discussion organized
last semester by the
Muslim Students Association.
What do you think of when you picture a Muslim feminist? Chances are,
you don't do it very often. In mainstream
American culture, Islam is often thought
of as a universe in which women are tremendously disempowered, with the veil
as the ultimate signifier of that
disempowerment. If woman are feminists, how can they cover themselves?
Ifthey don't cover themselves, how can
they be Muslims?

burning themselvesrevealed the profound
depression and despair from which many
Uzbek women suffer. The self-immolations defied medical and psychological
explanation. It seemed to be a spontaneous and hideous trend.
Such paradoxes raise serious questions
about what it means to work for social
change in a global context. Fernea asks
really powerful questions that are not always intuitive. For example, is feminism
one thing, or is it many different things?
Is oppression one thing, or is it many
things? Is it possible for people to unite
across borders and work for global transformation, or is it better for them to focus
on issues with local ramifications?
Fernea confesses that thereis something
slightly suspicious about a non-Muslim
American woman writing an apparently
definitive account ofIslamic feminism. As
a result, she is extremely cautious. The
book has no thesis, and it is probably not
a great contribution to intellectuals in either of her fields.
The rambling account ofher travels, including that so-and-so was wearing suchand-such, are more reminiscent of V;l.
Warshawski than of academic writing.
Her work is essentially a detective story.
In Search of Islamic Feminism has no
denouement, other than perhaps the existence ofIslamic feminism. But it's still
pretty exciting, I think, to discover something that is not supposed to exist.

Exotic Korean Cuisine
from page 5
couple of dishes, the Jap Che and the Dol Sot Bi Bim
Bop, "sans" meat, there was some difficulty translating this idea to the kitchen; they sent first Cayley's
and then Rachel's dish to the table 100%
vegetarian...except for the beef. The Dol Sot Bi Bim
Bop was a rice dish cooked and then served in a crock
pot so that the rice got crunchy on the bottom...it
sounds gross but it was yummy. Cayley noted particularly about this dish, the "weird fried egg on top. I
think that's so goofy." The fried egg was then mixed
in with the rest of the dish (Rachel enjoyed this "do it
yourself aspect of the meal) along with a spicy black
bean sauce added at your discretion accordingly with
just how spicy you could take it (Yeah, you know it,
we're spicy women, black bean sauce all over it).
Rachel's Jap Che, a dish with clear vermicelli noodles,
shredded beef (normally), scallions, carrots and mushrooms, was also quite good though a little oily.
Arati and Jo opted for the Bui Go Ki, thinly sliced
tender beef marinated with garlic, sesame seeds, scallions and onion. This dish also came with seven side
dishes including spinach salad, bean sprouts salad, kim
chi and a bowl of small whole dead fish salad (no one
was quite up to trying that), along with another slightly
less spicy bean sauce. The "do it yourself aspect was
in full force as a small barbecue was placed on the
table for Arati and Jo to cook their beef. We observed
some Americans at a nearby table wrapping their salads and beef in a lettuce wrapper and then eating it the
way you might eat a moo shu pancake in a Chinese
restaurant. While none of us were Korean food connoisseurs, we found many of the dishes to be most
closely related to foods we'd had at Chinese restaurants. Distinctive about these dishes, however was an
underlying sweet, spicy (at your discretion) and almost musty flavor that was unlike anything any of us
had ever had at a Chinese restaurant.
While the prices for each dish ranged from medium
to high priced, the portions were huge. We weren't
able to finish all the dishes that we ordered, but we
still left the restaurant stuffed. We all agreed that by
sharing dishes, you would be treated to a very good
value meal. The restaurant was 15 to 20 minutes away
by car, but also a block away from the 69th street Septa
station and therefore accessible by either bus or train
as well. The restaurant is located at 7048 Terminal
Square, Upper Darby, PA 19082 and can be reached
by telephone at 610-352-1165.

of one of the central tenets ofWestern
feminism: that being a woman gives one
a unique, valuable perspective on the
world. Her Muslim colleagues seem to
deny the claim. They can't figure out
why she would say such a thing. Our
American friend is dismayed.
Then, suddenly, it dawns on one of the
Muslim woman what Fernea is saying.
She asks her, do you only mean that
women speak in a different voice from
men? Well, of course they do
in the
world of women!
Fernea is right in teasing out the meanings of the incident. Something that in
the United States seems like a controversial claim is utterly apparent to
women who live in a culture in which
the sexes are highly segregated. Western feminists are likely to regard such
segregation as the ultimate symbol of
patriarchy. Not only is the claim rooted
in cultural bias, but it is also used to
describe Islamic culture as primitive,
and to deflect attention from serious
problems in the United States.
The "standard" targets of political action cannot always be transported across
cultural and political boundaries. For
example, in newly independen
Uzbekistan, abortion on demand is not
only fully legal, it is paid for by the government. Uzbek women, on learning
about the high cost of day care in
America, ask Fernea why American
women don't stand up for their rights.
Yet it can't be said that Uzbekistan is
a paragon of women's liberation. In the
late 1980s, a shocking wave of women

The men's basketball team fell to 0-18 on the year after a
61-47 loss to Gettysburg and a disappointing 47-46 loss at
rival Haverford. Swarthmore struggled from the field and
the line in both games, resulting in their lowest back-toback point total this year.
On Saturday, the Garnet Tide clashed with a tough
Gettysburg opponent. Swarthmore led the way through most
of the first half, but a late Gettysburg flurry turned the lead
into a 21-19 halftime deficit. Swarthmore opened the second half on fire, pulling out to a 31 -27 lead, mostly on the
shooting by junior co-captains Tim Schofield and J.J. Purdy.
But when sophomore point guard Cassidy Westbrook
picked up his fourth foul just five minutes into the half,
Swarthmore scoring opportunities were limited. Gettysburg
took this advantage and went on a 14-3 run taking command of the game.
The Tide shot just 30% from the field and turned the ball
over 15 times. Schofield finished with a game high 20 points
and 9 rebounds. Mike Schall '99, who has been continually
improving, chipped in 9 rebounds.
Team records do not matter when a Swarthmore team
matches up against the rival Haverford team in any sport.
Attempting to defy the odds, the Tide opened up the game
with an 11-7 lead, led by Schall's 7 points. The rest of the
first half was sloppy as both teams shot under 35% for a 2321 half-time Swat lead.
Momentum then swung back and forth between the two

and scored 9 consecutive points for a 42-39 lead. Schall
then tied the game with a clutch three, but Haverford came
right back and scored.for a 44-42 lead.
Greg Holtmeier 'OO then hit a pull-up jumper with the
shot clock winding down to knot the score once again, but
Haverford hit three consecutive free throws to take the lead
once again. With seven seconds left, Haverford put Schofield
at the line, and he calmly sank both shots. Swarthmore
fouled again with five seconds left, grabbed the rebound off
the missed free throw, but could not set up as it had no timeouts and Haverford stole a close one.
"We had chances to win, but we couldn't finish. There
were opportunities for someone to win the game, but as a
team, we choked," added associate coach Kurk Daulerio '95,
summing up the frustration the team felt after the loss.
Swarthmore was awful from the field (35%) and from
behind the arc (5-20 for 25%). But in a game when one
made free throw would have tied the game, Swarthmore hit
just 5-13 from the charity stripe.
On the positive side, Swarthmore battled thefavored Fords
all game and played impressive defense, and team members are looking forward to the February 21 rematch.
Swarthmore hosts Ursinus tomorrow night at 8:00, with a
Junior Varsity game preceding at 6:00. Swat lost the earlier
meeting by nine points, but look forward to upsetting the
Bears.

Women's Basketball Falls to
Two Conference Rivals
by Jean Quinn
The women's basketball had a difficult

week, dropping two important conference
games to Franklin and Marshall and

Haverford, after defeating nearby Rosemont
College. This week's results bring the Garnet to 5-12 overall, 1 -9 in the Centennial Con-

ference.
The team made an easy game hard, squan-

dering a large lead against Rosemont last
Thursday. A flat beginning at the start of the
second halfallowed Rosemont to get back into
[he game, and it was only in the final few
minutes that the 71-55 win was assured. It
was a career night for many players. Kristen
English 'Ol led the Garnet with a career high
22 points, hitting five three-pointers. Heather
Marandola 'Ol posted 17 points and 13 rebounds, and Jean Quinn '99 added 10points
a nd pulled down a career-high 17 boards.
Michelle Walsh '9B tossed in 12 points and
grabbed 7 boards. Lily Marsh 'Ol had a career best 8 points and also grabbed 4 rebounds.
The Garnet hosted the Diplomats from F &
M;and suffered a disappointing loss, 56-39.
Walsh led the squad with 8 points and 10
boards. Leslie Young matched her career high,
Posting 7 points. "It was very disappointing
after all the heart and energy that went into
tne game," Young commented.
Putting in two new offenses, the team reor-

ganized their plan of attack before facing rival Haverford Wednesday night. The Fords
came out strong, and went on a 17-3 run to
open the game. The closest the Garnet ever
got was 7 points. They ultimately fell, 57-45.
The team had an inordinate amount of trouble
breaking the press and executing on offense.
Quinn led the team with 16 points and 12 rebounds. Marandola had 13 points and 7
boards, and English tossed in 10 points.
Coach Adrienne Shibles cited many factors
that contributed to the loss that could have
been controlled: the Garnet allowed them 18
offensive rebounds whilethey got only 6; they
had 19 turnovers compared to Haverford's 12;
and they allowed the Leonard sisters to score
40 of the Fords' 57 points.
"We need to put the Haverford loss behind
us and regroup. It's always tough to lose to a
big rival, but we have many more winnable
games on the schedule that we must look towards," said Shibles. Michelle Walsh shared
her reflections on the season, "We've had a
lot of really close games lately, and it seems
like we're right there. We're competitive in
most of our games now, but we justcan't find
that extra push to put us among the elite in
the conference."
The Garnet travel to Bryn Mawr for a Saturday afternoon contest before traveling to
Washington College. The squad is home next
Thursday at 7pm against Immaculata.

Alejandro Montero 'OO, andAlec Stall '9B,
all won by decision. Pete Balvanz '9B, won
by a technical fall. Balvanz and Stall both
posted wins for Swat against Ursinus. Stall,
after mending a back injury, made his debut appearance this season by going 2-0.
Results from Thursday's meet against
Albright will be forthcoming. Swat will
travel to Wesleyan on Saturday to finish up
their regular season. They will be facing
Williams College and Wesleyan in tri-meet
action.
With two remaining matches left, Swarthmore wrestlers are beginning to prepare
for Centennial Conference championships.
This preparation includes consolidating,
simplifying, and cleaning up techniques
and skills that have been improving all season. The wrestlers will also make sure their
fitness level is peak. "I am really excited
abouthow the team is coming together. Everyone has the potential to do very well,
and conference championships should be
very exciting," commentedBalvanz.
This Sunday and Monday the wrestlers
begin eliminations. The members of the
team who share the same weight class will
wrestle off to decide who will wrestle in
the championships. Elimination bouts will
be held between John Fiorello '9B, and
Adrian Wilson '99, at the 134 lb weight
class.At 142 lbs, Gaines, Tirian Mink '9B,
and Aaron Kobernick 'OO will face off.
There is a possible elimination at ISO between Balvanz and the remaining 142
pounders. Jesse Bean 'OO, and MattKahn
'99, will wrestle off for the 158 pound position. Heavy weights, Sean Lewis 'OO, and
Paul Willenberg 'OO, will also wrestle off.
Swarthmore will host the Centennial
Championships on Saturday, February 14,
beginning at noon.

Swimming
Thwarted by
Gettysburg
by Helen Oliver
This past Saturday, the men and women
of Swarthmore swimming fell once again
to the powerhouse of Gettysburg College.
Racing in murky water and facing superior Gettysburg depth, the Garnet teams
both lost by a hefty margin. The women's
final score came to 72-133, while the men's
meet ended at 66-139.
On the positive side, Mark Friedberg '9B
demonstratedhis continuing dominance in
the distance events, winning both the 1000
and 500 freestyles. His times of 10:24.87
and 4:57.31, respectively, were among his
best for the season.
Also performing well for the men was
Ted Sherer 'Ol. His 200 breastroke time
of 2:17.06 was fast enough to win the race
handily. Only a few seconds later, teammate Fred Gerson '99 touched in second,
thus serving the Bullets with their only 12 loss of the meet.
For the women, Molly Marino '9B posted
several season-best performances and finished the day with two wins of her own.
In the 200IM she raced to a quick 2:19.99,
and in the 200 backstroke she sped to a phenomenal 2:15.78.
Another highlight of the meet was Junior Shari Linden's conference qualifying
swim in the 200 butterfly. Returning from
a semester abroad, her dedication in the
pool since winter break clearly contributed
to her stopping the clock a full two seconds under the cut.
This weekend the team pays tribute to its
six graduating seniors, as it expects to annihilate Ursinus in its last home meet of
the season.
