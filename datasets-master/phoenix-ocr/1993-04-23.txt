Conservative Speaker
D'Souza to Address Campus
Lecture to focus on multiculturalism and affirmative action
by MATTHEW SCHENK

"My basic arguement is that we should
not tolerate the abuses of equality and free

speech simply because of thefear of returning
to thebad old ways of the past. Nobody wants
to return to the past. I want to look at the
policies of the future."
That's how Dinesh D'Souza described
the theme ofhis upcoming, and already controversial, Swarthmore lecture. D'Souza, who
is currently a research fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute, is slated to appear at
Swarthmore this Thursday, April 29, at 8:00
p.m. in the Lang Performing Arts Center's
Pearson-Hall Theatre.
D'Souza is being brought here by the
Swarthmore College Republicans, who have
heavily publicized the event despite intense
student criticism. Many students have taken
offense to D'Souza's charge that affirmative
action admissions policies weaken educational standards, while others have accused
the College Republicans of exploiting his
Indian background to create racial tension on
campus.
The hostile reaction to the announcement ofD'Souza's visithas some members of
CollegeRepublicans worried that the lecture,
which will be followed by an extensive question and answer session, might turn into an
emotional free-for-all. D'Souza, however,
was rather encouraged by the news of controversy surrounding his appearance. "It makes
me even more eager to come. My challenge
to the protesters is to come to the lecture."
D'Souza added that there, they would be
given the opportunity to "expose my ignorance."
This will not be thefirst timethatD Souza
has visited the Swarthmorecampus. In 1985,
*

shortly after he graduated from Dartmouth
College, he debated Jeff Morley (then an
editor for The Nation) on issues concerning
Central America. D'Souza added that he is
familiar with Swarthmore's liberal background, and thus does not expect to have
people"lining up afterwards to be converted."
His objective, he commented, is to "try to
persuade open-mindedpeople. When it comes
to activists, my goal is to sow some seeds of
doubt."
The majority ofhis lecture will be spent
discussing the ideas he addressed in his book,
Illiberal Education: The Politics ofRace and
Sex on Campus, in which he points out some
of the flaws he sees in the current education
system, and "offers some concrete alternatives to affirmative actionand themulticultural
curriculum." He also plans to use the Swarthmore lecture as an opportunity to address
some issues pertaining to a book that he is
planning to write in the near future. The book,
D'Souza commented, is about racism and
what distinguishes Western from non-Westem cultures. Part of his talk will include
"testing out ideas in order to get a reaction."
While he recognizes that thereaction from a
S warthmoreaudience will most likely be critical, he added that he "enjoys a combative
challenge from audiences," and he hopes that
overall, there will be "a spirited but civil
debate."
In addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute (a conservative D.C.
think-tank),D'Souza is currently the editorof
Crisis Magazine, and in 1987-88 was a Senior
Domestic Policy Analyst in the Reagan Administration. While attending Dartmouth
College, he was the editor of The Dartmouth
Review.
Recently, D'Souza has appeared on the

Forum for Free Speech, the Office of the
President, the Office of the Dean, the Black
Studies Program and the Political Science

The College Republicans, who are involved in the organization of Mr. D'Souza's
visit, are expecting heavy turnout for the
lecture, and advise those interested to arrive
early to get seats. The lecture is expected to
last about45 minutes, and will be followed by
an extensive question and answer period.

are poised to take over The Phoenix, in a
takeover that is sure to boost the struggling
weekly's prestige among its readers. "After
being involved with ThePhoenix for two and
half years, I'd hate to see it fade away," said

Taylor.
His co-editor and closefriend Clay, who
edited Mjumbe, the African American literary magazine, for two years, is eager to help
take The Phoenix in a new direction. "I've
invested a lot of time and energy in journalism," said Clay. "I've always wanted to work
with The Phoenix; most ofmy efforts, however, were spent helping re-vamp Mjumbe.
I'm satisfied withthe course it has [Mjumbe]
taken, but I feel it's time to move on," he

Taylorhas worked as News editor, Sports
editor, Opinion editor and Managing editor of
The Phoenix, and feels this experience will
help him as co-Editor-in-Chief. Both Taylor
and Clay bring extensive editorial, administrative, and desk-toppublishing experience in
addition to their writing talents.
"We've worked together in a variety of
capacities, in and out of class;" said Clay.
"We've done research projects, and shared
editorialduties in the past among otherthings."
The future editors have great plans for
next semester's Phoenix.. Both hope to invoke a commitment to journalistic excellence

along with campus enthusiasmfor the paper.
"Both Disan and I have high regards and
standards for all our endeavors—academic
and extracurricular,'* notes Clay. "We hope
that the pressure we place on ourselves to
perform will inspire the staffand enhance the

newspaper."
Crucial to this mission, according to
Taylor, is the infusion of new vitality and
talent with former experience and insight
"We want to combine the old and new—creating an atmosphere where the veterans
and the rookies can work together," joked
Taylor.
"Speakingofveterans and rookies, we're
desperately seeking Sports editors," interjected Clay.
"Among other things..." observed Taylor.
Whileboth editors plan to make changes,
they also appreciate some of the improvements made in the past "We plan to continue
to utilize the College Press Service, which

"What do you think of when

That is the question one seventh

asked in herletter to Mayor Rendell
protesting the dirt and violence of
her North Philadelphia neighborhood. But Kensington means more
to manyofitspeople thantheneedles
and tires and broken glass that clutter the streets, and it has come to
mean more to the Swarthmore students involved in projects in
Kensington.

Jill Clark '95, Ajit Jagdale '93, and

site because of its representative
populations of Irish, Vietnamese,
African American, and Hispanic
students, and thus we all (including

'95, Daniel Long '94, Becca
Kolasky '95, Elizabeth Frost '96,
Aaren Freeman '93, Jeanette Liou
'95, Matt Lawlor '95 and Dave
Hochschild '93) descended upon
Kensington. After the first day,
however, we quickly realized that

because the kids were so frustrated
with the Utter, violence and drugs
they face every day, it was necessary to shift the focus to empowering them to speak out against the
chaos and act in positive ways to
improve it. The older grades wrote
letters to the Mayor, which appeared
in thePhiladelphia Daily News, and
also heard from community members who have started coalitions to
clean up playgrounds and stop drug
dealing on their streets. All the
grades painted banners with messages such as 'Working Hands,
Working Together', 'Stop the Violence', and 'Peace on the Streets,'
which now hang from the El on
Kensington Avenue.
Clark and Atkins brought
Kensington community members
and more Swarthmore students together to clean up and fence off
three empty lots during the Spring
Break Service Project. This time,
they faced many more technical
problems, including finding donors
offencing and otherequipment, digging post holes through layers of
broken cement and brick, pouring
new cement, welding and drilling.
Despite the challenges of finding
housing, grassroots organizing, stolenfence posts (market value equal
to a vial of crack), and April blizzards, some Swarthmore members
ofthe projectand Kensingtonneighbors are continuing work on the lots
by building flower beds and plant-

ing trees.

jobs. The kids interviewed each

need for planning, pragmatism, and

same time, thecollege doesnot have
the resources to meet this growth.
As a result, the job description and
focus will have to change. "The job
will give greater emphasis to volunteer programs in Chester. The college wants to provide students with
opportunities for volunteering and
service, but we also want to make an
impact. Students, as well as the
administration and faculty, see ourselves as having a commitment to
the neighboring community of
Chester, so our efforts will be focused there," said Gross.
The job description will also

begun to look for candidates to fill

Student Wallets Feel the Pain of High Book Prices
by ELIAN A MILLER
A memorandumaddressed to members oftheBookstore
Committee from the Bookstore Director, Kathleen Grace,
analyzed theexpense of textbooksper course for this past fall
and determined the average cost of required books for a
course to be $75.11. However, the discovery that one history
course book list total came to $328.50, one philosophy course
book list total came to $228.20, and 8 courses' books cost
over $150.00 has exposed the fact that manyfaculty members
may simply not realize the cost of thebooks they are requiring
for each course.
"I don't think $75 [for the average course book list] is
bad at all," said Biology Professor Barbara Stewart "But
whenyou you get over $2OO for a course, that's quite high."
Stewart, a memberof theBookstore Committee, which
is comprised ofmembers of the administration, faculty, and
student body, emphasizedthefact that theCommittee was not
trying to point fingers at any particular faculty member.
"Basically what we're saying is that the students are concerned [about the high cost of required textbooks] and the
faculty should be too," she said.
However, according to Stewart and Grace, in the past,
the faculty had to make an "active" effort to find out the cost
of books they were requiring for a course. Quite often the
copies of books they reviewed from the publisher did not
have prices on them. In order to find out about price, a faculty
member had to either look it up in Books in Print or specifically ask the bookstore, said Grace.
A review of the book costs from thefall of 1992 shows
that theaverage cost ofcourses' required texts varied considerably by department. The biology, chemistry, Chinese,
classics, computer science, dance, engineering, French, German, math, music, peace studies, philosophy, physics, sociology/anthropology, and theater departments all have average course book costs of the average $75.00 or less. The art,
economics, English, education, history, linguistics, political
science, psychology, and Spanish departments all had average course book costs above the average of $75.00.
Stewart attributed the lower cost of sciences course
books to the fact that the sciences generally require one
textbookthat is used all semester. In thenon-sciences several
tradebooks are required. At seven to ten dollars a piece "they
add up," said Stewart.

-Distribution of Courses by Coursebook Price Range-

Students, too, have noticed the discrepancy between the
cost of science and non-science books. Eunice Cheung '93,
said, "I'm a physicist, and the physics department generally
tries to keep costs down. But I took a PDC soc/anth course [a
year ago] and it cost me more than my other three courses put
together...The more expensive courses tend not to be the
science courses."
The bookstore is trying some new ways to alleviate the
problem of high prices of course books. First of all, for the
first time, faculty members will receive the prices on their
textbook requisition forms. According to Grace and Textbook Manager Nancy Loeffelholz, "these prices [will] represent the selling price of the book the last time it was used as a
text" In a memo addressed to faculty, Graceand Loeffelholz
warn that the "current price is most likely a little higher."
Grace said that the bookstore had adopted this new policy so
that faculty members could "consider price when choosing"
the required textbooks.
This new policy will allow faculty to atleast see the prices
of the books if the course has been previously taught Grace
said also that when a paperback edition is available, faculty
members are also apprised of the fact She also wanted
students to know that thebookstore now sells no books above
list price. She urged students to bring it to her attention ifthey

ever discovered otherwise.
It seems that these changes will be positive ones. Many
interviewed students said they often cannot afford to buy all
the books on the required list and either end up not reading
them or working out elaborate schemes to share books with
friends also in the class.
"I think thebooks most definitely cost too much," said
Rakhee Goyal '93. "It's not necessary to always have the
brand new edition...l haven't bought some textbooks. I
bought the cheap ones."
Some students said they had even decided not to take a
course based on the price of the books required.
"I think it's especially hard for freshmen,'' said Stewart,
who related a story about a first year student who came into
the biology department crying because she couldn't afford to
pay for the required first-year text They don't realize it's
going to cost $ 100 per course. That adds an extra $BOO to the
cost of one year here."
First-year student Kirsten Schwind echoed this sentiment. "I'd heard that textbooks were expensive, and yeah,
they were expensive!"
This issue has special importanceright now as students
arebeginning to think about the courses they want to take next
fall. One thing thatstudents must be considering is if they can
afford it.
Financial AidDirector Laura Talbot said that "financial
aid decisions for the current year were based on the assumption thatstudentsneeded to spend an average ofabout $lll.OO
on books for each course." She said thatsince the bookstore
calculated and students surveyed agreed that the average
figure was less than that, the College's "budget decisions for
the coming year were based on the assumption that an average
of $BB.OO per course will be sufficient" That figure will be
used for '93-'94 aid decisions, according to Talbot
Eighty-eight dollarsmay be enough to cover the average
cost ofbooks per course, but 70 courses last fallhad required
books that cost more than that
It is hoped that some of the new changes that thebookstore is adopting will aid in faculty awareness of this issue.
"I think sometimes faculty aren't thinking about cost
when they order books; they want to come up with the best
possible book 1i5t...1thinkit [cost] is something ofwhich they
should be aware when they're choosing," said Grace.

Grad Looks Back at
Swat from Oxford

by NIEN-HEHSIEH «92

After graduating from Swarthmore, I
didn't think that it would be possible to move
to an even smaller community for graduate
school. I was wrong.
NewCollege,Oxford has only 125graduates and 400 undergraduates. As small communities, Swarthmore and New College both
have the potential tc foster great degrees of
intimacy in personal relations, but this is not
always the case. Instead, because itis easy to
confuse constant interaction with communication, people and relationships are often
taken for granted. In turn, this lack of interpersonal communication can harm gender
relations.
We often separate our understanding of
gender dynamics from our personal behavior.
We may be able to discuss gender issues
without seeing the sexist and insensitive
wrongs we commit in our own relationships.
Since these patterns of individual behavior
reinforce society-wide gender relations, we
can begin to redress the social inequities of
sexism through changes in our personal relations. Communicationand dialogue are central to beginnning the process by which we
reform our own attitudes and patterns of be-

havior.

While a Swarthmore education empha-

sized effective speaking and writing, it taught
nie less about the other half of

dialogue—-

listening. To a certain extent, we must endeavor to make ourselves understood. In our
daily interactions, however, we also have a
responsibility to listen actively. Just as effective writing or speaking take time to learn, so
does effective listening. More importantly,

just as it takes courage to express oneself
honestly, it is not always easy to listen to what
people have to say.
TheSwarthmore community has started
to address issues ofgender dynamics. Education can help clarify the problems and the
failings in our own understanding, and as we
all learn at Swarthmore, our societal norms
and relations are far from ideal. They are
sexist,racist, homophobic, and something we
talk about less frequently, classist. In response, we often begin with new "progressive" language to combat these inequalities.
Yet while it may be easy change our
language, our individual attitudes and actions
arerootedmoredeeply withinourselves. From
the day we are bom, society teaches us the
roles, views and patterns ofbehavior that fit
our gender or our race. No matter how
"progressive" we claim to be, it is still hard to
break away from these learned patterns of
interaction, which concern issues that range
from child care to sexual assault
Nevertheless, gender relations can improve. Just as our current attitudes are learned
and reinforced by society, so can they be
unlearned. Nothing essential in our physical
selves makes us one way or another, gender
and race are socially constructed. A new
language might help reform attitudes, but this
is limited in its effect. Inrebuilding thesocial
constructs of gender relations, we must be
careful not just to change the surface or language,but to assess the actual foundations. In
this process, nothing can replace actual dialogue in our personal attitudes and relations.
The mediation process is one way to
foster dialogue in times of interpersonal conflict. In my experience, the very dependence

April 23,1993

A Call for Community
I was flipping through the CollegeBulletin the other night, looking for classes and the
like, and I ran across a section describing the
College as "the Swarthmore Community." I
had to stop and laugh a little bit at this statement, which to me, is theoxymoron above all
other oxymorons. IfI were going to describe
Swarthmore, the last thing that would come to
my mind would be community.
When I think of community, I thinkof a
place that has a definable identity, a place
where people support each other and take
pride in working to make the community a
better place. When I think of Swarthmore, I
think of a place that has no identity (only
diversity, the exact opposite), which sets its
residents in opposition to each other before
they even come to orientation. There is no
identity— outside of the individually diverse
multi-cultural groups— and definitely no
concern about creating a Swarthmore Community. Instead, each faction is concerned
with advancing their individual ideas and
getting their piece of the pie.
The champions of diversity will maintain here that this a good thing, and that
community identity really has no place at
Swarthmore. They will ask, "How can diversity be a bad thing?" The most obvious
answer is that it keeps us from realizing our
potential as a powerful and effective community, from recognizing our group strengths
and talents, and from ever accomplishing
anything meaningful as an organized group.
It is undeniablethat if a group of individuals,
as talented and diverse as can be found at
Swarthmore, actually put their relatively minor differences aside and work for common
goals, then there is very little that it could not
accomplish.
As long as difference is stressed over
common identity, however, Swarthmore will
never accomplish anything as a united community; and unless die school makes a real
effort (not just words, I'm talking actions
here) to change its sales pitch, then difference
is exactly what people will feel they have to
establish and maintain in order to fit into
Swarthmore's "multi-cultural Utopia".
As it stands now, the administration encourages the diversifying of the Swarthmore
campus. They claim that it strengthens the
"Swarthmore Community," when what it truly
does is dividethe College to thepoint that true
community is an impossibility. Meanwhile,
atomized and impotent groupsfight each other
overpetty issues, unaware of what they might
be capable of ifthey united themselves. And
while they are worrying about which group
gets what office-space, and whose week it is
to put the comment board up in Parrish and
feel oppressed, the administration continues
on its merry way, making decisions that we
ignorantly choose to have no part in. As we
are all fighting with each other on desks in
Cornell, in theOpinion pages ofThe Phoenix,
at meetings that shouldbe used to unite us—valuable opportunities to makereal and serious change are slipping between our fingers.
Now I'm not necessarily accusing the
administration of consciously trying to keep
the student-body uninvolved by dividing us,
but consciously or not, that is what they are
doing; even as early on as in the admissions
process. Just the other day I received some email, asking for Asian-American students to
host Asian-American specs. It was almost
hard for me to believe that the division was
encouraged so early. God forbid that someone visit Swarthmore and get the impression
that different groups actually interact and
—

upon honest communication makes mediation a more difficult process. When extreme
hurt and pain are involved, it can be an extremely difficult approach. In some cases, it
is even inappropriate. Yet, for many people,
it is in theveryprocess of dialogue that we can
see our own mistakes more clearly, since the
process requires active listening. In turn,
mediation encourages the examination and
modification of our personal relations. Despite thedifficulties involved, Swarthmore is
right to provide mediation as an option in
conflict resolution.
If we seek true equality in gender and
sexual relations, we mustreconstruct our roles,

with one another. If we let prospectives think
an encompassing sense of community identity was more important than whatever facet
of diversity got them accepted, then how
would we ever maintain segregatedseating at
Sharpies?
Even though the administration encourages division, thatdoes not mean that we have
to accept and live under these divisiveconditions. At times I have even seen glimpses of
student groups trying to break out ofthis trend
and unify themselves. A group that might be
able to take advantage of this most, are the
women on thiscampus. They are currently at
a crucial stage of organization; a stage where
they will either organize and realize thepower
of unity, or allow themselves to be further
atomized into powerless sub-groups. From
the sound of the findings of their organizational meeting which took place a few weeks
ago, they acknowledged that there were well
over 15 different and independent Women's
factions, none of which were organized under
the potentially unifying Women's Center.
Now, the women ofSwarthmore are reorganizing themselves, in hopes of becoming a
better organized coalition. If they grasp this
opportunity to become a community, then it
would be a great step to actually developing a
Swarthmore Community.
Another organization with potential is
the Inter-cultural Center, which, if handled
with the idea of creating a united community
from the various splintered groups, could
have very positive results. The IC does have
serious problems, however, in that it has limited itself to a small number of groups, all of
whichhavemaintaineddistinctidentities apart
from one another. An example of the distance
that the IC still has to travel is shown clearly
in the division created by the controversy
surrounding the recent AIDS rally.
Many claim that the ultimate shortcoming of community identity is that it breeds
intolerance and bias against weaker groups.
They cite that in celebrating diversity and
multi-culturalism, all groups are made to feel
welcome. I disagree, and I quote philosopher
Michael Sandel in my defense: ".. .intolerance flourishes most where forms oflife are
dislocated, roots unsettled, traditionsundone.
In our day, the totalitarianimpulse has sprung
less from the convictions of a confidently
situated selves than from the confusions of
atomized, dislocated,frustrated selves, at sea
in a world where common meanings have lost

theirforce."

No one can deny that intolerance and
bigotry are present at Swarthmore. This occurs not in spite of multi-culturalism, but
rather because ofit. When everyone is atomized and set against one another, they become
threatenedby the appearanceofa finite amount
of goods; they see everyone in opposition to
themselves; resentment arises and bigotry
and hatred occur.
We can unite ourselves. We must if we
are ever going to realize our full potential as
a community. This does not mean that every
person has to abandon their individuality.
The variety and difference of backgrounds
and talentsis whatmakes us such apotentially
powerful community, and to abandon these
would be to abandon our strongest asset. We
cannot allow ourselves, however, to be dividedany longer by thesedifferences. We can
be a strong community while stillkeeping our
individuality, but we must be willing to acknowledge the identity that links us all.

Matthew Schenk
attitudes and behavior. This process is not
easy, and must begin in our personal lives.
Individually, we can work to adopt the goals
of mediation—dialogue and understanding.
Few places rival Swarthmore in the intensity
and volumeof debate surrounding gender and
sexual dynamics. Yet sometimes, I wonder
how much listening I actually did at
Swarthmore. Without active listening, we
only interact without communicating. If we
don't communicate, we doUn't know how
our personal behavior prevents true equality
among us. At New College, I have the chance
to strive for more honest communication in
another small community.

Stupid, Whiny Headline for Lincoln's Last Damn Article

To the Editor:

Please don'ttakethis the wrong
way, you bastards:
I hate it when Swatties complain about how Swatties complain
too much. Lately I've heard a lot of
such complaints. But we all LOVE
complaining. Complaining is what
makes us who we are. Somehow
Dean Barr detected in all of us that
pathological need to complain. We
all BELONG here. We ALL are
ONE. Without complaining we are
nothing.
On the other hand, ifyou really
don't like something here, you have
three options: change it, do nothing,
or leave.
Some people do try to change
things, and are often moderately
successful, even if only in terms of
raising discussion to another level
(take some notes from Karama
Neal). So why don't you? Even if
it's the most quibbling thing, like
bands at the Old Club or food at
Sharpies? Why don't you change it
if you are so unhappy?
The truth is YOUDO. Nobody
does nothing. We all complain.
We've turned everything everywhich-way through complaining.
Look at what the turmoil of our
complaints has wrought over the
past four years. This campus is on
fire with complaints. This campus
is ALIVE.

So what about these 40 members of thefreshman class whohave
applied to transfer, who are actually
taking the option of leaving?
It's a BIG LIE, on theface ofit.
When have forty Swatties ever gotten up the gumption to actually
leave? Never. Why? Because then
they wouldn't be able to complain
about how they wanted to leave.
We bond over our hatred of
this place. We find our mates over
ourhatredofthis place. Those people
who don't hate this place feel awfully left out And then they hate
this place. And then they complain.
And then they make friends. And
then they stay here because THEY
LOVE IT. Anyway, I have it on
good authority that it's only about
15 freshmen who are actually leaving. Which is no more or less than

can't hack it here then go, run along,
go to Amherst or Williams. You'll
come running in a semester begging
to be takenback. Or you'll be really
happy which means you didn'tbelong here anyway.
So why are Read Schuchardt
and Ram Lee always complaining
about P.Cness? Were they expecting to find Liberty Baptist College?
No! They love to feel silenced. Look
at the way they dress. They want to
complain, and Swarthrnore gives
them the opportunity. They can exercise their persecution complexes

and their high horses like all the rest
of us. And I say LET THEM.
After all, are Read and Ram
really censored?No! Idon'tknowif
you've been reading The Phoenix
lately, but Readand Ram have been
able to write the most virulent conservative claptrap they could think
offor months. In this fine ragsheet.
Ram wrote an articlelast week comparing abortion to slavery. Was he
censored? No! Read wrote that longass pro-life article last year. Was he
censored? No (he was edited, because the article was too long and
boring—it took up a whole page, if
you remember)! Censorship?
Bullshit We all have an equal right
to complain here at Swarthmore.
WE LOVE IT.
So do I still think Swarthmore
is too P.C.? No! There is no P.C.
hegemony here at Swarthmore. Read
the walls of Parrish. Read the desks
of McCabe and Cornell. Read the
bathroom walls. ReadThe Phoenix.
An immeasurable number of discussions are going on all at once.
Usually someone complaining about
something. If Swarthmore was that
P.C. I wouldn'tbe able to complain
about it being too P.C.
And through that complaining
we learn so much. Even when it is
just somebody complaining about
the hyphen between Asian and
American in Asian-American.Even
if it's some ignorant adolescent neo-

Nazi homophobe. Often times we
just learn that we hate a particular
point of view or person. So what?
We've confronted our hatred and
redoubledit. But to do so we've had
to articulate it. We've had to think
aboutit Sometimes, justsometimes,
we've even changed our minds.
We've certainly raised our consciousness.
So what the hell is this carnival? Al Bloom, we don't want your
stinking carnival. We want more

really whiny books. We want some
whiny professor to have a bigger
salary to whine more. We want some
whiny student to have a grant to go

dissidents.WE WANT TO WHINE.
We don't want your fun, Al Bloom.
Your fun is wastedupon us. Unless
you do the Slip V Slide.
I love Swarthmore. I am so sad
to be leaving. I have learned so

THE PHOENIX OPINIONS APRIL 23,1993

COUNTERPOINTING the Anti-Abortion Issue
by LIGEIA JENNIS and KAR-YEE WU
Kar-yee— So, Ligeia, where do you
want to begin?

Ligeia I thought that maybe for this
last column we could actually show our true
opinions and debatetheother sideof an issue,
which was discussed last week in the Phoenix. So, really here we are doing theCounterpoint together to an already discussed Point.
The topic, and it keeps with both the sovereignty and sex issues, is abortion.
K— Sounds good. Before we begin,
we'd like to extend our compliments to the socalled enemy for creating an argument with
merit We don't agree with it, though, and
here is why. First, the pro-choice movement
is about choice, the choice to have a SAFE
and AVAILABLE (and implicitlylegal) abortionforany woman, not justthe wealthy. The
wealthy will always have the choice to have a
safe abortion (money talks), but the less
advantaged won't. There is a reason for all
the buttons and bumper-stickers that refer to
coat hangers and back-alley butchers.
L— Exactly. There is one and only one
viable argument for the anti-abortionists:
abortionis murder. This, it seems to me, is the
entire crux of the matter. If you, as a citizen
of the world, believe that abortion is the
willful and unnecessary ending of an innocent life (a handy definitionfor murder) then
all of the talk of choice or wire hangers is
meaningless.
K—Agreed. As for the pro-life move—

This Headline Written in English-Only
by MATTHEW RAM LEE
During the formative years of
this country those who were creating the new union chose a language
to create new documents in, that
language was English (German was
seriously considered). Today, the
debate concerning what language
government documents will be produced continues in the form of English-Onlylaws.English-Only bills
typically stipulate mat all government documents are to be produced
in English and that a student's primary teaching is to be done in English.
These initiatives (and its supporters) oftenbecome targets ofracism and isolationism charges. English-Only laws have reasons not
seated in racism, not couched in
isolationism.Reasons, infact, which
promote the successful integration
of immigrants. In order to succeed
economically in our society, a workingknowledge ofEnglish isrequired
(not recommended). I fail to think
ofone prominent/successful American citizen who could not claim a
knowledge of English. It is imperative that all Americans know English. As long as Americans are
without a solid grasp of the primary
medium of communication in this
country today (English), they will

continue to identify themselves as
"non-members" and as such will
continue to fail economically. This
situationis ofserious concern. Multiple national languages intensify
community conflict, encourages
separatism and leads to division.
Communication is integral to harmonious relations and a common

intelligible exchange and sharing. It
is from this true and valid concern
thatEnglish-Only initiatives spring.
If the government operated
solely in English (and as such offered English classes through INS,
then all Americans would beforced
to learn English. Learning English
is beneficial and necessary. Printing documents in other languages
makes it easier for citizens to not
learn English and is unfeasible given
the huge diversity of languages in
America. It is an economic impossibility to print in all languages.

the clear choice.

Sunset in the Crum
by ETHAN S. BORG
The sun was an orange fog
descending withoutstretchedarms,

yawning. The trees already towered above it, branches wrapped
about themselves like some unknown alphabet, the phrase repeating: "I am taller than the sun tonight; can't you see me?" The
breeze was soft, warm, wrapped
in growing shadows. And I sat
there, entranced, meditating,
alive. Alive!
The anger on thiscampus could
not, could not reach me; nor the
sorrow. No laws of logic came to
mind, no readings, papers, quizzes,

nothing, but a sense that this could
happen every day, to anyone who
watched the sunset
And then I was caught by a
fantasy ofsitting on Parrish Beach,
in a white chair, surrounded by
friends, strangers, a professor, and
the buzz of wild insects. We were
chatting about something irrelevant, and we were loving it, all of
us, withoutpresumption. There was
no sense what we were going to say
next, only a calm, a calm around,
within, throughout us all, that we
were alive, and that was all that
mattered.
Itis spring time, everything is
true by nature that can be done.

"I Have Held My
Breath Long Enough"
To the Editors:

I was deeply offended by the
"Dread ChurchCreamster's"article
in the April 1 edition ofthe Phascist
entitled "Boom Announces Equal
Treatment for Vitally Challenged
Partners". Wake up, Swarthmore!
Is there no one out there whohas the
courage to challenge such a twisted,
hate-filled, bigoted presentation of
one of the most serious issues facing the College community? In this
age of enlightenment there is no
room for such a blatant attack on
already marginalized and alienated
alternately-sexually-oriented
people.
I am talking, of course, of those
of us at Swarthmore who are
icthyophiles. The Creamster mentions only one small subclass of the
animal kingdom in his twisted and
ignorant presentation of bestiality
that is, grazing animals. What about
fish? cats? birds? insects? small rodents? road kill? Such marginalization of sexualities oriented
towards these groups cannot and
should not be tolerated. I, for one,

ner-cityyouth that learning English
(or learning in English) is not beneficial and is, in fact, stifling to their
cultural identity disturbs me and
reeks of ivory tower mentality. How
can a group that not only has a
superb grasp of the English language and has succeeded in a English-Only environmentkeep other,
less advantaged in thedark as to this
secret ofsuccess and infact discourage it?
English-only supporters are
often blasted for proposing that the
primary educationof studentsshould
be in English. "What if a student
learns the best in Hungarian?" and
"We want what is best for the student, don't you?" are often the
charges. I want what is best for the

student: to be able to not only communicate effectively in English but
hold the capacity to learn in English.
One of the primary responsibilities of secondary education is to
teachkids how to learn not just what
to learn. When students enter American society they will be asked/required to learn in English. Almost
all jobs in America require English. There is a directrelation between the higherpaying jobs(with
greater prestige) and the level of
mastery of the English language
required.
Our schools must teachkids to
learn effectively in English. The
government must forcibly encourage its members to learn English.

of this land. English-Only laws are
one step, towards more economic
opportunity and personal agency.

Prof Supports
More Student/

Faculty
Interaction
Dear Editors:

I appreciated Ethan Borg's letter in the April 16 Opinions section

expressing a desirefor a more positive interactionbetween faculty and
students. At the risk of trivializing,
one institution that might help this
happen in a small way is the"take a
prof to lunch" program. The times
I've been invited have been casual
and fun, and I think they'vehelped
me respond to students in a more
natural way than in the classrooms
ofoffices. My impression from talking to faculty is that many of than
would welcome thechance to share
a lunch hour with students. And it's
free, which on these salaries ain't
halfbad.
It's nota solutionby any means,
but it's a useful resource, and one
that is underutilized, as far as I can
see. Maybe we could even take the
onus off students by instituting a
"take a student to lunch" version.

Breitenberg's Personal Commitment Should be Rewarded with Tenure
An OpenLetter to Swarthmore College:
I am writing in response to Swarthmore
College's recent decision to deny tenure to
Professor Mark Breitenberg. As an alumna of
Swarthmore and a former student of Mark's,
I feel particularly strong about the implications of this decision.
As I understand it, the College has informed Mark that a "significant minority" of
studentshavefelt uncomfortableandexcluded
in his classes. In other words, they claimthat
it is his responsibility as a teacher to make the
studentsfeel comfortable and welcome in the
classroom. In my opinion, this represents one
ofthe deepestproblems that Swarthmore will
have to address if it is to achieve its professed
educational goals.
To use a well worn paradigm of the
"self'and the"other" (a concept which, ironically, Mark has made the focus ofhis introductoryEnglish class), Swarthmore has traditionally maintained and perpetuated a vision
of itself, a student body predominantly white
and middle class. Students enter our classroom and expect to find themselves mirrored
in the faces ofother students, professors, and
the material being taught. This material often
represents the cultural achievements and contributions of subjects unlike themselves, but
thestudents realize that they are doing good
and valuable intellectual work when they
study it. They leave the classroom with a
stronger sense of themselves and their own
benevolent intentions. Students who do not
see themselves, theirhistories, and their communities reflected in the experience in the
classroom feel profound discomfort and are
oftenunable to continue successfully, a reality to which the highest attritionrate of African American students can attest.
The new administration has repeatedly
proclaimed its agenda of bringing Swarthmore
into the Twenty-first Century by embracing a
new multi-cultural agenda of diversity. At
this formational stage it is critical that
Swarthmore truly understand what this undertaking requires. It is not enough to simply
"celebratediversity"by importing token"others" for the enjoyment and consumption of
the Swarthmore community. While it is certainly important to includemulti-cultural and
feminist issues in thecurriculum and to stress
diversity inrepresentation in thestudent body
and faculty, the College must continuously
investigate the services which this diversity is
being made to perform. Diversity is not a
multi-cultural buffet which students can
sample and enjoy, leaving the table satisfied
and nourished and with a stronger sense of
theircultural self-worth. Such an attitude has
nothing to do with change, only with the
maintenanceof a central "self' at theexpense
of"other" experiences and selves.

To truly shake the center requires some
discomfort and some hunger. We much teach
students to takeresponsibility for their education, forthe disorientationand alienationwhich
inevitably occurs when notions of a stableself
are disturbed in order to make room for other
experiences. Only then can students begin to
understand the discomfort and the hunger
which accompanies the joyousand celebratory
representations of other cultures and which
lies beneath and supports all of our privilege.
As one of a handful of Asian American students at Swarthmore at the time, as a woman,
I have very few memories of feeling "comfortable" in classrooms in college. I have
strong memories of excitement, of agitation,
of anger, of frustration and of dazzling insight. It never occurred to me that it was my
right to feel "comfort" or "inclusion," and as
a result, I feel that all the knowledge that has
remained with me was earned through my
own labor and has been truly deserved.
This is the greatest debt that I owe to
Mark, and it returns me somewhat circuitously to the issue of the issue of his tenure
decision. Mark has always refused to allow
his students to maintain their comfortable
sense of intellectual privilege. For many students this sense ofprivilege means a refusal to
consider what other subjectivities and experiences theirpersonal—gendered, racial, sexual
and class —identity rests upon and excludes.
For others it is simply the assumption that,
having been at the top of their class in high
school and being equipped with a fluency
with the English language, they can naturally
excel in an English classroom without hard
work and struggle.
Mark's commitment to issues of diversity include, but go far beyond, his comprehensive integration of themesof gender, race,
ethnicity, class and sexuality intohis syllabi.
It is exemplified by, but far surpasses, the
inestimable contributions he has made to the
College in lesbian and gay studies and other
academic and community service. Markfeels
strongly and personally about the material he

teaches, and he demands no less from his
students. As an undergraduate who was just
beginning to understand the power that language and critical theory could have in helping me to reconcile and express the personal
and political issues I was wresting with, I
found Mark's seminars to be a revelation. To
thestudentswhoreally benefited from Mark's
pedagogy his classes made us aware that it
was not only acceptable to be personally
involved in one's academic work, but that it
was through this intellectual labor that we
could transform our inchoate personal emotions and experiences into an articulate political frame.
Ironically, Mark's foregrounding issues
of pedagogy and authority in the classroom,

Intellectual Pursuits at Swat
May Be Uncomfortable
Dear President Bloom:

I was distressed to learn today that
Swarthmore had denied Mark Breitenberg
tenure in the English department.As an alumnus I am writing to explain my disappointment with this decision.
Apparently, a few students commented

in their letters ofrecommendation that Mark
had made them feel "uncomfortable" in the
classroom. I surprise myself in writing this
letter, because during Mark's first year at
Swarthmore—when I was a senior—l distrusted what I knew of Mark's pedagogical
style as well, a style that attempts to make
students feel implicated in ideas and debates
that all too often appear to neatly begin and
end with each class period. Since 1988, however, I have begun to teach myself, and have
realized that any material worth imparting
entails risks, danger and compromises for
both student and teacher—that ideas, ifthey
are taken seriously, might provoke periods of
personal discomfort or vulnerability. If intellectual pursuits are to be something otherthan

a hobby, students must weft together the
personal and intellectual, even if they forge
this relation at the expense of pride, comfort,
or desires for invulnerability and unconditionalaffirmation in theclassroom. In short, I
do not believe how "making" students uncomfortable—apparently a complaint in some
of Mark's letters—is synonymous with making students victims or outcasts.

Tenure decisions matter to alumni because they speak to the College's underlying
goals and philosophies. I have always boasted
that Swarthmore produces "intellectuals"—
invested and thoughtful students rather than
merely clever or skilled ones. To that end,
Swarthmore shouldstrive to produce students
who have learned to tolerate intellectual discomfort for knowledge, rather than students
who sacrifice knowledge for comfort.
Thanks very much for your time.

The King Verdicts II: Continuing the L.A. Cosmetic Tradition
by CLIFFORDSUK

JAE LEE

Just a few days ago, when the two guilty and
the two not-guilty verdicts for the Rodney King
civil rights trial were announced, people all over
Los Angeles breathed sighs ofrelief. One person at
her church cried out that justice was finally served.
Another assured himself and others that the mixed
verdicts were "all right" Still another commented
that there were going to be barbecues all over his
neighborhood that night And although many still
took either the not-guilty or the guilty verdicts as a
slap in the face, practically all agreed that a major
cloud that was hanging over Los Angeles was
finally lifted. People could go on with their lives
again. Life goes on.
How appropriate a phrase for Los Angeles.
As usual, life goes on. No matter what happens, life
goes on. Butis the situation really changed? Is there
really a reason to celebrate? Despite the extreme
importance placed upon the outcome ofthe Rodney
King civil rights trial, are things really "better," is
justice really served, now that the verdicts have
come out? Or was delivering these particular final
verdicts merely an attempt to normalize things, to
recapture thereins over the cosmetic appearanceof
Los Angeles, control of which was lost especially
during last April?
When I and eleven other people visited Los
Angeles about a month ago, under the supposedly

esteemed name of the "Tri-College Peace Studies
Mission," we learned something about the city that
seems to be unique in itself. We were told that the
poverty in Los Angeles is cosmetically different
from the poverty in a city like New York or Chicago. Buildings, for instance, are not "allowed" or
have not had time to decay as they are or have in
these older cities. L.A. homes are generally more
expensive than the homes in other areas. For the
most part, the cosmetic appearance ofLos Angeles
is carefully maintained. This maintenance of the
LA. exterior is very deceiving, for although the
grass may be cut often, die broken fence mended
quickly, and the house with peeling paint scraped
and re-painted immediately, the problems underlying these symptoms of outwardly showing "blight"
are not sufficiently addressed, if addressed at all.
Instead, a very ritzy, appealing, attractive-looking
Band-Aid is applied to these continually festering
problems, which eventually erupt as they did last
April.
The attitudes surrounding the trial and its
final outcome, especially by the media, seem to
follow this L.A. cosmetic tradition. The mainstream media placed so much importance and
attention on the trial itself (as well as the original
state trial) that nothing else happening in Los
Angeles seem(ed)(s) to matter. It was as if the
whole future of Los Angeles hinged solely upon
the verdicts. The media conveniently did not pay

attention to the efforts of community-basedorganizations and individuals attempting to change Los
Angeles fundamentally for the better. [ln addition,
these organizations and individuals were and are
indeed trying to change people's attitudes about the
trial, that it is not an end-all thing for Los Angeles,
as the mainstream media has tried to portray it]
Instead, the media cosmetically simplified the L.A.
situation as merely a choice of guilty or not guilty
and die repercussions of that choice. By not giving
the full, deep picture of the situation at hand, the
media in effect solidified the loose relationship
between Los Angeles and the trial in the L.A.
public's eye. So, yes, to a certain extent the fate of
Los Angeles was dependent on the Rodney King
verdicts, but only after the media continued and
perpetuated the cosmetic misrepresentation ofLos

Angeles.
What the media—and many public officials,
for that matter—still fail to recognize (although it
may claim not to) is that the original Rodney King
verdicts were MERELY the trigger of the ensuing
events, not the underlying cause. This cosmetic
simplification of the situation, whether or not the
media caused it could conceivably have affected
the jurors' decisions. Even though the verdicts can
supposedly be justified, the extreme diplomacy the
jurors either consciously or unconsciously exhibited with their two-and-two vote cannot be denied
or overlooked. Perhaps the jurors thought that with

these diplomatic decisions (easily made due to the
individual position of each defendant—Koon was
the senior officer and therefore in charge
<GUILTY>, Powell gave the most blows and
joked about it <GUILTY>, Brisefio actually tried
to restrain one of the officers and cooperated with
the prosecution <NOT GUILTY>, Wind was not
too involved in the beating according to the videotape <NOT GUILTY>), Los Angeles, whether or
not it believed in the guilt of the police officers,
could now rest at ease. Or maybe, the jury really
believed that they handed out verdicts as just as
they could get Who really knows what went on in
their minds?
Whatever the motives behind the jurors' decisions, despite the end of the Rodney King civil
rights trial, the tension is far from over. The "L.A.
4+," those involved in the Reginald Denny beating,
still await their trial, deftly postponed by the judge
so as not to coincide with the Rodney King trial.
Most assuredly, the Los Angeles scene will again
undergo cosmetic surgery, designed to distract
Angelenos from the long-standing, everyday concrete problems. The people of Los Angeles will
have to face yet another period of tense and suspenseful waiting. YET AGAIN, the fate of Los
Angeles will be in the hands of twelve jurors.
As a friend of mine commented herself, "It
sucks that people's lives depend upon a single
trial."

MIKE ROTHBART, '94

One of the hardest things for me about
being a survivor is that it's apermanent state.
It won't goaway, and it royally frustrates me.
I feel like I will deal with it, nicely, and
calmly, and I will feel like I have everything
under control. Then, allof a sudden, thereit is;
right there in my face again. I have to deal
with being a survivor, and sometimes I just
get so angry!
I really do not feel like this is a community where it is OK to have problems. I have
felt like only so much time is allottedfor me
to deal with this problem. The attitude that I
have felt is, "Gee, you're a survivor. That's
too bad.Solve the problem and get on with it."
I am not sure what makes me feel this way (I
assure you it's not the deans. They have all
been very supportive of me. Thank you, all),
but this feeling is really detrimental to my
healing. Itmakes me feel like I am wrong for
myreactions to sexualassault. I did not choose
to react to my abuses in any particular way,
and I do not choose to have this issue come up
at such inopportune moments as the classroom, The Old Club, in bed with a significant
other, at Sharpies, walking around in the
Ville. And when it comes up, sometimes it's
overwhelming. I can't concentrate on my
schoolwork, I can't pay attention in class, I
feel like I can't be there for some classroom
discussions, and sometimes it gets so scary
that I can't even feel safe leaving my room.
You know, I don't choose to react this way,
and I can't help it that it keeps coming up in
my life. For those of you out there who feel
impatient with the healing process of someone you love, trust me, they probably feel just
as angry about having to deal with it as you do.
On a calmer note, it has been nice to see
the campus rallying around in support of this
issue that is so important to me. All of the
people whomade signs, who cut ribbons, who
wore ribbons, who wrote on the poster boards
in support of us, who helped with planning,
who came to our events, who contributed in
any way, I just want to say thankyou. Itmakes
me feel good to know that there are others
who are as concerned about this issue as I am.
So, that's it. Many students on this campus who did not previously know that I am a
survivor now know. Please don't look at me
differently. I am still the same person I was
before you knew, and I don't need any more
or less from you now. I can't believe I actually
did this, and signed my name. It took more
strength than I can explain.
SUZANNAH COLE '94

We Must All Speak Out and Break the Silence
To the Swarthmore College community,

I am writing this letter to try to break the
silence, the silence surrounding the issue of
Sexual Assault/Abuse. Many people seem to
believe that this does not happen very often,
or at least not to people they know. They are
wrong. There are many survivors among us,
and I am one of them.
There are many repercussions from such
an abuse. Some are common knowledge, others are not I can only speak in my name and
about the ones that influence most my life.
Silence of guilt. I never talkedpublicly
about this issue before, because it seemed that
I should feel guilty or ashamed of what happened to me. I am not guilty. If you haven't
heard ofmany people going through sexual
abuse, itis not because there aren't any around

you, it is because many decide to remain
silent. Silence and denial do not help to heal
the scars, but thereis such a stigma ofguilt and
responsibility in acknowledging being a victimofsexual assault. The myth that the victim
askedfor it is still very alive. I did not ask for
it I did not have a choice.
The feeling ofresponsibility and guilt is
not just voiced by other people, but internalized through social construct. This is what
was so unsettling for me. It took me two and
a half years to piece together what exactly
happened. Two and a halfyears to accept that
I am not guilty.
Recurring consequences. Many people
seem to believe that this issue of sexual assault/abuse as a very finite event in time. It
happened once, maybe twice and then you
deal with it... Being a survivor is not a tempo-

rary state. "Dealing with it" is not something
that requires only going to psych servicesfor
a month or two. The consequences of the
assault/abuse are long-term, even lifelong.
They infiltrate most aspects ofmy life.Lack
of self-esteem, irrational fears, overreacting
at particular situations, feeling as if I sometimes lose control of my life, my emotions.
Day to day experiences gain a new dimension over which I have no control, and it
scares me. Memories, fears, will comes back
at unwanted times. Getting intimate with
men scares me. If my boyfriend did this to
me, how can I be sure no one else will? Can
I trust you?
I wish that people would be aware of
what it really entails to be a survivor: the
struggle to regain control of my life; the
frustration of having the issue come back

again, and again, and again; the anger at
having a past experience have such power
over my life; the pain... I wish I did not have
to turn only to other survivorsfor understanding. I wish that there wasn't this big silence
around theissue and itsconsequences. People
need to hear about what it is to be a
survivor. They need to be aware that it is
not just someone that went through
sexual assault/abuse; it is a person dealing with the consequences of such an
action day after day.
I am not looking for pity and compassion.Ipride myselfin being a survivorand not
a victim. I am just trying to help break the
silence, hoping that it will make some people
aware of our existence as survivors.

THE PHOENIX OPINIONS APRIL 23,1993

JCS Criticism Ignores Important Facts
Dear Editors,
I am writing in response to Rebecca
France's letter which appeared in The Phoenix on 12 April 1993.While I supportFrance's
criticism of Jesus Christ Superstar, I am
disturbed by several aspects ofher letter.
I agree with most of what France is
saying. In my opinion, the writers of Jesus
Christ Superstar consciously or unconsciously convey anti-Semitic messages in the
play, most obviously in their decision to portray the JewishCaiaphasand Annas as masked,
subhumanvillainsinstead oftheRoman Pilate
and Herod. Also, I agree that the Swarthmore
production displayed insensitivity towards
Jews in depicting leavened bread at a Passover feast (theLast Supper). I agree that antiSemitism causes suffering throughout
S warthmoreand therest of the world. And I
too find that JCS expresses sexistattitudes.As
1understand it, France's letter is not so much
a critique of the play as a narrative detailing
her reaction to the play as a Jew, as a woman,
as a lesbian, and as the individual she is.
Although I respect this form of expression, I
feel that a more objective analysis of the play
needs to enter the discussion; and as such, I
would like to comment on several of the
issues France brought up in her letter.
To begin with, I see France's interpretation of the use of masks in Jesus Christ
Superstar as incomplete. France flatly states
thatthe Jews are "designatedby theirmasks,"
neglecting to acknowledge that the Roman
soldiers also wear masks. It may be argued
that the Roman soldiers' wearing masks is
superfluous to the greater anti-Semitic effect
of the dramatic construction. Still, for many
audiences the Roman soldiers' masks negate
the anti-Semitic effect. I have yet to be absolutely convinced that the use of the masks is
anti-Semitic, except in the use of masks to
designate Caiaphas and Annas as the show's
villains. If France had not sidestepped the
issueof theRoman soldiers' masks, she might
have produced a more convincing indictment
of the anti-Semitism in the construction.
As the product of a Protestant Christian
upbringing, I strongly disagree with France's
blanket statements about Christianity. While
the Catholic Church has historically complied withand encouraged Jew persecution, it
cannot be reduced to "the original European
Jew-killing machine."Like practically every
other organized religion in the world, the
Catholic Churchhas used its dogma to justify
killing off its "enemies." While one cannot
deny the Catholic Church's deeply antiSemitic roots, it is equally impossible to back
up the hyperbolic claim that the Church is a

"machine"whose sole or primary function is
to kill Jews. France also speculates, "Where
would Christianity be if Jesus had lived to a
ripe old age and died in a retirement home?",
writing off Christianity as relying on one
person's death for itsexistence. Although the
story of"the suffering and death of Christ is
central to Christian thought, that fact in no
way negates the value of Christian thought.
Finally, France's dismissal of "this stupid
story" of Christ's martyrdom as "a rationale
to systematically isolate and annihilate Jews"
is ill-considered and hollowly provocative.
France herself acknowledges that the story
"has been used" to justify persecution of
Jews. She doesn't say that the story is inherently anti-Semitic because it isn't. Nowhere
in theNew Testament does Christ encourage
his followers to take revenge on the Jews for
his crucifixion, and the Gospels present the
Roman Judean government as equally responsible for Christ's death if not more so. As
France asserts, crucifixion was a typically
Roman form of execution, and the wordslesu
Nazareth Rex ludaeorum (Jesus ofNazareth,
King ofthe Jews) which appeared on the cross
are Latin, not Hebrew or Aramaic. In any
case, France's attempts to bash Christianity
are insensitive and ill-founded.
Before closing, I want to respond to
France's criticism oftheconstructions ofsexuality in JCS. I agree that the focus on the
sexuality of the women characters, especially
MaryMagdalene, was unnecessary and oversimplified them. Nonetheless, I findFrance's
accusations of heterocentrism questionable.
While King Herod, played at Swarthmore by
a woman, does aggressively come on to Jesus
during her song, it is important torealize that
the song was originally intended for a male
Herod. Suggestions of male homoeroticism
appear throughout the play, from Judas kissing Jesus and singing "I Don't Know How to
Love Him" to Pilate stroking Jesus's bare
chest as he lies unconscious. My point is not

whether or not Jesus Christ Superstar focuses too much on heterosexual dynamics,
but rather that such a focus does not necessarily devalue it as a work of art. Myself a
lesbian, I was not offended by the heterosexual eroticism (or the maie homosexual
eroticism) in JCS. While I respect France's
right to be offended, I consider it a terrible
loss not to be able to appreciate a work of art
simply because the wrong genders are having
sex. Ifmy heterosexualfriends canreadFannie
Flagg 's Fried GreenTomatoes at the Whistle
Stop Cafe" and love it, why can't I love Jesus
Christ Superstar?
I appreciate France's letter as an obvi-

Rally Organizers Admit
Racism in IC Implication
To the Intercultural Center:
We would like to apologize for including the Intercultural Center as an organization, as if it had supported and helped organize last week's rally against homophobia
and AlDSphobia. In truth the Intercultural
Center as a group had little, ifanything todo
with the rally. LSethßrenzel, as a member
ofLBGA and a constituentof the IC, chose
to use the IC label as a means to make the
coalition of supporting groups seem larger
than it actually was. In effect it was an
ingenume attempt to make the predominantly white group seem to have the
participation and support of communities ofcolor in the IC, SAO andHOLA.
This act was a racist misappropriation.
I, Petra Janopaui, who is not a part of
any IC groups, mistakenly deferred to the
assumed authority of IC members. It was
wrong forboth of us to not actively question
the assumptions from which we were working. Furthermore, we failed to communicate to all of the IC about what was happening so that anyone interested could have
come together to build a truly broad-based
group.This lack ofcommunicationwas fos-

about Christianity, and I question her

treatment of sexuality. More importantly,

To the Editor:
I went to Jesus Christ Superstar expecting it to be anti-Jewish. (The same way I go see
Cinderella knowing it will be sexist. Disney movies tend to be sexist, passion plays tend to be
anti-Jewish. I can still enjoy them.) Actually, the play itselfis far less anti-Jewish than I had
anticipated. Caiaphas, Annas, and especially Judas were presented, in the script, almost
sympathetically. They may have been wrong, but they had a point. I was shocked, however,
by the costuming, which was Swarthmore students' decision and was explicitly anti-Jewish.
Rebecca France has made most of the points— in relation to themasks used to portray certain
characters— that I was going to, so instead of repeating her, I will just add one more.
I have heardvarious interpretations of the masks, all of them well-intentioned. There is,
however, one crucial scene in which the equation between Jews and devils is made explicitly.
The devils that drag Judas into Hell are wearing the same masks as the Jews. They may even
be two of the Jews. Is there any way to avoid theconclusion that the Jews are devils, the Jews
are evil? I don'tknow if this equation was intentional. I assume it wasn't But please, before
you stage a play, film a movie, write abook, whatever, take into account how things can be seen.
Such thoughtlessness only increases the hatred that too many people have for one another.

Council would like to make clear that we made efforts to schedule events so that all students
could attend as many as possible. To achieve this goal, we scheduled events for Saturday
afternoon, Saturday evening, and Sunday afternoon. The main activity on which we spent the
bulk of the money, the bands, are scheduled for Saturday evening. This is a time slot that we
feel is most conducive to the attendance of the majority of Swarthmore students.

THE PHOENIX OPINIONS APRIL 23,1993

Diary of Swarthmore Socialist Found
by ANDREW ELMORE
In a dramatic breakthrough in historical
research of the Socialist Movement in
Swarthmore, the following are diary entries
of Franz Herrghppen, notorious leader of
the Student Solidarity Movement in late
1960's, recounting hismeteoric rise to power.
It should be noted that Herrghppen had illusions ofgrandeur and a bizarre addiction to
nylon cord, both of which are obvious upon
examination ofthe text.
April 11: The blaring fire alarm echoed
across the entire campus, sending some into
muscle spasms and others into self-absorbed
muttering ofnoise pollution.
Baroooooga! Baroooga! Baroooooooga!
Like the calling of great leaders to their
posts, the alarm instilled in me a desire to do
something, to "make a difference," to quote
my high school guidance counselor's resignation papers.
Which was strange, considering that I
never wanted to be a volunteerfireman.
Feeling the cold chillof desire in frontof
me, I ran as though I myself were on fire,
carriedonward by thesilent hand offate. Out
of the comer of my eye I could see students
who I knew and respected looking on at me
with admiration, reassessing me because I
was brave enough to be a volunteer. Suckers.
Before I got to the fire station, I ducked
in a corner, coursing with adrenaline, for I
knew that this wouldlead on to greater things,
that this one moment would be a decisive
turning point in my life.
Looking for the times and dates of the
meetings of every organization and committee meeting, I meticulously recorded them on
my calendar, and brooded.
April 12: I am transformed. I sat in on
a meeting that was either the Committee on
Mediation to the Student's Housing

Committee's Advisory Committee, or theStudent Action Meeting Against the Student's
Housing Committee's Advisory Committee.
Or both. I don't think they even knew.
After several grueling minutes of avoiding eye contact I asked sheepishly "Um, excuse me, is this the Ethical Treatment of
Ringworms meeting?" I nonchalantly exited,
just in timefor the Friends Coalition Against
Lip Balm Addiction.
April 13: Organization after organization have taken notice of the fact that I am
everywhere. An all-powerful extra-cirricular
force to be reckoned with. People nod at me
in hallways in hopes that I will fund their
party or give them good housing for the next
semester. The naive fools!
My spare time is spent in the library,
making intellectual conversation sprinkled
with wittyquips abouthow much work I have
(even though by this time I have withdrawn
from all my classes.) Asked to give a review
for a movie, I noted that it was Kafkaesque,
which was profound because it starred JeanClaude Van Damme.
April 14: 1 got a phone call from a girl
named Katrishka, who claimed to represent
the vanguard of the proletariat. Not quite sure
what this meant, I asked to meet with her.
An hourlater I am surroundedby a group
of Swatties, calling themselves the
"Swarthmore Council on Student Solidarity." I listened to Katrishka's attack on
Swarthmore'sinstitutionalizedoppression and
realized thatthisis whatI've neededall along.
At present their revolution is clandestine,
reduced to sending subversive E-mail messages and stealing cereal containers from the
cafeteria. They need me as a martyr willing to
wage war against the bourgeois to free the
masses and reduce their tuition. I feel obligated to spread revolution to pay for my
newly-found prestige.

Partier Questions Sercurity's Motives
To the Editor:
It is possible that in writing this I am
Overreacting to the break up of the Old Club
party last Friday because I have been away
from Swarthmore for several months. But if
so, my objectivity may be useful in indicating
a serious problem. Anyway, this ismy take on
the incident.
Clearly, Campus Security had the right
(and obligation) to end the party. Despite
attempts, no party permit couldbe found, thus
making the party in violationofschool policy.
(If the question of the missing permit has
sincebeen resolved, thefact still remains that
the hosts were unable to produce it for the
security officers.) This, however, is not the
issue. The issue is the manner in which most
ofthe security officers went about closing the
party.
For the most part, I feel that security's
actions were inappropriate. Most of them
clearly came into the situation with a fortress
mentality. Party go-ers,particularly the band,
were actually quite willing to cooperate, so
long as they say their good intentionsreciprocated by the security officers. This did not
happen. Rather, they acted with a very confrontational stance, hence, (surprise, surprise)
leading to confrontations.
For example, early in the incident, on
officer shined his flashlight at a bandmember
and told him to turn off themusic. The band
membersaidhe would, but also asked thatthe
officer stop shining the light in his face. The
officer took this as an affront to his authority
and told the band member to stop talking
back. Using the light to signal theband was
completely appropriate, but the request to
turn the light off was also appropriate and
done in a spirit ofcooperation. But theofficer
was acting in a spirit of hostility.
The other problem was that the officers
had their own lines crossed and theirconfrontationalattitude prohibited quick, safe resolution to this problem. Towards theend of the
incident, the same officer as above got up on
the stage and shouted at the audience, "Get
out!" Again, this illustrated that the officer
was not seeking to promote public safety, but
rather reinforce his own authority. But I
digress. On this cue, a friend and I headed

towards the door to leave. The officer that
was at the door asked what we were doing and
indicated that we could not leave. But when
my friend honestly asked, "Which is it?"
(leave or stay), the officer retorted, "You
mouthing off or something?" Again, a consistent fortress mentality on the officer's part.
True, communication between the officers in
Old Club must not have been easy. But the
entirepurpose of thembeing there was to end
the party, meaning that the guests must leave.
We were trying to cooperate. But theofficers
were looking for submission, not cooperation.
There was a hopeful exception to all this.
One officer, whose name I believe is Sam,
acted in an appropriate and useful manner
throughout the incident He went up onto the
stage to address the audience directly and in a
manner that did not express a hostility towards the audience. He understood that the
audience would naturally not be pleased with
theshut down, but that if the act was donewith
good intent, the audience would reciprocate:
hostility would only return more hostility.
I'm not saying thatcampussecurity should
become a warm and fuzzy institution. But
there clearly is a need for a better attitude on
their part in dealing withsuch circumstances.
I am scared by thefact that danger of a more
serious incident was created by their behavior. Though I am certainly not an expert in
such things, I dowonder if the issue is one of
inadequate training. The New York City
Public Schools has just issued a report on
security and violence in the schools. Their
principle recommendation was for the school
security officers to undergo the same community based policing training that regular police officers do. Swarthmore College would
dowell to consider if that wouldbe appropriate for its security.
I would also like to put in a pitch for the
Swarthmore College Aikido Club. Studying
Aikido, aside from the obvious physical benefits, would give thepubic safety officers the
proper mind-set for dealing with, and resolving, conflicts.
Sincerely,
DAN MEYER '94

April 15: The Revolution started today.
After a subversive rouse students and faculty
congregated on Parrish lawn, convinced that
Bill Clinton was going to appear. I took the
stage with the conviction of an evangelist on
his third mortgage.
"Brothers and sisters, listen to me! We
are at the head of a conspiracy! A conspiracy
by the institution to crush us into fertilizerfor
their meat factory of middle-management
bureaucrats! I reject this! I say, to hell with
theirfertilizer!"
The students were still confused. Hecklers screamed "Suck it up!" and "Sucks to be
you!" Little did they realize that I was just
getting warmed up.
"Do you think it's a coincidence that
everyone is too stressed to question whether
academics should dominate theirlives? That
there is no student union and the student
lounge consists of two sofas and a table? Do
you really think that we get screwed over with
themeal plan by coincidence? That the bookstore marks up its prices by mistake? That
students are screwed over justto the point that
they complain about it but don't actually do
anything about it, so they are just ignored as
being spoiled brats, all by chance? No way!"
I had these mindless followers eating out
of the palm ofmy hand, but I needed something tangible they could appreciate.
"Do you, the student body, really think
that all thegranola andyogurt is in the back of
the salad bar where no one can reach it, by
coincidence? No!"
"WHEN WILL WE RIOT!? WHEN
WILL WE RIOT!?" the proletariat chanted,
carrying me on their shoulders and throwing
me up in the air.
"Tomorrow!" I yelled, exuding revolutionary zeal from my very pores.
Students turned their faces dejectedly,
prodding the ground with Berkenstocks.
"Can'tmake it. Lab."
"Oh. The day after tomorrow!"
"Even worse." hundreds of student ex-

claimed in unison.
After threehours ofintense discussion, it
was decided that the students as a collective
whole could riot five weeks from Tuesday
between one and three, but they needed a

QUIGGLEY and the G-MAN

breakfor lunch, and a few complained that as
a result they would have to rewrite their
Sophomore Plan.
I had to do theright thing. I picked up a
recycling bin, and in a sudden torrent of
emotionhurledit at Benjamin West, breaking
windows and igniting afire thatconsumed the
building, the Cherokee Jeeps, and all those
inside.
The student proletariat in shambles, I
found my only solace in my philosophical
beliefs. Forgetting what these were I retreated to the Council on Student Solidarity
headquarters and met up withKatrishka, who
was smoking, and contemplating life at the
same time.
"Hey Katrishka," I said, bumming a cig.
"What's up?"
"Nothing." Katrishka said, crushing her
cigarette against an ash tray and picking up
her motorcycle jacket
"Hey, whatdo you say we go and throw
condoms at the Pro-Lifers like the good old
days? Or maybeput acid tabs in ROTC guys'
underwear?"
"Nah. Got seminar reading, ya know?"
Katrishkaturnedabruptly and left, blaring
away into the sunset with a dark purple Harley
and an herbal remedy for cramps. That was the
last time I saw my faithful comrade before she
became an Engineering major.
April 16: Although bitter, in my heartof
hearts I know Katrishka was right It is time
to hang up the revolutionary spirit and become a minuscule cog in the capitalist machine. Besides, I often feel bitter for no
reason, and this might be one of those times.
April 17: I sold my story to Oliver
Stone, who is making a docudrama. In the
movie the conspiracy dates back to Spiro
Agnew bribing the mafia to drop rat poison in
a vat of granola causing Kitty Dukakais'
alcoholism and thus perpetuating Vietnam.
Anyway, it's a pretty bad movie but it has a
great scene where I(played by Kevin Costner)
lay out the whole conspiracy and then have
sex with Demi Moore, so I'm happy.

All Eyes Off Los Angeles and Our Cities?
by MAIKA WATANABE
As all ofyouhave heardby now, the jury
in the Federal trial of the four Los Angeles
police officers involved in the beating of
Rodney King convicted Sergeant Stacey C.
Koon and Officer Laurence M. Powell of
violating Rodney King's civil rights and acquitted two other officers early Saturday
morning. The guilty verdicts were met mainly
with tears of joy, and sighs ofrelieffor most
Los Angeles residents, who had been waiting
for the jury deliberations since last week.
Though these verdicts were not met with
disturbances as there had been in April of
1992following the acquittal of all the officers
In the state trial, it should not be assumed that
Los Angeles and other cities' cries for help
were met, nor should the nation's focus on
problems in our cities, highlighted since the
Rebellion in Los Angeles, be forgotten.
In this article, I hope to provide a little
background on Los Angeles in the wake of
these recent verdicts.
What makes Los Angeles unique?
The diversity reflectedinLos Angeles is
onereason why it is oftencalled the city ofthe
future. The racial composition ofLos Angeles is 40% Latino, 37% Anglo, 13% African
American, and 9% Asian American, thus over
60% of the population is "minority." Los
Angeles has the most concentrated groups of
many ethnic communities, the Salvadorans
and theKoreans for example, outside oftheir
country of origin. Immigiation is also a
central issue surrounding Los Angeles, especially because of its close proximity to the
Mexico border.
Los Angeles' sheer size and expansiveness is anotherfactor whichdistinguishes Los
Angeles from other cities. The city spans an
area of 469 square miles and has no identifiable center as othercities do. Aproblem with
the size ofthe city is thatLos Angeles does not
have efficient public transportation, and thus
it is difficult to get from one section ofthe city
to the other. Los Angeles is an automobile
city, posing a severe problem for residents
who can not afford cars. Many of the job sites
are not in impoverished areas and require
public transportation to get to the jobs. Without this transportation,residents can not get to
their workplace. Los Angeles is a city separated intovariousdistricts by the structures of
the freeways that run through it. The freeways make.it possible for one to travel from
one edge of the city to the other without ever
getting into the communities. This is perhaps
one reason why 25% ofLos Angeles city
residents, including me until our recent Peace
Studies Mission trip, have never set foot into
the section known as South CentralLos Angeles, resulting in a lack of connection between various communities in the city.
As with many other states, California is
facing a severe fiscal crisis. The state is $8
billion in the red, and thus, the state is reducing social services by a drastic 25%, affecting
law enforcement, health care, welfare, and
education. Los Angeles inparticular seems to
be hard hit since a large proportion of the
city's economic basis was based on the defense industry; and since the end of the Cold
War, many defense industry plants havebeen
closed. In addition, many factories unable to
deal with therecession and the cost of operating in impoverished sections ofLos Angeles
have shut down, causing massive unemployment. The unemployment rate in areas of
concentrated poverty in Los Angeles is as
high as 38%.
What is it like in South Central LA.?
It would be presumptuous of me to tell
you what it is really like in South Central Los
Angeles, having spent only ten days there, but
let me attempt to describe some ofmy impressions of this section of the city.
The media portrayed South Central Los
Angeles as a community inLos Angeles which
is allAfrican American. This is definitely not
true. The demographics of a section of a city
are oftentimes reflected in the neighborhood
school. At Fremont High School in South
Central Los Angeles, the ethnic composition
changed from 85% African American, 15%
Latino in 1984 to 82% Latino, 18% African
American. As these figures indicate, there is
a heavily concentrated Latino population in
—

—

South CentralLos Angeles.
One thing that will stay with me about
South Central is how there are not any supermarkets, mini-marts, banks, movie theatres,
restaurants, or fast-food stores in the communities. Instead there are a few comer liquor
stores (which sell other items in addition to
liquor), pawn shops, and check cashing businesses. Many ofthese stores in SouthCentral
sell items at twice the price of what other
residents pay in other communities because
of increased spending on security for store
owners and because there is not competition
for lower prices.
Because ofthe shortage of businesses in
the area, youth have a very difficult time
finding jobs for the summer or after-school.
One straight-A Latino gang member we met
at Fremont High School informed us that he
had applied for a job at a fast-food restaurant
months before it even opened, but he was still
not offered a job. He as well as other community leaders commented that youth may be
less inclined to stay in a gang if they had a
well-paying job. Thus, urban renewal and
bringing in more businesses into these communities is important, not justfor theservices
offered but also for the jobs offered as well.

images from two totally unrelated incidents,
m addition, Anglo, Latino, African American
as well as Asian American business owners
bore arms to defend their stores since the
LAPD was failing to do anything, as people of
all races looted.
What was happening with leadership and
the public response this year?
In April of 1992, city leaders (specifically the Police Chief and the Mayor) were
not at all prepared to deal withthe Uprisings.
For several years, Mayor Tom Bradley and
formerPolice Chief Dary 1 Gateshad not been
speaking to eachother. The police department
was heavily criticized during the April Uprisings that they were not taking any action to
curb theviolence. City leadership failed during this crucial time period.
This time, Police ChiefWillie Williams,
formerly Chief of Philadelphia, had come up
with a comprehensive plan for police officers
to be in the community even before the verdicts came out. 6,500 police officers plus
National Guard troops had been ready. In
addition, Chief Williams had also had LAPD
undergo extensive sensitivity and riot-related
training since lastyear. When members of the
Tri-College Peace Studies Mission spoke to
—

The expectations of this recent Federal trial were also
different, leading to a response unlike last year. Many
people last year believed that all four police officers would
be convicted. When the verdicts were read in the State
trial, residents were shocked.
—What were SOME of thelooters thinking in
April 1992?
As I watched many of the looters on
television in April of 1992, I kept asking
myself what many ofthese people were thinking as they looted the stores. Before I give
two examples of what people said, it must be
clarifiedthatnot allresidents in South Central

Los Angeles looted. The majority of the
residents did not, nor did they support the
lootings that did occur. Some looters were
obviously taking advantage of the situation,
but for others, looting was a matter of survival. One student we talked to at Fremont
High School told us that he looted the neighborhood store because he knew that it would
go up in flames. Since this store was one of
the only ones in his neighborhood, he and his
ten member family would then have had
nothing to eat after their food at home was
eaten, if he had not looted.
A representative from CARECEN, an
organization working with Central American
Refugees, stated that some Latin American
refugees looted because the situationwith the
fires evoked strong memories of the war-torn
areas from where they escaped. They too
were afraid that once the few stores around
them were burned, there would be nothing
left for them to eat.
In looking at these two examples, we
must also examine the social conditions which
prompted some residents to loot in the first
place. There had not been many social services available to residents in these communities, especially with the recent budget cuts.
Many live in overcrowded housing projects,
others are not able to buy sufficient groceries
for their families with their low wages, and
many more are unemployed.
Was it mainly a Black-Korean conflict?
Many people failed to consider the immense power of the media and its ability to
misrepresent thefacts while they watched the
TV news on April 29,1992. Contrary to the
media's version of the events, Koreans were
not the only victims of the Uprising. In fact,
30-40% of the businesses damaged and/or
lost during the Uprisings were Latino-owned.
This fact alone dispels the myth that the
Uprisings were essentially a "Black-Korean"
conflict and that ethnic identity was the sole
criterion in target-choosing. Soundbytes of
African-American looters and of gun-wielding Korean Americans manipulated many to
connect the two together as one package,
leading them to believe that the conflict did
primarily involve Blacks and Koreans. In
reality, however, the mediaoften spliced these
—

Chief Williams, he informed us that he is
advocating more foot-based policing so that
police officers wouldhave contact with community residents, restoring a trust between
police officers and the community. In order to
increase the number of foot police, he has
requested a new measure on the city ballot for
April 20, 1993 to add a property tax to
increase the police force by 1000 more members. WillieWilliams hasalso received praise
from the community since he is doing a lot of
work to keep in touch with community needs,
something Daryl Gates did not do. Since
moving to Los Angeles, Willie Williams has
enrolled himself in a Spanish language class
reflecting his desire to understand his new
community better.
In addition, Mayor Tom Bradley failed
to address the city before theverdict was read
last year. Only after there was some indication that therewouldbe rioting throughout the
city didhemake a public statement This time
around, the Mayor addressed the city the
night before theverdict was read, calling for
calm through the city the next morning, outlining some of the measures the city was
taking to maintain peace through the city. The
roles that the Mayor and the Police Chief took
during this time definitely made an impact on
how the city reacted this year.
Furthermore, one mustnot deemphasize
the power of the media. As I watched the
news at 10 a.m. EST, one stationrecorded the
elated response of many powerful AfricanAmerican community leaders at theFirst African Methodist Episcopal Church in South
Central Los Angeles. Reverend Cecil E.
Murray, Reverend Jesse Jackson and other
membersof the congregation expressedrelief
that at least two of thepolice officers had been
convicted. These leaders played a powerful
role in shaping the responses of many other
Los Angeles residents.
The expectations of this recent Federal
trial were also different, leading to a response
unlike last year. Many people last year believed that all four police officers would be
convicted. When theverdicts were read in the
State trial, residents were shocked. On the
other hand, while theFederal Trial was going
on, some people were saying that the result
wouldbe either a hung jury or that some ofthe
officers would get off. The expectations were
very different for the two trials, contributing
in part to a differentresponse from the public.
What about FEMA?
Federal Emergency Management Aid
(FEMA) is a federal program designed to help
citizens rebuild their businesses and homes

—

after some type of disaster. FEMA has three
main goals: to provide financial assistance,
temporary housing, and mortgage and rental
assistance. Though there is a lot of funding
available, over 60% of people who applied for
FEMA assistance were denied. Why? Lack
ofdocumentation. FEMA failed to recognize
that many immigrants were unfamiliar with
the system, that many documents were lost in
the fires, that many new business owners had
difficulty proving that they were operating at
a profit before the stores were destroyed. In
addition, 40% of the lost business owners
were uninsured because of the cost ofinsurance in those areas or had coverage from
fraudulentinsurance companies withred-lined
policies excluding service from areas in South
CentralLos Angeles. FEMA guidelines were
written to help natural disaster victims and
not human-made disaster victims. FEMA
must rewrite policies to makecoverage more
accesible for all disaster victims.
Whatabout the rebuilding ofLos Angeles?
Rebuild Los Angeles (now officially
known as RLA—"Our L.A.") is ironically
one of the most well-publicized and least
known about organization. RLA seeks to
bridge the community, the government, and
the private sector to form a three-legged
stool. One of its primary goals is to get
businesses into South Central which RLA
has to some extent succeeded to do. For
example, RLA was able to secure a supermarket chain to be built in sections ofSouth
Central Los Angeles. The three-legged stool
at this point totters unstably. The community leg is unstable in that many leaders of
community based organizations feel thattheir
voices have not beenheard. The government
leg is very weak since the idea behind RLA
was conjured up by the Mayor and Governor
Pete Wilson and then thrown out for RLA
members to work with, receiving private sector funding. Though there are city council
members involved in some of thesubcommittees, by far the strongest leg seems to be the
private sector leg. RLA is perceived as a topdown organization which with its name is
perceived as the cure-all for all the problems
in Los Angeles. RLA has to clarify misconceptions andoutline whatits goals are specifically. RLA can never do what it was never
established to do.
By far what I see as the strength of the
rebuilding efforts in Los Angeles is the community based organizations the churches,
the various ethnic community organizations,
legal assistance centers, and youth coalitions.
These groups are working in the communities
now, and community members see results.
Various organizations are working on youth
education, job placement, legal assistance,
job training, child care, race relations workshops, and psychological services. These
organizations are particularly effective because they are in touch with the needs of the
community around them.
Most community leaders were not too
surprised that the Uprisings erupted last year,
given the social conditions in which people
lived—high unemployment, few available
social services, crime, and police brutality.
We have to remember thatfor many survivors
of police brutality, the Rodney King beating
was not just one isolated incident captured on
videotape as it was for many of us. This was
just one police brutality case in a countless
numberofbeatings targeted against people of
color. The Uprisingrepresented a response to
years of police brutality, years offrustration
over the lack of social services and jobs. It
was not just Rodney King. Certainly with the
trial of the L.A. 4+, the four men accused of
the beating of Reginald Dermy, as well as the
actual sentencing of the two convicted police
officers coming up this summer, the tension
in Los Angeles over another Uprising is far
from being diffused.
My concern is this: Now that all eyes
havebeen shiftedfrom Los Angeles since the
recent verdict, will the problems of our cities
be forgotten? Despite all that community
based organizations are doing in Los Angeles, there are still so many problems thatneed
to be addressed. Unemployment, education,
race relations, welfare reform, all require action. Unless there is action, another Uprising
will no doubt occur again.

Johnson's Last Stand: Paul and James Review Six Films in OneWeek

Paul: Shit James, this is the last

are we gonna do?
Adam: Why don'tyou whine some
more?
James: Just because you got a
guest spot last week doesn't mean
you're all hot shit now, Adam.
Anyway, we just need to talk about
the movies for six lines this week
instead ofjust two. We'll still have
plenty of space to annoy people
who are reading this hoping for a
review or something.
Paul: Ok, let's start out with this
week first. Playing Friday in the
PAC Cinema at precisely 7:30 and
10:00 p.m. will be the movie The
Jerk.
James: And on Saturday in the

movies, and I like both of them.
Paul: Um, oh, I don't think I've
seen either of them. Actually, no,
I've seen part of My Own Private
Idaho. Oops, actually I guess not.
I'm confused.
James: Gene VannlovedThe Jerk.
In fact, I think it might be hisfavorite movie. It's not my favorite
movie, but Steve Martin is just so
funny that I think everyone should
go see it.
Paul: I hate Steve Martin.

Paul and James say "Goodbye."

Adam: Why? You hate everybody, Paul.
Paul: No, I don't. I just hate you
and Steve Martin and good actors...
James: But thismovie is so funny.
All of that stuff about his "special
purpose" is hilarious. I do warn
everyone that a lot of the movie
relies on really, truly tasteless humor, such as this column.

to talk about and thismovie is basi-

cally just slap-stick/one-liner humor which is very hard toreview, so
let's move on.
Paul: Five more movies!! OH!!
James: My Own Private Idaho is a
kind of weird movie, but it's obviously trying to be weird, so it loses
some of that charm. I didreally like
the scenes where the house falls.
It's a movieabout this teenager who
is a narcolepticprostitute. It's obviously trying to say something deep
and intellectual, but I'm not sure
that I got it I just thought ithadcool
cinematography and I liked that
scene where they 're inside the porno
magazines in the store. If you want
to know what it's about, I think the
major plot line is about the
narcoleptic's search for his mother
which takes him as far as Europe.
The otherbig thing is his friend and
how he leaves the street life behind
because he's actually rich.
Paul: I don'tknow about My Own
Private Idaho, but Al's from Idaho.
They have a lot of com there. Oh, I
mean potatoes. He says it's a cool
place. They drive trucks, and they
drink a lot. So, it must be a good
movie. It reminds me ofhome. But
shit, Al's from lowa, well, I guess
the movie must suck then.
James: I really liked it. It was a
goodmovie. I might have even paid
to see it though I think I saw it on
cable or something. Let's try week
two.

Paul: Ok, week two. Both movies
are showing in thePAC. Friday at
thenormal times isUnforgiven and
on Saturday will be Top Gun. I've
seen both of these. Actually, I've
seen all of the movies for the rest of
the year.
James: Well, I haven't seen
Unforgiven, but I've seen all of the
rest, and I might actually go to
Unforgiven. We're supposed to have
an M.C.C./Clint Eastwood reunion
night.
Paul: Unforgiven is one of those
series of modern westerns which
have been coming out lately. I like
it. But I hate everything. So, I hated
it too. But anyway, it's an action
movie that depicts the West in more
realistic terms. I thinkthe message
is that people really die and there are
no heroes. Of course, Clint
Eastwood is good. The Western
movie is obviously his best genre.
Every which way butLoose was so
lame. Especially, the gratuitous use
of monkeys.
James: I've seen all of the Spaghetti Westerns like forty-eight
times a piece. I sort of like them

better than the newer westerns of
his, but he is definitely the man
when it comes to westerns, so I'll be
there. As for Top Gun, what's with
that movie? Totally cheez whiz if
you ask me. I'd say it was Easy
Cheese, but I like Easy Cheese.
Paul: I hate Easy Cheese. This is
one of Tom Cruise's "I Can Be a
Million Kind of Heroes" movies.
He's a fighterpilot, arace car driver,
a pool shark, a bartender, a race car
driver...
James: You already said that one.
Mister Short Term MemoryPaul: I know, a pimp! I don't
know. I have a habit of liking these
movies. You just got to hate Tom

Paul: It'sabout these androids who

out already) because they're going

James: The really cool thing is that
the movie is just like those industrial plants just on the other side of
the bridge. You know, the ones
with the big flames that go
"WHOOOSSSSHHHH"!
Paul: In all seriousness, this movie
is one of a rare breed of science
fictionmovies thathas an excellent
plot and good acting. HarrisonFord
definitely plays a slick character,
and there's a lot of funky deep shit
going around.
James: The last movie, Paul! I
think I'm going to be emotional.
Paul: Are Cheech and Chong in it?
James: No, but Wayne and Garth
are. Of course, they're not nearly as
funny. This movie is supposed to be
a funny look at people who listen to
rock and have a cable access show.
It's not nearly as funny as I thought
it would be. It's not really bad, but
don't get your hopes to high.
Paul: Hey, don't get high. Don't
get high at all. It's bad for you.
Don't you know it's bad for you.

James: Is that why you lost your
memory, Paul? Is that why you
repeat everything you say four seconds later? Anyway, theseguys are

funnier there than in this movie.
Paul: Hey, I don't do drugs. And
you know I would never do drugs. I
saw this movie with my ex-girlfriend. I wouldn't recommend doing that It was kind of depressing.
It was a movie that was supposed to
be funny and wasn't and I thinkthat
it's unsafe to say how that relates to

James: Anyway, it would appear
that we are done. Time for a few
gratuitous non-movie type things.

and political activism.
Figuring one ofmy colleagues
will writeabout the smells, weather,
birdies, and flowers (perfect subjects for the humorous musings in
Take Two if you ask me), I'll spend

my time focusing on thelatter signs
of the season: specs and activism.
What was up with the specs?
Have you ever seen a cockier bunch
ofkids? (Of course, my three specs
are excludedfrom thefollowing diatribe; and if any of you come here
and get a hold of a back copy of the
Phoenix, don't get offended and try
to hurt me. Besides, I thinkI could
probably take two of you.)
I mean, I realize they probably
felt that we had to impress them,
since they've already gotten in here
and they can choose anywhere they
want ("My parents really want me
to go to Harvard, and my great Uncle
thinks I shouldgo to Yale. I personally like Princeton, but tell me, why
do you think I should come to
Swarthmore?"), but the amount of
ego they displayed was unreal.
First of all, they all hung out
together. They walked around this
campus like they owned it. When I,
being the great guy that I am, offered to take one of my specs out
with my friends to get a shake at
Nifty Fiftys, I was turned down.
Can you believe that? Someone
passing up the opportunity to not
only partake of a Reesey Cup or
Mint Oreo shake but to hang out
with me and my awesome friends?
And then, when the person spurns
you to go hang out withother specs
(it's like they're almost an official
clique) in, ofall places, Mertz (yes,
that's right folks, I've decided to
rotate and poke fun at a new dorm),
you feel even worse.
The specs were obnoxious too.
You almost wish some of them decided to go to the otherschools they
always talkedabout. Ifthey weren't
talking incessantly in one of your
classes trying to show off (that's a
privilege reserved only for people
who are actually enrolled at
Swarthmore), they might be (and
this is a true story) getting up in the
middle ofyour class to answer their
beeper. A beeper?! "What the
fug?!" as the Johnsons might say.
Who the hell needs a beeper at the
age of seventeen (okay, don't answer that, but it's not what you
think).
When asked just what exactly
she was being beeped for, the spec
explained that her debate club from
high school was having some problems and that she'dleft instructions
that she was to be beeped if her
assistance was needed. At this point,
you just wanted to tell her to go to
Princetonand have a wonderfullife
in the Republican Party. I mean,
what is it with specs these days?
Way back when I was a spec, I
was a picture of timidity, gratefulness, and subservience. I did not
speak unless I was spoken to, and
then I answered only the question
asked of me. When my host was so
nice as to give me directions to the
bathroom on his hall ("Go out my
door, make a right and it's on your
right. You can't miss it"),

I thanked him profusely. And
when my host ditched me because
he had something better to do (like
study), I sat in his room and read.
When someone knocked on his door,
I pretended like I wasn't there and I
didn't even answer it, forfear thatI
might take down the wrong message and somehowoffend my master... er... host. Now that's the
way it used to be.
Speaking ofhow things used to
be, what's up with all of this political activism lately? I came to
Swarthmore expecting this sort of
atmosphere, butafter not seeing any
signs ofpolitical life for my first six
months here, I kind of figured that
maybe this place's reputation was a
bit overblown.
Then spring hits and BAM!,
there' s activism enveloping the campus. From ASORA to theWomen's
Center to the Mushroom Workers
(' shrooms a suitable topic forJohnson at the Movies) to Survivors to
the incinerator, there are signs and
rallies and posters and ribbons everywhere.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not
complaining (the obligatory comment to prevent any letters but nevertheless sincerely said), but I'm
just wondering where it all came
from so damn fast. It's almost like
that whenpeople were prompted by
thenice weather to bring theirBirks
out of their closets, they brought
their matching politics out with
them.
Well, that about does it for this
time, and in fact, that about does it
for this year and maybe ever. You
see, this is the last issue budgeted
for the Schenk Era (yes, the man
that brought you the Johnsons will
be riding off into the sunset), so
there will be no more Signifying
Nothing until next year and that, of
course, is only if I decide to submit
myself again to the kind of abuse
I've taken this year.
When random people on campus think you're the most obnoxious person they've never met,
you've got to wonder if it's worthit
Whenpeople, after being introduced
to you, say, "Oh, so you're
Zengerle," and throw Bluedini in
your face (not true, merely told to
illicit sympathy), you start to question just how important your columnis in the grand schemeofthings.
When two guys, one who looks like
the Road Warrior and the other who
likes Fred from that great movie
Drop Dead Fred, call you a "twelve
year old lookingfugger," you begin
to (sniff, sniff) doubt humanity.
When that happens, you think
about walking away. You think
about giving up. So I say to you
now, don' t lookfor my name on any
Features column come next September. Don'tbe disappointed when
you don't have someone making an
ass out of themselves in this paper
week in and week out. Don't get
upset when I'm missing from your
lives (all four of you my parents
and the parents of one ofmy editors
(yes you, Mr. and Mrs. Rocque)
who still read this thing) and your
days are full of gloom and despair.
That's right folks, I am not a crook
(oops, wrong line, let's try that
again). You're not going to have
Zengerle to kick around anymore.
But then again, who knows?
Come September of '93, I might
just be ready to write again, after
havinghad a nice long summer away
from thesensitivefolks here at Swat.
Come the start of a new school year,
I might just beback: tan, rested, and
ready.
Good luck on your exams and
have a great summer!

Still Alive: Men's Tennis Crushes SUNY Binghamton
A Victory Against Skidmore on Saturday, at Home, Could Earn Squad NCAA Wildcard Berth
by BRANDT LINCOLN
This past weekend theBandits
traveled to Binghamton, New York
to face two Eastern Divisionrivals.
On Saturday, the Garnet faced off
with the University of Rochester,
and on Sunday, they were matched
against SUNY Binghamton. It was
a very important weekend for the
Bandits, as wins over both teams
would assure the Garnet an NCAA
National bid. The end result was
that the Bandits split the weekend
duals, which ultimatelykeeps a possible NCAA wild card invitation
alive.
Saturday was a day that tried

Men's Track Kicks Ass

Considering the fact that the
Bandits had not finished their match
with Rochesteruntil two in themoming the previous night, the team was
not looking forward to playing their
match Sunday against SUNY
Binghamton. However, theBandits
were inspired by an old saying that
states: "Even in times when things
look their darkest, there is always a
spotlight shining bright in the night
to signify the grand opening of a
new pharmacy," The Bandits took
this saying to heart and crushed
SUNY Binghamton by the score of
five to one. Lead once againby the
excellent play of Phil Rosenstrach
and Jeremy Shweder, the rest of the
team followed suit as SUNY was hit
by a tornado of blistering
groundstrokes.
At first singles, Rosenstrach
won in straight sets by the scores of
7-5 and 6-2. Jeremy Shweder won
convincingly at second singles as
he was finished in time to watch the
second and third sets of his teammates. At third singles, George
Khalaf was cruising to a rather easy
victory when his opponent came
alive to extend him to a second set

tie-break, which he ultimately won
close out the match. Brandt Lincoln, at the fourth position, came
back from an early break in the first
set to win by the scores of 7-5 and 63. Barry "Fist" Mook clinched the
match at the fifth spot as he won in
three hard-fought sets. TheBandits'
shellacking was not done though.
In an exhibition match, Chris Ciunci
also manhandled his SUNY opponent despite a pesky viewer and
companion. The decisive victory
kept the Garnets'possibilitiesfor an
at large bid to the NCAA tournament alive. The Bandits will need
to defeat their last Division 111 opponent, Skidmore, and pray for favorable outcomes in othermatches
in order to make the tournament.
But until then, theBandits will worry
about their upcoming matches
againstBloomsburg University and
Princeton University.
The Bandits will be hosting
Skidmore tomorrow at the Wharton
Courts. Along with all the Swatfest
activitiesplanned, the Garnetwould
like to welcome everyone to come
and view one of the Bandits' last
home matches of the year.

Golfers to Cap Frustrating Season at MACs
from which the team never recovered. All season Swat depended on
strong play from the three players

come tantalizingly close to qualifying for the conference championship, but fell just two strokes short
in thefinal match Tuesday at Reading Country Club.
For those unfamiliar with golf
scoring, here's the main idea: the
lowerthe better. Paronmostcourses
is 72 (what a pro should shoot). To
qualifyfor theMAC championships,
three scores which together average
95 or better must be recorded. Only
Zuluaga (averaging in themid-80s),
Metcalf (high80s), andLatham (low
90s) qualified under thisrule. Teams

generally are composed of four or
five golfers, and so as a result, the
Swat golfers will only be able to
compete in individual competition,
not as a team. The tournament is a
two-day, threeround (54 holes) tournament at MountainLaurel Resort
in White Haven, Pennsylvania.
The team is already looking
toward being stronger next year,
with only one senior, David
Jenemann, leaving. While failing
to qualify this year, the team's
younger members, Straub, Paul Kim
'96, and Rob Day '95, all showed
fine potential for improvement.
Tuesday, in fact, Day turned in a
career-best 97 (on his birthday, no
less). With everyone returning, a
hopefully healthy Liimekens, and
ever-present rumors ofgreatrecruits,
Swat golf is looking forward to next
season to overcome the disappointments of the last two years.

The Swarthmore Women's
Tennis Team, currently 13th in

theend ofits spring season with an
overall record of 11 wins and 4
losses. The women wonkey matches
against Haverford, Washington

season is not yet complete, though.
April 30 through May 2, the individual MAC tournament will be
played at Gettysburg College. Becca

title for the second year, while Alicia Thesing '93 and Hilary Gehlbach

(Will Roth '93, Delvin Dinkins '93, Mike Turner '96 and Duane "DTrain" Malone '93) will compete at the World-Famous Penn Relays.
Swat will also host MACs on April 30 and May 1.

Like lastyear, the team is young

is Kolasky, followed by Nteta at
second singles. Third singles is
Becky Katz '95, fourth is Thesing,
fifth is Gehlbach, and sixth are Sarah
Davis '93 and Jean Tak '94. Seventh singles is ValerieThrelfall '96.
The doubles teams are lead by
Kolasky and Nteta, followed by
Thesing and Katz, and Davis and
Gehlbach. Kim Crusey '95 is currently serving as the team cheerer
due to a nasty sprained ankle.
Recently, Swarthmore lost key

matches against powerhouse rivals
Trenton State and Franklin &
Marshall. These two teams proved
to have even more depth andpower
than the Garnet Women. In both,
however, Kolasky defeated two nationally rankedplayers: GinaPelligi
from TrentonState 2-6,7-6,6-3 and
Viki JiranekofFranklin & Marshall
6-3,4-6,6-3. Katz also defeated the
tennis player's worst nightmare of
an opponent who would periodically scream out in desperation and
make lewd and rude comments/
gestures. Vengeance is sweet,
Becky.
Thehighlight of the season was
the match against Haverford. Always tough competitors, this year
was no exception as Haverford
brought a deep and talented team to
S warthmore's courts two weeksago.
However, they were not deep and
talented enough to overcome our
powerful team. With the overall
score tiedat 4 -4, theseconddoubles

third and determining set In a brilliant display of doubles strategy,

With Two Games Remaining, Men's Lax Shoots to Finish Above .500
by BEN SEIGEL
In a week full of action, the
men's lacrosse team was able to win
two out of three games on their
home turf. Last Saturday, the Garnet buried FDU-Madison 24-2, on
Tuesday they lost a tight one against
Drexel University, and yesterday
they were able to get ahead early to
defeatWidener in MAC battle.
Coming off a close loss to
Franklin & Marshall last Wednesday, Swat returned home for their
final five games to face FDU on
Saturday. Swat came out prepared
to put an extra spark in the Parents
Weekend entertainment. They
started early and kept therelentless
Quaker tradition going strong for
the whole game, as they beat FDU
by a more than twenty point margin.
Will Craig '96 showed off his finishing capabilities, scoring three
goals in the victory.
On Tuesday the team returned
to Clothier Field to face Drexel in
perhaps the best weather conditions
of the season. The opponent on this
day, however, was on a different
level than theFDU team. Drexel, a
Division I school, had justcome off
an upset of the University ofPennsylvania and they had earlier defeated Villanova, another Division
I power. Leading Drexel was senior
transferErikFink, cousins with Swat
defensemanMark. Despite the overwhelming opponent, Swarthmore
came out relaxed and ready to stick

it to Drexel. Kirk Ramer '93 picked
the DU defense apart quickly, scoring the first two goals of the game.
Swat's zone kept them close in the
first half by holding Drexel to five
scores (all of them by Fink). At
halftime Swat trailed by a score of
5-4.In the early minutes ofthe third
quarter Drexel came out strong,
opening the game up to take a 10-4
lead. Therestofthe game wasplayed
as catch up ballfor Swat with a final
score of 14-8. The loss was the
second time in the past two losses
thatSwat saw a closehalftime score
fall to pieces in the second half.
Yesterday Swat faced route 320
rival, Wideneron CuiminghamField
due to theweatherconditions. Widener surprised Swat by scoring the
game's first goal. This let down,
however, fired up theLittle Quakers, who put the heat on the Pioneers, opening thegame up to a 9-2
Swat lead. Behind the fire power of
Greg Ferguson's '93 five goals,
Swarthmore closed thegame with a
15-9 final.
After the week, Swat's record
stands at 6-5 with two games remaining. Tomorrow they have a
challenge against Western Maryland, who beat F&M earlier this
season by a 15-6score. On Tuesday
they have their final game of the
season (with the exception of the
May 2 Alumni game) against West
Chester. These next four days are
crucial to the team's final record, as
they can finishabove or below .500.
