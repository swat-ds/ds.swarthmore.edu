Open IntraClass Dialogue discusses class privilege
BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu

This month class activists and other

organizers have collaborated on a number of

events for Class Awareness Month. These
events included the Opening Panel on

Thursday, Nov. 1

and

Education"

and the "Class, Ethnicity
Ring Discussion on

Thursday, Nov. 8.

There was also the opportunity to discuss

the issue at the IntraClass Dialogue that
took place on Friday, Nov. 9 and consisted of
a first part where the participants were separated into three groups based on class and
then reunited for the second part, which was
an open discussion.

"I thought it was
productive. It was good I
think to split the groups up
before bringing them back
together for dialogue."
Lauren Smith 'OB
Andrea Cornejo 'lO, one of the organizers
of CAM emphasized the importance of dia-

logue in bringing forward the sometimes not
so obvious issues surrounding class differences. "It is difficult to talk about class
because one can't see it; it's not physical, not
[tangible] like race. So, it makes it much easier to go without being heard or discussed or
anything of the sort. With the IntraClass dialogue, along with the other activities that
we're having during Class Awareness
Month, we're trying to promote dialogue,
and through dialogue, awareness," Cornejo
said.

The IntraClass Dialogue has been taking
for the past two years. This year for
the first time, the participants were separated according to class into a privileged group,
a straddling group and a working class
group. "We wanted to first ofall have a place
where both privileged students would feel
their privilege and where students that feel

place

they are not privileged, or come from a

class, could talk about the issues
that pertain to them, that perhaps others
would not relate to and would cause discomfort," Cornejo said. "We also wanted to have
a place where everyone could come in contact and talk about issues in general, whatever they may be, having already discussed
things that perhaps others wouldn't feel
comfortable discussing."
Lauren Smith 'OB, who participated in the
dialogue, felt that the structure of the dialogue was constructive. "I thought it was
productive. It was good I think to split the
groups up before bringing them back together for dialogue," Smith said.
working

Rory Sykes 'OB, another organizer of the
event, explained the breakdown of the three
groups. There were many students in attendance representing the privileged class
group, some representing straddling class
group and only two non-facilitating students
representing the working class group. "For
the working class group, I was a facilitator.
My co-facilitator was there as well, and only
two other students showed up and both of
them were organizers of class awareness
month. So we were shocked," Sykes said.
The first year that a dialogue on class
awareness took place, it was meant only for
people who identified as belonging to the
working class. Sykes suggested that the
diminishing number of participants for the
working class group was perhaps attributable to the new structure creating a weaker
feeling of comfort. "Maybe people didn'tfeel
as comfortable showing up to something ...
framed in that way, that seemed ... less of a
safe space perhaps. Also it was a Friday
afternoon, it started at 4, so maybe that dealt

with it," Sykes said.

However, Sykes was very pleased with
the turnout in the open group discussion,
the second part of the IntraClass Dialogue.
"Overall, I was really pleased with the
IntraClass dialogue, it was held in a
Kohlberg classroom and it was full, there
were people on the outside of the circle, sitting on the floor. It was really exciting,"
Sykes said.
The open group discussion was facilitated by Registrar Martin Warner, a supporter
of Class Awareness Month since its first

Registrar Martin Warner facilitates an open group discussion on class differences
appearance on campus two years ago.
"[Warner] seemed appropriate for this posi-

tion because he could relate to the topic in
some way," explained Cornejo.

"It is difficult to talk about
class because one can't
see it; it's not physical, not
[tangible] like race."
Andrea Cornejo 'lO
The discussions centered around how
class can change depending on the environment, between home and college, as well as
around the guilt that accompanies privilege.
"I don't think we talked enough in depth
about exactly what ways we can be allies, in
what ways people who do still have guilt
from not doing anything about the current
situation, what could we do to help," Cornejo
said. The event was supposed to take place

from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. but lasted an hour
more, finishing around 7:15 p.m. According
to both Cornejo and Sykes, there will be further dialogues this month, one focusing on
finding a way for privileged individuals to
assist less privileged ones. The other would
be another closed discussion group for the
working class.
Another feature of Class Awareness
Month is the Class Shock cloth in Shane
Lounge where anybody can anonymously
post their responses on issues pertaining to
class.
"I think the class shock wall was a good

alternative to actually attending the discussions that they hosted this month," Alysha
Newton 10 said. "Some people may feel
strongly about class but may not actually
feel comfortable in a specific setting. The
class shock wall provided an opportunity for
people to get their opinion out there, get
their opinions across, and see what other
people think and respond in an anonymous

way."

Drug delivery service to health center begins
BY ROSA KIM

rkiml@swarthmore. edu

Worth Health Center now offers a prescription delivery
service in partnership with Good Neighbor Pharmacy in
Media. The service, which is primarily for students unable
to get their prescriptions filled due to illness or injury, delivers prescriptions from the pharmacy to Worth Monday
through Thursday at 3 p.m.

Worth's new director, Beth Kotarski, said she looked into
making the service available this semester after students
asked for some kind of a system in which they could get medication that is not readily available at the health center.
Kotarski researched health centers at neighboring institutions such as Haverford College, Bryn Mawr College,
University of Pennsylvania and Widener University to get a
sense of the kinds of services they offer as a basis for com-

Worth nurse practitioner Eileen Strasiunias said that the
new system might also enable doctors to prescribe medication they may have been hesitant to prescribe previously,
now that they know it will be readily available.

"That seems like it would be really
useful because I know that people
have a hard time getting off campus
to get prescriptions filled if you don't
have a car or a friend who does."
Nora Nussbaum 'OB

parison.

Kotarski found that most schools in the area have established relationships with their local pharmacies, which
make deliveries at regular intervals. "What health center
directors usually do, especially when they're new, is look
around and see what are some of the services being offered
or not, that perhaps other colleges do or don't do. So I really
like to compare to other places and see, what's the norm,
what's the standard," Kotarski said.

THE PHOENIX

"It probably worked okay before, but you can hand a student a prescription and you wonder if they're actually going
to get it filled. I'd say it ensures that the kids are going to get
what they need and gives us a little bit of peace of mind
knowing that they're taken care of," Strasiunias said.
The idea of the new delivery service is welcomed by students. "That seems like it would be really useful because I
know that people have a hard time getting off campus to get

November 15, 2007

prescriptions filled if you don't have a car or a friend who

does," Nora Nussbaum 'OB said.
In order to use the service, students need to pay the copay at pick-up as they would if they were getting their prescription filled on their own. However, they would have to
pay with cash or check because Worth does not presently
accept credit cards.
While the service is available for all students regardless

of their physical or medical condition, at least for now, with
the service still in its initial stages, Kotarski hopes that it
will be used primarily by those who are unable to get to a
pharmacy on their own.
"What we're hoping is that this system will be used really for students of need because of illness or some kind of
infirmity that would be a lot to ask them to go get their own
medicine
We really don't want, at least initially, to overtax the system," Kotarski said.
Kotarski said she recognizes that there are more pressing
issues for students, such as transportation to non-urgent
medical appointments. "That seems to be a huge issue," she
said. She said her intent was to have this simpler service up
and running while she looks into the larger issue of providing transportation, which will involve several different
offices. "We have to develop a better system of transport,"
Kotarski said. "We're looking at ways of improving that.
This is step one, the pharmacy piece."

Student greens dorm room as a mini-model of sustainability
BY YINGJIA WANG
ywangl@swarthmore.edu
While students at Swarthmore have no doubt seen the
their bathrooms and laundry rooms encouraging them to conserve water and energy when they brush
their teeth or wash their clothes, one senior has motivated herself to go a step further to help the environsigns in

ment.

Environmentalist and engineering major Lauren
Goodfriend 'OB combined both interests when she decided to make her dorm room eco-friendly.
Goodfriend's plan was hatched in the spring of 2006
when she read about students at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who had made significant adaptations to their dorm room.
"My initial motivation, oddly, was when sometime
sophomore year I saw this article about these MIT freshmen who had totally tricked out their dorm room. They
had a party button, and when they pressed the button the
lights would turn off, the music would turn on, and
such," Goodfriend said.
While this party room intrigued Goodfriend, she
wanted to replicate it in a more environmentally conscious way. Therefore, in the summer between her sophomore and junior years, Goodfriend researched various
options for power generation and energy storage, and
eventually settled on a system run on energy from solar

panels.
According to Goodfriend, this system involves a solar
panel bolted to a frame that is then attached to the outside of the building next to a window. When light hits the
panel, it generates a current that then travels through
wires that direct the energy to a large cutoff switch
inside Goodfriend's room.
The energy then continues through a charge controller to the batteries
the charge controller prevents
the batteries from overcharging and ensures that the
power does not run backwards from the battery.
Finally, the energy goes to an inverter that converts
the energy from DC current to the AC current that is
needed by the lights and computers in the room. While
this system cannot power everything that may be pres-

ent in a standard dorm room
for example an electric
kettle, which demands too much power from the inverter
it does sufficiently power everything Goodfriend
has designated.
The solar panel system was up and running in
Goodfriend's dorm room last school year, and has been
put up again this school year with no significant modifications. "The system was working basically how I wanted it to, so there was no need
to modify it. Also, I ran out of the money
to modify it," Goodfriend said. The total
cost of the project hovered around $4OO,
with most of the cost going toward the

and a steel bridge that can be taken apart and put together to certain specifications, are among the projects currently being worked on by students in the department.
"I think that people think of engineers as drones, and
I think it's actually one of the more creative majors, in
the literal sense of the word. When you're done with an
engineering course or project, you can point to a thing
you've created. [You're] taking something and using it
for purposes that it may not have been intended for.
You're not just going out and buying stuff, but also figuring out how it works and doing more design for it,"
Cheever said.

solar panel.

Having perfected her system of energy
self-sufficiency, Goodfriend wished to take
on another project.
"I was itching to make something,"
Goodfriend said. Now she is designing and
building an aeroponics system to grow
vegetables. Similar to hydroponics, aeroponics involves growing plants without
the use of soil.
However, while hydroponics still
requires that the plants be soaked in
water, aeroponics does not require the use
of a growing medium. Nutrients are
instead misted at the roots.
Engineering department chair and professor Erik Cheever 'B2 noted that
Goodfriend's desire to build things is
shared by many engineering students and
is due in part to the projects required by
many engineering classes at Swarthmore.
According to Cheever, engineering
majors at Swarthmore generally take
fewer credits in their major than their
counterparts at other institutions due to
Swarthmore's requirements that 20 out of
the 32 credits required for graduation be
outside of the major.
As a result, the department attempts to
cram as much learning as possible into
each credit by adding a lab requirement to
something that is generally
each course
not done at other schools.
Cheever said that the construction of a
music visualizer at the hardware level, a
notepad that can sit outside of a professor's office while receiving notes from a
professor who is sitting inside the office

"...

...

The engineering curriculum at the college, along with
Goodfriend's projects, has also inspired fellow engineering students.
"This is very cliche to say, but the way the engineering classes are structured, it just makes you think outside the box," engineering student Travis Rothbloom 'lO
said.
"I think that [Goodfriend] has set an example for
young engineers like me to see how engineering can be
very practical to our lives even now, not just in a few
years to come," engineering student Omari Faayke 'lO
said.
Goodfriend says that she is not actually interested in
going into energy as a profession, as she is more interested in groundwater quality.
However, Goodfriend sees her recent projects impacting her personal life in the future.
"I would like my residence to be powered by renewable energy, whether that be home-generated energy or
energy bought from a grid," Goodfriend said. "There's
something very appealing about generating your own
power. As an educated environmentalist, I know that
that's not the best way. It's a lot more efficient to buy, for
example, wind energy from a big plant, but there's still
that impulse to be self-sufficient."

GHF week garners
positive feedback
BY MATT BLEIMAN

mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

The Global Health Forum recent-

ly wrapped up its week-long "Catch
the Bug!" anti-malaria campaign.
Co-founder Mark Dlugash 'OB said

he was pleased with the outcome.
"Everything about the campaign
was positive. A lot of people at the
school seemed interested and asked
me about it," Dlugash said. "I saw
people staring at the bednets."
Dlugash said he believes that the
events were helpful in terms of
spreading awareness of malaria and
its effects. One of the goals of the
Global Health Forum is to spread

awareness of diseases, so Dlugash
said that this campaign helped to
accomplish that goal.
"Given the effort, excitement and
enthusiasm that all of the members
put into this campaign, I am not only
pleased by the success of our events,
but I'm also very much impressed by
how much Swarthmore students are
able to get done," board member
Mark Mai 'O9 said.
Mai had initial concerns that the
campaign plans would be too ambitious, but found that the group was
able to accomplish them. "Honestly,
I think that most of our members
had never done anything of this
magnitude before, so we were really
worried about things we may have
missed or overlooked in our planning," Mai said. "We over-planned;
we thought out the details and really
put 100 percent into the anti-malaria
and it paid off."
campaign

"I have been
astounded by how
supportive and

has been."
Mark Mai 'O9

The reaction from the faculty and
students was also very positive. "I
have been astounded by how supportive and enthusiastic everyone
has been," Mai said. "We have gotten
various e-mails from students, faculty and even alumni, telling us that
they thought we had a great campaign,

One staff member even walked
down to Sharpies where we were
tabling just to say that she thought
we had the most organized campaign, she had seen at Swarthmore.
With comments like that, it's hard
not to feel good about the massive
amounts of work everyone did."
Another board member, Erin
Ronhovde 'lO, also received positive
feedback from the events. "I think
the most impressive part of our campaign was just the amount of support
it got from people on campus,"

Ronhovde

said. "I did not receive

any negative feedback from students. In fact, many were very
enthusiastic about what we were

doing. I actually had quite a few people ask me while we were tabling
how they could get involved."
During the campaign, the Global
Health Forum raised about $3,500
and hopes for a total of $B,OOO to
$lO,OOO. In addition to the fundraising during the anti-malaria campaign, the Global Health Forum has
and will continue to reach out to

communities around Swarthmore.

Forum members are in the process

of sending letters out to different
departments and administrators as
well as asking students to ask their
families to contribute. They believe
the efforts will be successful
because, "it's so cheap to help," said
Dlugash. Several departments, as
well as the Alumni Council, have
already contributed to the funds.
The donations will be used to buy
bednets for children in Uganda. The
bednets will be purchased through
the organization Against Malaria,
which buys the proper kind of bednets and distributes them. The
Global Health Forum will also be
working with Life in Africa, a nongovernmental

organization,

decide with the help of community
leaders who will receive the bednets
in the Acholi Quarter in Kamapala,
Uganda. The Global Health Forum
hopes to be able to buy somewhere
between 1,000 and 1,600 bednets for
the poverty-stricken area. They will
also work to educate the recipients
on how to properly use the bednets
to ensure efficacy.
Dlugash is excited to send the
bednets out because he knows they
will help people in Uganda.
"Ultimately it's going to save lives. A
lot of kids die of malaria, and nets
decrease mortality by around 35 percent," Dlugash said. "It's a moral crisis
kids are dying and it's so easy
for us to get involved."
The Global Health Forum is also

looking towards the future. One of
their new goals is long-term sustainability of their efforts to improve the
state of malaria-afflicted Uganda.
The group wants to make sure that
people continue to be educated on
bednet use and ultimately get them
to the whole community in the
Acholi Quarter. "Hopefully, we will
send students to Uganda or do programs through the Lang Center,"
Dlugash said.

will be able to acquire grants and
other fundings to send Swarthmore

students there.
The Global

believes that the positive reception
the anti-malaria campaign has
received will make the continuity
of the program easier.
Originally, the Global Health
Forum did not intend to do the antimalaria campaign every year, but
now organizers plan to continue
the efforts. They also hope to
expand the program to other
schools, and may even try to form a
non-profit organization so the campaign can continue to grow and

lowering the prices of organic food. That [is
a] type of issue that we want the GAs to discuss with the people in their halls,"
Crampton said.
Besides
providing
an additional
resource to students on campus interested
in learning more about environmental
issues, Green Advisors would ideally like to
help students who want to start up or get
involved in sustainable initiatives in their
dorm or on the general campus.
"[Green Advisors] could be a resource
not only for talking about how to fix something, but also about getting it done,"
Crampton said. "We also want to be an
interactive presence on the hall. We're hoping to incorporate sort of enjoying green
spaces, more craft-oriented workshops.
We're hoping to sponsor a study break with

also threw a study break in early October in
two of the dorms, Wharton and Willets.
The study break provided students with
small sheets of information about sustainability and the opportunity to take a 'green
quiz.' "We were trying to do it in a fun way
that would get people informed," Richie
said.
At the same time, the Green Advisors
group is aware of the socioeconomic issues
behind the purchasing of more sustainable

dorms, what they think could be fixed, just
problems that they have," Crampton said.
Currently, the group has Green

been limited but has come from various

sources, including Housing Coordinator Liz

Additionally, the group received a

Richie said. "We really want everybody
from the campus to be involved. Even if it's
not a paid position, hopefully it will become
official as the paid positions of SAMs and
RAs."
Although the group is not yet fully established, there seems to be interest from both
the administration and the student body
about the valuable effects such an initiative
would have not only immediately on the
lifestyles of students on campus but on
their lifestyles after college. According to
Eldridge, the initiative will be a difficult
and complex one, but it is certainly a first
step towards broadening a greater sense of
fair and intelligent living.
"I can't help thinking about the more
that people in a place like this learn, the
more likely that we're going to get some
really bright people discovering some good
approaches to the issues," Eldridge said. "I
think people get turned on by the intellectual challenge as well as the social element
of the challenge, and resolve to use their
intellects for the greater good I think this
kind of approach is one thing that will help
...

them."

Eldridge also recognizes the need for
funds and suggests working towards an
evaluation of the group's capabilities that
can be aimed towards future improvements
"Like most new good ideas, it has to
compete for limited resources, which is not
to say that it can't be done
It might have
to be done gradually rather than wholesale
or overnight," Eldridge said.
...

"[Green Advisors] could be
a resource not only for
talking about how to fix
something, but also about
getting it done."
Elizabeth Crampton 'OB
Green Advisor
Along with the initiation of the
Sustainability GreenAdvisors group, there
is also a subcommittee group on sustainability, led by Carr Everbach of the engineering and environmental studies departments and Ralph Thayer from Facilities,
that will work towards addressing similar
issues of sustainability and environmental
awareness from the administrative perspective.
Currently, the subcommittee is in the
process of gaining members, both through
the faculty appointments process and the
Student Council appointments committee.
Additionally, the Student Council appointments committee is looking for students
that are both involved and not involved
with groups like Earthlust and the Good
Food Project.
Though the new committee and the.
Sustainability Green Advisors group are
not currently working together, Richie
looks forward to the possibility of collaborating on developing greater awareness of
sustainability issues on campus.
Since Sustainability Green Advisors is a
pilot group that is still looking for active
members to become Green Advisors in
their individual dorms, Crampton encourages those who are interested in spreading
sustainability awareness to get involved.

Xi, the Scientific
Research Society, has recognized
Swarthmore College for its
achievements in encouraging
research
and
undergraduate
membership in the society.
According to the mission statement on the Web site of
Swarthmore's Sigma Xi chapter,
"Sigma Xi is a national organization devoted to promoting scientific research. It has chapters at
numerous college and university
campuses, including
Swarthmore's."
Sigma

"The award shows
that scientific
research is a valued
endeavor at

Swarthmore
College."
Cheryl Grood
President of Sigma
Xi Chapter
The society presented the
award to the Swarthmore College
chapter of Sigma Xi through associate professor of biology Colin
Purrington, Swarthmore's official
delegate, at an annual international conference in Orlando,
Florida that lasted from Nov. 1-4.
Other institutions recognized by
Sigma Xi included M.1.T., the
Colleges,
Claremont
Brown
University, Carleton College and
Smith College.

According to Cheryl Grood,

President of Swarthmore's chapter of Sigma Xi and associate professor in the department of mathematics and statistics, Swarthmore has about 40 new members
of Sigma Xi this year.

"Everyone who does
research and writes
up anything or does a

Sigma Xi Member
"We hope to have a lot more
over the course of the year for students completing their honors
projects and the people applying
for membership belatedly for
research they did last summer,"
Grood said.
In addition to representing the
college, Purrington also served as
a poster judge at the conference,

tive and interesting ways and
voted for the next leader of Sigma
Xi in the Atlantic region.
Purrington's four days at the conference were packed from morning to evening with lectures,
exhibits, receptions and networking breaks.
"I enjoyed the talks and the
posters, but probably the biggest
part of the conference was the
conversations outside the events,"
Purrtngton said. "Networking
with other scientists is a lot of
fun, and you can't do it through email, so going to a conference is
very valuable."
Purrington said that both full
and associate members of Sigma
Xi attended, including professors,
independent scientists and students from mostly the MidAtlantic region.
Associate members, usually
students, are individuals who
have conducted or are conducting
research and who have submitted
a poster or project to the society.
Full members are those who have
"noteworthy
demonstrated
achievement as an original investigator in a field of pure or applied
science," according to the Sigma
Xi Web site.
Nathan La Porte 'OB was
inducted into the honor society in
September. "Everyone who does
research and writes up anything
or does a poster or something like
that can get inducted [as an associate member]," La Porte said.
While the Sigma Xi award does
not include any monetary or otherwise tangible benefits, it holds a
symbolic meaning for the scientific environment of the college.
"The award shows that scientific
research is a valued endeavor at
Swarthmore College," Grood said.
"It's most meaningful to me
because the reason we have so
many members each year is
because of all the students
involved in scientific research
and it's wonderful to be in an
environment where the students
have the curiosity and the intelligence and the perseverance to
carry out significant research."

The Animal Rights Coalition hosted a College
celebration for students in order to
bring awareness to animal rights violations committed by the meat industry and to encourage students to experience the vegetarian lifestyle, even if
only for one day.
The College Veg Pledge day was observed on
college campuses across the nation, and ARC
organized efforts within the Swarthmore commuVeg Pledge

nity.
As featured on the Students for Animal Rights
Web site, the pledge said: "As a university student,
I realize that I am a leader for my generation and
an example for society. I am concerned about the
inherent cruelty of consuming animals for food
and the impact meat has on global warming, the
environment, and my health. By signing my name,
I pledge to abstain from consuming meat on
November 13,2007, and commit myself to exploring
a more ethical diet in the future."
The Veg Pledge consists of students pledging to
not eat meat for a day, as an impetus to try out a
vegetarian diet.
Swarthmore's ARC also organized a gathering
in Shane Lounge at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 13,
with vegan sweets such as "Death By Chocolate
and Peanut Butter" vegan cheesecake, vegan
chocolate chip cookies and soy milk.

"The Veg Pledge is] a way of
helping people to open their
own minds to the idea of
following a vegetarian diet."
Claudia Seixas 'lO
President of ARC
The event in Shane Lounge also displayed several brochures and stickers encouraging students
to consider a vegetarian diet.
"People were attracted by the food I think and
then stuck around to look at the materials. There

was a pretty good crowd, I was happy about it,"
said ARC member Andrew Van Buren 10. After
the food disappeared, the ARC showed some amusing clips about animal rights. "We started off with
some vegetarian cooking videos, just to show some
good-looking vegetarian food," Van Buren said.
"That wasn't setting the mood, so we turned on
'The Meatrix,' which is a short cartoon about how
meat's produced, and 'Cows with Guns,' which is
this fun thing about cows with guns."

"People were attracted by the
food I think, and then stuck
around to look at
the materials."
Andrew Van Buren 'lO
ARC member
"I think an effective way to have people realize
that it's not really that hard to follow a vegetarian
diet, that just by giving up a few, not even giving
up food, but trying something new," ARC president Claudia Seixas 10 said. "So, it's a way of helping people to open their own minds to the idea of
following a vegetarian diet." Seixas also explained
that the Veg Pledge applied to those who were
already vegetarian as it was a chance for them to
try a vegan diet.
A number of other colleges are involved in this
effort, including Princeton, Harvard, Yale,
Stanford and other universities. "I think the numbers show how many people are behind this and
the idea of having a bunch of colleges doing it and
posting how many people they had is kind of competition to get more people and it's just a more
definitive system," Seixas said.
Both Seixas and Brian Tomasik 'O9 mentioned
that ARC would continue to host events promoting
vegetarianism in the future.
"We have planned to do more cooking demonstrations
the idea would be to cook together
...

with other people who haven't done vegetarian
cooking before to give them a chance to see that
it's not that hard," Tomasik said.

Black and Latino Male conference addresses issues in higher ed
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY RAMYA GOPAL
rgopall@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore hosted the seventh annual Black and
Latino Male Conference this weekend, drawing a record
130 students and faculty from 14 different colleges and universities. The conference was sponsored by Swarthmore's
Achieving Black and Latino Leaders ofExcellence and the

Consortium of High Achievement and Success.
ABLLE, a year-old group on campus, promotes a collective presence of blacks and Latinos at Swarthmore, while
CHAS functions as an external organization. Titled "The
New Danger: Black and Latino Men Facing Evolving
Challenges to their Scholarship and Community," the
three-day conference combined lectures by prominent
speakers with closed discussions about proactively dealing
with new issues facing black and Latino males in higher
education. Students, faculty and administrators from
small colleges and universities around the country, including Reed, Bates, Haverford and many more, attended the
conference. Each student left the conference with an
action plan to take back to his campus.
Swarthmore has been part of CHAS since the organization was instituted in 2000. Associate Dean for
Multicultural Affairs Daryl Smaw is a newly appointed
member to the CHAS board and was a principle organizer

of the conference.
This is Swarthmore's first year to hosting the Black and
Latino Males Conference. Swat students were inspired by
the conference last year held at Williams College. "The
theme for each conference is an opportunity to talk about
the challenges on campus a privileged white male liberal arts college," Smaw said. "They understand they are not
alone, that there are other black and Latino students
across the country. They learn how to negotiate campus
community; not just to survive but to thrive."
"Swarthmore has a reputation for planning good conferences," Smaw said, referencing past success such as the
Black Box Conference. "We're known to be intellectually
stimulating and well organized. People go away from [the
...

conferences] with good insight."
As an organizer, Smaw felt rewarded "hearing students
talk about how helpful the conference was to reflect about
themselves, what they can do to further opportunities for
black and Latinos on their campus."
The primary purpose of the conference was to "bring
together the males from many different small liberal arts
colleges," ABLLE founder Keith Benjamin 'O9 said. When
all the students assembled together for the first time on
Friday, Rafael Zapata, Assistant Dean and Director of the
Intercultural Center, described the gathering as "unique."

"The fact that we are in a room

together from

different

colleges and universities is an empowering image," Zapata
said, adding that the recollection still made "his hair stand
on end" in a positive way. Bringing Latino and black males
together gave students a safe space to discuss issues that
apply specifically to them and are not often confronted,
according to Zapata.
The Annual Black and Latino Male Conference began
in 2000 through CHAS, based out of Trinity College. "The
conference
at Swarthmore was designed to promote
leadership among a population that is often perceived as
facing many challenges to

unwavering commitment on a world stage. The future is in
us, in good hands," Darryl Smaw said.
Dr. Luis Ricardo Fraga, Associate Vice Provost for
Faculty Advancement and political science professor at
the University of Washington, was the featured keynote
speaker on Saturday morning. His speech addressed the
future issues of black and Latino students, given that
many individuals have already achieved a level of success
by attending prominent institutions of higher education.

[it was] nice that we all
had the chance to talk about it."
Another speaker on Saturday, Maurice Wallace, associate professor of English and African and African
American Studies at Duke University, addressed similar
issues, according to Assistant Dean and Director of the
Black Cultural Center Tim Sams. "He talked about black
masculinity and in particular, how it could lead to a notion
of oneself that
isn't conducive to their advancement
through life. There is a potential for intellectual matters to
be characterized as not the most male thing to do. If that is
a part of how you construct notions of masculinity it is
dangerous, in terms of one's effort to be a scholar," Sams
said.
The smaller discussion sessions culminated into an
"active-planning" session where students from each college developed a plan to address needs on their campus.
"The conference focused on active planning. Each school
had an opportunity with a plan to present it to the other
brother," ABLLE member Cory Benjamin 'lO said.
Several Skidmore students realized their diversity
groups were missing academic support. We're a social
group and don't have as much academic support," firstyear Frank Cabrera said.
The action plans helped students take away tangible
ideas to improve their campuses.
The heart of the conference represented ABLLE's
ideals, concerning the discussion of issues as well as how
to proactively deal with such issues. "Most diversity
groups are focused on creating a safe space, where people
can feel supported and can come for help," Keith Benjamin
said. "We wantto layout issues, more specific to Black and
Latino males and together figure out how we will deal with
them."
While the conference inspired many students and participants and seemed to be an indicator of progress, Sams
had a conflicted viewpoint.
"I liked the active bringing of black and Latino men
together to have them focus on common experiences, challenges and solutions," Sams said.
However, Sams felt that the conference needed to have
more faculty participation. "A lot of the challenges that
really matter to these students occur and can be dealt with
in the classroom with higher engagement from faculty. All
the rhetoric and inspiring will be futile if we're not able to
change the realities."
Overall, organizers were satisfied with the outcome of
the conference's aims. "This year's conference was outstanding, and Dean Smaw and the students of ABBLE did
an outstanding job of organizing an agenda that engaged
and enlightened the conference participants," Kassahun
said. "There will likely be a lot of good work on many campuses that grows out of the discussions and presentations
...

...

"

Fraga argued that the new generation of black and

Latino males faced increasing responsibility in the future.
"Life now is more complex," Fraga said. Fraga said that
while individual success was a step in the right direction,

students needed to remember their responsibilities to
their community.
Serving the interests of the community was the focal
point of the smaller breakout sessions on Saturday. In several different "conversation circles," students discussed a
variety of issues regarding challenging and overcoming
stereotypes, and also discussed building solidarity
amongst blacks and Latinos on college campuses.
"We realized that the issues on our campus are found
everywhere else," Skidmore University first-year
Daeshawn Hall said.
Other events on Saturday explored representations and
notions of masculinity in black and Latino communities.
One event screened the movie "Hip Hop: Behind Beats and
Rhymes," which was followed by an open discussion with
a panel of speakers that included Tariq Trotter of The
Roots. Zapata said the movie "talks about sexism, homophobia, cultural reform as a powerful way to examine this
issue. The panel was a nice combination of people to talk
critically, constructively around these issues."
The discussions of masculinity seeped into some of the
conversation circles. "It was interesting when we got into
groups with our own school, and got to discuss and apply
it to our situation," Gabriel Ramirez 10 said. "Looking at
problems on our campus made me realize what a huge
problem [there is] between black and Hispanic men and
[in] general how women act at the campus, really women

Preventive measures taken towards recent thefts

In response to the recent thefts that have been occurring in McCabe and in other locations around campus,
there have been multiple efforts to ameliorate the situation, including informative posters, increased Public
Safety patrols and discussion of making various security
devices such as lockers and lock down cables available to
the students.

Services Supervisor
When the thefts were first reported, Public
Safety took measures to look over the security
camera recordings, but were not able to find anything
substantial. "We have recordings and have examined
them, but it's very time consuming and requires a lot of
man-power, which is a limited resource," Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave said. "Security cameras
are most helpful in cases in which a specific time frame
is provided, but in the cases so far, it hasn't proved so
helpful."
In addition, according to Redgrave, Public Safety has
been concentrating some of their resources to pay closer
attention to particular parts of campus such as McCabe.

Now, Public Safety officers routinely patrol the library.
"Thefts of opportunity are the most prevalent crime on
any college campus, including our own," Redgrave said,
adding that it was fortunate that none of the cases

involved violence or forced theft.
Redgrave also said that the Swarthmore Borough
Police Department was notified of these events and had
offered to provide help.
For students, the recent series of events served as a
reason to raise more awareness about campus security,
specifically concerning personal belongings.

"They have to be more aware now, now that signs
have been put up and e-mails sent out. I think more people will lock their computers or make sure someone is
watching them when they go somewhere," student
McCabe worker Joel Tolliver 'lO said.
There has also been continued discussion about the
possibility of providing access to various equipment and
security devices on campus, such as lockers and lock
down cables.
"We are currently pricing lockers," Associate Vice
President for Facilities Stu Hain said in an e-mail. "We
are also looking for the best device to provide the possibility of locking computers to desks. I expect us to provide both. I am not yet sure how long it will take."
In addition, Facilities has been looking into attaching
anchor plates to the carrels throughout the library in
order to secure laptops as an additional security device.
Access & Lending Services Supervisor Alison
Masterpasqua said, "We are planning to have lock down
cables that people will be able to check out, and also to
put anchor plates on the carrels so that people can use
them to lock down their computers to."
Masterpasqua added that it is easy to be lax, but that
recently she has seen more students being aware and
careful.
"It's easy to feel safe here because it's a small
community and there's not much contact with the

Theft prevention strategies
Never leave personal belongings unattended.
Ask a friend, or another person to look over
your belongings if you are going to leave the area
temporarily, even if it is just to go to the restroom or
to search for a book.
Use lockdown cables. Have all equiprment and
propoerty locked down with an approved lock-down
device. Cables are available for purchase at the college book store.
Promptly report individuals acting suspiciously by calling Public Safety Ext. 8333. The
Department of Public Safety works hard to keep you
and your proerty safe and secure but we can't be
everywhere at once.
If possible do not carry valuables such as excessive cash, credit cards, etc. with you especially if it
would be unlikely that you would need to use them.
Something additional that you can do: Identify
your property by distinctive markings and engrave
your drivers license number and the abbreviation
for the state of issue on the top or front side. To borrow an engraver contact Public Safety at Ext. 8281.

people shouldn't be paranoid, but just use a little common sense," Katherine Sauvain 'O9 said. "I think computers are the big issue, so having cables available at the

Invited to speak at the college by the
Swarthmore Organization for Israel, Dr.
Michael Oren, a recipient of numerous accolades, presented a lecture called "Power,
Faith and Fantasy: America in the Middle

Among other distinctions, Oren is a noted

"Our goal in sponsoring Oren's lecture
was to provide a historical context within
which students can develop informed opinions regarding American involvement in
the Middle East," said SOFI member and
event organizer, Aaron Brecher 10 in an email. "To understand the U.S.-Israel relationship, as well as current events in Iraq,
Iran and elsewhere, one must examine over
230 years of America's strategic, civic, religious and cultural interests that extend far

beyond oil and Christian and Jewish
Zionism."

the common notion that
U.S. involvement in the Middle East began
after WWII, Oren argued that the United
States has been tied to the Middle East since
its foundation, and that U.S. perceptions of
the region have been largely informed
through the three lenses ofpower, faith and
fantasy. "My purpose is to share my
Challenging

immense, enduring fascination of this legacy," Oren said.
Beginning with the Barbary Wars
against the pirates of Tripoli, Oren defined
U.S. power as the "pursuit and defense of the
United States' vital interests in the Middle
East." In response to the "existential threat"
from the Barbary pirates, the United States
formed its navy, and, Oren said, the divided
states were forced to coalesce in order to
increase their power.
At the time, the conflict with the pirates
caused debate at the Constitutional
Convention between different groups (primarily New Englanders and Southerners)
who respectively believed in military confrontation and continued conciliation with
the Barbary states. Each group saw the construction of a strong central government as
holding differing implications for their individual policy aims.

Moreover, Oren said that faith, both religious and civic, also informed U.S. actions in
the Middle East. According to Oren, the
Puritans appropriated the idea of a prom-

ised land from the Old Testament and considered America to be a promised land of
sorts. Furthermore, the founding fathers
identified with biblical values, and supported Restorationism.
Oren also discussed how much of the U.S.
perception of and approach to the Middle
East is informed by fantasy and myth, much
of which stems from the stories of "One
Thousand and One Arabian Nights." In the
latter half of the 19th century, Americans
traveled extensively to the Middle East with
the tome under their arms and an image of

the region embedded in their minds, only to

arrive and be disappointed with reality.
According to Oren, Hollywood and the

media "exoticizes and eroticizes the Middle
East."

The hardest task, says Oren, is removing
myth from reality and disengaging from the
misconceptions that the U.S. has with regard
to the Middle East as well as realizing that
power alone can't achieve all of America's
goals. He concluded his lecture with a
metaphor used by George McClellan:

Americans view the Middle East as a tarnished mirror that, with a bit of polishing,
can be made to resemble the U.S. This view,
Oren said, is detrimental both to
U.S.-Middle East relations and to fostering a
deep understanding of the region.
Despite a last-minute change in time and
location, Oren's lecture proved exceedingly
popular with the Swarthmore community,
with over a hundred students, teachers, faculty and community members attending,
according to Brecher. Audience members
found Oren engaging and knowledgeable.
"The historical references in relation to
Middle Eastern affairs were all new to me
because they hadn't been emphasized when
I was learning about history," Syeda Tasnim
'OB said. "It was worth going to because he
provided a different perspective for me, and
his argument and approach to the issue and
to understanding this issue was novel."
"I personally think he spoke very well,
and actually a little bit surprised he didn't
call America out on more, because we're

Monday, which was well attended by students, faculty and community members alike.

tory, I'm surprised that more of them
weren't brought to light and looked down
upon for their general stupidity," SOFI member Alexander Warso 11 said.
"Michael Oren is obviously a very skilled
speaker. His presentation was very strong
and I was engaged regardless of the fact that
I do not agree with him on many points,"
Ruth McDonough 'OB said in an e-mail.
"What struck me as particularly skillful was
the presentation of historical facts that cannot be contested in language that communicated Oren's personal bias."

After the lecture, members of the audience were invited to ask questions and have
their copies of his new book, which shares
the lecture's title, signed.
According to attendee Ronni Sadovsky
'OB, during the Q&A session, an audience
member asked Oren about Israel-Iran relations. "He
took [the discussion] to nuclear
war between Israel and Iran, saying that
nuclear war between Iran and Israel would
destroy Israel. I feel like what he was trying
to do [was] portray Israel as the underdog,"
Sadovsky said. "I think that in portraying
Israel as the underdog he was pushing us to
identify with and root for Israel, because
...

everyone loves the underdog. I personally
am very pro-Israel, and I consider myself a
Zionist, but I'm really wary of the way that
people can use emotion and identification to
manipulate my focus when telling me about
the Middle East," she said.
Afterwards, according to Warso, SOFI
members who were key organizers of the
event and a few members of the Jewish community around Swarthmore joined Oren for
a private dinner. "SOFI members, and I
especially, were very pleased with the caliber of students' questions and the event's
turnout," Brecher said in an e-mail.
Brecher, who interned at the Shalem
Center in Israel, said that he had recommended Oren as a potential speaker. "Since
then, several SOFI members have heard
Oren speak in Israel and became interested
in inviting him to Swarthmore," Brecher
said. "I myself have read both of Oren's bestsellers and dozens of his articles, and
jumped at the opportunity to invite a historian of his caliber to Swarthmore.
Fortunately, Oren is teaching at Yale this
semester, and SOFI was able to add
Swarthmore to Oren's itinerary on his

recent trip to Philadelphia."

AN INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL OREN
The Phoenix's Mary Prager
sat down to interview Michael
Oren, visiting professor of history at Harvard and Yale and
author of several best-selling
books on the Middle East, after
his lecture on Monday.
Now how do you think this

[approach to Middle Eastern policy based on faith and power]
affects the perceptions that people
in the Middle East have of people

in the United States?
Sometimes we simply miff
Middle Easterners, other times it
makes us reprehensible, and
because Middle Easterners will
see America supporting Israel or
supporting corrupt Arab monarchies or leaderships in Saudi
Arabia and that generates resentment.
I think the most controversial thing that I say in my
book, is that on balance, over the
course of 230 years, Americans
have done vastly more good, have
...

10

brought vastly more good than
harm to the Middle East. You'll
have a hard time convincing

Middle Easterners of that. But
again, I'm saying this as a historian, not as a policy advocate, and
now I look across this legacy, the
length of the legacy, and I see
vastly more good than harm.
All right, another completely
different topic. Which of the 2008
candidates do you think has the
most viable policy for the Middle
East?
I think that on Arab-Israeli
issues, Giuliani is very much
distinguished from the others
because he has actually taken
on a Middle East policy team, a
foreign policy team, which is
very skeptical about the possibility for the emergence of a
two-state, or an attainment of a
two-state

solution,

mostly

because the Palestinians are
incapable of it, and they're
developing different models for

proceeding in the Arab-Israeli
dimension. What I find, generally, Mary, is that presidential
candidates are unwilling to
speak candidly about America's
Middle East involvement today,
because it's too unpalatable to
an American audience in an elecThat's not the time

for candor and creativity. Alas.
This will be the final question,
but what has been the most important experiencefor you in learning
about the MiddleEast, and in your
...

studies? Or what have been the

most important experiences?

If I told you, you wouldn't
believe me
I'll tell you one
story. This is a story.... But about
15 years ago, when I was still
serving as a paratrooper, in the
reserves, I was doing some
reserve duty in the West Bank
and I was leading a patrol, one
jeep, through an Arab village that
was rather notorious for its association with Hamas.
(A)ll of a

sudden the jeep broke down
and within seconds, we were surrounded by hundreds of villagers.
I figured we, that even with
myself and two other soldiers,
with thirty-two bullets a clip, we
had about four seconds to live,
and I actually turned to the guy
next to me and we just about said
our goodbyes to one other. And
for a moment, everyone was
frozen, three of us and about
three hundred villagers, and then
a man came forward with tea on a
tray and offers us tea. The minute
we sipped the tea, all the villagers
crowded around us, offering their
assistance in getting the jeep
moving again, and we broke out
the Orations for the candy for the
kids, and everybody was buddies.
Until another Israeli army vehicle came along and got us out.
Now what did this teach me about
the Middle East?
First of all, it taught me that

can't teach you about cultures. It

taught me that the question of

complex one, and a paramount

instructive moment, and I think

thatfrom thatpoint on, I began to
look at the Middle East in sort of
a different eye. ...What that incident taught me was to forget all of
my assumptions, all of my
Western assumptions, and start
from scratch. And that's why I
love that George McClellan line,
that's what he was saying, what
he was saying in 1872 forget
your assumptions and start from
scratch. If Americans had gone
into Iraq understanding, how the
society, how the Iraqi society was
constituted, what was involved in
the creation of Iraq, how Iraq was
created, how it was maintained,
they might have thought twice
about it.

Drama Board breathes new life into the Shakespeare masterpiece with a Moroccan twist
the audience, placing the characters in a
"believable context."
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" is not
only thematically adventurous. Through an
extensive set and elaborate lighting, the production fully utilizes the expansive LPAC
Mainstage. According to Flamm, the pro-

duction "tries to do things that Swarthmore
hasn't done or seen before." For example,
the thrust stage, which borders on the audience seating, has not been recently used on
the Mainstage. According to Flamm 'O9, the
thrust stage creates a stronger "connection
between the audience and actors."
Putting together the show has been challenging in many ways. According to stage
manager Farah Hussain 'O9, one of the
largest problems has been getting "sizeable
numbers of Swarthmore students" into the
same room at the same time for rehearsals.
Will Treece 'll, who plays Flute and Cobweb,
admitted that the production has been "a
bigger time commitment" than expected
with intensive character work.
Other cast members pointed out the dif-

ficulties of understanding their characters.

guaranteed happy ending. This leads to a
lack of investment in the characters and,

ultimately, dissatisfaction. Coleman said

she has "raised the play's stakes," creating a
world in which the audience genuinely feels
both the sadness arid jdy of the characters.
To this end, the play has been "re-located" to Morocco, where, according to
Coleman, "the patriarchy goes unquestioned, social mobility is limited and magic
is an element of the cultural heritage."
Coleman chose this setting not as "a commentary on [the] state [Morocco], but rather
because it presents the same set of stakes
and expectations that Shakespeare establishes in 'Midsummer.'" The world of "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" is one in which
escape from the domineering patriarchy is
both necessary and dangerous.
Despite the emphasis on darker themes,
the play remains very much a comedy.
"This is a fun, joyful play, [which] takes
pleasure in life and self-discovery," Coleman
said. Judy Browngoehl 'O9, who plays
Hermia, added that the play is filled with "a

Often, these cases will sit for years before

One of Engebretson's most rewarding
yet difficult experiences involved the
interviews she conducted with the

Afghans.

"There was a mother of five whose husband was killed by the Taliban and she
was trying to get her family refugee status
in India unsuccessfully. I interviewed her
about three times and getting to know the
family was really valuable and extraordinarily frustrating because her case had
gone nowhere," Engebretson said. "Her

son has been deported since I left. It was
aggravating and upsetting to feel that I
wasn't able to accomplish that much to

Being in a foreign country also meant a
huge culture shock. For Engebretson, who
had never lived in a city before, New Delhi
was a drastic change. It was not only challenging to live there because of the heat
and her limited Punjabi, but it was also an
adjustment to "being so obviously foreign

went and people asking questions about

an object of curiosity to a lot of people."

Engebretson from returning to India, She

BY SARAH BRICAULT

sbricaul@swarthmore.edu

In the "Networks and Intersections" exhibit in the List
Gallery, you can find everything from organic-looking
structures made of pages of a phonebook to paintings that
depict the beauty of the plastic construction fence. The
works of artists Esme Thompson, Elizabeth Duffy, Duncan
Johnson and Louise Hamlin are on display in this exhibit.
Each artist has a dramatically different style, but, according to the gallery's press release, their pieces all "share an
underlying emphasis on pattern, woven grids and linear
webs." In essence, this aptly named exhibit contains the
work of artists whose work challenges the distinctions
between the manmade and the natural and explores the

display until Saturday, Dec. 15, and it will be open from 12
p.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday.
Esme Thompson's paintings are interesting combinations of vivid, organic patterns and pictures, all of which
look as though they could be found in a biology textbook. I
kept expecting to see mitochondria or nuclei somewhere in
her paintings. There is too much order, too much precision
imposed upon the elements of her creations for them to
truly appear as biological drawings, but they definitely
have an organic feel to them. Thompson's paintings contain
natural patterns, full of curved, flowing lines, separated by
straight lines and arranged in rows and columns. Her work
explores the intersection between the order that man
imposes upon his surroundings and the order that has
come to exist naturally.

Duffy uses simple materials and a simple style to form her
incredibly intricate pieces of art; art whose complexity you
can best appreciate first-hand.
Where Duffy's art reminds us of our childhood crafts,
Duncan Johnson's sculptures bring us back to those days of
wooden blocks, Legos and secret forts in the forest. His
pieces capture the intersection between manmade structure and natural being. One of Johnson's pieces is like no
structure man has ever created. Its seemingly random
nature evokes the image of a tree or a bush, but its deliberate right angles give it the distinct air of a manmade con-

She forgoes typical mediums for the
childhood favorites of wax paper,
straws and even the pages of a
telephone book to create her art.
Johnson's other sculptures are likewise ambiguous, calling forth the imagination of viewers to determine what they
could be. Could it represent a structure that will be built in
the future? Could it be a species of tree thathas yet to be discovered? Johnson's structures, created from wood and pigment, all appeal to the imagination with their natural beauty and manmade precision.
Plastic fences and nets have become important to our
society and can be seen in many places. However, they are
usually perceived as ugly, unwanted additions to the natural scene. Louise Hamlin's art, on the other hand, explores
the beauty of the relationship between these manmade nets
and fences and their natural surroundings. Hamlin draws
our attention to the way the vibrant colors of a construction
fence find a somber contrast in the soft gray and blue hues
of nearby stones. She shows us how the sunlight creates
networks of shadowed lines that stretch and curve upon the
or smooth sides of various rocks. In essence,
her art depicts the intersection between the man-made and

rough edges

the natural and shows us the beauty of such a relationship.
This display is a wonderfully unique exhibition that
explores the ambiguities of distinctions that we often take

to be concrete and definite.

Taking a refreshingly non-academic tour of the PMA
RORY SYKES

Visually Stimulating
The Philadelphia Museum ofArt offers a
variety of guided tours ranging from the
general (highlights from the entire museum)
to the specific ("Van Gogh and color").
Having never gone on a tour before, and
curious about experiencing the works as
mediated by an "expert," I found myself tagging along on the tour of the 19th century
galleries.
Before it even started, things seemed a
little rough. Besides me, there were only
two other people in attendance, a pair of
older women who claimed to be regulars of

the museum but had never gone on this particular tour. When our guide arrived, he
came up to me and asked if I was waiting for
his tour. I said yes, and his response was,
"My condolences." Hmm.
Berthold is an elderly man with a stooped
back and bowed legs whose houndstooth
jacket I secretly coveted. He prefaced his
tour with the caveat that he didn't have a set
script, but because of that he encouraged us
to stop him if and when something caught
our eye. We set off at a quick pace and from
that moment on, he continued to project a
rushed air, constantly commenting on how
little time we had and how we needed to

14

keep moving. It became apparent that for
Berthold, this tour was a kind of "greatest

hits" of the 19th century, and that as his
audience we deserved to see as much as we
could in the one hour we had together. The
tour as a whole was scattered and initially
hard for me to get into. With so little time
spent on any individual painting and with
most of his commentary
excluding the
consisting of
occasional technical note
declarative statements like, "This one is
really interesting" or simply a verbalization
of who the artist was and when it was painted, it was quite different from the academic
lectures I'm used to receiving.

His familiarity and comfort
with the paintings made the
whole tour seem as though
he was taking us around
his house...
Yet as we were shuttled along from one
room to the next, I began to appreciate the
tour for what it was really about: Berthold's
own excitement and proprietary pride in the
PMA's collection.While not always the most
informative of commentators, Berthold
came off as genuinely enthusiastic when

talking about the works. He was constantly
telling us to get closer, to look closer, though
I have to admit that he himself got a little too

close for my own comfort

Berthold had a

tendency to gesticulate wildly, with his fingers almost brushing the surface of the canvas, to the point where I was convinced the
guards were going to intervene (they never
did).
His familiarity and comfort with the
paintings made the whole tour seem as
though he was taking us around his house,
showing off his favorite trinkets. Some ofthe
comments he made were also wonderfully
for examcharming in their informality
ple, he referred to Matisse's wife as "Mrs.
Potato Head" (and honestly, in that particular portrait she did look strikingly similar to
Rumer Willis).
His personal tastes came through quite
clearly when one of the women asked him to
speak about Leon Frederic's "Four Seasons"
series. Berthold hesitated a moment, said
that the artist had a "particular style" and
that they were "good at being what they
we were off to see
are," and that was that
another painting that would at least merit

the word "interesting."
The tour ended in front of Cezanne's
"The Large Bathers." Having read and dis-

cussed this work in detail before
particularly in regards to the representation of gender I was curious to hear Berthold's take.

After an hour of

November 15, 2007

hustling

that was never

quite restful even when we were stopped in
front of a painting, Berthold made his
strongest statement of the tour when he
stood entirely still and just stared up at the
painting. Remaining silent for several long
moments, his last words were simple yet
true: "Now this is a masterpiece."

nothing conventionally attractive about the model in this
advertisement, certainly nothing
that would attract a straight male
audience the way that women

represented in men's magazines
Flipping through a March 1924
issue of "Today's Housewife" that
I recently received as a gift, I was
amused by how archaic most of
the topics were.
One article
advised that if young girls
watched the movement of their
jaws as they chewed gum in front
of a mirror, they would be
reminded of a "patient cow" and
be convinced never to chew gum
in public again. Another passage
cautioned that bare knees (in
public conveyances!) are inexcusable. And then I came across an
ad that proclaimed: "Stout
women, you too can dress as fashionably as your slender sister."
Although historical currents
since that 1924 advertisement

have caused the link between
slender and fashion-forward to

waver at times, the association is
still a deeply entrenched idea.
Fast-forward 82 years from the
publication of that magazine to
2006, when Uruguay Fashion

died of a heart attack caused by
anorexia nervosa after collapsing
on the runway. A few weeks
later, the regional government of Madrid issued an
order demanding that models for Madrid Fashion

So what is behind this drive
towards the ultra-thin figure?
One factor is the emphasis in
recent years on big volume and
size in clothing and accessories,
which make the body seem even
slimmer by comparison. In a
world that loves to play with
opposites, it becomes almost formulaic that oversized designs

should accompany an undersized
frame. One reassuring antidote to
this phenomenon is the way the

sartorial landscape seems to be
retreating from the oversized,
presenting clothes that are more
restrained and controlled.
Another factor is that the

ideal body type for women in
high fashion has moved away
from catering to a conventionally
male gaze.

Director Ham Tran talks with members of SAO after screening his film

"Journey From the Fall."

'Journey' sheds new light on war
BY ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

From "Deer Hunter" to "Apocalypse Now" to
"Good Morning, Vietnam," American cinema certainly doesn't starve for depictions of the Vietnam War.
Rarely, however, has film looked at the war through
the eyes of the Vietnamese and even more rarely has
film focused on what happened after the fall of Saigon.
This past Thursday, the Swarthmore Asian
Organization invited director Ham Tran to

Swarthmore to show and discuss his recent film
"Journey from the Fall," which finally brings to
screen the tragedy that befell all too many
Vietnamese families once the war ended. Far from
being just a successful film, "Journey from the Fall"
is also an important effort to expose a history all but
neglected in the U.S. and deliberately repressed in

Vietnam. Tran said, "I wanted to make the film,

because...the rest of the world doesn't really know
about this, and all of Vietnam is not told this story."
Although "Journey from the Fall" is a fictional
film about a South Vietnamese military officer, Long,
who is imprisoned in a reeducation camp while his
family attempts to escape the country by boat, the
family's story is, according to Tran, the story of
"seven out of 10 Vietnamese-Americans."
After the communist forces took Saigon, several
hundred thousand officials of the former Republic of
Vietnam were sent to reeducation camps and would
only be released once they were deemed fit for society. We see Long at several points through his six-year
internment from when he is first captured and told,
"You sided with the American imperialists, waged
war against the revolutionaries. You're a traitor to
your country, to your own people," to years later
when he and his fellow prisoners are little more than
skeletons wearing the remnants of sandbags, scavenging for crickets to eat and risking death to escape
from the camp. The communist slogan "Nothing is
more precious than freedom" ironically hangs above
the camp, as the prisoners are forced to do hard labor

and even to clear the surrounding minefields.
"Journey" also dramatizes the story of the "boat
people," the millions of Vietnamese who tried to flee
from the country as stowaways in small brigs, most of
whom were unsuccessful. We are taken through the
hellish experience of Long's grandmother, wife Mai
and son Lai as they face suffocation in the boat's hull,
capture by Vietnamese coast guards and attack from
Thai pirates.
These two stories are intercut in a fragmented blur
with hardly a single scene logically progressing to the
next. Tran explained his rationale for having the film
proceed with little regard to chronology. "I'm here,
but I stillremember vividly being in the refugee camp
when I was eight," Tran said. "We live multiple lives,
multiple timelines." Tran added that the film's convo-

luted structure was meant to "emphasize the idea of
displacement...a lot of people, when they were in
prison, they had no idea what happened to their family...lt's chaos." Through the course of film, Long and
his family hear so many speculations about each
other's fate that nothing is certain, and the importance of hope gains prominence in their lives. The
film largely utilizes a myopic depth of field which

November 15, 2007

impresses the lack of comfort and stability of its dis-

placed characters.

The second half of the film abruptly shifts to
Orange County, California, but is hardly a reprieve
from the film's previous horrors. Even as Mai, Lai
and his grandmother are out ofreach ofphysical danger, the state of their family, nationality and very
identity remain in ruins. Lai is a pariah at school, an
environment wholly alien from the comforts of his
home. He is soon suspended, and the school principal
tells him, "I don't get you kids. You're all immigrants.
You leave your home country because of war, and
then you come here and you start to pick fights," a
scene that Tran says was drawn from firsthand experience. Meanwhile, Mai finds herself so emotionally
drained and devoid of hope that she becomes absent
as a mother to Lai. Here, it is clear that Tran's attention is equally on how Vietnamese-Americans have
been affected emotionally and psychologically by
these geopolitical forces beyond their control. Among
other things, the film becomes an infuriating defense
ofAmerican immigrants. Intercultural Center intern
Andrea Pien 'OB, commenting on the film's complex
transnational origins, said, "SAO being affiliated with
[this event] is being supportive of different parts of
the Asian community ... This movie transcends—it's
international and American. So it redefines what
Vietnamese is it speaks to a broader base."
Though "Journey" has received near unanimous
praise, its few detractors have claimed that Tran sensationalizes what happened to the "boat people" and
the victims of the reeducation camps with his slick
film school aesthetic and perhaps at times tooWestern musical score. But Tran's unflinching and
unsentimental epilogue, a far cry from a happy ending, suggests that Tran's true intent is not to promote
any particular ideology but to give face to his characters and their experiences. If anything, "Journey
from the Fall" benefits heavily from the authenticity
and personal investment that its mostly VietnameseAmerican cast and crew bring. Tram said, "this is
pretty much beat-by-beat the story of my executive
producer...We had 12 investors total for this film, half
of whom.. .were boat people or sons or daughters of
reeducation camp prisoners." Tran also cast almost
all non-actors, many of whom had experiences similar
to their characters. In his role as a communist official,
one man recited the same speech he had heard regularly during his three years in a reeducation camp.
Tran said, "For them, I think it was cathartic."
"Journey" is officially banned in Vietnam, but
pirated versions of the film have made their way into
the country. Tran received an e-mail from students at
the University of Ho Chi Minn City, who had seen the
film. According to Tran, the students thanked him for
making the film, saying, "We didn't know about the
re-education camps. We were taught that boat people
were traitors to the country. We always thought that
they were just leaving, that they were thought of taking the easy way out."
That is the kind of change that Tran hopes to produce by distributing his film. "It's been so repressed
in our culture and in the Vietnamese-American community," Tran said. "One thing that I've discovered is
that people haven't said anything about it, but they
want to talk. They just need a context."

Op-Ed Responses

This
column
serves as a response
to the op-ed and two
letters that the

response to my precolumn,
vious

"Fundamentalism
can leave little room
for discussion."
Instead of going
through each of the
pieces one-by-one, I
will respond to

JULIAN CHENDER

them as a whole.
To begin with, I
agree that I, in some
ways, mischaracter-

ized
the
Swarthmore
Christian
Fellowship, and for
this I apologize. I mistakenly suggested that the SCF composed the religious right at Swarthmore. This is incorrect.
Rather, a number of members of Swarthmore's religious
right attend SCF events. Students of diverse backgrounds
and beliefs make up the group those of the religious right
make up part of this diverse group.
It is important to note that while SCF is made up of great
diversity in beliefs, the group as a whole professes a distinct
belief, one that is fundamentalist. The SCF website declares
that there is only one true God and that Jesus Christ alone
is the path to salvation. I am not interested in the "image of
indoctrinated Republicans that do not care about the environment, do not care about the poor and are terrified of the
'gay agenda,'" which the term fundamentalism may evoke.
The introductory sentence of my previous column was for
this reason ill-chosen. Rather, I am interested in belief. In
this sense, fundamentalism is a strict and literal adherence
to certain beliefs. Religious fundamentalism simply means
that "I am right and you are wrong" in the religious arena.
SCF's belief in the one true God and the one true path to salvation falls under the fundamentalist heading.

The Spiritual Scene

I am not interested in the "image of
indoctrinated Republicans that do
not care about... the p00r"... Rather,
I am interested in belief.
I am sorry that some people saw me as taking the conversation I recounted in my previous column out of context.
In my examination of fundamentalist belief, this conversation seemed quite appropriate. The girl with whom I talked
professed fundamentalist beliefs, specifically that all nonChristians go to hell. I then used this to question belief in
general, not just Christian belief. ("So many religions
include, even if they are not based upon, beliefs
those

creeds passed down from generation to generation that are
accepted unquestioningly, and which hold no experiential
basis.")

I also did not purport that Christians on this campus
or anywhere
do not get into ethical debates, another misconception that arose last week. In fact, I did not once mention ethics in my column. Furthermore, I do not believe
"that refusing to believe anything is the only way to go to
heaven." In the future, I hope that everyone feels free to talk
with me about my views (my emailaddress is at the bottom
ofall my columns), as this might help clear up what I do and
do not believe.
In my previous column, I did not claim that Christianity
is
unquestioningly"; rather, I notedthat many religions include, if not are based on, beliefs, which I define as
"those creeds passed down from generation to generation
that are accepted unquestioningly, and which hold no experiential basis." This is not the same as religion being accepted unquestioningly.
It seems that people saw my column as an attack on
Christianity, which it was not. My intent was not malicious.
Instead, I aimed to question fundamentalist dogma and
belief in general, and I used my encounter with the girl from
SCF as an example with which to do this.

issued commands. Putting aside the issue of power relations in the
bathroom, what must be done? In ancient Athens, neutrality was a crime and in American politics, the irresolute meet with failure. We argue the opposite: that the
wise man remains apathetic.
We are confronted by an overwhelming mob of
demands: build an antiracist identity, oppose war, conserve natural resources, defend workers, support
immigrants, read real old prospectors, the list goes on.
Shall we exhaust our youth in righteous anger, venting
fire and fury at the evil stalking the Earth? No.
Consider the warlord. No man could order war, with its
consequent loss of life and resources, without the spurs
of passion deep in his side; few could observe destruction without surrendering to those spurs. We urge you
to be those few. Insensible to pain and calm in the face
of calamity. Move slowly, with deliberate thought and
consider carefully before making lasting commitments.
In this way, what we possess will not be squandered.
Many of today's demands will be forgotten tomorrow,
but which is hard to judge. Time will be our faithful

ally in all things
exhausting our frenetic foes and
revealing the right path. A man who lives thusly at
least minimizes his own suffering.
What crime is committed today, which has no precedent? None we say. Can the modern performance of
ancient deeds damn? Our heritage we will not condemn; we are the culmination of our ancestors. It is

Perhaps

some

day a synthetic culture may be manufactured
as
today there is work on robotic eyes but until then we
prefer a diabolic vision to none. Even ignoring the
absurdity of creating a discontinuity with history there
remains the difficulty of effecting a first occurrence.
Indubitably all that is has an ur-instantiation, but by
far the greater part of new ventures end in failure. A
life dedicated to failure is absurd, and is laughable so
long as it is not our own.
The Buddha has a relevant teaching: "You too shall
pass away / Knowing this, how can you quarrel." Truly,
concern for the temporal is to be discouraged. Let us
instead be indifferent to our pain and sufferings. It is
the fate of man to die, that what he does will be forgotte,
and that his creations will melt away. This is known to
scientists as the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We
disregard existential calls to action as logically indefensible so it must be mad to answer them. We implore
those who answer such a call to reflect on the virtues of
sanity, in contrast to the deficiencies of madness.
-

In ancient Athens, neutrality was a
crime and in American politics, the
irresolute meet with failure. We
argue the opposite: that the wise
man remains apathetic.
Christianity, too, sides with inaction, as evidenced
by the parable of the workers (Matthew 20:1-15). We paraphrase it now (a sad necessity of the modern age):
Jesus likens heaven to a landowner. This landowner
hires workers for his vineyard, some for the entirety of
the day and some for a single hour. All agree to be paid
a single denarius and receive that compensation. Those
who labored all day chafe at this perceived inequity
and are told to accept their agreed wage. This teaches
us that decades of apathy are justified by a moment of
correct action. Now is the timefor nothing.

So we say, for it was common order that elevated our
parents and whose stations we inherit today. We do not
spurn kindness and generosity, but are slow to act in
all things; thereby, we avoid the greatest of errors, survive and die reflecting on a life free of pain. The next
time someone tells you to support wind power, just
shrug and walk away.

Swarthmore enjoys a weekend full of jazz

BY SUNNY COWELL

scowelll@swarthmore.edu

On Friday, Nov. 9, at 7:30 p.m., the Jazz and Soul
Festival was held in Upper Tarble. The event was sponsored by the Black Cultural Center, the Office of
Multicultural Affairs and the Office of Student
Activities. Twan Claiborne 'OB co-hosted the show, along
with Stephanie Renee, the DJ of a local Philadelphia
Internet radio show. The Jazz and Soul Festival featured
Swarthmore students and local performers from
Philadelphia. Swarthmore's only R&B and soul a cappella group Essence of Soul opened the show singing an
improvised "circle song," along with "In the Still of the
Night," most famously recorded by Boyz II Men, and soul
singer Angie Stone's "Wish I Didn't Miss You." Essence
of Soul's groove set the tone for the rest of the acts, which
performed a mix of funk, jazz, R&B and soul music.
The first act, Erica Hawthorne, also known as
RhapsodE, is a spoken word artist and singer, who combines meaningful lyrics with soulful melodies and hot
beats. For the concert, RhapsodE performed tracks from
her latest CD, "Spoke Inward." Hailing from
Minneapolis, RhapsodE moved to Philadelphia to pursue
a graduate degree in African American studies and has
been performing in the Philly area ever since.
Nominated for a 2003 Minnesota Music Award, she has
been writing and performing all of her life.
Next, Shirley Slaughter performed with her band,
singing a combination of 1960s soul and disco music.
Shirley, a Dining Services employee, has been singing in
church and in other local venues for most of her life. She
recently released a solo album in 2007 called
"Philadelphia Story." Twan Claiborne 'OB said, "I was
glad to be a part of such a unique concert that incorporated professionals as well Swarthmore's students and
workers."

Widely acclaimed jazz bassist Gerald Veasley and his
band concluded the concert, performing a variety of soul,
funk and jazz. Veasley, a University of Pennsylvania
alum, has been playing the bass since he was 12 years
old. Veasley's talent and beautiful music wowed the audience. Amelia Kidd 'll said, "Jazz musicians are so talented. It is so impressive to be able to improvise and I
loved every musician's interpretation."
The weekend of jazz continued with the Swarthmore
College Jazz Ensemble Concert. On Saturday, Nov. 10, the

Swarthmore

College

Jazz Ensemble and Jazz Combos

performed in the Lang Concert Hall. The concert featured tunes from the likes of Cole Porter, Duke Ellington
and Charles Mingus. Opening with a drum roll, the first
jazz combo performed "This I Dig of You" by Hank
Mobley, featuring Hannah Epstein 'lO on the tenor sax,
Garth Griffin 'O9 on piano, Dan Perelstein 'O9 on bass and
Yaeir Heber 'll on drums. The next group performed Cole
Porter's "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" showcasing Alicia Lemke 'O9 on vocals and Mark Loria 'OB playing an impressive solo on piano. The next group, featuring Jacob Socolar on the vibes, performed "Passion
Dance" by McCoy Tyner. On vocals, Anna Grant 'lO
spiced up the stage with a Brazilian bossa nova called
"Chega de Saudade (No More Blues)" by Antonio Carlos
Jobim with solos by drummer Greg Albright 'lO and
pianist Garth Griffin 'O9. The jazz combos ended the first
half of the concert with a traditionalDixie-land jazz tune,
"Tiger Rag" by Edwin B. Edwards. With an upbeat tempo
and a catchy melody, this combo amused the audience by
singing "Hold that tiger!" in the middle of the piece. The
audience joined the group in clapping to the beat and
showed their appreciation with an early standing ovation at the conclusion of the first half.
After a 10-minute intermission, the full Swarthmore
Jazz Ensemble graced the stage with "Groove Merchant"
by Jerome Richardson and arranged by trumpet player
Thad Jones. This piece featured soloists Ben Rachbach
'll on piano, Soren Larson 'll on tenor sax, Ed Dewey 'lO
on trombone and Dan Perelstein 'O9 on bass. Next, the
ensemble played "Such Sweet Thunder" by Duke
Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, a product of the ensemble's collaboration with Mercedes Ellington for the
Swarthmore Music Department's ' recent
Jazz
Symposium. Jeff Santner 'O9 on alto sax was featured in
the Shakespeare inspired "Star Crossed Lovers" also by
Ellington and Strayhorn. The ensemble then performed
"How High the Moon," an infectious melody from the
musical "Two for Show," featuring Alicia Lemke 'O9 on
vocals, Hannah Epstein 'lO on tenor sax, Ben Rachbach
'll on piano and Dan Perelstein 'O9 on bass. "Moonlight

Serenade" featured a beautiful solo from Kara Peterman
'O9 on clarinet. Susie Willis 'O9 said, "Kara was amazing."
After this piece, the ensemble performed a more extensive piece with two movements called "The Black Saint
and the Sinner Lady." Originally conceived as a ballet,
the piece experiments with orchestration and harmony.
According to director Drew Shanefield, this piece was a
"wild ride" with all of the performers on stage soloing at

the same time at one point. The ensemble finished the
concert with the famous "Sing, Sing, Sing" by Louis
Prima showcasing Travis Rothbloom 'lO on trumpet.
Cathy Ng 'lO said, "It's great to see that the performers
are enjoying themselves while performing even though I
know they have the same hectic Swat schedules like the
rest of us." G. Patrick 'lO said, "You see them in class but
you don't realize that they have such fierce talent."

When The Roots broke down to a trio
for a cover of Bob Dylan's "Masters of
War" at Swarthmore on Nov. 3, Erin
Heaney 'O9 leaned over to me and said, "I
can't believe this. No one knows the
words." After looking around a little bit, I
was forced to the same conclusion. But
fear not, Swarthmore. If the prolific canon
of Dylan's work seems too much to handle,
check out "I'm Not There," the soundtrack
to the soon to be released film of the same
name. "I'm Not There" assembles a stellar
collection of artists to cover work from all
eras of Dylan's career.
The soundtrack to "I'm Not There" was
released on Oct. 30 in advance of the film,
which hits theatres on Nov. 2L Both the
soundtrack and the film cast many people
to play the part of Bob Dylan. For the film,
Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard
Gere, Heath Ledger, Marcus Carl Franklin
and Ben Whishaw all portray Dylan at different stages of his life.
Frankly, I don't know how this is going
to work out. Luckily, on a soundtrack, this
division of labor is much more sensible.
The soundtrack to "I'm Not There" features an incredible lineup of artists
including Sonic Youth, Jeff Tweedy,
Sufjan Stevens, The Hold Steady, Willie
Nelson, Stephen Malkmus and a lot of

Calexico. Each covers a Dylan song on the
34 track set.
The record begins with a dynamite version of "All Along the Watchtower" by
Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) and The Million

made real by his many years with guitar
in hand. Fans of Calexico's "In the Reins"
will be pleased by their continued collaboration with Iron & Wine on

collaboration

Dollar Bashers. This is Hendrix's "All

stellar guitar work all throughout the
song. You'll finish this song and wonder,
"Who the hell are the Millon Dollar
Bashers?" It turns out that they are something of a supergroup featuring, among
others, Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo (guitar)
and Steve Shelley (drums), Television's
Tom Verlaine (guitar), Wilco's Nels Cline
(guitar) and Dylan's bassist Tony Gamier.
Wow. That answers the question.
The Million Dollar Bashers, along with
Calexico, are the true heroes of this collection. The Bashers provide a backing
band for five tracks on the record, playing

Hypocritical letters
BY JEREMY FREEMAN

jfreemal@swarthmore. edu

■

I

There were four Letters to the Editor in the Nov. 8
issue of The Phoenix. Each was an instance of tiresome
self-righteousness, and each carried the rank stench that
arises whenever hypocrisy and poor
argument intertwine.
In the first letter, Alicia de los Reyes
describes the turmoil of entering

OP-ED

I

Swarthmore as a Christian. She claims that had herfaith
not stood up to secular skepticism, she wouldhave rejected it. But it stood up. So she is still a Christian. However,
Reyes gives no positive evidence on behalf of her beliefs,
no examples of how they "held up [to] all those questions." She doesn't think she needs to. Her implicit claim
is that as long as one feels his or her beliefs hold up to
questioning, one should continue believing them moreover, that they are "correct."
By this reasoning, if I grow up believing that babies
are delivered by storks, and no one manages to convince
me otherwise, the mere fact of my inconvincibility
proves that babies are delivered by storks. This is, I hope,
clearly false. The mere endurance of an individual's conviction entails no truth and justifies no belief.
The second letter is more incoherent than irrational.
Jeff Weaver and Mi Zheng claim that their faith comes
from the "mounting evidence in favor of the biblical
God" but fail to mention any such evidence. They claim
that faith "springs from experiential evaluation of truth
claims" but fail to mention any such evaluation of any
such truth claims. Most bizarrely, Weaver and Zheng
claim that there is "experiential evidence" for God even
while asserting that any evidence for God exists independent of the "naturalistic" world that we all experience. Like so many apologists before them, they try to
have it both ways, only to tear themselves apart.
That brings me back to hypocrisy. And Charlie
Decker's parody of Josh Cohen. Yes, Cohen is probably
correct that Decker "should have been bold enough to put
his name and face" on his embarrassinglyunfunny parody. But for Cohen to call Decker's piece "immaturely
offensive" is hypocritical. Let's consider just one of
Cohen's columns: the piece from March 29th, 2007 titled
"Holding onto our bad memories in the face of science."
To people suffering from serious mental illness, Cohen
crowed: just- "use your imagination" and get over it.
Unlike Decker's piece, this was not a parody (although it
was certainly hard to tell). It was also blindly offensive
and Cohen believed it all. I suspect Cohen now regrets
the piece. I don't care. His words were, and continue to
be, stunningly insensitive and willfully ignorant of relevant facts. Having written them, he is a hypocrite to call
anyone offensive now.
Phoenix editor Martha Marrazza wrote a letter
defending Cohen from Decker. She called Decker's paro-

dy "racist," and Spike editor Jon Peter's choice to publish
it "irresponsible." Apparently Marrazza considers it the
responsibility of an editor to hold back publication of
groundlessly offensive material. Where, I wonder, were
her responsibilities last March 29 when, as editor of the
Phoenix's Opinion's section, she ran Cohen's piece on
depression?

■ editorial

Small initiatives deserve praise
Swarthmore consistently receives national media
coverage for students making changes
big changes
in the world, through their efforts, which include facilitation of Hurricane Katrina relief, coverage of the Iraqi
war and raising awareness about the Darfurian genocide. There is no doubt that we are a college full of
socially aware and incredibly proactive students.
Although the media spotlight has been on the large-scale
projects that Swatties have undertaken, an increasing
number of students have taken commendable strides on
more personal levels to create change.
Take Lauren Goodfriend 'OB for example. While she
may not have the national stardom that Leonardo
DiCaprio or Al Gore have to promote their campaigns
against global warming, she took the initiative to change
her lifestyle by creating a system to generate solar energy in her dorm room. Should other people follow suit, a

Global Health Forum asked for donations of $lO per per-

son, and already, $3,000 have been raised to help fight
Malaria in Uganda.

Perhaps Mathatma Gandhi said it best when he
advised, "You must be the change you wish to see in the
world." This quote has taken on many different meanings and has been acted on in a myriad of different ways.
However, while the headlines tend to be given to the individuals whose efforts have produced huge results, we

little
want to praise those who have done their share
to fix the problems they've seen in
by little, bit by bit
the world around them. Every one of us has the capacity to make a difference in out own way, and these initiatives, small as they may be, should not go unnoticed.

African leaders also at fault for Zoe's Ark
The African lead-

ers' chant, "Our old
colonial masters continue ..." rang out
again

last month in

response to the Zoe's
Ark scandal. It has left
me feeling mellow and

perhaps silently sore.

humanitarian organization that has been

recently illuminated
by the media's spot-

light after its cowboy-

ish attempts to resettle 103 "orphaned Darfurian" toddlers
from areas near the Chad-Sudan border became
grotesque. The majority of the children were not orphans.
In fact, Zoe's Ark had the Chadian parents and caregivers
under the impression that their children would be attending schools in a city within Chad. Most of the toddlers

were not Darfurian but actually Chadian. Finally, their
attempts to resettle the kids were dishonest and illegal.
Founder Eric Breteau and his gang wrapped the children
in iodine stained bandages and attached fake IV drips to
the toddlers so that they could evacuate the toddlers
under the pretense that they were injured war victims
going to receive treatment in France. However, the cause
of my silent pain is not the idealistic risky efforts of the
"humanitarians" but the fact that the Chadian government has used this as an opportunity to deflect attention
away from its own gruesome version of African leadership.

This time that familiar chant was sung in a note that
was sickly sweet. This was because this note can only be
produced by those who love to excuse their actions under
the belief that they are perpetually wronged. The
President of Chad, Idriss Deby, said in response to these
events, "They treat us like animals

will do everything to expose this odious crime."
Deby, like other African leaders, must have both a
selective memory and a hearing impediment that causes
his hypocritical behavior. He claims that Chad's former
colonial ruler, France, treats his countrymen as animals.
He must have forgotten that he has 7,000 child soldiers in
his army. I would argue that a country where children
(some as young as eight years old) are fprced by circumWe

stance to enter the army is treating its children like animals. He must have a hearing impediment if he can hear
the cries of the 103 children from Zoe's Ark but cannot
hear the cries of the mothers who live in a country where
one in five children do not live past the age of five because
of malnutrition and starvation. It is an "odious crime"
that, through greed and corruption, African leaders are

able to create a situation were there is a need for organizations like Zoe's Ark, regardless of how detrimentally
idealistic these organizations are. For these reasons I
believe that the Chadian government is just as guilty of
the crime of making decisions with detrimental effects
without taking into the account the opinions of those who
will be affected.
What the media is now focused on is the debate over
whether French President Nicolas Sarkozy should apply
diplomatic pressure on Chad so that the seven members of
Zoe's Ark who remain in Chad can be extradited to France
because no one knows whether the members ofZoe's Ark
will receive an unbiased trail in Chad. This is because it
is very clear that the Chadians are enraged and if the
"Westerners" are found guilty, they could be sentenced to
20 years of hard labor. The obvious counter-argument is
that this extradition will show disrespect for Chad's sovereignty and laws. With the EU wanting to place 3,000
peacekeeping troops in Eastern Chad, keeping Chadians
happy would be a good idea. I'm indifferent on the issue
of where the humanitarians should be tried, as regardless
of what happens, some of these children may never to be
returned to their parents.

Now an embarrassing time to be an American
There is perhaps no
single event which embodies the absurd depth to

which America has sunk

in the past few years more
than President Bush's
response to Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf s

JOEL SWANSON

Sound and Fury

declaration of martial law
in Pakistan.
On Saturday, Nov. 3,
officially
Musharraf
declared a "state of emergency" in Pakistan, in the

name ofcombating Islamic
extremism and stabilizing the country. Of course, it seems
likely that the real reason for his extra-constitutional
actions was not so much the threat of Islamic militants as it
was simply his refusal to relinquish any of his dictatorial
powers.
Musharraf s move came just days before the
Supreme Court was set to rule on whether or not his alleged
victory in the 2007 Pakistani presidential election was legitimate or not. In addition, Musharraf has resisted demands
that he step down as Pakistan's army chief in order to continue to serve as its president. The return to Pakistan of
opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister,
from her exile in Dubai also threatens Musharrafs tenuous
hold on power. His response to all of these threats was to
simply refuse to abide by any of the democratic institutions
of Pakistan, and to become a full-fledged autocrat. He has
suspended the Pakistani Constitution, fired Supreme Court
justices and placed Bhutto under house arrest. Police are
also detaining opposition political leaders and activists
throughout the country. Musharraf now claims that he will
relinquish his military position and hold elections in
February; I'll believe that when I see it.
Naturally, if the Bush administration genuinely believed
in spreading democracy, as President Bush has repeatedly
asserted, the response to such a move by Musharraf should

be a swift and thorough condemnation, followed by the
immediate end to all military aid to the Musharraf regime
until democracy is restored. But the most the White House
could say about Musharrafs declaration of martial law was
that it is "very disappointing." Condoleezza Rice called it
"highly regrettable." And while Rice has indicated that aid
money for Musharraf may be "reviewed," thus far it seems
that the money will continue flowing. Aides to Musharraf
described the Americanresponse to Musharraf s emergency
powers as "muted."
All of this just goes to show that Bush does not genuinely
believe in democracy for the Islamic world, at least not at the
expense of prosecuting the fight against terrorism. Since
September 11, 2001, President Musharraf, who was never a
genuinely democratic leader, has been an important ally of
the United States, providing us with a foothold in a region
plagued by problems with Islamic extremists. This has of
course been a marriage of convenience, not conviction, but
this has not stopped the U.S. from funneling roughly eleven
billion dollars to the Musharraf regime. As a result, the
Bush administration has been trying for months to negotiate
a deal that would permit Musharraf to remain in power
while still maintaining some surface appearance of democratic legitimacy. This would of course have only been a surface appearance; there is probably nothing that Bush fears
more than genuine democratic elections in Pakistan, which
would run the risk of electing an anti-American, proIslamist government. According to Tariq Azim Khan, the
minister of state for information, the Bush administration
"would rather have a stable Pakistan
albeit with some
restrictive norms than have more democracy prone to fall
in the hands ofextremists." As usual, Bush supports democracy only so far as the people exercise their right to vote for
a pro-Western regime.
But even if Bush suddenly decided to actually unify his
rhetoric and his actions for once, and to genuinely condemn
Musharraf s emergency powers, would we have any credibility left to make such a statement? The answer is, unfortunately, probably not. When you have a president who is

willing to ignore almost all of his own country's constitutional restrictions on his power in the name of fighting terrorism, it sends the message that such behavior is acceptable from other leaders as well. When you round up people
simply because they have Middle Eastern-sounding names,
and lock them up in prison with no right to challenge their
detention, you cannot then condemn President Musharraf
for rounding up opposing political leaders. When you have
an attorney general nominee who refused to state that the
president of the United States is restricted by the
Constitution in matters of national security, and who
refused to state that the technique of waterboarding is torture, then you basically forfeit all rights to condemn other
world leaders for not abiding by the rule of law.
Indeed, one of the most striking and least covered aspects
of Musharraf s declaration of martial law was his explicit
reference to U.S. history in justifying his decision.

Musharraf cited Abraham Lincoln's extra-constitutional
measures during the United States Civil War as precedent,
claiming that, "As an idealist, Abraham Lincoln had one
consuming passion during that time of crisis, and this was
to preserve the Union... towards that end, he broke laws, he
violated the Constitution, he usurped arbitrary power, he
trampled individual liberties." Musharraf was most likely
using this juxtaposition to support his claim that Pakistan is
facing a crisis of equal magnitude to the Civil War, and that
extreme measures are needed to hold the nation together.
Nevertheless, it was extremely jarring to hear a foreign dictator use U.S. history as justification for violating rule of
law, a principle that is supposed to be sacred to this nation.
So we've come full circle now. We have an American
president who violates laws in the name of national security, supporting a Pakistani president who violates laws in the
name ofnational security, who in turn cites America as his
example for the violation of laws in the name of national
security. I've never been more embarrassed to be an
American.

A view at the top: how America's economic elite can inspire change

YOSHI JOHNSON
Yo, It's Not That Deep
I've really been feeling the whole 'Class
Awareness Month' vibe lately. To be fair, I'll
plug moustaches, and diabetes awareness
since it's their month, too. After the past few
weeks, however, I think I should lay off the
criticism of wealthy institutions and their
fiscal priorities. People are thinking and
talking about it now anyways and, in the
end, maybe it just hits a little too close to

home for the moment.
Continuing with the idea that great
wealth confers great responsibility, though,
I want to shift my focus from wealthy institutions to the wealthy individuals of the

world. Their actions and the morality thereof mayprove more revealing when subjected
to scrutiny. They are, after all, the people
who often finance or otherwise direct institutions of higher education and wider society. It would seem, then, that the project of

realizing greater equality within the world's

population must necessarily involve this

echelon of elites.
First, an overview of the world's current
distribution of wealth. According to a com-

prehensive UN study released in 2006, the
top one percent of the world controls 40 percent of all wealth, and the top decile controls
an astounding 85 percent of the world's
wealth. The bottom half of the world's pop-

20

ulation, on the other hand, owns less than
one percent of the wealth. This wealth is disproportionately concentrated in countries
with the highest average incomes—that is,
in the United States, Western Europe,
Australia, and Japan and South Korea. The
U.S. alone monopolizes a full 36 percent ofall
wealth, even though it amounts to a mere 6
percent of the world population.
These numbers blow my mind. Granted,
some people may not find this numerical
breakdown abhorrent, but the disparities
are at least surprising. Now I'm not going to
invoke the staple ten-people-and-a-pie analogy, but I think illustrating the point with
food is a pretty good metaphorical choice for
impressing upon an audience just how
unfair this breakdown is.
Say you had 100 people and split a stash of
100 cookies amongst them according to the
aforementioned proportions. In this scenario, ten people would have 85 cookies
amongst them, while the remaining 90 people would get just 15 cookies. Yikes. And
think about the guy with forty cookies to
himself. He puts cookie monster to shame.
(And yes, it's a guy. Check out the top of a
Forbes' list next time you get a chance.)
Worse still, think about the 50 people who
would have to split one cookie! That's right.
Fifty people, one cookie. It'd be straight-up

MortalKombat!
The basic idea is that the world is one of

those ridiculous Twix commercials writ
large: "Two for me, none for you." Sure, we
have cookie monsters like Bill Gates and
Warren Buffett, who in their magnanimous
benevolence opt to toss the rest of the world
some crumbs. Be that as it may, thereality
is that most of the cookie monsters are not in
the business of making trickle-down cookienomics an empirical reality, and without a
bunch of them onboard, they can only do so
much. Besides, it could be argued that even

the generous few often retain too much of an
asset base in establishing what are sometimes little more than self-serving testaments to their altruism. $3O billion dollars is
a lot to give away, Bill, but having more than
$5O billion left over in spare change renders
your generosity decidedly less noble in ges-

ture.
And this cookie situation is not just a
ridiculous thing
it's downright wrong. I

mean, I know that people dismiss such disparities with glib like, "Rich people worked
hard and deserve every penny." Good.
You're right. You can stop reading now,
Johnny Apathy and Donny Dense. For the
and
rest of you, consider that your lot
often come down to blind
your riches
luck. As the logic goes, a sizable majority of

one's wealth can be attributed to social capital more than anything else. Luck of the
draw, you're born American and voila! Your
life chances are already through the roof.
(There are plenty of qualifiers to that characterization, but the basic point is clear.)
Actually, this isn't just some conventional

wisdom. The purveyors of this idea are
Nobel Prize-winning economist H. Simon,
and perhaps more tellingly, Warren Buffet
himself.

There's also the argument that the developed world, which boasts most of the top
decile of wealthy individuals, accrues
wealth at the expense ofpoor and developing
nations—an argument evidenced by, say, US
and European agricultural subsidies, or the
willingness of US administrations and corporations to deal with corrupt or undemocratic governments for the sake of profit and
interest. These ideas, and the fact that the
income and wealth gaps are only widening,
thoroughly frustrate justifications of the status quo based on the idea that the wealthy
have earned their hoards deservedly and
single-handedly.

November 15, 2007

The obligation to do something more
than just squirreling away hoards of gold,
then, becomes a little more compelling for
the wealthy of the world—at least, I would
hope so. So many systemic and historically
persistent social and economic ills have
severely constrained the extent of human
possibility, and with such a top-heavy
resource distribution, why not lob a few
more cookies at the problems, cookie monsters? Cookie monsters, let it be known,
include adults with $61,000 or more in assets.
Bill Gates and his foundation, for instance,
have been credited with single-handedly
reconfiguring the economic incentive landscape of the health care and pharmaceutical
industries. Offer up enough $750 millionand
$1 billion grants for HIV/AIDS research, and
before too long, someone may just have reason to find a cure.
We are in an era where we have seen not
only a retrenchment of the welfare state
specifically, but more generally, an insidious
de-legitimation of the role that governments
are allowed to play in mitigating and ameliorating these ills. The need for these superwealthy individuals to step in as stop-gaps,
accordingly, has become even greater. Fine,
I'll concede that the politics ofredistribution
are a bit controversial in today's "I Heart
Neoliberalism" society. But one cookie for
50 people? Now that ain't right.
And have you seen how crazy Britney
Spears and Michael Jackson are looking
these days? Or Bill Gates, for that
matter?Who wants to be a bazillionaire anyways? Besides, m%, I never could eat more
than a few cookies.
Note to gullible rich people: If any of you
want to commence their philanthropic
streak right away, I'd be down with an even
million, too. Just a thought.

headed to doomsday on a remote

not be true, grandpa has one thing
right: the book is slowly becoming
the vestige of a bygone era. But it

even
as millions of Americans stop reading, the publishing industry isn't
giving them a reason to pick up the
hobby again, much less saving face

Instead, it's rewarding quantity
instead of quality, using book clubs
to ramp up sales, and thereby
allowing itself to be flooded, like its
competitor the television, by mudslinging politicos.

Authors are resorting
to the litigation
process that
conservatives claim

to despise.
The recent news from the New
York Times is at first patently ironic: a cadre of conservative authors
are suing their publisher, Regnery
Publishing, for skimping them of
their royalties by selling their
books to book clubs at drastically
reduced prices. With their worker

wrote such masterpieces as "Unfit

and "War Crimes: The Left's

are resorting to the litigation process that conservatives
claim to despise and turning their
backs on the ideal of loose capitalism that allows their profiteer publishers to rob them of their royalties. It must smack of fair-weather
free marketing to a conservative,
and to a liberal observer, it's just
funny. But behind the irony of it all
is the fact that Regnery Publishing
is nothing out of the ordinary. The
system in which it operates
rewards cheap books and bestseller
lists, $1 book clubs and bargain

bins.
As near as one can tell, the economics of it are fairly simple: an

book versus ten cents. So why
mass market at such low prices?
It's not to spread a product. One
has to wonder why anyone would
buy a book called "Sweet Jesus, I

Amann and Tom Breuer), unless it
were in $1 book club deal. No, the
impetus behind the book club is

to
wangle a place on the bestseller

influence in a society that equates
sales with some philosophical,
educational or intellectual value.

Books have already
lost the battle.
Could the inference be more
misguided? The New York Times
Bestseller List for nonfiction is
chock full of smear attacks and
mudslinging manuscripts from
both sides of the spectrum: Justice
Clarence Thomas' wildly ideological "autobiography" takes the
sixth spot, Valerie Plame assails
the Bush Administration from the
tenth, Ann Coulter hails from
number twenty with the seminal
"If Democrats Had Any Brains,
They'd Be Republicans" and Paul
Krugman's "The Conscience of a
Liberal" turns in at number thirty.
This is fully one year before the
next presidential election. Most
political authors enjoy great success during election year summers
like Swift Boat nutjob
Jerome Corsi did with "Unfit for
Command," which came out
August 2004. In other words, as the
election heats up, we're in for a
brawl in the bookstore that bodes
only ill for a publishing industry
well outpaced by its competitors.
Books have already lost the battle. With television, music, video
games and movies arrayed against
the publishing industry, the
impulse to increase sales by
reducing quality and cost is futile.
But more than that, it's a disgrace
to the literary tradition that the
publishing industry should try to
uphold. Keeping bulk-sale books
(a la those snatched up and sold
for pennies by book clubs) off the
bestseller lists would be a start.
But until the book regains its dignity, don't expect me to tell anyone to read one.

Garnet women take ECAC crown on PKs
BY CONOR CASEY

ccasey2@swarthmore.edu

The women's soccer team claimed its first ever Eastern
College Athletic Conference title Sunday in Grove City,
Pa., when it defeated number five seed Catholic University
in a shootout, 5-3, after it battled Catholic to a 0-0 tie.
The victory was the third in three games of the ECAC
tournament for the third-seeded Garnet, who also beat
number six seed Misericordia College 4-0 to open up the
tournament at home on Nov. 7, before traveling to Grove
City where it finished off second seed Frostburg State
University, 3-0.
The championship game on Sunday eerily resembled
Swarthmore's last game before the tournament, the
Centennial Conference semifinals that finished in a 0-0 tie
to Ursinus College, a game the Garnet eventually lost 5-3 in
penalty kicks. In its game against the Catholic Cardinals,
the Garnet found themselves once again unable to break
through against the opposition. Despite getting off an
astounding number of shots in regulation and the two
overtime periods, Catholic goalie Tere Rossi and the
Cardinals defense stifled all Swarthmore attacks.
"The game seemed destined to go into penalty kicks,"
Garnet head coach Todd Anckaitis said. "Their goalkeeper
played out of her mind."
In the tie, Swarthmore out-shot Catholic 30-7, and Rossi
made an amazing 13 saves. Comparatively, Garnet goalie
Lauren Walker 'O9 was required only to make three saves
to ensure her side of the shutout.
Looking back on the game, Anckaitis noted the significance of the game being ended on penalty kicks.
"We needed to prove to ourselves that we could come
out in that situation," he said.
Unlike the penalty kick-decided game against Ursinus,
however, this time the Garnet shot first.
Both teams tallied scores in their first three attempts,
and Swarthmore went ahead by one on its fourth shot.
Walker then saved Catholic's attempt to tie up the score,
and Julia Luongo 'lO, whose turn never came up in penalty kicks as the fifth and final kicker against Ursinus two
weeks ago, notched the game winner.

"It was important for us to win in
that way. Looking back, it couldn't
have been scripted any better."
Coach Todd Anckaitis
"It was important for us to win in that way," Anckaitis
said. "Looking back, it couldn't have been scripted any bet-

ter."
In the first game of the tournament against
Misericordia, Swarthmore jumped out to an early lead and

never looked back.

The women's soccer team poses with its championship plaque after beating Catholic on Sunday afternoon.
Less than five and a half minutes into the game Megan
Colombo 'll scored her team-leading eighth goal of the season, driving the ball into the upper right hand corner of
the goal, past the outstretched hands of the leaping
Misericordia goalie. After 13 minutes, Colombo added
another score, this time off an assist from fellow team
points leader Kelsey Cline 'IL Just two minutes later, Cline
teamed up on another Swarthmore score, this time assisting Monica Cody 'lO score her first goal of the year. Finally,
just under 35 minutes into the half, Hannah Purkey 'll put

up her third goal of the season, this one off an assist from
Garnet defender Eileen Earl 10. Swarthmore was done
scoring for the night, and it would not allow a single
Misericordia goal.
Its next game against Frostburg was more of the same
story. Cline scored the game's first two goals in the first
thirteen minutes, and Sarah Reese 'll added another insurance goal under ten minutes into the second half. Both
Cline's first goal and Reese's score came off of corner
kicks, Cline's from Earl, and Reese's from Kirsten
Peterson 'IL What was significant about this shutout that

differentiated it from the first against Misericordia, is that
Frostburg overwhelmingly out-shot Swarthmore 11-2 in
the second half, and 21-10 on the night. Walker made an
impressive 10 saves over the course of the game to maintain the win and the shutout.
The three wins garnered the Garnet its first ever ECAC
title, and served as retribution for its run at the NCAA
title being cut short.
"We're really glad we could end the season on a good
note, 1 Colombo said. "Especially for the seniors."
Reese agreed. "We're pretty excited because we wanted
to do something for the seniors, and have them go out in
style," she said.
In addition to feeling proud about his team's welldeserved ECAC championship, Anckaitis is proud of the
increased respect the team has earned around the conference and region with each successive win and is excited
'

for the future of the program.

"I'm really excited because we've got a good core group
of players returning, and only two graduating seniors," he
said.

Swat XC wraps up season at Regionals
BY MELISSA CRUZ
mcruzl@swarthmore.edu

This past Saturday, Nov. 10, both the
men's and women's cross country teams
competed in their last race of the season.
Both the women's 6k and the men's 8k
races took place at Lehigh University in
Bethlehem, Pa. The women's team finished
in 6th place out of 37 teams, tying with
Grove City, and the men's team finished in
Bth place out of 41 competing teams.
The Swat ladies were lead by Nyika
Corbett 'lO, who fled through the course in
22 minutes and 58 seconds, making her
average mile time 6:10. Corbett finished in
32nd place out of 267 total female finishers.
Only five seconds behind Corbett and a
consistent leader of the Swat women this
season came Emma Stanley 'O9 with a time
of 23:03, landing her a 40th place finish
overall. Close behind was Ashley Davies
'lO, who crossed the finish line only a
stride's length behind Stanley, at 23:07,

22

grabbing the 42nd spot. More top finishers
in Saturday's race were Caitlin Russel 'll
(23:09), Kathy Feeney 'O9 (23:37), Bess Ritter
'O9 (23:53) and Lauren DeLuca 'lO (24:17).
Erik Saka 'O9 was the first finisher for
the Swat men in this final race of the season. Finishing the 8K course in 26:08, he
landed a 30th place finish out of 282 total
male finishers. His average mile time
throughout the race was a remarkable 5
minutes and 16 seconds. Close behind
Saka, and each completing the race in
under 27 minutes, were Ross Weller 'OB
(26:21), Jon Shoop 'OB (26:49) and first-year
Patrick Hartnett (26:53). More top-scoring
Swat men were Dan Hodson 'O9 (27:02),
Mickey Katz 'OB (27:04) and Alex Frye 'll

(27:35).
Frye 'll commented on the race day attitude of the teams. "With near perfect con-

ditions [39 degrees Fahrenheit, slight
breeze, hard ground, nearly flat course], we
all took it to the wall," a phrase which Frye

described as a team-adopted mantra, mean-

ing, "giving your hardest effort without

fail."

A few more team members commented
on the final race, and on the season as a
whole. "Everyone's finishes were faster
than those the last time we raced on the
course," Caitlin Russell 'll said, "some by
over a minute. Even though a lot of us
unfortunately had to deal with injuries, we
left the course with nothing to regret. We
did the best in everything that was in our
control." Russell plans to resume training
for the upcoming indoor track season after
taking a few weeks to recuperate from the
strenuous cross country season.
"Our team really came together for
regionals. This whole year we have done
well at working as a pack, and with all of
the injuries that people have been struggling with, the closeness of the team let us
push each other through our workouts and
races, Corbett said.
In the end, it really all comes down to

Swim teams split vs. Dips Regional rivalries
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

Saturday was filled with mixed emotions for the Garnet
swim teams, as the women triumphed over Franklin and
Marshall College with record-book performances, 114-91,
while the men suffered from injury and close losses in
numerous races to fall 129-76.
The win for the women marked the first time that
Swarthmore had beaten the Diplomats in their pool in Coach
Sue Davis' tenure, and neither the significance of the win
nor the energy boost that it gave the women has been lost on
them.
"It was so much fun," Anne Miller 10 said of the meet.
"The high of winning the meet lasted all through Sunday."
According to both swimmers and Davis, the difference in the
women's meet came down not to physical ability but to
desire. "I think the girls' team wanted it really badly and we

went in ready to win and ready to compete," Miller said.
"The women knew that it was going to come down to
which team wanted to win the meet," Davis said. "And I

guess it was Swarthmore."
Miller led the way with a Swarthmore-record time in the
1000 yard freestyle, breaking her own record in 10:4718. She
was followed by Allison Bishop 11 who wasted no time in
getting her own name in Swarthmore history, as her 11:03.92
was good enough for fifth place of all time. The Garnet got a
big boost in the 50 freestyle, as the Swat women trio of
Jennie Lewis 'OB (25.89), Claire Shelden 10 (26.26) and
Chelsea Brett 11 (26.51) swept the top three places. Franny
Zhang 'OB edged out F&M's Laura Bassford by 0.29 seconds in
the 200 IM with a time of 2:16.02, and Miller and Casey
Osborn 10 continued their dominance in the butterfly with
a 1-2 finish, recording times of 5914 and 1:00.82, respectively.

JuliaWrobel 'O9 beat out Meghan Karanian of the Diplomats
by 01 seconds for a 56.70 win in the 100 freestyle, and Miller
earned her third victory of the meet in the 500 freestyle
(5:18.68). Other significant finishes for the Swarthmore
women were Allie Jordan 'o9's third-place in the 100 backstroke (1:0417) and Stephanie Su 'o9's third-place in the 100

breaststroke (1:14.47). With the meet down to the last event,
the 200 freestyle relay, the Swarthmore team of Wrobel,
Brett, Shelden and Lewis overcame the cheering of stands
full ofF&M fans to clinch the win, finishing in 1:43.25.Lewis
held off F&M's surging Brittany McCabe with a 2518 split,
and the Garnet women maintained their perfect 3-0 record
on the season.
While the men came into the meet with a similar intensity and effort, the cards were stacked against them. Distance
leader Stephen Shymon 'O9 was out with a recent injury, and
the Garnet had a big hole to fill after last year's stellar lastsecond win that was catalyzed by its class of 2007. "The men
actually had a very good meet but we had a couple guys that
weren't swimming as well as they had before," Davis said.
"We were pumped," Andrew Frampton 'OB said of the
team's attitude going into the meet. But, "it was a bummer

not having Shymon in there. We still had great swims but
some of us were sick or not altogether there."
Swarthmore still had impressive performances from
Derrick Kao 'IX who placed second in the 1000 freestyle in
10:4011 and third in the 500 freestyle in 5:08.66, Doug
Gilchrist-Scott 'O9, who won the 50 freestyle in 22.52 and finished second in the 100 backstroke in 56.13, Sterling
Satterfield 13, third in the 200 IM in 2:04.56 and third in the
100 breaststroke in 1:02.86, Brian Roth 'O9, second in the 100
butterfly in 54.59, Michael Ann 'lO, who won the 100 freestyle
in 50.02, Frampton, who finished second in the 500 freestyle
in 5:08.66, third in the 200 freestyle and fourth in the 100 butterfly in 57.20 and Kyle Skolfield 10, second in the 100 breaststroke in 1:02.69.
This weekend, both teams will be facing tough competition against squads from New York University.
"NYU's going to be a tough meet mentally and probably
physically," Miller said, "but as long as we can go in with a
positive attitude and have fun in our races it shouldn't be

that bad."
Davis had the same sentiment as Miller. "The women
have to have another meet like that had against F&M and
not be pessimistic," she said. "You never know what's going
to happen till it's over."

Badminton Squad Faces Stiff Competition at Bryn Athen to Open Season
This past weekend, the Garnet

participated in its first badminton
tournament of the season, the 2007
Mid-Atlantic Classic at Bryn Athyn
College. Major advancers in the

tournament included Kim Kramer
'lO and Maithili Parikh 'll, who
reached the quarterfinals of
Women's Singles A. Kramer and

the governing body for the sport of
badminton in the United States. It
was an unusually chaEenging tournament for the team due to the fact
that it was open not only to college
students, but also to adults.
Consequently, the Garnet competed
against a very experienced and
skilled group, which included players who have previously trained
abroad and are ranked nationally.
Team captain Patricia Kelly 'OB said,
"My impression of the games were
that we played well for the skill level
that we were up against and we
learned a lot from the tournament
and it encouraged us all to practice
our mistakes before the season
starts, which is soon, in three weeks

Parikh were also runners-up in the
Women's Doubles A consolation. The
rest of the team participated in
Women's Singles B, Women's
Doubles B, Men's Doubles B and
Mixed Doubles A and B.
The Mid-Atlantic Badminton
Classic is sanctioned by USA
Badminton, which is recognized as

actually."

There are currently 14 players on
the team. Practices are typically held
Monday through Thursday from 5:30
p.m. to 7: 30 p.m. in the Field House.
The Garnet will next compete at
Bryn Mawr College on Nov. 29.
Following that, the team will be playing in the Mid-Atlantic Juniors.
Unlike at the Mid-Atlantic Classic,
however, the team will be competing
against opponents who will be closer
to their age bracket.
"The Mid-Atlantic Classic gave
us the challenge we needed to start
off the season in order to determine
what we further need to work on in
practice," Kelly said. "It was an
excellent experience. Overall, the
fun."

a toll on the "beautiful game." Players,
coaches and clubs
ignore the age olc
concept of "keeping'

contracts,
electing
instead to focus on

the merits of breach-

ing contracts, contingent on relative due diligence. These days, I long for the
"good ole days," when football was more about pride
and passion than money and commerce. Last weekend,
I got my wish, as football fans worldwide had the privilege of watching two of the world's most passionate
regional rivalries the Tyne-Wear and Second City derbies. In the former, Newcastle boss "Big" Sam Allardyce
fearlessly led his players into chaotic Tyne-hell, otherwise known as Sunderland's Stadium of Light
Sunderland gaffer Roy Keane, or "Keano," was cheered
by 47,000 fans (from a total stadium capacity of 48,300)
upon entry into the ground, a typically packed house for
English football's most passionate football rivalry. Prior
to the match, Sunderland had not won any of its last five
matches, while Newcastle had only salvaged a point
from three matches. The scene was set for a moraleboosting Sunderland victory, with Keano galvanizing
his troops in a press conference held right before the
match. The actual match, however, offered mixed
results, as the two sides tied 1-L Danny Higginbotham
opened the scoring with a header for Sunderland, sending the red and white army into dreamland. Its elation
was short-lived, however, as James Milner equalized for
the visitors with a fluke cross-turned-shot into the box.
More than the results, though, I was delighted with the
style of play exhibited on the field. Both sides played
with great intensity, passion, and excitement, reinforcing the Tyne-Wear derby's favorable reputation. Sure,
the football played was not beautiful, per se, but it exhib-

ited the soul of the "beautiful game."
The Second City derby brought another heart-warmdose of passion to my nostalgic soul, as Aston Villa
edged past Birmingham City two goals to one.
Birmingham gaffer Steve Bruce was greeted by 26,500
fans (total stadium capacity of 30,000) at St. Andrews
Park, with Martin O'Neill's Villa enjoying a rougher
ing

entrance into the ground. The century-old regional
rivalry between the two clubs promised to yield a great
match. Entering the contest, Birmingham had been
through a rough patch with four losses in the last five
games, whereas Villa was coming off a two-win streak.
Martin O'Neill's youthful squad had been making ripples across the Premier League, evidenced by its eighth
place position in the standings. Birmingham City, however, was the home side, and O'Neill acknowledged this
through his cautious pre-match interview. Villa opened
the scoring with an own goal from former defender and

current Birmingham captain Liam Ridgewell, a touch of
irony that shows the passionate and often unpredictable
character of local derby matches. Mikael Forssell, an
unlikely candidate for the equalizer, then brought
Birmingham level with an unstoppable header into the
top corner. The visitors, however, pulled off an impressive late coup through Gabriel Agbonlahor, the club's
local young star, who grew up a Villa fan, as he
skimmed an Ashley Young cross into the net. The match
exemplified all the positive characteristics of a derby
match. The players, regardless of age, race or nationality, fought tooth-and-nail for victory in one of the most
passionate contests I've had the privilege to watch all
season. I saw passion and commitment reinstalled in
footbaU.

The "beautiful game" earned its nickname for a reason. Passionate regional rivalries help preserve the
dying soul of football, in the face of increasing commercialization pressures. Watch one of the matches and see
if you can identify the players' "big hearts," as Cantona
would put it. Football is all about passion.

Golden goal gives Swat championship
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu
Two weeks ago, the men's soccer team was faced with disappointment at having just missed out on the Centennial
Conference playoffs and anticipation of the ECAC seed
announcements. This week, it's celebrating a historical team
finish, a championship in the ECAC Southern Region, after
a 3-2 overtime win over Frostburg State Unversity on
Sunday. Top-seeded Swarthmore overcame two deficits
against the Bobcats to take home the trophy one day after it
edged Westminster College in the semifinals, 1-0.
Patrick Christmas 'OB scored the lone goal of the game
three minutes into the second half against the Griffins to

send Swarthmore into the finals. The Garnet dominated the
offensive stats, outshooting Westminster 23-7. Goalie Ryan
Sutcliffe 'OB was forced to make just two saves in the game,
as the Garnet defense, anchored by Brendan Grady 'OB, kept
the Griffins out of striking distance. Despite Swarthmore's
offensive advantage, the match was a battle until the end. "It
was a scrappy battle," Christmas said. "For most of the game
it could have gone one way or the other."
Swarthmore's confidence level was at a high going into
the final. "We felt really positive about it because we didn't
really know a whole lot about Frosburg State but we knew
we were playing some of the best soccer of our season,"
Sutcliffe said.
Swarthmore's semifinal win set the team up for a
matchup on Sunday at Clothier Field against the Bobcats,
who had defeated Carnegie Mellon University 3-2 and The
Pennsylvania State University Altoona, 2-1, both in overtime, to reach the finals. Both teams came out on the field
with an intensity that was immediately evident, and to the
delight of 301 fans in attendance, never let down for over 90

minutes of play.
The Garnet came out firing early on, with two big
chances in the first ten minutes. Mike Bonesteel 'OB shot a

bullet that was punched over the goal by Frostburg State
goalie Jay Herford, followed by a header just wide of the goal
by Yoi Tibbetts 'OB. The Swarthmore pressure continued, but
the Bobcats responded and much of the first half was backand-forth opportunities for the two squads. Frostburg State
was able to capitalize for the only goal of the half, as

Swarthmore defenders collided in front of the goal, allowing
the Bobcats' Kenny Dotter to put a ball past Sutcliffe five
minutes before halftime. Swarthmore had one more significant opportunity before the break, as Bonesteel headed a ball
from Gage Newman 11 over the crossbar with 1:20 left in the
half, allowing the Bobcats to maintain their 1-0 lead.
Far from being discouraged by the deficit, the Garnet
came out firing with increased intensity in the second half.
Twenty minutes in, Swarthmore had two frustratingly close
opportunities, as Grady's tip on an Evan Nesterak 'O9 corner

kick went just wide of the goal, and Nesterak's diving shot
was stopped. Nesterak found the net a few minutes later,

however, to tie up the game on an assist from Morgan
Langley 'lO and shift the momentum back to the Garnet with
17:15 remaining in the game. But the Bobcats weren't done,
and at 82:25, recent substitute Andres Vega put an unassisted ball past Sutcliffe, with the Frostburg State bench erupting in championship-worthy celebration. But the Garnet
men and their crowd responded with more enthusiasm and
energy, as the last seven minutes of the team's season began
to tick away.
"These kind of moments, they don't come around very
often," Christmas said of the team's mentality in the waning
minutes of the championship match. "We're at the end of the
season and wheif it's over, we're going to want it back. And
so we knew that we had to leave it all on the field, and that's
what was really driving us throughout the playoffs."
Swarthmore continued its offensive push towards the
Bobcat goal, and Nesterak shot a ball that just barely cleared
over the crossbar with six minutes left in the game, forcing
the nail-biting to continue for the Garnet fans. But the anxiety would become elation a few minutes later, when Grady,
the MVP of the tournament, scored his first goal of the season with 1:24 left in regulation, stunning a confident

Frostburg State team and giving the Swarthmore seniors,
players and fans alike hope for the possibility of one more
win at home.
According to Coach Eric Wagner, Grady's goal completely turned the tide and there was no longer any question in
the team's mind that the championship was theirs. "Once we
tied it up that late in the game, I said, 'That's it, we just broke

their backs, it's over,'" Wagner said.
Sutcliffe agreed. "It was the turning point because the
goal came from an unlikely person," he said. "I think the
goal itself shocked Frostburg quite a bit."
Wagner acknowledged that the Bobcats had a "hot goalie"
and that getting two goals against Herford had already been
an accomplishment. "Getting a third [goal], I didn't know if
we could do it," he said. "I also knew we weren't going to
give up another goal. I thought at the very least if we went to
penalties they didn't stand a chance against us."
But neither Wagner nor the Garnet faithful had to wait
for penalties, as Stu Leon 'O9 sent a perfect shot from 25
yards out past Herford, also his only goal of the season, less
than two minutes into the overtime period for the ultimate

end to the game and the season. Fans stormed the field following the goal as Swarthmore earned the ECAC Southern
Regional championship and Wagner was subjected to the
traditional Gatorade dunking.
"It was amazing, I was so busy running around getting
nuts myself that I didn't realize how quickly the crowd got
on the field, how many of [them] there were," Wagner said.
For his sons, the dunking will be the most memorable
moment of the championship win. "My two little boys were
standing there pointing at me and laughing and laughing,"
he said. "They'll never forget it."
It was the team's first ECAC championship ever after trying for the past four years, and the squad's overall record of
14-3-3 gave it the best winning percentage since 1966. "I think
the most remarkable thing about this particular season is
that the seniors on this team have won 50 games in their
career," Wagner said, "and to think the year before they got
here the team won five games. So they've really been the cat-

for an incredibly turnaround."
"I'm still trying to soak it in and realize what happened,"
Christmas said. "You can really say it's kind of a dream

come true. After such a roller coaster season, to finally culminate in that one game in the final seconds is unbelievable."
"[As] a senior going out on this note you can't really ask
for a much better note," Sutcliffe said. "I know we could have
what a conference championship or what have you, but this,
to win the last game at home, is something really special,
and it's definitely something I'll never forget."
