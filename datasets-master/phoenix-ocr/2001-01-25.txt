Players transfer in wake of football cut
BY ELIZABETH HANSEN
After learning that the sport they were recruited to play
was deemed not viable by the Board of Managers, many football players have been quietly making plans to leave
Swarthmore —and some already have.
"The reason why I'm transferring is that I truly felt betrayed by the board's decision. I don't want to be a part of a
community that feels it must limit the amount of students
who can be athletes. I'm interested in getting the best education possible while still maintaining the opportunity to play
football," Kevin Perry 'O4 said.
Perry and some of his teammates are applying to places
like Williams, Amherst, the University of Pennsylvania,
Brown University, Davidson, Middlebury, Trinity, Carnegie
Mellonand Washington and Lee. Nearly all are transferring
to play football.
Lane Oatey 'O3 has now decided to transfer to a school
where he can play football, though at first he wanted to transfer to a large university just to leave Swarthmore. "I talked
with my family and friends and decided it was important
for me to take advantage of the opportunity to play football
[at another college]," he said.
A flurry of recruiting by coaches at other schools began
almost immediately following the Board of Manager's Dec.
2 decision to cut the football program. Grinnelle-mailed football captain Scott Murray 'Ol soon after the decision, asking
him to notify his teammates that the college was interested
in recruits. Colby's football coach called Ken Clark 'O3 after
Clark's picture appeared in a Dec. 5 New York Times article
about the Board of Manager's decision.
The football coaching staff and Athletic Director Bob
Williams have been acting as intermediaries between players and the colleges they are interested in. Bob Williams has
been sending letters and making phone calls to the coaches
of other colleges, effectively helping those coaches recruit
the players.
"Obviously we want [the players] to stay, but if they want
to leave, we want to help them in any way possible," he said.
For some players, the transfer process is complete or near

completion. Alex Karnal 'O3 begins classes at the MIT on Feb.
6. Joe Corso 'O2 has already begun the semester at the University of Pennsylvania. The application process to Johns
Hopkins University continues for Nick Loiacono 'O3, though
he has chosen to leave Swarthmore while he waits to hear
from the university.
Some other football players are in the late stages of applying for transfer. Perry, who was recruited by Amherst
just a year ago, is now finishing his Amherst transfer application for the Feb. 1 deadline. Because students need a year
of college experience in order to transfer schools, he was
unable to leave Swarthmore after the fall semester. He is
hoping to hear back early from Amherst about his application so he won't have to apply elsewhere. Like Perry, Clark
is considering a couple of schools, but he has heardfrom the

he can play football and has heard from the head coach and admissions staff there.

football coach and admissions staff at Williams that his
application looks good.
Players say that they are taking into account academic
prestige as well as football in their consideration of which
colleges to apply to. Perry said that many colleges were
interested in him that had good football programs but less
academic rigor than Swarthmore.
Citing Williams' number three ranking in US News and
World Report compared to Swarthmore's number two ranking, Clark said, "it's not much of a step down." He was
recruited and accepted by Williams out of high school.
Swarthmore will keep some players here, however. Dan
Chamberlain 'O4 has not started looking for colleges and is

leaning towards staying. "The academics are better here
than at other schools. The academics are why I cam here
for the best possible education. Football is how I got in, but
-

academics come before football," he said.
Reasons beyond academics may induce many freshman
to stay. For some freshmen, Perry said, Swarthmore is the
only place they could have played football. Many feel they
won't have a competitive edge at other schools, since even
here, very few freshmen got playing time this year. "If you
can't play at Swarthmore, there is not a good chance that

Student sues LSAT over testing time limit
BY IVAN BOOTHE
Jared Solomon 'Ol has won a suit against
the administrators of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), granting him extended
time due to a learning disability. The Law
SchoolAdmission Council (LSAC) had initially given Solomon an extra hour and a
half on the three-and-a-half-hour test, but
Solomon requested just over ten hours to
complete the exam.
Solomon's learning disability is Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). This disease
affects three to five percent of all children,
according to the National Institute ofMedical Health, and, in many cases, carries over
into adulthood. In its basic form, it is characterized by inattention-and impulsivity.
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,
(ADHD) includes the same symptoms as
ADD as well as hyperactivity.
The qualifications for being diagnosed

with ADD or ADHD, however, are extremely
specific, according to the Institute. "Behaviors
must appear before age seven and continuefor
at least six months," the Institute Web site says,
"and they must be more severe than similar
behaviors from other children their age." In
addition, a person's behavior must create a
handicap in more than one situation; a child
who is overly active only at school would not
be diagnosed with the disorder.
Dean Myrt Westphal, who serves as the
Coordinator for Services for Students with
Disabilities, said that the college has a num-

ber of different options in place for students
with ADD/ADHD. "It might include things like
having more time on an exam, taking the exam
in a quiet, non-distracting place, special housing placement, a study room in McCabe, or it
could even involve things like note-takers in
class," she said.
Westphal noted that college students may
have ADD, but, because ofthe lack ofhyperac-

tivity, it may not have been noticed before.
"Many times it will be after the grades come,
in the spring, and a student will say, 'Oh, I
thought I understood that so well, but I'm doing so badly,'" she said.
Westphal said that some testing for the disorders were available at the college but that
diagnoses generally came from the students'
doctors at home.
Solomon, however, had known about his
disorder since he was a child. But, he said, "I
was very reluctant to tellpeople... I didn't want
to make it public. I thought it would be better
to try and accomplish everything."
Initially, Solomon said that he had tried to
become very involved, pursuing his academic
interests. "Unfortunately, because of the
workload, I wasn't able to do that," he said. In
the spring of his sophomore year, he spoke to
Westphal about his concerns. She wrote a letter for him, which he showed each ofhis professors that semester.

THE

"Everything changed," Solomon said, "I
was able to turn in things I was proud of."
When he registered for the LSAT,
Solomon was required to submit a battery
oftests documenting his condition. Westphal
says that she offers certification to theLSAC
proving that a student has received particular accommodations at the college.
Many exams, including the SAT and the
Graduate Records Examination (GRE), require a school to show that a student has
received the same accommodations there
that he or she is requesting on the exam.
The GRE, in addition, requires "a comprehensive psychoeducational or neuropsychological assessment" as well as medical and
"psychosocial" histories. "The exploration
of possible alternatives that may mimic a
cognitive disability when, in fact, one is not
present" is also required for special disabil-

Board of Managers
reaffirms decision
BY LELLIE DREMEAUX
The Board of Managers reconvened in New York
City on Jan. 4 and reaffirmed their decision to cut
football and wrestling and alter the status ofbadminton.
According to a policy statute, the board must hold
a special meeting if five of its members request it.
Such meetings, said Director of News and Information Tom Krattenmaker, "do not happen very often."
Due to the recent outcry over the board's choice to
instate the Athletic Review Committee's recommendation about the college's sports, a request for the
meeting was made in late December, and the board
met for three hours at the Dale Carnegie Institute
shortly thereafter.
"The discussion centered on football," said President Al Bloom. The board considered perspectives
expressed by alumni and the wider Swarthmore community through last month's storm of letters, phone
calls, speeches and e-mails. Bloom said that "views
on all sides of the issue were strongly expressed."
In the end, however, the board members let their
verdict stand about the new structure of the athletic
program. No vote took place, but a general sense
among the board members led them not to reexamine their actions of last month.
"There was a clear sense that they would not reconsider the decision or reopen the matter,"
Krattenmaker said, although "the spirits and arguments from both sides were considered." He added
that discussion, not voting, is standard procedure
for the Board of Managers.
After the meeting, Board Chair Larry Shane '56
said that following "extensive discussion, the board
decided that it would not revise or alter our decision. I was pleased with the informed and thoughtful discussion. Our task is now to move forward together to strengthen the continuing intercollegiate
athletic program."
Although the Associated Press implied in its
sports brief about the January meeting that the board
met in response to the requests of some alumni for
their monetary gifts to be returned, Bloom said those
requests played no role in the choice to reconvene,
nor did the board base the reaffirmation ofits position on college sports on those requests.
"The College is dependent on alumni support and
we are saddened by the few alums who have asked
that their gifts be returned," he said, "but the Board

made its decision on the basis of what it believed
was right for the institution."
Neil Austrian '6L who proposed an alternative
plan to the ARC proposal and threatened to resign if
football was not reinstated, declined comment.

good athletes. They would have a shot
on Swarthmore's team when they were
upperclassmen," he said. "But they
would have a hard time on other teams.
Realistically, I think that is what's made
their decision [to stay], not an attachment to the school."
Clark suggested that financial aid is
keeping some players from transferring.
"There is good financial aid here. [Players] might not get aid as good as here
anywhere else. Financially, they just
don't have the option of transferring,"

he said.
ChrisLoeffler 'O4 estimates that overall, "a minority of students will transfer. Out of 40 freshmen, sophomores,
and seniors, probably only 10 to 15 will
go. But more will keep their options

Kevin Perry and Ken Clark are submitting transfer applications to schools like
Williams and Amherst, both of which recruited them in high school.

The options for juniors seem to be a
bit more constrained. Even though
Corso has transferred, many other juniors
are considering
leaving
Swarthmore just for the fall semester of
their senior year. Doug Kneeland 'O2
plans to get an internship or do an exchange semester at a school with a football team. He guessed that 90 percent of
juniors will go to some other school to
play football in the fall.

Associate Dean for Student Life Tedd
Goundie concurred, and added that
some may also choose to go abroad.
The college has been doing what it
can to help the players think through
the transfer decision and to make the
application process easier. Clark and
Perry say that they are grateful to their
professors for compiling recommendations.
Goundie said that he has been coun-

seling football players as they make decisions about what to do now that the
program is gone. He has been contacting deans of schools that players are
considering and writing recommendations for the players' applications. To
help them make a decision about transferring, he is discussing with players
how they are feeling about the decision
and what they want from their college
experience.

FROM THE PHOENIX ONLINE

Badminton's future remains unclear
This report first published Dec. 22 in The Phoenix's
continuing online coverage of the athletics cuts.

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
A meeting of the women's badminton team with administrators proved to be a good forum for dialogue about the Board
of Managers' recent decision to demote the varsity team to
club status. The future of the team remains unclear.
Captains Jane Ng 'Ol, Carty and Lange, along with players
Wury Morris 'O4 and Russell Gordley 'O2, met with the President Al Bloom, Provost Jennie Keith and Athletic Director
Bob Williams on December 15 to discuss the team's status.
The badminton players have already begun their season
and will continue to compete as a varsity team this year. The
question of whether the Board of Managers will act on its
decision to make the team a club sport next year has remained

unanswered.
"Al Bloom told us the ARC [Athletic Review Committee]
is meeting next semester to discuss the status of club teams,"
Carty said.
The administrators told the team that the reason the board
had demoted badminton was to make a clear distinction between teams that recruit and those that do not. According to
their plan, badminton should not be a club sport, not a varsity one, because it does not recruit.
But Bloom said thatthe ARC would conduct "a fullreview
of the club sport program over the next semester" and that
they "may want to reexamine the premise that only sports
which receive support in the of admissions spaces can remain in the intercollegiate program."
Originally, he said, the committee "felt comfortable placing badminton outside the intercollegiate program because
it was doing so well without that form of support."
The administrators also told the team that the ARC wanted
to ensure extra benefits, such as funding and a full-time coach,

for the varsity teams, but that they did not want to provide
these additional resources for badminton.
Still, they promised, the team would continue to benefit
from all the prerequisites it currently has: funding, a parttime coach, and priority over club teams for practice space.
The administrators also told the athletes that with football, badmintonand wrestling cut, Swarthmore is in compliance with Title IX, a federal statute that mandates equal resources for men's and women's sports and a fair ratio of men
to women athletes. But they also do not know if reinstating
badminton, which requires little funding and few players,
would place Swarthmore out of compliance with the statute.
Presently, the athletic department gives financial support
to varsity teams, including badminton. The board has promised to continue this funding. But money allotted to club
sports falls under the jurisdiction of the Student Budget Committee (SBC), not the board, so there is presently no system
under which they could guarantee such funding to a club
badminton team.
"The infrastructure is not there for what they're promising right now," Lange said. Marvin Barron 'O2, president of
the SBC, said that his committee "hasn't been consulted about
this...if [badminton] becomes club sport, there's no guarantee that they'll be chartered...if they come to us, hopefully
we'll give them the same consideration as we give the other
sports."

As it stands now, the SBC allots $36,000 to club sports, with
$lO,OOO coming from the Athletic Department.
Bloom said the ARC and board "certainly have to assure
reliable, continuing funding for badminton.
"Depending on the outcome of the review of club sports
we may in fact want to accomplish that as part of a new approach to funding all club sports, withincreased support consistent with budgetary resources and with what club sport

Upgraded bandwidth shaper
allows faster connections
BY GERRIT HALL

Information Technology Services upgraded the bandwidth shaper over winter break, allowing greater flexibility in

from faster network connections.
"Students are, in fact, getting much

Systems Mark Dumic.

At the final Student Council meeting before winter break,
SC voted to approve a $37 raise in the Student Activities Fee
segment of tuition. If approved, this will be the second year
in a row in which the SAF has been raised.
The idea to raise the SAF, which goes toward funding student groups and activities, was originally formulated two years
ago. According to Student Budget Committee treasurer Marvin
Barron 'O2, it came in response to the news that the Capital
Replacement Fund, which was to have $450, 000 to $500,000,
was depleted. In fact, it was $16,000 dollars in debt, since deficit spending had been occurring for some time.
The Capital Replacement Fund purchases much of the
equipment for various uses around campus. "We are worried
about whatis going to happen when the equipment we bought
this year wears out," Barron said.
In order to regain part of the money that was in the fund, it
was suggested that the SAF be raised.

gives higher priority to non-residence
computers usually used for academic
purposes. However, he said, "We don't

condone doing anything on the network
that involves violation of copyright."
Dumic noted that he is trying to
"maximize the system" in order to obtain the most possible use from it.
Because Swarthmore was one of the
first organizations to use the technology
of the company that provided the new
bandwidth shaper, the college acquired
it free of cost.

The increase in the SAF was designed to be a two-part
project. The first was last year's $24 increase in the SAF to
$250. With this year's proposed $37 raise to $287, it is hoped
that by the 2003-2004 academic year, the Capital Replacement

Fund will have around $lOO,OOO.
In order to become a reality, the College Budget Committee must approve the proposal. It will probably make its decision within a few weeks. Aside from raising the SAF, one
proposal to regain money is to move the Halcyon or to reduce it in quality or size. The proposed SAF raise would net
roughly $50,000, which is the same amount the school would
save by moving the Halcyon.
Barron said that, although raising the SAF was not an
ideal move, it was important that the Capital Replacement
Fund be filled. Only a small portion of the increase in the
SAF will go toward funding student groups. As a member of
the Student Budget Committee, he indicated that it was unfortunate to have to tell student groups, '"No, there isn't that
money,' especially on this campus."

Learning disability spurs suit for more test time

ity accommodations on the test.
LSAC offered Solomon an extra hour
and 45 minutes oftime on the exam, plus a
separate room with other learning-disabled
students and two breaks. "They didn'tmeet
what was set by my psychiatrist," Solomon
said. He stressed that he did not simply "sit

down with a notebook and come up with
these numbers."Solomon received evaluationsfrom his psychiatrist recommending
the accommodations, and a second psychiatristconcurred.
In addition, Solomon said, LSAC offered
no explanation forthe particular accommodations they had given him only days before his scheduled test last December. Although he went ahead with the test,
Solomon simultaneously acquired a lawyer
and filed suit against the company, requesting the full amount of time requested by
his psychiatrist.
Initially, therequested time was over 20
hours. After Solomon took the first exam
in December, however, he realized that this

was more than he needed. "Immediately,
when I saw it was too much, I told my attorney, 'We have to reduce this,"' Solomon
said. The initial amount was his
psychiatrist's best estimate.
"I wanted to be reasonable," Solomon
said, adding, "I was not looking in any way
for an unfair advantage."
"I'm sure lots of claims that go into
LSAC are completely fraudulous,"
Solomon said. He noted, however, that the
person who evaluates special accommodations claims for LSAC has been sued several times because she "has absolutely no
background with learning disabilities
and she had no communication with me."
Solomon was worried about the
evaluator's subjectivity. Unfortunately,
Westphal said, accommodating students
with learning disabilities "is not an exact
science."
On Tuesday, LSAC settled the lawsuit
by agreeing to grant Solomon his full accommodations request, including the extended time, a 15-minutebreak every two
hours, the use ofscratch paper, and the abil-

with increased support consistent with budgetary
resources and with what club sport participants
want the college to do.
"My impression," he added, is that club sports
very much value their organizational independence,
but they might like some greater institutional financial support."
The badminton team also expressed concern
about its potential viability as a club sport. Carty
pointed out that the club teams that have been successful on campus-ultimate frisbee and rugby-can
delegate various responsibilities to their large number of players. Badminton has only fifteen players,
seven of them varsity.
"It's more difficult to organize," Carty said. "And
we already have difficulty getting court space from
the basketball team."
Another major concern of the badminton players has been whether they would be able to play in
their conference as a club team next year. "We can
play in our conference," Lange said. "The fact of
the matter is, [the Board of Managers] didn't know
that when they made their decision."
During the meeting on Friday, Dec. 15, the administrators told the team that "if it was impossible
for [the team] to do what we do now, they would
think things through again," Lange said.
But if the board can indeed guarantee funds, facilities and a coach to a club badminton team, team
members say the demotion would still have an effect. The varsity letter enables women's badminton
to be self-recruiting, Lange said. Many students who
played badminton in high school are to Swarthmore
because they have a chance to letter in the game
there.
Bloom called the players' commitment to maintain their team's ability to self-recruit "a strong ar-

gument."

The Swarthmore badminton team also feels that
a varsity label shows commitment to the sport on a
national level. At present, the NCAA recognizes badminton as an "emerging sport for women" with the
intent that it will become a full-fledged NCAA sport
some day. There are three colleges in the U.S., all
Division 111, with teams under this status.
"We're trying to help this sport emerge," Lange
said. She said she felt an obligation to try to keep
her team in the NCAA for this reason and that "pulling out would not help matters." She also pointed
out that club badminton teams are popular at other
schools, but there is not enough of a draw for them
to join the NCAA.
Another motivation for the team to try to maintain its varsity status is the chance it provides for
students to letter in a brand new sport.
"You don't need that background in athletic specialization to become very good very quickly,"
Lange said. As a part of a Division 111 school, she
said, the board should remember that it is supposed
to foster these kinds of opportunities.
For now, the team's future is uncertain.
"It was the Board's intent not to diminish the
opportunities open to our badminton players,"
Bloom said, "and we will honor that intent. The earliest I see any change in the status of the team would
be after the ARC completes its work at the end of
the coming spring semester."

College brings zoning
requests before ville
planning commission
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
The college has rescinded a letter requesting that
the Swarthmore Borough Council rezone several portions of college-owned land following a meeting with
members of the council and the head of the town's

planning commission.
The planning commission is about to consider the
zoning requests, making it "no longer necessary or
appropriate for the college to make a special request,"
Vice President for Facilities and Services Larry

Schall said.
The original request, made to the borough in September, asked that some of the land the college owns
on the edges of campus be rezoned from residential
to institutional use.
The request was made in light of the proposed
Swarthmore hotel. If the hotel is built—which officials from both the college and the borough view as
mutually beneficial—the college would have fewer
acres ofland zoned for institutional use and less flex-

ibility in the future.
The nature of the request was troubling to some
borough residents and council members. Some felt
it was inappropriate to alter zoning designations as
a sort of trade linked to the planned hotelrather than
to request zoning changes through the town's planning process.
In its current form, borough council member Don
Delson said, the college's request is "perfectly appropriate."
At the February 12 meeting of the borough council, the planning commission will be charged to explore the requests, Delson said. The main question
the commission will consider is whether there ought
to be more or less flexibility given to the college for
land on the edges of the campus. The commission
will present any changes to current zoning it recommends to the borough council for approval later this
year.

According to Delson, however, it would be naive
to assume the zoning issues have been entirely
decoupled from the plans for the inn. Now, he proclaimed, they are just "less obviously linked."
Schall added that both the borough and college
are "on the same page" regarding the hotel, though
there are many complex issues they still need to work
through.
Steps towards planning the hotel are "on target,"
Schall said. The governor recently signed legislation that would allow the borough to hold a referendum to grant a liquor license to the proposed hotel.
At its January 8 meeting, the borough council
decided to try to place the referendum on the May
ballot. The borough has taken it upon itself to collect the required number of signatures before the
March 6 deadline.
Delson predicted there would no difficulty collecting enough signatures.

Participants in the Winter Institute had time to build trust, allowing them to dicuss a wide-range of issues relating to
multiculturalism on a personal level. This was the first year the Winter Institute was a Tri-Co event.

Winter Institute explores multicultural issues
BY HOFAN CHAU
For three and a half days before the
semester began, 53 participants in the
Multicultural Winter Institute had an op-

portunity to engage with people ofdifferent backgrounds as they examined their
feelings about oppression.
Discussions were wide-ranging, covering race, anti-Semitism, dual ethnicity,

skin color, stereotypes and

systematic

oppression. Issues such as race, class,
sexual orientation, gender, and religion
became personalized. Because the Winter Institute was several days long, participants had time to build trust and reflect deeply.
While modelsof oppression and racial
development were presented, facilitators
made the issues intimate as well as intel-

lectual by expressing themselves and
sharing their experiences.

tors and participants reported were personal. Facilitator Zara Joffes trusts that
the participants will "do something" with
the experience.
She returns every year to facilitate
because it's fulfilling for her to see the
participants "really investing and taking
risks to share themselves in the fullest
way."
Her facilitating partner, Taalibah
Kariem-White, thinks that college is a
time for students to be "fermenting their
identity" and hopes to move students to
a place of self-exploration.
Assistant Dean and Gender Education
Adviser Karen Henry, who has been behind the program since its start in 1993,
said that the aim of the Institute is "to

trainpeople to lead on campus on issues
of diversity." The record so far is impressive: graduates have been responsible for
creating the Diversity Coalition; Dialogues, weekly dorm-based discussion
groups; the freshman diversity play
workshops; and Knapsackers, as well as
the Chester Road Pre-Orientation community service program. This does not
include the number of participants who
continue to work in the existing diversity groups.

Participants themselves said skilled
facilitation allowed them to understand
themselves better.

Gloria Chan'O2 said that it enabled her

to see "what issues pushed my buttons,
which issues brought out which emotions
It was an incredible way to understand
more about myself."
Out of the many exercises, role-playing, involving masks, was one of the most
memorable for participants. Emily
Chavez 'O3 said it allowed her to see "how
easily I accept rules that are given to me
how quickly I take them in and don't
think about breaking them."
In this case, the rules of the role-play
were modelled to grant privileges to the
'unmasked' over the 'masked,' forcing
participants to contemplate their privileges or lack thereof in the structure of
society.
For some, such as Nathan Wessler 'O4,
it was a role reversal to experience the
feelingof being oppressed. For others, like
Henry, it was a chance to recognize the
difficulty of being a privileged person trying to earn the trust of the people they
were oppressing.

“I see Swat as having good intentions

Joffes.
This is the first year that the Winter
Institute has been Tri-College instead of
Swarthmore-based.
While the larger group pushed the facilitators to ensure enough space for everyone to share their experiences, it also

Indeed, this seemed to be the case for
Laurel Kean ’O3, who previously came to
realize that “there are other people who

Activism can feel like a long struggle,
and the chance to connect with people,
especially on such an honest level, was
precious to the participants. Chan described the Winter Institute as, for her,
simply a “refuelling point.”

Student group holds discussion on living wage for staff
Swarthmore Staff Wage Study Group seeks to encourage wages for staff that would allow self-sufficiency
BY GABRIEL HETLAND
About a dozen students from the Swarthmore Staff Wage
Study Group (SSWSG), along with several staff and faculty members, met in a Parrish classroom with members
of the College Budget Committee (CBC) in mid-December
to discuss the issue of a living wage for Swarthmore's staff.
While the football controversy was occupying center
stage, student activists and staff members were concerned
about another battle, which also touched on the issue of
who gets to participate in making decisions affecting the
college.
Currently, the college sets staff wages by looking at national and regional labor markets. The hourly wage of a
Sharpies card checker or a dorm housekeeper is calculated
based on what is employers pay to workers in similar positions in the area and around the country. The college justifies the wages here by pointing to similar rates elsewhere.
The lower-wage job categories in Swarthmore's fiscal
year 2000 pay scale have hiring minimums ranging from
$5.36 to $8.53 per hour; many Sharpies workers, even those
who have worked at the College for a number of years, earn
between $7 and $9 per hour.
At the December meeting, students and staff from
SSWSG told the CBC that such wages are not enough to
live on. Members of the group talked for over two hours
with Associate Vice President and Director of Human Re-

sources Melanie Young, Dean of Finance and CBC Chair Paul
Aslanian and others from the CBC about creating a "living
wage" for Swarthmore's staff.
Members of SSWSG say that current wages are simply not
adequate to maintain oneself or a family, given that staff must
pay for food, housing, transportation, taxes, and health and
child care.
Following criteria put forward by Women's Association for
Women's Alternatives (WAWA), an organization based in the
Borough of Swarthmore, group member Sam Blair 'O2 defined
a living wage as one that "allows a person to be self-sufficient,
to meet all her needs without government support."
The particular wage that allows for self-sufficiency is variable, noted Blair, and depends on the size of the family as well
as the regional and local costs of living. As such, it is difficult
to pinpoint a specific dollar amount that would give all workers self-sufficiency, but estimates of such a wage range from
$lO to $l5 per hour. Blair cited WAWA's 1998 Self-Sufficiency
Study, which found that a single parent would need to make

COULD LOOK TO.
Swarthmore has taken the lead among small liberal arts
colleges in creating and maintaining a diverse campus, it
should set examples in other areas, they said, rather than
hiding behind the argument that the market demands
wages that are insufficient to live on.
Besides the immediate goal of increased wages, the
meeting raised more long-term issues about participation
in decision-making structures and creating a more democratic workplace.
Blair noted that this coming month will be very busy,
as the CBC must complete its budget before the February
meeting of the Board of Managers.

about $l3 per hour to achieve self-sufficiency.
Defenders of Swarthmore's policies have asked what the
college can reasonably be expected to pay given the current
level of market wages, even if the wages it offers are not suffi-

cient to live on.
Blair and others claimed that Swarthmore has the potential and the moral responsibility to set a "model wage" that
other colleges and employers could look to. Just as

Lunch back in the bag

The bag lunch program will return on
Tuesday of next week.
"We are pleased to be able to bring
this convenience back to the students
again," said Linda McDougall, Director
of Dining Services.
The program had been suspended

because a C-BORD card swiper had
been stolen from Sharpies. It was

returned anonymously to McDougall's
office on Dec. 6.
The bag lunch program is a quick
alternative to other lunch options. It is
available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
and Thursdays weekly, starting at 12:30
p.m. on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Swarthmore Police Report
A home on Drexel Place was broken into through a back door on Friday. An
undetermined number of music compact discs and a pillowcase were burglarized.
An automobile accident occurred at S. Chester Road and Yale Ave. on Monday.
Upon arrival at the scene, the police found a car which had been driven off the road
onto the sidewalk, resting against a utility pole. The driver said he had tried to stop
for a slow-moving vehicle and slid on the wet pavement. The driver was asked to
perform several field sobriety tests. He refused and was arrested and charged with
driving under the influence of alcohol.
Two thefts, one burglary and one attempted burglary were reported at the
college.
Four citations were issued for underage drinking and public drunkenness, and
there was one arrest for possession of marijuana.

Time for healing now
With the Board of Managers' decision to cut
football, badminton and wrestling a fait accompli after
its Jan. 4 meeting, it no longer makes sense to debate
the decision as news. Let us now consider it history,
and instead dedicate our efforts to reuniting a divided,
emotional community.
Whether the decision turns out good or bad for
Swarthmore will not be apparent until five or 10 years
from now. Perhaps in the intervening years, we will
rue the decision and bring back the football program,
as Villanova did in the 1980s. Or maybe the cuts will be
seen in as positive a light as the revitalization of the
Honors program. Like the beleaguered election, all we
can learn from it now is how not to make a decision
and create a system to keep decision-making like this

from happening again.
Just as the responsibility of uniting a divided
country and Senate rests in President Bush's hands,
the task of healing a college wounded in the paroxysms

of internal strife now falls to the administrators,
faculty and board members who supported the cuts.
With the "hard questions" answered, the college's
leaders must now follow through on their promises
improved athletic resources and facilities, more
coaches and a dedicated attempt to preserve the social
culture we have grown to appreciate.
Swarthmore's response was not the only possible
response. But any response will disappoint someone
and cause problems. What differentiates a good
response from a bad response is the way it is handled.
So far the college has done a poor job, but there is still
plenty of time to improve.
There are also other reasons why the decision was
made, ones that we suspect will look far more compelling in time. Much has been made ofSwarthmore's
"last stand," its status as the final bastion of amateurism in America. The waves of professionalism against
which we reacted so violently (the decision has been
described as "cutting off the arm to save the body") are
undeniably inundating the nation, and every liberal
arts college is attempting to deal with the problems
they bring. It's not just about football or sports it's
about computer science, journalism, economics,
English and academia as a whole.
There is no doubt that, faced with the challenge of
reconciling liberal arts ideals with professional
pressures, a line must be drawn. We have drawn it
boldly, and now we are dealing with the consequences.
Many critics of the athletics cuts have claimed that
the Swarthmore they love is not the Swarthmore of
today. They are wrong.
Swarthmore may not be the same college it once
was. But college used to be for men only. Swarthmore
helped change that. And college used be mainly for
white people. Swarthmore helped change that, too. And
athletic culture has always been central to college.
Maybe Swarthmore is helping change that as well.
While the college itself may change, the idea of
Swarthmore stays the same. Swarthmore has always
been socially conscious and has always been bold.
Swarthmore is constantly changing to maintain the
same position on the social and cultural landscape. It
remains for history to determine whether the college's
latest move brings it closer to the Swarthmore ideal.

Inclusive solution
In the past, The Phoenix has urged the Computing
Center to pursue a common sense solution to the
bandwidth problem. In a smart move, they have taken
our suggestion to come up with a creative answer to the
problem. The new policy is smart. Students can now
access the Internet at faster speeds without impeding
academic concerns and without backing up the system.
Research still gets the priority it needs. Furthermore,
students can receive these faster speeds at the time they
use the most bandwidth for downloads. In this way, the
CC has adequately addressed the needs ofall parties
involved in a solution everyone can agree with.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Slots cause academic insecurity

Cuts reflect Bloom's vision for Swat

Dear Editor:
The fundamental problem in the so-called "process" that
the student uproar over football has illuminated is not that
Swarthmore's administration acts with too much secrecy, but
rather with not enough. Looking past the reactive anger in
recruited athletes' comments during these discussions, I am
left seeing a deep insecurity about their roles as student-athletes. This insecurity is well deserved! To know that you were
admitted to Swarthmore as a "slot" is to know that you were
not held to the same academic standard as your classmates;
this must be a horrible feeling. The administration should
make the slot system less explicit so that recruited athletes
can feel like full students. It should simultaneously keep its
promises to help other athletic teams, like the men's track
team, which is currently a fine team due to the amazing talent of athletes like walk-on Marc Jeuland 'Ol, but will need
serious help next year.

Last spring, I attended a cocktail party at Dan West's
house, and I had a lengthy conversation with Al Bloom
about football. At one point in the conversation, I said that
there was no reason Swarthmore couldn't be like Williams
or Amherst. Bloom said that Swarthmore was not Williams
or Amherst and did not want to become a Williams or
Amherst. I was shocked at the time, and I asked why would
we not want to be like the schools he so clearly worried
about in U.S. News and World Report.
He replied that Swarthmore was a college for what he
termed "the marginalized students of the world." I asked
him to define "marginalized students," and he said that
they were the students who were very smart but were social outcasts in high school, specifically those often picked
on in high school by the athletes! He then repeated that, in

his view, Swarthmore is, and should be, a school for those
intelligent students who are out of the mainstream.
Bloom is trying to make Swarthmore his little world
not truly a place that welcomes diversity.

had an epiphany as I passed Fenway Park.
"THIS is our year, we are going to win
the WorldSeries! Manny! Nomar! Pedro!
Yeah!"
And I realized, part of what makes
this country great is I can have as a retarded a belief as I want and I'm allowed
to have it. I can give all my money to a
bizarre religious cult or fling it out a
window if I want. I can look like a moron standing in a ghetto park being

laughed at by everyone passing by. You
can protest to support these people, if
that's your perogative.
To me, a full-blooded Chinese person,
the idea of Falun Dafa is completely ludicrous, as it seems to be to many Chinese people not involved in it, as I discovered in talking to my parents and

relatives and their friends. But unless
they do something like try and overthrow the government, they should ab-

solutely have every right to practice.
So, keep protesting and supporting. I'll
keep believing that this is Pedro's year.
Your right to protest something happening half a world away is fundamental. I
just hope it's the supression of human
rights you are protesting, and that you
honestly believe this is a harmless activity, which I must say not a lot of neutral
Chinese I've talked to think it is.
Religion isfme and dandy until people
start getting killed, and China has quite
a history with the Taiping, Boxer and

White Lotus Rebellions. Millions died as
a result of those "spiritualities" gone
awry, and Falun shares many characteristics in common. Could Falun Dafa take
on similar proportions? Apparently, Chinese officials believe so. I am always hesitant to defend theChinese government because of their record, but clearly there is
a historical precident here.
In closing, this should
be about human rights. I
believe if it were, it would
have infinitely more credibility. As a result of the
minimal credibility Falun
Dafa has, both the group
and its supporters in the
state are perceived as zealots themselves. People will
not laugh at human rights.

So if GeorgeW. Bush wants an attorney general who

attorney general only for a cruel social experiment, but
'bid Quincy" has other ideas. And that's OK!
If Bush wants a national security team that thinks
the Cold War is still on, I'm sure they can make it
come back. And if he wants a secretary of the interior who prefers "pay polluter" to "polluter pay," I'm
willing to overlook that as a symptom of dyslexia.
Those things are both OK.

cans, six

Asian-Americans, and three Latino/as among
the 160 faculty members in tenure-track positions.
Although studies show that in the past decade most

American institutions of higher education have made little
headway in the area of faculty diversity, this has not been
the case at Swarthmore, according to interviews with faculty members and administrators. Recent initiatives at
the administrative, departmental, and studentlevels have
been aimed at broadening the pool of minority applicants
and thus bringing more minority faculty members to the
college. In particular, the Minority Scholars in Residence
Program, which provides fellowships for pre and postdoctoral minority scholars, receives high praise from administrators and department chairs who say that it has
played an important part in attracting faculty of color to
the college.
Despite the considerable progress the college has made
toward diversifying the faculty, however, the concensus
among departmental chairs and minority faculty is that
more work remains to be done, and that the college must
not relax its current efforts to recruit faculty of color. Minority faculty are still underrepresented at Swarthmore,
they say, particularly Latino/a faculty and those in the

natural sciences.
The ongoing effort to diversify the faculty is critical
because it introduces students to perspectives that they
might not otherwise have encountered, according to faculty and students. "Diversity changes the entire way
people learn," Bradley said. "They're in contact with cultures, experiences, and ways of thinking that make it dif-

ficult to stay the same."

This diversity of viewpoints strikes at the core of

Swarthmore's role as an institution of higher education.
"Because of the things that Swarthmore students go on to
do, they need to be aware and open to the fact that insight
and depth come from all different perspectives," said economics professor Philip Jefferson. "We can't accomplish the full
mission of the college unless we accomplish certain things
with regard to the faculty."
Moreover, minority students and some professors emphasized that a significant minority presence among faculty often makes students of color feel more comfortable.
"It helps to feel that there are others presenting a challenge to what could be the dominant mentality," Spanish professor Aurora Camacho de Schmidt said. "If we have significant numbers, it's good for all of us, including white faculty
and students."
Yet faculty of color stressed that they do not see themselves solely in terms of their status as a minority. "I don't
view myself as: I'm here because I'm a minority faculty member," Jefferson said. "My record will show that I'm more than
qualified. I'm lucky to be here at Swarthmore, and
Swarthmore is lucky to have me here. I think that's true for
all minority faculty here."

strategies the college is using to recruit minority faculty.

members, the degree of progress the college has made in recruiting and retaining faculty of color, and the challenges
the college faces in trying to diversify its faculty.

HISTORY OF FACULTY DIVERSITY
The history of faculty diversity at Swarthmore to some
extent reflects larger societal changes that have occurred
over the past forty years. A study conducted by the Julius
Rosenwald Fund in 1941 found only two black professors
teaching at universities that were not predominantly black.
With the advent of the
Civil Rights movement
and the adoption of affirmative action legislation in the sixties, faculty of color began
to enter colslowly
leges and universities
across the country.
Swarthmore hired
its first black faculty
member, professor
emerita of history
Kathryn Morgan, in
the early 19705. Morgan describes her experience at Swarthmore,
including the racism
she encountered, in the
September2000 edition

of the Swarthmore Bulletin. Initially denied

tenure, Morgan joined
a class-action suit
against the college.
Morgan won the suit
and went on to teach at
the college for 20 years.
But even after Morgan received tenure,
the move toward a
more diverse faculty
was slow. English pro-

fessor and department chair Chuck James recalled that for a
long time there were no more than five black faculty members on campus. There were no Latino/a professors until the
late 19705.
Under the leadership of provost Jim England, the college
began to make aggressive efforts to recruit minority faculty.
In the 19705, the faculty established a goal of hiring ten black
faculty members in tenure track positions, which has since
been reaffirmed several times. England also offered additional
incentives for departments to hire minority faculty members.
For instance, biology professor and chair Mark Jacobs said
that his department was granted funds for a new faculty position on the condition that three of the six finalists for that
position be viable minority candidates.

HERE.”

In February 1998, the faculty adopted a broader resolution concerning faculty diversity thatdoes not set numberical

goals. The resolution states: “For the sake of furthering

Swarthmore College’s community and educational values,
the faculty endorses that Departments and Programs in the
College, with the help of the Administration, take the necessary and appropriate steps so that within a decade we may
see a significant increase in the racial and ethnic diversity
of the college.”
COLLEGE-WIDE INITIATIVES
In addition to the resolution, the college has introduced specific initiatives to bring minority faculty members to the college. For instance, after meeting a minority scholar at a professional conference, Swarthmore faculty may invite that person
to the college to give a talk or teach a course, according to provost Jennie Keith. “If the fit seems good from both sides we
would look for ways to offer them a position,” Keith said.
To accomplish this, the college may sometimes appoint the
minority scholar as an “avanced replacement” for a tenure-track
position currently held by a senior faculty member, according
to Keith. The two occupy the same tenure-track position until
the senior faculty member retires, at which time itis expected
that the minority faculty member will fill the vacated position.
In several cases, donors have provided funding to cover the
second salary that comes from having two people in a single
tenure line. A proposed endowment in the current $2OO million
capital campaign aims to provide “more stable funding” in the
future for these kind of “bridge” appointments, according to

Keith.

According to Keith, the consortium for a strong minority
presence at liberal arts colleges, of which Swarthmore was a
founding member, has been “one of the most successful ways”
of bringing faculty ofcolor to the college. Consisting ofabout 20

Since Bradley began his career at Swarthmore and
most notably in the past dozen years a largely homogeneous faculty, at least in terms of color, has to some extent given way to greater diversity. In 1980-1981, ten faculty members of color were among the tenure-track faculty at the college; in 1990-1991,16 minority faculty members were in tenure-track positions.

Assistant dean and director of the Intercultural Center Anna Maria Cobo
is leading an effort to increase the number of Latino/a faculty.
Of the under-represented minority groups, Latino/as have the least
presence among the Swarthmore faculty. Swarthmore has 21 minority
faculty in tenure-track positions, three of whom are Latino/a. All three are in
the humanities; two teach in the department of sociology and anthropology.
An ad hoc committee of faculty and staff hopes to increase the numbers
of Latino/a faculty at the college in general and particularly in the natural
sciences.
"We need more Latino/a faculty, especially in the natural sciences," said
assistant dean and director of the Intercultural Center Annamaria Cobo.
"Students feel the lack of role models in this area."
Provost Jennie Keith also cited the need to hire more Latino/a faculty
members. "Our diversity is increasing and it is also broader, including
individuals from a wider range of backgrounds," she said. "However, we still
have very few Latino/a faculty members and I hope very much to increase
that number."
The Latino/a faculty committee was formed in the fall of 1999 by Cobo.
The committee is working with President Al Bloom and Keith to find ways to
recruit Latino/a faculty. The group drafted a position paper in spring of 2000
outlining the status of Latino/a faculty at Swarthmore and proposing that the
college increasing the number of Latino/a faculty in the next few years.
The group also received a $3,500 grant from the college to hire Kaysha
Corinealdi 'O2 as an intern last summer. In order to find potential Latino/a
candidates for faculty positions, Corinealdi contacted universities enrolling
Latino/a Ph.D. candidates as well as organizations that grant fellowships to
Latino/as. Corinealdi compiled a booklet containing the results of her
research, which she would like to serve as a guide for departments
conducting faculty searches. She also hopes that additional funding will be
available for someone to do follow-up research and establish connections
with universities that expressed interest in the project.
"The Latino/a Committee still has a lotto accomplish, but we have made
a strong effort in the past year to move the Latino/a agenda forward and
create a foundation," Cobo said of the group's progress.
In addition to bringing more Latino/a faculty to the college, other
objectives of the committee include working to recruit and retain Latino/a
students, creating the first Latino/a Colloqium on campus, facilitating
dialogue relating to Latino/a issues, establishing a Latino/a network and
working with Latino/a community leaders.

safe, officer says differ on hiring process
From DIVERSITY, pg. U

Equal oppurtunity officer Sharmaine LaMar looks for
"diversity of opinions, styles, experiences and ideals" in
her recruitment policies.
Nationally, recent legal challenges to affirmative
action programs have some university officials worried
about their own efforts to recruit minority faculty
members.
But Sharmaine LaMar, Swarthmore's equal
opportunity officer, said that the college can avoid legal
pitfalls while still working to attract a diverse faculty.
"There is nothing legally wrong with recruiting faculty of
color," LaMar said. "The problem is placing greater
priority on one candidate over another based on race."
It is acceptable to set a goal of increasing over a
period of time the percentage of minority faculty,
according to LaMar. More problematic would be
reserving a certain number of slots in a particular hiring
season for minorities.
A supporter of affirmative action policies, LaMar
believes that "to just look at race would be a huge
violation of what was intended by affirmative action."
"Simply because a person is of another background,
culture, or race doesn't make them uniquely qualified to
bring another perspective," LaMar said. "If you go after
a diversity of opinions, styles, experiences and ideals,
then physical diversity will naturally follow. If you go after
physical diversity, you won't necessarily get the diversity
you want."
But this last scenario does not happen at
Swarthmore, LaMar said. "Every person that's hired who
happens to be a person of color is more than qualified
and truly has something to offer the department," she
said.
LaMar said her goal is to increase diversity by
broadening the applicant pool, rather than narrow it "in
a direction that's equally illegal and wrong." If minorities
are in the applicant pool, LaMar said, then they will have
an opportunity to compete and get hired.
Moreover, LaMar said it is important to ensure that
when candidates do enter the applicant pool, they are
not discriminated against in the selection process
because of race.
As for Swarthmore's current initiatives to hire
minority faculty, LaMar said: "I think we're pretty safe. I
don't think that any of our policies with respect to
faculty recruiting and hiring just looks at race."
LaMar said she does not see a problem with the
college's practice of sometimes hiring a minority scholar
as an advanced replacement for a senior faculty
member. Race is not the determining factor in the
decision to extend an offer, she said, but rather the
college's experience with that particular person. "You're
looking at the richness they've added to the
environment," LaMar said.

not impose rigid guidelines or tell them who to hire based
on diversity issues. But some departmental chairs say they
employ deliberate efforts to bring more minority faculty
members to the college.
Bradley said that the Department of Modern Languages
and Literatures tries to advertise broadly and encourage
possible candidates to apply for open positions.
Moreover, the fact that so many people play a role in
the selection process including students who reflect the
diversity of the student body
may contribute to the selection of a diverse candidate, according to Bradley.
Political science professor and chair Raymond Hopkins
said that he has contacted other people in his field to find
out about potential minority candidates.
And Jacobs said that when trying to recruit for a position in neurobiology, he went to a national meeting of neurobiologists and announced the opening at a reception
given by the black caucus. This effort yielded at least ten
applicants, two or three of whom were among the finalists
for the position, Jacobs said.
Consistent with the college's general approach toward
diversity, department chairs said they do not set quantitative goals when it comes to hiring minority faculty. And
while some departments take diversity into account during the hiring process, others do not, focusing primarily
on ensuring thattheir applicant pool includes a wide range
of candidate.
"We always try to get the best candidate we can find
from as broad a pool of applicants as we can get," said history professor and department chair Bob Weinberg.
In the physics department, however, diversity does play
a role once the department has selected a short list of several excellent candidates, according to Bug.
In the biology department, being a person of color "is
some favorable weight" in the selection process, Jacobs

said.
Sometimes financial assistencefrom the college can help
departments enhance their chances of finding faculty of
color. Because of limited funds, departments usually in-

vite three or four finalists to the college for interviews. A
recent search in the biology department resulted in a list
of four finalists, one of whom was a minority. The fifthranked candidate was Latino/a. Jacobs said he called the
provost and received permission to bring in that person
as well.
While departments control their own searches, the college does provide some concrete advise on minority hiring in a new departmental handbook that includes a section outlining ways that departments can attempt to diversify their applicant pool. The suggestions include contacting Ph. D.-granting universities to ask about minority
graduates and advertising positions in publications aimed
at minorities.
In addition, Equal Opportunity Officer Sharmaine
LaMar said she hopes to build relationships with departments in order to help them find innovative ways to recruit faculty, particularly those of color. Initiatives might
include establishing more connections with Ph.D.-granting institutions in an effort to identitify potential candidates of color. LaMar said she does not want to impose on
departments, but rather to provide support in the area of
faculty recruitment for those who want it.
“My ultimate goal is to increase and enhance the pools
so there is equal opportunity and access in all the searches
we do,” she said.

OP-ED

INHERIT
THE WIND

The agony (of) the ecstacy?
BY MATT RUBIN
Last semester, The Phoenix was criticized by some for a
lack ofeditorial discretion. This paper, critics alleged, abrogated a responsibility when it chose to run a column which
perhaps trivialized rape.
While I had (and continue to have) no distinct position
on the matter, I certainly understood the argument. So I was
absolutely astounded by the recent New York Times Magazine decision to run an article on the drug MDMA, commonly
known as ecstasy, e, X, and a host ofother street names.
The article was a disgrace. Written by a former user, Matthew Klam, it was at best an insufficiently researched grammatical nightmare. At worst, it was the encouraging (read:
depressing) testimonialof an ecstasy success story.
The article begins by describing the author's life, which
essentially resembles a before and after advertisement marketing ecstasy as the medium for change. Before: depressed,
pimply, insecure, angry, petty frat boy. After: kind, peaceful, determined, philanthropic peace corps enrollee turned
freelance (and I use that term liberally) periodical writer.
According to Klam, ecstasy turned his life around. His
first experience was an epiphany that changed his life into
something meaningful. Never mind that, as Klam himself
mentions (and carelessly disregards), 95 percent of people
who try ecstasy for the first time experience an immediate
period of depression lasting days or even months.
Such dismissal of pertinent medical evidence is typical
of the article. Never mind that tests show drastic, permanent damage to users' brains
these tests represent the
use of "very large quantities" of MDMA. Never mind the
deaths caused by ecstasy hey, you can overdose on Advil

and Tylenol too, can't you? This type of logic, also used in his
ever-so-accurate sampling (of satisfied users and ex-users),
leadsKlam to conclude, despite his own presentation of ample
evidence to the contrary, that ecstasy is most likely a good
thing to try.
Most of you are probably thinking that such advocacy is
not such a bad thing. After all, you think, people are entitled
to opinions just as we are entitled to decide to read them. This,
you think, is the real meaning of liberty and tolerance.
But such a black and white conception of these virtues fails
to take the New York Times Company's responsibility into account. The New York Times is a very well respected newspaper; its readers count on the paper to be an objective and honest conveyor offacts.
Yes, this was published in the magazine, not the newspaper. But it was advertised on the front page of the main paper.
And usually, when the magazine runs such large stories, they
run a news story if they also run one-sided opinions (for example, their special coverage of the predicted inner workings
of the new Bush administration).
People hold the magazine to the same standards as the paper. When the article came out, my father told me to read it.
"This will discourage you," he said. "It's in the New York
Times." As you can gather, he was drastically wrong, as I'm
sure many other parents were.
The question is not whether the Times had the right to publish such material; clearly they did. But just as clearly, they
misled their loyal and trusting readers, perhaps causing drastic, long-term problems for these readers. I pass no judgment
on the drug itself. I do, however, pass judgment on those who
purport to make that same judgment for unwitting parents,
even if they did make us here at The Phoenix look like angels.

Why I voted the way I did
BY PETER SCHMIDT

last few weeks the ARC and the Board became swept up into a
decision-making process in which due deliberation and even
the full participation of crucial members of the ARC committee became impossible. Here are two of the conclusions I
draw from the aftermath.
L I affirm the ARC'S and the Board's decision regarding
football with the expectation that it will strengthen the remaining athletic programs at the College, intercollegiate and intramural, formally recognized varsity sports and other sports that
students themselves have organized. By "strengthen" I mean
not just having a positive effect on some teams' won/lost ratios, but on the overall experience here of those who participate. An appropriate post-ARC committee of faculty, staff, students, and Board members, I believe, should be formed to assess whether these policy changes are having this effect.
2. I am disturbed by arguments made by parties on many
different sides of the issue that a large degree of secrecy was
necessary in reviewing athletics programs. I understand that
some decisions cannot be made openly or discussed ahead of
time, but the events of the last few days show that far more
harm may come from major decisions being madewithout wide
enough discussion.
There is a different way to make sensitive decisions. As
regards the faculty, we had a meeting in mid-November with
the ARC. But we would have been able to give much better
guidance to the ARC regarding our different views on athletics if we had been able to discuss not just general principles
but several detailed proposals along with the data and arguments behind them. Having an open discussion of the 15% goal
and its consequences compared with alternatives in particular was crucial, and this did not occur.
A controversial committee should have all the MORE reason to test specific options and conclusions before the faculty
and/or before any other groups its decisions will affect. This
doesn't mean that committees have to put their final recommendations up for public scrutiny and second-guessing before
they present them. But it does mean that when a set of working models for action are defined on issues that will affect large
numbers of us, the data and the reasoning supporting those
various choices should be presented for a broader discussion
before a committee makes its final recommendations.
In sum, I urge that all major decisions be made with campus-wide input. To start, perhaps early during the Spring 2001
semester we can have a ollege-wide collection on all the issues
surrounding these recent events. That way perhaps voices
can speak on all sides of the issue (there are more than just
pro and con). And that way perhaps all of us can do a better
job of not just speaking or listening, but hearing.
-

On Dec. 11th, 2000, the faculty voted 51-15, with 2 abstentions, to support the Dec. 2nd decision regarding athletics
made by the Swarthmore College Board of Managers. Like
many on the faculty, I have intensely mixed feelings about
all of the issues surrounding recent events, but in the end
I was one of the 5L
Like many faculty, I endorse the Athletic Review
Committee's majority recommendationthat the percentage
of recruited student-athletes at Swarthmore be stabilized at
around 15%. Most faculty also understand that endorsing a
15% ideal has consequences, among them that the College
apparently can no longer support 24 intercollegiate sports
in competition with schools that have much larger enrollments.

Also like many, I know that endorsing a 15% goal for recruited student-athleteshas particular consequences for foot-

ball, a large team sport that to be played safely and competitively needs each year a disproportionate share of
Swarthmore’s small pool of such student-athletes. In the
opinion of many faculty, students, and other members of the

Swarthmore community, including me, Swarthmore’s men’s
and women’s intercollegiate sports should benefit about
equally from these recruited students. The ARC’S majority
recommendation and the Board’s recent decision is fundamentally about equity for student-athletes regardless of gender or the sport an athlete plays; it does not express prejudice toward athletics at Swarthmore.
Having said all this, I want to register my intense unease
with part of the process by which these recent decisions regarding athletics were made by both the ARC and the Board.
My unease should NOT to be taken as a disparagement of
the immense labor and intelligence the members of the ARC
staff, faculty, students, and Board members have demonstrated, including during the facility meeting of Dec. 11th.

Chaz still in charge
A long time ago, nearly a year and a half now, I was
huddled on my floor in paroxysms of pain due to what,
in retrospect, was simply a mild hamstring cramp. Nevertheless, that column, written in medias res of that incident, went quite well with my fickle readership. Thus,
my only joy in life being theattention ofanonymous eyes,
as Kundera would say, I have, not wholly ofmy own free
will but nevertheless to my benefit, once again subjected
myself to blinding torture for the benefit of you: peine
forte et dure.
Though this one remains, to my untrained medical
eye as well as to legions of technicians and alleged doctors, unnamed, I have deigned to call it MOM: multiple
orificemalfunction. I leave it as an exercise to the reader
to imagine such a phenomenon in all its glorious detail.
My recovery did, however, leave me with a great dealof
free time on my hands, during which I learned several
things, which I relate to you in order of interest.
Firstly, if you ever get on "The Price Is Right" and
make it down to "Contestants' Row," bid $1 every time. I
watched, at rough estimate, 20 episodes of"The Price Is
Right" during my fun-filled convalescence, and I can report with certainty that every contestant overbids at
least once a show. This and the observation that, while
old people are rather knowledgeable as to the suggested
retail price of common cleansers and toiletries, they do
not believe any automotive vehicle to cost more than
$lO,OOO. This is why the sorority sister from Phi Gamma
Delta at the University of California-Irvine, who may or
may not realize why she may accurately be called 'greek,'
never fails to beat the grandmother of seven from French
Lick, Ind., at the "Showcase Showdown."
I would also accuse "The Family Feud" of being the
most racist show in media since the demise of "The Amos
and Andy Show" if past events had not informed me that
remarks on wounds yet unhealed are often not interpreted in the spirit in which they were made. Humor is
best when it makes us both laugh and think, but there
exist many issues in our society where thought is oft
considered the enemy.
This brings me to my second point, this one concerning recent events surrounding my alleged poison pen. I
would like to, and you cannot stop me either from splitting infinitives or continuing because this is my column,
address earlier complaints regarding my handling of so
sensitive an issue as rape. One may be, though I am not,
of the opinion that humor generally trivializes matters,
but I do not recall this specific objection being raised. It
is possible, in the football debacle, which, incidentally,
rather got me off the hook, that this line of argument
escaped my attention. I do believe it to be erroneous, as
"In Praise of Folly" is as worthy as Luther's theses, and
I will not continue on this line.
What troubles me is, rather, this. I took my point to
be that it is humorous and sadly humorous at that, to
some social criticism I must confess —that video games
are designed in such a manner as to elicit sexual fantasies from men of ages 12 to 90, inclusive. The obviousness of our weaknesses were laid even more bare by such
a trite, and nevertheless supremely effective, display as
the aforementioned video game. This was, at heart, the

insight.

No one, and I include myself, much to the chagrin of
my critics, is in favor of rape. One ofthe interesting circumstances oflove is that, no matter how strong the desire, it must be freely given. Thus, I do not think that I
could rightly be disparaged for promoting rape per se.
Rather, I think the covert attack upon my writing was
due less to themention of rape than with the psychological circumstance through which it was arrived. A hidden premise within my column was the belief in a link
between male sexuality and male aggression, a link that
hardly needs to be elucidated by me. I believe this link to
exist, whether or not it should be a matter of debate; and
that was, I think, the real grounds for objection that my
detractorshad. I welcome a debate concerning this idea,
but to accuse me, or any right-thinking man, of being in
favor of rape, is to be intellectually obfuscatory. The target here is men or, more specifically, a version of male
sexuality. Attack that, ifyou so desire. Do not accuse me
or any one else of relishing the possibility of rape.

Dear Editor:

Walls of shame
by dealSo I'd like to start this semester off with a bang
ing with some old business. That is, I hope it's old; the paper
lining the Cornell stalls is fresh and unsullied, like new-fallen
snow, and here's to hoping it won't soon be covered once again
with the kind ofhostile homophobic comments thathave made
severalofmy friends uncomfortable using the men's bathroom.
It would be easy to launch into a tirade here about the importance of responsibility: if you're willing to write offensive, vulgar, threatening comments in a public place, and willing to
justify them by claiming them as your beliefs, "pure and
simple," then you should be willing to own up to them. The
writing I saw when I sneaked into the men's bathroom consisted mostly of insults and veiled threats toward homosexual
men: little more than bullying, and actually a littleless. Pretty
pathetic, in fact. Who ever heard of a bully afraid to give his
...

own name?
This tirade, however, is not quite as useful as are analyzing
and understanding the comments, and learning what we can
about the community from them. I am not surprised that there
are people at Swarthmore who are not comfortable with homosexuality or the homosexual rights movement. This is a composite group of people, and people have varying beliefs. I am
shocked, however, that those beliefs are expressed in the form
of threats and insults on a bathroom wall and that, although I
have heard plenty of people express justified anger over their
presence, I have heard few express surprise or disapproval over
the method of their communication. No one seems unnerved
that the only outlet for such viewpoints is this kind of anonymous intimidation. Certainly hate speech should not be welcome in any format, but what about people uncomfortable with
the gay rights movement and willing to discuss their concerns?
Why don't they just put an article in the paper?
We all know the answer to that, and it's the same reason no
names appear after the comments in the stalls. To openly express disapproval of the gay rights movement wouldmake you
a pariah in this community. In fact, to openly express rightwing views of almost any kind makes you, at the very least, a
figure of some controversy. Are you willing to take a few shots
for your beliefs? In my experience, if you're liberal in your
politics, you don't usually have to ask yourself that question
around here. If you're conservative, it probably comes up every day. I'm certainly not saying that we should feel sorry for
the poor repressed assholes who took out their insecurities in
theform of offensive graffiti. What I am saying is that we should
be uncomfortable with thefact thathate speech is the only semblance of"conservativism" most of us encounter.
Uncomfortable with abortion? Comfortable with the death
penalty? Chances are you don't speak up about it very openly
at Swat, for fear that you'll be dumped in a pile labeled "The

Enemy" along with Dick Cheney and the Rev. Fred Phelps. You
bastards, you're all the same. The problem is, you're not.
Homophobia and conservative beliefs do not go hand in
hand. The prevalence of this assertion only underscores the
point that there is very little outlet for conservative voices on
campus and thus very little awareness of the full range of the
conservative spectrum. It's a shame that these vulgarbathroom
scrawlings are considered by many to represent the "conservative" voice on campus—and an even greater shame that this

surprises no one.
As a result, too often right-wing viewpoints are not held to
high standards of reason and logic here. Why try to present a
reasonable, well-thought-out argument when you know you'll
be shouted down as soon as you get to a few key words?Liberal

arguments are weakened as well in such an environment: without challenge, there is little motivation to examine, reevaluate, and revise; just mention a few touchstone beliefs, and you're
"in," no questions asked. The best way to understand and refine your perspective on an issue is to have intelligent dialogue
with someone who disagrees. When it comes to conservative
and liberal views around here, we don'thave that. And it shows.
We need a well-publicized right-wing newspaper, or a vocal
conservative group. Hell, we need any kind of organization that
will present conservative perspectives openly, and in an intelligent, thoughtful manner that conveys many different kinds of
right-wing views. Otherwise, much of the campus will continue
to think of conservatives as cowardly bullies of the type that
scrawls insults on bathroom walls and those responsible will
continue to consider this puerile hostility an appropriate vehicle for their opinions. When "All these fags at Swat... me, I'll
take pussy, thank you" constitutes many students' idea of what
it means to be conservative, we are all the worse off for it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Board should respond to concerns No academic rigor in Board decision
Last night I met Barbara Hedges, athletic director at the
University of Washington. In July, 2000, UW discontinued
its men's and women's swimming teams; later, it reinstated
them. I asked her why. "They were eliminatedbecause we
didn't think they had enough support," she responded, "and
they were reinstated because we found out they did. We were
wrong. We made a mistake, so we corrected it."
I am delighted to read that the Swarthmore Board is reconsidering the badminton team's situation. I hope that the

football and wrestling teams will also be reconsidered and
reinstated. As J. Lawrence Shane said, "Things change." I
hope that the Board will respond to the tough questions
posed by students and alumni and, like Hedges and the UW
Board, change things for the better back to the way they
were.
Meg Hodgkin Lippert '64

Reporting of cuts well done
Dear Editor:
I would like to take this opportunity to tell all of you
what a wonderful job you have done in reporting the recent [athletics] dilemma at Swarthmore. Congratulations
on a job well done.
Kathy Pagliei

Cuts send a non-athletic message
Dear Editor:
I am writing to express my opinion concerning the recent decision to end the Swarthmore College football program. My youngest brother, Matthew Asano, is a junior at
Swarthmore College and has been a starter in the program
since his freshman year. I was disappointed recently when
I heard from him that the program had been cancelled.
The message to the community in cutting the football
program is that "we can't." We can't maintain our reputation and grow as a school while trying to compete as a football team. We can't recruit the types of players who can compete on the field and succeed in the classroom. We don't
have the resources. The message ofathletics the message
every athlete strives to deliver clearly and resoundingly
every time he or she steps on the field
is that "we can."
"Give me a challenge and I willrise and overcome it." These
are the words spoken through the actions ofathletes professional and amateur.
Evan S. Asano

HEADLINES THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT

Dear Editor:
Clearly the [Board of Managers' athletics] decision was
wrong-headed. It also appears the process by which it
was reached was no better than the decision itself. The
argument that the cuts are necessary to preserve diversity in the student body assumes that students recruited
for any of the sports are identified in the student body
solely by their sports affiliation which, as several of the
letters to The Phoenix have pointed out, is nonsense. It
was nonsense when I played football for Lew Elverson,
and it is nonsense now. There is no evidence that diversity has been compromised by the three programs to be
cut, to say nothing ofhow it will be enhanced by the cuts
themselves. Also missing is any justificationfor the percentage range of athletes in each class the Board deems
acceptable. The only thing resembling research in support of this action, namely the student survey, was never
tabulated. Is this what passes for academic rigor at
Swarthmore these days?
Bob Amussen '49

Swarthmore must crave public ridicule
Dear Editor:
Like sunspots, like cicadas, like comets around the
sun, Swarthmore seems to have a deeply programmed
inner schedule, craving its fix of widespread public ridicule on a recurring basis. I strongly urge a retreat to
gradual adjustment of the athletic programs.
Roy Perry '74

Efforts to reinstate program
were impressive
Dear Editor:
I am the parent of Ryan Earley, who plays at Dickinson
College. Please know that the emergence of the
Swarthmore program as a potential force in the conference was a frequent topic among parents and fans this
year. Many called your coach "The Coach of the Year."
Your intelligent, organized efforts to reinstate your program are so impressive. They are truly proof that no one
should ever doubt the multidimensional qualities you are
capable of offering your academic community. Keep your
hopes alive, I can't imagine you will lose, and please visit
us at the tailgate party after next year's game.

Skydiving incident renders man unable

BY JOEY SPADOLA

If I had held one belief dearly
and lived by it at all times, it was:

vehicle traveling 200 miles per
hour at heights ranging upwards
of 5,000 feet. Common sense dictates that any person who willfully defies this imperative, with-

out being under the influence of
any mind-altering substance,
should not be allowed out on the
streets after dark.
But there comes a day in one's
life when one, growing tired of

was now busily contemplating other
issue ofundeniable import, such as:
How can Meg Ryan possibly be forty
years old and stillmake an excellent
skydiving partner?!
And so it was that I had no choice
but to accept the offer.
The following weekend we went
to the nearest "Drop Zone" and set
up our skydiving appointment. You
are required, under the federal statute that states Only an Idiot Would
Jump out of a Plane and is Therefore
Entirely Responsible for His Own
Death, to sign approximately 287
separate forms indicating that "I am
aware how miserably stupid I am for
going skydiving and that, whenI die,
which of course I will, my relatives
cannot press charges against the
drop-zone facility and my epitaph
shall read: "It was his own damned

fault."
There are several types of skydiving available for first-time jumpers,
all of which, I was dismayed to learn,
involve actually jumping from a
plane. I ultimately chose "tandem
jumping," wherein you are strapped
to a trained professional whose name
is generally something like "Krazy
Kyle" and whose hair is more blinding than a high-wattage strobe light.
I decided to go tandem because, in
short, I would NEVER trust myself
with my own life. I have already
forcefully demonstratedthat I cannot
even be trusted with my own laundry, as my roommate will attest, and
I am certain that, if I had jumped out
of the place unaccompanied, you
wouldn'tbe reading this column.
All first-time jumpers must endure five hours oftraining. I personally enjoyed the training, far more
than the actual jump, because the
longest distance I fell was less than
five feet. Jumping from a grounded
plane is, I found, very much my
speed.
Unfortunately, the mock minijumps were painfully short-lived,
and the real jump, I shudder to recall, drew near quickly. The time
from the end of the training session
to the actual plunge was a crescendo
offear and panic. My vision blurred,
my thoughts muddled, and I kept
hearing that damned song from the

Wizard of Oz, which stuck in my
head for some reason: "With the
thoughts I'd be thinking, I could be
another Lincoln..."

Certain of my impending death, I
kissed my family good-bye and hastily willed my signature-series
Charlie Brown coffee mug to my little
cousin and my copy of "The Idiot" to
my parents as Joseph Spadola memorabilia. And so, teary-eyed, I boarded
the plane.

They have a saying in the military, "There are no atheists in the
foxholes," which means that only
religious wackos must be dumb

enough to climb into foxholes in the
first place. No, wait, all kidding aside,
they actually mean that, in times of
great fear and despair, everyone
turns to religion. I can personally
attest to this because, as we were
climbing to our destination altitude
of 7,000 feet, I became an earnest Believer. In fact, to be absolutely safe, I
invoked every major religion, appealing to, among other deities and
Buddha,
Jesus,
prophets,
Mohammed, Zeus and Christina
Aguilera.
Having reached 7,000 feet, I took
one frightened look toward distant
Earth and, at this very moment, suddenly inspired by the majestic sight,
I fully realized, with blinding clarity,
the meaning of the word "mistake."
My underwear, I will note unabashed, also had a realization impressed upon it, one a tad more tangible, you could say. I understood,
however, that it was too late to turn
back, that I had to jump, if only beTHE PHOENIX

cause Kyle would whether I liked
it or not. And so, at his anxious
prodding, without glancing down
again, I dove into the bosom ofthe
air.
I can still recall my eloquence
as we left the plane: "Holy (expletive deleted)! Oh (37 consecutive
expletives deleted)!" So impassioned was my shouting that
some Jehovah's witnesses in
Wales, hearing such speech bellowed from the heavens, thought
the Messiah had come, although
they were shocked, the local paper reports, at "the coarseness of
His language."
For thirty seconds, I fell. During that time, I believe I was in
complete cardiac arrest. I remember the fall only vaguely, because
my brain, finally returned to its
sense, has wisely blocked it from
my memory, primarily to conserve undergarments. I do remember, however, finally reaching good ol' Earth, after what
seemed like four days of descending under the parachute, and kissing it repeatedly.
Following the jump, I did not
talk for several days, besides occasionally uttering, "Never
again!" In fact, I have still not
fully recovered. But talk of the

residual effects will have to come
another time. Right now I have to
change my underwear.

My creed: eat at
BY ESTER BLOOM

the Towne House
BY MATT RUBIN
Just before break, I went on my first Swarthmore
"date." Come to think of it, this was my first "date"
ever; I've had girlfriends, but the "date" isn't how
we do things in Scarsdale, NY. Understandably, I
wanted my first official date to be the quintessential one. So, after picking up the lucky lady, we
headed to Media in search of a nice restaurant, pref-

erably classy (like me).
Immediately intrigued by its outward appearance, we chose D'lgnazio's Towne House. A series
of plaques led us to the door. Each listed a virtue
and its definition.For example, one boasted the word
"charity" at the top and beneath was a description

of how the restaurant's founder, Silvio "Babe"
D'lgnazio, interprets the
concept
of
charity.
The

statement. This
creed begins, "I
expect to pass

this
world but once.
Any good thing, therefore, that I can do, or any kindness that I can show, let me do it now." It is the expression of the kind, wonderful man who owns this
humble but elegant restaurant.
Our experience at "Babe's" restaurant reflected
the sentiment of his touching creed. Upon entering,
we were greeted by a genial man who introduced us
to the Towne House, asked if we needed anything
special and handed us gift certificates. Our waiter
was helpful and friendly, and it seemed we interacted with the restaurant's entire staff. At the end
of our meal, we introduced ourselves to "Babe" and
the D'lgnazio family, who thanked us for our visit
and requested our phone numbers so that they could
contact us about special events.

The food itself matched the delightful service. In
particular, my salmon entree was deliciously flavorful and my date's vegetarian platter looked quite
good. Arid the handmade apple pastry was, without
a doubt, the best Italian dessert I have ever had, even
topping the exquisite tiramisu I enjoyed in Rome
two weeks ago.

The rest of the menu looked just as promising.
D'lgnazio's Towne House offers plenty of hand-cut
steaks and chops; the filet I saw at the table in front
of us looked great. As it is Italian cuisine, pasta is
plentiful, as are veal and seafood. And, finally, the
house specialty: prime ribs ofbeef slow-roasted and
served au jus. Simply delectable!
The Towne House is more expensive than many
local establishments, but is a bargain for such great
food and service. Nevertheless, "Babe" has a variety of ways to minimize the economic burden, including special menus for different days of the week
and an early bird special until 6:00 pm, Tuesday
through Friday. The complimentary gift certificates
cut the cost of repeat dining as well.

I could write about the Towne House forever, but
I actually am on my way to another date, this time
in Scarsdale (I love these things now!). So, I'll close
by simply saying I love "Babe's" place and I hope
you take my suggestion and dine there; you'll thank
me, and not just because your date is impressed by
the size of the bill.

THE PHOENIX

One of John Goodman's frequent admonitions to Steve
Buscemi in "The Big Lebowski" is "You're out of your element, Donny." That's how my friend described his experience
seeing the Cohen brothers' latest, "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?" "But then," he added, "I didn't read the book." He was
referring to Homer's "The Odyssey," on which an introductory 19205-style cue card states the film is based. But while "0
Brother" is certainly an odyssey, it bears only a passing resemblance to the "The Odyssey."
This claim is the weakest point of the clever, quirky epic.
Most parallels could have been left to viewer discernment.
They're obvious enough: the hero, Ulysses, is played with
toothy charm by George Clooney, who is on his way home
from the chain gang in which he has spent the last few years.

He expects his wife, Penny (Holly Hunter, resuscitating her
shrill "Raising Arizona" accent), to be waiting for him.
Ulysses and his traveling companions, Pete (John Turturro)
and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), run into familiar characters
along the way, including a cyclops (John Goodman with an
eye patch) who claims to be a Bible salesmanand three sirens
seductively scrubbing clothing in a river.
There is at least one significant deviation, however: Penny,

instead of waiting for her husband to return, has divorced
Ulysses. She is intent on marrying a skinny, oily-haired man.
"O Brother" is a film of faithless women: all the female characters seduce, betray, or, as Delmar's cousin confides to the
travelers above his young son's head, have "R-U-N-N-O-F-T."
Fortunately, none of our three heroes gets bogged down
brooding over female infidelity. Each has a vision ofhome for
which he braves the dusty Mississippi roads and eludes determined policeman. Still, the men have significant forces to
contend with.They bicker amongst themselves; they get separated and have to find each other again. The Bible salesman
tries to kill them. A bipolar gangster drags them into a bank
robbery. At one crossroad, they pick up Tommy, a black hitchhiker who has sold his soul to Satan for the ability to play the
guitar. He inspires the crew to form a band called The Soggy
Bottom Boys. They cut a record that, unbeknownst to them,
tops the charts (inasmuch as there were charts in the 19305).
In one hilarious sequence, Tommy is later nabbed by the
Klan. The lynch rally showcases hundreds of white-cloaked
men marching in elaborately choreographed circles and chant-

George Clooney plays the character that would be Ulysses.

ing softly, as though in Muncnkinland. Tommy's rescue, which
unites the crew just as Tommy himself did, is funnier still.
The Depression-era South has never looked as lovely as it
does here; every scene is tinged with gold, an ongoing, subtle
reminder that "O Brother" is a genial, good-natured satire.
The film is not to be take seriously, just enjoyed. If there is
any message to be found in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" it
is to have faith not in religion but in pop music, the redemption of us all. And, as one recurring song advises, we should
"keep on the sunny side of life."

Getting them high: Comedy masters
easily work audience at Philly club
BY DANIEL MARRIN

South Street's premiere comedy club, The Laff House, lies
at 221 South Street. The unimposing building down the corner from 3rd and South boasts a large mural of Curly the
Stooge. A plush staircase and walls filled with the portraits of
modern masters (Larry Miller, Kevin James and Dom Irrera,
to name a few) lead to the heart of the club. It's Friday night and the Laff House presents stand-up comics Mike Washington and Pierre, two men from Washington,
D.C. and Los Angeles, respectively. A $25 ticket for the doubleheader scores me a table just below the stage, where I realize
I am one lonely white boy in a mostly black and definitely
older crowd.

Shaggy's "Wasn't Me" and "Project Chick" blare from unseen speakers, filling the air with a hint of what's to come. On
stage, a red curtain connects two Roman pillars. A mod,
leather, cheetah-patterned couch sits directly in front. At the
very edge, spotlights illuminate the black stool and micro-

phone.
The lights dim at 8:40 p.m., and Breakout, the young emcee, arrives in brown sweater and matching skullcap. He opens
with cracks about the latest scandal, Jesse Jackson's lovechild,
but gets few chuckles. Nervous and a little sweaty, Breakout's
fear is obvious as he glances nervously from ceiling to floor.
He is searching for a sign of our approval but the silence only
exacerbates his discomfort and uncertainty. The gift ofcomic
masters lies in not depending on crowd approval; BreakOut

isn't there yet.

Eager to get out

of the limelight, he introduces Mike Washington, who saunters onstage in silk purple shirt and leather
pants. Mike turns his back and comments on the couch and

curtain. After a minute, he turns to us and shouts, "What,
like you all really get to work the MINUTE you step into the
office?"

The crowd laughs, and Mike's raring to go. He hits on small
office crimes, Mike Tyson's cannibalistic tendencies, out-of-

control gangsta rap and the corporate ladder at McDonald's.
Mike effectively livens up the crowd, and I sense that he is
well on his way to becoming a master.
The night's headliner, Pierre, emerges in leather jacket,

wife-beater, baggy jeans, Timberland boots, a black skullcap
and multiple chains. He also ignores the audience at first, sipping his Bloody Mary between cracks at Los Angeles and D.C.
You can't tell from his face whether Pierre is black or white.
His style lies somewhere between Chris Tucker and Fenster
of "The Usual Suspects."
Pierre rants about club pick-ups and the best and worst
sex available. His jokes aren't getting much attention, but he
explains, "You guys just ain't high enough yet. I'll get ya high."
Sure enough, 15 dirty-joke-filled minutes later, Pierre has broken us down withsound effects, winks, smiles, and salutes. In
spite ofhis coarseness, it's obvious Pierre honestly wants us
to enjoy ourselves.
At 10:30, BreakOut ends the show and lets the smiling crowd
out. Without raw talent, it will take years for him attain Mike
or Pierre's relaxation and persistence. Mike Myers once said
that comedy can only be "refined," not taught; a struggle is
worthwhile only if there's something innately funny inside.
It makes me wonder about testing myself on Open Mike Night
Wednesdays at 8 p.m.
Laff House ticket prices vary depending on the performer,
but performing at Open Mike is the cheapest way in. Come
see if you've got what it takes to be a master.

shows, prime-time sitcoms devoid of any redeeming

value, hyper-colored, quivering Japanimation, and
a whole lot of football.
Trapped in a house with seven males and two television sets, I was bound, if I was to fulfill my 10-hour
quota of daily TV viewing, to end up vegging to one
sports program or another. Grumbling at first, I actually developed a strange, definitely unexpected affinity
ofall things, football.
Over the course of the month, I began to recognize certain players, and I even learned the names
of a few plays. I followed teams and took an active
interest in their playoff progression. But my
newfound enlightenment was limited, despite my
month-long rigorous attempt to educate myself in the
ways of this mind-boggling game. I remain surprisingly ignorant when it comes to football.
Spending my break as football programming's absorbent, eager sponge served, surprisingly, to excite
me about the approaching Super Bowl for more reasons than its intermittent advertising entertainment.
In previous years, my sole purpose for paying atten-

NEW YORK AND BALTIMORE
ON THE FIELD THAN I AM TO

tion to football at all rested on the brainchildrenof mastermindadvertisers willing to shell out beaucoup bucks
to score a slot on Super Bowl Sunday. And it was never
a priority; the climactic game never took precedence
over anything more substantial than hauling my dirty
laundry from room to washer.
This year, however, will be different. I fully intend to spend Jan. 28 perched on the Willets 2nd sofa,
taking in downs and fumbles, field goals and, of
course, touchdowns. Suddenly, I'm more stoked to
see New York and Baltimore on the field than I am
to see Budweiser's latest marketing ploy.
Thanks to my dad's emphatic response to my lethargy-induced interest in his favorite organized sport
and his eagerness to establish common ground with a
daughter he'd long dismissed as "out of touch," coupled
with my eagerness to establish a permanent residence
atop my parents' couch, I, like most of America, will
abandon my priorities, my Swattie nature and any antiviolence bone in my body as I join forces with men I
had previously thought barbaric to belch and scratch,
holler and swear and to comprise my health by consuming excessive pounds ofhydrogenated vegetable oil
all while rooting for a chosen team.
So what ifI have to ask my brawnier compatriots
for occasional clarification? I hereby, unabashedly
and without any qualms, dedicate this Sunday, and
Super Bowl XXXV, to the reduction of my ignorance
and the furthering of my appreciation of a great

American pastime.

Tide finds wins hard to come by
BY ANNA MASILELA
At first glance, the men's basketball team seems easy to
write off. An overall record of 2-13 and a Centennial Conference record of 1-4 doesn't inspire much confidence. Nevertheless, this much-maligned team deserves a second look.
David Pearce 'O3 has improved his scoring substantially,
moving from averaging 10 points per game last season to 20.8
ppg this season. Chris Loeffler 'O4 has been a newfound asset,
leading the team in rebounding in addition to his 11 ppg, along
with ZackEllison 'O4 and Eran Ganot 'O3. Ganot and Kyle Lewis
'O2 are shoring up the front line, while Jacob Letendre 'O4 is
leading in assists.
That is not to say that the Tide hasn't been whitewashed
this season. The 57-point loss at Lehigh on Nov. 28 and the 30point loss at Whittier on Jan. 5 were considerableblows. However, as the season has progressed, Swat has been narrowing
the loss margin and making it hard for tough teams to beat
them. The Centennial Conference game against Muhlenberg
on Jan. 20 is a good example. The Tide ended up losing 79-74,
but fought to the last minute of overtime against a team that
is the top pick to win the East Division this year, according to
the preseason poll of coaches and sports information direc-

tors.

"The first two years I played here, the attitude was never
there, even in close games," said Lewis. "Now, we think we
could win, that we're the better team, and we're playing like
it."

Ellison scored 21 points and pulled down eight rebounds
against the Mules, but it was Josh Loeffler 'O3 who put the life
back into the Tide near the end of the game. Swat had been
leading by one point at the half, but seemed to lose their edge
as the game progressed. The team was behind by only three
points with about four minutes left, so Swat wasn't out of it
yet. But the win just didn't seem to be in the cards for the
Tide, as they were constantly playing catch-up to the Mules.
Then Josh Loeffler was fouled. He popped in his two free
throws and then started to resuscitate the team. He dropped a
two-pointer, giving Swat the lead at 54-53 for the first time in
more than 20 minutes. The Mules answered with a threepointer, so JoshLoeffler popped in another two-pointer to knot
the game. With the excitement at a fever pitch, the rest of the
team fired it up and brought Swat into overtime.
"Josh played a great game," said Lewis. "He really took

over at the end of the second half. [Muhlenberg] parted for
him."
The team has been adjusting to the addition of three new
players to the squad. Lewis and David Gammill 'O2 both returnedfrom study abroad, while Isaac Cohen 'O2 returnedfrom
taking a leave of absence last semester. The new squad had
its first opportunity to play with the modified squad during
the training trip to Whittier, California.
"We spent a week adjusting and meshing with the returning guys, and having some fun at the same time," said Ganot.
Unfortunately, the additions weren't the only changes: leading scorer Pearce broke his toe out on Huntington Beach two
days before the first of two games.

Josh Loeffler leaps over a trio of Haverford defenders on his
way to the basket. The game was not over at press time.
"We had picked Huntington because it was flat, had no rocks
and few big waves," said head coach Lee Wimberly. With Pearce
out, the team lost to Whittier 79-49 on Jan. 5, and to Illinois
College 83-73 on Jan. 6. Pearcereturned to play last night against
Haverford. Results were unavailable at press time.
"The team has gotten significantly better in all kinds of
ways," said Wimberly. "It's been tough this season and the
kids have been really resilient." More specifically, he noted
the efforts of the rookies to join the Tide. "Three of our freshmen have been brilliant at times this year. In this league, it's
hard for a freshman to get a significant amount of playing
timebut they've done it."

added 12points. Emily Gray 'O2 came
off the bench to rip down eight rebounds.
"We had huge contributions from
everyone on the team," said head
coach Adrienne Shibles. "The key to
our success this season is our depth;
everyone is a force on the court."
Haverford power forward Erin
McCarney 'O3 had a double-double,
with 13 points and 10 rebounds. But
it wasn't enough against the Garnet's
defense, currently ranked first in Division 111, who kept the Fords to a 3L9
percent shooting average.
The team wore football jerseys instead of their usual warm-ups. Katie
Tarr 'O2 explained the decision, "We
were showing our support for those

student-athleteswho will never have
the chance to wear a Swat jersey

again."

Distance relays place
third at Yale Invitational
Some indoor track team members see their season as
a warm-up for outdoor competition in the spring. At the
rate they are moving, expect two of the women's long
distance relays to be red hot by the middle of March.
While many Swatties spent three weeks watching reruns
of Jerry Springer and munching corn chips, the winter
track athletes were already back on campus for in-season training. So far it looks like it has all been worth it.
"We did very well at the Yale Invitational last week,"
said Sarah Jay 'OL
She wasn't kidding. The women's distance medley
relay team, consisting of Jay, Jessica Rickabough 'O2,
Claire Hoverman 'O3 and Joko Agunloye 'Ol, placed third
in a field ofDivision I teams, and were a mere two seconds from setting the schoolrecord in that event. Later,
the 4xBoo relay ran a great third-place finish, led again
by Jay and Agunloye and joined by Annie Kittler 'Ol
and Courtney Caughey 'O4.
On the men's side, team captains Marc Jeuland 'Ol
and Keith Gilmore 'Ol are also meeting with some success. Jeuland, who runs some of the longer events, like
the 5,000 and the 3,000 meters, and Gilmore, who runs
middle distance sprints like the 400 and 800, both did
well at Yale.
"If we can stay healthy we should have a real presence in the conference this winter," said Jeuland.
Additionally, they are looking for two-sport athlete
Mat Rapoza 'O3 to contribute his strong right arm to
toss the shot put. Said Jeuland, "Mat Rapoza ended last
spring doing well and it's nice to see him back."
Considering that most of the runners are still a little
rusty, the winter season holds some real promise.
Records may be broken.
"I'd just like to say, as a senior, that it's really great
to work with such enthusiastic underclassmen," Jay
said. "They're fun to be around. Of course, it's great for
us to be running well."

what if Phil Jackson left his wife for the young

daughter Jerry Buss, the Lakers' owner? The Lakers
have much more important problems.
For starters, they threw the dice and lost in offseason trades and acquisitions. Isaiah Rider and
Horace Grant combined do not average as many
points as GlenRice did last season, and it doesn't seem
like either has plugged up the holes that Rice supthe Lakers are giving up
posedly left on defense
more points this year than last.
However, the Grant-Rice exchange was logical; the

Swimmers travel to Aruba for training
From Jan. 10 to Jan. 20, the Swarthmore men's and women's
swim teams traveled to Aruba for their annual training trip with
head coach Sue Davis and assistant coaches Leisha Schaffer,
Claire Arbour 'OO and Trish Flynn.
The team enjoyed the beautiful beaches and breezes, especially
at 5 a.m., when it was necessary to roll out of bed for practice.
The routine consisted of two intense practices a day along with
weightlifting and various dry-land exercises. The team implemented traditions such as 'challenge sets,' which help with team
bonding. A practice meet was also held against the Aruba Dolphins at the Saveneta Olympic Pool, where the Caribbean International meets are held.
The island of Aruba proved somewhat dangerous, leaving a
few swimmers with scrapes from cacti and cliffs. Next up for the
team are the Centennial Conference Championships, as well as
in important upcoming conference meets against Gettysburg,
Washington and Dickinson.

Badminton team expects to dominate
Despite all the turmoiland controversy in the last few months
surrounding the Board of Managers and the women's badminton team, team captains Jane Ng 'Ol, Karen Lange 'O2 and Siobhan
Carty 'Ol have managed to stay positive and focused on repeating the successes of the last several years.
Their 2000-01 season looks very promising. The team has plenty
of depth and experience, having graduated no players and returning more from abroad. The team's four upperclassmen are
hoping to return to nationals for the third year in a row, and it's
likely they will be joined by some of the more skilled underclassmen, including several talentedfreshmen. Badminton is aiming
to dominate the PAIAW league this year, as they have in the past,
and hope to win the league championship again.
Although the season has been rough off the court because of
the Board of Managers decision to take away their varsity status, the team has meshed well and is excited about its upcoming
season. The team will host Haverford on Thursday and Bryn
Athyn on Jan. 3L

Lakers needed a power forward. It's the Isaiah Rider
signing that I really cannot understand. For a team
that couldn't handle Dennis Rodman a few years ago,
Rider is simply not the answer.
In a close analysis, the two are remarkably simiRodlar. Both have difficulty making it to practice
man offers no excuses, while Rider often cites traffic
problems, car troubles and meetings with his parole
officer as excuses. Furthermore, both men have creative ways of releasing anger. When Rodman got
pissed, he kicked a cameraman in the groin. When
Rider got pissed, he spit on a fan's face.
Rider is a headcase that the Lakers cannot afford
to contend with this season. I don't envision that his
Keyshawn Johnson-esque "Give Me the Damn Ball"
mentality will mitigate the Kobe-Shaq feud. As much
as I hate the Lakers and enjoy ripping them, I don't
relish laughing at this quarrel
it's an embarrassment for any sports fan.

SHAQ HAS FORGOTTEN THE
LESSONS HE LEARNED FROM
ARISTOTLE.
In other sports and on other teams, superstars can
work together. For example, David Robinson modified his game to accommodate Tim Duncan. I also
haven't heard of Cris Carter asking Randy Moss to
catch fewer passes. For these athletes the key to winning is simple and obvious: teamwork.
I fault Shaq, not Kobe, for forgetting this fundamental idea. Kobe is having a great year: he's shooting well both from the field and from the line, he's
playing suffocating defense, and he's mixing in almost five assists per game.
Shaq, on the other hand, has forgotten the lessons
he learned from Aristotle. He caught the Glen Rice
defense virus, and his claim that Kobe is hogging the
ball is absurd. If Shaq could shoot more than 40 percent from the foul line, he would be averaging another point or two per game, which would move him
close to his scoring average for last year. But I guess
Shaq would rather whine than shoot a few hundred
more free throws per day, and he must only want to
win a championship if he is MVP of both the league
and the playoffs.
As much as I fault Shaq, I don't expect the guy
to solve all of basketball's problems by himself.
That's why he has a coach. However, Phil Jackson
has not handled this problem competently. How
could he have asked Kobe to tone down his game
when he should have ripped Shaq for his miserable performance at the line? Could you ever imagine Jackson asking Jordan to tone down his game
for Pippen? I don't think so. The worst thing a coach
can do when his players are feuding is to make
them angry at him, but that's just what Jackson
did with Kobe.
Nonetheless, I don't thinkKobe's resentment will
linger because he's having such a great season. Look
for the Lakers' team defense to improve somewhat
over the next few weeks, and look for them to put
their problems aside during the playoffs. They're good
for another championship run.

Throwback teams,
halftime show make
Super Bowl a snooze
Reporter: Ray Lewis, you just won the Super
Bowl, what are you going to do?
Ray Lewis: I'm gonna stab Mickey Mouse!
Okay, maybe not. But Lewis has both the aura
and the game of a rampaging predator; the heart
of a defense that I think will win this year's Super Bowl by outscoring the Giants. Lewis, even
though he was just a bystander, became even more
fearsome during his murder trial. Well, that and
the fact that he gained 25 pounds ofmuscle. During the divisional playoff, if Adelphia Coliseum
was a jail, then Eddie George was the one who
bent over to pick up Ray's soap. Too bad for the
Titans, Chuck Noland deserves to see 'em in the
Super Bowl.

In this game, with fewer weapons on the two
teams thanIceland and the Canary Islands, I think
it will come down to which defense manages to
bludgeon a big play out of the other team's ball-

control offense.
Last year was as good as it gets. It was brilliant game played by virtuoso quarterbacks that
was good to the last yard. This year, the QB theme
is redemption. I'm not so sure it should be redemption so much as it should be Nyquil. These guys
should hardly be a story, but everything at the
Super Bowl is a story, from Tony Siragusa's
tummy to Amani Toomer's name. Kerry Collins,
maybe, after pulling a great game out of his wazoo
in the NFC Championship game, but certainly not
Trent Dilfer. Everyone knows they win in spite
of him, not because. Even if the Ravens do win
the Super Bowl, they might try and get a better
QB in the offseason.
And as far as the overall game, this will be entertaining its own way. These are two gutsy teams
who might not even be in the top 10 in the league
in terms of talent. But in terms of execution, defense and fundamentals, the Ravens and Giants
get the job done. Watch how well the Ravens tackle
or the Giants scheme-block. Everyone

"misunderestimated" these teams because they
don't have any Joe Montana or Franco Harris
types, but they play solid, fundamental,
smashmouthfootball.
Personally though, I'm still convinced this is
a conspiracy and the NFL made Minnesota tank
the game because the thought of a major market
Minnesota vs. Baltimore/Oakland match-up
would make a bit of green. Or not quite enough
green, to be accurate. After all, they've got to pay
the likes of Sting and Ricky Martin for the halftime show. They should be paying me to watch it.
Not that I don't like them, but spending $3O million on that is like spending $3O million on the
Inaugural Ball: It's fancy and it's got some fancy
dude shaking his bonbon, so people pretend to
care, bear and stare, when they should be refilling the chip bowl or filing their taxes.
In the end, I think it's going to be the Ravens

defense that shuts down the Giants and makes
the big plays to win the game. Let's cross our fingers and hope no one gets stabbed this year (unless it's part of the game), no defensive backs get
caught with hookers, and E-Trade still has a few

bucks left to throw out another great ad.
By the way, Ravens 20, Giants 3, on the wings

Women's basketball takes no
break from successful season
BY

RYLAND AND EMILY GRAY

A warning to the general Swarthmore student population:
don't ask the Swat women's hoops team how their winter break
was. They have been toiling in Tarble Pavilion since Jan. 2,
eating, sleeping, and breathing basketball, and kicking a little
Centennial Conference tush along the way.
They learnedthat Maine is quite cold in January and drove
eight hours to mop up with two local teams while huddling
together for warmth like Asian snow monkeys. Despite frigid
temperatures, the women fared well in the winter break flurry
of basketball. They played six games in 14 days and only let one
slip away.
The winter break schedule began with a road trip to Maine.
The blizzard-like conditions on Saturday didn't stopthe bus from
delivering the Garnettes safely to the University of Maine at
Farmington gym to easily defeat the Mainers by a 21-point
margin, 62-4 L Katie Robinson 'O4, Ali Furman 'O3, Sarah Tufano
'O3 and Heather Kile 'O2 all scored in double figures in front of
a surprisingly supportive away-game crowd. Maine is the home
state of senior captain Heather Marandola 'Ol and Coach
Adrienne Shibles, and the locals were out in force to cheer on
their hometown girls.
The post-break winning streak continued the next day as
the Tide went on to defeat Bowdoin College in a hard-earned
victory, 74-59. The score was neck and neck nearly the entire
game until late in the second half, when Swarthmore began to
pull away with a little help from Robinson, Kile, Tufano and
Furman, who all contributed with double figures. Kile led the
pack with 20 points, shooting 8-of-ll from the field and 4-of-6

from the foul line.
The Tide returned to Swarthmore primed to face Centennial Conference opponents. Dickinson College was their first

course on Thursday, Jan. 11, and the Tideswomen swallowed
them whole 76-45. Garnet defense held Dickinson standout Kim
Selemba to just nine points in the contest. Robinson, Kile and
Marandolachipped in 10,12 and 10 points respectively. Robinson
hustled her way to an impressive seven steals. Gretchen Heitz
’O4 and Emily Gray ’O2 contributed a formidable 11points each
for the “W” off the bench.
The defensive splendor thatthe women have become nationally credited for failed them just long enough to let Western
Maryland walk away with a victory. They dropped the contest
64-59. The Green Terror forced 18 Garnet turnovers and held
Swat to less than 40 percent shooting from the floor and 15 percent beyond the arc. Kile had a team-high 20 points and 13 rebounds, but these efforts were not enough for a win.
Frustrations were promptly redirected towards renewed
defensive enthusiasm and the redemption of their Centennial
Conference pride on Wednesday, Jan. 17. Confidence was regained in a 66-50 away win at Ursinus. Despite a slow start, the
Tide established a 35-19 lead by the halftime buzzer. Robinson,
Furman and Kile each tallied double figures.
Only one day of practice on the heels of the Ursinus win was
all the ladies needed to pull it together for an eventual win
against perennial Conference foe Muhlenberg. The Tide came
out gunning with full intentions of avenging last year’s unfortunate loss at Muhlenberg, leaving little doubt in the minds of
disbelievers who the better team is with a convincing 59-48 victory.
Efforts were contributed across the board in several areas.
While Kile and Tufano may have led the scoring with double
figures, the defensive end was none too shabby. Along withleading an offensive clinic, Tufano swatted away five shots by the
