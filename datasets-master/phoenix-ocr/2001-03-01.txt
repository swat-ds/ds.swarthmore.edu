Rape attempt leads
to security questions
ing to the most serious charge, attempted rape,

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
An attempted rape by an unidentified man
took place in the vicinity of Sharpies slightly
after 3 a.m. on Monday.
Law enforcement has classified the offense
as attempted rape as well as aggravated indecent assault. This means penetration of the
genitals or anus with a part of the attacker's
body, according to the consolidated statutes of
the Pennsylvania District Court.
The crime is a second-degree felony.
According to an anonymous source close to
the victim, the female student was "abducted
[and] led
at knifepoint at the Sharpies patio
to a dark area under nearby trees."
The source said that the victim was forced
to the ground, sexually assaulted and that "the
assailant made indications that he was going
to rape her." He cut her clothing and body, the
source said, and "began to adjust his clothing."
The source said the assailant then fled the
scene for unknown reasons. The victim was
...

left on the ground, bruised and bleeding from
cuts to her body. In a "state of emotional
shock," she walked to a nearby dormitory and
phoned the police at 3:39 a.m. The police and
ambulance arrived and took her to CrozerChester Medical Center, where she was treated
and evidence was collected.
Swarthmore Borough police chief Brian
Craig said the injuries sustained by the victim were "not life-threatening, but life-impacting." There were no serious stab wounds from
the knife, he explained, but such an experience
is likely to leave deep psychological scars.
The victim has described the attacker as a
slender white male between s'B" and 6'. He was
wearing a dark ski mask and dark sweat suit
and had a sheaf for the knife on his hip.
Anyone who saw a male of this description
around three or four on Monday morning is
urged to contact the Swarthmore Police Department at (610) 543-0123 or 911. They may also
call Public Safety at xB2Bl. Those with information may give it anonymously.
The anonymous source emphasized that
"anyone protecting the assailant out of friendship, loyalty or fear of authority is protecting
an armed, violent sexual criminal."
As far as naming suspects, Craig said the
department "[hasn't] narrowed it down" and
"suspects are not limited to the student body.
"The investigation is preliminary, and we
don't want to rule anyone out," he said.
Although the crime was classified accord-

the assailant, once caught, could also be accused of aggravated indecent assault, simple
assault and stalking, Craig said.
The anonymous source said the police "repeatedly searched the area where the attack
occurred" and sent some items they recovered
to a forensics lab.
He said that "during the initial attack, a
gold chain was broken and is believed to have
fallen to the ground. Any student who finds
such a chain is urged to bring it to a dean or
Public Safety as some comfort to the victim."
The police department is now working with
the Criminal Investigative Division of the
Delaware County District Attorney's depart-

ment.

Officers from Public Safety, Swarthmore
Borough Police, Nether Providence Township
Police, Morton Borough Police, Springfield
Township Police and Ridley Township Police
have aided in the investigation.
As far as improving and promoting awareness of campus safety, Public Safety has made
a wide attempt to inform every Swarthmore
community member of what happened Monday
morning.
Signs describing the attacker are posted on
virtually every doorway, and campus-wide emails have been sent out.
Chief Craig said he understood that the victim felt comfortable walking around on her
own campus, but that "walking alone after
dark isn't safe anywhere," no matter what the
environment. Public Safety has sent out an allcampus e-mail urging students to take advantage of its escort services.
Chief Craig said that, in his two and a half
years at Swarthmore, he has not experienced
any crimes of this kind. Owen Redgrave, director of public safety, also said that no reports
of similar attacks had been brought to Public
Safety's knowledge in his approximately 20
years here.
However, Redgrave emphasized that many
similar crimes are reported via Psychological
Services or the gender education department
and never released to the department.
Just because he doesn't know about them,
he said, doesn't mean they didn't happen.
In the interest of furthering the investigation, the Swarthmore Borough Police Department is "keeping the circumstances [of the
crime] vague," Chief Brian Craig said. "We
have certain details available to only a very
small number of people."

Tires were slashed on 26 vehicles, including the one above and fifteen
college-owned vans, temporarily suspending shuttle service. The vandalized
vehicles were parked by Cunningham fields and the fieldhouse.

Vehicles vandalized
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
A total of 26 cars and vans had their tires slashed early Sunday morning in a series of acts of vandalism that Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave called "senseless."
Several of the vehicles that were damaged were college-owned vans,
disrupting shuttle service Sunday and Monday.
Tires were also slashed on student cars, several athletics vans, a college employee's car, and a public safety patrol vehicle. Traffic lights at
the intersection of Route 320 and College Avenue were smashed, pointing to vandalism that Redgrave said is likely related "based on geogra,

phy."

Redgrave said he has not seen vandalism "to this extent" here in the
past.
The borough police are working with public safety in the investigation but said that there were no leads as who committed the vandalism
or why at this time. The fact that stop lights and college and student
vehicles alike were targeted "makes it very difficult to come up with a
good motive," Redgrave said.
The first disturbance public safety responded to Sunday morning was
a call from a student who had heard loud noises coming from the
Cunningham field area at 3:30 a.m. While on the way to investigate, a
public safety vehicle ran over something on College Avenue that damaged one of the tires. When public safety arrived at the field, however, it
did not observe anything unusual, Redgrave said.
Redgrave said public safety noticed at about 5:30 a.m. Sunday that
the traffic signals at the intersection of Route 320 and College Avenue
had been smashed. About the same time, a damaged patrol car was discovered. All the tires had been slashed, several of the windows had been
smashed, and the lights on the roof were destroyed.
After that, Redgrave said, public safety noticed that cars in the
Cunningham lot had been similarly vandalized. Four student cars had
been damaged. Some were keyed, and all had slashed tires. Borough police reported that four other cars parked along Fieldhouse Lane had been
vandalized.

Student arrested, charged with assault
Intoxicated student allegedly participated in fight, resisted arrest, injured police officer
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
The campus was host to another violent attack this
weekend when Than Court 'O3 was charged with aggra-

vated assault, resisting arrest, simple assault, public
drunkenness, disorderly conduct and criminal mis-

chief.
Around 1:50 Sunday morning, Public Safety contacted the borough police in response to a "disorderly
subject and fight inside Parrish," a police report read.
Swarthmore Borough Police Chief Brian Craig said he

"[didn't] know what precipitated the event."
Before the police arrived, Court, who Craig described
as "visibly intoxicated," had punched two Public Safety
vehicles. The police accosted him near Willets.
Court "refused to respond to questions," read the police report, and an officer attempted to lead him to the

police vehicle.

At that point, he resisted arrest and "got involved in a
scuffle" with an officer, Chief Craig said.
The police blotter reported that other officers assisted
in handcuffing the subject and placing him in the patrol

vehicle.
Craig said Court was and housed in Media until his

arraignment.
He stayed in the Delaware County Prison until Monday morning, when his bail was posted for $25,000 and
10 per cent. This means that only $2,500 needed to be
paid, but the remainder will be due if Court misses his

hearings.
Craig said that, on Tuesday, Court "came in to apologize to the officer" for having fought with him, Chief
Craig said, which was very much appreciated.

REPORTER

A late-night safety investigation
BY AN ASTASIA KOLENDO
This is a story of two Phoenix reporters chosen to walk
around the campus andfind places ofsafety after dark. This
is the campus as you have never seen it before
considered
from the point of view of a victim attempting to escape an
attacker. We looked for easily accessible phones, well-lit areas and open spaces toprovide an escape route. Here is what
wefound.
The Prelude

Tuesday, 7 p.m., Self-Defense Class at the WRC:
There is fear in the air. A friend, who only last week thought
nothing of me walking back alone from Willets to Dana
after 2 a.m., makes me promise that I will not go outside
alone to research this story. Fear does not change everything, but it does color every single campus experience with
a tint of panic. I try to remember a conversation this week
that did not inevitably end in discussion of Monday
morning's incident and cannot.

The Journey Begins

Wednesday, 12:15 a.m., Parrish: Liz Wright and I start
a tour of the darkest and scariest places on campus. There
is someone on duty at Parrish desk, dutifully disregarding
us as we pull on the front door to check if it's locked. It is.
We try the side doors. This reveals them to be unlocked.
Inside the door next to the Parrish circle, there is a hall
access phone, which is accessible at all times. The area
between McCabe and Parrish is peopled and well-lit. It feels
safe, but, then again, there are still shuttles running from
the Parrish Circle, and the library is still open.

12:20 a.m., near Kohlberg: Welcome to the Dark Side
area behind Parrish is adequately
all except for the one leading to
lit, the doors are locked
the little Admissions Office foyer. Here, there is a light
switch box, the door of which is swinging open. The flip
switches for the exterior lights are taped to the "on" position. There is also an open door to a staircase. We go up a
flight of stairs and through a door swung open into a student lounge. Beyond it, Parrish lies open in its entirety,
administrative offices as well as student rooms. The dorm's
three open doors remain unlocked past our 2:20 a.m. bedtime. One wonders whether students who live in Parrish
sleep with their doors open.
The only Kohlberg door that is unlocked is the one leading to the coffee bar area. We go in, but there are no people
or visible phones here. (There are, in fact, two invisible

phones, ingeniously placed in the small labyrinth next to the
Scheuer Room.)
12:30 a.m., DuPont/Cornell: This is one of the worst-lit
places on campus. There are no people in sight. DuPont's side
door facing Cornell is unlocked. The main doors are bolted.
(Someone very considerate, however, left cheese on toothpicks
out for late-night visitors.) The hallways are empty, with no
phones in sight.
12:35 a.m., Hicks quadrangle: The walk behind Hicks
leading to Papazian and the rugby fields (as well as Woolman)
is not just badly lit, it is also full of impediments like garbage canisters and vegetation. Don't walk there if you can
avoid it.
The quad between Beardsley, Hicks, Pearson and Trotter
has five doors. Four of them are locked. The door to Beardsley
(which also stayed open past 2:20 a.m.) opens with a jolt after
Liz pulls on it with her full body weight. The space is deserted
and moderately lit and has no easily accessible phones. One
person, the first one we've meet since we crossed to the Dark
Side of Campus, hurries past us and unlocks Hicks with his
own key, ignoring our attempts to attract his attention. We
don't get to ask him where he got the key. "One unfriendly
person in the court of locked doors," says Liz.
12:50 a.m., pathway from the rose garden to Willets:
There are big gaps between the few lights that are here, behind McCabe. Once again, there are neither people nor phones
visible.
1:07 a.m., Tarble/Parrish: The area is well-lit and populated. Paces is about to close, and its clientele is all around
the building.

occurred last semester, was burned out.

OX 2001

THE PHOENIX

1:15 a.m., Olde Club, Phi Psi and DU houses: The walk
from Wharton to the fraternity houses is frightening. The lighting is absolutely dismal, and there are trees that not only almost completely obstruct what visibility we do have but could
also serve as the perfect hiding spots. We can see no one.
1:20 a.m., train tunnels: We walk to the Sharpies tunnel.
It is drenched in light, but the nearest phones in open build-

ings are the ones in Tarble and Old Tarble. The tunnel is
long and cramped. I feel happy that I neither live in PPR
nor suffer from claustrophobia. We find the other end just
as well lit. The problem is tunnel vision: you do not know
what or who is on the other side until you actually get there.
The SEPTA station tunnel is also surprisingly well lit. Several of the lights have been fixed recently.

The Night Closes In

1:50 a.m., Ben West: There is no one in sight as we
walk back. We walk into Ben West and ask the Public Safety
officer on duty how the night is going. He says there are no
more escort requests than usual. The question remains
whether it is because fewer people are out this late now, or
whether not everyone is taking this quite as seriously.

1:55 a.m., Sharpies patio: "Ready?" I ask Liz. She is
timing me as I run from the archetypal "it," searching for
the nearest phone or person. I jerk the Sharpies door. It is
locked. Turning, I run past Liz and up the hill. It has not
yet crossed my mind that the slope makes this the path of
most resistance, and in fact the slope throws me significantly offbalance. I race up the stairs of the bell tower and
through the Tarble doors, searching frantically. We cheat:
Liz shouts at me that there are phones downstairs by the
bookstore. I was going to search for a phone inside Essie
Mae's. (Even the available methods of contact are not
clearly marked anywhere.) Downstairs, panting, I touch
the campus phone's handle. I make it in two minutes. We
morbidly joke about practicing the run to improve my timing. Neither one of us laughs.
We walk around campus one more time, trying locked
doors and watching people leave Beardsley. It is here, at
2:05 a.m., that we run into a public safety officer on a patrol. He tells us it is his third time passing through that
building during the night. After another walk past Parrish,

we both head home.

Walking down the same road I have taken already twice
that night, I notice how dark the amphitheater is under
me. I observe how close the tree branches hang and what a
small distance separates me from the darkness. The campus, always majestic in its fairy tale-like beauty, is suddenly remarkably intimidating.

Public safety's reaction to fire questioned
Students receive little emergency training and are often unfamiliar with emergency policies
BY IVAN BOOTH E

â 

In the wake of the Feb. 16 fire in a Parrish kitchen, some
have raised concerns about who should be called to respond
to fire emergencies on campus. At a study break in Parrish,
a Swarthmore firefighter addressed fire safety concerns and
instructed students on how to respond to different kinds of
fires.
At the study break, students were told to call 911 directly
in case of a fire. This is different from official college policy,
as listed in the college handbook, which states that students
should call Public Safety at 8333 in case of any emergency.
On Feb. 16, at 2:31 p.m., two alarms in on the second floor
ofParrish went off when Cristina
Cardemil 'Ol accidentally started
a grease fire in the dorm's
kitchen. As soon as the two
alarms went off, Public
Safety officers and mainte-

nance personnel were dis-

patched, according to
Owen Redgrave, head of
the Public Safety depart-

ment.
Meanwhile, Cardemil
had managed to put out the
fire after finding the correct
fire extinguisher to use on a
grease fire. She then called
Public Safety, informing
them that there had been a
fire, but that it was now ex-

tinguished.
The Public Safety officers
continued to the scene, arriving at 2:33 p.m. "This was a
close call," Redgrave said. He
said Public Safety "took the
very small chance" that the
fire was still burning and did
not notify the Swarthmore
Fire Company immediately.

dent in part on the fact that
the fire had been a visible one. "If she had said 'there's a
fire in the wall, and it's out,' we would have called the fire
department," he said.
Upon arrival, the Public Safety officers noticed the large
amount of smoke generated from the fire. They then called
the fire department to assist with ventilation of the smoke,
but exactly when they made that call is unclear. Records
show that at 2:55 p.m., the Swarthmore Fire Company was
dispatched to the scene.
"Our involvement was pretty limited," Swarthmore fire
chief Chris Hansen said. "We were coming back from another call, and we got the call from Public Safety to assist
with ventilation if we could." He reported that the fire company brought in large fans to clear out the smoke.
After the Parrish fire, the RAs in the dorm organized a
study break hosted by Rick Graham, a member of the

Swarthmore Fire Company. During the break,

Graham told

students to call the fire department before trying to put out

afire. Contrary to this advice, this year's student handbook
students to "in the event of a fire emergency, ring
â¢he building fire alarm and call the Department of Public
safety emergency telephone line."
, Redgrave said that when an alarm goes off, officers are
"umediately dispatched to determine the nature of the emergency. If the alarm is accompanied by any confirmation of
fre or smoke from a phone call, the Swarthmore Fire Company is notified immediately.
"If there's the slightest chance offire or smoke," he said,
then the fire company is called."
Because Cardemil told Public Safety officers the fire was
'ut, they did not immediately contact the fire department,
sv en though they did see smoke.

>eton Hall fire raises the alarm

In January of 2000, a fire in a dorm at Seton Hall UniverPty in New Jersey killed three freshmen. The cause of the
lr e has since been determined as arson, although no ar"ssts have been made. There are some similaritiesbetween
_

he Seton Hall campus and the Swarthmore campus. For

instance, according to the New Jersey Star-Ledger, at Seton
Hall officials said the fire alarm system was not linked directly to the village of South Orange, but to campus security
officials, who would then call for emergency aid. The automatic alarms at Swarthmore, as Redgrave explained, are
similarly structured.
The Command, an informational Web site run by members of the firefighting profession, lists "common problems"
associated with fire safety on college campuses. The first
item on the list is "delayed alarms."
"Universities usually have a security officer respond to
automatic fire alarms, before the fire department is dispatched, to reset the bells or investigate," it says. "If it is a
fire, then the officer calls the fire department. Needless to
say, valuable time is wasted."
Boland Hall, the site of the Seton Hall fire, had no sprinkler system. Myrt Westphal, director of residential life, said
that after the Seton Hall fire, sprinklers were added to last

'ft FIRE IN A DORM IS MY
WORST NIGHTMARE."
MYRT WESTPHAL
-

summer's renovation of Wharton, and are planned for Dana,
Hallowell and Mertz dorms this summer and all dorms in
the future. At this point, Wharton is the only dorm with a
sprinkler system. She said, however, that "smoke alarms
save lives; sprinklers save property." Westphal felt the college needed to put its money into state-of-the-art fire alarms,
although she guessed that all dorms would "eventually" have

sprinkler systems.

After the Seton Hall fire, the deans and the Housing Committee decided to ban the sale of "hazardous substances"
from the bookstore. Items such as candles, incense and halogen lamps had previously been for sale, although they were
forbidden in dorm rooms. Smoking areas in dorms were reduced, and some dorms were converted to entirely non-smoking status.

Emergency policies ambiguous
Redgrave said that the reason students are encouraged
to call Public Safety instead of the fire department directly
is because the officers feel they are better equipped to handle
emergencies. One problem, he said, was the different names
of buildings on campus. He said that in some cases, Public
Safety officers had to meet an emergency crew and lead them
to the site.
"We probably do a better job directing emergency response," he said. "If we get the call, we can give better directions" to the emergency crews, he said.
Westphal agreed with Redgrave. "I think it's best to call
Public Safety first," she said. "Public safety knows the campus and the buildings."
Hansen said that he was not aware of the college's fire
policy and he would "need to sit down with Owen [Redgrave]"
before commenting on it. "I don't know that it's so much we
don't know where to go," he said, but Public Safety would
know the campus better because of their extensive experience, according to Hansen. "Certainly, Public Safety, being
on campus, has a much quicker response than we could
have," he added.
According to Redgrave, some of these fire procedures
were "made a long time ago." Although emergency response
has improved over the years, the college stillrelies on emer-

because we don't know what to tell people to call, 8333 or
911," he said.
Redgrave felt that calling Public Safety was still the best
course of action. When students call the emergency line, he
said, officers know immediately where they are calling from
and can send Public Safety officers right away. He also said
that "people under stress often have a problem with communication," which might cause problems in relaying information about their location and nature of the emergency.
However, Cardemil disagrees. "If there is a fire, call 911
immediately," she said.
Limited emergency training for students
On Jan. 29, a fire similar to the Parrish kitchen fire occurred in Media. Alice Durnell was cooking when she accidentally started a grease fire. At first, she tried to fight the
grease fire with water, but this only caused it to spread.
Finally giving up, she ran to a neighbor's house to call 91L
By the time firefighters arrived, the house was engulfed in

flames. Durnell's two great-grandchildren had not managed
to escape, and the three- and four-year-old children perished
in the fire.
Luckily, Cardemil, an RA and trained Emergency Medical Technician, knew exactly what to do with a grease fire.
The correct extinguisher to use for this type offire is a dry
chemical DC, not the silver pressurized water extinguisher,
which would have spread the fire, as it did in Durnell's case.
Westphal said that during RA training, three hours are
spent with Public Safety discussing fire issues. A fire safety
video is shown, questions are answered, and RAs are offered "hands-on" experience putting out demonstration
fires.
As far as fire safety instruction for the greater student
body, Westphal said, it is up to RAs to talk to their hall about
it. Westphal feels that fire drills take care of what most students need to know about fire safety. She said that RAs
should discuss fire safety at the first hall meeting.
Westphal thinks that more fire training for students is
"a great idea," but "how are we going to get students to
come?" Westphal said that the Parrish study break following the fire was successful largely because of the feeling of
"immediacy."
"If people have good ideas [about promoting fire safety],
we'll entertain them," she said, but "it's hard to teach people
things when they don't think they need to know them."
She said the freshmen workshop schedule was pretty full
already, and she reasoned that many students had fire drills
in high school, and she guessed that very few would have
done them in their own homes.
Westphal said that she is very concerned about fire safety
at the college, and "that's why I harp on things like candles
and halogen lamps," she said.
"A fire in a dorm is my worst nightmare," she added.

gency response units that utilize a great deal of volunteers.
"If we get a call first, an officer who has training in responder duties can be there before other emergency responders. You can use up valuable minutes making a report to the
[county dispatcher]," he said. "It typically goes fast, but if
there are five other fires in the area, it might not."
Since Public Safety is responsible for nothing but the college, Redgrave said their response time would be considerably better. Westphal said, however, that "the thing about
911 is that everyone knows it." The Public Safety emergency
line, 8333, is "not one that immediately springs to your mind."
Many students are confused about who to call in the case
of an emergency. Andy Wong 'O2 said the Feminist Majority
is planning to make and distribute flyers with emergency
information for students to have as a reference. "We're stuck

Student Council continues to
investigate safety measures
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
Following the vandalism and attempted rape that occurred
this weekend, Student Council discussed what actions should be
taken to improve safety on campus.
The Council felt very strongly that safety was of great concern to the student body. Anna Woodiwiss 'O2, Student Council
Co-President, said at the beginning of the discussion, "I have been
receiving e-mails all day from students who think Student Council is in a position to act and should do something important very,

very soon."
I think people are starting to say, 'What's going on? Why is
my campus not safe?' she added."
Marvin Barron 'O2, Student Budget Committee treasurer, told
Student Council that the Student Budget Committee was looking
into the cost of running vans around the clock, with non-student
contracted drivers taking over the early

morning shifts.

Badminton status
still unclear
BY JON EHRENFELD
The women's badminton team has almost completed their season in the Philadelphia Area Intercollegiate Association for Women (PAIAW). As the
team begins its games in the tournaments, its status
as a team remains in doubt.
On Dec. 7, the Board of Managers voted to demote
badminton from varsity to club status, in addition to

eliminating football and wrestling.
Since then, team members and members of the
athletic community at large have criticized the decision, saying that in addition to the team's great success, it is not a burden on the college monetarily, and
does not slot incoming students.
Maurice Eldridge, Executive Assistant to the
President, said that at present, the team will remain
unchanged. In the fall the decision to demote the team
will be reviewed, he said. This will leave enough time
to study the matter in more depth.
Although the team currently participates at the
varsity level in the PAIAW, Coach Dan Sears and several of the players have indicated that they expect
badminton to become a National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) sport in the near future. "Considering that the sport is played by 300,000,000 people
worldwide, it's inevitable that this will happen, the
only question is: when?" Sears said.
In the near future, the team will be meeting with
President Al Bloom to discuss their status, and other
issues raised by the Board's decision. Until then, however, Sears has asked the players not to concentrate
on the team's future or status, but rather to focus on
the season, which is not yet over. Until then, the team
will continue as it always has.
Siobhan Carty 'Ol is hopeful that the future will
see the badminton team being made a permanent
varsity team, as well as the sport entering the NCAA.
She believes that the decision to demote the badminton team came from misinformation about the team
given to the Athletic Review Committee, and the relative status of the sport. Since badminton is a relatively unpopular sport in America, it often does not
fit in with the normal concept of an athletic department. These reasons, she felt, made the team a prime
candidate for demotion.

no one walks around the campus between two and seven; obviously, this is
not true," Barron said.
Student Council has been pushing for
greater campus security for some time.
An SC security committee, headed by
Poulami Roychowdhury 'O3 and Liane
Rice 'O3, formed at the beginning of the

semester and has engaged in talks with
Owen Redgrave, director of public
safety.
According to Roychowdhury, the

so many other colleges do." Council members agreed tha
this weekend's incidents afford them a greater opportu
nity to gain some of their sought-after advancements ir
campus safety.

Referring to the mugging that occurred in the train un
derpass last semester, Student Council member Sonil

Bahtia 'O2 commented that it seemed that "in the past, the
campus has gotten excited [over safety incidents], and ther
quieted down. We can't let that happen again."

Brackett expressed similar sentiments.
"We need to act on this soon. Next time it could be a
gun," he said.
But he also expressed frustrated confusion over the is
sue, describing his feelings as "dumbfounded" about wha
to do to guarantee a safer campus.
"One of the tough realities of this is that we still live ir
a violent world," Brackett said, "and
whatever precautions we take, these

incidents could stil occur."
As a preliminary response to th(
incidents, Student Council will hos'
a fireside chat tonight in Kohlber{
Coffee Bar at 7:30.
Redgrave, Dean of the College Bot
Gross, and Dean of Gender Education
Karen Henry will address students
concerns and talk about the safetj
options currently in place on campus
Several RA's and representatives
from Safe Walk, the on-campus escor
service, will also attend. Studem
Council hopes the fireside chat will also afford student!
the opportunity to share their opinions on how to improve
safety on campus.

Committee brought the issues of better campus lighting,
the responsiveness and friendliness of public safety, and the installation of swipe cards to Redgrave.
She said that "Owen was very receptive to the idea of installing better lights, because he has around $2,500 in a special fund
for this very purpose." The Safety Committee will talk to the lighting committee about the issue in the future.
Roychowdhury said Redgrave was not as receptive to the other
two requests. Although both Roychowdhury and Rice have received complaints from students saying that Public Safety does
not always respond to the emergency phone, Redgrave told the
Safety Committee that Public Safety always rushes to answer it.
Additionally, Roychowdhury said Redgrave complained that
students abuse Public Safety facilities, alluding to the fact that
the number of requests for transportation around campus is always higher on rainy nights.
Safety

Furthermore, Redgrave opposed the swipe card system be-

cause he was not sure it would protect students.
He also called it a technological hassle and said it would cost
a good deal of money to implement the machines around campus, Roychowdhury said.
Better lighting around campus has also been under consideration, Student Council College Planning Committee representative Jordan Brackett 'Ol said, "but that might not be enough."
Other ideas included mirrors in the tunnels, to provide a full
range of observance for pedestrians, or videocameras installed
there.
Blue light security boxes, which would allow students to make
emergency phone calls from a number of locations outdoors on
campus, "have been proven not to be helpful in deterring crime,"
according to statistics presented by the administration, Brackett

said.
The blue lights, which many other campuses feature, are often useless to students who are actually being threatened or attacked, and they usually wind up as part of a "boy who cried wolf
kind of thing," where students use them for personal calls and
other non-security-related purposes.
But Woodiwiss pointed out that the boxes "could be a deterrent to criminals.
"There's the question of the reality of security on campus as
well as the perception of security on campus," she explained. "Students wonder why we don't have [the blue light boxes], because

After the chat, Student Council will meet again to de

to discover the reason for the increasing safety issues in
an attempt to solve the problem from its root.

Brackett said that "while the vandalism and assaultan
the highlights of the weekend, [the issue of campus safety
has been escalating for a while, with random fights ant
other occurrences."
He further commented that, statistically, at Swarthmore
February is always one of the worst months for safety.
Brackett said this increase could possibly be attributet
to cabin fever amidst the student population. More specifi
cally, he said the lack of parties and stricter alcohol policj
present on campus this semester could be at fault in the
increase of incidents this year.
Also in the meeting, Student Council unanimously de
cided to create an additional Student Council sub-commitj
tee to review the college's financial aid policy. The Finanj
cial Aid Review Committee (FARC), headed by Studenl
Council Co-President Colin Moore, will join the Securit)
Committee and the Living Wage Campaign Committee a!
one of the Council's three main projects.
Moore relayed to the council a summary of Al Bloom'i
speech to the Board of Managers this past weekend. In the
speech, Bloom said he did not project Swarthmore follow
ing Princeton's decision to do away with loans in the neai
future, because Princeton is not a school Swarthmore
strongly competes with.
However, according to Moore, Bloom said the college
would be forced to consider the idea more strongly shoult
Brown, Amherst, Williams, or one of Swarthmore's othei
competitors adopt a similar policy.
Moore told the council that, based on conversations witl
board members, he felt that the Board of Managers woul<
be receptive to a Student Council review of financial aid a
Swarthmore. Moore said, "I hope our work will spread into
a campus wide discussion on financial aid."

Honkala urges focus on local poverty issues
BY GABRIEL HETLAND
Cheri Honkala, executive director of the Kensington
Welfare Rights Union (KWRU), spoke about poverty to
a full crowd in the Scheuer Room on Monday night.
This Saturday marks the third anniversary of national welfare reform in Philadelphia, and members of
Empty the Shelters (ETS) are working to raise awareness about poverty.
KWRU is a Philadelphia organization that focuses
on local poverty issues but also addresses national and
international concerns. It has been nationally recognized for its efforts to address poverty, welfare, and living wage concerns.
ETS activist Jessica Sheldon 'O4 said Poverty Week
is important because Swarthmore students' awareness
of nearby communities may be low.
"Students can go through four years at Swarthmore
and not see anything that is happening in Chester or
Kensington," she said. "There's a whole world out there
of poverty."
Other activities this week include a "hunger meal,"
to be held tonight in Bond. The meal is meant to simulate the actual distribution of food globally.
On Saturday there will be a citywide protest at the
State Office Building in Philadelphia, followed by a trip
to Harrisburg, the state capital, where KWRU will put
the Pennsylvania government on trial for violating the
economic human rights of the poor in Philadelphia.
Honkala's speech chronicled her life in poverty and
her changing attitude toward being poor in the United

States.
She began by recounting her childhood, which she
said was marked by poverty and violence. Her stepfather, Honkala said, "night after night would drink himself into a coma and beat me and my brothers and sisters" after unsuccessfully searching for jobs.
After her parents were deemed unfit to care for her,
Honkala was removed from her home. She said she
learned to blame her mother for the family's poverty
and vowed her life would be different. Honkala said she
thought pregnancy at age 16 was the only way out of
her dependency, but she ended up living in a car with
her son.
Honkala said that, after months of homelessness, she
began to organize with other mothers in the Minneapolis area to prevent a plan to cut welfare checks by 30
percent.

The protest worked, and Honkala's career as an anti-

poverty activist began. "I realized," she said, "that I
had a responsibility. It wasn't enough for me to sit down
I needed to figure out a way for families to survive."
Upon moving to Philadelphia in the mid-1980s,
Honkala settled in North Philadelphia, the most economically deprived area of the city. KWRU activist
Carrie Eagles said that Kensington, the North Philadelphia neighborhood where her organization is based,
has been hard hit by globalization over the years as
many factory jobs in the area have moved overseas.
The two biggest sources of income in Kensington,
said Honkala, are now welfare and drugs.
Since she founded KWRU 11 years ago, Honkala said
that she has worked to minimize the effects of poverty
by taking over abandoned houses for the homeless.
Honkala said her son has often watched her being arrested during the takeovers.
Much ofKWRU's recent action has centered around
former president Clinton's 1996 Welfare Reform Act.
This law, according to Eagles, changed the status of welfare. Before, Under Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, all families earning below a certain level of
income received benefits. Clinton replaced it with the
new Temporary Aid to Needy Families law, known as
TANF.
Honkala noted that she was the first welfare recipient to refuse to sign the agreement of mutual responsibility as a component of TANF, because she found it
"unfair."
Activists in 1996 charged that the new TANF law effectively cut the government's guarantee to the poor.
The act imposes a five-year limit on cash assistance
for each family, Eagles said. After the period expires,
family heads must find jobs, which often do not pay
living wages.
The act also calls for recipients to sign an agreement
of mutual responsibility in which they promise to look
for jobs and the government promises to aid them in

return.

Defenders of the act say there are plenty of good jobs.
They believe the law will force people to work harder
and help them move beyond dependency on the government.
Eagles said Philadelphia's implementation of the national reform, starting in 1998, "has created a different
level of desperation. Pressure on jobs has increased,"
she explained, "and shelters have been more often filled
to capacity than in the past."
She also

those who cannot find jobs and may feel worthless.
"The problem of welfare reform," said Eagles, "is part
of larger issues of globalization and the lack of jobs with
living wages." Honkala and KWRU have characterized welfare reform as a violation of economic human rights as
laid out in the United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights.

Honkala ended her talk by calling on the students assembled to come to the Saturday protests and stay active.
"It's not OK for you to just stay inside studying when
there's a war going on outside the door," she said. "You
have a responsibility to do something."

No clear answer on course minors for class of 2003
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Course minors outside the honors program were approved by the faculty last
May, but it is still not clear whether they
will be available for the class of 2003.
As these students finish the process of
crafting their sophomore papers, written

statements

outlining

a desired course of

"H MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR

THIS YEAR'S SOPHOMORES
TO PLAY EITHER BY THE
CURRENT RULES OR THE
OLD RULES, BUT NOT SOME
COMBINATION OF THE TWO."
st udy, the question of whether minors will
be available to their class is particularly
Pertinent.
The Curriculum Committee is still in
the process of planning the implementation of minors. "Students need to understand course minors are coming. We still
n eed to work out how and when," said
Craig Williamson, English professor and
chair of the Curriculum Committee.
Students who are juniors this year will
tall under the old policy, he said, while he

is "reasonably sure" the new policy allowing
for course minors will apply to this year's
freshmen.
The situation for sophomores is much less
clear, and it is likely to remain uncertain for
the rest of the year. The committee is waiting for faculty input later this month to make
a decision about minors, and Williamson he
does not expect to announce a decision until
April. Even if sophomores are told this spring
that course minors will be a possibility for
them, however, Williamson said it is unlikely

they will be able to make any changes to their

actual course programs until they return in
the faU.

Registrar Martin Warner reminded students in an e-mail last Wednesday that the
only minors currently in place are within the
honors program. Warner wrote that if the
Curriculum Committee decides to make
course minors available for the class of 2003,
notification will occur in the fall.
Even if the course minor proposals that
many departments have already submitted
to the committee are finalized quickly, there
are no guidelines for how current sophomores would include course minors in their
plans of study.
At this point, it would be very difficult
procedurally to plan for sophomores having
minors, Warner said.
Williamson recognized that many sophomores would be eager to have a course minor if the option were available to them. "I

think it may be possible for this year's sophomores to play either by the current rules or
the old rules, but not some combination of
the two," he said.

Every department now offering a major or
special major could offer a minor under the new
program. It is up to each department to decide
whether to offer a minor, but departments that
do not offer minors are likely to be the exceptions. Programs that are currently concentrations will become interdisciplinary minors.
Williamson said most departments have
already submitted proposals to the committee

outlining requirements for a minor. "Right
now, it seems likely that all but a few depart-

ments and programs will offer minors," he

said.
Warner said there were several sophomores who had come to the registrar's office
to ask if course minors would be available,
while others had received information from
academic advisors who were unclear about
how and when minors would be offered.
The big change beyond the availability of
minors will be the introduction of limits to
the ways in which course programs may be
combined, Williamson said.
Unlike the current practice that places no
cap on the number of additional concentrations that may accompany majors, the proposal for course minors sets very specific
guidelines for combinations of majors and
minors.
Under these rules, students may have ei-

ther a single major with up to two course
minors or a double major without minors.
There are similar limits for students in
the honors program. A student could have
a major and a minor within the honors program, and could have additional minor outside of honors. Also, a student may be a
double major and do honors at same time,
so long as the minor required for honors
is in the same department as the major outside the honors program.
Williamson said these limits are "a little
less flexible, but in line with what is most
commonly done."
Minors are being added to allow students to pursue "focused breadth" in a subject outside a major. Limits on the number of minors are being instituted so that
students will also continue to experience
the breadth of coursework that distribution requirements encourage.
Coursework completed for a minor will
be subject to an "overlap restraint." This
will mean that, of the five or more credits
required for a minor, four of those credits
may not overlap with another major or
minor a student has.
These proposals have already been sent
to department chairs for review. At a faculty meeting tentatively set for March 23,
minors proposals submitted by the departments will be discussed, and faculty will
be able to give input on how best to time
the implementation of minors.

BOARD

Board approves
science center
BY HOFAN CHAU
The Board of Managers approved the science cen-

ter and a number of tenure positions, as well as initial planning for a new dorm and the renovation of
Parrish, at their quarterly meeting on Saturday.
After hearing from the Development Committee,
the Finance and Trust Committee and the Property
Committee, the board concluded that they had sufficient funds and a good long-range plan for the development of the science center.
The building's design will now be made available
for construction committees to bid upon. Work is
expected to start over the summer and conclude by
the fall of 2004.
This final approval has come after several years
of planning. "I think there's a great deal of enthusiasm and excitement," said Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice-

president for college and community relations. The
center, he said, is "by far the largest [project] by size

and dollar."
Schemes for the new dorm and the renovation of
Parrish are still in their initial stages, but money has
been authorized for more planning. In terms of timing,
Eldridge anticipates that the planned new dormitory

will be built at the same time as the science center.

The last big project the college embarked on was
the renovation of Trotter and the building of
Kohlberg. The same architect has been involved in
the design for the new science center.
The Board of Managers meets quarterly and
makes many of its tenure decisions in the spring.
They have awarded the following professors tenure
and promotion to the status of associate professor:
Spanish language and literature professor Aurora
Camacho de Schmidt, religion professors Nathaniel
Deutsch and Steven Hopkins, linguistics professor
Theodore Fernald and chemistry professor Paul
Rablen.
In addition, history professor Stephen Bensch,
economics professor Ellen Magenheim and classics
professor Rosario Munson were promoted from associate professors to professors.

Tarble to offer late-night food
Snack bar to remain open until 2 a.m. Sunday through Thursday
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO
Tarble will soon be home to a late-night
snack bar, director of dining services
Linda McDougall announced recently.
The latest addition to campus food
options will be housed in the lobby of
Tarble, at the counter from which bag
lunches are distributed. Students will be
able to buy food with meal points and
cash.
"It will be a completely student-run
operation with support from Dining Services," said McDougall. The idea was
brought to her by Jared Solomoon 'Ol, a
former Student Council co-chair.
The establishment is slated to carry

the basic late-night fare: packaged junk
food, pre-wrapped sandwiches and cans
of soda. The counter will be open Sunday through Thursday from 11 p.m. to 2
a.m. if the necessary staff can be found.

Dining Services is looking for anywhere
from six to twelve students to staff the
counter, depending on the time commitment each is willing to make.
While remaining optimistic about the

idea of the snack counter, McDougall
does have some reservations. During her
first year with Swarthmore in 1997, Essie

Mae's was sometimes open until 12 or 1
a.m., but it did not receive much patronage from students after 10 p.m.
"We are not going to continue to do

it if we are just throwing food away,'
McDougall said. She conceded, however
that "maybe things have changed here.'
Many students are excited about th<
addition.
"Great idea," said Joe Florence 'O4.
"I think it could work out very well,'
agreed Ben Bagley 'O4.
"Considering student habits, wÂ«
don't have enough food facilities open
late," said Ellie Hakala 'Ol. But Hakala
who works at Kohlberg Coffee Bar, alsc

said that "student workers aren't nee
essarily the most reliable."
And not everyone on campus would
use the new service.
"It's too late," said David Mister 'O4.

Diversity week plans made
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

*

*

Pre-made sandwiches and other snack foods will be sold at the counter in the lobby of Tarble

What the Intercultural Center hopes will be the first annual Diversity Week begins on Friday, March 23. The IC has
made an effort to design the week's programming with the
entire college in mind.
"Our guiding principle is that we want to reach out to everybody on campus, not just the support groups, not just the
so-called 'ethnic groups,' and not just the religious groups,"
said William Tran 'O3, one of the event's main organizers and
intern for the Swarthmore Queer Union.
Cathy Ta 'O3, another planner for the week, said the idea
for Diversity Week grew out of a concern that many of the
IC's programming is poorly attended, partly due to the fact
that most of it takes place in the middle of the day during the
week.
In this sense, Diversity Week would "replace the IC events,"
Ta said, although the IC will continue to administer some programming later this semester.
Tran said the ten-person Diversity Week Committee, which
comprises students from within and without the IC's four support groups and the International Club, had originally named
the programming "Cultural Week" but changed their minds
because "cultural" does not include differences among politi-

"WE WANT TO REACH OUT TO
EVERYBODY ON CAMPUS, NOT JUST
THE SUPPORT GROUPS, NOT JUST
THE SO-CALLED 'ETHNIC GROUPS/
AND NOT JUST THE RELIGIOUS
GROUPS."

cal, economic, gender and social positions in the Swarthmore
community.

Ta said these types of differences will be addressed in an
improv comedy workshop about social identities.
The events will commence with a kickoff event and recep-<
tion on March 25, featuring talks by President Al Bloom, Dean
of the College Bob Gross and a student speaker selected for
his or her original piece of writing.
Other events will include faculty and outside speakers, a
variety of performances from on- and off-campus groups, workshops and an interfaith discussion on service, as well as a
"Taste the Rainbow" theme dinner at Sharpies.

OPINIONS
EDITORUAL

Soiled ivory tower
In light of the last weekend's crime spree and this
weekend's Screw Your Roommate events, we offer a

simple reminder: be careful.
It is easy to forget that, despite the mental
boundaries we perceive, there are no physical

boundaries around Swarthmore. There are no
barbed-wire fences to keep danger out and perhaps
more importantly, no barriers to keep the people
already on campus from engaging in criminal
activities.
Last week at our editorial board meeting, we

discussed how safe we felt walking around
Swarthmore late at night. Last night, we were afraid
yes, at 3 or 4 a.m. Yet nothing
to walk home alone
has changed in the past week. The crime rate has not
jumped, there were no prison breaks down the road
crime was simply personalized.
There's been a great deal of talk around campus
centered around "ifs": "if only she had called public
safety for a ride" or "what if that had been me?" It is
important to remember that these crimes are not the
fault of the victims. Crimes are committed by the
perpetrator, not caused by victims' failure to be
careful.
However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't all be
more cautious. We leave our doors unlocked, we take
late-night walks by ourselves, but it isn't until crime
smacks us in the face that we even think of the risks
associated with our behavior. Here, these behaviors
seem completely normal; almost anywhere else
they'd be stupid and dangerous.
At Monday's Student Council meeting, the
discussion focused on preserving the concern
generated by the crimes to secure many safety
precautions students have wanted for years. Improved lighting, a more responsive Public Safety
department, round-the-clock vans and swipe-card
access to campus buildings were all mentioned as
possible improvements in campus safety. This board

hopes these requests will be addressed now, not put
off until later or swept under the rug as they have
been in the past.
There are many other improvements that could
be made
call boxes, more thorough and prominent
patrols and outreach efforts to make students more

aware of the safety measures that do exist. These are

all worthwhile efforts, and achieving any of them
would be a significant step forward, but it rests on
both Student Council and individual students to
push administrators to make these improvements
realities.

All hail the champs
We at the Phoenix are happy, for once, to write an
editorial which offers no suggestions, criticisms,
interpretations, or explanations. We write instead to
commend our women's basketball, badminton and
swimming teams on their recent conference champi-

onships.
No words from this paper could improve on their
performances; each of these teams was, at least for a
moment, an image of athletic perfection that we as
students should be proud to call our own. As they
continue to compete for higher accolades, they should
know how proud this school is of what they have
already done.
In the wake of the athletic cuts, these teams have
restored confidence and pride to all of the
Swarthmore athletic community. Where one stands
on the recent athletic issues can take nothing away
from the positive statement these teams have made
with their recent triumphs. Their success is an
example to all future teams that Swarthmore teams
can indeed flourish in the intercollegiate athletic

arena.
Men, hang in there. Your day undoubtedly isn't far
off.

We all need something to be proud of in our lives. However, I

don't think that attacking Mixed Company's Valentine's Day
serenades is a very good way to show it off.
There are several assumptions that were made in the piece
that are simply not true. First of all, the tone of the article
implies that all of the singers, myself included, are rich suburban kids who get a kick out of making fun of the poor.
While I can't speak for some of the members of the group,
I come from the most northern part of New York State. The
house I grew up in was only half a block from our local trailer
park. Prominent members of my community, as well several
of my friends, live in this trailer park. I would never call them
white trash, and I wouldn't make fun of them in any context.
Goldsmith has also assumed that the use of any words associated to poverty is a sign of rampant classism. I can assure you
this is not the case.
Let me enlighten everyone on the real motivation for the
"country" version of our Valentine's Day serenade. Several of
us in the group grew up surrounded by country music. Not
just any country music, but the most twangy, drawly form of
country music there is.
The "country" version was simply a parody of this genre
ofmusic. Had Goldsmith actually grown up listening to songs
with lyrics like "She thinks my tractor's sexy" and "There's
something women like about a pickup man" she would understand the humor in our parody. Unfortunately, Goldsmith
misinterpreted the song and in response felt it necessary to
paint us

as classist.

concerns about supposed retaliation against employees for
their participation in the living wage campaign mentioned
in Kae Kalwaic's letter in The Phoenix on Feb. 22.
No staff member ever needs to fear retaliation at
Swarthmore. We are surprised that anyone does. While employees' voices are no doubt silenced in some workplaces,
at Swarthmore our opinions and our concerns are always
welcomed
even encouraged
perhaps as part of
Swarthmore's Quaker tradition, in which everyone is considered a valuable member of the community.
We would like to reinforce Sharmaine LaMar's statements to staff members at a recent Living Wage and Democracy Campaign information session. She informed
them that it is not the position of the college to stifle employees and students from gathering or participating in
campaigns of mutual interest, in this case, regarding employment issues.
La Mar emphasized that employees should not be fearful of any retaliation over this or any other issue and that
they should immediately talk to either she or Melanie
Young if they believe they have experienced any form of
retaliation or intimidation. Anyone who has a concern that
she or he is not comfortable snaring elsewhere is encouraged to bring that concern to her or his SAC representative, to Sharmaine LaMar, or to Melanie Young. Your concerns will be treated with confidentiality.

Wage campaign too aggressive
evidence to support their position, the Living Wage Campaign
has unnecessarily turned to issues of race, gender and social

BY MORGHAN HOLT

Inside Paces
I know what most people think of Paces. I know
what I used to think of Pace. The service seemed far
too slow, the food and drink too uneven in terms of
quality, and the stafffar too distracted. They seemed
to be having a bit too much fun while my Andres
(which would eventually get to me uncooked) lingered
in the kitchen. Working at Paces seemed like the ultimate slacker job, where one could indulge in all
sorts of recreational activities while getting paid. So,
like many other Swatties, I grumbled, I complained,
though for all my bitching and moaning, I still went.

Now I work there. The common view of the Paces
staff is superficial, based on what people think they
see when they go there. My opinions of the place have
changed drastically since I started working there last
semester. Yeah, we have a lot of fun, and yeah, it's
probably one of the best jobs at Swat. But working at
Paces, especially on Sunday, is a love/hate situation.
Here's a glimpse into the average night at Paces, comprised from true occurrences this semester.
The staff arrives at Paces at 9:30 p.m. and begins to
set up the place. During setup, you realize that many
things are not as they should be. The last party in Paces
left the place in a nasty state cigarette butts on the
floor, the bar sticky and disgusting. Move into the
kitchen, and you're faced with more trouble. The pieces
from your espresso machine are once again M.I.A. The
industrial-size coffee machine decides that, once again,
it's going to make you guess how much water you have
to add to make one pot of coffee. Put in too little, the
damn thing refuses to work. Put in too much, it overflows. It is your nemesis, and you vow to seek revenge
when your manager isn't looking (a little motor oil in
the reservoir, perhaps?).
10 p.m. You brace yourself. By 10:03, all but two
tables in the place are taken, and there are around 15
orders up on your little dry erase board, 10 of which
are special-order milkshakes. You smash into your
fellow workers countless times in the narrow kitchen
as you run around trying to fill all the orders. In a
scene that would be comical if it didn't mean one less
coffeepot and glass on the floor, the barback opens
up a cabinet and a roll of aluminum foil flies out at
him, knocking the glass coffeepot on the floor. Your
manager then informs you of some grim news
a
table of first-years has managed to swipe two bottles
of cider from the 12 paid for by the staff.
As you stand behind the bar, grumbling about the
nerve of some people, you realize that you've run out
of milkshake cups, spoons, bowls and coffee cups, all
currently in use. You frantically attempt to bus some
tables, glaring at the person with the bottomless
milkshake. Maybe you could just snatch it out of her

hand? Nah. One server comes back to inform the staff
that a Student Council member whose favorite
number is 19 has suggested that servers wear shock

collars activated by buttons at each person's table to
inspire faster service. Ha ha. Funny joke. Yeah. Grr.
1 a.m., at last. Time to clean up. Put everything
away, clean up all the ice cream, coffee, etc. from the
bar. Mop all the floors. Wash all the dishes. 1:30 am,
you get your paltry tips, bid the staff good night,
and stumble back to your dorm room. You fall into
bed at around 2 a.m., thoroughly exhausted, definitely
not looking forward to your alarm clock's whine,
scheduled for 7:30 a.m. so that you can complete the
work that you didn't get to this Sunday night.
The next time you go to Paces, try to see things
from our perspective. We're Swatties just like you
we're tired, we have too much work to do, and it's a
school night. Yet, for four-odd hours, we try to earn
our keep by providing you with the one source of latenight coffee and food on campus. We're not perfect;
we're understaffed and probably underpaid. And yes,
we like to have fun, but we still work hard to get you
the best service we can provide. So, the next time
your service is a little slow, or your Andres isn't quite
don't bitch, don't moan, don't
cooked, J beg you
glare at your servers with disdain. Just sit back, relax, enjoy the atmosphere, and give Paces a chance.

I'd be the first to tell you that people ought to be appropritheir work. Likewise, I'd be the first to
protest if I thought there was a problem with workers' wages.
That said, the Living Wage Campaign seriously pisses me off.
Now, it's not that I have anything against supporting the
distribution of wages according to the cost of living. That's
fairness, plain and simple. It's also the employer's economic
responsibility, and to this end, employers should definitely
be called to task. In the instance ofSwarthmore the employer,
however, financial fairness is not a problem.
What bothers me most about the Living Wage Campaign
ately compensated for

is not that it exists (people have a
right, after all, to band together and
voice their grievances against any
system), but that its agenda has
been blown so grossly out of proportion. Advertise your cause, hold

status, things thathave more emotional influence. Please don't
tug at my heartstrings; just give it to me straight. Factually,
Swarthmore staff is well-paid, considering job descriptions and
qualifications. I don't think Days Inn pays its housekeepers
even $l2 an hour to scrub toilets and floors. The fact is,
Swarthmore staffreceive better wages and benefits packages
than do employees of the same caliber and capacity performing the same tasks elsewhere.
Another fact: our society is capitalist. Understanding this,
I would never, in my right mind, plead the case of my salary to
my employer on the basis of my having a child. That doesn't
enter the equation. It is not the
employer's duty, ultimately, to ensure that I am making enough to
raise my child. From the job applications I've seen and filled out, I
don'tremember once being asked if
I had a child and if that particular
job's compensation would provide
me with enough money to raise her.
It'd be kinda nice if they did, but
that's just not how it works.
Along those same lines, and in
response to another of the Living
Wage Campaign's emotionally
charged signs, this one discussing
the fact that the staffreceives a certain amount of vacation time during the year, but can't afford to do
anything during that time, it is not the employer's responsibility to ensure that employees can afford everything they
want. There are plenty of things I'd love to do but for money's
sake, cannot. That sucks, but it's life. An appropriate response
would not be for me to demand a wage increase from my employer, since, when it comes right down to it, it's really not his
problem.
There are aspects of the Living Wage Campaign that I support. I think people should make enough money to live reasonably. I think people should be paid according to the work
they are doing. I think it's important that we recognize workers' plight and that we do everything we can to minimize it.
I don't think, however, that the Living Wage Campaign
should dredge up subsidiary issues to try to increase their
support within the student body. I don't think that the Living
Wage Campaign should thrust itself on the students, faculty

I'm all about activism I think
the world could use more of it
but it's only effective if it's kept
within bounds. Wherever I go

there, pushing their petitions at
me, urging me to sign. I've been repeatedly accosted while eating in

what was that monstrosity, around 25 KB? I take great offense to this barrage of
persuasive tactics, and I'm further disturbed that the group
has resorted to invading our inboxes to convince us that theirs
is a worthy cause.
More than all of this, though, I am particularly offended
by the Living Wage Campaign's onslaught of illusory signs.
In an attempt to appeal to emotions (specifically, pity), the
Living Wage Campaign has fabricated some pretty appalling
fliers, and with them, some broadly sweeping statements
about Swarthmore staff and the world in general.
One, in particular, makes me grind my teeth more than
the rest. It stares me in the face as I open the door to Kohlberg,
close the doors of bathroom stalls, glance at the wall beside
my mailbox: Can your housekeeper, it needles me, support
her family on $8 an hour? Well, I silently respond to the repeated confrontations, I know for a fact that my housekeeper
does not have a family, and, furthermore, I'd be willing to bet
that a substantial proportion of the other housekeepers aren't
single-handedly raising children, as these signs would have
me believe. Moreover, a significant fraction of Swarthmore's
staffis male. Many of them are supportingfamilies. Why were
they not mentioned in these signs?
It seems to me that without ample persuasive economic

and administration in the tactless way it has. And I don't think
that the Living Wage Campaign should engage in such activities as throwing weekend parties, the cost of which could probably have afforded workers a quarter or so increase in Friday's
pay. The Living Wage Campaign needs to stick to its issues
worker compensation and a living wage
and stop scram-

bling to appeal to potential supporters by weakly attempting
to encompass a slew of loosely connected and not especially
relevant issues.

Poverty Week an important reminder of needed humility
Dear Editor:

With flyers everywhere announcing the arrival of Poverty Week, I've spent a lot of time contemplating my relationship with poverty. Until recently, for some reason I always
assumed that by virtue of graduatingfrom this place I would
change the world, become rich and famous and live happily
ever after. There is something about holding a degree from
the best (or second-best) liberal arts college in the country
that gave me a sense of confidence. Even if I don't hit the
seven-figure salary, I know that I will always be secure one
way or another.
But, the more I think about it, this certainty has a lot
more to do with my confidence in my family and their financial support than it does with my own merits. While the
chances are good that I will earn a decent salary and live
comfortably, there is no guarantee. The only guarantee I
have, really, is knowing that I come from a family that will
always be able to back me up.
This is not something to be taken for granted, though.
Not the fact that I was born into this privilege and not the
fact that life will be cushy for me when I get out of here.
'Cause it might not. Being smart and working hard doesn't
guarantee a thing.
This land of the free may call itself a meritocracy, but
that's not always the case. In our home of the brave, people

"YOU ARE JUST ONE STEP AWAY FROM

POVERTY, BABY. EVERYBODY IS."

who do not prosper are seen as failures. The flyers, though,
paint an even starker picture. Homeless and impoverished
people are not necessarily drunks, addicts and criminals as
the stereotypes would have you believe. These people are families, mothers and their children, people who had a job just
weeks ago. People whose lives are desolate and unstable, not
because they are "bad" people, but because for whatever reason, they can't just fall back on their parents or a prestigious
diploma.
I am not accusing myself or anyone of arrogance or false
pride for earning a Swarthmore degree. I am not accusing
anyone of anything. I am simply reflecting upon the bleak
reality that is life for so many people and how I am not really
as immune to it as I would like to think or as society would
like to have me believe. As one of the Willets housekeepers
said to me the other day, "You are just one step away from
poverty, baby. Everybody is." Remember that during this
important week.

The great politician's last scandal
BY DAVID HAENDLER

Clinton's last-minute pardon shenanigans come as a

great surprise to all of us who hailed him as the greatest
politician of our age. The former president has never been
an especially subtle man, but we expected him to realize
that passing "Get Out Of Jail Free" cards to plutocrat financiers, drug barons, prominent swindlers and other assorted Democratic fundraisers would have serious consequences.
Even the sleazy brothers of Bill and Hillary were seen
dipping their fingers into the pot, working to squeeze thousands of dollars out ofbeneficiaries of executive largesse.
Roger Clinton is like the banshee of ancient Celtic myth:
wherever he appears, death and disaster are sure to follow. When it became obvious
that the story wasn't about to go
away, Bill Clinton's public defense of his actions was so weak
and flimsy that it could have
come from the pen of Warren
Gamaliel Harding. In the wake
of this disaster, pundits across
the nation were forced to acknowledge that which was pre-

Secondly, I suspect that Clinton was relying on Bush
to do something drastic and/or stupid, which would over-

shadow his own mischief. Who would care about a mess
of shady pardons when the new president has just announced his intentions to invade France or put the Super
Mario Brothers on Mount Rushmore? It wasn't a bad
gamble to make, but Bush has made a relatively quiet
and orderly transition, forcing the media to look elsewhere for news.
Last but not least, Clinton thought that his old allies
loved and cherished him for who he was, not because he
wielded political power. This is a classic mistake, one
which narcissists are especially prone to making. If you
put a mangy, lice-ridden hyena in the Oval Office and declare that it is a Democrat, the nation's leading Democrats will line up to
praise the witless

IF YOU PUT A MANGY, LICE-RIDDEN
HYENA IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND

viously unthinkable
the
TeflonKid had gotten into a predicament he couldn't slip out of,
ruining an otherwise perfect
streak of victory over scandal.
What was Clinton thinking? How could a fellow so accomplished at manipulating public sentiment and the media rush headlong into PR catastrophe?
In my estimation, Clinton made three big mistakes
here. First, I believe that he overestimated public cynicism. By this point he thought the American people would
be jaded enough to view this sort of thing as par for the
course, and he was wrong.
This country has undergone decades of campaign finance follies, perjury under oath and countless abuses of
government power (not to mention the hoary ghost of
Watergate), but we're still shocked when wealthy, politically connected cronies of the president are allowed to
get away with criminal offenses. For the most powerful
quite naive sometimes.

nation on the planet, we're really

beast as the reincarnation of Socrates.
The same principle
holds for Republicans, Greens, Liber-

tarians, Reform, Socialists, and even the
hapless Natural Law
party. Liberals have a
lot of genuine sentiment for Bill Clinton,
but no true political
junkies will ever love
a man as much as they love power. Clinton did not realize this, and now he is paying the price as former supporters turn on him.
Will Clinton recover from this scandal? Oh yeah. He's
a tremendously resourceful man, and the Democratic
Party is going to need plenty of help and guidance in the
dark days to come. The American people will eventually
forget about Marc Rich in the same way that they forgot
about Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, the transfer of
missile technology to the Red Chinese, the serial groping
of women, Juanita Broderick's allegations, sleepovers in
the Lincoln bedroom, the bombing of Sudanese aspirin
factories and "I did not inhale." But true devotees of political disgrace will forever remember this as the moment
when the Master slipped up. It's the end of an era, folks.

Conference a shock for conservative Swattie
BY MATT RUBIN
Two weeks ago, I attended the Conservative Political Action Conference
(CPAC) in Washington, D.C. This con-

ference is the annual gathering of
many of the most conservative politicians and activists from around the
country.
The highlight of my weekend was
an encounter with Charlton Heston.
The text, as best I remember it, is as

follows:
Me: Hello, Mr. Heston. I was wondering if I could have a minute of your

time.
Chuck: Of course, young man. Shoot.
Me: Well, you see, I go to a very liberal school, Swarthmore College
Chuck (with Moses-like laughter):
Whooaaa yes!
Me: Yeah, and, well, I just started a
rifle club there. Problem is, it's a
Quaker school and they won't fund
our purchase of guns.
Chuck: James, have we got a program for this young man? We must
have a program for him.
Jon (Mr. Heston's improperly addressed bodyguard): Why, yes sir, I
suppose we could work something.
Chuck: Well, young man, you go and
call my friend here first thing Monday morning, and we'll see what we
can work out for you. Pleasure to
meet you.

THE HIGHLIGHT OF
MY WEEKEND WAS
AN ENCOUNTER
WITH CHARLTON
HESTON.
I am happy to report that this encounter has led to active communication between myself and representatives of the National Rifle Association (though, for the record, I am not
an NRA member, nor do I support
most, if any, of what they do) regarding how to secure funds for our newest campus team.
This was the only truly satisfying
moment of the trip, though, except for
playing poker with Dave Thomas'
family and friends and hearing some
riveting, if ridiculous, speakers, like
Jesse Helms and Oliver North.
From then on, I found myself in ideological arguments with just about everyone. I loudly ridiculed a man holding a sign which read "Family Rights
Forever, Gay Rights Never." Oh, and for
the record, that means I was arguing
FOR gay rights, just so no one gets confused and overreacts, since that never
happens at Swarthmore. But I digress,
so back to D.C.
I almost got into a fight with a group

ofanti-Zionists. The Death Penalty advocates didn't like what I had to say, and

neitherdid a group of Jesse Helms supporters. And don't even start with me
about the Christian Coalition. In fact,
other than Chuck and his group of Second Amendment Sisters, I didn't have
much personal luck at CPAC. It seemed
like no one wanted to agree with me.
Somehow, however, I wasn't surprised. In fact, I pretty much expected
that the conversations I was going to
have at CPAC, much like those I often
have at Swarthmore, were going to be
unnecessarily heated. There, just like
here, political disagreement tends toward the emotionally extreme. Logic
is secondary to heart, or lack thereof,
depending on your point of view.
When extremists, whose politics I
neither endorse nor decry here, discuss politics, passion is sure to dominate the conversation. Neither CPAC
nor Swarthmore, contrary to what I
once would have thought, are exceptions to any rule. Rather, they are the
rule, and in this ironic way are hardly
distinguishable from each other.
When I got back to Swarthmore, I
told a lot of my friends about my experience about CPAC. Many found it humorous and enjoyed the stories, most
of which I can't print here. But others
were quick to strike with heated rebuttals. I had left the politically charged
world of CPAC, but only toreturn to its
eerily similar counterpart on the Crum.

FRESH OFF
THE BOAT

Vicious institutions
[Editors' note: This column has been printed in its entirety,
exactly as it was submitted, with editing for spelling and punctuation only]
Ever since I joined this publication this semester as an opinions columnist, I have been looking for something to feel really
strongly about and though it took a while, itarrived in due time.
Ironically, my feelings and criticisms are directed at my very
vehicle of expression.
When I talk to my friends, I have random thoughts. I don't
pause before I say anything and edit for clarity or for form. If I
say something off the wall, I'll clarify. If I say something that
hurts them by mistake, I'll apologize and take my comment back.
Regardless of what I say, being a friend is about saying what I
think in the form I believe to be most appropriate for the circumstances. I expect that my friend who is interpreting my comments will do his best to figure them out appropriately. Consequently, this type of freedom leads to interesting conversations
in addition to a relationship that is nurtured constantly by innovation and spontaneity.
I write the same way I talk to my friends. I allow my thoughts
to be as creative to their full potential and I respect them for
what they may be, though they can occasionally be wrong or
even disturbing. However, when I submit my written thoughts
to this publication, I feel this type ofrespect for the original content and form of the material is given up for the sake ofthe mission of journalism. It is quite acceptable to talk academically or

journalistically about a topic that is relevant in the practical
sphere of issues, but my short experience here has shown me
that things that are outside this are not fully tolerated. I think
that is a shame because in only seeking one line of journalism,
the richness of diversity of voices is partially lost.
As a reader, I read enough structured things in my classes.
Be it in philosophy or in biology, in general what I read follows
pretty rigid paradigms the rules of academia. Even though while
reading and thinking, the room for creativity is sometimes there,
when it comes to writing papers, I have to settle down and endlessly distill my random thoughts into coherent academic arguments. Though I understand and accept its pedagogical value,
this obligation took some of the fun away from the adventure it
was reading. Regardless, I was still inspired by this stuff and
realized that though reading and writing are serious things, they
could be extremely pleasurable if approached less formally.
I guess my writing style can be at times unconventional and
I guess I might write poorly, but nonetheless, I believe that ifI
am writing, the words ascribed to my name should all be personal choices. This to me is sacred. Last week for instance, I
wrote an article that I submitted originally with 821 words. It
was cut to 600 and published with severe alterations in the original text. Things that were completely unrelated were conflated
into the same paragraph making some ideas totally incoherent.
Yet, the big issue for me was that there were certain stylistic
choices that I would have never made such as saying "Interviews with researchers and random students revealed the true
nature of the bug." My original article said, "This article will
try to clarify to the reader what this Bug is all about." This may
seem like a small subtlety, but I make a solid conscious effort
not to believe in "the true nature" of anything and to have that
type of ideology written as if it belonged to me is disturbing.
I appreciate the fact that the articles I submit go through
scrutinous editing for clarity and content, and I thank this publication for this if and only if I feel my article improves from the
process. My last article that was published still contained numerous grammatical errors, read poorly and in general was more
obscure than the original. Maybe this might not be true not under journalistic guise, but the criteria for writing is being recreated with every new piece that is written. The Phoenix as an institutiondid not properly consider my authorship, for as my piece
got edited, it was inevitably permeated witheditors' ideology I do
not necessarily agree with. And if it comes down to the fact that
my article was too long or inappropriate, I wouldrather have the
choice ofeither cutting it myself or not having it published.
Part of theidea ofwriting, especially opinions, should be that
opinions can be diverse both in content and in form and do not
need to stick to all the institutionalized norms and rules in order to be considered valid. The Phoenix has nonethelessproven
that it follows the tendencies ofSwarthmore College since though
the publication may contain provocative material in content,
the form in which this material is dealt with is usually dry, overly
structured and boring. While the college is an institution that
imposes rules and decisions on us, to which we eventually submit (as was seen with the football issue), The Phoenix belongs to
the student body and should become what we make of it instead
of institutionalized "poop."

Apples, bananas and oranges. Oranges, bananas

of terminally uninteresting repetition. Occasionally
they will try to satiate our lust for variety by giving
us rock-hard pears, but these are the good days. So
how come we can't have Lauren Tobias' fresh produce? The answer they always give us is that it costs
too much. After all, it's not like we have a billion
dollars sitting around in the bank to help us in situations like this. As your loyal columnist, it is my duty
to come up with some solutions to this dilemma.
Since they tell us this is a money problem, it seems
pretty clear we have to cut costs somewhere. I think
the obvious choice is the linguistics department. The
money saved from the linguistics department is
plenty to give us some more fresh produce. In fact,
it's too much. With the extra savings, I propose we
give each student on campus a motorcycle. Our daily
jaunts through the bitter cold are debilitating to the

option left is to give to give us some other means of
transportation. The body is the home of the mind,
and our minds are in danger.
Unfortunately, buying every student on the campus a motorcycle puts us in the red again, so we have
to cut some more costs. I think the clear choice is the
history department. All they ever do is bicker over
bygones over in posh Trotter, and who needs that?
While we're at it, this is a good chance to get rid of
those pesky activists who are always protesting and
telling us to do stuff we don't want to do. With the
extra proceeds, we could then afford to put up a big
windmillbetween Kohlberg and DuPont. As it stands,
our campus's main landmark is that bizarre creation
in front of Trotter, and we can't have that representing Swarthmore, now can we?
Not only that, but the new windmill will provide
power for the new economics building in front of the
president's house. Since all economics majors want
to do is make money, and all Al Bloom wants to do is

raise money, it's clear that we need more economics
majors. Unfortunately, this means we'll need to cut
costs again, and the philosophy department is the
clear choice. How much are our philosophy majors

going to contribute to the endowment? With my plan,
we'll never have to find out, and plus we can get rid
of that annoying Korobkin.
With the elimination of the activists, philosophers,
historians and linguists, we'll need some different
students to fill their slots. My television breaks a lot,
and the engineers proved last weekend they can fix
anything, so we'll definitely need some more engineers. They'll contribute to Al Bloom's endowment,
too. Also, economists tell us we are never satiated
with good things, so we'll need some more women
basketball players and women swimmers, and we'll
have to get rid of that awful softball team and republican rugby players.
Solving the whole fruit problem wasn't that hard,

now was it?

On Dec. 2,2000,1 was among the many
people who had our sports eliminated
from Swarthmore's intercollegiate athletic program. Along with this cut came
the most difficult decision ofmy life: staying at Swarthmore or going to a compa-

rable academic institution and playing
football. After many sleepless nights,
hoursof soul-searching and a trek up to a
snow-covered Carleton College, I have
come to a decision.
I have already seen three of my teammates, friends and brother-figures leave
Swarthmore as a result of this decision.
These individuals have been missed
dearly and the dynamic of this college has
changed in their absence. I am saddened,
too, by the collective apathy toward the
healing process we football players are
experiencing.
We are encouraged by many to simply "put it behind us." We are told to move
on and quit beating this dead horse. Well,
I havebeen irreconcilably hurt by this decision and forgetting what happened will
not be easy and sure will not happen any
time soon.

What doesneed to happen soon, though,
is choosing where I will spend the next two
years of my life. This is a decision that
many ofmy teammates have agonized and
deliberated over for the past two and a half
months. I truly fear either choice. I fear
Saturday afternoons in the fall not being

able to play the sport I love and the game
that has taught me so much. I fear being a
part of a college that can alter a fundamental aspect of its character and diversity
without involving the students or staff. I
fear studying in a building donated by a
man who supported the Board of Managers' decision. I fear being a part of a community with many members wholabel me
as an athlete first and a scholar second.
In my past, I have turnedand run from
my fears. I was a very different person be-

fore matriculating at Swarthmore two

years ago. This community, for the most
part, has accepted me and certainly taught
me many things, and I am a much better
person for it. My Swarthmore experience
has been an overwhelmingly positive one

because of the diverse and special people
that make up this college. Your empathy,
compassion and understanding havebeen
most plentiful and appreciated in this, the
darkest hour of my Swarthmore career.
And I am eternally grateful for it.
Despite feelingbetrayed by the administration of the college, despite having to
give up the game I have played for 12
years and whose lessons and experiences
have shaped me as much as anything, and
despite feeling devalued on account of the
secrecy and myopia that led to the Board
of Managers decision, I have decided to
stay at Swarthmore.
I would like to extend my most sincere gratitude to the membersof this community who have expressed so much care
and love for something many could not
fully understand. It is the call to action
and desire to seek the truth and justice
that motivated many to join us at our rallies and sit-ins. It is the 87 percent of this
campus who signed the football team's
petition asking that the Board of Managers reconvene and right this wrong. It is
the feeling of kinship and concern that
caused many people to send e-mails and

phone calls to me wishing me luck, expressing sorrow and lending their services in the healing process.
Many of these responses brought me
to tears, and it was in those moments that
I realized how lucky I am to be at
Swarthmore. For it is we, the student
body, who make this school. It is not the
Board ofManagers, wealthy alumni or the
administrators in Parrish. And in spite
of the pain I suffered at thehands of many
of these people, my love for the students
of the school has not waned; it has in-

creased.
We must learn from the events that
transpired on Dec. 2. Never again must
we act as a dormant party; we must continue to be proactive and seek what is
right. We must respond and be an active
part of our community, making sure our
opinions are heard and validated. We
must continue to question and never give
up the noble fights. We must remain committed and true to good causes.
I wishthebest ofluck to my teammates
who have yet to make their decision. The
best advice I can give is to listen to your
heart and not let the negativity ofothers
around you affect your decision. I also
want to thank you for some of the best
memories I have ever had. You are all excellent individualsand I am proud to have
known you all. What we accomplished is
not in vain, and the memories will last a
lifetime. I am truly indebted to the members of the Swarthmore College football
team. Always remember that the "one
heartbeat" will echo long after we have
made our decisions, wherever we end up.
We will always be a family, united by our
pride and passion. And nobody can take
that away from us.
I thank you all once again for teaching me so much. I look forward to two
more years of conquering my fears and
realizing I made theright decision today.
I know it will not be easy, but therewards
for me should outweigh the costs.

UN DEPTHI
The little program that could
BY SONIA SCHERR

It's 1:30 on a Monday afternoon, but no one's sleeping
in professor Lisa Smulyan's Introduction to Education
class. Seated in desks arranged in a large circle, the class
of approximately 25 students is putting B.F. Skinner's
theory ofeducation to the test. (Skinner, a 20th century
psychologist, regarded learning as the process of making a
desired behavior more likely to reoccur through reinforcement.)
The class is quickly transformed into a "Skinner box."
A student volunteers to leave the room while the rest of
the class decides on a behavior they would like him to exhibit. Suggestions include singing "Mary Had a Little
Lamb" and doing a headstand, but the class ultimately decides on making the desired behaviorbe erasing the chalk-

board. When the student returns, the class "reinforces" this
behavior by saying "yes" when he approaches the chalkboard at the frontof the room. After a few missteps such
as turning off the lights and clapping the erasers together
the student responds to a chorus of yesses and erases
Skinner's definition of learning that Smulyan had written
on the board.
But this is only the beginning of the class's work with
Skinner's theory. For the next hour, Smulyan leads the class
through various aspects of Skinner's views on learning.
Lecture blends with discussion as Smulyan encourages students to evaluate the theory and think about how they have
seen it applied, both in their own educational experiences
and in the classroom where they are observing as part of
the course's required field placement.
Overall, it becomes clear that the class is skeptical of

Skinner's theory. Although Smulyan occasionally plays
devil's advocate by pointing to ways in which aspects of
Skinner's theory might sometimes be useful for teachers,
the students question Skinner's rote, step-by-step method
of learning, which they say stifles creativity, fails to allow
for different learning styles, and does not promote an understanding of the concepts that underlie a particular skill.
Yet the class has no trouble recognizing Skinner's theory
in the real world of education. One student sees Skinner's
ideas reflected in a Chester kindergarten classroom, where
children are learning to read in incremental, mechanical
steps. Another student recalls helping a child with a math
worksheet that broke down fraction-writing into a sequential series of more basic skills.

The History
When most people think of Swarthmore, the education
program probably is not what first comes to mind. This is
not because the study of education isn't taught in institutions of higher education nationwide; on the contrary, in
1996-1997, the third highest number of bachelor's degrees
went to education majors and, at the graduate level, there
were more master's degrees awarded in education than in

any other discipline, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The field of education, however, has been

regarded traditionally as the province of large universities
and teachers' colleges, rather than liberal-arts institutions

such as Swarthmore.
But while Swarthmore's program may be small
with
three tenured faculty members, one additionalfull-time professor and generally one or two part-time adjuncts education courses are popular at the college. One out of three students takes Introduction to Education sometime during his
or her undergraduate career, and several hundred students
enroll in 15-16 education courses and seminars offered each
year.
Moreover, according to interviews with education faculty
and dozens of current and former students, not only have students' experiences in the education program influenced their
lives in ways both academic and personal, but education as
taught at Swarthmore is deeply embedded in the liberal-arts
tradition of the college.
"Education forces students to go meta," said dean of the
college Bob Gross, who taught in the education department
for six years in the 19705. "They must become self-conscious
learners, more effective learners across the board."
Providing students with a grounding in theory and an opportunity to observe in Philadelphia area schools, the introductory course is in many ways representative of the larger
program in education at Swarthmore, which aims above all
"to help students learn to think critically about the process of
education and the place of education in society," according to
program literature.
Like many aspects of Swarthmore, the study of education
is linked to the college's Quaker roots. In "An Informal History of Swarthmore," Richard Walton writes that part of the
founding mission of the college was to train Quaker teacher
for elementary and secondary schools. Friends such as Martha

Tyson, one of the college's founders, feared that Quakers would
assimilate into the larger culture if children were not taught
by teachers who shared the values of the Quaker community.
(Appropriately, the college awards a scholarship named after
Tyson to a woman student or alumna who intends to teach in
elementary or secondary schools.)
Although the college dropped education from its curriculum in the 19305, the program was revived in the 1950s by Alice
Brodhead, a Friend and the former head of a Quaker school.

Brodhead became the first director of the education program
at Swarthmore; she and one other professor were the only
faculty in the program in the early 19705.
In 1969, a change in Pennsylvania law made it possible for
small, liberal-arts institutions like Swarthmore to award teaching certification. Previously, only large universities and specialized teacher training programs could offer the range of
courses needed for certification. And until just a few years
ago, certification was required to teach in every public school
in the country, according to Travers. (Now, with the growing
teacher shortage, especially in urban districts, various emer-

Eva Travers is one of only three tenured faculty
members in the Program in Education.
gency procedures make it possible to begin teaching in
public schools without certification.)
While Swarthmore's program offered only a few courses
in its early years, it expanded in the early 1970s with the
arrival of Gross and professor and current program director Eva Travers, who specializes in educational policy and
urban education. Joining the program in the 1980s were
Ann Renninger, with a specialty in educational psychology, and Smulyan, whose area of expertise is social and
cultural perspectives on education. Diane Anderson, now
a full-time, non-tenure-track professor, specialized in literacy and is also the faculty advisorfor Learning for Life,
a program that allows students to work together with staff
members on topics such as literacy and computer skills.
In addition, adjunct faculty teach two or three electives
each year, including Environmental Education, Counseling and Special Education.

The Curriculum
Today, the study of education at Swarthmore occurs
under the auspices of a program rather than a department,
and students cannot major solely in education. Although
some students and alumni said they were unsure why
Swarthmore doesn't offer an education major, Travers said
the reason is primarily philosophical. "We think that education informed by another discipline is a more effective
way of thinking about education," she said, "especially at
the undergraduate level."
Gross expressed a similar sentiment. "I'm not keen on
a major in education," he said. "I would argue there's a
power and relevance in connecting [the study of] education with the rest of a student's education program."
In this regard, Swarthmore is similar to other institutions belonging to The Consortium for Excellence in
Teacher Education, which was founded in 1983 and whose
20 members are selective, private liberal-arts institutions

in the Northeast. Unlike many universities and teachers' colleges, consortium members gen-

erally do not offer education as a major; instead, work in education is integrated into the
broader liberal-arts curriculum.
But Swarthmore also differs from the majority of consortium schools in that teacher certification is not the primary or sole focus of its education program, according to Travers.
Instead, the college offers more broad-based educational studies.
One way for students to incorporate education into their program is to develop a special
major that combines education and a second discipline. This option involves a culminating
exercise, such as a thesis, that brings together both areas of study.
Another component of Swarthmore's education program is teacher certification. In addition to taking a sequence of education courses, students seeking certification must participate in practice teaching, which Travers calls a "culminating exercise." Students teach full
time, develop lesson plans, and assess curriculum.
According to Travers, the purpose of offering teacher certification is to allow students to
teach in public schools. But the supervised practice teaching students do as part of the certification process also enables them to "have a much more effective beginning teaching experience."
"Teaching is not all intuitive; some teachers can be made much better," Travers said.
"Knowing the discipline is necessary, but it is not sufficient, especially in elementary and
secondary schools with students from a variety of backgrounds."
Pointing out that the faculty in the education department began as classroom teachers,
Gross said, "For any career in education, some classroom teaching is at least extremely useful if not essential in order to know the context in which policy gets played out."
While the majority of students earn certification in social studies or English, some get
certified in science and math, and once every few years in a foreign language. Approximately
one-quarter of students earning certification do so in elementary education through a joint
program with Eastern College.
The Students
Travers said in a typical year the Education Program generally has 20 to 25 special majors, eight honors students and 15 to 20 student teachers.
In recent years, Travers said she has seen increased student interest in the education
program. The number of special majors has risen in the past 10 years, though it is difficult to
make comparisons to the early years of the program, when certification was the main option
for students. Moreover, changes made in the Honors program five years ago have allowed
students pursuing honors majors to incorporate education into their programs.
In addition, education courses tend to attract a fairly diverse group of students. According to Travers, the percentage of minority students in education classes is at least as high as
that in the college as a whole. Women continue to outnumber men in the field of elementary
and secondary education and, at Swarthmore, the ratio of women to men in education classes
is generally two to one.
Students who do get certified to teach generally graduate with a variety of job opportunities, Travers said, particularly in mathematics, science and foreign languages. A recent report from the American Council on Education states that the current major teacher shortage
means that the country will need 2.5 million teachers in the next 10 years. According to
Travers, the shortage has reached critical proportions in some urban areas.
But while the study of education is often equated with a linear career path that leads to a
permanent job teaching in an elementary or secondary school, this is not always
or even
the case for Swarthmore students. Some students and alumni are taking
predominantly
(or took) education courses with an eye toward a range of careers and life experiences, from

public policy to parenting.
A math major who also earned teaching certification, Gil Rosenberg 'OO is currently a
graduate student in math and a teaching assistant. Rosenberg highly recommends undergraduate work in education for students who intend to become teaching assistants in graduate school and then teach at a college or university. "There is little official educational training for these positions," he said, "so having some theory and practice really goes a long way
toward reflective and educationally sound higher education teaching." He added, "I'm sure
we've all had professors who we wished had taken an education course or two at Swarthmore."
Barbara Klock 'B6, a psychology major who received certification in elementary education, taught at Swarthmore's elementary school for several years before going to medical
school. Now, as a pediatrician, Klock said she finds herself teaching "every day."
Patrick Murray 'Ol is a history major who has taken a few courses in the education program. He plans to get a job in Washington, D.C. and pursue a career in educational policy.
A special major in education and environmental studies, Allegra Gordon 'Ol hopes to
apply education to whatever she does in life. According to Gordon, education does not occur
solely in the classroom and "is about sharing and communicating as much as anything else."
And others âlike Allison Young 'B7, a professor at Western Michigan Universityâare following the path of their education professors at Swarthmore by teaching prospective teachers.

Education and the Liberal Arts
Nationally, the study ofeducation at liberal-arts schools has not been devoid of controversy. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a backlash occurred against education from
those who felt it didn't belong at liberal-arts colleges. Some schools considered dropping
their education programs.
Swarthmore was not immune to the debate.
According to Gross, the college considered cutting faculty positions during a budget
crunch in the late 19705. Education was one of the programs "on the block." The argument
used against education was that the program amounted to vocational training.
Gross said, "Our argument [in response] was that we're sendingpeople out to Goldman and
Sachs, and that's not vocational. But students are going into schools and doing important work
and using their Swarthmore education, and that's vocational? Let's get our priorities straight."
Gross believes that the study of education is an important part of educating students as
citizens, since "schools are one of the significant institutions in our society, and education is
one of the primary roles of any culture."

Education students listen to a lecture in the resource center on Wednesday.
Moreover, according to Gross, "teaching allows students to use their liberal arts experience
and live within it." As a former high school English teacher, he recalled the "thrill" of being
able to draw on English seminars and other Swarthmore courses when teaching his classes.
A consortium statement, prepared in 1987 by Travers and Barnard College professor Susan
Reimer Sacks, maintains that teacher education programs integrated into thebroader curriculum have an important place at elite liberal-arts institutions, in part because these programs
encourage talented students to consider careers in education, particularly as teachers in public schools.
This is a view shared by other students and faculty, who feel that offering education at
schools like Swarthmore plays an important role in attracting bright, academically prepared

students to teaching.
"Teaching as a profession is not as highly valued in our society as many others," said Kate
Vivalo 'Ol, who is pursuing a special major in sociology/anthropology and education.
"Swarthmore students and students of that caliber are exactly who you want in a classroom."
Vivalo experienced firsthand prevalent attitudes toward teaching when she returned to her
hometown recently. People asked about her plans for the future, and their response was '"You're
just going to teach? You had so much potential,'" said Vivalo, who is considering doing some
teaching and perhaps pursuing a career in education administration.
For other students, the issue is the low pay teachers receive versus the high cost of education at schools like Swarthmore.
Young said that when she called home to tell her parents
who were teachers themselves
that she planned on earning her teaching certification in social studies, her father hung up
on her. "He really didn't want me to be a teacher and he was pretty angry," she said. "I wonder
now if the issue was about the financial stuffâ going to Swarthmore to become a teacher is an
expensive proposition, whereas most states have a couple oflocal universities that deal mostly
with teacher education." But while saying she "understands his response much more now,"
Young also said the learning that occurred for her at Swarthmore that could have been duplicated at a state university.
If the one of the goals ofoffering education at the undergraduate level is to encourage student's
interest in education, interviews with students and faculty revealed that Swarthmore's education program has made an impact in this area.
According to Travers, most students do not enter Swarthmore intending to take education
courses. In general, only three or four incoming students express interest in the program on
their applications.
"I think Intro to Education has such a good reputation that people take it and get interested
in education," she said.
Asked how they become interested in education, the vast majority of current and former
students told a story similar to the scenario outlined by Travers.
Jessica Lee 'O3, a sociology/anthropology and education special major, said she had little
interest in education before coming to Swarthmore. Then she took Intro to Education, which
she called a "great course."
"It pulled together thingsI had been thinking about social inequalities, racism and ways to
impact social problems," she said.
Young said she "pretty much stumbled into the education program." During the spring
semester sophomore year, she needed a fourth credit and decided to take Intro to Education
because it fit into her schedule.
"For the first time in my Swarthmore experience, I felt like I actually knew some things
and that I had something to say in class," she said. "I had Eva for that course and it kicked
my butt in a lot of good ways."
For others, the experience in Intro to Education deepened an existing interest in the
field. Thomas Crochunis 'Bl, who earned a degree in English with teaching certification,
went on to teach first high school English and then college writing and literature courses
before entering the field of education research publishing. Although interested in education in high school, he said he became "engaged" in the field after taking Intro to Education and teaching physical education during his observations at a school for children with
special needs. "That hooked me," he said.

Travers calls Intro to Education a "polished" course that
over the years has remained similar in terms of structure

she said.

A Multi-Faceted Approach
Many students and alumni also stressed that education
fits into the liberal arts curriculum because of the way it is
taught at Swarthmore.
"I see it as a discipline," said Eve Manz 'Ol, a psychology
and education special major. "The department teaches education not as a career, but as a field of inquiry."
According to those interviewed, the program focuses on
issues oftheory, research, and policy rather than on the technical aspects of how to be a teacher. "It's a much more intrinsic perspective on education," Young said, "studying

social institutions."
Another recurrent theme among current and former students was that education is an important part of the liberal-

arts curriculumbecause it provides an opportunity to combine
theory and practice.
According to Travers, most education courses include a field
placement, which may involve observing, tutoring, teaching

or research.
"This is where the theory is lived," Gross said. "It functions
education for the sake of studying it and maybe having ideas
in the way that a lab in science does. How do you know how the
theory works unless you see kids struggling with it and preferabout how to make it better."
Even the teachercertification process uses the metaphor ably struggle along withkids?"

demics and participant-observation in local
schools," as a course in which this synthesis could
take place.
But the study of education is also integral to
the liberal-arts curriculum, according to those
interviewed, because it allows students to reflect
on their own education and to learn about the
educational experiences of others. Although easy
to take for granted, students' educational experiences have played a significant role in their lives
for the past 15 years, shaping who they are and
their outlook on the world.
Chela Delgado 'O3, a special major in educational history, said, "You're able to look back at
your experience and compare/contrast thatwith
what you're actually learning in terms oftheory."
Walter Perez 'Ol, a history major who plans
to earn teaching certification, said his courses
in the program have exposed him to different
educational perspectives, allowing him to question some aspects of his own experience in a
Catholic high school.
Education courses have also enabled students
to examine their more recent experiences in
Swarthmore classes. Nicole Bouttenot 'Ol, a math
and education special major, said she had "a bad
experience with the math department at
Swarthmore," and her education classes helped

her understand why she struggled in some math
classes.
According to Gordon, education is necessary
so that "the college itself can more critically
think about what the experience of learning here
is like."
And while Swarthmore's goals no longer include training Quaker teachers, education remains bound up in the college's values of social

justice.
There is not even a stoplight in the rural
Florida town where Melanie Humble 'B6 has
taught for much of her career. "The kids I teach
will probably not get the chance to go to a
Swarthmore," said Humble, who majored in En-

glish with teacher certification. "I can bring a little bit of
it to them. I can bring those great books, those great professors, the lessons I learned from my peers, the critical
thinking to them. It seems a serious responsibility of elite
colleges and universities to spread the intellectual wealth
that way."
Crochunis said, "For me, it's more a matter of why
wouldn't education a key site of social change
be a
key part of every quality liberal arts education?"
The Impact of the Program
The vast majority of current students
and alumni who
graduated from the college in the past 25 years
said that
Swarthmore's program prepared them wellfor work in education.
An intern at the Maryland Department ofEducation dur-

ing the summer, Murray said his education classes taught
him to ask questions about gender, race and class when thinking about the validity of research. "The theoretical frame-

work prepared me very well to challenge the traditional way
of doing educational policy," he said.
Humble said she has been teacher of the year both on the
schooland county level, andbelieves these accomplishments
are 'a directresult ofthe preparation I got from Eva and Lisa."
The approach she learned toward teaching has played a
greater role than a specific skill, Humble said.
"You must be willing to look at [teaching] from many different perspectives, to analyze and think creatively," she said.
"You must be willing to collaborate, but also to challenge the
status quo. You must be willing to see that the process is the
product. And what I learned about teaching is that it is worth
doing."
Pointing to the difficulties of teaching, such as the low
pay and constant criticisms from government officials,
Humble said, "I'm not a Pollyanna about education, far from
it but, at the end of the day, Swarthmore gave me the tools
to do a job that seems significant to me."
Current and former students said the quality of the education program at Swarthmore ultimately comes down to the
faculty.

Summing up the consensus, special english and education major Ruth Shoemaker 'Ol said, "From group work to
lectures to discussion, it's very obvious that the professors
know how to teach and how people learn."
Many students said the education faculty played a significant role in their decision to study education, citing their
warmth, support and flexibility.
Perez said the education professors sometimes give two
pages of comments on students' papers and spend a substantial amount of time helping students, even meeting withthem

on weekends or talking over the phone.

English major Cathy Dunn '93 said she received "huge
amounts of help" from her education professors during her
first few years of teaching. For instance, she said, "several
Sundays a month, another Swat teacher and I would stop at
Eva Travers' house for dinner and help with our classes."
Referring to his professors in the education department
and his supervising teachers at Swarthmore's high school,
Crochunis said, "I felt that each of these people in their own
way connected to me as a person at some point and that made
a huge difference in how I felt about education."
Dougherty said the influence of the education program
and its faculty inspired him and three other classmates to
organize an alumni event, entitled "Reflections on Education
and Social Justice," for all current students in the program,
alumni and faculty. "The purpose [is] tobring together alumni
from several decades to reflect on the broad impact of
Swarthmore's Program in Education, to share our experiences with other alumni and current students, and to thank
the faculty for their hard work and dedication," he said.
To be held in October, the event will feature panels and
discussions, as well as keynote speaker Herbert Kohl, author
of "36 Children," a book that has been on the Intro to Education syllabus for many years. Forty alumni from 1974 to 2001
have indicated their interest in attending the event, and
Dougherty expects that over 100 alumni may register on the
event's Web site after additional publicity.
Young, another organizer of the event, said she realizes
that any impact she makes on her students will in turn affect
the students they teach. Through this "ripple effect," Young
calculated that she could reach 1,000 secondary students even
if she has an effect on only one of her own students. "If what
I do is so much of what I learned in Swarthmore's program
in education, then the next folks up the line deserve some
recognition," Young said. "Ann, Lisa and Eva have prepared
many teachers and scholars in the area ofeducation who are
effecting the landscape of education today... for such a small
program, they do a lot."

A dyke to watch out for
An interview with cartoonist Alison Bechdel
BY SUZANNE WU
To read Alison Bechdel's bi-weekly comic strip "Dykes to
Vatch Out For" is to make an emotional commitment.The
:omic is intricate, unexpected, maddening, convoluted and
ioap-operatic. It's one of those one-night stands turned
elationship where you bicker while you're having sex. In other
words, "DTWOF" is exquisite. And it's wicked smart too
the kind of humor where I laugh because I'm relieved that I
understand the joke, relieved that the characters share my
confusion over the most "politically correct" terms, relieved
I'm not the only one who cheats.
Bechdel's work has been on display in McCabe since
Monday, and she will be presenting an "illustrated lecture"
in the Scheuer Room today at 4:15 p.m.

SW: So. you expressed concerns in a few other
interviews about your 'assimilation anxiety.' You
worry about doing a subcultural comic strip in a
world where there is no more subculture, and yet
you doubt the possibility of your strip ever being
nationally syndicated. Talk a bit about this catch.
How do you reconcile a fondness for lesbian
subculture with the recognition that it creates a
limited audience?

$r

AB: Well, actually my strip is nationally syndicated,
meaning that it runs in a number of papers [over 70] all over
the country. Most of those are lesbian/gay papers, but a

m growing number are alternative weeklies that target a more
general audience, though not as general as the audience of
gf
a mainstream daily newspaper. have often said that if my
work ever ends up in the pages of a mainstream daily, that
Hi you should just take me out back and shoot me. That's not
because I don't want to reach a large audience but because
most comics in the daily paper are so banal.
Whether writing about lesbians necessarily implies a limited
audience is open to debate. Historically it's been trueâbut I don't
think it has to be the case. I believe it's not only possible to
communicate 'universal' ideas through a highly specific lens, but
that in fact that kind of specificity is the only way to authentically
represent human experience.

SW: The characters are being lauded increasingly as showing

experience. Talk about the transition from the 'politically correct'
label that was initially tagged onto your comic to the more
recent, almost PC-mocking tone.

MARCH 01 2001 THE PHOENIX

AB: Oh, man. Talk about 'political correctness' always sends me
into a hair-tearing paroxysm. First of all, the phrase 'politically
correct' is itself a 'PC-mocking' phrase. That's how it originatedâto
poke fun at the reductio ad absurdum of doctrinaire politics. People
use the phrase now in this completely ahistorical way that's a
reversal of its original intent. Okay. But at the same time, it also
bugs me that the underlying principle of 'political correctness,' which
is, after all, to be nice, has gotten such a bad rap. Being nice is not a
bad idea. In a way, 'political correctness' is a kind of affirmative
action. It's an attempt at leveling the playing field.
And yes, in some ways that can seem demeaning and insulting to
people, but it's better than the alternative of leaving the status quo
in place. That said, I would argue that it's not my 'tone' that has
changed so much as my context. I just saw a movie by the Farelly
Brothers, and it was really fascinating because it was clearly a
backlash against the sort of institutionalized multiculturalism that
these guys grew up with on TV in the 'Bos. It opens with a scene
where a black guy who's also a dwarf beats up Jim Carrey with a pair
of nunchuks because he thinks Jim Carrey said something racist. It
was offensive and funny at the same time, but it was clearly a way
of dissipating the tension that the dominant culture feels about the
shifting balance of power it's no longer okay to make fun of
people for being different than you, but if you do it flagrantly enough
and with this self-conscious, postmodern frame around it, you can

get away with it. But I think backlash is an
inevitable element of progress. The Farelly
Brothers would be out of business without the
progress in social justice that has happened in
this country in the last several decades
they'd have nothing to push against. Same for
South Park and Eminem. It's all part of the
mix. In some ways my work has followed this
trend like with my character Sydney, who's
very critical about lesbian culture
and in
other ways my message hasn't changed. Even
in the 'politically correct' 'Bos, my strip was
about the tension between idealistic principles
and the compromises required in real life. I've
just learned, perhaps, to disguise my dogma
more skillfully.

SW: How does it feel to be 40? Do you
feel estranged from younger lesbian comic book artists such as
Ariel Schrag? Or just from younger lesbians in general? Or is
there some cohesive bond in the lesbian community that does
not take into account age?

AB: Getting older is a very strange thing. I guess I am pretty
estranged from younger lesbian comic book artists because I just
did a Web search to find out who Ariel Schrag was, and I'm
completely blown away. She's amazing!
I find that it's exponentially more difficult as the years go on to
keep up with new things that are happening. In some ways that's bad
obviously you don't want to get in a rut or closed off to new
influences. But in another way, you just can't be open to everything or
you'd never get your own work done. I find that I'm able to focus on
my work now with a kind of intensity I didn't have when I was younger.
SW: Are your cartoons in any way autobiographical? Are the
issues that the characters deal with parallel to issues that you
are dealing with?

AB: Sometimes I'll work stuff out in the strip. When Vermont
passed its Civil Union legislation last year, this bill that says gay men
and lesbians can sort of get married, I vented all my ambivalence
about it through my characters. Mo felt like it was a terrible thing for
gay people to buy into the system by getting married. Toni felt like it
was a really radical step. I felt both these things. But the strip isn't
really autobiographical. If it were, it would be astonishingly dull
because all the characters would do is sit in their basement all day
and all night writing comic strips.
SW: Which one of your characters is most like you? Or are they
all in some way reflective of certain aspects of your personality?

AB: They're all aspects of myself, but lately Sydney is the most
like me.
SW: When was the last time you cried?

AB: Jeez, it was while I was watching
TV the other night. I can't think what it
was maybe something on the news, or
...

more likely, a particularly manipulative
commercial.

SW: So you mentioned also, in
another interview, that you hate Cathy
but can't help reading it because you
are a cartoon fiend. Is there any
particular reason, then, that you don't
read superhero comic books?

AB: I've never been remotely
interested in superhero comics. The real
world is so incredibly rich and magical,
who needs anything more?

New urinals defy logic
For those of you who don't use the
men's bathroom on the first floor of
Kohlberg with any frequency, a new "noflush" urinal has recently been installed.
This was a mind-blowing development for
me, so I thought I would add my thoughts
on the situation.
First, I set out to do some solid research.
Conveniently enough, there was an explanatory and informative flyer posted
above the urinal. It is very nice, professional (if Kinko's is professional) and even
laminated. These no-flush guys do not
mess around. And neither do I, so I stole
the flyer, took it home and thoroughly
washed it with me in the shower.
Then I got to work. After reading over
the flyer a couple of times, I decided
against calling the toll-free number. Instead, I did a Google search and found the
web page. Their site was fairly informative (www.waterless.com if you are interested), but it had that same we-want-to-betaken-seriously desperation that so many
other radical toilet designers have. Still,
it provided lots of factual information,
which is what I was looking for, so I cannot complain.
I learned a lot. First of all, the no-flush
fixture "saves up to 45,000 gallons of water
or more per year." In addition, it also
"greatly reduces typical urinal maintenance and improves restroom sanitation."
And, while I believed that they have been
"saving global water resources since 1991,"
I was still stubbornly skeptical.
I needed more convincing; I needed
more information. I wanted to see which
model we had, and it appeared to be either
the Sonora or the Kalahari. Because of the
shape of the bottom of the fixture, I don't
think it was the Sonora. (The Sonora, by
the way, is ADA compliant, which I hope
stands for something other than the
American Dental Association.) I decided
that Swarthmore was indeed the proud

new owner of the Kalahari Model 2003. It is
their best seller, so this conclusion made
sense.
I had no problems with my discoveries
thus far, but then I hit some hitches. I think
that the so-called "Eco-Trap, Principle" did it.
It gets fairly technical here, but please stick
with me. The urine first heads through the XTraptor, Access Slots. Now in the EcoTrap, the
human waste "passes through a floating layer
of Biodegradable Blue Seal, liquid." This is
done to seal in offensive vapors. While the actual urine is drained away, the EcoTrap cap-

#

tures remaining sediment, and, therefore, has
to be replaced every few months.
I hope that every reader has knee-jerk reactions to this the way I did. While I have no
doubt that the EcoTrap is an amazing technological breakthrough, I have concerns with its
results. As I understand, it collects what is
essentially a urine residue conglomeration. I
am very wary of this pee-chunk or block-ourine or pisscicle whatever you want to call
it. Honestly, it scares me.
The goodpeople over at Waterless also brag
that their bathroom device has no moving
parts. This sounds good in principle, since,
theoretically, nothing can break, but it usually doesn't work out. For example, I thought
those gripshifts on my mountain bike were
great when I was 15, but most people don't use

For parties, mindset matters more than venue
BY MORGHAN HOLT
I'm a fly on the wall, or might as well be. Blending with the
crowd, no one notices meas I push my waypast grinding couples
double-fisting drinks that they don't seem to realize are spilling
out of their cups and onto the front oftheir dresses or the person
dancing next to them. I am incognito, an undercover investigativereporter, only I've opted against Hunter S. Thompson's style.
I am stone-cold sober, weaving my way through the swaying
crowd of my not-so-sober classmates and tri-co students of the
female persuasion. Swat parties. What a trip.
Leaning lackadaisically against the wall, I survey the crowd,
my eyes resting on a wild duo busting it out to Britney Spears,
skirting another couple getting hot and heavy in the corner
next to me. That's the problem with Paces, I think. Britney
Spears and no place for the folks who haven't come out to dance.
At least at Phi Psi, DU and Olde Club, there's another area,
one designated for activity of the non-dancing variety.
Although, I realize as I watch a gaggle of giggling, tipsy
girls tumble out the door beside me, chattering about finding
their way to the bathroom, there is ample bathroom space,
and that's a definite plus. So chalk one up for Paces' having
multiple bathrooms and, usually, toilet paper on therolls. And
chalk one up for Phi Psi and DU for my never having been
tortured by Britney's baby babble at any of their parties.
Olde Club as a party venue has an utter lack of usable
space. The mere thought ofgoing to an Olde Club party makes
me claustrophobic. I hate the stair situation, and the coat
storage situation is a bit lacking as well. Having to stash your
stuff in the bushes so that you can find it later doesn't go over
well with me. When that place fills up, it's hellacious. There's
simply not enough room to dance, or stand on the balcony,
for that matter, and, even downstairs, there isn't enough space

to stand around and talk. Bathroom accessibility and workability is another major downfall in this particular party locale. This limitation lends itself to my uneasiness about Olde
Club parties, not just because I personally hate peeing in the
bushes, but also because I balk at the thought ofother people
peeing in the bushes and accidentally dampening my hidden
coat/bag. All things considered, Olde Club is, by far, the worst
place to hold a party on this campus.

The DU house has its share of spatial issues as well. The
staircase at DU is substantially worse than that of Olde Club
because it's got an awful twist in it that, without fail, always catches someone off-guard and sends them, oblivious
in their inebriation, tripping and tumbling, stopped from
falling only by the hoard of cursing people in front of them.
The downstairs area at DU is all right, just for the fact
that it offers non-dancing space, but it's still a little cramped,
owing primarily to the wide expanse of the Beirut table and
its monopolization of the room. That, and the staggering, confused line to the inevitably filthy, toilet-paper-less bathroom
makes it nearly impossible to maneuver through the basement without taking an elbow to the chest, or enduring considerable pain as some sloppy guy trips backward, planting
his hefty mass directly atop your foot. And what's with that
roll of carpet on the stairs leading to the second floor? Talk
about an unnecessary encumbrance. The couch setup and
coat space is a littlebetter than Olde Club, and the courtyard
offers reasonable relief from the sweaty dance floor, but DU
remains not far removed from Olde Club as a party venue.
Wharton C/D basement manages to distribute and make use
of its space a little more effectively, which is mostly a result of
the space being limited enough that its use must be maximized.
Wharton C/D manages to encompass the Beirut tableand space
for both dancing and mingling and, while it does tend to get

mildly cramped as people file in, the bathroom accessibility also
contributes to C/D basement parties' enjoyability.
I tried my best to be a fly on the wall again at Phi Psi's
Heaven and Hell party Saturday night, but I found it tough to
blend into the new decor, and I couldn't help indulging myself. I quickly discarded my anti-Thompson vow to maintain
sobriety in my work. Perhaps my readers will likewise enjoy
my first-hand account of the ice luge, loosely comparable to
his account ofmescaline experimentation. At least, that's what
I told myself as I weaved through the crowd into the small
room and positioned myself before the steaming block of ice.
Working my way downstairs, I was pleased to see the couches
filled, people leaning on each other, chattering in typical drunken
Swattie style. For all its alleged sketchiness, Phi Psi sure knows
how to throw some decent parties, which I think is primarily
attributable to their optimal use of space. The Phi Psi brothers
have repeatedly gone out of their way to decorate the house for
their parties, which, owing to DU's loss ofliquor licensing, have
been especially frequent over the course of the last semester.
Aside from the piss-poor bathroom situation, Phi Psi is the perfect party place, offering space for dancing and space for mingling/kicking game, but keeps them distinctly separate, which
allows for a truly integral party experience.
When it comes right down to it, though, Swat parties really
aren't about the party, or the place, even. It's more of a mindset,
and not necessarily one of inebriation. It's what you put into
the experience, really, that matters. Torn from your bed and
the TV andforced to go out, you'll obviously struggle to get into
the party, despite good mixed drinks (think Russian Club party),
phat decorations or hoards of scantily-clad Bryn Mawr women.
If you're out to party, use the above criteria to mentally weigh
party venues against each other, but keep very well in mind
that, for the most part, the fun is up to you.

Feet to travel back in
time for alumni concert
BY DANIEL MARRIN
In 1976, the world was changing. Rich white girl Patty
Hearst was convicted of armed robbery in May. Democrat
Jimmy Carter was elected president in November. The golden
age of Hollywood was coming to a close as "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest" swept the Oscars. The Boston Celtics took
home the NBA Championship. Philadelphia hosted the 46th
annual Table Tennis Championships.
At Swarthmore, the 1976 Halcyon documented the incredible Oktoberfest with a Slip 'n Slide that ran the Beach for the
full length of McCabe. Meanwhile, music was everywhere,
from WSRN to the huge gospel choir, from productions of"The
Pirates of Penzance" and "West Side Story" to a brand-spanking-new a cappella group dubbed Sixteen Feet.
In 2001, the same city that once hosted the Table Tennis
Championship now looks to dominate the NBA Playoffs.
Things ain't what they used to be at Swat, either. Football is
gone, and this year's slipping and sliding has been limited to
ice skids. However, women's swimming continues to rock, and,
of course, Sixteen Feet lives on, with some seniors who are
the last remaining children of the 19705.
Last Sunday night, the all-male a cappella group was down
to 14 feet, with two out for penance. Walking down Lang hall, I
encountered a high-pitched voice singing Stevie Wonder: "You
can fee-yell the-ah luh-uu-UH-uhve." I opened the doors to find

seven men sitting, standing or crouching around a grand piano. The Feet, in their entirety, belong to Dave Ramirez 'Ol, Mike
Smith 'O3, Andrew Meade 'O3, Allen Frost 'O4, Andrew
Breitenberg 'Ol, Chris Morello 'O3, lan Kysel 'O4, the Brothers
Gregory (Evan 'Ol and Andy 'O4) and Gabriel Tajeu 'O3. Kysel
and Morello keep the steady bass, while the others rotate parts.
They turned to me, in anticipation of questions. I started with
an obvious question: Who are your influences? The seven Swatties
turned to each other and began delivering answers all at once.
Smith cited Walt Disney as his main inspiration. Later came 'N
Sync and some guy named Justin Timberlake. At one point, trying to discuss the diverse nature of 16Feet's music, Meade referred

to a rapper that only heknew of named Big Hairy Bastard. Receiving blank stares, he was quickly corrected by Ramirez, who asserted that the fine rapper was actually named Old Dirty Bastard.
Ramirez then congratulated Meade, saying, "You are now officially
whiter than I am." After all the confusion, Tajeu turned to me,
smiled widely, and said, "Prince. Definitely Prince."
Then I got personal. Who here has been singing the longest,
from the earliest age? Once again, the lucky seven turned to
each other in confusion. Did you have to have been singing in a
choir? they wondered. In a good choir? Or maybe just in the
shower? Ramirez claimed to have been singing since the age of
eight in choir. Kysel challenged him, saying he had been in
"The Sound ofMusic" at the age of five. Ramirez seemed briefly
beaten until suddenly Evan shouted, "BUT WAIT! Technically,
since Ramirez is four years older than you, lan, he was actually singing a year BEFORE you at the age of eight." Although
the singers appreciated this logic, the issue remains unresolved.
Who's got the lowest pitch? At first, the award seemed like
it would go to the basses, but Evan claimed superior skill. They
began trying to hit the lowest notes on the piano, and the contest turned rapidly repulsive. Imagine a bunch ofTibetan throatsingers engaged in a belching contest and you might be able to
conceive of the kind of sounds that filled the room. My question remains unanswered and I intend to never ask it again.
Finally, I broke out the big guns and asked the toughest question: Why no instruments? The lucky seven turned silent and
pensive, and then Evan blurted, "portability." Ramirez stretched
back in his chair and whispered that it was '"Cuz chicks dig...
guys without instruments." But according to Smith, it's actually men with "big... vocal cords" that chicks dig.
This Saturday, these undeniably entertaining men will play
host to alumni singers from as far back as the original Feet of 1976.
The reunions began with the 16th anniversary of 16 Feet in 1991
The men again regrouped for their 20th anniversary, in 1996, and,
this weekend, the Feet will celebrate 25 years of a cappella bliss.
Hugh Weber 'OO has organized this year's event, which boasts a
list of invitees compiled from years of research. Some alumni vocalists have entered the music industry as agents, and one or two
are still struggling to be professional singers. Each group ofalumni
Feet will sing a set, with Feet from the classes of 1976,1980 and 1985
...

all presenting thesounds oftheir eras. The festivities begin Satur-

day night at 8 p.m. in Lang and will be hosted by the Sixteen Feet
of 2001 The music will be hip, fly, jamming, groovy, funkadelic.
Jimmy Carter won't be there, Patty Hearst will still be in jail and
Allen Iverson is too busy. Maybe, though, if you just clap your
hands and believe, Meade's special friend, Big Hairy Bastard, will
show up for an exclusive guest appearance.

Sushi chef Hong Lam, left, and head sushi chef Zama Tanaka whip up culinary delights for the hip Pod crowd.

Pod an experience for all senses
BY JUSTIN KANE
When traditional Japanese culture became chic in the
late 1980s and early 19905, trendsetters latched on to Zen
Buddhism, tatami mats and sushi. Today, with Japanese
pop culture all the rage, it's anime, J-pop and, well, sushi.
Which explains Pod, restaurateur Stephen Starr's latest foray into what he calls "Pan-Asian" cuisine at the Inn
at Penn. Pod is your basic sushi and dim sum fare, futuristically packaged and elevated into the realm of the iibercool by Starr's conceptual approach to the restaurant.
Like Starr's Buddakan, with its 10-foot golden Buddha, Pod isn't just eye candy
it's candy for all five
senses. Designed by renowned interior designer David
Rockwell, Pod could be an interstellar lounge in the year
2100. Awash in white plastic and brightly colored lights,

the restaurant takes its name from the multiple "pods"
found throughout, small semi-private rooms bathed in
the light color of the diners' choice. Japanese pop music
blares over the obnoxiously loud conversations ofblackclad hipsters and middle-aged businessmen trying hard
to be cool with their heavily perfumed dates. The scene
among Philadelphia's trendiest
is almost too overwhelming, but I couldn't help being impressed.
More stunning, however, are Pod's two bars
one
for alcohol, the other for sushi. The former bar consists
of a sleek white bar top and bizarre, Martian, red foam
structures for patrons to sit upon. Pod's signature drinks,
like virtually everything else, are color-coded, but other,

more traditional drinks are available.
The real show-stopper, though, is the sushi bar, or to
be more precise, the sushi conveyor belt. Baby blue bar
stools encircle the raw fish race track and, in the center,
head sushi chef Zama Tanaka and sushi chef Hong Lam
whip up delectable dishes in their work space. Individual

sushi platters prepared by the chefs circle the conveyor
belt, color-coded and ready to eat. Mounted on the wall
above their heads, a large video monitor broadcasts
to fulfill your voyeuristic
anime, snazzy graphics and
desires live video ofother diners eating.
And that's where I started
not because I wanted to,
but because I had to. Reservations are a must if you want
a table, but if you go before 9 p.m., you'll likely be able to
get a seat at the sushi bar, even on the weekend. That's
not to say the sushi bar is a bad seat. In fact, I was seated
at the bar with my back to the wall and the chefs to my
side, affording me both a view of the spectacle as well as
access to the chefs' recommendations.
So with Hong by my side, I made my way through the
attractively designed menu, which is bound in
you
guessed it
white plastic. Hong steered me away from

the dim sum and entree menu
a little pricey for the
student budget, with the average entree costing $2O
and toward the sushi menu. I started off my meal with
hotate ($8), fresh scallop sushi served on the shell.
Perhaps the most mesmerizing aspect of the evening,

far better than the white plastic and J-pop, was watching
the sushi chefs work. Everything the chefs need is at the
bar, including fresh seafood shipped from New York daily,

and their command of their ingredients and their knifes
is awe-inspiring. If you're at the bar, keep at least one
they're artists, really.
eye on the chefs
Although I admit I usually steer clear of shellfish, the
hotate genuinely surprised me. The flavor was smooth and
fresh, as it should be, and a dash oflemon only added to

that impression. The hotate was undoubtedly thebest sushi
I tried, significantly fresher than Pod's other offerings.
Which is perhaps why the food went downhill from
there. With Hong's approval, I moved on to the salmon
sushi ($4.50) and the ahi tuna roll ($6.50). Typically among
my favorite varieties of sushi, the salmon and the tuna
lacked the robustness that usually comes with especially
fresh, high-quality fish. I've had fresher in Philadelphia
and elsewhere. When you depend on raw fish for flavor,
anything less than fresh is disappointing and tastes either bland (the salmon), dry (the tuna) or worst, fishy
(thankfully neither).

I closed the evening with live uni ($l5), or sea urchin.
Hong had been taunting me with the urchins all night, and
finally my adventurous side gave in. The sushi is prepared
by scooping out the insides of the urchin (because the outside is mildly poisonous), extracting the sea urchin eggs,
filling the inside with shredded daikon, and putting the eggs
on a leafoflettuce. I've never had uni before, but once I got
past the somewhat slimy texture (which is well-balanced
by the crunchy daikon), the taste was intriguing.

I'd characterize Pod's cuisine as uneven

some dishes

excellent, others merely good, but all overpriced
and
without Hong's help, the service would have been lacking. There are better places for sushi in the Philadelphia
try Sagami in Collingswood, N.J., Genji in Uniarea
versity City and on Spruce St. or best yet, hold out for
the arrival ofStarr's latest venture with "Iron Chef star
Masaharu Morimoto on Seventh and Chestnut but that
might be missing the point of Pod altogether.
Pod isn't about the food; it's about the experience. And
while it's true that concepts inevitably grow tired, and

Visually oriented 'Mood' engages even the critical
BY ESTER BLOOM
the obscure dead
I felt like Diogenes this weekend
Greek guy who took a lantern and went searching for an
honest man. Having been informed that I am getting a reputation for being too negative, I went searching for a likable
movie. Diogenes' search ended in a bathtub, I think; mine
ended at the Ritz 5 with "In the Mood for Love."
It's a Chinese film, so expect subtitles. Hopefully "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" has acclimated everyone to those.
But even if it hasn't, don't be put off: the dialogue, while
understated and precise, is not that important. "In the Mood
for Love" is an intensely visual experience, as choreographed
as ballet and as hypnotic as a spiral-striped spinning disc.
In fact, I got so caught up, I missed the entire last 15 minutes. I have no idea how it ended.
Luckily, the plot is not terribly important either, although
the story, set in a Chinese city in 1962, is engaging. Two
couples move next door to each other. The audience is introduced to one wife, Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung), and one
husband, Mr. Chow (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). She is a very
competent secretary, organizing her boss' appointments with
his mistress and buying presents for his wife. He is an editor who helps out deadbeat friends who have, between the
racetrack and whorehouse, been parted from their money.
Each rarely smiles.
Even after discovering that theirrespective spouses are
having an affair, they maintain their composure. Quietly,
carefully, they begin a friendship. Since both of their
spouses travel, they comfort each other by assuming the
characteristics of the other's absent partner. Disturbingly
soon, Mrs. Chan has Mrs. Chow down pat, as Mr. Chow
has Mr. Chan.
Consciousness of propriety prevents them from letting
themselves be seen together in public. When, one evening,
Mr. Chow's landlord arrives home early, Mrs. Chan waits

in Mr. Chow's room for a moment so she can slip out undetected. But, as the landlord's wife starts a game ofMah Jong
that lasts until dawn, Mrs. Chan remains trapped in Mr.
Chow's room. Though the sexual tension is palpable, they
never touch.
No one has ever fallen in love on screen so gracefully.
One of director Wang Kar-Wai's techniques is setting a camera in one place, like the bottom of the stairway or a specific brick corner marked by a broken drainpipe, and recording the small changes in daily interactions that occur
from that particular vantage point. Over and over, we watch
Mrs. Chan descend the steps, her hips swaying to the same
music, as Mr. Chow ascends. They pass each other and,
when they eventually brush, we feel them shiver.
That methodical, ghostly beauty distinguishes every
scene, many of which are shots of nothing but dripping water, uncurling smoke, or Mrs. Chan's undulating hips.
Simple things that, along with the repeated strains of corresponding music, leave the viewer entranced.
And to those who scoff that this doesn't count as a positive review because "Mood" is an indie, I remind you that
"The Mexican" comes out next week. It is 100 percent mainstream, stars Brad Pitt and, I assure you, I will enjoy it
wholeheartedly.

Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan in "In the Mood for Love."

BY KATE O'DONNELL
The more I think about it, the
more I thinkthat there's a very thin
line between what is "real" and everything else. And the more I think
about that the more I think that really, it doesn't matter. 'Cause it gets
down to relativism and Cartesian
dualism and the Oversoul and the
meaning of life and a whole headache of other perplexing issues.
So I just "be," and hope to appre-

ciate some of the beauty that surrounds me along the way. I think
that Lauren Tobias 'O2 and Liz Cho
'Ol are attuned to appreciating the
beauty that surrounds them too.
Their show in Sharpies 111 (which
feels like springtime, somehow) exhibits photography in which beauty,
in all shapes and forms, is featured.
And soul is captured (yes, contrary
to what you might think, I dobelieve
that photography can
and does
capture the soul.) But not in a "beautiful sunset, been there, seen that"
sort of way. Though both women's
works have distinctive voices, both
convey a sort of beauty that takes
the quiet contemplation of a keen
eye
a human one and a mechanical one
to be perceived.
Tobias' show is called "Silver
Tones." I imagine that to her fellow
photographers, this title provides a

telling clue to aid in their apprecia-

tion of the technical aspect of her
work. To be honest, I know very
little about the ins and outs of the
medium, so to some extent, the title
is lost on me. What is not lost on me
is how Tobias relishes the sensuousness of that which surrounds her.
She says that she is not interested

in reality so much as an abstraction thereof, one through which
something delicate, something tactile, something precious is revealed. The eye caresses her photographs of various parts of a
woman's body, dwelling in the folds
and curves, the planes and crevices. These are universal parts
human, but not individual. They
are about softness and loveliness
(a word Tobias uses often) and call
for introspection and circumspection. Tobias' photographs beckon
the viewer into a world often ignored. The world is that which surrounds us but which is not regularly appreciated, and not exactly
reality. And thus it is familiar but
intriguing. Her work is deceptively
simple in that it dwells on the corporeal, but in this interest, her
work is exceptionally thoughtful.
Cho's work is contemplative
also, but with a different focus.
Entitled "images of silence," Cho's
show, which was influencedby the
ethos of photographer Henri
Cartier-Bresson, explores different
aspects of silence. Cho recognizes
the irony in capturing something
aural through the visual and something ephemeral for eternity, but in
so doing, she is capturing truth.
Words cover truth; silence is the
most honest, most real aspect of a
person, within a person. In her own
way, Cho is interested in an essence. But her essence is not as universal as that in Tobias' work.
Rather, it is highly specific and exists in the unstated communion between herself and the subject and
between the viewer and the photograph. The subjects range from

nude women to little boys to stairwells and dwell in places near and
far, from Swarthmore in "memory
of mary" to Rome in "ceremony" to
Taiwan in various other photographs. In each of these pieces, a different aspect of silence is expressed
and an alternative one is created.

,

Photographers attuned to a quiet beauty
For in meditating upon the captured
silence, the viewer discovers her
own understanding of another silence. And through this silence,

truth is exposed.
Both women, in their own way,
explore a world that is ordinarily
overlooked. It is not a fantastical
realm, but it is a reality that is often
evaded. Their show is a breath of
fresh air, and in this sense, it reminds
me of springtime, when senses are
heightened and people can be aware,
a time when truth seems clear-cut.
The show imparts light and shadows, and sensuousness and humor
and poetry and loveliness enter into
the viewer's consciousness. The
lines between reality and everything
else may be blurred, but in Tobias'
and Cho's show, beauty, in the form
of sensuality and silence, is savored
and carries the viewer toward
springtime,

toward loveliness.

Spring is in the air when the lacrosse balls are flying. The spring season is now starting up
for the Garnet, and the pick of the week is the men's lacrosse team vs. Manhattanville
College on Saturday.
After the indefinite postponement of last week's game against Mary Washington, the
Garnet are looking to cut their teeth on the Valiants. Attacker Mark Dingfield 'Ol (No. 2),
midfielder John Murphy 'O3 (No. 13) and midfielder Blake Atkins 'O2 (No. 15) will look to
light up the scoreboard. Keep an eye out for goalie C.J. Riley 'Ol who hopes to step it up
this season and see significant playing time since converting from midfield two years ago.
The Valiants open their second season under head coach Dan Mulholland against the
Garnet. Last season Manhattanville finished with a 6-10 record. Look for the sophomore
powerhouse attack duo of Chad Sommerville (No. 28) and Rob Rochford (No. 8) to
challenge the Garnet defense. The New York products led the team in scoring their rookie
season, notching 40 and 41 points, respectively.

Despite having only five returning players, the
total team roster is up to 21 players, the biggest it
has been in years, thanks to 13 freshmen and three
upperclassmen making their Swarthmore baseball debuts.
The lineup will be spearheaded by bulky back-

stop and co-captain Josh Lindsey 'Ol, who came into
his own late last season. After being snubbed last
year by the All-Conference voters, Lindsey played
in the Delaware County semi-pro baseball league
last summer to further hone his skills and remove
any remaining doubt that he's the best catcher in
the Centennial Conference. The other returning
starter is center fielder and co-captain Scott
Kushner 'O2. The Garnet's leadoff hitter is also looking to solidify himself as one of the conference's

elite.

At least she didn't drown

In fifth grade, my father decided that all the chlorine used
to maintain the swimming pool in our backyard was destroying the ozone. He thought that the pool would be much better off as a koi pond. So he filled it in with gravel and fish,
fashioned some sort of aquatic plant filtration system onto
the diving board, and added some crippled frogs and mentally unstable turtles that he bought at some farmer's market in Chinatown and rescued from a garlicky fate.

were in a different sort of mood, I might even find it admirable but at the time I threw a temper tantrum, my visions of suburbia and backyard birthday pool parties shot
to hell. I don't think I've really swum since. I mean, I visited my roommate in Hawaii last summer and felt obligated to frolic in the ocean a bit, and I do somehow end up
skinny-dipping whenever I drinkmalt liquor, but Meredith
"I am the nicest person alive" Leigh's swimming challenge
actually involved, you know, having my feet break contact
with the ground, which is an entirely different matter.
Someone even suggested, and I seriously considered, getting in the water and then immediately faking drowning a
la Harold in "Harold and Maude" to somehow get out of
this challenge. Later I was warned, though, that this is extremely taboo in swimming circles because lifeguards really don't like getting wet unnecessarily to "rescue" your
heavy ass.

might feel sorry for me and go slower at the end, and then when
she least expects it, I can get a sudden burst of speed and
overcome her. Ha ha. Take that. It's my only chance.
Later that night, I put on the only bathing suit I have that
still fits and prance around in front of the mirror. I take a
bath instead of a shower. I debate shaving, justifying this vanity to myself as a hydrodynamic necessity. I smoke 17 cigarettes and do 50 crunches.
Tuesday, 9 p.m.: I get to the pool and some area swim team
is finishing up their practice. "Oh no," I say. "The pool is already being used." "It's okay. They'll be gone soon," Meredith
replies. I silently curse her. We go sit in the balcony above the
pool and I try to stall. I ask her questions about her best event
(the 400 IM), how long she's been swimming (since she was
seven) and Michael, my loyal photographer, wonders aloud
about the guy in stockings climbing onto a block below us
(it's all about being streamlined). I think in my desperation I
even ask her the same question twice, but she just patiently
smiles and then suggests that we head down to the locker room.

The next immediate hurdle for these Garnet women is
the Pennsylvania State Open this weekend. This tournament is a state tournament and thus is not collegiate. Nevertheless, it should prove a valuable warm-up for nationals, and the team is looking forward to it.

not sure why, maybe some sort of desire to impress her or
something, but I say "Oh, it's not too bad," as I'm getting
in, when I'm actually freaking out because the cold shock
made my nipples get really hard and I'm worried they'll
show up in the pictures.
Meredith swims a lap of breaststroke to show me how
it's done, and she makes it look really effortless, but I
learned from last week not to trust my perception when it
comes to ease of replication. We go over to the edge of the
pool, and I'm gripping the drain, and Meredith has me practice my kick a few times for her. She tells me I have a nice
kick, and I blush, flattered. Up. Out. In. Up, out, in.
Upoutinupoutin.
Meredith gets me a kickboard and I hesitantly make
towards the notorious deep end while she cheers me on.
She talks a bit about minutiae, like touching the wall with
both hands at the end and better head positioning. "It's so
hard," I whine when I accidentally swallow some water.
Meredith assures me thatshe must have "gallons" of swimming pool water in her, and that, really, I'm learning
quickly.
She doesn't expect very much from me, it seems, so when
I manage to actually put all the elements of the stroke together in my own ugly way, she feels like it warrants some
sort of congratulations. I'm trying to kickstart my competitive spirit, but Meredith is so damn nice that I just find
myself grinning like a doofus when she compliments my
progress.

Tuesday 9:40 p.m.: We finally decide to race, just one
25 yards, breaststroke. There's no way I'm going to
be able to make it off the starting blocks, so when Michael
gives us the signal, we both kick off the wall. Immediately
I'm staring at her feet. I try to focus on what Meredith
taught me about the kick and the arm movement, but forget about the breathing for a moment. My mind races, but
hey, stupid girl, it's not that hard to figure out. If you're
out of air, you put your head out of the water. When I do
this, I see that Meredith is about to touch the wall. She is
definitely slowing down, but without a jet ski, there's no
way I'm catching her. Meredith told me earlier about her
best race: she was swimming the mile 66 laps and some
girl had gotten off to a really fast start. Meredith actually
managed to double-negative, that is, she swam the second
lap

half of the race faster than the first half, and she ended up
touching out the girl who had been initially so far ahead of

her.

No such hope for me. Meredith waits for me to finish
my lap, and I give her a hug and thank her for the lesson.
The teenage girls are still showering, so I run out of the
locker room without rinsing off and spend the rest of the
night in a chlorine aura. So I lost, I think. But at least I

Garnet romps over Griffins in first round of tourney
BY MATT RUBIN
Swarthmore moved one step further in
the NCAA Division 111 Women's Basketball
Tournament Wednesday night by beating
the Gwynedd-Mercy Griffins 66-55 in the
Tarble Pavilion.
Swarthmore was led by a balancedfrontcourt attack from starters Heather Kile 'O2,
Sarah Tufano 'O3 and Katie Robinson 'O4,
who scored 21,18 and 14points, respectively.

Kile pulled down 13 rebounds on her way to
a double-double, while Robinson and Tufano
grabbed eight boards each.
Swarthmore's backcourt also played a
significant role, helping to lead a controlled, patient offense that shot an amazing 57.7 percent from the floor in the first
half. Guards Gretchen Heitz 'O4 and
Heather Marandola 'Ol ran the floor with
immense precision, with Marandola contributing seven clutch points and a teamleading five assists.

The start of the first half set the mood for
the rest of the game, as Swarthmore jumped
out to an early 11-0 lead by holding the Griffins
scoreless for over seven minutes. The early
excitement showcased two three-pointers from
Ali Furman 'O3, who reminded the roaring
home-court crowd that her record-setting performance in the conference finals was no fluke.
Swarthmore played Gwyneddpretty much
even after the opening run, sticking to a con-

trolled half-court offense to combat a furious

full-court press from the Griffins defense. Kile
and Tufano made all the right moves, and the
Garnet entered halftime leading 30-20.

The themeof the second half was muchlike
that ofthe first. Swarthmore built itself an early
cushion by holding Gwynedd-Mercy scoreless
for over four minutes and then played a balanced game for the remainder of the half.
Gwynedd did start to make a small dent in
the Tide's lead, however. On the strength of
clutch shooting from guard Mary Anne Wade,
who finished with 25 points, the Griffins

closed the gap to 10 with 2:42 remaining, the
lowest the Swarthmore lead had been since
the half. However, Tufano and Kile answered
right back, dismissing any doubt that this was
Swarthmore's game.
As time began to dwindle, Gwynedd-Mercy
played with futile desperation. Gwynedd
guard Kathy Snell fouled out, and Kile converted a three point play. The crowd began to
chant, "It's all over," and indeed it was.
Nothing the Griffins could do could make
up for the differential in field goal percentage. A swarming Swarthmore defense held the
Griffins to a dismal 32.2 percent from the field,
while the well-controlled Swarthmore attack
netted an incredible 50 percent mark from the
field.

Swarthmore will play Elizabethtown on

Elizabethtown scouts in the stands, and they
were quite impressed with the Swarthmore
women. It's March Madness, baby!

Graduating on top: The Phoenix sits down with Marandola and Shibles
BY ANNA MASILELA
Last weekend, the Swarthmore
women's basketball team won the Centennial Conference championship for the first
time since the conference was formed in
the early 19905. Last year was the first time
that team made it to the CC playoffs, los-

ing to Johns Hopkins in the first round.

The 1984-1985 team set a 14-win record
which the 1999-2000 team tied last year and

the current team crushed this year with
22 wins. Head coach Adrienne Shibles, returning for her fifth year, and senior tricaptain Heather Marandola 'Ol sat down
to talk about this unprecedented season.

The Phoenix: What has been your
strategy this season, considering the
heightened expectations following the success of 1999-2000?
Shibles: We didn't come in looking for
a championship, but we just took it one day
at a time and just tried to take the pressure off. Some basketball coaches feel this
need to be really intense. Last year, I really felt the pressure of having all this talent. I approached this season more relaxed
because I know that extra pressure is not

what we need. The women have an incredible amount of stress and it's really good
for them to come down the fieldhouse with
other women they like and let it all out on
the court. [Women's lacrosse and field
hockey head coach] Karen Borbee has really mentored me this season and has consistently been there as support. I really
have to give her credit for my approach to
this season.
P: The team puts a big stress on defense.
Can you explain the approach?
S: A lot of coaches don't stress that defense is so important. They would rather
do shooting drills but I believe that defense
wins championships. Marandola has been
the heart of our defensive intensity. We put
her on whoever we need to stop that night.
When we played Franklin & Marshall, she
was guarding Amy Krietz, who has been
scoring 18 points per game. [Krietz scored
10 points during the Feb. 21 game.] She is
our most defensive-minded player and has
been a huge leader.
Marandola: Whenever we pick up on
defense and get on our people, it just picks
up our intensity. When we turned on our
defense during the Haverford game, we
picked up 15 fast-break points. Our defense
is something not a lot of teams have seen
or come up against, so that gives us an ad-

vantage. Anytime our defense has been stellar, we've won, whether we were sinking all
our shots or not.
P: What about team chemistry?
S: The team chemistry has been great
the women really get along well. Although we
have lots of talent on the team, I believe that
team chemistry is very important. These
women really click, and it's a huge factor in

how we play.
M: Basketball is a unique sport because
there is this intense atmosphere. You're always five feet away from the next player so
you really have to get along because you're
all so close. We aren't really looking to get
away from each other even when we have offwe like to hang out together and that
days
obviously brings us together and shows on the
court.
There are 11 players out there and I feel
that those who don't start have the hardest
job. I have an idea of when I'm coming out
and when I'm coming back in. But those
people who don't start don't really know if
they'll be in for one minute or five minutes or
20 minutes and they don't really know when:
first quarter, second quarter or fourth quarter. They have the hardest job because they
have to be up the whole time. These are the
people who make a team happen, who pull a

team together.
P: What have been some of the best moments for you this season?
S: The last game [against] Johns Hopkins
was really special, especially with the crowd's
support [lOl4 people attended the game in

Tarble Pavilion]. There hasn't been a sense of
community ever since the football-badminton-

wrestling cuts and for the first timesince that
happened, the administration, the faculty, the
students and the alumni were all taking pride
in the schooland in the achievements of these

women.

M: For me, every day brings something
new, some new memory that I'll hang on to:
people joking around or tripping over those
invisible lines on the court.
P: What do you see looking back at the
years you've spent building the program?
S: Marandola was one of my first recruits
and it's going to be really hard to watch her
graduate. She was has been the hugest help
in building this program. I don't know
whether [Heather] Kile ['o2] would have come
here if she hadn't seen Marandola and Kristen
English ['ol] play, showing her that there were
people who were going to be able to get her
the ball.
M: My freshman year was the beginning
of the building process and we had gotten six

or seven girls. Johns Hopkins was beating us
by forty points and we were losing big to other
teams too. Then my sophomore year, we got
Kile and that was a big jump, and we got Katie
Tarr, Emily Gray and Caitlin Ryland. My jun-

ior year, it was Sarah Tufano and Ali Furman.
And now we've got [first-years] Katie
Robinson, Gretchen Heitz, Jerusha Rodgers
and McKenna Coll. We've had a mental turnaround. My first year, we went out there and
played to have fun. This year, we knew we
could do it so we pushed all the way.
P: What do you see as the strengths of the
team in the upcoming seasons?
M: I know that I can't go hit seven threes
like Furman or get 20 boards and just as many
points each game like Kile, but I'm more than
happy to give Ali the ball seven times and see
her score. Sarah Tufano is one of the prettiest
players I have ever seen. She has some under-the-basket moves that are unbelievable,
stuff that no one in this conference has ever
seen except when theyplay us. Heather Kile
is unstoppable, and Ali is obviously always a
spark. Katie Tarr is one of the steadiest players I have ever seen, and as for Gretchen , I

hope she sticks around because she has a

great head for the game. Same for Jerusha

Rodgers, Caitlin Ryland, McKenna Coll
and Katie Robinson. Emily Gray can stick

a shot whether it's the first quarter or the
third. Basically, everyone has a hidden talent and those talents come out just when
we need them. One-on-one, every girl on
the team can take on anyone in the conference so all we need to do is put it all
together.
P: What about the future?
S: It's challenging for coaches to find

Swarthmore candidates who also happen
to play good basketball. Swarthmore is a
special place and I need to bring in the
right kind of women into the program.
M: This summer, I'm planning to work
at camp with Adrienne and one of our
former assistant coaches but I'm not sure
what's going to happen after that hopefully something with engineering, my

ma-

jor. I'll definitely coach, probably at the
high school level or below because I don't
I
really want to get a masters degree
think I've had enough school for a while.

GOLDEN GIRLS
Garnet wins first-ever Centennial Conference title over
Johns Hopkins, heads to the Big Dance

ASSOCIATED PRESS: In a shocking move early last
week the Board of Managers at Swarthmore College
voted to institute a plan to eliminate all Mexicans from
campus by the year 2005. This comes as quite a shock to
many in the community who are upset that this decision flies in the face of a recent commitment made by
college President Al Bloom three years ago to
"strengthen the Mexican element on campus."
The Anonymous Racists Committee (ARC) was commissioned early last year by the Swarthmore Board of
Managers to evaluate which racial groups on campus
were deemed most expendable. In lieu of presenting the
Board with an actual study, the committee determined
to go with their gut feeling that it was time for the Mexicans to go. Picking up on that strong gut feeling, the majority of the members of the Board accepted the proposal.
In a tense explanatory meeting between the administration and angry students and their parents, Provost
Jennie Keith made an embarrassing slip up when she
said her committee found that Mexicans are "in general
dirty," "tend to be drunks", and often "speak in strange
guttural tones." Later, in the less hostile environment of
a Quaker meeting, Ms. Keith corrected herself by saying, "That's not what I meant. I just meant most people
on campus feel that way about Mexicans, that's all."

"BY ELIMINATING THE
MEXICANS WE CAN MAKE SURE
WE HAVE MORE ROOM FOR THE
MINORITIES WE PREFER, LIKE
ASIAN WOMEN FOR INSTANCE,"
BLOOM SAID.
The official position ofthe ARC and President Bloom
is, that with the Mexicans gone, an effort will be made
to increase the recruitment ofmore pleasant and higher
achieving minorities. "Our faculty simply wanted less
minorities on campus. By eliminating the Mexicans we
can make sure we have more room for the minorities
we prefer, like Asian women for instance," Bloom said.
While Mexican alumni are up in arms, creating websites and email groups, a general apathy seems to have
descendedupon the student body and an element ofhostility towards Mexicans has emerged amongst the faculty.
Philosophy professor Hans Oberdiek, instrumental in the
recommendation to eliminate the Mexicans, says his feelings towards Mexicans aren't personal, it's just that "Mexicans tend to concentrate on subjects outside the humanities, like apple picking and drinking tequila, for instance."
On campus the Mexican leaders organized a poll to
see if students felt that the Board of Managers should
reconsider the decision. The polls came back with strong
support for the Mexicans' cause. It seems, however, that
many students have begun to question the results of the
poll. One student who wished to remain anonymous
responded to the question of why he felt the poll seemed
so misrepresentative. "Well how would you feel if you
were asked to fill out a poll by a bunch of desperate
Mexicans? They're intimidating! Of course I voted the
way they wanted you too! Mexicans carryknives man!"
Unfortunately the tough decision to get rid ofthe Mexicans reflects a problem that many small selective liberal
arts schools are having to dealwiththese days. Only time
will tell if any of the Mexicans will really be missed.
When reached for comment Bob Williams replied,
"The physical plant is ready."

Tri-captains Heather Marandola, Emily Gray Heather Kile pose after beating Johns Hopkins University, 63-53, for the
Centennial Conference Championship. The Garnet hosted Gwynedd-Mercy College last night in the first round of the
NCAA Divison 111 Championships
BY EMILY GRAY AND CAITLIN RYLAND

This past Saturday, to the delight of over 1,000 enthused
fans, the women's basketball team unleashed their fury on
the unsuspecting Blue Jays of Johns Hopkins University for
Centennial Conference Champion bragging rights. The 63-53
win was the first CC title earned by the Garnettes. With the
crown came an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, another milestone for the Swat program.
The Garnet Tideflustered the Johns Hopkins offense with
an impressive demonstration of their renowned defensive
splendor, forcing the Blue Jaysto shoot just 33.3 percent from
the field in the first half. Although the Tide dominated on both
ends of the floor, the margin was only one point at the halftime buzzer. In the locker room at half time, a confident Coach
Shibles reminded her players, "I know you have the physical
game. Now is the time to bring your mental game." On that
note, the Garnet Tide blasted their way through the Blue Jay
defense with poise, confident that the championship trophy
just a few feet away was well within reach.
Plagued by the constant double-teamsfrom the opposition,
after unstoppable Heather Kile 'O2 did her thing offensively,
she introduced a friend. HELLO ALI FURMAN. Ali Furman
'O3 let loose five consecutive three point bombs that elevated
fans from their seats and instilled disbelief in their Hopkins

foes. "You can't stop her!" resonated from the home stands.
Furman was 7-11 from behind the arch, tying a conference
record for three-point shots made in a game. She finished

with 21 points.
Kile led all scorers with a 22-point performance and six
rebounds. Sarah Tufano 'O3 also posted an impressive doubledouble with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Katie Robinson 'O4
stirred up JHU with three steals while leading the Garnet
with 11 big boards.
How will this Cinderella team fair at the ball? Several
factors point to the fact that outsiders have overlooked
Swarthmore's success all season long. Despite ranking in
the top five in the nation for scoring defense and defensive
percent shooting in NCAA statistics, Swarthmore was not
ranked regionally. Also, Swarthmore players have garnered
individualaccolades in both the frontcourt and backcourt.
The starting lineup includes two All-Conference selections
(including the Player of the Year last season), one Conference Career Assist leader, a Conference Steal leader, and a
Conference Three-Pointrecord holder. In combination with
home court advantage
"the grand in the stands factor"
this mix is a recipe for success.

Mercy College, seepage 23.
