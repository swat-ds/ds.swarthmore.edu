$6K projector stolen
from Kohlberg room
Theft could cause tightened security
Justin Kane
Phoenix Staff
By

The theft of an overhead video

and computer projector from

Kohlberg Hall may lead to

tighter security measures for

academic buildings, said Direc-

tor of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave and professor and
Chair of the Modern Languages
and Literature Department Thompson Bradley.
Sometime between 3:30 p.m.
on Nov. 23 and 9:10 a.m. on Nov.
24, a NEC MultiSync MTlO3O+
LCD projector was forcibly removed from a ceiling bracket in
Room 302. The projector is valued at $5700 and is part of an installation that costs approximately $13,000.
The theft, the third of its kind
since May, has forced faculty
and staff to consider limiting
access to rooms and buildings
when classes are not in session.
"We may have to request that
these rooms are always locked,"
Bradley said. "It's a real di[lemma. How do you square the
circle between giving students
access to places to study and
maintaining security?"
Redgrave agreed, saying the
thefts have called into question
how the college protects its assets and created a push for better security.
"We've been investigating
more substantial means of securing equipment, marking or
alarming equipment and limiting
access to certain rooms,"

Redgrave said. "It will probably
end up being some combination
of all three."
This is the second time a projector has been stolen from
Room 302, prompting Bradley
and his department to consider
closing the room to student use.
"This more or less depends on
trust," said Bradley. "We don't
want to make draconian rules
about who can use the room, but
our inclination is to make sure
the equipment isn't stolen."
For the time being, other
rooms with projectors or expensive audio/video equipment remain unlocked, said Redgrave.
Public Safety is unsure if the
room was locked at the time of
the theft, but there were no signs
of forced entry. The crime was
discovered at 9:10 a.m. Nov. 24
by~ Brendan Karch 'O2 when he
entered the unlocked room for
class. Karch told professor Elke
Paxton, whocalled Public Safety.
The projector had been unbolted from the bracket and the
security cable had been cut. The
power cord and other cables had
also been unplugged. The door,
however, had been unlocked earlier that morning for cleaning by
the janitorial staff.
Redgrave said the investigation has yielded few "promising
leads." The investigators dusted
for fingerprints but were unable
to find any, and there were no
witnesses to the crime.
"We're hoping the notice will

A new major in dance and a concentration in cognitive science were
approvedby the Swarthmore faculty
at a meeting on Nov. 5. The dance
major can be pursued by this year's
freshmen and sophomores, while the
concentration is available to all students, assuming the requirements
can be met.
According to Sharon Friedler, Professor and Director of Dance, until
now dance has been available to students only as a second major, Honors major, or Honors minor. Students
pursuing the newly-formed major
are advised to enter it with one and
one-half credits in dance. They will
have to fulfill a requirement of nine
to eleven additional credits: two each

ertory.
In their senior year, majors must
do a one-credit project or write a one
or two-credit thesis.
Students in the cognitive science
concentration must take Introduction to Cognitive Science and two
courses in threeof the following disciplines: computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy or
psychology. They must also have a
substantial background in another
discipline related to cognitive science, such as a linguistics background for English majors, or work
in computer science for math/statistics or engineering majors.
The concentration will culminate
in a one-credit senior thesis that may

Pulitzer winner Browne
speaks about career
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
Pulitzer Prize winner, highly
regarded war correspondent and
science reporter Malcolm
Browne '52 of The New York
Times returned to his alma
mater to speak about his career
in journalism on Nov. 23. His
visit was initiated by visiting associate professor of journalism
Ben Yagoda.
Browne openly admitted that
48 years ago, when he was a student at Swarthmore College, he
had no intention of becoming a
writer. Browne did not write for
The Phoenix, he told his audience, which included a large
number of current Phoenix staff
members.
"I never imagined myself as a
journalist at all until I stumbled
into the profession," he said. This
stumbling followed a stint at a
chemistry lab, where he created
what he called "a new and more
indestructable crust for frozen
blintzes."
The advent of theKorean War
initiated a career shift after
Browne joined the army and was
assigned to write for Pacific
Stars and Stripes instead of driving tanks.
"Of course it was all lies, but
the idea was to entertain the
troops," Browne said of this
early experience in journalism.
Yet despite the dishonesty of the
military newspaper, Browne returned from the war determined to pursue this new career
path. He attributes his success
to the negligence of the New
York City subway system, as he
had to learn how to type after
catching his fingers in a manhole cover.
"The main advantage of journalism," he told the aspiring reporters in the audience, "is that
it's fun. Most of all, you get varieties of experience."
Browne's long career has been
full of these varieties of experience, including being deported
from Cuba for photographing
Castro supporters with their
arms raised in what could have
been interpreted as a Communist salute, riding helicopters
into war zones in Vietnam and
interviewing soldiers in the Gulf
War.
"The varieties of experience
are not all pleasant," he said.
"The perpetual injustice of war
really makes you shrivel." After
the Gulf War, he shifted his focus to science journalism, and
now writes for the science section at The New York Times.
An accomplished story-teller,
Browne managed to express
strong opinions about a wide
range of topics in the course of
relating this history. Comput-

ers, he proclaimed, can get you
into bad habits; Castro's
speeches were interminable;
the New York Times is still the
greatest newspaper in the
world, and no institution "has
given its student body a richer
of
palate
goodies than
Swarthmore College."
He concluded his talk with advice to those who hope to join
him in the journalism profession.
"Journalists are not qualified to
do anything except journalism
and garbage collection," he said,
a state ofaffairs that angers him.
"Do the homework," he exhorted.
"Blend in like a chameleon."
"Be fair, but not necessarily
objective. This fanaticism with
objectivity is all right-wing, by

As a final note, he admitted
that mistakes in stories are a
part of journalism and asked for
sympathy for "the poor little
messenger." After all, he said,
"journalism is the first draft of

-rialistic policies."
Mara Fortes 'O3 had similar reasons for attending the protest. "As a Mexican, I have experienced the negative impact of the U.S. foreign policy," she said. "I went to Georgia because I believe that the U.S. should change its
attitude towards other nations. To this day this
country's foreign policy is primarily imperialistic, camouflaged, of course, under the euphemism of global cooperation."
The School of the Americas was originally
founded in 1946 and, after several renamings and
relocations, it was established in Fort Benning,
Georgia. It is an official U.S. Army Training and
Doctrine Command School, funded by the American budget. It trains Latin American soldiers in
subjects like military intelligence and anti-narcotic and commando operations. The Commandant of the SOA, Col. Glenn R. Weidner, claims
that the school is vital for U.S. security because
it seeks to enhance the cooperation between the
US and theLatin American countries in preventing drug trafficking.
There are protests against the SOA because
many Latin American dictators have been
graduates of the school. The School of the
Americas Watch, established in 1990, organizes
a protest at Fort Benning every year, demanding that the SOA be closed down. Swarthmore
students joined this year's ninth annual protest
on November 21st. More than 12,000people attended the protest, compared to 7,000 last year.
All Swarthmore vans were in Georgia by 4:00
p.m. on Saturday and students attended the initial gathering of the protestors in front of the
entrance to the campus of the SOA. Swarthmore
students listened to the different speakers and
found some old friends among the other protestors gathered at Fort Benning.
Every year many protestors risk arrest and
undertake the act ofcivil disobedience by crossing the property line of the SOA. On Saturday

Mara Fortes 'O3
tended a workshop that explained what could
be the consequences of crossing the property
line of the SOA.
The real protest took place on Sunday, in front
of the campus of the SOA. Swarthmore students
had prepared bannersand posters and they took
them to the protest at around 10:00 a.m.
Present at the vigil were actor Martin Sheen
and Catholic priest Daniel Berrigan, who is a
long-termcommunity activist. At noon, they led
the "funeral procession" of the 4,408 civil
disobedients. They carried coffins or white
crosses with the names of the numerous Latin
American people who have fallenvictim to military violence. As the names of the victims were
called out, the crowd answered "Presente" to
show that the victims were not forgotten. It took
an hour for the entire procession, which included 20 Swarthmore students, to cross the
line. Last year only 9 students crossed the line.
Gabriel Hetland 'O2, who participated in the
civil disobedience act both years, said that he
feels that "as an US citizen I have the responsibility to make my voice heard that I am against
the U.S. policies preventing people in Latin
America from living their lives freely. That is
what the SOA is doing."
The protest continued after the procession
had entered the SOA campus. Two of the
Swarthmore vans left at 2:00 p.m. and two
stayed to wait for the students who decided to
cross the line. All students were back at school
on Monday morning for their classes.
Asked if Solidaridad plans to continue attending this protest, trip organizer Ben Schweigert
'O2 said that "we [Swarthmore students] will
continue to go until the SOA is closed."

Architect offers DuPont renovation plans

By Nick Goodness

To meet the needs of a diverse student body, Swarthmore's ad-

may be looking for someone to represent those
ministration voices.
multiculturalsearch could soon begin for a new dean ofmulticultural

A national

just completed tentative administrative approval,
affairs. Having
the search would garner a multicultural dean who will take on the

responsibilities of building upon a diverse student body, according
to Dean of the College Bob Gross.

The new dean would focus on building an infrastructure through

which the voices of minority students could be formally heard by

faculty and administration. Currently, organizations housed in the
Center andBlack Cultural Center have been structurally independent from one another, but the new dean would join
these support groups through leadership.

Intercultural

Elizabeth Lindsey 'O2, co-coordinator of the Diversity Coalition,
said there would be increased concern for multicultural issues af-

ter the dean arrives. "[I hope that] the dean will work with faculty
to more effectively address issues of diversity in the classroom and

will assist in promoting a more diverse faculty body," she said.
Previous searches for a multicultural dean have dissolved due to

issues of funding and conflicting interests. However, these issues
have been resolved for this search. Although Haverford and other
schools have already installed multicultural deans, Gross argued
that Swarthmore is in an entirely differentposition, noting that many
other schools which have recently hired multicultural deans were
lacking the strong support groups that are found at Swarthmore.
"Our minority causes and the administration within the causes are
very strong, but what we have lacked was someone to take on a
leadership position for the entire entity," he said.
The issue of having a multicultural dean was reintroduced last
year during a student meeting with Gross. Advocates said the need
for a multicultural dean has become clearer with last year's vandalism of the Intercultural Center, but Gross said that the incident was
just one reason in a long list of why the position was justified.

Redgrave said the investigators are focusing on possible culprits within the college, but that they have yet to
rule out an outsider.

Redgrave.

Regardless of whether the

Redgrave said he foresees
changes in the way security
is handled.
"Students are typically allowed to stay in buildings
when we lock them if they
aren't making trouble, and we
generally try to follow the
wishes of whoever is using the

Bradley also said he sees
changes looming in the future.

access to it are wonderful
things to be able to have, so
this is a real loss," Bradley
said. "It's amazing how much

SC clarifies meaning of 'abstain'
Members also hope work on parking issue will continue
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
After abstentions overwhelmed votes for all three candidates in an election for College
Judiciary Committee positions
two weeks ago, Student Council
had decided to change the wording of its ballot to eliminate confusion.
At its meeting Tuesday night,
Student Council voted to add a
"no preference" option and a description of the meaning of a
vote to abstain. The ballot will
now explain that a vote for abstain is a vote for "none of the
above" that nullifies all other
votes cast in that election. In
elections where two or more positions are open, the ballot will
say, "vote for up to two."
The changes will take effect
for next week's elections. Student Council is, however, considering more permanent amendments to its constitution, including eliminating the abstain option from the ballot. The council
will present those suggestions to
students at a forum at 8 p.m.
Monday in Parrish Parlours.
"The basic problem, I think, is
people don't understand what
abstain means," said Secretary
Jordan Brackett 'Ol, who suggested rewording the ballot.
"And the reason people don't understand what abstain means is
we've defined it incorrectly."
The changes were precipated
by 390 abstentions that paralyzed the election for the two
CJC positions, which were on the
same ballot as the runofffor the
Sharpies 111 proposals. Pat
Hagan 'O2 had received a plurality of 282 votes while Adrienne
Fowler 'O3 received 139 and
Robyn Harshaw 'O3, 113. However, the Student Council constitution requires that a winning
candidate receive more votes
than the number of abstentions
in that race, so the two CJC positions remain open.
Members of the council noted
Tuesday that, in the two-position

to pass on the ideas and progress

"The basic problem, I
think, is people don't
understand what abstain
means. And the reason
people don't understand
what abstain means is
we've defined it
incorrectly."
Jordan Brackett
race, many students voted for
one candidate and "abstain,"

which effectively voided their

votes. Outreach Chair Rodney

Morris 'Ol suggested adding the
explanation that a vote for abstain would nullify other votes
cast in the election. Brackett
then proposed that the ballot allow students to vote "for up to
two" candidates, suggesting that
voters who prefer only one candidate not check "abstain" as
well.
Co-chair Matt Schwartz 'Ol
suggested that the council replace "abstain" with "none of the
above," but the council's constitution requires that the word
"abstain" appear on the ballot.
The council also discussed, but
rejected, an alternate proposal
from Brackett that would have
added the explanation "none of
the above" to the abstain option
on the ballot but directed voters
to vote for either a candidate,
abstain, or neither, without the
"no preference" option.
Curriculum Committeerepresentative Mike Spiegel 'O3 said
the prospect of losing to abstain
was shrinking the field of potential candidates for positions on
the council. "I think abstain's
really scaring away some people
from running," he said.
In other business, as the semester wound down the council
discussed a plan from Morris
that would suggest a timetable
on the issue of student parking
for future members of the council to follow. He said he wanted

the council made on the issue
this semester. "I think there are
a certain set of core issues
that pretty
parking, wages
much we address every semester, every year," he said.
Schwartz said that the document should note that while the
council believes increasing the
availability of student parking is
important, it has misgivings
about adding asphalt to green
space on campus. He also said
that future members of the council would be under no obligation
to follow the proposal.
Fellow co-chair Jared Solomon
'Ol said that the council had
made progress with the parking
issue, especially after Vice
President for Facilities and Services Larry Schall agreed to add
pavement to and reline the
DuPont lot to add spaces there.
"I think we've been pretty successful with parking," Solomon
said. "We said we would get students more spots and we did."
But Morris noted that not all
of the additional 30 spaces will
go to students. Some will be for
faculty or staff use.
The council also discussed
whether its Parking Committee
should administer parking spots
available in the Ville, charging
all students with parking permits an equal fee to cover the
costs of those spaces. Currently,
students parking in the Ville
must pay while the college's own
student parking spaces are free.
The council approved a fourpoint motion from Solomon to
deal with the issue of parking.
He suggested that the Parking
Committee must allocate spaces
in the spring for the following
academic year and that it administer the Ville spots. In addition,
he proposed that Student Council continue to investigate the
issue of obtaining more student
parking spaces and give the
council's Facilities and Space
Coordinator the mandate to work
with the Parking Committee on
the issue.

MP3s: a matter of caution
Cruise Swarthmore's Macintosh and PC local area networks and you'll
discover them. Accessible to anyone with a network password, they are
stored in easy-to-find folders like "music" or "MP3." With a few clicks, they
can be played immediately or downloaded to another computer. They are
MP3 files, bootleg copies of copyrighted music, illegally available for quick,
easy and free distribution.
Students use simple software to convert tracks on their compact discs
into MP3 files, a process that is not illegal. But it is illegal to copy and share
them -*■ something so simple and natural to do with computer files that
most students think nothing of it.
Because copying MP3s is technically illegal, the college is taking steps to
protect itself from the consequences of students' actions, just as its alcohol
policy absolves it of responsibility for underage drinking. Likewise, students should be more careful about the flagrant violations that can get them
caught. Making the illegal files freely available over the network through
anonymous file sharing, as opposed to protecting them behind passwords
that would allow friends to access thembut prevent the copyright violation
from being as detectable, is a poor judgment call. Students could also
simply leave the files on their own hard drive, without turning on file
sharing at all.
The Recording Industry Association of America, acting out of obvious
self-interest, is urging colleges and universities to crack down on distribution of MP3s over their networks. This is understandable, because higher
education campuses, with lots of technology-savvy students and free highspeed network bandwidth, make it easy for the files to propagate. Of
course, such a network also makes it easy to do library research, share
documents easily with professors, or transfer The Phoenix to our printer.
But while the RIAA has forced other schools to try to squelch the network
trafficking and could do so here, preventing students or anyone else from
making and sharing MP3s completely is impossible because the technology
is too widely available. Further, the software that makes MP3s is not at all
illegal, nor is the MP3 format itself. In fact, there are many studios and
artists
especially independent ones
who actually encourage free
distribution of their music in MP3 format. Consumer electronics manufacturers have finally started making portable MP3 players, at prices and
quality comparable with portable CD players.
One school has installed monitoring software to detect and stop the
copyright violations that occur over its network. But that is an option we
find unacceptable in the higher education environment of trust. Does that
school also prevent its students from photocopying journal articles in the
library? Does it install software on its network to detect plagiarism in
students' papers?
The answer is probably no, because in those cases there is no corporate
interest with overpaid lawyers. It is the recording industry that stands to
lose the most from the MP3 format, which would unclamp its control over
distribution of music. Artists —especially independent ones
would
benefit from greater exposure and concomitant interest in expensive
concert tickets. Consumers get the flexibility of computer software that
allows them to play their favorite songs on demandand share those songs
with others. But the industry is the loser, because the profits it makes, at
the expense of the artists and consumers, are about to evaporate unless it
cracks down on the illegal MP3 trade.
So the RIAA is shifting its weight around to try to prevent an enormously
popular medium from enjoying the use it deserves. The move will not work
and is ultimately hypocritical because for years there has been a way to
obtain free music that the recording industry has in fact supported. It's
called the radio.
The radio was a good invention. Someday, it will be apparent that the MP3
format was a much better invention. Until that day arrives, we think it is
prudent to exercise caution in your use of MP3s. But we see no reason to
limit the enjoyment of music or hinder technological progress to serve the
interests of corporate fat cats who wouldrather you listened to the less
user-friendly radio.

To the Editor:
The editorial by David Ellis and Jared
Eisenstat in the last Phoenix (Nov. 19, Opinions, pg. 8) regarding activism on the Swarthmore campus was a flawed and uninformed
portrayal of the movement to close the School
of the Americas and of campus activism in
general. It is not the activists who stand in
the wayof "a search for truth" as they so selfrighteously assert, but rather, the mentality
of "smiling and walking past" that Mr. Ellis
and Mr. Eisenstat advocate. Their demand for
"intellectualism" is a thinly-veiled defense of
complacency.
If they had stopped to talk to us instead of
"smiling and walking past," they wouldhave
seen that we were not asking people to sign a
petition on the spot, but rather were signing
up people for our e-mail list so that we could
send out information on books and articles
to read, upcoming teach-ins, and breaking
legislative information.
If they had read the newspaper instead of
"smiling and walking past," they would never
suggest, as they do in their editorial, that closing the School of the Americas could result
"in a chaotic, widespread, hopelessly violent
civil war whereby thousands ofinnocents are
brutally murdered," because that civil war
is taking place in Colombia right now, with
report after report blaming the military
(trained at the School of the Americas) for
the majority of the atrocities.
If they had gotten off campus more instead
of "smiling and walking past," they likewise
would not suggest that closing the School of
the Americas could unleash a drug plague in
America, because that drug plague is going
on right now, with the School of the Americas itself implicated by a former instructor,
Maj. Joseph Blair, who asserts, "It was common knowledge
that the School of the
Americas was the best place a Latin Ameri...

TO THE EDITOR

CHARLES FtSCHETTE

Daily Gazette lacks sensitivity, professionalism
To the Editor:
Two weeks ago, 12 young people died
in a tragic bonfire collapse at Texas A&M
University. The day after the accident,
the Daily Gazette reported on it in the
world news section. After reporting the
factual information, the article concluded, "Well, that was a stupid tradition."
The article then went on to the next news
item.
I have family and friends who have
gone to Texas A&M, and I know other
readers of The Daily Gazetteknow people
there as well. Some readers may have
known one of those injured or killed in
the accident. What made the Gazette feel
it had the right to mock the deaths of these
students? Was the writer trying to be
funny? The Gazette editorial board did
not respond to my letter expressing my
offense at this statement.
By publishing such a tasteless comment
in the first place, and further by failing
to apologize to its readers for its poor
judgment, the editorial board of the Gazette has sent a message to the community of readers that includes students,
administrators, parents, and individuals
outside ofSwarthmore College. The message is that the Swarthmore community
finds such ignorant statements, and such
irresponsible journalism, to be acceptable. I do not believe that most members
of the Swarthmore community would

It is one thing to have a campus
institution that is merely
tolerated for its mediocrity. It is
quite another to overlook
something that simply offends,
especially when it is a student
publication that effectively
represents the Swarthmore
community to the rest of the
world.
agree with that.
This is not the first time the current
members of the Gazette editorial board
have shown the inability to exercise good
judgment. Last spring, The Daily Gazette
ran a news brief with the headline, "Lotsa
death, with a little sex thrown in." The
article included details about the dragging death of a black man in Jasper, Texas;
an allegation of sexual assault; and a plane
crash in China that killed 61 people. After receiving complaints, the Gazette issued an apology for publishing such an
inappropriate headline.
Since its promising beginning my freshman year, the Gazette has continually declined in quality and usefulness to its read-

ers each year. It originated with the goal
of providing more timely and in-depth reporting to the Swarthmore community,
particularly on campus events. However,
those goals were soon lost, and the Gazette
now only rarely covers campus stories.
Most students admit they read it only for
the weather and campus events. In addition, the level of journalistic merit in the
stories it does have is low. Campus news
articles are often highly subjective and
poorly researched, and factual information is often inaccurately reported.
It is one thing to have a campus institution that is merely toleratedfor its mediocrity. It is quite another to overlook
something that simply offends, especially
when it is a student publication that effectively represents the Swarthmore
community to the rest of the world. The
commentary provided all too often in the
Gazette's news reporting is not only bad
journalism, it is tasteless and out of line
with the values of this community.
The members of the Gazette's editorial
boardhave shownpoor judgmenttoo many
times, and the consequences are great
enough to warrant a serious review of the
value of this publication. The current editors should apologize to the community for
this most recent offense, and carefully
reconsider their mission and responsibilities as editors of this publication.

Opinion writers wrong about School of Americas
To the Editor:
I am writing in response to the editorial written by David Ellis and Jared
Eisenstat (Nov. 19, Opinions, pg. 8) aimed
at discrediting the activities of
Solidaridad regarding the School of the
Americas. As a participant in the protest
in Georgia that drew 12,000 people from
many different ideologies and intellectual
pursuits, I found this piece harsh, biased,
and ignorant.
My main contention comes with the
examples given regarding the effects of
closing the school. The authors bring up

Colombia, saying that without the school,

Colombia could be thrown into a "hopelessly violent civil war whereby thousands of innocents are brutally murdered." Perhaps they are unaware that
this is already taking place with the aid
of SOA graduates.
They then remark on the possibility of
problems in limiting domestic drug supply without SOA graduates regulating. I
don'tknow where they have been for the
past few decades, but I am not sure anything could make our drug policy worse
than it already is. To give them a little

Foreign debt is no simple issue,
should be forgiven by U.S.
To the Editor:
In the last issue of The Phoenix, Dave
Thomas, in his article "Foreign Debt is
Taxpayer Money," (Nov. 19,Opinions, pg.
9) used a fairly common-sensical argument that debt relief is essentially giving away money that belongs to the
American taxpayer. What I would like to
stress about the entire issue of debt relief is that it is one of the most complex
issues that can be encountered in political economy, and often cannot be boiled
down into simple, straightforward analy-

sis.

One point sticks out in particular. The
process of foreign loans in the last halfcentury is an issue of investment under
uncertainty, and should certainly be
treated as such. When looking at the issue in this way, we see that both creditor
and debtor need to take responsibility for
an adverse state-of-the-world outcome,
just like in any investment. However,
when the debt started becoming unsustainable in the 1980s, international creditors refused to acknowledge their part of
the risk. In the mid-19705, certain events,
the oil-stimulated stagflation chiefamong
them, led to the failure of many develop*ng countries to be able to repay debts. Is
Ghana really responsible for lack of revenue due to a decrease in the international, monopsonistic price of cocoa? Are
countries who lend heavily to Ghana on
the expectation of repayment based on
cocoa exports really without responsibility? Many of these countries were expect*ng colonialism-like extractive windfalls
from their loans in the third world. This
just did not happen, as therisks ofinvestment under uncertainty sometimes lead

Moving on to simply bad neo-liberal
economics, US-dominated international

financial institutions, like the IMF, World
Bank, and the newer World Trade Organization, have NOT facilitated a condition
where repayment was possible. It's been
a vicious circle: countries borrow from
theBretton-Woods Institutions, the BWIs
institute neo-liberal conditionality that
does not stimulate development, the debt
increases and these countries go into debt
service with the same conditionalities.
While this is complex, the main point is
that whiz kids at the Bank and the Fund
often had no idea what they were doing.
On the same note, many of the loans that
the US gave out were linked to the Cold
War and the fight against communism in
the third world. These loans were nothing to do with development and as such,
did not lead to a condition of easy repay-

credit and assume the SOA does help drug
control, there is still no logical basis for
supporting an institution withknown military dictators as graduates just because
it may curtail the drug trade by a small
fraction.
What we were protesting and trying
to inform the student body about is an
American-funded institution that is
known to teach torture and whose graduates have killed leaders of grassroots organizations calling for equality in their
countries. Many Catholic representatives attended the protest to show their
disgust at the brutal slaying of Jesuit
priest Oscar Romero in El Salvador by
graduates of the SOA. By tabling,
Solidaridad was simply trying to inform
the student body, not brainwash. If the
writers of this editorial have such little
faith in the intelligence of the students
here, perhaps they should table outside
Sharpies calling for apathy and ignorance, which they obviously support.

What I am
thankful for
this season
First off, blues fans, the man's name is
Pope John Paul 11, not Jean-Paul (if you
haven't seen the übiquitous advertisements for the WSRN blues program,
please ignore this reference). I don't understand the sudden switch into the
frenchified version of John, but it's a little
weird. I don't know what kind of latent
anti-papism is being covertly expressed,
but it's certainly not in the spirit of tolerance, so cut it out. If I'm not allowed to
have any unpopular opinions, then you're
not either.
But on to less controversial things.
Last week was Thanksgiving, where we
celebrate the incredible lack of foresight of the Indians (or lack of reciproctake your pick) in
ity of the Pilgrims
giving food to the first Americans so
that they could survive the winter and
eventually establish reservations in
sundry isolated places in the American
West. And so I thought that, although belatedly, I would offer a few things for
which I am thankful this year, and you
are welcome to add your own silently

ask me
later).

First, I am thankful for the lack of

serious chalkings at all, this semester.
I'm sure that nothing is more fun as a
tour guide than trying to explain the
level of intellectual sophistication at
Swarthmore to a bunch of students and
their starry-eyed parents, and then running across what can only be termed a
graphic depiction of sexual congress:
"Yes, so does Swarthmore allow double
maj . . Oh, my God, what is that? Do
people really bend that way?" On second thought, is it too late to be a tour
guide? I've never been inside Mertz or
Lang, but I am very familiar with the
reserve desk.
I am also thankful for Abraham Lincoln, who, although responsible for the
generally-abysmal state of ticket sales at
Ford's Theater, is also responsible (I hope)
for the institution of Thanksgiving, during which I am able to be in a car and not
have to listen to National Public Radio.
You know, they really do talk aboutmushrooms. I always thought it was an exaggeration. I guess there's a little truth in
everything.
Finally, I am thankful for the fact
that this column has metamorphosed
from a piece of political commentary
to something generally devoid of rational thought, full of extremely prolix
language and read more than ever before

despite our academic facade, sometimes we just want to (attempt to be)

Video games
glorify violence
Without a doubt, most video games glorify violence. Yes, there are a large number of games that have absolutely no violent content, but the average strategy, action-adventure, or simulation game has a
generous dose of murder and mayhem.
Recently, many have questioned whether
video game violence is responsible for a
decline in sensitivity to violence, and possibly to increased juvenile crime. While
people can tell the difference between
video games and real life, the glorification
of violence in games does lead to more dayto-day violence.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell
whether video games are the instigators
of violent acts, or merely byproducts of a
society that promotes violence. Of course,
video games do not exist outside of society. Programmers have the same set of
morals as the rest of us, and use their morals to determine what should and what
should not be included in video games.
However, video games seem to lead
popular culture in terms of acceptable violent content. Over time, game producers
have realized that sensational games sell
best, and as people acclimate to a certain
level of gaming, they demand more sensational material. Nobody suggests that
video game players are innately more
bloodthirsty than others, but the media of
video gamesallows players to foster their
violent tendencies. The only question is
whether these violent propensities would
be more productively diverted in the absence of video games, or whether another
(and possibly more destructive) alternative would pop up.
Although video games may not convince
players to commit violent acts, they become acclimated to the sight of violence
through repeated exposure to violent images. As a result, players do not give the
same consideration to the 50th death they
see on screen as they did to the first.
However, while players may not have a
problem killing dozens of people in video
games, they recognize the difference between video game violence and violence
in real life. Games may glorify violence,
they may create aggressive behavior, but
at no point do players confuse the line between the game and real life. Just because
people play violent video games does not
necessarily mean they will act violently
during the rest of their life.
If thevideo game glorifies violence, however, the game essentially promotes it. In
most games, both the hero and the villain
use violence to accomplish their goals,
though the hero's goals are noble while the
villain's are evil.Nonviolent characters are
seen as feeble, and are eithertaken advantage of or protected by people willing to
fight for their goals. The obvious message
conveyed is that violence is the method by
which people accomplish great actions.
Nonviolent people are sheep who are constantly pushed around by people with
strength and willpower. No, people are not
going to go on shooting sprees after playing Doom, but they will associate the violence in Doom with self-assertion and
power. Some games, without a doubt, and
possibly most games, glorify violence and
propose violent solutions to problems.
So is the answer to ban all violent video
games? That certainly is one solution, albeit an uncreative and ineffectual one.
Violence in video games is not the problem; people do not imitate violence for its
own sake, they do it because violence is
portrayed as the best way to solve problems. Instead, create games with contextual violence that have negative consequences for violent behavior and alternatives to fighting. Video games can be an
excellent form of aggressive escapism as
long as the games do not convey the message that violence is the best means to
solve problems.

Canceling minority weekend ignores history
By Min Lee
Phoenix Staff
About a month ago the Admissions Office, in response to student complaints,
decided to abolish minority pre-frosh
weekend, a special program for prospective minority students that takes place
before the regular pre-frosh weekend.
The decision, surprisingly, did not cause
an uproar. Phoenix coverage was spotty
at best; the minority support groups,
while somewhat indignant at first, felt
reassured upon learning that a minority
component would still be incorporated
into the regular pre-frosh program.
But all is not well. While reconfiguring
the presentation of minority pre-frosh
weekend may appear to most as a trivial
move, both symbolically and substantively, it marks the beginning of a very
dangerous trend. To understand what this
trend isand what its potential impact may
be, one must start with the story of immigration and race relations in the U.S.
It is a more straightforward story than
one would imagine
one dominant pattern cuts across historical periods, repeating itself again and again. When the
dominant group is faced with the onslaught of a culturally different newcomer, it becomes defensiveand reactionary, and its mission becomes the maintenance of that position of domination, even
at the cost of the complete subjugation
of the newcomer. The preservation of
power is the foremost goal.
Granted, immigration is not just about
living next to a person of a different skin
color and someone who speaks an alien
language. Jobs are lost; traditions are corroded. But the response is hardly proportional.
One of the darker facets of human nature emerges when we perceive our authority and our way of life as being challenged the instinctive response is primal, one of obsessive, ruthless self-protection, often pre-emptive in nature.
And thus were born slavery, scientific
racism, exclusion acts, quotas, the Bell
Curve argument
all instances of extreme defensive mechanisms.
The extremity of the reaction means
that the dominant group will exhaust its
ingenuity in trying to maintain its edge

On the Swarthmore front,
canceling minority pre-frosh
sends the message that the
journey is over when it is far
from it.
—every thinkable tool and strategy is employed. They vary in degrees of explicitness, and often, the least tangible are the
most insidious. These strategies include
exercising the leverage of dominance to
decree standards that are to the advantage of the dominant, but otherwise are
rather arbitrary. Who said standard
American English is goodEnglish, but not
Ebonics? It is not an objective fact, but
rather a judgment effectively drilled into
our consciousness over the years to the
point where we simply accept it as fact.
With every passing day, the validity of our
meritocracy comes increasingly under
fire. A recent economic study revealed
that an Ivy League education is not the
key to success. We have a presidential
front-runner who scored a 1200 on the
SATs. One of the greatest leaders of our
time, MartinLuther King, Jr., bombed his
GREs.
The state ofAmerican society is a function of this larger pattern that has the uncanny tendency to revive itself year after year
a hierarchical society structured to a large extent along racial lines,
and most importantly, a structure that is
rigid and self-perpetuating. A child born
to poverty is destined to a life of poverty.
It was not that long ago that a child born
black was doomed to a life of indignity.
But obviously we have come a long way,
thanks to a liberalresurgence in the 1960s
which was continued recently. The Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and affirmative action
are just a few of the many initiatives that
have successfully changed the structure
of this country in a positive way. It is telling of the times that in the 1992presidential election a poor Arkansas boy who
clawed his way into the elite through public scholarships defeated the Andoverand Yale-educated son of a former senator.

The journey, however, is not complete.
But the tremendous progress that we

SWARTHMORE
have made often eclipses this fact. The
beneficiaries of progress tend to forget
or simply ignore the history of America
as I have described above (read: Ward
Connerly). This is especially dangerous
because those who are prone to forget are
oftenthose who are most equipped to continue the journey.
Finishing the journey of transformation is not just the right thing to do, it is
absolutely crucial for two reasons. First,
it signifies the triumph of better angels
of human nature. Diversity is cool not
just because diversity is interesting and
homogeneity boring. The presence of
diversity is important because it implies
the acceptance of diversity
the fact
that we can not feel usurped or unsettled
by the presence of elements alien to us,
and respond to the challenges they pose
with ingenuity, not violence. Second, diversity that shatters racial and class
boundaries represents a new equality in
a pure meritocracy, the end of structural
power inequalities. It means that those
who define the meritocracy are also
those who live under it, and most importantly, that the meritocracy is truly a
meritocracy of full consensus, not an imposed, strategic meritocracy used to
keep one group or another at bay.
On the Swarthmore front, canceling
minority pre-frosh sends the message
that the journey is over when in reality
it is far from it. Targeting minorities in
a visible way is not just a PR gimmick—they are targeted out of a recognition
that their elevation in society is essential to achieving a completely just society. The decision is even more questionable because it was meant to pacify minority students who were displeased
with their separation from non-minority
pre-frosh, a move they believe unnecessarily highlights their differences. But
they are different even if they themselves do not feel different and their
peers do not perceive them as such
because of the structural inequalities
that persist in our society. Swarthmore,
out of all schools, an institution that
prides itself in its commitment to "social justice," should not be the first one
to agree with them.

GUEST COLUMN

WTO protestors should accept free trade
By Ananda Gupta
The Diamondback (U. Maryland)
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK, Md.
Seattle looks like a scene from the 19605.
I wasn't there
in the 19605, I mean
but as they say, if you were there you
wouldn't remember them. Anyway, the
World Trade Organization is holding a
week-long "ministerial conference"
(whatever that means) in the Rainy City
and the graybeard wackos ofyore are out
in force along with their soul children.
In principle the protesters object to
free trade. But there's something more
to it; something uglier, if not more stupid. International economist Paul
Krugman suggested that "the WTO has
become to leftist mythology what the
United Nations is to the militia movement:
The center of a global conspiracy against
all that is good and decent."
The "theory" of free trade is like the
theory of evolution it might not justify
total, ironclad faith, but the body of
knowledge and evidence behind it practically guarantee that every fundamental objection has already been answered,
and no one seriously questions the basics.
Only the specific details are at issue. We
know as well as we know most anything
that humans and present-day apes
evolved from an ape-like common ancestor, and we know that free trade maximizes the wealth of nations, to the benefit of even the poorest.
Think of it this way: No one on this campus is self-sufficient. We all purchase
goods and services from a variety of
stores, restaurants and other businesses.
And that's a good thing! Imagine how hard
it would be to learn anything or pursue
your dreams if you had to be totally selfsufficient. You'd have to grow and prepare all your own food from seeds you

stumbled upon in your backyard. Never
mind learning anything.
This world of self-sufficiency is the
ideal world for anti-globalist forces. The
only difference is that they approach the
issue in terms of nations, not individuals,
even though the logic is just the same.
This strange and hellish world pops up in
their rhetoric, whether it be in environmental groups' desire to extinguish commerce and plunge entire cultures into
darkness for the sake of trees, or in rightwing groups' desire to wage "culture
wars" by keeping out anything and everything that's not red, white and blue.
The standard of living in countries that
accept the West's offerof capital and jobs
has universally improved. As Krugman
writes, "The benefits of export-led economic growth to the mass of people in the
newly industrializing economies are not
a matter of conjecture no matter how
base the motives of those involved, the
result has been to move hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty to
something still awful but nonetheless significantly better."
At its base, the anti-WTO view is about
denial of choice, with a healthy dose of
xenophobia. Can't sleep at night because
some Indonesians choose to work in conditions you couldn't bear for a day, just
so their kids can eat? Ban it. Think foreign cars mean selling out to Japan? Tax
'em.
In the end, opposition to globalization
is about remaining in the past, about preserving a world and a culture wherein
there are rich people and poor people and
the self-righteousness of the former
trumps the well-being of the latter. We
need NEA subsidies because the average
American can't tell kitsch from haute
culture, and we need television censorship because Ally Mcßeal is eroding our

In the end, opposition to
globalization is about remaining
in the past. The anti-WTO view
is about denial of choice, with a
healthy dose of xenophobia.
traditional values. Or is she unduly reinforcing them with all those hallucinatory
dancing babies? Who knows.
No doubt many of the WTO's oh-so-enlightened critics really do care about poor
people in faraway lands. But they live in
a fairyland, wherein the Suhartos and
Husseins of the world suddenly repent
their sins and give away all of their illgotten gains, passing all sorts of wonderful social programs and taxing themselves dry.
The economics of sweatshops are
simple if you live in a very poor country, and Nike comes along and offers your
kids a chance to eat, you take it. That, not
"socially conscious" chin-pulling, is why
the rate of malnutrition among Indonesian children has dropped by 20 percent
since the 70s. And without Nike they'd
be starving still.
As the protests in Seattle turn violent,
and the mobs start donning masks, the
provincial spirit of anti-globalism in turn
shows its face. Their chant, "Whose
streets? Our streets!" reveals their uniwe've got our riches, our
fying view
cars and televisions and the high-wage
jobs to pay for them, and the hell with
Bangladesh. Our fastidiousness about
where our shoes come from should not
lead us to block their way or insult the
nations who have already benefited from
the spread of global capital by calling our
obstructionism "progress."

The pine forests and rolling hills of

southwestern Georgia contain a massive

U.S. Army infantry base, Fort Benning,
just outside the town of Columbus on the
Alabama border. Fort Benning, in turn,
contains the U.S. Army School of the
Americas (SOA), a fifty-year-oldmilitary
training school for Latin American military professionals, originally situated in
Panama but relocated some years back.
Many among the activist community,
especially among the Catholic left, have
come together and called for the closure
of the School because of well-documented
human rights abuses by some of the leading SOA graduates. These include the
genocide and civilian terror campaigns
in Guatemala during the 1980s, designed
by Gen. Hector Gramajo, a '67 graduate
and guest speaker at the SOA in 1991.
Gramajo was found guilty of war crimes
by a U.S. court some weeks after speaking at the SOA. There are accounts of
many other such abuses, documented in
U.N. Truth Commission hearings and Congressional memos. They telltales of mass
murder, rape, torture and terror committed by military men of Latin America
trained by the SOA. Many of these stories can be found at the SOA Watch Web

School of Americas is Cold War

site, www.soaw.org.
Why is there a School of the Americas?
Why does the U.S. military need to train
soldiers from Latin America? Arguments
about helping in the drug war seem not
to hold under the massive complexity of
that issue. I'm no Latin Americanist, but
it seems to me that since militaries all
around the Third World, Pakistan's among
them, actually traffic those drugs, the
SOA can't be the be-all and end-all of
America's war on drugs. No, the School
of the Americas seems to be there to only
to teach "democracy."
Small problem here. The U.S. military
is, on balance, a wonderful military: it is
completely subordinate to the needs of
the American people and the government
that represents them. However, the set
of institutions required for a non-political, subordinateand ascetic military just
simply do not exist elsewhere in the
world. The militaries we are talking about
in Guatemala, El Salvador, Indonesia,
Nigeria, Pakistan and many more countries work under a different logic. It is
a logic of power, a logic of extraction, of
personal gain by repression and force.
The nature of these militaries concern
Mercedes Benz, opulent parades and
other gestures of power, fortresses of
warlords, the flogging of dissenters in the
-

-

streets.

These people cannot be taught democracy. Democracy cannot be taught; it
must be created indigenously and along

its own path, without "help" from foreign
military training.
Back when the fight against the Red
menace was alive and well, the U.S. felt
perfectly justified in training not just
Latin American soldiers, but also Indonesians who would go out and massacre
Timorese; South Africans who would repress the blacks and pummel the ANC;
Israeli special forces who would torture
and maim in the Occupied Territories; and
Pakistanis who would perpetuate the misogynistic Islamic fundamentalism of the
Zia ul Haq regime. Did the fight justify
the outcomes back then? I would say
probably not, but then again, I wasn't
there.
Now, however, as the smouldering embers of the ColdWar are doused, we should
be looking for a different paradigm, one
apart from "anything in the name of myopic national security." The U.S. needs to
realize that the weapons they used to fight
that war cannot be just modified; they need
to be thrown away in the name of a higher
order. The U.S. Army's School of the
Americas is a Cold War relic institution
whose graduates are responsible for the
deaths ofmillions. Other schools like it all
over America produce similar results for
all regions. Communism is gone. There is
no longer any reason why the U.S. can't
stop trying to control the world and start
helping to beat the bloodstainedswords of
the last generation into the plough-shears
of tomorrow.

International freshmen review Swat to date
By Feng He
For The Phoenix
The past three months have been an
exciting and challenging experience for
the 380 freshmen at Swarthmore, and
even more so for the 40 or so international
students, manyof whom have never been
to the States before. While the American
students were adjusting to the academic
aspect of college life and trying to make
new friends, the international students all
of a sudden found themselves in a foreign
land and an alien culture.
It is fair to say that, on average, the international students are slightly more
open-minded and willing to experiment.
(After all, how many of you ever thought
of going to college in another country,
apart from the study abroad programs?)
And "cultural differences," I feel, is a
term much over-used.
My country China is probably as
different from the U.S. as you could get,
both geographically and culturally; yet,
at least at the beginning, what struck me
most were not the differences but the
similarities between these two countries.
This gave me some hope: if we are not so
different, maybe one day the two countries really can become friends and trust
each other.
Most of the first-year international students shared my view, but there were
exceptions. One, who did not wish to reveal her name, said that she was really
bothered by the fact that Americans don't
feel a need to apologize. In her country,
she said, "you apologize if you do something that inconveniences someone else."
Here, she found that Americans, girls
especially, sometimes tried to explain
their way out of a situation so as not to
have to apologize. This had been the biggest obstacle for her to maintain close
relationships with some students here.
However, she was quick to add that Swarthmore students have a whole variety of
beliefs and values, and that she was not
attempting to make any generalization.
This woman notwithstanding, most of
the international students I have talked
to find American students to be friendly
polite. Many had not noticed a considerable cultural barrier. That should not
he surprising; some of us have spent several years in the States before coming to
Swarthmore.
Even among those who had
n ever been to the U.S. before, most speak
a least decent English and had learned
about the culture through the language.
Profound differences, however, took
tone to surface. As the students gradusettled down and found their niche,

J-

the international students started to feel
the aspects of American culture that had
escaped unnoticed at first glance. Many
told me that, despite the apparent friendliness among the Americans, they did not
seem to take genuine interests in other
peoples' lives. Slowly we realized that,
when people ask, "How ya doing?", they
do not really expect you to answer. And
when they say, "That's great!", they do
not mean as much as their expressions
and tones suggest.
Compared to other cultures, Americans
are individualistic. The times when I felt
most strongly that I was in the U.S. were
at parties: loud music, flashing lights,
people twisting their bodies. That is very
different from my idea of a meaningful
social life. As Ani Silwal, an international
student from Nepal, pointed out, "Others
[are] more important in some cultures
than in America." There were even occasions when I wondered if Americans feel
lonely sometimes. But if anything, Swarthmore would probably be better than
most other places. Youssef Soliman, an
Egyptian student, really appreciated
Swarthmore after a trip to George Washington University, where "nobody knew
and talked to anybody."
Some students were bothered by how
little some Americans know about other
cultures and countries. Anteneh Tesfaye,
from Ethiopia, was asked questions like
"Do you carry guns to scare off the lions?", "Do you have cars?" and "Do you
have tap water?"
On the other hand, the international students sometimes felt excluded when the
conversation moved on to things that
were quintessentially "American," most
likely a TV show or sports. Queer issues
are also disturbing to some international
students. Swarthmore has a liberalreputation even among American colleges.

But many of the international students
came from places where one cannot talk
openly about homosexuality. It is understandable that they are not entirely comfortable to find queer issues addressed
so openly at Swarthmore. But whatreally
disturbs me is that, although some international students were not comfortable
with the way such issues have been addressed, they asked me not to reveal their
names when expressing their opinions,
fearing that they would be pressured because of it. I feel that one should not be
stopped from expressing their feelings
and doubts, if only so that we could help
thembetter.
Even among the upper classes, international students seem to hang out with
each other a lot more than with Americans. One possible reason is that we got
to know each other during the international student orientation, which began
three days before the all-students orientation. Some suggested that maybe the
foreign students could more easily make
friends with American students without
the international orientation. But
Tesfaye points out that although international students have a working knowledge of American culture (you can't escape American pop culture anywhere
you live), the knowledge doesn't really
go the other way. For him, a conversation with an international student is more
of a mutually enriching experience than
a conversation with an American student.
We, the international students of class
of 'O3, have found it necessary to make
some adjustments to our social life and
thinking, and we are well on our way to
implementing them. It is really a privilege to come to Swarthmore for a wonderful education as well as a different
cultural experience.

If not an inn,
then the next
best thing
Bland and tight-lipped was President Al
Blooms' response three weeks ago when
questioned about the possibility of an inn
on campus: "I think accommodations of
high quality for guests would be a real
benefit for both the College and the town.
But before a decision can be made, we
need to explore the programmatic and
financial implications of placing an inn
on the recommended site, the extent to
which a developer would assume the overall costs, and the longer-term likely financial viability of the project. We are in the
midst of that analysis."
President Bloom was referring to the
Swarthmore Town Center Revitalization
Strategy Task Force's proposal to build a
65-room inn that would lie at the edge of
the south end of campus on what is now
the softball field.
While I would be delighted to have an
inn on campus—l have even used this
column as a diatribe expressing my
frustration about the lack of an inn—it
seems that this is an impossibility. The
College or the town would have to lure
a developer into Swarthmore to build
this inn; to do this, it would have to make
this business proposition seem highly
profitable or guarantee a level of eco- j
nomic stability by agreeing to subsidize
the inn.
It is not likely that the inn would be
profitable; the Task Force released a report which indicated that based on what
demand the College could generate for
the inn, for 80 percent of the year the inn
would be filled to less than half its capacity—a grim prospect.
There are other sources of demand, but
with 19 hotels within 30 minutes of Swarthmore providing a total of 4003 rooms,
it seems illogical to believe that the Swarthmore inn could be filled to capacity
very often. Though Swarthmore College
could entirely fill the inn 56 nights of the
year, that hardly makes for an economically viable establishment.
In order to guarantee the developer that
building an inn in Swarthmore would not
be a financial disaster, the College would
need to subsidize the inn, an action that
would undoubtedly be condemned by the
faculty and a proposition that would indubitably strike a note of terror with the
Board of Managers. Some would object
to subsidization on the grounds that it is
wrong, in principle, for an academic institution to be financing a profit-making
venture, and others would point to the
practical ramifications. If the College had
to guarantee to fill ten rooms per night,
every night, at $l5O dollars each, that's
well over half a million dollars a year.
The opinions that faculty and staff have
voiced range from fatigued indifference
at best to adamant and vociferous opposition at worst; coupled with the gloomy
financial implication subsidization, the
inn seems like a pipe dream. The College,
it seems, is now simply killing time and
waiting for an opportune moment to pull
the plug on the inn project.
Given that the prospects of a campus
inn are looking dimmer by the day, I
would urge the College to support a bed
and breakfast ordinance at Borough
Council meetings. Such an ordinance,
which wouldallow for bed and breakfasts
in what is otherwise a residential zone,
would create both more accommodations
for guests of the College but would also
contribute to the economy of the town. It
is absurd that the closest lodgings are the
shabby Media Inn and the airport hotels,
six miles away. If we cannot have an inn,
let us at least have the next best thing.

Wonderwall

Hicks Mural Room
If there were one
Swarthmore work of art on campus, it would
be the Hicks mural. For anyone who has seen it,
the choice is obvious. The piece, an epic of sorts
by Swarthmore standards, graces the expansive walls
of the Hicks Mural Room on the third Floor of Hicks Hall.
The themes are familiar. One theme envisions the engineer as the proletariat intel-

lectual, literally, marching side-by-side with the hard-working men and women of the
industrial class. In one scene, two impeccably dressed, compass- and book-clutching

engineers stand alongside two jeans-clad workers carrying the tools of their trade.
Another panel features a white hand and a brown hand clasped together tightly in a
display of racial solidarity.
The mural also tackles the role of technology in society. It questions the relentless
pursuit of scientific research for political or other improper goals. One scene juxtaposes a research lab and an illustration of a women searching in a pile of rubble for
potatoes.
Taken as a whole, the painting represents a distinctly Swarthmorean view of the
world. One of the engineering professors featured in the painting is even supposedly
modeled on an actual Swarthmore engineering professor.
But for a painting that is so reflective of Swarthmore's ideological and historical
roots, surprisingly little is known. This week, The Phoenix's Sonia Scherr uncovers the
story behind the Hicks Mural. She also talks to several students and faculty members
about their reactions to this native Swarthmore masterpiece. As Scherr's reporting
reveals, the history of the painting mirrors the turbulent history of modern America-

at-large.

NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN | Phoenix Staff

Egleson wrote in 1938 that his newly-completed work would "trace on the minds of people looking at [it] views
as divergent as the antipodal opinions that men everywhere arrive at regarding the same reality." But Egleson
also believed that the mural's merit lay precisely in its ability to evoke such responses from those who saw it. In
his own words, "the degree to which it may cause people to ponder the realities of our times may lie the measure
ofits contribution to thereal educationaland cultural mission of the College." The following three responses to the
Hicks mural, from two Swarthmore students and a professor, suggest that Egleson's creation continues to force
people to think deeply—just as the artist had hoped nearly sixty years ago.
Kwabena Adu 'Ol, an engineering major, first saw the Hicks Mural when he stepped into his introductory engineering class fall semester of freshmanyear. He summed up his initialreaction to the mural in one word: "Whoa."
Adu recalls being disgusted by what he calls the "communist" aspects of the mural. "When I first came to
Swarthmore I was quite conservative," Adu says. "I [regarded] the mural as communist propaganda."
But in his two and a half years at Swarthmore, Adu's political leanings have shifted—and with them his attitude
toward the mural. "I became more liberal," Adu concedes. He still doesn't agree with the mural's depiction of
"communist ideals." But he says he is now "more open-minded" and has gained "a lot of respect for the mural."
"I see the mural differently [than when I came to the College]," he says, "which shows how my views have
progressed for the better."
Despite this change, the mural has always raised more questions than answers for Adu. During the weeks
following his first impression of the mural, Adu says he tried to "find out its secrets" during class. He remembers
thinking that the image of a brown hand and a white hand clasped in brotherhood "didn't make sense," sinceblacks
form a large majority in Adu's native Ghana.
Adu admits that the mural still draws his attention during his frequent classes in Hicks. He wonders why the
moods of the panels change so dramatically, from the bustling portrayal of men entering a factory on the south
wall, to the "desolation" of war and the giant swastika on the rear wall, to the "happy" group of workers near the
windows, and then to the images of unity and peace on the north wall.
The absence of women in the mural also continues to puzzle Adu. Pointing to the panel entitled Science and
Poverty, in which an old woman searches for food in a pile of discarded bones and weapons, Adu observes that
women are present only in the "most troubling" scenes. "It would be great if the mural [depicted] more women,"
he says.
Overall, however, Adu has a profound appreciation for the mural's artist and his creation. "Whoever did [the
mural] put a lot of passion into it," Adu asserts. "They wanted to say something, and they did so brilliantly and
well."
"The muralreminds you that while you're studying something like ideal beam bending, there's a whole world
out there," says Hannah Rakoff 'Ol, also an engineering major. "It gives you a sense of respect for the real world
[outside of] classes."
Like Adu, Rakoff finds the mural "interesting to ponder during class," though she confesses that Hicks 312
seems "hardly right for a grand mural." The images of a bomb plunging into an open book and of a gas mask lying
on the ground are particularly disturbing in their depiction of twentieth century political themes, states Rakoff.
And yet, Rakoff observes, the mural in its entirety is more impressive than any individual scene. She is awed by
the wide thematic scope of the mural—including its portrayal of such major issues as science and technology,
communism, hunger, war, and Nazism—as wellas by the ways in which it combines these themes both within and
across panels. "The mural is so big, [yet] the scenes seem to melt into each other," says Rakoff.
The artistry of the mural contributes to the impact of its subject matter, asserts Rakoff. "The mural is amazing
artistically. The painter has a great ability to paint muscle and clothing... There's so much detailand strength of
color."
The mural's juxtaposition of opposites also creates a dark and powerful effect, according to Rakoff. For example, "[ln the Science and Poverty panel] you see horrible things surrounding a room where people pursue
genteel activities."
"Overall, the mural seems very negative," concludes Rakoff. "I think there's some sort of hope in the mural,"
she adds, pointing to the image of a handclasp between people of different races, "but it's well-camouflaged."
Nevertheless, Rakoff sees a lesson in the mural's depiction of evil, for "it reminds us... that people need to learn
about horror to avoid repeating it."
"I'm glad the mural is there because it... stimulates discussion of issues that at some places are never considered because they're beyond the scope of the undergraduate program," says Professor Frederick Orthlieb, who
has taught in the Engineering Department for nearly 25 years. "The mural forces you to consider the sociopolitical context of technology."
Orthlieb finds the mural particularly "intriguing" as a result of the year he spent working at the National Science Foundation's Office of Energy Research and Development before coming to Swarthmore. This experience
gave him insight into the exploitive relationship between politics and technology portrayed in the mural. "The
political process views technology as a means to an end. And that end is often political," says Orthlieb. "This point
is brought home strongly in the mural."
One scene that is particularly blatant in its criticism of government's abuse of technology shows a group of
scientists working in a defense lab while a woman searches for potatoes in a pile of rubble.
This scene points to the mural's overarching theme of technology's potential for both good and evil, says Orthlieb.
"Technology is a tool that can be used for good purposes or ill. The mural shows both sides of the coin."
Orthlieb believes that the darker themes of the mural may have resonated more strongly in the pre-World War
II atmosphere in which it was painted. While emphasizing that "the engineering program [at Swarthmore] currently subscribes to humane uses of technology," he is not sure if this was true in the years following World War I.
Although Orthlieb is quick to point out that the mural "must be understood in the context of its time," he acknowledges that it also speaks to more recent conflicts, including the Vietnam War, Kosovo, and the genocides in
Africa.
In addition, people's individualresponses to the mural are profoundly affected by their backgrounds, according
to Orthlieb. "People who have had military experience may bring a different view to the mural," says Orthlieb.
"Experiences during one's formative years influence how one looks at the mural. The [increasing diversity] of
students at Swarthmore brings more points of view to the mural and to its significance."
While Orthlieb has seen works that depict similar social realist themes, he says that this mural has an "uncommon strength" and "a sharp edge."
"It's powerful stuff if you let it be," says Orthlieb.

Xiao Chang 'O3
College Judiciary Committee
Hello. My name is Xiao Chang, a member of the class of 2003.1 would be honored to serve fellow students on the College Judiciary Committee, where I will
strive to uphold the integrity of our school
by making careful evaluations of cases.
For those to whom I can speak only in
this forum, I hope to convince you of my
passion and motivation. Each at our
school of individuals is entrusted to pursue his or her own endeavor along our
community's standard of honor. Though
it is difficult to stand in judgement of
one's peers, I hope and wish to join the
CJC in its mission to affirm and validate
our common value in truth and fairness.
I can also be counted on to do a good
job, especially inbeing fair and unbiased.
Involved in our Peaslee Debate Society, I
have learned to analyze an argument
from different angles. Equally important,
I have learned to make objective decisions in judging debate rounds even at
times when I disagree with a basic viewpoint. Similar backgrounds inhigh school
have also prepared me to be a responsible
member of the CJC. I appreciate this opportunity. With your vote, I hope you will
bring me a step closer to my goal of serving the college.
Patrick Hagan 'O2
College Judiciary Committee
Hello, my name is Patrick! I'm running
for a position on the College Judiciary
Committee, which convenes in a circumstance in which, for instance, you may be
in danger of being expelled from
Swarthmore (but only if you were caught
doing something bad). To be honest, I
have trouble imagining anybody I've met
here guilty of anything that terrible, but
I suppose that is the whole point. I don't
indulge in any idyllic dreams about this
place; I'm positive that Swarthmore is one
of the most uniquely friendly and understanding places on the planet. I grew up
in Ridley (right next door to Swarthmore)
and have chilled here since I was a wee
lad, before the whole skateboarding thing
made even my non-threatening ambulatory visits occasionally uncomfortable.
I've met, during my walks, throngs and
herds of Swarthmore students past and
present, and I've loved each one of them
because they've all been super nice to me.
I could not help but to form a deep attachment to this place and the love I feel surging through it.
As a result, I hold the community of
students, staff and local children here in
the highest esteem and take the protecion of our environment more seriously
than my 8:30 class, which is nonetheless
dear to my heart. I promise, that, if
elected, I will continue to love
Swarthmore as much as I do now and
channel those feelings of love towards a
serious preservation of an open-minded,
academically responsible and safe environment in which to grow, learn, and
skateboard.

Neil C. Cavanaugh 'O3
Outreach Chair
As the Outreach Chair, my goal is to
streamline an inefficient student council while encouraging more of the student
body to take an active role in student
council decisions. By publicizing current
SC issues, I hope to allow the voice of the
student body to be heard. In addition to
increasing interaction between the SC
and the student body, I will improve the
aesthetic pleasantness of the SC board
while helping to fairly and efficiently
distribute board space in Parrish Hall.

Tony Hillery'ol
Charter Committee Chair
Students here at Swarthmore need to
have an active voice in as much campus
activity as possible. The decisions made
concerning our student body should not
be determined by a few elected officers
without the consultation of as many students as possible. If elected Charter Committee Chair, I will make student voices
heard equally and forcefully. Also, as the
Student Council liaison to the Budget

Committee, I will see that our money is
being spent in a way that benefits the
greatest number of studejits to create an
enjoyable campus atmosphere.
Caitlin Engelhard 'O3
College Planning Committee

Hi! I am Caitlin, and I am running for
for the position of College Planning
Commitee Representative. This means
that I want to be the person who looks
over the shoulders of those distant faculty and administrators to see what they
are really up to. At this point, I dont have
any specific aspirations or goals as a
member of student council, but I believe
that it is important to have student input
on any committee that looks at "longrange planning" and college policy. I am
organized and outspoken about what I
think, and as a freshman, I still have my
idealism intact and a fair amount of free
time.
Brandon Silverman 'O2
College Planning Committee

My name is Brandon Silverman, and I
was the CPC representative on Student
Council this semester. Unfortunately, it
was only a one-semester position (the previous CPC rep. resigned), but doing it for
a semester made me sure of one thing: I
want to do it again. I know exactly what
the College Planning Committee has been
discussing, what they are going to discuss, and the details of the issue on the
table. I am also familiarwith SC, and have
a whole lot of things I want to do before I
leave Swarthmore...not promises, but
things I would like to see changed and
would try to get changed:
1. A 24-hour computer lab. SCCS lost
the referendum, but now the administration understands that we could use some
kind of computer lab that is open 24 hours.
It is something that can happen and would
make a real difference if it did.
2. Continue to let the administration
know that we have an inadequate amount
of student space, and we would appreciate seeing some improvements before we
all end up financing the changes with our
alumni donations twenty years from now.
3. Card access to dorms and buildings.
CBC is going to look at the issue, but it
would help if it was encouraged as much
as possible by Student Council. We have
all had to wait outside Danawell, Willets,
or even Parrish at some point because the
door was locked, sometimes even if you
had a key (i.e. the darn lock in Willets).
4. A wider variety of food at Tarble and
the bookstore, i.e. items you can take back
to your room...loaves of bread, peanut
butter, jelly, gallons of milk, cereal and
so on. Some of this stuff is going to show
up during Finals, but the more the better.
5. Two-ply toilet paper in all the dorms.
Cornell has it, Rice just got it, and there
is no reason we shouldn't. Its the small
things that make our lives just a little bit
better.
Among other things this semester, I've
learned how important it is to balance
idealistic, long-term goals with more
practical everyday issues that affect the
quality of students lives. I'll make sure
that balance exists if I am elected.

has fallen apart. It is almost a joke to consider ourselves a "community" at all. We
have to change
Bringing the
Swarthmore community closer together
starts with refurbishing the existing allstudent spaces and make the best possible
use of all extra availible as places where
Swarthmore students can go to unload
after a long paper or an ass-whooping
exam. We should move our game room to
a more prominent location, where it can
be more easily be taken advantage of. If
that isn't a possible option then we should
at least renovate the game room so that
is a place thatis more comfortable to hang
out and unwind in, after all isnt that what
games are all about, unwinding? I would
like to see that all of the public lounges in
the dorms have televisions that can at
least get SOME reception, i think that we
are deffinatly deserving of having a tele-

vision that we can actually get more than
2 channels on. But most importantly my
job as facility& space coordinator would
be to carry out what you, my fellow students want. I will do anything I can to
make Swarthmore College a tight-knit
community where ALL students can
assocciate together. In a college with only
1300 students we should be able to walk
around and hang out in public areas and
know all of our fellow classmates not only
the little cliques that many of us like to
be around. I would like to make our college lives as worthwhile and unforgettable as possible and I know you all would
like the same thing. It all will start with
better useage of our existing facilities and
creationof more for use by the entire student population at Swarthmore.

Jennifer Pao 'Ol
Appointments Chair
Hello, my name is Jennifer Pao, class
of 2001, and I would like to be your Appointments Chair. As a Student Council
member, I want to ensure that the students have a voice in all the colleges affairs. In order to accomplish this, I want
to develop a more efficient procedure of
applying for and awarding committee
positions that guarantees equal opportunity for all students who desire to serve
on committees.
I believe the first step to achieving this
goal is strong communication between
the appointment chair and the student
body will enable a solid committee procedure. Strong communication can be
built through advertising and meetings.
All available positions will be greatly publicized to ensure that everyone has all the
informationavailableand has an equal opportunity to run for committees. I will
employ the media of posters, flyers, emails, and whatever else, to get the information out to all members of the student
body, I also plan to update the Student
Council Appointments web page, making
to present all committee information so
that it is easily accessible and easy to
understand. The web page will be up-to
date with instructions on how to apply for
committees, what committees are open,
and with detailed explanations about each
committee.
I would also like to establish meetings
between the appointments chair and the
committee appointees. Every so often,
perhaps once a month, I would like to
meet with at least one member from each
appointed committee. This would allow
student council to stay informed of any
concerns any committee might have, as
well as ensuring that students have a
voice in non-elected positions.
As for SC in general, I believe there are
several important changes that need to
be addressed. First, based on some of
problems SC has been having this semester, it is possible something is wrong with
the structure of the council. If elected, I
will look into possible changes to the restructuring SC so as to ensure that members are more responsive to students,
perhaps by making them responsible to
smaller constituencies. This way, representatives would be more approachable,
and more concerned with your specific
concerns.
With an efficient committee procedure
that allows equal opportunity will guarantee a diverse set of students on the committees that will allow every member of
the student body to be heard.

Dave Choe 'Ol
Treasurer
There is a succinct and a wordy way to
state a platform. I don't know what you

or my competitors prefer, but I like the
former:
1. As Treasurer and SC member, I will
champion student council's involvement
in expanding and increasing funding for
the Career Planning & Placement Office.
Specifically, the demand on the office to
help seniors get jobs and admitted to
graduate schools, while assisting underclasspersons procure internships, is too
much to expect from the under-staffed
office. The college needs to alleviate the
pressure—of reviewing resumes, cover
letters, and essays, organizing information sessions, interviews, workshops, and

the like—by increasing the number of
staff who can work with the students. I
ultimately want to see an increase in the
college's visibility with company employers, non-profit organizations, graduate
schools, and to whereverelse Swatties endeavor.
2. I will help realize twenty-four hour
public access to computing and to ensure
that it accommodates all students who
wish to utilize the service.
3.1 will continue to push for a student
center. But seeing that it will probably
takes years before it actually gets built, I
think that in the interim, the college ought
to improve the student lounges and generally the social life in the dorms. This
goal might involve increasing the number of televisions in the dorms and offering cable service. If not cable, then we at
least should purchase high-powered antennas that get better reception of the local stations. Improvements might also
include supplying more microwaves to
the dorms—for example, one for each hall
in Willets. These are only two ideas for
making dorm social lives more pleasurable, and I'm sure you all probably have
many more. I want to be the one on student council responsible for representing.
them.
4. On a more idealistic note, I strongly
believe that the student council has the
obligation to be proactive in informing the
students of its proposals, even if the college appears to be indifferent to student
council decisions. Being proactive is simply one of the criteria of serving on student council, and it should not be dismissed and neglected on the grounds that
"the students just don't care." No doubt,
such a goal would be extremely difficult
to implement. But my sense is that on too
many occasions recent student councils
have taken the easy way out by just giving up trying. In reaction, a result has
been an increasingly apathetic student
body, and the pinball machine incident is
indicative of this widening divergence between student council and student relations.
The first move to bringing the two
groups together is the responsibility of
student council, and it ought to be persistent in its attempt. This means regularly
posting proposals on the student council
bulletin board, making efficient use of email to inform the college of its decisions,
making members accessible, or quite
simply, talking to students to see what
they think. Devising efficient ways to realize this goal and to be persistent in the
face of student apathy will not be easy,
but serving on student council was never
meant to be.
As for the specific role of Treasurer, I
will help ensure that student council is
fiscally responsible, but more importantly, that the student body is aware in
particular of proposals to make material
expenditures. Should student council
want to make purchases—and it ought to
be proactive in such attempts —I want to
ensure that the student body is aware of
the proposals andable to offer feedback.
Jobs, computers, student lounges, and
a listening ear; these are what I offer.
Hope to get your vote.

'X-Files' more
about creativity
than storyline
Somebody somewhere once wrote that
the old-style $2O bills portrayed America
as a big green country full of politicians
and weirdos. That's "The X-Files" nation,
the bizarro America of alien abductions,
serial killers, Bigfoot, circus freaks, blues
guitar, Watergate, wiretaps, militia
groups, cultists, black helicopters, alligators down sewers, informants in parking
garages, and secret chatter on CB radio.
Driving home over Thanksgiving break,
I was passed on the highway by a big
black eighteen-wheeler with a neon cross
burning bright on its front grill and "Jesus
is God" written on the cab
and that's
the sort of weird American moment that
"The X-Files" sells every Sunday,
reimagining that scary-ass trucker as a
born-again Christian braineater munching cerebellum in truckstop bathrooms,
or a horseman of the apocalypse, or a
mutant who bears an eerie resemblance
to Jon Voight but is in fact not Jon Voight
and just some mutant lookalike.
I figure "The X-Files" is the most overwritten-about show of the decade and the
cliches of paranoia and platonic love are
pretty firmly in place. Every columnist
goes on about the spectre of sexual tension between Spooky Mulder and Scientific Scully, boiling down the whole thing
to a "Will they? Won't they?" scenario,
acting as if it was the first time opposites
ever attracted. What? These people have
never seen "Cheers"? Or "Moonlighting"?
Or "Anything but Love" with Jamie Lee
Curtis and RichardLewis? Baby, it's television: that's what opposites do, they attract. And as for the show's "Lee Harvey
Oswald didn't act alone" version of history and "The Truth Is Out There" conspiracy theories? Its paranoia is like a
movie trailer, whose sole function is to
whet your appetite and keep you coming
back for more, week after week; it's serial rather than subversive. Whoa! Scully
has an alien-engineered brain tumor! The
Cigarette Smoking Man is really Mulder's
father! The same shadowy syndicate is
responsible for the assassinations of JFK,
Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X,
Jimmy Hoffa, John Denver, and the failure of the Buffalo Bills in numerous
Superbowl attempts! Sign me up! Where
can I find out more?
In my opinion, the so-called mythology
episodes, in which Mulder's search for
truth is furthered in half-steps and frustrating ellipses, demonstrate the expansiveness of show creator Chris Carter's
imagination but his poverty as a writer.
This season has been especially bad, replete with numerous Mulder-as-messiah
references and a UFO that holds the
meaning of life, apparently common
enough in alien circles for them to just
write it on the side of the ship (just like
"Honk if you're horny" bumper stickers
people here on Earth have). I watch the
show most every week and enjoy it more
often than not. But I don't want to give it
too much credit. What you realize after a
while is that Carter doesn't make shows
about anything except his memories of
other shows not a crime if he didn'talways seem to be on the verge of some
great statement, didn't aspire toward
some secret metaphysics, some "truth."
I like the funny, self-parodying episodes, which feature the most inventive
narrative structures and highlight the
smirking irony that David Duchovny cultivated over a long career in soft porn,
and the monster stand-alones, which really deliver the goods. Satanic cults,
incestous freaks, worm men, evil fungus
that's the good stuff. I don't care what
the "truth" is or where it is. I want the
weird out there.

Industry cracks down on illegal MP3s
By Brendan Karch
Phoenix Staff

t^tube

*

If a random bust like
Margaritaville was able to
Swarthmore's
puncture
bubble, then a group of economically motivated corporations are sure to stamp on our
parade. And if they have their
way, Swarthmore students
could soon be busted for a
crime much more serious than
underage drinking: copyright
infringement.
That Swatties are guilty is
undoubtable. Illegal MP3s,
movies and computer programs have become an expected privilege for most students, who capitalize on the
high-speed campus network to
transfer large files quickly.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is
making colleges and universities ground zero for the fight
against MP3s, and it is probably only a matter of time before the illegal MP3 trade is
shut down.
But just as students' guilt is
clear-cut, the implications of
the MP3 technology remain
complex and uncertain. On the
national level, digital music
proponents are up in arms
over MP3s and the RIAA's attempts to squash digital music, legal or illegal. And at
Swarthmore, a committee is
busily drafting new policies to
inform students and limit the
college's own liability.

More than just an MP3

In just a few years, MP3s
haverevolutionized music. Because MP3 technology delivers near-CD quality sound, but
only takes up about one-tenth
of the file space, it has been
embraced by computer users
around the world. And with the
recent introduction of portable MP3 players, the technology is no longer limited to
computers.
Listeners have not been the
only ones to benefit. New
bands have encoded MP3s and
released them freely using
nothing more than amateur
digital sound equipment. The
recording industry's economic
stranglehold on modern-day
music making is loosening.
Technology enthusiasts and
music lovers are proclaiming
an audio renaissance. A whole
Internet culture has emerged
to examine, discuss, and worship MP3s.
At Swarthmore, the effects
of the digital music revolution
have been equally profound.
And illegal. Hundreds of students on campus make music
available illegally to their PC

or Macintosh brethren and
many more encode their own
MP3s. Thousands of songs
covering all genres are available free of charge.

Cracking down

It is an inescapable fact that

most MP3s at Swarthmore are
illegal copies. Every student

who makes MP3s available on
the campus network is breaking the law.
But not all MP3s are illegal.
It is legal to make a personal
MP3 copy of a copyrighted
song and it is legal to distribute MP3s if the band allows it.
But practically every popular
band has strict copyright laws
that prohibit the resale or redistribution of their creative
material.
The recording industry
claims to have lost billions of
dollars from illegal MP3s. In
an effort to combat the pirated
music, they are intimidating
colleges into cracking down on
MP3s. So far, the threats have
worked.
In August, the University of
Oregon called the FBI after
they noticed a large amount of
traffic from 22-year-old Jeffrey Levy's computer. He was
arrested, and was recently
sentencedto two years' probation for pirating music, video,
and software, and for marijuana possession. He escaped
a possible $250,000 fine.
Then, on Nov. 8, Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh randomly searched 250
computers and took away the
Internet access of everyone
who made MP3s available to
the public 71 students in all.
Less than a week later, the
University of South Carolina
at Spartanburg installed network-monitoring software
that limits activity to and from
any one computer. The move
came after the RIAA contacted the university about an
MP3 pirate.
-

Staking out legal ground
Admittedly, there have only
been three notable incidents to
date. But as the RIAA continues to crack down and the colleges and students have little
defense, there is seemingly
little that can be done. If the
trend continues, the illegal
MP3 culture will inevitably
collapse.
Meanwhile, others are walking a tightrope trying to save
a wonderful technology that
has gotten a bad rap. With the
RIAA attacking not only illegal MP3s but also the infrastructure that promotes legal
MP3s, digital music proponents are fighting an uphill

Roadmark to highlight student playwrights
By Suzanne Wu
Phoenix Staff
Roadmark's Night of Original Scenes
will take place this Friday and Saturday
at 8 p.m.
Roadmark, a group that sponsors student written and directed one-act plays,
will present the three works in Paces. The
one-acts are
written by Jessica
Nakamura 'O3, Elizabeth Nolte 'O3 and
Andrew Bryce 'OO. Bryce is also the coordinator ofRoadmark. However, he said
that he considershimself "among equals"
in the performance.
Roadmark was got its start in the fall
of 1996 as a forum for writers to share
their material. According to Bryce, the
Night of Original Scenes evolved as an
"outlet."
"Roadmark gives a person who writes
plays a definite deadlineand goal to prepare material for," said Nakamura.

Roadmark is Nakamura's first time directing at Swarthmore. Her play, "Glue
Gun," is about a glue gun inserted into
the continuity of early 20th century Japan. In it, the actresses speak in broken
English with heavy Japanese accents and
have Kabuki face makeup. "Glue Gun"
has been performed previously in Maui,
Hawaii.
"The Televison: Another Birth and Rebirth in One Act." Bryce's play is about a
man "who is not happy with his life." The
man seeks refuge in his television, which
is possessed by an angel.
The third play, written by Nolte, is a
collection of monologues about a girl's
experiences at camp. "Camp Cumulonimbus" was written in one day and
chronicles the experiences of an 11-yearold girl at a sailing camp. The performance takes the form of letters performed as monologues.
"It was written for a younger audi-

ence," Nolte said.

"In years past we've been called imma-

ture. I'm really happy that we've moved

away from that—'that' being pretentious
theater," said Bryce. "We are not pretentious theater. I'm really pleased and really impressed with the quality [of the
show] this year."

way too concerned with being

The plot of "Kabuki" doesn't
move very quickly, which Mack
justified on the letters page of
the most recent issue as not following a formula that says "there
have to be 2.5 fight scenes in every issue." Not only that, but a
slow moving plot just means
more issues until the story's
close. And I have no problem
with that.

Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' a dark, well-acted manipulation
By Morghan Holt

Eton of Irving's story, but does so

Phoenix Staff

Tim Burton's latest movie has been ripped to shreds,
criticized for destroying the original tale from which
he and Andrew Kevin Walker adapted their gory, ghoulish plot. The critics scorn Burton for transforming the
well-known "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" into a drab, depressing tale, full of fantastical, fabricated events whose
intrusions cause the story to stray enormously from the
original by Washington Irving. In these critics' eyes,
Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" will never exist as a separate
entity. As long as they continue comparing it to the original, such critics can't appreciate Burton's manipulated
version
all they see is inconsistency, which, to me,
was the primary source of the film's intrigue.
Burton's version of the legend diverges from the original plot from the very beginning. When Johnny Depp's Christina Ricci flourishes as Ichabod Crane's love interest.

"Thin" marked the long-awaited big-screen return of legendary director Terrence Malik.
The film's breathtaking cinematography coupled with a spiritual soundtrack make for a
refined movie-viewing experience. But its philosophical edge can be a turn-off— critics
dubbed it "a thinking man's war movie."
Mutant tomatoes are created by mad scientists. A renegade band of misfits tries to keep
them from taking over the world. Wackiness ensues.

The end of the millennium has the Prince of Darkness out hunting for his other half in

Burton-style. The set
is drab, devoid of color, and the characters seem almost
specter-like. This, however, only lends itself to the effect Burton was aiming for. Instead of dulling the film,
as one might expect, the film's mere appearance ties
the story together quite nicely. Dubious at first, I was
impressed by the film's fluidity.
Christina Ricci, who plays Ichabod'slove interest (yes,
another Burton/Walker addition), flourishes in her character, perhaps creating a new image for herself on
screen. No longer restricted to the part of a disconnected
adolescent girl, Ricci's success in her role proves her
ability to portray more mature personas. Playing alongside Ricci, Johnny Depp delves into the new Ichabod,
showering his viewers with a new, more complex understanding of the wimpy, goofy-looking man they all
watched as children.
"Sleepy Hollow" certainly has its cinematic weaknesses, but the film by no means deserves the trashed
rep it has received from so many stodgy reviewers. Expect gore (the story is based on decapitation). Expect
also a tale much darker than the original (dreariness
and gloom are Burton's forte). However, do not expect
"Sleepy Hollow" to follow exactly the baseline laid out
by Irving. Accept it as an entertaining, imaginative
show, full of Burton's characteristic caprice and the
power of his invention.

Harshly criticized for its deviance from the original "Legend of Sleepy Hollow," Tim

According to critics, this sequel to Pixar's jovial "Toy Story" matches its predecessor in
its wit and wizardry. The movie includes Woody, Buzz, 80-Peep, Mr. Potatohead and
the whole gang for a good time.

If you've heard about "The Sixth Sense," you already know the premise. If you haven't,

Women's swimming cruises 3-0, men's team goes
1-2 against F&M, W&L and Widener
By Becca Howes-Mischel
For The Phoenix
The intensity of the
opening cheers in each of
the swim teams' last three
meets has left no doubt
that other teams see
Swarthmore as the team to
Franklin
and
beat.
Marshall, Washington and
Lee, and Widener swim*mers all swam better than
they had previously in the
season in an effort to get
to the wall faster than Garnet swimmers. When it
was all said and done, the
women's team came out
with three wins and the
men with one. The
women's record now
stands at 4-0 and the men's
is 2-2.
Regardless of the final
scores, swimmers from
both the men's and
women's teams have had
some extremely fast races
in the recent meets. With
only two more meets remaining in the fall semester
the
season,
Swarthmore squads have
proved that they can chal-

At the Franklin and
Marshall (F&M) meet, the
women won 119-86, while
the men lost 132-69. Even
after it was evident that
F&M was simply a faster
team, the Swarthmore
men never gave up as they
continued throughout the
meet to swim some amazing races.
Mike Dudley 'O3 was the
sole male individual winner with a spectacular finish of 2:06.56 in the 200
backstroke. As the F&M
men began their victory
cheer, the men's 400
freestyle relay team of
Paul Dickson 'OO, Jason
Kerensky 'O3, Chris
Bussard 'O3 and John
Lillvis 'O3 rallied back in
the last race to end the
meet on a high note as they
stroked the wall two seconds before theF&M team
with the time of 3:25.93.
On the women's side,
Swarthmore began its
domination with a first

Women's basketball impresses after season opener loss
Garnet rebound with wins against
Wesleyan, WMC and Bryn Mawr
By Caitlin Ryland and Christina Ciambrieiio
For The Phoenix
It is not Sharpies' shrimp Creole that is hot and spicy this
year—it is the Swarthmore
women's basketball team. These
ladies of the court have been
burning up Tarble pavilion.
Lately, many unfortunate opponents have fallen victim to
Swarthmore's aggressive knock
out punch. Adversaries, be forewarned: their hot offensive hand
and saucy defense has deflated
the last three teams they have
faced, capping the winning momentum with an impressive 60point win over Bryn Mawr. Next
up: the Seven Sisters.
Swarthmore fell short of capturing the tip-off title in their
opening heartbreaker against
Endicott College. In the losing
effort, the Garnet fell 58-56.
Great expectations and seasonopening jitters unnerved the
young Swarthmore team, spurring a poor defensive showing
and a low shooting percentage in
the contest. HeatherKile 'O2 contributed 25 points and 16 rebounds; Heather Marandola'ol,
another key contributor, added
10 points and 2 assists. It was a
close game, determined only in
the final minutes. Swarthmore
didmanage, however, to rebound
from their defeat with a nail-biting game against Wesleyan University.
The Garnet team turned the
tide in the consolation game with
a thrilling series of final plays.
Despite early apprehension, the
team mustered the poise and
endurance to finish strong
against a Wesleyan team that
had controlled the score the entire game. Outstanding showings
came from Kile, who had 19
points and muscled down 15
boards, and her partner in crime
in the post, Sarah Tufano 'O3, who
chipped in 17 points and 12 rebounds. Tufano also cashed in at
the charity stripe, making nine
of 11 crunch-time free throws to
seal the victory. This marks the
first collegiate double/doublefor
the Cromwell, Connecticut
standout.
But the Swarthmore women
were not finished. Building on
the momentum from the great
Wesleyan win, the tiderolled into

Maryland (WMC) with high
hopes. Tension was high once
again in the Pavilion as
Swarthmore came out with the
"W" in a barn-burning overtime
battle. Going into halftime with
the lead, these women decided
to make things interesting, and
allowed the Western Maryland
Green Terror to creep into the
lead. Midway through the second
half, the Green Terror commanded a 13-point lead, but
Swarthmore was not done. With
a second wind coming late in the
game, the Garnet rallied. Tricaptain Marandola tied the game
with six seconds remaining.
Sophomores Katie Tarr and
Heather Kile also scored key
baskets in the decisive comeback attack.
Free-throw shooting was big
down the line, with Kristin English 'Ol, Tufano, and Kile all
stepping up to the line and sinking clutch shots. The Garnet assault
was
multifaceted:
Marandola contributed 13points
and five assists; Kile added 17
points and 17 rebounds of her
own; and Tufano came up big
with 14 points, six boards, and
three assists. The overall
standout of the game, however,
was tri-captain English. With a
stellarls-point performance, including 4-6 from three-point
land, English earned Centennial
Conference Player of the Week
accolades. Coach Adrienne
Shibles agreed that "it was one
of the best performances by a
Swarthmore basketball team
thus far."
After a short Thanksgiving
lay-off, the team looked to channel the positive energy from the
win into their next competition
against Bryn Mawr College. The
team did not disappoint. In maintaining the consistently dominating standard set by the starting
five, the bench polished off the
dismantling of the shaken
Mawrters to mount an impressive 78-18 victory in the books.
"Initially I was worried that we
would take Bryn Mawr lightly,"
said tri-captain Kira CochranBond 'OO. "But the aggressive onslaught on both ends of the court
in the first half set the precedent
for the rest of the game."
In the first half, the squad shot
47 percent from the field, connected on 75 percent of their free
throws, and shot an outstanding
80 percent from down town. In
