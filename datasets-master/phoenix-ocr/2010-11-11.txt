Complaints arise concerning writing requirement
BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu
Writing courses at Swarthmore exist
to help students learn how to express

themselves clearly and intelligently.
But the way they are currently structured is a source of frustration for
many students.
A recent thread of comments on a
Daily Gazette article revealed that,
among other problems, several students think that writing courses are
often mislabeled, and that some of them
lack the emphasis on revision and
meetings with Writing Associates that
students expect.
According to the writing program's
website, writing courses should require
"multiple writing assignments that
total at least twenty pages of analytic
writing during the semester." A course
that can fulfill the "W" requirement
should emphasize developing a student's abilities to construct, organize
and develop a thesis and argument
while collecting, presenting and analyzing evidence and documentation.
Furthermore, the website states that,
"It will pay explicit attention to the
mechanics of writing and editing,
issues of intended audience and
author's voice."
But some students have found the
lines distinguishing a writing course
from a non-writing course to be particularly blurred.
Dougal Sutherland 11 said, "I've
taken a bunch [of writing courses] without even thinking about it. Some have
had better focus on writing. The ones
that used course WAs required at least
some focus on revision process
but
others had nothing. It's pretty varied
whether they'll actually make you better at writing."
Sutherland, who is editor in chief of
the Gazette, was hopeful that'administrators would take notice of the criticisms revealed in the comments online.
The thread drew the attention of
Martin Warner, the registrar, who followed and commented on it.
Warner said in an e-mail, "I learned
a lot from the chat
and I am very
sympathetic to the student concerns
raised there. I decided the best thing I
could do in response is to try to provide
better advice to all students (and especially first-year students) about the
Writing Course Requirement." He published new information about the
requirement online, with suggestions
that students should take "W" courses
as early as possible, and try to use them
to fulfill distribution requirements.
But for students whose majors are
highly structured, it can be hard just to
find time to schedule in "W" courses.
Rebecca Roelofs 'l3 plans to major in
engineering and has had trouble taking
"W" classes in the humanities. "I basically only have one slot per semester in
which I can work on fulfilling all my
distribution requirements. Freshman
year... none of my classes were writing
classes," she said in an e-mail.
The fall semester of her sophomore
year, she planned to take an English
class, but taking a writing credit was a
requirement to take any class in the
department except for first-year seminars. "I felt totally blocked out of the
department without the writing credit,
and I didn't really have time in my

schedule to take a writing class first
and then an English class later. I
thought that exploring subjects outside
of your comfort zone was the very
essence of Swarthmore, so it should be
really easy to do!" Roelefs said.
Yet even for students who major in
writing-intensive subjects, fulfilling the
writing requirements can be difficult.
Kat Clark 'l2, an English major, never
expected that fulfilling the writing
requirement would be challenging for
her. But the absence of middle and
higher-level classes with the "W" designation limits her options.
"I took Intro to Ed and had a great
WA experience, but since then I've had
trouble finding W classes that I'm interested in," Clark said. She pointed out
that majoring in English requires her
to write extensively, but "W" courses
do not seem to acknowledge the amount
of writing done by students.
William Nessly '99, a visiting
instructor in the English department
who currently teaches a "W" class, a
first-year seminar called "The Oriental
Imagination," said that the difference
between a class that demands a lot of
writing and a "W" class is the intent of

the course. "Not just English classes
but many humanities courses and science courses have demanding writing
components. But that's different from
the self-conscious emphasis on writing
that happens in designated 'W courses," he said.
The requirements have changed
quite a bit since Nessly's days as a student here. Until the 19905, distribution
requirements could only be fulfilled
through taking specific courses called
PDCs, primary distribution courses.
PDCs were classes in the humanities,
social sciences and natural sciences
that had been recognized for meeting
various criteria.
They were supposed to be suitable
for students who intended to major in
the field as well as non-majors, have an
emphasis on the specific methodology
essential for the subject and contain a
significant
writing
component.
Students were required to take two
PDCs in each field, and could take one
non-PDC.
The administration eventually
decided to get rid of the PDC listing, but
kept the emphasis on writing.
Professors who wanted to designate

November 11, 2010

their classes as Writing classes had to
fill out an application, and the classes
that were labeled "W" are almost all
still considered to be "W" classes.
Departments can,

however, request

that a class not be labeled "W" if, for
example, the professor teaching the
course changes and the emphasis
shifts.
Constance Hungerford, provost of
the college, said that with the upcoming
Strategic Planning, it is possible the
format of Writing courses will change
once again. Until then, the solution to
problems like Clark's may lie with the
professors. "Many people whose courses are not W courses nonetheless care
very much about their students and
their writing. I think more faculty can
think about whether they want to make
courses,"
mid-level
courses
W
Hungerford said.
Hungerford stressed, though, that
requiring students to learn to write
well will not change. "Writing well is a
reflection of thinking well, and the ability to communicate is tremendously
important. We want to find ways of
ensuring our students are graduating
with that skill honed," she said.

Meat Day to be held next Tuesday on Mertz Field
BY NAVIN SABHARWAL
nsabharl@swarthmore.edu

16th, the
On Tuesday, Nov.
Swarthmore Good Food Project will
hold a hog roast, followed by a panel
discussion on Mertz Field. "It's a combination barbeque panel discussion to
raise awareness about ecological meat
on campus," said Marjorie Herbert 'l2,
a member of the Good Food Project and
organizer of the event.
The roast will occur all day Tuesday,
and its organizers hope to bring awareness to the Swarthmore community.
Sarah Scheub, a Good Food member
involved in the event, said that the
community is "experiencing a disconnect between their food and how it is
raised and where it comes from and
who raises it and how it gets on a
plate."
Flyers outlining what ecological
meat is will be distributed soon. The
organizers hope that it will be an experience where students can "visually
experience" and "see with [their] eyes
and associate that with eating
meat... and be okay with that or not
okay with that," Scheub said.
She also hopes that people recognize
"that this was raised by people," and
that this "play[s] into [their] choices as
...

...

consumers]."

The panel discussion will consist of
five farmers who will introduce themselves, discuss how they raised the animals, the hardships they faced and the
triumphs they enjoyed. Participants
include a farmer who raises pork,
someone who has a stand in the
farmer's market and a beef producer.
German
Studies
professor
Hansjakob Werlen, who is also the
founder of Philadelphia Slow Food, an
educational organization supporting

ecologically proper food production
and revival of food traditions, will
moderate the discussion.
"[Good Food is] a campus group, one
of the green groups, who focuses mainly on food issues, whether that's sustainable agricultural or sustainable living practices," Scheub said. The group
grows a variety of crops throughout
the year, and its produce has been sold
to the college dining services and local
anti-hunger advocates.
Additionally, Good Food runs a composting program used by the college's
dining services, including Sharpies
and Essie Mae's. Schueb also emphasized how the group is "doing it for the
community" and "doing projects to
open [the] discussion [of sustainability
issues]"
Organizers of the event do not foresee any problems or controversies

regarding roasting meat on campus.

"We're
Scheub said. "We think more than
most people do about meat."
Moreover, she emphasized that the
meat is being created and processed
"in an ecological way."
Doug Woos 'IX a vegetarian, seems
to agree with this point and the idea of
the pig roast. "Obviously most Swatties
eat meat, so I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with having a
meat-centric event on campus," Woos
said in an e-mail.
"In some sense a pig roast is a good
thing in that it forces a direct connection to the hog in a way that pork-on-aplate from Sharpies really doesn't," he
added. "I hope that this extends to the
organizers doing research to determine
the best source for a pig, and that the
animal they select has been raised and
slaughtered humanely (which is not at
all the norm)."

Peer mentoring program to help autistic students
BY ALLISON SHUSHTERMAN
TRIANGLE.ORG, NOV. 5, 2010
This fall, the Drexel Autism
Support Program will be helping Drexel students with
autism
their
improve
University experience through
a peer mentoring program.
The program will strive to
enhance self-advocacy skills,
interpersonal relations and
other strategies critical to college success for students on the
autistic spectrum. Directed by
Dr. Felicia Hurewitz, an assistant professor in the department of psychology, the course
will pair autistic students with
non-autistic peer mentors to
guide them through the complexities of college life.
As the staff prepare for the
first class to commence in coming weeks, they arc still searching for autistic students and
peer mentors who would be a
good fitfor the program. Daniel
Smith, a Drexel Autism
Support Program trainer and
neuropsychology candidate, is

THE PHOENIX

responsible for selecting peer

mentors. Smith is looking for
students who are able to make

the time commitment, have
had experience working with
the disabled and are mature
enough to guide their autistic
peers. Motives for involvement
in the program also play a
large role in selecting peer

mentors.

Once admitted into DASP, a
peer mentor is matched up
with an autistic student based
on their age and gender. The
use of appropriate and effective
relationships enables all students to grow and learn
the program.
throughout
Before the course begins,
Smith will hold six trainings
that will enable peer mentors
to learn more about their role
in the program and how to best
deal with any challenges they
may face.
Research shows that autistic students tend to be stronger
visual learners,
and
so
Hurewitz has adjusted lessons
to optimize student learning.

"I use many demonstrations
in the class to help the autistic
students gain a better grasp of
the material. For instance,
sometimes I will play humorous videos, or have students
role play experiential situations, like how to strike up a
conversation with another student," Hurewitz said.
Throughout the course, the
director of DASP emphasizes
that in order for the autistic
students to truly be successful
at college, they must advocate
for their rights as students.
Many individuals with autism
have executive functioning
problems, a difficulty discovered during neuropsychological testing. As a result, these
students benefit from accommodations provided through
the Drexel Office of Disability
Services.
"In the program, I inform
the autistic students about the
process of going to ODS and
getting the accommodations
they qualify for, like extended
time for tests and priority regNovember 11,2010

istration. Allowing these students to register early for their
classes can enable them to
build a schedule that best fits
their needs," Hurewitz said.
Hurewitz also notes that the
course not only hopes to prepare autistic students for college life, but also for the workforce.
"People with autism are not
as successful with job placement and retention. This does
not stem from their inability to
do the work, but rather from
their poor social skills. This
program strives to increase
these skills, which will lead to
a more expansive social network," Hurewitz said.
Elliott Berkowitz Sturgis, a
psychology major graduating
in 2011, will assess the effect of
DASP on each autistic student's social network.
"For my senior thesis, I am
creating a questionnaire that
the autistic students will complete before and after the
course. This will be used as an
instrument to see what effect

the support network in DASP
has had on their social integration," Sturgis said.
The program first began in
the fall of 2009 with four autistic students and four peer mentors. Since the program's
inception, consultants, as well
as professors at four other colleges in eastern Pennsylvania,
have received training in the
course.
Participating institutions
for this coming term include
St.
Joseph's
University,
Swarthmore and Carbondale
Community College.
Created under grants from
the Pennsylvania Bureau of
Autism Services, it will be
funded from 2009-2011 by the
Bureau
According to the Bureau
website, "The DASP project
was created by Drexel as a way
to
in
give
colleges
Pennsylvania resources to
accommodate students with
autism who are attending, or
planning to attend, post-secondary institutions."

Students take off for annual Quidditch World Cup
BY SABA HAMEDY

DAILYFREEPRESS.COM, NOV. 9, 2010

Tom Ford, a College of Arts and
Sciences freshman, spends his Sundays
sprinting around the Boston University
Beach dressed in a yellow T-shirt and
shorts with a tube sock carrying a tennis
ball wrapped around his waist.
Ford isn't crazy, he's just the snitch:
the key to winning the game of
Quidditch, the sport featured in J.K.
Rowling's popular "Harry Potter" series.
His job is to run around until a seeker
from either team catches him, which
would result in victory.
Whoever said Quidditch isn't for
Muggles was wrong. Colleges across the
country, including Boston University,
are making the magical sport a reality
for wannabe wizards and athletes alike.
On Saturday, about 50 colleges and
universities will compete in the fourth
annual Quidditch World Cup.
In the past, the cup has been held at
Middlebury College, the first school that
brought the sport to life in fall of 2005.
However, because of an increase in
college participation, the cup has a new
home in New York City at Dewitt Clinton
Park.
Just like in "Harry Potter," each team
has seven people on the field at a time
three chasers, two beaters, a keeper and
-

a seeker. However, because none of the
can actually fly, college
Quidditch is slightly different than the
fictional game. Rather than keeping
their balance while flying, team members must multi-task by holding a broom
between their legs with one hand at all
times.
While the seeker searches for the
snitch, the beaters hit people with
"bludgers" (dodge balls) and the chasers

to 80 players and now we feel like we are
going to be a bigger force to be reckon
with then we were last year at the World
Cup."

BUQ is taking 20 players, a coach, a
snitch and a referee to New York City via
the Megabus, team members said.
"Quidditch may seem like a joke, but
it is far from that," Houseman said. "The
amount of bruises, blood and injuries
sustained from Quidditch at a daily practice or game is unimaginable to those
who have never seen us play. We are BU

From DiBruno's to pho, Italian market has it all
In the latter portion of
the 19th century, Italian
immigrants flooded East
Coast cities, creating ethnic enclaves in Boston,
New
York
and
Philadelphia, among other
American cities. Today,
ItalianPhiladelphia's
American
is
heritage
vibrantly evident, even in

the suburbs. A oncescorned group of immigrants is now the old
guard, an essential part of
the
character
of
Philadelphia. The city's
Italian cultural heritage remains prominently on display
at the Italian Market in South Philadelphia, though subsequent waves of immigrants have added businesses representing their own cultures and creating a sense of historical layering in the area that geology can't mimic:
Mexican and Central American immigrants work in
Italian butcheries. Shops with "pho" signs in the window
face Chinese dry cleaning services, and when the wind is
right, someplace out of sight smells like pastry cream and
confectioners' sugar.
Known informally as the 9th Street Market, the Italian
Market area runs from Fitzwater Street (north) to
Wharton Street (south), generally within a three-block
east-west radius of 9th Street, within the Bella Vista neighborhood. There are good things to be found beyond these
boundaries, in particular a slate of Southeast Asian restaurants to the south and the west.
Beyond the sidewalk displays of exotic and familiar
produce are a slew of traditionally Italian-owned foodrelated shops, including butcheries, spice shops, bakeries
and cheese shops. The area's most well-known store is certainly Dißruno Brothers', (930 S. 9th St.) which specializes
in cheese and sells anything you might want to accompany that cheese. Dißruno's is a small specialty grocery
(they do have larger locations, including one . in
Rittenhouse, but this is the original), and an expensive one

but the samples are free. If mozzarella is truly
what you seek, look down the block to Claudio's (926 S.
9th), where they make it, stuff it and smoke it on site. Tea
and coffee lovers and serious cooks should stop by Fante's
Kitchen Wares Shop (1006 S. 9th), a source for most everything a home cook could want.
If you are hit with the aforementioned sweet smell of
pastry as you cross Christian Street, it's coming from
Isgro Pastries (1009 Christian Street). Stop in for cannoli
and a wide range of other Italian-American classics that
look like they materialized out of a glossy mid-century
cookbook. For hoagies, Sarcone's Deli (734 S. 9th) is the
place to be. If you crave a bit more of the American in your
Italian-American adventure, just south of the market on
the two south corners of 9th and Passyunk Avenue, Pat's
and Geno's solicit your judgement on which Philly cheese
steak reigns supreme. (Which of them originated the iconic sandwich is likely to endure as a contested fact.)
If you wander beyond the awnings of 9th Street, you
might note the high number of Vietnamese restaurants in
the area. In fact, several differentSoutheast Asian cuisines
are represented in the area. For pho,- try Pho 75's Bella
Vista branch (1122 Washington Ave #F), and for bahn-mi,
try Viet Huong Restaurant (1100 Washington Ave.). A good
eight to ten blocks south (depending on how you count) is
Hardena/Waroeng Surabaya Restaurant, (1754 Hicks St.),
possibly the best place in the city for Indonesian food.
What if you don't want Southeast Asian food or Italian
food? For Mexican food, try Moctezuma Restaurant (1108 S.
9th St), just south of the Italian Market on 9th Street.
Further south, Bitar's (947 Federal St.) offers cheap, Zagatrated falafel; see if you can get extra pickled turnips
instead of lettuce. North of the market, snout-to-tail eaters
will appreciate the high-duality French offerings at Bibou
(1009 S. Bth St.).
There are two primary ways to get to the Italian Market
using SEPTA: The fastest and cheapest way is to take the
Media-Elwyn Line towards Center City, get off at 49th
Street, and take the 64 Bus towards Pier 70. To catch the 64
Bus after disembarking from the train, head right to the
west end of the platform, ascend the stairs, and make a
right across the bridge over the tracks. You should find
yourself at the corner of 49th and Chester Ave. About ten

meters east of the intersection, on 49th Street, is a bus stop
sign for the 64 Bus (among others). Take advantage of the
silver guardrail as you wait
but since the bus runs
roughly every 15 minutes, you shouldn't have to wait long.
The main bus stop for the Italian Market is at 9th and
Washington, but you can get off a few blocks earlier (say,
at 12th Street & Washington Ave.) if you want to explore
the area a bit more. Round-trip fare to 49th Street is $7.50
in advance ($8 on board). Each trip on the bus costs one
token or two dollars; tokens can be purchased in packs of
two for $3lO, bringing the total cost of the trip to $10.60.
(According to the SEPTA website, it is also possible to purchase a transfer for $1 when your trip requires two different SEPTA services. This must be purchased at the time of
purchase of the initial service (for example, your first
train ride). The website says nothing of purchasing transfers in advance. I am not familiar with this process; for
more information, inquire at the Swarthmore Station ticketing office.)
Your other option is to continue on the Media-Elwyn
Line to Suburban Station and walk from JFK 17th to the
Broad Street Line station at City Hall, on the Market Street
&

side. Take the Broad Street Line in the AT&T Center direction, southbound, and get off at Ellsworth-Federal Station.
This will put you on Broad Street between Ellsworth
Street, to the north, and Federal Street, to the south.
Washington Avenue is one block north of Ellsworth; Broad
Street functions as 14th Street, so when you come to the
corner of Washington Broad from the Ellsworth-Federal
Station, the 9th Street Market is five blocks down the
street to the right. Since each trip on the Broad Street Line
costs one token or two dollars, it is cheaper to purchase an
Independence Pass for $ll than to pay round-trip trainfare
to Center City ($10.75 in advance, $l2 on board) and two
bus fares.
The benefit of buying an Independence Pass if you plan
to take the 64 Bus is that, if you decide to venture six
blocks north to South Street when you're done exploring
the Italian Market, and then maybe you wander all the
way up to Rittenhouse Square or City Hall, the Pass will
bring you back to Swarthmore on the Media-Elwyn Line
with no additional cost. If you want to have an extensive
&

day trip, the flexibility is worth the extra $0.40. If you
choose to buy an Independence Pass for either route, try to
plan ahead and purchase it in advance at the Swarthmore
Station ticketing office, where they will give you the physical pass. While it looks like the flimsy credit card-style
passes that allow one to pass through turnstiles in other

cities, it doesn't allow the same ease of access. You'll have
to show it to each ticketing agent and wait for him or her
to grant you access to your next SEPTA service.

Are gap years a growing trend among Swatties?
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DINA ZINGARO

dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

Typically, students continuing in academia go
straight from high school to college, and then (19.8%
of the time if they're a Swattie) to graduate school.
However, some students choose a less traditional
path and take a gap year, or a year off. Whether
before, during, and/or after college, the time offers
students an alternative to the conventional path of
continuous schooling.
Reporting in a recent article on gap years,
MSNBC said, "Experts say no one tracks the exact
numbers of American students taking gap years, but
most agree the trend is steadily growing in popularity." In 2008, Princeton University created the
"Bridge Year Program," which offers undergraduates a pre-collegiate year abroad for public service
before matriculating at the college.
Swarthmore also embraces the pre-collegiate gap
year and since 2003, the college has averaged about
six deferrals each year. There were three defers in
the class of 2003, two for 2005, 12 for 2006, four for
2008, and five for 2013, along with 8 students currently on gap years who will defer to the class of 2015.
When interviewing prospective students, Dean of
Admissions Jim Bock often asks, "What would you
do next year if you didn't go to college?" Often unanticipated, the question catches most students off
guard. "It's amazing how often [students] get stuck
because they have been so pre-programmed to think
that success is getting into a good college and getting
a good job," Bock said.
In an interview with NPR in 2008, Bock described
a pre-collegiate gap year as "the new summer."
"Summer used to be the time you took off, you had a
vacation, you went to the beach and you hung out,"
Bock said. Under the pressure of applying to selective schools, students often spend summers doing
activities to boost their application, and so Bock
believes students sometimes just need a break.
For pre-collegiate gap years, Swarthmore policy
asks students to inform the college of the decision
before June 1 following their high school graduation.
Also, students must send in the $250 nonrefundable
deposit, along with a waiver promising not to apply
to other schools, which is also signed by their parents and high school guidance counselor.
Though it can be relatively unstructured, students must have a plan for how they will spend the
year. During December of the gap year, students also
write an informal summation of their activities for
the college. With these relatively lenient requirements, Bock hopes to avoid "discourag[ing] creativi-

ty and imagination," and instead wants students to
do "whatever [they] can dream up."
Following senior graduation, Rachel Crane 'l3
spent her year glass-blowing at Penland School of
Crafts and then abroad in Greece and Japan in creative writing and dance classes. "I was really burned
out and I needed some time away from academia so I
could come in and be ready to go and give
Swarthmore everything I have," she said.
Also abroad, Ben Wolcott 'l4 spent his gap year in
an Israeli commune called "The Freedom Builders"
that mimics the traditional kibbutz, which is a collective community based on an agricultural lifestyle.
Living in a communal space with a shared bank
account and in a small bedroom with four roommates, Wolcott improved his ability to share spaces,
understand different perspectives and participate in
dialogue and discussion.
Though he admits his balance between academics
and a social life is far from perfect, Wolcott believes
his gap year did help him re-prioritize his prior high
school habit of choosing schoolwork over friends.
"My priorities cannot be so clear
there needs to be
more gray. My friends cannot just come below my
schoolwork and activities because [my friends] are
essential," he said.
Similarly, Crane developed this sense of balance.
"It's still something I struggle with the most, but
without the gap year, I would just be one of those
Swatties who doesn't know how to just put it away
and say okay, that's enough
I'm allowed to do
something else now," Crane said.
Living abroad on her own, Crane learned to shop
and cook for herself and thus, the transition to the
college's dorm life and dining hall proved to be a
challenge. "Though I was not in the real world while
living in Greece and writing poetry in my free time,
I was still being more self-sufficient than I am here.
Not having that control felt like backtracking,"
Crane said.
Another gap year student, Rebecca Kranz 'l3,
echoes Crane's expressions of the difficult transition
into the college lifestyle. After mastering the "whole
living on your own thing," Kranz struggled with
acclimating to dorm life and a meal plan. "It was a
hard transition, but it was definitely worth it," she
said.
During her year, Kranz spent time at a non-profit
organization called "Save America's Forests," at the
Natural History Museum at the Smithsonian
Institute, in West Virginia for an environmental education internship and finally at a Hawthorne Valley
organic farm in NY.
Other students choose to go on gap years while at
Swarthmore to explore other options and discover
their passion, or because they feel burnt out. Dean of
Students Myrt Westphal believes that America's
youth, in the traditional path in academia, rarely
stop to consider their strengths and passions. "But,
when you get to Swarthmore and find yourself surrounded by people who really do know what they
want to do and are passionate, you say, 'Hm, what
about me?'" Westphal said.
Some students seek such gap years for health,
financial and personal issues as well, but as long as
the gap year is the students' choice, the college only
requires students to fill out a form indicating the
date beginning and ending their intended absence.
In situations where the college asks the student to
take time offfor disciplinary, health or financial reasons, the process requires a written paper upon their
return about what they did during their year. "What
we want to see is that.you've gotten your life together and you've organized something that was meaningful to you," Westphal said.
After graduation, Swarthmore alums join the
growing trend of post-graduate gap years to spend
time away from academia to consider the future.
Now living in NYC, Oscar Guzman 'lO worked for the
last few months at Cinema Tropical, which is a nonprofit media arts organization that promotes Latin
American Cinema in the US.
In considering a Ph.D., Guzman used the time off
to reconsider and confirm his desire to pursue further schooling. "I don't regret taking the time off

Rebecca Kranz spent part of her gap year at an organic
farm in New York and working for the non-profit "Save
America's Forests."
I really needed it for my sanity," Guzman said. "If
you are going for a Ph.D., I think you should take a
gap year because it is going to be six years of your

life
it's more than half a decade."
For students like Guzman, Westphal feels that a
couple years of practical life, whether at a research
job or a law firm, can help students figure out their
next move. "When are you going to take that time to
sort of synthesize your life?" she said.
During her pre-collegiate gap year and summer
before college, Hana Lehmann 'l3 worked four different jobs in her hometown of South Dakota.
Forking over $20,000 for her first semester discouraged Hana from taking her education lightly. She
said, "You can academically invest quite a bit, but it
isn't the same thing as actually financially having to
invest in your education."
In agreement with Dean Westphal's sentiments
about the need for time off, Lehmann said,
"Sometimes you just need really big Sabbaths."

What She's Wearing:
"This scarf is from a boutique in Dublin," said
Novotnak, who studied abroad at Trinity College
Dublin's school in Belfast, Ireland last semester. "I
ended up doing a lot of shopping while I was over there.
[T] justreally loved everything they had there and it was
completely different." Her striped top and panne velvet
skirt are from J.Crew, herblack sweater is from Target
and her leopard print and leather purse is from Urban
Outfitters. Novotnak also has an extensive jewelry collection and is wearing a few standout pieces, like the
double-stranded pearl necklace she purchased from
Attic, a consignment shop. "These boots have been
passed down in my family," Novotnak said. "They're my
cowboy boots that I wear almost too much."
How She Describes Her Personal Styl&
Novotnak describes her style as both cute and eclectic. "I don't like to dress... in very conservative pieces,"
she said. "I'm very much into unique, antique-y pieces
and kind of building offof that." Novotnak taps into her
love of the antique with her vintage-inspired necklaces
and her velvet skirt, but keeps it modern with the skirt's
luster paired with the black tights and cowboy boots.
Fashion Influences / Inspirations:
"I was very influenced by my time abroad,"
Novotnak said. She loved how people all over Europe,
specifically in Ireland and the UK, dress up nicely every
day. "It doesn't matter for what, or what time of the day,
or even what reason, but they always really present
themselves and I guess that really influenced me as kind
of putting on a presentation every day."
Novotnak has loved art her whole life, especially
impressionist art, and finds that her appreciation for
beauty meshes with how she puts together an outfit. "I
kind of approach it more from the sense of like putting
together a piece of art instead of just putting on clothes,"

clothing as "nothing over the top
and nothing incredibly vintage."

Where She Shops:
"All over," Novotnak said. She
enjoys shopping at J.Crew and
Urban Outfitters, but also frequents
consignment shops, T.J. Maxx and
Marshall's for cheap, unique finds.
Novotnak likes "finding those cheap
pieces that you can kind of keep
adding on to your wardrobe."
Favorite Items in Her Closet:
"My cowboy boots and actually, anything in leopard print," Novotnak said. "I
actually have this odd sense that cowboy
boots and leopard print go with anything." While leopard print may sometimes seem wild or more for an accessory,
the animal print is turning into a basic,
just like black, brown or navy. From a leopard print cardigan to shoes or even to a
purse like Novotnak's, leopard adds another dimension to any outfit, but can also act
as a basic on its own.
Wardrobe Staples:
For Novotnak, black leggings and boots
are her main staples. "Not just my cowboy
boots," she said, adding that any sort of boot
and black leggings make up much of her
wardrobe.

Tradition and invention blend in recent concert
BY JOHN OH

joh2@swarthmore.eclu

After a stunning performance with
guest artist and former "Star Trek: The
Next Generation" actress Marina Sirtis,
Orchestra
2001
back
to
came
Swarthmore's Lang Concert Hall on
Sunday, Nov. 9 to give an equally out-ofthis-world performance featuring Wu
Man, considered one of the world's great-

est pipa players.
With lights dimmed, the concert started off with the piece "Naibh Beags
(Nyvaigs)" by Jennifer Margaret Barker,
featuring the struggle and eventual triumph of the Celtics against the Vikings.
The tension and anxiety created by the
music kept building and building until it
climaxed, crashing down to a haunting
soprano melody, sung by Noel
Archambeault. The narration, by Barker,
framed the entire piece with an introduction and conclusion, and the piece ended,
as it started, with a dimming of the lights.
The next piece was a Concerto for
String Quartet and Pipa, a piece written
by Tan Dun specifically for Wu. "While
Tan Dun was writing this piece for me,
we went back and forth on the timbre and
colors that I could make with my instrument and how that fit in with the rest of

the orchestra," Wu said. The entire con-

certo was composed of a traditional

12

string quartet and the pipa. The pipa, a
lute with strings that are strummed or
plucked, could be heard clearly above the
quartet when needed. Its sound projected
well throughout the hall with a virtuosic
quality, further pronounced by the mixture of traditional Chinese melodies and
Western music. The most interesting
quality about the quartet was that the
instruments were played to emulate the
pipa in many different ways, with the
musicians plucking and strumming the
strings, tapping the body of their instruments and using the Bartok Pizzicatos
technique, which is when the player
plucks a string so that it slaps against the
fingerboard of the instrument.
The third piece was a world premier
called "Transformations in Purple," by
May-Tchi Chen. Meant for solo pipa, Wu
came out alone and performed with passion, swaying to and fro to the rolling
phrases of the piece. The next piece,
"Lunahuana" by Jay Reise, was also a
world premier. This piece was played by
two accomplished percussionists, who
impressively controlled their many dif-

ferent instruments.
The finale was Tan's "Circle with
Four Trios, Conductor, and Audience,"
which included audience interaction.
The audience rehearsed how to sigh out
loud with a crescendo for four or six
beats, twittering, gossiping and shouting

at the cue and cutoff of the conductor.
The players were scattered throughout
the hall in the shape of a circle and the
conductor acted as the high priest of all,
narrating certain parts while facing the
audience. It was a great finish to an
evening filled with pieces that many of
the audience members were unfamiliar
with.
The concert ended with a final encore
by Wu playing "White Snow in Spring," a
traditional pipa piece. The dexterity of
her hands proved incredible, as all the
different types of techniques were exer-

"This was a concert of concerts. We
were extremely lucky to have Wu Man
perform with us for this concert," Daniel
Underhill Professor Emeritus of Music
James Freeman said. Many techniques
used by the composers of these pieces are
normally not seen in regular concerts,
such as shouting, using the audience as
performers and displacement of the performers across the concert hall. The concert ended with a standing ovation. "It
was truly an amazing concert,"
Mackenzie Pierce 11 said.

be considered standard.
Some time ago, my roommate and

I discovered
that a mouse had moved into our room and we began
calling her Leslie. This isn't her first appearance in
this column, and I have reason to believe she's fairly
involved in campus life, so you may already be familiar with her. She disappears for long stretches of time
during which I can only imagine she's attending
band practice and playing badminton. She's
ally a very nice mouse.
Unfortunately, Leslie has gone insane. She's taken
to eating our coffee grounds and running around all
night bouncing off the refrigerator. The other day I
woke up before six to a frenzied rustling, clanging
sound that I'd initially figured, in my sleepiness, was
my roommate either raking leaves or making all of
our notebooks into paper airplanes very quickly.
Both of these made perfect sense for five minutes or
so before it occurred to me that the sound was probably coming from Leslie. I have to assume that she was
practicing Scottish sword dancing and falling over a
lot, because the only other thing she could have been

tariachi

doing would have been leaping violently up and down
while attempting to eat a plastic bag.
I'm sure that all of this is a result of her having
absorbed our stress. The poor thing has developed a
caffeine addiction and can't sleep. By the time I was
fully awake, I had realized that were I to investigate

the hideous scene unfolding beside the refrigerator, I
would most likely find Leslie attempting to finish my
art history paper. I've been feeling pretty terrible
about this, actually
most mice don't have to be
stressed about art history papers or resort to co'
fee. Of course, it is also true that most mice doget to join mariachi bands or play badminton. I was trying to explain to my
mother over the telephone recently the
fact that I had somehow brought the resi
dent mouse to the brink of emotional breakdown and realized in doing so that things V
might not be so bad for her. "And thus I've

mice have to spend all their time feeling stressed
about the possibility of being eaten.
It's interesting to apply this notion to humans:
"Regardless of everything," we ought to think to ourselves, "I am unlikely to be eaten." This is a ridiculously good point in every situation. There are exceptions of course, but in those situations one doesn't
tend to be concerned with making good points. One
tends to be concerned with saying "Aaaggghhhh!!!!"
or fleeing. Still, we could
make the sentiment more
universally applicable by
altering it slightly to
"Regardless of everything, I am unlikely to be

Soulfège

fuses diverse array of musical genres

BY ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

Afropolitan group Soulfege will be
performing this Friday as part of the
Coopef Series, bringing their music's
African roots onto the world stage.
The band's founders, DNA (Derrick N
Ashong) and Jonathan Gramling, are
from Ghana and the Philadelphia

area, respectively. The other members

of the band
Alex Staley, Stix Bones,
Attfe Addo and Micah Hulscher
originate from different places across
the United States, ranging from
Oregon to Seattle. The influences of
each of the members' unique experiences growing up as an Afropolitan
combine to form a sound that blends a
diverse array of musical genres.
Afropolitan is the combination of
the words African and cosmopolitan.
It describes the generation of the children of African emigrants to the West
who therefore grew up in a culture
different from their family's heritage.
Bridging these two cultures, these
children typically identify with both.
Therefore they are neither African
nor American, for example, but rather
a mix: thus, the creation of a distinctly Afropolitan worldview.

Spending a sleepless night in the global capital

swarthmorephoenix.com

My last column probably made readers dive

headfirst into the deepest, darkest recesses of
my cultural morass here
in the City of Lights.
While culture shock is
never a pleasant subject
to discuss, especially
when a much-beloved
city like Paris falls under
question, it has not
entirely
defined my
Maki Somosot
study abroad experience.
Small But Classe
There are plenty of wonderful experiences
most of them unforgettable
that I've been lucky enough to enjoy in this

city.

Despite my criticisms, Paris still preserves much
of its native charm, reminding me of my purpose for
coming here in the first place. It may be dirty and
overpopulated in places, but it is still, at heart, a
beautiful city that is rich in history and continues to
captivate visitors and residents. One could argue
that this kind of initial impression did not bode well
for the eventual culture shock I experienced, but
that is besides the point.
First off, the stereotype of Paris as a vibrant global capital of culture is true. Each week, a plethora of
artistic and musical events takes place all throughout the city. Countless new bars, clubs and restaurants open their doors to eager clientele. Paris is in
a constant cultural flux but never fails to promote its
fast-paced nightlife and arts scene.
A student-friendly city, Paris allows students to
benefit from significant discounts at events and also
grants free entry to most museums. Major events are
well-publicized, thanks to a massive, city-wide
poster campaign, supplemented by a slate of previews and reviews found in free weekly magazines
whose sole purpose for publication is to recommend
weekend entertainment highlights. These are strategically placed at every Metro station, where
Parisians can leaf through their pages while bored
during their daily commute. Also free are booklets
and leaflets containing precious practical information on live music concerts and on up-and-coming
artists seeking an audience
all of which have
accumulated in a massive pile in my room. It amazes
me how much Paris has effectively transformed culture into both a core business and a lifestyle for its
residents.
The "Nuit Blanche" (roughly translated as "sleepless night" or "all-nighter") is a perfect example of
how leisure and entertainment have been institutionalized in the Parisian calendar. On every first
Saturday of October, numerous unusual cultural and
artistic spectacles take place all throughout Paris all
night long, running from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. the next
morning. Museums and special exhibits in Paris also
grant free entry for this one special night. Several
Metro and bus lines run all night for this purpose.
At this year's "Nuit Blanche," my group of friends
ran around the center of Paris all night, hopping
from a surrealist short film, to an interpretive silent
theater piece, to a documentary of European immigrants recounting an object of sentimental importance from their homeland and then finally to a
giant wall display of alarm clocks counting down to
the end of the night. It's impressive how seriously
this city takes its fun.
Paris also considers its laidback pace oflife a serious business. This manifests in the widespread cafe
and bistro culture, where customers like to sit on the
outside terrace with a cold beer or a freshly-brewed
espresso shot while chatting with friends for hours
on end. My friends and I have made a habit of going
out for coffee or beer just to unwind at the neighborhood watering holes. Another means of relaxation is
to stroll around Paris whenever the weather is
agreeable, leading to surprising discoveries like hidden streets and secret passageways otherwise
unknown to tourists.
Although my housing is far from perfect, my
quartier is home to one of the most culturally

14

diverse communities and some of the liveliest
nightlife scenes in Paris. The 20th arrondissement is
composed of Menilmontant and Belleville, previously poor working-class districts, which now boast an
array of bars, concert spaces, galleries and restaurants catering to every taste and distinction. The
20th is also a hotbed of creative and political activity, thanks to its resident artists, musicians and leftists.
Compared to the more touristy neighborhoods in
the center ofParis, the 20th is much cheaper and possibly more authentic. My foyer compensates for its
living standards with its strategic location right in
the middle of Menilmontant. Located just downhill
from my foyer is Oberkampf, another popular
nightlife spot, while Belleville itself is just a 15minute walk away. Personal highlights of my quartier include the underground dive bars that feature
free live music (with the consumption of at least one
drink), and several choice restaurants. But my best
discovery has to be the neighborhood park on top of
the hill, with a 360-degree panorama of Paris that
beats the crowds sitting on the Sacre Coeur Church
steps any day.
While I griped about how small Paris was in my
last column, I also acknowledge the obvious advantage that it is easy and convenient to travel throughout the city. The Metro is an extensive train system
that serves every possible nook and cranny of Paris

and is generally dependable, running even on official protest days. The Metro map makes logical sense
and making transfers is never a stressful hassle,
since all the changes for other lines are clearly
marked. Convenience aside, another charm of the
Paris Metro is the literally underground musical
scene that it supports. Busking musicians
including mariachi bands, accordionists, jazz manouche
duos, African guitarists and opera singers, just to
name a few
embark on trains everyday to play
impromptu music for passengers, who often give
generous donations, Of course, there are also the
homeless who beg for money, but this is an unfortunate reality that exists in every big city.
Paris is known for wonderful historical architecture, but this had never struck me so concretely
until I had to mount the back of a scooter, while running errands for my internship. There is no feeling
more exhilarating in the world than flying past monument after monument and seeing distinctive
Parisian neighborhoods blur into one another.
Hands down, riding on the back of a fast-moving
scooter that someone else is driving is the best way
to enjoy Paris. It's moments like these that make me
believe again in the all-glittering, dreamlike stereotype of this city, and momentarily forget about its
grubbier realities.

Refine foreign language
requirement for next year
By design, the foreign language
requirement underlines the college's
understanding that studying a foreign
language is key for a liberal arts educa-

tion.
Nevertheless, this requirement is
flawed, from its ill-fitting evaluation of
students' experience in high school to its
rather lenient expectations of proficiency.
We believe that the college should
embolden the current requirement for the
incoming class, especially since the language programs here are so strong. As the
college is currently seeking to examine its

yearlong introductory or semester-long
intermediate college-level course; or
learn English as a second language.
It should come as no surprise that a

school such as Swarthmore, focused on
egalitarianism and social justice issues,
would push its students to recognize the
importance of learning a foreign language.

After all, multi-language proficiency is
the bedrock for global communication
a note perhaps obvious to Swarthmore,
but not to many in a nation fraught with
anti-immigration activists and filled with
English-language-only pundits.
Learning a second language enhances
cognitive, listening and communicative
skills, among others. And learning a lan-

guage, between the inevitable mistakes

and constant challenges we must deal
with, teaches a hard yet salient lesson:
failing is sometimes the best way to learn.
While the college's current secondary
language requirement rightly seeks to
instill the importance of language education in its students, it doesn't offer a
meaningful or consistent evaluation of
students' performance in high school.
Requiring three years of language
study in high school fails to acknowledge
students' markedly different high school
experiences. Some high school language
programs focus more on grammar, reading comprehension and vocabulary, but

Swarthmore's classes heavily encourage.
Equating three years of high school with
one or two semesters at the college, then,
may pose an issue since the college's language classes admirably use immersion
techniques.
More simply, we think that more students should take advantage of the college's strong language departments,
which have excellent professors who offer

Much of the
trouble in considering a new language

other small colleges.

students to test out of either the fourth- or
fifth-level of a foreign language
a more
stringent requirement that seems to better ensure proficiency.
Bryn Mawr expects its students to get
a score of at least 690, pass a placement
exam from the college or take two classes
above introductory level. Haverford,
among providing other options, wisely
sets studying abroad as one option for fulfilling the language requirement.
In turn, we propose that students,
regardless of their high school education,
take a foreign language placement exam
similar to the ones already available
before their first year. If they do not place
into a literature class, students should be
required to take up to the fourth level of a

language.
Studying abroad or participating in an
immersion program should be an option
for fulfilling the language requirement
under the approval of the college or specific department; students, then, would
retake the placement exam after their
programs end.
Certainly, there should still be flexibil-

After all, Swarthmore's strength as an
institution largely stems from having
requirements that resist heavy-handedness and trust students to shape their
own paths. In turn, students here clearly
value foreign language learning and are
already taking advantage of classes here.
Nevertheless, we believe the college
should refine the foreign language

are planning to improve America's
infrastructure.
Specifically, I'm not familiar with the
general Republican stance on highspeed, inter-city railways. But considering Republicans' general inclination to
slash spending and refusal to raise taxes
it seems that, at least on the state level,
they will not support plans to introduce
high-speed rail services. Democrats,
and particularly the White House,
should propose to invest in high-speed
rail
funded by an increase in fuel

taxes.

First off, I don't blame America for

not having a rail system as developed as

Europe's. Because the American economy and American society are more
tightly integrated than countries within
even the European Union, there is a
more pressing need for long-distance
travel that is well suited for airplanes
and less so for trains.
Since everything in America is generally bigger than in Europe, including
towns and roads and distances between
home and work, the fact that Americans
drive their cars more often is also partially defensible.
(Yes
a 2003 study published in the
American Journal of Public Health
journal showed that Americans are
much less likely to walk or cycle for
even the shortest of trips, those of only
one or two miles, and much more likely
to take the car, than Europeans are. But
I digress.)
For these reasons America has not
invested in its rail network for passenger travel in decades and is now lagging

letter

to

behind.Calls to improve high-speed rail
are frequently illustrated, especially in
popular magazines such as Time, with
comparisons
less
advanced
to
economies that are investing tremendously in high-speed rail.
The implication is: if China can
afford to spend hundreds of billions of
dollars to create a national high-speed
rail network, why can't we? Here again,
I'm willing to give the American government some slack. After all, the
Chinese government has, let's just say,
fewer bureaucratic obstacles to deal
with when deciding to build such railways and to gather the money for it
thanAmerican lawmakers do.
So far so good then. It's understandable why America hasn't yet invested
much in high-speed rail. But right now,
when the American economy is still
doing poorly and when the unemployment rate still hovers around 9 percent,
it is an excellent time for the Obama
administration to push to invest in fast
trains, despite near-certain Republican
opposition.
If you're not convinced that America
needs high-speed rail in at least the
major economic "corridors" across the
nation, let me briefly go over the main
benefits. If you've ever flown with a
non-American airline, you're likely to
agree that American airlines are stingy
and not very friendly.
They could use some competition
from fast inter-city trains. Trains are
more comfortable for passengers, who
can more easily work or relax compared
to the crowded seats in an airplane.
Passengers who would normally take
the car now don't have to worry about
parking it in an expensive parking lot
in the city and can arrive refreshed
rather than tired from a long drive. Of
course, there are also the environmental benefits such as noise reduction and
lower C0 2-emissions. All in all, it's a
good deal.
There is, I think, some difference in
attitude toward public transportation
between Americans and Europeans.
While I don't have numbers, it's safe to
say that Americans love their cars more
than Europeans do.
So there tends to be somewhat more
support for public transportation in

the

most, if not all, European countries
than in the United States.
But let's not pretend that Europeans

Never put deer cull or killing 'to rest'
To the Editor:
I want to respond to the Phoenix
editorial "Deer cull most effective,
humane way to preserve Crum"
(11/4/10).
As a vegetarian for ethical reasons,
I'm offended by your cartoon. If the
deer in Crum could talk I'm sure they
would be saying something like "F--k
Y-u." It's not a joke that we are killing

deer.

The last paragraph in your editorial says that we believe this issue (of
killing deer in Crum) can be put to

rest.
Should killing ever be put to rest?
We should continue to have open
forums and discussions.

Your environmental concern is for

other organisms and habitats and how
deer negatively impact them. How

mmm

about how we as humans negatively
impact deer and other organisms &
habitats? By more building and building and pushing and pushing...how
about the negativity of that?
Let's not blame the deer for Lyme
disease. When deer are scarce, ticks
don't necessarily become scarce,
because they have alternative hosts.
Several recent studies (e.g. Jordan &
Schultz, 2005; Ostfeld et al., 2006;
Jordan et al., 2007) on mainland sites
in New York and New Jersey found no
correlation between deer and ticks.
Ticks are only dangerous if they are
infected, and deer play no role in
infecting ticks. Ticks become infected
by feeding on small mammals like
mice and chipmunks.

attempting

recruitment strategies.
These have included bribes of ice

during intermissions and even flat out
lying to students that the election

could enjoy the game.
Yet alas, these efforts have only
yielded marginal results. It has

because they are unsure of proper fanbehavior and thus are embarrassed to

One of the best things about being a

your favorite player or make fun of
them with your friends when they do
stupid things like dye their beard black

include at least one SF Giants reference).
Being part of this community means
you can walk up to a complete stranger

RECORDS AND MILESTONES

MEN'S SOCCER

Don't: Get too creative with the names
on the back.
There is a running series of posts on
the Yahoo sports blog Puck Daddy that
documents the worst "jersey fouls," or
fashion faux paus such as putting
"Givemebrewski" or "Candy Ass" on
the back of a jersey.
Some say all publicity is good publicity, but getting your picture immortalized on one of these posts will certainly direct some laughs in your direction from the hockey community. And
no, no matter what your mother says,
they are not laughing with you.
Do: Enjoy the irony of a sport that punishes fighting while allowing, if not
encouraging, it to continue.
Shockingly, the five-minute penalty
for fighting just does not seem to curb
its prevalence in the NHL. Perhaps it's
because it doesn't cause your team to
be shorthanded and referees only
break up the fights when they are practically over. Just a guess.
But the irony really only makes a
good thing better.
Don't: Try this at home.
It may look like fun, but I would
highly discourage you from dropping
the gloves with the next person who
accidentally bumps into you while
waiting in line at the grocery store. I'm
pretty sure the police have better disincentives for pummeling people you
don't like thanreferees do.
Now that you know the basic Dos
and Don'ts, you really have no excuse
for not tuning into the next game. Even
if you have never seen a game before,
being a hockey fan is too much fun to
miss out on.
So grab your face paint and your
favorite team's colors; there is no don't

The Swarthmore Garnet men's and

women's swim teams have kicked off their
2010-11 seasons with success, giving them
plenty of reason for optimism. The men
currently sit at 2-0, with a 1-0 Centennial
Conference record after easily defeating
both Widener in last Wednesday's season
opener and McDaniel in Saturday's
Centennial opener. The women struggled
against Widener, despite several strong
individual performances, but put on a
show against the Green Terror, defeating
the Centennial rival by a score of 131-73.
On both sides, performances by distance freestyle swimmers and first-years
seem to be of early note, with veterans
taking strides and newcomers making the
conference aware of their presence. For
the men, the distance races thus far have
been dominated by Josh Satre 'l3. Satre,
who specializes in the 500, 1000, and mile,
has notched wins in the 1000 against both
Widener and McDaniel and also pulled off
a 500 victory in the Widener meet.
When asked of his approach to these
events, Satre said, "The key to success for
going
me is negative splitting my race
out hard but coming back even faster in
the second half. I enjoy holding a solid
interval for a long period of time, and thus
distance was a good fit for me. It's not
about how fast you can swim, it's about
how long you can swim and still hold a
certain pace."
He also notes the strength of the Garnet
distance program. "[l'd like to] see

Swarthmore dominate the distance events
which is perfectly feasible between
Jake Benveniste, Tyler Hanson, Brian
Nadel and myself."
Indeed, even beyond Satre's performances the Garnet men have been dominant in distance events in the early going
this year, with Hanson, Benveniste,
Nadel, John Flaherty 14 and Peter Ballen
'l4 all putting up points in the 500 or 1000.
Hanson finished second to Satre in both
races against Widener and won the 500 on
...

Saturday.
For the women, senior Sasa Bedolfe
has put up some surprising numbers in
long distance events so far. She took second in the 1000 on Wednesday with a time
of 11:2418, more than twenty seconds
faster than her personal best from the
2009-10 season. She finished second in the
500, and followed up that performance
with wins in both distances on Saturday.
"I am definitely much faster right now
than I usually would be at this time of
year," she said. "My times have been a
very pleasant surprise."
Bedolfe doesn't know where this early
success is coming from, but she isn't complaining. "I haven't been able to attribute
my improvement to any particular cause,
but it is definitely motivating me to set
higher goals for myself than in years past
and to work harder to achieve those,
which is a really exciting prospect for me
in my senior season," Bedolfe added.
Senior captain Allison Bishop also
scored points for the Garnet in both distance events at both meets. She and
Bedolfe will be expected to anchor these
races for the Garnet this year, and, if early
results are any indication, both swimmers
will be dangerous in conference matchups
throughout the year.

As for the class of 2014, both the men
and the women performed extremely well
last week and are beginning to prove that
they can provide more than depth for this
year's team. Flaherty, in addition to his
second place finish in the 500 on Saturday,
won the 200 IM, which he says is more of

November 11, 2010

a comfort-zone event for him
"In high school my best events were
the IM, butterfly and backstroke,"
Flaherty said. "[Hopefully] the distance
free was more of a one-time thing. It was
really hard," he added with a laugh. Hard
or not, his performance in the distance
event only further proves his versatility,
which could become a powerful weapon
for the Garnet as the season progresses.
Fellow first-year Cyrus Nasseri also
posted a win in the McDaniel meet. He
swam the 100 backstroke in 1:00.45, touching out his opponent by a mere 2/100ths of
a second. However, he does not claim the
event as his, saying, "My butterfly is significantly faster [than my backstroke]. My
best event is the 100 fly, followed by the 200
fly and then the 100 back." Nasseri did not
compete in butterfly events in either
meet, but he should eventually join sophomores Charlie Hepper and Daniel
Duncan, both of whom won butterfly
races last week, to form a strong core in
the stroke.
Erin Lowe and Becky Teng highlighted
the first-years on the womens' side, with
Lowe winning the 200 fly on Wednesday
and the 100 and 200 free or* Saturday and
Teng taking first in jhe 200 IM against
Widener and the 50 free against McDaniel.
Both women also contributed to winning
relay teams and placed well in several
other events.
"It's definitely encouraging that I've
been doing well this season, and I'm glad
I've been able to help out with the team
score," Lowe said. "I'm coming off a period during which I haven't dropped much
if any time in any of my individual events,
[but] swimming for Swarthmore has
renewed my motivation, mainly because
I'm enjoying it a lot more than I have in
the past."
The transitionfrom high school to college competition hasn't appeared to faze
many of the new swimmers. "The transition
hasn't been too hard," Nasseri
said. He says that a rigorous practice
schedule in high school prepared him for
the workload, but that "the practices [at
Swarthmore] are actually much harder
than I expected they would be."
Flaherty says that he, too, was well-prepared by his high school training, assessing himself as "somewhat prepared for the
higher-level collegiate practices." He adds
that there are some differences, but these
are mostly adjustments of attitude.
"[Here], it's up to the swimmer to
improve," he commented. "My high
school coach would yell and scream to get
us to work but here you have to want it
or it won't happen."
Another theme among the swimming
class of 2014 is how much they enjoy the
team cohesion and camaraderie that they
have found in their new environment.
"The team aspect
makes meets, and
everything else, a lot more fun," Lowe
said. "I love everyone on the team and getting to hang out with them is awesome."
Flaherty echoes her glowing report, saying of his new teammates, "They're the
best."
Swarthmore takes to the water again
on Saturday, this time in a face-off against
Franklin & Marshall at Ware Pool. This is
a marquee matchup on the men's side as
the Diplomats were all that stood between
the Garnet and a Conference championship last year. Franklin Marshall also
claimed victory in the women's meet, and
the Garnet women are excited for a
chance to take on the champions.
"We've been looking forward to this
rivalry meet for weeks," Bedolfe said.
"We are physically and mentally ready to
take them on." Action will begin at 2 p.m.

'

What made his story so remarkable is
that these weren't questions that no one
had ever answered. No, these were questions no one had ever asked, questions
about things that had become too widely
accepted for anyone to wonder whether
they were actually true. Things like the
old saying that "baseball is 90 percent
pitching," wnich sounds completely
ridiculous when we hear it today, since
what it really means is that when you
subtract the importance of things like
defense and baserunning, the skill of
hitting a baseball is supposed to account
for about 6 to 7 percent of a team's success.
Well, believe it or not, Bill was the
first person to laugh at the absurdity of
that idea, and so he set about proving,
one piece at a time, that he was right to
laugh. Then he began looking at other
assumptions people never questioned,
then he began publishing those Baseball
Abstract factbooks once a year, and
from there it was pretty much a straight
line to him proclaiming, "I made baseball as much fun as doing your taxes!"
last month on The Simpsons.
It was this whole idea that made me
start thinking about the oldest assumption there is: that defense beats offense.
Is it true? Sure, it might be, but how
could the argument just stop there? Do
the teams with the best pitching always
do better than the ones who can hit? Are
the great defensive football teams guaranteed to win more games than the ones
who score at will?
What I ended up doing was looking at
the four major American sports leagues:
The MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL, measuring the combined winning percentage of
the elite offensive teams (the top 10 in
scoring) against that of the elite defensive teams (the top 10 in preventing
scoring).

To chart the progress over the past
decade, I looked at the results for each of
the past 10 years (nine for the NHL,
because of the strike) and then added up
the totals for the entire decade. I also
looked at each league's champions of the
past decade and saw how their rank in
offense compared to the rest of league
matched up against their defensive
rank.
Here is how the last ten years have
gone in the NBA, with the offenses
ranked according to Points Scored per
game, and defenses by Points Allowed:

Looking at baseball was a little more
complicated, as I ended up creating sep-

arate lists for the best 5 American
League teams and the best 5 National
League teams, switching in pitching for
defense. With apologies to the San

Francisco Giants, my list looked at the

Unbelievable, right? Let me add
another level to this: After compiling
the decade win-loss totals for each side,
the record for the top ten offenses
turned out to be 1042-555. The record for
the top 10 defenses? 1043-555. Over ten
years, that's the difference of a field goal
clanking off the uprights, a dropped
pass in the end zone, a stop on fourthand-inches, or about three thousand
other difference-makers that are practically negligible in a single game, let
alone a decade.
Then I thought of something else: The
2008 Eagles ranked in the top ten in
points per game. Remember the game
against the Bengals that year when it
ended in a tie because Donovan McNabb
didn't know the rules? There's your difference from the past ten years.
Unbelievable.

Defense once again holds a slight
advantage (not that slight) over offense.

While, on the surface, it looks like some
defensively brutal teams ended up winning Super Bowls, clubs like the 'O7
Giants and 'O9 Saints proved that it was
possible to succeed with defenses that,
while not holistically great, were gifted
in specific areas, as the Giants were
with rushing the passer and the Saints
were with creating turnovers.
Inspired by Bill James, I dared to
challenge the notion that defense won
more games than offense. What did I
find? That defense wins more games
than offense. For the past decade, anyway. In baseball. And basketball. And
hockey. And (barely) football. All the
same, I'm glad I asked the question
instead of simply assuming it to be true.
Even though it did turn out to be true.
For all four sports.

Volleyball upsets Haverford to reach CC finals
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
Passion has a funny way of trumping

logic.

It was match point. Haverford, up two
sets to one, was just one point from defeating the Swarthmore Garnet volleyball
team again and moving on to the
Centennial Conference finals in search of
their fifth consecutive Centennial championship.
No. 4 Swarthmore entered the conference semifinal coming off of a first-round
victory over the Gettysburg Bullets, the

second time that the Garnet defeated the
Bullets this season. Swarthmore had
dropped a four set match to the Fords only
10 days before.
Haverford had won 21 of 22 matches
against' Swarthmore since 1996 before
Saturday when the two teams met for the
second consecutive year in the Centennial
Conference semifinals. In 2009, the Fords
won in four sets with the Garnet taking a
set for the first time since 2005.
"Coming off the loss to Haverford the
week before, we had the right fuel to get
the fire going for this match," Sarah
Lambert 'll said. "The match had more on
the line that just another win or making it
to the finals. It was redemption. It was the
rivalry. It was the chance to let our conference know who we are."
Match point. Dig Hillary Santana 'l2,
set Allie Coleman 'l3, kill Kat
Montemurro 'l3. Even at 24 in the fourth
set.

Four points later, thanks to two more
Montemurro kills, Swarthmore had tied
the match at two sets a piece with a 27-25
set-win, forcing a tiebreaking fifth set.
After going down 6-4 in the fifth set, it
was all Swarthmore as the Garnet went on
a 11-2 run to dethrone the Fords on their
home floor and completing the upset of the
fall in the Centennial Conference.
"When playing Haverford, there's
always the added intensity due to our
rivalry so it made the victory that much
sweeter knowing we knocked the defending champs out of the tournament in the
semis, in their gym and in front of their
crowd. It felt unbelievable and was definitely the biggest win of my career thus
far," said Montemurro.
The win against Haverford was several
years in the making and part of the development of the volleyball program which
has improved from six wins in 2008 to 19
wins in 2009 and 20 in 2010. With the development of the team in the past two years,
the players could feel the momentum in
the rivalry starting to swing in their favor.
In the regular season matchup
between the two teams last year, which
Haverford took in three sets, the team
found itself sitting on its heels, waiting for
plays to happen rather than attacking the
Fords. When the team took a set in the
semifinals last year, "it set the standard
that Haverford was not invincible," said
Sarah Lambert 'll, who was knocked out
of last year's regular season match by a
vicious ankle sprain.
And so, on Saturday, the Garnet came
out and attacked with fire, taking the first
set 25-20. But the Fords responded, winning the next two sets 25-17 and 25-20
before Swarthmore won the final two to
take the match. The Garnet became just
the second team in the history of the
Centennial Conference playoffs to come
from behind two sets to one to win a
match.
"To finally beat Haverford, in their
gym, in the playoffs, it's very hard to put
into words what that meant to myself and
niy team," said Lambert, Swarthmore's

lone senior, who dropped two aces and
added nine digs for the Garnet in the semifinal win.
"There hasn't been a single thing that
we've done so far that was better than
Saturday. The gym felt like it was ours.
The fact that it was during conference
semifinals was a large added bonus,"
Lambert added.
Danielle Sullivan 'l4 artd Montemurro
led the Garnet against the Fords with 12
kills apiece while Genny Pezzola 'l2 added
1L Pezzolla was also one of three Garnet
players with double-digit digs as she posted 12 with Santana coming up with 20 and
Sullivan adding 10.
"We weren't just playing with them
this time. We made them keep up with us,"
Montemurro said.
In the Centennial Conference championship game on Sunday against the
Franklin & Marshall Diplomats, the
Garnet dropped three close sets 25-18,
25-22, 25-22 to finish second in the conference. Down 22-16 in the third set, the
Garnet rallied to tie the set at 22 behind
Lambert's serve before the Diplomats ran
off three points for the championship.
Coach Harleigh Chwastyk, the defending Centennial Conference Coach of the
Year, doesn't believe that there was any
letdown in play in Sunday's championship
match. "Saturday was physically taxing
and emotionally charged, and I think that
Franklin Marshall has a little bit more
depth than we do and they are the best
serving team in the conference and they
showed that too."
Entering the 2010 season, the team had
set goals for the year
to play as a team,
to play with heart, to beat Haverford and
to win the Centennial championship.
Though the team fell just short on the last
one, the composure, passion and positive
enthusiasm displayed by the team all year
indicates that this year's success is just a
harbinger of a bright future for the pro&

gram.
It was that composure and class that

shocked the Fords, who were able to bend
the Garnet will in the middle sets but
never break it as Swarthmore succeeded
back. "Fundamentals,
in roaring
Haverford may have that on us. Size, they
may have that on us too. Heart and passion, they don't even come close," Lambert
said.
Chwastyk urges her players to outwork
their opponents in every match.
"Outworking means that you have to be
extremely disciplined and you just need to
keep pushing, and being a good sport and
holding yourself to a higher standard can
take a lot out of you, so the focus and composure are key and we did that so well on
Saturday. We play a lot older than we really are."
Despite the defeat, the Garnet earned
the No. 2 seed in the Eastern College

Men's soccer wins 2010 Centennial Championship

On Sunday, surrounded by boisterous Garnet fans, the Swarthmore men's
soccer team announced its return to the
NCAA tournament with a classic chorus
of "Ole" after sophomore Kieran
Reichart's golden goal. Reichart's onetimer in the 106 th minute capped the
Garnet's second straight comeback victory and clinched Swarthmore's second
Centennial Conference championship in
three years.
The Centennial Conference tournament was held at Swarthmore, as it was
in 2008, when Swarthmore won its first
championship.
Centennial
soccer
During Saturday's two semifinal matchSunday's
Championship,
es and
Clothier Field witnessed 306 minutes of
suspenseful soccer, with 1544 fans, four
overtimes, a round of penalty kicks, and
even a couple tears.
"In my lifetime, I had never cried
with joy until [Sunday] night" admitted
head coach Eric Wagner. The win was
extra special for Wagner because his
parents Richard and Lois were in attendance for the first time since
Swarthmore's game against Amherst in
the third round of the 2008 NCAA tournament. The Garnet lost that game in
heart-breaking fashion but have not lost
at home since-a streak of 25 games.
The home unbeaten streak was in
jeopardy Saturday night in the semifinal match against Johns Hopkins, but
the Garnet advanced thanks to a late
goal by senior Philippe Celestin and a
spectacular penalty kick win.
In
championship
"-against
Sunday's
Muhlenberg, Swarthmore fell behind
once again in the first half. This time,
Micah Rose 'l2 came to the rescue with a
goal on a penalty kick setting the stage

for Reichart's overtime heroics.
The Garnet has gone down 1-0 only
to tie the match at one in five straight
playoff contests. Swarthmore has won
four of those five, the only defeat coming
in the Sweet 16 of last year's NCAA
penalties
Tournament
to
in
Transylvania.
On Saturday, Swarthmore's senior
captain Gage Newman, battling knee
and ankle injuries, was ruled out during
warmups before the Hopkins game.
Next man up: Toby Heavenrich 'l2. In
his first career start, Heavenrich filled
admirably,
anchoring
the
in
Swarthmore defense for 87 minutes on
an injured ankle of his own. According
to Newman, Ayman Abunimer 'l2 christened Toby, 'Ludwig Van Heavenrich,'
because he is so composed in the back."
Despite the efforts of Heavenrich and
the rest of the Garnet defense, Hopkins

struck first. In the 37th minute, theBlue

Jays' Scott Bukoski found the far post
off a Kevin Hueber cross to take the half-

time lead.
The Garnet burst out of the gates,
outshooting the Blue Jays 9-2 in the second half. In the 74th minute, Garnet
senior Philippe Celestin 'll delivered
some of his trademarked November
magic.

After a Hopkins foul near midfield,
Fabian Castro 'l2 drove the free kick
deep into the Hopkins box. Rose elevated above the crowd to win possession for
the Garnet. After a few bounces,
Celestin found the ball under pressure
and at hip-height drilled a rocket over
the head of Hopkins' goalkeeper Ravi
Gill.

The Swarthmore men's soccer team celebrates after winning the 2010 Centennial Conference Championship over Muhlenberg. The Garnet
advances to the 2010 NCAA Division 111 Tournament and will open play at 5 p.m. Saturday vs. DeSales on Clothier Field.
It was Celestin's third career goal
and first since sending the Garnet into
the Sweet 16 of last year's 2009 NCAA
Tournament with an overtime goal
against Hobart. "We have a lot of people
who can get the ball in the back of the
net, so I tend to focus on other things,
but it's nice to know that when the team
needs me, I can still score," Celestin
said.
After two scoreless overtimes in
which Hopkins outshot Swarthmore 5-2,
the teams went into penalty kicks. The
Garnet was convinced that the result
would be different than in the game
against Transylvania.
"Shootouts are nerve-racking, but we
train for them almost every practice and

we were pretty confident. D'Annunzio
is a beast [at defending penalty kicks].
There's no way any team can score five
against him," Newman said.
Rose took the first Garnet kick and
was stopped by the Hopkins keeper, to
the shock ofRose's father who had never
seen the junior miss a penalty. Hopkins
quickly responded to go up 1-0.

After successful kicks from Reichert
and David Sterngold 'l2, Hopkins senior
Scott Bukoski, who has the most goals in
Centennial Conference Tournament history, blasted a shot over the cross bar.
With the kicks level at two, Roberto
Contreras IV 'l2 found the back of the
net and D'Annunzio made a sprawling
save to his right on Hopkins' Danny
Reategui. Up stepped Castro, who, having been stopped on a penalty against
Franklin & Marshall earlier this season,
calmly drilled the netting as the Garnet
advanced past Hopkins.
When Muhlenberg and Swarthmore
met in Sunday's championship, the
Mules sought their sixth Centennial
title, the Garnet their second.
Once again, Swarthmore fell behind
early. In the 29th minute, the Mules'
Mike Williams drilled a ball over the
head of D'Annunzio, stunning the
Garnet and the home crowd.
Repeating their second half surge
from the Hopkins victory, the Garnet
fired 18 shots to Muhlenberg's 7 after the
break. Said Wagner, "That second half

was all heart and character to be able to
dominate [like that]. We never panicked
and that's the mark of a mentally tough

team."
The gutsy work of the Garnet defense
was integral to the second half dominance. Led by the return of Newman,
the Garnet limited Muhlenberg's star
midfielder Cody Antonini to shots from
distance and from poor angles.
Another key was the determined support of the home crowd. Said Celestin,
"I don't know if we could have fought
back without the crowd. The adrenaline
and motivation our fans provide is irreplaceable."

Late in the second half, the relentless
Garnet attack finally broke through.
Henry Ainley 'l2 came off the bench and
pestered the Muhlenberg defense, dribbling and controlling the ball deep in the
Mules' zone. In the 75th minute, Ainley
drew a hard tackle in the box, winning a
penalty for the Garnet.
The Garnet went back to Rose.
Despite the miss the night before,
Wagner never questioned the decision to
pick the junior. "There's a reason he's a
captain, there's a reason his teammates
voted him team MVP as a sophomore,
there's a reason he didn't come out of
the game all weekend. Micah Rose is an
absolute force of nature." The captain
calmly tucked the penalty inside the left
post, knotting the score at 1-L
The Garnet kept the pressure on in
the first overtime, nearly ending the
game as Morgan Langley' 11 buried a
ball off a corner one second after the
horn. "I knew the game was ours after
[Langley's near-goal]. I could see it in
one [Muhlenberg] defender's face. His
hands were on his head and his face was
white," said Celestin.
Six minutes into the second overtime, the Garnet found the game-winner.
A Muhlenberg foul gave the Garnet a
free kick in a position similar to the one
that set up the Celestin goal.
Another beautiful Castro service
found a skying Newman just outside the
6-yard box. Captain Newman headed it
out of the pack to a streaking Reichert,
who etched his name in the Centennial

November 11, 2010

history books with just the second golden goal in a final in Centennial
Conference history.

With the win, the Garnet automati-

cally qualified for the NCAA tournament.
Once again, Swarthmore will
host the first two rounds, earning the
ever-important home-field advantage.

"We're home in November, I love it,"
remarked an elated Wagner.
Swarthmore was able to win its two
matches this weekend without a single
point from Langley, who is first in
Division 111 in assists and fourth in total
points.

On Tuesday, Langley was named the
Centennial Conference Player of the
Year.

"I could never have imagined being
Player of the Year when I came in as a
freshman," Langley said. It is an honor
to be Swarthmore's first of many and to
be voted Player of the Year by my [opponents].
"To have our leading scorer, a senior
who has helped lead this team to the
Centennial Conference Championship
and into the NCAA Tournament for the
third straight year, recognized by the
Conference like this is a testament to the
quality of this program," Wagner said.
"Morgan is a top-level college soccer
player, a stellar performer, and has been
the most dangerous player in the conference all season. He deserves this award
and we are all extremely proud and
excited for him," Wagner added.
Castro and Rose were also named
first team All-Centennial while defenders Newman and Pierre Dyer 'l2 were
named to the second team.
The Garnet returns to action in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament,
hosting DeSales Saturday at 5 p.m.
The matchup of Rochester and
Medaille will follow at 7:30. The winners will square off Sunday at 6 p.m
from Clothier Field.
When asked what he knew about
Swarthmore's opponent, Celestin calmly
answered, "What we know about
Desales is what we know about any team
we face at this point. If we lose to them,
its over, and that's all we need to know."
