Survey shows majority support
Last week, Student Council sent out a
campus-wide e-mail with a link to a survey
concerning the possibility of longer hours at
McCabe. A total of 627 people participated in
the survey and 72.7 percent indicated that
they would use McCabe Sunday through
Thursday if it were open later. 42.7 percent
were in favor of McCabe staying open to 2
a.m., making it the most preferred closing

time.
Student Council had been receiving
requests for longer hours at McCabe and
decided in conjunction with the administration to conduct a campus survey in order to
determine a rough estimate of the level of
students' interest in extending library
hours.
"The Deans just wanted to be sure that
this wasn't just something that a few students would be interested in," Student
Council President Peter Gardner 'OB said.
However, Student Council members are
still unsure as to if and when new hours
could be put in place."We would love it if
something could get in motion this semester," Student Council Campus Life Advisor
Alyssa Work 'OB said.
Now that Student Council has the results
of the survey, which indicate a strong stu-

McCabe

dent interest in extending McCabe's hours,
it will start working with the administration
to figure out the specific logistics and begin
the process towards accomplishing this

change.
"We have to schedule meetings with
Peggy Seiden, who [is] the head librarian,
Kai Campbell, Myrt Westphal and Jim
Larimore, and take the next steps," said

Student Council Secretary Meredith Firetog
10.
Some of the things Student Council must
discuss with the administration are the
additional costs, changing student worker
shifts and further energy use. "All the things
that have to change, we have to talk about
how much money it would cost, people who
would need to be working in the library, in
terms of student workers and changing
those shifts, how much energy is going to be

used," Firetog said.
Matt Thomas 10, a computer consultant
at McCabe, is unconcerned by the possibility of working more hours. "From a public
area consultant's point of view, more hours
to work [means] more pay which is nice,"
Thomas said. "That would give the students
who need a computer more time to stay up
and study, [and] a little more room to pro-

crastinate."

ming classes.

The Chester School of the Arts was
recently awarded a $500,000 challenge grant
from the Sunshine Lady Foundation Inc.,
which must be met in cash and pledges by
March 31, 2008. Currently in pre-operational
stages, the school plans to open its doors to
the Chester community in September 2008,
beginning with ninety students in pre-K
through first grade, adding a grade each
year up to the 12th grade.

I could see how happy
the children were

John Alston
Director of the Chester
Children's Chorus
"...

...

Associate professor of music and director
of the Chester Children's Chorus John
Alston is also the founder of the Chester
School of the Arts. Alston says this school is
a natural outgrowth of the Chester
Children's Chorus which he founded in 1993
to provide the children of Chester with a
positive musical and cultural opportunity
similar to the one he had as a child in the
Newark (NJ) Boys Chorus, where he experienced firsthand how music and a nurturing
environment can change lives.
From September through June the 75
members of the Chester Children's Chorus
come to Swarthmore's campus twice a week
after school and for sessions every weekday
during the five-week long Summer Learning
Program, which includes music, literature,

THE PHOENIX

"At summer camp, I could see how happy
the children were," Alston said. "They're
really little, and just like you they're perfectly wired to be extraordinary. Every year
their institutions fail them. I don't want
these kids to get a lousy education."
Swarthmore College Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l is the chairman of the
Board of Trustees for the Chester School of
the Arts. "We're evolving an idea about how
this school should be, but we're never
wavering from the fact that we want to start
a school of the arts with a rigorous academic curriculum," he said.
Currently, the Chester School of the Arts
board is developing a relationship with the
school district, and raising funds to match to
the grant. "There are a lot of preparations
before the school opens," Eldridge said.
While the board has already raised nearly half a million dollars for the school, it
must raise an additional $500,000 by Mar. 31,
2008 in order to receive the grant from the
Sunshine Lady Foundation. The foundation
is run by president and founder Dorothy
Buffet whose mission is "to invest in organizations and programs dedicated to providing opportunities for the advancement of
education, well being and new life choices
for disadvantaged people with special empathy for the working poor and families in crisis," according to its Web site.
"The Sunshine Lady Foundation grant is
really quite wonderful and serendipitous,"
Eldridge said. I think one of the people that
"

worked with that board in the Sunshine

Lady Foundation heard the chorus and
heard of John's interest in starting a school,
and things just went from there."
Assistant professor of education Diane
Anderson explained that the Chester Upland
School District is in a complicated state.
Superintendents tend not to stay for more
than one or two years. Additionally, a board

of control governs the district instead of the

typical local school board because problems
with funding and performance prompted the
state to take over the board's governance.
■ "Because of the changes in the board of
control over time and the changes in the
administration over time, the configuration
of schools in Chester changes fairly frequently and curriculum and instruction
varies frequently," Anderson said. "And
because of the [Pennsylvania System of

School Assessments], the schools are very
focused on reading, writing and mathematics, what are called basic skills."
According to the PSSA school performance level results for 2004-2005 year, 818 percent of the juniors at Chester High School
are belowbasic math levels, and 60.8 percent
are below basic reading levels. "There's a kid
from Chester High School in the program,
taking an honors English class. He played
Boggle for the first two weeks of class. He
hasn't read a book in English yet. He read a
Langston Hughes poem that he didn't understand. How can he compete?" Alston said.
The Chester Upland School district also
has one of the highest dropout rates in the
state. According to the Pennsylvania
Department of Education Department of
Data Services, Chester High School had a
12.7 percent dropout rate among 1679
enrolled students in the 2005-2006 academic
year. Less than three and a half miles away,
the Swarthmore-Wallingford school district
had 1288 students enrolled in Strath Haven
High School, and zero dropouts.
"I think that we will make a huge difference in the lives of the children that come to
[the Chester School of the Arts]," Eldridge
said. "There are many community members
engaged in the chorus that love the idea [of
this school]. Even if their own children are
too far along, they think it's great for those
who will benefit now and in the future."
Alston imagines the school to be a place
with lots of laughter, compassion and
respect. "There will be a degree of integration," Alston said. "I imagine the whole

October IX 2007

school at some point studying the Harlem
Renaissance. In music we'll be learning

something about Duke Ellington; they'll be
reading poetry and literature from that era,
building things and getting on a train going
up to New York and visiting Harlem."
Alston also recognizes the importance of
learning basic, essential skills. "They'll have
to master the nuts and bolts. They'll learn to
spell, master high usage words. They have to
know facts, like when World War II happened, and something about the revolutionary world. They have to know George
Washington was the first founding father to

free his slaves," Alston said.
Anderson said that she thought Alston's
plan for the Chester School of the Arts was a
fabulous one. "If John can build a school
that is a rich place to learn in every way

that doesn't just focus on reading, writing
and math, but that taps into children's interests in music and the arts, as well as provide
how
access and opportunities in the arts
can anyone argue with that," Anderson said.
Eldridge is the former Principal and
Director of the Duke Ellington High School
of the Arts in Washington, D.C. "I've had
first hand experience of seeing how an artscentered education transforms students
lives. I'm a believer in this approach,"
Eldridge said.
There is also potential for collaboration
between the Chester School of the Arts and
programs at Swarthmore. According to
Anderson, students enrolled in classes in the
Education department often observe various schools in the region as a component of
their study. "I personally would be very
happy to place [Swarthmore's Education]
students in the Chester School of the Arts,"
Anderson said. "It's an opportunity not just
for those kids there, but for kids here to
learn from a wonderful school."

For first time, RIAA successfully sues for file-sharing
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Information

BY SARAH PETERSON

spetersl@swarthmore.edu
Last week, the first illegal file-sharing

lawsuit to go to court was concluded. A federal jury in Duluth, Minnesota decided in
favor of the six record companies who had
filed the suit and ordered Jammie Thomas,
30, to pay a total of $222,000 in damages for 24
music files that she was found guilty of sharing through the peer-to-peer file-sharing program Kazaa.

This decision lends further

strength and significance to the recording
industry's crackdown on illegal file-sharing
the impact of which has even been felt
here at Swarthmore.
According to Ben Mazer 10, a member of
Free Culture, an on-campus movement promoting the freedom to distribute creative
works via media such as the Internet, this
issue largely reflects a "generation gap" in
which the older are not as sympathetic
towards the younger generation and have
different ideas of what is damaging to the

artist or how fans should support artists.
"This type of issue isn't just about the large
corporation vs. the individual but is really a
generational issue. The average adult
thinks file sharing is not only illegal but
morally [wrong], while most college students don't feel that way. This requires us to
be very vocal because we are not wrong,"
Mazer said. "People of our generation, col-

lege students and younger, support artists in
different ways than just buying CDs. We go
to concerts, create MySpace forums and use
in more pertechnology to support them
sonal ways."
...

"The question is, how
much of a gamble are you
willing to take that you
won't get caught..."
Judy Downing
Director of ITS
Thousands of suits such as this one have
been brought against individuals across the
country, and college students
including
Swarthmore students
comprise a large
population of the individuals accused.
According to an Inside Higher Ed article
provided by the Recording Industry
Association of America's communications
office, "A recent survey by Student Monitor
from spring 2006 found that more than half
of college students download music and
movies illegally, and according to the market research firm NPD, college students
alone accounted for more than 13billion illegal music downloads in 2006."
Because of these large figures, the recording industry has elected to focus in particular on college campuses to crack down on
file-sharing.
The RIA'A describes its
approach as collaborative, involving meeting personally with administrators and providing orientation videos and other educational materials. In the Inside Higher Ed
article, they describe the suits against "indi-

vidual file-traffickers" as a last resort.
In a recent press release, the RIAA,
which acts on behalf of many major record
companies, announced that in the course of
a week it had sent 403 "pre-litigation letters"
portending possible lawsuits to 22 universities around the country. According to the
press release, "The letters reflect evidence
suggesting abuse of campus computer networks for the purpose of copyright infringement."

Director Judy Downing oversees much of
the paperwork that the recording industry
and entertainment studios send to the college regarding copyright infringement.
When a student is found to have violated
copyright, the record companies' representatives send a letter to the college or university. At this point in the process, the RIAA
has no information identifying the student,
except for the IP address. ITS, however, can
identify the student and forwards the pre1

settlement letter onto the student. Last
semester, two Swarthmore students
received such letters. Downing said that
there haven't been any letters since then.
The next stage in the process is what
Downing identifies as an 'fearly settlement
letter," which provides the student with the
opportunity to settle rather than go to court.
The RIAA has established a website,
www.p2plawsuits.com, where individuals
accused of infringement can settle the
claims. So far, only one of the two
Swarthmore students contacted has
received an early settlement letter. This student, who graduated in June, received the
letter from Downing, not directly from the
record companies. "As of this date, the college has never given a student's name to
anyone," Downing said. Downing did not
know whether or not that student decided to
settle with the record companies or go to
court.

While Downing has heard that some
institutions—such as Gettsysburg College
and Franklin
Marshall College—are at
least considering altogether blocking the use
of the peer-to-peer programs through which
st illegal file-sharing takes place, she and ITS
are opposed to such measures. ."There could
be some very legitimate reasons for p2p,"
Downing said, citing situations in which
systems administrators might need to share
software and wouldn't be violating copyrights. Moreover, the burden of controlling
network usage does not rest on the administration. "We expect the community to be
really smart, and able to police themselves,"
&

Downing said. "We don't police."
While Downing does not keep track

ther dissemination. The notification of students getting caught illegal file-sharing has
become a significant task for Downing.
"We look at the internet as a communication tool and an educational tool and that's
why we put a lot of money into it. And yet,
students use it as an entertainment tool
...

Here's the head of ITS going around telling
students to take things down. That's a waste
of real high talent," Associate Dean for
Student Life Myrt Westphal said. Westphal
and Downing have spoken about the possibility of instituting a fine for copyright violations brought to ITS's attention by outside
companies.
"Other institutions charge
every time you get a take-down notice, and
we're pretty gentle about it," Westphal said.

At this point, the policy is that network
users must take down the file before a cer-

will have their network

access revoked. However, this can be and
usually is restored to the user. "I think the
dean's office needs to fine on their second or
third offense," Downing said. "Many of the
students have received multiple notices."
"I'm perfectly happy with charging," said
Westphal. "This is a task that requires some-

a quarter of the way through the year. Filesharing and its risks were a major topic of
discussion before the beginning of the school
year
both in RA training and in the firstyears' computer use session during
Orientation Week. Incoming students were
apprised of what had happened to the two
students last year contacted by the RIAA,
and whatthe consequences of those notifications could amount to.
"A handful ofkids were asking questions,
everyone seemed to be a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and
one really
knew if what they were doing was okay or
not," said Valerie Clark 11, who attended the
computing session. Students asked questions about what methods ofcommunication
were acceptable "[File-sharing] was definitely a big part of the culture before we got
here, and a lot of people I know stopped as a
result of that talk."lnstead, Clark's hallmates and friends take advantage of other
resources, such as being able to stream each
others' iTunes libraries through the college
network and listening to albums in each
other's rooms. "It's drawn out that social
aspect of listening to music again," Clark
said.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Final decision on deer left to December Board meeting
The Crum deer can breathe easy until

winter) when theBoard of Managers and
other committees reconvene to consider
the best way to address the deer overpopulation problem in the Crum.

Research has shown that the whitetailed deer population of the Crum has
reached a level that threatens the wood's
ecological well-being as well as the health
of the Swarthmore community.
In its deer management report available on the college's Web site, Natural
Resource Consultants Inc. suggested,
"hiring a sharpshooter to humanely euthanize deer
in order to protect and
restore the structure, diversity and function ofCrum Woods." The option was listed as recommended" in theheader to the
euthanasia sub-section.
"I am persuaded that both for the
health of the woods and the health of the
deer herds, culling is necessary," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said.
Eldridge said in an e-mail that no
definitive decision was made during the
most recent Board of Managers' meeting.
Working in collaboration, the Board of
Managers, the administration, the Crum
Woods Stewardship Committee, the
Committee of Social Responsibility and
the Property Committee of the Board are
considering all possible plans of action
while weighing the effects of the repercussions on the aesthetics of the woods
and the local and college communities, as
well as the ethics of the decision.
Since the Crum Woods lies within the
jurisdiction
of the Borough of
Swarthmore and the Nether Providence,
the community outside of the college, too,
must be consulted in the decision-making
process. "The municipalities must apply
for two things: [aj waiver on the ban to
fire guns in their jurisdiction and a permit to kill deer in the jurisdiction,"
Eldridge said.
However, Crum Woods Stewardship
Committee member Nick Buttino 'O9 said
thattheroot ofthe Cram's problem is not
decisively linked to the deer. "We don't
have enough data on how individual
...

of

how many network users use file-sharing
programs, she does keep track ofhow many
notifications of copyright violations the college receives, some of which also apply to
downloaded television shows. These are different from pre-litigation notices since they
only ask that Downing make sure that the
offending individual remove the file from
their hard drive, thereby preventing its fur-

tain date or they

body else to do something that's really not
productive for the college. It wouldn't bother me to have a large fine. I don't think we
can legislate against a tidal wave. But when
it impinges on us or takes up somebody's
time or causes us to have more bandwidth
then people who misuse it should pay."
Fines may help to discourage students
from illegal file-sharing, since already knowing about the ethical and legal downsides to
file-sharing has not proven a sufficient
deterrent. "There's stuff on the ITS Web site,
and there's stuff out there in the world it's
hard to believe today that we would have
students who do not know that it's illegal,"
Downing said. "The question is, how much
of a gamble are you willing to take that you
won't get caught... If there's a positive at all
about this poor lady [Thomas] being sued,
it's probably that 'See? We've been telling
the truth. It can happen.'"
The number of copyright violations that
Swarthmore has received this year is down,
however
the lowest it's been in a number
of years, Downing said. Moreover, while
over the past year the three returning classes have each incurred around 30 violations,
the class of 2011 has not brought in any violation notifications
despite already being

seedlings are doing over time
fieldwork is a messy business," Birttino said.
Additionally, Buttino said that the Crum
is fragmented due to trails and suburbanization, rendering scientific research on
the health of the woods difficult.
"People are experimenting with deer
contraception, but those work in very
closed situations," Buttino said. This
option entails placing salt laced with
chemicals in thewoods for the deer. Once
ingested, the salt would hopefully reduce
the fertility of the deer. However, the college does not currently have the capability to execute suah a plan. Buttino said
that fencing off the deer is also an unfeasible option.
"As suburbanization rose, the woods
became more and more fragmented
and we've taken out [the deer's] natural
predators," Buttino said of the gradual

...

overpopulation.

Student Council is involved in the
talks over the deer problem in a peripheral sense. "Our role is to make sure [the
process] goes forward with full transparency," Student Council President
Peter Gardner 'OB said. Gardner wants to
make sure that students concerned with
the loss of life have a say in the ultimate
decision. Gardner and Student Council
Vice President SamAsarnow 'OB also stated that students with concerns about the
deer shoujd come to student council
meetings to voice their opinions. "It is
heartening that [all parties] are having
this conversation so far in advance,"
Asarnow said. ;
If the deer are, in fact, culled, all valuable parts of the deer will be utilized to
avoid wasting the carcasses. According to
Arboretum Coordinator of Horticulture
Jeff Jabco, the Pennsylvania Game
Commission requires all culled deer to be
butchered. The meat must thenbe donated to charity. Due to this stipulation,
"there will be no venison Wednesdays in
Sharpies," Asarnow said. Other deer
parts, such as the hide, may also be used
to further prevent wastage.

Physics professor recieves prestigious award
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY RAMYA GOPAL

rgopall@swarthmore.edu
Professor Michael R.

Brown in the

Physics department was recently awarded
the 2008 Prize for a Faculty Member for
Research in an Undergraduate Institution
by the American Physical Society "for his
outstanding contributions to plasma
physics made possible by his development
of a world-class spheromak laboratory at
Swarthmore College, and for his energetic
mentoring of undergraduate students,"
according to the APS Web site. The prize
consists of a $5,000 stipend and an addi-

tional $5,000 unrestricted grant for the
research to the recipient's institution, in
this case, Swarthmore.
The American Physical Society is one of
the largest organizations in the field of
physics with over 40,000 members. This
award was created in 1986 to "to honor a
physicist whose research in an undergraduate setting has achieved wide recognition
and contributed significantly to physics
and who has contributed substantially to
the professional development of under-

graduate physics students," according to
the American Physical Society's Web site.
Another current Swarthmore physicist,
Professor Peter Collings, received the
award in 1994 for work on liquid crystals.

In the spheromak laboratory, which
deals with the study of magnetic fusion
energy concepts, Brown has been replicating and studying the processes that occur
in the corona of the sun. "The idea is to
reproduce conditions or processes that
happen in space and [study] the ways magnetic fields can be used to hold hot gas,
called plasma, for a fusion energy source,"
Brown said.
The laboratory has facilitated plasma
physics research for the past ten years
since Brown started at Swarthmore. The
lab was created based on "an idea that I had
that I thought could be implemented at a
small college like Swarthmore. I found that
I didn't need the large scale infrastructure
at a research university like Princeton or
University of Wisconsin," Brown said, citing universities that have similarresearch
programs and facilities in plasma physics.
Brown, who recieved his Bachelor
degree in Physics at Pomona College and
his PH.D in Plasma Physics at Dartmouth
College, first became interested in this type
of research in high school and college. "I
was interested in doing research to address
a need. The universe runs on nuclear
fusion energy, that's where energy comes
from in the universe. [I want to] bring a
star to the earth, in a lab, to have safe,
clean, plentiful energy."

The other aspect of Brown's research
includes his collaboration with students
each summer.
"During the academic year, from
September to May, we focus on teaching in
class and the seminar room. From May to
September, our focus is research with students. This is a unique feature of
Swarthmore: Both excellence in teaching
and research is valued," Brown said.
Over the past ten years, sixteen Honors
Physics students and another twenty other
students have worked with Brown over the
summer.
While Brown appreciated the award as
recognition for the college and the department, he also considered it "great news for
the students."
"I couldn't have done it without the 16
honors students over the past decade. Each
has contributed a different piece. It's really
a tribute to their work," Brown said.
Anna Phillips 10 worked withBrown in
his lab this past summer. "I appreciated
[how] Professor Brown and Christopher
Cothran from Haverford went out of thenway to explain about experiments,"
Phillips said, describing the most valuable
part of her summer experience. "I was not
just learning about the specific experiment, but how experiments on this scale
work."

Participants in the workshop were encouraged to
use their voices and bodies creatively to resist war.

On Wednesday, Oct. 10, Swarthmore students had
the opportunity to attend the "People Power and
Strategic Organizing" workshop run by Aimee Allison
and David Solnit, co-authors of the book "Army of
None: Strategies to Counter Military Recruitment,
End War, and Build a Better World." The workshop
comes as part of the Army of None Project, which discusses the pervasiveness of the military recruitment
system in our society and among the youth. Rather
than just raise awareness, however, the workshop also
aimed to show students how they can use a variety of
resources and strategies to amplify their voices.
As soon as this year's Lang Visiting Professor,
George Lakey, found out that his old friend Solnit and
co-author Allison were to embark on a tour with their
book, he immediately invited them to come to
Swarthmore. "I really want Swat students to get the
best thinking that's available," he said. "[Solnit and
Allison] have a perspective that would be really help-

izations concerned with social justice, including
Amnesty International, Class Awareness Month,
Darfur Radio Project, and Swat Sudan, received emails detailing the content of the workshop. "I hadn't
realized it had been long that since we had a direct
action initiative," Associate Director for Student
Programs and Training Pat James said.
"The purpose of the workshop is to show students
how to focus their power," Lakey said. "It's mainly
about tools for thinking about change." According to
Lakey, who's attended one of Solnit's workshops in
California, Solnit particularly demonstrates how creativity can go a long way in gaining attention and
stimulating action. Another key idea is how to organize effectively, or as Lakey said: "How do you conceptualize a series of steps so they'll lead you wherever
you want to go?" The authors of the book have both
had extensive experience organizing and campaigning
for causes and promoting social justice. Allison, an
army veteran, is a leader in anti-recruitment movements and is a conscientious objector to the Gulf War.
Solnit is a social justice activist and an artist who
helped found Courage to Resist, an organization
"Supporting the troops that refuse to fight," as dis-

played on the logo.
Not surprisingly, many Swarthmore students support counter-recruitment movements and the idea of
questioning war. "I think that's the number one thing
that's important... I guess it really falls to us, doesn't
it?" Rachael Mansbach 'll said.
Gabriel Zacarias 'O9 who attended the workshop
said that he encountered a military recruiter on his
high school campus when he visited a former teacher
last year. "I asked [the recruiter] questions, but he didn't answer any of my questions satisfactorily,"
Zacarias said. "They don't tell you about how you will
kill another human being. It's very frightening."
Zacarias also spoke of how recruiters entice immigrants to enlist with promises of speeding along their
naturalization process. "The problem is very real,"
Zacarias said. Those wishing to gain insights into
counter-recruitment or the process of initiating social
change but weren't able to attend the workshop can
find the book "Army of None" either at the Lang
Center or at McCabe.

College fined for breaking federal laws
recently
released
A
Occupational
Safety
and
Health Administration report
concerning the investigation
into college employee Paul
Rodgers's death in the Science
Center last January due to
asphyxiation from acute nitrogen inhalation has concluded
that there is no evidence of
occupational hazards at the
college. Though Swarthmore
was ultimately determined to
be a secure workplace, the college was cited and fined $2,925
for not alerting an OSHA area
office of the accident within 8

of its occurrence,
according to Associate Vice
hours

President of Facilities and
Services Stu Hain.
"The law is that you must
call in to notify OSHA of a
fatality on the job," Hain said.
"It's a federal rule." According
to Hain, the college did not
inform OSHA of the accident
until the next day.
"My suspicion for {OSHA
necessitating this early notification is] they want to be sure
that they can get to the scene
of the accident so they can see
what happened
before anything is disturbed," Hain said.
"We closed the doors and
changed the locks. Except for
the EMTs, nobody from the
college touched the scene that
Friday night. But because
nobody called in the prescribed time, we violated the
rule and that's why we were
fined."
Though workplace conditions were found to be acceptable, there was a precaution
measure in the form of revised

...

procedures for handling nitrogen in the Chemistry department, in addition to their regular provision of safety training
in such procedures.
"The chemistry department has done safety training
with the students and faculty
as to handling liquid nitrogen
and nitrogen in general," Hain
said. "They were reviewing
how to handle liquid nitrogen
and revisited the procedures
and wrote some new ones for
the handling as a result of the

accident."
Another issue is safety
upon entering a confined
space. According to the OSHA
Web site, confined spaces are
"spaces that are considered
Confined' because their configuration[s] hinder the activities
of employees who must enter,
work in, and exit them."
Rodgers' body was found in a
Science Center storage room.
"Paul Rodgers was working
on how to teach people how
to enter a confined space,"
Hain said. "The training
would say [that] you wouldn't
go in the confined space without someone else outside. We
can't tell if [Rodgers] did that
or not."
"Once an employer has a
death, OSHA comes in to see if
there are good conditions, to
see if the employer is running

Vice President of Human

Arboretum continues effort to reach out and involve students
BY RAMYA GOPAL

rgopa!l@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore doubles as a natural museum and an academic institution. The mundane black plaques identifying every plant
and tree that students pass by every day are
a novelty to many visitors who take tours of
the various gardens around campus. The
Scott Arboretum has recently added new
features, such as cell phone tours, a createyour-own-tour kiosk and an in-depth "Walk
with the Curator" tour held once a month.
According to Rebecca Robert, Member and
Visitor Programs Coordinator, the main
focus has been "taking [education] to the
next level with technology." The Arboretum
has also made steps to include and involve
students more in their ongoing activities
throughout the school year.
The newly launched cell phone-based
audio tours were inspired by the self-guided
portable audio tours available at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. While the concept of these audio tours was appealing, the
director thought it would be impossible for
the arboretum to replicate. "We can't use
them because people could only rent them
when the office was open and it had to be
free. It also had to be easy for visitors to
find," Robert said. "Then we heard that cell
phones were doing this."
If visitors wanted to learn more about a
specific plant
limited to the ones with

accompanying the black
plaques
they can use their cell phones to
listen to a prerecorded audio lesson. The
Arboretum pays a company called Guide by
the Cell a flat rate of $2OO for 300 calls a
month, though users of the cell phone tours
must pay for the actual phone minutes they
use while listening to the audio lesson.
However, a web version comes for free.
Dedicated visitors can download the tours
onto their iPod for free through iTunes.
September's cell phone tour was made for
the Arboretum's annual plant sale and
blue stickers

included information about fifteen different
gardens and collections. The Arboretum will
be launching a new cell phone tour this
month.

Despite the advanced technology being
implemented, the Arboretum maintains personal contacts with visitors through various
workshops and tours. The "Walk with the

Curator" tour is newly opened to the public.
"Walk with the Curator" allows individuals
to have an opportunity to learn about the
plant collections and gardens from Curator
of the Scott Arboretum Andrew Bunting. In
the tour, Bunting also gives an overview of
recent changes made to the arboretum. The
tour program began as an intensive one-onone lesson with the curatorial intern at the
Arboretum. Special tours were also given on

the weekends. However, Bunting decided to
make the tours more accessible.
"It's an opportunity to show the
Arboretum in twelve seasons and show off
the wealth of collections," Bunting said.
Most visitors are returning visitors or professional horticulturists. This month, however, Swarthmore students attended for the
first time ever. Zamia Diaz 'O9 had never
been to an event before, but discovered the
tour through the campus calendar and was
impressed. "The Arboretum was great prior
to this, a beautiful and important part of
campus," she said. "The [tour guide] really
knew a lot of the trees in the area. I might
decide to go next month for the fall changes
tour guide."

Diaz said she had not previously been

that aware of Arboretum events. "I would
encourage other people to go, too," Diaz said.
The Arboretum has been trying to connect with Swarthmore students in different
ways. "Our goal is to bridge the gap between
students and the arboretum. Recently we
hired more student workers and provided
more meaningful opportunities," Bunting
said. Omari Faakye 10 currently works with
the Arboretum as the Curatorial Research
Assistant, having moved up from working
as a gardener last year. One of his projects
includes researching compostable alternatives for plastic utensils and cups in
Sharpies. Other student employment positions include Gardener's Assistants,
Fieldwork Assistant and Educational
Programs Assistant.

The Scott Arboretum was founded in 1929
by an endowment by the Scott family to
memorialize 1895 alum Arthur Hoyt Scott
and, according to the mission on the
Arboretum's Web site, "to make possible a
dream of Mr. Scott's to help horticulture by
visual demonstration." The college's nationally-recognized Arboretum has developed 21
collections and 19 gardens encompassing 300

acres and has won numerous awards.
Launched last fall, the self-created computer program tour greets visitors in the
Arboretum office lobby. The kiosk, one eight
gardens around the world who uses the software and the kiosk in conduction with one
another, provides detailed mapping information about every plant and bench on the
campus. "We mapped every plant with a
GPS, measuring the height and width
then we created tours for people," Robert
said. The initiative took six years to develop
and is among six gardens in the world to
offer the service. Users can either create
their own tours consisting of six different
plant locations or use a pre-set tour.
Many different types of visitors used the
kiosk as a resource, including alums, biolo...

gy students and prospective plant-buyers.
"We have some alums who want to look up a

tree donated on the grounds, people who are
taking classes and want to look up certain

specimens," Robert said. "We also have visitors who are researching maple trees and
want to see it before they are buy it." For
instance, students who take biology classes
at the Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square
often visit Swarthmore to observe specific
plant species.
Engineering professor Carr Everbach

views the Arboretum as an educational
resource, a bond with the Swarthmore borough community and a stress reliever.
"While the Arboretum's main function is a
teaching lab, it gets us students who find it
lovely. Also, some teachers love the
Arboretum and
chose this place because
...

of the Arboretum," Everbach said.
The beauty of the Arboretum was a factor
in Everbach's decision to teach at
Swarthmore instead of Yale University in
New Haven, Connecticut. "[The Arboretum]
is an important amenity that adds to the
quality of life," Everbach said.

Swat Sudan renamed STAND, broadens future goals
BY YINGJiA WANG
ywangX@swarthmore.edu

A prominent part of campus
student activism at Swarthmore,
Swat Sudan, recently underwent a
makeover. Now a chapter of
STAND, the group has simultaneously broadened its mission to
include working against not only
the crimes in Darfur, but against
genocide everywhere.
Founded shortly

after the
Genocide Intervention Fund (now

named the Genocide Intervention

Network) was started, Swat Sudan
quickly grew to be an active group
on campus. According to STAND

Outreach
Coordinator Erin Heaney 'O9,
although the GI-Fund could not be
officially affiliated with a college at
the time, the GI-Fund and Swat
Sudan still worked together closely. However, since then much has
changed. The GI-Fund changed its
name to the GI-Network and affiliated itself with STAND. STAND, in

from the campus to do so.
"The administration was pretty open

Reserved Students Digest undergoes change
BY ROSARIO PAZ
rpazl@swarthmore.edu

Beginning today, the Reserved Students Digest will
reflect recent changes codified by Student Council that
will make its use for advertising college events more limited and its breadth more condensed. These changes will
work in conjunction with the new Campus Calendar generated by ITS and the News and Information Office,
which will now serve as the primary electronic source
for event information.
Student Council held a forum on Tuesday night in
order to explain the use of the new calendar and answer
any questions about the new changes. According to
Student Council, the digest will change such that only
events for which there are not specific times or dates will
be permitted, in order to reduce the number of events
that circulate through the digest. Events with specific
times or dates will now have to be advertised in the new
events calendar.
At the forum, discussion circulated around how to go
about using the calendar to advertise events, focusing on
what should go on the calendar and what should go on

the digest. Student Council Secretary Meredith Firetog
'lO led the forum with the help of Kelly Mueller in ITS to
explain the more technical aspects of announcing events
in the calendar, such as how to use the different tools
available on the calendar's Web site.

the option of different views.

However, some students believe the digest serves as a
handy resource for looking up daily events and

Used cigarettes litter an ashtray at Swarthmore. Haverford College, a part of the Tri-College Consortium may be placing a smoking ban that would prevent such disposals on campus.

Haverford considers campus-wide smoking ban
BY ROSA KIM
rkiml@swarthmore. edu

In early September, Haverford College President Dr.
Stephen G. Emerson initiated a campus-wide discussion on
the possibility of creating a smoke-free environment
throughout Haverford's campus.
Haverford is not the first institution of higher learning to
consider implementing a formal smoking ban. According to
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights (ANR), as of October
2007, over 90 colleges and universities across the country
have entirely smoke-free campuses, both indoors and out,
and over 280 have all smoke-free residential housing.
Haverford's Dean of College Greg Kannerstein said that
Emerson expressed concern after seeing groups of people
smoking outside buildings on Haverford's campus.
Emerson, a hematologist oncologist, has worked with a
number of patients suffering from smoking-related diseases,
and given the health risks associated with smoke exposure,
saw this as a public health matter that needed to be
addressed.
The possibility of banning smoking on Haverford's campus continues to be discussed. An online survey has been
administered to get a sense of the varying opinions and to
incorporate the community's input in shaping the proposal.
At Swarthmore, smoking is currently prohibited inside
academic and administrative buildings. Most dormitories
are non-smoking except Hallowell, Roberts and parts of
Strath Haven, Wharton and Worth. There are however, no
clear rules monitoring smoking in public social spaces such
as Paces, Olde Club, the Women's Resource Center and Delta
Upsilon.
Abigail Frost 'O4 said in a letter to the Phoenix back in
October 2003, "For a school that cares enough about our
health to require both physical education classes and a
swimming test as prerequisites for graduation, the silent tolerance of the activity that is still [one of] America's largest
killer[s] is astounding. It is time that all students are able to
go to Paces without fear of an allergic reaction, that all students can sit in Olde Club without reeking of tobacco and
that all students who violate the terms already on the books
pay the required
fee."
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal said that
a complete smoking ban on Swarthmore's campus would
raise questions about how to effectively enforce the ban and
how to efficiently hold those who break the rule accountable.
"I think it's hard to ban smoking entirely from a campus
the size of Haverford or Swarthmore," Westphal said. "My
fear is, if you do that, you're going to play cat and mouse
with the smokers. I would like the environment to be as
healthy and safe as possible, but 1,400 people live here. I
think it's hard to prohibit everyone from smoking in their
home. So to me, the sort of two important factors are, that
this is people's home and that to ban smoking on campus
will push people off to the perimeters, or if they're just fed

up, they'll just smoke where they want on campus. I don't
know that anybody wants to be the smoke police. I think that

issues."
While the majority of the Haverford campus has reacted
positively to the idea of banning smoking, Watter said that
current survey responses reveal a healthy number of people
who are skeptical and oppose a smoking ban for a variety of
reasons. Emerson said that members of the Haverford com-

munity have expressed both support for and criticism ofhis
proposal to ban smoking on campus. "The strongest position
that has been offered is that it's legal so why is it any concern of the college's," he said. "The response is that secondary smoke is everyone's issue, first of all. Second of all, that
if we don't [ban smoking] we're creating one of few smoking,
sustaining, endorsing, enabling sanctuaries that exists

now."

"I hope that everybody on campus
who does smoke tries to quit and
succeeds in quitting, that would be
my strongest hope."
Dr. Stephen G. Emerson
Haverford College President
"We are looking at this as comprehensively as we can,"
said Haverford's Dean of Student Life Steve Watter.

So far, a considerable number ofHaverford's staff, facul-

ty and students have expressed their concerns about possi-

bly creating an atmosphere where smokers would not feel
welcome. Watter said the goal is to develop a plan that won't
make anyone feel marginalized. "Ultimately, we're trying to
create a healthy environment," Watter said.
All of these factors are being considered as the proposal
takes shape. "[Emerson] insists that nothing is final now,
that he wants input from people and have a discussion. He's
already changed the shape of the proposal and he's talking to
more people," Kannerstein said.
The proposal consists of not only banning smoking in
public areas, including outdoor areas, but also offering education and support to help people quit smoking. "We're
much more focused on providing support for people, like
smoke cessation programs," Kannerstein said.
Since Emerson first introduced the idea in September,
the proposal has evolved in light of the various unintention-

al consequences of a total ban.
"The proposal has changed a little to now allow a place on
campus outside where people can smoke," Kannerstein said.
The new plan designates outdoor areas on Haverford's camOctober 1% 2007

pus with enough distance from buildings to provide a place
where smokers could smoke, and at the same time, prevent-

ing the unintentional inhalation of secondhand smoke for

non-smokers.

According to Westphal, Swarthmore students who have
smoked in non-smoking buildings have been warned and
fined in the past. If the students continued to smoke in their
room or outside where the smoke traveled into another student's room, they were told they would not be allowed to live
in the building. "We have done top down things saying that
you may not smoke in any indoorpublic space, that you may
only smoke in certain dorm rooms with the door closed. So,
in order to go further than that, I think it would have to be a
student initiative," Westphal said.
As for a smoking ban on Swarthmore's campus, Westphal
said that this is not an issue the administration plans to
address unless a large population of the community expresses concern. "I think there are many groups that could initiate this. It could be the administration, it could be students,
it could be visitors. My suspicion is that the administration
is not going to address this unless they get a lot of concern
from a broad section of the community," she said.
Anne Kolker 'OB said that although smokers shouldn't be
allowed to smoke everywhere on campus, she does not favor
a campus-wide ban. "I don't think a ban of anything is the
way to go," she said.
Eric Glickman 'lO said he wouldn't favor a campus-wide
ban. He said smoking is within a student's rights, as long as
smokers are considerate of others.
In response to Haverford's consideration of a smoking
ban on its campus, Westphal said, "Haverford is such a close
ally of us, I'm going to be interested to see what happens. I
think anything that makes our environment healthier is
good, but I always look at the unintended consequences. And
if it makes a whole bunch ofrule breakers, I don't think that
makes for a good community."
Emerson said there is currently no timeline for
Haverford's smoking ban. If Haverford decides as a community to move forward with the initiative, the ban would be
effective next semester at the earliest. However, Watter said
there are still many aspects that need to be worked out
before a campus-wide ban is instituted. "You have a somewhat different view when you're a young student who has
not seen the impact of these things, versus someone who is
older and has lived a long time," Emerson said. "And in my
case as a physician, scientist, I've seen a lot."
Jamie Layton, a Sharpies cook, said she would support a
campus-wide smoking ban at Swarthmore. "When you're
young, you don't know a lot, but later on in life, you pay for
it," she said.
Emerson said the ultimate goal for initiating this conversation at Haverford is "to prevent premature death among
our students, faculty and staff," Emerson said. "I hope that
everybody on campus who does smoke tries to quit and succeeds in quitting, that would be my strongest hope."

Vintage: a well kept secret
BY ANNA

azalokol@swarthmore.edu

There's much more to Philadelphia than cheesesteak,
as I learned when I set out to discover some of the coolest
places around to shop for great vintage finds. Apparently
I was slow on the uptake because designers Marc Jacobs,
Anna Sui, Tory Burch, Donna Karan and Jean-Paul
Gaultier all agree that Philadelphia is great for vintage
shopping
each has found inspiration for collections in
various boutiques around the Philly area.
Decades Vintage, located at 615 Bainbridge Street, is
a particular favorite amongst the most well-known of
designers, and usually carries very "of-the-moment" vintage clothes that show up in couture designer collections
on runways months later. Though it has a great selection, Decades Vintage is truly a designer vintage store,
which means that everything's very expensive and probably out of any college

The Lineage Gallery is one of the many art galleries in
Old City open for free on every first Friday of the month.

T.G.I. First Friday
BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

As soon as you enter the periphery of Philadelphia's Old
City, you know that it's First Friday. A steady crowd bustles to the beat of a jazz quartet, flowing between galleries,
shops and restaurants. Performers and artists take to the
streets as students, hipsters and aficionados alike discuss
art well into the night.
First Fridays, logically on the first Friday of every
month, usher in the changing of exhibits at many of
Philadelphia's art galleries. Between the hours of 5 and 9
p.m., galleries are open to the general public free of charge.
Many offer a variety of refreshments to their patrons and
encourage a lively, talkative atmosphere.
For those who have never explored the Philadelphia art
scene, First Fridays are an easy way to get a sampling of
the wide variety of artwork on display. Most galleries are
clustered either on 3rd Street between Race and Arch or on
2nd Street between Church and Locust. Within a short period of time and without much walking, one can see pieces
created by everyone from sculptors to graffitists. The only
downside of the event is, paradoxically, its popularity. Due
to the massive crowds at each gallery, spaces feel cramped
and it is hard to get a long look at each particular work of
art. Regardless, at the end of the night, First Friday attendees should feel welcomed into Philadelphia's large, artsy
family.
This October's First Friday was an exceptional embodiment of the First Friday spirit, with many galleries opening with powerful exhibits. The Lineage Gallery at 21 North
Second Street displayed an engaging assortment of brightly colored graffiti-inspired pieces by artists such as Kenji
Hirata and Mike Ming. In contrast, Lineage also featured
the work ofChristian Mendoza. Mendoza's pieces consisted
of intricate webs ofblack-and-white line drawings and were
both accessible and engrossing.
On a softer note, the Petimenti Gallery at 145 North
Second Street featured the quietly moving works of Rachel
Bone. Bone's show, entitled "Remedies," consisted of whimsically simple and colorful images of women. According to
Bone's "artist's statement" on Petimenti's Web site, "the
paintings are not only frames from a single linear story, but
are illustrations for an infinite collection of possible tales."
Other galleries displayed works with a more pointed
purpose. Muse at 52 North Second Street opened with the
works of Etta Winigrad. Winigrad used a combination of 2D painting and 3-D organic sculpture to explore themes of
birth and femininity.
For those who missed this month's openings, all the
exhibits, including the above mentioned, will be on display
until November's First Friday.

student's budget. Vagabond
Boutique, a combination yarn and clothing boutique on
37 N 3rd Street in Old City, is another great place to shop,
both when it comes to contemporary designers and vintage clothes. Though their selection of vintage is small, it
is priced cheaper than the regular clothes.
Still, it's not as great of a find as Retrospect, the most
recommended place for great vintage shopping. With
rows of hip 80s jeans, cute cardigans, classic vintage
dresses and stacks of cowboy boots, Retrospect, located at
534 South Street, is probably the best place to shop vintage on a budget. Though the clothing isn't cheap, it is
very reasonably priced and on Wednesdays, students get
a 15% discount by showing a college I.D.

Further down South Street is Antiquarian's Delight,
which houses about two dozen flea-market-type stalls
that sell everything from vintage clothing to old photos,

jewelry and sunglasses. Vendors are willing to negotiate
their prices, which is great for those of us who are running low on cash from all those late-night phone calls to
Renato's.

Apparently I was slow on the
uptake because designers Marc

Jacobs, Anna Sui... and Jean-Paul
Gaultier all agree that Philadelphia
is great for vintage shopping.
Though vintage shopping in Philadelphia isn't cheap,
it is good
very good. And if you search hard enough,
you can always find great hand-crocheted sweaters, broken-in jeans and flowery dresses at reasonable prices
that are much lower than they would be at big, trendy

retail stores.
Even if you don't plan on buying anything from the
higher-end designer vintage boutiques, they're still
worth checking out, if only for the window shopping and
long sighs of "I wish I could afford it." Hopefully, that will
provide some incentive to come back to campus and finish that political science paper, so that one day, you too

can have a salary.

A beautiful day in the Gayborhood
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu
This past Sunday, Philly's Outfest took place in
Philadelphia's friendly "gayborhood" in Center City just
four blocks south of City Hall. Streets were sectioned off
for the massive crowds to wander through the festival's
myriad of activities and attractions, not least of these
being a big main-stage with acts that ranged from show
tunes, like "When You Got It, Flaunt It" and oddly a Lizza
Minnelli impression of "New York, New York," to hip-hop
and rap from the "Juan Lords". Meanwhile, some hardcore voguing went down in the dance area with DJ Maria

Out Day celebration.

V, who sweetly mixed Rihanna's "Umbrella". Some
things I didn't expect to see were an Orbitron that got to
spin willing festival-goers silly and a hoedown, courtesy
of Independence Squares, Philadelphia's LGBT square

dance club.

Every organization under tha.sun, even the Liberty
Gay Rodeo Association, had a table set up at Outfest.
Sexual health groups were on call to spread awareness
and freebies like flavored condoms and a new KY mist
spray. Plenty of big name sponsors were at the event, like
Miller Lite and Absolut Vodka, who gave out ice-cold
drafts and doormats with rainbow-colored Absolut bottles curiously reading "Absolut First." One of the tablers
explained to me that Absolut Vodka was one of the first
companies of its kind to embrace the gay community.
And what is an Outfest without its loudspeaker-wielding condemners? Fortunately, anti-gay preachers were
few and far between. They were also cleverly retorted by
a few people who parodied their protest by holding up
signs with supposed edicts from the Bible like, "It is
acceptable for man to have sex with his slave."
For this reporter, the high point of going to Outfest
was just seeing the sheer number of people at the event.
Perhaps this has to do with being cooped up at
Swarthmore for so long, but the sight of such a huge gathering gave me quite a rush, particularly when Beyonce
singing "Listen" blasted through the streets and had
countless people lip-synching in unison and countless
couples sharing a tender moment.
It's no wonder that the nation's biggest Coming Out
Day celebration takes place on the streets of the gayborhood. Philadelphia has quite the progressive queer history, going far beyond the kowtowing of Jonathan
Demme's benign 1993 movie. Gay rights demonstrations
were held in front of Independence Hall four years before

Stonewall.
The gayborhood is chock full of businesses that support the queer community, from Giovanni's Room, the
nation's oldest gay and lesbian bookstore named after a
landmark 50s novel, to Spruce St. DVD and Video. For
advocacy and community support, the William Way
Community Center and the Attic Youth Center are in the
area. As for nightlife, the gayborhood has a bevy of choices, the most famous being Woody's and Sisters. Check out
www.phillypride.org for more information.

South Street busy nightlife draws a crowd
BY SUNNY COWELL
scowelll@swarthmore.edu
What do college students do on a Saturday night in the
of Philadelphia? As most of us know, Philly has many
hotspots, but my main challenge was to find the night scene
for young adults including those under 2L I decided to focus
on South Street and its surrounding area. At first, the demographic in the area on the streets of Philly was mainly comprised of a middle-aged and slightly older crowd. But once it
hit 9 p.m., a different crowd of young professionals, college
students and young adults emerged.
First, my friends and I enjoyed eating delicious
Malaysian food at Penang, a fabulous Malaysian restaurant
at the heart of Chinatown, about 15 minutes away from
South Street on foot. The restaurant had a wide selection of
both vegetarian and meat dishes as well as an array of tropical juices and desserts. I ordered mango chicken, which
consisted of mango strips, smothered with sweet and sour
sauce in mango shells accompanied by coconut rice. My
friends ordered curry chicken and curry tofu with peanut
sauce as well as brown rice and coconut rice. We were
ecstatic about eating non-Sharpies food and getting off campus. We tried some interesting yet savory concoctions called
"chendol" consisting of green pea flour strips and sweet red
beans topped with shaved ice and coconut milk, and something called the "ABC," comprised of shaved ice with red
bean, corn, plum seeds, jelly, red rose syrup and milk. We
amused ourselves even more by taking pictures of the colorful and tasty dishes.
If you are out for a night on the town, South Street is the
hip place to be. After eating at the restaurant, we explored
the area of South Street, which was bustling with college
students, blasting hip-hop from passing cars, and linedwith
stores. Ariane Vartanian 10 said, "I am surprised at how
accessible the city is. We went from one place to another in
just a few blocks." We even passed some big screen outdoor
movies playing in a park between Chinatown and South
Street. Some of the big names and hotspots on South Street
are Johnny Rockets, Adidas and BareFeet Shoes. South
Street mainly houses cheaper nameless boutiques with hidden treasures and urban fashion designs. I spent most of my
time perusing BareFeet Shoes and the infamous Condom
Kingdom. Surprisingly, there was an interesting mix of peocity

pie in Condom Kingdom, ranging from young children to
middle-aged couples. For the rest of the time, we enjoyed
walking the street and browsing in some of the boutiques. I
was delighted to run into many Swatties on our venture
from Chinatown to South Street. We saw Swarthmore students on almost every corner! It was really nice to see familiar faces while also experiencing the nightlife off campus.
The only disappointment I had about Philly was the fact
that the Gallery, a large shopping mall on Market East,

closed at 7 p.m., obscenely early for a Saturday. There were
several other places that we could not go, such as the
Halloween party at Shampoo nightclub and other venues
exclusively for people 21 and over. Despite missing out on
the Gallery and other places we were too young to enjoy, we
found plenty of shopping venues on South Street, and we
managed to occupy ourselves with unique and delicious
food. May Maani 10 described our trip to Philly as "the perfect pre-midterm week excursion."

some of Philadelphia's concert venues. As
the concert-going season winds down over
the next couple of months, Philadelphia will
be playing host to many great musicians, all
just a short train ride away.
Philadelphia's independent music scene
is largely one-stop shopping. R5 productions
(http://www.Rsproductions.com), a locally-

owned-and-operated production company,
hosts shows at several area venues. Thenshows are intimate and mostly for all ages,
deliberate choices by Sean Agnew, founder
of R5, who has done much to foster a community amongst Philadelphia's concertgo-

ers.

Rs's largest venue is the Starlight
Ballroom, located at 460 N. 9th St. The
Starlight Ballroom is a converted
roller rink, making for a slightly
unusual, though always entertaining concert experience. There is
something magical about high
school hipsters and disco balls.
Speaking of high schoolers, if
you see a kid with a bright
yellow polo, tell him I said
what up we have beef.
RS Productions also

V First Unitarian Church
on Chestnut at 22nd.

of its performances. The basement is a
poorly lit space that feels oh so much like a
dirty firehall. Lighting concerns aside, the
basement is a very intimate place to hold a
show, encouraging meaningful audience
interaction from any performer.
Upstairs, R5 often holds seated shows in
the sanctuary of the church. The space is
beautiful and the acoustics are dreamy. But
be careful, for if you are interested in seeing
a show up here, make sure to get tickets far
in advance. The sanctuary is both small and
awesome, leading those shows to sell out
quickly.

Okay, so what if Rs's concert offerings
don't appeal to you? Well, then you will
need to contend with the beast that is
Ticketmaster. Upon purchasing tickets
online, you may be surprised to find that
the advertised ticket price is quite illusory,
for many a surcharge will ratchet up your
cost. But sometimes it is worth the pain to
see a great show.
The Theatre of the Living Arts is located
at 334 South Street, conveniently close for
those wise concertgoers who plan to get into
the city using the Swarthmore Philly
Shuttle. The TLA is big, but the sound is
always pretty good. The venue has some
remnants of its past life as a movie theater,
like the sloped floor that allows for a nice
view of all that is on stage.
The Electric Factory, located at 7th and

Willow, is the TLA's big brother, and big it
is. With a capacity roughly two and a half
times that of the TLA, a sold out show is
pretty impressive at the Electric Factory.
The sound is always good, but at a venue
this size, the stage seems intractably far
away.

R5 [productions] often
holds seated shows in the
sanctuary of a church. The
space is beautiful and the
acoustics are dreamy.
As the name would suggest, the Electric

Factory was once, in fact, an Electric
Factory. Alas, all that remains are some

decorative dials and meters on the walls.
Meh.
All told, Philadelphia has some great
music venues. If you are thinking about
going to a show at the Starlight Ballroom or
The First Unitarian, do not hesitate. Take
the R3 to Market East for Starlight and to
Suburban (or 30th Street) for First
Unitarian without delay, for another great
concert awaits you today!

Beiler's Bakery
For monstrous slices of pie and cake, donuts

Beiler's Bakery. Beiler's treats are made onsite, so be sure to watch the bakers assembling
massive trays of sticky buns to whet your

We tried: A cinnamon sugar donut and nutencrusted sticky bun. The donut was delicious

and unlike any other I tried before with a
crunchy sugar glaze underneath the cinnamon
topping. The sticky bun was perfect: yeasty
dough stuffed with cinnamon and topped with
pecans and walnuts.
Where to go: The Reading Terminal Market
at 12th and Arch Street.
Flying Monkey Patisserie
Although their presentation leaves something to be desired, the Flying Monkey offers
both conventional and daring cupcakes.
Traditionalists can enjoy vanilla cake with
chocolate buttercream, while the more adventurous can try chocolate cake covered in lavender flavored buttercream. The cupcakes are
reasonably priced at either $1.75 or $2 per tiny
treat.

We tried: The spumoni cupcake, an interesting blend of chocolate cake filled with strawberry preserves and topped with pistachio buttercream. The "preserves" just tasted like sugary strawberry jam, but the frosting was ric*

Beowulf vs. Grendel. The Yankees vs. the Red Sox.
Swarthmore vs. Haverford. All storied rivalries, to be sure. But
none are as deep-seated, as long-lasting or as bitter as the epic
cheesesteak rivalry between Pat's King of Steaks and Geno's
Cheesesteaks, the two competitors for the title of Philly's best
cheesesteak.
Which one is better you ask? This reporter braved public
transportation, an unfamiliar city and skyrocketing cholesterol
in order to bring you the answer to this age-old dilemma. And
to eat some disgustingly good food in the process.
After walking 12 blocks through Philly in the Friday afternoon heat, all I really wanted was a cold drink of water. When I
stopped outside Geno's greasy, orange, plastic facade, a cheesesteak was the last thing on my mind. But I stood up to the challenge and, after struggling to decide what kind of steak I wanted, ordered a "regular American with onions," (not knowing the
proper lingo, I didn'tjust say "wit') and sat down at a small plastic table to eat.

might stop at to grab a bite and shoot the breeze. The actual
cheesesteak was also better at Pat's the meat was more tender,
the cheese more abundant and the onions less overpowering.
The sandwiches at Pat's even stayed together better. While
my Geno's cheesesteak shed onions all over the table, the only
things that came off the Pat's cheesesteak was blobs of grease,
which ended up all over my fingers and the table and forced me
to resolve that, as soon as I returned to campus, I was going ta
hit the gym. The 12-block walk back to the train
even make a dent in all that fat, leaving me to worry alout
clogged arteries and love handles.
In short, everything that makes a great cheesesteak a great
cheesesteak. Pat's isn't lying when they call themselves the
"King of Steaks."

Let's face it: we're college students. We don't have a lot of disposable income. We also don't want to be doomed to four years of
bland Sharpies food because of the aforementioned lack of funds.
Luckily, there are a lot of places in Philly where even poor college
students can eat good food without placing too much strain on their
wallets. Or their parents' wallets, if that's how you roll.
If you're in the mood for a raucously fun atmosphere, good burgers and maybe even a Guinness, Moriarity's Irish Pub at 116 Walnut
Street is the place for you. With a truly breathtaking selection of
gourmet hamburgers that you can eat for about $l5 a person,
Moriarity's is a great place to go for a dinner-and-a-movie date, a
bite to eat before a concert or just a fun night out.
If you're feeling a little more sophisticated and edgy, you might
want to try Brasserie Perrier. Located at 1619 Walnut Street,
Brasserie Perrier serves good, hip French food at very un-French
prices. If you want to spend even less money, sit at the bar; the
menu is just as good, the prices are lower and the atmosphere is
more laid back than in the main dining room. If you're like me and
you crave French food on a regular basis but rarely indulge because
of sky-high prices, Brasserie Perrier is an excellent choice for a
night out.
Another sophisticated yet inexpensive dining choice is Mizu
Sushi Bar, which you can find at 111 S. 40th Street. Mizu serves all
kinds of traditional sushi as well as rules, for prices that won't kill
you. It may not be quite as inexpensive as QUB, but it comes close
and is a great option if you want to get off campus for a night.
Sometimes I just want good, solid, delicious Italian food like the
kind my family makes, which is very different than the kind you'll
find at cheap Italian chains like Olive Garden. If this sounds familiar to you, I would recommend Ralph's Italian Restaurant. Ralph's,
located at 760 S. 9th Street, claims to be the oldest family-owned
Italian restaurant in the country and since it was founded in 1900, it
may well be. With entrees ranging from $l5-20 and a homey Italian
atmosphere, Ralph's is well worth the walk from the Market Street

Station.
If you want a funky, musical atmosphere in which to eat, you
should stop by Tattooed Mom's at 530 South Street. Tattooed Mom's
mging from pizza to American
has
> hummus, with an extensive vegetarian menu
thrown in for good measure. The club atmosphere adds fun to dinner and makes for a good excursion into Philadelphia.
Hopefully you are now well-informed enough to venture into
Philly without spending any more than you have to on food. Save
your money for other fun things, like clothing and DVDs, and stop
by one of these restaurants for good fun and a fun atmosphere.

Explore Philly's parkway of art museums

BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu
There may be a lot of cases where

Philadelphia pales in comparison to other

cities, but for the museum lover in you,

Philly makes it all too easy. The Rodin
Museum, the Free Library of Philadelphia,

the Franklin Institute Science Museum and
the Philadelphia Museum of Art all flank
the
Benjamin
Parkway,
Franklin
Philadelphia's very own scenic ChampsElysees, conveniently comprising what is

known as the "museum district."
Taking advantage of the Philly Kick-Off s
free admission into museums, I hopped
around the area, packing a short afternoon
with what could and should be experienced
over the course of several visits.
The Rodin Museum:
My first stop was to the Rodin Museum,
which houses the works of French sculptor
Auguste Rodin. A stranger to art history
without a clue as to who Rodin was, I was
grateful to find that Rodin's most recognizable piece, "The Thinker," was plopped in the
center of the quaint garden that leads to the
building. Upon approaching the museum,
one encounters the famed "Gates of Hell," to
which Chelsea Davis 'lO, flashing back to
her halcyon days of AP Art History,
exclaimed, "The Gates of Hell. Hell, yes!"

"The Gates of Hall" is an elaborately
designed gateway that is particularly
notable for the contrast between its low and
high reliefs. Even my unschooled eye couldn't help but be amazed by how far out the

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

miniscule figures (mostly writhing in pain)
stretched beyond the main structure.
Inside, Rodin's works range from lifesized sculptures of famous people's heads
like Gustav Mahler to car-sized ones like
"The Burghers ofCalais." Also, of the works
represented in the museum, an overwhelming portion takes as its subject a comicallooking, plump, mustached man in various
states of undress. The man is writer Honore
de Balzac, and Rodin's fixation on him is
nothing short of amusing. Even a parody by
a German artist, depicting Balzac as a walrus, sits next to one of Rodin's Balzacs.
The Rodin Museum is an impressive and

comprehensive look at Rodin's works that
hardly takes half an hour to cover if you've
got a busy schedule. Plus, admission is free,
although there is a rather passive-aggressive policy of encouraging $3 donations.
Rodin Museum lies on the Benjamin
Franklin Parkway at 22nd St., and its hours
are Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Free guided tours are given at 1 p.m. every
Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, and on the
first and third Saturdays of the month.
Visitors should gather in the Main

Entrance Hall. (Tours are free after the suggested $3 admission donation.)
The Philadelphia Museum of Art:
Behind the spacious Eakins Oval where
an equestrian George Washington is poised
to charge at you, the Philadelphia Museum
ofArt is about as majestic a public space as
you'll get in Philly. This was my first time at
the PMA, so I was somewhat dejected that
my more seasoned company didn't want to

Rocky Balboa it up the steps with me.
We tackled the museum first by working
through the gallery of European Art from
1850
to
1900,
featuring
familiar
Impressionist pieces that I have always
foundeasier to consume. Of course, being in
the company of Swatties, I was quickly
rebutted with the negative opinion of the
Impressionist movement as insular and elitist with a tawdry color palette that became
increasingly less apathetic to real life. To be
sure, there were plenty of pieces that went
for realism. One painting, "My Friends" by
Viggo Johansen, is barely discernable as it
depicts a gathering of friends in a darkened
room with a single dim lamplight. Another
particularly jarring picture, "The Source of
Life" by Leon Frederic, features vividly
painted naked infants holding hands in a
spring in the wilderness and had us
sqeamishly shuffling away.
This gallery segued into the Modern and
Contemporary Art gallery with plenty of
works to appreciate or to scoff at. For every
amazingly
surrealistic

Perspective of a Perfect Sunset" by Eugene

Alex Ho Phoenix Staff

Berman or "Ancient Bird and Mummified
Bird" by Leon Kelly, there was an odious
piece with a self-reflexive statement about
high and low art in a spiraled neon light
sign.

I also checked out the PMA's sections on
medieval art and Asian art cleverly pre-

sented in recreations of architectural settings from the past. You can sit down and
relax in a medieval cloister with picturesque archways, walk past Japanese ceremonial teahouses, and peer into the com-

mons of a Ming dynasty official, making for
art you not only can see, but can also expe-

rience.

"The Gates of Hell" towers over visitors about to enter the Rodin Museum.

The famed "Rocky" steps lead up to the Philadelphia Museum of Arts.

The PMA also has countless temporary
exhibitions, the highest-profile of them
being the Renoir Landscapes, which run to
Jan, 6, and the first major Frida Kahlo exhibition in the U.S. in 15 years, coming on Feb.
20. But there are also plenty of smaller
treasures scattered about the museum. For
example, the Free Library of Philadelphia is
showcasing its collection of elaborately
illustrated and unbelievably well-preserved
folios from a 16th century Persian manuscript of "Razmnama," the Book of War.
The Philadelphia Museum ofArt is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
and admission is $lO with your student ID
and free on Sundays.
Galleries at Moore:
With little time to spare, I raced to Logan
Circle and checked out the art galleries at
the Moore College of Art and Design.
Besides being confused as to what parts of
the building were galleries and what parts
were the college's residential facilities (I
nearly walked into their dining hall, imagining it to be some elaborate performance
art), I liked how much more low key and
accessible the exhibits were in the context
of a setting that wasn't exclusively a museuni. Until Oct. 21, Moore features "Gnosis"
by its academic dean Dona Lantz, a collection of side-by-side photographs, juxtaposing candid everyday moments with inanimate objects. Another exhibit by Philly
artist Joel Katz entitled "Mississippi 1964"
displays crisp black and white snapshots
that creepily reincarnate a racially segregated culture from its safely relegated place
in the past. The exhibit will end on Oct. 14.
Two upcoming exhibitions open on Oct.
26
"Facts, Fantasies and Fictions," which

ents paintings and videos that explore various approaches to the narrative tradition in
contemporary art" and "InSights," where
artist Eva Wylie draws images "from a variety of sources including the Internet, water

bottles, travel magazines, advertisements,
as well as from her own 'tourist' photographs." The Galleries at Moore are located
at 20th St. and Benjamin Franklin Parkway.
Hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and admission is
free.
That's where my day ended, but the
museum district still has more to offer,
some of which is listed below. The museum

This match was particularly special because "it was

Haverford in the past has had a very inactive chess
club."
Costigan-Humes contacted Estey to hold the first ever

because Pang, on black, was
able to "control the board for

Since this is the biggest chess event ever held at
Swarthmore, winning was important but the club wanted to include first-time chess competitors in the match.
Two of the five Swarthmore competitors played competitively for the first time. "This was my first time competing, but it was not as stressful as I had thought,"

Langdon said.

When asked about being the lone female on the team,
Langdon said, "As to being the only girl, that's nothing
new. I have encountered very few female chessplayers,

said. Dandurand's win led
to Swarthmore's 3-2 victory.

The future is looking bright

Quaker traditions

On Sunday morning, I participated
in a Swarthmore
tradition far older
than the Pterodactyl Hunt, Screw
Your Roommate or
freaking out about
work: I attended the

Quaker Meeting for
Worship.
It was here that I
met Lyn Jones '4O,

JULIAN CHENDER
The Spiritual Scene

who has attended
the
Swarthmore
Meeting since she
was a student here
and
remembers
professors
when
were required to
attend the weekly
Meeting.

Through

the 70-plus years that Jones, a product of the Quaker

Matchbox with husband Ed Jones '39, has been attending
the Meeting, the entire Quaker nature of the College has

changed significantly.
The most obvious change is that Swarthmore College
has dropped its affiliation with the Society of Friends, and
the administration no longer requires professors to attend
the weekly Meeting. The only one there on Sunday was
assistant professor of philosophy Alan Baker, who has
only started to attend Meeting since coming to
Swarthmore. In fact, he may be one of only a few Quakers
left in a faculty that was once 100 percent Quaker, and he
wasn't even a Quaker when the school hired him.
Baker
convincingly asserts
that mandatory
Quakerism and academic excellence cannot coexist at
Swarthmore, and the College has wisely opted for the latter. "It's hard to have affirmative action for Quakers," he
said, referring to the hiring of faculty. When looking to
create a school of such high academic standards as
Swarthmore, the administration must hire professors
(and admit students) based on merit and not religious
affiliation. The College decided to place academics above
religious homogeneity.
However, Dean of Student Life Myrt Westphal points
out that though the College has jettisoned the Quaker religion, it still holds onto "many of the beliefs and traditions
of the Quakers, such as consensus, not working in a hierarchical manner, the fact about community service and
helping other people." The College has kept what it considers socially important about Quakerism, while letting
go of the mandatory belief system. Though I am sure the
administration could force it if it really wanted to, I don't
see the College as able to completely divorce itself from
Quakerism.
Sunday was my first Meeting for Worship, and it was a
warm and contemplative experience. When I walked into
the main room of the Meetinghouse (after Friend Albert
Chung provided the students with a delicious breakfast of
cinnamon rolls and apples with caramel dip), it felt like
entering a time warp.
The Meetinghouse sometime houses a cappella concerts, and the old, simple beauty of the interior can be
admired whenever one walks through the front door. But
participating in the tradition of Meeting for Worship, I felt
as though I was following in the footsteps, physically and
metaphorically, of so many Quakers before today and I
could visualize everyone dressed in 17th century costume.
Sitting silently in that room (that's what you do at
Meeting, until you are moved by the divine to stand and
speak) one can feel a commanding presence of energy,
kindness and open-heartedness and there exists an
intense feeling of community and vulnerability in the
silence. It felt as though I was sharing something very
personal with all those around me.
Meeting for Worship is a very active manner of worship, in some ways much more so than attending a service led by a priest or minister. This is certainly in part
because Quakerism fully embodies MartinLuther's belief
in the priesthood of all believers, and that each person has
within her- or himself, the inner light. We are all so valuable
it is as though each of us has a piece of the puzzle,
and not just the guy at the front. Such an understanding
can be quite empowering.

tently in various

conversations I've
had over the past
few weeks, which
got me thinking
about his music
in terms of the
subject of this column. It is an
incontrovertible
fact that music
and fashion share
deep-seated roots;

elements of one

mutually saturate

trend is not glaringly obvious, but rather complements a
personal aesthetic. It's the difference between looking
effortless and looking forced. After all, Kanye says in the
lyrics to the title track of the mixtape, "When you try
hard, that's when you die hard."
Going back to "Us Placers," this song is even more relevant to the fashion Zeitgeist because of its meaning.
Pharrell encapsulates the whole issue with the lines:
"Young, dumb, high strung, who could handle us/
Wonder how God's gon' paint today's canvases." This
measured warning tells people to step outside the fastpaced, status oriented society to see whatkind of impact
we are having on the world. Including a track on the mixtape with such a message is especially poignant, considering the state of Kanye's ego (massive). It shows that
there is at least some level of caution and self-awareness
to what he is doing.

and inform the

other.

"Can't Tell Me Nothing," which was released as a prequ'el to his third solo album, "Graduation," aptly exemplifies this relationship between music and fashion. The
thing that immediately caught my attention upon first
listening to it was the amount of diversity on each track,
with collaborations across the spectrum of hip-hop and
R&B and unexpected sampling of tracks by Pete Bjorn
and John, Thorn Yorke of Radiohead and, of course, Daft
Punk.
This nod to all aspects of popular music speaks to the
sartorial landscape, which emphasizes mixing inspirations from different styles and enclaves of people. Hard
versus soft, feminine versus masculine, sleek versus
voluminous, urban versus urbane. Kanye takes what is
familiar and reworks it into something new in the same
way that fashion reinterprets and reinvents designs.
What makes Kanye's foray into indie and electronic
music so successful is that he doesn't just do it for the
sake of sampling something other than hip-hop, but
because the mix fits into the meaning behind these
songs. Take, for example, the third track on the mixtape,
"Us Placers," in which Lupe Fiasco, Kanye West and
Pharrell take turns rapping about the problems and insecurities that arise from constantly seeking fame and
money. Thorn Yorke's angsty, tired voice weaves in and
out of their rhymes with the lyrics, "The more you try to
erase me ... the more that I appear." In this case, the meditative qualities of the Radiohead frontman's song contrast beautifully with the rappers' more punctuated
deliveries.
Likewise in sartorial terms, taking inspiration from

different styles and mixing them together works best if,
in the end, it creates something cohesive, so that the

And what I think is heartening is that the fashion
world seems to be experiencing a similar condition of
self-reflection. In this highly superficial domain that
upholds a youthful and thin standard of beauty, more
and more designers are telling their models to gain
weight. In a world that is seen as being recklessly materialistic, people seem to be more aware of the warnings
from environmentalists about the wastefulness of excess.
And while the current state of the fashion world is still
far from fully embracing a sustainable lifestyle (after all,
what is fashion if not offensive?), I think the fact that
more and more people are sneered at for buying acces-

sories made from animals and that outlandish displays of
materialism are seen as gauche are steps in the right

direction.

Kanye released this mixtape back in May free of
charge and directly to the internet. Anyone can download it just by Googling the title. Therefore, no official
hard copy of the mixtape exists, and no amount of money
(or guilt for illegally downloading it) is required to enjoy
it. "Can't Tell Me Nothing" is all about the sound, just as
fashion should be all about the style.

Because of this

mistake we have
the dumbbell telephone (builds muscle as you chat), the
Gotta Go briefcase (doubles as a toilet for on-the-go business types) and most inventions on the hit ABC show
"American Inventor." But the worst type of gimmick is
one that claims to act for a cause —like the wide variety
of publicity stunts made in the name of "going green."
The practice is called greenwashing, and it's a dirty trick
that we can't afford to fall for.
"Going green" is one of the hottest trends in
American society today. With the 2006 release of Al
Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth," the chic popularity of
hybrid vehicles and the undeniable effect of disasters
like Hurricane Katrina and global warming, more
Americans are looking for ways to help the environment.
The city of Manhattan has seen its architects compete for

the title of the creator of the most sustainable skyscraper. Americans have become familiar with solar panels, wind farms and ethanol fuel if for no other reason
than their continual mention on the news. As we all
know from high school, rarely does popularity favor
goodness, but with "going green," its happening, and it's
heartening. Nevertheless, we have to keep an eye out for
those who wouldride the green wave for any other purpose than the noble one around us—the Earth.
Greenwashing is occasionally cute, rarely good-inten-

tioned and just about everywhere. The most oft-cited
example of it is the 2003 Clear Skies Initiative, the Bush
Administration's pitiful attempt at environmental policy
with the most flagrant misnomer since the Patriot Act.
Under the guise of reducing air pollution, the Clear Skies
Initiative merely pandered to votes, while according to
data from the Sierra Club, it actually loosened the cap for
nitrous oxide emissions, allowed 225% more tonnage of
sulphur dioxide than was allowed under the Clean Air
Act of 1990 and weakened existing mercury pollution
controls. Today, the Clear Skies Initiative is still deadlocked in Congress, the above provisions drawing the ire
of environmentalist lawmakers.
On the way from the Capitol to the grocery store,
greenwashing turns from the malicious and political to
the positively ludicrous. "Natural Cheetos" are a prime

example—could anything be less natural than a crunchy
wisp of cheese flavoring puffed up into a vivid orange
globule? Next to it on the shelf are the Natural Lay's,

Natural Tostitos and Natural Ruffles. But somehow the
ploy works—as customers rush to satisfy both their scruples and their snacking urges, they literally buy into the
idea that organic chips are a better choice than ordinary

chips. They're not. Natural Lay's (as well as Ruffles and

contains no fewer grams of fat and no fewer
calories than Classic Lay's, but it's hard to tell in the
greenwashed grocery aisles.
Nintendo recently released for its DS console the
video game "Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol," which ostensibly
teaches children how to keep the environment clean by
squirting water at approaching "smoglings"—from the
confines of the living room. Somewhere in development,
the idea of fostering an appreciation for nature through
being in nature got axed. (The game is also only available
at Wal-Mart, which has a grievous record of crimes
Tostitos)

against the environment, not the least of which is the
biblically-sized Supercenter). Toyota exports more than
three times as many SUVs as Priuses, the hybrid car for
which it has rightfully been lauded. British Petroleum
(BP) pledged $5OO million toward biofuel alternatives,
but will spend in excess of $5 billion in the next five
years for oil exploration in Alaska. Wherever pollution,
excess, and poor stewardship of the Earth exist, there is
almost always an attempt to cover them up.
Disingenuous attempts to greenwash our laws, our
markets and our roads take advantage of a truly noble
cause. In the end, simple gimmicks may undermine environmentalism as we know it by making it frivolous and
laughable, like a bag of Natural Cheetos. To protect the
environmental movement from impostors and would-be
greenwashers, we need to be more aware of its real goals,
and whether certain products, plans and lifestyles really
support them. A crazy idea? Maybe just crazy enough to
work.

YOSHI JOHNSON

Yo, It's Not That Deep
At one point during my time here, I was

seriously contemplating doing some selfappropriated pro-bono work for the
Development Office in the form of a letter to
Bill Gates. I wanted to ask him to endow
new financial aid, academic support and
recruitment programs at Swat for under-

change of tremendous value and scope.

After some affirmative action conversations that took place on campus last week, I
got to thinking about the letter I'd drafted
and how very different a letter I wrote
today would be, when suddenly it occurred
to me: "You have a column to write..."
First, some setup. I chose Swarthmore
over an assortment of Ivy League institutions and more appealing financial aid
offers because I loved this place and what I
thought it stood for. I believed it was a
unique haven for different thinkers and
open hearts, and more pointedly, a wellspring of profound social transformation. I
believed so much in the transformative
power of this college, in fact, that I'd often
fantasized about the day when serendipity
would be visited upon this rosy Utopia—in
the form of, say, a $1 billion gift—and so it
eventually occurred to me that perhaps I
should solicit just such a fortuitous event

action, socioeconomic "sensitivity," needblind and need-based admissions policies—
I thought these broken or inadequate policies could be made workable again right

here in the amenable microcosm of
Swarthmore, all with just a little additional

funding...
I know now that the College really doesn't need the money. What Swarthmore and
its peer institutions lack is not money, but
rather mandate. There's no substantive
will to leverage for causes of justice the
incredible influence, resources, and power
that these institutions wield—neither from
the critical echelons of administration, nor
from the powerful donors and trustees who
drive such institutional initiatives.
Swat, frankly, is about as special as any
other of its peer institutions in that it is a
successful businesses built upon a history
of elitism and an enormous hoard of
wealth. "Promoting egalitarianism, social
mobility and social justice," therefore, doesn't really make it onto the agenda, even if
derivatives or phrases reminiscent of such
glib do snake their way into a press release
now and then. These institutions may boast
a wealth of resources to implement and
effect broad societal changes, but in real
talk, they only do what they have to do to

maintain their position at the top of the
food chain.
To be fair, we can expand our focus
beyond Swat a bit for examples of this deficiency of moral impetus.
Take, for
instance, the staggering announcements of
FY2006 endowment returns at Amherst and
Yale this fall: Amherst added s37o+ million
to its endowment, and Yale more than $5
billion. Annual returns of nearly 30% are
exceptional, granted, but at even more modest rates of return, well-endowed institutions (read: Swarthmore and its peers) are
recouping their entire operating budgets in

interest alone, and several times over some

were comparable to Swarthmore's for 2006,
at $llB million, while Yale's were audited at
roughly $2 billion.)

Hmmm.

So if Amherstians and Elis

(and yes, Swatties) could theoretically be
going to school for free (but obviously
aren't) then funding gaps surely aren't the

reason for a dearth of institutionalized,
socially responsible policies.
My idealistic furor doesn't blind

me

completely. I can play devil's advocate and
ask, "Whoever said colleges were supposed
to be engines of social justice?" And sure,
society doesn't really see social change as
the role of institutions of higher learning,
least of all for historically-elite schools.
College is less about being a portal of access

and empowerment and more about rites of
passage for the already-enabled. In terms of
real education and intellectual ability, we
see college as an end point—the finish line
and the reward—rather than as a place for
continuous growth and realizing untapped
potential; it is certainly not the place for the
systematically disadvantaged to be "caught

up."

But if that's the reality, then why not
just own up to it? Why all this talk of promoting equality and Quaker values, "ethical intelligence," a social conscience? The

October IX 2007

aforementioned conception of a college's
role strikes me as incredibly discordant
with the popular meme of "greater access,"
especially at elite schools like Swat, which
are ostensibly leaders in recruitment initiatives for underrepresented ethnic groups

and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.

From elite, well-endowed institutions, the
posturing around increasing access is particularly confounding, reprehensible even,
when it becomes clear the extent to which
they could be doing more.

Exceptionally wealthy institutions like
Swarthmore deliberately choose not to fund
expanding the enrollment of truly marginalized students, and instead they opt to
enroll the small percentage of marginalized
students that has succeeded despite disadvantages—and will therefore perform once
matriculated. Of course, you incidentally
leave behind the kids who could benefit
most if properly attended: the first-generation college students, the poor kids and a
vast proportion of underrepresented ethnic
groups. Paying to "educate" students that
are easy to educate also incidentally perpetuates your prestige, maintains rankings
and precludes the necessity of funding sub-

stantive support programs.
So now that we're upon the eve of the
next daunting and oh-so-necessary capital
campaign, I've been toying with the idea of
another, much shorter letter, which I
thought would go very differently, maybe

something like this:
"Dear Bill and Melinda, I implore you to
seriously consider establishing an endowment for the purpose of enabling
Swarthmore to grow some balls. (Please
pardon my gendered French.) In this way, I
think the College can finally live up to its
principled foundations, and I really do want
it to become the moral light I know it can
be. Gratefully yours, Y."

RIAA case calls for caution

by

sam

goodman

Bolivia

We're currently riding on the coattails of the digital revolution where
CD Players and VCRs seem like the technologies of an era long gone. Yet
new luxuries also come with new complications: on Oct. 4, Minnesota resident Jammie Thomas was ordered by a federal jury to pay $222,000 for 24
songs she illegally downloaded through the peer-to-peer file sharing service Kazaa. And with RIAA threats to subpoena Swarthmore for the names
of students engaged in illegal file sharing last January, this recent case
should act as wake-up call for those still involved in p2p activities.
The temptations of free and illegal file sharing services are almost

.

undeniable. Services like Kazaa and Limewire open whole libraries of
music, films and software to a public eager to enjoy their contents. Among
reasons that people cite for downloading these files are the hefty costs that
come with brand-name products or the hassle of buying an entire CD only
for one song. The allure of obtaining all of these luxuries without putting
forth any money is, for most, so enticing that they often forget the dangers
of their actions. And, up until recent events, this was understandable and
nearly forgivable.
Although the media repeatedly reported on lawsuits filed by the RIAA
against certain individuals, little was ever known of the results of these
claims. The sheer number of complaints discussed by the media led to the
Peter and the Wolf situation where it seemed as though the RIAA's concerns were fairly innocuous. In those times, there were no blaring headlines or exorbitant fines (say, for the lump sum of $9,250 per song?) to give
peer-to-peer users perspective on how serious their actions were. Even on
Swarthmore's campus, news of the possible subpoenas came and went
with little follow-through. Yet, given the school's relatively trusting policy
regarding file-sharing on campus, the recent verdict in Hammer's trial
calls for more student initiative to ensure that more serious consequences
do not occur here.
As it is, Swarthmore's Information Technology Services has received
complaints from the RIAA citing illegal downloads with requests to forward warnings on to suspected file-sharers on campus based on their IP
addresses. Fortunately, our college has worked so far to protect us from
suffering the same plight as Jammie Thomas, but the responsibility should
really be on ourselves. Rather than block these illegal file-sharing services, as some other institutions have done, our administration has entrusted us with the ability to make our decisions wisely. Although it is easy for
us to fall back on the age-old excuse that we are "poor college students," the
and not worth it.
possible results of doing so could be severe
For example, broadcast and cable networks ranging from ABC to MTV
now offer high-quality, full episodes on their respective websites for viewers to catch up on their popular programming like Grey's Anatomy or The
Hills. Digital music software programs are a viable option. For instance,
Apple's iTunes sells songs for just $0.99 each and movies for $9.99 (less than
buying a DVD). It also regularly has special offers like free episodes of certain television shows. And downloads from iTunes are high-resolution and
can be burned onto DVDs for viewing away from the computer. Even popular DVD rental service NetFlix now offers its members a wide selection
of popular and more obscure movies available for instant watching.
When it comes to downloading files, the administration has put the
power to choose between legality and illegality in our hands. But, as Peter
Parker's uncle says in the film Spiderman, "With great power comes great
responsibility." And though the luxuries we desire might come with a
.
price, it really is money well spent.

Setting aside the fact that Ahmadinejad is

issue was at stake when Columbia invited
Ahmadinejad to speak. The Phoenix correctly
states that Ahmadinejad "had every right to

stood upon a milk crate in the middle of a public forum (say, Central Park) and proclaimed
that the Holocaust did not happen, no one
could have constitutionally stopped him. But
Ahmadinejad had no more "right" to speak at a
podium to a packed lecture hall at Columbia
University than I have. Columbia did not recognize his "right." They granted him a privilege—the privilege of a microphone and an
audience; the privilege of news cameras and
reporters. They enabled a famous Holocaust
denier and homophobic bigot to publicize his
views to as wide an audience as possible, to the
detriment of using their limited resources to
engage in other, productive debates.

As Chief Justice Holmes once
wrote, "[T]he best test of truth
is the power of the thought to
get itself accepted in the
competition of the market."
My argument is not merely semantic, but

goes to the core of the purpose of free speech.
As Chief Justice Holmes once wrote, "[T]he
best test of truth is the power of the thought to
get itself accepted in the competition of the
market." One can legitimately argue that universities ought to make a proactive attempt to
correct inequalities in the "marketplace of
ideas." That is, they should promote the airing

of intelligent opinions that are inherently disadvantaged—the opinions of economic or
racial minorities, for example, who have
unequal access to publicity.
In this situation, there was no marketplace
inequality to correct. Students gained no more
"insight into foreign mindsets" (The Phoenix's
October H 2007

euphemism for "rationalizations of bigotry and
antisemitism") than they would have reading
the regular coverage of Ahmadinejad's speeches in The New York Times.

Columbia University President
Lee Bollinger took the stand
and insulted Ahmadinejad;
Ahmadinejad took the stand
and defended himself.
To say that Columbia's gesture promoted
free speech is another euphemism—Columbia
did not promote free speech but hate speech. If
there was ever a losing thought in the "marketplace of ideas," Holocaust denial is it. Yet,
by granting Ahmadinejad the use of their
space, Columbia lent a veneer of legitimacy to
his position that it did not deserve; they
trumped the established decision of the marketplace to reject such inexcusable views. The
event was characteristic of the American
media's persistent attempts to cover every
argument in the framework of point-counter-

of free speech: the freedom of individuals and
private institutions to say no to certain ideas,
to say that they will not lend them their support, to say that they will not lend them their
credibility.
Columbia could have sparked a "healthy
discourse" about free speech by simply publicizing Ahmadinejad's request to speak on campus along with their official rejection, explaining the reasons for their decision. Of course,

then there would have been fewer protestors
and fewer news cameras, but the campus could
have held a debate on the appropriateness of
the decision nonetheless.
In conclusion, The Phoenix's declaration
that "the opinions of others, no matter how
controversial, must still be respected" is
beyond condemnation. Respect for free speech
does hot deprive society and individuals of the
ability to make moral judgments. Iran's treatment of sexual minorities is a moral abomination.

The Holocaust was a moral abomination.
Holocaust denial is a moral abomination.
There is no debate to be had on these subjects
and no respect to be given to those who insist
otherwise.

Depression not just about numbers

in antidepressant prescriptions and an
increase in suicides. According to Dr.
Thomas R. Ten Have, professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania,
"There doesn't seem to be any evidence of
a statistically significant association
between suicide rates and prescription

JOEL SWANSON

Sound and Fury
Science has taken us all the way to the
moon, but the inner workings of our mind
still remain a mystery.
A study released last week in the
-American Journal of Psychiatry suggests
that scientists may have located two genes
that increase the likelihood that someone
will report suicidal thoughts while taking
antidepressants. The study only involved
one specific antidepressant, Celexa from
Forest Laboratories, and as a result it is
far too early to generalize its findings.
But that will certainly hot stop the
media shitstorm that will inevitably follow from such findings. Because of this,
we may unfortunately attempt to draw

broad conclusions from insufficient data
and forget about the individuals that lie
behind the numbers.
In September, the Center for Disease
Control released somewhat alarming statistics showing that youth suicide rates
rose dramatically in 2004, particularly
among girls. The suicide rate among girls
ages 10 to 14 nearly doubled from 2003,
while the rate for older teenagers
increased by nearly a third. Teenage male
suicide rates saw a more modest increase.
The media response to these findings
was predictable. Countless news sources
speculated that the rise in suicides can be
attributed to new "black box" warnings
that antidepressant use could cause an
increase in suicides. In 2004, the FDA
mandated that these warnings be included
on antidepressants in response to some
questionable and largely inconclusive
studies that showed that some teenagers
were at highest risk for committing suicide for the first few weeks after beginning antidepressant treatment. As a
result,
antidepressant prescriptions
dropped sharply between 2004 and 2005.
Apparently, the black box warnings were
actually counterproductive, because they
discouraged psychiatrists from prescribing these drugs, thus preventing at-risk
youth from receiving the treatment they
needed and actually causing more suicides than were prevented. At least, so the

media narrative goes.
But in truth, the statistics really do not
tell us very much about the best way to
treat depression. There is little data to
support the claim that black box warnings
led to increased suicide rates. Black box
warnings did not emerge until relatively
late in the year in 2004, so it seems unlikely that they could have had a dramatic
impact on antidepressant prescriptions
and suicide rates for that year. In fact, the
rate of antidepressant prescriptions
remained almost constant between 2003
and 2004. It is entirely possible that the
spike in suicides for 2004 is simply an
aberration, and we need to wait until 2005
numbers are released before speculating
about any potential link between a decline

THE PHOENIX

rates provided in the paper."
This has not stopped some psychiatrists from calling for the black box warnings to be removed. The companies that
manufacture antidepressants would naturally like nothing better, as they have
taken a large financial hit due to the
decline in prescription rates that followed
the introduction of the warnings. Indeed,
it is probably not coincidental that Pfizer,
which manufactures the popular antidepressant Zoloft, donated $30,000 to help
cover the cost of a study released in the
September issue of AJP which suggested
that the rise in suicide rates in 2004 is
almost entirely attributable to the warnings. Two of the lead authors of the study,
Dr. Robert Gibbons of the University of
Illinois at Chicago and Dr. John Mann of
Columbia University, have also had extensive dealings with other drug companies
that produce antidepressants. Dr. Mann
has been a paid consultant of the drug
companies Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline,
both of which produce antidepressants,
while Dr. Gibbons was used as an expert
witness by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, which
produces the antidepressant Effexor.

The fact that the media has been so

willing to lend credence to the argument
that the rise in suicides can be linked to

the black box warnings shows both how
sensationalistic it is and how little most
people understand about clinical depression. The original studies released in 2003
and 2004 linking antidepressant use to a
rise in suicide were equally overblown
and misunderstood. If you read the media
coverage of these stories and knew nothing else about depression, you would have
been led to believe that antidepressant
usage itself was the direct cause of these
suicides. But those of us who have actually experienced depression know that the
reality is far different. The rise in suicides
in the first few weeks after beginning antidepressant treatment can be partly attributed to what has been termed the "rollback effect." Because energy levels return
more quickly than positive moods in the
first few weeks of treatment, teenagers
experiencing suicidal ideations who previously may not have had the energy to act
on them suddenly have this energy, which
occasionally leads to disastrous consequences. But the link between antidepressants and suicide is hardly as direct as the
media would have had you believe.
And now we're making the same mistake of drawing too many conclusions
with too little data and too little understanding.
The point is, we really can't make
sweeping generalizations about the best
way to treat depression. Some people
respond better than others to antidepressants. Everyone using these drugs should
be monitored closely to ensure that they
do not attempt suicide. Healing depression
requires compassion, understanding and
an individualized treatment program that
takes into account different needs and
desires. It is extremely difficult to say conclusively what the best way to address
depression is because it depends so much
on the individual person. If we really want
to address increased suicide rates, we
need to recognize this.

Re-evaluating "Stigma"
To the Editor:
I would not have published the statement "I've experienced a lot of stigma
associated with mental illness," for I
would not editorially validate the association of the term "stigma" as you have

elected to do.
What the young woman has experienced are prejudice and discrimination,
concrete terms, addressable and often
legally redressable. She has accepted the
lesson of referencing them as an abstraction, a proven and very powerful
abstraction, a mind game of powerful

psychological proportions.

It would be an interesting editorial

inquiry to discover at Swarthmore how
the above term is employed in curricula.
Are students trained to experience "stig-

ma?" Or refute it?
I am trained to refute it.
As an individual who has experienced severe depression for most of my
adult life, I surrender myself to no one's
prejudices about my illness. Each prejudice and act of discrimination that I
encounter, I address as that, and demand
apology or redress. Under no circum-

stance do I internalize other people's
ignorance, nor do I teach or train other
people to do so.

October U, 2007

I would like to say it is a lesson I
learned myself, but it is not. It is a lesson
I learned from the women's movement:
so long as women could be trained to
internalize the pretense of the "stigma"
of rape, they remained controlled. And in
cultures where women cannot empower
themselves, they do remain controlled.
Where women are self-empowered, they
do not allow the victimization this term
is intended to inflict. Instead, they prosecute people whose physical assault violates their person.
It is my hope that editors at The
Phoenix, Swarthmore College, will far
more carefully examine their employment of this term. "Word is Deed,"
Wittgenstein said, and deeds have consequences. One can strive for positive consequences.

Swat women get back on track
BY CONOR CASEY

ccasey2@swarthmore.edu

After falling to the Johns Hopkins University Blue
a tough, double-overtimeloss, the women's soccer team came roaring back with a decisive 3-0 victory
over the Bryn Mawr College Owls on Saturday.
The game against Johns Hopkins saw the Garnet face
off against the defending conference champions for the
first time since last year's Centennial Conference championship game. Going into the game, Swarthmore was
riding a 7-game winning streak while Hopkins had
already suffered a conference loss, something they had
not experienced all of last year. And though last year the
Blue Jays finished the season with a ranking of Bth in
the country, this year it was the Garnet who entered the
game as the only nationally ranked team in the conference, at 18th overall. If ever a time seemed right for the
Garnet to exact revenge on its conference foe for past
heartbreaks, it was this year.

way, sometimes it does not."
Coach Todd Anckaitis
...

The game was well-played by both teams, with neither side having the clear-cut advantage. At the end of
regulation time, Swarthmore had a meager two shot
advantage on Hopkins, 12-10, but by the end of the full
106-minute game, the shot totals were all knotted up, 1414. Garnet goalie Lauren Walker 'O9 notched a seasonhigh seven saves, having to make more saves in each of
the first and second halves (three), than she had to make
in entire games earlier in the season. Likewise, Blue
Jays goalie Karen Guzkowski made seven saves of her
own, three off the foot of Garnet forward Katie Kanuka
'lO, to keep her team in the game.
The only blemish for either team came 24 seconds
into the game's 107th minute, when Allie Zazzali tapped
in a goal off a pass from teammate Chrissy McCurdy
near the post, winning the game for Johns Hopkins and
ending the marathon match.
After suffering its first loss of the season, the Garnet
rebounded quickly by beating Bryn Mawr, another con-

ference opponent, in its next game. The Garnet offense
pounded the Owl goal mercilessly, getting off 14 shots on
goal, seven in each half, while Bryn Mawr only managed two shots on goal the whole game, both of which
came in the second half.
Although the goals did not come initially for
Swarthmore considering the frequency with which it
attacked the Owl defense, it was only a matter of time
before the Garnet found the back of the net. With just ten
seconds to go before halftime, Sarah Reese 11 broke
through for the Garnet with her first collegiate goal.
The Garnet, however, was not satisfied. Twenty-five

minutes into the second half, Megan Colombo 'll, the
Garnet's points leader, scored off an assist by midfielder
Julia Luongo 'lO to give the Garnet a 2-0 lead. As further
insurance, the first year tandem of Hannah Purkey 'll
and Kelsey Cline 'll combined for Swarthmore's third
goal of the afternoon less than two minutes later. The
goal was Cline's third of the year, good for second on the
team, and Purkey's second assist of the year.
Although players were disappointed with the end
result in the game against Hopkins, they did gain some
important insight from the game, according to midfielder Maggie DeLorme 'lO.
"Hopkins was a good learning experience for us,"
she said. "We took what we learned in the Hopkins game
and implemented it in the Bryn Mawr game."
Melinda Petre 'O9, though disappointed with the
result from the Hopkins game, was proud of how the
team rebounded.
"We played as hard as we could. We were just unlucky
with three minutes left," she said. But "we came back
from a hard loss. The 3-0 win was convincing."
Coach Todd Anckaitis gave credit to the Blue Jays for
a game well played, but acknowledged his disappointment with the loss.
"Obviously it's disappointing to lose in that fashion,"
he said. "The team and coaches feltpretty good going into
overtime, but you've got to give a lot of credit to Hopkins
Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it does not."
After its win against Bryn Mawr, the Garnet trails

play, in the conference standings.

XC takes sixth at Dickinson
BY MELISSA CRUZ
mcruzl@swarthmore.edu
This past Saturday, the Garnet
men's and women's cross country
teams competed at the Dickinson
Long/Short Invitational in Carlisle,
Pa. Both teams raced against various surrounding schools including
Elizabethtown College, Haverford
College, Dickinson College and
Shippensburg University. Despite
the unpleasant weather conditions,
both Garnet teams managed to come
home with a sixth place finish out of
all 21 competing teams.
The women's team was again
guided along the course by Ashley
Davies 10, who completed the 4k
race in 15 minutes and 42 seconds.
Both Davies and Emma Stanley 'O9
raced side-by-side throughought the
entire course, averaging a mile-pace
of 6:19, and landing them with 22nd
and 23rd place finishes out of 169
total women runners. Stanley
crossed the finish line just at Davies'
heel, with a time of 15:43. First-year
Garnet cross country runner Caitlin

Russ'el 11 also wasted no time on the
■ Dickinson Course. Russel ripped
through the race in 15:48, placing
26th overall. Also in the top Garnet

22

women finishers were Kathy Feeney
'O9, who placed fourth on the team
and 31st overall in a swift 16:02. Next
came a ravenous pack of victoryhungry lady Quakers. The gang consisted of Nyika Corbett 'lO (16:11),
Lauren DeLuca 10 (16:12), Bess Ritter
'O9 (16:14) and Ada Okum 'll (16:15).
The ladies took the 40th 43rd places
in the race. The Garnet ladies team
came in sixth place overall, with an
average time of 15:45.
The Swat men were led by Ross
Weller 'OB, who swept the course with
a 15th place finish out of 170 male runners and a remarkable time of 12:47,
averaging a 5:08 mile. Striding right
behind him where Erik Saka 'O9
(13:03) and Mickey Katz 'OB (13:04),
stealing 25th and 27th places, respectively. Patrick Hartnett 11 made sure
he ran in the top five for the Garnet
men and came in 35th overall at 13:09.
The fifth Swat finisher was Jonnie
Tompkins 10, who landed in 41st
place at 13:19. The Garnet guys finished with a sixth place rank out of
-

the 21 teams who competed, their

team averaging at 12:58.
Speaking about the team's
progress, sophomore Corbett said
that, "the team is doing really well,
and we are also really proud of our

freshmen." The women's team has
gained four first-year Swatties this
year, and the men's team has gained
five. Several of these first-year runners are often finishing within the
top-five runners on the teams. "We
are training hard," Ritter said.
Although the raceday weather

conditions were less than favorable,
both teams managed to rise to the
occasion by running hard. "It was
hot, and the ground was hard from

not having rain in such a long time,
so that made things a little difficult.
We still managed to do really well

James Fairfax-Colombo 'lO
said.
The teams have indeed been on
an upward trend of improvement. In
fact, some might even say that they
are doing so well that the runners
themselves even look fabulous. "I
love it when we run by windows.
Our form just looks so great,"
Mickey Katz 'OB said.
The Garnet harriers, in their
though,"

ever-fabulous form, will be racing
again this Saturday as the women
compete at the Seven Sisters
Championships in Wellesley, Ma.,

and the men run the DeSales
University Invitational at Center

Garnet suffers three tough losses
As the Swarthmore women's field hockey team prepared to face Johns Hopkins University on Oct. 3, the
team was 5-3 and looking forward to moving up in the
standings. Now, after three tough losses to Johns
Hopkins, Dickinson College and Alvernia College, the
team is 5-6 and 7th overall in the Centennial Conference.
While currently not in a playoff spot, the team needs to
move up only two spots in five games to secure one.
Last Wednesday, Swarthmore fell to visiting #9 Johns
Hopkins 6-1 Blue Jay Adair Landy had a standout first
half with two goals and an assist, helping her team to a
4-0 lead by halftime. The Garnet's Natalie Stone 'O9 oepned the second half scoring, putting in her ninth goal of
the season in the 36th minute. But Hopkins responded
with two more goals to finish up the match. With the
Blue Jays out-shooting the Garnet 25-9, Garnet goalie
Katie Ashmore 'll was busy in the net, recording 10
saves.

Following the match with Johns Hopkins,
Swarthmore looked to rebound against Centennial opponent Dickinson on Saturday, October 6th. After
Dickinson took a 2-0 lead, Garnet midfielder Joslyn
Young 10 tipped in a shot from Jordan Schmidt 'O9 to
make it 2-1 heading into halftime.
The Garnet continued its push in the second half, as
Abbie Fischer 'OB put in another shot from Schmidt to
tie the game at 2-2. But the Red Devil's Megan Kelly single-handedly put Dickinson on top 4-2, scoring her
fourth and fifth goals of the season. Ashmore recorded 6
saves for Swarthmore in the match.
The Garnet looked to salvage the week with a win
over Alvernia at home on Monday night. The match was
controlled by each team's defense. After the first half,
the two teams were locked at 0-0. In the second half,
Alvernia managed to break the scoring drought. The
Crusaders' Christy Yousaitis put back a rebound in the
44th minute, and it proved to be the only goal of the
match, as Alvernia ended up beating Swarthmore 1-0.
Looking ahead to its final five games, the Garnet has
its work cut out for it as it pushes for the playoffs. After
playing in a game last night against Muhlenberg
College, Swarthmore will host #1 Ursinus College at
7:3opm on Wednesday.

Volleyball preps for deciding matches after loss to Jays
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

After falling to 2-3 in the conference with a loss against a
talented Johns Hopkins University team on Saturday, the
women of the Garnet volleyball team have their work cut
out for them. Four conference matches remain before the
playoff spots are set in stone, and three out of those four will
be against teams that are currently ahead of Swarthmore in
the standings.
Though the loss was a disappointing one for the Garnet,
they did not go down to the Blue Jays without a fight.
Swarthmore entered the game with confidence, coming off
a 30-26, 30-20, 30-20 sweep of Bryn Mawr two days before.
During the match, the Garnet women were also raising
money for breast cancer research, as part of the Digging for
the Cure event that the entire conference was participating
in this year.
Players received pledge money for the Digging for the
Cure cause per dig, and the total amount of money raised in
the conference will be announced at the championship later
this season.
"I thought we played really well against Bryn Mawr,"
Erin Heaney 'O9 said. "I was really proud that we were able
to set the pace. We came through the door and played our
game." Despite the loss to the Blue Jays, "It was really cool
that we were participating in something bigger than ourselves," she said.
Swarthmore held pace with the Blue Jays out of the
gates, keeping the first game close early on and earning an
early 8-7 lead. After three consecutive Garnet errors, however, the Blue Jays responded quickly, jumping out to a 2412 advantage behind strong serving. Despite kills by
Vanessa Wells 'OB, Kearney Bangs 'lO and Katherine Gold
'OB, Hopkins managed to hold on for the runaway win in the
first game, 30-16.
The fate was the same for Swarthmore in the second
game of the match, as the Jays hung to a small lead early on
but shut the door on the Garnet on a run that took them
from a 12-11 lead to a 19-13 advantage. Swarthmore could
never make up the difference, coming within 24-20 but then
surrendering the next three points to the Jays and ulti-

mately falling, 30-22.
The Blue Jays put the nail in the coffin in the third game,
opening a quick 7-2 lead and never looking back, as they
recorded 15 kills on only three errors to take the 30-17 win
and earn the sweep over the Garnet. Sophomore Allison
Cappelaere led the way for Hopkins with eight service
errors and 12 kills in addition to first-year Natalia
Fijalkowski's 13 kills. Wells was the sole Swarthmore athlete with kills in the double digits, recording 11, while
Heaney led the team with 20 digs out of a total of 67.

Erin Heaney makes one of the Garnet's 67 total digs in Swarthmore's match against Johns Hopkins on Saturday.
"Hopkins is the best I've seen Hopkins since I've been
here," coach Harleigh Leach said. In terms of the rest of the
season, the team is working on the mental aspect of the
game as much as it is on its skills. "We need to keep working on being diligent and prepared," she said. "We constantly work on the little things that are our primary skill
focus so that we can put forth a consistent effort every time
we step on the court."
Swarthmore players have also seen improvement in
some areas of the team's game that give them high hopes for

October 13, 2007

the rest of the season. "I think our defense was great in the
Hopkins game," Gold said. "Hopefully our defense will stay
up at the place where it is and the offense will just catch up."
After a game last night against Muhlenberg College,
Swarthmore will face off in two big conference matches in
the next week. On Saturday, the Garnet will travel to
Gettysburg College to face the Bullets, owners of a 3-1 conference record as of Wednesday, and then on Thursday Oct.
18 Swarthmore will host Ursinus College, 1-5 in the stand-

ings.

Garnet men spice up their training with Budokon
BYGENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

Strength, flexibility, and mental focus are all essential
aspects of training that every team works to develop during
the season, hoping they can count on these attributes in key
moments in big games. Most squads rely on practice drills
and lifting sessions to build these components of their game,
but this year the Garnet men's soccer team has taken a new
**

approach to its preparation by adding a unique training
method to its usual repertoire Budokon.
The team has been practicing this form of martial art in
weekly 75-minute sessions with the owners of Enso, a new
studio in Media. "[Gwen Soffer] and Adam Marcus started
their business this fall and in anticipation of that they asked
me if we wouldn't be interested in working with them," said
Coach Eric Wagner, who is friends with Soffer's husband. "I
was a bit skeptical at first because during our season we
have a lot of things we have to cover." But he decided to talk
with Soffer and Marcus, and later invited them for a trial
session with him and a few players that were at
Swarthmore during the summer. "I was so impressed immediately with the value that I saw in the actual exercise that
they presented to me that I decided to try it out myself," he
said. When he tried it with the players, "we were all very
impressed that it was [relevant to soccer]." The rest of the
team was introduced to Budokon during preseason, and
apparently enjoyed it so much that Wagner scheduled sessions for the rest of the season, and many players are hoping to continue practicing during the offseason as well.
According to Marcus, the team's primary instructor,
Budokon is "a fusion of yoga, martial arts and meditation
It takes these different concepts and brings them together
into one art form," he said. Each time the team practices
Budokon, its session is made up of these three aspects.
...

"We do the mental meditation part and then we do

stretching and yoga exercises," Garnet forward Ladule
Lako LoSarah 'O9 said. Finally, the team does "movement
exercises," in which they travel across the floor, imitating
the body movements of different animals. "One of the
favorites is the komodo dragon," Lako LoSarah said. This
exercise incorporates push-up like movements that alternate from side to side as players move across the floor.
One of the reasons the team has responded so well to the
practice is that it is a total body strength exercise
that players don't have access to in other aspects of their
training. "The guys really enjoy the fact that it is a strength
workout but it is very challenging because it's a different

skill," Wagner said. Evan Nesterak 'O9 agreed. "[Budokon]
keeps you fresh because you're having to use your muscles
in a different way, and that can translate out to the field," he

said.
"Budokon is all about reconnecting with your body
movements and moving with the fullest potential that you
have," Marcus said. "It really develops incredible full body
strength because what you end up doing is drawing upon a
whole host of muscles in your body."
The team says the workouts primary target core muscles, focusing on total body flexibility and stabilization.
However, more than the physical benefits the men have
seen from the exercises, the team appreciates the mental
components of the practice and how they can translate to

their play.

"The mental aspect I think is the most important," Lako
LoSarah said. "It helps you situate yourself in the moment,
which I think is very important for soccer." He gave the
example of being in a goal-scoring opportunity, and how
that mental focus can prevent even the briefest lapse of
attention that could ruin the play. "If you're completely, sin-

gularly focused on that one moment to put the ball in the

goal, it really helps," he said.
Wagner emphasized the importance of the mental part of

the training as well. With all of the pressures on
Swarthmore students, he said, "you can easily get distracted
We're trying to get the guys to stay focused for an
entire training session or an entire season or an entire
match."
The Budokon sessions have also been a source of team
bonding for the squad, as it is an activity that the players
look forward to every week. "The guys at first kind of
laughed about it," Lako LoSarah said. "But I think the guys
are really starting to like it now and are really starting to
see its benefits."
Wagner recounted a bus trip back from a game against
St. Mary's College, when the team pulled into Swarthmore
at I:4sam after having slept for most of the trip back. "Just
as were pulling in I mention, 'Don't forget, tomorrow we
have Budokon,'" he said, "And immediately the entire bus
erupted in
'Yes! Budokon!' I think we have a winner

Juventus. Last week marked the
conclusion of the second groupstage matches, characterized by a
few interesting upsets. Liverpool,
the 2005 European champions, lost
by a goal to French strugglers
Marseille at home, while Scottish
clubs Glasgow Celtic and Rangers
authored two memorable results,
the former defeating 2007
European champions AC Milan
and the latter demolishing French
champion Lyon three goals to nil
away.

Despite these three remarkable
upsets,
however, a certain
Brazilian stole the media spotlight
for the week. Dida, AC Milan's
goalkeeper, flaunted his Oscarinspiring acting abilities by collapsing from a slight touch on the

shoulder by an overjoyed Celtic
fan.

So here is the situation: Dida,
following another poor performance between the posts, conceded a
90th minute game winner to
Celtic's Scott McDonald. During
the Celtic players' ecstatic celebrations, an overexcited fan somehow
managed to run on to the field. He
then proceeded to run at Dida, tap
(this is not an exaggeration of the
term) the big Brazilian on the
shoulder; say a few words of
'encouragement' and run off into
the wilderness.
Initially, it seemed as though
Dida was going to run after the
impish fan, before suddenly collapsing on the floor holding a spot
at least five inches higher than
where he was touched. Then, to
add to the comic nature of this
October H 2007

event, Dida gets stretchered off the
field!

This was, by far, the funniest
and most ridiculous scene I'd ever
seen in a football match. Should I
call this "bold" behavior? Maybe
he just has no pride. Or maybe, as
Dutch teammate Clarence Seedorf
said in a post-match interview,
Dida was suffering from "shock" at
being touched by a fan. This is an
interesting, albeit totally unconvincing explanation. How on earth
would anyone fall to the floor in
"shock" following a tap on the neck
by a short, hobbit-like fan, especially

if six-foot-five with a scary-

looking face? The more convincing
explanation for Dida's play-acting
was that he was the object of another, much more severe attack, when
a projectile fired from the stands
hit him during a match against

local rivals Inter Milan, after
which his side was awarded a victory. Dida probably thought, especially upon conceding

the winning

goal against a Scottish side that

has

never

been

past

the

Champions League's round of 16,

that perhaps his comical lastminute acting performance could
lead the authorities to intervene
and award AC Milan a victory. To
his dismay, however, Celtic ended
the match triumphant.
Dida deserves to be punished
for his ridiculous antics. Football
is for footballers, not underperforming goalkeepers who have a
penchant for Oscar-inspiring acting. When players pull a Dida, or
feign injury, they are only adding
to the ugly aspect of the "beautiful
game." If he had gone to the referee in protest, instead of rolling on
the ground, AC Milan could have
gained something from the match
authorities. Due to Dida's comical
acting displays, however, Milan
refused to press charges against
Celtic, and UEFA, the European
football authority, is considering
disciplinary action against the
Brazilian shot-stopper. Let this be
a4esson to all footballers: acting is
for actors, leave the "beautiful
game" alone.
