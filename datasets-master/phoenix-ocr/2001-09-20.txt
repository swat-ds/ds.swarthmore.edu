Students abroad cope
with national tragedy
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
While students on campus sat glued to the television last week, the office
of foreign study prepared to contact the nearly 100 Swarthmore students
currently studying abroad, anxious to make sure everything in their host
countries and programs was still running smoothly and hoping to help
them cope with a national tragedy without the familiar comforts of home.
According to Steve Piker, foreign study adviser, there are 94 students
scheduled to participate in the Swarthmore study abroad program this
semester. Piker said that 89 of these students are at their destinations, safe
and well. The remaining five are enrolled in programs that have not yet

minors from the borough of
Swarthmore were arrested and cited for consuming alcoholic beverages after entering a party
thrown by the Ultimate Frisbee teams at Paces on
Sept. 7.
Though team members were at the door serving as Party Associates, they failed to check for
identification, according to tri-captain John

Anderson 'O3.
As a result, the deans have told the teams that
they can hold no more parties for the rest of the
frear. Also, every team member, both men and
jwomen, must undergo PA training and volunteer
as PAs at two campus parties this year. Tedd
Goundie, dean of student life, declined to comjttient, saying he did not feel confident offering a
statement on the matter at this time.

The Swarthmore Police Department, in
[response to a complaint by one of the teenager's
parents, is conducting an ongoing investigation,

The minors, one of whom was 14 and the two
pthers 16, were identified as non-college students

would not specify who identified the juveniles, he
paid that once notified that the minors were not
college students, the team immediately called

'Someone recognized them as people who

py

he said.

Owen Redgrave, director of public safety, said
Swarthmore police picked up the call on their
radio scanners, and chose to come and arrest the
juveniles on their own accord.
"To the best of my knowledge, we did not notify them," he said. "It's not our policy to notify
them."
The police however claim public safety called
and notified the department, prompting its
response to the incident. Sergeant Raymond
Stufflet said authorities took the juveniles from
the party to the borough station, where

Breathalyzer tests were administered. After police
determined each minors' blood alcohol content
was above the legal limit, all three were cited for
underage drinking.

As a consequence of their actions, Stufflet said
each of the teens could face a 90-day suspension of
his or her driver's license, along with $25 to $350
in fines plus court costs, time spent performing
community service, and attendance at alcoholawareness classes.
Swarthmore Police Chief Brian Craig said that
the Frisbee teams could face additional legal
action, outside of the college's punishment, based
on a complaint from one of the juvenile's parents.
"One of the parents was highly upset that [the
minors] gained admission, and we're pursuing the
investigation based on this complaint," he said.

started, but Piker said all five planned to continue with their study abroad
plans as scheduled.
Two students are scheduled to study at universities in the Middle East:
one in Turkey and one in Cairo, Egypt.
In addition to these 94 students, there are also other students, not counted in this number, who have decided to take a semester or year off in order
to study at an international location of their choice without receiving

Swarthmore credit.
Piker said the college has sent a letter to all of the students currently
enrolled at Swarthmore who are studying abroad, inquiring about their
welfare and urging them to contact the college with any questions, concerns or problems they may have. In addition, Piker said staff at the office
of foreign study have been in contact with all the programs in which students are enrolled to make sure everything is running smoothly. The staff
is also closely monitoring the Foreign Study Network, which provides
information on the approximately 125,000 American students who are currently studying abroad.
Piker said he was unable to comment on whether any students currently abroad would need to return home. "The situation we're in is likely to
continue for a long, long time. At this point I don't think anybody is able to
tell where this is going," he said.
"So far no one has seen that students are in danger," Piker said. During
the Gulf War some specific threats were made against American students
abroad, but so far Piker said he's heard of nothing similar in the present situation.
Piker said he did not recall any time in the history of Swarthmore's
study abroad program when a student has had to return home due to conflict in the country they were studying in. He did say that several years ago
the office of foreign study told a student who was accepted to a program
that he would not be able to attend due to social and political problems present in the destination country. He added that, normally, if an area were not
safe, the foreign study program would, itself, close down. He referred to a
few programs in Indonesia that did not run this year due to instability.
Though students abroad may be safe, many of them are experiencing difficulty in obtaining information about the events of last week and in coping
with the tragedy far away from their families and friends.
Payal Shah 'O3, who is currently studying in Beijing, China, said that the
censorship imposed in China has somewhat prohibited her access to information about the events. "Access to the most legitimate sites is blocked, so
I learned about the terrorist attacks mostly from all of the e-mails and IMs
[sent by friends and family at home]," Shah said.
Once she learned of the attacks, however, Shah said she had difficulty
coping with what happened at home while immersed in a different culture.
"The American students in the Chinese dorms spent most of last night [the
night after the attacks] huddled around the few TVs that were able to get
access to news stations I have never wished to understand Chinese more
than I had last night," she said. "Thankfully, the students from our university were extremely willing to come and help us translate, which made trying to understand what was happening much easier."
"It's just so hard to picture what is going on there and to deal with the
amazing loss oflife when life is functioning normally around you," she said.
The situation is very different for those students who are located in
more underdeveloped regions, such as Liz Brainard 'O3, who is studying in
Kenya. "Liz has no access to e-mail or phone," said Elizabeth Lindsay 'O2,
"and she only has one mail stop on Oct. 1L I don't know if she knows about
the World Trade Center events yet."

Student's host family celebrates in Jordan
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
While Americans mourn the catastrophe of last
Tuesday and wonder, distressed, what life changes it will
bring, Paul Wulfsberg 'O3, who is currently taking classes
at a university in Amman, Jordan,

described a situation in which his host

family openly celebrated the attacks on

America.

"Mostly, my host family has been
wonderful to me, and I've never felt
uncomfortable here, except for the day
of the attacks, when my two older [host]
brothers, Mahir and Ziad, were both celebrating that afternoon
when the
news was just coming in on CNN.
Several other young men stopped by to
happily greet and hug my [host] brothers, openly rejoicing in America's downfall, but occasionally giving me sympathetic or mildly embarrassed looks,
since they knew I was American,"
Wulfsberg said via e-mail.
But Wulfsberg was quick to point out
that celebration in Jordan was limited.
Even his host family was sobered, he
said, when they heard of the massive

Jordan, perhaps more than nine out of every 10 people,
viewed the attacks as a tragedy and prayed that a
Palestinian, Arab or Islamic group would not be found
responsible.
Wulfsberg said that, in Jordan, the majority of the celebrations were confined to a "small
minority of the Palestinian refugee
majority, and even then more in
refugee camps than in richer neighborhoods like my [host] family's."
Despite Wulfsberg's encounters
after the terrorist attack in America,
he said he still feels relatively safe.

"Amman and all of Jordan is very
safe," he said, "safer than anywhere
in the United States. I am worried
about reactions to a potential war in
Afghanistan, as well as the increased
bombardments in Palestine and Iraq

...

now."

Wulfsberg also said he felt no
strong anti-American sentiment
directed toward him. "People here

love Americans and the United
States, only hating our Middle
Eastern policy, and are easily able to

distinguish between American peobloodshed involved in the attacks. "My

"On Tuesday, they argued that Americans feeling the

pain of thousands of their own dead would lead to a serious reassessment of their economic, diplomatic and military support of the Israeli apartheid-style state which
would have never come into being without Washington,"
Wulfsberg said.
Ben Schweigert 'O2, who studied at Bir Zeit University
near Ramallah in the West Bank from August to December
of 2000, said he encountered similar views during his time
in the Middle East. "I encountered almost no sentiment
against myself or the American people," Schweigert said.
However, "There was substantial opposition to particular

American policies."
Schweigert said he believed such sentiments would
continue as long as American policies in the Middle East
remain unchanged.
"Unless the Bush administration wants to ensure
more attacks of a similar nature, he must immediately
rework the American foreign policy in the [Middle East]
region that drives people to this level of desperation,"
Schweigert said. "As long as our government pursues
policies that show disdain for Middle Eastern cultures
and the lives of Middle Eastern people, then we can be
assured that individuals will arise in the Middle East
who will be willing to perpetrate such actions as what

happened on Tuesday."
In particular, Schweigert pointed out that the Middle
Eastern population, and in particular the Palestinians, are
"more cosmopolitan and media-sawy" because they watch

many American news sources, such as CNN.
"Consequently, they know the way in which they are
presented in the Western media: a way they perceive as
uninformed at best and racist at worst," Schweigert said.
Wulfsberg offered a similar criticism of the
American media and expressed a similar view on the
need for a re-evaluation of US policies in the Middle
East. "I wish the attacks could have at least provoked a
serious discussion of American foreign policy, as the
American media we've seen here has simply immediately dismissed claims of American and Israeli injus
tice as the ranting of anti-Semites or irrational religious fanatics."

Staff committee tackles ongoing wage issues

with reviewing their own compensation system have been on a
tight schedule over the summer
and plan to present their preliminary findings at the end of the

Mingledoff advocates education or training as a solution. "It's

She shared anecdotes of former

Some staff were not inclined to

"Whatever they want, they pay

Other staff members believed
the college owes them more and
that full-time employees deserve

Concern and
critique in the
wake of attacks
BY ELANA RAKOFF
"My dad said, 'Make sure you're careful,'" recalled Chirag Chotalia 'O4, president
of Swarthmore's South Asian group Deshi, at
Tuesday's fireside chat. "And I was just

going into Philadelphia."
Several people nodded. When Student
Council co-president Anna Woodiwiss 'O2,

one of the leaders of the SC/Deshi forum,
asked for personal reflections on what last
week's events could mean for people ofArab
and South Asian descent, the response was
swift.

Many were worried about the growing
discrimination against people of Middle
Eastern descent, and felt that George
Bush's "rhetorical absolutism," as Dann
Naseemullah 'O2 put it, was leading to
more division than unity among

Americans.
"Can Americans re-affirm their identity
by ignoring other people?" asked one student.

Many students recounted incidents
of hatred toward the Middle Eastern
community in the last few days and
blamed the media for stereotyping the
terrorists as "scary Muslim men with
beards," as one person remarked. For
example, most people had seen a video
of Palestinians cheering over the
deaths played over and over again.
Others disliked the epithets the
media attached to the terrorists, such as
"cowards."
Most also agreed that Americans are particularly vulnerable to the media's distortions because of a general lack of understanding about foreign policy.
Political science professor Steve Hopkins
summed up the difficulties: "How does one
develop a discourse about public culpability
without demeaning the deaths?"
Despite these concerns, most people were
fairly hopeful that they could help change
the situation.
Cindhy Briano 'O2 said, "Just talk. Talk to
your little brother, sister, cousin, whoever."
Others mentioned writing to one's representative or local newspaper.

Inn still uncertain, proposal moving forward
BY IVAN BOOTHE
The college's proposal for an inn and restaurant is moving
forward in both borough and college arenas, but the project's
resolution is still not certain. Since hearing from a developer in

July, the borough council has asked its planning commission to

examine the issues ofland use in the proposal, which is tentatively set for building on the college's athletic fields south of the
train station. At the same time, the borough is focusing most of
its energy, as well as two new employees, on traffic issues and
merchant concerns.
The original idea for an inn and a restaurant came out of a
plan to spur borough revitalization, which formed several years
ago after input from borough residents and from Swarthmore
College. That plan called for, among several other things, a hotel
or inn and a restaurant to help the revitalization of the lagging
economy in the commercial district of Swarthmore borough.
Because of the lack of space, the plan recommended building the
inn on college property between the SEPTA train station and the

moved to contact a developer, Haverford Hotel Partners, to begin
working on the hotel project.
Last May, a referendum narrowly passed in the borough,
allowing the serving of liquor in a restaurant 'ton property
owned by an accredited college or university." In July,
Haverford Hotel Partners gave a presentation to the borough
council, in which they described the likely size and structure of
the hotel. They proposed an inn with about 80 rooms and a large

restaurant.
Jay Shoemaker, the chair of the borough's planning commission, said that "lots of local people came, there were some very
well-placed questions, and, in general, the information was well

received."
But the developer will have to face some economic questions,
Jane Billings, the borough manager, said. "If 80 rooms is considered by some in the public body as being too big, can [the
developer] make a go of it with 60? I don't think the college has
any interest in underwriting an unsuccessful venture," she
said.

At their "Jersey Party" last Saturday, Delta Upsilon initiated a policy of stationing members at the entrance to the
party to check guests for ID cards to ensure that they were
from Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr or Haverford Colleges. In
addition, if a guest's ID said he or she was under 21, that
person's hand was given a mark indicating thery were not

to be served alcohol.
According to DU president Randy Keim 'O2, the fraternity's new policy was not in response to the incident at the
Frisbee team party. "We made it our policy at the end of
the year last year," he said. "I think it worked out well."
Frisbee playerss, meanwhile, were pleased the college's
punishment was not as severe as it could have been.
"We're really lucky to not have a big fine or have our
funding taken away," said Alison Landrey 'O4, a member of
the Warmothers, the women's Frisbee team. "We're going
to take it seriously."
"At least it's constructive," Stephanie Wojtkowski 'O2
said, who believed a fine would have been both harmful

and ineffective.
Patrick Hagan 'O2, another captain of the men's team,
said that any monetary fines imposed could have been
very detrimental to the team's survival. Though fully
funded by the Student Budget Committee, Hagan said his

team always strains to obtain transportation to away
games, some of which are played as far away as North

Carolina. He added that students often fund their own uniforms, and frisbees and other necessary supplies are paid
for through partie"s. Though he would not say why, Hagan
did mention that the team is already financially strained.
"The Frisbee team is already, due to complications, in a
bit of a jam budgetarily," he said. "From my conversations

Art history program
replenishes its faculty
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

Over the past year, the art history section of the art department
was plagued by instability. With
three professors leaving the college last spring, the department
faced a shortage of teachers and a
decrease in student interest.
However, with the addition of
two new professors and six new
classes, the art history program
has found some much needed sta-

Despite the addition of these
two new professors, "we definitely saw enrollment go down this
semester," Meunier said, explaining that this year marked the
first time he could remember

when certain classes did not need
lotteries for enrollment.
Art history major Claire
Hoverman 'O3 also noticed the
lack of interest in art history
among Swarthmore students. "I
think some art history majors

went abroad this semester
because of the new teachers,"
she said. "However, it's not the
students' fault that the professors left, and it's not the department's fault, so there's not
much we can do about it."
In the end, students and faculty associated with the art
department believe the change

will be for the best.
Meunier said the new teachers provide the art history

department with two new specialties, ancient art and modern
art.
But Graybill's resignation
caused the department to lose a
specialist in Asian art, and
Meunier is still searching for
an expert in that field. "Once we
hire an Asianist, we will be
completely stable with even
more course offerings," he said.
Meunier hopes to find a replacement by the spring.

College and ville work to improve business
BY JARED LENOW

Local store owners and the architects of tomorrow's
"Friday Night in the Ville" hope an evening of music, art
and late-night shopping will draw students to a community that many of them have written off as boring and unaccomodating to students.
Besides the planned activities, Friday night will offer
members of the college community a chance to use their
new "Ville Discount Cards," which appeared in student,
staff and faculty mailboxes this morning. Student council
mounted the discount card project as a way to increase the
college's connection with the town.
Organizers are looking to attract between three and
four hundred people to the event and are hoping a sizable
portion will be students.
"Originally, it was just going to be that the stores were
open late," said Abbe Harms, of Fine Garden Creations.
"But I thought that was kind of boring. We decided to make
it more interesting and to really do something that would
include the whole community, especially the students."
Many ville business owners see the events as a way for
community members to get their minds off the tragic
events that occurred last Tuesday.
"It won't be as festive," said Jack McDonnell, of
Michael's College Pharmacy, "but I think more people will
come down because of the tragedy. It's a chance to get out
and give people something else to think about."
"The emotional climate ofAmerica right now isn't very
festive, and we're going to try to address that through the
music," Harms, who is a member of the Swarthmore
Business Development Authority, said.
"I don't even live here, so my enthusiasm is because I
think it can work, not just because I live here and want a
better town."
The event, organized by Student Council and the
Swarthmore Business Development Authority, will run
from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. tomorrow, rain or shine, and will feature a number of college musical groups, including Sixteen
Feet, Jealousy Function and Mixed Company. Also featured will be the Jesters juggling troupe, a visual arts con-

test, a "show your ink" tattoo contest and a display of
artist, actor, filmmaker, playwright and puppeteer Ted
Harris' work in Borough Hall, as well as an outdoor art
sale, an informal window decorating contest and a sidewalk art challenge.
Student Council sponsored the new discount card program, while the Swarthmore Business Development
Authority and the college administration split the $3,000
price tag. The card provides special deals, freebies, and dis-

counts from 10 to 50 percent off at 26 of the ville's 41 busi-

nesses.
"Almost every business we approached that could conceivably offer something that students want offered something," said Lauren Tobias, council co-president. "I think
that shows that people in the ville are interested in student
business."
The idea for a "Friday Night at the Ville" and a discount
card first came up last year at a meeting between students
and town officials who wanted to improve student/borough relations, following a series of articles in The
Phoenix that branded the business district a "21st century
ghost town," according to then-editor Justin Kane 'O2, who
attended some of the meetings.
Few students interviewed thought the card or tomorrow's activities would dramatically change the relationship between Swarthmore students and the town's business district, though many appreciated the gesture.
"I really don't think the ville has much to offer students," said Alex Black 'O4, who goes in to town once or

twice a month. "I doubt the discount card or the 'Night in
the Ville' will attract many more students. Why would I
want to go to the ville when I can go to Baltimore Pike just
as easily? Some of the discounts they're offering on the
card aren't even new," he pointed out.
Joon Suk Choi 'O2 visits the town more frequently,
about three of four times a week, but only to pick up ciga-

rettes at the pharmacy.
"They're just not willing to accommodate us," he said.
"Sometimes I'll stop by some of the stores, but it's just not
a college town. A couple of small discounts aren't going to
change that."
Other students agreed that a little more exposure and
some discounts won't substantially pique students' interests.

"I think the problem with the ville is more selection
than it is price," Peter Wirzbicki 'O4 said. "I think most
people have the impression that the ville is this boring,

suburban town that doesn't cater to their interests. This
must be the only college town in America that doesn't have
a cool CD store in it."

But merchants say students write the ville off unfairly,
either because they've never actually explored what it has
to offer or because they expect too much from a small town
with a small college community.
"Sometimes kids don't come down here until their junior year," McDonnell said. "We've got a great community
here, and I don't think the students even know it. The discount card and Friday night's activities will hopefully
bring students down, and they can see what we have to

offer."
Gail Gaustad of T. Bumble's agrees that most students
don't give the shops a chance.
"One time, a senior came down and asked me if there
was anywhere to buy flowers," she said, gesturing toward
the Swarthmore Flower and Gift Shop only six stores
down.
"I think it remains to be seen whether the card and the
activities on Friday night will have an effect," she said. "1
hope it will make students more aware of the number and
variety of stores we have."

College plans for

'multicultural dean'

DJ Kevin Bovard hosts his WSRN music show last April in Studio A. According to some new WSRN board
members, DJs may be getting more comprehensive training this semester than they have before.

WSRN sets policy for coming semester
BY IVAN BOOTHE
After the abrupt resignation of its general manager this summer, WSRN's board members, including a newly hired general manager, have taken steps
to improve Swarthmore's campus radio station by
instituting new policies in training and studio security. Following a training session for the board and
one for newly accepted DJs, the station is planning
to begin broadcasting Sunday evening.
The WSRN board elected Tamara Manik-Perlman
'O2, previously the station's programming director,
as the general manager for this semester. But ManikPerlman "at the last minute decided to take the
semester off," said Drew Adams 'O3, co-director of the
rock department. Michael
Spiegel 'O3, folk department
director, said that, because of
the incident, the station was
"a week behind."

"We want everybody to be versed in the whole

Galynker said. "We will be offering Studio B training for everyone," Spiegel said. "It's just a matter of
getting ourselves organized."
Adams, however, didn'tforesee Studio B training
for all DJs in the future. "The training for DJs is
more limited to Studio A, and then Studio B as they
request it," he said.

A sporadic, decade-long quest to secure a full-time associate
dean of multicultural affairs may finally come to fruition by the end
of the fall semester. A hiring committee is set to begin wading
through over 150 applications for the position, and it hopes to select
a candidate who will arrive for the spring term.
The committee had planned to secure the new dean for the current semester, but it "ran out of time," Dean of the College Bob
Gross said, because it "wanted to make sure that students had an
opportunity to meet the finalists." The search committee, which
includes four students, three faculty members and two deans, has
met once this semester.
The college seeks someone who will head Swarthmore's "comprehensive effort" to achieve a "culturally pluralistic campus"
through inventive programming, supervision of campus cultural
groups and their leaders, and personal consultation and counseling
for students, an official advertisement said.
Lester Tran 'O4, who is on the hiring committee, said an ideal
candidate would be a former student activist, "someone who's
already done what we hope to do." Tran's involvement in advocating the hiring of the "multicultural dean" began last fall, when he
spearheaded the resurrection of the search with members of
ADVICE (Advocating Diversity and a Variety of Ideologies in a
College Environment), a nexus of racial, ethnic, gender-based and
religious support group representatives.
Other priorities for the search should include a wide range of experience with students of multiple "minorities," including disabled and
queer students and women, said Karima Wilson 'O3, a member of
ADVICE and Multi. Wilson also suggested that the new dean hold the
responsibility of 'analyzing systemic oppression on campus."
Anna Morgan 'O4, a hiring committee member who has been in
ADVICE since last year, has continually stressed the need for the

new dean to bring multiculturalism to those students who do not
consider themselves a member of a particular minority group.
At a meeting of ADVICE on Sunday, members and visiting students agreed that improving multicultural programming, counseling students on cultural issues and uniting the campus were top
priorities.
Although deans generally deal with student life while the
provost handles academic affairs, the want ad for the "multicultural dean" states that the dean will "consult with faculty on pedagogical and curricular issues."
Elinore Kaufman 'O4 pointed out that "students do have needs
relating to the faculty" and that dealing with professors can be
"very important when we're talking about curricular issues."
The faculty must respect whomever is hired to ensure response

to the new dean's effort to improve students' academic experiences,
Wilson said. Those students who have involved themselves with the
push for a dean of multicultural affairs feel that, since they rallied
for the new dean themselves, a candidate's goals and experiences
relating to student life should receive higher priority than those

relating directly to academics.
The quest to fill the position began in 1991, when students lent
support to the dean of the college in hiring an associate dean of
multicultural affairs. Following the opening of the Intercultural
Center in 1993, the administration created and filled a half-time
position for the "multicultural dean," a post that was abandoned
two years later. The college then began a search for a candidate who
would act as both associate dean of multicultural affairs and director of the Intercultural Center, but canceled it when Anna Maria
Cobo was hired as IC director and as an assistant dean
not a
in 1996.
"multicultural dean"
After a vandalism incident at the IC in 1998, a student group
charged with promoting multiculturalism included the hiring of a
new dean in its goals. A third search started and stopped again in
the summer of 1999, and the "multicultural dean" issue languished
until last fall, when ADVICE made it a goal to secure the deans'
agreement to launch another search.
Following the elimination of 50 candidates, the hiring committee
will rank the remaining applicants, then interview 12 to 15 on the
phone, Tran said. Two to four candidates will actually visit the campus, where senior staff, faculty and students will interview them.

Launch postponed;
capital campaign

to proceed
BY ALEXIS REEDY
Although the on-campus launch of Swarthmore's
imminent capital campaign has been indefinitely
postponed, the campaign itself will continue
"through a series of regional and on-campus events,"
President Al Bloom said in a written statement.
"We are going to have a campaign," said Maurice
Eldridge, vice president of college and community
relations. "We may try to have something in the

spring, although nothing has been set up yet."
The launch, originally scheduled for this weekend, has been put off due to last week's attacks, said
Dan West, vice president for alumni development
and public relations. John Malcolm, director of
development, stressed last week that the launch has
been "postponed, but not canceled."
The college had originally expected more alumni
to attend the event, Eldridge said. The wooden platform that was being built was designed to hold about
600 people, while only between 250 and 300 people had
made reservations for the launch.
The events of last Tuesday would have lowered
attendance even further, West said. "People may not
be able to come or feel that they should not come," he
said. The college also "wanted to do something symbolic to demonstrate that we were thinking about the
victims and their loved ones," he said.
West also said the launch organizers "know of at
least two dozen people working in the twin towers
and at least one dozen working in the Pentagon."
"Given the high death toll expected, we decided that

it didn't seem right to continue with the launch."
The launch event was slated to include a banquet
diner and movie in Lang Performing Arts Center as
well as the construction of a wooden platform and
tent on Parrish beach.
Construction workers tore down what already
existed of the partially built structure following the
attacks last Tuesday. The college lost some money
having the tent taken down, West said, but some of it
may be recouped if the tent is installed at a later
date.
"We might have gotten some more money if the
launch had happened," West said. "It was meant to
stimulate people into making gift donations, but I do
not expect that we will lose any money. No one is
angry with us over our decision."

Melanie Young said these recommendations will be "mostly philosophical,
but there will be budgetary consequences of that philosophy."
"We don't want to miss another
year [of budgeting]. That's another
reason why we've tried to work as fast
as we can."
Committee members have been
unwilling to comment on their findings so far, and some have been reluctant to discuss their experiences on

the committee.
"One of the agreements early on
was confidentiality. We wanted to
have control over when information
was released," explained committee
member Pat James.
"We wanted to create a safe space

where we could speak our minds and
change our minds," Young added.
"We don't want anything misconstrued out of context before we have
the opportunity to present all of what
we've been doing, so that people can
see what the totality of our recommendations are."
Young said the recommendations
should be complete in two weeks.
James said she was "really
pleased" with the committee's procedures, which she found more focused
and effective than other committees
on which she has served. "Because we
really respect one another, our time is
respected," James said.

"Because it's such a diverse group
of people we wouldn't have met each
other otherwise. It's been kind offun."
James believes all the committee
members have been able to participate equally despite wage discrepancies.

She recalls, however, that "there
was a point at the end of the semester
when there was pressure among members of environmental services not to

leave their

colleagues"

because there

was so much work to be done in a
short amount of time to prepare the
campus for the summer.
In a community as small as
Swarthmore, issues of job politics
become personal quickly.
When asked about their attitudes
the

toward
or
Swarthmore Living Wage and
Democracy campaign, several staff
members said that they feared negative responses from their coworkers if
they worked on the campaign.
"We're being pressured because of a
shortage of people," said Andrea
Campbell of environmental services.
"People want to be supportive of the living wage campaign, but fear being
taunted by certain people in the department if their work isn't up to par."
Despite pressures, many staff members continue to be active in the
Wage
Swarthmore
and
Living
Democracy campaign.
They are motivated by desires to
concretely change their situation at
Swarthmore as well as to have a more
fundamental impact on how labor is
perceived in our society.
"This is not for selfish gains or publicity. This is the right thing to do,"
Campbell said. "It's not only about us."

Other staff mentioned the educational value of the campaign.
"Students are going to find this in the

workplace. We're showing them what
it means to be an activist worker,"
said administrative assistant Kae
Kalwaic.
"People talk about racism, but
nobody talks about classism," Kalwaic
said. She believes that calling attention to the "class segregation" between
faculty and staff, illustrated by the
existence of separate pay scales and
lounges, is "showing students we're
not really a community."
"Society would like to pretend that
everything is sweet and nice, but it's
not," environmental services employee and

said.

SCRC member Hamza Wali

For the coming year, staff activists
in the Living Wage and Democracy
Campaign plan to focus on student
education and staff mobilization. Most
are waiting for the Compensation
Review Committee's proposals.
Still, many worry that the SCRC
will not deal effectively with wage
issues, holding that the Living Wage
and Democracy Campaign will still
play a large role in any changes that
might be made. This would require
convincing more staff to join the campaign.
"Education also needs to be done
among staff," said Wali.
"Much of the staff is against the living wage campaign," he said. "People
have gotten so used to the struggle that
they don'trealize they're struggling."
Kalwaic blamed narrow and static
worldviews for the reluctance of people from all economic classes to think
critically about compensation issues.
"How do you tell people what
they're entitled to when for so long
they've been held down to low expectations?"
The staff on the Compensation
Review Committee has also had to
confront ingrained ways of looking at

compensation issues.

"Everyone has been way outside
their comfort zone because they're
challenging things other people hold
dear," James said.
When asked if they viewed their
committee's activities as radical,
Young maintained that the differences
between Swarthmore and the corporate world are not so great.
"The question is always: can you
operate the enterprise in a way that
benefits all the people involved?" she

said.

"But I always think its radical
when people take their future in their
hands and say, 'This is what I want
and I'm going to go for it,' especially if
it requires changing our culture to do
it and if that requires making people
angry."

Campuses planning peace rallies for today
BY COURTNEY HEEREN
THE DAILY CARDINAL (U. WISCONSIN)

(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis.
Students
on campuses across the country are coming together to organize nationwide peace
rallies Thursday.
Students began planning events in
response to what they saw as an atmosphere of war frenzy and discrimination
against Muslims and Arab-Americans.
"We're organizing to show support for

Arab-Americans," said Jeff Goddin, a sen-

ior at Ohio State University and self-proclaimed "agitator at-large" of the Campus

Green Party.
"We have been going to mosques
and
showing them that not all Americans are

racist."

According to Carl Camacho, a
University of Wisconsin-Madison senior
and one of the organizers of the Thursday
rally on campus, a professor said that
allowing
harassment against ArabAmericans and Muslims to continue was
an act of injustice not only to the victims,
but also to the entire community.

ism, then you have handed your country,
and what makes it strong, to the terrorists," he said.
The peace rally has three principles,
Camacho said: To stop any war movement
that exists, to stop racist scapegoating and
to defend civil liberties.
Students at Wesleyan College and the
University of California-Berkeley began
organizing the movement and after sending out mass e-mails and contacting other
student organizations, more than 80
schools have joined their effort.
Immediately following Tuesday's terrorist attacks, Goddin said he was scared the
country was going to get "whipped up into
a war frenzy."
"And I think a lot of nuts have come out
of the woodwork," he said. "In the days
after the terrorist attack, I thought for sure
we were going to war and now I'm not 100
percent sure."
"I have gotten such a great response
from everybody I've talked to. A lot of people want to make sure there's justice, but
they're skeptical that an entire country is
behind it and they don't want to see us go
to warlike that."

Georgia Tech and an organizer of the
peace movement on her campus, said students there plan on having at least one

speaker at Thursday's rally.
"There's been some trouble with that,"
she said. "We had one person lined up to
speak, but she's on a green card and so she

can't."
The speaker, an Indian professor, decided not to speak after she heard the INS was
asking to be allowed to put surveillance on
foreign scholars engaging in subversive

activities, Whitenton said.
"She realized it was too much of a risk,"
she said.
Whitenton said the peace rally was a
chance for the voices that have not been
spoken to be heard.
The fact that the movement is present
on campuses throughout the United States
makes it more powerful, Goddin said.
"[Having] national conformity makes
the message that much stronger," he said.
"It'll be a voice that'll drown out the call for
war."
When asked if he thought having a
rally at UW-Madison would make a difference, Camacho said he thought it would.
"If it wasn't, I wouldn't be doing it," he

said.

"We possess the changes that we want.
It's not about what political line you
stand on, or what race you are, or when
you immigrated here. It's about the
truth."
Camacho said it was important for people to be educated about the issues "encompassed in why we are at war."
"I want to change this country for the

is not to critique the study, but
to apply it... this is, in a sense,
a policy direction of the coun-

cil," he said.
Schall stressed that, right
now, the inn "is far from a sure

thing." Billings agreed, pointing
out that there will be many
[opportunities for the college or
the developer to back out of the
project.

|

While the planning commission could, theoretically, recommend against the inn, it is
unlikely.

"The council does not have
to listen to one iota of what we
say," Shoemaker said. "But it
usually doesn't work that way.

Borough council values our
input."
Billings emphasized, however, that it is the college that is
driving the inn project, not the
borough.
"It's not our inn, and it never
has been," Billings said. "It's
always been listed as
a private
collaborative project between
the college and the developer;
the borough would not hire the
...

Haverford Hotel Partners."
Thus, she asked, "will the borough continue to encourage the

a variety of public welfare reasons. Simply swapping land does
not meet those objectives."
Part of what the planning
commission will be reviewing,
she said, would be these parcels
of land. "It's still the same pieces
of land [the college] is talking
about," she said.
Billings said the planning
commission is looking for and
expecting public comment.
"At their Oct. 17 meeting,
they really want to hear from
people as to how they envision

parties? Absolutely, but it's not
really in our court."
As for the college, Schall said
that development of the inn is in
the borough's hands right now.
"They're going to spend probably six months looking at all the
issues involved in the areas
around the edges of the college,
including the proposed location
of the hotel," he said.
In May, Schall said, "If we
use that land for an inn, then the
question of whether the town
will rezone some of the property
[for the college] is still a serious

question."
Last November, the college
asked the borough to rezone several plots of land, near the Mary

Lyon dorm and the Black
Cultural Center, as institutional-

use.

After criticism from the
public and several council
members, the college withdrew
its request.
"The borough believed that
that was of questionable legality," Billings said.
"When you set those land

uses, they are supposed to be for

this to look and what impact
people in town feel is acceptable," she said.
Shoemaker agreed. "We
believe there is concern in the
borough, and we'll want students, residents and business
owners to state their hopes and
concerns about what we're trying to achieve here," he said.
The college has formed a long

committee,
planning
range
which will, in part, address
some of the concerns the borough had with the college's land
trade proposal last year.
"It's very important that
[the college] says what their
vision is of where things go and
how their land will be used,"
Billings said.

Shoemaker predicted that the
draft recommendation from the

planning commission "would go
to one [council] committee only,
the committee on planning and
zoning."
He said this would "allow
members of the council to make
their contribution before they
are forced to vote up or down on
it."

breaks during the day. The Staff Advisory Council (SAC)
chose the map house as the location for the lounge after
President of the College Al Bloom suggested it. The Scott
Arboretum donated the building at the college's request.
Pat Coyne, an administrative coordinator and the SAC

moderator, emphasized that the map house is only a temporary placement for the staff lounge. After Parrish is renovated, the staff lounge may be moved to that location.
Coyne said that staff members with whom she had discussed the new lounge "seemed happy."
"It's a nice little place to relax," remarked staff member

Kenny Whye.

SAC also considered having staff share the space in
Kohlberg with the faculty. After discussing this issue, SAC

felt that many staffmembers wanted a space separate from
the faculty who have used the space in Kohlberg for several years. "We also feel that we have a better view," Coyne
added.
Some staff members disagree. "The idea was grand, but
the space isn't adequate for 500 staff members," said a staff
member working in Environmental Services.
But Coyne said that, since breaks are staggered the
lounge would "never be used for the whole group." Both the
staff and the faculty lounges are not large enough to hold
meetings; the purpose of these lounges is for small groups
of people to convene. The large faculty meetings are typically held in the Scheuer Room in Kohlberg, while staff
meetings take place in Lang Performing Arts Center.

College installs fire sprinklers in PPR, Mertz
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
Sprinkler systems capable of raining
down 15 gallons of water a minute are
now installed in five dorms.
Larry Schall, vice president for facilities, explained that the college plans to
install sprinkler systems in every dorm
over the next several years. Usually, the
sprinklers will be installed at the same
time as other renovations such as

rewiring are made.
Fire sprinklers are designed to put out
fires quickly and
directly, minimizing

in a fire. The dorm
fire which killed students at Seton Hall

an increased emphasis of fire safety at

Overall, the new sprinklers have alleviated some concerns about fire safety.
Lennon said that since she lives in a
smoking dorm, having the sprinklers
makes her worry less about danger in the
event of a fire.
The college plans to have these sprinklers in all dorms by 2007, but may be
required to speed up installations if a bill
aimed to improve fire safety at colleges

the RAs would then be able to instruct
their halls about what the sprinklers will

Unlike the fire alarms installed in all
campus buildings which are set off by the
presence of smoke, the sprinklers are
only set off by exposure to intense heat.

Schall explained that the sprinklers
are set off locally, so if one goes off in a
particular room, sprinklers in other
rooms are not necessarily activated. A
metal bar in each sprinkler head must
bend or break, due to extreme heat or
impact, in order for the sprinkler to
release water.
Lennon said it is possible that a wildly tossed Frisbee would be able to break
the bar and set off the sprinklers. She
also noted that some of the loft beds in

appropriations

Currently, the state budget proposed
by Governor Tom Ridge allocated $3 million that state universities can borrow to
equip their dorms with fire sprinklers.
However, McGeehan's bill would apply to
both public and private colleges.
The original language of the bill would
have required sprinklers in all recognized
fraternity and sorority houses as well as
all dorms, but the bill was amended heavily in the house labor relations committee, and that provision was taken out.
Also stricken was the requirement that
the sprinklers be installed within five
years.
Schall said he has been watching the
bill's progress, but said that the college
decided to start installing fire sprinklers
independently. "We didn't do it because
legislature was going to pass it," he said.
If the state government does make
some funds available to help colleges
install the sprinklers, Schall said, the college would try to qualify for the assistance.

Fire sprinklers such as this one were installed in Mertz, Palmer, Pittenger and Roberts
dorms over the summer. When activated, they release 15 gallons of water per minute.

Love what you've
got: the ville
"It's coming," Student Council posters proclaim. It
sounds exciting, on the face of it, almost as if a whole
new Swarthmore is coming: a real college town, where
new student discount cards would be used at shopping
destinations popular with students, or where a "Friday
Night in the Ville" event might draw half the campus
across the train tracks.
But so far, such important-sounding posters have
been largely regarded with little interest. Why?
Because as most students already know, the ville of
Swarthmore can never be that ideal college town.
For a number of reasons, the economic structure of
Swarthmore's downtown prevents it from being another Chapel Hill, even if there were enough interested

people in the area to make such a place financially feasible. Borough architecture prevents stores from
expanding, and with residential areas close by, a "late
night" means 9 p.m. The business district across the
train tracks consists mainly of small specialty stores,
plus standard food staples like the co-op, Renato's
Pizza and The Cheng Hing Restaurant.
These factors are not totally apparent, though, and
perhaps the apathy toward any joint Student Council
and borough council campaign is really just a sense of
sadness because what's coming is not the college town
that we all, in our hearts, would love to have. It doesn't
have an antique record store, or trendy Indian restaurant. It's not home to a dirt-cheap convenience store or
a farmer's market. And for some Swatties, if there isn't
a quaint college town, then there isn't a town at all.
It's clear that the ville will never be a destination
for Swatties on Friday nights, but surely it is not the
"21st century ghost town" we have labeled it in years
past. A large part of learning to live with
and to
some extent, without the ville will be fully accepting
that Swarthmore is not the idyllic Bryn Mawr or
Wellesley, nor should it be.
The "perfect town or no town at all" attitude has to
be remedied, especially as interaction between the college and ville residents increases over issues like the

hotel. Our often-strained town-gown relations
could indeed be helped by the cooperation of Student
Council and business owners, if only we'd give it a try.
If you want fine dining, head to Media, but if you just
want to grab a slice of pizza, try Renato's instead of
Sharpies. If you need a birthday present for your sister, don't go the bookstore route, head down to the
ville. You never know what you might find.

Public computing

resources improved
This summer the college installed public computers in every dorm, made laptops available to be
checked out in McCabe and purchased new Dells and
Macintoshes for the public computer areas on campus.
And with the SCCS media lounge set to open soon,
computing resources on this campus have never been
better.
Now, staying up aU night to write a paper in the
cozy security of your own dorm is no longer a luxury
only those with their own computers can afford.
Gone
is the frustration of finding only Macintoshes in
Beardsley. Instead, there are the new, simple pleasures of being able to check e-mail at the new

while situated in Kohlberg on the way to class or photographing friends with an SCCS digital camera.
We commend the college for making public computing resources dramatically more accessible,
and look
torward to future improvements.

Teams offer apology for party incident
Dear Editor:
On Sept. 7 several local underage individuals somehow
gained access to the Ultimate Frisbee teams' party. It
appears these individuals were also served alcohol, a misdemeanor in the state of Pennsylvania. Specifically liable
are the party permit's signers, who are, other than in
name and on paper, no more responsible for this incident
than other members of the teams.
The Ultimate teams of Swarthmore College, the
Earthworms and Warmothers, would like to offer their
profound apologies to the college, the local community,
and the aforementioned individuals and their families.
The party was merely meant to raise funds for perpetually lacking equipment, field space and money for the
expenses that a team might incur during the fall season.
The teams need funding primarily to travel to tournaments; coaching is handled by student volunteers and
equipment is bought almost entirely by the students, who
spend up to half their waking hours training for, traveling

This incident haunts all of us. In no way whatsoever
did we ever consider this a minor affair. As a group, we
are saddened and perplexed by our collective lack of forethought and planning, which led to the absence of Party
Associates at our party.
The administration has graciously allowed the teams to
continue to receive funding for tournaments under the conditions that each player be trained to serve as a Party
Associate for two parties during the school year and that
the Ultimate team sponsors no other parties this semester.
These punishments will reinforce the serious lessons we
have learned. Again, to Swarthmore College, to the local
community, and to the families of the individuals involved,
the Ultimate teams offer their most serious apologies. We
hope, through our diligent service this year as Party
Associates, to amend the damage already done and to
absolutely prevent another such incident from happening.

United States and Canada observed a moratorium. The

just another day.
Let me try and convey to you the anguish of a person
crushed by the weight of mourning, looking for that solace
found only in solidarity; in the knowledge that the grief
you feel is significant. Imagine your entire life is not
encapsulated by the Swarthmore campus. Imagine you are
not as fortunate
imagine you lost more than a few
nights' sleep. Now open your eyes.
This past week there were six teams on the field, and
five of those played home games: the cheers after a goal,
the moans after a loss reached your ears as you cross this
idyllic, beautiful campus. If you were burying your dead,
would you care who won?

sports, I would have nothing against a group of my peers
coming together out of their own volition to escape.
However, it is something quite different to come across

everyone's attention on the ball, the esprit de corps of the team infusing the

The Price of Liberty

What America must do
"For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but
against the principalities, against the powers, against the
world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual
hosts of wickedness." Ephesians 6:12
When the Apostle Paul wrote this passage, he was thinking
'about the devil. When I appropriate his writing today, I am
thinking about the Taliban. There is not an awful lot of difference between the two. Both were driven to corrupt religion
through a lust for power. Both inflict hideous suffering upon
the unfortunates trapped in their realm. Both have a profound
hatred of humanity's finer impulses.

But there is one difference between the Lord of Flies and the
Taliban, and it's a crucial one. Paul knew that although we
might oppose the devil's works on Earth, there was no way to
invade Hell and depose Satan. That's not the case in
Afghanistan. Armored columns might never roll into the City
of Dis, but they could get through the Khyber Pass.
Osama bin Laden was not acting alone when he sent planes
hurtling into the World Trade Center and Pentagon. He was acting on behalf of a network of tyrants, thieves and theocrats
stretching from the shores of Tripoli all the way to the ruined

city ofKabul and beyond. Governments supply him and people
-'like him with money, recruits and protection.
If we bring bin Laden to trial and ignore the corrupt states
that are his material and ideological allies, we will have
achieved nothing substantive. Perhaps there willbe a respite of
a few years while his sponsors find a suitable heir and rebuild
his networks, and then we'll be right back to where we began.
Bin Laden is a clever man and very good at what he does. If
he is the perpetrator of this act, as it currently appears, we
have a clear-cut duty to end his existence. However, he is not
the root cause of this evil. The root cause is the fact that with
one exception, every state in the Middle East is ruled by a dictator, and several of these dictators are violently opposed to the
United States. Contrary to what some have suggested, the state
sponsors of this terrorism do not hate us because we are rich
and they are poor, or because we have an unpopular president
or even because we love freedom and they do not.
They hate us because we support the continued existence of
Israel, and because we have a history of interfering with their
dreams of conquest.
As long as we stand by our allies and try to be a responsible
member of the international community we will always find
ourselves getting in the way of their desires, which is why they
are trying to frighten us into isolationism and submission.
The standard response to acts of terrorism by rogue nations,
-

which was to drop a few punitive cruise missiles from high
altitude, slap on impotent economic sanctions and then call it
a day, is not and never has been sufficient. In order to make
sure that something like this never happens again, we're going
to have to do something we haven't done since World War n.
We're going to have to eliminate the tyrants like a doctor
cutting out a tumor, then take an active part in the recovery
process to ensure that a free, stable and prosperous society is
what replaces the old regimes. If this can be achieved through
supporting moderate, pro-democracy opposition leaders, great.
There's no excuse for endangering lives in war if less violent methods are available. But if the direct application of military force is needed, we must not shy away from it.
The task ahead of us is an extraordinarily difficult one.
Such a struggle might take years or even decades to reach
fruition. Much American blood and money is going to be lost
along the way, and there will be more acts of terrorism before

it is finished.
At least two of the regimes we may have to confront have
nuclear weapons, and I honestly have no idea how we'll be able
to deal with that.
We will have to secure the backing of the other great powers
before we can proceed, and that will be one of the greatest
diplomatic challenges in human history I remain hopeful that
we can overcome these obstacles, and am absolutely convinced
that we must try.
The original name for this column was At Ease In Zion.' I
wanted a name which would reflect the satisfaction I felt at
being a citizen of what I feel is the finest, freest nation in the
,

history of civilization.
That sort of complacency is not good enough anymore.
Maybe it never has been. As long as despotism holds sway over
any part of the planet, we cannot take our safety or our freedom
for granted.
Get your gun, America. There's work to do.

You can't go home again
Phoenix reporter heads to NYC after week of Sleepless nights'
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
I went home to New York City last weekend hoping
for the best but expecting the worst. What I saw was
something radically different from the city I had left
three weeks ago, yet much the same as the city of my
high school years.
After many sleepless nights and worrisome days, I
needed to know for myself what it felt like to be in my

home city during the most traumatic time in its history.
On the way home, I felt an apprehensive sense of dread.
My first view of the city would be its forever-altered skyline. I didn't know how I would respond to seeing the
Empire State Building as New York's tallest building.
As my train left Newark, I
caught a glimpse of Manhattan's
southern tip. It looked wrong,
empty. Hovering over the city was
a cloud of dust, a cloud of smoke, a

down to the Empire State Building. I almost felt as
though New York City was still New York City. Central
Park was still the oasis of calm in the city that never
sleeps. Herald Square was packed with people scurrying
in a million different directions. Everyone was in a rush.
It seemed like a normal fall Saturday.
But it wasn't.
On lampposts, posters of missing people decorated
the green metal shafts. Descriptions of each victim
reminded me that I was looking at a picture of someone
who was in one of the towers.
Candles and wax covered streets across the city; most
of the corners were cloaked with white residue. I
thought about unity. The city was united in grief. There
was unity in a country typically
m
divided by trivial political issues.

impenetrable security in the
"Land of the Free." Passengers in
the train stared in silence.
Someone said, "It's incredible. I
still can't believe it." His words spoke for us all. Despite
the numerous times we have seen the buildings crumble
on television, New Yorkers, Americans and human
beings still cannot believe what occurred last Tuesday.
While taking the subway uptown and walking the
two blocks home, I noticed that the mood of the city
seemed different. The subways were a little less packed;
the people a little more pensive. American flags dotted
the landscape of Broadway, displayed in windows and
draped over awnings. The flags reminded us that the victims were our friends, relatives and neighbors. We won't
forget them for a very long time.
On Friday night, I went to a candlelight vigil in the
streets of Manhattan. Everyone sang the national
anthem and "America the Beautiful." Tears streamed
down people's faces. This was a gathering of thoughts, of
emotions and of a community in need. I felt better. I was
with people agonizing over the same dreads that I had
felt. I was in the company of my loving family, physically safe but emotionally harmed.
On Saturday, I strolled through Central Park and

Although New York

suffered the

most, the United States has been
hurt and will never be the same.
The most emotionally wrenching scene was at the Eighth
Avenue and 48th Street fire station, which lost many of its offi-

cers when the first building collapsed. In front of the station,
crowds gathered in silence. Flowers covered every inch
of the sidewalk. Hundreds of candles dotted the ground.
Pictures of the dead were displayed prominently in the
windows of the station, and people lined up to write to
people they will never meet: messages to the victims of a
merciless attack, messages to the bravest of the brave
who went into buildings that burned bright in the clear
morning sky.

On the way out of the city, the image grabbed me. The
dust cloud was settling, and the city looked naked. My
healing began with an emotional trip back home. But for
the rest of us, how does it start? What happens to those
who lost a loved one in one of the twin towers? Or those
who lost an apartment when the surrounding buildings
began to buckle and fall in the hours that followed?
How do we as a country start to heal from an attack
that was completely unexpected and totally devastating?
As we head to war over the next few weeks, we can
channel our anger at someone else. But will we ever really heal completely? I don't know about you, but I don't
think I ever will.

Swat intellectualism buries human emotion
BY JOSHUA GALUN
Swarthmore takes in the intelligent and turns out intellectual
snobs. We do not always consciously
recognize it, but our sense of superiority manifests itself in mocking
sneers, patronizing laughter and a
thousand minor expressions of disgust. We constantly reinforce our
feelings of superiority, distancing
ourselves from the majority of people in this country and worldwide.
This point was driven home last
week. While America was shocked
by the sheer magnitude of death, too
many of us were lost in intellectual

and emotional disconnect, clinically
analyzing the failures of President
Bush's foreign policy. As people
worldwide, even some of our fellow
Swarthmore students, dealt with the
deaths of friends and family, and

dreamt dreams "filled with balls of
fire," too many of us reacted as if
this were just another event outside
the bubble to be analyzed with the
tools of political science.
America's willingness to trade
civil liberties for safety was greeted
with the rolling eyes and knowing
sighs of jaded Swarthmore students.
When some pressed for military
action, we responded with patronizing laughter, certain that we knew

than foolish, emotional
Americans. We respond to prayers
and the very phrase "God Bless
America" with the crudest, basest
atheism
"What's the point? As if
God existed!"
Are we so unwise that we believe
better

that superior intelligence translates
automatically into correctness?
Surely not. After all, the Henry
Kissingers and Milton Friedmans of
the world are not stupid, yet most of
us reject them.And yet, when 94 percent of the American public supports military action, many of us are
content to believe that the pacifistic
six percent aligns perfectly with the
only intelligent people in America.
In the same way that slavery

redounded even upon the slave owners, so does our intellectual superiority strike us as we wield it, pro-

ducing hypocrisy, moral stupidity

and emotional obtuseness. We sym-

pathize with the counterproductive
violence of the Black Panthers as the

product of great anger, yet we offer
no such understanding to an angry
American people demanding violence. We forgive the authoritarianism of the Chinese Communist Party
as the expression of a culture that

values social goals above individual
rights, and yet mock Americans
ready to mimic the Chinese.

Hofan

Chau

distilled

this

hypocrisy into eight paragraphs last
week, first deriding President
Bush's speech as an irresponsible
appeal to nationalism, and then
implicitly excusing the terrorists by
calling upon us to understand their
anger. A quick comparison of Bush's
speech to Osama bin Laden's 1998

"Declaration of the World Islamic
Front for Jihad against the Jews and
the Crusaders" reveals the bankruptcy of this analysis. As poor as
Bush's speech was, I do not recall
him saying anything comparable to
bin Laden's call for 'every Muslim
who believes in God and hopes for
reward to obey God's command to

kill the Americans."

We don't have to reduce ourselves to the lowest common denominator, or pretend that there is no
difference between stupid and
smart. We should, however, be consistent. When we look outside the
United States, or to minorities within it, our intellectual snobbery is
limited by a strong tolerance and
understanding that conservatives
deride as "liberal guilt." We
acknowledge that because we are
different from others, we should be
careful not to presume that our

Bad Biddle
bans bottles

BY MATT WALLAERT
In this world of multinational families and world
travel, nationality has become an increasingly confused
issue. It is no longer a simple thing to say "I am an

American," especially when you or your parents may not
have lived in this country for your or their whole life, or
when your skin color, accent or cultural practices somehow stick out of the crowd.
In the busy haze of life, this multinational status is
often not an object of concern. But when terrorist attacks
are labeled as challenges to national ideals, the situation
is quickly one of finding the sharp divide between "us"
and "them." Suddenly, he who considers himself multinational must defend not only who he is in the eyes of
others, but also must justify to himself exactly where he
stands in the larger picture.
"When I'm in India, I feel my American-ness," says
freshman Anand Vaidya. "But in the United States, I'm
conscious of my Indian-ness. On a personal level, I don't
claim either country exclusively."
When the American president is instructing us,
"Make no mistake: The United States will hunt down and
punish those responsible for these cowardly acts," where
does that place Vaidya and other multinational people?
Let us suppose, for the purpose of continuing to discuss
Vaidya, that India claims responsibility for the attacks.
Can all those living in the United States with a link to
India be expecting a late-night visit from the government
and enforced relocation into poorly-equipped concentration camps, or have we grown as a country since World
War 11, when the Japanese received this treatment?
I am a full-blooded American, by most standards,
because both my parents and grandparents have lived
their entire lives in the United States and because my
passport is navy blue. It's also filled with stamps from
Asian countries. I lived the last two years of my life in
Hong Kong, and traveled extensively in the People's
Republic of China, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and the
Philippines. I studied Mandarin, learned to cook Chinese
food and became part of the Hong Kong community.
But when an American plane collided with one from
China, some of my schoolmates in Hong Kong were quick
to rail against the United States; not just against the
words of its leaders or the attitude of the government
toward the incident, but the whole "American" ethos in
general. Suddenly, I went from part of the Hong Kong
community to an outsider who was arrogant and out to
take over the world, all because I had the wrong kind of
passport. It didn't matter that the death of the Chinese
pilot was upsetting to me; I was on the wrong side by

default.
The United States is part of who I am. It was my home

for 17 years; as a product of its culture, I feel obligated to
defend its ideology when I believe in it and sometimes, I
admit, even when I'm not fully sure I like what it represents. You won't find me waving the flag, but you won't

find me burning it either.

All of that is also true for China. Although I am not
ethnically Chinese, there is still some part of its culture
that stays within me. Just as Vaidya feels his "Indianness" when in the United States, I notice my years in

China against that same background.
In the next few weeks, it is very likely that a group of
terrorists or even a national government will be found
responsible for the hijackings. But no matter who the
United States government "hunts down," there are some
in this country, perhaps even Swarthmore students or
faculty, who may have connections with that group.
My greatest fear is not that tomorrow someone will
crash a plane into my dorm or into the workplace of
someone I love. Instead, I worry about the witch-hunt,
whether in the form of concentration camps or simply
blatant hatred. Multinationals have two faces: the one
they choose for themselves and the one that is given to
them by others. The challenge to us all, as citizens not of
a country but of a world, is to know the difference.

in the family who signed the Constitution and the
Declaration of Independence
a big-name family in
Philadelphia. This Biddle owned lots of land, now known
as the ville. Adjacent to his favorite college, his property
now houses the shops where we get dry cleaning, nonthreatening toys, flowers and out-of-print books. Biddle
espoused many of the same values as the college; he was a
Quaker, a believer in women's suffrage, and had a no-tolerance attitude toward alcohol.
He put injunctions on his land to be followed by any
future tenants and landlords. Among his rules of no bone
boiling or pig slaughtering, there was the rule prohibiting
the sale of alcoholic beverages, either beer or spirits. This
rule predated Prohibition and gave the borough of
Swarthmore its label as "dry." In his claim still written
up on the deed of many property owners in the ville today
Biddle said that violators would have their land turned
over to the neighboring college, whose values were so in
agreement with his own.
Now I will bring you up to the present chapter of this
story, or up to last spring, anyway, when a local town vote
was held. The vote determined, though just barely, that
the college could legitimately open a small inn and serve
alcohol there, in accordance with a recently passed
eleventh-hour amendment to the alcohol licensing law of
Pennsylvania. What that means is that the town is no
longer officially dry, and that Biddle is surely turning
over in his grave.
But other than helping to preserve a measure of quaintness, what is the benefit of having a dry town? It's a pretty
behind-the-times place already, as is noted by Swarthmore
freshmen year after year. More importantly, that type of
land deed would be unjustified, illegal and anti-business if
it were actually enforced. So if I decide after I graduate to
buy up one of the many properties in the ville that is for
sale and start selling alcohol, who could stop me without
having a legal dilemma on their hands?
I might add that this all seems especially absurd to
those Swatties who have had the opportunity to travel or
live abroad, where the negative focus on alcohol consumption does not exist, where kids are in fewer drunk
driving accidents, avoid binge drinking and stomach
pumping trauma, and adults suffer less alcoholism. Does
this stigma on alcohol need to exist in our own town?

Ted's oped, with a really, really long headline
BY TED CHAN

My friend asked me if I was coming
home for Thanksgiving break. I told him,
"I'm definitely coming home for October
break. And I'm never not coming home
ever again for Thanksgiving."
I've never been homesick before
this
year. Three years at college, summers
working in an office; I've never really
missed and appreciated being home all that
much. I always wondered what would
make me want to go home. I wish I didn't
know.
Besides all the atrocious things that
have been happening in the world, this has
been a very bad year for my friends and
me. In April, a clinically-depressed friend
of mine went off the deep end and hurt his
brother, who I knew he loved as much as
anything in the world.
And this summer, an old friend of mine,
Jeff Rosen, passed away in a car accident
in Arizona. Perhaps it was just that I had
never experienced the loss of anyone really

close to me, but I don't know how to deal
with death. When we'd graduated from
high school, we'd gone our separate ways,
but kept in touch through fantasy football;
a little bit through instant messenger. But
I never did visit him at New York
University like he told me to in my year-

book, never partied with him in college
like I thought I'd get to. It's a small world,
but it's not small enough.
Jeff and I had been friends for a long
time. His mom was my art teacher. I have
a picture of us from my thirteenth birthday
party. We used to watch Star Trek
marathons and sniff Crystal Light together. He introduced me to Pearl Jam and we
traded baseball cards.
Most of the time, I don't think about it.
Maybe it's because I try not to. But it's
impossible. I notice his presence whenever
I mix iced tea and smell the saccharine powder rising from the bottom of the two-quart
jar. Or every time I see a Star Trek manual
or hear Eddie Vedder crooning "Oceans."
Most of all, I notice it when I log into my

fantasy football league and notice there's no
NYU/Jamaica Plain Representors. These
are the small things that you never forget
about someone. Their accomplishments,
education, career, things Jeff never got to
achieve to the fullest, those are what people
who didn't know him so well remember.
The individual memories are what animated and animates
the person and friend
he was.
Buildings and planes fall out of the sky
with thousands. Planes that were en route
to San Francisco, where my family entered
the country. Planes that crash in New
York, where my family first laid its roots.
Planes taking off from Boston, where I'm
proud to be from, where my dearest friends
and family are from. All in America, where
I'm proud to be from, where my dearest
friends and family are from.
It all feels very far away right now.
Astronomy problem sets and history seminar papers just don't seem very important
to me right now. A couple weeks ago, they
were the most important things on earth to

friends, I miss
them more than ever, want to be with them
more than ever. I fear more than ever, and
perhaps because it is a belief without much
foundation, that I will never see one or all
me. My family, my oldest

of them again.
For some reason, this week of crisis in
America has finally broken me. It was all I
could stand. Even though everyone I knew
was safe, the entire crisis has broken the
little spirit I had left. I find myself dumbfounded and melancholy, leaning on the
distant supports I have, suddenly craving
to hear from distant friends, even a small email or instant message just saying "Hi."
When the mourning was personal for a
friend who died in an accident, I could still
find meaning in the things I did every day.
That sadness has gone away, but with all
that has happened in our nation, it's as if

the things that seemed important, the
things that were my crutches, have been
broken.

Mom, Dad, I'll be home in October
and for Thanksgiving. Count on it.

lOPINIONSI

'Mommy, were there kids in that building?' Don't succumb to
BY MORGHAN HOLT
It took a four-year-old to make me understand. When I
first learned of last Tuesday's atrocious attacks, I was seated in Kohlberg, alternating between my essential morning
caffeine and my ever-engaging physics problem set, when
the enormity and harsh reality of the whole event sailed
right over my head without so much as igniting a single
synapse. In typical Swattie style, I refused to break my precious bubble of focused concentration long enough to even
inquire what had actually happened. New York's not my
city; no one close to me lives there. I wrote the disasters off

because they simply didn't affect me, while the theoretical
acceleration of a fantasy vehicle somehow did.
It wasn't until much later, when I was watching the

evening news broadcast with my preschool daughter, that
the severity of the situation hit me. And it had nothing to
do with me. Usually rambunctious to the point of hyperactivity, my daughter watched the replayed twin towers' collapse in stoic silence.
"Mommy, a plane just crashed into that building."
"Uh-huh."
"Were there people in that building?"

"Yup."

"Kids?"

"Probably not

...

it was an office building. People

worked there."
"Parents?"

"Some."
"Well, what happens to their kids?"

Here, I hesitated, not knowing how to answer, largely

because I didn't know the answer. My little girl's interest
and inquisitiveness, her burning need for an explanation
and functional solutions to the consequences she already
foresaw forced me out of my bubble, bringing me face-toface with the nasty reality I'd hoped I could ignore.
I don't personally know anyone victimized by the
attacks, but a lot of people, kids included, do. It seems so
obvious now that parents, brothers, sisters, lovers and
friends all perished during those horrific morning hours.
It's bad enough that people lost their lives, but what will
happen to those kids whose parent, or worse, parents, died?
And what's happening to more kids, on pins and needles,
praying for news of their mom or dad's survival as time
wears on and more fragments are pulled from the smoldering rubble, all hope of finding intact bodies, much less
living people, growing smaller each day?

And, in the coming years, what will happen to these
kids? How will these tragedies have shaped their worldviews, their value systems, their personal lives? These are
the questions I ought to have, been asking, from the
moment I heard about the crises.
Embarrassingly, it took my four year old to make me
understand the tragedies, which affected, affects and will
continue to affect a vastly wider spectrum than just the
grieving children who monopolized my daughter's immediate concern. Hopefully, as the media hype subsides and
CBS resumes its regularly scheduled programming, we, in
our eagerness to restore some semblance of normalcy to
our daily lives, don't forget the enduring pain caused by
those horrific acts and remain prepared, not militarily, but
spiritually, mentally, emotionally: the worst is yet to come.

intellectual snobbery

From MAINSTREAM, pg. 12

thinking and our lifestyles are superior.
When we look at the mainstream United States, however,
there is nothing to hold back our intellectual snobbery. We
feel that we understand America intimately, because we live
in America, and because many of us are Americans, and
therefore we see nothing to stop us from condemning
American actions as merely stupid. After all, we are part of
the same culture, the same society, the same history, and the
same economy, and yet we do not think in the same way.
But maybe we are not really of the same history, society,
culture and economy. The mere fact that we line up in opposition to the American public on so many issues should be a
tip off to us that there are a million differences between any
given Swarthmore student and any given American. This
being the case, we should fight against the urge to ascribe
every action we oppose to the stupidity of the people.
I showed last week's Phoenix to a Carleton graduate who
was my boss two years ago. "You know, Swarthmore students
may be very intelligent," he told me in response, "but when
it comes to the fundamental test of just being human beings,
you are failing."
This is a test we must endeavor to pass. We owe it to ourselves to live up to the goals of our institution, but we also
owe it to the American people. Otherwise, there will be no
reason for* them to tolerate the stupidity of Swarthmore students.

its first five games of the season.
F&M took control of the game early, getting to loose balls
quickly and pressuring the Garnet defense. The Diplomats
notched several shots on goal in the first half, including a flurry of attempts in the last ten minutes. In minute 35, a shot ricocheted off of the post. Less than two minutes later, F&M
scored off of a throw-in, notching the first goal against
Swarthmore this season.
By comparison, Swat managed only two shots on goal off of
limited offensive opportunities in the first half. With a minute
remaining, however, the team appeared to gain momentum,
but the half ended before they could attempt a shot.
The second half was much more competitive, however. "We
got off to a slow start," said Ele Forbes 'O5, "but in the second
half, it was really evenly matched." The Garnet nearly tied the
game in the 24th minute when Corey Pilver 'O4 exploited a
defensive lapse by the Diplomats and broke away toward the
goal. The F&M defense recovered, and the play was broken up
before Pilver could attempt a shot.
The shutout is the third in three years that the Garnet has
suffered at the hands of the Diplomats. Nonetheless, the team
is optimistic about its chances this year. "We also only lost 1-0
against the reigning conference champions, which will probably shock the rest of the conference and put them a little more
on the edge when they play Swarthmore," said tri-captain
Claire Hoverman 'O3. With the loss, Swarthmore drops to 0-1 in
the conference and 5-1 overall.

GAME OF THE WEEK
Field Hockey and Women's Soccer
Doubleheader
When: 11:00 am Saturday, Sept. 22

Get ready for a defensive clinic as the field hockey and
women's soccer team head to their home fields this weekend. Field hockey goalkeeper Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 and soccer goalkeepers Catherine Salussolia 'O4 and Courtney
Coughey 'O4 have combined for an impressive seven
shutouts this year. The women's field hockey team is ready
to rumble against Centennial Conference foe Bryn Mawr.
After coming off an impressive run in the Seven Sisters
Tournament on Sept. 15-16, the team is looking for a convincing victory in front of a supportive home crowd that
often includes distinguished fans such as President Al
Bloom. If your thirst for sports action is not quenched by
the field hockey team, stick around for the women's soccer
team matchup with Gettysburg at 1:00 pm. The soccer team
has started the season with an impressive 5-1 record, allowing only one goal to last year's women's soccer Centennial
Conference champions Franklin & Marshall in their most
recent games.

sports. "We still benefit from the

healthy competitive nature, teamwork, love
of the game, and physical exercise," he said.
But IM teams also attract those with who
would otherwise probably not play sports.
Jeremy Schifeling 'O3, member of the
Danabuggers basketball team, cited the
advantage of maintaining fitness. "[lMs] pro-

vide an occasion to stay physically active, an
essential component of healthy living that is
too easily neglected at Swat. Furthermore,
IMs allow me to participate in competitive
sports, in spite of my marginal talent level."
In addition to the obvious physical benefits, participation in intramurals permits
players to develop folklore and rivalries
involving team histories. Players frequently
spend years on the same team, renewing
friendships and intensifying competition
each year. As in the case of the Danabuggers,
hallmates may establish teams that are preserved long after individuals have moved to
other dorms. Similarly, teams may reflect a
particular group that continues to exist after
Swarthmore. Such is the
case of the 1-20 soccer team, composed prima-

rily of international students. In this way,
teams may develop an alumni element and a
reputation to uphold in future years.
Players agree that matches can be almost

mythic and that history underscores everything that occurs on the field or court. "I also
love the rivalries. It's great fun to play the I20's, because they have the most spirit, quite
a bit of good talent, and they always bring

feel that although we won the game, they controlled it." Swat used the controlled
set-bump-spike technique, while Lincoln, on the other hand, depended on riskier
dives to bring the ball up from the ground. On the Swat defensive, co-captain
Christine Hancock 'O2 had four digs.
As Swat settled into the three games it played against Lincoln, Sarah Donovan
'O3 started to come into the forefront. She is fourth in the conference in set assists
and it showed in the matches how effective her play is for the Garnet. With each
one of her 22 set assists, she was giving Swat time to adjust and the team took those
opportunities. Rosenfeld had 13 kills, while Dunphy and Hancock both had six.
During the last game, Swat allowed Lincoln into a point race, but pulled ahead
after Lincoln had scored into the low teens. The score was 30-21, 30-16, 30-17 and
Swat hopes to repeat this 3-0 sweep when they play Lincoln again on Sept. 26.
Gwynedd Mercy was the next challenge and Swat defeated them 30-16, 30-25, 30-13,
and went 3-0 in the match. The rallies during this game were longer and the passing
combinations more complex, and Swat also had to work around Mercy's height
advantage. Nevertheless, Swat overcame all the challenges, with contributions from
Rosenfeld (11 kills) and Dunphy (seven kills). The Garnet will play at the DeSales
tournament on Sept. 21-22 and is expecting to continue on the victory track. "We'vep
been playing really well and we've been able to adjust to new positions and running
new plays" said Dunphy. "Everyone is really supportive and when we get into a little rut on the court, we can pull together and get that last point."

ISPORTSI

BY ANNA MASILELA
The women's tennis team never dropped a match
during the spring 2001 competitive season, garnering a perfect 10-0 Centennial Conference record as
well as the 2001 Centennial Conference championship trophy. This year, the team has no plans to
let the statistics change. Swat has jumpstarted the
fall preseason with a 1-0 record thus far, and the
team is preparing to repeat history this spring as
well. Although the team lost two seniors from last
year's team, Jen Pao 'Ol and Stacy Wageman 'Ol, they
gained six hew players to complement players like
Anjani Reddy 'O4, the undefeated number one singles player last year. "The fall is a good time to get a
feel for the team and we're looking solid," said
Reddy.
Last weekend, Reddy picked up right where she
left off by winning the A-flight singles bracket at the
Swarthmore Invitational. Her toughest competition
came in the semifinals, when she dropped the first
set 5-7 to Carnegie Mellon's Christina Weng. She
rebounded in strong fashion with a 6-0 victory in the
second set and finished Weng off with a close 15-13
win in the tiebreaker. In the finals, Reddy handed
Heather Miller of Millersville College a 6-4, 6-1
defeat to pick up the A-flight singles trophy.
Besides finishing first in the A-flight singles
bracket, Reddy teamed up with fellow sophomore
Kristina Pao 'O4 to capture the A-flight doubles title

The annual Seven Sisters Field
Hockey Tournament took place at
Mt. Holyoke College last weekend
and the Garnet made it the eighth

After conceding a 2-1 overtime

loss last year, the Garnet were
seeded second in this year's tourney, and faced Smith College in
the opening round on Saturday.
Swat peppered

Smith with

15

shots against three by Smith.
However, the game was scoreless
going into halftime. The Garnet
finally made good on one of their
10 second-half shots on goal when
Meg Woodworth 'O3 made good a
pass from tri-captain Kat[i]e Tarr

Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 had 4 saves to
preserve the Garnet shutout.

The Sweet Spot

An ironic saying: sports
and fighting don't mix
BY MARK JANOFF
We've heard all of the vapid remarks before.
"Tragedies put sports in perspective." "Sports can help
heal our wounds." "Sports are not life." "Sports can teach
us valuable lessons." We heard them again last week.

The IM basketball program has expanded to include an experimental fall league. Games began on Sept. 9.

Camaraderie, competition:
lure of intramural sports
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
On any given Sunday afternoon,
faculty and staff, administrators and
students eye each other apprehensively, each trying to outrun the others in pursuit of a black and white
ball. The atmosphere is tense: fans
whisper nervously about the
chances that their team will emerge
from the field victorious or at least
unscathed. This is high stakes soccer. A World Cup qualifying match?
No, just Swarthmore's intramural
(IM) program.
Designed to "fulfill every student

who is looking for camaraderie and
a
challenge,"
according
to
Commissioner of Running Events
Don Nguyen 'O3, the IM program,
directed by Amy Brunner, provides
an outlet for members of the

Swarthmore

College community to

engage each other outside of an academic setting.
Participating in IM sports "is a
fun way to interact with students. It
!s a good source of banter and
amusement in my classes and seminars," said Steve Golub, professor of
economics,
captain
of
the

Faculty/Staff soccer team and fifteen-year veteran of IM sports at

Swarthmore.
The IM program creates bonds
between teammates, and rivalries
between teams, through basketball,
soccer, volleyball and floor hockey
offerings, and special events like
kickball tournaments, frozen foot
races and triathlons. In addition, the
program allows individuals an
opportunity to stay fit while not
committing themselves to the time
drain of the training regiment that
varsity sports require. "Intramurals
allow for those who have a strong
passion for the game but a limited
schedule to play," said Assistant IM
Director Tanya Hahnel 'O5.
Brunner further explained the
constituency and niche of IMs. "As a
director, I am trying to provide different organized events that fit what
the college students and faculty/staff
are interested in. For example, it is
often hard to find enough people
to
hold an impromptu soccer match
and thus, the intramural program
gives people the opportunity to
play
on a more regular basis with friends.
The league atmosphere allows for a

competition than straight
pick-up might provide."
But given the intensity of play, it
would be unfair to dismiss IM sports
as watered-down versions of equivalent varsity sports.
IM rules require that everyone be

bit more

involved on the cpurt or field and
that gender make-up not be severely
skewed, so teams and players reflect
a talent and desire to win equal to
any varsity team.

Indicating that IMs serve as an
extension of his varsity soccer career
at Swarthmore, Larry Schall, vice
president for facilities and services,
said, "Although I will be 48 this year, I
still look forward to competing with
my professional colleagues with the
students of the next generation. It's
fun and it's competitive." Schall is a
twelve-year veteran ofbasketball and
soccer IM play and was captain of
Swat's 1974-5 second place NCAA
Division 111 men's soccer team.
Mark Hanis 'O4, member of the I-20 IM soccer team echoed this sentiment, explaining that IM sports fill a

But last week was different. As the sports world put
itself in perspective and cancelled all of last week's games,
I couldn't help but sense a touch of irony (forgive me for
being insensitive). By canceling the games, the suits and
execs that run sports implied that it would be inappropriate to have a game in the wake of the terrorist attacks. In
other words, they implied that sports and fighting don't
mix. Yet sports are historically a civilized substitute for
fighting.
Boxing, one of the oldest sports, even is fighting. It only
becomes a sport once you throw in gloves, a few rules and
a referee to ensure nobody gets killed. And football is practically total war in the trenches. As George Carlin so eloquently put it, football is the sport in which the quarterback is a "field general" who "marches" his "squad" down
the field and into "enemy territory," throwing "bombs"
and firing "bullets" along the way. I've even seen F-16s and
paratroopers at football games (alright, during the halftime shows). Toss in some rules, some pads and some
(bad) referees for a touch of civility.
Even baseball, the most inactive of all sports, resembles war. On the offensive end, players attempt to locate
and attack the holes of the opposing defense by hitting the
baseball where it cannot easily be intercepted. On the
defensive end, a phalanx of players shifts its structure to
avoid being penetrated. Without a doubt, I've seen submarines (Frank Thomas) at baseball, games. Throw in
some blubber, a lack of overall movement and some
umpires to make sure nobody gets hurt.
In soccer, a complete regiment of attackers and defenders attempts to move through enemy territory and defend
its own territory, respectively. In tennis, players try to hit
the ball (shoot the missile) past the opponent (enemy).
And golf? Well, it's target practice. Give me a sport and I'll
expose the war metaphor. It's not difficult. Sports are simply civil wars.
So where does that leave us? First of all, we shouldn't
wax eloquent about the lessons that sports can teach us.
Sports are not teaching tools. They are forums for screaming, yelling, seething and fighting. Sports allow us to
release negative energy. So, playing games last week
would have allowed us to relieve our pent-up belligerence
and hostility from the attacks. Then, as a clear-headed
nation, we would respond to the attacks with circumspection and civility.

Mullan: a haven
for bookworms and
benchwarmers
BY TED CHAN
a

For those of you who weren't around before last year, our weight
room used to be a dungeon. Literally. It was dirty, the equipment was
at least twenty-five years old and it was impossible to do an exercise
without getting a flake oflead paint in your eye, whether it came from
a rusty, chipped dumbbell or fell off the moldy ceiling. So I was pretty
glad when the Mullan Center opened, but the weight room, while a
great improvement, is far from perfect.
Certainly, improved hours, aesthetics and equipment are much
appreciated by the student body. But if you were going to sign up for a
gym back home, the Mullan would be the equivalent of the yuppie fitness gym for housewives 35 to 45 years old. It simply lacks many of the
fundamental pieces of equipment for many exercises geared towards

building power and strength.

There are a number of machines required to do just about any balanced free weight workout that just aren't there. Personally, I think
the absence of cable machines is appalling, especially before they cut
wrestling and lat muscles were one of the most important groups I

worked as an athlete in training. Not having a leg press cable machine
for lat pulldowns and rows, triceps and crosses would be like
McDonald's not having french fries. Not everyone likes french fries,
but if you leave em out of the order, expect a large percentage of the
population to be pretty irritated and feel like their meal is incomplete.
That's how many feel about their workouts.
"Cable crosses would be a great addition to the weight room
because they are extremely versatile and offer a different kind of
resistance than the free weights and universal machines," said men's
Cleaver 'O4, adding that a decline bench would also
m lacrosse star John
be a nice addition.
"We really need a decline bench press because it's pretty stupid to
have an incline bench press and a flat bench press, but no decline,"
Joon Suk Choi 'O2 said.
Cleaver added that many of his lacrosse teammates and friends who
play basketball think there should be should be a leg press machine.
Women's tennis phenom Anjani Reddy 'O4 also expressed a desire
for a machine for lat pull-downs, "It's bad, especially for girls who
can't do pull-ups." Reddy added that more benches and a weight belt
(which could be used in many exercises) for the dip bar would be very

*"*'

useful.
"The fact of the matter is, when athletes arrive on campus, we
instantly begin losing ground to our competitors. Glaring omissions
from our weight room and the incompleteness of what we do have
makes it virtually impossible to increase strength," said Scott Kushner
'O2. He added, "The best case scenario is that you are able to maintain
your initial strength. It's disheartening to work out all summer only to
suffer throughly unsatisfying workouts once we get back to
Swarthmore. I can't help but feel that time and money will all go to
waste."
Personally, my belief is that the cable cross, leg press and an
adjustable bench that could be used for decline, among other things,
should be high priorities.
Additionally, the Backstreet Boys and Indigo Girls are not lifting
material. Headphones are pretty much a must at Mullan, unless you
want to hear Natalie Merchant combined with a chorus of whatever
large men are in the weight room yelling obscenities about the music.
I suggest that one of two things happen: we give people working out the
option of changing the music (that way at least there's one person who
likes it) or silence.
"It'd be nice to nice to play whatever people want instead of easy
listening all the time," said Jacob Ross 'O5.
Hopefully, the athletic department will catch on to some of the sentiment felt by Mullan Center users and purchase some of the request-

ed machines.

Scott echoed a general sentiment heard in the weight room when he
told me, "The sad part is, the gym seems to be designed for everybody
except athletes trying to get stronger. It's for the intramural benchwarmers and McCabe bookworms who just want to put in their oblig-

Volleyball wins tournament,
keeps undefeated status
BY ANNA MASILELA
The women's volleyball team is currently num-

ber one among Centennial Conference competitors. The team has not dropped a single game and
currently has a 4-0 match record. One of the. many
contributors to this start is co-captain Bryn
Rosenfeld 'O3, who was recognized on the
Centennial Conference Weekly Honor Roll.
Rosenfeld has the best hitting percentage in the
conference (.408) and has recorded 43 kills this season, putting her in third place in the statistics lists.
Her efforts are well reflected in the team's standing, as Swat is at the top of the conference in hitting percentage (0.313) and third in kills per game.
Another one of Swat's secret weapons this fall
has been newly appointed head coach Tom Bosley,
who has developed a presence beside the court.
suggestions
His directions come at a rapid pace
on defensive strategies, challenges for offensive
effort.

"His style of coaching is different than what I
had in high school and it can be intimidating but
you just have to think that he's trying to make you
better," said Natalie Dunphy 'O5. During one
match, his charge was clear: "Bend down, team!
Touch the ground!" The team heard him, got closer to the ground, adjusted and went on to win
another game.
Swat won both games against Lincoln and
Gwynnedd Mercy during the Swarthmore
Tournament held on Sept. 16. The team from the
California Institute of Technology did not attend
due to the difficulty in arranging flights in the
aftermath of the attacks on New York City and
Washington, D.C.
Swat played its first three matches against
Lincoln and the difference in style was immediately apparent. "I wouldn't compare their level of
playing with ours," said Emma Benn 'O4. "But I

HOW TO
BY JOEL BLECHER
Since cabs don't generally accept
meal points, hiring one to get in and
around Philly might be a tad expensive. So what is a poor college student looking for action to do? The
most popular way of getting into the
city is by taking SEPTA, the regional
rail that runs right through campus.
Take the R3 east about ten stops to
get into Center City. You can find a
schedule at the station or online at
www.septa.org. Don't forget that the
schedule varies on weekends.
A well-known trick is to go in
groups of four and buy a family ticket; this way you can cut your fare by
a significant amount. The trip is
about 40 minutes, but allow some
time for delays.
If you drive, you can cut about 15
minutes off the trip and keep your
cash. If you don't have a car, or a

Swarthmore van with a group of
friends. Getting into the city is pretty
simple, though different people have
their personal favorite routes; you
can find some on mapquest.com
and decide for yourself.
Once you're in the city, rail and
trollies are inconvenient more often
than not, and close parking is hard
to find. This means you'll either
have to start walking really, the
best way to get around in Philly or
figure out the bus situation. A day
pass for SEPTA buses costs $5.50,
and the routes are not the most
straightforward. Unless you're
cramped for time, or plan on traversing the entire city, this may not be
worth the money.

Transportation back to Swat can
be a downer too if you have to take

to be back at Market East Station by
midnight, or you'll miss the last train

with your adviser, it seems like you're on the right
track so far. But one question remains that your
adviser never dared to ask: do you have credits where
it really counts? That is, are you "keeping it real,"
indie style? The answer to this question, of course,
won't be found anywhere in the Registrar's Office.
But chances are
especially since you're a Swattie
you could stand to boost your creds a little. After
all, couldn't everyone?
Country folk might know how to play a mean steel

pedal, but when it comes to rock, city people are
where it's at. Fortunately for you, the nearby city of
Brotherly Love and her wonderfulrecord stores make
the perfect place to turn a poser like you into a flesh
and blood independent rocker. The Phoenix, for your
rep's benefit, has decided to compile a brief list of
Philadelphia's best record-selling establishments.
The first place you'll need to look for good records
is on South Street. The street's reputation as a bad-ass
boulevard remains as true today as ever, and
Spaceboy Music (407 South St.) may in part be
responsible for this. Be it indie, noise, math, avanttechno or what have you, this hip little shop's comprehensive collection pushes everything Tower
Records (located up the street) never wanted you to
hear. Be it recorded by small bands, large bands, local
bands, small labels, big labels, new or used, Spaceboy
is selling it. They even have a ton of vinyl. Spaceboy
isn't organized by genre, so it's likely you'll run into

something much cooler than what you were originally looking for. Though a dollar won't get you very far
in most record stores, Spaceboy's 99-cent bin is sure
to leave you rockin' until your next visit.
If you continue on down the street, you'll run into

punk and metal. Badges, stickers, posters and t-shirts

on the other hand is a crowded basement overflowing with a huge collection of used vinyl. This
place stays hip with a bad-ass attitude as good on
indie rock as it is for jazz. With a reputation for exciting variety and reasonable prices, this Record

Those turn-table enthusiasts on their way to mastering the art of disc jockeying must check out Cue
Records (617 S. Fourth St.). Cue is complete with
every category DJ music, techno, avant-techno, hiphop, trip-hop, electronica, experimental, drum and

turntables, mixers, needles) and will do a good job of
repairing the stuff you've broken. If you like Cue, continue down the street to enjoy 611 Records (611 S.

DJ music.

that can boost your indie cred for under $lO.

LESS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE

WHETHER YOU CAN DRINK OR NOT
BY JONAH GOLD

This probably shouldn't be surprising, but it is: Philadelphia has an excellent live
music scene. Let me restate that for the benefit of those of you who might potentially
care, but haven't quite realized the implications of this yet: bands and artists you want
to see will come to Philly. Frequently.
This sounds great, but it can in fact be a bit overwhelming. Much as you'd like to,
you can't go to Philly three or four nights a week to see music, or you'll end up sleepdeprived, failing and broke faster than you can say "The Brian Jonestown Massacre
RULES!"
Avoiding this pitfall is simple: plan ahead and budget your damned time already. Your
best friend here is Pollstar (www.pollstar.com), the place to get concert listings online for
anywhere in the world, including Philly. Search for "Philadelphia, PA" and get more
shows for the upcoming weeks than you could ever dream of or care about attending,
from classical to jazz to Jimmy Buffett and yes, "indie rock" as well, dork. If you want
someone to recommend stuff for you, try the Philly "alternative" weeklies like the
Citypaper or one of the exciting Philly websites mentioned elsewhere in this fabulous
guide.

BY SUZANNE WU

Fashion, frankly, makes me sick. It's
all pseudo-innovative ineptitude, imitation, neurotic regression and hypocrisy.
The world has enough shit in it, I say. So
buy, if you must, but buy used. Here's
where to do that in the South Street area:

VINTAGE CLOTHING COMPANY
Just off of South Street, this is the
place to go for Levi's, good condition
'so's, Ws and '7o's clothing and tikitorch style kitschy crap, like lighters
with Betty Page on them or bobbing-head
dolls. This store also boasts the rare solid
men's section. 530 S. Fourth St.
BUFFALO EXCHANGE
Part of a west-coast chain, Philly's
Buffalo Exchange is significantly better
than all the ones I've visited in
California
even the one in San
Francisco on Haight and the Berkeley
location on Telegraph. I sold clothing
there recently (60 percent of selling price
in store credit and 40 percent in cash for

what they'll take) and the store buyer
was super-choosy, which is a good thing.
Anyone shopping at BE knows that
they're getting stuff that was meticulously chosen and checked for stains or rips.
Lots of the stock is trendy recent stuff,
but there's also a reasonably priced vintage section and really cool costume jewelery that I would impulsively buy lots of
if I weren't allergic to cheap metal. 1109

Walnut St.

GREENE STREET CONSIGNMENT
I rarely find anything at this place,
but then again, I'm really cheap. Greene

Street Consignment is, as the name
implies, a consignment place, which
means that people put up their own used
clothing for what they consider a good
selling price and then split the profits
with the store. It's hard to part with stuff,
even stuff you don't necessarily want or
need, so everything here is marked a bit

high, especially coats. On the corner of
Seventh and South streets.

THRIFT FOR AIDS
Expensive for a thrift store, but a bargain compared to the other second-hand
places in this area. Part of the fun of
shopping at a thrift store, as opposed to a
consignment or vintage place, is that you
get to
and not the store's buyer
decide what pieces are worth noticing
amongst the mumu's and shoulder pads
for amalgamating into your personal
style. And there's a special section of
Urban Outfitter attempted-shoplifting
retrievals, most with a prominent hole
where the electronic sensor used to be.

South Street, across from Showcase
Comics.
On

ASTRO POP
The best place to shop for gifts, and
the best place to receive a gift from, ever.
Astro Pop would be cool even if the propritor didn't chain smoke and listen to
Marilyn Monroe records while you
browsed. Look here for 'so's stuff, from
period gag gifts, to small electronics, to
clothing. But watch out: with authenticity comes some size problems. Gloves and
shoes will tragically only fit the really
petite. The dresses, on the other hand,
are fabulous and fragile and worth their
price. 13th and Pine streets.

"But where am I going to go to go to see this stuff?" you'll soon ask (maybe you
won't, but just run with the rhetorical device). For explicative purposes, I have decided
to put venues in three basic, though loose, categories according to size, cost and profile
of groups playing there. Without further ado, what follows is a brief breakdown of these
categories, and a few venues you'll want to know about in each.
Arenas (Really Big): Yeah, yeah, I know"you're not going to shell out fifty bucks for the
Journey reunion tour. But the arenas are there for when you need them. The Tweeter
Center (www.tweetercenter.com/philadelphia/), in scenic Camden, N.J., is just across
the river from Philadelphia. It hosts such cutting-edge guests as John Mellencamp and
Aerosmith, but you might get to see Weezer there too if you're lucky, so don't laugh too
hard. The other arena of note is First Union Center (www.comcast-spectacor.com), a
sports stadium (Flyers and Sixers games happen there) in South Philly. Tool's playing
there soon, so they must be cool.
Large Club-Sized Venues (Big to Medium-Sized): Most of the concerts I've been to in
Philly, and most you will probably go to, fall somewhere in this category. These are
places where admission is probably $25 or less; there will be crowds but not mobs; and
you'll have heard of most, but not all, of the bands playing there. Notable rock venues
in this category are the Theatre of Living Arts on South Street
(www.electricfactory.com/tla), the Trocadero on Arch Street (www.thetroc.com) and the
Electric Factory (www.electricfactory.com) up on North Seventh Street. All host a variety
of different styles and popularity levels of rock and pop music, from Jay-Z to Tenacious
D. (both actually playing at the T.L.A. in the next two months).
There are also a couple notable jazz clubs in town of around this size, the most
famous being Zanzibar Blue on Broad and Walnut streets (www.zanzibarblue.com),
reputedly an awesome place. For jazz you can also go to Ortlieb's Jazzhaus (www.ortliebsjazzhaus.com) on Third Street or the Five
Spot (www.thefivespot.com) on South
Bank Street.
Or, if these excellent establishments
are still too large and mainstream for
your tastes, you could try
Bars and Smaller Venues (Little): As a
general rule, the smaller the venue, the
worse-organized the event, the hipper the
attendees and the more likely you are to
get an amazing show (or a godawful
show) for your buck. Local promoter/hottie Sean Agnew's R5 Productions
(www.rsproductions.com), which hosts
small, extremely cool indie and punk
shows, is currently in the First Unitarian
on Second Street, but is moving
Church

somewhere as-yet-unannounced pretty
soon. Check them out. A bunch of bars that you can't get into unless you are 21 also
have small shows that make my 19-year-old ass crave a fake I.D. The Khyber on Second
Street has good rock'n'roll for those old enough to buy booze. Also notable are the
North Star (www.northstarbar.com) on 27th and Poplar streets and North by Northwest
on Germantown Avenue. Or if you like singer-songwriters, head over to The Tin Angel
(www.tinangel.com) on South Second Street and bask in the acoustic love.
And yes, there are others too, but nonetheless it is here that I will conclude my highly
informal and no doubt highly incomplete tour of Philly's music scene. I only wish I had
the spare time to visit the places I haven't seen, as well as the places I didn't mention,
and the places I haven't heard of and tell you all about them. But I'm far too lazy for all
that. Find out for yourself. Happy scenester-ing!

HOW TO HOW TO
MAKE A MOVIE AN EVENT
The first thing you need to know about going to the
Ritz movie theater in Philadelphia is that there are three
Ritzes, not one. They are all situated in South Philly and
it's easy to get confused. But at any of them, I can guarantee a better movie-going experience than you would
get at AMC Marple 10. Here are two options.
The one I've visited most often is the Ritz at the
Bourse. It's a couple of blocks off Market on Ranstead
Street, an easy walk from Market East Station. On one
side of it is a bar that I've heard is indiscriminate,
although I can't vouch for that personally. And across
the way is a Xando.
The theater itself offers five options, ranging from
mainstream to artsy. Most tend to be rated R; some
have no rating at all, and those are the artsiest ones.
Normally you can expect not to have heard of at least
one of the films. Tickets are $5.50 if you're a student,
for every show except Saturday night. If you're unwilling
to simply dive in without being given some background,
though, there is always the "movies" link on the Daily
Jolt. Change the location to "Philadelphia," scroll down
to the Bourse, and read the synopses.
The Bourse is clean, and the bathrooms are especial-

At any given moment, not only
will you not have heard of at least
one of the films out of the six
playing there, you also might not
have heard of the language it's in.
ly nice. I remember going in after seeing "Dancer in the
Dark" in search of something to wipe my eyes with and
encountering two others with the same need. And I
remember going in after "Bounce" thinking, "what the
hell was that?" and encountering two others clearly
thinking the same thing. Either way, instant camaraderie.
The Ritz 5, at Second and Walnut, is more unique. At
any given moment, not only will you not have heard of at
least one of the films out of the six playing there, you
also might not have heard of the language it's in. This
theater caters to an older, more upscale crowd.
Standing in line for "In the Mood for Love," Wong KarWai's latest, I realized I was surrounded by cheerful,
gray-haired people trading sophisticated opinions on the
arts. Essentially, Swatties in thirty years.
Instead of merely dishing popcorn and soda, the
snack bar selections at the Ritz 5 include an array of
cappucino, chai, baked goods and fruit. Inside, instead
of pop music, they play soothing classical over the
speakers while you wait. Before the trailers they show
advertisements for museum exhibits coming to the city.
They even give you programs!
Unfortunately, there is no student discount. It's also a
farther walk from Market East and there are no neat little cafes on the same block. There are a few restaurants
on your way back to Market Street, though. If you're
interested in something you probably would not be able
to see anyplace else and don't mind putting in the time
to get there, it's a memorable experience.

PRETEND TO BE A PENN
STUDENT

BY CARLA GREENBERG

It's hard to escape. The moment you step off the R3 at
University City Station, the air has a different quality. The
sights, sounds and smehs are different. Wandering down
South Street on a Saturday afternoon, you're likely to hear
crowds roaring at Franklin Field. Vendors line the streets
selling everything from fruit salad to Thai food. And then
you emerge on to the campus green. Dogs race around, people play frisbee, actors rehearse on a slight hill and aspirants to the circus

Walnut, there are

sidewalks; people sit

An added bonus: Urban Outfitters now stocks everything
you need to generically decorate your dorm room, from
shag rugs to flower vases to tube lighting.

SPORTS
These Philadelphia winters get pretty cold, so make sure
you equip yourself with a heavy-duty parka to keep off the
northern winds. In addition, the long hikes around campus
require super-strength backpacks with daisy chains and
nylon netting so you can cart your stuff around in ease
and style. EMS has anything you might require in
the outerwear department,
so run in before the snow

McCabe is far, far
away.
Now, what is this
strange
emotion
welling up within? It

is a form of jealousy;
a desire to be like
these carefree, fun-loving people and enjoy all the benefits
they have around them. I like to call it "Pennvy."
So what can you do to cure this coveting of the opportunities that the University of Pennsylvania offers? If transferring seems too drastic a move, take heart: you can indeed
learn how to "act like a Penn student." This article will help
you get the look and the know-how. Even if you have been
able to avoid "Pennvy" thus far, learn how to take advantage of all the many things there are to do around Penn
all the many things our sleepy little borough is hard-pressed
to offer.

WHERE TO CHILL

Penn students not only like to hang out, they actually do.
So, there are plenty of spots to grab a coffee or a quick
snack; pull out your laptop and start chatting away with
your similarly hip-looking friends.

XANDO COFFEE BAR
Located on Walnut and 36th streets, Xando is tucked into
Sansom Common, just behind the campus bookstore. Here
you'll find outdoor tables as well as table-top 'smores. This
is where Penn students come to hang out and get away from
it all. Smoothies, a full coffee bar, overpriced sandwiches
and spirits are also available.
STARBUCKS
Not as cool as Xando but still hip by association and the
testimonials of many Frappuccino devotees, Starbucks is
located at the bottom ofPenn's campus, on Walnut and 34th

OTHER GREAT PLACES
The Gap and Steve
Madden have places on
Michelle Lee Phoenix Staff I Walnut as well. In addition,
the campus bookstore is
operated by Barnes and Noble Booksellers, so you can nip in
for a little more of the "chain store" feeling. An added bonus:
you can purchase Godiva chocolates at the bookstore to
bring home to your mom at Christmas.

DO

PLACES TO BE

Sometimes you need a place to relax and get away from
all the shopping and hanging out you've been doing. Ergo,
"places to be"
that is, ways to take advantage of Penn student space without needing a Penn ID.

THE CAMPUS GREEN
Here's where to get that real "campus" feeling: people

lying out on blankets, sharing gyros bought at a street vendor's wagon and entertainments of all sorts going on all
around. Bring books and headphones to pretend you're
doing work, or gather 10 of your closest friends to discuss
what happened at the frat parties last night.

LOCUST WALK

Pull out your cell phone: you're going for a stroll down
Locust Walk. You'll pass frat houses with loud music and

"beach" volleyball; the ivy-covered entrance to the Wharton
buildings; and lots of people on bikes. Meet your friends at
the compass embedded in the middle of one crossway, next
to one of the many statues of Ben Franklin that speckle the

The Institute of Contemporary Art presan exhibition entitled "Rudi
Gernreich: Fashion will go out of fashion,"
examining and highlighting the cultural
impact of '6o's designer Gernreich, perhaps
best known for his topless bathing suit. The
exhibit will run from Sept. 15 to Nov. 11; on
Thursday night the ICA and UPenn will
host a '6o's dance party. For more info, call

campus. Just make sure you don't step on the compass

it's bad luck, and an immediate sign that you're not a true

Penn student. Locust Walk is located down the center of
campus, extending from the Campus Green up to 40th

streets.

THE STUDENT CENTER

ABNER'S CHEESESTEAKS

Where Penn students go for the true Philly cheesesteak
experience. Located on 38th and Chestnut, Abner's is slightly off the beaten path, but it gives Penn students a good feel
for what West Philadelphia is "really like." Open until 3 a.m.
on Fridays and Saturdays, Abner's is a great place to get a

late-night bite.

WHERE TO SHOP

There are tons of great places to shop around Penn, many
of which can't be found in the Springfield Mall or the ville.
URBAN OUTFITTERS
Conveniently located next to Xando in Sansom Common,
this branch of the omnipresent clothing store has everything the hip college-aged urbanite needs to survive. Pricey
tee-shirts and pre-ripped jeans are all part of the package.

THE PHOENIX

Located in a newly-built-to-look-old building on
Perelman Quadrangle (just off the Campus Green), you'll
find the student center. Enter on the main floor and you'll
find polished open lounges that have the air of a particularly nice Marriott hotel. Downstairs is Houston Market, a dining area with everything from salads to pizza to Vietnamese
and Thai food. Just off of the market are a video arcade and
a card shop
for all your procrastination needs.
Other entertainments abound on Penn's campus. There's
a small movie theater, McDonald's, Baskin-Robbins and
branches of the Philadelphia Free Library. So go ahead. Pay
the $7.50 for a round-trip ticket to University City. The value
of a taste of "real" college life is priceless. And maybe, if
you're lucky, you'll discover the real draws of exploring
great, cheap food and a huge
Penn and its surroundings
group of people you've never met before.
