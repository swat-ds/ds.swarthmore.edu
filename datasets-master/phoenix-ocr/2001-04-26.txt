Borough businesses
receptive to proposed
discount cards
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
In an effort to improve student relations with businesses in the ville, Student Council met last week with the
Swarthmore Business Authority to discuss ways to make
the borough more attractive to students.
"The relationship [between students and ville businesses] is lacking in two ways," Student Council member Jordan Brackett 'Ol said.
"The first is that there are not enough stores that
reflect the consumption choices of most college students.
The second problem is that even those stores that provide goods and services that many students might use
Renato's, Cheng Hing, Garnet Cleaners, the Co-Op,
to name a few
are not frequented often enough by

Students.

He indicated that students may be "partially to
blame for not fully utilizing the resources of the
ville" but thought that merchants could "do a better
job of reaching out to students
having longer
hours; giving more discounts; advertising in The
Phoenix."

Though the Business Authority is composed primarily of concerned Swarthmore residents and spouses of
business owners, rather than the owners themselves,

Architects recommend dorm site near Mertz
BY IVAN BOOTH E

The most likely site for the new
dorm slated to open in the fall of 2000
will be south of Mertz along Chester
Road. Architect Cliff Gayley, ofWilliam
Rawn Associates, Inc., spoke to students about the firm's initial plans for
the dorm at a fireside chat last Thursday, explaining that the firm selected
the location near Mertz after an extensive study of the campus.
The location will not be definite until the Board of Managers approves it
at their next meeting in May.
In their study, the architects took
note of clear divisions on campus:
Parrish Hall between the northern academic area and the southern student
life area and Magill Walk between the
east and west lawns.
"The most dynamic space of your

campus is the memorable lawn,"
Gayler said, referring to Parrish Beach.
He noted that Swarthmore's lawn is
much larger than the main lawns of
many other colleges and universities
but is about the same length as the
University of Virginia's. Thomas
Jefferson's original design for the UVA
lawn planned boundaries on three
sides, like Parrish Beach, with a view
up into the mountains. Recently, the
university built a new building on the
previously open fourth side. "If we put
a building at the end of the lawn [here],
closing it off, it would be like what they
did at UVA, which was a disaster,"

Gayley said.

Swarthmore's west lawn, Gayley
noted, was quite "informal," closed off
by the grove of trees next to the train
tracks and abutted by the irregular
facades of Sharpies and Clothier.
The east lawn, on the other hand, allows for a clear view from the train station to Parrish and is enclosed by the
linear forms of McCabe, Old Tarble and
Mertz. "The difference between the two
is powerful," Gayley said.
The new dorm, he said, "completes
and extends the lawn in a different way
than the linear wall of Mertz."
One of the most important features
of the campus geography, Gayley said,
is the east-west "transept" running from
Worth and the lodges to Wharton and
Danawell. "Standing in the middle, you
can see the Crum woods," he said. In the
interest of preserving this open space,
the firm rejected possible sites such as
the present location of the tennis courts.
The interests of the Scott Arboretum
also influenced the choice of location.
Gayley said architects and landscape designers toured the campus with arboretum staff to identify sites of the most

valuable plantings.
While the arboretum did not completely veto any of the possible sites,
they did consider some plantings more
important than others. The area between Sharpies and the train tracks, for
instance, includes one of the

arboretum's most valuable trees. The
trees on the site chosen for the dorm, on

the other hand, are not as significant,
and in addition are fast-growing and
easy to transplant. "The arboretum
even said they would plant trees soon,

so they would be mature, once we tell
them where the new dorm will be,"

Gayley said.
"Here, the buildings and the landscape support each other," he said.
"Buildings themselves that are threesided are also powerful." Describing
the successful "entry courtyards" of
Wharton and Worth, Gayley contrasted
them with that of Mertz. "Had Mertz
been flipped the other way, it would
have been a much different, much
more successful building," he said. "It
was just a disaster."
He did not find Willets stimulating,
either. "Willets is the kind of building
design that comes from completely ignoring the environment of the dorm,"
Gayley said.
The new dorm would probably have
an entry courtyard facing the main
lawn, although architects have not yet
drafted the final design. One end of the
building will face west, across the lawn,
and the other end will bend into an obtuse angle, facing up across the Bond
parking lot toward the lodges. Gayley
said he hopes this section, facing north,
will help to tie in the open space beyond Worth Health Center as well as
engage Mertz's courtyard.
Gayley said he hoped the college

Council Co-President Colin Moore 'O2 said a ma-

jority of those in attendance were excited about suggestions from Student Council.
The two main proposals Student Council introduced
were a planned discount card, which would feature discounts at 12 to 15 ville businesses, and the option for students to use meal plan points at ville restaurants.
The cards would be free to all Swarthmore students,
said Campus Life Representative Lauren Tobias 'O2.
The President's Office has agreed to cover half of the
approximately $3,000 cost, and Student Council is hoping businesses featured on the card will be able to fund

the remainder.
At their meeting on Monday, Student Council debated the possibility of adding businesses on Baltimore
Pike or those in other areas, such as Swarthmore Pizza,
but felt that adding these businesses would detract
from the ultimate purpose of increasing business in
the ville.
Tobias will meet with Gail Gaustad, owner of T.
Bumble's toy store, and other business owners this week
to see what types of discounts they may be willing to
offer and to discuss how to fund the remainder of the
costs. If owners are enthusiastic about the idea, the cards
will most likely be available at the beginning of next

semester.
The other idea discussed in-depth was extending the
points system, whichstudents can currently use to purchase food at Essie Mae's and the Kohlberg Coffee Bar,
to restaurants in the ville.
Swarthmore businesses and college administrators
must discuss the issue before it becomes definite, but
council members were encouraged by the Business
Authority's enthusiasm.

More long-term proposals Student Council introduced to the Swarthmore Business Authority were the
addition of a Euro cafe, a thrift store and a student-

owned co-op.
In addition, some proposed moving the bookstore
from the basement of Clothier Hall to a new location in
the ville, possibly in the new hotel.
Though she wasn't sure she agreed with the idea,
Tobias explained the move. "Now when students need
something, they simply go the bookstore," she said. "The
idea was that if the bookstore was in the ville, students
would become more of a factor in ville businesses."
According to Moore, Student Council ultimately
hopes their efforts will result not only in increased student patronage of ville businesses, but also in better
town-gown relations.

Outlook for American democracy grim, activist says
BY JON EHRENFELD
June Jordan is alarmed. She is vexed at what she believes
is the diminished presence of an African-American perspective in the media. She worries about a loss of freedom of
speech in the United States. And she is deeply concerned
with the more barbaric elements of popular culture.
"In a democracy, you would not find violence everywhere
glorified," she said to an audience in the LPAC cinema last

Friday.

Jordan is a "a powerhouse of an activist" as well as a
celebrated poet, someone who "tweaks nerves," according
to English professor Chuck James. She has been hailed by
the University of California at Berkeley as "one of the world's most ar- mmmi m^^^^^^m
'

ticulate and essential voices."
Her speech last Friday moved
back and forth between poetry and
informal talk. It followed a week on

around the country. James praised her for "allow[ing] many
individuals to talk about what democracy means to them."
Following her talk, Jordan read several of her poems,
which ranged from quiet, terse descriptions to loud, fast raps.
They dealt with topics including Wen Ho Lee, a Chinese
physicist accused of spying, and rapper Eminem's controversial lyrics. In the latter, she parodied Eminem's wellknown song "The Real Slim Shady" when she said, "I'm the
slim lady, and I will stand up." She described the current
spate of "reality" television shows as "Darwin gone drunk."
A cynical retelling of the Sermon on the Mount from the
perspective of John Ashcroft, President Bush's attorney general, concluded the poetry section. "Blessed are the rich
woe to the poor," began the poem,
which went on to blast what Jordan

AND I WILL STAND UP."

campus during which Jordan
worked with a creative writing section and the Learning for Life program, where she, staff
members and students created a poem about their views on
what democracy should be (see letter to the editor, pg. 10).
Despite the serious and, at times, grim message of her
talk, Jordan continually cracked jokes and bantered with
the audience. Speaking of the "verifiably stolen election"
for the U.S. president last November, Jordan said the result
-

of the Florida debacle was a "nitwit twit of an illegit" in the

White House today.

"I want to beradical" was a phrase Jordan repeated throughout her speech. To be radical, she said, means "going to the
root of things." To be radical means examining democracy as
it exists now and judging whether it is truly democracy.
This trait is essentialfor communities around the nation,
Jordan said. She is known for her love of the democratic process and has a propensity for raising the matter in towns

described as Ashcroft's disdain for
minorities and the impoverished.
Jordan concluded her speech with

a plea that students become involved
in political life and public office so
that they might undo some of the
many evils that Jordan sees today.
For her work in the fields ofpoetry and activism, Jordan
has received numerous laurels, including a Rockefeller grant
and support from the National Endowment for the Arts. A
professor of African-American studies at Berkeley, Jordan
has written over 26 books, including essays and poetry.
She also founded the Poetry for the People program,
which received a Chancellor's Recognition for Community
Partnership last year. The program reaches out to local high
schools, congregations and correctional facilities.
Jordan has also held teaching positions at Sarah
Lawrence, Yale, State University of New York at Stonybrook,
City College of New York and the University of Connecticut.
Jordan last visited Swarthmore several years ago. James
said the English department "had hoped [her stay] might be
for a longer period of time."

No activist space
in near future
BY HOFAN CHAU
Two monthsafter Student Council agreed to open the Wharton
basement space to all campus
groups, no student organizations

have taken advantage ofit. Accord-

ing to Sonal Bhatia 'Ol, the admin-

istrator of the space, "no one" is yet
using the basement.
Activist groups don't seem to believe that the Wharton space in its

present form would satisfy their
needs, and are searching for other
options. Council co-president Anna
Woodiwiss 'O2 said that "in terms

of other possible places
that
could be dedicated as activist or political space, the current options
are pretty poor."
Woodiwiss said further down
the road, an activist space could be
made available in one of the lodges
or in Parrish after it is renovated.
These options would not be available until after 2004.
Sarah Drescher 'O3, a member
of Conscious Consumers and Just
Cause and a co-sponsor of the original activist space proposal, said
that the problem with Wharton has
to do with the physical character...

istics of the basement, including
complications with access. "Having to go find a Wharton RA to let
you into the basement before you
could get into your group's materi-

als is more of a hurdle than having
people keep stuff in their dorm

rooms," she said.
Furthermore, Drescher said the
proposal was really about having
a "home" for the activists. Wharton
basement "seems like a perfectly
decent meeting room, but, as we
tried to make clear during the referendum process, we don't just
need another meeting room," she

said.
Another problem has to do with
the lack of publicity. "I'm not sure
[about] the actual procedure for using the Wharton space," said
Drescher. "There hasn'tbeen much
advertising, and I wouldn't be at all
surprised if there were some groups
who didn't know it was open."
Bhatia said that she plans to
send out e-mails to the treasurers
of campus groups to alert them to
Wharton basement's availability.
Pat James, the director of community service at the college, said
the planned Lang Center for Social
Responsibility is slated to be an administrative center for such groups.
While she stated that "no additional
space has been committed," she said
that thereis a small office in Parrish

phone and serve as storage space for

Media lounge to open in fall
BY GABRIEL HETLAND
The Swarthmore College Computing Society
(SCCS) Media Lounge, which won last November's
referendum for use of the basement space in Clothier, should be up and running by next fall, according to SCCS co-president Nick Ouellette 'O2.

SCCS won the runofffor use ofthe formerTarble

game room space, beating proposals for an activist
space and a "SWa-Wa" convenience store. SCCS had
previously lost in their proposal for Sharpies 111, in
the fall of 1999, to a student art space.
Amanda Schneider 'O2, one of three SCCS policy
board representatives, said that "the SCCS staff have
been working really hard" on the media lounge campaign. "It will serve as a fun space student space,"
she said. "I think that's definitely fulfilling a need."
Ouellette said the process has been steadily progressing behind the scenes and that the new lounge

should be ready by the time classes start next fall.
Since November, the SCCS staffhas been working
with facilities to bring the plan into reality.
The new media lounge will comprise three sections. The first will be a room for SCCS's e-mail
server, Merlin. The other two rooms will include a
computer lab, consisting of ten work stations, and
a media room, to house a large-screen projector, a
DVD player and a Sony Play Station.
When the lounge opens in September, Ouellette
said, the computers will probably still be exterms,
UNK-based terminals, donated from the computer
science department. As soon as SCCS has access to its
budget
which has already been approved these
terminals will be replaced by actual machines. The
machines will be a mix of Mac, PC and Linux-based
operating systems, to accommodate different users.
Co-president Stephanie Wojtkowski 'O2 said that
the hours of operation for the space should be from
8 a.m. to 2 a.m., guaranteeing broad public access.
Wojtkowski said that SCCS staffers will probably
increase their office hours from one to two hours
per week, to better meet the student body's needs.

"We're very excited aboutall this," Ouellette said.
SCCS has "really outgrown the space on Parrish
fifth," he added, noting that the group hopes more
students will stop by once the group has moved to a
more accessible location.
The new space will provide another place for students to hang out on campus, Ouellette said. Furthermore, the media lounge will be "a space where
students can come and play around with technology which otherwise they might not have access to,
in an environment that is not primarily academic
or controlled," he said.
Hours of operation for the space should be from
8 a.m. to 2 a.m., guaranteeing broad public access,
said SCCS co-president Stephanie Wojtkowski 'O2.
She added that SCCS staffers will probably increase
their office hours from one to two a week to better

meet the student body's needs.

"We'll be getting more little fun things to play with

and lots ofstuff to do cool projects,"Wojtkowski added.

Ouellette contrasted the new lounge with existing computer centers. Unlike the Beardsley lab and
the Sproul Sun lab, where students do mostly academic work, Ouellette hopes the new space will
serve a different need, by providing students with
technology in a relaxed setting where they can explore without feeling constrained by academic pressure or monitoring.
SCCS and facilities have been busy throughout
the semester in getting everything ready, Ouellette
said.The lounge was recently carpeted, the networking system is now in place and security systems are
presently being installed.
One constraint is that SCCS's budget will not be
availableuntil next fall. Ouellette said this shouldn't
delay the opening, although it might mean that some
small improvements, such as bringing in the new
computers, will occur during the fall semester.
Overall, Wojtkowski said she is very excited about
the lounge. "It's going to be cool," she said. "Eventually," she added, "we'llbe getting more little fun things
to play with, and lots of stuff to do cool projects."

HIGHTER

Harvard living wage campaigners hold sit-in

BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO

“THE NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
WERE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.”
PAUL LEKOS, PSLM MEMBER

About 50 Harvard student protestors demanding a "living wage" for all workers employed by the university took

over Massachusetts Hall, an administrative building, last
Wednesday. Top administrators left Massachusetts Hall two
hours after the sit-in began, according to the Web site of
Harvard's Progressive Student Labor Movement (PSLM),
the group sponsoring the sit-in.
"We are sitting in because Harvard's wage and benefit
policies threaten the economic survival and violate the
dignity of university workers, and our community overwhelmingly recognizes this fact," the site reads.
Last week, the Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign sent an open letter to Harvard's president,
Neil L. Rudenstine, asking him to "negotiate with the students and implement a living wage for all Harvard workers as quickly as possible."
Paul Lekos, a campaign activist and a first-year law student at Harvard, said that there are two reasons for the
Harvard sit-in. The first, he said, is the presence of 1,500
underpaid workers on the university's campus.
"Most of these workers are people of color. A lot of them
are immigrants," Lekos said in an interview Tuesday night.

The secondreason for the protest, Lekos said, was that all

negotiations have seemed to reach an impasse. "The negotiations and discussions were not going anywhere," he said.
Over the past week, the campaign has gained broad-based
support from the campus community. Famous personalities
like Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Warren Beatty and Senator
Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) have come out in support of the
movement, and Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) spoke outside the hall the students were occupying last Friday. AFLCIO president John Sweeney has also endorsed the campaign. About 45 student organizations and 25 community
groups, such as the Massachusetts Democratic Party, the
Cambridge Town Council and all of the unions whose workers are employed on campus, plus more than 200 faculty
members have also expressed support for the campaign.

-

“Talking to a few teachers, it seems like there is a lot of
support among the faculty here for the students and the campaign,” said Harvard freshman Jason Alcorn. He declined to
make the same statement about students.
“There is the entire spectrum of postions toward the sit-in
here on campus,” Alcorn said. “I think the majority of the people
are for a living wage for all of Harvard’s workers, but a good
number are unsure if thesit-in is the best thing to be doing.” He
added that a number of student groups had officially endorsed
the sit-in, including the umbrella organization for public service
groups, a Catholic social justice group and queer and black organizations. But others, including the student newspaper The
Harvard Crimson, “have condemned the sit-in even though they
have traditionally supported the campaign,” Alcorn said.
Some students living on the fourth floor of Mass. Hall have
protested the protest, hanging signs that read, “Jail PSLM,
(P)ink (S)ocialist (L)eftist (M)arxist” and “We support the administration.” But alumni and professors speak daily at the
sit-in, and some professors are even holding class right outside the hall for the benefit of those sitting in.
The protest has now spread from the Mass. Hall into Harvard
Square. There, students started a tent city where many protestors have come to sleep as a sign of support for the campaign. By
Tuesday night, living wage supporters had already set up approximately 30 tents. As of Wednesday night, theadministration
of the university has refused to negotiate with the protesters.
“The students now inside Massachusetts Hall continue to
disagree with the university’s approach, and that is their right.

It is also their right to express their views, with vigor and passion. But it is not their right to occupy a university building, to
interfere with the conduct of work inside it, and to disrupt the
lives of nearby student residents, in an effort to force a differ-

ent decision," wrote Neil L. Rudenstine, president of
Harvard, in an open letter from Tuesday. He said that discussion on the issue can resume after the sit-in ends and "an
environmentof genuinely free discussion has beenrestored."
"[The president's response] was a little bit frustrating,"
Lekos said. "The administration's stance on the issue has
not changed at all."
The letter mentioned the findings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Employment Purposes, an administrative group
that has investigated the issue of compensation of university employees. The committee found that out of the 12,722
people regularly employed by the university, 372 earn an
hourly wage below $lO. The report also states that only 194
of them earn less than $lO after the benefits have been considered. According to its report, these conclusions about
staff compensation are based on human resources data,
employee surveys, questionnaires mailed in five different
languages, independent surveys and interviews.
The committee recommended that the university enhance
employee benefits and provide educational opportunities like
a Bridge to Learning and Literacy program, which aims to
provide entry-level workers with classes in literacy and English as a Second Language. The campaign considers these
proposed changes inadequate. They have asked for a "living
wage" of $10.25 per hour in addition to benefits.
"Most of these workers work two to three shifts. They
can barely scrape by," Lekos said.
Besides asserting that benefits are not enough, the campaign advocates also noted that literacy and knowledge of
English in no way guarantees a worker a satisfactory wage.
"Indeed, Harvard proposes to continue offering these
employees compensation as low as $6.50 per hour without
benefits, whether they are literate or not," says the
campaign's Web site.
The police have been present on the site of the protest
since the first day. According to Lekos, the relationship
between the police and the protestors has been amicable.
Lekos said the protestors intend to stay in Mass Hall for as
long as is necessary to achieve their goals.

white community. She described the connection she has with her cultural roots
French-Canadian, Mohawk, Afro-Guyanese
and Indo-Guyanese
as "compartmentalized," surfacing most strongly when she associates with certain family members.
Laurel Kean 'O3 has had a similar experience. Her parents one black and one white
raised her in an area of Boston with a racially mixed population, and she has "always
identified as mixed."
During the Tri-College Pre-OrientationProgram for Students of Color, Ford and her classmates were asked to divide themselves up into
ethnic categories. "People who were multiracial were obviously left out," Ford said.
Drawing on these experiences, Ford,
Laura Damerville 'O3 and Karima Wilson 'O3
joined Kean last March to form Multi, an
open campus group for students who identify with multiple ethnicities, races, religions or anything else.
"No other group like this exists on campus, and so our goal is to offer a place for
these students to meet and share their experiences," said Erika Doyle 'O3, who joined
Multi this fall.
Ford described the attraction of Multi as
the chance to speak with students coming
from shared experiences, including racial
ambiguity and facing people who ask, "What
are you?" She said she felt "excited" at the
opportunity to surround herself with people
who have wondered about whether they
have to "choose" one of multiple identities.

"Our meetings are open, because we feel
that everybody should be included, no matter

what it is like not to fit into one category or

"Everyone is 'multi,'" Ford said, explaining that all students have "the potential to
date interracially or pick up a new faith."
"You're 'multi' because you live in the
United States," Kean added, pointing out the
wealth of cultural material that Americans
expose themselves to every day.
Multi is not a support group and has no
political agenda thus far. Instead, it serves
as an arena for socialization among students
with the shared experience of living out two
or more different cultures or being per-

ceived as such.

Anna Stratton 'O4 noted that most Multi
members were part white even though the
meetings are open to all students.
The experiences and needs ofmultiracial
students are "unique" when compared with
those of singular minorities, Kean said, although "they do overlap."
Kean said that, as a "person of color," she
had had "the experience of being a minor-

atheist/Christian

ity," although appearing "racially ambiguous" is not something most "monoracial
people" have experienced. However, Kean
explained, not all Multi members share this

experience, because some of them do appear
to fit into a specific racial group.
For this reason, Doyle said, "we wanted to
form Multi to give multiracial, -cultural, -ethnic, -religious students a voice on campus."
Kean said Multimembers did not form the
club because they were dissatisfied with the

fuction of ethnic support groups on campus
but because they knew multiethnic students
had needs that monoethnic ones would not
easily identify with. Kean, who also attends
meetings of the Swarthmore African-American Students Society, named that group as
an example.
"When you go to SASS," she said, "you
are black, which means that other half of
[you] is not present."
Ford, on the other hand, was surprised
when SASS placed her on their mailing list
and began to leaveher voice mails about thenevents. "I'd never really thought about that
side of myself or explored it," Ford said.
Stratton expressed a similar sentiment.
Always having identified as multiethnic
rather than Latina, she said she "doesn't
know much about HOLA" and thather high
school never offered any kind of ethnic organizations.
Doyle, who is half Guatemalan and half
Irish, also feels she can identify with a
monoethnic support group in addition to
Multi. She attends HOLA meetings, although

she says she "identifies [herself] as biracial...
as opposed to white or Latina. I am both of
these, not one or the other individually."
Over the weekend, members went to
Harvardfor the Fifth Annual Pan-Collegiate

Conference on the Mixed Racial Experience.
Although Swarthmore's multiethnic club
formed only last year, the conference is a

testament to the formation of similar groups
at other colleges.

Rostapshova wins
environmental award
BY HOFAN CHAU
Olga Rostapshova 'O2 has won the Morris Udall
Foundation's award for Scholarship and Excellence
in National Environmental Policy in recognition of
her commitment to the environment. Rostapshova
plans to use the $5,000 award for her tuition next year.
A double major in engineering and economics
with public policy and environmental studies concentrations, Rostapshova has devoted much of her
time to exploring the applications of economics and
engineering to the environment.
In particular, she has done fieldwork with engineering professor and environmental studies committee chair Arthur McGarity on the water quality
of Crum Creek and has helped develop educational
software on watershed modeling for high school students learning about pollution.
She is currently working with economics professor Larry Westphal on developing natural resource
models for fisheries and plans to spend her summer
working at MlT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.
Rostapshova said she was excited and felt it a
"great honor" to receive recognition as one of the 60
Udall scholars chosen this year from a national pool
of applicants.
McGarity, Rostapshova'a adviser, was "delighted"
to hear the news. "Olga has a really good mix [of]
both technical engineering and also in social science," he said. "Her breadth was important," he
added, and so was "the way she could demonstrate
[that] she could do both excellent work in engineer-

ing and economics."
The scholarship is named after K. Morris Udall,
who had significant influence in lawmaking in the
1970s and 1980s as a memberof the U.S. House of Rep-

resentatives.

His accomplishments include the Alaska Lands
Act of 1980, which doubled the size of the national
park system arid tripled the size of the national wilderness system.

Safety features to be added by fall semester
College budgets for professional shuttle drivers, private nighttime patrol officers, call boxes
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

Though plans to improve safety measures on campus are still in progress,

Student Council commended the
administration's efforts to improve
safety on campus in a timely fashion at
their meeting Monday.
"I'm really quite pleased about the
administration's response," SC Co-President Colin Moore 'O2 said. "I think they

are showing a genuine concern for student safety; they granted almost all of
the specific safety requests that Student

Council made."
Moore identified two developing proposals to improve safety: the hiring of an
outside security force for late-night
shuttles and nighttime patrol and the
erection of emergency call boxes in strategic locations around campus.
Explaining the proposal to hire outside security, Vice President for Facilities and Services Larry Schall said, "The

initial thought is to hire three adults for
each night, seven days a week, while students are on campus.
"One will drive the big van, another
will drive the small van, and a third will
patrol the campus by foot, concentrating in the area near the dining hall and
railroad tracks."
Currently, Swarthmore students staff
the vans and nighttime campus patrol.

Schall said he felt an outside secu-

rity force to patrol was necessary in
order to increase the reliability of nighttime security services on campus.
"The problem with the current program is that it's very difficult to get students to work
in the early morning
...

hours.
"If the shifts are [not covered], students can't rely on the service, and, if
students can't rely on the service, they
will use it less often," Schall explained.
Schall questioned if it was a good
idea to have students patrolling the
campus by foot during late night hours.
Though the possibility of combining
student and professional workers is still

being explored, Schall said he felt combining students and professionals in the
nighttime security force would complicate administrationand possibly render

the service less reliable. He also said he
was unsure about the minimum number of hours necessary to hire outside
security.
The current cost to run the nighttime

shuttles is about $45,000 per year, Schall
said. He anticipated an additional cost
of $25,000 per year to shift the program

to a non-student staff.
The second safety improvement
would be the erection of call boxes in
outdoorlocations around campus to improve access to Public Safety in case of

an emergency. The call boxes, Schall

said, would resemble the one located in
the lobby on the north end ofParrish and
would be "lit and visible" during nighttime hours.
Schall anticipates installing four such
boxes sometime over the summer on
buildings around campus. Call boxes
would be placed on either side of the tunnel to the field house, he said, with one
on the back of Sharpies and one on the
side of the heating plant. Additionally,
the college plans to place call boxes on
the rear of Beardsley and on Sharpies 111.
The proposed plan would also place
two other call boxes on either side of the
SEPTA tunnel. Schall explained, however, that because these boxes would not
be attached to a building they would take
longer to erect.
The possibility of having a call box
on the borough side of the SEPTA tunnel needs further investigation as the
college does not own the land there.
Moore said he thought these freestanding call boxes would "probably be
in place by next year."
Additional plans to improve safety involve a committee to walk around campus
and identify areas where additional light
ing should be installed, Schall said.
Plans to install security cameras around
campus have been abandoned due to lack
of student support.

McCabe Mile madness

Late night Tarble program fizzling
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
The late night food service at
Tarble, which sells pre-packaged

sandwiches and snacks as well as
canned soda and bottled juice to students between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., has
met with little success in its first
month of operation.

According to Linda McDougall,

director of dining services, "the late
night eatery is not doing very well."
McDougall said the late night eatery typically only serves eight to ten
customers a night, which is far less

than the level of use hoped for when
the service began operation in early
March.
In addition to a lack of customers,
the program has faced other problems.

According to McDougall, one of the
late night workers contracted bronchitis from excessive exposure to the cigarette smoke from Paces and the
gameroom that often fills Tarble lobby.
In addition, the cooler purchased
to keep food and beverages cold during the late night hours was recently

stolen.

McDougall said this lack of success

"We will probably give it another
shot in the fall," McDougall said, "but

it will only continue if it is more successful."

In addition, he said, "Mertz felt a

opened, renovations of Parrish will
begin, which will create a need for
alternate housing. During this time,
another dorm would probably serve
as the single-sex dorm, although
Hershey noted that "we don't really
have that much demand [for singlesex housing]."

Once Parrish is finished, the

col-

lege plans to do away with what
Gayley referred to as "sub-standa"rd
rooms." The six rooms in Danawell
that were originally lounges will be
converted back into lounges, and
rooms in the basement of Mary Lyons
will be eliminated. All six lodges will
probably become student group space
instead of housing, andParrish North
will become office space.
The new dorm will be coed and
will house students of all class years.
The exact configurationand number
of rooms have yet to be determined.
"We're trying to find the ideal size
of a hall," Gayley said. "It should be
an engaging hall life, but not too
much." The current estimate is
about 26 beds per floor, in two threestory sections, creating a dorm of
about 150 beds. The corridors,
Gayley said, would be 7'4" to 7'6"
wide, which is the same as Willets
and about two and a half feet wider

than Wharton.

One student asked if the dorm
would be similar to Mertz in its style.
"The relationship to Mertz will probably be more one of scale," Gayley
said. "I fully expect the building to
have stone on it, but I don't see Mertz
as an architectural gem that I would
want to emulate."

The new dormitory would cost
around $l7 million, according to Director ofFacilities Stu Hain, who was
present at the meeting. He said the
college is now trying to start endow-

ments for the maintenance costs of
all new buildings, which may drive
up the price.

Living loud
Sometimes it pays to make a little noise. It often
pays doubly to make a lot of noise.
Although proponents of a living wage at

Swarthmore have been quiet recently, the debate over
a living wage has erupted loudly at Harvard. The
Progressive Student Labor Movement (PSLM), a
group of campus protestors, has been occupying
Massachusetts Hall in Harvard Yard and demanding
that Harvard implement a living wage for its employees (see story, pg. 5).
The protest and by extension, the campaign for
a living wage has garnered support from Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Sen. John Kerry (DMass.) and John J. Sweeney, president of the AFLCIO, and coverage from the national media. Yet in the
halls of Harvard itself, many
including The
Crimson, Harvard's student newspaper
question
the appropriateness of the demonstration.
Yes, the protest has been disruptive. But protests
should be aspire to be disruptive
many successful
ones are. The PSLM protest has been loud, and it has
been successful in most estimations, pressuring
Harvard's administration to address the issue of a
living wage and raising awareness of the issue both at
Harvard and throughout the nation.
Similarly, all protests should be considered by
those at whom they are directed. It's all too easy to
brush off a protest as "inappropriate." Although
protests sometimes step over the bounds of civility, as
in the WTO riots in Seattle and the King riots in Los
Angeles, there are usually substantive issues behind
such forceful action, whether it is expressed in the
action or not. From the living wage to the athletics
cuts, the protests signal profound discontent with the
way things are.
We don't condone forceful protests at any time.
The protestors must be smart enough to know when
not to fight
as Mind the Light has done by deciding
not to protest at graduation
and when to raise a
ruckus. With the momentum the PSLM has gained, it
should continue to scream at the top of its lungs.

Calendar concern
Hey, you. Put down this paper. We need you to do
us a favor.
See that senior over there? Yeah, that one the
one surrounded by books, with those oh-so-fashionable bags under her eyes. Go over there and tell her
that the administration decided to push ahead and
shorten the exam period this year.
What's that, you say? That wasn't very nice?
Exactly. The proposal to shorten the exam period is
like some sick joke, a sadistic bid to see just how
severely Swatties can twitch. The exam period is
short enough already, especially with the inevitable
crush of papers due at the end ofclasses.
A shortened exam period would be even worse for
Honors students. The exam period is perhaps the only
time Honors students have to work exclusively on their
preparations. For athletes and others who devote
significant time to extracurricular activites, the exam
period, at least under the 14-week schedule, is one of
the few times when they are free of such commitments.
Similarly, the length of the semester should
remain at 14 weeks. Already, classes here move at
breakneck speed, especially seminars trying to cover
a significant amount ofmaterial in depth, and intro
classes attempting to survey the highlights of a field.
Why try to cram the same amount of material into a
smaller space, or worse yet, sacrifice important
material? Because the length of the spring and fall
semesters doesn't match? Because it takes an extra
week? Because Honors examiners' airfares are a little
more expensive than they might be?
Try again. Until there are more convincing and
less harmful reasons to change the calendar, we urge
students, faculty and administration to vote to retain

the current calendar.

Editorial misrepresented WSRN's problems
Dear Editor:
Last week's editorial ("Rebuilding WSRN") painted a
melodramatic scene of a radio station gone bad. The editorial exaggerated the station's problems and misrepresented
the past and present states of WSRN. We would like to clear
up the misconceptions and address The Phoenix's suggestions.

WSRN's production and training is designed for a smallscale college radio station, not for commercial or vocational
use. WSRN's primary purpose is to provide students and
the community with opportunities to learn about the production and listening sides of radio, rather than to serve as
a training ground for professional DJs.
While there are few radio stations for which a WSRN D J
would be qualified to work immediately after graduation,
this reflects the uniqueness of WSRN, not its inadequate
training. Commercial radio station music (and even that
played on WXPN) is picked and played by a computer, and
public radio, like WHYY, produces exclusively talk and news
shows.
All DJs are trained to operate typical station functions,
and interested students are also trained to use the more
complex features of studio B. WSRN plans to improve DJ
training for next year, but the Phoenix's depiction of the
DJ stuck in the headlights of the turntables is an anomaly.
The skill expectations forWSRN DJs allow interested students (even freshmen) to gain first-hand broadcasting experience in a laid-back but adequately structured atmosphere.

The editorial's primary concern was with a lack of service to the community, but contrary to what it suggested,
WSRN's long-standing tradition of scheduling shows based

on type actually serves listeners better than juxtaposing different genres would. If a listener tunes in around a certain
time each day, she will find the content of shows consistent
throughout the week.
Carefully ordering shows by genre helps broadcasting to
flow from one program to the next and increases crossover
listenership. Though students have diverse musical tastes,
it is unlikely that a punk rock aficionado will stay tuned for
even a great classical show. Haphazardly scheduling diverse
music at any time of day could potentially discourage listeners from further exploring WSRN's new and unique programming. Genre blocking is a mechanism designed to introduce
listeners to music they will likely enjoy, not a way to "punish" classical DJs.
As the editorial noted, promoting the radio station through
fliers alone is a difficult task, and this year especially, there
is room for improvement. The best method of promotion is
mobilizing all DJs to get the word out. If you are DJ, tell a
friend when your show is or ask them to call the studio for a
request. If you are not a DJ, you probably know one or have
one on your hall. Do your friends the favor of listening to
their shows, and let them know what you think. Independent music is a grassroots affair, so support must start with
the community.
Contrary to the editorial's portrayal, WSRN produces and
schedules its programming conscientiously. Though the
Phoenix at times misrepresents WSRN and recently became
reluctant to promote the station's schedule, the editorial did
bring deserved attention to the station. We are continually
working to improve our broadcast and aural services, and
we invite any comments or suggestions through board members or wsrn-board@sccs.swarthmore.edu.

was actually Feb. 13,1948. Also, in a survey taken in

October 1990, most students said they did not listen to
the news on WSRN regularly. The other poll results quoted
in the story were from a survey taken in the fall of 1997.
In the Player of the Week feature on pg. 20, one of Joko

Books: 'They don't belong to you!'
BY TED CHAN
Chen Po-ta was an important member of the Chinese Communist Bureacracy under Mao Zedong, serving as a member
of the Cultural Revolution Group and as head of propaganda
until the end of 1970. While those are impressive accomplishments for a public servant in China, I
probably only noticed him because in a
chapter about him in a book I was reading for seminar, someone had written in
"to" after Chen Po-ta. Chen Po-ta-to. Haha. Very funny.
Admittedly, I cracked up the first time
I saw it. But the person who decided to
inject this levity into my studies wrote it
not once in the book, not twice, but in
every reference. At least 50 times. Writ-

is so common that by now I
should have learned to ignore it. But I
haven't.
It's hard to read a 300-page book
where somebody has highlighted every
unimportant line. Or even worse, poorly
underlined (which is sometimes equivalent to strike-through). Also irritating
are notes, comments and assorted psychoanalyses written in margins, or poor
imitations of Picasso, Van Gogh or Groening.
And I don't know why anyone would draw on historical
photos in books. If you've made a practice of it, please stop.
As Marge Murphy said the other day, "They don't belong to
ing in books

twenty years ago, one that looked like it hadn't been taken out
in 15 years. I've seen things signed "J.T. '67" or "Joe was here:

kind of cool to know someone read this book twenty years
ago. Unfortunately, the people who leave their initials on the
corner of the page are also those who write stupid comments
in margins and underline like they're

you!"
Writing in books is an age-old practice. "Chen Potato" was
in a political science book about China published at least

finger painting.
Go back to an article written by
Michelle Lee two weeks ago about paper
waste in McCabe, consider how many
people tie up printers spitting out thousand-word web documents they'll never
read and how many people keep books
sitting around in their rooms that others need for their theses, and you see a
growing level ofacademic disrespect.

I know for a fact that this level is far
lower at Swarthmore than at other
places I've been. In high school, I once
waited an hour to print a graph for a final project because some idiots were
printing fake $1 bills. I guess those kids
learned their lesson, because the secret
service wasn't nearly as forgiving.
If I'm forgiving here, it's only because
it's the only copy of a book that I need to
read for seminar tomorrow and that has been out of print
longer than $2 bills, and I don't have time to track down the
person who used psychedelic highlighters in March of 1993 in
a book about suburban Milwaukee. Nevertheless, forgiven or
forgotten, sacred Quaker text from the Treasure Room or last
week's Economist, it's important that everyone respect academic materials that are for public use.

around sex and sexuality. Some felt that the option would
create sexual tension and anxiety, distract students and lead
to intractablerelationship troubles (sound familiar?). One student, however, declared that "open visiting hours, the birth
control pill, and the general liberalism in society that accompanied it" made coed dorms "inevitable."
Surprisingly, though, The Phoenix reported that, after a
year's trial period, most students who lived in coed dorms reported "no effect" or "don't know" when asked whether the
policy had affected "promiscuity, clique formation [or] dating."
Dating and relationships

this fall, when a very small number of students will live in
coed suites in the Lodges and Worth. It reflected the fact that
some folks at Swat are worried about coed housing, even
though Wesleyan, Haverford, and Hampshire are still standing, and have much more substantial coed rooming policies
than Swat will.
I would like to help out with a historical perspective on
what Fischette calls "the myopic permissiveness that is the
modern college." I would like to take you back in time to
Swarthmore in the era of Free Love.
On April 2L 1970, the Phoenix's lead headline declared,
"Committee Approves Co-ed Housing; Experiment to Include
Four Dorms." The Apollo 13 crisis had just ended, and "Let it
Be" was the No. 1 single in America. Campus activists (including then-Assistant Professor Thompson Bradley) were
trying to keep away Dow Chemical recruiters; others were
demanding resources for black students. And, in fall 1970, four
Swarthmore dorms had both men's and women's halls, and
one Wharton—had men's and women's rooms on the same
floors.
One year later, in April, 1971, a survey indicated that most
students believed coed dorms had improved morale and
strengthened friendships. "At Swarthmore, the implementation ofcoed dorms had less than spectacular results," wrote a
columnist, capping two years of very public controversy over
the introduction of what was then widely referred to as "coed
housing." All the students surveyed who were thenliving in
a coed dorm, and an overwhelming majority of the rest, said
they wanted to live in coed dorms the following fall.
A "coed housing" option, however, had not come without
a fight. The idea was first floated in fall 1969, after students
successfully lobbied to abolish the double standard under
which women's dorms had much stricter curfews and visiting rules than men's dorms. At that point, some students agitatedfor the administration to go further by allowing some
dorms to have both men's and women's floors. The committee and Student Council asked these students to submit a detailed proposal, and they did so.
In February, newly inaugurated President Robert Cross
vetoed the proposal, saying it didn't meet "criteria for insuring appropriate privacy and enthusiasm of those affected."
The administration emphasized the need for further study;
the deans said coed housing only someday might be tried on
a small-scale, experimental basis. One dean urged students

environment in classrooms, libraries and dining hall
did
not seem to alter radically once coeducation entered the domestic space of the dormitory.
After a successful semester and a half, there were few complaints; the most common was from women, who said coed
dorms were noisier than all-women's dorms. A Phoenix columnist declared that in spite of the previous year's debate,
"now to suggest that there might be something
anything
bad about coed dorms is an open admission of unhipness, or
senility, or worse."
Thus, just when administrators at all-male Haverford and
Wesleyan were discovering that coeducation did not, as predicted, hurt alumni contributions, Swarthmore's administrators gave in. "Nobody: alumni, Board members, students, nobody, according to [Dean of Women] Townsend, is against coed
dorms," wrote a Phoenix columnist. Even President Cross
declared that the option was "no longer probationary in any
sense."

Research aided by Elizabeth Weber's 1996 Phoenix article
on coed dorms, available at http://

thesis on the decline of parietal rules at Swat.

IN
PUBLIC

Let's make a deal
In 1992, Pat Buchanan told supporters that his
presidential campaign was a battle in the "cultural
war" against all that liberalism had come to stand
for. Multiculturalism, abortion, racial preferences,
immigration, drug use, crime, secularism, gay rights
and sexual permissiveness: if conservatives didn't
fight, and fight hard, then sex, drugs and rock and

roll would overwhelm American culture forever. It
was a timefor taking sides, for saving American culture from those who would take it away.
Is this war over yet? In 2001, our Republican president is a "compassionate conservative" with at least
one openly gay man in his administration. He says
he is "a uniter, not a divider," and he doesn't want to
abolish the Department of Education. It does not look
like he, or too many other politicians, are fighting a
cultural war.

Andrew Sullivan, the conservative gay political
journalist, said as much in a New York Times Magazine piece last month. "Maybe it was the sight of
James Gandolfini, of Tony Soprano fame, playing a
gay mobster in the recent movie 'The Mexican' that
really brought it home to me," he writes. "Is the culture war over or what?"
But I'm not sure the best way to figure out the
answer to that question is to flip through the newspapers, or the TV channels, looking for ordinary
things that would have ignited political fires ten years
ago.

Instead, we should figure out whether the political values we think we hold dear are really so critical after all.
Let's look at it this way. We can value things in
terms of what they're worth to us, or we can value
them intrinsically. That is, some things we'll trade
for other things, and some things are simply not for
sale.
When two countries engage in absolute war, the
thing they are fighting over is not for sale; or if it is,
it's none too cheap. If it were, someone would prob-

ably pay up.
In the culture wars, the political ground was not
for sale. Liberals weren't about to trade abortion
rights for gay rights; or if they were, conservatives
weren't interested.
The theory, then, is this: if the culture wars are
over, thenintrinsic values are out and the barter system is in. Or, in the oft-repeated words of Bush economicadvisor Larry Lindsey, "It's all about trade-offs."
So, are we ready to make a deal? Even if this is
possible, it won't be easy. Ideological bargaining is
no Saturday afternoon at the antiques auction, and
it's no 12-player, three-way NBA trade either. We're
talking about the sheer crudeness of saying things
like "I'll give you affirmative action if you give me
the war on drugs."
So here's my package. The left (Democrats and
Naderites, that's you) must forever relinquish its
conventional positions on taxing-and-spending, welfare-as-we-knew-it, affirmative action, capital punishment, the war on drugs, free trade, gun control and
school vouchers. And the right (Republicans and
worse, that's you) must never again make a fuss over
gay rights, abortion, immigration and this new fed-

eral faith-based stuff.
Personally, I think this is pretty fair. I mean, if
we're going to be talking about trade-offs, this seems
fairly balanced. Right?
What? No deal? Why, I'm shocked, I tell you,

shocked!

Let's face it: nobody's accepting a culture war
peace treaty not this cockamamie formulation, not
some other guy's, none. Pro-life advocacy, gay rights:

these are not tradable commodities, and for good rea-

son! They are political issues that are essential to
our very ways oflife. Striking a deal, and thenliving
with it, wouldn't be worth it. Not even close.
So for now, it's a war of attrition. Choose your
side, load your weapons, and don't take no for an

answer.

And finally, the
not so big finish
Now, there's no way this can be otherwise
than anticlimactic. You remember the last episode of "Seinfeld." Was it good? Yeah, it was
okay. Was it "last episode" good? No, probably
not. And that's the problem. Being the "last"
puts one at a disadvantage. No matter how good
it is, it's never "last column" good. So we're
not even going to try.
For the less bright among you, all this is prelude to the fact that, barring catastrophe, and
probably even in the event of catastrophe, this
will be my ultimatecolumn. Everyone together:
"Awww ..." Yes, that's right, someone else will
have to go out on a limb and risk being misinterpreted as being pro-rape and whatever other
things about whichpeople have complained over

I have alienated at least as many people as those
to whom I have endeared myself. To err orsucceed greatly is the hallmark of an active mind.
I was going to go back over some of my past

ofThePhoenix online editors, and try to explain
or correct some misunderstanding between me,

seems), so I’m willing to absolve the community
at large from about half of the problems. Your

So this will not be a greatest hits column. No
one likes reheated jokes, anyway. I would, of
course, like to pseudo-cynically thank The Phoenix; I do not recall them ever have substantively
cut an article or a thought with it. Once, I did
send them a column consisting of the lyrics to
Skee-Lo’s “I Wish,” which they said they wouldn’t
print, whichI understand, being, by me, more a
test of their editorial limits than something I really wished published. They even ran the nowlegendary “big finish” column, which, in all honesty, I never thought would cause thedisturbance
it did. Given the range of political/sexual (essay
question: are the two separate?) opinion expressed, oftentimes before my very eyes, I thought
a little male sexual fantasy/frustration would
hardly cause anyone to bat a lash, so to speak.
I also must thank my readers, of whom there
are allegedly more than twelve, whose encouragement and antipathy toward the printed word
with the exception of this column has inspired
me to go about a year longer than I had anticipated. Also to those who have provided inspiration and column inches, whether willingly or
unwillingly, through the threeyears. If you have
ever spoken to me personally, you know that
what was said should be taken with the mix of
utter disinterest and devout sincerity that is one
of the few bastions of meaning left to us.
This, then, I suppose, is my retirement from

pass the torch on to another if there were a

A collective utterance for democracy
Dear Editor:

On Tuesday, April 17, the Learning for
Life Program presented me with the privilege of meeting with Swarthmore workers,
staff, and students. I asked these various
white, black, Asian, young, middle-aged
and elderly
American citizens to examine, and imagine, democracy; what doesdemocracy mean? What would an actual democracy require?
To my thrilled surprise, most of these
very different people placed their trust in
our workshop as a safe space in which they
could exercise their freedom of speech and

test American principles of one man-one
vote/one man-one voice, each voice equal
to each other voice.
At the same time, three participants
apparently felt that they should "report"
the workshop contributions of another
participant to his boss, and that they

should, further, make this report anonymously, and that they needed, still further,
to anonymously protest having been "setup"; they had expected a poetry workshop,
and had instead found themselves in the
presence of "an activist talking about democracy." Consequently, the anonymously
"accused" worker was called in and made
to account for his thoughts
to his boss.
Is it possible that somebody can be punished for attending a workshop on democ-

racy and speaking his mind? That this
sorry aftermath violates the freedom of
speech inherent in American citizenship
must be obvious. That those anonymous
informants apparently knew little about
fundamentalrights and dueprocess reveals
a very regrettable ignorance that may cost
one innocent, and now certainly intimidated, American, his job.
Therefore, I most respectfully request
that Swarthmore College provide every
segment of your community with copies
of our American Bill of Rights: Please un-

dertake this educational task; help folks
to understand its implications, day to day,
boss to worker, teacher to student, citizen

It takes the whole team

Below are my notes from our Collective
Talking Together for the Sake of Democ1. We'd be responsible for each other
2. We'd enjoy equality to speak and equality to be heard
3. Minorities would be protected
4. Our rights would be clear to us, and to
others
5. We'd abide by the Golden Rule
6. We'd achieve self determination and,

therefore, no people would be perceived
as or used as property
7. We'd put and we'd keep people at the top:
above money, above land, above material
things.

That was our collective, 7-point blue-

print.

Then I asked everybody to examine, and
imagine, each ofthese conditionsfor democracy, more concretely, so that no one would
ask, "What are you trying to say?"

Graduation woes
A friend of mine
a non-Swattie is not walking in
his graduation this year. He has a pithy response to inquiries on the subject: "I hate my school." He can cite numerous instances of gross racism
one sorority house
has Confederate flags in half its windows and not one, but
two black lawn jockeys at the door and other forms of
bigotry that his college either openly or tacitly endorses.
He doesn't believe in what his school stands for, and he
doesn't believe it fulfills even its own questionable standards. He says he doesn't want to take part in a ceremony
that celebrates something he doesn't believe in.
I think he's making the wrong decision. This is not
because I believe in his school's offensive politics. It's
because I believe inhim and because thatis the belief,
the honorand the celebrationthat graduation is all about.
When your four years are up, and you walk across the
stage to get your proof of purchase, mat walk can be as
much oras littleabout the institution as you want it to be.
It is, and has to be, mostly about you. True, the banners
around you, as well as the script on your diploma, will
scream the name of the grindstone to which you've put
your nose. You will start that final walk, however, to the
soundof your own name—andend by receiving it in writing, above the degree that encapsulates all the grinding.
Graduationis not so much about what is being left as
it isabout those who are leaving it, about what they will
take with themand what they will leavebehind. It's about

what you did, kids, and how well you did it
and my
wrath has room for anyone and everyone who would try
to take any small part of that celebration away from you.

Including yourselves.

Swat and the art of losing it
BY JACKIE APONTE
As I write this, it is April 24. When
you read this (ifyou're like me and snatch
up The Phoenix first thing Thursday
morning), it will be April 26. This date
may be of no significance to you. For me,
it will mark one month since I walked
away from the short-term-stay unit of the
HorshamInstitute—onemonthsince my
release from what will hopefully be my
only stay in a mental hospital.
You may wonder how I wound up in

a mental hospital. Or perhaps you've already heard. Believe me
word gets
around in the most interesting ways.
For example, upon arriving back at
Swat, I discovered that the friendly,
young EMT whom I immediately recognized as family and gabbed with the
whole way to Horshamhad relayed my
tale of woe to a Swattie he knew, who
in turn asked a "friend" of my now-exgirlfriend about thewhole fiasco. How's

that for a small world?
If you didn't have the good fortune
of being informed by one of my medical practitioners of the details of my
little adventure, you'll have to suffer in
ignorance. I'll give you this much
let's just say that Public Safety gets
pretty darned concerned when they get
a call about a crazed Swattie being on
the roof of the porch of Pittenger. They
get even more concerned when said
Swattie attempts to evade the consequences of her little episode by
scootering top-speed down Route 320.
Those antics, combined with other
more mundane factors, like clinical depression, codependency and midtermtime, landed me in theHorshamInstitute.
Before I left my dorm room, I nearly

grabbed my copy of "Girl, Interrupted"

off my bookshelf. Considering where I
knew I'dbe going that day, I thought better of it and took something else to read.
It turned out that my stay at Horsham
was (luckily) quite dissimilarfrom the
depiction of life in a mental hospital
given in "Girl, Interrupted" (though I
wouldn't have minded a bit if Angelina
Jolie, or even Winona Ryder for that matter, had been a fellow patient). The unit
that I stayed on was for people who were
essentially in touch with reality, who
could just aboutfunction normally in the
real world, but who simply needed some
time to deal with the burden that lifehad
dumped upon them, a burden just a bit
too heavy to bear. Yes, the people in the
so-called loony bin aren't mad straightjacketed folk; rather, they're a lot like,
well, most Swatties. They've just gotten
that extra nudge and have crossed over
the line of being able to handle life.
If time to dealwith our respective is-

that allows the seratonin in my brain to
do its thing, I was released back into the

realize that, yes, Swarthmore is included

in that designation. One slightly-rocky

month later, and I'm healthier than I've
ever been at Swat—maybe even healthier

than I've ever been, period.
The moral of my story? Those T-shirts
that they sell at the bookstore that say
"Swarthmore
Contents Under Pressure"? Well, they're not exaggerating. We
all know that Swarthmore is a pressure
cooker. A bunch ofoverachieving, brainy
students, plus a bunch of overachieving,
brainy professors, plus a surplus of causes
and activities to put too much of one's
time into, plus a student population so
small that relationships become too intense too fast and you're constantly in
contact with the very people who you
shouldperhaps stay far away from—this
is indeed an equation that can add up to
insanity. And if you've got baggage from

certainly what we got. For my entire stay,

So, my advice to you

self-destructivebehaviors like I hadbeen
doing here; I couldn't ignore my problems or attempt to bury myself in my
work; I couldn't remain in the endless
cycles that had driven me to such a desperate point. I was (very gently, and with
much assistance) forced to figure out
what was going on inside my pain-addled
brain, whatI needed to change in my life
so that I might never wind up in a similar situation again. Armed with a
helluvalot more self-knowledge than I
went in with, some handy-dandy coping
skills, and a prescription for the Prozac

lurks inside of you, and do it as quickly
as you can. No, Psych Services isn't perfect but it's helped me and many other
Swatties immensely. Take advantage of
free therapy before you graduate and have
to pay to get someone to. help you solve
your problems! Or talk to your friends.
Or write. Or create music. Or play rugby.
Or knit. Do something, anything, to keep
yourself healthy and sane, lest you wind

physically
that I, along with many
Swatties before me, found myself in.

release. Re-

I've received various informal assurances from Mind
the Light supporters that there are no protests planned for
graduation day. I have yet to see any formal claim of this
kind, however, issued by the organization itself— and have
seen several more informal (read: Daily Jolt Forum posts)
claims to the contrary. A friend ofmine posted an indignant plea for an undisrupted ceremony, noting that she
was flying her mother into the United States from thousands ofmiles away to celebrate with her, and would be
sorry to see the occasion turn sour. She was met with a
response from someone who claimed to be an alumnus
and MTL supporter. This individual shared with her,
among other pearls of wisdom, the opinion that it might

be good for her mother to witness a traditionalAmerican
likening said potential proprotest against oppressors
test to the original flight of the pilgrims from their native
lands in the name of religious freedom.
This did little to calm my fears.
Even less reassurance is provided me by the main
defense I have heard of MTL graduation activity: insistent claims that decisions regarding such action will be
made by Swarthmore seniors, not by alumni or others.
A few dozen angry MTL members do not speak for a
graduating class of around 350, and until every single
person in that class has come out in favor of MTL's "presence" at the ceremony, I'd say those who would like to
make that presence known ought to consider themselves
uninvited unless they behave.
I can't claim to know the anger and betrayal senior MTL
members feel. If, like my stubborn friend, they were to
refuse to take part in graduation because of their opinions
of the college's actions, I would be sorry to see them willing to forgo the moment of glory they have earned and
sad to hear that the institutional backdrop took priority,
in their eyes, over the individualachievements in the foreground on that celebratory day. I would, however, respect
their decision, as I respect that of my friend. If he can allow his fellow students to graduate in a joyful and peaceful setting despite his many grievances with the school,
then MTL members can do the same. There are plenty of
other forums for protest, and he has made use of them at
his school, as MTL has at ours. He knows that at theend of
the day, graduation is more about the people walking than
the place they walk away from. One can only hope that
Swarthmore students and alumni will be as mature.
I hope that the rumors I'm hearing are blown far out of
proportion. I'd love to see an official statement saying as
much. Until then: no matter what happens, Class of 2001,
you are amazing, and June 4 is your day.

"Art history, like most of the interpretive disciplines in the
humanities, is constantly in a state of transformation," said
Michael Cothren, professor of art history. As a result, since the
two young professors whom the department has hired "are new
Ph.D.s in art history, they come into the discipline at a different
place," Cothren said.
Some changes in the discipline are methodological, or
changes in the way of interpretation. For example, "the way that
modern art is taught is now much more inclusive and
multicultural. There is greater variety in the backgrounds and
origins of the artists who are highlighted" Cothren said.
Cothren said when he studied art history in the 19705, the
history of modernism starting in the mid 19th-century was
taught mostly as "a great series of heroic men who created new
ways of painting." Their story has not been set aside, he said,
but it has been inflected in new ways. Students today study a
wider variety of modern art and artists.
This move toward greater diversity has occurred at

our case before the CEP and the Provost," he said.
With three open art history positions, the department has had the
opportunity to change its focus. "We did sit back and think about the shape of
the department," Cothren said. "There were no drastic decisions to change the
areas of specialization covered by tenured faculty, because it was inconceivable
to us that we could have a program in art history that did not include both a
specialist in European Renaissance and Baroque and a specialist in modern

art."

According to Cothren, it is important to keep a renaissance/baroque
specialist in the department because "the discipline of art history itself grew
up in a meaningful way around the study of 16th and 17th century painting in
the European tradition. In order to be critical about art history as an interpretive
discipline, students need to understand the primary material out of which art
history grew in the first place."
As for the significance of modern art, many new ways of thinking about art
European painting, Cothren
history developed through the study of
explained. By studying modern art, students also learn a wide range of critical
approaches to art history.
Moreover, modern art courses are important for studio art majors in the
department. "For them, it's important to see the more recent past," Cothren
said. "It shows them the heritage out of which they may be working."
Referring to the position Graybill leaves behind, Cothren said, "no decision
has been made about [that], so I'm sure the department will discuss it."

commitment was
made that of the things we teach, not all of [them] will be from
the European or American tradition. We will teach things from
some other cultural perspective." Cothren said there are many
such traditions to choose from, including those of Asia, Africa
and Islamic societies.
But the most significant change in art history has been that
"much more attention is directed to the way knowledge is
created," Cothren said. While in college, he said, he did not give
much thought to how the generalizations presented to him in
his survey classes had been formed. "I thought of them as truth,
not as constructed knowledge," he said.
Today, that has changed. "There is much more awareness in
the discipline as a whole now about the way that we control the
shape of knowledge," Cothren said.
Most students come to Swarthmore ill-prepared for visual
analysis. This, Cothren said, "is a shame because the culture in
which we live is becoming increasingly visual. In spite of this,
we're not preparing children to read images critically, the way
we teach them to read texts critically as early as kindergarten."
According to Cothren, art department PDCs were developed
to give Swarthmore students "a heavy dose of the kind of
intellectual process that's involved in discovering meaning in
works of visual art. With that sort of practice, it is easier to be
responsible consumers of the visual information that bombards
us in non-artistic contexts continually."

OPTIMISM
PISS OFF PISS OFF
PISS OFF PISS OFF

HAPPY HAPPY
HAPPY HAPPY
PESSIMISM
One of the defining moments of
every person's life comes in deciding which side to take in the ancient debate between Optimism

and Pessimism. Is life, we all must
ask ourselves, "weary, stale, flat,
and unprofitable," as Hamlet
would have us believe, or is it, as
some equally eloquent anonymous
soul put it, "swell"?
Before pledging our allegiance
either way, we ought to survey the
rich history of the two sides.
First: the pessimists. The word
"pessimism" is derived from the
two Latin roots "pes," meaning
"really irritating," and "simism,"
meaning "person who bitches and
moans about everything." Pessi-

mism was first born thousands of
years in ago in ancient Israel,

where King Solomon proclaimed
that all is vanity and vexation of

spirit and that only evil deeds are
done under the sun and that nothing is new under the sun and that
you'll only end up getting skin
cancer if you stay out under the

sun, etc. Every Bible lover is fa-

miliar with his memorable words
in Ecclesiastes:
And I saideth unto myself: Self,
I saideth, there is nothing new
under the sun. For if something
were new, man could sayeth, Behold! this is new. And man cannot
sayeth this. For if man should

sayeth "this is new," he must needs
meaneth hehath found something
new. And....
From Israel pessimism migrated, as upon a dark cloud, to
Ireland.There it was taken up and
dispersed by the famous
Flannigan Murphy, whose set of
laws spread the downbeat doctrinelike wildfire. This set oflaws
deserves to be numbered among
the most influential tracts of history, along withLuther's ninetyfive theses, the Magna Carta and
the autobiography of Britney
Spears.
Eventually, legend has it,
Murphy attempted to take his own
life with a firearm, but, fittingly,
the trigger jammed.
Since Murphy, there havebeen
several periods during which pessimism inflamed the whole of the
civilized world. During the Great
Depression, for instance, if you
wanted to get some gas for your
car, you had to specify to the serviceman how much of the tank you
wanted left empty.
Then there is optimism. Scholars can not determine precisely
where or when optimism first
drew breath, but recent findings

indicate that it was a short time
after the discovery of the opium

plant. At any rate, we know with certainty that, by the time the middle
ages came around, optimism had completely died out, and everyone stopped
being happy. From that point, optimism did not return until the seventeenth century in England, where
manners and social decorum obliged
everyone to pretend they loved life
even if they were absolutely miserable
by frequently using such phrases
as "how very charming indeed!" and
"by my troth! a fine day today!"
For example, if the Duchess of
York invited you to court for supper

and asked you whether her crumpets
were to your taste, you would smile
pleasantly and

thought that they tasted like Purina

remark that they were

"right excellent! your ladyship."
Then the romantic era dawned,
and people began to shake off dusty
conventionality and truly exult in life.
It was then that they discovered, as
though for the first time, a crazy little
thing called Love, which they pronounced "Loove," just to give it a dramatic ring. Love was the cause of happiness and hopefulness for a great
many. Smitten by cupid's airy dart,
people ran into the streets singing and
frolicking, and proclaimed that only
bachelors and maidens could hate life:
O love! they wrong thee much
That say thy sweet is bitter,
When thy rich fruit is such

As nothing can be sweeter.
Of course, however, this died out
quickly, and hardly anyone believes
it anymore, mostly on account of the

Ricki Lake Show. It is true, however,
that if one looks closely, a strain of
the general sentiment can still be
found in modern times. It is memorably embodied, for instance, in the
rich, melodious cadences of Jay-Z:
You know I thug em, [read poetry
to] em, love 'em, leave 'em;
'Cuz I don't [by any stretch of the

imagination] need 'em.
Take em out of the hood, keep 'em
looking good;
But I don't [by any stretch of the
imagination] feed 'em.
Shakespeare, look to your laurels!
So, having considered in detailthe
history of this puzzling, ever spinning, never-landing two-sided coin of
Optimism vs. Pessimism, we now
need to decide, once and for all, which
side is better. In what follows, I hope
to make the choice clear, using the
tried-and-trueargumentative method
of generalizing over a single personal
experience which by itself indicates
nothing, but which is really effective
in making an unsubstantiatedclaim
seem plausible.
I myselfhad always been ofa cynical turn, but a few days ago something
happened to forever change my outlook on life. As I was moping around,
bemoaning the vanity of human existence, I went, ever so miserable, to
carry out the wearisome task of getting laundry from the dryer, all the
while considering how much vexation of spirit would result from having to fold my clothes. When I entered
the laundry room I saw something so
incredible that I nearly fell upon the
ground in disbelief. All my clothing,
every last article, was folded as neat
as can be, placed in an orderly pile,
sorted according to garment type and
color and crowned thoughtfully with

a chocolate mint.
Well, maybe there was no chocolatemint.But still! Foldedand sorted!
Even I don't fold my own clothes; I
opt generally to throw them in one

indiscriminate, wrinkle-inducing
pile and hope that if my outfits end
up making me look like one of the
California Raisins, I'll go unnoticed.
But here we have some lofty soul
who, without any hope of personal
benefit, took time out of his or her
busy schedule to fold the clothes of a
complete stranger. At first I thought
it was some kind of quid pro quo deal
whereby I was expected to do something in return, and so I began to look
around for a message or note indicating the name ofmy benefactorand

what he or she wanted. But I found

nothing.
This, friends, was an act of absolutely anonymous philanthropy, a
shining example ofunadulterated selflessness. With this great deed in view,

can anyone deny that there are good

Audrey Chan Phoenix Staff

things done under the sun? Can anyone deny that pessimism, for all its
past triumphs, is now a dead letter
and that the optimistic shallrule over
all the earth?
Reflecting further, I began thinking to myself: What if everyone did
everyone else's laundry? Then we
would never have to do our own laundry! It would be but a small step to

Nirvana. Mankindwould be united in
a universal brotherhood, and there
would be no one who did not cherish
and embrace life.
But there will always be those, you
might say, who will hate life and be
bitter. And you are probably right.
This is true, for example, with lawyers, who are incurably bitter, because all mankind, including the most
loving and progressive-minded
people, think that anyone with a law
degree is about as upstanding and
morally-principled as ordinary bread
mold. If you are a lawyer, you must

live under the constant stigma of
being conniving, ruthless, rapacious, underhanded, fork-tongued,
ill-tempered, bad- mannered,
surly, contentious, whiny, irritating in short, Alan Dershowitz.
And no matter how many good

deeds you do, or how much you
add to the general happiness of the
world at large, you must face the
undeniablefact that everyone you
come in contact with, even your
closest friends and possibly your
parents, will hide their silverware
and expensive China before you
visit their household.
But, barring a small minority, most ofmankind can live as
one in peace and harmony, if we
all look beyond ourselves toward the greater good. And, in
that spirit, if you ever need
someone to do your laundry, I'd
love to give you a hand, but I
can't fold clothes.

MATHURIN'S LENS STROKES THE
FRUIT, WHICH PLEADS TO BE
NOTICED AND APPRECIATED.

Every great band starts out small. Dave Matthews Band
played little clubs in the college town of Charlottesville,
Va. before they scored with "What Would You Say" and
found themselves fully thrust into international stardom.
The Swarthmore alternative band Ellipsis seems to have a
similar love of music and determination to stay united.

Could they be headed down the road to fame? With their

"authentic" blondes, from Coney Island to toilets in
Baltimore, and with drag queens, flowers, and the beach
all finding their way into the show.
I think that this is an occasion for us to appreciate a
little glimpse of what makes people tick. Of what
captures their interest and of how they express that
interest.
Two photographs in particular caught my eye. One
was "The Gap," by Allegra Gordon 'Ol There is
something at once amusing and quite disturbing about
the photo. It is of the inside of the store, of the
mannequins whose "ideal" bodies are usually clothed
by these ail-American clothes. In this shot, though, they
are not wearing anything. The foreground of the picture
is flanked by the upper torsos of two mannequins
which frame the staggered ones posed in contraposto
in the background. The spotlights of the store cast
down upon these identical models, and, with the
absence of real people in the store, they look like
museum pieces.
I find that idea amusing that the Gap, of all
places, could hold pieces that look like they belong in a
museum. Presumably, museums are supposed to carry
unique artifacts, not the ail-American, omnipresent
Gap. Yet, in our delightful post-modernist context, the
Gap plays off this possibility and the world makes
sense again. Yeah capitalism! It's really a rather
unnerving photo for the same reasons it is humorous.
Gordon captures that ambiguity with sensitivity and
humor.
The other shot that had an effect on me is the one by
Adrian Mathurin 'O2, called "levels." It is a shot of the
berries in front of Kohlberg, and while you can make out
the blurred stones and colored glass of the building in
the background, the berries are clearly the focus of the
photograph. On the right side of the shot are big,
succulent berries that almost pop out at you. The
berries are staggered diagonally across the picture
plane, encouraging the gaze to weave through this mass
of color and texture. It makes you realize that we so
often take for granted this fruit that provides a splash of
color all year long.
Mathurin explores the plumpness of the berries and
their texture, which is, at a closer look, not simply
perfectly round. He looks at the bark-colored mottled
stems. He discovers the lushness of a fruit that, in the
photo, is like a stop sign, almost, as the bright red
blocks the building that consumes so much of our
attention here. In the photo, though, Mathurin's lens
strokes the fruit, which pleads to be noticed and

These two photos are as different from each other
as they are from the rest of the photos in the show. All
of these, though, explore some sort of detail, some sort
of truth, which their artists encourage you to do as

kind ofdetails, VHI depth with a BillO'Reilly edge. I wanted
to dig into the grit that made Ellipsis Ellipsis. They were
more than willing to help.
Ellipsis was conceived when lead guitarist Matt Murphy
'Ol saw his roommate's band Heavy Mo' Blue Daddy perform in his freshman spring. Inspired, he and friend Price
decided to start their own band. Both were experienced
tenors and musicians. Murphy had been playing guitar for
two years, while Price had been trained as a classical violinist, picking up the mandolin for the band. Price found
Jokisch, who provides guitar, piano and vocals, in
Mixed Company. Her sweet, lowdown voice pumps
extra soul into Ellipsis' music.
They first agreed on the genre: they would
do worklike that of pop/alternative rock

and Dave Matthews Band, covering
some of these bands' songs at first,

ter," too depressing for their taste.
"We write a lot of depressing songs," said Murphy, "but
sometimes you can connect easier with negative emotion
than positive emotion." Rather than seeing this as feeding
audience depression, Murphy sees expressions of pain and
grief as reaching out to listeners in a way bubble-gum pop
tunes don't.
The first time I saw Ellipsis perform was when they
opened for Dar Williams at last spring's aptly named largescale event. Williams signed the band's tickets and
complimented them on their songs, after listening from
below. Since then, the band has been invited to play at area
colleges, such as at Haverford's yearly music fair,
Haverfest, and in Philadelphia venues. Their first CD, recorded over 90 hours in five days in Olde Club, yielded substantial profit, allowing the band to purchase new equipment for future shows. They will soon record their second
CD in LPAC, once again with the support of LPAC sound
expert Nick Kourtides.

After graduation, all of the band's members plan to remain in the Philadelphia area. While Price has been teaching all year, Jokisch and Murphy are searching for local
work in law and computer science, respectively. "Jobs are
number one," said Murphy, "but the band is the immediate number two."
Could Ellipsis turn into a huge success? Will their ideals be ruined in the world ofrecord mega-corporations and
concessions to big-time labels? Will their soul be corrupted
by money and fame? Will they abandon their music to start
a family or serve immediate needs? Murphy declines to
comment on the future of Ellipsis, simply saying, "We'll
see where it leads us."
The last Ellipsis concert will be in the Mephistos lounge
this Friday at 8 p.m. The band hopes you'll sing along and
wish them luck on their way.

would write the melody, harmony and
\
lyrics of a song and then bring it to the
group; the others would thenwrite parts for
their own instruments.
According to Murphy, songwriting is a long
process. "Sometimes you pass something and get
a glimmer of an idea for a song," he said. "I have
envelopes and napkins covered in writing.
Maybe you wake up the next day and it's meaningless. Or maybe five weeks later, you come
back to it and create something."
The trio agreed not to veto each other's work.
Instead, each memberrevises their own songs,
and once done, the band agrees to take therisk.
The latest risk has been Price's new song,

"Tarantelle," which demands dissonant mandolin chords, straying from Ellipsis' usual
pop aesthetic. The band has also received
critiques from some Swarthmore fans who
find certain songs, like "Tale of a Daugh-

MOVIE

Love's a bitch
and then you die
The emotion-heavy 'Amores Perros' examines
betrayals and other moral sacrifices made for love
BY ESTER BLOOM
Love onscreen is not exactly uncommon. Movies present it in all its varied forms: healthy, obsessive, forbidden, unexpected, sappy, badly written,
funny, asinine. There are a decent number offilms
about dogs, too ("Oliver and Company," "Benji,"
"Old Yeller," off the top of my head.) But there aren't
too many films out there that combine the two
themes. And "Amores Perros" is no "Lady and the
Tramp."
"Amores Perros" (literally translated as Love's a
Bitch) begins Tarantino-style. Two boys in one car

are fleeing another car filled with more boys: the
second group is aggressive, reckless, and armed. In
the backseat of the first car is a wounded dog.
Everyone's shouting at once and, with the roar of
the traffic, very little is audible... until a crash cuts
off the noise like a switch. Then the movie starts

for real.
The movie is divided into three sections, the first
and strongest of which is Octavio y Susanna. It tells
the story of a teenager named Susanna (Vanessa
Bauche) who is married to Ramiro (Marco Perez.)
She is living with him, their child, Ramiro's mother,
and Ramiro's brother Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal).
Ramiro has a bad job and a short temper, a nasty
combination: add to that the pressure of being the
father of an infant and he becomes someone you

would avoid at all costs.
To Octavio's building frustration, Susanna
doesn't have that option, and finally Octavio decides
to save her. He and she have been making eyes at
each other since frame one it makes sense that they
run off together. He is more considerate than his
brother, better looking and less of a bastard. The
only problem is money. Serendipitously, a solution
arrives at his doorstep. His dog, Cofi, has killed another dog in self-defense. The other dog, now-dead,
had been a prize fighter, which clearly demonstrates
Cofi's champ potential.
Octavio takes his dog to the ring, confident that
Cofi can win enough to get he and Susanna settled
for life. The second story, Daniel y Valeria, follows
Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero,) an advertising exec who
has left his family to live with Valeria (beautifulbut-unfortunately-named Goya Toledo), a leggy perfume model. Unsentimentally, the film focuses on
the joy of the new couple instead of dwelling on the

abandoned wife and two children. A car crash from
the first story sends Valeria into the hospital.
This is one of a few small, believable connections
between sections that keep the stories tangential to
each other. Valeria returns to the new apartment
Daniel has bought her to recover with her scruffy
white dog; only, in a Poe-like twist, the dog, her company during the long days, disappears through a hole
in the floorboards. That same crash implicates El
Chivo (grave, soulful Emilio Echevarrla), a homeless
man with a dirty Santa Claus beard and a pack of
loyal dogs, in the third story, El Chivo y Maru.
He too had been a family man, but he abandoned
society in order to fully embrace his new political
views. Guerilla warfare landed him in jail, and jail
cost him his sanity: Ever since, he has been living
on the street, caring for strays and rummaging

through trash.

Each story is lengthy and substantial enough to
stand on its own. Packed together, they make for an
interesting, though at times lugubrious, saga of life
in Mexico. The characters come from different so-

cial classes and, accordingly, have different problems,
but a few constants tie the three sections together.
For instance, in each, people have true, enduring affections for their pets.
Sometimes exclusively. Incidentally, there are
some vivid, gruesome scenes of animal violence in
this film. A disclaimer at the beginning assures the
audience that no dogs were actually hurt. This is
just an additional warning to the squeamish: come

equipped with something a hand, a sweater
squeeze. First-time director Alejandro Gonzalez
Inarritu in no way tries to glorify the life he's recreating on screen. When people (or dogs) are bloody
and grotesque, they actually look bloody and
grotesque;there is nothing romantic about their injuries. In parallel fashion, no one's mistakes are
glossed over.
When people (or dogs) are cruel, they have to deal
with the repercussions.
And people are cruel.
The title is not profane, nor a double entendre,
for nothing. "Amores Perros" is a dark film about
the choices we make and the things we do, whether
right or wrong, for love. At two and a half hours, it's
a serious time, as well as emotional, investment, but
for the quality of the acting, and whatever subtle lessons you might learn, it's worth it.

Based on the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo (who cowrote the screenplay with
director Francis Ford Coppola), "The Godfather" is an epic tale of Mafia life in America
during the 1940s and 'sos. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the family patriarch balancing a love of his family with an ambitious criminal instinct.
At the wedding ofthe don's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), youngest son Michael (Al
Pacino), a decorated war veteran, is reunited with his family. After an assassination
attempt leaves the Godfather too ill to run the family business, sons Michael and Sonny
(James Caan), with the help ofconsigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), lead the Corleones
into a vendetta-filled war with the other mob families. Violent revenge ensues as the
family tries to change from its old criminal ways into legitimacy. Diane Keaton, in a
stark departure from her usual comedic roles, plays Kay, the long-suffering
wife ofMichael Corleone. Brilliant casting, music, and storytelling help make
"The Godfather" a classic that you won't want to miss. Liven your Friday or
Saturday night with a little Mafia fun. The much-referenced movie plays at

Co-President

Financial Policy Representative

Ryan Budish 'O4

David Ellis 02
I'm running for Financial Policy Representative because I
have an agenda. I want to make Swarthmore more open, fair
and fun. As an economics major, I have the interest, motivation, experience and knowledge to effectively serve your interests and make sure you're heard in the sketchy, closed-door
elitism of the budget committee. As a member of council I will
fight for a number of initiatives. First, I promise free copies of
The New York Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer and USA Today for all. Bryn Mawr has a future readership program that
freely distributes all these newspapers Swarthmore does not.

Swarthmore campus life does not have to be an oxymoron.
I feel there are many ways that I can improve student life on
this campus; here are four of them.
1. Campus safety is my top priority. Expense or unsightliness should be no excuse for failing to do everything within
our power to protect the students of this campus. We need
more call boxes, swipe card entry and a stronger campus safety
presence.
2. Let's develop a long-term plan for developing a REAL
student center. Let's start by installing TVs, VCRs, and vending machines.
3. Let's give the 20-meal plan the flexibility of the 14-meal

plan.
4. Let's keep the fieldhouse open late, and if we do it in
conjunction with the ville we can provide a type of midnight

Serving briefly as secretary of Student Council last
spring, I took the opportunity this fall to closely observe
:he council from my exchange semester at the WilliamsVlystic Program, staying in close contact with its members
and keeping up with campus issues. As co-president of Stuient Council, I can offer my combined leadership experience with Student Council as well as with campus groups
including WSRN, Swarthmore Business Association and
eXcess.
While the co-president is responsible for sizeable adninistrative duties, there is clearly room for platform and
urogram initiative. Foremost on my agenda for the fall is
ensuring that council follows through with the recent safety
iwareness and security improvement initiatives. As a comjonent of safety improvement, I would like to facilitate a
oint cooperative effort between Garnet Patrol, Safewalk,
shuttle Service and Public Safety to further promote their
lommon safety goals. In addition to these safety goals, I
vill work with the administration to develop a long-term
)lan to set aside physical and financial resources for an
ill-campus space designed with the students interests in
nind (read: an actual student center).

.auren Tobias 'O2
Having served as Student Council's CampusLife Represenative for the past semester, I have a well-informed perspective
>f how this campus works, familiarity with the administraion and knowledge of how to get things accomplished.

My role on the council this semester has been an active
me, involving such ongoing projects as improving food qualty at Tarble and Sharpies, meeting with Information Techlology Services to increase the number of public computers on campus and in dorms, and extending the hours at the
Music Building. Currently, I am working to help proluce a plastic discount card with savings at ville businesses

;erved as a student representative on the search committee
or the new Student Activities Coordinator. Next weekend,
he council will sponsor a campus-wide movie night on
3arrish Beach which
I initiated and organized.
Other qualifications include my experience on Student
iudget Committee and with student groups as coordinator of
he Photography Club andfounder of the Premedical Society.
Please allow me the opportunity to continue the work I
lave begun while on the council this semester. I bring an
enthusiastic, creative, hardworking and experienced per•pective to the position of Co-President.

Student Groups Adviser
effrey Regier 'O3
I currently serve on the Student Budget Committee, the
College Democrats, the Computer Service Committee, the
'rum Woods Monitoring Committee and theForum for Free
Speech. I have demonstrated devotion to school service and
vish to continue this work as Student Groups Advisor.
I will reform the chartering process, such that it is no
anger just another obstacle to forming a student group.
Charters should be minimal, yet sufficient to reminding
uture group leaders of .their group's mission. Charters
nust also be made accessible: I pledge that within one week
if being elected, every group's charter will be posted onine. Together we can redefine charters at Swarthmore!
Budgeting also needs to be reformed. Small student
roups can rarely provide detailed justification for expected
xpenses a year after spring budgeting, and thus are conistently under-funded. I will end the practice of subjecttig small groups to the same budgeting process as groups
eceiving nearly one thousand times their budget. Small
roups will be given the option of bypassing spring budeting and the Student Budget Committee altogether, by
eing given access to a newly created forum specializing
i their funding.
I would be honored to have your vote.

Campus Life Representative

I can work hard to do all of these things because I already
have a year's experience on the Dean's Advisory Council working on similar student life issues. I also have the leadership
skills as president of the College Democrats.

Get more out of Swarthmore. Ryan Budish for SC.

Randy Keim 'O2
When I visited Swarthmore College as a senior in high
school, my main concern was about campus life. I was positive that it was an academic center, but I wasn't sure whether
the campus would provide me with some escape from my work
and offer a fun and safe atmosphere.
Therefore, when I heard about the opening for Campus
Life Representative, I knew I had to apply for the position.
What better way to serve the campus than to make sure that
everyone gets the most out of their life here at Swarthmore?
Whether it's getting the tower open during the week or looking to have more beach activities, I hope to do all the little
things to make your time here more enjoyable and comfortable. Besides this, I enjoy the challenge of being on Student
Council and seeing that they do what is in the best interest
of all students.
There is a lot of room for change at Swarthmore. All we
need is to voice our concerns and wishes and take some steps
towards improvement. Why not start by voicing your feelings
through me as your Campus Life Representative? Change and
a better life on campus can start now.

Christine Shin 'O4

Why? Because Student Council has been too lazy in the past. I
promise change. Second, I will fight for additional campus lighting and safety phones that should have been constructed yesterday. Third, I will press for a revival of campus traditions
like Crum bonfires that, through sheer laziness, we have forgotten about. Fourth, I will strive to create a better support
network for those thinking of pursuing a career related to business, and create a concentration in strategic thinking. Fifth, I
will fight for wind energy. Sixth, I will further seek to bring
more big-name speakers and bands to campus.

Wayne Cabradilla 'O2
To convince the voting public of their absolute dedication, oftentimes candidates for Student Council in the past
have tickled the imaginations of the student body with fanciful visions of perks paid for by some infinite endowment.
Sadly, though, these visions are sometimes unrealistic. I
realize that the college is in the process of three major capital projects (the new science center, renovation of Parrish,
and the construction of a new dorm). On the other hand, I
think that I have some ideas that are not only sensible financially, but would also greatly improve life here at Swat.
One is safety. This past semester has seen an increase
in crime, something I think the community is unused to. I
have been shocked at the resistance by the administration
to some simple improvements, like more lighting or more
shuttles, which could go a long way in alleviating students'
concern about walking home alone late at night.
Another is in regard to study abroad. The requirement
that students pay Swarthmore tuitionfor study abroad programs that are often much cheaper, even with factoring in
financial aid, is ludicrous.
I have some other ideas. If you're interested, please email me or check out http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/
~cabrad/scplatform.html

In the past year, student satisfaction has decreased, and
disgruntled Swatties are now a formidable group. As Campus
Life Representative, I will dedicate myself to the achievement
of two goals: fun and satisfaction. I will work to increase communication with the ville to accommodate student needs, improve the quality/selection of food at Tarble, and add more
on-campus computers. Other goals include more parking
spaces (with long-term solutions, such as a garage), improvement of student safety, more parties and party alternatives,
extended hours for the library, 24-hour access to computers/
printers/photocopy machines, more student spaces, alternative meal plans, restrictions on reserved-students e-mail, increased summer storage and more communication among
existing student groups.
I am currently a member of the WRC and SAO boards, serving as treasurer and secretary, respectively. Through the planning of several large-scale event I have gained a greater understanding of how student activities function and work to-

I am running for Campus Life Representative and I believe
that I have enough experience to serve my fellow students
well in this capacity. In high school, I was the president, leader,
and founder of several campus groups, including one that had
the largest membership in the school. In college, I have participated in a variety of activities, such as SASS Executive
Board, SCF, Drama and Psalters. Finally, I'm a trained peer
mediator, qualified to facilitate and participate in discussion.
I believe that all of these groups have provided me with different perspectives in terms of activities and a genuine respect for all of them. Moreover, I often needed to work with
the administration in charge to ensure that it met the needs
of these groups. I am committed to whatever it is that I am
doing, and determined to see it succeed. As a member of student council, one of my goals is to improve security for stu-

student. As such, I speak to myself as well as all of the campus
when I say that I will be dedicated to the position of Campus
Life Representative. I assure you that I will not let you down.

Anna Morgan 'O4

I would like to be elected Student Council's Educational
Policy Representative because I feel it would enable me to
have a positive impact on the student body at Swarthmore.

I also am qualified for this position. I have become involved
with the Diversity Taskforce and the Multicultural Dean
Search Committee, which has given me useful experience
working with faculty and staff. I am a member of ADVICE,
which has helped me understand student issues. In addition, I started a Young Friends Quaker group which meets
weekly, and I hope to encourage the administration to mind
the ideas of Quakerism the college has historically held.
If elected, I wouldlike to work on developing class evaluations that students in all courses would complete. These evaluations would be given to the professor and department chair,
and they would be stored in the libraries for other students to
read before choosing classes. I also hope to reevaluate the
PDCs and provide wider and more substantial opportunities
for students. In addition, I want to improve the advising system by training professors to better understand classes outside their department. I am happy to hear any of your comments, so please contact me at x2700 or amorganL
PDCs need to go. In talking with fellow Swatties, I have
heard the same complaint over and over again: mandatory
distribution requirements are an insult to our maturity.
We were admitted to Swarthmore because we've demonstrated an interest in challenging ourselves, and we will
choose to take courses outside of our specialties. But we
should have the choice. Why must our efforts to expand
our academic repertoire be proscribed?
The hiring of visiting professors needs to be reformed.
While many of the visiting professors do their job well, a
school with a commitment to teaching excellence need not
hire directly from graduate schools. We should be hiring
professors that have some experience and should reduce
our reliance on visiting professors.
While I have much organizational experience, I will not
promise to have solved these problems by the end of my
tenure as Educational Policy Representative. I do promise
to work to facilitate change, to listen to my fellow Swatties,
and to represent you to the best of my ability. With more
scholastic choices and more experienced professors, we will
have a better academic life. Please vote Mike Morse for
Educational Policy Representative.

Re: Inquiry about a position in Equities
Dear Mr. Goldman and Mr. Sachs:

About two years ago, I read in a penetrating in-depth article in Details magazine that investment
bankers lead lonely lives. They are forced to work so many hard hours. Yet, with mounds of cash
earned from keeping the grand American schema of capitalism afloat, they are able to afford young,
lithe prostitutes to keep them company in times of desolation and despair. Mr. Goldman. Mr. Sachs.
I am a lonely, but intensely poetic, man. Standing on the balcony of a high-rise penthouse all coked
up, watching the limelights flicker across the teeming metropolis while waiting for a seventeenyear-old whore named Mimi... It is this image of myself that I have now, as I write to inquire about
a position in the Equities Division of GoldmanSachs & Co.
I currently attend a small liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. It is a strange place, where girls
run for student council and Toni Morrison is considered literature. Here, I have been brainwashed
into thinking that women were attracted to English and philosophy majors. I realize only now, of
course, that these people are mostly useless to society. Only one out of several thousand of these
humanities majors will actually publish a ‘Great American Novel’ or create a work of ‘systematic
genius,’ and only a fraction of those privileged few will get to datefashion models of Giselian caliber.
So in the end, I decided that it would be much easier (and more practical!) to major in value-free
economics, put in my seventy hours a week, and vote Republican to ensure myself a lifetime of
decadent sexual fulfillment.
At this point, you might be asking yourself: why should I hire this man when there are candidates
much like himself from Harvard, Yale and Williams
institutions unafraid to enrich their students
with robust football programs? There are several reasons, almost too many to list, but I shall try
anyway, since I am considered by many, and consider myself to be, a man whose action is fueled by
his indomitable spirit.
First of all, I have excellent quantitative skills. I have taken calculus not once, not twice, but three
times. (What is the derivative ofx squared? I dare you to ask me in our interview.) I have always been
good with numbers. I am often the first to figure out how much tip we should leave the waiter when
the bill at the restaurant comes out to be some funny amount. While I may not be first to say what the
tip should be, I almost always find myself on the verge of thinking it, just when somebody else says it out loud.
Secondly, I have great people skills. I have a theory that there are two types of people in this world: people that like you and people that don’t. The theory dictates that as long as there are
more people that like you than there are that don’t, you are in good shape, since even if the latter party chooses to engage you in a war of any sort (fight to the death, a vindictive game of laser
tag), you will always have more people to be on your side.
I am almost positive that there are more people that like me than there are that do no not. As evidence to this, I can proudly attest that I have not been punched in the nose since last Christmas,
and even that was due to a sordid misunderstanding. (My cousin Tommy thought I was hitting on his girlfriend, when in fact, I was just showing her how comfortable my bed was.)
Thirdly, I am also a quick learner. Every once in awhile, when we play hearts, I find that I have forgotten all the rules. But when the other players start explaining themto me again, I put
up my palm and say, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember now,” and I can see that they cannot help but marvel at how quickly it all returns to me.
Fourthly and lastly, I am a wonderful decision-maker. In fact, when I began writing this cover letter in Microsoft Word, I typed “Dear Mr. Goldman and Mr. Sachs:” and the little paper
clip man at the corner ofmy screen said to me, “It looks like you are writing a letter. Would you like help?” I had to either get help with writing the letter or just type the letter without help.
Let me assure you that I moved quickly and confidently to my choice: the second one to write the letter without any help which, I realize now, is simultaneously a testament to my
fearless independence.
Mr. Goldman. Mr. Sachs. I am prepared for the demanding rigor of investment banking, having already worked so hard even in my short life. There have been moments when, pushed
to my limits by the searing vulgarity of the coffee bar where I currently work, I honestly did not mean it when I said to certain customers, “Take care now.” What I was hoping, in fact, was
that the mocha latte I just sold would be a little too hot, but at the same time, very tasty, and the customer would be struck with the dilemma of whether to wait a little and let the latte cool,
or just start drinking right away.
I confess that I knew, however, that I was a masterful maker of mocha lattes, and the intense flavor that I gave my lattes would make it virtually impossible for customers to wait another
second before drinking them. I am ashamed to say that I took pleasure in knowing, in the darkest corner of my heart, that the customer would drink the latte right away, regardless of how
hot it was, and end up burning his tongue.
I realize at this point that I might have come off a little too serious to you, and for that I apologize. The truth, though it may surprise you, is that I am not a man without humor. I make
it a point to laugh at least three times a day. To ensure this daily dosage, I even like to visit the children’s playground in the city. After finding a good seat on the bench, I search for that one
kid who’s too fat to be playing on the jungle gym. There is always one, I assure you. He is so bold, and so blind to his own muscular ineptitude. He fights his mother’s pleas to sit quietly in
the sandbox and shifts his malleable girth towards the towering ladders of the jungle gym. His fall is inevitable, giving off that surprisingly (and hilariously!) dull, lifeless thud.
I think it’s always funny to watch little kids fall down, since they don’t realize what has happened to them for a good two seconds. Are we to attribute their retarded reaction to
inexperience of pain, or to basic, overall stupidity? The answer seems clear to me. We know that children have already been attuned to pain, via circumcision or eating peas. Then it must
be that they are just stupid. Watching them stumbling through the comedy of their existence, I find it hard to believe that I used to be one of them.
The point of my saying all this is, I’m sure you have already gathered, to show you what a delightful co-worker I will make at your company. When you are considering my resume, I hope
you will appreciate the graphic illustrations of my past work experiences, which will, I trust’, set me apart from the other applicants. If you have any more questions, please visit <http://ellemacpherson.tripod.com>, my humble tribute website. When you scroll down to the bottom past all the thumbnails, you will discover a link to my biography as well as to the collection of

DEPTHI

BACK TO THE DRAWINCj BOARD
From ART HISTORY, pg. 13
Lee said, "I was really alarmed because I've always been
really familiar with departments based on the professors.
Departments are the professors, so all the courses that I wanted
to take... well, I had to reconsider because I didn't know who
would be teaching them." Specifically, Lee was upset about
the departure of Graybill, whom she said is a "great" professor
in an area critical to the art department. "The Asian art
offerings will be severely limited," said Lee, who was planning
to work with Graybill.
Gruber thinks that because of the changes, students
probably thought twice about majoring in the department.
Dan Blim 'O2, a double major in art history and music,
said the changes in the department had made him concerned
about completing his art history requirements before theend
of his senior year. "I was worried not only that completing
the major could be more hectic than I was prepared to deal
with, but that the difficulties might dissuade others from the
department, which I find thoroughly engaging and wonderful
in every sense," he said.
Now that two professors have been hired, Blim feels better
about his senior year. "I'm more or less happy with how it all
turned out, though it's sad to see so many great professors
leave at once," he said.
Nevertheless, students seemed satisfied with the way the
art department handled the process of hiring replacements.
"I'm very pleased with the attentiveness to the problem and
quick action," Blim said. "The first thing that happened was
[Cothren] scheduled a lunchtime meeting with us to explain
things and let us ask questions. He made it clear that he wanted
the students involved in the decisions and encouraged input
for each of the candidates," he said.
A committee of students was chosen to help with the
process of interviewing finalists. After attending a morning
lecture aimed at undergraduates, the students had lunch with
of the candidates. "[We asked them] general questions
about how they viewed the honors program, what they
thought about seminar teaching, that sort of thing" Wolfram
said. In the afternoon, thestudents attended a longer, scholarly
lecture given by each candidate.
At the end of the process, the students gave feedback to
Cothren. The four renaissance/baroque candidates she met
impressed Wolfram. "They were really strong candidates. It
must have been a really difficult choice for the department,"
she said.

"What was really interesting to me was that there was no

great discrepancy between student and faculty reactions to
:he candidates," Cothren said. While there was not total
consensus, he felt that everyone clearly saw the strengths and

weaknesses ofall the candidates.

THE ROLE OF STUDIO ART

The studio art faculty also played a vital role in the hiring
process. In academia, it is not unusual to find studio art and
irt history within the same department, but "joint
departments are often characterized by a lot of stress and
tension," Cothren said. The Swarthmore art department is
unusual in that the two disciplines get along so well, according
to Cothren. "We believe thatthe best thing to do is to integrate
;hese two disciplines in liberal arts study of the visual arts,"
he said.
Meunier added, "From the viewpoint ofbeing a practicing
itudio artist, I think it's important for the studio artist to be
cognizant of the entire tradition they're working in...
Especially within a liberal arts context."
Both Cothren and Meunier said that an important part of
:he selection process involved trying to determine whether a

candidate would fit harmoniously into this special relationship
between studio art and art history.
"We were very concerned that these art historians have the
ability to in interact well with studio artists, because we are an
integrated department," Meunier said. "My decision, personally,
to hire these two individuals had to do with my recognition that
they understood what the process of making art is about."
Besides interviewing each candidate, the studio art professors
brought the candidates into their teaching studios and asked them
to comment on the students' work. Meunier said he was
"impressed by the comments [of Mileaf and Reilly] regarding
specific works [by students]." From taking them around the
studios, he "realized that they would have a good dialogue with
the studio artists," he said.
Meunier said he quickly realized that Mileaf and Reilly, who
both have a background in studio art, possessed a sensitivity to
the creation of art. Janine Mileaf deals with French dada and
surrealism. One hallmark of the beginning of surrealism was
[the artists'] use of found objects in their work," Meunier said.
"[Mileaf] immediately picked up on my use of [found objects] in
I come right out of that tradition so there was a
my work
nice dialogue there."
Meunier added that Reilly "immediately impressed" him for
similar reasons. "When she came into the studios, shecommented
on [students'] painting, sculpture, and photography," he said. "She
had no bias or difficulty in addressing any of those media."
The interviews between the candidates and studio faculty
were also important in determining the candidates' sensitivity
to studio art. "Artists don't approach their own work like an art
"

historian would
from a certain academic distance and
objectivity," Meunier said. "It's very subjective
There's a
certain nuts-and-bolts attitude about making art that studio
artists discuss more than art historians would. "We just wanted
to see if [the candidates] were aware of that."
...

FINDING A REPLACEMENT FOR KITAO
Filling Kitao's position posed a unique challenge to the
department. She brought a rich variety ofinterests to her teaching
and will leave behind many courses that no one else in the
department will be able to teach.Besides being the first to teach
film studies at Swarthmore, she has also taught architectural
history and theory, modern architecture, semiotics, and material

r
culture.

To begin filling the substantial gap Kitao will leave behind,
the department looked for someone with broad interests to
take her place. "We sought someone who could teach this core
European tradition but also something
of 16th-and
different and someone who would key into interdisciplinary
work throughout the college" he said. "We were very sensitive
to the way this position was going to fit into college as a whole."
Cothren seemed confidentthat Reilly, Kitao's replacement,
would continue to develop her diverse interests in the same
vein as her predecessor. Reilly has expressed a strong interest
in the interpretation theory concentration. Her Ph.D. in
rhetoric "to us, seems very Swarthmore," Cothren said, and
proof that she is open to interdisciplinary work.
Meunier has talked to both Mileaf and Reilly about doing
interdisciplinary work with some of the studio art classes. "I
already asked Reilly if she might be interested in coming to
my figure modeling class and give a lecture on Roman
portraiture, and she said she would love to do that."
In addition, Meunier has asked Mileaf to give a lecture in
his photography class. "One of her lectures is about nudity in
photography from a feminist perspective. I would love for her
to come in while our class is dealing with that issue," he said.
Meunier said he would also consider offering a course in
photography team-taught by himself and Mileaf.
Both professors will teach full course loads next semester.
"They will be in discussion with me over the next few weeks
determining exactly what it is they will be teaching," Cothren
said. Some of the courses they teach will be ones already

which will be offered next fall, although Mileafhas not yet
decided on the topic.
Although some courses previously taught by Kitao will
no longer be offered, Mileafand Reilly will create new courses
as well. Reilly will offer a seminar next spring focusing on
Rome as an art center in the 15th, 16thand 17thcenturies. She
is interested in teaching courses on ancient Greek art, as well
as on the history of print in Western Culture and the notion
of reproducibility and replication. Her interest in the
relationship between art and science during the Italian

First baseman Stephanie Cross and second baseman Deidre Downey take cuts against the Haverford 'Fords in a doubleheader victory on Tuesday.

Softball slams 'Fords to finish season 5-20

VanSciver controls the mound in 6-1 victory, earns Centennial Conference Weekly Honor Roll accolades
BY LINDSAY VANSCIVER
For once, everything was perfect for Swarthmore softball, except maybe the weather. In a bittersweet surrender
of their season, the Lady Garnet took the field one last time
to capture their first doubleheader sweep in their last two
games of the year against Haverford on Tuesday, April 24.
The Fords took the offensive advantage early in the first
game, batting in three runs against Swarthmore's lone run.
Swat did not give in, however, and proved it in the bottom
of the seventh with a game-winning three-run rally started
off a single from Emma Benn 'O4. Following Benn home
came Heather Marandola 'Ol and Stephanie Wotjkowski 'O2
off a clutch RBI single from Gretchen Heitz 'O4. "We played
like a team with a lot ofheart never giving up. And that's
basically what we've been all season. A lot of heart," saod
first-baseman Maureen Vernon 'OL
The Tide showed no mercy in the second game, allow-

ing only one Ford to cross home plate. Lindsay VanSciver
'O3 pitched a solid three-hitter and was backed by iron-clad

defense that left no holes in the field. Pam Lavallee 'O3
claimed, "we've always been solid and confident in the field.
We communicate well, encourage each other, and just don't
make the mistakes that we were earlier in the season. This
alone shows how far we've come since then." This time Swat
took control at the plate, scoring six runs led by Stephanie
Cross 'O4, who finished the game 2-3 with two RBIs. Heitz
kept her bat hot from the first game, adding two runs and an
RBI to the effort.
The Lady Tide battled Muhlenberg Monday, April 23, the
second game of a match postponed earlier this season. Eager
to avenge an earlier 12-inning loss to the Mules, Swat softball
just could not find their niche at the plate. The Lady Garnet
finished their seven-inning struggle with their second Mule
defeat of the year, losing 8-0.
Swat softball traveled to Franklin and Marshall on Satur-

21 to split a doubleheader win, winning 3-1 and
losing 5-0. VanSciver controlled the mound both games as
the Lady Tide pounced on the Diplomats early in the first
game to set a rhythm that could not be upset. Again, Swat's
consistently solid defense, supportedby an unexpected offensive rally, proved their competitive edge in the conference. However, the Lady Garnets could not recover their
hot bats from the first contest for the second game. While
their record stands at a final 5-20 overall and 5-11 in the
day, April

Centennial Conference, no statistics can showhow far these
ladies have come to stake their claim as a competitive team.
"Our level of play is right up there with the best teams in
the conference. We just need everyone to be on each game
instead of a few one game and a few another. I'm really
impressed with how far we've come and how much potential we have. We will miss our seniors, though. They were
the backbone of many crucial games," concluded Kate
O'Donnell 'O3.

More to women's rugby than nudity
BY ANNA MASILELA
The ruggers line up in front of the employee swiping cards in Sharpies, ice bags
in hand. One has a pulled ligament, another a sprained ankle. "What are you doing this weekend?" "We're playing Navy."
Navy? There are men with legions of
soldiers at their disposal who are afraid of
the Navy. But that does not stop the
Swarthmore women's rugby team, who
step out to tackle anyone who comes their
way. "When you're out on the field, and
you're tired or not motivated and then you
see your friend get clocked, tht's motivation right there," said Nancy Craig 'Ol, forward captain, summing up the attitude
that even rugby neophytes have. "You're
fighting for your friends as much as you
are for yourself."
The funny thing is that not one of these
Division I players ever played rugby before arriving at Swarthmore. They were
not donning miniature rugby shirts at age
three, nor scrumming for the first time at
age seven. Perhaps they had worn the uni-

forms of other sports before, but then again,
perhaps not. "People come from all sorts of
places," said Julie George 'O2. "Some had
played

sports, some just

For Aja PetersMason 'O4, it was all
about a comfortable

to start playing volleyball while at
Swarthmore but de-

cided against it: "I

sport." Instead, she
started asking around about rugby, for which
experience was not a requirement. "Every one
that I talked to said 'Yeah, you should come out
[for the team]' and they were all so welcoming
and willing to help." Now, at the end of the spring
season, she has found that the advantages of

Like other club
sports on campus,

women's rugby re-

quires both flexibility
and responsibility from
its players in a way not
normally found on a
varsity team. The team
has been coached by

Alan Matas for the past
eight seasons. "He's
played the game, so he
has a good head for it,"
said Peters-Mason.
"Plus, he loves us and we love him too and that
makes it that much easier." However, co-captains Craig and Emily Wilkins 'Ol retain autonomy over all decisions regarding playing
time.
In effect, Matas, as well as two alums who

also come to help out, suggest options, and
then it's up to the team to make the final
decisions about wherethose options fit into
the overall program. The decision-making,
however, extends beyond choosing among
possible plays, into the sustaining of the
very existence of the club. "If we want to
have games, or have a good social or a good
banquet, we have to put in all the work,"
said George, referring to the fact that the
Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union places
the responsibility of scheduling all games
on participating clubs. "We're doing it all

ourselves."
This is the last spring that the team
which has doubled in size in the past four
years—will practice at Dupont before moving to a new location next year. However,
there are some traditions that die hard. "In
my three seasons on the team, I have never
seen anybody run away from a person coming at them during a game, even if its their
first time out there" said George. The ice
bags melting on the legs of the ruggers are
evidence that the women's rugby team will
continue to stand its ground.

Tough finish for
men's lacrosse
BY MIKE LLOYD
The Swarthmore men's la-

crosse team dropped its last two
games of the year to fall to 3-10

overall and 0-6 in the Centennial
Conference.
On Saturday, April 21, the men
lost to Gettysburg College, currently ranked first in the nation,
18-6. Two days later, they ended
the season with a 14-4 loss to the

Mary Washington College Eagles.

The Gettysburg Bullets traveled
to Clothier Field as the No. 2 team
in Division 111 and left Swarthmore
as the soon-to-be-No. 1 team. The
Garnet went into the last game of the
Centennial Conference season with
high hopes for a strong showing
against a good team, and that is just
what they put on. With no realistic
chance at winning the game, the
Garnet played one of their best
games of the season against the Bullets.

Gettysburg defender.

Rookie netminder Steven
Isbister 'O4 started his first collegiate game in goal and ended up
with 17 amazing saves. He allowed
the high-powered Bullet offense only
a respectable 18 goals.
The Swarthmore offense showed
flashes of brilliance against the best

defense in the Centennial Conference. After going scoreless in the

first quarter, the Garnet scored two
goals in each of the last three quarters. The offense was also able to
control the pace of play for long
stretches of time in the second half,
thereby keeping pressure off the
Garnet defense. Joe DeSimone 'O4
led the team with two goals. Co-captains Blake Atkins 'O2 and Mark
Dingfield 'Ol, John Murphy 'O3 and
John Cleaver 'O4 also scored.
Last Monday, the Garnet finished
the season with a loss to Mary Washington. Everything that could go
wrong for the team did so in a seemingly even-matched game. Turnovers, penalties, bad shots and mistakes plagued the Garnet in this

sloppily played showing. The offense managed only four goals, all
coming in the first half of the game.
The defense allowed 14 goals, including three extra-man goals. Senior
goalkeeper CJ Riley made 15 saves
in his last college game. The only
standout performance was by
Atkins, who picked up 11 ground
balls, won 10 of 13 face-offs, scored a
goal and assisted on two others to
lead the Garnet.

The Garnet's three wins are a

disappointment after last year's 8-6
record and berth in the ECAC Southern Conference Finals. The team
was winless in the Centennial Conference this year, though they did
beat Ursinus, a team that enters the
conference officially next year. However, next year's team returns seven
starters and over twenty players,
and the Garnet hopes it can get back
the winning magic next year and
make the Centennial Conference

Tournament.

This year's tourney is hosted by
the top-seeded Gettysburg Bullets
and will take place this weekend.
Gettysburg takes on No. 4 Franklin
and Marshall, and the second
game features second-seeded Western Maryland versus No. 3 Washington College. The winner of the
two semifinal games play on Sunday for the Conference Champion-

ship and a berth in the Division
111 tournament.

Garnet baseball gets revenge against F&M
BY FRANK MARTINEZ
Pitching wins baseball games, pure and
simple. This week the Swarthmore baseball team produced some tremendous
pitching performances en route to winning
a pair of games over some of the top teams
in the Centennial Conference.
On Friday, April 20, the team hosted
Franklin and Marshall, a team which had
defeated Swarthmore 12-3 earlier in the
week. James Zvokel 'O4, who has been

semi-successful all season long and leads
the team in decisions, got the start. With
total command and defensive support, everything came together for Zvokel as he
went eight and one-third innings, allowing two earned runs to the conference's
fourth-place team.
The Garnet got ahead early, thanks to
back-to-back doubles by Scott Kushner 'O2
and Ryan Pannorfi 'O4 to open the first inning. In the bottom of the eighth, with a 21 edge, Swarthmore came alive for three

more runs. Pannorfi drove in Frank
Martinez 'O2 with a sacrifice fly, and then
Josh Lindsey 'Ol ripped a triple to score
Jon Konits 'O4 and Kushner. Going into the
top of the ninth, the Garnet was leading
by four runs.
Zvokel was pulled in the ninth after allowing two men to reach base with only
two outs needed for the victory. Then

intense. However,

THE SWEET
SPOT

A+: it could go
all the way

Garnet serves up key wins
to take conference title

I thought my hometown football team, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, fared pretty well in last weekend's NFL draft.
Evidently, I was wrong.
According to Mel Kiper's "expert" draft analysis, the
Bucs had a painfully average draft; they earned a C+ in
Kiper's grade report. Never mind that they filled the one
major hole that could have prevented a Super Bowl run
the left tackle position. Great analysis, Mel. Even more
laughably, Kiper thought both the Seahawksand Rams had
top-notch drafts, so he gave them the corresponding topnotch grade of ... B+. Confused? Me too. So I figured I'd
grade Kiper with the same sober, fair-minded judgment he
used to grade these teams' drafts.
Honestly, I think Kiper has the most educated, accurate
opinions ofNFL prospects. (Ofcourse, I would, too, ifI spent
365 days a year researching college athletes.) My most vivid
memory ofhis bitingly accurate intuition was his opinion
ofNebraska farm boy and outside linebacker Trev Alberts,
chosen sixth overall by the Colts in 1994. Kiper chuckled
and predicted a bust when the Colts made their selection,
and later in the draft, he argued with the Colts general
manager about the pick. Of course, Kiper was ultimately
right; Alberts now broadcasts games. However, Kiper suggested that the Colts choose Trent Dilfer instead of Alberts.
In case you've been locked in a dungeon for the last seven
years, you know that Dilfer also stinks. So, for thinking
Dilfer would be decent and for having overly dogmatic opinions about prospects, Mel Kiper earns a B in my gradebook.

VITALE IS ANNOYING. HE SAYS
BABY SO MUCH THAT I CAN
BARELY UNDERSTAND HIS
ANALYSIS.
Of course, Kiper is not the only sports analyst worthy
of scrutiny. Dick Vitale also warrants a grade for his übiquity in the college basketball world. Simply put, baby,
baby's babying babies, baby, and baby can baby babies'
babying to baby babies' babies, baby. In other words, Vitale
is annoying. He says baby so much that I can barely understand his analysis. Fortunately for him, that analysis
is good: he accurately predicted that both Arizona and
Maryland wouldreach the Final Four this year. Grade: B+.
In the world ofpro basketball analysts, Bill Walton talks
so much that he is clearly worthy of attention. Besides,
Marv Albert would be too easy to ridicule. From watching
so much of the NBA on NBC, I have a clear and accurate
view ofWalton's announcing capabilities. Basically, Walton
does not understand the game ofbasketball. He ridicules
players who are playing well and praises players who are
playing horribly. He also enjoys praising players who he
has recently criticized extensively, and vice versa. Walton
also enjoys contradicting the clear instant-replay conclusions. It's difficult to believe that he played the game for so
long. Then again, I'm not so sure Shaq understands basketball, and he's none too shabby. Grade: a merciful D-.
I've gotten in the habit of ending my columns on a positive, as opposed to bitterly sarcastic, note. In that vein, I'd
like to pay homage to ESPN pro football analyst Chris
"Boomer" Berman. Notwithstanding his excellent television presence and instantly recognizable voice, Boomer
actually knows something about football. He also coined
the classic phrase "he could go all the way," which is pro
football's version of "it's going, it's going, it's gone!" Besides, Boomer always talked about the Bucs when they were
awful. Grade: A+.

Women's tennis wins first Centennial Conference title since 1995 with a 10-0 conference record
BY KRISHNA PAO

This Saturday, April 21 women's tennis defeated Western
Maryland in a 9-0 shutout, then went on to lose 7-2 to powerhouse College of New Jersey on Monday, April 23, to finish
its regular season 10-0 in the Centennial Conference and 12-3

overall.
On Saturday, the Garnet traveled two hours to the Green
Terror courts and returned conference champions.
Swarthmore has not won the Centennial Conference title since
1995. On the singles side of play, Anjani Reddy 'O4 left the
Terror's Althea Desrosiers in the dust, winning 6-0,6-1. Reddy
finishes a perfect 10-0 at first singles for the Garnet, and 14-1
overall. Caroline Celano won at No. 2 singles, 6-0, 6-1, to finish 8-0 in conference play at the position. Elizabeth Nolte 'O3
and Captain Stacey Wagaman 'Ol stepped up to fill in some
gaps in the lineup, and won 6-0, 6-0, and 8-4 (pro set) respectively. Second doubles featured the second cameo appearance
by Krista Hollis 'Ol Hollis and Kristina Pao 'O4 beat Jamie
Connelly/Jamie Makey 8-3.
The Garnet looked to continue their 10-game winning
streak with a big win over CNJ, but to no avail. The Lions
swept all singles positions except for No. 2, where Celano beat
out Monika Jakober 6-3,6-3. The other lone Swarthmore win
came at second doubles, where Celano combined with Reddy
to pull out a tough 8-6 win. Celano/Reddy are an undefeated
9-0 at the second doubles position.
The NCAA Division 111Mid-spring rankings (both regional
and national) were released April 19. The rankings include
all matches through April 2. Nationally, Swarthmore is ranked

No. 22, and fifth in the Atlantic South region. Individual
regional rankings have Reddy third and Jennifer Pao
'Ol 21st. The doubles team of J. Pao/Laura Swerdlow 'O2
have an Atlantic South ranking of No. 13, and Celano/
Reddy have a ranking of No. 18.
The Centennial Conference Individual Championships (singles and doubles) will take place this weekend
at Franklin and Marshall College. Swarthmore will be
sending five players: J. Pao, Swerdlow, Reddy, Celano
and Kristina Pao 'O4. Reddy, Celano and K. Pao are entered in the singles draw, while the teams of J. Pao/
Swerdlow and Celano/Reddy are entered in doubles. The
tournament features a singles pool of 32, and a doubles
pool of 22. The Garnet players are expected to do well
considering their individual records within the conference.
The team awaits an invitation to the Atlantic South
regional round of the NCAA Division 111 National Tournament. Bids will be announced on May 7. The first
round consists of 26 teams competing in four regional
