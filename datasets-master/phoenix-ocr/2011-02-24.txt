SBC Manager Naomi Liang hopes to reduce shuttle inconsistencies and increase effectiveness of services through additional organizational measures, such as the Shuttle Status Guide.

running.

Recently, there have been student
complaints with the Student Budget

Committee's morning shuttle, which
goes from Parrish Circle to PPR and
Mary Lyon. Students are frustrated
because the shuttle is consistently not
on time and the schedules are not clearly posted.

"When I lived in Mary Lyon I was
frustrated by how sporadic the morning
shuttle was. There were days when the
shuttle would not show up and we didn't know anything about it," Julio
Alicea 'l3 said.
"Sometimes the morning shuttle
doesn't exist," a student from Mary
Lyon who wished to remain anonymous
said. "It would be better if there was a
place to check to see the shuttle times if
it were delayed."
The way to report and update the
morning shuttle's status is a long
process. If a driver cannot run the shuttle, he or she must e-mail other drivers
to see if someone can fill in. If another
driver cannot be found, Naomi Liang
'l2, the Student Budget Committee
(SBC) manager, updates the SBC website to say that the shuttle will not be
running or will be delayed.
"It is important that students contact
me when the shuttles aren't running so
that I can confirm this," Liang said.
However, because this process takes
time to be completed, the SBC website is
not immediately updated, meaning that

The most effective way for students
to find out if the shuttle is running is to
call Public Safety to see if the key to the
shuttle van has been picked up.
"Every morning, I receive calls

every five minutes from students to see
if the morning shuttle is running. It is
not the students' fault," said Ellie
Jamison, the communications supervisor at Public Safety.
"The students are depending on the
shuttle to transport them to campus for
class. Due to the inconsistency of the
shuttle running, students have to call
Public Safety because it is the only way
for them to see if the key has been
picked up and the shuttle is available
for that day," she said.
The evening shuttle that's run by
Public Safety has a more consistent
track record and students find it to be
more dependable. "The evening shuttle
is more reliable," the same student from
ML said.
Unlike the morning shuttle, which is
run by students, Public Safety employees drive the evening shuttle. "Although
sometimes there are delays because a
driver is out due to an emergency, the
evening shuttle very, very rarely doesn't run," second shift Sergeant
Dominick Martino said.
However, Liang and the SBC are conducting ongoing attempts to make their
shuttles more efficient and to make
their schedules more easily accessible

February 24, 2011

for students."A priority that I have is to
create a manual for drivers to know
what to do," Liang said.
In addition, Liang has created a
Shuttle Status Guide on the SBC website where students can check whether
or not a shuttle is running the day it is
scheduled. She is also considering the
possibility of a morning shuttle hotline
where the driver would leave messages
updating the status of the shuttle.
Students could then call this hotline
and hear the driver's message.
These modifications would help
streamline the process for reporting
when a driver cannot make their shift
and would bring student's attention to
this more quickly.
Similar communication issues have
affected Public Safety's Philly Shuttle,
which was requested by Student
Council in 2002. The online form
through which students sign up for the
shuttle listed different times from those
that the Public Safety personnel saw
when they logged into the administrator section of the site. Public Safety
recently discovered this problem and
are working with the college's
Information Technology Services to
correct the issue.
"We are always trying to fine tune
things
and
improve reliability,"
Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave said.
If students have any issues or opinions on the SBC shuttles, Liang
should approach

Town Center West Project finally moves forward

BY PATRICK AMMERMAN

pammerml@swarthmore.edu

The Town Center West Project, which
hopes to build a new inn, bookstore and
restaurant on Swarthmore's campus, was
approved by the Board of Managers this
past weekend. The project is to be located
on the south side of Swarthmore's cam-

pus, near the Ville.

"[This is] not just putting things down
in the Ville but it serves very much some
of the needs of our community," President
Rebecca Chopp said, who announced the
decision to go through with the project in
a thorough, 1,450 word e-mail to the student body on Monday.

According to supporters of the project,
the hotel could provide numerous benefits
for the college community, such as providing college guests with on campus lodging
which would also enable the college to
better host academic conferences creating new tax revenues for the Borough and
acting as what Chopp calls an "intellectual living room" for the campus.
The hotel has been the subject of much
controversy on campus since the idea's
conception.
"[Some are concerned] it may further
erode green space, hinder existing retail
outlets, create the possibility for public
safety and health hazards, and not be economically viable," Vice President for

Facilities and Services C. Stuart Hain said
in an article published in The Phoenix,
the Daily Gazette and the Swarthmorean
this past September.
Another major issue surrounding it
has been a proposed neutrality agreement,
designed to protect workers' rights at the
new hotel, which has not been enacted
thus far.
The school administration acknowledges that the project has many points of

contention, and has proposed several
chances for students and community
members to have their voices heard,
which will begin next week and continue
on for the rest of the semester. "Being the
kind of place that we are where we really
value civil discourse we're going to host
a couple of meetings that are going to be
open, that we can come to that borough
residents can come to where we can look
at some of the issues that people want to
be heard about," said Melanie Young, Vice
President of Human Resources.

Swarthmore borough as a dry town, with
the exception of the college having the
opportunity to purchase a liquor license
for the inn's proposed restaurant. This
would make the project more economically appealing and viable for developers.
Borough voters have also previously
passed a piece of legislation granting a
liquor license to the proposed restaurant,
as means to make the project more economically viable.
Work began in earnest after 2005 to further think the project through, but according to Hain, "it's taken us until now to

attorney for the National Labor Relations
Board, will participate in a panel discussion of issues regarding neutrality agreements.
The idea for a hotel located on
Swarthmore's campus originated from
research done by two planning groups for
the college and also the Borough. In 1999,
they published a report of their suggestions, one of which was a high-scale inn
and restaurant of about 65 rooms.
Before any planning could begin, however, the school needed an ordinance from
the town, which was finally given to the
college in 2005. In a narrow vote in 2001,
precinct voters voted to maintain

Some key

to 40-45 rooms, the dismissal of creating

residential apartments as a part of the
project, and the decision to self-develop
and not hire an outside developer.
According to Vice President for Finance
and Treasurer Suzanne Welsh, "we will
own it and arrange for it's operation."
"There are lots of decision points still
ahead," Chopp said. For example, the college still needs go through land use
processes and zoning processes with the
Swarthmore borough.
"It's not usual when you build a building on a college [for it to take this long],"
Chopp said, comparing the project to the
recent building of a library at her previ-

ous position at Colgate University.
Chopp hopes that having a hotel on
campus will help Swarthmore become
more of a leader in shaping the direction
of higher education. "People have looked
to us as a place of leadership," Chopp said.
"This will also provide us a space to
host those kind of conversations in [a]
national and international place," she
said.
Students and community members are
encouraged to participate in the dialogues
the school will be holding for the rest of
the semester, which will help to guide the
direction for future planning of the proj-

ect.
Groups such as Swarthmore Labor
Action Project (SLAP) have been unable
to make the administration take concrete
steps to address major issues in the planning of the project thus far. However,
Chopp promised in an email to hold

"numerous campus conversations about
this proposal," including such issues as
workers' rights.
"We want to make sure that since it's
on college land and built with college
money, people who are working there
have good jobs," Adam Bortner 'l2, a
SLAP leader, said. He is frustrated with
the lack of responsiveness from the
administration with regard to the wishes
of students and community leaders.
Last semester, SLAP presented to
Chopp a petition in favor of a neutrality
agreement for the future in workers
which had around 700 signatures, representing almost half the student body.
Those who are concerned about seeing
that this and other issues are addressed
fairly by those in charge of planning the
project should be sure to attend next
week's two events as well as future discussions surrounding the Town Center
West Project.

NEWS IN BRIEF

SLAP rallies for worker neutrality in Town West Project planning
Last Friday afternoon, a group of about 60 students and faculty gathered in Kohlberg courtyard.
"This is an opportunity to demonstrate the
strength of our voices as students and staff when
we stand in solidarity with workers and make it
clear that our demands cannot be silenced," read
an e-mail which made its way around the student
body on Thursday evening. The e-mail called students concerned about workers' rights, specifically
workers who will presumably work at the Town
Center West inn, restaurant and bookstore, to join
in the rally.
The protesters gathered in the courtyard, disseminating cardboard posters and one or two noisemakers to the students. A cheer went up from the
gathered students as President, Rebecca Chopp
passed the protesters and entered Kohlberg.
The protest coincided with the first of two days
of the Board of Managers meeting in Kohlberg's
Scheuer Room, a meeting which culminated in the
approval of the project that President Chopp
announced to the student body on Monday through
e-mail.
Shortly after Chopp walked by, the group began
to march around the west side of Kohlberg, reciting
chants that highlighted the need for a democratic
process in planning the Town Center West project,
as well as the need for a neutrality agreement to be
put in place to ensure that the future inn operates
under fair labor practices.
After circling twice around the Scheuer Room
side of Kohlberg, the group gathered again in
Kohlberg Courtyard where Danielle Noble 'l2
addressed the crowd.

THE PHOENIX

"[As of] right now, the Board of Managers has

not taken us seriously," Noble shouted.
She expressed to the crowd her frustration that

past meetings with Swarthmore's administrators
had thus far produced no neutrality agreement,
although the meetings have been happening on and
off for two years.
"We've been communicating directly with the
administration ... especially during this past school
year, just to make sure they put some protections
in place so that Swarthmore's commitment to
social responsibility and the Quaker heritage are
enacted and kept solid as they get in to this new
endeavor," said Adam Bortner 'l2, a SLAP leader.
Bortner is frustrated that people who have been
involved in the planning of the Town Center West
Project still have not addressed the issue of worker
neutrality since his joining of SLAP in his first
year.
The rally itself was well attended. "We just wanted to have a visible demonstration of students who
care, so that they'd hear our voice," Bortner said.
Students were enthusiastic; by some reports, the
chanting and cheering could be heard throughout
the science quad and from as far away as Willets.
"There was a lot of energy," Patrick Walsh 'l4 said.
After Monday's announcement that the Board of
Managers permitted the project, SLAP's stance did
not change. "They are still delaying any real
action," Bortner said .
SLAP's effort to get the college to commit to putting in place worker protections is still ongoing.

Admissions integrates undergrads in recruitment
BY SETH ZWEIFLER

dailypennsylvanian.com, Feb. 22, 2011

The future ofPenn admissions may depend largely
on one group
current Penn undergraduates.
At least that's what Dean of Admissions Eric
Furda believes.
Nearly three years after coming to the helm of the
Admissions Office, Furda said he is now looking for
ways to better integrate Penn students in the recruitment and outreach process for high-school appli-

cants.

"We're trying to refine and build upon how we represent the Penn experience in an authentic way,"

Furda said. "To me, undergraduates are a largely
untapped resource that might help us achieve that
goal."

Though the Admissions Office began working with
minority groups like the Lambda Alliance and the

Latino Coalition last year on various recruitment initiatives, Furda believes there's "definitely work to be
done" to get a greater number of students involved.
To help turn his vision into reality, Furda recently
led the creation of the University's first-ever
Admissions Dean's Advisory Board. Seventeen student members of ADAB met with Furda for the first
time last December.
College sophomore and ADAB member Alex
Amaniel said the group exists "to be Furda's eyes and
ears on what students think about admissions strategies." ADAB is made up of "representatives from a
diverse variety ofcultural and academic backgrounds
on campus," Amaniel added.
While ADAB does not directly make admissions
policy, student members have been working over the

past few weeks on various video projects about their
"Penn experience." When completed, Amaniel said
that the videos will be shown to prospective students.
In addition to ADAB, Furda helped oversee the formation of the Quaker Opportunity and Access Team
last semester. Quaker OATs includes representatives
from the 5B
Penn's five minority coalitions
as
well as student members of the Kite and Key Society
and representatives from the Admissions Office.
College junior and Quaker OATs chairwoman
Jewel Lester said the group serves as a way to "bring

letter-signing parties and
phone banks in an effort to
"reach out personally to

I
Furda said he also hopes
to make "flagging" applications for specific academic and personal interests a
more common practice for Penn admissions.
Currently, the Admissions Office flags applications
from members and supporters of minority groups on
campus. However, Furda hopes to extend that outreach to encompass a wider variety of academic and
social interests.
"If a student's essay is about their interest in a
field like art
then that's something we'd like to
pass along to a particular community here at Penn,"

he said.
Michael Goran, a 1976 College graduate and
founder of IvySelect College Consulting, said that
high-school applicants often show greater enthusiasm
toward a college that takes a personal interest in
them.
"When it's not a clear-cut choice, direct contact is
something that can definitely help bring a student
over to the other side," Goran said.
But for Goran, personal outreach strategies aren't
everything in college admissions. Since high-school
students today are applying
to more schools than ever

however, he admitted that
yield rates are always an
important
consideration
when implementing any new initiatives.
Penn's yield rate has hovered right around 63 percent over the past three years. This application cycle,
Furda's approach to increasing that number is one
that he describes as a "zone defense."
"I think that yield efforts start right when a student receives mailings from us, sometimes in their
sophomore year of high school," he said. "Our goal is
to provide a collective experience from many different parties

Students with ties to Egypt concerned, proud of country
BY ANH HUYNH

pittnews.com, Feb. 22, 2011

When photographs of the Egyptian
protests dominated the front pages, the

average student looked at a revolutionin-progress. Others looked for family
members who were part of the
protests.

These students who call Egypt home
or have family members in the country only grew more invested in Egypt's
affairs after the start of the revolution.
With all her relatives in Egypt, senior Sarah Moawad, president of
Students for Justice in Palestine,
began to pay closer attention to Egypt
even before the protests began in late

January.

"Interestingly, the week before Jan.
25, we were talking about the rallies in
Tunisia and wondering when it would
be Egypt's turn," she said.
Some of Moawad's family members
took part in the protests, she said,
including one of her cousins who was
shot with a rubber bullet and another
who was beaten by the police.
"I was more worried and scared
when they later sent me photos of the
injured," Moawad said.
But soon her concern gave way to
pride.

"I'm so proud to be an Egyptian. I'm

whatsoever," she said.
While Moawad speculated on the
possibility of a protest in early
January, the events took senior
Ahmed Gharib by surprise.
Gharib, who visits Egypt every year
to see family, said he thought Egyptian
people in the past seemed to support
Mubarak and his administration.
"That's why I wasn't expecting it at
all. Nobody saw it coming. No one
knew the Egyptian people had it in

Gharib tried to contribute to the
protests as much as he could by organizing rallies in

said that young people had been angry
for so long they were ready for an antigovernment movement.
Youssef Ragheb, an Arabic professor at Pitt, said there was more to the
revolution than just the protesters. He
said the Egyptian government's ignorance, the country's lack of enemies,
Egyptians' craving for democracy and
modern technologies all played a role
in ousting Mubarak from his position.
Although the protests did much for

Regardless of the damage incurred
during the protests, these students predict a bright future for Egypt and the
Middle East.
Gharib said that events in Egypt
could be the beginning of more revolutions throughout the area.
The fact that a ruthless government
like Egypt's could be toppled will
empower other Arab countries to
stand up for themselves and demand
democracy, he said, adding that the
protests in Egypt helped break the barrier of fear that has been stifling the
Arab world and made it possible for

Haverford symposium addresses disability in the arts

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY HENRY KIETZMAN

hkietzmanl@swarthmore.edu

Typically, identity is defined as race, ethnicity,
nationality, class and gender. However, many forget
to recognize disability as an identity category.
Relatively new, the interdisciplinary field of disability studies attempts to establish disability as an identity through destigmatization, as well as by challenging the notion that disability is defined solely by
medical rehabilitation.
Disability studies explore the factors defining disability as a social and cultural construct, and also
attempt to discover more about its social role
through critical response and dialogue. Haverford
College will host a dialogue this Friday afternoon at
2 p.m. in the Stokes Auditorium as part of the
In/Visible Symposium, which is an opportunity for
prominent professors of disability studies to discuss
their experiences of and opinions on disabilities and
the arts.
Both Debora Sherman and Kristen Lindgren of
Haverford's English department and writing program organized the event. In the past 10 years, the
two professors have organized three symposiums
concerning disability studies with the hopes of
bringing awareness to the larger college community.
"None of these colleges have courses or curriculums in disability studies. We bring in scholars and
artists and practitioners and advocates to demonstrate that there is a scholarly field as well as [an]
artistic practice. This one in particular focuses on
the arts," Sherman said. The speakers chosen are
quite prominent in the field. "We wanted to bring
together scholars, artists and curators so that we had
the point of view of art practice, of art criticism, and
also curatorial practice," Lindgren said. "The conversation will span those three areas."
The symposium will begin with each panelist giving about a half an hour presentation of their own
works before leading into open discussion about disability and the arts between the panelists and the
audience. The panelists include authors Tobin
Siebers and Georgina Kleege, artist Katherine
Sherwood and co-curators Ann Fox and Jessica
Cooley.
Access is one of the critical issues Lindgren and
Sherman hope to address. "Access to the art itself
and access to gallery spaces and museum spaces,"
Lindgren said. "Access even to the surface of the
painting, at what point do you represent bodies that
are not ideal? To what extent does that interrogate
and contest our notions of what one should look
like?" Sherman said in light of accessibility to artwork.
Another significant component of disability studies is analyzing one's own reaction when difference
is depicted in art. Lindgren explained that the symposium will focus on "how people are often more
able to look closely, to stare, at a piece of art representing disability in some way then they are an actual person with disabilities. It can give someone an
opportunity to explore their own reactions to disability."
Ann Fox, associate professor of English at
Davidson College, is a speaker for Sunday's panel.
Currently, Fox serves as the chair of the MLA
Executive Committee of the Division ort Disability
Studies, and has served as a member of the executive
board of the Society for Disability Studies. Also, she
is the co-curator of two disability-related art exhibitions: RejFormations: Disability, Women, and
Sculpture and STARING.
Fox first became involved with disabilities studies through her interactions with a local theater, The
Disability Project, while working at Washington
University in St. Louis. "I'd never thought about disability as a culture; I'd never thought about disability activism or disability rights," Fox said.
Disability studies attracted Fox, who originally
studied feminist theory. "It totally made sense to me
to think about how gender is used to 'other' people,
certainly it makes sense that people whose bodies
deviate from what we think is 'normal,' how they
might be 'othered' by society" Fox said.
In anticipation of Sunday's discussion, Fox hopes
to share her expertise on the practical issues of being
a curator for a disability-related art exhibit. "This is
all fairly new, we're used to thinking about gender or
race as identity in the museum, but we're not used to

8

thinking about disability in the museum or the
gallery, in ways other than the very traditional," Fox
said. She desires to explore the questions prompted
when disability and art were placed into conversation.
Also, -Fox hopes that the symposium will "defamiliarize what we think we know about disability and
see it as an identity, as a culture, and not just as a
condition or something to be cured or something to
be avoided."
In addition, she believes that Swarthmore students can be prepared to hear "some really exciting
challenging ideas from [her] colleagues on the panel
and hopefully from [her]."
Georgina Kleege, an English professor at UC
Berkeley as well as a creative writer, will also speak
at the symposium. "My main interest is in access to
the visual arts for people who are blind. I am myself
blind so I have a vested interest in this," Kleege said.
In the early 19905, she began her work in disability studies. "It was very exciting to find a field of
study that allowed me to explore issues that were
personally of interest to me," Kleege said. Her primary focus within the field is representations of the
disabled community in literature and popular cul-

ture.

At the symposium, she hopes there will be an
to meet colleagues and students with an
interest in disability studies. "Students are going to
opportunity

be exposed to a whole range of different facets of
scholarship and art and culture related to disability," Kleege said.
Tobin Siebers, another panelist, is the V. L.
Parrington Collegiate Professor in the English
department of the University of Michigan and the
author of both "Disability Theory" and "Disability
Aesthetics." In his latter book, Siebers explains that
he explores "the relation between disability and
modern art, arguing for the centrality of disability to
the modern in art."
Siebers first became interested in disability studies 10 years ago when he noticed, "many works of
modern art seemed implicitly, if not explicitly, to
rely on images of disability for emotional effects." He
believes that people with disabilities are portrayed
in specific ways and thus, art provides a context in
which these images can be considered, debated, and
contested.
Haverford's symposium tomorrow afternoon will
provide insight into art's relationship to disability
studies through an artistic standpoint, a scholarly
perspective, and a curatorial view. "By interrogating
some of our most precious habits of thought about
human inferiority and superiority, about what is
beautiful and what is ugly, and about what is healthy
and what is sick, the symposium will demonstrate
both the critical and cultural value of disability studies," Siebers said.

virtually unknown outside of her home country. As
'Smurf Cody, the matriarch of a Melbourne crime family, Weaver manages to be both menacing and desperate,
usually within the same scene. Pound-for-pound, she's
the strongest of the five nominees, but in a category that
begs for showy performances and has a history of young
winners, Steinfeld has the edge to join Anna Paquin and
Tatum O'Neal as Oscar winners who couldn't get in to
see their own movie.
Best Supporting Actor
Should Win: Geoffrey Rush, "The King's Speech"
Will Win: "ChristianBale, "The Fighter"
Very tough call: It's almost impossible not to admire
the lengths Bale went to for his turn as the crack-addicted ex-fighter Dickie Eklund. It's not an exaggeration to
say he steals the movie, and that might have been part of
the problem: the performance is so aggressively showy,
so show-stopping and so much more potent than Mark
Wahlberg's main character that it can barely be called
support. Of course, he'll win for it, and it's hard to call it
undeserved, but Rush's performance as the plebeian foil
to Colin Firth's King George VI is what provides the
movie with the narrative momentum to keep moving
forward. Both men are fantastic, but it will be Bale's
abundance of highlight-reel moments that make him a
lock to take home the statue.

tion.
Annette Bening in "The Kids are All Right" still holds
dark-horse status, but there's no reason to think that
this won't be Portman's coronation as one of the best
actresses ofher generation.

Best Actor
Should and Will Win: Colin Firth, "The King's Speech"
The last time there was a lock like this in the acting
categories, it was for Helen Mirren playing the Queen of
England, and it's probably not a coincidence. Firth's performance as the reluctant King George VI, who must
overcome a debilitating stammer to address his nation,
is Oscar bait through and through. Nonetheless, he's
awfully good in it, generating a reservoir of sympathy
for a man and a problem that otherwise might not have
seemed so sympathetic. "The King's Speech" takes its
lifeblood from the performances: It's Firth, going toe-totoe with Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist, that
gives "The King's Speech" its raison d'etre. Anyone else
accepting this award on Sunday night will not only be
the upset of the century, but may also jump-start the War
of 1812: Part 11.

Best Director
Should and Will Win: David Fincher, "The Social
Network
Simply put, no one did a better job interpreting material this year. The contradiction of pairing Fincher, a
peerless visual stylist, with the inert style of writer
Aaron Sorkin has been noted elsewhere, but that makes
the director's ability to make Sorkin's script race no less
remarkable. Having brought back the cinematographer
from "Fight Club" and editors of "Zodiac," Fincher infuses the privileged world of Facebook's creators with a
tone that's just the right amount of sinister. No matter
how happy Zuckerberg and Friends seem to be, Fincher

never lets us forget that the other shoe is still dangling
above them, just waiting to drop. And then it does.

Best Picture
Should Win: "The Social Network"
Will Win: "The King's Speech"
If conventional wisdom holds true, "The King's
Speech" will become the seventh movie in the last 30
years to win Best Picture without its director taking
home a trophy as well. The other six: "Crash;"
"Chicago," "Gladiator," "Shakespeare in* Love,"
"Driving Miss Daisy," and "Chariots of Fire."
If you had to make a list of quintessential "liked it,
didn't love it" movies, wouldn't all six of these make
your list immediately? As it happens, "The King's
Speech" actually fits their profile pretty well. Other than
"Crash," every single one of these films is a period piece,
with the last four centered on relationships between people of different social classes. Not that these films
weren't perfectly good, it's just that they happen to be
the Oscars' version ofFrench toast: Other breakfasts can
be good too, but when are you ever not in the mood for
French toast?
That said, I enjoyed "The King's Speech," but
admired it the same way I would admire the figure-skating routine that won the silver medal: it was well-executed, there were a couple of great moments, ithit all the
notes it was supposed to
and that's it.
Nothing less, but also nothing more, and when you're
talking about the best movie of the year, shouldn't there
be something more? Look at it another way: In 2016, can
you picture anybody still talking about "The King's
Speech?" "The Social Network" however has that staying power, not least because the story of Facebook has
yet to be completed.
It's a 1930s gangster epic disguised as a movie where
scores get settled through aggressive coding. Across the
board, the film excels: Pitch-perfect performances,
crackling script and direction that made two hours race
right by. It's enough to make you wish, for the sake of the
Oscars, that Facebook were founded by a flawed British
king and a commoner who showed him the way.

Quest for the
Hungarian identity

I

Quarterly,
a journal

of art and
literature
written in
English by Hungarian scholars, rather
than the world atlas. I stumbled upon
an article in there on Sandor Marai
(1900-1989), a Hungarian journalist and
novelist who was popular during the
time between the two great wars. The
author of the article quoted one of
Marai's novels, "Strangers," where, in a
hotel in Paris, an Albanian mistook the
Hungarian protagonist for a Turk. After
15 years in my life, here it was, another
appendix to the innocent hungry-turkey
pun. Six-year-old me: Hungary is actually close to Turkey. Now: The people
also look quite similar. But this scene
was not a trivial moment for the protagonist. Here is how he reacted:
"This had never occurred to him.

10

Unconsciously he lifted his hand, he
wanted to touch his face, as if to find
a change, as if he had grown a wart,
or perhaps during the night, while
he was dreaming, his nose had developed a crook of its own. 'What makes
you think so?' he asked timidly,
taken aback. 'Your eyes,' said the

Albanian."

He seems overly shocked for what is,
in the end, simply a mistake of nationality or ethnicity. Even Gregor Samsa
had a milder surprise upon his metamorphosis. Now think. What kind of a
person would be astounded in such a
way because he was mistaken as a
Turkish person? There is a hint, later in
the novel.
"He took a quick breath and quickly
said, 'Tell me, do you consider me a
white man?' The black man looked
up, rolled the whites of his eyes, and
measured him up and down. In a
flush of excitement he [the protagonist] added: 'I mean, am I a real
white man, one hundred percent? I
know that I am neither black, nor
brown, nor yellow. But recently I
have been beset by doubts I think
you are an expert.'"
...

In Marai's novel, we see a Hungarian
in the 1920s obsessed with how he
appears ethnically, but the question of

his appearance is only an allegory to
the yet deeper and broader question:
namely, is Hungary part of Europe? Of
course Hungary technically resides in
Central Europe, but Europe in this context is not just a geographical place but
a cultural space where the only legitimate culture is Western European culture. Sandor Marai is just one of the
many Hungarians who have asked this
question. They ask in a hope for the
affirmative, but the answer has never
been given conclusively. My landlady
also mentioned this to me a few times.
One of the occasions was when we
went to a small exhibition, where there
was a picture of the Holy Crown of
Hungary. She said, for all the wish of
the Hungarians to be included in the
West, this Crown reminds her of their
standing. According to her, St. Stephen
(9677-1038), the first king of Hungary,
decided to be crowned by the Byzantine
Emperor (capital now in Turkey), considering their tribal origin in the East,
even when the Pope, the symbol of the
West, was more than willing to crown
St. Stephen in order to extend his influence.
There are, however, multiple legends
concerning the origin of the Crown,
including the one that the Pope sent it
to St. Stephen, but this multiplicity of
legends all the more suggests the
Hungarian ambivalence between East
and West.

February 24, 2011

Then again, Hungarians can be more
positive. In the encyclopedia of
Hungarian culture, which I quoted in

my last column, there is an entry, mindenki
magyar
Everyone's
Hungarian." There it says that mindenki magyar is "a subject which comes up
time and again in conversation, especially when people talk about all the
famous individuals who have (or might
have conceivably have) some connection to Hungary"
An example includes Attila, who
"has been popular [among Hungarians]
since the late 18th century, when the
nascent science of historiography discovered evidence of a Hun-Magyar relationship in ancient legends about the
Eastern origin of the Magyars, and
though modern science has never given
credence
it
still
National
Romanticism conceived of Atilla as the
proud ancestor of a great Magyar
empire that would one day rise, phoenix
like, up out ofits ashes."
Wedged between Western and
Eastern Europe, Hungarians seem to
have a feeling of great uncertainty.
Hungary is neither exactly West nor
precisely East. But from a differentperspective, Hungary is both sort of West
and kind of East. It is in such fuzziness
that the Hungarians get their idiosyncratic character, which keeps my pen.

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Christopher Gray
Year: 2014
From: Carteret, New Jersey

Current Residence: Wharton

What He's Wearing:
From head to toe, Gray's outfit relies on several of his
closet essentials. He is wearing a red-checkered flannel
shirt featuring gray panels, a shade that extends from his
shoes and jeans. Underneath his unbuttoned flannel, he
sports a slim-fit, cotton T-shirt. Gray said, "The foundation to every outfit is a T-shirt."
T-shirts are a staple in his wardrobe, and he purposely
coordinates his T-shirt with his shoelaces. "That's my own
little thing," he said. For this ensemble, the subtle hints of
yellow on the print of his T-shirt peer out, which complements the color ofhis shoe laces. To top off his outfit, Gray
sports a gray beanie that his mother crocheted. Finally, a
black cardigan neutralizes the array of prints and colors.
How He Describes His Style:
Gray describes his style as "a combination between
skater and prep," reflecting his skateboarding and prep
school background. His interest in skateboarding tends to
influence his preference of skinny jeans. In addition to
being in vogue, wearing skinny jeans assists him in skate
tricks. Unlike baggy pants, there is no excess fabric to
obstruct his skateboard landings. Gray has worn skinny
jeans since 10th grade, which was a time he believes that
fitted denim was not yet popular fashion.
His penchant for wearing cardigans and sporting a
more polished skateboard style started back in his prep
school days. The dress code required Gray to wear a shirt
and tie daily, along with khaki pants and a cardigan.
Gray's interest in dance has also influenced his style considerably. His appreciation for color in his ensembles
emerges from the Jerk Movement, a hip-hop dance culture
that started in California and whose performers often
sport bold colors.
Where He Shops:
Before arriving at Swarthmore, Gray shopped extensively in anticipation that there would be few shopping
precincts nearby. "Number one spot would be PacSun or

Hot Topic, then Urban Outfitters,
Tilly's, H&M and Zara," he said.
Despite bringing only a selection of
his clothes to campus, Gray has
enough clothes to last him over a
H
month without doing laundry.
Shopping for new glasses is a big
deal, Gray believes, particularly
because he wears his glasses on a
daily basis. Currently he wears a pair
of black-rimmed Burberry rims,
which features the Burberry signature
plaid pattern along the armband of the
glasses. The subtle yet sleek feature
convinced Gray to buy the pair.

Style Icons:
Gray finds fashion inspiration in
artists like Pharrell Williams, Chris
Brown and Lupe Fiasco, who are all
known for their polished, urban look. He
also borrows a few style elements from
Fonzworth Bentley, rapper and former
assistant to Sean Combs (Diddy). Gray considers his style to be quite different from
Bentley's and said, "even though [Bentley's
style is] really 'out-there,' most of his fashion sense is on point."

Favorite Item in His Closet:
Gray's khaki Converse blazer is a favorite
of his, and was purchased by his grandmother who, he believes, has a good eye for unique
finds. Though he chooses to wear it only occasionally, he appreciates its versatility. Gray
said, "It's unique. I've never seen anybody else
wear it or in a store." His appreciation for fashion runs through his family, as his grandparents were fashion designers during the 'Bos.
Thus, they gifted Chris with plenty of clothes,
including vintage pieces such as ties and leather
jackets. "A lot ofthe items they gave me are one of a kind,"
Gray said. In making outfit selections, he tends to balance
old-school pieces with more trendy items.

Freshmen do know how to talk; they've
learned. Last semester we did not know
how to talk. However, "this passage
demonstrates that Kierkegaard's
knight of infinite resignation maintains a relationship with the finite,
which may be characterized as, to use
more or less precision than anything
else and definitely as much as an elephant which one must consider comparable to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle based on the distinctly precarious, much contested and, furthermore,
indisputable notion that both concepts

paradigm
and
extremely funky" is something I can

hetereonormative

now say, for instance. From the above
statement, it is clear that I, a second
semester Swarthmore freshman, do
know how to talk and, perhaps more
notably, actually know what I am talking about. (Heisenberg's cat
used to
demonstrate that, on a macro level, if
left in a box long enough, Kierkegaard
will fall asleep).
Last semester, however, if I were
asked to synthesize information and
produce a statement in the manner
shown above I would have come up
with something a bit different:
"Indisputable finite elephant based in
Heisenberg's the letter 'e' maintains
more definitely a much contested and
distinctly infinite funky principle," I
would have said. These two statements
differ primarily in that the latter doesn't make very much sense, whereas the
former makes a great deal of sense. It is
true, of course, that even the second
statement would have been an
improvement over anything I might
have said at the very beginning of the
semester when I would have sounded
more like this: "elephant much and on
that a with to funky the," etc. Yes,
that's right, all first semester freshmen
spend most of their time being virtual-

ly unintelligible.

One might have found a first semes-

ter freshman shouting, "Am hello help

lost I!" or "Know you where do music
building the is?!" A large number of
first semester freshmen simply gave up
and refused to move, declaring, when
spoken to, that they were lobsters. It
seems that somewhere between orientation week and senior year,
Swarthmore students transform from a
clinical word salad to consistently producing articulate, logical, insightful
comments (most of which do not
involve any mention of lobsters).
Already as a second semester freshman, I have had moments of wild comprehensibility, as was demonstrated at
the beginning of this piece. We freshman learn very quickly. Why? Because
we are at Swarthmore, and we are
obsessed with learning things. All we
want to do is spend all day desperately
shoving information into our brains.
Often we are in such a frenzied state
that we become confused and literally
try to put other things in our brains.
Just the other day someone wandered
over to where I was sitting and proceeded to place my shoe on his head
since he must have, I must assume,
mistaken it for either knowledge or a
hat. Too frequently I find myself putting things on my head
cups of tea
for instance, or telephones, neither of

February 24, 2011

which are knowledge or hats.
Unlike comprehensibility, this is a
situation which is not in any way
restricted to freshmen. Everyone
seems to be confused in the realm of
distinguishing things from knowledge
or hats. I am forced to wonder whether
this is a problem that follows
Swarthmore students out into the
world. Are there ordinary citizens
everywhere, united by the condition of
having been through Swarthmore,
spontaneously putting things on their
heads in the misguided effort to learn
them? As in, "Aaahhgghh!!" goes the
public defender, "I really have to learn
this pencil!!! Or maybe it's a hat??!!"
Certainly, this is something to feel
legitimately concerned about if
midterms and global warming just
aren't cutting it Personally, I am quite
concerned. I'm also wondering
whether I might have handed in my
shoe instead of my philosophy essay
last week. Of course, I suppose it's
probably better to mistake one's shoe
for one's philosophy essay than for
one's astronomy problem set. Oh well,
best not to think about; Swarthmore
professors must be accustomed to that
sort of thing. Besides, I have to go!
There's learning do much too lobster!

Monologues raise awareness for women's sexuality

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY STEVEN HAZEL

shazell@swarthmore.edu

Since its debut in 1994, "The Vagina Monologues"
has toured throughout the United States and the
world, but it was not until last weekend that it came
to Swarthmore College. Last Friday and Saturday, a
group of Swarthmore women performed "The
Vagina Monologues" with the hopes of reminding
their audience of a topic often unexplored
women's sexuality and in particular, vaginas. "As
the play says, no one talks about them enough," said
Lisa Sendrow 'l3 who was the show's assistant
director. "What does it mean to be a woman? How
can we create safer spaces to discuss these issues?"
Mary Reindorp, director of this year's performance and resident of the Ville, explained that it all
began in 2009 when she noticed an audition
announcement in The Swarthmorean for "The

Vagina Monologues," directed by fellow resident
Satya Nelms. She auditioned for the play, made the
cut and was instantly hooked. "I found the whole
rehearsal process energizing and fun. In September
2010, Satya contacted me to ask if I'd be willing to
direct [this year's production]... I was very happy to
say yes, knowing I'd be providing an energizing
experience for others as well as raising funds for a
really good cause," Reindorp said.
As a women's rights activist, Eve Ensler wrote
"The Vagina Monologues" after interviewing dozens
of women with questions concerning their sexuality.
Using these stories and also addressing audiences
directly with personal stories about sexuality and
violence against women, the monologues bring
women's issues and domestic violence into the spotlight. However, Ensler did not stop there. Following
"The Vagina Monologues," she wrote more wildly
successful plays such as "The Good Body" in 2001
and "Necessary Targets" in 2005. Last month, she
published "I Am An Emotional Creature," which is
a parallel of her watershed work that looks into the
inner lives of young girls today.
In 1998, Ensler formed V-Day, an organization
that seeks to end violence against women and girls.
V-Day
the "V" stands alternatively for
Valentine's, victory, or vagina
allows groups to
perform "The Vagina Monologues," usually during
Valentine's Week, in an effort to raise money for
local projects that help end violence against women.
Since the debut performance in New York in 1998,
V-Day has developed into an organization that sponsors 5,400 performances each year. It has raised millions of dollars for projects to end local domestic violence, as well as violence worldwide from China to
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
As a part of the V-Day program, the proceeds
from the performance of Swarthmore's "The Vagina
Monologues" will go to the Domestic Abuse Project
of Delaware County in Media, which provides shelter for abused women and services to more than
5,400 residents of Delaware County each year.
"Women age 18-24 are the age group statistically
most likely to become victims of rape. I hope [to
convey] that each of us can be a part of trying to
reduce violence against women and build a culture
of peace," said Katie Kenyon, the manager of outreach and education for the project, in a speech after
the performance on Sunday.

Months before, during the auditioning process,
Reindorp worked along with Sendrow to match each
actress in the production with 'her' monologue.
"Our hope was that each woman would enjoy the
artistic challenge of trying to find how to bring the
character speaking in the monologue to life,"
Reindorp said. With her efforts to make the performance at Swarthmore College a reality this
semester, Sendrow explained that she was inspired
by a conversation with a friend about feminism. "I
wanted to shed light on women's issues, work with
the borough and have many people on campus
involved in the production," Sendrow said.
The actresses performed more than a dozen
monologues covering a wide range of topics.
Monologues included an emotional, yet sometimes
humorous story of an older woman reminiscing on
her first love, a sex worker relishing in her ability
to pleasure her female clients, a woman whose lover
helps her see her vagina as beautiful, and a New
Orleans resident angry about the change that has
yet to come, among others.
Despite their brevity, each of the monologues carried a poignant message. "I really feel that [the
director and assistant director! did an incredible job
in selecting our monologues. The roles assigned fit
each woman so beautifully," said Kylin Navarro' 11,
who performed "My Vagina Was My Village." Her
monologue highlighted the violence inflicted on
women during the war in Kosovo and Bosnia in the
late 90s.
Additional monologues called attention to the
violence inflicted against women in Afghanistan
and Haiti. "It was great to hear various stories from
different parts of the globe and to hear [different]
perspectives on women's sexuality," Riana Shah 'l4
said after watching the show.
In addition, the actresses considered the play an
opportunity to remind the audience of the importance of self-awareness in regards to women's sexuality. "Some women have deep, beautiful and complex relationships with their vaginas, some women
have painful and scarring relationships with their
vaginas, some women have a combination of both,
and some women don't yet have a relationship with
their vaginas at all," Navarro said. "The monologues aim to raise awareness about women's bodies
and women's lives and I hope that that's what we've
done."

Professor co-authors biography about Spanish writer
BY MIHIKA SRIVASTAVA

msrival@swarthmore.edu

On Thursday, February 17, the
Modern Languages and Literature
department hosted Professor Israel
Rolon of Immaculata University to
give a presentation about the biography he recently co-authored with
Professor Anna Caballe of the
University of Barcelone.
The presentation took place in the
Science Center and attracted students
and professors from the Spanish and
Latin American studies programs.
The biography, entitled "Carmen
Laforet: Una mujer en fuga," focuses
on the life and work of Spanish postwar author Carmen Laforet.
The program was part of a course
offered this semester entitled "La
guerra civil en la literatura y el cine,"
which focuses on the impact of postwar Spain as depicted in film, literature and other forms of culture.
Professor Maria Luisa Guardiola, who
teaches the course, organized the presentation.
"The purpose of this lecture and my
course is to show how it is important
to study post-war Spain through literature and film," Guardiola said.
"Carmen Laforet's story is crucial to

14

understanding the history of this period."
About 20 people composed the audience, which included students from
the Spanish, Latin American studies
program, as well as professors of the
departments. To begin his lecture,
Rolon spoke about Laforet's life and
career as a feminist post-war novelist.
"I could talk forever about Laforet!"
said Rolon.
Then, Rolon proceeded to delve into
stories about her life and struggles as
a female writer. He believes that
Laforet was one of the most important
writers in post-war Spain since she
began writing when art had completely died out because of the war. Her
most famous work the book "Nada"
won the highly acclaimed Premio
Nadal in 1944.
After the success of this first
groundbreaking novel, Laforet continued to publish five novels and articles,
though none were as well received as
"Nada." "Most people thought after
'Nada,' there was nada! [the Spanish
word meaning 'nothing'] but this wasn't true at all," Rolon said.
Rather, Rolon explained that as a
young graduate student, he became
extremely fascinated by Laforet's life
and work. For him, the biography is
-

-

an "exhaustive and meticulous look
into the life of Carmen Laforet and is
the culmination of his doctoral dissertation." Though Laforet stopped publishing novels and articles, she continued her writing in the forms of letters
to several people in her life.
This recent biography relies on
Rolon's personal interactions with
Laforet, interviews with people from
her life, and also, much of her epistolary work.
Following the presentation, Rolon
took questions from the audience,
which explored Laforet's life and relationships, the view of post-war Spain
and Rolon's personal interest in
CarmenLaforet. The detailed, in depth
questions from the audience demonstrated the listenerr's interest in both
Laforet's and Rolon's work.
After the presentation, Evelyn
Fraga 'l3 had mixed feelings. "On one
hand, I did become a little familiar
with who Carmen LaForet was, but at
same time I [was] looking for a little
bit more," Fraga said. She explained
that she felt less interested in Rolon's
writing process and more intrigued by
Laforet's work since she was unfamiliar with the author. However, Fraga
enjoyed Rolon's discussion of Laforet
as a feminist.

February 24, 2011

"Carmen Laforet's novels and her
own story is set in Spain but it is a
universal one," Rolon said, at the end
of his presentation. Though she was
the first Spanish writer to express
notions of feminism, Laforet stressed
that feminist themes could be appreciated by individuals worldwide, particularly in the United States. Rolon
explained that the timelessness of
Laforet's work and story inspired him
to write her biography.

Not only is it unfair in principle for there to be a

The Town Center West project must still go

After March 8, the chance for this issue to be
addressed won't come up for another two years. We
strongly encourage students, faculty, staff and

Unions are the key to real education reform
I got weepy watching
"Waiting for Superman,"
Davis Guggenheim's documentary on high performing public charter schools
and their lottery admissions process. Caught up in

the moment, I wondered
how corrupt bureaucrats
and self-interested unions
could cheat children out of
an education and a chance
at a better life.
Jon Erwin-Frank
Yet something about the
Sensible Socialist
simplicity of the film's
argument made the loyal
lefty in me uncomfortable. I
started to peruse the web to see what the pro-union folks
had to say. One blogger pointed out what should have
been obvious. She asked why the public lotteries, which
seemed to cruelly advertise the misfortune and trauma of
those not chosen, were necessary. Wouldn't a letter or
phone call suffice?
The obvious answer is that they are a public relations
campaign, designed to draw attention to the plight of children with little opportunity to get a quality education. But
couldn't that be done in a less sadistic manner? I read
more and grew more skeptical.
As I sought to learn enough to competently take a
stand on the school reform debate, a few things became
clear. The first is that for the most part we know what
works. The right formula for success depends on community context, but almost universally includes the following: independent but accountable administration; capable
and dedicated teachers; aggressive outreach to and active
involvement of parents and community members; a cohesive school community that encourages professional
development, longer school days; quality art; music and
extracurricular programs and a school culture that
assumes hard work; achievement and a path to college.
If a school can accomplish all of these, it can succeed
even in the most impoverished community with the most
disadvantaged students. This does not mean that context

doesn't matter. Bringing these requisites about will of
course be much more difficult in some neighborhoods
than in others.
Trying to significantly improve student achievement
in disadvantaged communities without addressing problems outside of schools would be less effective and less
efficient than a comprehensive approach. Yet it is possible
and those who feel it is important to push for social justice
in every sphere ofAmerican society should not hesitate to
expound the possibilities of real education reform.
Many proponents of the currently popular brand of
school "reform" point to charter schools as the answer to
our woes. Some acknowledge the fact that nationwide,
charter schools perform no better than comparable public
schools. They point to those such as the Harlem
Children's Zone (HCZ) and the Knowledge is Power
Program (KIPP) that have achieved extraordinary results
against what seem like impossible odds. These schools
have eliminated the achievement gap in some of the poor-

of wealth.
I'm still waiting for the groundswell of support that
will sweep the American socialist party to power, end the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, raise taxes on the rich and
spend it all on education. In the meantime I see only one
force with the potential to amass the political power to
truly reform U.S. education
that force is the unions.
I don't deny that improving our education system will
require greater accountability for teachers and their
unions. In many cases making it easier to fire teachers
would be a good thing. Merit pay might also be a good
idea, provided evaluation is based on more than test
scores. Merit pay based on scores viewed in light of context as well as surveys of students, parents, other teachers
and administrators could have a significant positive
impact. But accountability mechanisms will do little if

they cannot be in the state house, or even
the state, because there needs to be 20
senators present in order to vote. There
are 19 Republicans, so only one Democrat
is needed to vote.
There are two reasons for the bill
itself. First, the bill is a reasonable
response to the budget crisis in

Tyler Becker

THE, PHOENIX

Wisconsin in which there is over $4OO
million in unpaid bills in addition to
money owed to Minnesota. MSNBC host
Rachel Maddow reported this falsely saying that the state will have a surplus.
This is simply not true; Wisconsin will
have a budget shortfall next year that
could reach hundreds of millions of dollars when these other costs are factored
in, according to the nonpartisan
Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It is also not
true that Republican tax reforms are
causing the deficit, as those lower tax
rates do not take effect until the next
budget cycle and are likely to raise revenue.
Second, the government promised too
much to public employees in the past,
and, now that cuts need to be made, protesters are swarming the Wisconsin state
capitol in Madison. The truth is that
nobody wants to have cut government
spending. Some think that the government just had a bottomless piggy bank.
This could not be farther from the truth.
In fact, the reason Wisconsin is going
to be in a budget crisis is due to the excessive spending completed by the previous
legislature and governor in the state.
Prior to the 2010 midterms, both houses
of the legislature and the governorship
were controlled by Democrats.
In order for the Democrats to work
toward balancing the budget, they took
$2OO million from the "Injured Patients
and Families Compensation Fund," a
highly controversial maneuver that the
state supreme court later ruled unconsti-

tutional. Now, the state owes the fund
that $2OO million.
So, in the last legislative session,
rather than making difficult spending
cuts, the Democrats in Wisconsin took
money out of a fund illegally. This left the
dirty budget cutting task to the newly
elected Republican majorities in the
Wisconsin senate and assembly, as well
as newly-elected Republican Governor
Scott Walker.
Governor Walker and Republicans in
the state senate found that raising healthcare premiums and raising state employee contributions to their pensions to the
levels of private sector employees would
help close the budget shortfall.
Since the pensions cause such a strain
on the system right now, the bill includes
a provision to eliminate collective bargaining rights for state employees with
to
regards
their pension plans.
Employees would retain collective bargaining rights for wages and benefits.
Essentially, this story has been blown
out of proportion by the media and union
bosses. Governor Walker is not trying to
eliminate public sector unions or take
away the benefits teachers receive. He is
doing the best he can to balance the budget when he was left with a deficit. And, on
top of that, his proposals are sensible and
will avoid massive layoffs in the
Wisconsin government. If these concessions are not made, upwards of 12,000
state workers may be fired in order to
close the budget gap.
Despite these facts, the Democrats in

February 24,2011

the Wisconsin state senate will not

return. They are preparing to stay out of
the state for weeks if necessary to prevent a vote on the bill from happening.
The Democrats are playing a game that
they have already lost. Once they do
return, Republicans have more than
enough votes to pass the legislation.
The Democratic state senators are trying to move public opinion in their favor,
but that is not happening. Despite support from Organizing for America, the

Democratic National Committee, and
President Barack Obama, the public
opinion tide is not turning in favor of the
state employees.

The New York Times reported
Monday that while the focus has been on
the capital Madison, where state workers
and University of Wisconsin-Madison
students are protesting the cuts, the rest
of the state is supporting the plan put
forth by Governor Walker and the
Republicans. The Times wrote that "...
away from Madison, many people said
that public workers needed to share in
the sacrifice that their own families have
been forced to make."
The Democrats in the Wisconsin state
senate need to return to the state and stop
ignoring their duties as publicly elected
legislators. Elections have consequences
and budgets need to be balanced. The
Democrats should quit the politicking
and get back to work like the rest oftheir
state has to do each and every day.

matic that now, it's almost as if they have to. As if they
owe it to their families. We're not even finished with
"he has to put food on the table," a line so outdated that
it's become hilarious. Unless the table in question is
solid gold with legs made of elephant tusk, Pujols and
Sabathia could probably manage just fine with the
salaries they have now.
One of the unfortunate side effects is that even the

ecstatic praise that, upon further review, could stand to
be scaled back somewhat. Yes, there is something to be
said for taking less money to pitch where you want, but
when the choice is between $125 and $l5O million, the
sacrifice seems just a little bit less
sacrificial.
This isn't to say that athletes who pursue the biggest
contract are no longer criticized, but most of what's left
isn't so much criticism as it is bitterness, fueled solely
by the betrayal of the small market that got abandoned
or passed over by the athlete in question. MarkTeixeira
is still roundly booed in Baltimore because he refused
to sign with them at a hometown discount (although, in
all likelihood, whatever discount he took would have
still allowed him to stay off food stamps), but everywhere else, the sentiment at the time was mostly the
same: Why shouldn't he have tried to get the most
money he could have? What's more, how dare anybody
try to say that he shouldn't!
The root of all this is deceptively simple: expectations get lowered to the point where the mentality is no
longer "expect loyalty" but "if you can't beat 'em, join
'em." It's Stockholm Syndrome prepared special just for
players and their fans, where after years and years of
getting our hearts broken by players looking for more
money, we've gone over to the other side.
Now we're cheering on their quest for the highest
number, and we're cheering them as passionately as
our forefathers would have ripped them apart with
charges of avarice.
The only hope is that the process is not yet complete,
and that the balance has yet to be reached. It isn't a bad
thing that the blanket statement of "greedy athlete" has
been taken off the table, but holding a franchise hostage
simply to make sure that your pay is higher than anyone else's is not necessarily cause for martyrdom. In all
likelihood, Pujols will get the money he wants, and
Sabathia might as well.
Maybe, by the time that happens, we'll have settled
down to the point where we can calmly say, "Sure, they
can do whatever they want, but they wouldn't exactly
have starved otherwise."

Women's basketball closes out season with win
BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

When the buzzer sounded for the final
time at Haverford on Sunday, it was the
last the Swarthmore basketball teams will
hear for several months. The men closed
out the season with a 75-52 loss, while the
women walked off the court with a 65-60
win.
The men were led in the game as they
were all season: by the dynamic duo of Jay
Kober 'l4 and Will Gates 'l3. Kober scored
13 points to pace the Garnet, while Gates
added eight points and eight rebounds.
Gates' points gave him 457 for the season,
the seventh best season in Swarthmore
history for a men's basketball player.
Down by double digits after the first
half, the Garnet couldn't rally and
Haverford cruised.
The Garnet could not generate enough
offense to counter Haverford's shooting.
The Fords, who needed a win and Ursinus
to lose to qualify for the Centennial
Conference
shot nearly 50 percent

"It was a particularly meaningful win

this was definitely a fitting final game,"
Stockbower said.
The Garnet finished 15-10, 11-9 in the

As the season ends, so do the careers of
the Swarthmore seniors. After four years
of representing the Garnet, it is a bittersweet moment.
"Playing basketball at Swarthmore has

Swim teams place third at Conference Championships
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ANA APOSTOLERIS
aapostol@swarthmore.edu
At the beginning of the 2010-2011 season,

the Garnet men's and women's swim teams
the men
were at very different points
were protecting their reputation as one of
the top teams in the Centennial Conference,
and the women were looking to bounce
back from a disappointing finish to the
2009-10 season and facing the task of filling
the void after Anne Miller 'lO graduated.
However, the teams converged at the end of
the road last weekend, as both the men and
the women rode strong individual performances to a pair of third place overall finishes at the 2011 Centennial Conference
Championship meet at Gettysburg. The
teams finished behind host Gettysburg and
defending champion Franklin & Marshall.
Garnet swimmers won 21 medals combined over the course of the three-day meet
and staged an assault on the history books,
setting or tying three Swarthmore school
records, two American records and a
Gettysburg pool record.
"My expectations [going in] were my
usual expectations: to have a perfect meet,"
coach Sue Davis said. "We didn't have the
perfect meet, but everybody did swim season best or lifetime best times ... Everybody
that we took placed."
Pacing the men were Daniel Duncan 'l3,
John Flaherty 'l4 and Sam Bullard-Sisken
'l2, who set a school record. Leading the
charge for the women was Margaret Regan
14 who enjoyed a successfulbreakout meet.
Duncan, Swarthmore's top performer
throughout the dual meet season, brought
home the most hardware from Gettysburg,
winning two silver medals (200 IM, 400 IM)
and two bronze medals (200 butterfly, 400

medley relay).
"I was really unhappy with how I did
last year, so I just wanted to come out with
a medal to prove myself," Duncan said. The
medals were the first of his collegiate
career. "[Assistant coach Casmera Wick]
helped me a lot with relaxing and staying
comfortable with the beginning of my

races."
All three of Duncan's individual medals
came in tightly-contested competitions
with teammate Flaherty, whose threemedal haul (two bronze, one silver) was one
of the biggest surprises of the meet, according to Davis. "We knew he'd be fast," she
said. "I just didn't expect to see him on Dan
Duncan's heels." Flaherty came in third,
just behind Duncan, in the 200 and 400 IM,
and reached the wall ahead ofhis teammate
by three-tenths of a second to take silver in
the 200 fly.
Even Flaherty was surprised by his own
speed, and seems thrilled by the results. "I
was stunned," he said. "In the 200 IM on the
first day at prelims, I dropped seven seconds from my best time in the regular season, and five seconds from my lifetime
best." Before the Gettysburg Conferences,
Flaherty had only raced the 200 fly once
before. "To [grab] that silver medal it
was surreal, and I've never been happier."
"John had an awesome meet," Duncan
said of his teammate and competitor. "I
think we fed offeach other and kept it going
all weekend."
Flaherty and Duncan were not the only
outstanding performers on the men's side,
as Bullard-Sisken and Tim Brevart 'l2 both
rewrote the record books. Bullard-Sisken
broke a 15-year-old school record in the 100
backstroke (52.73), earning a silver medal.
Brevart tied the Swarthmore record in the
50 freestyle (2L23), matching the mark set
by his former captain, Doug Gilchrist-Scott
'O9. Brevart finished fourth.
Brevart dropped over half a second off
...

THE PHOENIX

his season best to reach the record. "I was
thrilled and at the same time in disbelief,"
he said. "Knowing that I [share the record]
with Doug gave me a sense of camaraderie
with my friend and former teammate."
Swarthmore's final individual medal
came courtesy of Jake Benveniste 'l3, who
won bronze in the 1650 freestyle on the final
day of competition.
Travis Pollen 'l2 continued to set the
national standard in sprint freestyle for his
Paralympic disability class (S9). He broke
the national record in the 50 (24.74) on
Friday, and then broke his own American
record in the 100 (54.73) on Sunday. Pollen,
an above-knee amputee, will compete in the
Paralympic National Championships this
spring.

On the women's side, Regan broke out in
a big way in her first Championship meet,
taking gold in the 400 IM and silver in the
200 butterfly, plus a fifth place finish in the
500 freestyle.
"She was ready," Davis said. "Maggie's a
great competitor."
Her gold medal was the only first-place
finish either Garnet team recorded in the
meet. Her time of 4:39.55 was a Gettysburg
pool record and three-tenths of a second off
the Swarthmore record.
Like Flaherty, Regan expressed surprise
at how well she swam over the weekend. "I
felt good at practice the week before
Conferences, but I had no idea that I was
going to swim that fast," she said.
In the qualifying heat of the IM, she led
the field and earned the top seed in finals.

"I had never been seeded first for an

event ever in my career as a swimmer, so it
was something that I didn't really know
how to react to or handle, besides being
really nervous but really excited at the
same time," Regan said.
There was no sign of nerves in the final
heat, as Regan found herself trailing by a
full second at the halfway mark, but pulled
ahead on the breaststroke leg of the race
and wound up touching almost four sec-

onds ahead of the silver medalist. The
comeback, Regan said, was part of the race
plan from the beginning.
"Butterfly is my weakest stroke," she
said, "so the plan is to always stay close
enough to my opponents so that I know I
will be able to catch up to them later in the
breaststroke. When I saw that I was closer
to my opponents than usual and I had not
died yet in the butterfly, I knew that I had it
in me to pass them and win the race."
Regan also swam a fast 200 breaststroke,
coming within half a second of the gold
medal.
The women saw one school mark fall, as
Rebecca Teng 'l4 finished up a spectacular
rookie season by breaking the Swarthmore
record in the 200 IM. Her time of 2:1196 gave
her a silver medal.
According to Teng, she was not focusing
on the record going into the race
in fact,
she wasn't even aware ofit. "I had no idea
what the school record was, which I think
worked out well for me," she said. "I wanted to go after the [gold], and not necessarily
a record, so it was a really great surprise.
The 200 butterfly accounted for the rest
of the Garnet girls' medals, as Erin Lowe 'l4
grabbed silver (2:09.69) and Hannah
Gotwals 13 earned the bronze (2:12.82).
The production of the freshmen this season was "wonderful," according to women's
captain Allison Bishop 1L "They're a
reflection of [the women's team] in general.
They swim while sick, they swim while
injured, they get their job done so that the
team gets what it needs. [l] love that about
them."
The meet was the last of Bishop's collegiate career; it also spelled the end of the

road for seniors SaSa Bedolfe, Chelsea
Brett, Santiago Lombo and David Dulaney.
Bishop said that she could not have gone
out on a better note. "The last event I swam
was the women's last event of the meet,"
she said. "I got to anchor our A [4OO
swimfreestyle] relay. It was awesome
ming with Chelsea [Brett], and 2 of my
freshmen, and I just got to put everything I
had left into that water."
Regardless, the future looks bright for
both the men and the women, given the
dominance of first-years and sophomores
on both sides. The women will lose a core of
distance swimmers in Bishop and Bedolfe,
and a formidable sprinter in Brett, but
Regan, Teng and Lowe have proven themselves more than capable of filling that gap.
"I love getting to see what the [first-years]
do," said Bishop, "because it does show us
where the team is going in the future."
The men stand to lose only Lombo and
Dulaney, and will retain the large group of
first-years and sophomores that propelled
the team's success this season. "It's still a
young team," Wick said, who acted as head

coach pro tempore during Davis' sabbatical
in the first half of the season. "It won't be
good losing [Lombo and Dulaney], but it's
two guys as opposed to four or five. That's
exciting."

Brevart sees only positives in the future
of the team. "If our freshmen class next
year is half as clutch as the current one, I
have no doubt that the 2011-2012 season will
hit the record books harder than ever," he
said.
As the coaches and swimmers begin to

look towards next year's journey, all can
agree that this season set an example to be
proud of. The men's team will, once again,
go into next season as one of the
Conference's teams to beat, and the women
proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it
takes more than a few graduations to slow
them down. "They set lofty goals, and they
achieved them all," Wick said.
"Both of these teams were great teams,
and they were fun to coach," Davis said.
"They showed a tremendous amount of
heart all year."

Ceylan Bodur finishes stellar career with 1,001 points
BY RENEE FLORES
rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

Recently, Ceylan Bodur, a senior on
the Swarthmore women's basketball
team, garnered a lot of attention due to
her career-ending torn ACL. The injury
occurred in the Garnet's home game
against Gettysburg College on January
29 where she scored her 999th career
point, leaving her just shy of the 1000th
point.

However, Bodur returned to Tarble
Pavilion for the WBCA Pink Zone game
against Bryn Mawr to perform the final
layup of her competitive basketball
career. In the last game of the regular
season, Bodur stepped onto the court
and reached her I,oooth point in a show
of sportsmanship that embodied her
remarkable basketball career at
Swarthmore.
Sarah Brajtbord remembered Bodur
as a first-year who would spot-up for a
three-point shot by looking down to see
if she was on the line, then "sink it in
your face." Bodur's talents have grown
on the court to include plays that no one
would attempt because they are "ridiculous." Brajtbord said that Coach [Renee]
DeVarney would get angry about a layup because it was not in good form,
until she realized it was a good play and
just smile.
Bodur is described as the "X-factor"
of the Garnet, pulling impressive plays
and getting the team to play at her level.
"When she has amazing games, everybody has amazing games. She changes
the pace of the game by playing Ceystyle basketball. She is the clicking factor," Brajtbord said. "[Being the X-factor] carries a lot of responsibility, and
she has stepped up so much."
DeVarney agreed about the X-factor
Bodur adds to the game. "Cey is that
person who doesn't get the big notoriety, but we're not successful unless
she's playing well. She's big in her own
right," she said.

Bodur is credited for her passion of
the game. Brajtbord and DeVarney both
immediately used this word to describe
Bodur. Brajtbord said that Bodur is a
player who is really in her element on
the court, adding that she is proud to
have had the chance to play basketball
with her. DeVarney agreed, saying that
she loves to watch Bodur on the court as
"an exciting, creative player and a passionate person."
Bodur began her basketball career
when she was 10 years old. Prior to
playing basketball, she played tennis.
However, she wanted to play a team
sport, and she never turned back. "It's
really addicting," Bodur said. Before
coming to the United States, Bodur
played basketball in Turkey throughout
high school, but said it was never as
serious as when she started at
Swarthmore.
Bodur faced the challenge of being a
student-athlete, but claims that the
team itself was what helped her in her
adjustment. "As an international [student], being on a team, it made my experience really different from other international students. It was easier because
I was part of a team. It felt like I
belonged," she said.
At Swarthmore, the academic environment proves to be rigorous, but
when athletics is added to that, it is necessary for student-athletes to balance
their time. "Being a student-athlete is
definitely a challenge, but it's fun.
[Balancing your time] happens on its
own. Basketball organizes your time,
especially if it's something you love.
This is what we do," Bodur said. "In the
spring, I feel lost. I don'tknow what to
do with all the time."
DeVarney remembers when Bodur
was a first-year, recalling that Bodur
was unable to bench press the 45-lb bar
in the gym for the team workouts. "You
can see the definite improvement in
her. She has surpassed that and doubled
it since then. To see this growth, as a
coach, that is rewarding."
"To sacrifice so much time, your
focus changes. Maybe it's just my obsession with basketball, but I find myself
thinking only about basketball," Bodur
said. Bodur's passion and love for the
game has led her to a long list of career
stats. She was named All-Tournament at
the Swarthmore Tip-Off Tournament in
her first year, named to the Centennial
Conference Academic Honor Roll her
sophomore and junior year and
received
Centennial
Conference
Honorable Mention as a junior.
Bodur played in every game for her
first three years and would have continued to do so as a senior were it not for
her injury. Bodur has been the second
leading scorer every season of her four
years, recording 1,001 career points and
making her the eighth in Swarthmore
program history to reach the 1,000
mark. Bodur led the team in 3-point
field goals, racking up 89 in her career.
Bodur's favorite shot was a buzzerbeater she made against Dickinson last
year that won the game. However, the
game that gave her the most satisfaction was the NYU game during winter
break this year. "Beating a team from
the AAU Conference was a good statement. It said we were a competitor.
With that win, we won their tourna-

ment," she said. The team quickly
adjusted to the other team's level of

play, something DeVarney emphasizes
as a key to winning.
All the attention revolving around
Bodur's final moments on the court left
her sentimental and also appreciative.
"It was such a symbolic moment. It
