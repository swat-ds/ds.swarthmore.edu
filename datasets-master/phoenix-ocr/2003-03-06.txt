Construction on
new dorm to start
over the summer
Board approves scaled-back,
less costly plans for Parrish
renovation and new dorm
BY AMANDA BROWN-INZ
abrownil@swarthmore.edu
The college plans to begin construction this summer on one of two
proposed dorm buildings, followed by renovations on the core of

Parrish Hall.
Maurice Eldridge '6l, a college vice president who serves as a liaison to the Board of Managers, said that the projected costs are $l5 million for the reduced dorm construction and $l2 million for Parrish renovations, bringing the total to $27 million. The cost of complete construction of the new dorm and reconstruction of Parrish was estimated at around $5O million. Construction and renovations had been
delayed indefinitely due to difficulties in raising the necessary funding.

professor Kenneth Sharpe.

Dan West, a vice president in charge of development, said that the
capital campaign was anxious to begin renovations in Parrish, where
there are a lot of safety issues, such as a lack of sprinkler systems, fire
exits and handicapped facilities. "We'd hate to delay renovations any
longer," he said.
Because renovating Parrish will decrease the number of student
rooms available by about 50, West said that the college would have to

College sets $82.6 million budget, raises tuition
Board scraps CBC's proposal for a smaller tuition increase, 2003-2004 fees will total $37,716
BY

SARAH STANTON
stanton@sccs.swarthmore.edu

To give Swarthmore's struggling budget a
boost, the Board of Managers approved a 4.5
percent tuition increase this weekend, bringing total tuition, room and board and fees to
$37,716. They accepted the rest of the budget
the College Budget Committee had proposed
without changes, but after extensive deliberation rejected the committee's recommendation to raise tuition by only 3.3 percent for
the 2003-2004 school year.
Students currently on financial aid will
not be affected by the tuition boost, said
Suzanne Welsh, Vice President for Finance
and Treasurer of the college. The expected
student contributions from summer earnings, work-study and loans will not go up.
For these students, the increased cost will be
covered by grants.
"The impact of this increase falls on fullpaying families" whom the Board assumes
can handle it, Welsh said.

In order to balance Swarthmore's budget,
the Board of Managers approved the CBC's
proposal not to increase departmental budgets next year. They also approved a $736,000
reduction in the budget. This reduction will
primarily come from decreasing funds to
purchase local rental property for the faculty,
condensing or eliminating currently vacant
faculty positions and eliminating commencement luncheons for faculty and staff.

THE

PHOENIX

The departments are well-prepared far
this budget decision, Welsh said. "We've kept
the faculty informed of our financial status.
They're aware we're in an environment with
a lot of cost pressures." The current budget
keeps faculty and staff compensation as one
of its highest priorities.

"Most institutions I know are
doing cost cutting combined
with tuition increases to
help bridge the gap."
Sue Welsh, vice president
and treasurer
"I think the Board of Managers has done
a good job in preparing a budget that will
have little impact on student life," said Anna
Morgan 'O4, Student Council co-president
and one of the board's student observers.
After hearing the debates this weekend, the

tuition increase "sounds reasonable, but it
saddens me that students will have to pay
that much," Morgan said.
Generally, the college tries to increase
tuition by the rate of inflation plus L 5 percent each year, Welsh said. "The goal is to
have tuitions increasing at the same rate as
March 6, 2003

non-financially aided family incomes."
During the past 10 years, the cost of
tuition, room and board and fees has
increased an average of 4.4 percent a year,
and it went up 4.5 percent for the current
school year. Based on the inflation model
Welsh described, the CBC arrived at its proposal of a 3.3 percent increase
a number
that would balance the budget and give families a bit of a break during this economically difficult time.
Two factors caused the Board of
Managers to deliberate on and finally scrap
the CBC's proposed tuition increase this
weekend, instead raising it to 4.5 percent.
One factor is the tuition decisions of other
colleges similar to Swarthmore. Welsh
reported that, in the past few weeks, several
other colleges have released their tuition
increases for next year. Many had approved
increases
substantially
higher
than
Swarthmore's proposal, reaching as high as
a 6.1 percent increase at Middlebury.
The other factor influencing the tuition
hike is the college's difficult financial situation. With the stock market and the college's
endowment down, combined with increasing
utility and insurance costs, Swarthmore,
along with many other colleges, is feeling
increased financial pressures.
"Most institutions I know are doing cost
cutting combined with tuition increases to

Renovations on

SBC doles out next year's funds

Parrish planned

BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER

From CONSTRUCTION, pg. 3
The initial plans for the new dorm involved the construction of two L-shaped buildings south of Mertz Hall,
only one of which the campaign currently plans to con-

struct.
Eldridge said that minor changes will be made to the
two buildings' plans, including the transfer of a basement
originally planned for the northernmost building to the
southern building.
According to Eldridge, Parrish renovations were
reduced from an "aesthetic transformation" to primary
renovations that would add elevators and sprinkler systems and reconstruct stairwells and other security meas-

ures.
Director of Development John Malcolm said the renovations would also involve the creation of a commons in
the core of the first floor with a mailroom, which would
move the Admissions Office to the second floor.

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

Student Budget Committee completed spring budgeting last Saturday, allocating more than $380,000 to almost
a hundred campus student groups.
According to SBC Treasurer Jeff Traczynski 'O4, this
year's budgeting process went smoothly, without significant cuts to most groups' budgets. In addition, the budgeting committee, which allocates funds to all service
organizations, club sports and interest groups on campus, was able to put money into both the general reserve
and the capital replacement fund, helping to rebuild two
accounts that were depleted last year and decrease the
major deficit that the fund faced three years ago.
Over the past two weeks, representatives of each campus group met with the eight SBC members to discuss the
financial needs of their organization. Traczynski said
this lengthy process gave the committee "a chance to talk
with every group on campus," which is an important
aspect of the budgeting process because "each group
leaves the SBC meeting knowing how much funding they
can expect to receive." As a result, of the 84 campus
organizations, only five are appealing the results of the
budget process.

"We chose to start work on a
reduced project that allows us to get
the essentials done. We didn't think
we should wait forever to renovate
Parrish."
Maurice Eldridge '6l,
vice president
"We chose to start work on a reduced project that
allows us to get the essentials done," Eldridge said. "We
didn't think we should wait forever to renovate Parrish."
Concerns about Parrish facilities and the desire to

move students out of substandard housing such as the
Strath Haven apartments were an incentive to begin both
projects, he said.
Campaign members expect that gifts will compose a
large portion of the fund and are in the process of seeking
donations. One large gift is already in the works.
The capital reserve budget has facilities money for
Parrish, which Malcolm said would also be under consideration as a contribution to the renovation of Parrish,
although the campaign would prefer to use gifts.
Eldridge said a significant amount of funding, estimated at $6 million over 20 years, will be gained from the
increased enrollment of 15 students. The addition of 15 students will fill a student-body cap of 1,375, set in 1999. The
student body has remained at about 1,360 students due to
limited housing.
The tuition money will be outside of the college's current expenditures budget, so it will be available to the capital campaign. Although the campaign will not receive the
money until long after the dorm is completed, it will serve
to pay back loans.
The campaign will attempt to raise the remaining $4-9
million that they estimate will complete the funding for
the project. If it raises the minimum of $4 million by June,
it will begin the new dorm construction, which will take
under two years to build.
Eldridge said that he was optimistic that the college
could reach the monetary goal in time to begin construc-

tion in the summer.
"Parrish is the symbolic heart of the college," Eldridge
said. "I think that it has a very good future in fund raising."

Of the $230 million goal the capital campaign set, it has
raised $ll9 million so far, putting the campaign at about its
halfway point. Eldridge said the money raised so far would
be not be used for the new dorm or the Parrish renovations
but would go toward funding the science center and other
projects.

"Given the turn in the economy that we are currently
experiencing," Eldridge said, "being at the halfway point
is very good."
Currently, there is no planned date for the construction
of the second halfof the new dormitory or for the extensive
renovations for Parrish.

Included in these five are Forum for Free Speech, volunteers for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and
Forum for Free Press, of which The Phoenix is a part.
The budgeting committee and Student Council will
hear the appeals on March 25.

When current seniors were freshmen, the fee was $226.
Traczynski proposed this increase in order to cover
the cost of inflation and a L 5 percent increase, the standard amount Student Council guidelines suggests.
Student Council, College Budget Committee and the
Board of Managers must approve the increase.
New spending limits
In a move designed to limit excessive spending on single meal events, the committee decided to limit the
amount of money for special dinners to $5OO for all groups
in the coming year. Similar events have cost upward of
$1,500 in the past.

The budgeting committee has also decided to standardize money paid to coaches of club sports. It has
evened the salaries at the highest level currently paid to
avoid salary cuts for any of the coaches.
Reserve accounts
In addition to funding student organizations, SBC
placed $25,000 into the general reserve to pay for unexpected financial needs that arise during the year. It also
placed almost $50,000 into the capital replacement fund in
an attempt to help rebuild the account.
The capital replacement fund is responsible for the
replacement and maintenance of large equipment,
such as student activity vans and Olde Club's sound
and lighting systems. In 1999-2000, the budgeting committee depleted the majority of the fund, requiring a 19
percent across-the-board cut for all student groups in
2000-200

Activities fee will likely increase
SBC distributed a total of $381,250. The major portion
of the committee's money comes from the student activity fee included in college tuition. In addition, the athletic
department contributes $10,675 to help fund club sports,
and the dean's office contributes $9,000 for general use.
The committee also receives $5,600 from the dividend
interest of the share it holds in the college's endowment.
Because the committee approves each organization's
budget without regard to the final amount of available
money, it does not know whether it has over-budgeted
until it totals the money allotted. Last year, SBC overbudgeted by $20,000 and had to implement severe cuts.
But Traczynski said the distribution of funds this year
was "right on budget," which he attributed to the fact that
most organizations requested the same amount of money
as they received last year following the cuts.
To maintain a balanced budget, however, the budgeting committee requested a slight increase in the student
activity fee. Traczynski said he requested an increase
from $290 to $3OO, a 3.3 percent increase from last year.

L

The committee is still working to replace these funds.
After this year's allocation, the capital replacement fund
will have $160,000, but, according to Traczynski, this figure should be around $175,000. The fund will need to pay
$15,000 to Rattech, the student organization that provides
sound equipment at parties, in order to help fund the
replacement of the sound equipment stolen from Paces
last semester. The fund's money will go toward replacing
four student activity vans, each of which costs around
$30,000. This replacement is scheduled to begin in 2007. In
addition, Olde Club contains $70,000 to sBo,ooo's worth of
audio equipment, which is replaced regularly.
Traczynski said that, while these needs do not seem
pressing, it is important for the budget committee to
build up savings now, because these large expenses are

inevitable.

The general reserve and capital replacement fund
accountswere entirely spent down in 1999, which led the
budgeting committee to cut $70,000 from what it had
already allocated to student groups during spring budgeting in 2000.

CIVIC applies for direct funding
BY ELIZABETH BUCKNER

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

For the first time in years, the
nine service groups that were previously unified under the umbrella

organization

Cooperative

Involvement of Volunteers in
Communities (CIVIC) had to apply
directly to the Student Budget
Committee for funds, a result of the
recent restructuring of CIVIC.
Despite the change, the budgeting
process for all the groups CIVIC had

previously budgeted went smoothly,
according to SBC chair Jeff
Traczynski 'O4.

In past years, CIVIC has distrib-

uted funds and organized transportation for the groups it covers. The
budgeting committeerevoked CIVIC's
budgeting powers when it became
concerned that some of the funds were
not directly benefiting students but
rather going straight to the people
with whom CIVIC was working.
In addition, Traczynski said the
SBC felt that it could handle the
budgeting of service organizations
directly.
"By budgeting directly, we could

March 6, 2003

ensure that these groups were held to
the same standards as all other
groups and that the same set of people were making the decisions concerning funding," he said.
Pat James, coordinator of CIVIC,
said she viewed the changes in a positive light. "This funding change is
not a bad thing, because it invites us
to consider the question, 'What is the
best way to engage students in student-led community service that
meets community needs and student
needs?'
After the recent changes, howev"

er, the role of CIVIC remains uncertain. Kai Xu 'O3, a co-coordinator of
CIVIC, said that "it is premature at
this moment to talk about the future
of CIVIC, simply because many of the
proposed changes haven't been finalized yet."

"In the future, however, CIVIC is
expected to take more of a role in
advising service groups and encouraging student participation in service. All I can say is that CIVIC will be
structured to meet the changing
needs of the students and the community," Xu said.

Student-led Arabic class closes shop
BY SUE CHEN

schenl@swarthmore.edu

When they could not take the religion
Arabic for Text Study at the

department's

beginning of last semester, they asked their
Palestinian friend Saed Atshan 'O6 for help.
"I kept asking him informally if he'd
have some time to give Arabic lessons on

the side now and then," Rebecca Brubaker
"06 said, "but I never guessed he'd take my
request as seriously as he did."
After receiving similar requests,
Atshan, who is from Ramallah, began
teaching the language to a group of five
first-years
in
mid-October.
"Saed
announced he was going to start a fullflung Arabic class, and of course we were
all ecstatic," said Brubaker, who had met
Atshan during orientation.
For two hours every Sunday night until
last week, when students' workload
prompted the class's cancellation, Atshan
explained the nuances of the Arabic alphabet and pronunciation to Rozina Ali 'O6,
Bernadette Baird-Zars 'O6, Janice Im 'O6,
Ben Schwartz 'O6 and Brubaker in a
Kohlberg classroom.
Nobody received academic credit from
this informal class, but that did not seem to
bother anyone.
"I'd been wanting to learn Arabic for a
long time," Baird-Zars said. "[The Middle
East] is a place in the world I'm curious
about and I want to visit and spend time in
and a place where not many people speak
English."
"They thought I was crazy," Brubaker
remembered, smiling at her parents' reaction to her taking a no-credit course.
Arabic, which many of the students considered the second most difficult language
to master after Mandarin Chinese, has a
script that reads from right to left and
words that drop their vowels in writing. Its
pronunciation includes guttural sounds
not found in English.
"It was really exciting to write the
script because it was so complex and elaborate," Ali said; a native Urdu speaker, she
hopes to use her Arabic to read the Quran.
Atshan, who was taught Arabic at a
school he attended in Palestine run by
British, Canadian and American Quakers,
admits he was a tough teacher.

"I was really strict," he smiled. "It was-

n't a blow-off sort of thing where we just sat
and joked around. I was serious and they
were serious."
"He gave us a two-hour exam the week
we came back from break," Baird-Zars
said. Her eyes widened at the memory.
"And it honestly took two hours. Every
single vocabulary word. That was pretty
intense."
Atshan spent about two hours preparing for each class, correcting homework,
photocopying handouts and making tapes
for his students, who were also his friends.
"I was doing it for our friendships' sake
as opposed to any other reason. It wasn't
hard, it was really fun," he said. "It was
rewarding just to see how far they've progressed, because Arabic is such a different
language than English."
"He was so conscientious, much more
so than any teacher I've had," Baird-Zars
said.
However, the work and time commitment of learning a new language quickly
became stressful for both teacher and students, and Atshan decided to end the class
last Sunday.
"We realized that everybody was really
overwhelmed and busy because we had so
many other things going on," he said.
"It's sad that we can't devote the time
and resources to something we really like
to learn," Baird-Zars said.
While everyone admits to feeling a mixture of both relief and disappointment at
the class's termination, some from the
class may form an Arabic study group after
midterms. Students also expressed a desire
to continue with the language: Baird-Zars

plans to study abroad in an Arabic-speaking country in her junior year, Im is thinking about attending a six-week language
program in Morocco and Schwartz wants
to go to Middlebury's summer Arabic pro-

gram.
"I think it breaks a lot of stereotypes for
people that these are white Americans that
are interested in Middle Eastern culture
and want to go to the Middle East and
immerse themselves," Atshan said.
Aside from Arabic for Text Study, the

college has no Arabic language course.

The one-credit course is taught by religion
professor Scott Kugle. Atshan is a teaching

Large-scale event canceled for the year
DJ Shadow backs out of deal; committee debates putting funds toward Worthstock
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu

With DJ Shadow unavailable to perform, there will be no large-scale event
this year. The Large-Scale Event
Committee met last Monday to discuss
what to do with the money that had been
set aside.
Dean of Student Activities Jenny Yim
said DJ Shadow's marketers, Clear
Channel, "were originally contacted in
December, and there was a possibility of
booking a tour. But then, come midFebruary, by the time the Large-Scale
Committee had met and submitted a proposal, the agent came back and said their
plans had changed."
According to Yim, one of the first alternatives considered was booking Clear
Channel's G-Love and Special Sauce

THE PHOENIX

instead, but that group was also unavail-

able.
"There will be no traditional large-scale
event this year" due to lack of time and to
a lack of space in which the event could
take place," Yim said. She had reserved
LPAC for the weekend of April 4 and 5 but
had to release the date when the plans to
bring DJ Shadow fell through.
The Large-Scale Event Committee also
considered using some of the money to
improve Worthstock, a concert of student
and outside bands held each spring, or to
put the money toward next year's largescale event.
"Right now, we are planning to run
some of that money into next year," Yim
said.
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5, a committee
member, said how the committee would
spend the money "won't be decided possi-

bly until after spring break" and that he
had no further comment.
Yim said the committee was anticipating that the money designated for this
year's event would be available, "but in

this economic climate there's no guarantee" that it would all be there in the same

amount for next year.
Student Budget Committee is also deciding what to do with its share of the money.
Jeff Traczynski 'O4, chair of Student Budget
Committee, could not be reached for comment.
"The large-scale event has only happened for the last few years," Yim said,
pointing out that it was still a new organization. It was created to "pool the money
together" Yim said, where students had
before approached individual departments
for small events. The result was a "frag-

Yim recognized that the large-scale

Faculty diversity at Swarthmore became
a major concern last year for the committee

Advocating Diversity in Various Ideologies
in a Campus Environment (ADVICE).
Members say the number of ethnic minority
faculty in tenure-track positions this year

show that Swarthmore is on par with other

colleges, despite the fact that the composition of the faculty does not mirror the diversity of students.

Detailed numbers ADVICE received from
the provost’s office show that of the 17 large
academic departments
those with more
than three tenured faculty positions
four
have no tenured minority faculty. Those
four are chemistry, philosophy, psychology,
and physics and astronomy.
“I don’t think we’re in a horrible position,” Anna Morgan ’O4, an ADVICE member, said. “I don’t think Swarthmore is lagging behind. I think it’s just a problem in
general.”

ADVICE is a coalition of all groups on
campus interested in working on diversity.
The campus’s cultural clubs send a representative to an annual organizational meeting, where they decide what issues to focus
on for the upcoming year. The group formed
in 1998. It meets occasionally with the deans
but has no official authority.
It has long been the case that few minority faculty hold tenured positions in academia, and Swarthmore has made efforts to
counter that pattern since the 19705. But it is

a problem ADVICE wants the college to continue addressing, though member William
Tran ’O3 noted that it was not easy to change
the composition of the faculty quickly.
Presently, there are six tenure-track faculty searches and four leave-replacement
searches in progress. ADVICE wanted to
know how the searches were progressing,
where the departments had advertised and
whether students were involved in the selection process. To answer some of these ques-

tions, they recently sent out a survey.
Most departments responded fairly
quickly. “I found the faculty responses very
interesting,” ADVICE member Paul
Maurizio ’O5 said. In the survey, some of the
less diverse departments, including psychology, philosophy and physics, claimed that
finding qualified minority applicants was
difficult since their fields are largely dominated by white males.

ADVICE often heard the comment, “Our
primary consideration is strength of candidate.” Morgan found this common sentiment
a bit upsetting. “I think it’s sad that they
think getting a strong candidate means not
getting a minority,” she said.
Many of the departments surveyed
seemed in favor of increasing diversity but
unsure of how to go about doing so. Some
departments kept their answers vague. The
psychology department, with eight tenuretrack positions and no tenured minorities,
said in its survey response, “Concerning the
role of diversity considerations in hiring
they are difficult to answer in anything but
generalities.”

“We’re not completely blaming the
departments,” Tran said. But in singling out
the departments for their lack of diversity,
ADVICE hopes that students will become

more aware of these issues.
Tran felt many students did not realize
how few minority faculty members are at
Swarthmore compared to the number of
minority students. “If you’re a minority student, I think it helps to see minority professors in the front of the classroom,” he said.
“I think it’s something that students
don’t think about as much when thinking
about diversity,” Maurizio said. He said he
hoped students would make the need for a
more diverse faculty as prevalent an issue
on campus as other diversity issues.
As part of an effort to bring attention to
the issue of faculty diversity, the committee
requested a list of tenured faculty with a
breakdown for women and minorities from
the provost’s office three semesters ago. In
2002, ADVICE discussed publicizing the
numbers of minority faculty members with
Jennie Keith, then provost. She was in support of the idea, as was her successor Connie
Hungerford, but did not immediately provide the numbers.
“Basically, her office was not really cooperative, and it was hard to get the numbers,”
ADVICE member William Tran ’O3 said. “I’m
not really sure what took so long. I definitely don’t want to believe that they were just
trying to be evasive.”
Marcia Brown, Hungerford’s assistant,
said, “I was not aware that any request had
been sitting for a long time. We’re always
happy to provide information.”
“The numbers of composition of faculty
is certainly no secret,” Brown said. “It doesn’t serve anybody’s purposes for us not to be
helpful.”

New Swarthmore Forum may bring Sen. John McCain to campus
BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu
For the inaugural event of the newly formed
Swarthmore Forum, three students may bring Senator
John McCain to Swarthmore in April.
According to Albert Chang 'O6, the Swarthmore Forum
is a student group dedicated to promoting non-partisan
free speech on campus. Members Chang, lan Flora 'OS, and
Ryan Kuker 'O6 hope to bring four or five well-known cultural or political figures to lecture here each year.
The Forum is applying for a Cooper grant to host
McCain. In the future, however, the group hopes to obtain
enough grants during the summer to manage its own
budget during the academic year.
"The Cooper Foundation asks that we already have a
speaker lined up before they'll give us money. Since we
don't have all the speakers lined up for next year, we can
only apply for money for McCain," Chang said.
Although it may cost $20,000 or more to bring wellknown individuals to campus, Chang said this did not
have to be the case. Government officials such as McCain
cannot command any honoraria. However, he added, the
forum would need more money to invite non-governmen-

6

tal cultural or political figures in the future.
"We need help, we need lots of help. Of course, the
main goal is to bring in speakers, but the second main
goal is to get money and to become self-sustaining," Chang
said.
The Forum will probably go to the Forum for Free
Speech as well as outside foundations to acquire funding
in the future, he said.
Although Chang has high hopes for the inaugural lecture, he noted that McCain's appearance is by no means
set in stone. Government officials' schedules can change
unexpectedly, and the senator may back out at the last
minute even if everything else has been worked out. Last
year, McCain was invited by a different group to speak
about campaign reform but had to withdraw due to the
events surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks.
Chang, an Evans Scholar, was inspired to create the
Swarthmore Forum by what he saw as "a lack of big-name
speakers" on campus. Evans Scholars are students chosen
to receive a scholarship based on demonstration of promise in leadership, intellectual curiosity, community service and athletic participation.
Having worked with the Cleveland City Club in high
school to help create a lecture series, Chang felt that it
March 6, 2003

was feasible to form a group with similar objectives here.
When he opened up his ideas to the other 45 Evans scholars, Flora and Kuker joined the effort. As Evans scholars,
the three students made use of the Kohlberg Foundation’s
connections with McCain’s office.
Another possible speaker is Governor of Vermont
Howard Dean, a Democratic candidate for the 2004 presidential election. The Kohlberg Foundation arranged a
meeting between all Evans scholars and Dean last
Saturday in Philadelphia, and the Swarthmore Forum
hopes to bring him to campus in the near future.
The Forum has received help from the Kohlberg
Foundation, but the two are separate entities, Chang said.
The two are “wholly independent from each other,” Chang

said.

“Moreover, we don’t feel that it’s necessary to have
additional contacts with the Foundation for future speakers. Connections are very overrated and can actually be a
bit of an impediment sometimes,” Chang said.
The Swarthmore Forum hopes to involve more students in the speaker selection process in the future and to
incorporate outside views into the series by inviting local
residents and high school students to participate in their
events.

Members of Earthlust lined up in
Sharpies last Friday to spell out the
word "recycle." At the Rush to Recycle
presentation last week, the
Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) awarded Swarthmore first place for their
efforts in the 2002 contest. The college

ranked number one for total average
pounds of recycling per student. The
DEP awarded Swarthmore $1,500 for
this achievement. The money will go
toward a further expansion of the college's recycling program.
"At Swarthmore, we hope to make
recycling a way of life among our students," Carr Everbach, Rush to Recycle
coordinator, said. "This competition
builds the kind of team spirit to make
sure the recycling habit continues."
The Rush to Recycle contest aims to

Really, the parallels between academia and reli-

gion go pretty deep.

Swarthmore has its share of academic monks, the
people who seal themselves in their rooms trying to
decipher books. Academia has a very well defined
good vs. evil moral code, usually explained in terms
of Democrat vs. Republican. And there's a ready supply of closed-minded people who just can't be reasoned with, i.e. fundamentalist intellectuals.
Both academia and religion claim that they can
answer questions about the world around us.
Religious scholars have long claimed that "God" is
the path to complete understanding of our world,

while academic scholars claim that "observable evidence" does the same. Here's a funny thought:

remembered by Swarthmore students.
Michael O'Keefe 'O4 watched the show "all the time"
when
he was "like, four." Though O'Keefe can't recall any specific
episodes, he "did always like the Land of Make-Believe," and
found Mr. Rogers' consistent sweater-changing upon entering
his house "sort of comforting."
Other students also had trouble recollecting individual
episodes but named the Land of Make-Believe, a worldof puppets
and castles reachable only by a magic trolley, a favorite element
of the show. Maile Arvin 'O5, who admittedly did not take any
"life lessons" from Mr. Rogers, remembered "the make-believe
part, puppets and stuff." Similarly, Molly Maurer 'O6 "loved the
trolley scenes and the characters in the trolley world," as well as
"the postman, who was really friendly."

"If Michael Jackson had watched more
Mr. Rogers, he would be normal."
Charles Small 'O3

Abe Howland 'O6 had Mr. Rogers on his mind even before the
sad news of his death last week. Howland, whose favorite character on the show was "the owl," designed a Mr. Rogers theme for
the matching of his roommate with a date for the Screw Your
Roommate formal. As originally planned by Howland, the Screw
scheme entailed his roommate dressing as an owl, his roommate's date dressing as a cat, and "something about a trolley."
Jennifer Ku 'O4 was "not really affected" by the death of Mr.
Rogers, but felt that she should have cared more than she did. Ku
explained her lack of strong sentimental reaction: "He was sort
of a weird icon, an ironic icon, to teenagers. I don't remember
having any attachment to Mr. Rogers."
Charles Small 'O3, on the other hand, was rather emotional in
his response to the news of Mr. Rogers' death. In addition to having been always "very impressed" by Mr. Rogers' shoe-removal
technique ("He would slip
one off and kind of throw it
in the air with his foot; it
was cool"), Small valued the
"happy thoughts and childhood innocence" fostered by
the show.

Howland, in discussing the life lessons he feels "Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood" imparted to him, echoed the sentiment of Small's
claim. Howland learned "to treat your neighbor respectfully and
stuff like that." Ku pointed out that the end of an episode, which
consisted of a few minutes of live footage presented and
explained by Mr. Rogers, was usually "very educational, like a
piece on candy factories or something." Maurer held an impression of the show's message representative of the reactions of students interviewed: "It was such a friendly show. It taught you to
be nice to everyone."

A hike we don't like
Tuition's up again. The college raises it every year,
but last weekend something different happened. The
College Budget Committee recommended a 3.3 percent
increase, but the Board of Managers rejected it, raising
costs 4.5 percent instead. That puts the burden on fullpaying families to pay $37,716.
Granted, 4.5 percent has been a normal tuition
increase the past few years. Last year, it went up 4.6 percent. But there was a reason the budget committee suggested a lower increase last weekend, a suggestion the

board ultimately ignored.
The committee recommends tuition growth based on
the inflation rate plus 15 percent. Last weekend, this formula determined that a 3.3 percent increase would be
appropriate. Disregarding this, the board decided to forge
ahead with an increase on par with those of recent years.
The board picked a bad time to do this. The economy
is in a slump. Families are making less, not more.
Students are graduating into a tough job market that
will make it hard to find work and pay off debts. By
2003-2004, tuition will have increased $6,026 in five
years. Does the college think families have been tacking
4.5 percent more revenue onto their salaries each year?
Financial aid will increase along with higher student charges, which is commendable. But the college
must know that not everyone who needs financial aid
gets it and that those who qualify don't get enough.
Hundreds of families and their kids take out loans, ask
for help from family members or look forward to an
extra decade of work to bankroll the phenomenal cost of
a private college education.
In the spring of 2000, the Board of Managers had a
policy of capping tuition increases at 41 percent a year
in spring of 2000. It decided to break with this policy two
years ago, when the troubled economic times were
beginning. No matter what other colleges are doing next
year
and Middlebury may well have increased its
tuition by 6.1 percent Swarthmore has a responsibility to its students not to burden them and their parents
with financial difficulties simply to relieve its own.

No easy solutions
for faculty diversity
are by nature difficult to discuss
without raising emotions. We've recently dealt with a
wave of conflict over affirmative action in college
admissions sparked by Swarthmore's decision to file an
amicus curiae brief on behalf of the University of
Michigan in its recent lawsuit.
But the significant issue of faculty diversity has been
mostly overlooked. Professors leading a discussion
have more power to define the culture of the college
than individual students participating.
Just as with student affirmative action, problems
crop up. How do we define a "qualified" candidate?
What do we do when social forces beyond our control
mean we get fewer non-white applicants than white
ones for faculty positions? Are there more qualified
white applicants who get overlooked in the interest of
diversity? Are there qualified minority applicants who
get overlooked because, somewhere in the process, they
didn't match someone's idea of a qualified applicant?
These problems are only multiplied for faculty hiring, since at that level any sort of standardized measure
of achievement is nonexistent. We don't deny that, to
give Swarthmore students the best experience possible,
we must seek diversity of background and point of view,
which can't happen if every face behind the lecture
podium is white. Yet we cannot provide any easy
answers to those departments that feel they can't
increase diversity of hiring without compromising
their standards of academic excellence. Until society as
a whole and the American educational system in particular fix the problems that create the race gap in the
upper levels of academia, colleges that value both academic excellence and diversity will often find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place.

Conservatives treated with hostility
Dear Editor:
Social position, privilege and power
are fluid and are largely context-driven. Take a local political leader from a
rural town, for example. Within the
boundaries of her constituency, she
may exert enormous influence. In
Washington, she might well be just
another small-town legislator. In their
letter to the editor, Chela Delgado 'O3
and Mariah Montgomery 'O4 largely
ignore this dynamic of fluidity.
We
often
characterize our
Swarthmore experience as one that
exists in a "bubble" of sorts. Make no
mistake, the soap that forms this bubble is overwhelmingly liberal from

our professors to
(feminist, queer,

the critical theories
Marxist, but rarely
conservative) we read in the classroom to our peer groups.

At an institution like
Swarthmore, it's clear
who is privileged.

and
at
an
institution
like
Swarthmore, it's clear who is privileged. Take the college's recent action
of signing the amicus curiae brief in
support of affirmative action as a
prime example of which party is institutionally privileged here.
While white males may be, as the

authors assert, "the most powerful
men in our country at the moment,"
they are not in this particular bubble.
Being silent may be a choice, but the
hostility, moral self-righteousness

I agree with the authors of the letter that "silencing is something that
institutionally privileged groups do to
institutionally oppressed groups,"

and suspicion that conservatives deal
with on this campus is, unfortunately,
not a choice at all.

The N-word

op-art

by

kat

bridges

Censorship has ruined "Tupac Shakur," a course I'm taking
at UPenn. Last week the professor, Rev. Michael Eric Dyson,
facilitated a debate on use of the N-word in class. As Tupac's

self-definition, the N-word is the crux of his vocabulary.
Indeed, his second album is called "Strictly for My Niggaz."
Because the N-word is so pivotal to Tupac's identity, Prof.
Dyson should never have opened the debate. If a person can't
handle the N-word, he doesn't belong in "Tupac Shakur." Just
as his albums warned "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics,"
Prof. Dyson should've warned
"Student Advisory: the N-word."
Alas, the censors won the day. No
more N-word. By censoring the Nword, Prof. Dyson has negated
Tupac's identity. His voice has
been silent throughout, for we
study none of his rap songs.
I chimed into the debate by
describing an English course I

once took which studied an
Wilson play set in black
Pittsburgh called "The Piano
Lesson." We read the book and
watched the movie. The N-word
TARU TAYLOR
jumped off every page, but it was
not part of the movie. By censorGadfly .
ing the N-word, Hallmark, the
producer, whitewashed August
Wilson's voice. Hallmark euphemized his characters and thus anaesthetized his audience. We
read as Wilson's audience. We watched as Hallmark's audience. A "Tupac Shakur" without the N-word is just like that
Hallmark movie: whitewashed. We've been anaesthetized.
During the debate, some got hysterical. Some blacks
claimed that the N-word,"as the most powerful word in the
English language, is beyond redemption, laden with too much
emotion. That begs the question, why take a class on a man
who was strictly for his "Niggaz"? Those same blacks hypocritically defend their use of the N-word by saying that it is a
term of endearment, and one really hysterical student added
that her use of the N-word, like Tupac's, was symptomatic of a
black American inferiority complex not yet over slavery.
Didn't Tupac use the N-word to get over it? Anyway, a double
standard was set, that blacks might use the N-word but not
whites. One white student asked, "If it's OK for blacks to use
the N-word all the time, and whites to use it none of the time,
what about mulattoes? Half the time?" Prof. Dyson suggested
"nig." Their playful exchange revealed the debate's absurdity.
The N-word is emotional. I challenge blacks to make it volitional. The secret to black power is to thrust the N-word on a
trajectory much like Northern whites have thrust the Y-word,
much like Friends have thrust the Q-word. Northern white
conquest of "Yankee" and Society of Friends conquest of
"Quaker" are both instructive.
"Quaker" was originally an insult alluding to the shaking
fits supposedly suffered by Friends moved by the spirit.
Swarthmore doesn't demand respect by insisting that people
refer to it as a Friends school. Swarthmore commands respect
as a Quaker school.
"Yankee," according to British officer Thomas Anburey,
derives from Cherokee "eankke," meaning "slave or coward."
Following the Oct. 17, 1777 British surrender to Continental
troops, Anburey wrote, "The soldiers at Boston used [Yankee]
as a term of reproach, but after the affair at Bunker's HiU, the
Americans gloried in it. Yankee Doodle is now their paean it
was not a little mortifying to hear them play this tune, when
their army marched down to our surrender." "Yankee Doodle"
was written by a British army surgeon to ridicule American
troops, yet when Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown on
October 19,1781, the Americans played "Yankee Doodle." Thus
did the Yankees command respect.
By insisting that non-blacks not use the N-word, blacks
have demanded respect. Only by conquering the N-word, by
embracing its black as well as its white use, will blacks command respect. I have a dream that, one day, people will speak
of Swarthmore as a "Quaker school" and Howard as a "Nigger
school" all in the same breath.

Foreigners face legal hassles
In his talk last week, Aaron McGruder reminded us
that "America hates black people, Arabs and losers."
Maybe he should add another group to the list: students
and scholars that happen to have been born outside U.S.
borders. A huge new electronic tracking mechanism
the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System,
or SEVIS
is now in place, designed to locate and
closely monitor the presence of all non-citizen college
personnel. SEVIS mandates that universities send the
federal government the academic, personal and disciplinary records of every foreign student they enroll.
In theory, SEVIS makes

creates yet another xenophobic, racist barrier to

Campus registration is a notoriously flawed enterprise. Records get lost, misplaced, scribbled over, AP
test scores get typed in wrong, "passes" turn into
"fails," names get botched. (My first high school transcript read, "Maya Schenwar III." I am not an heiress.)
It's usually a small, even mildly amusing annoyance
when a mistake surfaces. But for foreign students on
campuses across the country, minor transcript errors
could now mean deportation.
In a recent New York Times article, a college registrar worried that some of his foreign students might

over a pothole, you know there's something wrong with
the law. When breaking the law is something you can

you know the system is unfair.
It's especially unfair if you happen to be Muslim.
The INS will perform a separate registration, including
fingerprinting, photographing and interviewing, for
male students and professors from 24 "high security"

(Muslim) countries.
A recent scuffle at University of Colorado shows the
magnitude of INS paranoia. SEVIS detained half a
dozen Iranian students during the college's "special registration." One student, Yashar Zendehdel, had decided
to change his major and drop a course, thus putting him
below the course requirement for a full-time student.
Local immigration officials threatened to deport him.

So far, the INS has detained and arrested hundreds of
men and boys who registered voluntarily, on account of
minor inconsistencies in records. International education cultivates positive relations between the United

ing a whole lot of lately.
It allows for an exchange of knowledge, ideas and
minds that supersedes (or at least crosses) national borders. Universities are a space where people of all backgrounds and nationalities can come together, discuss

Allowing international students to attend our colleges and universities fosters a commitment to global

Is tolerance good Pledge debate a distraction
enough for you?
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ARTHUR CHU
achul@swarthmore.edu

On Swarthmore's campus, I hear cries of outrage
demanding tolerance
from both "liberals" and "conservatives." But many students voicing such ultimatums really
want nothing of the kind of campus that true tolerance can
give them. Furthermore, those students who do want tolerance who need tolerance to exist in Swarthmore's particular atmosphere
are often silenced. Effectively silenced, I
believe, and not always just silent.
But what is tolerance? Tolerance is a matter of the liberty of conscience, which necessarily constructs limits of liberty of action; it is intentionally allowing others to hold
beliefs and live lifestyles that you think are either wrong or
incomplete, insofar as their actions do not constrain your
own ability to do the same.
It presupposes a distinction
between right and wrong, the
existence of some standard
whether internal or external,
objective

or subjective

and actions. Tolerance
is not blanket acceptance; it
only becomes necessary when
blanket acceptance is impossible.
I propose that many students

lodized Salt
What they really want is acceptance; they desire not to be merely allowed to be themselves, but
to have this be affirmed as completely good by others.
However, this is antithetical to tolerance, because the
requirement for affirmation compromises the liberty of conscience of individuals who are neither relativists with

KRISTA MARSHALL

respect to morality nor subjectivists with respect to truth.
Please consider your personal responsibility to make possible real.tolerance if that is what you desire. But if what
you want is unconditional acceptance of your own views
and actions, then realize that this makes true tolerance
impossible on this campus.
The types of political, social and moral views that predominate at Swarthmore are often the reverse of those in
the majority on a national level. However, the way in which
the majority views dismiss, silence and oppress the minority views has not changed.
I think this is a tragedy for the life of this campus, one
that makes me weep (both when I am in the majority and
when I am in the minority). Might has become right; power
(or how loud and long you can speak out about something)
has taken the place of truth in deciding what is permissible
to think and advocate.
Just because people with minority viewpoints can theoretically "speak up if they want to be heard" about particular issues (see last week's thoughtful and well-written letter
to the editor by Chela Delgado 'O3 and Mariah Montgomery
'O4, p. 18) does not mean that it is easy or even practical for
them to do so.
It is hard to not care about what others think of you and
scary to risk being ostracized from the college intellectual
community as irrational. It is painful to speak up when you
have experienced
in big or small ways
an atmosphere
of social pressures that can effectively make you feel invalidated as a member of that community because of your
views.
Sometimes liberals silence conservatives, sometimes
conservatives silence liberals and sometimes we treat each
other in this way along completely different lines. But it
takes a difficult and deliberate choice to speak up when it is
very reasonable to feel silenced.
There is a difference between being silenced and choosing to be silent. However, theoretical freedom of expression
does not always mean that there is any easy way to emotionally and socially deal with speaking out. You may have
to choose to be silent because you have little reason to
expect tolerance.

issue facing the United States educational system than the Pledge of
Allegiance's constitutionality, at
least in the media's eyes. It makes
me glad not to live in France, where
children haven't pledged allegiance
to the American flag for centuries.
(Can you imagine?)
In a world where the complexities of reality are threatening to
drown us every day, a debate about
symbols seems a dangerous distraction, especially one as seemingly

people feel that a symbol becomes
tacky and drained of meaning the
more widespread it becomes, the
more it becomes a matter of conforming to peer pressure rather
than making a personal choice.
Some people feel an institutionalized symbol that all must participate in loses all its meaning. I am
one of those people.

That aside, this has almost no
relevance to the actual court case. I
may not think that enforced recitation of the pledge in primary school
is a good idea, but that doesn't mean
school boards at the local level don't
have a right to do it.
What the court case is about isn't

the pledge, it's about one phrase in
the pledge: the "under God" line.
Really, there's no inherent connection here. America shouldn't be
about being under God, and if it is,
then we've strayed from what the
founders wanted it to be when they
wrote the First Amendment and
disestablished the New England
Puritans and Southern Anglicans in
the first place. Even the original
pledge, when it was written, lacked
the "under God" phrase. It was
added in 1954 after a long campaign
by the Knights of Columbus as a
way to distinguish the United States
from the godless Communists (a
wrongheaded, reactionary, blackand-white view of geopolitics if I
ever saw one).
Kids are sensitive. If a kid doesn't believe in God, it's not fair and
it's not just to pressure him into
paying lip service to the concept by
institutionalizing a pledge.
Maybe we would be best served
by reverting to the model of the

original pledge writer, Francis
Bellamy.
A lifelong socialist, he would've
balked at the "under God" addition
almost certainly, but what he
hated most in his lifetime was the
change in wording that changed a
personal statement of loyalty into

an institutional salute.
Maybe we should stop command-

ing students to "pledge allegiance to
the flag of the United States of
America" and, instead, let them
come to decide on their own to
"pledge allegiance to my flag."

Ideological housing misguided
The deans and Housing Committee have been busy
lately. In addition to tinkering around with coed and
single-sex housing, they've also broken with college
tradition by approving the creation of two new theme
halls. One of these, the multicultural hall, will "serve
as a center for multicultural activities, including
weekly discussions, open
forums and a large campus
event each semester." The
other one, the substancefree hall, will be a place
where getting high off of
anything but life is strictly

forbidden.
The substance-free hall
is probably not a terrible
idea. Even though I strongly disapprove of a sub-

stance-free lifestyle
heck, I've spent the past
three years goading my ex-

roommate to start smoking
I can at least understand
the reasoning
behind it. In the same way that not everyone appreciates rainbows, adorable puppies or classical music, not
everyone appreciates Wild Turkey, Marlboro Reds or

hallucinogen-excreting toads. There's no use arguing
with personal taste. If a bunch of teetotalers want to
come together and carve out a space where their collective preferences will be respected, more power to
them. As long as nobody winds up on that hall involuntarily, and the deans seem to be taking pains to prevent that from happening, it's tough to see how this
proposal could backfire too badly.
But the multicultural hall puzzles me. I find it a little hard to believe that anybody would wake up one
morning, take a look around his or her dorm room and
say, "By golly, my living arrangements don't adequate-

March 6, 2003

ly reflect the rich racial and cultural diversity

of the

college community!" I find it very hard to believe that
anyone would say, "The way things are right now, I
can't have a decent discussion about multiculturalism." And when the unnamed Swattie says, "Life on an
officially sanctioned multicultural hall will teach me
valuable leadership skills," that's when the zany meter
catches fire and explodes. Then again, perhaps this scenario isn't so implausible. If Swarthmore College
teaches us anything, it's that Swatties are nuts.
In order to keep the number of angry letters manageable, I want to say that I don't have any problem
whatsoever with multiculturalism per se. It's not something that I think about on a regular basis, but that's
just because there are other issues I find more interesting, not because I think multiculturalism is inherently flawed. If people want to have earnest conversations about how wonderful diversity is and wave the
flags of many nations, again, more power to them. My
beef is with the idea that multiculturalism is such a
vital topic that people ought to build their lives around
it.
There's something unwholesome about defining
one's identity around a particular issue. Much like
Shang Tsung, the final boss from "Mortal Kombat,"
excessive engagement with politics can devour souls.
Dedication to a cause is fine and good, but after a certain point people tend to forget that politics is a means
to an end rather than an end in and of itself. They lose
the ability to distinguish between themselves and their
causes, and, all too often, they lose their sense of perspective. When a man isn't capable of living just for
himself anymore, when he feels that every decision he
makes has to be justified through an appeal to dogma,
he has lost something precious. Ideologically based
housing, whether it is based on multiculturalism, conservatism, saving the whales, freeing Mumia or what-;
ever, will only hasten this ugly trend.

Professors discuss Iraqi war
BY GREG NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Students came with questions on topics
ranging from the possibility of a draft to
the role of Turkey's military as political
science professors Kenneth Sharpe and

James Kurth held the last of a series of

evening discussions on the possible war in
Iraq last Thursday.
Both professors were opposed to an
American war on Iraq they see as practically inevitable, and both feared that the
war could destabilize the region, particularly for the Kurds in Northern Iraq and
Turkey.
Kurth, whose expertise is in military
strategy, said that if he had the president's
ear he would "have advised against going
to war with Iraq." Kurth said he believed
the military itself was opposed to war and
that many senior military officials felt that
500,000 United States ground troops would
be needed to take control of Iraq.
Sharpe asked the audience if there was

any real difference between "nation building and empire building" and questioned
the United States' motives for waging a
war against Iraq, pointing out that "Iraq is
the weakest member of the axis of evil."
Americans should not blame the French
and Russian opposition to an American
war entirely on their desire to export Iraqi
oil or on a "general social discontent with
the United States," Sharpe said. The difference between the United States and these
countries, he said, is that Europe wants to
disarm Iraq while the United States wants

to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
Sharpe did not speak positively about

the future of the United Nations and said
he predicted a period of "doom and gloom"

for international relations. If the United
States were to go to war without the consent of the United Nations, he said, the
United Nations would be weakened, and if
the United Nations gave consent, it could
be weakened as well. The United States, he
said, could "threaten the United Nations
with irrelevance" as a means of getting
approval for a war on Iraq.
Kurth said that if the United States
were to concede to the United Nations and

"Iraq is the weakest
member of the axis of

evil."
Professor Kenneth
Sharpe
did not go to war because it was against
international law, then Bush could maintain the appearance of credibility, which
Kurth believed was important to the
administration.
The professors seemed to agree about
most of the issues raised concerning a possible war on Iraq, but this was not the case
when the discussion moved to North
Korea. Kurth said he believed North Korea
had been planning to develop nuclear
weapons for years and that nothing that
had happened between North Korea, the
United Nations and the United States in the
last year had made any effect on their
progress. Sharpe felt that mistakes in
American diplomacy had hastened Korea's
race for nuclear arms.

actually far higher than
even non-financial aid students pay. A significant portion of each student's education is subsidized by the
endowment. For example,
during the 2001-2002 school
year, the endowment provided an additional $28,915
per student in addition to a
student's full tuition.
"It's a real balancing

Privacy bill to prevent FBI from
snooping into library records
BY DAN TRUDEAU
MICHIGAN DAILY (U. MICHIGAN)
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich.
Concern over violation of privacy as a
result of the war on terrorism has prompted U.S. Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and
other representatives to propose a bill that
will limit the FBl's power to seize information on library withdrawals and bookstore

purchases.

Since the passage of the USA PATRIOT
Act in October 2001, federal investigators
have received warrants to access library
and bookstore records through secret
courts outside of the realm of public scrutiny. Sanders and other congressmen have
called the act a violation of civil rights and
are calling for changes to the investigation
process.
"While we need to focus on terrorism as
much as possible, I believe we can do that
without throwing the Bill of Rights in the
garbage can," Sanders said. "Librarians
are telling me that if people who go to
libraries feel that the government is keeping a file with the names of the books that

are reading, it will have a chilling
effect on intellectual curiosity."
Sanders added that under the current
system, readers interested in information
on nuclear technology, terrorism and
other sensitive topics might feel reluctant
to pursue their interests for fear of drawthey

ing the FBl's attention.
Federal Justice officials responded by
firmly defending the effectiveness of the
current laws and said that law enforcement officials are in compliance with the

Constitution.
The PATRIOT Act "has given the
Justice Department and the FBI a greater

ability to protect the American people,"

March 6, 2003

Justice Department spokesman Mark
Corallo said. "Everything that we have
done has been fully within the bounds of
the U.S. Constitution and the statutory
authority of the U.S. Congress."

Corallo added that the PATRIOT Act

passed by a strong bipartisan majority in

both the House and the Senate and that the

Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of
1978 maintains governmental checks and
balances by requiring law enforcement
agencies to obtain a warrant before proceeding with an investigation.
"All the PATRIOT Act does is broaden
the scope of information that can be sought
through a FISA warrant. You still have to
go through a federal judge to get a warrant," Corallo said.
Sanders argues that while the current
system recognizes checks and balances, it
weakens civil rights by placing the proceedings in a secret federal court.
"We're proposing to move back to the
old process which I think worked better.

Under the new system, the (FBl's) limitations are extremely low," he said.
But U.S. Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) is cosponsoring the bill and believes that many
aspects of the PATRIOT Act are actually
just an excuse for law enforcement agencies to violate privacy without justification.
"A lot of it is just what law enforcement
has always wanted to root through your
personal information. To us, this is simply
not permissible," Paul spokesman Jeff
Deist said. "We're not going to make the
country any safer by violating the Fourth
Amendment."
The specific ramifications of the proannounced
posal will be publicly
Thursday. FBI investigators declined to
comment on the proposal.

Murphy looks to bounce
back from ACL surgery
BY ERIKA DOYLE
edoylel@swarthmore.edu
It has started. The many rough hours of preseason
practice are over, and the new turf on Clothier Field has
been broken in. In their first week of play, the Garnet
men split a pair of games with a non-conference loss to

Steven Tech and a victory over Manhattanville.
This past Saturday, Swat lost 11-4 to the Stevens Tech
Ducks at an away game in Hoboken, N.J. Junior attack
Joe DeSimone 'O4 scored with 9:22, remaining in the
third to tie the game at 4-4. The Ducks then pulled away
to the point of no return by scoring three goals in a
short span of three minutes. The Tide held early leads of
1-0 and 2-1 on goals by attack Jeff Donlea 'O5 and middie
Tim Chryssikos 'O5. Than Court 'O3 added a goal, and

John Murphy 'O3
aided with two
assists. Goalkeeper

goal for the game.
The Garnet opened their season on Wednesday, Feb.
26, with an encouraging non-conference victory 9-2 over
Manhattanville. "We went into the Manhattanville
game hungry. We had a long preseason and were itching to play someone other than ourselves," co-captain
Court said.

Co-captain Murphy and middie Chung Lee 'O5 each
scored twice to lead a balanced Tide offensive attack
that saw seven players hit the back of the net. After two
minutes of play, Manhattanville struck first on a Scott
Cohen goal. Pat Friel 'O3 tied the game with a man-up
goal at 9:06 on a Murphy assist. The Garnet then scored
the next seven goals to take an 8-1 advantage. After the
game, they looked back on the strengths that had helped
secure this win. "Our ride allowed the offense to get
some additional possessions, and also the midfielders
played well defensively," head coach Pat Gress said.
Splitting decisions this past week, the Garnet look
ahead to spring break as an opportunity to improve
their efforts and prepare their team strategy. "We will
watch video of our Stevens Tech game and correct some
mistakes and take advantage of the warmer weather to
practice outside," coach Gress said. With a full week of
practice before the Goucher game coming up this
Saturday, Swat will face off with a more confident glare
The Tide hope to improve on last year's 6-8 recorc
with the return of 20 letter winners and the addition of
seven newcomers. The midfield is fortunate to reclaim
several dedicated veterans with plenty of game experi
ence. Four-year starter and team co-captain John
Murphy 'O3 will assuredly play a crucial role in the
team's success this year. After undergoing surgery for
a torn anterior cruciate ligament this fall, Murphy wil
be returning for his senior year to full-time action fol
lowing months of rehabilitation. He has 115 career
points and needs just six more to enter Swarthmore's

record books.
One week into their official season thus far, the
Garnet men look back to last year's seniors for inspira
tion and motivation to guide them through the upcom
ing season. "We're definitely missing Jason, Trak and
Blake, last year's seniors. Choi with his attitude, Tra]
with his immutable spirit, and Blake with his faceoff
prowess left some big shoes to fill," Court said. With th
memories of these seniors fresh in their minds, the new
squad remains confident of their abilities to be success
ful this season. "We have a lot of talent on the team, in
aggregate, more so than in years past. It'll just be a mat
ter of capitalizing on it and playing to our full poten
tial," Court said.
Expectations are running high for the Garnet, bu
they embrace the challenge with open arms and read
lacrosse sticks. "I expect the team to be competitiv
with each opponent, regardless of their national rank
ing, and to improve throughout the season," coac
Gress said.

number four singles event with a 6-1,

spirit of the day, Townsend captured
the number five match 6-1, 6-0, while
Sonia Vallabh 'O6 stole the sixth singles win with a 6-1, 6-3 showing.
The women's team, ranked 29th
nationally by the ITA, surely expects
to be a contender in the Centennial
Conference this year. Returning for
another season, Reddy has already
shown her versatility and skill, posting a 13-1 record on the year. The

team has also added six incoming
first-years to their rosters. Anjali
Aggarwal 'O6, whose contributions

boosted the women's badminton
team this winter, will look to carry
her success over to the sport of tennis. "The strength of our team this
year is definitely our depth," head
coach Jeremy Loomis said; "We are
confident that down the lineup, we
will have a tough and able competitor go on the court for our team.
Additionally, having this much
depth creates a great atmosphere,
and it really charges the team up to
practice with other solid players."
The women will compete against

University during spring break, and
Loomis expects good things from his

squad. "Despite our good play thus
far, I actually expect our performance
to improve as the season continues,"
he said. "We've started strong, but
the team is not satisfied and knows if
we are to come close to our goals, it

will take effort to improve throughout the whole year."

Tide advance to ECAC semifinals
Last night, the fourth-seeded Swarthmore women's
basketball team rolled to a 68-58 victory over fifth-seeded Alvernia in the first round of the ECAC Division 111
Women's Southern Basketball Championship. The
Crusaders brought a 7-9 record and a troop of cheerleaders to Tarble Pavilion. Alvernia opened up the
scoring with an Erin Mclntyre trey, but the Garnet

quickly answered with a jumper from forward Katie
Robinson 'O3. Swarthmore led by as many as eight
points midway through the first frame, but Alvernia
chipped away at the Garnet lead behind Mclntyre's 14
first-half points. The Garnet held on to a six-point halftime lead heading into the locker room.

with 14 points. Robinson paced the Garnet with her
seventh double-double of the season, with 17 points and
11 rebounds.
While last night's victory might force some changes
of spring break plans, the team is happy to still be on the
court. "We're all very excited to be playing still. Most
of the teams in our conference have hung up their
shoes; they're done," Lauren Kett 'O5 said. "It's an
honor that we still get to keep playing."
Swarthmore will head to first-seeded Moravian
College (20-7) on Saturday for their semifinal matchup
with the Greyhounds.

Gardner, Golden snag silvers at track conferences
Women's distance medley relay team wins gold, sets meet and school record
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu

The much-anticipated 2003 Centennial Conference
Indoor Track and Field Championships culminated a season of enthusiastic commitment, perseverance and
steady improvement for the Garnet indoor teams. After
two days of intense competition, the Garnet women finished in seventh place with 36 points, while the Garnet
men finished in ninth place with 25 points.
For many of the athletes, commitment to the program
meant sacrificing the Screw Your Roommate Formal in
favor of a good night's sleep before the meet.
"We put a lot of time into training and had to give up
things like watching Sharpies' 'Screw Dinner,' but it was
all worth it in the end," harrier Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 said.
Gardner capped off a stellar season by winning a silver medal in the 800-meter run with a school record time
of 2:19.88, breaking an eight-year-old mark. She credits
much of her success to head coach Peter Carroll, who has
been instrumental in the team's success this season: "I
just put all my trust in my coach," she said. "He really
knows what he is doing. He believes in us and makes sure
that we are ready, and I just run the times he tells me to
run and have fun."
Njideka Akunyili 'O4 finished close behind Gardner in
the 8000-meter run with a fifth place finish at 2:24.36. The
distance medley relay team of Akunyili, Gardner, Claire
Hoverman 'O3 and Sarah Hobbs 'O6 grabbed gold in meetand school-record time by finishing in a speedy 12:34.36.
"We did great in the distance medley relay because we
had a strong team and have been working hard," harrier
Akunyili said. "For outdoor, we are striving to get
stronger, run faster and have a tougher team."
Hobbs is also anticipating their success to follow in
the spring. "Well beyond the fact that we currently do not

have an outdoor track to run on, I think the season is definitely looking up," Hobbs said, referring to unfinished
repairs on the college's track.
"The success behind winning the distance medley
relay this past weekend lies in the women who ran the
event," Hoverman added. "All of the women ran well at
the conference meet, giving their best effort and leaving
everything they had on the track."

"I let the guys from Muhlenberg and
Haverford set the pace for me, and
then I outkicked them at the end."
James Golden 'O5
Jessica Zagory 'O5 placed fourth in the high jump,
matching her season best by clearing a height of L 47
meters.
"I think the work we put in during the fall semester
and through January is the reason why many of us did
well at conferences," Zagory explained. She said it was
difficult for her "not having jumped competitively since
the January meet at Haverford
but you get to a point
where you have to trust what you put in."
The 4xBoo-meter relay team of Hobbs, Akunyili,
Hoverman and Emily Wistar 'O6 placed fourth in a time of
9:52.82. The 4x400 relay team of Akunyili, Gardner,
Hoverman and Hobbs finished fifth in a time of 4:13.40.
Highlighting the men's side, James Golden 'O5 outkicked a pack of Haverford runners in the last 400-meter
stretch to take home the silver medal in the 5000-meter
run at a blistering time of 15:27.02.
...

"I was able to place well because of the strategy I
used," said Golden. "I let the guys from Muhlenberg and
Haverford set the pace for me, and then I outkicked them
at the end. I put in enough miles over the season so that I
could run at their pace for the whole race, and Coach
Carroll had me run lots of short fast workouts so I was
able to finish stronger than they were."
The distance medley relay team of Golden, Garrett
Ash 'O5, Paul Thibodeau 'O6 and Matt Williams 'O4 finished third in a time of 10:36.00 to earn six points.
"We were originally planning on running individual
events, but after Paul, James and I all ran well at Boston,
we realized we had the potential for a great distance medley relay," Ash said. "There's a lot of great potential on
this team, and I think we're just starting to figure out
how to realize it. Outdoors will be fun."
Williams also advanced to the finals in the 55-meter
hurdles with a preliminary time of 8.43 seconds, finishing
third in the heat. In the finals, he finished eighth in 8.53
seconds.

"This weekend was a productive one for the entire
team, but especially for me," Williams said. "I had six
races over the course of the weekend, ranging from the
55-meter hurdles to the 800, and I survived. I prepared for
the meet by not doing a thing on Friday so that I would
have some energy on Saturday."
Shot-putter Rob Melick 'O3 closed out his final indoor
season with a fifth-place finish at 12.87 meters. The 4xBoorelay team of Thibodeau, Williams, Ash and Adam
Hunt 'O6 finished fifth at 8:19.92. The 4x400-meter relay team
of Williams, Thibodeau, Kier Wachterhauser 'O4 and Tyler
Lyson 'O6 finished ninth with a time of 3:39.0. Zac Zaitlin 'O6
also finished eighth in the triple jump at 1L97 meters.
"We had a fun indoor season filled with steady
progress," Williams said. "We will continue to work hard,
so this progress should continue."

Volleyball team holds clinic to raise money,
awareness for breast cancer research
BY EMILY CONLON AND
ERIKA DOYLE
econlonl@swarthmore.edu and
edoylel@swarthmore.edu

Volleyball is more than just a

sport played on a 30 ft. by 60 ft.
court. It is a way of life lived
every day off the court as well.
On Sunday, Feb. 23, the
Swarthmore women's volleyball
squad hosted the Volley for the
Cure youth volleyball clinic at
Tarble Pavilion to raise money

for breast cancer research, education and treatment.
Breast cancer, the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in women, kills about 43,300
women this year alone, according
to the Susan G. Komen Breast
Cancer Foundation. As a way of
supporting early detection and
expanding awareness for the disease, the Garnet women took it
upon themselves to hold this volleyball clinic.
The two-hour clinic was a
means to raise funds to fight a disease that affects women of all
ages. Twenty local boys and girls
between the ages of 6 and 12 participated in the event. With their
donations, Swarthmore collected
$2OO for the Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation.
In addition to the money the
clinic raised, the Garnet women
THE PHOENIX

solicited over $l,OOO as a team.
"The girls did a great job raising
so much money for such a small
team. They took initiative and
devoted their time and efforts to a
worthwhile cause," said head

coach Harleigh Leach.
The women traveled up to
Connecticut last Friday to participate in the eighth annual Cathy

D'Apice Tournament. The daylong
event honors the memory of
D'Apice, an avid volleyball player

from West Hartford, Conn., who
fell victim to the disease shortly
before her 30th birthday. A participant in the tournament for the
past seven years, coach Leach
thought it a great chance to
involve her team in this memorable experience.

The women played four matches during the day, competing
against adult women's club teams
in the area. "I loved having the

opportunity to play with other
women, some of them older than
us and from colleges we don't normally get to play," Sarah Donovan
'O4 said. Thirteen teams competed,
including eight Division II and 111
collegiate teams, as well as five
club teams. The Garnet women
found the experience valuable.
Patrice Berry 'O6 described the
mood of the day, saying, "Women
came together sharing the same
aim and the same love of the game.

It was amazing."

The participants took a midday
break and gathered at center court
to pay tribute to D'Apice. Fran
Vandermeer, the volleyball coach
at Williams and tournament
organizer, recalled the wonderful
times she had shared playing with
her former teammate, and she
urged the participants to keep supMarch 6, 2003

porting the Race for a Cure.
In future years, coach Leach
hopes to bring this Volley for the
Cure event down to the
Philadelphia area. Haverford has
already shown its support for the
event, contributing generously to

the Garnet's collective donations. She hopes more local
teams will step up and partici-

pate. "Not only will this be a
great charity event for the
Philadelphia area, but it will also

show collegiate players what vollife can be like outside of
college," coach Leach said.

Cheer up, Madness
is approaching
I used to think that Seasonal Affective Disorder was a load of crap.
Then we got the blizzard from hell and now there is a foot of rock-hard
snow on the ground the week before spring break. Now I sleep till
noon, dreaming of green grass, warm weather and beer die. I try not to
go outside, as the campus has turned into a veritable death trap; black
ice keeps jumping out of nowhere and knocking me on my ass. I know
thatI am not the only one suffering, so I have come up with a short list
6f items to think about to keep you warm and happy. When you look
out the window and start to feel sad, remember one of these things,
realize you will be able to partake

soon, and enter a happy place.
1. March Madness is almost in full
the dream of any
swing. That's right
degenerate sports addict will soon be
televised in all its splendor. It will soon
be possible to sit in front of the tube
and soak up a solid eight hours of college hoops per day. And not just your
average college hoops, mind you. I am
talking about a tournament with more
highlights, upsets and heartbreakers

than any other playoff system. Don't
forget about the gambling implications, either. The NCAA tournament is
the one time of the year when it is
JOSH LOEFFLER
socially acceptable to place wagers on
sporting events. That alone is enough
Riding the Pine
to cheer me up. Plus, winning your
pool gives you full bragging rights
until the next season. For a whole year,
you can pretend like some kind of insider information that only you
were keen to helped you pick Kent to go to the Elite Eight. I still
remember the tourney of 'OO, when I finished in the top four percent on
ESPN.com. I've been living off thatfor the past three years. If all of this
is not enough to get you through the poor weather, thenI do not know
what to tell you.
2. Except that wrestling is BACK! That's right, folks. After a brief
hiatus when the wrestling world was void of its superstars, the names
they
you know and love have returned. Stone Cold, Hulk, the Rock
are all back. Oh, you think wrestling is for immature, feeble-minded
individuals with a warped perception of reality? Well, maybe it is, but
>hat does not mean I don't love it. Wrestling is a freak show, full of sick
athletes beating the hell out of each other. The characters go from good
to evil, to dead, to reincarnated. Tell me what better entertainment
there is than a soap opera with balletic violence. Go ahead, think of
something better. And now all my favorites are back: superstars I grew
up with (Hogan) and the ones I so admired during my formative teen
years (Stone Cold). I assure you, I will definitely be tuning in to see
some beasts open up cans of whoop-ass. I suggest you do the same.
3. So far, all of my suggestions have pretty much involved sitting
around, watching television. The essence of springtime, though, is the
option of going outside and enjoying the fantastic weather. I know of
no better way to do this than to play the two greatest outdoor leisure
games of all time. Firstly, there is four square. Oh, no, four square is
not just for elementary school kids. It is a timeless game, probably
made better by the increases motor skills that accompany age. Even
better than playing with Swatties: going to an elementary school during recess period, challenging some youngsters and wrecking shop on
,f ome nine year olds Billy Madison style. Secondly, we have Wiffle Ball.
Oh, yes, the mighty Wiffle. Partake in this pastime for no other reason
than the fact that inventing pitches is the most entertaining thing
about spring. Hour upon hour of my childhood was spent experimenting with grips and hole angles, trying to gain millimeters of movement
on my breaking stuff.
It's remembering those kinds of moments that get me through these
boring weeks. That and the thought that I will have the opportunity to
strike out all comers in a short while. Start gettingready. Spring is just
around the corner.

Whoosh! That was the sound heard around the

court last Saturday as the women's tennis team
swept the Carnegie Mellon Tartans 9-0. With that
win, the team improves its record to 2-0, of which

both wins were shutouts.
Boasting a number eight rank in the Atlantic
South region in the Omni Hotels Collegiate Tennis
Rankings of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association
(ITA), the team defeated eleventh-ranked CMU easily. Anjani Reddy 'O4 and newcomer Emily
Townsend 'O6 shone in the top-seeded doubles seat,
earning an 8-1 victory over Alison Liu and Grace
Hwang. Reddy and Townsend proved that they
deserve their number nine ranking in the region.

The second doubles team of Caroline Celano 'O4 and
Kristina Pao 'O4 had an equally impressive effort,
beating Frannie Ritchie and Elizabeth Weiss 8-0 to
help the Garnet. The sweep in doubles play was
cemented as Katherine Voll 'O3 and Meagan Speare
'O5 won 8-3 in the third doubles position over CMU's
Meredith Fry and Ann Kowalski.
In the individual matches, Reddy dominated
Carnegie Mellon first singles player Alison Liu, a

first-year star known for her tennis prowess in her
home state. Reddy, ranked sixth in the region last
year among singles players, defeated Liu 6-4,6-4. Pao
again demonstrated her talent in the second singles
event, winning 6-1, 6-0, while Celano echoed her
teammates' victories with her own 6-0, 6-0 shutout.
