Media lounge reopening delayed

Facilities Management is in the

of Facilities' attention, the rewiring has
often been delayed.
"We have to deal first with what's

Over the summer, the lounge's computer lab suffered a number of damages
including leaking, rodent infestation,
unstable ceiling panels and white grit
falling from the ceiling.
New wiring will be installed between
the lab and the server room, where SCCS
holds office hours, so that new computers

My

Doom

pgoldsml@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore network users suffered from another barrage of malicious e-mail attacks this week. The new worm,
MyDoom, deliveredblank or garbled e-mail messages with
subject headings like "hi," "error message" or "test" that
appeared to have come from trusted sources such as Robin
Jacobsen, client services manager for Information
Technology Services. The messages contained attachments
that, once opened, spread the worm onto the user's computer.
Jacobsen described MyDoom as a "very rapidly spreading worm." Because of MyDoom's ability to mimic the
characteristics of a trustworthy sender's e-mail, users are
tricked into opening the unsolicited attachments on the email, spreading the worm even further. The worm will
only infect users with Windows operating systems.
The worm has become so virulent on the Internet that
anti-virus companies have raised their level of warning to
"high," according to CNN. One in twelve e-mails on the
Internet was infected with the worm on Tuesday, CNN

reported,

"It's definitely been

Once the wiring is
completed, SCCS wiU
begin setting up the
new computers that
were recently acquired

from the computer science department.
How long this will take depends on "how
nasty the computers will be to set up,"
Salmon said.
While the computer lab may be closed,
the video pit is the one feature of the
lounge that is currently operational.
Students and clubs can use the space to

screen films or to play videogames.
"It's a very cozy room, and it allows
for more interaction between students
than a normal theater would," said
Wynn Wu 'O4, co-president of Films of
Fury, a group that uses the pit for
screenings.

It is still unclear when the entire

lounge will reopen, though Maguire
believes most of the wiring should be
complete by mid-February.

SCCS hopes that "the lounge can open
as soon as possible," Salmon said. "It's

really frustrating, because the freshmen
class doesn't even know this place exists."

update until 1 or 2 a.m., Jacobsen said. By then, hundreds
of junk e-mails had already flooded the e-mail servers.
At 9 a.m. on Monday, students were already noticing emails piling up in their inboxes from different users, all

with infected attachments. The different file types of
attachments that MyDoom uses included .pif, .exe, .cmd,
.zip and .scr, ITS Network and Systems Manager Mark
Dumic said. Some students would open these attachments
and infect their computers with the worm.
Norton Systemworks, the company that produces and
maintains the virus scan technology used by the college,
released a new virus protection profile on Monday
,Jacobsen said. This profile contained the updated protection package that would identify and block the worm.
Using the newly installed ePolicy network software, ITS
was able to push a virus protection patch to all campus
users with the updated virus protection software installed
on their computer, Dumic said.
"We think that with the addition of Campus Manager
and ePolicy we can be a lot more proactive" about stopping
viruses from spreading and upgrading all of the virus-protection software, he said.
The ePolicy program only requires one person to send
out a new update to all computers with the program
installed. Before winter break, ITS had to manually con-

January 29,

2004

figure computers to get the update. Now, whenever a new
virus is released and attacks the network, ITS can com-

pletely protect the network in a matter of hours.
In fact, most of the wait is now on the shoulders of the
virus protection company. ITS was forced to wait for
Norton to release its new profile in the middle of the
night, Jacobsen said.
An emergency patch was released by Norton earlier
in the night, which helped prevent some of the worm's
progress, but by then the network had already been

infected with MyDoom.
ITS is now pushing to purge all computers of the
infected files. The task is somewhat urgent, because a
Denial of Service attack has been discovered inside the
code of MyDoom. The attack, which will attempt to overload a Web site owned by an information technology
company, is set to launch Feb. 1 from every computer
infected with the worm, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle.
ITS expects to have all files purged and cleaned up by
the February deadline, Dumic said, but only if users continue to install virus protection upgrades. Several
Windows XP users who came back from break early
missed installing the new software for their computers
because of an issue with the patch, Dumic said.

Sharples worker faces cancer with courage, faith

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Johnson
family

BY MEGO LIEN
mlienl@swarthmore.edu

The walls of Nazma Alam's bedroom are bare, save for
two pocket-sized plaques hanging near the corners. One
says "Best attitude, 2000-2001," the other, "Most willing to
be a team player, 1999-2000."
The awards are testaments to Alam's dedication during
her six years as a cashier at Sharpies. "She was a workaholic," Alam's daughter-in-law Humayra Ali said. "She
loved her job. Sometimes she worked nine or 10 hours a
day."
These days, this attitude must serve Alam well in her
time of need. In September 2003, Alam was diagnosed with
terminal liver cancer, and she has been fighting an uphill
battle ever since.
Although she reacted positively to initial chemotherapy treatments, regaining her appetite and some of the
weight she had lost, Alam is now struggling with the
tumors that have spread to her lungs, making breathing
difficult. Her eyes are sunken, and she moves around slowly and heavily, often with two or three people supporting
her. Most of the time, Alam lies on a bundle of blankets on
the floor next to her bed. She waits for the arrival of a hospital bed that will allow her to lie on a more comfortable
incline.

"Swarthmore students are like my
children. I love the college."
Nazma Alam
In the initial stages of therapy, Alam managed to get up,
table for a meal or go to the mall for
some fresh air, her second daughter Maya said. Today,
even speaking is a challenge.
Most knew Alam as the woman who swiped their ID
cards before every meal, but those who were lucky enough
to know her better spoke of Alam's loving personality.
"She's always been known as the sweetest person," Emily
Tancredi-Brice 'O4 said. "She always asks how you're
doing. She's incredibly open and friendly."
Tancredi-Brice, Alam's partner in the Learning for Life
program, described her as "quiet and radiant."
"Swarthmore students are like my children," Alam
said. "I love the college."
Oriana Galardi-Este 'O6 described Alam as "gentle and
quiet" but "religious in her love for people." So when
Tariq, Alam's oldest child and only son, was deployed to
Iraq, Alam was particularly devastated, Galardi-Este
said.
Tariq studied engineering at Drexel University under
an ROTC scholarship. In May 2003, he left his job at

and his

behind to serve the
United States in Iraq. As a first
lieutenant, Tariq managed a platoon of 24 soldiers at Camp

Victory,

the

military's

main

headquarters.

Fearful for Tariq's safety,
Alam began fasting and prayed to
Allah to protect her son. "She's
very sensitive," Galardi-Este
said. "The way she reacted to her
son's deployment, the way she
fasted it was remarkable."
As a result, "no one really saw
[the cancer] coming because
[Alam] was always looking pale

and sickly," Galardi-Este said.
After her diagnosis, when doctors gave Alam three weeks to six
months to live, Tariq and Ali

immediately began a campaign to
bring Tariq home to his mother.
Although he was committed to
the military, Tariq did not feel he
could concentrate on his duties
while Alam was sick at home.
"As platoon leader, I was responsible for all these soldiers," Tariq
said. "It's a hostile area there,
and they needed leadership. But

with terminal liver cancer last year.

when you know your mother has three weeks to live,
there's nothing else on your mind."
Swarthmore students who had heard about Alam's illness and wanted to help soon leapt into the project.
Tancredi-Brice and Melinda Lee 'O4 drafted a petition
advocating humanitarian discharge for Tariq. They accumulated over 1,000 signatures from the Swarthmore community of students, staff and faculty.
"We'd ask people to sign a petition, and they'd start
heading for the door," Lee said. "But when we said, 'lt's for
foom!
Nazma,'
they'd turn around. Not everyone

remembered her, but, no matter what, they still realized

she was an integral part of community."
In November, Tariq returned from Iraq for three weeks
of emergency leave. He joined Lee, Ali, Nabil Khan 'O7 and
neighbor Sandy Pileggi, who went to Rep. Curt Weldon's
office in Upper Darby to present their proposal. "Weldon's
assistant was very helpful... he helped us shape our question so we could make a better case for ourselves," Lee
said. "He called people on the Hill that he knew, to see if
their requests went through."
Meanwhile, the Alams enlisted the support of various
otherpolitical figures, whom they contacted through connections. Pileggi related Tariq's case to her cousin,
Pennsylvania state Sen. Dominic Pileggi, and an acquain-

tance through friends, United States Sen. Arlen Specter.

The media also delved into the case. The Delaware
County Daily Times published two articles on the Alams'
situation, and reporter Gil Spencer continuously called
the Pentagon for updates on the status of Tariq's discharge.
A few weeks later, Col. German J. Velez, the army's
deputy commander for mobilization, reassigned Tariq to
Fort Dix, N.J., just a two-hour drive from Alam's home in

Media.
"It was the concept of the family team, of everyone coming together, that allowed us to succeed," Tariq said. The
college petition expedited the process and spread awareness of Tariq's situation.

Tariq will complete his assignment at Fort Dix by the
first week of February. Then, he must serve for three more
months at his original ROTC assignment before he may
return to his civilian life.
Meanwhile, the family continues to pray for Alam.
"[She] believes in the next world," Tancredi-Brice said.
"That's why spiritual preparation [for death] is so

important."
Ali agreed: "Religion is in the mind. That, no one can
take from you. Most cancer patients are so lost, but,

because of her faith, she is calm."

Applications jump with new policy at Stanford, Yale
BY ROBBIE COREY-BOULET
BROWN DAILY HERALD (BROWN U.)
(U-WIRE) PROVIDENCE, R.I.

Three

of the nation's top colleges that defied
admission regulations to institute singlechoice early action policies saw big

changes in the number of students applying this year.
Harvard, Stanford and Yale all adopted
early action policies this year that prohibit college applicants from applying
early to other schools but not from applying elsewhere even after they are accepted. Last year, Harvard's early action program permitted students to apply simultaneously to multiple early action
schools. But now Harvard early applicants may not submit any other early
applications, although they are not committed to matriculate at Harvard if
accepted.

The change has caused a significant drop
in early applications to the Harvard class of
2008, with the number of applicants decreas-

4

ing from 7,615 last year to 3,894 this year.
At Stanford and Yale, the new policy
replaced binding early decision policies,
bringing a 62 percent increase in applications to Stanford and a 42 percent increase
to Yale, according to The New York Times.
Harvard expected the policy change to
decrease its applicant pool.
"The people who were applying to multiple other places are no longer in our early
system," said Harvard Director of
Admission
Undergraduate
Marlyn
McGrath Lewis. "So the number of applica-

tions has declined to just about where we
expected it to."
For Stanford and Yale, the change to
single-choice early action marks the end of
binding early decision policies at both
schools, resulting in an increased early
applicant pool for this year.
The possibility for single-choice early
action at Brown is "certainly something
that we're talking about," said Director of
Admission Michael Goldberger.
"Officially, right now those three

schools are out of compliance with
[National
Association
for
College
Admission Counseling], which is the governing body of college admission," he

said.

According to NACAC's current guidelines, an early action school can not limit
the number of early applications submitted
by a student, as long as these are to other
non-binding programs.
Brown will probably not make a decision until NACAC determines whether the
new admission option is acceptable,
Goldberger said.
"I don't think we'll make any changes
this year," he said.
Goldberger said he was satisfied with
Brown's early decision program, saying he
believed such changes do not significantly
affect the end result of the process.
"In the end, I don't think whether
you're early action, early decision or
multiple early action changes who ends
up in your class by more than half a
dozen kids," he said. "Kids are pretty

January 29, 2004

sharp about where they want to go, how

they're going to apply and what the policies are."

Because the applicant pool is smaller
under early decision, more attention can
be given to each application, Goldberger
said.
But critics of early decision say the policy can lead high school seniors to make
premature decisions or limit their financial aid options, according to The New York

Times.
"Stanford's change I think signified a
recognition that binding people early in
their senior year is not good for students,
and wrong, as we believe it is," Lewis
said.

Goldberger said he agrees early deci-

sion may pose problems and is not a commitment to be taken lightly.
"We always advise kids that if they

think that early decision is going to limit
their financial options from other
schools, then they shouldn't apply early,"
he said.

New board chair hopeful for athletics program future
Barbara Mather looks to raise college's profile, increase endowment with donations
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Barbara Mather '65, the new chair of the
Board of Managers, has clear ideas of what
the college should consider important.
High on her list of priorities is revitalizing
the athletic program, followed by keeping
enrollment low and donations high.
Mather, who has served as a member of
the board since 1983, was elected chair in
late November. She had no reservations
about accepting the position. "Spending
more of my time supporting [the college] is,
in my view, one of the best things I could
do," she said.
As chair, Mather must facilitate communication between all committee members and be aware of potential issues the
board might need to address. "You have to
make sure that the board is involved in
these matters, which are significant,"
Mather said.
Mather considers the college's commitment to athletics a very significant issue.
She believes it is an important part of the
college's commitment to overall excellence.
While she is aware of the legacy left by
her predecessor J. Lawrence Shane '56,
whose tenure oversaw the removal of football and wrestling from the athletics program, Mather is not interested in focusing
on the cuts.
"Whenever you have strong disagree-

Your

ments on the board, there are going to be
some residual issues," she said. "I believe
we need to look to the future rather than
going back to the issues of the past, and I
believe that the board is committed to
doing that."

"It's important to keep the
school small in relation to
other institutions. It is one
of the unique attributes
that makes the
school special."
Barbara Mather '65
During her Swarthmore years, Mather
was a member of the basketball and tennis
teams. She knows firsthand the benefits
athletics bring to the overall college experience. She is also aware of the recent controversies concerning Division 111 athletics. "We're in for some interesting times in
that area," she said.
According to Mather, many Division 111
colleges are creating more professional
athletic programs, demanding their athletes to commit heavily to their sports. But
some colleges, especially those with more

T)t*porn« "I want to become

of an academic focus, might not be willing
or able to compete at that level. This could

result in a glaring skill separation between
colleges, even within the Centennial
Conference.
Mather is concerned about the effect a
on
split
like
that would have
Swarthmore's athletic program. She wants
students to be able to play at a level that is

fun and exciting.
"One of the things I know from playing
basketball at the college is that we had
some years where we won very few games.
And while it's fun, it's not as much fun,"
she said.
The board will further discuss these
athletics issues at its next meeting in

February.
"Finding the right balance and making
it a good competitive experience will
require continued monitoring," Mather
said.
Mather is optimistic about the future of
athletics at the college, however, and realizes that changes will need to be made in
the spirit of competition. She believes that
Head Athletic Director Adam Hertz, who
was appointed to his position less than a
year ago, will be a key factor in the revitalization of the college's athletic program.
"He is an important piece of the long-term
solution," she said.
Mather is looking to raise the profile of
the college in more areas than just athlet-

a doctor."

ics, however. She has plans to improve the
school's image in an effort to attract both
prospective students and prospective
donors.
"We have a real jewel here and we'd like
more people to know," she said.
There are, however, no plans to
increase the enrollment. Last September,
Student Council Co-Presidents Anna
Morgan 'O4 and Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5
reported in a reserved-students e-mail that
some board members thought it important
to consider whether the college should
expand enrollment or not. Both Morgan
and Rodriguez were concerned with this,
noting that one of the distinguishing features of the college is its small size relative
to its breadth of curriculum.
Mather agrees wholeheartedly with this
opinion and has no interest in increasing
the size of the school. "It's not on the agenda, and it's not likely to be on the agenda in
the near future," she said. "It's important
to keep the school small in relation to other
institutions. It is one of the unique attributes that makes the school special."
The completion of the capital campaign
is another significant issue for Mather. "If
we are going to remain excellent, we're
going to need the funds to continue to do
that," Mather said. She believes this rededication to raising the remaining funds will
require much more one-on-one communication with prospective donors.

I don't have the

The Johns Hopkins Post-Baccalaureate Premedical
Program prepares college graduates with strong
academic records for acceptance to the best
medical schools by giving them the personal
attention, the necessary science and math courses,
and one-to-one academic advising.

Later, the volunteers stood on street corners at

Hampshire, shouting and holding signs. "There
were Dean supporters and Kucinich supporters
on the same corner as us. People would drive by,
and despite the freezing cold, they would roll
down their windows and shout things like 'John
Kerry is fucking awesome!' One guy rolled down
his window and asked for a sign and all people
from all three campaigns ran out and offered
signs," Roeper said.
Roeper continued to work at a phone bank that
night, calling about 150 people in two hours.
"Many people just said that they weren't
interested, or hung up the phone. But a couple of
people were undecided, and I think I was able to
bring them into the Kerry camp. Some people didn't know that they could register to vote on the
same day as the primaries, and I was glad to give

a

them information about that."
Although the volunteers were able to reach
many voters, their trip had many stumbling
blocks. The trip from Swarthmore to Kerry's
headquarters in Portsmouth, N.H. was a difficult
journey.

"We took the SEPTA to Market East, then a
Chinatown bus to New York City, and then to
Hartford. Tim's dad picked us up and drove us to
Amherst, and we ate dinner at his house there.
Then we borrowed the car and drove to New

Hampshire," Vogel said.
At three in the morning, they arrived at the

Robbins was very sick and was unable to
campaign the next day. In addition to these probelsm, Roeper's car broke down on Sunday.
"We were planning to see [Gen. Wesley] Clark
and [Sen.] Edwards speak on Sunday, and we
wound up watching them speak on TV," Vogel
said. "It was really sad."

"We also had really bad directions the whole
time," Roeper added.
Despite these setbacks, the volunteers enjoyed
being on the forefront of a primary. "There were
people from all over the country there," Roeper

Political science professor Raymond Hopkins

class for some reason or other, such as illness or
a break-up with a significant other. If students
miss class to work on a campaign, and they are
able to pull out analytic nuggets in class, then the
trade-off was probably worth it."
Despite a decreasing trend in activism or political awareness, voter turnout was high in New
Hampshire. Kerry, who also won the lowa caucuses, came in first with 39 percent of the vote.
Former Gov. Howard Dean was second at 26 percent. Clark was in third with 12.4 percent, with
Edwards very closely behind at 12.1 percent. Sen.

Endowment rebounds after two years in the red
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ALEX KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu
After two years of negative growth, the
endowment is again on the rise, according
to the newly released 2002-03 Financial

Status Report.
The market value of the endowment
was $986 million as of June 30, 2003, and
grew by an estimated 7 percent during the
last fiscal year. The additional revenue

will be used as insulation against future
market instability, and it will not affect
budget cuts or tuition increases passed in
the last two years.
An annual survey by the National
Association of College and University
Business Officers found that profits from
university endowments rebounded in 2003,
but the upward swing was not sufficient to
make up for previous years' losses.
Swarthmore is a little above the curve and
has recovered almost fully to the record billion-dollar mark it reached in June 2000.
A forecast in The Chronicle of Higher
Education last December predicted that, in
2004, colleges will "experience financial
pressures that could reduce a hardened
corporate CEO to tears."
Investment revenue that is applied to
the college's budget, known as endowment
spending, is the largest source of income.
At 46 percent of the operating budget, it
tops tuition and fees, which account for
only 43 percent.
The college plans to increase its overall
spending each year at a rate L 5 percent
higher than that of inflation, according to
the report. The guidelines restrict spending from the endowment between 3.75 and

4.75 percent of its total value.
Other than the regular annual spending
increase, budgets and tuition will not be
affected by the rise in endowment. The
Board of Managers approved a 4.5 percent
tuition increase in 2003, identifying the
decrease in endowment as a cause. In 2002,
academic departments were asked twice to
cut their own budgets, requests that were
also justified by the lower endowment.

"Swarthmore has done
very prudently, been
cognizant of market
timing, and executed
strategy accordingly."
Mark Amstutz,
director of investment
"Most institutions I know are doing cost
cutting combined with tuition increases to

help bridge the gap," Treasurer and Vice
President of Finance Sue Welsh told The
Phoenix last year.
The cap on endowment spending now
protects the college from future income
fluctuations, allowing Swarthmore to bet-

ter weather periods of weak returns with a
limited impact on its overall operations.
"One of the most important decisions
that the board makes is taking money out

of the endowment," Welsh said.
Last year, Bryn Mawr

had to announce staff layoffs and salary freezes in response to
budget constraints resulting from poor
investment performance, The Bi-College
News reported in the fall.
Swarthmore's endowment is in an
unusually strong financial position for a
small liberal arts college. It is ranked ninth
in the country in terms of total endowment
per full-time student. This places it just
above Stanford, Williams and Amherst,
with
a significant advantage over
Haverford, which holds the 23rd spot,
according to Cambridge and Associates.
The reason for Swarthmore's strong
position is principally because of a decision in the 1930s that the college would
place its endowment holdings in stocks as
opposed to government bonds. In 1979, the

college further diversified, adding alternative equities such as real estate, timber,
venture capital and private equity.
"Three things have happened over time

prudently, been cognizant of market timing, and executed strategy accordingly," he
said.
A report, presented to the board last
October, showed that most of the college's
endowment revenue is directed toward
keeping class sizes smaller than similar

liberal arts institutions.
"The fact that Swarthmore does have a

Construction projects, such as the
Parrish renovations and new dorm, have
also seen their budgets reduced in the past
three years, but this was primarily due to
smaller-than-expected contributions from
alumni through the capital campaign. A
study conducted last year by the development department showed that many alumni were not sure the college really needed

their help.

"A large number of alumni aren't really

Federal Pell grants may
decrease for students

Public Policy

BY MELISSA BENTON
MICHIGAN DAILY (UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN)
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich.
Congress is debating when to
enact legislation that could affect university students receiving Pell
grants. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the bill
would require a revision of all state tax tables, making about 84,000
students ineligible for federal funding. The tax tables help determine how much is awarded to grant recipients.
The 1992 Higher Education Act Amendments directed the U.S.
Secretary of Education to update the state tax allowance tables by
using income data from the Internal Revenue Service. But the
department did not enforce this bill until this year. Previously,
information from 1988 was used to determine Pell grants. Secretary
of Education Rod Paige said new tax tables wouldn't decrease the
Pell budget.
"President [George W.] Bush and I have made funding Pell
grants one of the administration's highest priorities. We have proposed higher increases in funding for Pell grants than were enacted during the eight years of the previous administration," Paige
said.
He said although changes will be made in funding, "the Pell
grant program is not being cut. It continues to grow, both in funding and number of students who will receive aid."
All college students who apply for financial aid must fill out a
FAFSA form for every year they attend school, where they are
required to list their family's incomes and tax return information. The new tables will take taxes enacted since 1988 into consideration, hence possibly lowering the amount Pell grants can
offer students.
According to a 2003 Congressional Research Service memo, lowincome applicants will not be affected.
"Expected family contributions of a significant number of very
low-income aid applicants will be unaffected by these revisions,
and that many relatively high-income applicants will find their eligibility for federal aid unaffected, although their EFCs may have
risen," the memo said.
The Department of Education estimates that postponing the
required update to the state tax percentages would increase Pell
grant expenditures for the 2004-05 school year by $270 million.

College joins physics center Patriot Act questioned
BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore joined other institutions in a
new center for the study of plasma physics this
fall, allowing for collaboration among scientists
and increased funds for research.
The center focuses on the study of plasmas,
which are hot, ionized gases that make up most
of the matter in the universe.
Through joint work among the institutions,
scientists hope to answer questions about plasma physics using a combinau
tion of laboratory experi-

from the National Science Foundation.
According to the press release, the grant for
the center lasts five years and totals $11.25 mil-

lion.

For the Swarthmore Speromak Experiment
(SSX), Swarthmore will receive about $250,000 of
the funds.

Swarthmore was picked for the project on
May 6, 2003, and began to receive funding in
September, according to Cothran.

Assault of delivery person stalled

across

Monday evening, when Information

Technology Services personnel had already gone home. Blackboard,
the Tri-College's online course management and content-sharing
system, had failed the day before in the midst of a snow storm. In
each case, ITS was able to implement its "after-hours procedures,"
allowing staff to diagnose and at least partially resolve the problems
before the next business day.
"If the same incidents had occurred during regular business
hours, it probably would not have taken so long," Academic
Computing Coordinator Liz Evans said. Guidelines distributed to
student workers last semester, however, meant that ITS had a significantly better response time than before.
"There wasn't a clear procedure until last semester," said Nick
Guerette 'O5, an ITS student manager and dorm technician. Though
there had been an informal understanding that ITS senior staff were
to be contacted at home in the event of an emergency, it was only following an off-hours crisis in the library that the guidelines were set
down and distributed to all campus computer personnel.

"The guidelines have always been in place," Client Services

Manager Robin Jacobsen said. "[But] after last semester, [we were]
trying to improve communication."
"Many of the [student] staff were confused about what to do," student manager Anastasia Kolendo 'O4 said. "We had contact numbers;
we just wanted to let everyone know."

In the event of a critical systems failure when ITS staff are not
present, the first point of contact is the dorm technicians and public
area consultants. When notified, these student workers pass the
information to one of five student managers. These students then
"decide the scope of the problem and inform the appropriate individuals," Jacobsen said. These calls "occur only occasionally, maybe one
call for each two-month period. Last semester, the calls certainly
came more frequently," ITS Director Judy Downing said in an e-mail.
According to the ITS guidelines, critical disruptions include system-wide failures in the telephone system, the campus network, the
mail server, Keyserver, server folders and Blackboard. Problems that
affect the libraries or public safety should be addressed immediately.
Student managers are instructed to contact the professional staff
until 11 p.m. After this point, messages are left with the ITS Help
Desk until the following morning. Some systems can be fixed by the
student consultants themselves.
Though student workers have contact information for aU of the ITS
professional staff, most things go to Jacobsen first. "I prefer to go to
Robin because she would know who to contact better," Kolendo said.
"Student managers have a good sense about how critical the issue
is, so they know when to call us," Jacobsen said. "We would rather

(and stay in the U.S.)

they called than let something go."

Once Jacobsen or the other ITS staff members receive a call, they
evaluate the urgency of the problem. They may elect to wait until the
next day or consult with other ITS personnel.
In the case of Monday's Internet virus, professional computing
staff were able to significantly reduce the impact of the malicious
program by working from their homes. "We usually try to make do
until the morning and then bring people in," Jacobsen said.
Evans said the Blackboard system seemed to be experiencing two
separate problems over the weekend. The first instance, which
occurred in the afternoon, was reported by Kolendo.
The problems were "related to the Web server's load," Evans said,
"[and] were caused by the sudden increase when students returned
from break" and began accessing files on Blackboard. She said settings had to be adjusted to account for this increase in order to prevent the server from crashing.
In the second instance, which occurred later Sunday evening,
Blackboard's database became filled to its limit when the program
stopped deleting files it was serving to users. This was identified and
resolved by ITS staff by the early hours of Monday morning.
The length of the outage was "partly [due to] recognizing what the
problem was, and [partly] fixing it after hours," Evans said. While
the earlier problem had been recognized by Kolendo soon after it
occurred, the second instance "may not have been noticed so quickly," she said.
Because Blackboard is a Tri-College system, Bryn Mawr and
Haverford were affected by the downtime as well. But since the server is physically housed at Swarthmore, "our tech staff responds" in
the event of problems, Evans said. The three colleges collectively
have a computing staff e-mail list over which they highlight and discuss problems on each campus.
"The staff is very dedicated to responding to these things quickly,"
Evans said. According to her, part of the time is spent reacting to the
problem and part of the time is spent making the campus aware of the
problem. According to Jacobsen, plans for the near future include a
publicly-accessible Web site on which members of the community can
view the real-time status of each computer system.

This fall, Bella Liu 'O7 found herself laughing and embarrassed after she
stumbled into tricky linguistic territory. Her mistake: failing to agree on a
definition of the term ''hooking up."
"I was talking to another freshman I had been getting to know during the
first month or so of school, and she mentioned that she had hooked up with
the guy she was currently dating during orientation," Liu said. "It kind of
surprised me that she'd slept with someone she'd only known for four days,
and I didn't judge, but I did make some assumptions about her attitude
towards sex and all that."
The girl told Liu she had encountered a much more casual attitude
toward sex at Swarthmore than at her high school.

'Yeah, I mean, you slept with your boyfriend after being here four
days?' Liu said she responded. "She just looked horrified and then started
laughing. All she'd meant was that they'd kissed once or twice during orientation. She still makes fun of me for that."
Ah, yes, the hookup conversation. From meeting up with an old friend for
a drink to getting it on, Marvin Gaye-style, the definition of a hookup is elusive. Liu is not the only person confused by the term. Jeremy Cristol 'O5 said
that, of the many words used to describe romantic connections, "hooking up"
seems to present the most problems.
"I definitely had the hooking up conversation; I've had it three times in
the past week," Cristol said. "I mean, just a few days ago we were playing
'Never Have I Ever' in the lounge, and someone asked a question about hooking up. There was instantly confusion about what that meant."
For Lissie Jaquette 'O7, "hooking up is when it's random. Making out, as
in 'my boyfriend and I were making out,' has that wonderful backseat-of-acar connotation."
"

"

"I think our parents' generation considered
hooking up to be having sex, and some of us
still stick to that definition."
Alex DeGolia 07
Rebecca Rogers 'O4 resorted to geometry to explain the difference between
making out and hooking up. "Hooking up and making out are like a square
and a rectangle," she said. "A square is a rectangle, yet a rectangle is not a
square. Hooking up always involves making out. However, making out is
usually just above the belt."
Why the variations? Perhaps it is a question of generation: The era of
"heavy petting" has passed, and other labels have come to the forefront, creating confusion. Alex DeGolia 'O7 was a proponent of this theory.
"One thing is that the terms have changed over generations," DeGolia

said. "I think our parents' generation considered hooking up to be having
some of us still stick to that definition, but some of us consider hook-

sex, and

ing up to just be any form of sexual encounter beyond making out."
Cristol said hooking up was the necking of this decade.
"Necking doesn't really exist anymore
it's been replaced by hooking
up," he said. "When someone said necking the other day, I didn't even know
what it meant. I was like, 'You were sucking on her neck for two hours?'
If the appellations of romantic and sexual connections have changed over
the generations, they have also mutated in students' transition from high
"

school to college. If dating in middle school meant looking awkwardly over
at your boyfriend or girlfriend during lunch and giggling, then surely its
meaning changes during college.
Rogers said she had seen such a development

in terminology. "In middle
school and high school, hooking up meant French kissing. As we get older,
the meaning becomes more sexual," she said.
Relationships progress faster at Swarthmore, not only physically but also
emotionally, which is one of the most significant differences between high
school and college dating, Jaquette said.
"At Swat, the bottom rung has been knocked off the natural progression"
of coupledom, she said. 'Hanging out' in high school is the equivalent of
'dating' in college, which means you're seeing each other, and 'dating' here is
synonymous with the high school definition of 'going out'
a more serious,
long-term connection."
going out to dinner
Even the traditional high school practice of dating
and a movie to see if you like each other enough to start a relationship has
changed in the college setting, Jaquette said.
"Here, you just spend time together and hang out on campus a lot,
because on this small campus it's easy to see each other often, and then
you're a couple," Jaquette said.

'An unexpected archive': New exhibit comes to List Gallery
BY CLAIRE RUUD
cruudl@swarthmore.edu
Judith Harold-Steinhauser's
black and white photographic
portraits, in the List Gallery until
Feb. 22, are as captivating as they
are mysterious. Each larger-thanlife face emerges from the shadows of the print like a specter.
Half of each face is focused with

microscopic

Harold-Steinhauser
creates
the simultaneously focused and

blurry effect by combining two
exposures. In the first, her sitter
stays completely still, with the
camera close-up in his or her face.
In the second, Harold-Steinhauser
asks her sitter to move slightly in
one direction at the moment the

camera shutter opens and closes.
She joins these two images togeth-

clarity to reveal
every pore and eyelash. The other

er seamlessly. While the crystallinefocus of the first half of the

partially

portrait encourages scrutiny of
every freckle and eyebrow hair,

half is blurred and distorted. The
partially
focused,
blurred faces create uncanny
half-human, half-ghost creatures.
"An Unexpected Archive:

Photographs by Judith HaroldSteinhauser"
culminates
six
years of work over which HaroldSteinhauser created over 1,000

images of more than 300 people.
Twenty-eight of these portraits
are hanging in the List Gallery

this month. We can only imagine
the overwhelming effect of seeing
the whole archive at once. On the
one hand, Harold-Steinhauser
individuates and celebrates each
sitter with a unique portrait (each
image is printed in editions of
five.) On the other hand, the vast
number of images begins to
eclipse individual identities in a

sea of nameless faces. She rein-

forces this effect by blurring parts
of the faces to obscure the features of the sitters and by titling
each portrait with only the sitter's initials.

the indistinctness of the second
half frustrates attempts to see
details or pin down identity.
The namelessness, haziness
and rhythmically repetitive quantity of the portraits left me frustrated and uneasy. Only one man
out of the 28 in List is smiling.

me. Still, even though I could
identify the person in the picture,
Syd remained mysterious and
otherworldly. The presence of her
portrait made the feeling of her

absence more acute. In this way,
Harold-Steinhauser's technique
seems to capture her camera's
inability to penetrate the souls of
her sitters or to reveal them fully
to her viewers.

light and shadow. Each of her
photos reveals classical beauty in
the sitter through the rhyming of
shapes, curves and lines. She deft-

ly plays with light and shadow to
sculpt, obscure and reveal features. Her attention to surface
textures and the gleaming, glinting and dappling of light over
them creates stimulating patterns

and tactile surfaces. The photos
are enticing and beautiful, making the elusiveness of the sitters

even more compelling. Twentyeight photographs are barely
enough to sink into the reflective
cadence of the archive. The exhi-

bition only whetted my appetite
to wander through more halls
filled with Harold-Steinhauser's
phantoms.

Finding greatness in the mediocre performer
It was in 1926 that the suave Savoy Big
Five started playing at the Savoy
Ballroom at South Park and Kedzie to
attract crowds sick of the brass headaches
from the bands that would play the ballroom. By the time I got around to driving
down to the Augusta Civic Center, they
were called the Harlem Globetrotters, and
they had just won their 1,254th game on a
tour through Rome. In that very game,
Pope John Paul II was
named the seventh honorary globetrotter. He airballed a free throw but was
cheered nonetheless by
those self-titled Roman

start, and we have all unabashedly sung
the timeless verse (word) of the
"Flashlight" encore or its equivalent. We
have all been to a Public Enemy show
when Chuck D couldn't show up because
of a minor traffic violation in Connecticut
that got him nailed for a couple of out
standing warrants. These are the
moments that shape our lives, much like

cotton.
What I'm saying is that
a good show is something

that is performed by a
group of people who are

and shake the hands of the entire population of Palermo filing through the door. I
sat next to a man who had received a double bypass four days earlier at Maine
General and had returned home a night
early to sit in the half-court gym of the
school and have watermelon smashed in
his face by a man standing on a folding
chair beating a plastic folding table covered with fruits and vegetables and toilet
paper pies. After the show we all spent the
$8 for new T-shirts to replace the avocadosoaked rags we were wearing, shook
Gallagher ll's hand again and saw that he
was dead inside. (Later that night, I wrote

a poem.)

All I'm saying is that what I said before
isn't all true; there is another sort of performance that speaks to me only to
announce its greatness. And that is the
show where the performer knows that the
act he or she is conducting is sad and
degrading and the audience is there only
because they have sold the farm to buy
into the act. (This is a turn of phrase I
invented just now that means they don't
understand that they are actually witnessing Gallagher II imitate his twin brother.)
These isolated shows stand out as some of
the finer moments in my life. When the
audience is loving what the bedraggled
twin brother of a well-known but seldom
respected performer is doing on stage,
when all the performer is thinking about
is drinking McCormick's generic alcohol

On this warm April night, the featured

roller-skating karaoke act performed by
an overweight baby-booming (in both
senses of the word), dyed-blondish
woman. She opened with "Born in the

U.S.A." and, by the time we had each had
our fill of the sauce and she had waited

and skated around the thatch-roofed open
air bar for three hours, we had formed a
swaying circle to recite "Proud to Be an
American" while she circled us on her
skates. Someone asked her if she wanted a
drink as she was packing up her karaoke
machine. "Not here," she said. We all
knew Roller Girl just couldn't wait to get
home and pass out in her own sticky bathtub with a glass of Merlot.
In conclusion, any show is good if one
of two parameters is met. The performers
must think they are great, that is either be
great (the Harlem Globetrotters) or possess a completely unjustifiable sense of
self-confidence (George Clinton and his
boys). Or the performer must be self-hating and self-destructive and completely
loved by the uncomprehending audience.

Admissions will gain
more space in the
renovated Parrish,
which will also feature
elevators, larger
mailboxes and an
activities center.

Parrish

will soon undergo renovations to avoid fire
hazards and other risks in a structure that was built
before there were elevators, fire alarms or sprin-

klers. With these changes will come a new student activities

center in the location that is currently the admissions office.
Floor plans show the admissions office will move to the
second and third floors, and a larger post office will be move
to the new student lounge. The renovations should be completed by fall 2005 and will cost $12.5 million, according to
Susan Sayer, project manager.
Parrish's cracking cement stairs and aging wood supports will be replaced with safety and aesthetic improvements in mind, Sayer said. The two sets of stairs in Parrish's
center will be replaced. A wooden staircase will greet those
who enter Parrish via its front porch, while a second set of
fire safety stairs will allow for rapid emergency evacuations.

Steel structural beams will replace outdated wooden ones.

Vice President Larry Schall '75, chair of the renovation
committee, spoke of retaining the distinct "flavor" of
Parrish Hall. Elaborating, Schall mentioned preserving the
historic stone exterior and maintaining the mix ofadministration, admissions, student activities and residential areas
that combine to form a sense of interconnectedness for
which Parrish Hall is known. Parrish Parlours will be unal-

tered by renovations.
Schall likened Parrish Parlours to a living room, whu
comparing the future student lounge to a den. Both will b
open for student use, but the Parlours will maintain the]
formal decour, while the new lounge will be more cont<
porary in design.
To prepare for these improvements, initial demolitio

will begin after this spring's commencement and contim
through September 2005, Sayer said.
Skanska, the construction firm contracted for the Parri;
renovations, will begin with the demolition of the ceme
stair on the east side. Sayer said much of the constructk
will take place during summers to lessen the inconvenien
to people living and working in Parrish.
A face-lift, long overdue
Dean of Admissions Jim Bock '9O believes the planne
Parrish renovations comprise "a serious face-lift long ovei
due." Bock said there is a pressing need for more processiri
space in the admissions office, and the move to the secon
and third floors will alleviate this problem.
Additionally, the admissions office blocks student tram

through the building.
The post office, originally designed for a much smaller
student body of 900 students, will also benefit from additional room after the renovations. After the move, the post
office's space will be 50 percent larger than its current location, Schall said. This will allow for larger mailboxes and
more room for sorting.
Furthermore, Schall spoke on the safety improvements
that are a part of the renovation plans. These include a

and a set of new fire stairs to provide direct
outside access from the fourth floor downward for rapid
sprinkler system

evacuation. Additionally, in order to make Parrish ADA
compliant, elevators will be installed where the two main
stair cases currently rise to the top of Parrish. These elevators will go to the top of the hub in Parrish.
"Once we put elevators in, [Parrish] will be hot real
estate," Director of Residential Life Myrt Westphal said. All
the other reasons for which Westphal cites as being motivation to choose Parrish will remain: its single-sex wings, central location, quiet atmosphere, and historically beautiful
architecture will not be lost in renovation. In fact, while its
single sex environment is a disincentive for some, Westphal
believes that after renovations, "people will pick into

Parrish despite [its being] single sex."
In the meantime, the renovations will result in the loss of

tional 75 beds in the fall.

Relocating during renovations
The Parrish renovation will involve some temporary
relocations. The admissions office will move to 3 and 5
Whittier Place, where the math department is currently
located. This move will take place when the math department's permanent home in the Science Center is completed.
WSRN will temporarily move to Parrish third north.
Three development offices, News and Information,
Alumni Relations and Publications will permanently be
moving to Sproul, currently the home of the computer science department.
Maureen Plummer, office manager of admissions, said
she was anxious about the sheer volume of materials to be
moved
furniture, thousands of applications and catalogues
and the difficulty in re-adjusting to a new space.
Sayer said the Parrish renovations were scaled down
from an initially larger scope due to financial pressure.
Renovation to the wings of the building, initially part of the
renovation plan, will be delayed indefinitely.

The fourth floor of Parrish will
remain mostly untouched by the

Mona Lisa, back in the kitchen
BY EVA HOLMAN
eholman2@swarthmore.edu
At first, "Mona Lisa Smile" seemed like

it was going to be a "Dead Poets Society"
for women. The formula fit: An idealistic
new teacher named Katherine Watson
(Julia Roberts) dreams of releasing her
students from the shackles of their conformist education. Meanwhile, close-ups of
the school's magnificent architecture
taunt viewers with the realization that
their own campuses look like abandoned
warehouses in comparison.
"Mona Lisa Smile" previews were

packed with images of students bonding

with each other and their teachers, situated
in the idyllic fall setting of the Wellesley
campus. Some commercials even showed
students
mischievously
inducting
Katherine into a secret society. Sound familiar? But, halfway through the movie, the
plot dissolves from the rewards of rebelling
against the educational Old Girls Club to
the uninspiring message that women can
have it all but only if they have their man.
It is too bad that the exhilarating tension between Katherine and her students
was confined to a few classroom scenes at
the movie's beginning. Sparks fly when the
students, incensed that they have to learn
art from an unmarried California native,
ruin Katherine's lesson plans for the entire
semester by reading the assigned textbook
before the term begins. But when
Katherine uses her lack of a syllabus to
devise a challenging new curriculum, the
girls engage in a level of artistic analysis of
which they never thought themselves capa-

ble. Katherine even encourages her top student, Joan (Julia Stiles), to apply to law
school despite her impending marriage.
Yet it's clear that someone involved in
the research for "Mona Lisa Smile" became
concerned when they discovered that there
were in fact no men attending the allwomen's college. The writers' effort to
make every single woman either involved
with (or pining for) a man is painstaking.
The one queer faculty member, a nurse, is
conveniently widowed and leaves 10 minutes into the movie after being fired for
providing birth control to students.
The overwhelming weight given to each
of the girls' romantic relationships shoves
the issue of conformity to the movie's
fringes. Indeed, the absent men in the
movie are doted on, grieved over and treated like gods. The few men in "Mona Lisa
Smile" who do appear are held to oddly low
standards of behavior. The lone male professor frequently sleeps with his students,
yet his colleague Katherine only teasingly
objects, because it would mean he was
cheating on her. What else can a poor guy
do when he's surrounded by those boycrazy she-wolves?
What confuses me most is why some of
today's most respected artists agreed to be a
part of an ill-disguised fluff movie claiming
to debunk the artistic cannon. Why did
Academy Award-winning actress Marcia
Gay Harden agree to play Nancy Abbey, a
character whose only function was to pine
away over the husband who left her? How
did they recruit Julia Roberts to play a character whose most shocking epiphany is that
white, educated housewives can have it all?

Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal star in "Mona Lisa Smile."
Isn't Maggie Gyllenhaal troubled that her
character, Giselle, isn't developed beyond
her obsession with sleeping with older men
(and that the implication is that it's because

Katherine leaves the school because it
won't let her teach the way she wants. The
students unite in friendship just when you

her parent's divorce left her emotionally
stunted)? And, most of all, why does Julia
Stiles think that speaking with a stiff and
slightly British accent is tantamount to the
way people spoke in the 19505? But I digress.
After spending much of the movie
focused on women's obsessions with men,
in the end the film makes a contrived effort
to celebrate women's independence.

their boyfriends will divide them most.
And they all tearfully bicycle after Julia
Roberts' retreating car wearing identical
uniforms. "Mona Lisa Smile" may eventually tout female camaraderie and independence, but matching costumes after two
hours of romantic angst only make a viewer realize how much more a female "Dead
Poets Society" would have rocked.

SAO celebrates Lunar New Year
BY MELISSA PHRUKSACHART
mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

Over UOO students checked their mailboxes last week

to find small red envelopes inside. The majority of them
probably thought, "What's with the weird candy?" But
the more enlightened Swatties realized the only thing to
say at a time like this was "Kung hei fat choy!"
Sent by the Swarthmore Asian Organization, the
envelopes marked the Lunar New Year in celebration of

the Year of the

Monkey.

Traditionally, married elders give red envelopes
stuffed with money to younger, unmarried family members. When presented, the envelopes and money are
meant to draw good luck and fortune.
"Bachelors who don't get married, even when they're
40, are unpopular with children during Chinese New Year
because they never pay up," said David Zee 'O7, SAO

board member and international student from

Hong

Kong.

Students at Swarthmore have found their own way to
celebrate the holiday away from home. SAO began the festivities by mailing out the envelopes. Inside were a small
piece of candy and an invitation to SAO's Lunar New Year
study break.
The study break, open to all students, featured Chinese
games traditionally played at the New Year. Traditional
snacks like dried fruit, New Year candy, melon seeds,
peanuts, shrimp chips and New Year rice cakes were

served with jasmine and chrysanthemum teas.
Sharpies was decorated that evening, as well. A large
"Happy Lunar New Year" sign was hung, Chinese zodiac
placemats were set on tables, Chinese candies replaced
the peppermints at the top of Sharpies, and traditional
Chinese New Year music was piped throughout the dining
hall.
"I especially liked the placemats," said Maggie Elwell
'O7. "I tried to figure out what my animal was."
The placemats assigned an animal to a cycle of seven
years, attributing certain personality traits to those born
in the years attached to the animal. Those born in the
Year of the Monkey are "clever, skillful and flexible
remarkably inventive and original and can solve the most
difficult problems with ease," according to the zodiac on
the Chinese Cultural Center of San Francisco's Web site
...

(www.c-c-c.org).

Unfortunately, the traditional firecrackers were missing. Candice Cherk 'O7 found her fill in Philadelphia's
Chinatown. During a recent visit, she watched a mini-

parade. "There were lion dances and music that went all
around Chinatown," Cherk said. "[They] stopped by all
the shops to spark the firecrackers. The firecrackers
bring luck to the shops, so every shop had all different
lengths [of firecrackers]. There were some people following this mini-parade and covering their ears each time
the firecrackers went off."

Several Asian cultures celebrate this date as their New
Year, among them Tibetan, Korean and Vietnamese, but

practices vary from culture to culture.
Cantonese people say, "Kung hei fat choy" to mean
"Happy New Year," according to Zee. "[lt] means something like 'Wish you fortune and prosperity'
People
from China usually say [in Mandarin], 'Xin nian quai

le.'

"

Despite the differences, "the New Year is a time of joy,
renewal and celebration," SAO co-president Wendy
Cheung 'O6 said.

Eat yourself sick

Wing Bowl
Like wing bar? Really like wing bar? Not like these guys (and girl) do.
Yes, it's the 12th annual Wing Bowl, that swan song to the great American
tradition of overeating. The challenge: 30 minutes. As many wings as you can.
The 318-lbs. defending champion, Bill "El Wingador" Simmons, ate a record
154 wings in last year's bowl, and will be going for his fourth win in a row.
Facing him will be a most formidible oppponent: a 5' 5", 90-lbs. Korean woman
named Sonya "Black Widow" Thomas. Her record? 134 wings in 12 minutes.
Girl POWER!
For disgust in the morning, head on over to the Wachovia Center at 5 a.m.
tommorrow morning and cheer on the same El Wingador who graced our campus with his massive presence two years ago to host the first (and only) Spike
Glutton Bowl. Or maybe you'll root for Thomas to send the boys back into the
kitchen. However it goes, it should be a gluttonous good time. And you'll be
back in time for class!
Also, there will be a wild Wing Bowl Weigh-in Party at the South Philly Turf
Club from 5 to 9 p.m. tonight, when the contestants will be introduced and
weighed. Bigger isn't always better.

Game starts at 6:25 p.m. on

Empty space
Think what would happen if a space like Beardsley
Computing Center or LPAC Cinema or the Scheuer Room
became unavailablefor longer than a semester: exactly what
hasn't happened during the time the SCCS Media Lounge
has been closed for renovation. There's been almost no disruption to student life at all.
We hate to say it, but whlie SCCS's e-mail and Web hosting Services have become integral to the functioning of our
campus, the Media Lounge as a campus space has, with a
few exceptions, been a dead space. Few aside from SCCS
admins go there; it's hard to think of any student groups that
have done anything with it.
It has some disadvantages built into it: The inconvenient
basement location doesn't help anything, and the relatively
cramped seating in the Oculus video pit is only partly offset
by the easier access to multimedia equipment.
The fault also partly lies with the SCCS itself; after an initial orientation event, they did relatively little to publicize
the Media Lounge as anything more than their server space
during their first year. Despite a recent flyer campaign, the
SCCS still hasn't given the Media Lounge what it needs
most: a series of high-profile events that could draw students
to the space and let them see its potential.
After the renovation, the SCCS leadership should make
use of their fresh start to look for aggressive strategies to
bring themselves and the Media Lounge into campus culture, or the campus will have to wait even longer to get a
return on its expensive investment.

Keep a hard copy
Blackboard is a wonderful thing. It allows us instant
access to all the course documents our professors want us to
have, without having to wait in line or leave the comfort of
our dorms.
However, while Blackboard is convenient, it is not
always reliable. This semester alone we've had a recent rash
of Blackboard outages that seem to have paralyzed some students and prevented them from doing their readings.
Though these outages have been relatively short, students with tight schedules and limited access to computers
have had their access to coursework seriously affected.
In theory, Blackboard going down ought to make students no worse off than they were a few years ago, before
Blackboard. However, it appears many professors have been
overly reliant on Blackboard, finding it easiest to simply
upload documents to Blackboard without providing an adequate supply of hard copies at the McCabe reserves. Even
though professors have packed schedules, knowing that
Blackboard outages happen, there's no excuse for not offering hard-copy alternatives.
Campus policy still dictates that hard copies be available,
and since most students are printing documents early, the
supply of hard copies need not be very large to be enough.

Sex columnists send the wrong message
Dear Editor:

better sex. Granted, it probably can't hurt
but it isn't
necessarily going to help. I have found thatthe key to better partner sex is knowing what you yourself want, how
you like to be touched, etc.,
and communicating with your
partner honestly about it.
Previous experience with a
partner doesn't really enter
into the equation, although it
does help to be with someone
you are comfortable with and
to have a lot of sexual experience with yourself.
I was really disappointed to see the new sex columnists promoting these misguided and misleading ideas
about sex. There are enough misconceptions floating
around in college kids' brains already, and I think the job
of the sex columnist should be to clear a few of those
away instead of reinforcing them.

this unfortunate emphasis of intercourse over all else.

Triangulating states'

Thus it ever was
movements that do not command majority support are always
faced with the quandary of whether to be "pure" or whether to
downplay unpopular parts of their agenda and use language
that voters perceive as less threatening. The latter strategy was
that of Bill Clinton, who called it "triangulation" and used it
extremely effectively during his campaigns. Now, the same
"safe moderate strategy vs. risky purist strategy" debate is rearing its head in an issue dear to my heart
gay rights. Most
mainstream Democrats have come out (no pun intended)
against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which
would ban same-sex marriage everywhere in the country and

even watered-down arrangements like civil
unions and domestic partnerships. The arguments of most FMA
opponents, though, tend to skirt the issue of gay marriage itself.
Rather, those who oppose the amendment have tended to focus
more on how it would infringe on states' rights
a quintespotentially ban

sentially conservative argument. The Human Rights Campaign
recently launched an ad campaign featuring quotes from conservatives who oppose the FMA. At the bottom of the ad, in

letters, one sees the message, "Be Conservative With the
Constitution. Don't Amend It." (See the Jan. 16-22 issue of
Philadelphia Gay News for an article about and copy of the ad.)
In last Thursday's debate between the Democratic presidential candidates, Sen. John Edwards echoed the HRC's sentiment, saying "marriage issues" were "decision[s] that should
be made on a state-by-state basis." The Rev. Al Sharpton,
though, rejected Edwards' argument and argued that gay marriage was an issue of fundamental rights. "The federal government," said Sharpton, "has the obligation to protect all citizens
on a federal level."
So, is Sharpton right? As a matter of principle, his statement is on the money
but what about as a matter of strategy? There can be no doubt that the states' rights argument is
the most effective argument against the FMA; a recent ABC
large

News poll showed that, if the choice is between letting states
decide about marriage and amending the Constitution, a clear
majority favors the states' rights position.
The states' rights argument is not frivolous. It is hypocritical of conservatives to support states' rights in most cases but
amend the Constitution to make sure states do not make progressive changes to their marriage laws. The states' rights
position has a major catch for gay marriage supporters,

though: What if states make conservative changes to their marriage laws? Already, 37 states have passed laws that reinforce a

heterosexual definition of marriage, and more may be on the
way. Ohio, in fact, is likely to be the 38th; the Ohio state Senate
has passed, and the House is expected to pass, a bill that not
only bans gay marriage but also prohibits state agencies from
offering any sort of benefit for unmarried partners, thus closing out one avenue that many gay couples have used to gain
some of the benefits of civil marriage.
So, here I stand, a conflicted gay marriage supporter. On the
one hand, I know that arguing about states' rights will be more
effective in defeating the FMA than will arguing about homosexuality itself. Using the states' rights argument continues to
give me pause, though. If I'm being totally honest with myself,
I have to admit that, if I could make gay marriage legal all
across the country, I'd do it in a second, even though I would
be infringing on states' rights. In addition, what happens when
states decide to use their rights to engage in anti-gay discrimination? Gay marriage advocates should consider these questions very carefully.

Wesley Clark our best choice
BY MATT FIEDLER
mfiedlel@swarthmore.edu
Democrats across the country
are searching for a candidate who
can oust George W. Bush and
reverse his failed policies. Wes
Clark is that candidate.
Wes Clark was born in 1944 in
Chicago. After the death of his
father in 1948, he moved back to
Little Rock, Ark., to be with his
mother's family. At 17, he entered
West Point, where he graduated
first in his class and earned a

Rhodes scholarship.
After two years at Oxford, Clark
served in Vietnam, where he was
shot four times. In the months that
followed, Clark taught himself to
walk without a limp and returned
to national service, rising rapidly
through the ranks.
In 1995, Clark was assigned to
work with President Clinton's
envoy to the Balkans and played a
crucial role in crafting the Dayton
Peace Accords.
Clark was named Supreme
Allied Commander ofNATO in 1997.
While at NATO, Clark urged the
Clinton administration to stop

Serbian forces' brutal crackdown
on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
Though his principled stance cost
him the goodwill of many colleagues at the Pentagon, Clark skillfully led the 19-nation NATO
alliance to victory in Kosovo, allowing more than a million Albanians

to return to their homes.
Having seen the horror of war
firsthand in Vietnam, Bosnia and

Kosovo. Clark understands that
force must be the last resort of a
civilized people. For this reason, he
staunchly opposed

the Bush administration's reckless rush to
war in Iraq.
To deal with the quagmire we
face, Clark has set out a detailed
strategy to restore stability in Iraq
and return control to the Iraqis.
Drawing on his Balkan experience,
he proposes placing the security
mission under NATO and creating
an ad hoc international organization led by a non-American to oversee reconstruction. Further, Clark
advocates the immediate election of
an Iraqi legislature. Clark understands that the best way to win
friends around the world is to grant
them a central role in crafting

policy.

On the domestic front, Clark is
committed to helping struggling
American families make ends meet.

Clark has proposed a tax reform
plan that is more progressive than
that of any other candidate.
Families making under $50,000 a
year would pay no federal income
tax; marginal tax rates on income
over $1,000,000 would increase by
5 percent.
On health care, Clark is equally
progressive. Clark's plan guarantees coverage to children up to the
age of 22. Adults without access to

insurance could purchase coverage
through the plan, which covers
members of Congress.
Because of his background,
Clark can market these progressive
policies to the average American.
Even Karl Rove cannot paint a fourstar general as weak on defense or
hopelessly
idealistic. Further,
Clark's Southern roots put many
Southern states into play, including
Virginia, Tennessee and his home
state of Arkansas.
Ultimately, Clark's inspiring
vision for America's future outshines even his progressive proposals and electoral viability. Clark

sees an America with a transparent
and accountable government, an
America in which everyone tastes
the fruit of the world's largest economy and an America that, instead

of bullying, unites nations behind
efforts to eradicate AIDS, terrorism, hunger and poverty.
Clark's positive vision has
attracted Americans from all backgrounds.

Rep. Charles

Rangel,

Sharon

and former Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern

Board must open living wage meetings
BY ALIX GOULD-WERTH AND CATHY MEALS
agouldwl@swarthmore.eduand
cmealsl@swarthmore.edu

Three years ago, the Swarthmore Living Wage and
a report outlining staff
concerns about wages and respect. Many Swarthmore
staff members still do not earn a living wage and have
difficulty making ends meet, which drives the SLWDC
to push for an affirmative decision on a living wage
before the end of this academic year. We believe it can
and must be done as soon as possible to remedy the discrepancy between the college's social justice principles
and its wage practices.
We remain concerned that the decision-making
process on a living wage is excessively prolonged and
that decision-making bodies at the college often have
not, to date, acted in accord with Swarthmore's principles of consensus and democracy. For instance, the
SLWDC has never been permitted to present to the full
Board of Managers. In September, the board asked student and faculty observers to leave when it discussed
living wage, thus preventing anyone from knowing the
discussion's content. And, unfortunately, there is still
no specific timeline for deciding on a living wage. In
December, the SLWDC wrote to the board requesting a
decision on living wage by its May meeting, yet the
board chose not to respond to the letter and decided to
make a decision no earlier than the fall 2004 semester.
We recognize that the board must educate itself on
the complicated living wage issue, but we believe that
the extensive work of the SLWDC and the Ad Hoc
Committee on a Living Wage allows for a commitment
to a decision this year. Further delay would be unconscionable; Swarthmore must pay staff fairly now.
Therefore, we propose that the board and President
Bloom should decide on a living wage by the time of the
board's May meeting, that all observers should be present for all discussion on living wage, and that the
board's decision on a living wage should be a meeting
open to the entire community. An open and prompt decision process is important to ensure that the administration and board are accountable to the staff, students and
Democracy Campaign issued

January 29, 2004

faculty who will share their input through the Ad Hoc
Committee's community input forums in February.
Indeed, a transparent decision-making process is
also central to the college's commitment to consensus.
We ask: What do students and other members of the college community truly learn when the ongoing process
surrounding a living wage has in part managed to contradict these critical principles? In a meeting with the
SLWDC, President Bloom himself raised the question of
whether a living wage fit into the college's mission. He
drew a distinction between work for social change and
education toward social change leadership, the latter of
which the college aspires toward. Donors to
Swarthmore, he said, are often choosing to finance student education rather than such direct social change
work as implementing a living wage.
But this distinction between social change and education is artificial. Living wage is directly linked to the
college's mission to educate social justice leaders.
Students here learn not simply what is on syllabi; education is a significantly broader, holistic project that
encompasses our daily lives and interactions within the
college and beyond. While our work toward a living
wage has taught us certain lessons about the workings
of power and entrenched inequality, Swarthmore must
commit to fair wages if it wants to teach us that priviindeed, the
leged institutions have the opportunity
to take action for justice within their
responsibility

Finding the true meaning of
tragedy in a world of comedy
We've all heard our local news describe some plane
crash as a "tragedy." Many of us, asked to identify our
"heroes," reply "Mom and Dad" or "Mr. Such-andSuch frommiddle school." These are the worst cliches.
Sophocles' "Oedipus," Shakespeare's "Hamlet," and

Haley's "Autobiography of Malcolm X" are tragedies.
Hercules, Ben Franklin and Marcus Garvey were
heroes. Tragedy and
hero-worship are for
men of magnitude and
women such as Joan
of Arc. Many are destined, but few are
tragic.
One expects the
illiterate and functionally illiterate masses
to speak of tragedy
and heroes thus. But
the liberally educated
literati know better.
Illiteracy is ignorance
TARU TAYLOR
of denotation, a word's
specific literal meanGadfly
ing. The masses lapse
into cliche and connotation, a word's emotional signification, as a matter of course. Literacy is
primarily about denotation, which enables the literati
to see through the haze and confusion, emotions and
hysterias, of connotation. The literate vision of denotation is akin to the Platonic vision of ideal forms.
Like Plato's cave dweller who sees only shadows, the
illiterate sees only connotations. Instead of enlightening the masses with language as a system of truths
and denotations, our literati have miseducated the
masses by creating a system of cliches and connotations called political correctness.
"Slave" denotes the Caucasian of Eastern Europe
and Russia, but he dropped the "e" and became a Slav
after his race came to refer to his having been reduced
to servitude by the Teutons of Germany. "Ghetto"
denotes "neighborhood prison to which Jews were
confined throughout modern Europe." So "Negro"
meaning "Slave" is error. "Negro neighborhood"
meaning "ghetto" is error. To the liberally educated,
etymology (from Greek etymos meaning "true")
trumps error. Denotation trumps connotation. But to
the miseducated, connotation rules. They ignore denotation as mere "semantics." To the miseducated, a
word's current meaning, even if erroneous, is allimportant. They are frozen in the present tense. But
the liberally educated are not frozen in the past tense.
They see every word as an historic entity, even if its
etymology is its unassailable truth.
Etymologies are not necessarily to be found in the
dictionary. The dictionary defines basketball, but to

letter

to

understand the game one must play it or watch it. The
same is true of tragedy and heroism. One must experience Sophocles, Shakespeare or Malcolm X to understand tragedy. One must experience Homer, Livy's
account of Fabius Maximus' salvation of Rome from
Hannibal, or Booker T. Washington's "Up from
Slavery" to understand heroism, which is to understand why "Albert Einstein is my hero" is a literate
statement, but "Dr. Such-and-Such is my hero because
he inspired me to be a physics major" is not a literate

statement.
"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women
merely players." Each player wears a persona (Latin
for "mask"), either the smiling persona of comedy, or
the frowning persona of tragedy, depending on
whether he plays the comedian or the tragedian. On
the North American stage, the smile symbolizes child-

ish silliness and adolescent cynicism. Situation comedies and commercials program the masses to be consumers; meanwhile, television executives and their
Fortune 500 sponsors laugh all the way to their vertically integrated banks. The frown symbolizes the
maturity of childlike seriousness, not the melodrama
of soap opera and sports' "thrill Of victory, agony of
defeat".
To the tragedian, suffering builds character.
Disaster ennobles character. Catastrophe deifies character. The tragedian wonders, "Am I worthy of my suffering?" The hero who is master of his suffering is his
archetype.

The comedian believes in "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." His archetype is the salesman with
a ready smile to whom mankind are a bunch of customers. He believes in sellers and buyers, creditors
and debtors, producers and consumers. To him, everything and everyone has a cash value.
The tragedian believes in heroes and villains,
saints and sinners, martyrs and visionaries. He lives
his life on the tightrope between good and evil, triumph and disaster, freedom and destiny. His balancing act is called virtue.
The bourgeois comedian wears the sardonic persona of Shylock. To weigh upon his utilitarian scale,
he wants his pound of proletarian flesh. When
weighed upon Osiris's eternal scale, the Pan-African
tragedian wants his heart to weigh light as the
Feather of Justice, for, like the ancient Egyptian, he
wears the tragic persona of Osiris. He pursues not
happiness, for he walks the tightrope of virtue. The
ancient Greeks imitated Dionysus, Apollo, Achilles
and Odysseus. If tragedy, as Aristotle defines it, is "an
imitation of an action that is admirable, complete, and
possesses magnitude," every Pan-African, as he imitates Osiris, Washington, Garvey and Malcolm X, is a

tragedian.

MLK Day a celebration, not a campaign
Dear Editor:
The editorial page's call for the

college to actually celebrate Martin
Luther King Day strikes a chord
from my college days: My friends
and I often groused about how the
fall semester started on Labor Day

and kvetched that laboring on
Labor Day was a funny way to celebrate it! One of the reasons you give
for celebrating MLKD, however,
does not seem entirely Quaker in its
spirit. You say that, "unlike all the
other federal holidays, which blandly promote American patriotism,

Martin Luther King Jr. Day was
created only recently and sends a
much more direct political message. King's message of interracial
cooperation and integration, of

THE PHOENIX

equality and mutual respect, of

courage without violence and
power without force, is today still
attacked from all directions." It
seems to me that this is another
way of saying that there is not as
yet consensus within America
about King's legacy and that you
wish Swarthmore to celebrate
MLKD in a partisan spirit, as part

of an ongoing political war.
If this is what you mean

and I
may be reading too much into your
words
I must disagree. It seems
to me that Swarthmore's place is
not to celebrate King in an avowed
spirit of partisan controversy but to
strive in a spirit of brotherly outreach to help create a national consensus (if it truly does not yet exist)

that honors him. I am not sure
whether Swarthmore would better
achieve such consensus by celebrating or not celebrating MLKD; but
national consensus, not national
polemic, should be Swarthmore's

aim.
In

the

meantime,

perhaps

Swarthmore students could privately celebrate MLKD by reading
about and discussing the life of
Bayard Rustin, the Pennsylvania
Quaker whose counsel helped guide
Martin Luther King to the firm
practice
of
nonviolence.
Celebrating by studying is something of a busman's holiday for
Swarthmore students; still, it would

be a celebration without rancor.

To be a revolutionary

is nothing more than to

groups and elite rulers on a globGardening

"The war is good." "The war is

help them anyway." Rarely
does either side venture to ask, "Why does war happen?"
It seems like a logical question to ask. If you consider yourself
anti-war, it would make much more sense for you to identify and
eliminate the initial cause of war, rather than spend all your
time in a futile fight against the inevitable. (Feb. 15 was the
largest protest of all time, and it didn't stop anything, did it?)
A revolutionary perspective delves beyond the current political ping-pong match to attempt to identify the root causes of
many of the problems that our society faces today. This sort of
questioning often frightens those who live comfortably off the
status quo. The questions themselves might not seem overly radical, but the answers often strike a note offear in reformists and
the elite alike. (I remember when I first began to ask these questions, and I hated the answers, mostly because it meant that most
of the activism I had done in recent months had been more or
less completely ineffective.) As Bishop Helder Camara said,
"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask
why the poor have no food, they call me a communist."
I'm neither a saint nor a communist, and I'm not suggesting
that I have all the answers. I'd love to be able to say, "Capitalism
and authoritarianism are the sole causes ofpoverty and war, and
once we destroy them we will all live in perfect peace and harmony." I acknowledge that the issue is far more complicated than
that. I do, however, propose that there are specific systems and
entities inherent within our economy and our political hierarchy that need war and cannot survive without war.
So where does carpentry fit in to all of this? While I do not
suggest that I have all the answers to the revolutionary questions that I propose here, I will not be so diplomatic as to avoid
the implication of corporate America in many of the problems
that we face today. Corporations like Coca-Cola, Lockheed
Martin and ExxonMobil (several of which Swarthmore invests
in, by the way) not only profit from war, but many of them cannot operate effectively without U.S. military support in the coun-

tries from which they leech their resources.
We live in a country where we are used to nearly everything
being done for us either by corporations or the government. This
where our well-being
particular genre of "welfare capitalism"
often depends on the willingness of these systems to provide us
with the basic necessities of life
gives an extraordinary
amount of power to these entities.
The more things that we can learn to do for ourselves and for
each other, the less we must depend on corporations or the government to do them for us and the less power that they have over
us. Do-it-yourself (DIY) ideology is present in many cultures and
sub-cultures, but at its core it is a revolutionary practice. It is a
way of freeing yourself from chains of corporate dependency.
Consider this: You can make your own clothes in less time than
it would take you to work and make enough money to buy them.
Completely extricating yourself from the system may be impossible, but consider how many things you buy that you could
either make yourself, find or borrow from friends.
In my opinion, the first step toward becoming a revolutionary
is being conscious and careful about how you spend your money.
Could you buy that shirt from a locally owned store rather than
from the sweatshop-run Gap? Can you afford the extra 50 cents
for local, organic milk, rather than the name brand that's probably owned by Phillip Morris? Can you and your friends get
together to cook a meal, rather than eating out? What about
growing some of your own food?
Unanswered questions are far less dangerous than unquestioned answers. I have answers for me, but not for you. All I propose is that you begin to ask the questions. In a society where
thoughts are crammed into sound bites and the education system
is often part of the problem, that in itself is an act of revolution.

Internet changes the face of America's political-cultural wars
BY SAMANTHA CRANE
scranel@swarthmore.edu

The Internet is a great place for contagion of all sorts.
Viruses, ridiculous quizzes, inspirational chain e-mails and
urban myths have always spread on the Internet at an
alarming pace. Recently, however, the Internet has come
into the public eye as a breeding ground for a certain contagious form of political activism.
In the past few months, Salam Pax, the famous Iraqi blogger, published his own book. Dean achieved temporary
"front-runner" status in the Democratic primaries through a
successful Internet grassroots campaign, and Amazon.com
even set up a special page through which shoppers can make
presidential campaign donations online to anyone who
signed up to be on that page, including Lyndon Laßouche
and various "independent" candidates.
When the conservative American Family Association put
a gay marriage poll on its Web site, people on the Internet
who were in favor of gay marriage circulated messages via

mass e-mails, message boards and weblogs, exhorting likeminded readers to vote on the AFA's poll. In only days, such
Internet activists managed to flood the poll, which soon had
registered twice as many respondents in favor of gay marriage than against it. The AFA, unsurprisingly, cancelled the
poll's results within a couple of weeks.
This is the power of the Internet: People with similar
opinions are able to communicate instantaneously with
each other, thus spreading ideas and calls to action at an
impressive rate. Through reading the "blogs" of people who
have similar viewpoints to their own, Internet denizens can
find news articles that are relevant to their pet issues without having to dig through the back pages of more mainstream, corporate news sources. Advertisements that were
deemed "too controversial" to air on broadcast television
can still reach a large audience on the Internet, and pundits
who haven't broken into the mainstream media may still
find a substantial Internet readership.
However, when people are able to settle into niches, they
develop increasingly

different subcultures.

Although

The

Washington Times and The New York Times will give a
reader very different takes on current events, such gaps pale
when compared to the differences in leanings among independent Internet news sources, which are better equipped to
cater to niche demographics. Viewpoints among Americans
are increasingly polarized, and tensions among different
demographics have become more pronounced, causing people with a variety of political viewpoints to declare that a
"culture war" in America is either ongoing or imminent.
The Internet has clearly played a large part in setting the
stage for such a culture war and in providing a kind of virtual battleground. Even better, while one has to pay for a
subscription to those obsolete, bulky "newspapers" and must
watch television at specific times of the day in order to catch
broadcast news shows, the Internet is free for us college students, and most Web sites are available 24-7. So, while the
rest of our campus watches primaries coverage on the dorm
televisions, I'm staying glued to the computer (at least until
November), reading my blogs, forwarding mass e-mails and
nervously looking at online real estate in Canada.

ning a tennis clinic for middle-schoolers
this winter. "I'm working with Joe Alberti

nervous about it," she said.
Robinson attended the program to learn

econlonl@swarthmore.edu
It's not unusual to see Katie Robinson
'O4 hanging around the field house working
on her jump shot. Nobody stops and stares
at Elli Suzuki 'O6 as she warms up for a
game of tennis in the Mullan Center. But
these women recently learned just how
rare these activities were 30 years ago.
Robinson and Suzuki were among 25

more about the life of a coach on and off the

court. "I'm interested in an assistant
coaching job after I graduate. I am not definite about what I want to do. It was great
hearing about the experiences of the

female athletes to attend the fifth annual

Snell-Shillingford Coaching Symposium
held at Gettysburg Jan. 17 to 19. The symposium was the brainchild of Jennifer
Shillingford, alumna of Ursinus and former Athletic Director at Bryn Mawr.
Shillingford was honored by Ursinus with
the prestigious Snell Chair position. Under
her guidance, she developed a program
through which female athletes learn about
coaching and find inspiration for becoming involved in athletics after their own
college careers end.
After Shillingford's two-year tenture as
director of the symposium, Swarthmore
Assistant Athletic Director Karen Borbee,
along with three other women, took over.
"We are carrying the torch now," Borbee
said. "The program is about empowering
women to be coaches and leaders."
Neither Suzuki nor Robinson knew
what to expect from the weekend when
they applied to attend. Suzuki saw the symposium as a chance to learn more about

coaches that were there and what their

paths to coaching careers were like,"

Robinson said.
The two women spoke highly of the
weekend, which included workshops and
lectures about Title IX, the history of
women's athletics, and coaching athletes

with various skils and abilities. Robinson

found the lecture on Title IX by Christine
Grant to be one of the most memorable
events. "I never thought about the fact that
women before us didn't have these opportunities," she said. "Also, you don't hear
too much about college coaching. The lecture was inspirational. I actually sat there
and thought, T want to be like her when I
grow up.'
Grant, described as the leading expert of
Title IX, and women's athletics historian
Charlotte West spoke at length about
women's athletic experiences before the
"

Association for Intercollegiate Athletics

for Women and NCAA. "They were the
women who lived through it and had to
fight for everything we have now," Borbee
said. "They were the women of pre-title

IX."
The lectures highlighted facts concerning the involvement of women coaches in
women's collegiate teams. In 1972, 90 percent of women's college teams were
coached by females, according to "Women
in Intercollegiate Sport," by R. Vivan
Acosta and Linda Jean Carpenter. Since
then, the number of women coaches has
been declining steadily. In 2000, the percentage hit an all-time low of 45.6 percent.
Learning about the history of athletics
wasn't the only topic on the agenda. Much
of the weekend focused on the "how to" and
"what happens when" aspects of coaching.
After the Swarthmore vs. Gettysburg
women's basketball game on Saturday, participants sat down with Garnet women's
basketball coach Adrienne Shibles to discuss her coaching decisions and thoughts
during the game.
The opporunity for athletes to sit down
and actually interact with a full-time coach
is invaluable, Borbee said."Coaching is a
very misunderstood profession," she said.
"I have people ask me, 'What do you do
when you are not in season?' This kind of
education allows people to see what it's
really like."
Thus far, the program has been well
received in the athletic community. Of the

knowledge to their future plans. "I think
it's very important for women to get
involved in coaching. Coaches are some of
the most influential people in my life,"
Robinson said.
"I feel a responsibility now, a need to
promote education about female athletes
and coaches," Suzuki said.
Both the Mid-Atlantic and New England
Small Collegiate Athletic conferences have
plans to adopt a symposium much like the
Snell-Shillingford program. Borbee is
excited about next year's forum. "What we
do is powerful," she said. "We empower

women to be leaders.'
The Centennial Conference female ath-

letes and coaches look forward to another
symposium in the winter of 2005.

Super Bowl picks,

All right, it's finally that time. Time to write the ultimate make

which teams would go to the playoffs. I got eight of the 12 teams

now I think I can justify asking peo

Unfortunately for me, however
all that stuff is irrelevant now. It al
comes down to one game. Make or break. If I get this game wildly
wrong, I'll look even more moronic than when I drove home from my
job at the zoo with the parking brake on. Or when I hung out at the
local Baskin-Robbins for two hours because I had a crush on the gir
that worked there, only to realize I had left my car's lights on, caus
ing me to pretty much sprint out of there mid-conversation. OK, i
might not make me seem as dumb as those lifetime lowlights. But
then again, I'm not an expert on cars, and I certainly don't consider
myself an expert on women. But I do sort of consider myself an
expert on football, having out-picked everyone except Jaworski.
So now, after I've heaped enormous pressure on myself, how do I go
about picking this game? Honestly, I'm not sure, but I'll give it my bes
shot by starting out with the obvious: The Patriots are clearly the huge
favorite. It is up to the Panthers to convince me that they stand a
chance of beating a team that hasn't slowed down since they inexplica
bly lost to Carlton's Redskins in week four.
The pertinent stats and numbers in this match-up mostly favor the
Patriots. The Patriots have the best points allowed defense in the NFL
averaging only 14.9 points allowed per game. They have a better yard
aUowed per game defense than the Panthers as well as a better-run
defense. Offensively, the landscape is a little more even. The Panther
actually have an edge in total yards per game and a much better run
ning game, while New England averages slightly more points and a lo
more passing yards per game. Normally, an offensive statistical break
down like this would make me favor the Panthers. This time, it's dif
ferent. The Patriots, instead of suffering from a lack of a running game
have developed the best short passing game in the league. They use i
so well and so much that their lack of a running game (it's ranked
sixth-worst in the NFL) doesn't really mean anything. The Patriots also
have a huge advantage over Carolina in turnover differential, with a
+l7, compared to the Panthers' -5. The nerdy sabermetric stats avail
able at footballoutsiders.com favor the Patriots even more. From look
ing at these numbers, the Super Bowl is a complete mismatch with the
overall fourth-best team this season (the Pats) playing the overall 18th
best (the Panthers). It hardly seems fair.
But (and there's always a but) aU is not lost for the Panthers. I can
see a few quirks, match-ups and scenarios that play into Carolina'
hands. First off, the Panthers have an extremely good and hard
hitting defensive front four. This means they may be able to get gooc
pressure on Tom Brady without having to blitz, letting the Carolina
linebackers drop back into short passing coverage. The physical nature
of Carolina's defense also means that Brady is at risk of being knocked
out of the game. If the Panthers defense can do it to Donovan McNabb
who may be the physically strongest QB out there, it could easily hap
pen to Tom Brady. The Patriots also have a style of play which tends to
make their games close. Of their 16 wins, only two were by more than
14 points. Meanwhile, the Panthers excel at staying close and finding a
way to win at the end of the game.
So, when all is said and done, who am I picking to win the Super
Bowl? I really want to go with the Panthers. I really, really want to.
love their defensive toughness, their commitment to running the ba]
and their underdog status. Meanwhile, I hate the Patriots, with their
all-around unstoppability, genius coach and golden boy quarterback
who throws 4-yard passes all day. But as much as my heart wants me
to say Carolina, my head and my gut are forcing me to say New
England. Patriots over Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII, by a score o

to move to 11-6 on the season despite the
absence of captain and leading scorer Katie
Robinson 'O4.

Ali Wolff 'O5 knocked down a careerhigh 19 points on 8-of-ll shooting to help
improve Swarthmore's record to 11-6 overall and 6-4 in the Centennial Conference.
Kristen Lee 'O5 added 17 points, and
Radiance Walters 'O6 cleaned the glass on
both ends of the court to total a career-high
17 rebounds on the night.
After jumping out to an early lead, the
Tide fell behind 20-15 after a 12-2 run by the
Bears. The Garnet responded with a 15-2

run of their own that included holding
Ursinus scoreless for eight minutes in the
latter stages of the first half. Swarthmore
took a confident 35-29 lead into halftime.
In the second half, the game quickly
became lopsided as Swarthmore scored 18
of the first 25 points in the final period,
with Wolff tallying nine of her game total
during that same span. While Ursinus
struggled from the floor, the Garnet shot 50
percent in the half including draining four
three-pointers. For the game, the Tide hit

an impressive seven three-pointers on only
13 attempts.
Despite struggling with offensive miscues last week and tying a season-high in
turnovers by giving the ball away 31 times
against Muhlenberg, the Garnet displayed
some adept ball handling against Ursinus.

As a team, they combined for a season-best
24 assists and only 10 turnovers. Forward

Zoey Adams-Deutsch 'O6 dished out a
career-high eight of those assists to lead

the way for Swarthmore.
"We had a great game. It was a total
team effort. People really stepped it up,"
said Robinson, who watched much of the
game from the sidelines, hampered by a
strained calf.

Though Robinson played only five minutes in the game, her presence helped to
keep the team calm during their rough
start. Coach Adrienne Shibles praised the
senior's limited effort. "In the beginning,
we were a little shaky. Katie came in and
settled us down," Shibles said. "She's
playing through a lot of pain. Even giving
just a few minutes meant a lot." Robinson
hopes to be back near 100 percent by
Saturday for the game against Bryn
Mawr.

While the duration of the season is tak-

ing a toll on all the players, coach Shibles
was pleased by everyone's efforts to fight
off exhaustion and work hard all game

long. "What really made me happy was
that they worked through a lot of fatigue,"

sickening, having that would mean QB Eagles would sit on the bench.
The AFC also has its problem with who to start at quarterback, as the elusive Warren Moon is on the squad with Jim Kelly and Dan Marino. My vote
would go to Marino, as his passing speed is tops in the game, an important statistic when playing against a human. When faced with a fourth and 10 in the
game, debate arose over what play to call. Flip said the toss to 80, who would
rumble through the defense for the TD. Tommy claimed an up-top pass to Rice
from Montana would do the trick. With LT roaming the field for the NFC, the
toss to Bo is always a risky play.
Our conversation ended arguing over the All-Pro Tecmo Super Bowl team.
At safety Flip would rightly choose David Fulcher of the Bengals over Ronnie
Lott simply because of his high rating for interceptions, and turnovers win
games. On the D-line Howie Long and The Minister of Defense, Reggie White,
would threaten the quarterback. LT is the undisputable top linebacker, though
Porno for some unknown reason said he would "give it to LT, though Thomas
is pretty nasty." At wide receiver Jerry Rice is tops, followed closely by Art
Monk and Sterling Sharpe. As for QJBs, the end consensus was to have
Cunningham against the human opponent; Bo Jackson leads the way at running back.
So, while you procrastinate your studying this weekend, dust off the old
Nintendo and pop in Tecmo Super Bowl. Memories of your childhood will rush
back to greet you, and you won't be able to pull yourself away from the game.
You'll love every minute of it. That is, until you get to class on Monday and
realize you wasted away your whole weekend playing the best game ever

NES Tecmo Bowl

It s Super Bowl Week, and for the umpteenth year m a row the Eagles
have no role in the week's festivities. Combined with the devastating loss
by Howard Dean (so eloquently quoted above) in New Hampshire and an
abysmal finish by Wesley "I've Never Held Elected Office Before But
Claim I'm Qualified To Be President" Clark, people on this campus are
feeling pretty miserable right about now. Well, for that sole fact I'm feeling pretty good, and this is reason to celebrate. And celebrate I have. No,
not by focusing this article on why Bush will win in November and the
positive economic effects of his tax policies; that column will come later
in the semester. I celebrated by playing the greatest football video game of

naturally, discussing Bo Jackson and how
sick he was as a player and in the video

never can a single defender bring him

The women's swim team, led by Tara Trout, defeated Albright College 133-72 on Jan. 26.

Trout a triple threat
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Led by captain Tara Trout 'O4 and her three
wins, the Garnet Tide women's swimming team
defeated Albright last Wednesday. Trout's triple
victory helped put the Tide ahead of the Lady
Lions by a commanding score of 133-72.
Trout's first victory was the mile, with a
time of 18:49.22. She then went on to win the 200
Butterfly (2:18.59) and the 500 Freestyle (5:31.03).
The mile and the 200 Butterfly marked seasonbest times for Trout.
Other winners for the Garnet Tide included
Patricia Funk 'O6 in the 200 Freestyle (2:01.97),
Melanie Johncilla 'O5 in the 200 IM (2:20.75), and
Michele Horn 'O7 in the 200 Breaststroke
(2:33.24). "We've been doing a lot of training,
especially coming off of our training trip to St.
Croix, so I definitely had a lot of yardage under
my belt that prepared me for the races," Trout
said. "We expected Albright to be a very close
meet, but everyone performed very well and it
wasn't as close as we expected."
The Saturday meet against Drew marked
another victory for the women, and one for the
men as well. Horn helped the Tide win two
events, including the 200 medley relay (1:57.60)
with Funk, Katie Schmidt 'O7, and Kathryn Jantz
'O5, and the 200 IM (2:21.39). Janice Yeo 'O7 swam
a career-best time in 100 Breaststroke, Johncilla
and Jantz each swam season-best times in the
200 Freestyle, and Joanna Ory 'O6 swam seasonbest times in each of her events. For the men,
Anders Talyor 'O7 helped the team to two victories, first in the 200 medley relay (1:46.25) with

Adam Morris 'O6, Michael Auerbach 'O5, and
Jonathan Augat 'O7, and then in the 200 IM with
a time of 2:09.40. Augat also achieved a careerbest time in the 200 Freestyle, while Morris finished with a season-best time in the 50 Freestyle.
Kaena Horowitz 'O6 swam a season-best time in
the 100 Breaststroke, and Wootae Min 'O7 made
his freshman year debut in the 100 Freestyle.
The meets against Albright and Drew
revealed typical post-training trip swims, as
Coach Sue Davis explained. "What we saw at
Albright were good swims. Many of the swimmers were still quite tired from the training
trip. You could see that they were trying, but
their muscles were tired. I know this fatigue will
plague us for at least another week, as their
muscles go through machinations," Davis said.
"[Their times] all depend on the day; some days
they'll feel good and not go anywhere, some days
they'll feel bad and go faster. The resting process

is interesting."

Despite their remaining fatigue from St.
Croix, the team is confident about their upcom-

ing meets and the approaching conference competition. "Basically, after a training trip, we've
been really tired, sore muscles, meet rescheduled, important that we got another meet in so
we could get conference times, people able to
acheive that because of extra non-conference
meet," Funk said. "We have a solid team this
year, and have been getting really prepared for
conferences.

With three more difficult conference meets to go, and our team comraderie, I
think we can pull through."
The team travels to faces off against conference rival Gettysburg on Saturday.

Super Bowls.

Regarding defenders, Flip was not shy about who was the best in the
game, and of all-time: the coke-snorting, hard-hitting Lawrence Taylor.
He's a dominating defender who can pressure the QB, and is fast enough
to get downfield to cover receivers, a crucial trait when playing against a
human opponent. I asked about Ronnie Lott and Porno noted that LT is
faster than Lott, but his choice of top defender would be Howie Long (not
a bad choice, but just goes to show why Pannorfi stinks at video games).
Flip trashed Lott, saying that a good quarterback, or somebody who
knows how to play well, could take advantage, as Ronnie has trouble covering downfield. Tom chimed in with the option of Derrick Thomas, a
stud linebacker who often goes overlooked because his career was tragically cut short.
The best QB in the game caused debate among the three. Porno argued
Randall Cunningham (correction, QB Eagles), but Tom noted how
Montana was absolutely ridiculous. Flip noted the best quarterback
depends on the style of play, and a video game QB is only as good as the
players he's surrounded by. Personally I'd take QB Eagles, as no one I've
ever played against, these three included, has been able to stop my devastating run/pass threat.
The top team in Tecmo Super Bowl was another topic of debate. Flip of
course chose the Giants, as LT's ability to block extra points is pivotal in
close games. I noted the Redskins weren't half bad, as they won the Super
Bowl the year the game was based, and Darrell Green is also capable of
blocking extra points. Ryan and Tommy agreed that San Francisco's
offense is overpowering with the unstoppable Montana-Rice connection,
even through triple coverage. The Bills, with the Kelly-Reed combo and
Thurman in the backfield, are a dark horse, as are the Eagles with the
game-changing Cunningham at the helm, and the Chiefs. But no question
between us four the Giants and 49ers are a step above the rest. As for the
worst team, we agreed the Lions had nothing even with Barry Sanders,
and Flip noted Seattle was atrocious. Tom said of the Colts, "They're real

bad."

We agreed the NFC is the better Pro-Bowl team, but after further
inspection realized the teams are more evenly matched. The Bo Jackson
factor exists for the AFC, and although the Montana-Rice combo is
