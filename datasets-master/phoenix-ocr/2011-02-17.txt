Camera found in Cornell bathroom
BY AARON KRAMER

akramer2@swarthmore.edu

Last Thursday, a student discovered
a digital camera that was actively
recording images inside the handicapped accessible bathroom on the main
floor of Cornell Science Library. The
student noticed an LED light behind the
trash liner and brought it to Dean Myrt

Westphal.
Westphal e-mailed Dean of Students
Liz Braun, Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave and Director of ITS
Gayle Barton about the incident.
Thereafter, Public Safety and ITS began
an investigation by conducting interviews with the Cornell Library staff,

Environmental Services and other witnesses. Public Safety sent out an e-mail
Thursday afternoon to the student body,
faculty and staff informing them of the
incident.
After retrieving the evidence, a
female officer inspected the first few
frames of the recording to see if there
were any indications of who had placed
the camera there. Nothing was found.
"Nobody wanted to look at it,"
Westphal said. "But we did feel that it
should be viewed to see if there was any
information that might indicate who
had done it. We really do care about the
privacy of any of the people that might
have been videoed so we were very careful that people didn't have a view of the
film that was in the camera."
ITS determined that the camera was
recording video, but that the camera did
not have the capability to stream video
online. There is no evidence that the
footage has been distributed.
"In all my years here I've never seen
this before," Westphal said. "It's really
never been on our radar. Going forward,
our main goal is to make sure that this
doesn't happen again, to alert people
that it happened and to let people know
that they should be aware of their surroundings."

The incidence has sparked discussions about student safety across the
campus.
"I thought it was odd, that kind of

thing doesn't happen at this school
You never hear about it," Jake Neely 13,
a student who frequently studies in the
Cornell library, said. But Neely does not
feel that his privacy is threatened. "It
frankly doesn't bother me, and I don't
think it will affect student perceptions."
...

Julie Warech 'l3 agrees. "It hasn't

changed my view ofhow safe I am," she

said.

Westphal does not think this incident
should affect how students perceive
their safety on campus. "We don't want
students to start looking for cameras in
bathrooms, we just want students to use
their common sense. My expectation is
that this was an outlier [and] that this
won't happen again."
"Trust your gut," Redgrave said. "If
you think something's amiss, pay atten...

tion to that and look a little closer."
The investigation is and will remain
open. "If something comes our way,
we'll certainly investigate," Westphal
said. To date, no one has come forward
with any usable information.
"We're still running tests on the camera to look for evidence," Redgrave said,
"But there's a limit to what you can

work with for any crime. Witnesses are
very important, but forensics has limits
to it. There aren't many leads in this

case."
The administration hopes that the
person who placed the camera in the
bathroom will come forward. "If [the
perpetrator is] a member of the college
community[,] the college will do what it
can to help these individuals," Redgrave
said. "But, you can't make promises
because there's victims and we take
their wishes seriously
If the actor
who did this would like to turn him or
herself in, it would be to their advantage

police."

However, the college's priority is
keeping everyone safe. "We're more
interested in stopping it than in catch-

ing the person who did it," Westphal

said.
The college does normally look for
damaging or illegal activity, but the
campus is very open-access, meaning
that visitors to the campus are not
inspected, and Westphal maintains that
they never will be inspected. "This is an
opening and welcoming campus," she
said.
Though this incident has disconcerted the administration and many students, Westphal finds it as a lesson for
the community. "These events always
remind us that we need to pay attention
to our surroundings, we need to care for
each other," she said.
Looking forward, Westphal does not
believe an incident as extreme as this
one will ever happen again.

Swarthmore students both on campus

Services. The Lax Conference is an
entrepreneurial conference that typically includes a talk from a keynote
speaker as well as round-table discussions
between
students
and
Swarthmore alumni who have pursued successful business careers.
Chhabria recalled a conversation
at his round table that included
Prymak and an alumnus named Ali
Usman '9l, who founded an investment firm entitled Pioneer Valley
Capital, which sparked the idea for
the group. "Things [Usman did at
Swarthmore] made us think: 'Oh,
maybe we should start an entrepreneurship club on campus,'" Chhabria
said.
Prymak agreed that an entrepreneurship club would be a good idea.
"After talking with the entrepreneurs
that I met there and participating in
the entrepreneurial panels, and also
just listening to the stories that the
entrepreneurs told and [about] their
achievements in the world, [l] figured
there wasn't enough sense of entrepreneurship on campus," he said.
The focus of the group won't be
solely business entrepreneurs, but
also political entrepreneurs, who are
trailblazers in the creation of public
policy, and social entrepreneurs,
whose work helps to solve civic and
social issues. "It doesn't have to be
people who want to become entrepreneurs

goal for the group would be to organize a fund to support business plans

University of Pennsylvania.
According to Prymak, the club

Student assists creation of talking dictionary

Paul Chung Phoenix Staff

Talking dictionaries, such as the one Teresa Sepulveda developed with Associate Linguistics Professor Harrison, represent a revolutionary way to preserve and protect languages
that are facing extinction.
BY ELI SIEGEL

esiegel2@swarthmore.edu

Theresa Sepulveda 'IL a linguistics major, recently helped
launch a new online talking dic-

an
tionary for Matukar
Austronesian language spoken
in two villages in Papua, New
Guinea with about 430 speakers
through the Living Tongues
Endangered
Institute
for
Languages headed by Associate
Professor of Linguistics K.
David Harrison. The dictionary
includes basic vocabulary, verb
paradigms and sentence structures in Matukar with corresponding
translations
in
English and Tok Pisin, the most
commonly spoken language in
the country.
The Matukar project began
with a trip by Harrison and his
research assistant, Danielle
Mathieu-Reeves, to Papua, New
Guinea where they recorded
long speech segments from
native speakers of Matukar.
These recordings were then
brought back to Swarthmore,
where Sepulveda cut the long
recordings into snippets of single words and transcribed them
so that they could be written
°ut on the website.

THE PHOENIX

Helping the communities
was one of the things that
attracted Sepulveda to the project. "The unique thing about
the website," Sepulveda said,
"is that the [local] community
can keep building on the dictionary by keeping it up to date
and keeping the younger generation interested. The Matukar
community even built a small
hut just for the new computer
and the first time they go on the
Internet, they will be able to see
this dictionary in their language."

The online dictionary for the
Matukar language has given
the language worldwide accessibility, giving it a starting point
to jump into other projects. The
dictionary allowed the community to write the first book ever
in Matukar. In addition, the
National Geographic Enduring
Voices YouTube channel, established by Harrison, prominently displays a video of local
leader and language activist
Rudolph Raward reading this
book.
This dictionary is the sixth
one created by Harrison with
the help of Swarthmore students who have also established
dictionaaies for other endan-

gered languages in "hot spots."
Harrison coined the term in
2006 to describe regions across
the globe that have high levels
of language diversity as well as
language endangerment, but
have low levels of scientific documentation.
"These [online dictionary]
projects," Harrison said, "are a
way of leveraging technology to
help endangered languages stay
alive by giving them a presence
on the Internet." As such, they
can exist indefinitely as a
resource to both scholars worldwide and to those who seek to
revitalize endangered
languages from within the local
community.
"Anyone can approach [the
dictionary] and get information
about the language," said
Jeremy Fahringer 'O6, the proj
ect manager for National
Geographic Enduring Voices
who assisted in the project. "It's
:

making

people's

languages

accessible in a new way on the
Internet."
These endangered languages
often stand against intense
pressure from a dominant
national language in addition to
the continual spread of English.
Frequently, the children of such

February 17, 2011*

local communities cannot speak
the local language, a fact which
troubles community leaders
seeking to preserve the indigenous culture and heritage.
Alfred Lane,
the Vice
Chairman of the Tribal Council
of the Confederated Tribes of
Siletz Indians in Oregon, found
Harrison's online dictionary
created for the Siletz language
very helpful.
"The talking dictionary is
and will be one of the best
resources we have in our struggle to keep Siletz Athabaskan
alive. We are teaching the language in the Siletz Valley
School two full days a week
now, and our young people are
learning faster than I had ever
imagined," Lane wrote to
Harrison in an e-mail.
Having gained considerable
experience from making the
Matukar dictionary, Sepulveda
plans to continue to pursue her
passion for languages by creating another online talking dictionary for the endangered
Huilliche language of Chile.
After graduation, Sepulveda
hopes to enter a career overseas
working with endangered languages.
Harrison is currently work-

ing on a new initiative with the
college's
Information
Technology Services* to make

the online dictionaries more
user friendly. With the help of
Matthew Thomas 'O9 and his
iPhone applications company
BoCoSoft Inc., Harrison has
already created an iPhone app
for the Tuvan language dictionary.

"[The Matukar project] represents a huge leap for the
Matukar language," Harrison

said. "No one had ever heard of
it before and now it's on
YouTube."
"Our Language is as old as
time itself," Lane said on his
tribe's website, "For countless
generations our people lived
out their lives speaking our
words. In all that time our
words were never written. They
were learned by each generation and in turn taught to the
next."
Although language revitalization projects are often over-

looked, these online dictionaries not only provide an invaluable resource to linguists, but
most importantly to their community, creating a new way for
the current generation to pass
down their heritage to the next.

Administration rejects housing co-op for next year
BY NAVIN SABHARWAL

nsabharl@swarthmore.edu

The College will not proceed with
plans for a housing cooperative on campus next year. Although they support
the philosophy behind the idea, the
administration saw logistical barriers
preventing them from approving the coop

next year.

"There are some- facilities issues

[regarding] ADA accessibility] [and]

there are some issues in how it would

impact the lottery [and] meal plan,"

Assistant Dean for Residential Life
Rachel Head said.
In housing co-ops, residents play an
active role in shaping what their lives
look like. "[lt] gives the people who are
in it the opportunity to make it what
they want to make it," Ben Wolcott 'l4, a
member of the student group advocating
a co-op living option, said.
Students living in such a way can
decide to cook meals together, clean the
living space and mandate group meetings. "A lot of dorm life is set up there the
way it's going to be [and] there are certain expectations that are laid out for
you. We create the expectations that we
want," Wolcott said.
At the beginning of last semester,
Head was approached by a group of students who were interested in living in a
cooperative living setting. "We met with
[the group] a whole bunch of times to go
over options, logistical barriers and hur-

dies," she said.
The group planned for the co-op to be
located in Woolman House, an off-campus upperclassmen residence currently
housing around 30 students.
"It's a very different idea compared to
what we normally have, and to make the
change this year is not ideal for us,"
Head said.
Head also discussed the issue of equity: "I think there is also a feeling of how
we ensure parity
with
other
groups," she said.
"I've had stua
dents who are
interested in gender-neutral
themed housing
[and] we have a
group of students
not
who
have
requested
substance free housing." She continued by mention™^^^™™

However, Head insists that the administration ultimately supports the concept. "I don't think that it's not an
option. The more and more we hear
about it I think everybody says that it's a
really great idea [and that] it really
embodies the spirit and values that we
have at Swarthmore."
Wolcott still remains disappointed by
the administration's response. "The
administration

would first need
to address the concerns of each group
equally. "We are coming up with a way
to consistently and fairly provide these
resources."
She also added that much of what is
being accomplished in co-ops is being
accomplished in dorms, referencing a

Food group established hi Ville
Since the summer of 2010, members of the Ville have been planning to create
a Swarthmore Food Sustainability Group. At the end of Jan., this group came
into fruition through initiatives by Andy Rosen, owner of the Swarthmore Co-op.
The main goals of the group are to promote education regarding food sustainability and to take steps toward the creation of a more sustainable campus and
community. Food sustainability, as defined by the group's mission statement, is
the support of local agriculture, organically grown food, ethical and humane
treatment of animals, affordable healthy food and environmentally healthy food.
Its most recent activity was a movie screening of "Ted Ex Manhattan:
Changing the Way We Eat" at the Scott Arboretum's Wister Center on Feb. 12.
Though the group's leader is someone from the Ville, there is still some overlap between members of campus environmental groups and the new group.
Several members of both Earthlust, a green group that promotes sustainability
on campus, and the GoodFood Project (GF), a group focused on food sustainability, have attended meetings and film screenings organized by Rosen.
Formal relations, have not been established between the three groups, but
there have been discussions of collaboration between GF and the new group.
"One of the discussions that happened in our first meeting was [for the Food
Sustainability Group] to collaborate [with Good Food] on gardening. Of course,
that would make sense for the GoodFood Project to collaborate on gardening
between the GoodFood project and gardeners in Swarthmore," Rosen said.
GF members maintain a garden across the street from the President's house
from the spring to the fall and sell the produce to local food Co-ops as well as
Sharpies. Rosen believes that the collaboration between Good Food and the new
Food Sustainability Group to be a sensible idea.
Rosen is also planning two other potential projects for the new group: involving the community in teaching students at the Swarthmore Rutledge School how
to garden and starting a mentoring program- where skilled gardeners from the
Swarthmore community could teach other residents how to garden.
There is yet to be talk of whether relations are to be established between
Earthlust and the new food group and what these might look like.
Camille Robertson 'l3, a member of Earthlust and the Sustainability
Committee who won a Summer Social Action Award from the Lang Center for
Civic and Social Responsibility last year, said that Earthlust would be interested
in hearing about what the Food Sustainbility Group is working on and in talking
about having a potential collaboration between the two groups.
"But as of now, no official introductions have been made and no particular
joint issue or project has been proposed," Robertson said.
The Food Sustainability Group's next meeting will be at Hobbs. One of the
likely topics will be establishing a formal name for the group.

Indeed, students seem to support the
notion of a housing co-op, even if they do
not intend to live there themselves. "I
think its a great idea. It would make a

However, Wolcott is understanding
about the administration's response.
"The administration wants to support
us," he explained. "But they don't want
to make any quick decisions."
Additionally, he remains optimistic
about the future of the co-op and the student group. "I think we'll have something exciting for next year," he said,
"[even though] it's quite possible that it
won't be our ideal."
Possibilities include members blocking in one or two of the lodges on the
meal plan but using meals from Sharpies
to provide meals for the entire campus.
"It would be a good way to show the
administration how it could work,"
Wolcott said.
Pursuing this idea, the student group

Obama, GOP propose Pell Grant cuts
BY KAREN AQUINO

dailypennsylvanian.com,

Feb. 16, 2011

In a sign that the financial downturn that ravaged
the economy has taken no prisoners, a recently proposed federal spending bill outlined heavy cuts to various educational institutions.
Under the proposed spending bill presented by
Republicans in the House of Representatives for the
rest of fiscal year 2011, the Pell Grant program
which gives need-based grant money to low-income
students
would undergo a hefty trim.
According to the text of the bill, the maximum
amount a student would be eligible for would be $4015
in the 2011-2012 award year, down from $5,550, the current maximum amount.
During the 2010 midterm election campaign,
Republicans "made a commitment to cut $lOO billion
in spending, and they're finding now that it's not an
easy thing to do," Penn's Associate Vice President of
Federal Relations Bill Andresen said.
President Barack Obama, who unveiled his budget
proposal for the 2012 fiscal year on Tuesday, takes a
different road.
His administration's "Pell Grant Protection Act"
seeks to stabilize the maximum amount ofPell Grant
money a student can receive, and eventually increase
it to $5,975 by 2017.
Under Obama's proposal, some aspects of the Pell
Grant program
namely, the provisions that allow
students to benefit from the grant year-round and that
provide graduate students with interest subsidies
would be eliminated.

These cuts to the program would help create addimeans."

Black men still underrepresented as teachers
BY TAMARA DEMENT
dailypennsylvanian.com, Feb. 15,

2011

A new initiative set in motion by the
United States Department of Education is
seeking to incentivize more males of color
to become teachers.
In Philadelphia, black male teachers
account for just under 6 percent of all edu-

cators. Nationally,

the statistic drops to 2
percent. Both Walter Palmer, a lecturer in
the School of Social Policy and Practice,
and Chad Lassiter, the president of Black
Men at Penn School of Social Work, Inc.,
feel the University is not fully cognizant of

the severity of Philadelphia's educational
plight. "We are at a pivotal moment,"
Lassiter, a 2001 SP2 graduate and lecturer,
said. "We have a looming crisis and a
dropout rate that impacts black and
Latino males at a higher rate than ever

before."
Both scholars shared the concern that
the movement will not be effective if
teachers are not fully prepared to meet the
challenges facing young males in urban
environments. As a teacher, Palmer said,
you must learn the "impediments" of students who live in areas of high drop-out
rates, poverty and illiteracy in order to
serve as an effective role model.
If this new initiative recruits teachers
based on merely skin color, he said, it will
be nothing more than, a "quick fix."
GSE, he added, could do more to prepare new teachers to meet these challenges on the local level. Independent
tutor and GSE graduate student Daniel
Chinburg disagreed that GSE isn't prepar-

THE PHOENIX

ing future teachers for urban areas.
Chinburg, however, did agree with
Palmer on the point that the initiative
would be a waste of time, and perhaps
even detrimental, if the movement merely

recruited teachers based on skin color.
It would be much more advantageous
to spend government money on the best

instructional methods, he said, "rather
than spend money on promoting a specific
race." Lassiter also shared concern in this
regard but was more optimistic about the
movement's potential to help break the
"school-to-prison pipeline," a pattern that
many young male black students are
caught in.
Teachers, he said, need to be "black in
authenticity," not just skin color. They
must encourage students living in poor
urban environments not to "buy into the
their victimization," he said.
Lassiter also expressed that he'd like to
see the Penn community step outside of
the "ivory tower" attitude and engage
these issues in education more on the
local level. "I don't think all students
grasp it," he said. "I don't see students
coming together with regard to social
change in mass numbers."
Palmer agreed, but said he finds more
fault with administrators than students.
Unfortunately, he explained, on campuses
like Penn, there's usually only a small
"cadre of students at the bottom trying to
drive initiatives."
There needs to be movement from the
top administrators as well as student
organizations in order to create real
impact, he said.

Recent study reports low student emotional health

Emotional Health During Senior Year of High School, by Sex
Indicating "Highest 10%" and "Above Average")

(%

In January, the Higher Education Research Institute at

the University of Californi, Los Angeles published the

results of a survey entitled, "The American Freshman:
National Norms 2010." Based on 200,000 first-time and fulltime students entering four-year colleges nationwide, the
study displayed a broad range of students' ethnicity, educational plans and self-concepts. Among the findings, one
indicated that students' self-perceived emotional health
was at a record low.
Beginning in 1985, the annual freshman survey, is recognized for its large survey pool and long history. Recent
results that were published in 2010 show students' self-ratings of their emotional health at a record low. According to
the study, only 5L9percent of participants rated themselves

as "above average" for emotional health.
Results indicated that 531 percent of incoming students
rely on loans as a part of the financial package to attendcollege. Thus, financial concerns are a major factor in high
stress levels in students. In an article published on Jan. 26,
2011, Tamar Lewin of The New York Times said, "The economy has only added to [college students'] stress, not just
because of financial pressures on their parents but also
because the students are worried about their own college

According to studies performed by HERI, the self-rated emotional health of students entering their first year of college

affected me a lot. My physical ability was much worse."
As a sophomore, Student #2 describes his/her first year
as emotionally traumatic. So, before the second year of
school, the student decided to take a gap year. Similar to
Student #l, Student #2 also attributes his/her difficult transition to personal issues. The student said, "I had just left
my parents after coming out to them as a homosexual.
There were a lot of things going on that left me at a disadvantage." In addition to choosing to take a gap year,
Student #2 resorted to drug use to relieve the stress. "I didn't do well with coping, I ran away and hid through various
addictive substances," he said.

First-year college student and athlete Student #1 found
the adjustment to college quite difficult. As an athlete,
Student #1 practiced up to three hours a day during the
first semester, and spent the remaining time either in class
or studying. On a typical night, the student slept less than
six hours. "My mental state was awful. I was crying all the
time, multiple times a week. I had never been in a state like
that," Student #1 said.
Reflecting upon the first semester, the student attributes
such stress to personal issues. "The hardest was leaving

debt and job prospects when they graduate."
Dr. David Ramirez, Director of Psychological Services
at Swarthmore College, explained that increasing stress
levels arise from an economic context. "Students get
stressed when their families are stressed. More families are
stressed and struggling financially," he said. For Ramirez,
students in each class year are experiencing higher levels
of stress, especially those nearing graduation. He said,
"Seniors are very stressed because of the job market."

pie cognitively and thus, can dampen students' ability to
think. Ramirez said, "The stress, the pressure and intensi-

ty of the workload is real."
Student #2 does not remember interacting with peers
who struggled to adjust to college life. "The other freshmen
seemed to be learning things so much faster [and] that
made me feel inadequate. Rather than try to move past it, I

just shut down," the student said.
In light of Student #2's experience, Professor of
Psychology Barry Schwartz refers to this situation as "pluralistic ignorance." Schwartz explained that such ignorance arises when "everyone assumes something about
other people, and the thing they assume about others is
wrong." So, though a great number of first-years at
Swarthmore may feel quite distressed during the transition to college, if nobody speaks out, then the stress may
feel unique and isolating.
Such "pluralistic ignorance" may indicate how emotional health varies depending upon gender. Schwartz
explained that "pluralistic ignorance" is common among

males "who talk less about internal states." On the other
hand, women are more likely to discover that their emotional issues are common due to their emotionally expressive nature.
In regards to incoming first-years, Ramirez believes

most were mentally exhausted even before the start of college. "My impression is high school has become more
stressful because getting into a selective college has
become more stressful," he said. According to the HERI
survey results, 291 percent of respondents reported feeling
"overwhelmed by all I had to do [as high school seniors],"
This indicates an increase of two percent from 2009.
Similarly, Schwartz attributes stress of incoming freshmen to the pressures of high school, but also notes a
parental component. "If students don't drive themselves
crazy, it's the parents that drive the students crazy," he
said. In particular, for Swarthmore's class of 2014, the pressure for college applications was high considering that
only 16 percent from a pool of 6,040 applicants were accepted to Swarthmore. Scwartz said, "However good you are,
you probably need to be a bit better to gain admittance."
In its report entitled "What's New in High School?
Stress Reduction 101," National Public Radio reported that
a growing number of prep schools have acknowledged the
amount of pressure for students who are preparing for college. To ease student stress, schools such as Beaver
Country Day School in Chestnut Hill, Mass., are choosing
to eliminateAdvanced Placement courses in favor of more

Especially in regards to academic pressure, many students suffer from "pluralistic ignorance," which arises when individuals assume their individual stress is uncommon and unique.

Poetry embodies a form of expression in that it tends

For some poets, poetic expression arisesfrom a desire
to share an idea or emotion with others; for others, their
work becomes a way to organize and reflect on their
thoughts. "I just want people to hear the rhythm in the
words! That's all. Poetry is like music with the beat
dropped. If you're not feeling a poem, then don't force it,

Langston Hughes Project keeps legend's message alive
BY HENRY KIETZMAN

hkietzml@swarthmore.edu

As a man of the Harlem Renaissance,
Langston Hughes is known and remembered as being an innovator of a free-style
poetry that battled the oppressive forces of
his day. His many works emphasize the
importance of social equality by exhibiting
the reality of lower-class AfricanAmerican life during the 1920s to the 19605.
On Wednesday night, the Langston
Hughes Project featuring the Ron
McCurdy Quartet honored his work with
the multimedia performance of "Ask Your

Mama: Twelve Moods for Jazz."
Swarthmore's Vice President of College
and Community Relations Maurice
Eldridge '6l, a Hughes enthusiast, helped
support the event. "The idea of bringing
this performance to campus has been floating around for a couple of years, and would
likely have been submitted as a Cooper
proposal for next year," he said.
Eldridge believes that the nature of the
performance compliments Swarthmore's
celebration of Black History Month.
"Langston Hughes is a major figure of the

Harlem Renaissance as a trenchant
observer of black life with all its ironies in
American society, certainly for the era in
which he lived," he said.
Dr. Ron McCurdy, a distinguished
member of the jazz community, has served
as president for the International
Association for Jazz Education, and currently serves as a board member for Bands
of American and the Los Angeles Jazz
Society. He is also a professor of music at

the University of Southern California.

When asked about his teaching style,
McCurdy explained, "Music is a reflection
of life ... and what you want to do is to try
to discover your own voice, to try and discover what it is you want to say." As a
trumpet player, McCurdy describes his
musical upbringing as a "wide, eclectic
experience as a child because [his] parents
played a lot of music in [his] home." His
influences include musicians such as Earl
Davis, John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald,
Duke Ellington, Beethoven and Brahms.
Fifteen years ago, McCurdy created the
Langston Hughes program when asked to
perform at the opening of the University of
Minnesota's Weisman Art Museum by the
museum's curator.
Though he intended on only performing the program once, the positive
response from the audience encouraged
McCurdy to polish and rehearse the program that he has now performed nationwide. Regarding Hughes' popularity,
McCurdy believes his legendary status
originates from his power as a storyteller
and 'someone who was able to tell stories
about life in such a way that any and
everyone, regardless of educational levels,
could appreciate [them]."
Langston Hughes' message encouraged
all, regardless of race or socioeconomic
class, to strive for 'The American Dream.'
It remains just as relevant today as it was
50 years ago. "[Because of the] inequality
that some people still experience, there is a
need for the message that Langston
Hughes was trying to convey," McCurdy

said.

Although a feature of Swarthmore's
Black History Month celebration,

McCurdy believes Hughes' ideas about
equality are universal. "The message can
be delivered at any time of a year
it
evokes a message of peace, and hope, and
optimism. It's a message that should resonate with all races, not just Black History
Month," he said.
Especially in light of the current conflict in Egypt, McCurdy believes the
notions of peace and optimism resonate
with all who are oppressed.
Since Hughes passed away in 1967, he
never had a chance to perform his poetry
collection "Ask Your Mama: Twelve Moods
for Jazz." Each of the 12 moods reflect
social issues about race in America, but
McCurdy believes the poems also address

believes aids a contemporary audience in

During Wednesday's performance,
McCurdy believes students were "educated

Brazil.
In considering the 12 moods, McCurdy
favors the sixth one, which is named
"Horn of Plenty." In the poem, Hughes
refers to artists Duke Ellington and Louis
Armstrong, among other legends. For the
project, McCurdy transformed the music
and poem into a multimedia performance

that fuses images, spoken word and music.
For the musical element of the project,
McCurdy relies on musical cues that
Hughes himself actually provided.

"As [Hughes] wrote the poem, he said
that he could hear music being played at
various sections of the poem. [Such a musical cue] is simply saying something like 'a
triumphant march' or *a gospel flavor,'"
McCurdy said.
Composers then used these cues to compose music that reflects that particular
emotion. In addition, McCurdy added a

Rewinding back to their Swarthmore days
Alum:

Class: 1984
Major: Engineering

Post Swat Education:

and
MA
Ph.D.
in
Agricultural Economics at
Stanford University

Current Profession: Lead
Development
Rural
Specialist at the World
Bank

From engineering to the World Bank:

Though Munoz graduated Swarthmore as an engineering major, he never actually pursued a career as an engineer. However, working as an economist, Munoz believes
he found that his "engineering degree was very useful, not
only in preparing [him] for grad school but also for having
a very sound and practical and quantitative training and
addressing complex problems."
After working as a consultant for the World Bank on
and off while at graduate school, and then working in academia and conducting research in both the U.S. and his
home country of Bolivia, Munoz returned to working at
the World Bank. "I came to the World Bank because I was
very interested in rural development and land and tenure
issues," Munoz said. Also, he added that during the '9os,
such issues were becoming increasingly more important
and relevant. Currently working as Lead Rural
Development Specialist for the World Bank, Munoz coordinates the World Bank's portfolio of projects related to
land tenure and policy issues in several Latin American
countries. His job involves a combination of offering policy advice to governments, project management and

research.

His current career

struggles and rewards:

When dealing with bureaucracy, Munoz admitted that
entering the working world with an idealistic vision and
the desire to see quick results became a nightmare. "One
always has to remind oneself why one is doing what one
is doing to achieve the goals one has," Munoz said.
Though it may be frustrating, he believes it is important
to "go through the motions." A great deal of what Munoz
learned at Swarthmore regarding social justice and concern for the larger community helped him personally.
"Those are the kind of things that keep you motivated
when you struggle with things such as bureaucracies or
politics," he said.
Munoz feels that the rewards of his work are numerous. "The most significant ones are when I go to the field
and visit the beneficiaries of the project that I spent so
many hours preparing and evaluating and testing and
defending," he said. Particularly during his stay in Recife,
Brazil from 2006-2008, Munoz recalls visiting dozens of
subsistence farmers in a community-driven development
projects he was overseeing. Finally meeting the people
whose lives he was affecting made a huge impact on him.

[but you want to get results]."
Munoz encourages graduates to focus on the human
aspect of everything they do. "How you are viewed and
how [others] view your ideas depends on how you relate
to people
the purity and integrity of an idea is not the
only requisite for that idea to be effective in the world. If
something is written, it has a limited impact. It's when
you use that idea in interactions with people that you see
its effect."

Last thoughts:
"Don't ever forget Swarthmore and be prepared to come
back to it regularly," Munoz said. "Be prepared to come
back to it not just physically, but mentally. You'd be surprised at how often your mind goes back to Swarthmore,
[to ideas, to professors, to the people you met]. So do make
an effort to go back to Swarthmore in the future."

MEDEIROS

Reflections on Swarthmore:

Looking back, Munoz emphasizes the merits of a liberal arts education and the impact it has on his life. "The
world we live in today is extremely complex and having
strong academic training in any field is essential
The
liberal arts education encourages and anchors you in seeing the world from different angles," he said. He noted the
importance of social justice that both the teachings of his
Jesuit high school and Swarthmore instilled in him.
...

Advice for graduates:
"Be prepared to continue learning," Munoz said. "The
fact that you went through an intensive, four-year education doesn't mean you already know a lot of stuff and now
you're going to apply it." Shocked by the number of issues
he was unaware of as a college student, Munoz remembers
his initial experiences as truly eye-opening. "I had no idea
how important compromising in a democratic society is,
and sometimes you have to settle for second best solutions. And that doesn't mean you've given up your ideals

'Community' is absurd, but ultimately fulfilling

For those who read this
column regularly, you are
doubtlessly aware of my
love of "The Vampire
Diaries" and "Fringe"
(which reminds me: for
the love of god, people,
start watching "Fringe!"
The ratings have gone
down, and I can't survive
in a world without this
show!) However, there is a
Alex Israel

close to my heart as these
Pencils Down,

have gotten rather short
shrift in this column. But
no more. Lo and behold,
here is your first "Community" column!
I should note though that I have mentioned
"Community" in this column previously. Last year,
when I named my top new TV shows of 2009,
"Community" and "The Vampire Diaries" were both
on my list, because I am awesome and can immediately spot potential in the form of new shows. (Granted,
the other two shows on my list were "Glee" and
"Flash Forward," so two out of four?)
When I first wrote about "Community," I caught a
lot of flack because it took some time for the show to
really find its footing. However, halfway through its
second season now, "Community" has blossomed into
the best comedy on television with its absurdist
humor, a barrage of pop-culture references, and one of
the best ensembles currently on television. So, I guess
now is the time to say, "I told you so!" (Except, of
course, for the "Glee" and "FlashForward" thing,
which I cannot apologize enough for.)
Now, those of you who don't watch "Community"
(aside from being completely lame, although not as
lame as the people who don't watch "Fringe," because
JUST WATCH IT ALREADY!) might be avoiding the
show because of its absurdist-themed episodes. For
example, the one where the entire campus of the fictional Greendale Community College devolved into a
...

post-apocalyptic wasteland because of a paintball war,
or the one where tainted meat at the Halloween dance
turned everyone into zombies.
Maybe you're not into a show that takes so many
liberties with reality, even though those two episodes,
especially 'Modern Warfare' (the paintball one) are
two of the most laugh-out-loud half-hours on television
that I have ever enjoyed. Even if you aren't into witty,
incisive pop-culture parodies, you should still consider watching "Community." The beautiful thing about
the show is that the simple episodes that lie among the
big-budget craziness are often just as good, if not better than the go-for-broke episodes.
Most of this greatness can be attributed to the rich
cast of characters and the brilliant ensemble that portrays them. "Community" revolves around a sevenperson study group composed of Greendale students. The nominal main character is Jeff ys\
Winger (the hilarious Joel McHale), a lawyer
who gets disbarred for faking his credentials
and must return to school in order to earn a real
degree. The rest of study group is a wacky, multi-cultural, lovable collection of outcasts and weirdos: Abed
(Danny Pudi), the socially awkward pop-culture encyclopedia; Troy (Donald Glover), a former football star
and Abed's best friend; Annie (Alison Brie), the wellendowed, over-achieving control freak; Shirley (Yvette
Nicole Brown), a kindly divorcee who wants to learn
business so she can run a bakery; Britta (Gillian
Jacobs), a defiant feminist, environmentalist and
whatever other -ist she feels that particular week; and
finally, Pierce (Chevy Chase) a grumpy, desperate-tobe-hip bigot who really just wants the younger people
to pay attention to him.
"Community" also benefits from the talents of its
supporting cast, most notably Ken Jeong's Senor
Chang, Jim Rash's Dean Pelton and John Oliver's lan
Duncan. Though these characters are rather 'one-note'
as compared to the central cast, they are all funny as
hell in different ways, and the show's writers are wise
enough not to overuse them to the point where they
become grating.
At the beginning, the cast seems composed ofarchetypes, but one of the brilliant things about

"Community's" writing and acting is the way in which
each character is allowed to grow and deepen. This
allows the skilled actors to embrace the

<*css£

multifaceted nature of their characters, even in
episodes when that particular character isn't the focus.
For example, one of my favorite episodes of the season, 'Mixology Certification,' which takes place in a
bar on Troy's 21st birthday, allows the characters to
break down some of their personal barriers by drinking. For instance, we learn that Abed is willing to lead
a gay man on for an hour just to have someone to talk
to about "Farscape," and that Annie is secretly terrified that the rigid path she has put herself on isn't the
right one.
Though not as blatantly funny as others, this
episode still had some great laughs; mostly, however,
it was a bittersweet meditation on who people really
are beneath their exteriors. Any show that can pull off
an episode like that a month after an episode in which
the characters all become the walking dead is a win in
my book. (Also, one last time: watch "Fringe!" It's not
even on at the same time as "Community," so you can
watch both!)

Patriot Act should not be extended any further
On Monday, the House of Representatives passed a
temporary extension of three provisions of the
Patriot Act. The Senate passed the same bill, H.R. 514,
on Tuesday so that these provisions will be extended
until May 27 of this year, instead of expiring on

February 28.
The vote was a step towards improving or making
permanent three key parts of the Patriot Act. First,
investigators would be allowed to continue with "roving" wiretaps, which can follow an individual across
multiple phone numbers.
Second, the seizure of "any tangible things," such
as business records, will be allowed. The third and
most troubling part of the bill, though, allows investigators to wiretap non-U.S. citizens even when they
are not associated with a terrorist organization.
This "lone wolf' provision is aimed at terrorists or
"agents" who are operating alone, without any association with a foreign government or a terrorist
organization.
Theoretically, investigators could thus wiretap
any non-U.S. citizen, provided there was some sort of
evidence connecting that individual to potential terrorist activity.
Such hostile treatment of foreign nationals holds
serious implications for how U.S. citizens are treated
by foreign governments.

Additionally, there could be significant consequences for the unspoken agreement between countries, primarily liberal democracies, to treat other
nations' citizens with a certain amount of moral cosmopolitanism.
If the U.S. government does not respect the privacy of those who are not U.S. citizens at the same level
as its citizens, how can it expect friendly treatment of
its citizens by other governments?
Though positive liberties ofcitizens of a nation are
not afforded on non-citizens, the negative liberties,
those of privacy, are for the large part- respected
regardless of the citizenship status of an individual.
The "lone wolf' provision could seriously damage
the rights of U.S. citizens abroad. Furthermore, it
seriously violates the view of all individuals as hold-

ing the same moral worth if some are afforded more
privacy than others.

February 17, 201 f

BY PETER GROSS
pgrossl@swarthmore.edu

While Danielle Charette makes a theoretically
sound argument in support of the Supreme Court's
decision in Citizens United v. Federal Elections
Commission, she missed what the practical impact of
the decision was completely.
In her telling of the story, Citizens United freed us
from a system where political speech was unduly
restricted and corporations, which in this world are
merely another way individuals organize themselves,
can jump in on the process like everybody else.
Unfortunately, this is not nearly the whole story.
The first problem with this story is the idea "that a
corporation is merely another way individuals chose to
associate, and thus a corporation
should have an unrestricted ability to
spend whatever they want on political
campaigns.
The decision to spend money on an election does not
rest in the hands of the members of this association,
but instead it exists in the hands of the top executives,
who are often only accountable to an exceedingly
friendly and insular board of directors.
These executives can make a decision to throw their
support behind one candidate or against another, and
can use their considerable corporate resources to do
so. In the pre-Citizens United world, individuals could
express their corporate interests by donating to corporate PACs that represented the company's interests in
the political sphere.
In the Citizens United world, the individuals at the
top have the ability to spend the money of people have
made no decision to support or oppose a given candidate. A supporter of corporate spending in elections
might then say if a person does not support the executive's actions, they can sell their stock or boycott the
company, but this assumes the actions are public.
This question brings me to what is perhaps the
worst part of the Citizens United ruling, the loss of
transparency in our election finance system. In the old
system the big outside groups, like America Coming
Together or Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, were 527
organizations that could accept unlimited donations,
but had to disclose their donors to the public.
Since Citizens United, 501(c)(4) organizations like
Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS have sprung up to take the
place of 5275. The beauty of 501(c)(4) groups is that
these organizations do not have to disclose their
donors.
Corporations, now able to use funds from their general treasury due to Citizens United, are able to anonymously donate huge sums of money to 501(c)(4) organizations to influence elections.
Yes, 501(c)(4)" organizations are not electoral campaigns strictly speaking, but advertisements with the
attack ad ominous music and black and white photos
will have the same effect regardless if the sponsor is a
campaign like Obama for America or Crossroads GPS.
If we are to live in a political society where unlimited
corporate donations are kosher, then we must also
make such activity transparent.
The only reason Target got caught supporting Tom
Emmer in Minnesota is because Minnesota's election
finance laws are among the best in the nation.
Minnesota requires disclosure of donors to campaigns
and independent advocacy organizations, and the
information is easily accessible to any citizen.
If Citizens are going to buy into our political system,
they must know who is financing candidates' campaigns and supporting independent advocacy groups.
Otherwise we risk a disillusioned and lethargic citizenry that believes their voices will be drowned out in
a sea of unmarked and untraceable corporate cash.
Without the people's participation in the democratic
process, any discussion on election finance is ultimately moot.

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Spending cuts should not affect Pell grants
STAFF EDITORIAL
cavalierdaily.com, Feb. 15, 2011
When President Obama released his
2012 budget proposal yesterday, many
constituencies were displeased. This
was to be expected given that the plan
calls for federal spending cuts of SLI
trillion during the next 10 years.
One area that fared better than
most, however, was higher education
the administration made a firm
commitment to preserving the maximum Pell Grant at its current level of
$5,550 per individual per academic
year.

But by calling for the elimination of
Pell Grants to students seeking enrollment in summer classes, as well as
reneging on the government's policy of
loan-interest relief for graduate students, the Obama administration
demonstrated the limitations of its
support for low-income individuals
seeking to take full advantage of the
nation's higher education system.
As policy-makers attempt to compromise on ways to reduce the federal
budget deficit, it is imperative that
both to
funding for financial aid
undergraduate and graduate programs
be spared from cuts and that the

16

government also seek ways to enhance
access to opportunities for intellectual
development outside tjie classroom.
It is, of course, encouraging to see
that the Obama administration did not
capitulate to Republican calls for massive spending cuts to higher education.
The House of Representatives' budget proposal would have slashed the
maximum Pell Grant to $4,705, which
is below its 2008-09 level, and its
authors said they hoped to further curtail the program in the future.
By maintaining level funding for
the maximum Pell Grant, the Obama
administration recognized the longterm economic' growth brought about
by higher levels of educational attainment is more likely to reduce the
deficit through increased revenues
than are haphazard spending cuts to
valuable federal programs.
Through its proposal to discontinue
Pell Grants for students enrolling in
summer classes, however, the Obama
administration missed a chance to
focus on the bigger picture of educational opportunity.
Many college students take summer
classes that often experiment with less
traditional modes of instruction and
offer a more diverse selection of topics.

Summer sessions are also used by
high-achieving students who seek to
graduate early or to take advantage of
dual degree programs, such as those
offered through the University's Frank
Batten School of Leadership and
Public Policy.
The popularity of summer Pell
Grants, which are projected to make
up 14 percent of the program's entire
budget by 2013, suggests there is no
shortage of low-income students looking to partake in these opportunities.
Rather than responding to this
influx in demand by cutting the grants,
the Obama administration should
push to have them expanded.
Similarly, the government's loaninterest subsidy program has been a
boon for cash-strapped students
enrolled in graduate and professional
schools.
With more students seeking those
elevated degrees to succeed in an
increasingly competitive job market,
the government should not hinder
their financial ability to do so by
charging full interest on federal loans.
Beyond expanding access to academic offerings at the nation's colleges
and universities, the government
should also look for ways to subsidize

low-income students who wish to fill
positions as unpaid interns or volunteers.

More than just being valuable on a
resume, these experiences often allow

students to discern where their true
interests lie so they can better structure their academic pursuits.
• Many
low-income students are
unable to pursue these opportunities,
however, because of financial constraints that make it impossible to
afford housing or transportation.
A federal financial aid program similar to the Pell Grant that provided a
living and travel stipend to low-income
students who obtain internships would
alleviate this problem and would give
those individuals an equal opportunity
to participate in organizations for
which they may one day hope to work
full-time.
Calling for increased education
spending at a time of across-the-board
budget cuts may seem politically tonedeaf and unrealistic.
Yet given the Pell Grants' strong
record of boosting graduation rates, it
would be far more foolish not to double
down on the success of financial aid
programs that reduce the budget
deficit by increasing achievement.

to focus that hard work towards a specif-

At Swarthmore, maintaining clarity
has been tough for me. It's really, really
small here and the psychological stuff
that happens while living in a 2,000 person universe has skewed my perspective
and distracted me from my goals. If
there's one thing I'm crystal clear on, it's
that living in the 2,000 person
Swarthmore universe has interfered

To recapture my clarity, I've been brutally honest with myself about what I
want, and also about where I'm open to
possibility. I like determining where I'll
compromise and where I won't. For
example, I'll compromise on what company I choose to intern with this summer; I don'tknow what profession I want

I say brutally honest because deciding

Track

&

field bests season times at Boston Invite

BY RENEE FLORES

rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's and women's
track and field teams traveled to Boston
on Feb. 10-11 to attend the Boston
Valentine Invitational, racing against
both Division I and Division 111 teams.
The Boston Invitational is a pivotal
meet, as members of the team who competed were trying to shave off their season times.
The Invitational hosts hundreds of
runners, including competitors from
Divisions I, II and 111 colleges and universities, such as Bates and Amherst
among the Division 111 schools, and runners who are preparing for Olympic trials, making it the most competitive
indoor meet the Garnet runs. The level
of difficulty is the reason the team takes
only its top runners, providing a chance
to see where they are in training.
"It's a time to run with competition
we don't get to run with; it's different,
and [the team] is put in a field that
moves faster than they've ever run
before," Jacob Phillips 'l3 said. One indicator of the level of competition is the
distance medley relay, won by Division
111 Amherst College over all other competition.

The team agrees that Boston was a

good meet, providing a chance for the
runners to improve their times and
enjoy the reward of running faster than
ever before. "[The Boston Invitational]
is great important because everyone is
running faster than you, and that makes
you want to run faster. It's like they drag
you along with them," Kenyetta Givans
'l2 said.
Kenyetta Givans 'l2 and Rebecca
Hammond 'l3 recorded times in the Top
10 all-time program performances. In the
200 meter dash, Givans finished in 26.83

seconds, a career-best time. This finish

places her sixth all-time in program history. Givans just missed finals in the 60

meter hurdles, finishing with a time of
9.19.
Hammond and junior Stephanie

Beebe recorded season best times in the
800. Hammond and Beebe finished in
times of 2:18.61 and 2:25.26 respectively.
Hammond's finish places her at ninth
all-time at Swarthmore.
Rebecca Painter 'l3 set a personal
best time in the 3,000 meter run, recording a 10:50.56 finish, good enough to
qualify for the ECAC Championships.
Emma Saarel 'l4 finished with a time of
10:56.50 in the 3000 meter run. Hannah
Rose 'l2 finished the 5000 meter run with
a time of 18:39.33.
Givans, Hammond, Beebe and Saarel
completed the distance medley in a time
of 12:44.49. "It helps when you hace your
teammates to help push you in a race.
Running is really a mental thing, and to
hear those voices of people you know
telling you you can do it, it's a great
thing and it really pushes you," Givans
said.
On the men's side, Jacob Phillips 'l3
finished the 5000 meter run in a time of
15:10.44, ranking eighth all-time for the
Swarthmore program. Phillips' finish
this weekend is also 40 seconds faster
than his career-best time.
"I'm really impressed. A lot of people
qualified for ECAC and [recorded] alltime top ten at Swat. People won against
Olympic qualifiers and D I athletes,"
Phillips said in terms of the team's overall impressive performance on Saturday.
Daniel Ly 'l2 recorded a season-best
of 43-04.50 in the triple jump, also reaching 19-03.50 in the long jump. Aidan
DuMont-McCaffery 'l3 finished in a time
of 4:31.73 in the one mile run.
The team heads into a meet at NYU
this Saturday, the team's last meet
before the Centennial Conference Indoor
Championships, geared with the full
team and feeling positive about the
chance to lower their times even more.
"It will be great to see the whole team

run. And it's another chance to get in
fast times before Conferences," Phillips
said. Phillips is confident that the team
will perform well in their individual
events, and hopes to see more times
dropped. "We're strong, we're healthy
and we're ready to race," he said.
Phillips' teammates agree that the
meet against NYU could prove difficult.
"I expect stiff competition, but because
I'm expecting it, I think I'm ready,"
Givans said. The team is looking strong
to head into the next, and final, meet
before the Championships.

"People are peaking at the right time,
no one's burning out, which is good," Ly
said. The team is also suffering fewer
injuries than last year, and everyone is
learning how to take care of their bodies.
With less than two weeks until
Conference
Indoor
Centennial
Championships, the team is hard at
work, hoping to lower their running
times even more and place well. The
men's and women's track and field
teams travel to New York this Saturday
to race against NYU.

Fencing competes against top teams at ND Duals
aapostol@swarthmore.edu

The culture of athletics at
undeniably
Swarthmore,
defined by its long-storied varsity programs, extends well
into the non-varsity student
population. Although they may
not get the glory of the "NCAA"

label, Garnet club sports are a
very real entity on campus,
including the four-year old tradition of Swarthmore fencing.
Established in 2007, the fencing

team recently competed against

one of the country's most elite
fencers, Notre Dame's Fighting
Irish team at the Notre Dame
Duels fon January 28 30.
According to coach Marshal
Davis, who has worked with the
team since its inception, the
Garnet was invited to Notre
Dame after the Fighting Irish
coach saw Garnet captain
Natasha Tonge 'll defeat a competitor from Penn State. "Notre
Dame and Penn State are the
two dominant fencing programs in the U.5.," Davis said.

"Notre Dame was amazing,"

and was a member of the inaugural Swarthmore squad in her

our coach put it, on 'hallowed

collegiate sports." She considered the honor especially
impressive in light of the fact
that the majority of the
Swarthmore team does not

Kevin Buczkowski 13 is the
rare exception. Buczkowski,
who was last year's Southern
Atlantic Conference men's
sabre gold medalist, began fencing at the age of seven. At Notre
Dame, Buczkowski powered
through the weekend with 16
wins against six losses, decisively winning his final match
by a 5-0 score against his Notre
Dame opponent. He concurred
with his coach and with Tonge
about the remarkable nature of
the invitation.
"It was an absolute honor to
be invited to Notre Dame not
only because of their monster
fencing team but [because of]
their impact on NCAA history,"
he said.
Buczkowski praised his
coach for the team's recognition, pointing to Davis' ability
to set novice fencers up for success.

"He takes fencers who have
never fenced before and has
them winning gold medals by
junior or senior year. Our invitation to [Notre Dame] alone is
enough to show that, since we
were one of two club teams
invited while several [NCAA]
schools were turned down."
The team went 4-4 for both
men's and women's at the Notre

NCAA Division I teams in the
process. "[lt] went great," Davis
said. "Swat's women's epee

For the fencers themselves,
the meet was icing on the
proverbial cake, an extrapolation of what makes the club
experience

great. "Fencing at Swat is
one of the most important parts
of my time here, not only
because of the talent and exciting tournaments, but also
because of the awesome members that make up the team,"
Buczkowski said. "We have a
great bunch and it's fun to go on
road trips and compete with
them."
Despite meager exposure, he
does not see the "club" label as
any indication of a lack of legit-

"I don't think a single one of
Swarthmore's NCAA teams can
say that they were invited to a
tournament by a top-ranked
Division I school and beat three
Division I teams," he said,
adding, "and that's what we can
do without recruiting!"

Women's basketball team picks up win, men fall
BY DANIEL DUNCAN
dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

Despite some impressive performances, both the men's and women's basketball
teams suffered losses last weekend to
Franklin & Marshall College. The women
fell 80-66, while the men also lost to the
Diplomats 67-57.
It may have been Senior Day for the
women, but the future of the program led
the offense. After honoring seniors Ceylan
Bodur 'll, Sarah Brajtbord 11, Kathryn

Stockbower 'll and Summer MillerWalfish 'll, Madeline Ross 'l3 scored a
career-high 29 points to lead all scorers in
the game. Katie Lytle 'l4 was all over the
court, getting a double-double with 12
points and 11 rebounds and adding three
steals for good measure.
After a fast start, the Garnet found
themselves down 10 points at the half. For
the first ten minutes of the second half, the
status quo held until Swarthmore went on
a run to get within five points of the
Diplomats. But F&M stayed in control,
going on a 10-2 run of their own to end the

game.
Shooting percentage played a role in

the outcome.
"They shot 65 percent from the field in
the first half and around that in the 2nd
half... they wound up shooting over 56 percent on the game," Ross said. "We played
strong defense, but F&M made great passes finding the open player, and when they
were open for even a short time, they
made their shots."
"Even though we did a better job
defending the drive, F&M really hurt us
on kick outs from drives," Lytle said.
"They had a great shooting day and there
wasn't too much more we could do."
The women (14-10, 10-9 CC) entered the
game tied with the Diplomats for fifth in
the Centennial Conference

spot that receives a playoff berth. The loss
dropped the Garnet one game out of fifth
with two games to play. With no favorable

Jay Kober goes for a jumper in the Garnet's 57-51 loss against McDaniel College last night. Kober scored 12 points for the Garnet

finish among the rest of the Conference to
earn a playoff spot.
Ross believes a playoff spot is within
reach though.
"It is still definitely possible to secure a
spot. At this point, we need to finish our
last two games strong, and ultimately
depend on some other teams in the conference beating the three teams that are bat-

tling for this last spot," she said.

She added, "In no way have we given
up, and the whole team is determined to
continue the season into the postseason."
The Garnet did their part to stay alive
on Wednesday, flying by Centennial
Conference whipping post Bryn Mawr 7344. Bodur, who suffered a career ending
injury against Gettysburg with 999 career
points, began the game with a layup to
record her 1000th career point. She is the
eighth player in Swarthmore history to
accomplish the feat.

and at times looked capable of upsetting
the #2l Diplomats.
Because of a successful zone defense,

the Garnet slowed down F&M's offense
enough to take the lead at several points in
the first half, including 22-20 with four

minutes left in the half. The Diplomats,
though, went on a 14-0 run over the end of

the first half and the beginning of the second to take a lead they would never relinquish.

"Even though we know we're a good
team, we needed to prove to ourselves and
everyone else that we're capable of playing with as talented of a team as F&M is. I
was really proud of how we stuck with
them."
"Really the only difference was the skill
level. They're just a really good team and
proved why they're the favorites to win
the conference again," Gates said. He
pointed out that despite that difference,
the Garnet still "hung in with one of the
