to successful retirement. This was going to

BY LINDA HOU
rhoul@swarthmore.edu

Donald Delson claims that he never had
so much fun losing money as he did with
his investment in the recently, closed
"Bring Your Own Bottle" . restaurant
"Rudi's on Park."
"You have no idea how hard the six of
worked
us in the board of managers
over the past two years to make an elegant
BYOB [for] people in this town," said
Delson, a member of the board of managers
of the Swarthmore Restaurant Partners
LLC that owned Rudi's on Park. "I never
had so much fun losing so much money in
my life."
After only three months in business,
Rudi's recently announced that it was closing until further notice. According to
Delson, the restaurant closed due to the
investors' inability to keep up with the cost
of operation. Nevertheless, the borough
expresses hope for the future, especially
since a new restaurant and new cafe downtown have been doing well.
Rudi's on Park opened last November in
what was once a private residence. The
restaurant offered fine dining, with dinner
entrees ranging from $l6 to $2B, and a
Sunday brunch.
Rudi's on Park is owned by Swarthmore
Restaurant Partners LLC, which is composed of roughly 45 investors. The minimum investment for each investor was
$5,000, and all investors were asked to confirm that they had a substantial income.
Delson said that even before opening
the restaurant, the cost of the restaurant
had to be increased. Although the group
had originally planned ,to lease various
venues, they eventually chose to buy the
residence where Rudi's on Park now
stands. To do so, they asked investors to
loan a proportion of money, which would
be the percentage of ownership they had
on the building.
...

"We had precautions from the beginning.
This is not going to.be your ticket
...

be your fun money," Delson said. "We were
not surprised it wasn't going to be a successful investment, but we were surprised
that it wasn't a successful restaurant."
Yet the $400,000 purchase was only half
of the cost of the building. The group then
spent another $400,000 on landscapes and
renovations. These costs did not decrease
when the restaurant opened.
"Starting when Rudi was working in
the restaurant, and Nancy
his wife
was by his side as hostess. From that point,
we could not bring down the direct line of
costs," Delson said. "We expected to lose
money because I think every new restaurant did that, but the rate at which we were

losing was surprising, and it was not going

down."

Delson said that the group

will sell all

equipment to repay investors, and the
three investors who chose to make loans to
the purchase of the building have hired an
agent to lease the building to another

restaurant.

"Swarthmore Restaurant Partners LLC
will sell its assets (kitchen equipment,
tables and chairs, and tableware) to a
group of investors who made a large loan
to the LLC, and then will liquidate," Delson
said in an e-mail.
When asked how the closing of Rudi's
will affect the town, Town Center
Coordinator Marty Spiegel said that the
loss of the restaurant is definitely a blow to
the downtown area, but that he is hopeful
about the future.
"Any time a business closes, especially
a business as important as a restaurant, it
is important to downtown. Restaurants are
an important aspect of downtown. When
we lose something about that, it's a blow.
There's no question about it," Spiegel said.
Although Spiegel said that the closing
of Rudi's on Park is not a trend, he said
that the economy definitely affects the

downtown area.
"I don't see this as a trend, but let's face
it, in today's business, small businesses

March 18,2010

and restaurants are definitely affected by
this. When people have less money in thenbelt, they find ways to spend less," Spiegel
said.
Spiegel said that he believes that another business will replace Rudi's on Park. He
pointed to the success of the replacement of
Da Vinci's Cafe with Hobbs Coffee, which
opened in the fall.
"My hope is that something good will
come in its place," Spiegel said. "There will
be hopefully another restaurant coming."
Hobbs Coffee replaced Da Vinci's Cafe,
which closed in the spring of 2008. The
owner of Hobbs Coffee was unable to be
contacted by phone for comment.
"Now we have Hobbs, which is a real
benefit to downtown. They certainly have
been very popular with both people from
the borough and students," Spiegel said.

Mediterranean Cuisine owner Azim
Naderpoor said that his restaurant has
been doing well and has been seeing plenty
of customers. While he said that he feels
sorry for Rudi's on Park, Naderpoor said
that he sees a positive future for Aria.
"I'm worried because he's my friend. I
feel sorry because he's been waiting for a
long time to open a nice restaurant. It's a
nice place," Naderpoor said about chef
Rudi.
Unlike Rudi's on Park, Aria was opened
after Naderpoor had spent many years of
providing food to the Swarthmore community. Since moving from Afghanistan to
Philadelphia four years ago, Naderpoor
has been working at a Mediterranean
restaurant, where he sold food at the farmers' market in Swarthmore.
"We have an advantage because I've
worked at the farmers' market for four
years and people know the quality of our
food," Naderpoor said. "I just want more
customers to try my food and its quality.
It's 70 to 80 percent vegetarian so I'm sure
it'll be good for the college kids."

DART pushes forward
new party permit rules

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY JACQUELINE SMALL

In an effort to make party hosts more
responsible and allow more students to
become hosts, the Drug and Alcohol
Resource Team has recently announced
a new party permit policy.
The policy demands that at least one

host of a party attend a DART-run training session, and allows one of the two
hosts of a party to be under the age of 2L
Any underage host must attend a session. In the past, both hosts had to be
over 21 and there were no training sessions.
The policy was implemented at the
beginning of the week.
In the past, there were concerns that
underage students who wanted to throw
a party would
have two 21 year
olds, who were

Requiring hosts to attend a session
means that "the party host knows exactly what they're signing off on," Claire

Olivia Natan Phoenix Staff

Almand, a DART Coordinator, said.
"It's really challenging, especially in
the fall semester, to find two students
over 21 years old," said Leigh Elko 'lO,
the DART member who led these
changes. "This will make hosting, with
and without alcohol, accessible to a
more diverse group of students."
The sessions are administered by the
DART members and are between 15 and
30 minutes long. They cover topics such
as party planning procedures, signs of
alcohol poisoning and how to respond to
it, what to do in the event of a fight
between partygoers, and what to do if
police come.
Jordan Bernhardt 'll, who was one of
only five students to attend the first
training session, said, "It was mostly
common sense things that you'd already
know if you've hosted a party before or
attended your alcohol workshop, but I
suppose it was useful to have it all in
one place. I think theyjdid a pretty good
job."

make a lot of individual considerations
and accommodations for people that
won't be able to attend the big sessions,"
Elko said, adding that DART is doing
this with the intention of helping the
student body.
Elko explained that the scandal surrounding the Halloween party was one
major impetus that led her to work for a
policy change. She claimed that the
rumors that the drinks were spiked with
grain alcohol were false, and that people
were unusually affected because the
drinks contained the standard amount
of alcohol for mixed drinks, while
drinks at Paces usually contain less.
Elko said that she hopes that the
training sessions will also help teach
people proper drink mixing techniques.
The' training session stressed that

Almand said she was pleased with
how the first training session went, but
called it "a test run," and said she had
hoped more people would attend. She
attributed the lack of participation to
the few parties that will be held this
weekend!
The only two general sessions were
held on Tuesday and Wednesday night,
but individuals who want to host parties
and missed the sessions may schedule
private lessons.
"DART as a whole is really willing to

March 18, 2010

people recognize

their boundaries.
"Hosts need to
take a little more
responsibility,"

Elko
said.
"You're not guaranteed a Party
Associate
but
that doesn't let you off the hook for
doing what PAs are supposed to do, such
as checking IDs. That falls on the host."
The sessions emphasized that it is
the responsibility of the hosts to deny
alcohol to underage guests and the visibly intoxicated. They are also required
by state law to post signs that say, "You
must be 21 years of age to possess or consume alcohol in the commonwealth of
PA."
Being convicted of serving alcohol to
minors carries a fine of $l,OOO per underage person. While Almand said that
hosts should keep that in mind, she
added that this has rarely happened in
the past.
Almand added that underage hosts
could face the same penalty if they are
charged, and the DART members suggested that they should avoid all alcoholrelated processes, like buying and serving drinks.
Tom Elverson '75, the College's
Alcohol Education and Intervention
Specialist, said that while he was
unclear about exactly what a host's legal
responsibilities are, as long as underage
hosts do not serve alcohol, they should
be safe from prosecution.
El-Dalati said that he was optimistic
about the change. "[The drive to amend
the policy] started while [Wilcox] was
here, and it was something we continued. It wasn't brought on by her leaving,
and she definitely supported it," he said.
"Wilcox and the Office of Student
Life [have] mostly played a role in taking DART's ideas and relaying them to
the proper authority figures clearing
it by college lawyers and bringing in
guest speakers, such as Dr. Jason
Kilmer, an alcohol researcher," Elko
said.
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal said, "I think [the changes are]
a great innovation the people hosting
the parties will be trained and knowledgeable. It's a step forward in education and safety."

Community heightens response to Chile earthquake
BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu
On Feb. 27, just a month after the
Swarfhmore community gathered in support of those affected by the earthquake in
recorded as
Haiti, another earthquake
the fifth largest in history according to USA
Today
devastated Chile, leaving hundreds of people dead and displacing 15 million more.
Through the efforts of Deivid Rojas 'll
Associate Professor of Spanish Aurora
Camacho de Schmidt and the Dean's Office,
a gathering and moment of silence was
organized for the following Thursday afternoon, March 4 in the Scheuer Room.
Garikai Campbell '9O, acting dean of students, opened the event. "We hope that our
gathering today can serve as a first moment
to come together in reflection, in remembrance, in honor and in service to those
who have suffered loss," he said.
The event was the first effort taken in
mobilizing the college in support of Chile.
This week, various student organizations,
such as Enlace, 1-20 and Coalition for a Free
Haiti, plan to jumpstart their efforts to support those people in Chile who have been

displaced.
During the first days after the earthquake, however, Rojas and Camacho de

Schmidt found the response of the student
body to the earthquake surprising. Nothing
was actually being planned on campus a
couple days after the earthquake struck,

urgency in the same way [as with Haiti]."
"It's hard to bring Chile as much into
the spotlight, because the damages weren't
as bad as Haiti, the death toll wasn't as
high. It's a country that has the capability
of helping itself," said Tanya Rosenblut 'l2,
a member of ENLACE who has family in
Chile and used to live there.
Known as the most earthquake-prone
country in the region, Chile is also considered the most earthquake-prepared country
in Latin America. Buildings were built to
sustain large shocks and children were
exposed to quake drills at young ages. But
with a territhis particular earthquake
tore Chile apart
fying magnitude of 8.8
and led to further aftershocks and
tsunamis, destroying more buildings and
homes. On March 1 Chile's President,
Michelle Bachelet, estimated the death toll
to be around 711
Even though this quake took significantly fewer lives than the one that devastated Haiti, it did not stop the Dean's Office
from taking immediate action, Campbell
said. The Sunday after the earthquake
struck, the deans put together a short list of
students who could have been directly or
indirectly affected by the natural disaster.
"We knew that we wanted to act quickly
to recognize what people were going
through and to acknowledge that we wanted to do something," Campbell said.
Marks-Gold noted that there are no
international students from Chile currently
attending Swarthmore. There were, however, several students who had family and

a stipend of $25,000 for graduating seniors to travel around the

been really fortunate to realize
over my Lang scholarship is that
it's really important for social

Farha Ghannam, Stewart's

"He was really focused on the
issue of city-transportation-environment," she said. "[The Watson

his commitment to enhancing

He's very committed to the idea
that the city shouldsbe open to all

In the summer after his sophomore year, Stewart interned
with Alternatives for Community
and Environment. Through the
organization, he worked with the
T-rider's Union, which advocated
for first-class transportation for
all Boston residents. In his junior
year, he worked on greenRELAY,
which used methods such as
blogging to disseminate information about environmentalism
and connect youths and community groups in the cause.
"Anson's project has made
great strides towards meeting his
goals," said Jennifer Magee, Lang

Student Programs and Training,
in an e-mail. She said that
greenRELAY has "introduced
youth to environmentally conscious practices with which they
may not be familiar, such as

It was through his Lang

Genderfuck, symposium maintain separation
BY ALLISON GANTT

aganttl@swarthmore. edu

Over the past two years, the
Sager Fund has cut ties with both
the Genderfuck party and the
Sager Symposium, which now is
called the Queer Issues symposium.
Though Genderfuck and the
Symposium remain separate,
both groups still strive to celebrate queerness and gender-bending on the Swarthmore campus.
Genderfuck used to be the final

celebration

for the Sager
Symposium, but the two cut ties
prior to the last year's event due
to concern over the party's large
size and past safety issues, said
Alex Weintraub 'll, co-director of
the Genderfuck Party Committee.
"There was lots of sexual
assault, complaints of homophobia and sexism [in years past],"

Weintraub said.
Genderfuck party policy
changes were made last year in
reaction to the safety concerns of
partygoers
and the Sager
Committee.
Ming Cai 'IL co-director of the
Genderfuck Party Committee,
thinks that the changes have
made a difference. "No one [that
we talked to] said that they had an
unsafe, unsettling, or uncomfort-

able experience at the party [last
year]," she said.
Last year was also the first
year the Symposium hosted its
own culminating party. Maria
Kelly 'lO, co-director of the Queer
Issues Symposium, said that this
decision was unrelated to the
Symposium's official split from
Genderfuck. "The separation was
a different issue
The need was
there to have some sort of culminating social event," Kelly said.
Genderfucking occurs at the
symposium party as well, Kelly
said. According to the Urban
...

Dictionary, "genderfucking" is
"deliberately sending mixed messages about ones sex, usually
through ones dress [sic]," emphasizing the idea that gender is a
socially-constructed perception.
While Genderfuck is open to
the campus, the Queer Issues
Symposium's party is open only to
Symposium attendees and speak-

ers.
Richard Sager '73, founder of
the Sager Fund, decided to no
longer sponsor the annual
Symposium after the last year.
"[Sager] has shifted his interest in a different direction," Kelly
said when asked why he no longer
funds the symposium. The Sager
Fund, intended for use on queer
issues on campus, is currently in

the process of reallocation and
still supports a summer internship position, Kelly said.
The Genderfuck party is now

funded through Social Affairs
Committee, while the Symposium
is funded through other sources,
including the Forum for Free
Student
Speech,
Budget
Committee, and other academic
and administrative departments.
The sponsorship changes have
not negatively affected either the
Symposium or the Genderfuck
party. "The Sager Fund only ever
provided a small portion of the
amount necessary to make the
Symposium a reality. The majority of our funding has always come
from campus organizations" Kelly
said in an email.
relationship
Genderfuck's
with SAC has provided outlets for
organized dialogue about the
party with the campus through
fireside chats and conversations

with the Dean's Office, Cai said.
"It made things logistically easier
to have the help of SAC," Cai.
Rebecca Commito 10, co-director of SAC, said that funding from
SAC helps pay for food, drinks,
plates, cups, decorations and student DJs.
The Genderfuck party and the
symposium, though separate pro-

grams, do not have conflicting

goals.
"Everyone
encouraged to go

should be
to both,"

Weintraub said.
The Genderfuck party will be
held this Saturday.
Like last year, the party will
only be open to students on the
Swarthmore campus and those
from other campuses who sign up
and understand the intentions of
the party in advance.
"People from other schools had
heard that 'Oh, this is the party
where there will be lots of girls in
their underwear,' and would just
show up and not really understand the message or the purpose
of the party because they don't go
to Swarthmore," Cai said.
Cai said that the Swarthmoreonly policy was very effective in
addressing this problem. A wristband RSVP system, also continued from last year, aims to

"increase accountability," the
Facebook event said.
"It's supposed to be a safe
space and a
celebration of personal expression of sexuality and
gender," Cai said.
This year's "enchanted forest"
theme is intended to "encourage
dressing up in a way that plays
with gender boundaries as much
as possible.
It's this magical
place where anything can happen.
In terms of mythology and things

like that there's a lot more blur-

ring of the gender roles," Cai said.
"We do want to continue the
tradition of using [Genderfuck] as
this time to experiment [with nonnorms],"

Weintraub said.
The Queer Issues Symposium,
on the other hand, focuses on dia-

logue through various workshops,
panels and events, Kelly said. The
theme of this year's symposium is
the impact of location on queer

initiatives.
Events for the symposium will
include a lecture on "sexual geographies" in Washington DC on
Wednesday and a talk about
Native American identity and
gender on Saturday. A list of all
events can be found on the
Swarthmore website.
The post-symposium party is a
celebration of the "exciting conversations" from the Queer Issues
Symposium week, said Erika
Slaymaker 11, a member of the
Queer Issues symposium team.
Genderfucking occurs at this
party, as well, but the event is a
"small gathering," Kelly said.
"I think [last year] people were
really able to connect with people
who had been at the symposium
and really had a good time
in a
different sort of environment
from the workshops," Kelly said.

PROSE award honors Gergen's work on relationships
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY LILY GOODSPEED
lgoodspl@swarthmore.edu
Ken Gergen's book "Relational Being:
Beyond Self and Community," which has
recently won an Association of American
Publishers PROSE award, is not a traditionally written psychology text.
"It is a compilation of a lot of ideas," said
Gergen, Gil and Frank Mustin Professor
Emeritus of Psychology. "They are meant
to reflect each other, like facets, and inform

each other."
The

Scholarly

(PROSE) annually to scholarly publishers
for, according to the official website,
"bringing attention to distinguished books,
journals, and electronic content in over 40
categories." Gergen's book "Relational
Being: Beyond Self and Community" won
Oxford University Press the 2009
Psychology award.
Gergen's "Relational Being" discusses
the psychology of the self and the role of
relationships in human psychology. It is
written in "strips," or brief pockets of information that span both the aesthetic and the
academic. From poetry by Korean poet Ko
Un to the social theories of Christopher
Lasch, the award-winning book is anything
but standard.
"There is an underlying narrative. I
knew where I was going but I had to discover how to get there," Gergen said. By the
end of the writing process, he said, "I wrote
a critique of the psychological idea that
there is a gulf between people, and you are

fundamentally an autonomous agent.... I'm
arguing that all meaning, reason, God,
emerges out of relationship."
One of Gergen's former students
believes the professor applied that emphasis on relationships not only to his published works but also to his teaching methods. Suzanne Kirschner '7B, Associate professor of psychology at the College of the
Holy Cross, said Gergen was "a wonderfully attentive listener. He doesn't try to
impose his own framework. He's got a generosity of spirit."
Kirschner is an academic colleague and
personal friend of Gergen. In 2005,
Kirschner presented a lecture for a symposium entitled "Constructing Worlds: A
Symposium to Honor Ken Gergen." On
April 22, 2006, Kirschner, among others,
honored Gergen's 40 years of accomplishments at Swarthmore College.
"Professor Gergen would not tell you the
way something was or lecture at you. He
would ask questions that really drew students out. He is very relational in that

way," Kirschner said.
Another speaker at the "Constructing
Worlds" symposium was Yongsoo Park '94,
who today is an independent filmmaker
and novelist living in Harlem, New York.
Park was an English literature major,
stressed that Gergen's influence reached
beyond the psychology department.
Park said that the group of students who
have been affected by Gergen's teaching

"consists not just of professionals in the

heights of his specialty, namely psychology,

but also includes people pursuing all inter-

ests and fields: medicine, linguistics, 1aw....
We have all been impacted by Professor
Gergen and his work. He is a wellspring of
empathy and generosity."
Park lived in an extra room in the
Gergens' house for three years. During that
time, Gergen and Park collaborated on an
independent film about postmodernism.
"All this, and I wasn't even a psychology
major," Park said. "Ken was a true mentor
and teacher, in that he always worked to
create opportunities and stages for his students to shine."
Kirschner agreed that Gergen reached
out to all types of students. "We were all so
different from each other in terms of intellectual matters," he said of the former students speaking at the symposium. "There
would have probably been some disagreements in our beliefs. But we all felt influenced by Ken. I think that really says something about his person."

Professor Andrew Ward, associate professor and chair of the psychology department, also feels similar academic respect
for Kenneth Gergen. "For four decades,
Gergen has been an intellectual force in the
world of psychology. He has a penchant for
questioning assumptions about our field,"
Ward said.
In more personal terms, Ward said that
"Ken Gergen could also be counted on for

organizing gatherings."
Ward also agreed that Gergen was a relational professor, and said, "He was a won-

derful host, and very concerned that the

college's faculty interact. He saw the danger of losing social capital. We don't exist in

isolation, even as intellectuals."
Within "Relational Being" as well,
Professor Gergen made a point to connect
his theory of relational psychology to reallife applications.
"As education comes out of relationships, you must care for the relationship!
Think of the classroom as more dialogical
than intellectuals teaching each other,"

said,
Instead offinal papers, Gergen often had
six to eight students participate in an intellectual dialogue through e-mail messages.
The final conglomeration of arguments was
eventually submitted for grading, as well as
a student-created evaluation of the diaGergen

logue's goals.
"I am very opposed to a top-down curriculum," Gergen said. "We tell you what is
valuable and we give you a stamp of
approval for your life. The students that
come to Swarthmore are passionate and
interesting, and we should nurture it and

be a part of it."

"Relational Being" is just one more step
in Gergen's legacy of social constructionist
psychology works. '"Relational Being' is a
re-conceptualization
of psychology,"
Gergen said. "Psychology is not just in the
mind."
Gergen sees the appearance of the psychology of the relationships in every aspect
of our cultural and personal lives.
"Even Facebook looks like me, me, me
but is actually for you, you, you," he said.
When asked whether the book touched
upon the field of sociology, Gergen said, "It
is a book without a genre. Anyways, even

because Plenary struggled to
reach quorum does not mean the
Honor Code should not be ratified.
Although both Plenary and
the Honor Code are related to
self-governance, they are only
connected by the fact that Honor
Code is ratified through Plenary.
"They're two very different
expressions of self-governance at
Haverford," Haas said. "I don't
think you need to fail the Honor

Code just because Plenary failed
to reach quorum for the entire
eight resolutions."
Schwartz agreed that the termination of Plenary does not

indicate a failure of the Honor
Code. Honor Council Co-Chair
Inez Suhardjo 'lO said she appreciates what those opposing the
ratification have to say, but what
they are doing is misdirected and

not productive.
Both Suhardjo and Schwartz
felt that forcing a Special Plenary
would not have created any
meaningful dialogue about the
Honor Code, and that only a
handful of the same people would

talk.
"Clearly the Honor Code is
not the same thing as Plenary,"
Oakley said. He feels, however,
that the lack of effort on students'
parts to go to Plenary demonstrates that people are not concerned enough about the Honor
Code's continued existence.
"People just don't give a shit,"
he said.

Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" (2010). I
was pleasantly surprised with this movie.
Although I did not leave the theater with
that wow feeling I had after watching
movies such as "Up" (2009) and "Slumdog
Millionaire" (2009), I wasn't too terribly
disappointed that I had to pay $12.50 for it.
There weren't any actors that I thought
could do a better job in it. The girl who
played Alice, Mia Wasikowska, is not very
well known but, in my opinion, did a fine

job amongst a cast of established
Hollywood celebrities. The White Queen,
played by Anne Hathaway ("The Princess
Diaries"), didn't look like she knew what to
do with her hands the whole movie (just
watch and you'll see what I mean; she
looked like something between a germaphobe and a marionette puppet) but she did
get the sickeningly angelic role across.
Once again, Helena Bonham-Carter
("Sweeney Todd"), who played the Red
Queen, outshone Johnny Depp ("Pirates of
the Caribbean"), who played the Mad
Hatter; her characteristic sharpness
brought the perfect amount of humor and
sass to the role. However, I was glad to see
that Johnny Depp wasn't as outrageously
weird (and thus creepy) as he was in
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (2005).
As for all the

(including

CGI-animated critters
the Cheshire Cat and Red

Queen's body), they were a good balance of
cute, eerie and mystical.
One thing I really enjoyed about the
film was that it wasn't too macabre, as Tim
Burton flicks tend to be. Granted, the
cutesy ghoulishness is what Tim Burton is
famous for, but it was really neat to see a
less morbid side of his art. I was, however,happy to see that he preserved the slightly
sinister element to the Cheshire Cat's
smile. It was also nice to see that "Alice in
Wonderland" wasn't too terribly like the
1951 Disney animated film. Yes, the main
characters looked very similar to the ones
in the Disney movie, but this rendition was
surprisingly
more adult than its
Technicolor counterpart.
"Alice in Wonderland" actually had a
"moral" to it, too. And no, not one that
induces guilt trips or arguments with your
inner Jiminy Cricket, thank goodness. The
"moral" was more along the lines of personal empowerment and going for what
you truly want out of life. It was a nice,
grounding element to the movie and it definitely kept you from feeling like someone
sprinkled LSD on your popcorn.
I did not have the privilege of seeing it
in the 3D version but I'm almost glad I didAlice does a lot of tumbling and
n't
whirling in the film so I can only imagine

that the 3D version tumbled and whirled
you right along with her. For those of you
with weak stomachs, it might be wise to

smuggle in some Dramamine with those
candy bars you bought at 5 Below beforehand. Also, because I did not see the 3D
version, my friend and I noticed that the
screen was often difficult to watch at some
points, most likely due to poor translation
from 3D to 2D. HopefuUy this will be fixed
for the DVD version.

Next up for examination is "The Time

probably due to the fact that it's more confusing than 14th century literature, slightly disturbing and more inherently depressing than "The Curious Case of Benjamin
Button" (2008).

The story is centered around a romance
between Clare, a normal girl, and Henry,
who has a genetic mutation that causes
him to involuntarily travel through time.
While this sounds as though it has the
potential to be a good sci-fi flick or
romance, it was poorly laid out on screen
and thus impossible to foUow. Throughout
the entire movie my mom and I exchanged
more dumbfounded looks than contestants

Henry continually meets and

with the younger Clare (we're talking age
six here), knowing about and sometimes
hinting of their future love. Nothing nasty
happens, but the hint of pedophilia was a
bit too strong for my taste.
As for the movie's intrinsic misery, I'll
give you a hint as to why: one day Henry

from the near future appears on the floor
in front of Clare and present-day Henry.
Problem is, he's bleeding profusely and
rather fatally. In a sense it was exactly like

"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"

where you're essentially watching a countdown to a man's expiration date. But what
made it worse than Mr. Button's story was
that they didn't know when or how Henry
would perish, and a baby was on the way.
In short, it was not quite the light-hearted
or uplifting film I expected it to be.
It's a shame that the movie stunk so
badly because the actors did admirable
jobs. Alas, I don't recommend seeing it.
Ever. Unless you've got a hankering for

Slaying cultural stereotypes of Asia through film
BY DINA ZINGARO

dzingarol@swarthmore.edu

Even in an age that values political correctness, issues of race, gender and representation in film and other media are
often unnoticed or are simply accepted
without question. As the 2010 guest speaker for the Genevieve Ching-Wen Lee '96

lecture, Dr. Elaine Kim will address the
contemporary visual media representation of Asian women in her documentary
"Slaying the Dragon: Reloaded." In honor
of Swarthmore alumna Genevieve Chingwen Lee, the memorial fund features an
annual lecture by a distinguished scholar
in the developing, multidiscipiinary field
of Asian American studies.
Recent cinema productions, such as
"The Last Samurai" in 2003 and "Memoirs
of a Geisha" in 2005, have fueled the
stereotype of Asian women as being exotic, accepting and timid. Kim wrestles with
such representations and advocates for

the identification. and consideration of
such lurking stereotypes.
In her new documentary "Slaying the
Dragon: Reloaded," Kim will be revisiting
the issues addressed in Debora Gee's original 1988 documentary "Slaying the
Dragon: Asian Women in U.S. Film and
Television." Gee's provocative documentary examines the different ways Asian
women were depicted from the 1920s to the
1980s. Produced over 20 years ago, the documentary is still in heavy circulation.
Swarthmore professor Alexandra
Gueydan exposed her students to Gee's
documentary in the directed reading on
"Representation of Asia in Francophone
Literature." In using the documentary,

Each year, a handful of music students take on the challenge of holding a
senior recital. For some, it is part of an
honors major or minor requirement. For
others, it is a chance to showcase the
work they have been doing since the
beginning of their college music careers.
For both Johanna Bond 'lO and Clare
Kobasa 10, the senior recital is a special
moment. "While we are not [music]
majors, and so our concert is not officially a senior recital, we are incredibly
excited to have the opportunity to play,"
Bond said. Together, Bond and Kobasa
will be performing the Mozart Flute and
Harp concerto this Friday at 8 p.m. at the
Lang Concert Hall.
Students wishing to hold a senior
recital must first take it upon themselves
to obtain full sponsorship from the
music department and by submitting a
proposal.

Then the musicians must make sure
that they have accompaniment taken
care of, either through the services of a
professional or through another student.
For instrumentalists and vocalists, the
piano accompanist is essential to most
pieces performed. They must write
extensive program notes on their pieces,
overseen by one of the members of the
music faculty.

scenes and the talents of Matt Damon and Paul
Greengrass, director of the last two Bourne movies,
could be so disappointing and boring? Greengrass' latest project "Green Zone" misses its mark.
Based on Rajiv Chandrasekaran's book "Imperial
Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone,"
"Green Zone" centers on the operations of a U.S. Army
squad headed by Chief Warrant Officer Miller (Matt
Damon), whose goals are to locate and secure weapons
of mass destruction (WMDs) according to intelligence
reports based on tips given by a mysterious informant
by the code name Magellan.
The only problem is that these reports are faulty,
which Miller begins to suspect as the operations continue to fail. He takes it upon himself to investigate the
source of-the disconnect in the intel, uncovering ineptitude and conspiracies both to keep the ruling party in
power and to dethrone the ruling party.
Considering these plot elements, one might think
that it would make a great thriller. However, the execution was sloppy. The story lacked focus from the opening frame, neither centering on a proper mindset nor
establishing a specific problem. When the squad shows

that resembles a quest for the truth fiUed with honor
and pride. The characters remain so underdeveloped
that it's hard to focus on where the problem of the film
lies, and hence impossible for there to be any meaning
in Miller's quest. A villain is not established until twenty to thirty minutes into the film, and there is not
enough dramatic irony to establish the critical standpoint of the film.
The main problem that underlies the lack of development in the film is its failure to establish the psychological motives of the characters, the emotions and sentiments that drive a certain person to act in a certain
way. Much of the film is superficial, merely presenting
and criticizing facts rather than developing the argument that it seeks to make.
It would have been nice, in light of the superior "The
Hurt Locker," to delve into the personal losses of each
soldier as they have to risk their lives on faulty intelligence and to magnify the irony of the whole situation.
Rather, the film fails to establish this dimension and
renders the story flat and mediocre.
Also, the revelation of certain political viewpoints is
insultingly obvious in the film. For example, the view

Mawr on March 26 and BMFI will be showing two
of his most famous movies, "Hairspray" and
"Pink Flamingos." Hairspray showed yesterday,
but Pink Flamingos will be playing on Saturday,
March 20 at midnight.
The film, made in 1972, is rated NC-17 and follows Divine, who lives in a trailer park with her
family and enters a contest against an upper-class
couple for the prize of being named the "filthiest
person alive." The celebration of Water's work
with the film screenings will culminate with his
appearance on March 26. Visit BMFI's website for
ticket information: www.brynmawrfilm.org.

X MARKS THE SPOT

that a nation such as the United States should not be
interfering as they did in Iraq is revealed to us by a blatant and cheesy declaration by an Iraqi man, who
expresses willingness to help the Americans. After a
disorienting action scene in which Miller is chasing Al
Rawi/Magellan (Yigal Naor), the Iraqi man shows up
out of the blue to shoot Al Rawi, all the while blurting
that America can't just interfere in other people's business. The film simply lacks subtlety.
Another disheartening aspect is the blatant product
placement in the film, which breaks the realism necessary for a film that deals with such current issues. In
one scene, Miller walks out on an airstrip, where there
happens to be a crate with boxes marked with the Pizza
Hut logo. These Pizza Hut boxes may emphasize the
irony of the presence of the Green Zone in Iraq,
allowing the Americans who have taken over Saddam's
palace to peddle their corporate agendas. But then how.
does one explain the random, out-of-place Burger King
sign that seems to have been added in post-production
to a building outside of the Green Zone base?
"Green Zone" holds an important message that
Americans need to hear about the actual incompetency
of the war operations in Iraq. But the sloppy execution
and lack ofrealism undermine any sort of poignancy
in
the movie, leaving one wondering about the .heartpounding, intellectual and "Bourne"-like thriller that it
has been hyped to be.

I've written about fan

shows such as "Lost,"

I want to talk about fan culture in a different context:
the way that intense fandom is portrayed in other
shows, primarily half-hour
comedies (which, in general, are among the genres

Of all the comedies cur-

rently dealing with fan culture, the most important is
"The Big Bang Theory," a

show that has featured both
Summer Glau (of "Firefly"
and "Terminator: The
Sarah Connor Chronicles")
and Stan Lee (co-creator of
Spiderman and many other
comics characters) as guest
stars. Now, I realize that
some of you might take
issue with any argument
that the four physicists at
the center of "Big Bang" do
anything to refute fanboy
stereotypes, and your argument would make sense.

why so many students here
seem to love this show.)

However, "Big Bang"
has often taken pains to
make the fandom of its
major characters relatable
to the rest of us. Part of the
reason for this is the sheer
number of fandoms in

which the boys participate:
"Lord of the Rings," "Lost,"

"Firefly,"
"Farscape," Marvel comics,
and "Star Trek," to name
just a small subset. Because
of the immense quantity of

viewers will identify with

"Sex and the City."

al of that movement. The
development of which I
speak is the growth of
cultish fan bases around
shows that traditionally
aren't the territory of fan
culture. These are shows
that don't have booths at
Comic-Con, and whose fans
aren't so much the sci-fi
type. One of the most prominent recent examples of this
new fan culture trend is the
wildly popular Fox show
"Glee," a comedic drama

that centers on a high
school glee club. Now,
teenage drama and Barbra

of a fan-culture

Second $8M plan structurally adjusts spending

swarthmorephoenix.com

Over the
past several
weeks, this
column has
explored

the income
side of the
college's
budget

Molly Weston
Budget Break-down

how
tuition,
fees, endowment spending
and

annual fund
donations
come
together to fund over $lOO million worth
of spending every year. This week, we'll
move to the spending side to find out what
all that money really gets us. However,
before we dive in, it is worth taking a
brief moment to appreciate a major development in the college's financial future
that occurred since the last column was
written.
First, a bit of background about the
budgeting process is useful. Each year,
the Board of Managers adopts the college's budget for the following budget year
at its spring meeting. For the 2009-2010
budget, the Board adopted $8 million in
spending cuts from the previous year, as
recommended by the Ad Hoc Financial
Planning Group. Because the value of the
endowment and the state of the economy
overall remain down compared to earlier
years, the Financial Planning Group
again advised the board on the 2010-2011
.

budget.

For the 2010-2011 budget, the group recommended a second ".$8 million plan."
This did not represent an additional $8
million in cuts on top of the 2009-2010
reduction (i.e., it did not reduce spending
from $lO7 million to $99 million). Instead,
this plan offered a framework for permanently adjusting the college's spending in
light of the new economic and endowment

realities to replace the temporary reductions of this year's budget. The plan,
adopted by the Board of Managers in
December 2009, combined planned
increases (and changes in) fundraising,
slightly raised enrollment targets, lowered (but not permanently ended) capital
spending, reduced academic and administrative department budgets, slight
changes in financial aid, changes in faculty/staff benefits and compensation, and
other measures. Those changes, however,
only covered $6.9 million of the needed $8
million adjustment, leaving the remaining $ll million to be determined through
the college's normal budgeting process.
We now know how we will cover most
of the SLI million per year gap for the
immediate future. At its most recent
meeting, as reported by The Phoenix on
March 4, the Board of Managers committed as a group to donate $1 million for
each of the next three years, giving the
college time to carefully weigh where to
make further permanent cuts. This effort
was led by Emeritus Chair of the Board
Eugene Lang '3B, who personally pledged
$700,000 per year to this end. A second
major pledge from the Board came from
another familiar last name: Gil Kemp '72,
who was largely responsible for the building of David Kemp Hall (named after his
grandfather). While Lang, Kemp and the
other Managers will not prevent spending
cuts, their generosity will make those cuts
hurt a great deal less in the near future.
Understanding the most recent cuts
brings us back to our original topic:
Where do those $108.6 million (the total
budget spending for the 2010-2011 fiscal
year) go? As reported in the 2010-2011
Operating Budget, released by the
Finance Office in February, the single
biggest category is compensation, which
will make up $67.9 million or 63 percent of
spending. Compensation does not, however, only include salaries, as faculty and
staff benefits of various kinds are also
included under this number. This increas-

es the costs of compensation, particularly
as the costs ofhealth insurance premiums
have tended to rise faster than inflation.
While further breakdown of expected
2010-2011 compensation spending is not
yet available in published reports, the
most recent college financial report states
that,in the 2008-2009 budget year, when
faculty and staff compensation made up
just 57 percent of the budget (though
absolute spending, due to that year's larger budget, was essentially the same at $66
million), faculty compensation represented 25 percent of overall expenses, while
staff compensation made up 32 percent of
expenses.

Non-compensation
expenses make up the

departmental

next largest share

of the budget at a project $22.4 million, or
20 percent of the total budget, for 2010-201 L
This represents a virtually identical
absolute spending commitment to this
year's spending, though a slight decrease
in percentage terms (from 21 percent)
given the growth in the size of the overall
budget. What exactly do non-compensation department expenditures cover? The
"departments" in question include not
only academic departments, but ITS,
admissions, the library system, dean's
offices, athletics, human resources, dining services, EVS, public safety and the
Health Center, among others. Therefore,
this section includes most of the physical
objects the college buys, from books, lab
supplies, periodicals and paper to athletic
equipment, medicine, cleaning supplies
and food. It also includes costs like printing, mailing, on-campus transportation,

travel, payment for outside speakers and
performers, and much more.
The third major category of college
spending is debt service, totaling SILB million or 11 percent of overall expenditures
in projected spending for 2010-2011 (down
slightly from SIL9 million in 2009-2010).
This is reflective of the way the college
finances some of its spending, particularly on capital campaigns (such as building

projects), through issuing bonds via the
borough of Swarthmore. For example, the
proceeds from the bonds issued in 2001
helped build the science center and Alice
Paul as well as other big projects. As of
June 30, 2009, the college had a total outstanding debt of $lBO.B million, an amount
equal to approximately 16 percent of the
value of the endowment. Servicing this
debt (paying back those who bought
Swarthmore bonds) is a necessary part of
the college's ability to continue issuing
bonds for major projects and reflects an
overall responsible borrowing practice.

For

2010-201 l debt service will include pro-

jected payments against the principal of
$3,275,000 and against interest of
$8,349,000; the seeming skew reflects the
fact that no bonds will come due next year
(the next year bonds will mature is the
2013-2014 budget year).
The fourth and fifth categories are
both comparatively small. Capital expenditures, at $3.0 million, will represent just
3 percent of the budget, up from 2009-2010
($2.5 million or two percent) but down
substantially from 2008-2009 ($lO.B million
or 10 percent). Cuts to capital expenditures, such as building and renovation
projects and technology, have been a
major part of the college's short-term
budget adjustment strategies and their
impacts will be discussed at greater
length in the next column. Finally, utilities such as heating and air, electricity,
and phone services make up the final $3.5
million and 3 percent of next year's budget.
As always, I'd love to hear from you if
you have questions, comments, or concerns about the budget, the endowment,
or any other related issues. Please join us
in two week as the column explores what

it will mean for Swarthmore to live on
less as we discuss cuts to this year's budget and the permanent adjustments for

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Sacrifices must be made to land internships
BY AMANDA JOINSON
DAILYCOLLEGIAN.COM
MAR. 9, 2010
Spring break is around the
corner. So now students may be
wondering what they are going
to do for the summer, and with
the economy still in a less than
favorable condition, the outlook
for those killer internships cannot be good.
The options for internships
may be slim, especially if you
have moral standards, which I
expect everyone to own up to.
You are the only one who can
decide what you believe in and
those morals determine who
you are and how people respond

to you.

Do you apply and go on interviews for jobs with companies
that you do not necessarily
agree with ethically?
For example, if you are a
devoted consumer of Apple
products and do not agree with
the practices of Microsoft,
would you take the internship

16

with Microsoft if it was 10 minutes from wherever you choose
to call home this summer and
pays, possibly even more than
minimum wage?
It is a very legitimate question, and it all comes down to
ethics.
Of course going against your
morals for an internship seems
preposterous; it would be like a
vegan drinking a cold glass of
chocolate milk or an atheist
attending a religious ceremony,
but take a second look at the
options. You could always go
back home to your faithful pizza
delivery job or back to CVS
stocking shelves.
The truth is those jobs are
probably not going to get you far
after college. Employers are
going to be looking for some
solid experience, and in order
for a person to acquire a noteworthy internship, sacrifices
must be made.
Finding an internship that
has a minimum amount of commuting would be prime. Think

about it, gas prices are on the
rise again, and most internships
aren't paid internships.
Do you really want to drive
an hour in traffic going to and
from work? I would assume not,
especially if your temporary
office would most likely not pay
for your gasoline intake.
It would be great if all companies were required to pay.
Wouldn't that just be a dream
come true? Not only would the
competiveness
die
down
because all internships would be
paid, but companies might actually value you more and want
you to actually do something
because they are . throwing
money out the window otherwise. Credits are being offered
along with experience, but how
far is that going to take you
when you're trying to pay for
weekend adventures?
Students want the perfect
internship. They want an
internship that doesn't require
coffee runs or photocopies all
day, but realistically, students
March 18, 2010

have to know that something
has got to give. And in the world,
of internships, nothing is perfect. As students entering the
job market in a tough economy,
again, sacrifices must be made.
Maybe that paid internship is
a few miles away. Or maybe it is
unpaid and requires extensive
travel time, but without taking a
chance on an internship you
might be risking your future.
We all know about the challenges that last year's graduating class had to overcome or
have heard nightmare stories of
students who have had to move
back in with their parents
because they have yet to find a
job a year later.
The problem is doubly worrisome when you consider that
not only does a lack of a career
mean a lack of income, but also,
a lack of means to pay off the
$BO,OOO debt that some graduates
have accrued over their four
years at UMass.
Say you don't see eye-to-eye
with the company completely.

Going against your ideals might
seem crazy, but that company
might prepare you for a career
in your selected industry better
than any of its competitors.
Chances are you do not agree
with all of its practices.
However, you will get a better
understanding of the company's
views working there, and the
good news is, flexibility is an
important quality to have in a
student seeking employment.
We have to enter the real
world eventually, and we must

come to terms with the fact that
we can't all get what we want.
Applying to an internship in
your academic field is better
than wasting another summer
waiting for your more successful friends to get out of work
after you get off your part-time
shift. Despite what it entails,
putting any chances of a future
advancement on the back-burner at this moment in time is the
last thing you want to do.
Get started because the good
internships are going to go fast.

SPORTS IN BRIEF I^HI^^H^MHMHI

Baseball team back from Arizona
The Garnet baseball team started its
season over spring break by winning its
first three games, but lost five straight to
end the break at 3-5.
The Spring Trip to Arizona (March 514), which included three doubleheaders,
began with the two-day Desert Classic in
Boulder Creek, AZ. Neil Mejia 12 took
the mound on the first day and struck
out seven batters while giving up three
runs. With strong hitting from Ben
Schneiderman 11, the Garnet defeated
Presentation College with a three-run
rally in the seventh inning to defeat the
Saints 5-3. On the second day of the tournament, Kyle Crawford 'l2 earned himself his first career shutout. In a dominating performance, Crawford struck
out seven batters and allowed just two
hits. Spencer Ross 'l2 gave the Garnet a
quick lead with a two-run homer in the
first inning. The Garnet continued their
lead with two more runs in the third
inning and another two in the sixth
inning.

The Garnet continued its winning

Now is as good a time as ever to look at the current fiscal landscape of professional sports, with the current
advent of the NFL free-agency (and a cap free season), the
impending arrival of one of the most-hyped NBA freeagency periods in recent history, and the most recent win
of the World Series by the New York Yankees (who sported
a $lOO million plus payroll). To prevent big market teams
from gaining unfair advantages over smaller market teams
and to keep costs down for owners and fans, most professional sports implement a "salary cap." The salary cap is
self-explanatory: each team is either allowed to spend up to
a certain amount on the total salaries of its athletes or up
to a certain amount on each athlete.
The NFL and NBA both have caps for the total amount
of money that a team can spend on salaries, though the
NBA's cap is somewhat more lenient. Though basketball
teams also have limits on how much each individual athlete can receive, they can surpass the cap because of loopholes like as Larry Bird rights, which allow teams to
exceed the cap when resigning their own free agents. The
MLB doesn't have a salary cap, but employs a "dissuasive"
luxury tax (which the NBA also employs), which forces
teams who exceed a certain amount of total payroll to pay
a tax to the league. There are obviously many more intricacies to the how professional sports teams work out their
payroll, but these are the basics for how salary caps work.
The "greediness" that most professional athletes display
amazes most of us. We've all heard disgruntled athletes
voice their unhappiness with salaries in order to force a
trade by the owners of a team. We've heard of the everincreasing lucrative contracts free agents (a player who
basically is no longer in contract with a team) receive.
What do these transactions do to fans? Small market team
fans like the Florida Marlins routinely need to suffer

through the liquidation of their team's best talents to teams
like the Yankees, just because they cannot afford to pay the
salaries these athletes demand (the Yankees, on the other
hand, can agree to pay three athletes $423.5 million in contracts in one weekend, spending more than $52 million
more than the next closest team for the year).
Fans of the New York Knicks and Washington Wizards
watch as their ownership effectively "give up" on basketball seasons, trading talented but somewhat expensive
players to clear cap space to attract even more talented and
even more expensive players. Do fans get reimbursed for
their tickets in games in which their team gets blown out
due to unbalanced rosters? What happens when the teams
can't sign a Lebron James or a Dwyane Wade, and the fans
are left with a handful of less-talented role players?
Both the NFL and NBA are facing potential lockout seasons in 2010-2011, as the collective bargaining agreements
between the leagues and the players' unions expire. If the
unions decide that the players deserve more money, a lockout is completely possible. Once again, the apparent greediness of athletes looms over sports fans, threatening the
suspension of games entirely for months. We look back on
situationslike the 2004-2005 NHL lockout and are amazed at
how often sports fans are harmed by the avarice of just a

few.

It's astounding how littie power fans have in pressuring the suppliers of

their

entertainment.

enough and the chance to make history so rare?
My vision is almost impossible to achieve. It only takes
just a demand from just one of those free agents for a slightly smaller salary for the others to start clamoring for more.
An individual could be equally happy in a world where
everyone made one; dollar to an individual in a world

where everyone had salaries of five dollars if he or she
were not aware of the latter's existence. But relative status
is so embedded in human conscience that we cannot bear
to be satisfied with what we have in the presence of those
who have more. We demand more money if there are people who are richer—even if that money won't make us happier (at this point, I border on sounding like I've read too
much Barry Schwartz). For athletes, that money is worth
more than the chance to make history.
And who's to say that a sports profession full of selfless
athletes would even be beneficial to the league as a whole?
The Heat fan would love the opportunity to see all those
marquee players in Miami uniforms, but ifathletes were to
collude and accept lower salaries, parity in professional
sports would probably be severely hampered. Though the
salary caps of the NBA and NFL haven't necessarily
allowed for complete parity among teams in their respective leagues, repeated success at the Super Bowl and NBA
finals seems to have less to

do with ability to compensate talented athletes and
more to do with competent
administration (salary
has shown to have an
the
insignificant correlation
to wins in the NBA, for
example).
The current state of the
MLB shows, albeit somewhat distortedly, what could happen if athletes were to
become completely selfless. By deciding not to employ a
salary cap, teams with money can effectively sign numerous amounts of marquee players to their roster. The "dissuasive" luxury tax hasn't prevented the Red Sox, Yankees,
Angels, or Tigers from overspending, and their success this
past decade has shown because of it. Furthermore, though
a larger number of teams have won the World Series this
past 30 years than teams that have won the Super Bowl or
NBA championships (20 compared to 13 and nine, respectively), certain teams consistently manage to reach the
playoffs, whereas others experience decades of fruitlessness (the Pirates and Royals come to mind).
Thus we are left with something of a Catch-22. Most

And who's to say that a sports
profession full of selfless athletes
would even be beneficial to
league as a whole?

Athletes can demand more
money, and teams will simply charge higher fees for
tickets. Basketball fans
will have to suffer through
droughts of talent and
baseball followers will have to watch as the Yankees and
Red Sox reach the playoffs year after year as their own
teams fall short.
The problem seems to be the athletes, not the system.
As a fan, I dream of situations where a few top talents agree
to smaller contracts in order for my team to recruit a number of them at one time. Imagine if Lebron James, Joe
Johnson, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade all decided to
accept smaller contracts this coming NBA free agency period to be able to play with each other on the same team. The
Miami Heat could sport a starting five of James at small
forward, Johnson and Wade at guard positions, Bosh at
center, and Michael Beasley at power forward. How domi-

nating would that rotation be?
As athletes get older, they all clamor for chances to win
championships. They "lose" their desire for money and
start focusing on leaving an impression on their respective
sports. Why does this impetus come so late in thencareers? They have the ability to talk to some of their fellow stars and decide to all agree to sign for smaller contracts for the chance to start dynasties. Why is the money
so appealing if the compensation is always more than

sports fans hope that their favorite hometown athletes
forgo larger promises of wealth for a more moral motive:
the chance to bring a championship to a devoted city that
has won little or the chance to leave a mark in history. But
is equality in professional sports an expense worth forfeiting for this hope?

Women split weekend games postponed by weather

While the Northeast was hit hard by
storms this week, the Swarthmore women's
lacrosse team handled the Thunder just
fine.
The visiting Garnet dispatched Trine
University 12-7 last Wednesday in South
Carolina. It was their second straight victory to open the season, while the Thunder
dropped to 0-2.

Attacker Annelise Mowry 'l2 and midfielder Emily Evans 'll led the scoring with
a hat trick each. For Mowry, it was already
her second of the season. Midfielder Nicole
Vanchieri 'l3 added two goals of her own.
"It was good to see the team take it to the
next level of competition after our first
game," head coach Karen Borbee said.
"Today gave us a chance to see how our
midfield and defense looked at that next
level."

The Garnet ran away with this one from
the start, taking a 10-5 lead into the half off
of an aggressive offensive attack; they fired

off 25 shots on goal to the Thunder's 17 and
outshot Trine overall, 37-27. A momentum
shift appeared possible near the end of the
first half, when the Thunder scored three
quick goals to cut Swarthmore's lead to
five. The Garnet averted disaster, however,
with a strong defensive front in the second
half, allowing only two more goals. They
preserved their lead, and relying on ball
control, pulled out the victory.
"I think we were somewhat disappointed to let three goals in at the end of the first
half within about 30 seconds, so we made
sure to step it up in the second half,"
defender Emily Bryant 'l2 said. "The
offense successfully stalled for the last five
minutes of the game and we were able to

put [Trine] away."
Coming off a 2009 season in which they
finished 9-8, as well as a disappointing 1-8 in
conference play, the Garnet look to capitalize on this strong start to exceed the results
of last year. Coach Borbee referenced the
high level of competition in the Centennial
conference conference leader Franklin &
Marshall is the top-ranked Division 111

as an indicator of
team in the country
what a team must overcome against a con-

ference opponent.
"Every time we play in conference, we
know it's a whole new ball game," Borbee
said. "We know everyone is strong, [the
division] is amazingly competitive, and
we're anxious to go out there and compete
against the best."
Goalie Allison Grein 'lO believes that
some of the team's new talent can ensure
that Swarthmore does.
"We are fortunate enough to have a lot of
strong freshman talent who should be making some great contributions on the field,"
Grein, who racked up 10 saves against
Trine, said. She didn't fail to commend the
effort of the sophqmores, however, specifically citing Mowry's hot start to the season.
"The sophomores, [like] Annelise, have
stepped up a lot this year and are having a
huge impact,"

Grein said.

Abbe Muller 'lO, Amy Vachal 'll, Beth
Martin 'l3 and Samantha Panepinto 'l3 also
scored for Swarthmore. Thunder midfielders Samantha Kumfer and Bridget Brown

March 18, 2010

led their team's scoring with two goals
each, while Trine University's goalkeeper
Emily Cardona led both squads with 13
saves.
Despite the auspicious beginning to the
2010 season, the Garnet remain committed
to improving their level of play.
Mowry identified "the transition game
[and] refining the settled attack," when
asked about areas in which she saw room
for improvement. "Every game gives us
something to improve upon, [but] the team
has a lot ofpotential and I think everyone is
excited to get out and play," she said. "I
think we're still getting used to each other's
playing styles," Grein said, "[B]ut the more
we practice and play together the more confidence we will have in ourselves and each
other to pull off whatever we are trying to
accomplish on the field."
Following the cancellation of their
March 12 matchup against Savannah, the
Garnet take the field this Thursday on the
road at Moravian College, who have started
the season with a 2-1 record. Start time is
currently listed as 4 p.m.
