Dean to rally Kerry support at Swat
BY CHRISTINA TEMES

ctemesl@swarthmore.edu

As the race for the White House enters its last week and
politicians squeeze in their last speeches and rallies before
Election Day, Swarthmore will host its own high-profile
speaker today. Former Democratic presidential hopeful
and Vermont governor Howard Dean will speak in the
Lang Performing Arts Center at 10 a.m. in support of the

Democratics.
Members of the college community who have been
active in the Democratic campaign and with Pa. Victory
'O4, a group affiliated with the Pennsylvania Democratic
Party, were contacted last week about using Swarthmore
as a venue for a visit from a "high level Kerry surrogate."
College Democrats President Eva Barboni 'O6, soccer
coach Eric Wagner and Susan Smythe, LPAC's managing
director, who were all independently contacted by the
campaign, passed on the request to Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l about the college's hosting of the
event. "The campaign called anyone they could think of,"
Smythe said.

"He has done a great job at getting
out there stumping for
Kerry and stumping other
Democratic candidates."
Eric Wagner
men's soccer coach
"It's pretty clear that in the area the Democrats are getas possible," Eldridge said.
Eldridge brought up the visit at last Friday's faculty
meeting, "to attack the logistics" of it, he said.
At the meeting, it was decided that the college could not
provide parking for the event due to the large number of
outside guests expected to attend. Because of this, Barboni
"offered for the College Democrats to help with transportation as well as volunteers for the event." Barboni coordinated efforts to use the Springfield Mall parking lot for
guest parking and received funding from the Kerry campaign and the Swarthmore Democratic Committee to provide two buses to shuttle people from the parking lot to
campus.
"We wanted to make sure it could happen
if this goes
really smoothly, we hope in the future to bring more big
ting as much activity

...

names to campus on our own," Barboni said.
"A lot of people have put time and effort to bring [Dean]
here on campus," Wagner said.
The turnout for the event is expected to be good. The
tickets available to students through the LPAC online
reservation system became available Friday night and
were gone by Sunday morning, according to Smythe. After

the initial distribution of tickets, 1,000 tickets became
available online for off campus visitors through the reservation system.
"The campaign really wanted us to be open to the public as well, because there is a lot of excitement," Smythe
said. Smythe said most off campus advertising was to be
done through e-mail between groups affiliated with the
campaign. More public advertisement would be avoided
due to space limitations. "[There is more] of a problem of
how to confine it rather than how to get enough people,"

she said.
"I think the place will get filled," Eldridge said.

Dean's prominence and the number of people coming to
campus for the rally prompted extra security measures, as
well. Beginning last night, cars were not permitted to park
past Wharton on the Parrish West circle or in the Lang circle. Today, Facilities will accept any deliveries normally
delivered to the Parrish area and will distribute them after
the event, according to Director of Public Safety Owen

Redgrave.
"By not knowing exactly how many people will come to
the event, some [of the measures] are for keeping cars
away from the building for security reasons, and some is
provided for hospitality to guests and the press," Redgrave
said. He added that there will be extra security from outside law enforcement agencies on hand, though he did not
disclose the specific agencies for security reasons.
Organizers were excited at the prospect of hosting
Dean. "I think it's a really exciting event for us
having
a figure of national prominence at Swarthmore is great,
and I'm excited about the turnout," Wagner said.
Dean will discuss health care and medical malpractice
at the event, according to the organizers.
"It will be a pretty straightforward rally-the-troops, get-

out-the-vote kind of speech," Wagner said.
There will also be another speaker opening the event,

most likely a local politician, but the organizers were
unsure of whom at the time of publication. "Local people
become involved at the last minute," Smythe said.
A month after withdrawing from the presidential race
in February, Dean founded Democracy for America, an
organization whose objectives are to support Democratic
candidates running for all levels of office. Dean has spent
his time fundraising for the organization and touring the

country to gain support for the Kerry campaign and
Democratic candidates for other offices, according to the
Democracy for America Web site.
"Although there was a lot of divisiveness over the primaries, that has definitely waned, and Governor Dean has
done a lot to help out the Kerry campaign over the past
couple of months," Barboni said.
"To his credit, he's thrown all his support and all his
clout and all his weight behind the Democratic nominee,"
Wagner said. "He has done a great job at getting out there
stumping for Kerry and stumping other Democratic candidates."

Students propose services slowdown on Nov. 2
Over 400 signatures collected, petition asks for cancellation of classes, day off for staff
BY JOSEPH BORKOWSKI
jborkowl@swarthmore.edu
To motivate volunteer participation on
Election Day, Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5 and
Ethan Ucker 'O7 began the circulation of a
letter and petition this week, calling for a
slowdown in college services on Nov. 2.
The letter, which suggested "extra
measures be taken to ensure that members of the Swarthmore community have
room in their schedules to participate in
efforts to get both themselves and others
to the polls," stated the importance of the
upcoming election and the opportunity for
members of the Swarthmore community
to volunteer.
It separately stressed the importance of

student, faculty and staff involvement,
and called for class rescheduling or cancellation and a day off for staff.
Rodriguez and Ucker had collected 440
signatures after tabling for two hours at
Sharpies Tuesday night. Rodriguez and

THE PHOENIX

Jyoti Gupta 'O5 presented the signatures

to Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l
yesterday afternoon, because, according
to Ucker, "we wanted to get this on the
desk of the administration as soon as possible."

The administration will consider the

suggestion that staff be given off on Nov. 2
within the next couple of days, Ucker said.
In addition, Eldridge urged students
who wish to volunteer on Election Day to

make their own arrangements with professors.
"We discussed this with the president's

staff and decided that the decision to be
involved in volunteering is an individual
decision and not an institutional decision," he said.
Ucker and Rodriguez's plan for staff
participation involves allowing staff members off for the afternoon, if not the entire
day, according to Ucker.
The Swarthmore Voter Registration
Coalition would provide food to the cam-

pus at their broadcast of election returns
coverage in Upper Tarble in the event of
closures of Sharpies, Essie Mae's and the
coffee bars.
For this event, the group received funding from the Swarthmore Foundation
grant, the President's Office and the
Social Affairs Committee, and is seeking
to receive money food from the
President's Office.
Scott Saleff, an employee at Essie
Mae's, said time off for employees would
help give them time for volunteering.
"I did Learning for Life one year, and I
was just keeping my head above water
with work as it was; I actually fell behind
in my work," he said.
"I think it'd be nice to get out and do
something different," Saleff added.
Some professors, including history professor Marjorie Murphy, have canceled or
rescheduled classes on Election Day.
"I tell students, this election is the
most important election in your lifetime,"

October 28, 2004

Murphy said.

She added that by volunteering on
Election Day, students could become a
part of the democratic process they learn
about in their classes.
"I have no intention of cheating my
students out of their education," she said.
Lulu Miller 'O5, one of Murphy's students, appreciated the opportunity s to
become active on Election Day.
"It's rare where there's any practical
application to what we learn," Miller said.
Ucker said making more time available
on Election Day would help end uncertainty of whether or not students and staff
members would be able to be active on
Election Day.
"If I have class, then I have class. If I
don't, then there's no question. It's the
same thing in terms of work [for staff] ...
if the administration recommends that
the entire campus gets out and gets
involved
it's more encouraging," Ucker
said.

Flu vaccine shortage hits college
Worth to dole out limited supplies of Flu Mist only to those who 'have good reasons'
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore. edu

The Swarthmore community
may exist in a bubble, but as flu
season draws near, the effects of
the national flu vaccine-shortage
have crept through Swarthmore's
rosy gates, causing concern
amongst students and faculty.
the
Corporation,

British drug company whose production failures caused this year's
shortage, withheld 50 percent ofits

shipment of flu vaccines due to
contamination, according to The

diabetes or HIV/AIDS, those who
are pregnant this season, and people 65 or older.
Echols said she is optimistic

that the recent FluMist order will
satisfy many community members
who have contacted her with concerns. But she, like many
American health-care workers, is

unsure what will happen with

additional vaccines in the later
stages of flu season. "Nobody's
promising me anything," she said

for Disease Control. The most pertinent of these criteria to our community suggest giving priority to
people two years old or older who
have an underlying, long-term illness like a heart or lung disease,

The potential for a flu outbreak
is increased at colleges, where students live so close together,
according to Echols. "One of the
best things you can do for the community if you're feeling flu symptoms is not to go to class," she said.
She also encouraged those with flu
symptoms to come to Worth as

soon as possible to receive an

antiviral that will greatly speed up
the recovery process and decrease
the chances of the flu bringing on

other illnesses.

"The flu is bad, but the compli-

cations are worse. It can lead to

Washington Post. Despite using

Health Center, like many hospitals
and clinics worldwide, did not
receive a supply.
Worth Director Linda Echols
announced Monday in a reservedstudents e-mail that the health
center had just received a small
order of Flu Mist, a nasal flu vaccine that will be available to the
"first 50 students, faculty, or staff
who sign up and have good reasons to get it." Each dose of
FluMist costs $2O, more than double the price of an injection. The
vaccine used to sell for $B5 per vial
of 10 doses but is now selling for as
much as $9OO a vial due to the
shortage, according to Echols.
The criteria Echols will use in
determining who has "good reasons" for a vaccination follow the

strategies," she said.

"This place is a
breeding ground
for disease I
say, 'better

Shira Meyerowitz 'O7
As with any vaccine, "there is a
chance [when using Flu Mist] of
shedding the virus and giving the

flu to folks who have weak
immune systems because of illness or medication," Echols said.
Then again, she gave 40 doses of
FluMist to community members
last year and "didn't hear any complaints."

Until the supply of a vaccination
either a nasal or an injected one
is stable, Echols hopes
the members of the community
will pay more attention to their
hygiene and ways of preventing
the flu. "We're going to put posters
up emphasizing public health

other things,"

Echols said.
Shira Meyerowitz 'O7 jumped at
the opportunity to have a dose of
FluMist. "I had the shot the last
two years, and I've never had the
flu. Because we live so close
together, this place is a breeding
ground for disease
I say, 'better
safe than sorry,'" she said.
Economics professor Mark
Kuperberg became interested in
the national issue. The shortage is
a "failure of "small government'
for which a prime responsibility
should be worrying about public
health," Kuperberg said.
The two main reasons for the

shortage, according to Kuperberg,

are vaccine companies' fear of
lawsuit and "the fact that drug
companies need to 'guess' which

strain of the virus will be domi-

nant each season," since each vac-

cine defends against only one
strain.
In an op-ed piece he recently

wrote called "The Flu Vaccine and

in the past. A limited supply of FluMist will be available, however.
equates this year's vaccine shortage with the terrorist attacks of
2001, calling them both "catastrophes of small government." The
proximate cause of the September
11 attacks was "a privately run and
severely underfunded passenger
screening system," he said.
Similarly, in the recent vaccine
shortage, the government "did not
provide for the public health, especially with respect to infectious
diseases. Left alone, the private
sector will underprovide for protection against infectious disease,"
he wrote.
Kuperberg proposes that flu
vaccines be covered by the

wrote.
In addition, he calls for the government to "set a price at which it
will buy unused vaccine," as is
done in agricultural price supports.

Although he predicts the flu

vaccine will be covered by the
NVICF in the near future, he questions any further action by the
government due to America's
"obsessive fear of big government."
"Big government may cost
you," Kuperberg wrote, "but small
government can kill you."

Students question appropriate amount of transcript access
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN

bbangjel@swarthmore.edu

A recent fellowship decision has led
Student Council to examine who ought to
have access to student transcripts.

Under current policy, faculty is not
restricted from accessing student transcripts, and Student Council is discussing
ways to potentially check this power.
The topic was brought to the surface this
fall when Mark Hanis 'O5 was culled from
the first pool of 25 applicants applying for
the Watson Fellowship, a one-year grant for
foreign study and travel awarded to 50 students from participating colleges.
Hanis learned from Christina Rose
Dubb, the fellowships and prizes advisor,
that "my application was good, but it was
my transcript that prevented me from making the next round." He was surprised by
this explanation since the cover sheet did
not mention a transcript.
"The application pool was explicitly told
that transcripts would not be necessary,"
Student Council Educational Policy
Representative Hunter Bandy 'O7 said.
Registrar Martin Warner pointed out
that both Swarthmore's Watson Fellowship
Web site and the national Web site mention
that a transcript is required. "It's not a mystery," he said, adding that the Watson applications are similar to applying for a major,

and "it is the work of the people involved to

meet and look at students records."
Because Hanis thought no one would
examine his transcript, he did not include a
note explaining that he had suffered a
seizure during last semester's finals period
which harmed his grades.
"Regardless of extenuating circumstances, a student should be able to defend
their transcript under any decision making
process," Hanis said.
"The underlying issue is that faculty
have the power to look at transcripts,"

access," Hanis said.
"We may not tell you in person" that faculty has access to transcripts, Warner said.
"But we give you student handbooks every
year which explain the policy."
This method of informing students of the
transcript policy, however, has become a
point of contention.

he said.

"The basic breakdown is that the information on studentrecords belong to the student and is your private information. This
information is not released outside of the
college without your permission. Within the
college, even though that information is

stantly maintaining, creating, and using

that information," Warner said.

long as teachers use it responsibly." One pos-

sible solution the council is discussing notifying students via e-mail whenever their
transcript is accessed. But Warner said this
solution is not practical, because faculty is
constantly viewing parts of student records,
and the records are located all over campus.
Currently, students can add an addendum to their transcripts to correct inaccurate information. According to Bandy, only
one person did this last year.
However, there are options available to

because they are only tested for a learning

Westphal said.
"The school cannot release this information and it doesn't show up on student
records because it is confidential to the student. If such a studentknows or thinks that
a transcript may be required, send an

there are anomalies in your transcript,"
Westphal said.

Students lead efforts to
fight genocide in Sudan
BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
A group ofSwarthmore students
have united to press the American
government and private citizens to
do more to stop what the United
Nations has called the world's
in
worst humanitarian crisis
Sudan's western region of Darfur.
Since
the crisis, which

lion Sudanese have been forced to
flee their homes. During the past
seven months, pro-government
militias, known by the international community as the janjaweed,
have killed 70,000 people, primarily
civilians,
according to The
Associated Press.

Mark Hanis 'O5 has been a
leading member of the group of
students concerned about the
genocide.

"Over the summer I worked for

a [non-governmental organization],
and one of their projects was called
Darfurgenocide.org, and so I was
every day finding out more information about the genocide," Hanis
said. "When I came to Swarthmore,
I tried to talk to other Swatties,
finding out what more Swarthmore
was going to do to respond to the
Unfortunately, a lot of
genocide
people didn't know what was happening," he said.
Hanis, members of Amnesty
International and several other
students are especially interested
in pressing the U.S. government to
supply military aid for a peacekeeping mission of African Union
troops. "The U.S. doesn't have to
send in troops, it's never going to
do that, but we can focus a lot of
our actions on supporting the
African Union troops by expanding
their mandate and increasing their
numbers," Hanis said.
...

The Comprehensive Peace in
Sudan Act was passed by the
House of Representatives in
September, but has not yet been
voted on in the Senate. The bill
would provide humanitarian and
military aid for the region and
require the Department of the
Treasury to identify all companies
doing business in Sudan and examine the relationship between the
companies' business activities and
current human rights abuses. The
bill would give the treasury the
power to remove companies that
do business with Sudan from the
New York Stock Exchange.
Amnesty International members and Hanis have begun a letter
-writing campaign to urge senators
to support the act.

Andrew Sniderman 'O6, work-

ing with Hanis and others, has
developed a project to raise money
from private sources to supplement American public aid. "We are
proposing the creation of a private
fund-raising initiative, a genocide
intervention fund to support a military intervention in Darfur and to
create a financial base to fight
future,"
of
the
genocides

Sniderman said.
"This fund would be a private
initiative
so that the African
Union could have the financial and
logistical means to stop the genocide," Hanis said.
The proposal has been sent to
major newspapers, think tanks
and various current and former
government officials. The Center
for American Progress has recently expressed interest in the initiative, as have two former members
of president Bill Clinton's
National Security Council, Gayle
Smith and John Prendergast,
said.
Though
Sniderman
Swarthmore students started the
initiative, the fund-raising efforts
will not be limited to the college
...

community, Sniderman said.
Emiliano Rodriguez 'O5 has also
begun an effort to look at if and
how the college as an institution
might be able to pressure the
Sudanese government by divesting
from companies that do business in
the country.
Most of the endowment is
invested in domestic firms that do
not work in Sudan. Part of the
endowment, however, is invested
in mutual funds that have international portfolios, Rodriguez said.
"Once we receive the list of
companies doing business in
Sudan, we will see if any of those
are held by the investment managers who manage the international funds in which the endowment
invests," Vice President and
Treasurer Suzanne Welsh said in
an e-mail. If the college did decide
to pressure its investment managers to divest from firms doing
business in Sudan, a decision
would have to be reached by the

Board of Managers.
"Divestment
shouldn't be
viewed as a moral stand, or some
moral utterance," Rodriguez said.
"This regime relies almost exclusively on foreign investment to
fund its operations," he said.
Despite the progress made since
the beginning of the school year,
the Swarthmore response to the
crisis are still at a formative stage.
"I've consulted with various
students including Mark [Hanis] in
particular, and I applaud their
efforts," political science professor
Raymond Hopkins said.
"This is a very difficult undertaking because of 'the collective
action problem.' We don't have a
regular agency in the U.S. focused
specifically on this type of action,
and there are issues raised of
American citizens attempting to
make their own foreign policy,"
Hopkins said.

After the outbreak of a small fire in a Wharton dorm room last
Thursday night, the second small building fire this month, the
threat of a dorm fire is once again being stressed to students.
The latest incident occurred when Katie Condon 'OB forgot to
unplug an electrical heating coil that she had attached to a plastic cup to boil water. The device burned through the still-connected plastic cup, which dripped onto an extension cord and
then into the carpet, causing the room to fill with smoke. This
triggered the room's smoke detector and eventually other
Wharton alarms, so that all residents had to evacuate the building. Marie Mark 'O5, the hall RA, heard the room's smoke detector, carefully opened the door, and pulled the hall's fire alarm
after seeing the situation.
Public Safety officers arrived at 7:25 p.m. after being alerted
about the situation through the central fire alarm system,
Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave said. They then notified
the Swarthmore Fire Company.
Redgrave said they discovered "small flames around the carpet
and electrical cord." After firefighters unsuccessfully tried to
stamp out the fire, they put out the fire with a dry-chemical extinguisher from Wharton's basement. The situation was completely
controlled by 8:46 p.m., and the only damage was a small hole in
Condon's carpet.

Condon's heating device, no longer functional, is prohibited by
the Student Handbook's fire regulations. Although the administration has yet to contact her about the incident, Dean of Student Life
Myrt Westphal said that Condon can expect an inquiry soon. "She
did somethingto call the administration's attention upon herself, so
we'll do something to attract hers," Westphal said. She was not yet
sure whether Condon will be warned or fined for the incident.
The fire itself highlighted the broader issue of students' and
the administration's response to fire-safety issues. Redgrave said
that the Public Safety officers arrived at Wharton less than two
minutes after being notified. The fire company, whose response
times have always been "exceptionally good," came promptly as
well. Redgrave also complimented Mark for handling the potential danger correctly and quickly guiding students out of the
building upon discovering the problem.
The college's policy is to notify the fire department if a fire
alarm is accompanied by confirmation of fire or smoke, The
Phoenix reported in 200 L Otherwise, Public Safety officers are
dispatched to assess the situation before a call is made. In addition, students are instructed to call Public Safety's emergency
line, 8333, rather than dialing 91L
Mark, along with all other RAs, learned the proper procedure
from Environmental and Safety Officer Paul Rodgers of Public
Safety, who instructs all RAs on fire-safety codes, behavior and
techniques in a two-hour training session during their orientation. Rodgers' instruction emphasizes that an RA's primary
responsibility is to get students out of the building. "They never
have to fight a fire if they don't feel comfortable," he said.
Nevertheless, in the training session, Rodgers simulated six
different types of fires and taught RAs how to subdue each of
them, and also provided complete instruction on how to use the
different fire extinguishers found in dormitories. The training
also included a video that simulates dorm room fires and a controlled use of the sprinkler systems in order to demonstrate their

full capabilities.
Mark described the session as "the most exciting and fun part
of training." Debbie Farrelly 'O6, the Willets Third South RA, said
that because of the session, she now feels "very comfortable" putting out a small, controllable fire.
One issue that still endangers campus fire-safety is student
apathy towards fire drills, described by Rodgers as "the biggest
threat" to student safety. Willets, notorious for its frequent, oftignored fire drills, had a good response-time and student turnout
on its first two fire drills this semester, according to Second South
RA Paul Thibodeau 'O6. Thibodeau, like Farrelly, actively tries "to
get everyone out of the building as quickly as possible," but both
acknowledged that the good performance early in the semester
might not be replicated once winter arrives.
Considering the dorm's reputation, Thibodeau admitted he
was "a little curious" why the administration did not offer specific advice for helping Willets RAs encourage students to leave the
building during all fire drills.
For the administration, the primary concern is compliance
with fire-safety rules. "I'm more worried about people putting
candles or incense in their rooms than Parrish's construction,"
Westphal said. "RAs aren't meant to be the fire-safety police but
are energized to promote fire safety, so we need the students to
comply."

Anti-Kerry film to
be screened in ville
BY IVAN BOOTHE

iboothel@swarthmore.edu

A documentary accusing presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry
of testifying to "lurid fantasies of
butchery in Vietnam" at a 1971
Congressional hearing will be
screened tonight in the borough of
Swarthmore, and will be sponsored

the Swarthmore Republican
Committee.
The film, "Stolen Honor:
Wounds that Never Heal," was the
by

subject of controversy two weeks

when Sinclair Broadcast
Group, a media conglomerate that
owns 62 television stations reaching nearly one-quarter of the country, announced it would pre-empt
network programming and air the
documentary as part ofits election
news coverage. After public outcry
and a precipitous drop in its stock

ago

prices, the corporation changedits
tack and instead aired an analysis

of the interplay between the media

and politics, using clips from both
"Stolen Honor" and the pro-Kerry

documentary, "Going Upriver: The
of John Kerry." Sinclair
owns two stations in Pennsylvania,
both in Pittsburgh.
Many are questioning the validity of the information presented in
the film. Political science professor
Jeffrey Murer said the film was
"full of patented lies" and yet being
presented as news.
"I am troubled by the counteraccusation that the film is just a
retort to Michael Moore," he said.
"It's just not true. One knows when
[Moore] is being pedantic. But the
entire film [of Stolen Honor] is
polemical, while claiming to be
objective."
Lisa O'Brien, chairperson of
the
Swarthmore
Republican
Committee, said she had "no idea"

Long War

what kind of turnout there would
be. But, she said, "if there is
demand, we will do it again at
8:30." The film is 43 minutes long.
A theater in Jenkintown, a suburb of Philadelphia, recently canceled a screening after its general
manager said police were concerned about the possibility of "civil
disturbances," The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported. And, indeed, on
the night the film was to be shown,
"an altercation between two wouldbe moviegoers" prompted a call to

the police.

Eva Barboni 'O6, president of the
said the group

College Democrats,

was planning to "attend and
respectfully voice our differing
opinions" at the Swarthmore film
showing.
"We will not attempt to disrupt
the event in any way, but we will
definitely be wearing Kerry-gear,"
Barboni wrote in an e-mail.
"Basically the goal is to have more
Kerry people there than Bush people."
College Republicans, O'Brien
said, were invited to the screening.
Maria Macia 'O7, the president of
the group, did not return calls for
comment.
While Murer did see these films
as examples of the ways in which
political campaigns have "deteriorated," he said they were indicative
of a larger and more promising
movement. "There's a push and
pull between two sides at the grassroots level," he said. "People are
more engaged and there's better
discourse about the election than I
have ever heard, at least in my lifetime."
The local screening will be held
in the borough hall, 121 Park
Avenue, at 7:30 p.m. It can be seen

ITS expands wireless service

Information
Services expanded its wireless
Internet service last Friday to
the Kohlberg coffee bar, the
Science Center commons and
College
the
Swarthmore
Computing
Society
Media
Lounge.

This second deployment of
wireless service focused on getting service to indoor areas
other than McCabe and Cornell
libraries where students and
student groups often convene.
Wireless service was first
offered about three years ago in
the libraries after dialogue
between librarians and ITS.
Positive feedback from students
and conversations between students and ITS during last winter's fireside chat indicated the
students' demand for wireless

service at other on-campus
sites, according to Jacobsen.
"Fifty percent of students

have laptops, and most laptops
have wireless capabilities," ITS
Client Services Manager Robin
Jacobsen said in an e-mail.
"Because of the obvious conveniences a wireless network
presents, ITS has added wireless in areas where students
gather," Jacobsen said.
In the past few years, the
SCCS Media Lounge had
planned to purchase its own
wireless Internet separate from
ITS after requests for wireless
services from ITS had gone
unanswered, SCCS Systems
Administrator

Fritz

Heckel

said.

Currently, service from the

SCCS Media Lounge does not
extend to the upper levels of
Tarble; and service also does
not extend to the immediate

outside

seating

areas

of

Kohlberg or the Science Center.
According to ITS Network
Administrator Bob Velez, the
placement of antennae for outdoor wireless services posed
aesthetic problems, so service
is restricted to the indoor areas.
"ITS has to come up with a
happy medium between where
[the antennae] work the best
and where they look the best,"

he said.
Further expansion of wireless service is still in early planning stages. Potential sites of
expansion include the area outside of the Science Center,
Parrish Beach and, upon its
completion, the newly constructed Parish commons area.
Velez explained that ITS will
be "looking for input from stu-

dents when details are more
concrete, but there have been
no discussions as of yet."

Hip-ocrite

Carrie
Bradshaw is ludicrous in everything from the dialogue she delivers
to her five-inch
Manolos, but she's
lovable none-theless. Swattie that I
am, once I'm done
girls' romantic mishaps and

vapidly tittering at the Sex
ogling Carrie Bradshaw's million dollar, multicolored,
delightfully impractical closet, my mind wanders to more
serious, metaphysical concerns. The question arises: Is

Carrie fabulous because of her wardrobe or does she have
her wardrobe because she's fabulous?
So many of us fall into the rut of wearing appropriate
clothing. When the most happening club you frequent is
Paces and your only torrid love affair is with Cornell, it
becomes hard to justify wearing anything more elaborate
than jeans or sweats. This is a mistake. Intentional or not,
everything you wear says something about who you are
they're called fashion statements for a reason. Apparel
should be chosen with care. When you take control of the
reactions you evoke in those around you, you're exercising
your ability to negotiate the terms of your reality. Dress for
the life you wish you had and you may just get it.
I, myself, live by this seemingly dubious but deceptively
effective philosophy. Annapolis, my hometown, is not exactly a posh, swinging place, but this summer I delusionally
decided that it was and dressed accordingly. My surroundings didn't matter; I put on fabulous threads and amazing

things just seemed to fall into place.
There was one fateful night, for example, while walking
along the dinky docks of Annapolis' inner harbor, my
accomplice and I stumbled upon a chartered party boat
(approaching but not quite reaching the level of yacht) that
was guarded by two bouncers. If we had been wearing jeans
and t-shirts, perhaps we would have kept walking, but we
just happened to be sporting fun dresses, stilettos, lace
Madonna gloves and Jackie O. shades, so we strutted past
the bouncers, who said not a word, and crashed the soiree.
Identity is such a transient thing. This summer I was
mistaken for a ballerina, a singer, a tennis player, a hippy
and my all time favorite British, all because of the way
I was dressed. Don't dress the way you're "supposed" to,
dress the way you feel. Tease your hair and the rock stars
will follow. To win a dance-off, sometimes all you need is a
sufficiently sparkly top. Choose an identity and fire at will.
If we change the quality of our appearances, maybe the
quality of life at Swarthmore will change as well. Just
because we're smart, goal-oriented people doesn't mean we
should be deprived the luxury of identities outside of our
workaholic selves.
A few of our fellow Swatties have taken a baby step in the
direction of accepting this credo by defiantly upturning the
collars of their Polo shirts. Although personally not a fan of
this look, I embrace it for what it represents. Popping your
collar is an expression of the way you see yourself: as pulledtogether, as entitled, as arrogant. Suited more for summering in Cape Cod than for perusing the pasta bar at Sharpies,
the collar-up look arguably has no place at Swarthmore. But
that's why it's so great.
A little known English Lord, the Earl of Dunraven, once
said, "If you want to destroy an aristocracy, cut off their collars, not their heads." Deny a man the right to dress like an
asshole, and you deny him an important aspect of his identity: his power. We must look past the dull realities of our
current Liberal Arts situation and transcend, embracing
whatever ridiculous garb we see fit.
Obviously, the connection between amazing occurrences
and amazing clothes is chicken-egg. The attitude and selfconfidence that allow a person to wear crazy clothes makes

her fabulous, and this fabulousness grows with every
miniskirt donned. Even if you don't feel like a size zero fashionista roaming the streets of NYC, slip into something scandalous and see how your world seems to change. If you want
to be fabulous, dress fabulously! Take my advice and, just
like Twista, I can make you a celebrity overnight.

Philadelphia can be a fun city by
night, but once a month, Northern

Liberties emerges as an artistic community, and the area suddenly has something to offer for those of us under 21.
First Fridays happen, as you might have
guessed, on the first Friday of every
month of the year. Art galleries open up,
most serving refreshments, and let the
public in free-of-charge to see their constantly rotating collections. DJs spin, people mingle, and the atmosphere seems

enough to catch the last train back from
Market East, so you can make it back to
campus in time to hit whatever parties
you don't want to miss.
Depending on where your interests lie,
there are numerous galleries to choose
from in Philadelphia
far too many for
me to describe in one column. If you're
interested in anything from oil paintings
and photography to sculpture, furniture
or design, Philly has the gallery to capture your interest.
Many galleries are structured around
artist-members, who pay dues and run
the galleries in return for annual or biannual exhibitions and a means through
which to sell their work. If you're a senior
art major, you just might want to fill out
an application to become a member yourself.
The Temple University Gallery,
located on North Second Street, houses

some of the most interesting and fun
exhibitions

in Philadelphia.

Generally

on one thematic element for
multi-artist shows, the space is packed on
First Fridays with students and their
friends, there to admire their friends'
pieces. Think of it as a bigger Kitao
Senior Exhibition, and you'll get the picture. The space itself is one of the larger
galleries in Philadelphia, but the feel
varies widely according to the exhibition.
centering

You'll not only get a good look at some of
the up-and-coming artists at Temple, but
you'll most likely get to meet them too,
since this is the Tyler School of Art's
main exhibition hall (they have two more
on their Elkins Park campus and another
on the main campus), and only the best of
the best art at Temple is displayed here.

DJs spin, people mingle,
and the atmosphere seems
more like a party than an
exhibition half the time.
Nexus, just one block further down on
Second Street, always promises a great
show, because you never know what
might happen there. Narrow and deeply
recessed, this cavernous space has been
used for anything from formal art shows
to fashion shows and was used throughout the past several Philadelphia Fringe

Festivals. The exhibits change monthly,
so you'll never see the same thing there
twice. Many artists on display there tend
towards modern aesthetics, and the use of
mixed-media exhibitions is fairly common. This gallery, in particular, has

October 28, 2004

shown a lot of

photography during my
visits, though you could run into anything at all.
The Muse Gallery is a great place to
view graphic arts, particularly painting.
Most of the artist-members are painters,
though there is the occasional sculptural
and mixed-media show as well. There are
many acrylic and oil painters on the roster here, as well as ceramic artists. The
annual group show, in which all current
members contribute one or several pieces
of artwork, provide a large breadth of
expression, and artists are usually there
to greet visitors and talk about their
work. Dedicated to art which brings
about socially conscious dialogues, this
gallery is one of the better-known, having
exhibited internationally as well as in its
space on Second Street.
These three galleries, all located on the
same street, will each show you a different side of the art scene in Philadelphia,
but they are simply a small slice of First
Fridays in the city. Take time to visit
every gallery you pass, because you really never know what you'll find inside.
After all, it's free. So go explore, and find

Who wasn't at the Aqua/Vengaßoys party a few
weeks back? Well, maybe those who wentto the sex
toy workshop that Friday. In any case, the party
was awesome. But it left us thinking: There's hooking up and there's going out. If you're not the type
that's into hookups, how would you find a girl to go
out with? What would you do if you liked a girl that
didn't go out to parties? What if you didn't like to
go to parties yourself? How would you find a date?
Communicating feelings can become very challenging, especially with shy people. It happens to
everyone. When Etan meets an awesome girl for
the first time, even he has difficulties communicating, despite his usual gregariousness. Often he
just ends up saying something stupid like, "Do you
have any work tonight?" or even worse, "What are
you up to?"
The other day at Cornell, Etan was sitting with
a few friends who couldn't stop talking about this
guy who liked this girl. Instead of saying something (i.e. "I like you"), he just hung around her
constantly. He invited himselfwhen she decided to
go out but he never talked; he just commented
briefly when spoken to. The guy was not having
fun, but insisted on staying for some unspoken reason. We're sorry, but that's weird.

The make-the-move-policy
doesn't always work. We can
recount many stories that
have resulted in vomit, a slap
in the face and a screwed-up
relationship.
But, weird as it is, we sometimes see ourselves
doing the same thing. That's not good; not good at
all. Is it the fear of rejection? Do we hope that the
other person might make the first move? Whatever
the underlying motivation may be, hanging
around waiting is not the solution. Those girls
Etan sat with in Cornell told him that the guy was
ruining his ease with the girl. In fact, she thought
he was pathetic. Chelsea thinks the guy should
have been much slyer. Etan thinks the girl needed
to give signals if she was getting annoyed.
Either way, the guy blew it. Why not just go up
to the girl and tell her you have a crush on her?

A portrait of the King of Pop back in his happier, lawsuit-free days. Jackson has most recently directed his
anger towards Eminem's new hit single, "Just Lose It."

October 28, 2004

Of course, Michael is a slightly different case. It's
hard not to have some amount of sympathy for a 46-yearold man who climbs trees and lives in Neverland, Maybe
BET's motive for banning the video was because of a
"don't kick him while he's down" mentality. If "Just Lose
It" had to be banned for anything, it should have been for
Eminem's pure repetition of video concepts with his
most infectious yet idiotic song to date. The chorus
alone, with its random incoherent babble, could give you
nightmares. So it's interesting that Jackson seems to be
so sensitive that he would let one of Eminem's worst singles propel him into another fight for character justice.
In the end, Eminem still effortlessly receives his
usual amount of controversial publicity for a new album
release. BET will consider its good deed done. And after
one triumph over the media "Powers That Be," Jackson
is keeping himself busy between court dates and acting
as a personal watchdog for icky things said about him in
public. It's just another wacky day in showbiz.

and then encouraging his three sons and pregnant wife to do
the same. Realizing that we were hanging out at a river bend
in Tennessee, we decided it was time to hit the road.
The tranquility of the mountains was interrupted
moments later when a friendly disagreement turned into a

two-hour fight. Emiliano insisted that Powerade, unlike
Gatorade, was lightly carbonated. Jon insisted that
Emiliano was a lying sack of shit and that the only difference was Gatorade's higher sodium content. We stopped at a
gas station where we clearly weren't welcome (well,
Emiliano wasn't) and purchased two bottles for our study.
As if reading the labels wasn't enough, Emiliano vigorously
shook the Powerade bottle for 20 minutes to test for "slight"
carbonation before turning the radio up and insulting Jon's
Canadian heritage.
As if Emiliano didn't feel stupid enough, Jon pointed out
that we'd be in New Orleans (for the breasts chicken, you

and maybe Alabama for a few days. Leave it to our dickhead

playing some bluegrass on the street. Family bands apparently form when Daddy loses his job to Third World labor
and exploits his children so he can pay his online porn subscription fees. Needless to say, the band sucked, but the ribs
were awesome

shared. The waiter said he was a "regular."
Nashville sucked, and we were pissed, so we decided to
head for New Orleans. It sounded like a good idea, until we
realized it was 9:00 p.m., we were over 500 miles away, and
we would have to drive through Alabama at night. Shit.
When that James Dean feeling wore off, we started thinking about where we might be able to stop along the way.
Suddenly, we remembered our large Hollandish friend
Bayne Heersink, formerly of the class of 'O5, who had transferred to the University of Alabama. We called our friend
Katie Schlesinger to get a cell phone number, but she said he
was likely vacationing in the fjords of Noraland, the magical
land of enormous white people. We called anyway, but got

the voicemail. Defeated again, we drove on. (Later, we'd find
out that Katie was a liar, and Bayne actually was in
Birmingham. We had missed his call.)
We had to stop for gas, so we looked for the best-lit rest
stop we could find. Two important things happened here.
First, Jon downed a Red Bull and two shots of Starbucks
canned espresso. Second, a local girl with a really cute tentooth tooth gap started stroking Jon's no Dave, not that
recently acquired mohawk. Enthused by the demonstration
ofhis manliness and by the caffeine, Jon decided it was time
to speed like he was racing. Emiliano noticed a maniacal
smile on Jon's face and asked, "Jon, why the maniacal
smile?" Jon twitched and said, "What? Nothing dude, nothing. Relax. Relax. Relax." Emiliano spent the next few hours
with his eyes glued to the speedometer, trying to convince
Jon to slow down. Given how fast we got to Mississippi, it
clearly wasn't working too well.
Some time around 3:30 a.m., Jon's caffeine failed him and
we needed to sleep, but Emiliano was crying like a girl at the
prospect of sleeping at a truck stop in Mississippi.
The conversation went something like this.
Jon: Oh look dude, a rest stop.
Emiliano: Shit dude. Where's my knife dude.

(Truck pulls over. Engine stops.)
Emiliano: Jon, look behind us. Is that dude wearing a
hood? Dude, give me the knife.
Jon: Dude, relax.
Emiliano: Easy for you to say dude, I am keeping this
kitchen knife right here on the dashboard
dude.
Eventually, we got some sleep. At 6 a.m. the next morning, Emiliano took the wheel and drove through to New
Orleans. On the bayou that morning, we looked at each
other, smiled, and let out a sigh of relief. While we would
never express it in words, that night, both of us had realized
how much we meant to each another. It was clear: The road
trip wasn't about the driving, the drinking or the breasts. It
was about those moments, those precious moments

The high school is Odessa-Permian High, and the
whole west Texas town of Odessa rests its hopes and
dreams on the football team. Based on H.G.
Bissinger's Pulitzer prize-winning account of OdessaPermian High's football team during the 1988 season,
the movie rarely ventures outside the terrain offootball fields and locker rooms. When it does, it's to provide much-needed tidbits of background information
concerning the lives of the Panthers' star players and
their coach. Still, the real star of the town is not the
coach (Billy Bob Thornton) or any of the players
the team itself is front and center.
Naturally, this lends itself to less-than-nominal
development of some of the players, but director Peter
Berg still manages to crack open the shell surrounding a number of the key players. Don Billingsley
(Garret Hedlund) is the tailback whosefather (played
by country singer Tim McGraw in a standout performance) was once a star player for the Panthers and
therefore doesn't hesitate to hurl verbal insults at his
son to whip him into shape. There's the quarterback,
Mike WincheE (Lucas Black), a player plagued by
thoughts of his terminally ill mother and by doubts
about his abilities. And then there's the coach, expertly played by Thornton, who understands the necessity of implementing both force and restraint in his
coaching tactics.

There's nothing in this fine entry
in the sports genre to make you
feel like your emotions have
been cheated once the theater
lights go up.
While these facets of the story are often swept up
in the visceral excitement surrounding the football
games themselves, it's hard to forget that there is
some substance to each of these players outside the
realm of football mania. As for the football games,
they're shot in incredible detail using hand-held cameras and extreme close-ups. You can feel the fervor
surrounding the details of every play, thanks in large
part to the efforts of cinematographer Tobias
Schliesser, who never skips a beat. It's fair to say that
you'll probably be holding your breath for a good five
or so minutes while you watch the expertly choreographed shots of this final game.
None of this would reahy add up to much more
than a whirlwindofflash photography if the aura surrounding the success of the team and football's place
in the hearts the community weren't so heavily
emphasized. The real drama does not unfold from
whether or not the Panthers win or lose. The real
drama plays itself out in the way the hopes and
dreams ofOdessa's citizens rest on a single sport. This
goes for both the players, who use football as a means
of getting college scholarships to get out of Odessa,
and the fans, who desperately need a stable element in
their lives to offshoot the inevitable doom of their
town and way oflife.
"Friday Night Lights" doesn't try to squeeze any
emotions out of you. The sheer spectacle of events surrounding the story and the context in which it plays
out are enough to make you feel for the Panthers
and, perhaps more importantly, a way oflife thatfinds
its strength on the field.

The new force in el ctions:

Clinton, Kerry attract tens of thousands in Philadelphia
By Benjamin Bradlow
Former President Bill Clinton’s return to the campaign trail with Democratic presidential candidate
John Kerry on Monday in Philadelphia’s Love Park was
akin to the return of a wounded hero to the battlefield.
Seven weeks after his triple-bypass heart surgery
operation, Clinton appeared with Kerry in the beginning of the last full week before the presidential election to help give the Kerry campaign an extra nudge in

the final stretch of the

campaign.

At its peak, the crowd numbered 80,000 to 100,000,
according to CNN estimates. “I was impressed by the
sheer size of [the rally]. I really wasn’t anticipating
that many people,” Arthur Chalmers ’O5 said.
Before Clinton and Kerry made their way to the
stage, which, instead of facing the majority of the
crowd that stretched lengthwise through Ben Franklin
Parkway, faced press cameras just on the other side of
the parkway, political
candidates from the
Philadelphia area each gave an obligatory Bush-bashing speech and ceded the stage to the next person in
line. Old-school union leaders, in their unique brand of

vote encouragement, advised rally attendees to “vote
early and vote often.”
Among the more prominent political stars making
an appearance were former Democratic presidential
hopeful Carol Moseley Braun, Democratic senatorial
candidate Joe Hoeffel and Pennsylvania governor Ed

He immediately seized on a news story broken by The New
York Times and CBS that morning that the U.S. Army had failed
to secure stockpiles of weapons when they first invaded Iraq. The
Bush administration “has miscalculated again and again and
again,” Kerry said.
Some felt that Kerry’s attack may have undercut Clinton’s
message. “One of Clinton’s main things was the dichotomy of
hope and fear
It weakened the argument when Kerry got up
and immediately started playing to fear,” Carrie Floyd ’O7 said.
Once he had sufficiently bashed Bush’s foreign policy, he

launched into a tirade about Bush’s domestic agenda arguing that
he could be more successful in both areas. “We need a president
who can defend America and fight for the middle class,” he said.
He also made light of Bush’s references to the job of president
as “hard work” during the first presidential debate. “I am impatient to relieve this president of that hard work,” Kerry said.
Perhaps wanting to counter the perception that the rally was
just about two figures
Kerry assured the

Shortly before Clinton and Kerry made their appearance, singer Patti Labelle surprised the audience with a
powerful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
Amid streaming confetti and Bruce Springsteen’s
“No Surrender” booming from speakers, Clinton and
Kerry climbed the stairs of the stage to roaring
approval from the crowd.
“If this isn’t good for my heart then I don’t know
what is,” Clinton proclaimed. Appearing in a plain
black suit that fit his newly skinny body following
heart surgery.
A stray “Clinton-Gore” sign from what many in the
crowd may have termed “the good ol’ days” often made its way
through the sea of “Kerry-Edwards” and “Philly for Kerry” signs.
“I noticed that most of the crowd wasn’t really there for Kerry,
but were there for Clinton,” Peter Gardner ’OB said.
Clearly aware of his cult of personality, Clinton was repeatedly
self-referential in his short introduction to John Kerry. “From time
to time I’ve been called the comeback kid. In eight days John Kerry
is going to make this country the comeback country,” he said.
Later he referred to “Clinton’s rules of politics” when he
said, “If one candidate is trying to scare you, and the other’s trying to get you to think; if one is appealing to your fears, and the
other is appealing to your hopes
it seems to
e you ought to vote for the person who
wants you to think and hope.”

in support of Kerry, which was relatively
subdued. “He didn’t speak for long and

What motivates young voters?
By Julie Baker and Benjamin Bradlow
After months of politicking, punditry and predictions,
this year’s presidential campaign is now in its final week.
Students and other young first-time voters could have a
major effect on the election’s result.
Many are arguing that students’ opinms are not being reflected in the multitude of polls now being released daily.
“One of the problem with the polls
is that they don’t call anyone whose
only number is a cell phone, and
that’s basically college students,”
Swarthmore College Young Demorats President Eva Barboni ’O6 said.
Such uncertainty begs the question:
What are the issues on which students are voting?

erties in a time of national crisis. I think these are the
most relevant issues for students because it’s a question
of ‘Do you grow up into a world that has as much liberty
as we need to have?’ It’s not an immediate issue, but it’s
important for students in deciding the kind of country
we’ll be living in,” he said.
Last year’s vice-president of the College Republicans,
Matt Meltzer ’06, noted that some students plan to vote on
single cultural issues. “I have a lot of friends at Villanova
who support Bush solely for the anti-abortion issue. There
are a lot of single-issue voters who focus on that,” he said.

“These trends about declining
voter involvement or an
uninformed electorate don’t
seem to hold true.”

The war in Iraq has dominated much of the campaign,
and it appears it is a major concern for students. Barboni
argued that the issue may have particular resonance
because of the specter of a draft associated with the war. “A
reason the war is so important is because of the possibility of the draft. People recognize that with Bush’s reckless
policies, it is entirely possible, if not probable,” she said.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry
has speculated that President George W. Bush’s policies
in Iraq would inevitably lead to a draft if he were to be
given a second term in office, but this accusation has not
made its way into Kerry’s recent stump speeches.
Republicans have countered this argument by saying that
Kerry’s plans to add 40,000 troops to the U.S. army are
equally likely to lead to a draft.
Political science professor Ben Berger attributed the
prominence of theoretical discussion of the draft to media
outlets primarily aimed at younger voters. “MTV is partially responsible for making the draft an issue,” he said.
MTV’s “Choose or Lose” campaign, designed to encourage younger voters to go to the polls, featured the draft
issue in a prominent ad campaign.
Berger sees the media as a prime factor in deciding
which issues will interest voters. “Iraq is really an enormous issue and another reason for this is the salience it
gets in mass media and entertainment,” he said.
American presidential campaigns, political science
professor Jeffrey Murer said, “are so scripted, they worry
far more about the image of the candidate than the candidate himself.” Films like “Stolen Honor,” an anti-Kerry
film, or “Going Upriver,” a pro-Kerry film, “are part of
this
this branding of American culture. We’re choosing
the brand John Kerry or George Bush,” he said.
The expectation that the next president could pick
three or four new Supreme Court judges also seems to be
an important decision-maker. “Because the [Supreme
Court] has become such an important entity in the past 50
years, it’s probably one of the most important issues to
me in the election,” College Republicans President Maria
Macia ’07 said.
Economics professor Bernard Saffran echoed this sentiment, especially in regards to the influence the Supreme
Court could have on the most pressing cultural issues of
the campaign, including abortion and same-sex marriage.
“The key issue is who serves on the court. I worry about
the ‘choice’ stuff and the gay marriage stuff and civil lib—

Barboni sees this as a major edge for Kerry in winning
the support of younger voters, as the Supreme Court

could have an effect on the major social issues of this
campaign. “Because college students are a lot more liberal on gay marriage especially, Bush’s position on the
Federal Marriage Amendment [which would have constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriage] turns off a lot of

college students,” she said.
In a poll of Swarthmore students last spring, just six
percent of respondents said same-sex marriage should be

illegal.
Berger saw students being drawn to Kerry because of

his domestic agenda. “Some of the basic provisions for
the poor and middle class, like health care, are generally
things that young voters relate to,” he said. “The issue of
distributive justice has struck a chord.”
Barboni saw jobs as a critical issue. “Job losses and
the economy have been big issues because when you’re at
it’s a scary prospect to graduate and not have a
college
...

job,” she said.
Political science professor Raymond Hopkins emphasized this point. “I don’t think students understand now

that their own job opportunities will be affected by this
election,” he said.
Though Barboni acknowledged that many of the jobs
lost during Bush’s presidency were in the manufacturing
sector, which most college graduates will not go into, “no
matter how the Bush campaign skews the numbers, tons
of jobs have been lost,” she said.
Berger argued that single issues do not affect voters as
much as a broad view of a candidate. “There’s a bunch of
single issue voters, but most vote on a generalized view of
things,” he said.
He saw student support for Kerry as emerging from
such an outlook. “The two most generalized, non-nuanced
views are the perception that Bush has made a hash of Iraq
and the second being a generalized sense that Bush’s
sense of distributive justice is not enough,” Berger said.
...

A renewed student energy

With such contentious issues lying at the heart of the

election, students are devoting time and energy to a variety of causes, primarily voter registration.

THE PHOENIX

The Swarthmore Voter Registration Coalition has
had major success on campus, registering about 1,000
Swarthmore students, approximately 700 of whom will
vote in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state in this
year’s election, according to SVRC president Ethan
Ucker ’O7.
According to Ucker, student involvement with SVRC
is high. “I’ve seen a noticeable change in the amount of
energy people have been putting towards this and how
there's been an
many students are willing to volunteer
enormous increase.
“It shows me that all these trends about declining
voter involvement or an uninformed electorate seem at
least here to be non-applicable. They don’t seem to hold
true. Or, this is also indicative of the fact that people recognize this is a very important election,” he said.
Barboni noted a similar boom in interest for more partisan efforts.
The College Democrats have “had a huge response to
our requests for volunteers for the Kerry campaign,” she
said.
In addition to voter registration drives, Swarthmore
students will be participating in a variety of “Get Out the
Vote” efforts on Election Day including those run by
SVRC, America Coming Together and MoveOn.org. ACT
and MoveOn are both left-leaning, independent “527
groups” that have been major forces in galvanizing support for Kerry in this election.

Trouble at the polls?

Barboni noted that historically, some students have
experienced challenges to their right to vote where they
reside at college. “There has been voter suppression
among college students
she said.

...

education is really important,”

She pointed out that if students are challenged at the
polls, they still have the right to cast a provisional ballot,
which will be counted if, upon further research, the county determines that they are registered to vote in the county in which they intended to vote. The commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has been airing radio ads with a similar
message.
According to Barboni, voters will have legal support at
the polls if they are challenged.
“There’s a whole network of lawyers across the country who are on call to help students or any voter who is
disenfranchised,” she said.
Berger argued that students will not affected by challenges at the polls as much as other groups. “I think it’s
mainly more poor and minorities [who are victims of
voter suppression] and those are the people who are more
itinerant,” he said.
Because such people may be more likely to move and
change addresses, they are more susceptible for being
challenged for voting in the incorrect place.
Berger

sees college students as being more sheltered

from voter intimidation in this election because of the
strength of the community in which they live, including
professors who can help protect students from being
manipulated at the polls.
According to Berger, such communities are likely to
be on high alert because of issues with vote suppression.
“College students have their own built-in advocates,”
he said.

The crunch of dead leaves underfoot on the walk
across campus. The overnight appearance of orange
streamers and sparkling pumpkin decor in Sharpies. The
last-minute sprint down Chester Avenue to Goodwill to
rummage through 1980s prom dresses, musty suits and
feathered hats. It's that time of year again, and as
Halloween spirit wafts through campus, students have
their choice of a multitude of candy-gorging, costumecrazy events.

The big one, of course, is the famed Mary Lyon
party. Mary Lyon RAs Wee Chua 'O6,
Rhiannon Graybill 'O6, Jawaad Hussain 'O5 and Olivia
Toro 'O5 have been planning the party since early
October.
The origins of the ML Halloween party are murky.
Graybill agreed that "it's been a big tradition," but she
didn't know exactly when it became one. "I know in the
60s ML was all [male]," she said, "and then I guess it was
a wild party dorm. So I don't know."
Whatever the history, "people know it's a fun party,"
Hussain said. "There's twice as many people there as
your typical Paces party, so we're working hard to make
sure people have a good time."
Hussain admitted that there is some pressure to put on
a party that was "better than previous years" but added
that the RAs have plans to improve the logistics of the
Halloween

party this year, specifically devising ways to alleviate
traffic between the lounge and the breakfast room, where
the party is held.
"We started talking about it during RA training,"
Graybill said, "but this week is when we do the big planning." Since so many people traditionally show up at the
party, Graybill said they receive more SAC funding most
parties: $9OO this year. To decide on a theme, Hussain
said, the dorm held a contest among ML residents. This
year's theme, "Scary Hawaiian Mary Lyon," was officially unveiled after an RA meeting Saturday afternoon.
"We'll probably have big Hawaiian flowers dripping
with blood or something," Graybill said. This week, she

12

said, involves getting music and decorations, publicizing
and logistics. The ML party organizers are putting particular emphasis on encouraging students to take the
shuttle to and from the party.
Although the initial planning and choice of theme
rests on the RAs' shoulders, a large part of the Mary Lyon
dorm helps with decorations and setup.
Mark Kharas 'OB, an ML resident, said the party

"should be interesting."

"When I first got on campus I was talking about how
people on campus don't get down to ML," he said, "and
everyone said, 'Wait until the Halloween party." Mary
Lyon people are an interesting breed. If they're going to
throw a party, it'll be a good one."
Since the party is scheduled for the night before
Halloween, Mary Lyons will be open for trick-or-treating
for Ville kids and Swat students on Sunday evening.
Willetts is also hosting dorm-wide trick-or-treating on
Sunday night.

"We'll probably have big Hawaiian
flowers dripping with blood or
something."

"We're going to tell people in Willetts to dress up and
have candy and tell them to bring friends," Willetts Third
North RA Jason Lee 'O6 said. "We wanted to have it so
that people can go out and trick-or-treat and then come
back here and do some more."
Lee said the trick-or-treating would be a good chance
for the whole dorm to mix together, which he said "doesn't happen enough." As for supplies of candy to hand out,

For students who don't plan on subsisting solely on
candy this weekend, Sharpies is having "a bit of
Halloween fun," said Scott Tutton, back-of-house manag-

er of Dining Services. Halloween-themed decorations are
gracing the walls of the dining hall, and contests and
prize giveaways are being held at Essie Mae's until

Halloween.
Along with a daily trivia contest
asking questions
such as, "What country celebrates the Day of the Dead?"
and a "guess the number of candies in the jar" contest
to test the estimation skills of every customer, the snack
bar will be having random winners of mini-prizes at the
snack bar all day Friday.
"Sometimes it will be a person standing in line at a
certain time, sometimes everyone sitting at a certain
We just wanted to have a little
table, stuff like that
fun," said Tutton, who is in his first year managing the
snack bar.
Tutton said staff will be dressed in costumes giving out
candy on Halloween night, and students will be encouraged to dress up as well.
Sharpies has traditionally put on a haunted house
every other year, with this year being an on-year for the
event, but "with Halloween being on a Sunday, it proved
to be too scary a scheduling nightmare," Tutton said.
Lee remembered the Sharpies haunted house two
years ago as "a lot of fun. The Sharpies staff went all out

and scared us."
Linda McDougall, director of Dining Services, promised "special treats and desserts," though, and said students should look for the haunted house next year.
With Halloween events covering most of this weekend,
students have little excuse to ignore the holiday festivinot that that seems to be the case. Most students

relish the opportunity to relive the trick-or-treating days

tale, the Monkey King, representing Xuan Zang, is a rebellious, highly intelligent
creature who learns kung fu and magic tricks from a Taoist master and consequently earns powerful abilities with which to fight his enemies. With powers of
transformation and his magical iron rod stolen from the Dragon King of the
ocean the Monkey King fights his way from the heavens to hell and back
again. Follow him on his adventures this Friday night, with a performance by

Time off to vote
As this year's election draws nearer, many have
noticed an optimistic trend: Voter registration is up significantly this year, especially among America's youth.
Many partisan groups have increased their efforts to
draw new voters into the political process, placing an

increased emphasis on getting students to register and
volunteer to help get out the vote.
Here on campus, students have spent months gearing
up for the election. A new organization, the Swarthmore
Voter Registration Coalition, has worked unceasingly
toward the goal of turning every Swarthmore student
into an informed, motivated voter and making sure that
as many people in this crucial swing state have a voice
in the election as possible. They've canvassed this whole
area, registering new voters down the road in Chester
and in surrounding areas. Furthermore, Martin Warner,
the registrar, has gone beyond his federally mandated
responsibilities in providing students as many resources
as possible to register and travel to vote next Tuesday.
Yet despite this local enthusiasm for the election,
most of the administration is acting slowly to make it
easier for students to vote without compromising their
duties to Swarthmore College. While this week two students gathered over 400 signatures after just two hours of
Sharpies tabling in support of scaling back operations on
Election Day, the administration's only response was to
announce it would consider the issue some time in the
next few days. Students were told it was entirely their
responsibility to obtain excused absences from their professors if they planned to volunteer at the election.

Is this apathetic response really the message the
administration wants to send about the importance of
participation in democracy? The administration should
have been considering these questions before students
brought them up, at least seriously entertaining the suggestion to have a schoolwide voting holiday for this
year's election. It would have been easy to schedule a
make-up day of classes in December; we already do that
for classes missed due to Thanksgiving. For many students, this election and the real political consequences it
will bring for us are more important than one American
holiday celebration. If this is too drastic a step, the
administration should at least encourage professors to
cancel classes and release non-essential staff for the day.
In an age when declining voter participation is often
denounced as an epidemic that threatens our democracy,
our college should do everything it can to reverse that
trend.

Schall's stonewalling on Sharples
apology by me,

Submissions policy

to

bring up an important point in their
letter ("Staff shouldn't fear retaliation," Oct. 21, pg. 15) that no employees
are on record as having been fired for
speaking their minds. While I understand that this is official college policy,
there are ways in which employees can
be dismissed from their positions that
may hide the underlying reasons for
their dismissal. Human Resources
does not hear all of the concerns that
are raised by the employees, mainly
because they are afraid of raising
them. The jobs that the staff have at
Sharpies are extremely important to
them. They need to work to pay the
bills, put food on the table and pay the
rent or mortgage. Without their jobs,
they would have nothing. This is why,
the day after my original letter
("Managers mistreat Sharpies staff,"
Sept. 30, pg. 10), one of the staff members I mentioned was crying when I
saw her the day the letter came out,

fearful of losing her job.
I must also address the Allan
Friedman 'O2 made in his letter
("Alberti should apologize for accusations," Oct. 21, pg. 15). I do agree with
his point that the managers do know
October 28. 2004

their employees and that "no working
relationship is perfect." However, this
is certainly no excuse for the behavior
by the managers that I witnessed and
reported in my letter. I also clearly
remember, as many staff members do,
the comment Linda McDougall made
last year living wage panel, that she
prefers "to give [staff] food over money,

because [she knows] where the food's
going, but [she doesn't] know where
the money's going" ("Living Wage collection incites controversy," March 25,
pg. 6). Despite what others may say, I
personally witnessed all these events
and have spoken with many staff mem-

bers at Sharpies who feel they have
been mistreated in similar ways. Why
else would a staff member, when asked
about my previous letter, say, "If I didn't work here, I would say it's all true"?
Granted, not all of the management
treat the staff poorly, but there are a
few bad apples spoiling the barrel, and
I most certainly will not apologize for
what I've said about them; after all, the
staff have not received any apologies,
nor has anyone taken any action.
In fact, when this issue was brought
to the attention of the administration, I
received a very sharp, stinging reply
from Larry Schall denying that these
things happen down at Sharpies and
claiming that my letter "was one of the
worst pieces [he had] ever read." I cannot see how to hold a productive dialogue

with opinions such as this. After

I discussed the issue with Schall, he
continued to refuse to take any proactive measures, insisting that employees must still come forward and
address their concerns directly to him
directly or Human Resources.
When I initially wrote my letter to
the editor, my intention was to focus
the community's attention on what I
and many others saw as an important
issue. I did not intend to cause anyone
to fear the loss of his or her job, to provoke a backlash from the administration and alums, or to face this
stonewalling by the management. I
was hoping that a dialogue could be
established that would allow for my
concerns and others' to be addressed in
a productive environment that could
lead to change. Thi's does not seem to
be happening. While Oriana GalardiEste 'O6 stated in her letter ("Sharpies
conflicts may be isolated, personal,"
Oct. 7, pg. 13) that such conflict occurs
"in normal work environments," at
Swarthmore I thought we were above
that. I thought that here, we set a higher standard, that we strove for equality
for all people, for justice.
These are all ideals present within
many of us. If we believe in them, let's
put them into action. Let's not have
Sharpies be "the average workplace"
but be a better workplace, where staff
and managers get along and respect
each other better.

rights that come with marriage. Bush does not. The flyer

BY SCOTT TANNER

stannerl@swarthmore.edu

Over the past few weeks, posters from the Swarthmore
College Libertarians have been creeping onto various
informational boards throughout campus. I even saw one
taped to a trash can in Parrish Hall. It appears that the
Libertarians were unable to actually get the signs inside
the trash can, where they rightfully belong.
One flyer I kept on seeing was particularly disturbing
because its statements were misleading and overtly generalized. It is a side-by-side comparison of Bush and
Kerry's records and belief systems that aims at painting
the two candidates as the same man. This is simply not
true. The flyer says suggests that both are supporters of
the PATRIOT Act by saying that Bush signed it while
Kerry voted for it. This is true, and Bush is still a strong
supporter of everything in it. Kerry, however, is for
changing parts of it. For example, Kerry is for repealing
the library search clause and requiring the government

to obtain a warrant in order to search someone's library
records. He will also seek more evidence before starting
"sneak-and-peek" operations. Bush is for none of this. He
is for John Ashcroft's brand of abusing law enforcement
and violating civil liberties. Kerry is not.
The flyer suggested that both Bush and Kerry oppose
gay marriage. This is also true, but again the issue is far

more complex. President Bush supports a constitutional
ban on gay marriage while Senator Kerry does not. Kerry

also says that both candidates support gun control.
Senator Kerry does, while President Bush does not. Bush
allowed the federal ban on military-style assault weapons,
guns whose stylings fetishize the mass killing of human
beings, to expire on Sept. 13, 2004. Kerry has pledged to
renew the ban and also close the gun show loophole in the
Brady Bill. He will also create a task force of U.S. attorneys to fight interstate trafficking of guns.
They accuse Kerry of wanting to deficit-spend. This is
necessary, given that Bush's tax cuts mainly to the top
onepercent of Americans have caused revenue to drop. If
we are to keep Social Security and Medicare while still
providing for a military that is serving honorably, for an
education system in dire need of more aid, and many
other federal programs, we will need to deficit-spend for
the next few years at least. Kerry, however, has proposed
to cut the deficit in half by rolling back the Bush tax cut
for the very wealthy. So the Libertarians are misconstruing Kerry's plan by claiming he "will raise taxes directly."
He will, but on the wealthiest 1 percent.

These posters end with the words "Where's the
Debate?" I think the ongoing debate between Kerry's and
Bush's policies is quite clear. One should read the party
platforms and the different plans and then make up one's
mind, and the Libertarians should not resort to generalizations and sound bites to attack any candidate's real
and nuanced positions.

Dear Editor:

win, and then we'll keep on playing to win. Boston will
not drop off the map if and when the Sox win it all, though
the city might burn to the ground and will certainly be
visible from space for several weeks. Each playoff victory
is celebrated by Sox fans the way other teams' fans celebrate an entire World Series win, with a little extra rioting thrown in. This is why they say Boston winning the
World Series would bring the Apocalypse.
The reason is simple. Only we can feel this victory so
sharply. It is because we have a long history that has left
many agonizing scars, because the wounds from last year
still burn, because we have learned to have hope when we
should be jumping off the brand-new overpriced Zakim
bridge. The exhilaration of the moment that we win will
be better than any drug-induced high, better than any
orgasm. We root because we know that someday our team
will make us unimaginably happy. We've been through
the worst, and then we've been through worse, and it's
these 86 years that will give us a euphoria like no other.
And then, when it is all said and done and the ultimate
goal has been fulfilled, I know that most in the Red Sox
Nation will return to Fenway with the same regularity.
The love will not leave, the desire for victory will always
be strong, and the Sox will still be a huge part of our lives,
communities and identities. There is a bandwagon, but
there are also hundreds of thousands of loyal fans. We'll
always be there for the Sox, World Series victory or not.

Electoral politics: Joke's on us

Eleven wins are required to win it all in the baseball
post-season. As of press time, the Red Sox have ten wins,
and are on the verge of winning it all for the first time
since 1918 (we aren't afraid of that year anymore.) With all
due respect to Alex Ryan-Bond 'O7 from Maryland, whose
columns are usually insightful and entertaining, I have to
disagree with pretty much everything written in the fatalistic "Red Sox Destiny" (Oct. 7, pg. 18). As a native
Bostonian who has lived within 15 minutes of Fenway
Park the last 18 years and watched over 100 games at the
park the past four years, including two World Series
games, I think I might be slightly more qualified to discuss the "psyche" of my own city and fellow fans.
To a man, the 2004 Boston Red Sox fought and scraped
to get here, and led by Curt Schilling's mantra of "Why
Not Us?
If 25 Men Believe They Can, They Will," they
showed every desire to get that ring. The 2004 team is better than the one we fielded last year, which but for a certain inaction by he-who-shall-not-be-named would have
made it to the top. This year we were ready. Yes, we are
harsh and unforgiving, but that is because we care more
than Alex or anyone else who is not a long-suffering member of the Red Sox Nation can imagine.
This is where Alex entirely misses reality. Boston is
not "built upon the belief that the Red Sox can't win the
World Series"; rather the city's collective identity is predicated upon a fervent belief that we can win and we will

which I have in the past been a vocal participant, regarding
the attitudes surrounding minority opinions on campus
Though I and others have suggested that certain students and
faculty unfairly look down upon conservative beliefs, neve
have I nor any rational member of this community suggeste(
that we remove politics from our ongoing campus dialogue.
Swarthmore is not harmed by some illusory fear of polit
ical quarrel. Speaking from very personal experience, few
people here have acted to ensure that I am "treated 'equally
"

though Cristol fails to define equality in this context

Cristol implies that it is "no more the responsibility of a
supremely left-leaning campus to make sure right-wing opin
ions are equally represented as it is a New York hig]
school's responsibility to give equal support to the Red Sox
in the ALCS." Perhaps I take my politics a bit seriously, bu
how are the results of a baseball game in any way compara
ble to the resolution of issues that shape the well-being of th

American people?
To discount political choice in this way is to trivialize th
value of the diversity of opinion that induces the debates tha
result in the creation of new domestic and foreign policies
The problem is not that Swarthmore students believe strong
ly in their chosen political ideals. The problem is that they
often refuse to acknowledge that rational thought by their
peers could result in an entirely different set of ideals. It i
this problem that Cristol fails to grasp. As a Republican, I do
not feel it necessary to be treated "equally." What is essentia
is an acknowledgement that my beliefs are reasonably

informed.
This is not a freedom of speech issue. This is an issue o
selective ignorance. I do not hesitate to say that Swarthmor
liberals lump Republicans in the mold of "Red State" Bible
thumping, gun-toting rednecks. Yet I do not fit this mold in th

least; I am from the Northeast, I am a Jew and I have neve
fired a gun. I am as much an intellectual as any Swattie who
looks down his or her liberal snout at what he or she assume
to be my ignorant, misinformed ways. Acknowledge the fac
that I am not the stereotype of what many here would prefe
to think Republicans to be before choosing to ignore my opin
ions or engage them. Cristol is wrong to assert that those in

the political minority expect equal representation. All I ask
perhaps overly optimistically, is the acknowledgement tha
contrary political opinion is as valid a choice as those made
by Swarthmore's political mainstream.
Political decisions are not only deeply personal, but also
fundamentally more important than many others. Debate
regarding political decisions shapes the path of our country

and the future well-being of Americans. Unlike Cristol, how
ever, I accuse no one on this campus of wanting to avoid polit
ical discussion to preserve equality. Though he purportedl>
wrote his column due to a "beef... with all of you," I challenge
Jeremy Cristol to provide the name of a single person who ha
embodied the fictitious mindset that he claims is so detri
mental to our community.

Losing lives, screwing up
international relations, deporting Cat Stevens ... there are lots
of reasons not to like the War on
Terror. However, no one has
talked much about the destructiveness of the military budget
in The Phoenix, so I'm going to.
Money, although boring, often

decides our fate, especially at
the current financial crossroads: bombs and other killware on one side; health care,
education, Social Security and
MAYA SCHENWAR jobs on the other.
Three
into the War on
Swat Meets World Terror, ouryears
engagements in Iraq
and Afghanistan have depleted
our troops and our budget.
Kerry expects that the war will have cost $2OO billion when
it's all over
and that's a hopeful estimate.
Our national deficit is now at record levels, thanks to the
winning combination of a pricey War on Terror and tax cuts
for the rich. And, as we witnessed during the recent debates,
neither Bush nor Kerry has any answers. Bush's plan: "I
send up my budget man to the Congress and he says, 'Here's
how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.'"
Kerry was slicker but not much more informative, telling
America, "You are my priority." Thanks, man. You're my
priority too, but I have no idea how to balance your budget.

The United States' position as a world
leader is not God-granted, no matter
how many times we tell him to bless
America.
Cutting costs will be especially tough since both candidates promise to increase military spending from its current whopping $4OO billion a year in order to maintain our
position as Toughest Guy in the World. Unfortunately, it's
not a money-back guarantee. Building up our army will not
only stagnate the progress of real peacemaking and make us
even less popular on the BBC, it may decrease our scariness
factor. Put in plain, Bush-esque terms, it will make us poor.
(It will also make some of us dead, which should be at least
as important to both candidates.)
It's hard to make a case for deterrence against Iran,
Syria and North Korea when we barely have enough to fund
our current operations. A slew of reports have recently
revealed that troops in Iraq were not provided with adeclearly a sign
quate body armor and other protective gear
that the dollars were running thin. At the end of September,
Bush dipped into the $25 billion emergency fund, a stash
that was not supposed to be used until next year. By the
time the rainy day comes, the fund could be completely
exhausted.
The military budget shortage means that we'll be
borrowing even more capital from Japan, China and Europe
key allies that we've incidentally been neglecting as
we've lately focused our foreign policy on Iraq and
Afghanistan. Each year our dependence on international
funding sources increases, weakening the economic foundation of our "superstanding" in the world.
The rest of the world isn't holding its economic breath for
us, either. In the past five years, India's economy has
exploded (in a good way) and the country has become a viable
player in the global economy. The euro has taken hold and is
hanging on; the E.U. now rivals the U.S.'s financial giant status. And China has jumped back into the world power game,
throwing in a bid for the 2008 Olympics and joining the
Group of Seven that masterminds the world economy.
The United States' position as a world leader is not Godgranted, no matter how many times we tell him to bless
America. Our power is mostly composed of dollar signs.
Maybe it's time to concentrate our monetary energy on
patching up our internal ailments and strengthening our
non-military relationships with our international buddies,
working toward solutions that would save both dollars and
lives.

Defending extroverted customs
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Katharine Merow 'o6's letter "Fight Enforced Extronomativity" (Oct. 21, pg. 16).
Although Merow's general message is valid, that extroverted people should not label as unfriendly or "incurably antisocial" those who do not offer greetings in the
form of smiles, nods or hellos, I do take issue with part of

her argument.
As an "extrovert" myself, I can say that we by no
means greet "every living soul" on the Swarthmore campus. However, seemingly random encounters do occur
when two previously unacquainted people approach one
another. If both individuals are alone, no matter how
deep their "profound train of thought" might be, it is
highly unlikely that neither will notice the presence of
the other. Here, an extrovert might make eye contact and
then let out a small smile or nod, which, contrary to
Merow's letter, is intended neither to "validate other people's existence" nor, as Alex Ginsberg 'OB wrote ("Would
a smile and nod kill you?", Oct. 7, pg. 16), as an expression
of "happiness and approval." In this situation, a smile is
no particular indication of happiness, but simply an
acknowledgement of the other person. I would agree
with what Debbie Farrelly 'O6 said to me, that it is "not
natural" to look the other way and pretend that you do
not see the fellow human being walking toward you.
Perhaps introverts are not inclined to first make eye
contact or initiate an interaction. However, if the person
coming towards you does smile or nod, does it really
matter if you've ever been formally introduced or have

October 28, 2004

previously interacted? Do you really have to solve this
irrelevant quandary prior to acknowledging his
presence in return with a small nod or fleeting smile,
thereby determining post-acknowledgement where you
might have met before? Undoubtedly, we've all been in
the situation where by the time we realized we've been
smiled at, the person has long passed us and we've failed
to respond. But, unless one has a chronically slow reaction time, in the majority of instances one does register
quickly enough to reply.
Also, Swarthmore is a place that accepts and respects
diversity, but it is imperative to realize that Swat is not
representative of the world at large. In the world outside
Swarthmore, if someone smiles at you and you consistently do not respond, it will most likely be interpreted

as unfriendliness or arrogance even if, as Merow points
out, this is unintended. It does not particularly bother us
here if you do not smile back, nor do we usually feel, as
Merow suggests, "devalued as a person," but to many
outside Swat, you might indeed come off as anti-social.
Introverts and extroverts alike need to be aware of
unavoidable social norms (every culture has them), and
to take responsibility for how they are interpreted by
others.

Personally, I think that a smile can never hurt, especially as the mere acknowledgement of another human
being. Perhaps I've read a tad too much "Chicken Soup
for the Soul," but you never know how great an impact a
small smile can have on a complete stranger.

a

win for the squad.

put
Chloe
Lewis
Swarthmore on the board in the

first minute of the game, giving
the Garnet the momentum it
needed to keep Haverford in
check. The Fords rallied around
freshman attacker Sarah Walker,
who netted the tying goal with
just over 11 minutes left in the
game.
With the win, the Garnet
improve to 3-6 in the conference
and 8-7 overall. The victory also
gives Swarthmore a point in the
race for the Hood Trophy.
Currently, the Garnet and the
Squirrels are tied 1-1 in the annual competition.
Earlier this week the team took
a break from its losses with a win
against Bryn Mawr before falling
again to Muhlenberg. With a conference record of 0-8, Bryn Mawr
was, as Joanna Hess 'O5 said, a
"comfortable" game. "We didn't
have to go very far for it," she said.
The game against Muhlenberg,
ranked only one position above
Swat in the conference, was a dis-

appointing loss. "We know that
most of the teams in our conference are good" Hess said, "and we
don't take them lightly".

Hess broke the game down
into "what could have been" and
"the pitfalls of turf".
"I think that we caused a lot of
for
scoring
opportunities
Muhlenberg. We just didn't capitalize on any of them," she said.
"Against Bryn Mawr, we had
some great moments both on
offense and defense." Hess
acknowledged the work of the
team's offense, "Kat Athansiades
['os] had a great stroke towards
the end of the game, and that was
exciting," she
said. "People
played well in the offensive circle:
everyone had their sticks down."
As for the playing field: "They
are a turf team, with a really good
passing game, and they used that
to their advantage here," Hess
said. "Muhlenberg's a skilled
team- and since they play on turf,
there's a lot of running, faster
running, involved. It requires better, more precise stick skills."
This game is familiar to the Tide,
who practice on a home turf field.
"It's more what we're trained for,
and the kind of game we play is
more controlled," she said.
Despite fluctuating performances and missed opportunities,
however, the Tide feltbetter about
the way it has played. Karen

as a springboard for next year.

about
Haverford. "We have three more

Show some
Tide pride
BY TARIQ FISCHER
tfischel@swarthmore.edu

Screw Haverford.
Now, I do not mean that in the "Swat is so ridiculously
superior to those scrubs that I don't even have to acknowledge their existence" sense. "Screw Haverford" means that I
believe in delivering the most agonizing, humiliating, soulcrushing defeats possible to the Fords. I want to rub their
face in our every success, whether in volleyball, field hockey,
basketball, debate or Iron Chef-style cooking showdowns.
Why? Haverford is Swarthmore's rival. Call me biased,
but we are everything they wish they could be and they are
everything we hope never to become.
Except for maybe one thing. As Darcy Nelson's article on
the Hood Trophy ("Hood Who?" September 9, 2004) described,
Haverford students are far more focused on dominating this
rivalry than we are. Instead of a powerful "Hell yeah!" from
Swatties in response to "Screw Haverford," I am more likely
to get a yawn and a mumbled, "Who cares?" Many Swatties
are content to point to US News rankings in their dismissal of
"that other school," apathetic about the fact that Swarthmore
has not won the Hood Trophy, the annual symbol of athletic
superiority between the two schools, since 1995.

I want to rub their face in our every
success, whether in volleyball, field
hockey, basketball, debate or Iron
Chef-style cooking showdowns.
Have you ever heard of the Hood Trophy? Swarthmore, our
collective apathy, is making this rivalry disappear. The yawners might even question if this is even a bad thing.
This is indeed A Very Bad Thing. Why? Because rivalry
makes you better than you are.
Think about it. Would Larry Bird have been etched into
basketball memory without his intense duels with Magic
Johnson? Would anybody outside of Boston care about this
year's ALCS if not for years of disappointment and hatred
toward the Yankees? In sports, rivalry games force players to
perform at a higher level than they otherwise would ever
reach. The Magic/Bird rivalry transformed the NBA from a
"minor" professional sport into the cash cow that it is today.
This year's Red Sox/Yankees series drew record ratings for
Major League Baseball, a league that had not yet fully recovered after the 1994 strike.
Outside of sports, rivalries have exactly the same effect.
Without this year's hotly contested election, the average dinner conversation would not force Americans to provide a solid
defense of their beliefs. The ideological battles that occur on a
daily basis at Swat would never occur if we had were as apathetic about politics as we are about our own athletics.
Okay, so the argument goes, Swarthmore is just not an
athletically inclined school. Wrong again.
Mary Lyon hosts Philadelphia Eagles study breaks. A sizable portion of the student body plays one of 22 varsity sports.
And last Saturday, I could not find a single cable television in
Wharton where I could watch the Georgia/Arkansas college
football game. Why? Not because of a political debate, but
because practically every student on campus was glued to the
Red Sox game. Swatties care about sports, just not
Swarthmore sports. That needs to change.
If you are willing to pay to see Terrell Owens catch a
Donovan McNabb touchdown pass, why not go see a buddy
score the winning basket or goal for free?
Swatties made an active decision to attend our school. What
better way to celebrate that decision than by supporting Swat
athletics? Reviving the rivalry with Haverford is the first step.
One sophomore I interviewed for an article on the soccer
team explained that "I support the team, but I just don't care
enough to go to the game." My biggest fear is that the average
Swattie shares this attitude. The men's soccer team plays
Haverford this Saturday in their regular season finale. Go to
the game. Scream until you sound like Joan Rivers after a tracheotomy. Revel in the superiority of your school. Watch, our
rivals get smacked around like Vanilla Ice in a meeting with
Suge Knight.

Garnet volleyball falls short of comeback
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

It would have been almost too
good to be true. The Garnet volleyball team was on the verge of
pulling out a Red Sox-like victory
over rival Haverford Tuesday night,
coming back from being down 2-0 to
tie the score at 2-2. The Fords managed to regain their momentum and
take the final game, but not before
Swarthmore sent the message that
it is not to be taken lightly.
After Haverford went up 30-25,
30-21 on its home court, it appeared

a sweep was looming. But the
Garnet showed tenacity as it fought

back by winning the next two
games, 30-26 and 30-22. The comeback fell just short, however, when
the Fords pulled out the final game,
15-9 to clinch the match.
"It was a great match," coach
Harleigh Leach said. "It's just a little disappointing that we weren't
able to finish in the fifth game."
Though Swarthmore turned it
around in the third and fourth
games, Haverford had a strong run
at the end of the fourth that gave it
the momentum going into the final
game, Leach said.
Despite the loss, coming so close
to beating Haverford on its home
turf was an accomplishment for the
Garnet, which has a history of
falling to the Fords when facing
them as visitors.
"We went in knowing [the history of the rivalry] and knowing how
to beat
great it would be
Haverford," Darcy Nelson 'O6 said.
Though the team came up shy in the
end, a number of impressive individual performances brightened the
outcome for the Garnet.
Key to the Garnet's charge were
two young, yet dominating, players,

Erica George 'O7 and Katie Gold 'OB.
George has been an offensive force
for the Garnet all season, and added
19 kills to her team-leading 309 kills
on the season. She also recorded 30
digs in the match.
Gold, who missed the early part
of the season due to an ankle injury,
has been making up for lost time
,despite the fact that she is not completely healed. Against Haverford,
she had 31 digs and contributed 14
kills. Leach had nothing but praise
for Gold after the match.

File Photo

Natalie Dunphy blocks at the net as Katie Gold readies to dig an attack.
"Katie has played a great couple
matches," she said. "She's just an
aggressive athlete. I'm really excited for the future with her being just
a freshman." Leach has plenty to be
excited about, with two other first
years, Vanessa Wells and Karen
Berk, also making significant contributions this season. Co-captain
Emiiy Conlon 'O6 added 48 assists in
the match.
The loss brought the squad's
record to 9-17 on the season and 2-8
in Centennial Conference games,
meaning the Garnet will not be one

These two athletes will be honored
before the game in part of a team

tradition.

"The honor is definitely well
deserved," Leach said. "Those two
individuals have done a lot to set a
standard for our program. They
are going to be missed a lot."

Andrew Terker 'O6 played hero for

Swat into the playoffs.
Coach Eric Wagner phoned from
the bus on the way home to describe
Terker's fabulous first goal. "We had
a long throw-in. Marty [Griffith 'os]
received it and flipped a pass to
Terker, who headed it home," he
said. The Tide dominated the first 20

minutes but, as Wagner explained,
"we gave them more chances than

they should have gotten."
Ursinus capitalized with 20 seconds left in the first half, scoring off
a header to tie the game. Terker

some key senior leadership in the form of a moon-walkin

This is obviously some kind of mistake.

we're the game that gets overlooked in the schedule and the
maybe we pull of an upset, right? We certainly don't compet
for playoff spots and we definitely aren't the team to beat i

Something needs to be done about this issue, since it i
simply ruining our reputation as a fine academic institution
If the men's soccer team keeps on winning and (gasp of hor
ror) builds a reputation as a good team in the conference 1
could have lasting repercussions on Swarthmore's preciousl
guarded academic integrity.
Think about it, folks. The effect this could have o
Swarthmore would be enormous, and that fun piece of pape
you get after four years of hard work with no cable or air con
ditioning and crappy food and the occasional bout of wor
induced insanity could be totally devalued. If soccer gets rea
ly good there could be a disastrous domino effect on all ou
other sports, because everyone knows how that theory wa
effectively proven by the spread of communism in the las
century. We need to be like Ike and act now.
Soccer has got to go. That's right, just cut the entire dam
sport, including the women's team, since they are the mos
likely team to come down with a sudden infection of goo
play, seeing as it is the same sport and all. If we allow thi
thing to creep slowly through our sports department w
might look down the road five, 10 or even 20 years from now
and we might end up with a good athletics program, and the
our whole academic reputation would be shot to hell becaus
everyone knows jocks can't think and don't contribute
damn thing to this fine institution (like Nobel prizes).
To those of you who think this solution is somewha
extreme, I say that you are simply unversed in the history o
Swarthmore's Athletics program. In the past we have not hes
itated to jettison up and coming teams in order to protect ou
academic integrity, cough, football, cough cough (sorry I mus
have a cold). And since that worked out so well, I don't se

cutting soccer as being a problem for us at all.
And on a pragmatic note, by cutting soccer we'd just b

some of the unintended consequences of the football
cut, since in a horribly unwise move the college decided t
allot footballs recruits to other teams (like soccer), which ha
only beefed up some of our other sports teams. Thus we mus
cut soccer now and take a serious look at scaling back ou
facilities and funds for our other programs in the near
future...no price is too high for the sake of maintaining a
academic reputation earned through 140 years of hard work

For the team
Courageous. Amazing. Those are just two words of
many that could be used to describe Curt Schilling's
performance in his past two outings for the Red Sox.
Now, before you tell me that baseball is for girls or isn't
even a real sport, take a look at what happened:
Earlier this season, Schilling tore a tendon in his
right ankle. Whenever he pushed off that right ankle to
pitch, the tendon would
flop over his ankle and
make a lovely popping
sound (that doesn't feel
good, I promise). Still,
Schilling kept right on
throwing as the tendon

on popping.
In last week's series
against the Yankees,
the popping
not the
became too dispain
tracting for him to
endure it any longer.
With tape and painkillers
no

MATT SCHILLER
enough, team physician
Bill Morgan came to the
Less Cowbell
rescue. His idea was to
stitch the tendon to the
tissue
in Shilling's
ankle to hold it in place. Despite the fact that the procedure had only been done once before to a cadaver,
Schilling went ahead with it (I don't even want to
know how they figured out Schilling could pitch after
the surgery from playing doctor on a dead guy). After
throwing, they took the stitches out. You really have to
wonder about the health implications of a surgery that
has to be undone a few hours after it's completed.
Schilling has pitched 13 innings since having the
procedure done twice. In those two games combined,
he gave up one earned run and struck out eight batters. Boston won Game 6 of the ALCS en route to the
greatest comeback in baseball history in his first start
and took at 2-0 lead in the World Series after his second
start. His career postseason ERA is a miniscule 2.06,
•but since the stitches it's actually dropped to 0.69. Not
too bad.
Pedro Martinez didn't pitch that well in a single
game all playoffs and, he's been healthy. Pedro
FREAKING Martinez. Even if Schilling weren't
injured, his past two performances against two of the
best offenses in the league would be noteworthy.
Considering the circumstances, they've been nothing
short of legendary.
The question is, where does this performance stack
up in the line of all-time heroic sports performances?
If the Sox hold on to win the World Series, Schilling's
feat could go down as one of the most incredible of all
time.
In 1988, Kirk Gibson struggled through one at bat
with a severely sprained knee to hit the game-winning
home run. Schilling won two games and threw over
lOO more pitches than Gibson faced. No contest.
In the 1970 NBA Finals, Willis Reed played through a
torn thigh muscle to propel the Knicks to victory over
Wilt Chamberlain's Lakers. But he only scored four
points. Was Schilling's performance during these playoffs superior? No question.
Let's not forget that Schilling couldn't walk when he
woke up the morning of Game 2. He couldn't even move
his ankle. Turns out one of the stitches went through a
nerve. Just six hours before Schilling took the field at
Fenway, he had it taken out. From the moment he first
pushed off the mound, blood began to soak through his
socks. No big deal.
After the second win, Schilling said, "I'll never get a
feeling like that ever again in my life." I almost hope
he's right. But you can bet that if the Sox need him for
Game 6 or 7, Schilling will drag that bum ankle onto the
mound with him, grit his teeth and give everything his
body, mind and soul can muster. Whatever happens, his
m
ankle will certainly never be the same. But, then again,

A Swarthmore rugger defense against an attack from the Lehigh offense. The Buzzards won Saturday's game, 25-10.

Men's rugby tops Lafayette
BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
Not your typical day of rugby. In
the midst of a picturesque scene on a
hilltop on the outskirts of the Lehigh
valley, the Evil Buzzards took on the
Leopards of Lafayette. Planes from a
small airport flew over the field within kicking range. In this surreal
atmosphere, it seemed like a struggle
to keep up intensity at times.
Nevertheless, the Buzzards earned a
compelling victory over the Leopards.
Though some of the team's members were less than ecstatic over the
overall intensity of the game, the
team defeated Lafayette on Saturday,
25-10.
"We played decently, although it
wasn't the best game of rugby we've
had all season," co-captain and kicker
Jon Fombonne 'O5 said. The team felt
that it was an abnormally relaxed
rugby game.
"The game, because of various factors, according to guys who had
played for four years, was one of the
least intense rugby games," wing-

player John Williams 'O6 said. "The
games are usually hard-fought,
bloody, and dirty. It's hard to explain,
but we all seemed to be half-asleep. No
one felt like we were playing a rugby
game."

October 28. 2004

Despite its lackluster performance,
the team beat the Leopards convincingly. "We beat them a lot more than
the score shows," Williams said. The
Leopards initially began the game
with a three point lead and scored on a
penalty. The Buzzards took control
shortly afterward however, with a try
from Fombonne, barreling in from five
meters out from the line. "We dominated the game most of the time,"
Williams said. "They got seven of their
points at the end when we were
already ahead by a lot of points."

try came from
Jonathan Augat 'O7, who was tripped
three meters from the line during the
first half. Tevye Kelman 'O6 scored the
third try, similar to that scored by
Fombonne. In the second half,
Kelman scored his second try.
The

second

"Tev scored with an awesome run
from 50 meters out," Fombonne said.
Randy Goldstein 'O5 scored the
Buzzard's final try of the game,
"We had no idea what to expect,"
Fombonne said. "With club sports,
especially rugby, teams change from

year to year because people quit and
join." Last year, the Evil Buzzards
beat Lafayette. "This year we domi-

nated them at their home field," said
Williams. The Leopards did not have
a single substitution player on
Saturday. "They have some people out

with injuries," Fombonne said.
As for the rest of the season, the
Buzzards are looking forward to some
solid wins. "We lost two games this
season that we could have won pretty

easily, but we have a good chance of
winning our next game by a lot,"

Williams said.
Even though the team is out of
playoff contention for this fall season,
the victory against Lafayette was
gratifying. Goldstein was very proud
of the team's performance. "This win

was the result of a true team effort.
Our support was consistent, our communication was superb, and our technical play was the best I've seen this
season," Goldstein said.
The Buzzards will match up
against Bucknell at home on
Saturday. "We are excited after this
weekend's success and are working
hard this week to prepare for
Bucknell," Goldstein said.
"From what we've heard,
[Bucknell is] the weakest team in our
conference," Williams said. "A big
crowd and a big victory are expected."
