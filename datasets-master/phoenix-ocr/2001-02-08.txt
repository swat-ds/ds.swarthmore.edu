Black history month events begin
BY HOFAN CHAU
This year's Black History Month activities coincide with the 30th anniversary ofthe Black Cultural Center (BCC).
The focus this year is on sankofa, a word
which means to lookback and, with this
experience, design the future.
Black History Month kicked off last
Friday with the convocation. The BCC
was filled with students, staff and faculty of all backgrounds. They watched
the film "A Greatand Mighty Walk," featuring John Henrik Clark, one of the
prime movers of Pan-Africanism. Clark
drew upon his experience of childhood
in a sharecropping family, growing up
in Harlem and acquiring a Ph.D. He insisted on the importance of critically
knowing, understanding and celebrating
black history.
"Here in this country you haveAmerican History and Black History, and unfortunately many people don't seem to see
any connection between the two,:" said
religion professor Ina Fandrich, who at-

tended the convocation. "African-American contributions to the history of the
United States have been vital and essential and should therefore be of crucial importance to every American."
The perspective of the presentation
clearly had an impact on many people
who saw it. "Everyone was saying, "Why
[is] this information brand new? Why
isn't [it] mainstream?'" said Tim Sams,
assistant dean and director of the BCC.
"I wish I could impress upon you the uneasiness there was in the room, particularly among the black students," he said.
Registrar Martin Warner said he
found Pan-Africanism conceptually interesting and the review of African history refreshingly positive. In particular,
he was intrigued by the interesting segment on what European history often
called the "dark ages," which Dr. Clark

THE FOCUS OF BLACK
HISTORY MONTH IS
SANKOFA, WHICH
MEANS TO LOOK
BACK, THEN DESIGN
THE FUTURE

described as one of Africa's golden ages.
"I want to learn more about that,"
Warner said.
The meaning ofBlack History Month
holds different meaningfor different students. J. Ayanna Butler 'O2, who is organizing numerous movie screenings
throughout the month, is more outward
looking. She said that it is "a time for
me to educate my peers about my history and ancestry."

Khadijah White 'O4 agreed with her.
"This is our month and we have this to
present to our school and campus," she
said. White hopes to write a play to be
performed during a future Black History Month at the college.
Sams said he hopes that the events
willbe supportive ofthe growth ofblack
students as well as students outside the
black community. "You can't tell anyone
about yourself if you don't know who
you are," he said.
Instead, he hopes to give "a different
voice" to this year's events, one that is
"less explanatory, but more insightful
[it's about] getting blacks to explore
themselves and how to represent themselves."
Harriette Williams 'O3, co-president
of the Swarthmore African Students
Association, said that, for people born
and raised in Africa, Black History
Month is an opportunity to learn more
...

about African-American history. "I
hope that Black History Month will
be an opportunity for increased dialogue between African-Americans
and Africans," she said.
As for students outside the nonblack community, Sams admits that
what they learn will "smack differently." He says that those students
will have their traditional understanding challenged and come to see
that there are "different realities
among the black community."
"Black History month should be
for white people [as well as black
people]," said Fandrich.
Her comments were echoed by
Warner, who added, "We need to
make sure that the history that we
have for ourselves makes AfricanAmericans feel proud, and [we must]
be honest about the problems we've
been having."
While there are those who care
passionately about black history,
there are also many on campus who
are oblivious to the events. "I don't
know anything about Black History
Month," admitted Puong Bui 'O4. A
number of students declined to be
quoted for fear that their lack of interest would be seen as racist.
"People just aren't used to challenging themselves," said Sams.
Drawing on what happened on Friday, he stressed thatthe conversation
"was not mainstream, it was not
but it is
pitched to be attractive
about being true." He said he hopes
that more people will come to experi...

ence it.

Events will continue throughout
the month, ranging from speakers
and book signing to two dance performances and a musical, "Stand By
the River." Movie screenings will also
take place at the BCC.

Yearbook's future remains uncertain
BY ELIZABETH

WRIGHT

The future of The Halcyon remains uncertain as the
Student Budget Committee (SBC) weighs several possible
options that could significantly downsize the scope of the
yearbook and alter the source ofits funding.
Although suggestions to change The Halcyon or even
eliminate it have been brought up with some regularity
within SBC in recent years, little has come of such proposals. This year, however, the changes under consideration
are "more serious, in that it's becoming more and more
clear that more and more people on Student Budget Committee and in the administration are in favor of getting
rid ofThe Halcyon," SBC treasurer Marvin Barron 'O2 said.
He noted that several other colleges have stopped producing yearbooks altogether.
Barron said that entirely eliminating The Halcyon is
not likely at this point. Future changes to the publication,
on the other hand, are probable, perhaps taking effect as
early as next year.
He cautioned, however, that "any changes that need to
be made to the yearbook will take a lot of work, and we are
not sure that it can be easily done by next year. All we are
doing right now are looking at preliminary options." At
the very least, Barron said, the status of The Halcyon is
something that "needs to get on the table."
At issue is the high cost of publishing The Halcyon.
These costs are funded by money from the Student Activities Fee, which is paid by all students.
Currently, only seniors are given a copy of The Halcyon free of charge. Yearbooks are distributed to seniors

in the fall following their graduation. The Halcyon is designed
primarily for seniors, and contains no individual pictures of
studentsfrom other classes. The yearbook is available for sale
to underclassmen, but last year only about 60 yearbooks were
sold.
Publishing a yearbook is an expensive undertaking, with
high fixed costs. SBC currently budgets much more for The
Halcyon each year than is given to many other student groups.
An increase to the Student Activities Fee recently proposed
by SBC may raise it to a total of $287 for next year. The recommended increase is currently awaiting approval by the College Budget Committee. At the same time this increase was
eirecommended, SBC noted that changing The Halcyon
ther by reducing its size or quality, or by arranging for another part of the college to fund it would have the same net
effect as increasing the activities fee.
Shifting responsibility for funding The Halcyon is a proposal that has been fielded by SBC in previous years, but they
have never taken the idea very far.
The Halcyon has not always been funded by SBC, however.
The college used to directly sponsor its production until it
decided about seven years ago to make it an entirely studentrun operation. Not long after, the college chose to stop providing a free yearbook to every student, a change that was
prompted partly by a sharp rise in publication costs.
SBC is currently holding conversations with the alumni
relations office, exploring the possibility thatthe office would
take an oversight role in publishing The Halcyon. According
to Barron, The Halcyon could be considered an alumni

NJ Congressman
to give insider's
view of D.C.
BY JON EHRENFELD
Representative Rush Holt, D-NJ, will give a talk in
Kohlberg's Scheuer Room on Saturday at 2 p.m. Holt, a
former physics professor at the college, will speak about
Washington and Congress as seen through a
Swarthmore perspective.
Holt, a Democrat fromNew Jersey's twelfth district,
was a professor in the college's physics department from
1982 to 1988.
This past November, Holt was re-elected in what
Trisha Maloney of the alumni relations department
called "the second closest race in the country." His challenger, republican Dick Zimmer, lost the election by
only several thousand votes.
In his talk, which is being arranged by Professor Ray
Hopkins of the political science department, Holt is expected to give an insider's perspective on the government through the lens of a Swarthmore faculty mem-

ber.

Among the top issues Holt deals with in Congress
are healthcare and education.
Congressman Holt was born in West Virginia, the
son of Rush D. Holt. His father, at 29, was the youngest
person ever to be elected to the senate. His mother was
an official in the government's housing department and
the first female Secretary ofState of West Virginia.
Holt obtained his bachelor's degree in physics from
Carleton College in Minnesota and a Ph. D in physics
from New York University. According to Min Lee 'OO,
district aide to Holt, he was also a five-time Jeopardy
winner. While he was at Swarthmore, Holt become involved in politics. He was a congressional fellow for
Swarthmore's representative and worked briefly in the
Pennsylvania State Department.
After his time at Swarthmore, Holt become the assistant director of the government-funded Princeton
Plasma Physics Laboratory. While he was employed in
the Princeton lab, Holt's duties included government
relations for the lab. Around this time, he decided that
his district could be better represented.
In 1996, Holt intended to challenge incumbent Republican Dick Zimmer, who had been the twelfth district representative since 1990. Holt did not make it past
the primary, but, in 1998, he ran again, thistime against
Republican Mike Poppas, who had filled the seat that
Zimmer vacated in order to run for the Senate against
Robert Toricelli. This time, he won in a close election.
This year's election, once more against Dick Zimmer,
was not called until some weeks after election day, due
to the closeness of the vote.

Council delays decision to support living wage
BY NICOLE BRUNDA
StudentCouncil voted to delay making
a decision to lend support to the living
wage campaign at Monday's meeting. Concerns expressedby some council members
are likely to continue throughout the debate on the viability of pushing for a living wage for college staff.
The Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Committee, the student and staff
group behind the campaign, presented the
accumulation of five months of research
and study on the status of Swarthmore's
approximately 300 hourly employees.
After the presentation, about 25 members of the committee who had gathered
in Parrish Parlors for the council's meeting requested Student Council support of
the proposal, which many committee members termed "broad and philosophical."
The Committee hoped to bring Student
Council support to theirfirst meeting with
senior staff, which was held Tuesday morning.
After deliberating whether the present
form of the proposal was too detailed for

council support, a divided Student Council voted to table the issue six to four, effectively eliminating their support from
the meeting that members of the Living
Wage and Democracy Campaign had Tuesday morning with senior staff.
Mariah Montgomery 'O4, one of the
campaign's leaders, said that support from
the council would have been nice but probably wouldn't have made a huge difference

in Tuesday's preliminary meeting. Montgomery said, "I'm happy that individual
members on the council supported the
campaign because they are students and
represent the people who we are trying to
reach. Though I would have liked Student
Council to offer support for our proposal,
we'll be back next weekand hopefully we'll
have filled in some of the gaps some mem-

bers found."
All members of the council voiced philosophical support of the document but questioned whether specifics in the proposal,
such as a reference to a dental plan, were
too specific to allow Student Council's
stamp of approval.
Jordan Brackett 'Ol, Student Council
college planning committee representative, said, "I don't want to say poor people
shouldn't get money, but I don't think I can
support the entire definition of a living
wage presented [in the present proposal]."
Student Councilmembers who voted to
put council support on hold voiced a variety of concerns about lending council support to the living wage campaign's proposal.
Among the top arguments from those
who voted not to endorse the proposal were

that the proposal would require funds from
unspecified sources, which might endanger
Student Council's current relationship with
the College Budget Committee.Another complaint was the lack of clarity reagarding
whether the living wage campaign had the
support of the full student body, which the
Student Council is meant to represent in its
entirety.
Liane Rice 'O3, Student Council appointments chair and one of the Student Council
members who voted against tabling the issue,
disagreed, stating that it wasn't the job of the
council to figure out where the money would
come from. Instead, she said, it was their responsibility to lend their support to various
student groups.
Some members of the council offered evidence that not all staff supported the living
wage campaign.

Marvin Barron 'O2, Student Budget Committee treasurer, summarized a conversation
with his hall's housekeeper, alluding to a sign
she had posted on the wall, whichhe said read,
"I don't support the living wage campaign.
Ask me why."
In the ensuing conversation, Barron said
the woman told him she felt the job security
many staff employees enjoy would be threat-

ened by the layoffs that might result from increased wages. In addition, Barron referred
to the present seniority wage structure, which
benefits those employees who have been at the
college for a number of years. Barron said he
feared this might be lost if a higher living
wage were implemented.
Members of the committee in the audience
addressed both issues, stating that any agree-

ment reached between the college and staff
would explicitly prevent the college from lay-

ing off workers or hiring temporary employees to pay for the increased wages.
In addition, a committee member offered a plan that would bring the hourly
wage at Swarthmore to a fixed minimum
while still offering seniority benefits, al-

beit on a smaller scale.

Though receptive to committee's ideas,
the Council decided that they did not want
to sign the proposal without at least partial
support and tabled theissue until they could
gather more informationand student opinions.
Montgomery said she hoped students
would show support for the living wage
campaign by "talking about the issue, signing the petition, and, if at all possible, attending the Student Council next week,"
when the committee will present a revised
proposal to them.

Borough resident runs for state senate in special election
BY IVAN BOOTHE
Melissa Maxman, a seven-year resident of the borough
of Swarthmore, was nominated by the Democratic Party in
January to run for the state senate seat in Congressional
District 26.
The position was vacated by senator F. Joseph Loeper
(R), who was sentenced on Wednesday to six months in a
federal prision for obstruction ofU.S. tax laws. The district
comprises the boroughs of Swarthmore and Rutledge, as
well as the towns of Springfield, Upper Darby and
Landsdowne.
Maxman is a former assistant U.S. attorney and now
works in the law firm of Duane, Morris & Heckscher LLR
She attended Amherst College briefly, but was forced to

leave during her sophomore year due to mounting financial
difficulties. She subsequently attended George Washington
University and received a law degree at the University of

Michigan.
Although voter registration in the district shows a Republican-to-Democrat ratio ofmore thantwo to one, Maxman
is optimistic. She points to recent census data showing more
and more people moving from Philadelphia into the suburbs
ofDelaware County.
In politics, she feels that the area is becoming "a lot more
middle-of-the-road." Maxman will face Republican opponent
Edwin B. Erickson of Upper Darby, who has a graduate degree from Bryn Mawr College.
Maxwell has composed a platform of many issues with
which she hopes to attract moderate voters. She is opposed

to eliminating property taxes, saying this does away with
the local control of school districts. She hopes to encourage the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to fund 50 percent of the district's school budgets with state income
taxes, a percentage she believes has not been met in District 26.
Since one-third of the residents of the district are 65 or
over, Maxwell is advocating "targeted tax relief" for senior citizens and funding for a prescription drug coverage plan. She also plans to address concerns about urban
sprawl in the area while still encouraging high-tech businesses to relocate to the district through state tax exemp-

tions.
The special electionfor the state senate seat will be held
on March 20.

Engin majors ready for hybrid car competition
BY GABRIEL HETLAND
Every Tuesday afternoon, in a garage
on Whittier Place, a stone's throw from
Hicks, engineering students gather to work
on a project with the potential to change
the world.
For several years, engineering students
have been working on a hybrid electric car,
entering a national contest every May.
The Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)
project gives students a chance to integrate
many aspects of their education here, said
this year's team manager, Kiyoyuki

Miyasaka 'O3.

"It's a real Swarthmore thing to do," he
said. "It provides an all-in-one experience
with mechanical and electrical [engineer-

ing] and organization."

In 1996, five senior engineering majors
began work on a Beretta donated by
Chrysler as their culminating project. For
the next few years, the project remained

the work of seniors.
In 1997, they took the team's car, "Garnet One," to a national competition, the
American Tour de Sol, and won the
Sportmanship Award.

The competition attracts mostly technical schools and commercial companies.
Swarthmore, said Miyasaka, has been the
only liberal arts college represented.
A change madelast year allowed underclassmen to participate on the team, which
is advised by engineering professors
Nelson Macken and Erik Cheever.
Miyasaka said that this year has seen an
interclass team effort, with allfour classes
represented.

In 1998, the team's second year, Garnet
One claimed third place, stunning many
of the bigger universities and companies.
The competition measures not speed but a
combination of the car's efficiency, acceleration, handling and consumer satisfaction.
Swarthmore has done quite well in the
efficiency category, but less so in the acceleration category, due to the heaviness
of the car. The vehicle weighs in at 4,200
lbs., which is as much as most trucks.

GAS CARS HAVE A
MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY
OF ABOUT 60 PERCENT.
HYBRID ELECTRIC CARS
HAVE A 90 PERCENT OR
GREATER EFFICIENCY.
The battery which provides the car's
electricity
is made of heavy lead acid,
contributing muchof the weight. There are
lighter- weight batteries, but the team said
that their cost of $lO,OOO has proved pro-

hibitive.

The main difference between a hybrid
electrical vehicle and a normal, gas-powered automobile is the source and efficiency of the energy used.
Gas cars are run by burning natural
gas, whereas electric cars run on storedup electricity held in the battery. Hybrid
cars, such as Garnet One, are a combination, running mostly on electricity but also
using a gas-powered generator that allows
the car to run for longer distances.
Hybrid and electrical vehicles are much
Wore efficient than gasoline-powered cars,
because there is no burning of fuel. Gas
cars have a maximum efficiency of about

Engineering professor Nelson Macken helps Andrew Szafran and team manager Kiyoyuki Miyasaka examine the engine of a recently
donated car. The team's next project will be to convert the car into a hybrid electric vehicle suitable for entering in competitions.
though most run below this
60 percent
and give off high amounts of heat and toxic
emissions.
In contrast, hybrid electric cars have a 90
percent or greater efficiency and give off no
emissions whatsoever. Another advantage of
hybrid electric cars is that they are much quieter and even silent when stopped.
Miyasaka said the environmentalbenefits
provided by hybrid cars are pointing toward
a greener future. He is hopeful that more companies will sign on. Toyota and Honda have
already put hybrid cars on the market, and
Ford, Chrysler and General Motors Corp. have
designs in the works.
Financial concerns are one reason that hybrids have still not caught on in the United
States. Miyaska said that some automobile
manufacturers may be reluctant to embrace
the new technology, as it could cut into their
current profits.
Currently, companies are taking slight
losses to sell the cars at $lB,OOO, similar to the
cost of many new cars
but considerably
beyond the budgets of college students and
many others.

Besides cost, there is the issue of car distance range. Electric cars currently cannot
travel much farther than 25 miles, or up to 75
to 150 with the help of a generator. Given the
high numbers of miles driven daily by many
people, this has proven restrictive.
The team's Web site explains the history
of electric vehicles in the United States. In
1890, most cars were powered by electricity.
By the early twentieth century, however, gas
had replaced the battery as the key to car
power, due mostly to its greater capacity for
storing energy. Recently, batteries have
caught up a bit, but the gap remains wide still.
Commenting on student and faculty in-

The Garnet One, the team's hybrid electric vehicle, won an award in a 1997 competition
volvement in the HEV project, Miyasaka
spoke in glowing terms about the excellent

real-world experience the project offered.
Many companies go to the Tour deSol competition to recruit, he said, and several HEV
alumnae have gone on to successful careers
in the industry, with one alumnus working
on Lockheed Martin's hybrid bus project.
The most exciting recent development
was the acquisition in December of a new car
from Suzuki, which will allow the team to
upgrade

their

competition capabilities.

Mayasaki noted that the group is open
to all students and suggested the possibility of art students helping to paint the

new vehicle.
All on the team are excited about the
environmental potential of the cars, but
Mayasaki's biggest reason for volunteering was that the project is "really neat."
Despite the current continuation of gas's

dominance, Miyasaki remains hopeful
that hybrids will still prove to be the wave

of the future.

Job-hunting seniors unfazed by changing economy
BY GERRIT HALL
It was 1991, the beginning of an unimaginable economic
explosion that lasted throughout the 1990s with no sign of
ever letting up. Swarthmore students were entering their
adolescence and learning that stocks were simply incapable
of going in a direction called down.
But as a new millenium dawns, this well of prosperity
has begun to run dry. Currently, Swarthmore's senior class
is taking stock of the fact that they will graduate into a job
market with the highest unemployment rate in years.
Marc Rockmore 'Ol, an honors economics major with a
minor in philosophy, is considering his future plans at this
crossroads ofhis life. With economic growth slowing, he is
wondering if his options are decreasing.
At the beginning of the year, when the economy seemed
stronger, Rockmore was looking at two different paths he
could take with his major. On the economics side, he looked
into conducting research on the state of the economy and
its future. On the business side, he looked into companies
like Accenture Consulting and Goldman Sachs, an investment banking firm.
In a booming economy, Rockmore figured, people would
be needed to fill jobs in strong sectors like consulting and
investmentbanking. If the economy takes a nose dive, however, some economists are gloomy about the future of such
jobs, which they worry will disappear like the thousands of
positions that have been eliminated in the dot-com shake-out.

Horatiu Stefan 'Ol and Pablo Montagnes 'O2, both economics majors, cite consulting and investment banking as
careers that will be hiring less under a slower economy.
"There was even concern that [investment banking would]

drop people," said Stefan.
Career Planning and Placement director Tom Francis,
on the other hand, was more optimistic, and said people in
investmentbanking have jobs "no matter whatthe economy
does."

Negative economic news has saturated media headlines
this year. Vice President Dick Cheney, for example, warned

that "We may well be on the front edge of a recession."

Have things really gotten that bad? Economics professor
Mark Kuperberg doesn't think so. He explained that a recession exists when the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is less
than the GDP with full employment. The GDP measures the
total production and consumption of goods in the United
States. Full employment describes the market under average
conditions. Recession exists, then, whenever production and
consumption are lower than average. According to Kuperberg,
the GDP is still above the full employment GDP.
"The economy is still strong by historical standards," says
Kuperberg. "We're still in an economic boom, just not as much

of one."
What has happened lately is that the economy has entered
a slowdown. The GDP has dropped, and unemployment has
risen a little. Kuperberg further predicts that this slowdown
will last a while, until a recession is reality.
"Basically, you wanted to graduate last year," says
Kuperberg. "It's probably the case that firms may be reluc-

tant to hire new people."
Francis also sees a potential drop-off in the quality of the
job prospects available to current students.
"There's a little bit of a concern," Francis said about the
economic slowdown. He points out that, in individual cases,
students could get jobs that are less than ideal. He also added
that campus recruiting is "fairly expensive" for organizations,
and in a poor economy, it might not be economically feasible.
But he pointed out that the economy has not yet reached that
depth yet. Furthermore, he added thatthe college has lost more
recruiters because of"lack of student interest thanby changes
in the economy."
Overall, Francis emphasized that finding jobs upon graduation from Swarthmore is largely removed from the state of

the economy.
"We are small enough, and our student body is talented
enough, that we tend not to be impacted by economic swings
as much as one might think," Francis said. "The impact on

individual Swarthmore students is just not great."
He stressed that Swarthmore students are very "capable"
and that organizations view Swarthmore graduates as "longterm assets."

"It's important for students to not be overly concerned
about this," he says, echoing what seems to be the prevalent
attitude of Rockmore and other seniors. Rockmore is considering the state of the economy in his search, but only as
one of many factors. He said he realizes that if businesses
had been hiring a few months ago "there would be more

"IT'S PROBABLY THE CASE THAT
FIRMS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO
HIRE NEW PEOPLE"
competition for students." Choosing a field that interests him
is more important, as is planning for graduate school, he

said.
"Grad school is a fairly important thing nowadays," said
Rockmore. Indeed, the majority of Swarthmore students
work for a few years after graduation, thenreturn to graduate school, according to admissions office statistics.
Other members of the senior class in a wide variety of
fields also tend to be mindful of the economic changes but
not worried.
Stefan was hired by a consulting firm in early December. He recognized that consultants may be slower careers
in the economic turmoil, and joked, "They're going to fire
me before I start." Nonetheless, he said he feels pretty secure and has even received calls from other firms.
Leah Zallman 'Ol agrees that the economic slowdown is
a little bit of a concern. She hopes to go into clinical research and wonders whether there will be less availability
for grants. She's still optimistic, believes in the power of a
Swarthmore education, and has not modified her plans
based on the economy.
Rockmore will most likely work for two to four years
before going to graduate school for a Ph.D. in economics. He says he may wind up as a professor of economics, where he'll analyze the economy rather than worry
about it.

Few colleges make RU-486 available
BY ANASTASIA KOLENDO

Swarthmore will not be planning or providing for the administration and purchase
of RU-486 for students at Worth Health Center, according to its director, Linda Echols.
RU-486, the early abortion pill marketed in
the Unites States under the name Mifeprex,
is a drug that blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary to sustain a pregnancy. Itleads to early termination of a pregnancy. Unlike a medical abortion, it is not surgically invasive, which makes it more readily
available to women who may not be able to
go to a conventional abortion clinic.
The Food and

Drug

Administration ap-

proved Mifeprex for use in the United States
on Sept. 28 of last year after a battle between
pro-life and pro-choice groups that lasted more
than a year. It is a struggle that is far from over.
Soon after its approval, many colleges decided not to make the early abortion pill
readily available to students. In the case of

Swarthmore, Worth cited lack offacilities as
one of the primary reasons not to provide the
drug.

A snowstorm that began mid-morning on Monday blanketed the campus in a layer of white,

"You have to beable to tellwith exactness that
the woman is 49 days [away] from her period or
35 [days away] from pregnancy," said Echols,
pointing out mat most facilities that provide
Mifeprex use ultrasoundfor this purpose.
The college does not cover the costs of either surgical or medical abortion.
"To make it a reasonably priced [health
insurance] policy, we had to omit a lot of
things," said Echols, adding that Worth prefers to emphasize preventative measures. Contraceptive pills are available to female students for $6 per cycle, and the morning-after
pill can be obtained from the health center 24
hours a day at no cost. Still, Worth does deal
with "a couple of [pregnancy cases] a year."

The issue is less prominent at the college than on other campuses, where controversy has been brewing ever since the
drug's federal approval. Liane Rice 'O3,
president of the college's chapter of Feminist Majority, said the group had no intention of advocating the drug's availability
on campus.
"As far as I know, there is no one [sufficiently] trained at Worth," she said.
The issue of RU-486's availability on college campuses came to light early this week,
when The ColumbiaSpectator reported that
Columbia, a major university with a large
medical center, will insureRU-486 under the
student medical plan, though it will not be
available at the campus health center.
The lack of Mifeprex does not seem a
pressing issuehere at the college. However,
according to The New York Times, Republicans plan to try to severely restrict
Mifeprex's administration nationwide.
Tommy Thompson's appointment to the
Department ofHealth and Human Services
was approved by the Senate on Jan. 24.
Thompson's conservative stance on abortion is well-known, and he intends to look
into the recent approval of RU-486.
While overturning an FDA study may
seem like a Herculean feat that the Bush
administration will have trouble accomplishing, Mifeprex is facing attacks by Congress as well. A bill introducedby Senator
Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Representative David Vitter, R-La., seeks to restrict
prescription of the early abortion pill
solely to doctors capable of performing a
surgical abortion.
Should the Republicans manage to pass
this bill, abortions will once again be the
domain of abortion clinics and their protestors.

Man with gun not suspect

Swarthmore's new provost

BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
A Swarthmore student reported to Public Safety that
there was a man with a gun walking around campus on
Tuesday afternoon.
The student encountered the man between Sharpies and
Magill Walk at 1:48 p.m. and, upon his request, gave the
man directions to the bookstore.
As the man was walking away, the student noticed that
the man had what appeared to be a gun tucked into his
belt.
Police from Springfield, Providence and the borough
searched for an hour and a half but did not find anyone
who fit the man's description. Staff at the bookstore and
Sharpies said they had not seen the man.
Because the man did not act threateningly or interact
with any other students, Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave said there was "no reason to believe anything
[was] remiss."
"People probably don't think there are people with guns
on campus every day legitimately," he said.
Redgrave pointed out that, if the man were indeed carrying a gun, he could have been a detective, constable, local or state policeman or even a citizen who happened to
have a gun license, as it is "not a crime to carry a gun."
"It's kind of a hard decision, what to do about these
things," he added. "Is it a threat to the campus?"
Redgrave said he did not want to alarm Swarthmore
community members but also knew it would be Public
Safety's responsibility to clear up any rumors that might
begin to circulate around campus.
The student who spoke with the man described him as
a white person between 40 and 50 years old, balding, with
reddish-blond hair. According to the student, he was wearing a light blue waist-length jacket, light blue pants and
brown boots.

OPINIONS
EDITORIAL

The Halcyon should
be saved, improved
In ancient times, the halcyon was a mythical
kingfisher-like bird with a legendary ability to calm
the seas. But at Swarthmore, The Halcyon is a
mythically bad yearbook with a legendary ability to
frustrate Student Budget Committee.
This year, SBC is complaining about the money
needed to fund The Halcyon about $50,000. Last
year, SBC complained about the money. The year
before that, SBC complained about the money. And
it's likely that five years ago, SBC complained about
the money.
This year, though, there's a difference. The
Halcyon, SBC and the Alumni Office are engaged in
serious discussions about the future of the yearbook
(see pg. 3), and it seems that support for the yearbook
among both students and administrators is on the
decline. While past cries to change the Halcyon have
mainly fallen upon deaf ears, these latest discussions
will likely result in some major change to either its
funding or its format.
But why are these discussions happening in the
first place? It's quite easy to look at the numbers SBC
tosses around and dismiss The Halcyon's price tag as
simply too much. But a closer look is more telling.
Yearbooks don't come cheap. The initial cost of
printing a yearbook is incredibly high, even before
they are distributedfree of charge. Hiring photographers and paying pre-press preparation fees add up
as well. There's not too much fat to trim, unfortunately.
So what makes The Halcyon different from say,
The Phoenix, which has a similar operating budget,
hires a paid staff, and is distributedfree to students?
Although SBC allocates around $14,000 a year to The
Phoenix, that income is supplemented by advertising
and subscription revenue. But this type of revenue
simply isn't available to The Halcyon
there are few
people who want their hall pictures interrupted by an
ad for the local grocery store,,and fewer business still
who would actually pay for that ad.
There are perhaps some limited ways for The
Halcyon to raise more money without drawing upon
the Student Activities Fund. By gearing the yearbook
toward all four classes rather than just seniors, The
Halcyon might be able to increase its sales to
underclassmen. The Halcyon should also more
thoroughly explore and expand sponsorship and
patronage programs, which are often a small but
useful source of money.
But these efforts would likely not change the
bottom line by much. The Halcyon still would be
fundamentally supported by college funds, just as it
has always been, and it would still be a major drain
on either student or administration monies.
Does this mean we should get rid of The Halcyon?
Absolutely not. As Matt Rubin pointed out last week
in his op-ed "Halcyon, Halcyoff: it matters," it's
sometimes difficult to see the worth ofThe Halcyon
as students, especially when it's not geared toward

us.

But 10 years down the road, when you want to
remember that weird kid on your hall or the girl in
your orgo class on whom you always had a crush, the
cost of The Halcyon will seem more than worth it.
This doesn't mean that SBC, the Alumni Office

and The Halcyon shouldn'tbe talking. Although we
agreed with Rubin above, we certainly don't think the
yearbook is "fine." As is, the yearbook simply isn't up
to Swarthmore standards the quality of the book
doesn't reflect the quality of the college and its
students.
Rather than talking about whether or not we
should get rid of The Halcyon, we should be talking
about how to improve it and make it more attractive
to underclassmen. A healthy yearbook
one we can

enjoy as freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors
just might rehabilitate the myth of The Halcyon.

Swat should give more back to community
Dear Editor:
I am an artist and live with my wife in a modest twin
home we own in the Borough of Swarthmore. The local government and public schools are funded by property taxes,
which have risen to such a high level that older residents
living on fixed incomes as well as people who are not in
highly compensated professions are feeling pressure to leave.
Much of the reason that the local taxes are so high is that
they are almost exclusively paid by homeowners; there are
few businesses here to help out. The biggest employer is the
college, but it enjoys a tax-free status because it is technically "non-profit." Many non-profits, especially if they are
well off financially, do make significant contributions to their
local communities "in lieu of taxes." Considering the fact
thatthe college owns 40 percent of the acreage in Swarthmore
Borough, and in light of its amazing financial standing, I
feel that the college is appallingly ungenerous in its contributions to its local community.
Last week the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the
college's endowment increased by $9l million in 1999 and is
now worth a billion dollars. Guess what it gave, in lieu of
taxes, to the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District last
year? It gave nothing, $O.OO, to support the schools in its own
community. It gave Swarthmore Borough $81,250 last year.

That may sound like a lot of money, but a billionaire giving
$81,250 is the same as a millionaire giving SBL2S, about the
cost of a dinner for two with a cheap bottle of wine. As it is
now, the college's annual contributions to the community
represent less than one hundredth of one percent of its endowment.
Swarthmore College has a reputation for being concerned
about social justice, but in reality, the college is an incredible money-making machine that does nothing to help support the public schools in its own neighborhood and gives
the local municipal government only chump change. It
doesn't even begin to contribute an amount, in lieu of taxes,
that would be both appropriate and painless given its everexpanding wealth, an amount that could provide substantial tax reliefto our seniors living on a fixed income and our
less-affluent residents.
If the prospect of a ville populated exclusively by white
middle-aged lawyers bothers you, then I ask Swarthmore
students to demand that your school officials account for
their lack of civic responsibility. To the administrators of
Swarthmore College, I say shame on you for teaching the
values of social responsibility to your students but ignoring
these values in the place where you live.

Keep the living wage alive
BY MATT RUBIN
In last week's issue, this paper urged a reaction to
Princeton University's recent decision to replace student
loans with grants. We did not, however, specify what that
reaction should be. I propose that the administration
should answer by providing school employees with a reasonable living wage.
Princeton did not eliminate
Let's be honest, people
these loans out of the goodness of their hearts. No, they
eliminated these loans for a self-serving purpose: to attract more students. Responding to Princeton by enacting
a living wage on campus would, therefore, highlight the
important differences between our schools.
Unlike Princeton, which does not have a living wage
for its employees, the Swarthmore mentality is to promote
social change in a selfless, not selfish, way. Sure, this mentality is ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
sometimes a hard pill to swallow,
but it is our self-professed mission
and we must fulfill it. Hopefully,
this decision will serve to attract
students to Swarthmore by demonstrating the school's dedication to
noble ideals rather than competitive spirit.
Yes, students do need the elimination of loans. But
the
again, a reality check is in order. So check this
average Swarthmore graduate earns considerably more
each year than a non-exempt staff member's 2001 minimum wage of $5.36 an hour. I would venture to say that
these employees live with more debt than Swarthmore

Center for Social Change. What good is this center, I won
der, when the poverty it will no doubt attempt to decrease
exists to visibly on our own campus? Hell, let's just get ric
of this center and endow a living wage for all employees
I'm sure Mr. Lang would agree to this, as long as we callec
it the Eugene M. Lang Living Wage.
Some of you might be thinking that it is interesting to
hear me, a Republican, supporting the living wage. You
neglect to understand that I am a Republican because of
the role I believe the federal government should have. On
a purely normative basis, I think the government has no
business interfering with the market price for labor is such
a drastic way. Last I checked, though, the federal govern
ment had nothing to do with a living wage for Swarthmore
employees.

A federal living wage would also be an economic night
mare. As the price of labor were
raised above its equilibrium level
■MMMHMMnMHBi
supply of labor would exceed demanc
and drastic unemployment woulc
probably result. Furthermore, our
labor would become uncompetitive
with foreign labor markets, and thus
our status as an international com
mercial power would decline significantly.
Neither of these two economic issues confronts
Swarthmore at the present time. However, one nationa
economic concern does affect the college. The problem: if

A"EUGENE M. LANG
LIVING WAGE"?

graduates do and have less earning power to pay offtheir

debts.
This is not meant to diminish the burden of student
loans. Ideally, we would both eliminate loans and enact a
living wage proposal. However, I fear that this is impossible. The administration could easily use this Princeton
situation as an excuse to deny a proposal for a living wage.
They could say that they support a living wage but that,
due to the need to respond to Princeton, a living wage is
simply not fiscally responsible.
The truth is that a living wage, if appropriately modest, will have an incredibly small impact on the school's
annual expenses. According to human resources, setting a price floor of $lO an hour for all employees would
cost the school only $120,000 a year (I emphasize that
this is not the professed goal of the living wage campaign, but just a number to work with). Eliminating
loans would cost us, according to "a very rough estimate of what this would cost" provided by Treasurer
Sue Walsh, about $2 million each year. The two costs
are not even comparable.
Don't forget to compare the cost of the living wage to
the $5 million being spent on the new Eugene M. Lang

the salary of unskilled workers is raised drastically, un

skilled workers will begin to be displaced by skilled workers who are enticed by the higher salaries and who work
more efficiently.
Whether a living wage would affect the college's hiring
practices depends entirely on the actual living wage that is
agreed upon. If the increase in current wages is modest
the affect on hiring practices will probably be nonexistent
However, a drastic increase in wages will most likely leac
to a significant change in college employment. While the
college would, for public relations reasons, probably hesitate to fire current employees immediately, in the long run
a downsizing might occur. As more efficient workers are
hired, fewer are needed. The workers that the living wage
campaign advocates for, thus, will be harmed even more in
the end.
There is no doubt that the living wage campaign is a
moral and necessary effort. To students, it offers an oppor
tunity to help people in a concrete, substantive way. To
administrators, it offers a creative (and less expensive) response to a pressing problem as well as a reaffirmation ol
the school's positive, considerate decision-making processes, a measure of which has recently been called into
question. And to staff, of course, it offers a better life. Caution, however, is necessary. If an unreasonable wage is demanded, all sides may be harmed.

Say it loud: Back and Proud
By RANDY KEIM

Culture shock is loosely defined as a person's failure to
adjust to a new culture. This situation occurs when students go abroad for extended periods of time.
Last semester I ventured to Melbourne, Australia where,
interestingly, I felt no culture shock- except for the kangaroos. Since returning to Swarthmore, however, I am feeling the shock that we were so vividly warned of during
our orientation in Melbourne. Still mildly disoriented, I
will now attampt to pinpoint some of what is shocking me

about the Swarthmore that feels like our own "strange and
foreign" culture.
Manners: First all of, I am pretty sure that Pennsylvania does not prohibit friendliness. A reminder, thus:
Eye contact is not a bad thing! Just don't drool or try to
pet the other students
you don't know where they've
been.
The Trotter Tree Sculpture: While I believe I have the
ability to appreciate art, I don't really know what to make
out of this cocoon thing. All I know is that it must have
cost a lot of money, money that could have gone to better
things, like supporting an athletic team (hint, hint) or even
getting a disadvantaged high school student into
Swarthmore. Can someone say bonfire?
Language: People here, unlike in Australia, do not
...

speak English. Do you ever feel like you missed a year of
English? Do you feel you have to carry a dictionary while
on campus? Me too. Swarthmore students seem to speak
their own language, "Swatabull," a mixture of factual information and pointless B.S. to make you think that they
know something that you don't. We'll work on holding a

conversation somewhere down the road.
Parties: Let me thank the freshman for coming out this
semester. Even though their Pass/Fail period is over, they
are welcoming our social life, or dealing with the lack ofit
quite well (with the help of uncle Natty). So far I have been
impressed with the parties. Phi Psi, which has always been
known for its high-class membership and upstanding and
classy hosts, put on a great party, while the night before,
several students threw a party in honor of our famous Grant
Nachman. This is great news, because while we are supposed to be giving something back to the community, I'd
rather have us talking to each other in Paces on a Thursday than sitting in our rooms.
Computers Over Swa-Wa: Wow. Think of all the
drunken and dangerous trips made to Wawa at late hours
that could have been prevented. Why put students at the
risk of getting pulled over, getting in an accident, or getting in a car drunk? Next time don't let some foolish promise of a Sony Play Station 2 (you can't find one anywhere)
ruin your better judgment.

The stress is of
our own making
So you're stressed already. And so am I, and you haven't
slept, and neither have I, and it's only the third week. And
isn't this place a bloodsucking bastard. And nobody anywhere else works as hard as we do. And don't you just
want to make someone writhe in excruciating pain?
Maybe it's just me.
I know I'm old, I'm over the Swat hill, and maybe the
campus stress level has changed with the changing times
while I was busy pretending to have a goal in life. But it
seems to me this is, by tradition, the time of the semester
when everyone starts to feel the undertow: We have a lot
of work. We don't have enough free time. Life sucks and
then you die.

You're thinking, oh, please, not another article about
how stressed out we are, we all know this is a big old stress
ball of a college and we should just get over it. But maybe
that's the problem. You don't question what you "know."
And maybe you should, because maybe if you're stressed,
it's your own damn fault. I know it's mine.
I was bitching to a new friend the other day about an
activity that takes up a lot of my time. When I finished my
long-winded whine about how long it takes, how little time
is left over, and how much I question its merit, he looked
at me and asked, "Do you like it?" That shut me up for a
minute.
"I don't know," I said finally.
"You don'tknow?" he repeated.
I said I guessed I hadn't really thought aboutit like that.
He looked at me as though I were a strange and pathetic
being. IfI've forgotten how to ask myself simple questions
about my life, perhaps that analysis isn't too far off.
I don't think I'm the only one. "I have three meetings
tonight and seven hundred pages to read for tomorrow and
I hate my life." Do you have to be in nineteen campus
groups? Do you have to spend this much time on them?
You're not going to ask yourself these questions, because
your commitments are, to you, a measure of how responsible and well-rounded you are. "I've been working on this
paper for ten hours, and it's not done, and I have to stay up
all night, and I hate my life." How many of those hours
were spent typing, and how many checking email, talking
to random people, or staring at floor lint? You don't care,
because everyone pulls all-nighters, and besides, it means
you're smart because you manage, despite savaging both
your mood and your immune system, to get your lab report done. You proud, battle-worn warrior, you.
In fact, if we don't occasionally hate our lives, it feels

like we're being lazy. People come to this school from an
environment in which they were among "the smart ones."
That source of self-esteem is hard to relinquish. Then we
get to a place where stress is, by popular opinion, universal. So what do we do? We become the biggest, hairiest
stress monkeys we know how to be. I don't think we mean
to, at least not at first. It's just that we still all want to be
the smart ones. And if that means we have to hate life more
than anyone else we know, by God, we're going to do it.
Stress is not just normal, it's a merit badge. We think
it's inevitable, and we think it's admirable. So we don't
bother paring down our schedules to reasonable dimensions, and we don'tbother to pay attention to when we're
being productive, when we're having fun, and when we're
just spacing out. Then we go around talking about how
hard Swarthmore is and how much life sucks.
This lifestyle is stupid. Much of the growth we need to
be doing at this time in our lives does not involve paper,
computer screens, or lists ofextracurricular activities. Yet
for some reason we seem to prefer our martyr complexes
to a good night's sleep. This will not serve us well as functional human beings in the future.
Some among us manage to deal with this place pretty
well. They set up their lives with reasonable goals, and
they meet them without enough angst to outweigh fun
along the way. These are the people who avoid the Swattie
mass delusion that stress equals self-worth. Maybe they
could write a self-help book and send it to me. I'll read it
next time I'm supposed to be writing a paper.

Major choosing:
an annual delight
One of the advantages of living on a predominantly
underclass hall, aside from watching freshmen pass out
and occasionalfits ofmen-related and work-related tears
from freshwomen, is that I am related the goings-on of
the lower classes. And one of those goings-on (which
some of you have by now guessed) is the annual sophomore major choosing. And the especially astute of you
have also guessed the next part, too it's time for the
annual "Choose Your Major" column, which this year
is heightened by my increased misanthropy and the fact
that I am a senior and taking classes in only two departments, meaning I can be uncouth with a decreased
chance of reprisal.
Those of you with boring lives and those who enjoy
seeing me fail will no doubt proceed to see which disciplines I molested last year in the hopes that I will trot
out new salvos on a different cadre of offenders. You
would, however, be wrong. I have no desire to visit the
graveyards of now-gauche humor, so, if there are repetitions, and I know there will be because economics is
still a major, you'll have to write your own column to
trash them, which I, in fact, encourage. Perhaps via
The Phoenix we may reanimate the old Spike practice
of course summaries.
The problem with major choosing (should there be a
hyphen in there? I do love them so) is that it seems so
early to be making what seems to be, though isn't, such
an important decision. At eighteen or nineteen years
of age, can one really decide to treat his own and others' desires as rankable and quantifiablepreferences?
And you can't simply major in "science" (as Thomas
Dolby cries from beyond the grave), as a path of general
curiosity. Science is no longer Aristotelian observation;
it involves numbers and dear mention of mathematics.
History is perhaps as close as you can now get to
something resembling a general field, though a cursory
examination of the course catalogue would soon alert
you to the number of courses than can be taken before
you end up in "Congan Totemic Pottery and Historical
Mimesis" or "Why You, Because of Your Great-GreatGreat Grandparents, Who Were Actually In Hungary
But We Don't Really Care, Are Responsible For My Oppression." So that's less fun, then.
Second up on the list of general majors is economics, which is perfect if you have no soul orcan pretend
not to have one for a given amount of time per week.
We used to pride Bill Clinton on this ability, calling it
"compartmentalization"; it doesn't work as well as you
would think. Economics also, I believe, involves math.
Psychology and political science are preferable alternatives as a course of general study. They involve
little math, at least on the undergraduate level; often
have pretty books by semi-famous people, including
semi-famous alumni; throw nice parties; and, despite
the amount of reading, are often de facto truncated by
the proliferation ofuseless graphs and tables, which say
what you just read (side thought: don't you think venir
de, plus the infinitive, expresses recent events so much
more neatly than the English "just," with the past?) in
numbers, naively assuming numbers to be less capable
of falsity than words. Furthermore, even a brief study
of psychology will allow you comprehension of at least
double the number of jokes on "Frasier."
So I've left quite a few out of the mix again, and this
time I will not be back, barring catastrophe, to ameliorate my lacking. I leave it to others to mock music or
dance or classics, which I personally think are all fine
modes of study that enable you, if you are successful, to
be less respected and earn exponentially less thanpeople
with a seventeenth of your talent and enterprise.
College: a product that allows semi-independent
adults to compress decades of bad decisions into four
years, whose punishment is then mitigated by the indulgence of a career with people who didn't thenknow
you.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Professor raises important issues
but ends with flawed conclusion
Dear Editor:
We are writing in response to the opinion piece by Peter Schmidt, "Why I voted the way I did," and the accompanying editorial, "Time for healing now," in the Jan. 25 Phoenix. Both refer to the recent decision by the Board of Managers concerning athletics at the college.
Schmidt expresses "intense unease" with the process
leading to the decision, a process in which "due deliberation" was impossible. This is an unease shared by many in
the college community. For example, according to online
polls, students and alumni overwhelmingly (more than 75
percent) agree that the process was flawed.
And by all reports
even those posted by the administration the procedures radically departed from the longestablished decision-making process at Swarthmore. The
traditional path to a fully-informed consensus was replaced
with hardball tactics that remind one of the worst of national politics.
We share Schmidt's unease with the process. But we do
not share his view that notwithstanding a bad process, the
results are acceptable. All of our experience tells us that in
matters of governance, a flawed decision-making process
inevitably leads to a flawed outcome. By its very nature,
where the process is flawed the fact-gathering and analy-

sis are probably flawed as well
as they were in this case.
The failures in this case were not merely a lack of technical
niceties but, rather, were fundamental.
Under those circumstances, Schmidt's confidence in the
correctness of the outcome is badly misplaced, since the
Board (and we assume Schmidt) simply did not have available adequate information and did not go through a normal
deliberation.
Moreover, where one side is treated unfairly and a predeterminedresult is jammedthrough and retroactively validated by self-congratulatory propaganda, there can be no
healing. There is only anger and resentment and a sense
that one has been cheated. These can't be assuaged by a
simple exercise ofkiss and make up.
The hardball tactics of the administrationand the flawed
decision of the board not only cast doubt on themselves, but
also put a substantial cloud on the entire decision-making
process and leadership at the college. Would Schmidt propose that that is a good result?
In short, to use a word of which the administration is so
fond, both the process and the result were purely and simply not ethical.

Decision puzzling, distressing
Dear Editor:

We, members of Mind The Light, write to express our
grave concern with the recent events at the college. The
Dec. 2 decision of the Board of Managers to drop football
and wrestling and relegate women's badminton to non-varsity status is both puzzling and distressing. It is puzzling
because the process by which the decision was reached was
flawed.
There were no written reports or verifiable data presented by the AthleticReview Committee (ARC) in support
of its recommendation. There was no time provided for
review of the recommendation by the entire college community, and less than 24 hours for review by members of
the board before they were expected to act on the recommendation. There was no concerted attempt to engage the
community in discussion of the recommendation prior to
the decision.
Given the strong dissent from eight board members and
one abstention, no decision should have been made in December. This was a serious misjudgment by the board.
It is distressing in that thus far, the administration has
not recognized that the process it used fundamentally undermines the trust imparted to it and the board by the college community.

In addition, the process negates Swarthmore's Quaker
tradition of thinking, listening and deliberating together
before decisions are made. Moreover, using the college
public relations resources to quell debate, and researching
and producing a report after the fact, fail to build confidence in the process.
No amount of effort to "heal the deep divisions" this
decision has rendered within the community will work,
short of revisiting the process in its entirety. A flawed process has led to a flawed outcome. Legitimate processes lead
to legitimate outcomes.
The rationale provided by the administration simply
does not adequately support the recommendation and decision, and calls into question its commitment to the mission of the college, which
explicitly states, "Swarthmore students
are expected to prepare themselves for

full, balanced lives as individuals and as

responsible citizens through exacting intellectual study supplemented by a varied
program of sports and extracurricular

activities."
The Dec. 2 decision will alter the composition of the student body and will affect
the college's ability to fulfill its stated mission. Such changes and effects demand a
complete and open discussion involving all
of the college community. The process to
date greatly diminishes the concept of

"community" at Swarthmore.

We request that the administration immediately ask the
Board of Managers to stay its decision until a complete analysis and report can be developed and presented to the board
and the college community. It may be necessary to form a
committee to prepare a first report to help the community
reaffirm the "mission" of the college.
A second committee should be constituted to complete
the process of gathering and analyzing information that was
begun by the ARC. Ironically, this is consistent withthe methodology suggested by the book "The Game ofLife" in Chapter 14. In this way, the entire college community will have
the opportunity to participate in the discussion of issues so
fundamental to the mission of the college and to ensure that
the Board of Managers and administrationare fully informed
before deliberating and rendering decisions on such issues.
This is the Swarthmore tradition.
Mind The Light is calling on all members of the college
community to scrutinize the events of the past two months
and reflect on the college's history and its mission. Our membership is open and diverse. We seek to address and educate
the community about issues surrounding the decision and
the process and its effect on the college's core values and
mission. Toward this end, we have established a web site
(www.mindthelight.org) as a means of promoting dialogue
among members of the college community.

PUBLIC

Ex-president is

the anti-has-been
The day after Bill Clinton left the White House,
the New York Times published a story about his visit
to a local deli in Chappaqua, New York
his new
home town. As he ordered an egg salad sandwich,
another customer urged her 11-year-old daughter to
go ask the president for an autograph.
"He is not the president," said the little girl.
As a matter of fact, once a president, always a
president, by title if not by office. But if you nonetheless think the 11-year-old was on to something, think
again. The Clintons have not exactly retired quietly
in order to enjoy the twilight of their lives. In fact,
they can't even stay out of the headlines.
The very day George W. Bush was to be inaugurated, Clinton struck a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in order to avoid criminal charges over the
Monica Lewinsky matter when he left office. In exchange for admitting thathe gave false testimony and
for a five-year suspension of his law license, Clinton
escapes the possibility ofindictmentfor perjury and
obstruction of justice.
that certain of my responses
"I now recognize
to questions about Ms. Lewinsky were false," Clinton
acknowledged in a prepared legal statement.
Well, thank goodness we are finally settled on
...

what the definitionof is is.
And so the president finally left Washington in
some car that was not the presidential motorcade and
then on some airplane that was not Air Force One.
The Weekly Standard published a cover story en-

THANK GOODNESS WE ARE
FINALLY SETTLED ON WHAT
THE DEFINITION OF "IS" IS.

titled, "Our Long National Nightmare Is Over." Janet
Reno said she was going home to sit on her porch.
But the Bill Clinton story was not over.
Within a day, the story broke that among the recipients of Clinton's 140 last-minute pardons before
he left office was Marc Rich, a man whose last name
also described him. Rich was a commodities trader
who fled to Switzerland in 1983 after being charged
with $4B million worth of tax evasion; his ex-wife
raised millions for the Democratic National Committee and his generous gift-giving to Israeli charities

earned him a friend in Clinton ally Ehud Barak.
Clinton later said he wished he'd had more time
to consider the pardon, and Trent Lott said he wanted
a Congressional inquiry. No word from Caspar
Weinberger, subject of the last-minute George Bush
pardon in 1992 that effectively ended the Iran-Contra
investigation against the president and did not result in any Congressional investigations.
Post-Clinton era Clinton story No. 2: Bill and
Hillary agree to pay for $86,000 worth of gifts they received last year, as Bill was taking his "victory tour"
and Hillary was trying to dodge the Senate gift ban
that wouldtake effect in January. Among the gift-givers: Denise Rich, aforementioned ex-wife. (And in case
you were worried about the $86,000 debt incurred by
the former president, the honorarium he'll demand
for just one speech will be enough to cover it.)
In case you haven't noticed, these mini-scandals
have a way of keeping the Clintons in the newspapers without really damaging their reputations. They
are anti-scandals, and Clinton is an anti-has-been.
Let's face it, we're ally just waiting to see what he'll
do next.

Oh, how George W. Bush wishes the Clinton era
were truly over. But the Friends of Bill (FOB) are
still sending their checks. Hillary is a U.S. Senator,
and some say future presidential candidate. And Bill?
Trust me, he didn't order that egg salad sandwich
because he was hungry.

Why

I would be the best RA ever

BY FRANK MARTINEZ
RA applications were due on Monday. In the rush to finish my application on time, I may have forgotten a few
important details. Even though my
friend wrote me the most detailed recommendation ever (thanks again,
Vanessa), I may have forgotten some
key points that the committee should
be aware of. I'd like to take this opportunity to write a public recommendation for myself.

There are lots of reasons why I'd be a
fine RA. The absolute number one reason, however, is my time management
skills. I have horribletime management
skills. This means, though, that I am always in my room. At dinnertime, I realize that I should eat but then I just sit in
my room and waste some time until it's
too late. So I don't go, and I just sit in my
room some more.
I never do work until I absolutely
have to I'm too busy just hanging out
in my room, missing dinner and whatnot. When I do write papers, it is usually all night before the morning that it
is due. Again, this is all in my room. The
point is that I would be the single most

available RA ever. As I already said, I

love wasting time, so I'd love to talk to
anybody if they ever want to come by
to chat. If you want to discuss something

and I have work to do, that is

even

bet-

ter.
Probably the next best reason for
why I should be an RA is my unusual
talent for thinking up hall themes. My
most interesting theme idea so far is
Lou Diamond Phillips. There's lots of
stuff that people don't know about Lou
Diamond, everybody's favorite Scottish/Irish/Cherokee/Filipino/Hawaiian/Chinese/Spanish actor, and this
would be a great opportunity to for
people to learn. Of course, Lou Diamond
Phillips is best known for his breakout
performance in "La Bamba," my favorite movie. I'd hang up posters of him
portraying fallen rock star Ritchie

Valens. There would also be posters
from his other movies, like "Stand and
Deliver" (a.k.a. "Con Ganas de
Triunfar"), "Courage Under Fire" and
lesser-known films like "Young Guns 2:
Blaze of Glory."
I'd have trivia too. Most people probably think that Lou Diamond was born
in Texas. That's not quite right: he was

raised in Texas, but born in the Philippines. It's a common misconception. He
has two kids with his beautiful wife,
Kelly Preston (don't worry, not John
Travolta's Kelly Preston). He was even
nominatedfor a Tony for his Broadway
performance of "The King and I." I'm
surprised you didn't know that.
And that is just one ofmy really good
ideas for a hall theme. I am also considering a Silly Putty theme, a circus theme,
a Seattle Pilots major league baseball
club theme and a "C'mon guys, is it really that hard to flush?" theme.
I have lots of good ideas for hall
themes. But let me give you more good
reasons why I'd be such a good RA. For
one, I am done with girls for a while, so
there's no possibility of me hooking up
with the one cute first-year on my hall.
This supposedly taboo practice is way too
common, and it just won't be an issue
for me. Plus, I'd add to the diversity of
the RA pool. How many RAs do we have
from the Midwest, let alonefrom Wisconsin? Not very many, you say— not nearly
enough, I say. I'm responsible, friendly,
attractive, good under pressure, openminded everything that an RA needs
to be.

Does bad grammar pain you?
Do you wince at misplaced commas?

Something for everyone

Matt Rubin experiences Medeski Martin
& Wood's innovation
mixed with traditional
jazz influences in NYC.
This weekend, you can
do the same.
With their recent album "The Dropper," Medeski Markind of. They
tin & Wood are back to their old selves
revisit their jam- and funk-infested jazz with a new measure of avant-garde noise improvisation thatevidences their
increased musical maturity.
"The Dropper" makes it hard to remember that, not so
long ago, the Phish Phan's Phavorite Phunky band had
taken an acoustic turn. Just last year, they embarked on an
ambitious acoustic tour in an attempt to fuse theirinnovative style with their traditional jazz influences.
The culmination of this tour was a wonderful live album, "Tonic," so named for the New York City jazz epicenter at which it was recorded.
Living in the musical capital of the world, I was lucky
enough to see one of these acoustic shows. Let me tell you,
it was quite an experience.
I have been to Phish shows and I've seen the crowd; I
have been to jazz shows and I've seen that crowd. But I have
never been to a show that attracted both crowds in equal
proportions the way that this Medeski Martin & Wood show
did.
In the Angel Orsanz Center, a beautiful, convertedchurch venue, crunchy hippies danced barefoot in the aisles
while chic, entirely black-clad NYU film students sat attentively in plush chairs. Needless to say, I was enthralled.
I attended the show with two of the crunchy hippies.
These girls, to give you an idea, walked barefoot through
the city on their way to the show where, in typical form,
they encountered some twenty-something hippie friends
they had met at the Wetlands (the standard NYC hippie

venue) the week before. At the start, they were a bit baffled;
they wondered where the Medeski they knew, the Medeski
ofthe Further Festival, had gone. I told them to listen harder,
and indeed, by the end of the show, they were dancing, loving every minute.
MMW produced some of the best live fusion music I have
ever heard. They moved seamlessly from standard jazztunes
to their older, funkier, originals. All the while, they retained
an innovative yet traditional jazz sound. For instance, they
played a pretty straight version of Coltrane's classic
"Syeeda's Flute Song"; straight, that is, until they closed it
with a wild percussion solo by drummer Billy Martin, during which he made use ofhis wide collection of scrap metal
strips, wooden projectiles, African drums, and, among other
junk, tin cans.
At this concert, Medeski Martin & Woodhad something
to offer everyone, jazz buffs and Deadheads alike. Undoubtedly, their concert at Swarthmore will be equally pleasing
to all, though I doubt I'll see anything resembling the crowd
I saw that night in New York.
For their Swarthmore performance, Medeski will be eschewing many of the guest artists that have been accompanying theirrecent tour. Gone are such jazz giants as fusion
guitarist Marc Ribot, one of this decade's great innovators
on that instrument. The band, thus, will go back to the setup
with which I saw them a few months ago.
However, judgingby the content of"The Dropper," which
they have been promoting on their recent Japanese and upcoming European tour dates, this concert will certainly not
be the same as the neo-traditionalist acoustic show I saw.

Thus, MMW's gig at Swat should be an incredibly inter
esting blend of their old-fashioned yet distinctly original
trio stylings and their electronic forays into the univers
of the avant-garde.
This Saturday's show should be particularly appeal
ing to Swarthmore's many brands

of music fans. Indie rockers will get
the distinctly melodic electric playing that they crave; hippies will be
able to dance till their feet turn
brown; jazz purists will get a taste
of one of the best classic set-up trios
around today. Everyone else will be
in for a new-found treat.

Medeski Martin & Wood, a genre-defying trio,

performance. And if, God forbid, you don't have a
Valentine, well, then you might as well just down
that entire bag of Hershey's kisses and sob
hysterically while watching "An Affair to
Remember" all by your lonesome like the pathetic
person society says you are.
And it's not that I'm bitter. I've had my share of
Valentine's Day moments (and plenty of self-pitying
chocolate-filled moments, too). It's just that I object
to the performance of it all. Love (romance,
commitment, trust, loyalty and all that jazz) is
special because it's unique. Because it is shared by
only two people (well, usually!). Because it brings
magic into the couple's lives. Because it's what
makes those lives worth living so much of the time.
And yeah, OK, the flowers will probably make
her melt. But they're not enough. Love is sacred. It
should be celebrated every day. Not just once a
year, on some arbitrary day in February. And the
best kinds of mementos don't have a little
registered trademark symbol on them. They're
those spontaneous, priceless gestures that
remind you of why you are in love with the person

That's how I see it, anyway.

Irish poetry conveys its relevance, beauty
AMIDST WAR, POVERTY, AND

THAT WEIGHED ITS WRITERS
WITH A SOCIOPOLITICAL
PASSION THAT MOST AMERICAN
POETS CAN ONLY IMAGINE.
Westchester suburbs and the streets of Manhattan.
Professor Nathalie Anderson and I share Irish ancestry and American births. Against the wintry background
of a Robert Frost poem, Anderson (maiden name
Fitzsimmons) described how she took over the Irish Poetry Symposium. The series began with Michael Durkan,
who traveled here from County Mayo in the 1970s and

worked as the HeadLibrarian in McCabe Library.
A County Mayo native, Durkan had connections in the
Irish literary circle, and began inviting colleagues, like
Seamus Heaney, to Swarthmore. When Durkan passed
away, Anderson took over. What's special about the Irish
poet? Professor Anderson says it's a combination of how
they bring "relevance and beauty" to the land and their
incredible sense of location that takes us beyond landscapes

Poetry readings are usually disappointingly elite events.
The effects of beautiful descriptions and strong political
statements are unfortunately deflated by the applause following each poem and post-reading literary chit-chat over
coffee and cigarettes. While poetry boasts extreme significance in solitude, public readings often seem inane exercises in audience impression, rather useless navel-gazing,
all in all. So when I learned about a series of poets coming
to campus, I was inclined to ignore the event, until I dis-

covered their heritage.
It only makes a difference because I'm Irish by blood. Curious about my roots, I welcome the poets' words to capture
and carry me to the inviting Irish landscape. The Ireland of
Paul Muldoon and Seamus Heaney rises beyond tourism and
pop stereotypes, crafting character-filled images. Still, I feel
unable to completely connect to Dublin or Cork.
Even passing through them last August with my family, I
could not ignore my painfully glaring lack ofconnection with
what was an admittedly gorgeous country. My blood is Irish,
but my heritage is New York, somewhere between the

and intimately connects us with neighborhoods and street
corners.
Amidst war, poverty, and twentieth-century troubles,
Ireland endured turmoil that weighed its writers with a
sociopolitical passion that most American poets can only
imagine. While we laud peaceful efforts, some of the best
American works were borne of war. Would Francis Scott
Key have found fame had we not been engaged in war?
Without the Civil War, what would have inspired
Whitman's portrayal of Lincoln in "O Captain, My Captain"? Think of the talent in American art, music, film,
and literature that would have been lost were we not involved in Vietnam!
This semester, Swatties will have the opportunity to
experience four incredible Irish poets. The first, Adrian
Rice, willread tonight at 8 p.m. in the Scheuer room. While
other poets in weeks to come, Paul Muldoon (who will have
his turn in the Scheuer room on Feb. 13 at 4:15 p.m.), Mary
O'Malley and Michael Longley, have been to Swarthmore,
this will be Rice's first Swat reading . If political passion
and powerful poetry entice you, then come, absorb, and
listen, but please leave your elitism at home. The Irish poets
might have a more lasting effect if we hold our applause
until the last word.

'Double Take' only pretends to be slummin'
BY SUZANNE WU
Something happened to my high school crowd in college, to all my friends who secretly
considered themselves artsy, maybe, or even sensitive. They stopped drinking malt liquor
and fruit-punch-flavored boones, that wine cooler that came in $2 bottles, and instead began comparing red wines. They replaced frozen corn dogs with cheese sold by the quarter
pound and soy. Instead of 1980s prom dresses and Converse, they began shaving their legs
and dressing like Jackie O. or their favorite image of a slightly rumpled intellectual. Hell,
they even stopped smoking pot.
And I, assuming that I haven't already in many ways fallen into that trap, have only one
thing to say to that. Screw you. You used to be fun. To which my friends will reply, "I am
fun. C'mon, let's watch "Alphaville" for the billionth time. And did I tell you that I realized
I'm bisexual?"
At first, watching "Double Take" seemed to be exactly what I needed, a low-brow action
flick with a few situational jokes thrown in that superficially touch on deeper issues that I
don't need to think about because I'm too busy trying to figure out who the good guys are.
Freddy Tiffany, the obnoxious, crass character played by Eddie Griffin, is the one who
seems like he's having a good time. In one of the most subtly funny scenes in the entire
movie, he's dancing on a sidewalk surrounded by Hare Krishnas while scoping out Orlando
Jones as banker Daryl Chase. Griffin does a superb job exuding both self-confidence and a
sort offamiliarity with his character's role. When he's upset, the audience shouldbe as well,
because most of the timehe's laughing off danger, or creating it himself as some sort of con.
Jones, on the other hand, is uptight and seems bogged down by legal and financial worries and a bizarre desire to talk about business and ignore his girlfriend, who is directly
behind him, dressed in lingerie on a catwalk. It's a classic juxtaposition; all the guy with a
beemer does in the sequel to "Friday" is worry about his car, while Ice Cube is busy using
it as a shield from the short Mexican gangster's bullets.

But at least in "Next Friday" the message seems to be
mo' money, mo' problems, and
Ice Cube eventually returns to
South Central, away from all
the "rich folk with theirrich
folk issues." "Double Take,"
for all its convoluted plot
mechanisms, double-crossings, triple-crossings and
cases of mistaken identity,
eventually ends up in Malibu,
and you realize that the feelgood friendship of Chase and
Tiffany at the end is really just
a sharedsmirk and relief that
slummin' it was only a phase.

A synopsis for those who would rather not read my babble: "Double Take" follows
a Harvard graduate Wall Street banker who gets caught up in a drug cartel that is
using his company to launder money. He needs to escape to Mexico and enlists,
and then dismisses, a loud-mouthed 'brother' who mysteriously and conveniently
shows up in whatever setting the banker finds himself in.

Over my winter vacation I spent the night at Ginny's house. It was her
birthday, so we (Sarah, Laura, Meredith, Emily, Marjorie, and me) all
brought presents. We ate spaghetti and then cake and ice cream and Ginny
opened her gifts. I gave Ginny an *N Sync poster where JC looks really
cute, but Justin doesn't. We don't like Justin anymore because he's dating Britney Spears, and we like Christina Aguilera better than Britney.

So then we watched "Austin Powers" which is Ginny's favorite movie.
Emily and Marjorie really didn't want to watch it because we've all seen
it like a billion times, and they kept talking through the movie saying
how it wasn't that funny and how we should have rented "Armageddon"
instead because that's Emily's favorite movie, and Marjorie agrees with
like whatever Emily says.
After the movie was done we talked. Ginny said we should play a game
where we said what bugs us about the other people at the party. So
Meredith said that Laura bugs her because of how she flirts with like all
the boys in Language Arts, and Sarah said that Laura bugs her because
she walks around with her boobs stuck out all the time. Then Laura said
that Sarah bugs her because her hair is always frizzy. Sarah started crying and she locked herself in the bathroom. Then Ginny said that Marjorie
bugs her because she does everything that Emily tells her to do, and Laura
said that Emily bugs her because she tells Marjorie what to do like all the
time. Ginny and Laura told Marjorie that she shouldn't agree with everything Emily says. Emily said that Marjorie doesn't agree with everything
Emily says, arid Marjorie agreed.
Sarah was still in the bathroom, and Meredith really had to pee, so
Laura said she'd give Sarah a makeover. That's when we stopped the game
to do makeovers. Emily called Cameron Wilkms because Marjorie likes
him and she was too afraid to call. So Emily spent like an hour on the
phone with him trying to get him to ask Marjorie out, but he wouldn't.He
said that Marjorie was alright but that he didn't like her that way. He
likes Emily instead, and he asked her out. Marjorie heard and started
crying and locked herself in the bathroom. Emily said yes, so now they're
going out, and Marjorie probably won't do whatever Emily says anymore.
Then we all went to bed. It was a pretty fun party.

Book treats college athletics dilemma Yearbook's
future remains
Athletics and admissions
uncertain

BY IVAN BOOTHE

In 1869, the first college football game took
place between two academically rigorous
schools, Princeton and Rutgers Universities.
The Rutgers team, which won the game, included ten freshmen. Three of the freshmen
were failing algebra.

The issue of athletics versus academics
at highly selective colleges has been around
for quite some time. In the recent months,
however, the issue has been brought to a
head, influenced primarily by the book "The
Game ofLife: College Sports and Educational
Values."
The book was co-authored by James
Shulman, president of the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, and former Princeton University president William Bowen.
Their study examined the transcripts of
interviews with former students at 30 selective colleges, from the classes of 1951,1976and
1989. A variety ofcolleges were surveyed, and
they run the gamut from small liberal arts
colleges, like Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr,
to large athletic powerhouses, like the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Penn
State University. All of the colleges are

highly selective.

A growing dichotomy
The authors were motivated by their belief that there was a growing dichotomy between the missions of institutions of higher
learning and their intensely subsidized athletic departments.
"We always had a glimmer that there was
an academic divide," Bowen said, "but didn't
know whether it had always been there, to
what extent. So I thought we ought to find
out."
The book makes several arguments, chief
among them being the undue influence that
athletics exerts on college admissions, structure and funding.
These arguments are not dissimilar to
those made just a few weeks ago, in support
of the decision by the Swarthmore Board of
Managers to eliminatefootball and wrestling
and reclassify women's badminton as a club
sport.
The origins of such an academic divide
can be traced to the explosion of new state
colleges in the 1960s and 19705. These new
state universities were able to offer much
less expensive degrees than their academically elite counterparts.
In order to attract more students, elite
academic institutions became more inclusive, adding "diversity" to their criteria for
an incoming class. Soon, diversity was extended beyond racial, gender and socioeconomic terms to varieties of talents and skills.
"Defining the ability to complete a forward pass as a kind of 'excellence' extends
the concept of selectivity beyond grades and
test scores," Menand wrote.
In addition, over the course of the 20th
century, more and more schools began to
exert control over their athletic divisions.
"In an effort to control excess and police
the games, schools took charge," Bowen and
Shulman write. "In doing so, it was assumed,
the strength of theinstitution's discipline and
sense ofpurpose would moderate the passions

inspired by athletics."
Unfortunately, contend the authors, just
the opposite occurred. "Sports once seen as
merely an outlet for passions and energy or
as a community-building ritual are now justified as a training ground for leaders," they

write.

They are quick to point out, however, that
"it is the combination of greater intensity in
athletics and greater academic intensity that
has led to the growing divide between athlet-

ics and much of the rest of the campus com-

munity."

The first area that the authors of "The
Game ofLife" take issue with is admissions
policy. They see this as the most glaring
problem with the smaller liberal-arts colleges.

Since student bodies are so much
smaller, they write, athletics are much more
prevalent, and in their opinion, detrimental "in terms ofits direct impact on admissions and the composition and ethos of the
student body."
The authors take pains to explain that
they "do not mean to suggest that the athletes who are admitted are bad people
[but] the more difficult, and more relevant
question is whether admitting other students in their place might not have done
even more to fulfill the educational mission
of the school."
Peter Philip, a former dean of admission at the Hotchkiss School cited in the
book, feels that when students are admitted on the basis of athletic ability, it
"cheapens [their] academic accomplishments and suggests that [their] athletic
achievements in college will be more
highly regarded than anything [they] ac...

complish academically."
The authors note the difficulty admis-

tive to other students, but relative to how
they themselves might have been expected
to perform" based on test scores.
In addition, Welch Suggs of The
Chronicle of Higher Education notes, based
on the book's data, "Not just football, basketball, and hockey players, but athletes on
lower-profile teams [underperform] as well.
And not just at places like Michigan and
Penn State, but at liberal-arts colleges like

Swarthmore, too."

Underperformance in women is also consistent, although not as drastic as with male

athletes.
Athletes also do worse than classmates
who spend an equal amount oftime on other
extra-curricular activities.
The book puts an emphasis on the "increasing intensification of college sports,
even at the Division 111 level," and the authors believe that "many of those who might
arguably have benefited the most from college athletics now have little or no chance
of being on a team." For evidence, they cite
the extremely low rate of "walk-ons" in college varsity sports, that is, students who play
on a varsity team for the first time in college.

Re-examinations
Even the idea of the "life lessons" learned

by students involved in athletics is flatly
contradicted in the authors' book. "There is
no evidence," they write, "that being an ath-

sions officers face when offering athletes admission to the college. They cannot, they
point out, look at a list of athletically talented candidates and then choose half "on
the basis ofcriteria related marginally, if at
all," to the needs of a football or softball

lete has made [students] into leaders."
Based on the data from the book, Suggs
noted that "former varsity athletes who are
chief executive officers in companies earn
less than non-athletes in comparable positions, and former college athletes are less
active in civic and charitable groups than
are their other peers."
What Bowen and Shulman are asking of
schools is nothing less than a reexamination
of their basic driving philosophies.
The authors also show that little, if any,
monetary gain is made by colleges from
alumni enthusiastic about winning teams.
They also doubt that even the largest athletic schools turn much of a profit, based on
the huge expense needed to maintain the

team.

sports.

Without coaches being a part of the admissions process, they point out, one could
end up with twelve goalies for a soccer team.
In addition, because Ivy League and liberal arts colleges cannot offer binding athletic scholarships, they must admit a large
number ofathletes in order to account for
first-year students who don't stay with their

What's happened, say the authors, is a
basic shift in colleges' aims in admitting students. In the 1960s and 70s, they say, the basic philosophy was the idea of the wellrounded individual. Objections initially
came from the faculty, opposing the rejection of candidates who had high aptitudes
in only one particular area.
Thus, the philosophy of the well-rounded
class was born, the idea that "the supermathematician should definitely be admit-

"The Game ofLife" finds, quite unequivothat athletes have a better chance of
admission than non-athletes.
At a "representative coed liberal arts Division 111 college" that agreed to give information on the basis of anonymity, a minority applicant in 1999 had an 18 percent
better chance of being admitted. The
daughter or son of an alumnus had a 25

relations publication, since it is given to
graduated seniors, not current students.
He added that that giving control of
the yearbook to another campus entity,
like the alumni office, would provide the
yearbook with "institutional memory",
and, in the long term, create greater consistency in its quality.
Lisa Lee, directorofalumni relations,
said her conversations with SBC have
been preliminary so far, and it has not
been made clear whether such a proposed
oversight role wouldinvolve funding publication of the yearbook. If SBC continues to provide funding for The Halcyon
itself, two options under consideration by
the committee would significantlyreduce
publishing costs by cutting the size of the
yearbook, which is currently about 260
pages. Linda Thai, editor in chief ofThe
Halcyon, was to call the yearbook's pub-

lisher Wednesday to discuss the feasibility of these options.
Another possibility Barron said had
been raised would be to replace The Halcyon with a "glorified Cygnet." Such a
publication might contain a picture of
each student, and would be distributed
to all classes.
Thai said all these options still need
to be looked into more carefully, and that
the final status of the next year's yearbook remains up in the air. She plans to
meet with Barron again on Sunday to
further discuss the yearbook's future.
"I don't think anyone wants to see the
yearbook cancelled," Thai said. Yet she

emphasized thatchoices about the future
ofThe Halcyon will be affected largely by
the attitudes of students and the level of
interest they express in maintaining a

yearbook.
"It depends on the student body," she
said. "If people think the student body
doesn't want a yearbook, what reason is
there to continue it? Hopefully, students
will realize the true quality and sentimental value ofThe Halcyon and support it."

The athletics versus academics issue,
then, is no longer limited only to large state
schools and, contend the authors, never really was in the first place. The real issue is
at small liberal-arts and Ivy League schools,
where athletics affects the "ethos" of the students on campus.
Recent events at Swarthmore only serve
to emphasize the re-evaluation that is under

WILL ORTMAN
I am incredibly excited about the possibilities for this year's Student Council.
This is a great school; there is nowhere else I'd rather be. This school does so many
things right, and there are also so manyways that we can work to make itbetter. A
number of projects exist that I would like to dedicate my energy to, including:
• Finally addressing the lack of activist space by dedicating space in Wharton
basement to this large group of very dedicated students who need a home.
• Promoting the idea of the Swarthmore community by bringing back collections that people actually want to go to, improving communication between students and the administration and making sure that no group within the community is being treated unfairly.
• Enhancing campus safety by installing additional lighting, emergency call
boxes and student keys that will open any dorm.
- Making sure that Student Council is a group that actually works for students
and not just a training ground for budding politicians by opening up meetings to
anyone who has an interest and by coordinating SC's efforts with groups like ADVICE.
• Addressing smaller quality of life issues in lots of ways
more and better meal plans (we should get what we pay
for!), lockers for off-campus students, posting grades online, hand dryers, more public computers, fixing the movie
projectors, extended library hours, credit at the McCabe coffee bar and bringing back the Sharpies swing.
If elected, I will bring a great deal of experience to these projects. I have served a year on the council, as much as
anyone in the current group except one, so I know as well as anyone how to get things done. In addition, my experience
will serve as a good compliment with the other co-president, who is relatively new to council. I have been a part of
projects both big (like the game room referendum) and small (like ensuring that our Tarble meal credit not be taken
away) and have acquired working relationships with both students and administrators that will be vital to accomplishing our goals.

With Brandon's resignation, it is important that the new co-president be able to jump right in and immediately start
working with the current group. I know the issues facing council because I've already been working on them for a year,
so I'll be able to get right to work without taking the time to learn the background.
I am also really excited about working with this semester's council, which will be the most diverse and representative group yet. With more and differing perspectives being offered, this group will be able torepresent the student body
like never before. This semester presents an opportunity for council unlike any I've seen in my two and a half years
here. With your help, I would like to use my experience and energies to make a positive difference for the student body.
I'm asking for your vote because this is a wonderful school that could be even better! If you have any questions or
suggestions, please email me at wortmanl or call at x 4893.

for even greater involvement in the life of the Swarthmore community. I am running
because I am interested in supporting and improving many aspects of life on campus. As a candidate, I have valuable leadership and participatory experience in many
student organizations, a strong commitment to effective and creative service, and
concrete objectives that I want to accomplish on behalf of the student body.
I have been and continue to be a member of many different student groups on
campus. I sing in Cantatrix, am a member of the Queer-Straight Alliance, and have
worked with Solidaridad and SPAC. In the fall of 1999,1 founded and co-chaired

I am proud of my two-year tenure as VicePresident ofFeminist Majority and the instrumental role I have played in organizing campus-wide events, such as a faculty roundtable on women worldwide, a lecture by Eleanor Smeal, the organization's founder, and a petition and
awareness drive for Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Last spring, I produced and
directed "The Vagina Monologues" in Olde Club.

• I am dedicated to remedying and expanding security at Swarthmore. I will push for increased lighting
on and around campus, callboxes in the tunnels and by the fieldhouse, greater dorm security, continual
staffing of the emergency phone, and a broader inquiry into Public Safety responsiveness and effectiveness.
I also feel quite strongly that a reexamination of the campus assault policy is needed. The "policy" is currently more of a disjointed, little-publicized suggestion list for possible action. I believe that SC can work on
producing a coherent outline for action and response to be revised and distributed yearly to every Swarthmore
student. The college's response to incidents of assault (especially sexual assault) must be faster and more
sympathetic and supportive to the victims.
• I will spearhead an examination of the ways in which financial aid decisions are made, especially after
the first year. I want to reduce the burden of loans on returning students and remedy the situation in which
many find themselves, when a parent or step-parent may have a large income (which is reflected in an aid
application and decision) but they do not, for whatever reason, contribute to the student's educational costs.
I will work for aid criteria that reflect a broader understanding of financial need.
• Other issues I will address as co-president include: improving eating options, including creating the
Swa-wa late-night convenience store, expanding Tarble hours, increasing the variety and quality of food at
Sharpies, and enabling meal credit to be used at Kohlberg Coffee Bar. I will work with campus organizations
to finally provide an activist/political space that can be used for meetings, specialevents, and storage space.
I will work with the Curriculum Committee to extend the deadline for the pass/fail option until the week
after midterms. I will also initiate my own attempts and support others' attempts to bring widely known
speakers to campus.
1 In running for co-president, lam hoping to providenew, informed, dynamic leadership to Student Council and the community and to accurately and responsibly represent the student body to the administration.
I look forward very much to working with Colin Moore and the current members of SC and I am excited by
the prospect of serving the student body as co-president of Student Council.

Men's tennis hopeful
for return to nationals
BY BEN KEYS
The men's tennis team kicks off another
campaign this Friday at 2 p.m. at the
Swarthmore Indoor Invitational. Led by
seniors at the top of the lineup and boasting underclass exuberance throughout, the
team optimistically looks toward a challenging schedule and a grueling season,
which they hope will culminate in a return
trip to the NCAA Division 111 nationals.
Co-captain Pete Schilla 'Ol will be playing his second season at No. 1 for the Garnet. Big wins late in the 2000 campaign
against Bloomsburg and Amherst should
set the tone for Schilla's much-anticipated

final year.
John Thomas'O2 will take the second position, where a number of close matches
often decide the team's success. Though frequently battling injury and illness, including a bout with partial blindness in the fall,
the team hopes to have Thomas at 100 percent for the crux of the season. Schilla and
Thomas will team up as one of the region's
most experienced and highly ranked
doubles teams. Expect laser-like returns
and punishing volleys from the veteran duo.

Second-year players Justin Singer 'O3
and Jay son Yost 'O3 will be the heart of the
Garnet lineup, with both younger players
proving theirreadiness for the big time in
the fall tune-up tournaments. Singer's allcourt game continues to improve by leaps
and bounds, and Yost's serve seems to become more dangerous by the day.
Yost attributes much of the sophomores' rapid development to the Michael
Mullan Center, the team's posh new home.
"We just couldn't train like this before the
center opened," he said.
Freshman sensationFrank Visciano 'O4
will be quickly thrust into the spotlight
this season, playing fifth singles and teaming up with Singer at third doubles.
Co-captain Scott Grant 'Ol anchors the
team at the sixth singles position. Grant
and Yost will reunite at second doubles this
season, making the big-serving tandem a
nightmare for opponents. Yost anticipates
results from the duo.
"I look forward to playing doubles with
Scott," he said.
Fab Five Ben Rae 'O4, Joey Spadola 'O4,
Aaron Rubin 'O4, Mike Noreika 'O4 and Joe
Dickerson 'O4 add depth to the lineup and
ensure the team's success in future season.
Coach Mike Mullan returns from a semester sabbatical after a trip to Italy and studies at Bryn Mawr College.
With a tough home tournament against
Division I Villanova and Division II
Kutztown this weekend, as well as three
early-season Division I matches, there are
no easy stops for the men's tennis team this

season. The team faces a new region and
new rivalries, but the possibilities are endless for this year's team. As long as the team
van pays its tolls and obeys all posted speed
regulations, there's no reason this trip can't
go all the way to Nationals.
Matches begin at 2 p.m. Friday in the

Borbee takes her place in Pa. Lacrosse Hall of Fame
BY MAUREEN VERNON

Before women's World Cup soccer games were nationally televised, before the United States softball team won
back-to-back gold medals, before Sports Illustrated for
women, and before Mia Hamm and Brandy Chastain became
household names, Karen Emas Borbee was reaching the pinnacle of athleticism. Borbee's amazing lacrosse performances not only secured her a place in history, they also
shaped the future of women's sports. Borbee, currently an
associate professor of athletics and the head coach of field
hockey and lacrosse at Swarthmore, is being inducted into
the Pennsylvania Lacrosse Hall ofFame this week.
Undoubtedly one of the best lacrosse players in history,
Borbee had few equals on the field. She graduated with honors from the University of Delaware, where she is a Wall of
Fame recipient as well as a Hall of Fame athlete.
The number oftimes the name "Karen Emas" appears in
the NCAA Division I lacrosse records is astounding. Borbee
holds the most prestigious lacrosse records: career points
(420), career goals (310) and single season goals (98), as well
as 15other school records. Her record of single-season points
(130) was broken just last year, but she still holds second

and third in the category. Borbee earned All American honors for three straight years and even dominated as a freshman, holding the freshman records forboth goals and points.
Borbee led Delaware to three national lacrosse championships and was selected as the Most Valuable Player of the

1983tournament. Her spectacular tournament performances
are documented in the NCAA records. She scored the most
goals in the 1983 and 1984tournaments and holds the records
for most goals in a game, most goals in a tournament, most
points in a game and most points in a tournament.
Borbee contributed herlacrosse talentto several national
and international teams, as well, playing as a member of
the United States Women's Lacrosse Squad and the United
States Lacrosse World Cup Team from 1981 to 1993. Borbee
was a member of the World Champion World Cup Team in
1989.
However, Borbee believes her game cannot be defined
by numbers. "You don't remember the scores or records,"
she says. "They aren't as significant as the people, the expe-

riences, and the lessons I've learned." Ultimately, Borbee says,
it is the importance of these lessons that motivated her to become a coach. "The lessons of the playing field helped mold me
throughout my life. I hope to bring that same experience to
those I coach," she said.
GivenBorbee's credentials, she could coach anywhere. What
brings her to Swarthmore, however, is the opportunity to teach
the scholar-athlete the lessons of the playing field. Adrienne
Shibles, head coach ofthe women's basketball team, saidBorbee
"has an amazing understanding of the delicate balance between
academics and athletics, which evolved from her days as an

national caliber elite athlete."
The nature of Swarthmore students and the college itself
makes Borbee's job challenging. But it is precisely this challenge that keeps her here. Beyond this, Borbee added that she
is continually impressed by her players. "I love the students,"
she emphasized. "They are the most amazing people I could
possibly be involved with." The students thus help keep her
here as well. "I am amazed at what they're about, all of their
talents, what makes them tick, and I want them to learn the
powerful lessons of sports," she said.
Borbee's teams have had tremendous success under her tenure. The women's lacrosse team has an overall record of 80-51,
with ECAC post-season invitations in 1997,1998 and 2000. The
field hockey team is 56-21, with three Centennial Conference
championships, an NCAA post-season invitation in 1996, the
1997 ECAC Mid-Atlantic Championship, and a 1998 ECAC post-

season invitation. Faced with these numbers, Borbee immediately deflects credit to her teams. "I work with incredible groups
of talented, motivated women who want to reach their potential," she said, 'and I just help them do that."
Players and coaches disagree, however, stressing the sig-

nificant role Borbee plays in the teams' success. Borbee's belief in her team influences how they play. "I've shown the players that I believe in them and I enjoy being there," she said,
'land maybe that helps when they have to make thatbig play."
Players indicate that thisfaith has helped them. "I grew tremendously as a player and a person [during my] four years" at
Swarthmore, saidKelly Wilcox '97, assistant coachand a former
hockey and lacrosse player. "She inspires and develops those
around her." Wilcox said this confidence spread to other areas
of her life. "The confidence I gained as a player under Borbee

directly translated into theclassroom and beyond," she said.
This extension of the lessons of the playing field into life
is exactly what Borbee hopes to accomplish. To Borbee,
sports is life "with the volume turned up."
"Sport experiences are the same as life experiences: you
set goals, realize your limitations, reach your potential, feel
frustrated," she said. These are "the intangibles" of sports,
all of which, said Borbee, mirror life. Her players have similarly come torecognize the importance of these "intangibles":
Carly Hammond 'O2, a member ofboth the field hockey and
lacrosse teams, said, "I have learned more from playing a
sport than from any of my classes."
The life lessons thatBorbee teaches, saidKristen English
'Ol, "extend far beyond the playing fields." These lessons in-

clude how to "be a leader, work with others, communicate
and stop what you're doing, for just a second, and enjoy the
moment." said Hammond. Borbee also emphasizes forgetting worries or pressures, telling her players that when they
cross Rt. 320 to practice on the Cunningham fields, they leave
everything else behind.
Today, when Karen Emas Borbee goes to coaching conferences, most young coaches do not realize that she is the
legendary Karen Emas, butrather meet Karen Borbee, head
coach ofhockey and lacrosse at Swarthmore College. Borbee
says that identity is just fine, as she deeply believes in the
importance ofher role here. The people who know her would
probably also agree. Although her records are incredible,
"it is actually upon life's scoreboard thatBorbee has posted
her greatest numbers," said English. "She is my hero not
because she scored lots of goals on the lacrosse field, but
because she embodies everything I could ever hope to be."
Borbee will undoubtedly continue to empower and motivate the student-athletes she coaches. At a time when
Swarthmore athletics are mired in controversy and the validity ofathletics is being questioned, the importance of the
life lessons of the athletic field cannot be ignored. Borbee

represents all that Swarthmore sports can hope to be.
Perhaps if Borbee were a male basketball or baseball
player, or even playing today, Karen Emas would be a household name, and she would be a hero for thousands of young
people. Instead, Karen Borbee paved the way for women's
sports, and, for the hundreds ofathletes she has coached,
she is a hero.

Garnet trounces Blue Jays, 68-56

|THE SWEET
SPOT

BY CAITLIN RYLAND AND EMILY GRAY

The game redeems
itself or does it?

Last Saturday under the lights of Tarble Pavilion, 11
women geared up for the opportunity to advance in the basketball polls and compete for a nationalranking against the
Diplomats ofFranklin & Marshall College. Despite opening
the game with authority and mounting a commanding lead
for the majority of the game, however, the Garnet Tide could
not convert the victory and snapped a six-game winning
streak with a final tally of 70-63.
A confident Swarthmore team was well aware of the implications of this game, and knew that they would have to
rev the engines and run on all six cylinders for the duration. They owned the famous "first five minutes" and quite
a few minutes after that, slamming the Dips with a 19-point
lead midway through the first half. Perhaps astounded at
how readily they could slay this conference giant, the
Garnettes let up just enough toward the end of the first half

"AGAINST A POWERHOUSE LIKE
F&M, YOU HAVE TO GIVE 'EM HELL
FOR ALL FORTY."
to let the Diplomats back in the game. Their lead at halftime
was only 11 points.
Assistant CoachKira Cochran-Bond 'OO jokingly asserted,
"Assistant Coach Rouse says that it's crucial to own the first
five minutes of each half, but it's not enough just to play ten
minutes of good basketball against a powerhouse like F&M,
you have to give 'em hell for all forty."
Fresh from the locker room, the Diplomats waged a fullcourt attack in the second half to quickly erode the point
differential while an astounded Swat team stood by virtually defenseless against this new-found momentum. After a
9-0 run to open the first half, the team clawed its way back
into the game, only to lose the lead after 36 minutes of play.
A failure to capitalize on forced turnovers, coupled with
game fatigue, resulted in several three-point plays by F&M

andfoul troublefor Swarthmore. Heather Marandola 'Ol and
Heather Kile 'O2 both fouled out, while Gretchen Heitz 'O4
and Katie Robinson 'O4 were right behind with four apiece.
Despite the loss, it was a well-fought battle and certain
stat columns sparkled on Saturday night. Sarah Tufano 'O3
contributed an amazing effort in many facets of the game,
bruising her way to 24 points, 10rebounds, and five blocks.
Also worthy ofmention are Heitz and Robinson, both major
rookie contributors. Heitz chipped in a commendable 11
points as she drove through F&M's formidable front line.
Robinson finished with a respectable seven points, nine rebounds, and seven steals.
Last year, the Garnettes faced Johns Hopkins in the semifinals of the Centennial Conference Playoffs. The 64-49

trouncing ended the Garnet's record-breaking season. Last
night, the Swarthmore women's basketball team avenged the
loss by slamming JHU with a 68-56 loss.
The Garnet Tide's defense set the tone for the first half,
forcing the Blue Jays to shoot just 27 percent from the field.
Robinson had five steals in the first half alone, and contributed six points to the 29-22 lead at halftime. The Blue Jays
never regained the lead. Time-out after time-out, JHU attempted comebacks, but the Garnettes beat down the advances to pull out the 68-56 win.
"We approached Johns Hopkins like any other team," said
Kile. "We just played our own game." Though Kile suffered
a bloody nose at the hands of Swat's own Robinson, she was
still pumped about the big "W."
Before heading into last night's game, both Swarthmore
and Johns Hopkins sat at the top of the East and West Divisions, respectively. Swarthmore was one game ahead of powerhouse Muhlenberg, while JHU was one up on Franklin and
Marshall. With last night's win, the Garnet's first place was
shored up, and JHU will have to share with the winner of
today's game between F&M and Gettysburg.
An opportunity for revenge against F&M may rear its
head in the playoffs, and until then the ladies have a lot of
winning to do. The Bryn Mawr contest originally scheduled
for Monday, Feb. 5 was postponed and rescheduled for this
Sunday in the Mawrterdome at 1:00 p.m. The squad's record
is currently 17-3 overall, 8-2 in conference play.

GAME OF THE WEEK

Karen Lange 'O2
Position: Third
Singles

Women's Basketball vs. Ursinus
Where: Tarbie Pavilion
When: Saturday, Feb. 10 at 6 p.m.

With the season wefl
underway, Lange,
one of the team's tricaptains, has led her
team to a spotless 30 record, anchoring
the badminton team
at third singles.
Lange is undefeated
in conference play and has only yielded two points
in six sets. Lange teamed up with teammate
Siobhan Carty 'Ol this past weekend in the annual
PAIAW Tournament at Bryn Athyn. After receiving a
first-round bye, the doubles duo tore through the
ranks to face another Garnet team. Lange and
Carty fought it out to win 15-5,15-2to take home
their second doubles title in as many years. Though
nervous about the upcoming match against rival
Bryn Mawr, Lange is looking forward to the rest of
the season with high hopes.

This weekend showcases the final home games of
the men's and women's basketball seasons. The
Garnet hosts Centennial Conference adversary
Ursinus. The pick of the week is the women of the
Garnet Tide vs. the Bears.
Ursinus currently stands third in the West Division,
behind the Garnet and Muhlenberg. Last outing, the
Garnet beat the Bears 66-50. Look for senior
forward Kate Giusto (No. 33) who scored 20 points
and pulled down nine rebounds against Swat.
Giusto is averaging 16.7 ppg for the Bears.
The Lady Garnet need this win to preserve their
first-place ranking in the West. They have yet to face
No. 2 Muhlenberg for the second timethis season,
in what is sure to be a showdown for first place. As
always, look for No. 25 Sarah Tufano 'O3 and No.
24 Heather Kile 'O2, as well as No. 14 Gretchen
Heitz 'O4 coming off the bench.

Last Friday night, I went to the First Union Center
to see the Sixers and the Magic play four quarters and
two overtimes ofbasketball. In a season plagued by the
injuries ofAlonzo Mourning and Grant Hill, the KobeShaq feud, the lowest scoring averages since the 19705,
and the worst rookie class since God knows when, this
game reaffirmed my faith in modern basketball. It resurrected the entire sport just like Bird and Magic did in
the 1980s. Iverson posted 45 points and displayed incredible quickness and agility. Darrell Armstrong had 31
points and no turnovers, and several Orlando role-players stepped up to secure the Magic victory. Plus, the
game was a double overtimebattle featuring huge comebacks by both teams. But that's beside the point.
Of course, I have gripes about my First Union Center experience that have nothing to do with the game
itself. For starters, an annoying little girl with an annoying shriek of a voice serenaded the crowd with her
"rendition" of our national anthem before the game. Specifically, her "rendition" of the song was singing it in
three different keys. Impressive. Why do we need to sing
"The Star-Spangled Banner" before every game anyway?
Fans are so bored with it nowadays that they start to
cheer and clap after "red glare." Luckily, neither the
Grizzlies nor the Raptors were playing. I couldn't have
sat through another national anthem.
This embarrassment paled in comparison to the most
intolerable aspect of any professional sporting event:
the cheerleaders. Admittedly, they weren't so intolerable at the beginning of the game, but as it progressed,
they wore less and less and got more and more out of
sync. The only people applauding them were the three
fourteen-year-olds in the row in front of me and some
dirty old man a few seats over. Personally, I would have
preferred to see dogs running around and catching
frisbees. At least they would have displayed some athletic ability. Despite the cheerleaders' lack of
athleticism, I think I would have tolerated them if they
had at least one brain between all of them. I know they
didn't because they were cheering heavily when the
Sixers were trailing by five-plus points with only a few

seconds remaining in the second overtime.
Needless to say, a boring anthem performance and
substandard cheerleaders are par for the course in an
NBA game. However, two other occurrences during the
game were especially peculiar to me. First, with only a
few minutes remaining in halftime, dozens of parachutes attached to packs of basketball cards began to
drop from the rafters. I was a bit startled by what happened next. The possibility of acquiring free stuff instigated near-anarchy among the fans: people stood on
their seats; pushed, shoved, tackled and molested others; and dove in the aisles to obtain the cards. Apparently, I was the only person who was unwilling to risk
decapitation to have a chance at getting fifteen generic
basketball cards. Maybe the other fans can explain to
me why they are so excited to get a few pieces of free
cardboard when they are already paying over $4O for
tickets.
At least basketball cards may have some residual entertainment value. The time-out routines had none,
however. During every time-out, a man in a dog costume and army fatigues came onto the floor with his
sidekick, a midget. Then the two proceeded to perform
ridiculous stunts. During one timeout, the midget lay
down at center court, and the canine commando constructed a ramp over the midget and then drove a tricycle over the ramp. By then, I was begging for the cheerleaders.
Fortunately, these embarrassments were completely
overshadowed by the game itself. From the final two
minutes of the fourth quarter until the waning moments
of the second overtime, not a soul in the stadium sat
down. We were all weak in the knees with excitement
as players made clutch shot after clutch shot, keeping
the game close and making us forget the problems that
have plagued basketball all year.

BEING THE BALL
with Joe Gerlitz
Bring back Swat's
cheerleading squad

Garnet women sink Red
Devils; men edged out 106-99

Hey there sports fans. Welcome to a new column in
The Phoenix sports pages. My name is Lane Oatey. With
me, as always, is Joe Gerlitz. This week we have a potentially volatile topic in mind for discussion: slots.
But despite what you might expect, we're not actually going to talk about whether slotting is appropriate
or not. The administration has already proven they're
100 percent behind the slotting system, and I'm sure that
if further discussion on the subject takes place, it will
do so behind closed doors.
This column is going to be about how slots can be
better used.
You know what, Mr. Williams? This "renewed commitment" of yours is great and all. Especially since supporting athletics is supposed to be your job. But there's
a lot more that can be done for sports here on campus
than just mumbling a bit of encouragement every now
and then.And sometimes it doesn't involve cutting or
destroying anything sacred at all.

I hope you're not disappointed.
Sometimes being good at what you do takes a little
effort. Sometimesit takes a little vision and a little originality. Since you don't seem to have much of either, I'm
here for you.
Bob, I really think a good move for you would be to
bring back an honored tradition here at Swarthmore.
After you supported crushing one of the oldest athletic
traditions at the school, I really think it's the least you
can do. It's good PR. And this school needs some good

PR.

Bob, there's only one thing thatcould possibly make

up for the loss of the football team on campus: I want
you to bring back the cheerleaders.
We can go to town with this one. It's a feel-good gold
mine. We'll order up new outfits a set for floor routines during basketball season, a set for those brisk au-

tumn soccer nights under the lights, and a third set for
spring sports like track, lacrosse, and baseball. They'll
get a bus for travel to away games, with a big "Go
Swarthmore Tide" logo on the side. And we'll get them
the very best pompoms money can buy.

It'll be awesome.
But a cheerleading program doesn't just appear over-

night. Resources need to be allocated. That's right, you
heard me, I'm talking about our most precious resource.
We'll need to slot for cheerleaders.
I'm open to negotiation, but I think five slots a year
for really good-looking cheerleaders isn't too much to
ask. Let's work through the math. Five cheerleaders a
year times four years equals 20 potential cheerleaders
on campus. Figure that at least seven of those will probably decide to transfer. Leave room for two to "take time
off for academic reasons." And then if you factor out
the "Swattie effect"

the unlimited ice cream bar and

long nights in Cornell you get a squad of about eight.
That's a good-size squad. We can debate the figures, but
I think you'd want a squad with between six and 10 at
any given time.
I'd say if you asked the men's lacrosse team, the
men's basketball team and the men's soccer teams
whether they wouldbe willing to give up one slot a year
to get some really hot cheerleaders on campus, they'd
jump at the chance. And coming up with the two extra
slots shouldn'tbe hard in the wake of the fairly liquid
"reallotment process."
Let's go, Bob. C'mon,

Al. Reconvene the ARC. We

have another "emergency."
We need to move quickly so that we can steal some
recruits from Florida State.
You know, I bet if I can get Eugene Lang behind this,
it's a shoo-in.
PS. By the way, Mr. Williams? I am ashamed to play
baseball on a field without an outfield fence or dugouts.
Thank you.

The Swarthmore swim teams met Dickinson College on
Feb. 3. The women's team won the meet 135-70, only giving up
two events to the Red Devils.

'Ol, Natalie Briones 'O3, Alice Bonarou 'O2, and Davita
Burkhead-Weiner 'O3. The 1000-yard freestyle was captured by
Krista Gigone 'O4, with Meredith Leigh 'O4 pulling in a second

personal best.

by the team, with Bonarou in first, Tara Trout 'O4 in second

Bonarou scored again in the 200-yard butterfly, placing
second. Burkhead-Weiner and Davis took first and second in
the 100-yard freestyle, while Howes-Mischel, Parmelee, and
Brandyn White 'O3 took all three places in the 200-yard back-

stroke.
The 500-yard free was won by Gigone, with Auerbach finishing second, and Briones took second in the 200-yard breaststroke with Lisa Ladewski 'O2 placing third. The fearsomefour-

some of Davis, Auerbach, Gigone and Howes-Mischel
placed first in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
The men fell in a heartbreaking loss, 106-99. The 400yard medley relay was won by the combination of Mike
Dudley 'O3, Ted Sherer 'Ol, David Whitehead 'O3, and Jason
Kerensky 'O3. Whitehead won the 200-yard free with Chris
Bussard 'O3 placing second. JohnLillvis 'O3 and Eric Shang
'O4 placed first and second in the 200-yard individual medley, and Lillvis again triumphed in the 200-yard fly, with
Aaron Modic 'O4 earning a close second.
Dudley placed again with a second in the 200-yard back,
with Bussard following for a third. Whitehead earned a
third in the 500-yard freestyle. The dynamic duo of Dudley
and Shang placed first and second in the 200-yard breaststroke, while Sherer, Kerensky, Bussard and Lillvis
teamed up for a first in the 400-yard free relay. Shang

earned Centennial Conference Men's Honor Roll honors
this week for his two second place finishes.

Both teams hosted Washington College last night, but

the scores were not available by press time.
The Garnet are off until the Centennial Championships
at F&M Feb. 16 through 18. The women's team is looking to
repeat their second-place performance in last year's championships. They now stand at 4-2 in the conference and 7-2
overall. The championships are also where individual
swimmers look to qualify for nationals.
