Coke products remain kicked off campus
BY ELENA CHOPYAK
echopyal@swarthmore.edu
Despite fears that the Board of Managers
would overturn the administration's decision to remove Coca-Cola products from
campus, no decision concerning Coca-Cola
was made at last week's Board of Managers
meeting. In fact, the Board of Managers has
never before overturned a decision made by
the administrationand will not be overturning the administration's Coca-Cola decision.
Sarah Roberts 'OB, Ruth Schultz 'O9, Zoe

Bridges-Curry 'O9 and Andrew Petzinger 'O9
presented Kick Coke's case to the Board of
Managers, beginning with a brief history of
the Swarthmore campaign before putting
forth their evidence against Coca-Cola, all
Within a span often minutes. Following Kick
Coke's presentation, Board members stated
their reasoning for the call to reevaluate the
claims against Coca-Cola. "The student presentation was coordinated and thoughtful,
but not persuasive to some listeners," Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6l said.
Roberts said that approximately 15 minutes of the meeting were spent on the CocaCola controversy. Roberts also said that the
issue of money was not once mentioned during the discussion over Coca-Cola's reinstatement. Additionally, the Board dis-

cussed the Crum deer overpopulationprob-

lem and the possibility of signing a letter
against the British academic boycott of two
Israeli universities.
Last year, after the administration made
the decision to stop selling and offering
Coca-Cola products, a few Board members
approached the administration with their

concerns about the decision-making
process. Administrators then informed Kick
Coke members that they now needed to present pertinent and convincing evidence in
favor of the Coca-Cola ban. Over this past
summer, Kick Coke sent information and a
letter to the Board of Managers, expressing
their hope thatthe original decision would
not be overturned.

About a week before the most recent
Board of Managers meeting, Kick Coke
organizers met with President Al Bloom,
Eldridge and Vice President ofFacilities and
Management Stu Hain to discuss the sentiments and reasoning of some of the dissenting Board members.
During this meeting, the administration
told Kick Coke that the Board of Managers
has never turned a decision made by the
administration, and would not be in charge
of deciding Coca-Cola' status at the college.
Additionally, administrators informed Kick
Coke organizers that they would not be making an immediate decision on the issue.
"We were caught by surprise when we

learned that [the Board] was not intending
to overturn the decision," Bridges-Curry
said. "The students and the Board were operating under different understandings."
One day prior to the Board of Managers'
meeting, Kick Coke organizers met with
David Gelber '63, Jed Rakoff '64 and Pam
Wetzels '52 over lunch. According to
Roberts, Board members Rakoff and Gelber
are the only members who have expressed

concern over the elimination of Coca-Cola
from the college
Foreseeing the lack of time for thorough
discussion during the upcoming meeting,
the three Board members wanted to communicate the concerns they had, as well as to
share suggestions for Kick Coke's continuing investigation of Coca-Cola. BridgesCurry stated that Gelber, an investigative
journalist, was particularly interested in
Kick Coke's research methodology.
Kick Coke now plans to meet with the
administration next week to figure out the
next steps it must take, as well as to decipher
what exactly is going on in the decisionmaking process. "It's very unclear," Roberts
said in reference to the relationships

between Kick Coke, the administration and

the Board of Managers.
"The Board has all of the power and all of
the money, but they don't want to go against
Al Bloom and the decisions of the school,"

Roberts said. Eldridge said, in reference to
the Coca-Cola issue, "theadministration will
consider the next steps and timing of those
steps."

"It's like pulling teeth to get a timeframe
from anyone," Roberts said of Kick Coke's
interactions with Coca-Cola and the administration. "I don't think its just Kick Coke
that has a hard time getting the school to tell
when and how decisions are made," Roberts
said. "I think this could have been done a lot
faster and with less headaches for everyone." According to Roberts, the Lang Center
and Student Council are working on assembling a new committee on socially responsible purchasing, partially in hopes of streamlining the decision-making process.
"Ultimately, the conversation was really
productive," Bridges-Curry said of the
Board meeting. "Having been in a meeting, I
know more about the process of how the
Board works." Bridges-Curry echoed
Roberts' sentiments, stating that, "The distance between the Board and the students is

problematic."

Kick Coke will continue to do research
and, while doing so, will speak to the
International Labor Organization for more
information. Bridges-Curry said that Gelber
and Rakoff have expressed interest in continuing conversations with Kick Coke
between now and the next Board meeting.

SDS reemerges in effort to revitalize campus activism
BY YINGJIA WANG
ywangX@swarthmore.edu
After a hiatus of over 30 years, Students for a
Democratic Society isreclaiming its place on Swarthmore's
campus. However, the current incarnation ofSDS is noticeably different from its former self.
Back in the 19605, the Swarthmore campus housed an
active chapter of the national SDS. The radical group had a
strong anti-war focus that was especially keen during the
Vietnam War. According to current SDS member Gwen
Snyder 'OB, the group eventually dissolved due to "a. lack of
commitment to addressing issues of race and gender."
"I would like to see the new SDS as taking a cue to learn
from that mistake. We're not restarting the old SDS we're
not just picking up where the old SDS left off," Snyder said.
While the old SDS focused primarily on anti-war issues, the
new SDS plans to combat issues of oppression.
Although SDS did not get chartered until this semester,
students began organizing the group toward the end of the
last semester. According to SDS member Nat Sufrin 'll, a
steering committee formed last year 'drafted some points of

some points of action." The steering committee
was motivated by what it saw as a void at the college. "This
group is forming because there is a real need to have a radical voice in every community, especially in a college community," Sufrin said. "There should be a group that works
to espouse radical views and take direct action as well as
work with some other progressive groups."
Members agree that the radical nature of SDS is a departure from other groups on campus. "SDS is hoping to be
able to express more radical viewpoints and at the same
time make sure that the word "radical' is not associated
with violence or action without thought, or any of the other
negative connotations that the word radical may have,"
SDS member Val Clark 'll said.
"We've talked a lot about how we want to be well organized, have good strategy and have a good thought process.
We're really willing to take risks and to have the views that
we have and to express them openly, but not in a way that
is going to jeopardize other people."
At the moment, SDS is still working to get on its feet.
Nevertheless, it has already shown its presence around
campus by supporting the Jena 6 rally and helping the
unity and

with their chalkings in front of
Sharpies.
Besides championing its own views, SDS also strives to
serve as a support group for various other organizations on
campus.
"One of our goals is to be not only an ally, but a really
reliable ally for groups on campus," Clark said. SDS has
seen significant interest from students, and especially from
first-years, some of whom have already undertaken leadership roles in the group. The group's attraction to members
stems from three main points, the first being its emphasis
on the importance of every member in the group. "One of
the principles of our chapter of SDS is that we don't really
want a steering committee," Sufrin said. "Everyone has a
say about what's going on."
The group's radical beliefs and the diverse opinions held
by its individual members also contribute to its popularity.
"I knew about SDS in the '6os, and I know the '6os get
looked down upon just for being extreme in many ways,"
College Democrats

Sufrin said.

NEWS IN BRIEF
No contract signed with "The Roots" for this fall's LSE
Despite a recent article in the Daily Gazette suggesting that the Large Scale
Event for the Fall semester will be popular hip hop/soul group "The Roots," there
is at present no official word as to the validity of this sentiment.
Currently, neither their record label (Def Jam Recordings) nor The Roots'
MySpace list any appearance at Swarthmore College on the group's tour schedule.
However, a Google cache made of their MySpace as of 10:34 a.m. GMT on Oct. 2 lists
as a tour stop "Swarthmore College" on November 3. This statement is now absent
from the site, leaving its present credibility questionable.
Assistant student activities coordinator Paury Flowers emphasized that in no
way is the school currently entered into a contract with any group to provide entertainment as part of an LSE. "No contract has been signed and no [opening act] contract has been signed," Flowers said. "Announcing [anything we have planned] at
this stage is going to affect our experience
Until a contract is signed, there's no
way we have a show." As of yet, according to Flowers, nothing for theLSE has been
confirmed.
Def Jam Recordings did not respond to several requests for comment regarding
further information on the tour engagements of "The Roots."

StuCo and CAPS meet to improve outreach to students

Student Council and Counseling and Psychological
Services are in the process of discussing ways that CAPS
can better inform the college student body about its
range of services and place within the Swarthmore campus community.
CAPS Director David Ramirez scheduled a meeting

with Student Council after seeing CAPS mentioned on a
"Student Council 411" brief on The Daily Gazette.

"Before

brainstormed an
agenda of some
ideas we had,"
said

Student

Council Secretary Meredith Firetog 'lO. We thought,
'This is what we've heard, these are our impressions.'
We've made it pretty clear that we don't necessarily represent the student body, but we try to advocate for the
student body. We came to [Ramirez] as students who
could push an agenda."
Much of the meeting focused on ways for CAPS to
increase its publicity and presence at Swarthmore.
Student Council suggested that CAPS maintain a bulletin
board in Parrish featuring biographies of each staff
member that details, among other things, the member's
background in psychological services.
According to Ramirez, CAPS is generally comprised
of full-time salaried staff who have been with the college
fer several years.

"The clinical staff consists of the therapists who have
backgrounds either in psychology or social work, and
then we have a consulting psychologist who consults
with the therapists on cases where students are on medication or may benefit from medications," Ramirez said.
In addition to full-time staff, CAPS will also hire, in any
given year, four to five clinical interns that are unpaid
but are considered clinical psychotherapists.
Student Council members also mentioned that the

campus community could benefit from having a clearer
idea of the types of support that CAPS offers.
According to Ramirez, he was surprised by this
request to categorize the services that CAPS offers
because his goal has been to make CAPS as non-specific

as possible.
"I was surprised they wanted me to be real specific. I
try to make CAPS as non-specific and broad an invitation as possible so that anyone can see themselves
accepting the invitation," Ramirez said.

Student Council's rationale for this request was to
urge CAPS to be more transparent. "Part of what we're
pushing is for students to understand how CAPS works
and to take away that daunting feeling about how stuOctober 4, 2007

dents feel when they go see a therapist on campus,"

Firetog said.

At the meeting, Student Council and CAPS also discussed the possibility of an open forum later this semester about CAPS. "Something we proposed at this meeting
was to do an ask the psychiatrist meet and greet. Our
idea is that people have to go down to Worth Health
Center, and maybe it would take away some of the stress
of doing that if a bunch of people from CAPS came up
here to answer anonymous questions," Firetog said.
Student Council is currently working on holding this
forum sometimeafter Fall Break.

"Part of what we're pushing is for
students to understand how CAPS
works and to take away that
daunting feeling about... [going] to
see a therapist on campus."
Meredith Firetog 'll
Student Council Secretary
Sexual Misconduct Advisors & Resource Team member Mark Dlugash 'OB praised the ideas brought up at the

"meeting.

"Worth Health Center, in general, students don't
know enough about. So, I think this is a great initiative.
On the publicity side, that has been a big question in the
past years. How can Worth and CAPS reach out to students? I think CAPS does have something like a third of
the student body going, but any outreach they do is still
a great thing," Dlugash said.

FAA airspace redesign prompts legal response
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY KAITLIN KYI
kkyil@swarthmore.edu
After the release of a final decision on
an airspace redesign plan from the
Federal Aviation Administration on Sept.
5, members of the Swarthmore community promptly responded with legal action as
well as a submission of compiled data to
Government
the
States
United
Accountability Office.
The FAA's formal Record of Decision
for the airspace redesign affects the New
York, New Jersey and Philadelphia
Metropolitan areas in an attempt to
reduce delays, noise and aircraft emissions for the major airports along the eastern corridor. The FAA has opted for a
method of integrating the airspace surrounding the metropolitan areas, which
means areas like Swarthmore could be
facing an increased number of airplanes
flying overhead.

"[FAA is] misrepresenting
the data, a total
misrepresentation.
There's no question
about it."
Robert Belzer
President of NJCAAN
Currently, most planes departing from
the Philadelphia International Airport fly
directly over the Delaware River and only
fly over more densely populated areas at
high altitudes. The new plan would allow
planes to fly at lower altitudes over certain areas of Delaware County, including
Upper Darby and Swarthmore, whose residents are unaccustomed to heavy air traffic. The FAA proposes that it will send out
planes in "fanning" effect, in which planes
make angled turns over areas surrounding the major eastern airports to clear the
airspace for subsequent arriving or
departing planes.
The FAA's decision comes amidst calls
for the organization to modernize its system of sending out planes. On Sept. 27,
President George W. Bush urged
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters to
"bring FAA into the 21st century" in a
public meeting between the two with the
Acting Administrator of the FAA Bobby
Sturgell. In the meeting, President Bush
also addressed proposals to form a passenger bill of rights, saying there was a lack
of communication between passengers
and airlines during delays.
The Delaware County Council immediately took action against the FAA as soon
as they released their final decision on
Sept. 5. A formal Petition For Review of
An Order of An Administrative Agency
was filed on Friday, Sept. 14, 2007 in the
United States Court of Appeals for the
third
in
Philadelphia,
circuit
Pennsylvania. According to Swarthmore
Borough Mayor Eck Gerner, who is one of
the 15 petitioners in the suit, the FAA will
be unable to proceed with redesign plans
until the suit is resolved. "It's my understanding that the FAA cannot arbitrarily
implement this part of the airspace
redesign until this hearing is held,"

Gerner said.

Along with Gerner, Geoff Semenuk,

Associate Director of Alumni Relations at
the college and Swarthmore Borough

THE PHOENIX

Council member in Environment, Parks
and Recreation, is also one of the petitioners.
"It's a petition to get a stay granted, to
stop the FAA from implementing the plan,
and the grounds of that is their failure to
meet the guidelines of the Environmental
Impact Statement," Semenuk said.

Statement,

Semenuk said. "The effect is that they
could exaggerate their problem by not
looking at the partial solution that they
had already undertaken."
Gerner emphasized that the effort
taken by the petitioners, which also
includes the Friends of the Heinz Wild
Refuge, has been one of complete bipartiThe petitioners include the

Republican Delaware County Councilman
Andrew Reilly, and both Republican and
Democrat parties are well-represented

"It's pretty clear that this is a very nice
opportunity and a breath of fresh air from
my perspective, because it shows that people are concerned across the board. It is
a bipartisan effort," Gerner said.
Delaware County is not the only community taking the FAA to court. Other
regional communities are prepared to
challenge the FAA's redesign, including
the area affected by the plan in New

The New Jersey Coalition Against

engineering
Professor
of
Carr
Everbach, who is on Joe Sestak's FAA
Expert Advisory Board, has found flaws
with the FAA's redesign as well as its
methodology in compiling data for its
Environmental Impact Statement.
"[When] the FAA came out with their
environmental impact statement, everyone was not surprised that it was extremely biased, extremely focused on justifying
on what the FAA wanted to do, [which
was], in their view, trying to increase the
efficiency of the airspace [while] ignoring
the people affected," Everbach said.
Along with other members of Sestak's
FAA Expert Advisory Board, Everbach
has submitted new compiled data to the
Government Accountability Office in an
effort to delay or modify FAA's implementation of their proposed airspace redesign
plan.
Though the FAA held 120 public meetings prior to the creation of its EIS,
Semenuk believes that the system failed
in this instance.
"I think it's a huge failing of the government and the FAA to lean on this public hearing system when the public couldn't possibly have anything to add, because
[since] they don't have the data, they are

being asked to imagine how loud and dangerous it will be," Semenuk said.
Everbach, who has expertise in the
area of acoustics noise propagation, does
not use the units of Day-Night Average

business, it'll affect business at all times
forward," Everbach said. "It's my view
and that of many others that the FAA

As to whether students have voiced
any concerns about the FAA's proposal,

but people in the Ville don't either. But
[students] will start having strong opinions as soon as the flights start rumbling

won't notice] until they start hearing it

Belzer's group has also compiled similar data concerning the errata and
flaws of the FAA's EIS. "[FAA is] mis-

representing the data, a total misrepresentation. There's no question about it.
Their margin of error is several deci-

bels," Belzer said.
FAA Public Affairs Contact Arlene
Murray was unable to comment on the
ongoing litigations due to strict confidentiality agreements. On the FAA Web
site, a press release from the
Washington Headquarters stated, "FAA
studies show this alternative will reduce
delays, complexity of the current air
traffic system, fuel consumption and
carbon emissions and aircraft noise."
"We're moving forward with this
project," Murray said.
Belzer and Semenuk are concerned
that the FAA might compile all lawsuits
into one suit. "It's possible that the FAA
will try to get all the suits combined,"
Semenuk said. "We brought ours, and it
turns out there are a bunch of others.
The FAA would seek to combine them
all, because it's easier to fight one in DC
than several in all these geographic
areas."

Red Cross blood drive returns to the college

Almost 250 willing students sign up to donate blood, as local need for blood continues to increase

The college welcomed the American
Red Cross to campus once again for the
semi-annual blood drive held in Upper
Tarble this Tuesday. Although the registration period for Swarthmore's drive was
shorter this year, local need for blood has
only increased. A large group of students
as well as faculty members came out to the

event and volunteered to donateblood.

"This is the most populated drive I've
seen. All who sign up here usually turn up
for their appointment," Payne said.
Students and staff are generally very
willing to offer blood donations as a
responsibility to the community.

McCabe reference librarian Bronwen
Densmore said, "Donating blood doesn't
take very much time or effort but is crucial to those who need it. You never know
when you'll be in a situation like that."
Similarly, David Stifler 'OB said that
participating in the blood drive "is one of
the most minimally inconveniencing ways
to help others."
The process is fairly simple. Donors
must be over 17 years of age, weigh at least
110 lbs and not have traveled to any malaria-risk countries in the preceding year in

order to participate.
On the day of the drive, Red Cross staff
set up survey stations that test blood pressure, pulse and iron content and determine risk for blood disease to certify donation eligibility.

The water tower would be the most likely location for Verizon to
place cell site to expand its cell phone service coverage.

Verizon in talks to
expand cell service
ance with all regulations."

BY RAMYA GOPAL
rgopall@swarthmore. edu

Verizon Wireless has been
planning, since last spring, to
expand its cell phone service
coverage around Swarthmore
College.
The company's interest in the
college is part of its "big plan
over the next ten years to have
fewer dropped calls," said Vice
President of Facilities and
Management Stu Hain who is
the main administrator overseeing this project. However, no
proposal has yet been put for-

ward, despite Verizon's promise
to submit one by early fall.
Verizon is specifically interested in placing a cell site in the
water tower behind the Science
Center.

The height of the tower and
the surrounding electrical conduit provides some of the necessary infrastructure, making it a
suitable location for Verizon.
Additionally, Swarthmore lies in
close proximity to route (1-476),
which sustains a high amount of
traffic and could also benefit
from increased cellular reception.
The anticipated proposal will
dictate the terms and conditions
required from Verizon and
would then pass through the
Swarthmore Borough Council.
According to Borough Manager
Jane Billings, the college is one

of the few sites that allows for
the construction of a cell phone
receptor.
"Our ordinance permits wireless communications facilities
by special exception in the IN
Institutional District, which
includes most of the college,"
Billings said in an e-mail. "A special exception means the applicant has to appear before the

The College's infrastructural

said Madalyn Baldanzi 'OB, while
recounting her experience as a

this past summer.
The Gilder Lehrman History
Scholars Program is a scholarship
program designed to award college sophomores and juniors who
have shown outstanding writing
and research skills in American
history. Scholars receive $2,200 in
addition to room and board while
preparing materials for publication. The scholars live together on
Columbia University's campus
studying rarely and never-before
published African-American abolitionist writings from the 18th
and 19th centuries.
Baldanzi, an honors history
major and english minor, spent
five weeks in New York City conducting primary-source research
and at one point, held in her

Baldanzi studied a pamphlet
by Venture Smith, a Connecticut
slave who eventually bought his

other scholars.

"The best part about Gilder

Lehrman was the people, by far,"
Baldanzi said. She said the scholars enjoyed the city's nightlife
together and on one occasion,
spent all day in a history scavenger hunt stretching the entire
distance of Central Park. "It kind

of captured the spirit of the summer, which was learning a litle bit
and having a lot of fun," Baldanzi
said.
According to Brendan Hughes,
Editorial and Communications
Assistant at the Gilder Lehrman
Institute of American History, the
15 scholars were selected among
300 applicants from over 150 colleges and universities in the
United States and Canada.
"It's a wonderful opportunity,
a coveted fellowship, a chance to
be working with original documents in American history and
meeting prominent historians in
the field," said history professor
Bruce Dorsey.
The institute has sponsored
the scholars program annually
since 2003. Scholars are awarded
stipends to go to NYC, where allexpenses including tuition, books,
field trips and transportation are

paid for. During the five weeks,

The scholars' introductions

Public Library, as well as

University at their disposal. "The
resources were one of the very
best things about the program. We
had an all access pass to every

In addition to learning about
Smith, Baldanzi said participating in the program was especially
rewarding for her on a personal
level. "The other people in the
program's different perspectives

Closed depression group provides privacy, support for students
Facilitators discuss different ways to structure closed meetings, CAPS Director Ramirez offers services
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
"The blues." everyone gets them, espe-

cially as winter approaches and the sluggish academic pace of the beginning of the
year speeds up. For some, however, "the

blues" is a gross understatement of the
complex and heavy emotions they experience every day. The Swarthmore
Depression Support Group, the newest
closed support group on campus, provides
a safe place for students suffering from
depression to express their emotions and

share their experiences with others.
Swarthmore College already runs

Counseling and Psychological Services in
Worth Health Center, which explains on
its Web site that it provides "psychological counseling and psychotherapy to students, and offers consultation to parents,
faculty and staff."
However, CAPS is different from the
Swarthmore Depression Support Group,
which Director of Counseling and
Psychological Services David Ramirez
described as "a support group, not a treat-

ment group."

Ramirez said that this was an important distinction. "The treatment process
can be facilitated by a support group," he
said. "I think [the support group] can be a
good thing. Students have a lot of credibility with each other as peers. I think it's
sometimes easier for people to talk to people their own age."
"I have taken advantage of Ramirez's
services, but we don't report to him," said

founder and co-moderator Elena Smith
'O9, underlining the SDSG's independence
from college-run programs.
Providing an opportunity for students
to talk openly with each other was precisely what the moderators of SDSG,
Smith and Lauren Kuzel 'O9, had in mind
when they created SDSG early this year.
"It's a group where students can come
together to learn that they're not alone,

that there are other students on campus

who deal with depression on a daily basis
as well," Smith said. "It's a place where
students can learn more about how to
cope with depression in the college environment, because this place has its own
challenges."
Smith began looking into creating a
support group for students with depression late last school year for personal reasons. "I thought a support group would be
a good idea," Smith said.
She met with Danielle Toaltoan 'O7,

who was a facilitator for the Swat
Survivor's Group last year, and was
inspired. "She gave me great advice about
starting a support group," Smith said.
Smith sent out an e-mail in the Reserved
Students Digest seeking co-moderators,
and eventually united with Kuzel. The
students met a few times to discuss their
visions and plans for the group.

"If the facilitators [of SDSG]
have any concerns at all
that they'd like to run by a
professional, I'd be
available."
David Ramirez
Director of Counseling and
Psychological Services
Establishing the group was a smooth
said Smith. After initially
requesting seed funds from Student
Council to pay for refreshments, the coprocess,

moderators decided that the presence of
others would suffice.
On Tuesday, Oct. 2, the group had their
third meeting on the second floor of the
Women's Resource Center from 9 p.m. to

10 p.m.

While Smith and Kuzel were reluctant
to go into detail about the meetings, to
respect members' privacy, they said that
they were satisfied with the attendance.
"We still welcome people to come," Smith

A member of Swarthmore Depression
Support Group who requested to remain
anonymous due to the difficulty of "coming out" in front of others brought up the
stigma that those with mental illness face
in society.

said.

Conversation is the means of communication of choice, though Smith says that
using art or other forms of expression is
"something to consider."
"I do caution people that listening is
participating," Smith said. "People can
derive great comfort from coming to meetings and listening to what other people
have to say."
To prepare for meetings, the moderators have put their heads together to
think of different ways to structure discussions, trying to find a balance between
focusing on certain issues and allowing
people to express themselves freely as
needed.
Ramirez has offered his professional
services to SDSG.
"If the facilitators [of SDSG] have any
concerns at all that they'd like to run by a
professional, I'd be available," Ramirez
said. "I would hope that anyone who's
currently struggling would be in treatment here [at CAPS] or privately."
SDSG remains a closed group. "I think
it's because other people can be very judgmental," Kuzel said. "The point of the
group is to talk to people who've been

through [depression]."
"We want people who come to be comfortable. To come out in front of people
who haven't had depression can be hard,"

Smith said.
The group also requires that members
have been suffering for three months or
more.
"We felt that short-term depression is
very different from long-term depression," Smith said. "We want to make sure
that just people who've dealt with this on
a long-term basis are attending."

"I've experienced a lot of stigma associated with mental illness, or people who

know that about me have preconceived
judgments about how I should act, and I
don't feel comfortable with that," he said.
"I have had too many experiences in high
school to be able to come out publicly."
According to the National Institute of
Mental Health Web site, "[depression] is
not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away."
Currently, as the group is still just getting up on its feet, the SDSG will focus its
attention on providing a comfortable
forum for people suffering from depression.

Eventually, the group may make
efforts to change the stigma associated
with mental illness and raise awareness
about depression, the moderators said. If
the group did host a forum or start a project, it would probably be in addition to
the closed group meetings.
"It's easy to feel isolated here," said
Kuzel. "There are lots of hiding places on
this campus. If you want to be alone, it's
easy to achieve that."

Congress approves College Cost Reduction Act
BY BRIAN WASHBURN
ARKANSAS TRAVELER (U. ARKANSAS)
(U-WIRE) Enacting the largest increase in federal student aid since the 1944 post-World War II G.I. Bill, President
George W Bush signed the College Cost Reduction and
Access Act last Thursday, which will increase the Pell
Grant program by more than $ll billion over a period of
five years and cut interest rates on Stafford loans in half in
the next four years.

"Ultimately it will affect the benefits
that lenders will offer students."
Curtis Johnson
President and chief operating
officer of the Student Funding
Group LLC
Changes provided by the act started to go into effect on
Monday.
"We're excited that there is more funding for higher education," said Haley Chitty, assistant director for communications at the National Association of Financial Aid
Administrators. "The Pell grant increase is long overdue."

The bill will also help more university students gain
eligibility for financial aid because it changes the
method of calculating financial need, according to
Yvonne Hubbard, director of Student Financial Services

at the University of Virginia.
"The government is looking at need analysis and
bringing it into 21st century," Hubbard said.
Additionally, the bill cuts subsidies given to student
loan providers, which takes away from lenders' profits.
"They are tightening up on the lending community,"
Hubbard said. "You are going to see more and more
where Congress and the president are looking to the
banking community to be more responsible to students
and the country and to make less of a profit."
Others point out that cutting the lenders' subsidies
could significantly reduce the benefits offered to student.
"Ultimately it will affect the benefits that lenders will
offer students," said Curtis Johnson, president and chief
operating officer of the Student Funding Group, LLC.

According to Chitty, a bill cutting government subsidies to lenders was also passed last year.
"It has bee.n a pattern for several years to reduce the

Halloween party not Halcyon undergoes new changes
to return to ML dorm
BY MELISSA CRUZ

mcruzl@swarthmore.edu

BY KATE WALTON

kwaltol@swarthmore. edu

The campus-wide Halloween
party will not be returning to its
traditional location in Mary Lyon
for yet another year, but instead
might make a permanent move to
Upper Tarble and Paces. The party
will now be hosted by the Student
Activities Council.
The Residential Assistants of
Mary Lyon voiced several concerns
including the liability for an often
out-of-control party, the inability of
the Breakfast Room to contain the
estimated 800 guests and the designation of only four public toilets for
the guests. Also, the dorm's location
in a residential neighborhood poses
additional problems. "It's a terrible
fire hazard. I wouldn't even want to
think about how catastrophic it

could be if there was a fire" said
Tally Sharma 'O9, an RA in Mary
Lyon. "The Breakfast Room itself is
a big, good space. The only thing is
there's the whole problem about the
bottleneck," Sharma said, in reference to the small staircase and sole
entrance that leads from the first
floor common room into the
Breakfast Room where most of the
party occurs.
Mark Kharas 'OB, another RA in
Mary Lyon, described the parties of
past years as 'dangerous, loud and
rowdy." Despite past attempts to
block off the rest of the dorm by barricading the halls and stairways

with furniture, party-goers have a
tendency of sneaking past them,

seeking out more bathrooms. The
majority of bathrooms in the dorm
are semi-private and accessible
only through dorm rooms, a fact
which does not stop some students.
"Lots of people get drunk, rooms get
broken into, and windows get urinated into," Kharas said. Besides
the logistical problems facing ML,
the RAs also worry about the legal

implications of hosting such a large
event, especially given its residential location. With town residents
living within such proximity, the
police are apt to be called with noise
level complaints.
"If police were given reason to
enter and cited all the people drinking underage, the ML RAs who
signed the party permit would be
held liable. It's something that you
cannot require the ML RAs to do,"
said Christopher Green 'O9, resident
of ML and Breakfast Room coordinator.
Since no other groups stepped
forward to host the Halloween
event, the Student Activities

Council has taken over. Like last
year, the party will be centered in
Upper Tarble, but this year it will
remain a dry space. In additional to
the space in Upper Tarble, though,
Paces will be open. The hall outside
Paces will be turned into a haunted
house complete with chains, spooky
sounds and ghosts, through which
partygoers will enter in order to get
to the bar and cafe where tables and
chairs will be set up. "We wanted to
make it accessible to the whole campus," said Anna Mello 'OB, SAC CoChair, about the decision to host it
again Upper Tarble. Its large space
and centralized location make it an
ideal place to host such a big event.
But will this become the new, permanent home for Swarthmore's
annual Halloween party? "Maybe
we could start a new tradition,"
Mello said.
However, the RAs of ML do plan
on hosting an event this year. One
option is a repetition of the Dinner
Mystery Party held last year in
which up to 100 guests were invited
to come in costume and watch residents of the dorm perform a murder
mystery play while eating food prepared in the dorm's kitchen, an

event which Green called a "good
success."

SDS redefined on campus

From SDS, p.

"But I really think [the '6os were]
a heyday of activism
Now in the
year 2007, there is such an opportunity to come back to that radical
activism and to restructure SDS,"
Sufrin
said.
"Swarthmore
Progressive Action Coalition held a
meeting for all the progressive
groups on campus, and I asked
them, 'Are there radical groups on
campus?' and they pointed me right
to SDS."
...

Clark values SDS because the
group intends to share its viewpoints with the broader activist
community. "I think that it's really
important to escape that high school
mentality of holding a viewpoint

Swarthmore's SDS is also in contact with its partner groups at neighboring schools, Haverford College
and Bryn Mawr College.
The leaders of Haverford's
Students Toward a New Democracy
and Bryn Mawr's SDS are on the
Swarthmore SDS's listserv, opening
doors to future collaboration. "As
students, our lives are very busy,
and by working together we hope to
be able to drastically increase the
amount of work that we are able to
do," said a senior Haverford student
and STAND member Rob Korobkin
in an e-mail.
Bryn Mawr senior and SDS
member Dina Mazina, also believes
SDS will open students' eyes to a
world and future beyond college.
"I think the revival of Swat SDS,
and SDS in general, says something
very interesting about the current
state of our society," Mazina said in
an e-mail. "I'm glad to see a group at
Swarthmore, as well as here at Bryn
Mawr, that has a national affiliation. I hope it helps all of us get out
of our respective bubbles."

The college's yearbook, The Halcyon, has been
experiencing financial and publishing problems
that interfered with the production of the 2006 edition of the yearbook. The Halcyon, first established
in 1884, is a student-run organization and is funded
through the Student Budget Committee. About five
years ago, the SBC decided to make this annual collaboration of photos, shout-outs and memorable
events free to all students enrolled in the College
during the year of publication. Prior to that, it was
free only to the graduating seniors.
"The budget for The Halcyon comes from the
student activities fund, a few commercial advertisements, as well as student personalizations.
However, as last year was the first year students
were able to do personalizations, it wasn't received
as well as was anticipated," said Sung Choi 'OB,

Editor-in-Chief and Administrative Editor for this
year. "The senior boosters were what funded the
coloration of the 2007 edition."
As for the actual publication process, The
Halcyon typically undergoes a long process of
"proofing," which is essentially editing and proofreading by both The Halcyon staff and the publishing company, Jostens. "Ideally, we try to get [yearbooks] out by the end of the October following graduation. However, it is not uncommon for the
process to be upheld for various reasons, and
delayed by up to one or two months," Choi said.
However, the 2006 edition of The Halcyon experienced complications, which have pushed back its
finalized publication by over a year. Due to severe
understaffing and a resulting lack of structure in
the organization, the creation and editing processes of the yearbook suffered. In addition, technical
difficulties arose when the uploaded files were
found to be corrupt or missing and had to be resent
to Jostens for re-proofing.
After troubleshooting several more proofing
problems, the 2006 Halcyon was ready for the press
by January of 2007.

As is customary, the allotted budget for The
Halcyon allows for the books to be sent individually to each of the graduating seniors. However, by
the time the 2006 edition was sent to the press last
April, it was too late to campus-mail the books to
the Class of 2007. This led to a budgeting dilemma
that called for the action of the SBC.
Choi said that mailing a yearbook to each student would cost four dollars per person. "The 2006
yearbooks were mailed to the class of 2006 in June.

As for the class of 2007, we have the funds for the
projected cost of mailing the books to them, but it
might turn out being more than we expected. In
that case, The Halcyon editors would need to go to
SBC to request the supplementary funds," SBC
manager Giannina Esquivel 'OB said.
"Our biggest problem with the yearbook was a
lack of supervision. The SBC manager usually has
no training or knowledge as a yearbook editor and
so has difficulty knowing what needs to be done on
a weekly basis to get the yearbook out in a timely
manner," Esquivel said.
Fortunately, the new Administrative Editor
position has been created to solve just that. Choi
has been assigned this role for the 2008 edition of
The Halcyon. Choi's tasks will involve acting as a
liaison between the SBC and The Halcyon.
"It is a position which will be filled by a previous editor, so knowledge of how a yearbook functions will already be available to SBC," Esquivel
said. The Administrative Editor will supervise the

editorial board, advise them on what deadlines
need to be met and how best to meet them and
report all progress to SBC.
"We try to oversee that things are running as
they should without overstepping our boundaries.
Sometimes, it is best to have fewer members
involved, each with their own say in the
process[es], and actually, we never really had a say
to begin with," Assistant Coordinator of Student
Activities Paury Flowers said on the topic of
administration interaction with student-run organizations
In the past, the heavy workload of being editor
of The Halcyon also figured into the difficulty of its

publication.

"Another problem was the vast amount of work
that was expected of the editor," Esquivel
said. "The editor normally worked 20 hours per
week, but towards the end of the year, when the
book was being compiled, it became more than
that."
A solution has been found in hiring an editorial
board consisting of four editors, each working for
five hours per week rather than giving the work-

load to one sole editor.
"We are confident that this will solve the past
problems we have had," Esquivel said of the
changes made in the coordination and inter-departmental communication ofThe Halcyon.
"From my understanding, the 2007 edition of
The Halcyon is progressing well and has not had
any major complications with its progress,"
Flowers said.

This past summer in
India, I lay listless on a
slate bed of cotton and
spice, infinitely pleased
to find my hand reflected
light. A volume of
Marquez lay open across
my chest, covering my
pectorals like a bra. I had
gone to Gujarat to recover, and stubbornly I was.
After two months of
volunteering, I was as
fatigued as a Chaucerian
mule; motionless, I tried
to heal whatever odd and
unmerited wounds I had

incurred having thrown
or sex or soup
myself to the volition of
the higher Indian powers, not like Picasso, just
men and men and endless men, with mustaches as cruel as hurricanes.
I had gone to my grandmother's house, as I said, to heal. In that bullet soft bed, and the weeks before it, aboard endless train rides and village dirt divans fatigued, I had made a companion of Marquez. I vowed
to myself that I'd make a literary pilgrimage to Mexico City to behold

words

the saint before he dies.
I can see it like a scene from a biography: the young Spanish-speaking litterateur arrives in time to witness the death of the great Gabriel
Garcia Marquez. If I understand anything, the last creature on earth
he'd like to speak to would be.. .well, his love. But second to last would
be a budding writer to bestow his spirit upon like a blessing.

Philly Kick-Off a success
BY SUNNY COWELL

scoweill@swarthmore.edu

Love in the Time of Cholera (1985) "He had gone to wander along
the jetties, reciting love poetry into the wind and crying with joy until

daybreak."
Love in the Time of Cholera is, without discredit or shame, the
most beautiful book I have ever read in my life. Marquez's immaculate phrasing, stirring passages and unequivocal romance spellbind
the reader, bringing him, at times, to his knees. I learned what it
means to feel a text, to read it aloud to yourself and let it own you, like

the erotic notions Jeanette Winterson goes on about with her books

(that saucy fox, she).
Marquez draws sex in a manner more tasteful than Lawrence, far
richer than Neruda and more enchanting then Coelho. For example,
"The impassive Florentino Ariza had not had a moment of inner peace
as he confronted the fascinating spectacle of that fierce black woman
smeared with shit and love in the face ofbattle." And again: "Angeles
Alfaro left as she had come, with her tender sex and her sinner's cello,
on an ocean liner that flew the flag of oblivion, and all that remained
of her on the moonlit roofs was a fluttered farewell with a white handkerchieflike a solitary sad dove on the horizon, as if she were a verse
from the Poetic Festival."
I could see it all in those lines, the women of my past, the days
ahead toward which I sail lamenting, flying "the flag of oblivion," and
I sigh, reading, agreeing that "sex is the consolation you have when
you can't have love."
Memories of My Melancholy Whores (2004) "I have never done
anything except write...and if I have embarked upon this enterprise it is
because I trust in the light shed by how much I have read in my life."
Marquez was nearly 100 years old when he published this book. In
the work, you can see the candor that comes with old age, the shamelessness, the confessions of a life well-lived. He chuckles as he writes,
recalling his relations with the beautiful Columbian women of his
past, and I wish that I myself am such at that age, likewise sheepish
with little regret, bemused by a life lived so markedly. Through longing and sacrifice, tedium, woe, he finally finds fulfillment in waiting
and reminds us it's worth the strife. Gabriel Garcia Marquez: for the
amorous, mourning and hopelessly romantic.
See also: 100 Years of Solitude, which Pablo Neruda called
"perhaps the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since
the Don Quixote of Cervantes."

THE PHOENIX

Last Saturday, students from all over the
Philadelphia region took a break from their studies to celebrate Campus Philly Kick-Off. Event
attendees enjoyed free music from Talib Kweli and
other artists while perusing an involvement fair,
Motocross event and other festivities in the backdrop of downtown Philly. With college IDs, stu-

dents received free entrance to several cultural
venues such as The Academy of Natural Sciences,
Free Library of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia
Museum of Art and the Rodin Museum.

"I loved the event.Talib was so
good. I was looking forward to
the event for two weeks and it
was great that Swat coordinated
transportation for us."
Linda Corchado 'OB
Patricia Kelly 'OB said she took advantage of the
chance to see Philadelphia. "I've never experienced Philadelphia like that," she said. "This was
my first concert."
Besides live music on several stages, there were
other attractions, such as booths frpm local nonprofit organizations, food vendors and a Red Bull
Motocross exhibit.
Swarthmore provided shuttles from Ben West
parking lot to Philadelphia from 9:30 a.m. to 7:30
p.m. Even though the shuttles were supposed to be
convenient, I had to wait over an hour along with
a group of other students for a shuttle as a result of
bad traffic.
When the bus arrived within close proximity to

October 4, 2007

the main stage, we were pleasantly surprised to
see a motorcyclist speeding up a ramp surrounded
by a crowd of cheering college students. Students
represented Drexel University, University of
Pennsylvania, Temple University and many other
schools in the city.
According to Eva Mckend 'll, who organized a
Facebook event for Kweli's performance, "the only
real bummer about the event was that there wasn't
a lot of Swarthmore presence."
Of course, Swatties had a lot of work so it was
not possible for the majority of students to make it
to the event. Some students- from Temple and
UPenn performed spoken word pieces and hip-hop
dances to open for Kweli.
Rock groups The Ataris and Against Me! performed on the main stage before Kweli arrived at
about 6 p.m. Kweli performed on time, unlike last
year's headliner rapper Fat Joe, who arrived an
hour and a half late.
Kweli is known as one of the best rappers in
alternative hip-hop. His performance was wellreceived by an audience of about 1,000 dancing college students. Students grooved to the heavy beats
and melodious hooks sung by Kweli's two backup
singers.
For most of the concert, recorded music, singers
and heart-throbbing bass and drums rang out to
accompany Kweli's rapping. The rapper performed
a combination of '9os hip-hop along with his own
compositions such as his hits "Get By," "I Try" and
"Hot Thing," along with some other songs from his
new album "Ear Drum." At certain points in the
performance, Kweli rapped without any melody or
beat, displaying his skills as a talented MC.
Despite the small Swarthmore presence, Campus
Philly provided an awesome study break for the
Swatties

that did attend.

"I loved the event. It was a great opportunity to
go out into Philly
and it was free," Linda
Corchado 'OB said, "Talib was so good. I was looking forward to the event for two weeks and it was

Blobbing

BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS

azalokol@swarthmore.edu

For those of us who are new to the Hunt, or who
just don’t have a clue which monsters are which, this
character guide might be useful. So useful, in fact,
that you should probably cut this article out right
now and keep it in your wallet forever and always,
even when you’re not hunting Dactyls
after all,
you never know when you’ll be attacked by a vicious,
deadly cat, and then what will you do? Lucky for you,
I sat down with Daniel Jamison ’08, one of the presidents of Psi Phi, to find out all about the different
characters in this year’s Pterodactyl Hunt.
—

If you thought the mongoose was
nature’s assassin, you were
wrong: it's the cat. Obviously the

monsters. To beat them, all you have to do is hit them
on the trash bag. Keep a look out, though, for the
they’re better armed than regular
racial Kings
Ores and Goblins, and so you’ll most likely need a
couple of people to take them down. The reward,
though, is that they also give out better loot.
Kobolds; Like Ores and Goblins, Kobolds are
basic monsters you can kill by stabbing them in the
chest with that most deadly of weapons, the foam
sword. They’re armed with daggers and buckles, and
the Kobold King has a spear. If that sounds fairly
non-threatening to you, I suggest you think twice.
Judging by the fact that the fencing team will be
playing the Kobolds this year, I’d say that they’ll be
able to put up a pretty good fight.
Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and
Michelangelo, armed with twin samurai swords, sai,
quarterstaves and nunchakus, can’t be hit from
behind. To kill them, you’ll have to hit them from the
front by hitting them on their trash bags, since their
sturdy turtle shells keep their backs safe from your
tricky sneak attacks.
Jabberwock: You’ll have to aim high to kill the
Jabberwock, and that’s all I can say.

Troll: The Troll has a giant club and a “specific
target area.” Though Jamison wouldn’t tell me what
it was, he did say that it’d be pretty easy to figure
out. Although the troll won’t give you gold if you kill
it, it will give you a special prize!
Hydra: The Hydra has two heads, and each head
has a claw. Killing the Hydra might be somewhat of a
project; you’ll first have to hit it on the trash bag, and
then kill both heads quickly before the other has a
chance to come back.
Werewolf: You won’t be able to slay the werewolf
with your foam sword; you’ll need a different
weapon. I can’t say what that weapon is now, but
Jamison tells me that if you go to the shop on the day
of the Hunt, you’ll be able to figure out what it is you
need.
Vampire and Shade: One is deadly, and one isn’t.
Which is which? You’ll have to wait until the day of
the Dactyl Hunt and figure it out for yourself.
Baby Dactyls: Baby Dactyls are armed with
squirt guns. Something in the shop will make them
more docile, you just have to find it.
Sphinx: The sphinx is invulnerable until you
answer its riddle. Once you solve the puzzle, though,
go ahead and kill it!
The Black Knight: Fighting the Black Knight is
engaging in a special kind of battle. You must defeat
him in single combat, and you’ll get some advanced
weapons, made by the Black Knight himself, if you
decide to take on the challenge. If you do kill the
Knight, you earn the right to talk to the Oracle, who
can answer and questions about the Hunt.
Cat: If you thought the mongoose was nature’s
assassin, you were wrong: it’s the cat. Obviously the
most threatening of them all, the cat kills at random.
According to Jamison, the cat can be bribed
Fish Monger: The Fish Monger sells fish and cannot be killed. What you actually do with the fish
remains a mystery
for now! (Sounds secretive,
right?)
The Three Dactyls: The three Pterodactyls are
the deadliest monsters in the hunt. Each is armed
with a super soaker
undoubtedly the deadliest
weapon of them all. If a Dactyl hits you, you’re out of
the game. Dactyls are invulnerable until you have a
hunting license. Once you do get a license, you have
to hit both wing targets and the Dactyl’s chest. Each
Dactyl is guarded by three guards, so a team of four

Zacarias delights with Suzy Q and steaks

BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu
The Saturday night Target shuttle is an unusual place for
an interview, but Gabriel Za*carias 'O9 is an unusual guy.
Bouncing between Parrish Circle and Target, I learned the
words to "You Don't Own Me," tasted a special spice blend
from California and got to know Swarthmore's most effervescent van driver.
Many know Zacarias as the fixer offlank steaks, the man
behind the wonderful smells emanating from the Sharpies
wok station. Once every four weeks, Sharpies makes flank
steaks and Zacarias is there to make them better. "Sharpies
can't devote the amount of time [needed to make good
steak]," Zacarias said. He usually arrives at 4 p.m. and grabs
the steaks before they get overcooked from sitting too long
behind the counters. He then proceeds to re-season and cook
the meat. Zacarias offers his steaks to his friends and all
those who ask him to fix up their meat.

“[Food] brings people together."
Gabriel Zacarias ’O9
For vegetarians and those unfamiliar with beef cuts,
flank steak comes from the hindmost underbelly of a cow.
According to the Angus Beef website, flank meat “is lean,
muscular and very flavorful.”
How does Zacarias improve upon an already delicious
cut and produce steaks described by Josh Lipman ’ll as
“restaurant quality?” The answer lies in a spice mix known
as Suzy Q. Suzy Q is a simple combination of garlic, salt, pep-

per and parsley developed in Zacarias' hometown of Santa
Maria, California. Zacarias is (truthfully) rumored to carry
a bottle of the spice at all times.
Zacarias began cooking for his family at age seven. Thus,
he sees food as a way to unite people and build a sense of
community. "[Food] brings people together," he said. "No
one should ever be going to Sharpies alone."
For Zacarias, food can even ease potentially uncomfortable social situations. In order to meet new people, he once
walked around his dorm with a big tray ofcookies and ended
up making a close friend in the process.
As well known as he is for his enthusiasm for cooking,
Zacarias' personality bursts forth when he drives the Target
shuttle. He blasts show tunes and pop songs and keeps conversations going with his passengers. "Hike showing people
a good time," he said. Zacarias recounted talking to Sarah
Ting 'lO about swing dancing while driving on the Baltimore
Pike. After the pair jokingly discussed stopping and swinging, Zacarias pulled over and got out to dance with Ting.
Judging from this incident, anybody who takes the shuttle
with Zacarias at the wheel is in for a crazy ride.
However, Zacarias has a deeply serious side. A political
science major, he intends to go to law school after graduation and hopes to become a judge. Zacarias feels that there is
currently little faith- in the legal system, a problem that he
aspires to change. Zacarias has also been actively involved
in two summertime youth leadership conferences. One
teaches young people how to "dismantle oppression" while
the other serves as a springboard for "future Latino, Latina
leaders of America."
Student, chef and driver, Zacarias is many things
but
never downbeat. "I am in love with laughing. I don't like
moroseness," he said. Like Bette Midler sings in "You Don't
Own Me," Zacarias truly lives his life the way that he wants
to live it... all he asks is to let him be himself.

Professor shares the 'invisible stories' of Guatemala
women, in Guatemala, a phenomenon that
has come to the political forefront in the

last five years.
Since 2001, about 2,500 women have
been murdered in Guatemala. Two cases
of femicide occur every day, and the
women killed are usually between the
ages of 13 and 36. Aldana began her lecture
with a stream of statistics like these, driv-

ing home to her audience the depth and

horrific nature of the femicide issue. "[I
had] no idea it was that serious," Andrea
Cornejo 'lO said, vocalizing the reaction of

the audience to the stark reality depicted
statistics.

Professor Raquel Aldana speaks to the
students about the Guatemala femicides.

Rape.

Torture.

Mutilation. Bodies

dumped in empty lots. These are the
words and phrases Professor Raquel
Aldana uses to describe femicide in

Guatemala.

Aldana is a professor of law at the
University of Nevada. A devoted human
rights activist, Aldana gave a lecture at
Swarthmore on Monday, Oct. 1, as part of
the Latino Heritage Month events. Her lecture focused on femicide, or the killing of

14

Aldana continued her lecture with a
discussion of the causes of the situation,
honing in on why femicide is an extremely difficult problem to address, and proposing potential solutions.
In each area, Aldana discussed both the
generally accepted theories and her own
opinions. This was, in my opinion, what
made the lecture powerful. Aldana was
not giving a lecture based merely on
research. Instead, she was speaking from
personal experience. She drew her own
conclusions on the issue of femicide after
having visited Guatemala and having spoken to those involved, both the prosecu-

tors and the victims.
Determining the cause of femicide in
Guatemala is extremely difficult as it
stems from so many different sources.
Historically, Guatemala has been in a civil

war for the past few decades. This culture
of violence has created a generation "that
does not know peace," Aldana said, and

therefore, this generation is more likely to
commit violent crimes.
In addition, there is an "extreme wealth

inequality" that exists in Guatemala.
Although, overall, the country is relatively wealthy, about 75 percent of its citizens
are living below the poverty level. The
women who are typically targeted are
among this segment of the population, and
are often housewives, students or

unskilled workers.
There are also many gangs in
Guatemala, and thus gang violence is also
viewed as a cause of the femicide issue.
The Guatemalan government has tried to
address the problem, but in an extremely
limited way. Another disturbing aspect of
this issue is the feminoscide, or state sanction of femicide, in Guatemala. In fact, the
capital of Guatemala has been referred to
as a "killer's paradise." Since the targeted
women are often in gangs or of the lower
class, there exists a perception of them as
"bad women," as though the victims themselves are to blame.
Also, there are extremely limited
resources devoted to this issue. The few
police and prosecutors assigned to combat
femicide have heavy caseloads and often
the families of the victims end up doing
much of the (often dangerous) work. The
police have no "DNA or ballistic capabilities," Aldana said, and thus 95 percent of
cases have no forensic evidence of any
kind. Consequently, there is a reliance on
witnesses for convictions, but "the fear of
retaliation is deep" and few witnesses are
willing to testify. Less than 10 percent of
cases are even investigated, and "since
2001, only 14 have ever been convicted" of
committing femicide.
Countries like the United States and
several non-profit organizations have
attempted to help solve this issue.
However, money given to Guatemala for
this purpose has been mostly funneled to
the police and other governmental agen-

October 4, 2007

cies which are extremely ineffective
because "the [political] system itself is
very, very flawed." Aldana said that countries like the US compound the problem of
femicide with "trade agreements that

leave workers unprotected."

Since the targeted women
are often in gangs or of
the lower class, there
exists a perception of
them as "bad women."
Aldana believes that a good way to
address this problem would be to give
money to create social programs for
women. Such programs could help women
"find a place they can turn to when facing
violence," Aldana said, pointing to statistics from the U.S. that show social programs have indeed helped decrease violence against women.
Aldana concluded her lecture by calling femicide«an "understudied issue" and
urging students to learn more about it and
to be active in trying to prevent femicide.
Rita Kamani 'OB said that she especially appreciated how Aldana's lecture
brought a "specific issue to the forefront."
This was important for those aware of the
poverty and violence in countries like
Guatemala, but only in a vague sense.
Aldana's lecture brought to light a very
specific issue
femicide and personalized it. Gender-motivated violence is a
deep and complicated problem in
Guatemala, but the more people who are
aware of femicide and active against it,
the more visible it becomes. For those who
attended Aldana's leture, femicide is no
longer an "invisible story."

'Universe' makes for mindless eye candy
BY ABIGAIL GRABER
agraberl@swarthmore.edu

Julie Taymor excels at making horror beautiful and
beauty meaningful. Art-house audiences have high
expectations for the director whose "Titus" revamped
Shakespeare's slasher-porn into high art and whose
"Frida" transformed high art into a powerful story.
Though one looks forward to similar feats from "Across
the Universe," a trippy, '6os musical constructed around
Beatles songs, one is tempted to watch it and simply murmur, "Mmmm, pretty."
So, so pretty. "Across the Universe" is absolutely
worth seeing, in a very literal sense. Taymor may have
only made two or three films, but she's clearly watched a
whole lot more, especially the work of Baz Lurhmann.
Both he and Taymor make films to be seen more than
heard; it's their exquisite pictorial sense that make their
work worthwhile. I therefore plan to address "Across the
Universe'"s visual magnificence for as long as possible in
what will quickly reveal itself to be an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid analyzing the plot.
But first, some background: "Across the Universe" follows young Liverpoolian dockworker Jude (Jim
Sturgess, a dead-ringer for Paul McCartney) after he
jumps ship in America. Jude hooks up with Max (Joe
Anderson), a Princeton dropout who moves with his new
pal to New York, where they are joined by Max's sister
Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Love blossoms between Jude
and Lucy, Uncle Sam calls Max to the front as the
Vietnam War revs into gear and the actors sing their way
through about 30 Beatles songs with varying degrees of
success. (Sturgess and Anderson vocally outshine Wood,
though Dana Fuchs trumps all as their bluesy, soulsinging landlady.)
The fact that the visual side of the film surpasses the
soundtrack is impressive in itself. Taymor selects each
shot with precision, wasting no time on boring composition or pointless movement. The camera is busy, but
never disjointed or unfocused. Neither is the exquisitely
detailed material that Taymor packs into each frame.

"Across the Universe" mixes and matches artistic genres
it seamlessly integrates Broadway sets into industrial
office buildings; choreographed dancers share screen
time with bizarre puppets and Kabuki masks in inventive, sometimes disturbing, medleys.
The art direction of the film culminates in Max's
examination before the draft board. Set to The Beatles' "I
Want You," the sequence is a modernist-fascist-cubistdance extravaganza. With puppets. And if that doesn't
make you want to see the movie, perhaps the description
of a troupe of skivvied recruits bearing the Statute of
Liberty across a field of miniature palm trees will.
Anderson gets his moment in the sun, shining through
the bedlam with precise movement and a terrified desperation. It's fortunate for him that he performs so well
here, as the script forgets about him once he ships out.
But that's plot, and we're ignoring it.

Alas, while the artistic side of the film
rises magnificently to the challenge,
its hollow core undermines its
appeal. We have at last arrived at the
much-dreaded plot analysis.
Of course, the music around which the film is constructed holds its own at the center of the visual cornucopia. Taymor clearly intends to universalize "Across the
Universe" by covering dozens of Beatles' songs by way of
I caught a sprinkling of Pat
transgenerational styles
Benatar, a pinch of Paul Simon, a dash of Janis Joplin
and a heaping portion of smoldering-hot-British-guysinging-with-mournful-soul (pick your artist, pick your
generation). You want deeper analysis of the tunes, go
ask the music critic my repertoire is easily exhausted
by your average frat party. The point is, "Across the

Universe" was conceived to appeal across time, as well as
across artistic medium.
Alas, while the artistic side of the film rises magnificently to the challenge, its hollow core undermines its
appeal. We have, at last, arrived at the much-dreaded plot
analysis.

"Across the Universe" is wont to deal in common

tropes of the '6os that have long since eroded into cliches. You get your rebellious artists, your radical protestors, your cross-country acid trip in a rainbow-colored
bus. When the Muppets have covered your material, it's
time to find more fertile grounds.
Taymor's aesthetics may simply get the better of her.
The film's ultimate message seems to be that Jude, Lucy
why, it is
and Max are just too pretty to be so afflicted
criminal of the government to draft a man with such

impeccably bleached hair! It's hard to connect viscerally
with people who are so very attractively shaggy, so perfectly boho, so flawlessly un-chic.

And for a film that covers a broad swath of the '6os,
the main characters are also all jarringly, blindingly
white, a problem that is more than merely aesthetic. The
few minorities, racial and sexual, are more a part of the
film's colorful palette than its plot.
Perhaps Taymor figures she's earned her meditation
on the plights of the pretty and privileged after "Frida,"
which was about a Mexican communist bisexual woman
with a unibrow. But "Across the Universe" strikes the
wrong tone when it deals cursorily with events like the
Detroit race riots and the assassination of MLK. One
only has to see the much more agonizing coverage of the
latter in this summer's "Talk to Me" to grasp "Across the
Universe"'s shortcomings.
The emotional core finally comes through in Jude and

Lucy's relationship. Taymor is clearly most passionate

about this aspect of the film, and one suspects "Across
the Universe" could have been stronger overall if she had
lent her aesthetic to a pure love story instead of attempting to paint an era. The film's stated message, after all, is
not "You Say You Want a Revolution," but "All You Need
is Love."

Dalva disposes of dreariness with delightful 'Dactyls
Dorm II smells like a particularly good
Lindburger cheese, MarkEcko is a sporting
hero, the identity of the Bone Doctor is still
unclear and Arrested Development still hasn't come back, but instead of hyper-ventilating into your jerk chicken, why not
embrace all that the college has to offer during the harvest season? (The fact that the
above run-on monstrosity had 50 words cut
from it and still resembles Proust is a bad
sign for both the world and my general san-

ity.)

ADAM DALVA
The Real Old Prospector
As leaves and attitudes begin to fall and
the seasonal rush of flannel reaches critical
mass, it is all too easy for an autumnal

Swarthmorean to begin to develop a complacent bubble of routine that shelters us
from cold weather and unfamiliar activities.
Class in the morning, a window table at

Sharpies, class in the afternoon, dinner in
Tarble, McCabe and sleep can become a constant cycle that even the timeliest Mafia
study break or whispered gossip-fest can do

little to alter.
Look, I understand that this is a trying
time in all of our lives: midterms are somehow coming, the Canadian Loonie is more
valuable than the dollar, Kevin Federline is
a positive father figure, the High School
Musical 2 soundtrack has sold more albums
in America over the last two months than
Tom Waits has in his entire career, New

16

The admissions catalogue can claim that
the strengths of Swarthmore are our 8:1 student-teacher ratio, honors program and
exceptional level of activism, but after three
years here, I can tell you with an all-timelow amount of cynicism that the real highlight of the fall is the Psi Phi Pterodactyl
Hunt. (Look at the unpronounced alliteration! Do you think they planned it?)
Now, I am not going to make a claim that
the event is anything like "300," but the
opportunity to get a sword, jump over monsters, sprint from werewolves and death
and finally make a run at a giant running
piece of plastic covered in garbage bags
with everything to win and even more to
lose is as close to adrenaline as I have come

in decades.
I still remember accidentally coming
across this event during my freshman year
and, in the midst of a short-lived moment of
attempted worldliness, dismissing it with a
pshaw and going to a strings concert with
some co-eds. In retrospect, I feel worse
about this decision than I do about forgetting to wear black on Jena 6 day. Although
normally the Science Center is terrifying,
for one night only, it is a necessity to get out
of the routine and court the madness.

There are just so many facets to consider
about the Hunt. Is it worth it to get the silver knife? What is the best strategy to kill
the damn thing? Will Chu on This make a
return to the campus? Is stabbing someone
in the back a good idea or a really good idea?
I, for one, want the answers. Trust me, if
you participate in this you will soon be
basking in an euphoria akin to finding out
about "In Rainbows." (This really actually
deserves its own column. I think Radiohead
might have just broken the record industry,
or at least made every hipster brain in
America explode. For god's sake, Pitchfork
is so happy that they seem to have forgotten
how to be snarky.)

Although the Pterodactyl Hunt is appeal-

the fall season does present
other incentives to creep out of your room
and avoid the rut. As we get further in the
semester and the essay assignment rate
doubles, Pub Nite begins to transform from
ing enough,

a claustrophobic sweat-dripping demolition

derby suitable for those who favor auto-erotic asphyxiation to a more docile setting with
a pleasurable absence of the sardine feeling
and enough fruit juice to go around. I know
it is on a Thursday, and I know that saying
this is intrinsically counter-productive, but
showing up to a mid-season half-empty Pub
Nite is a surprising delight.
In addition, for those who are tiring of
the frat-Paces cycle of most weekend
evenings and are not terrified of Barnies,
the Olde Club shows usually do not involve
reggaeton,
Beirut
or
embarrassing
moments of self-analysis that can only come
at 9 a.m. in the morning when you have forgotten to brush your teeth and are not quite
sure why one table of students is glaring
angrily at you in Sharpies while your

It's getting a lot colder! As the leaves are turning brown, make sure

your
wardrobe goes
green. All of our consumer choices are small
political actions with ethical consequences, and each purchase can be a vote for sustainability instead of waiting for
legislators to figure out the policy. Use these green buying

before shopping for some more fall/winter clothing.
We'll focus here on sustainable materials, secondhand stores
and clothing maintenance to bring your daily attire in line
with your environmental concerns.
Let's talk about hemp clothing. While we have illegalized
hemp for "drug uses," the plant has been used to make clothing for over 5,000 years. Hemp actually produces 250 percent
more usable fiber than cotton and requires much fewer pesticides to cultivate. Hemp clothing is scarce and can be relatively expensive, but makes for a good commitment to environmentally conscious clothing. Legalizing hemp for clothing production would clearly decrease the environmental
impact of our current cotton dependent systems.
American Apparel, REI, Urban Outfitters and other yuppie stores have also begun to carry "sustainable editions" of
their clothing made of organic fibers (usually cotton) and
reduced dyes. Beyond this, American Apparel (on 16th and
Walnut in Center City and on 36th £nd Walnut in University
City) assembles most, if not all, of its clothing inL.A., which
means it's sweatshop free. Environmental consciousness is
social consciousness; humans are apart of the ecological system. Sweatshops with atrocious conditions are on the rise,
despite the work of many NGOs and human rights groups.
The environmentally conscious consumer should step back
from most sweatshop brands. Check out http://www.sweatshopwatch.org or http://www.ibuydifferent.org.
But who can really afford to shop at American Apparel
anyway since Financial Aid shrank your scholarship?
That's why we go to thrift stores! Secondhand clothes are a
great way to reduce waste in our society, fight materialist
consumerism and nab some great fashion finds. Our very
own Goodwill is quite prodigious and I also recommend the
Goodwill down on 2137 Macdade Avenue (it's much, much
cheaper). Those of us from vintage paradises like Austin or
Portland let out a disappointed sigh every time we get into
Philly, as this city definitely leaves something to be desired
in thrift. Nevertheless, there are some great stops for your
next Philly trip. Retrospect at 6th and South Streets is a
great place for good finds, and not too expensive considering
its location. On 4th and South Streets you will find Philly
Vintage, which, in my experience, is more overpriced.
There's a Buffalo Exchange on 17th and Chestnut with mixed
bargains and great finds. Get out there and grab those winter clothes before they fly into other hip hands!
But who really wants to buy a pair of used shoes? Luckily,
there are a variety of companies offering vegetarian
footwear (being vegetarian is not just what you eat!), such as
Zappos, Simple Shoes or Keen. Considering the leather and
rubber used in most shoes, this is a great treat for your clean
green feet. There's a lovely little store at 226 S 40th called the
Natural Shoe Store that carries many brands and styles
it's worth a look.
This is a good point to refer back to my last column vis-avis clothes maintenance
wash your clothes in cold water
with biodegradable soaps! It helps to reduce carbon emissions and decrease pollutants in our water. I still assure you
that your clothes will come out feeling better from a cold
water wash. Another great idea is mending all your clothing

ered face, meant to grace banquet halls and board
rooms of the rich but human. Some designers go a step
further with brand name collections marketed at several price points. Armani, for example, offers Armani
Exchange (A/X), a still-too-expensive-for-me-but-comparatively-"affordable" collection retailing out of boutiques at high end malls; Armani Jeans, a step up from
A/X, and featuring, unsurprisingly, their denim collection, is sold at upscale department stores; Emporio
Armani is a "youthful" step up from that, and then
there's Armani Collezioni, a basically equivalent professional line.

Giorgio Armani is the apex of the

house's ready-to-wear line, to be topped only by Armani
Prive, so couture it can only be made-to-order, and that
at a very high price. Other designers are reaching out
sort of
to the less wealthy and more suburban
markets by lending their name, if not quite their look,
to lower-end collections sold for a limited time at
Target.

of

America, the peasantry is uprising. New Yorker economist James Surowiecki wonders, though: is this "peasant" uprising actually bad for the royals?
As soon as a designer unveils his collection, photographs are on their way to Chinese factories; the resulting knockoffs are then sold in budget fashion havens
like H&M and Zara. Calling this a violation of intellectual property, Congress is now considering a bill that
gives original designs legal protection similar to copyright. Fair enough
maybe. (In 1941, the Supreme
Court overturned similar measures, calling them violations of anti-trust. But then, that was in those pre-H&M
halcyon days). Is it possible, though, that those knockoffs are actually good for business? Enter the "piracy
paradox," a phrase coined by law professors Kal
Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman, to argue that
"weak intellectual-property rules...have been integral
to [the fashion industries] success."
The Great Chain of Being Fashionable works something like this: maybe a total of 200 women buy couture
off the runway. Not only are runway collections prohibitively expensive, but they are also notoriously
unwearable, paired with theatrical, often otherworldly
hair and make-up to showcase concepts as much as (or
more than) clothes. The New York Times reported that
a 2007 Galliano men's collection was inspired by,
"'Tribal, William the Conqueror, bank robbers,' said
the makeup artist Pat McGrath, ticking off some of the
themes as she smudged red lipstick on the stocking-covered face of a model." All of this to say: what sashays
down the runway rarely sashays down the street.
Most of the super elite dress from those same designGucci, Armani and
ers' "ready to wear" collections
Yves St. Lauren
although they dress from the store
(or designer showroom), not the runway. These are
toned down versions of the clothes that strutted down
the catwalk; presumably they are intended to be worn
without the smudged red lipstick over the stocking-cov-

The cult of celebrity and the
obsession with authenticity...
seem to ensure a continued highend market.
Knockoffs coming out of the fashion houses themselves are far less threatening to the industry than are
the facsimiles coming out of H&M, Zara and stores that
specialize in transporting Milan to the mass market
without the oversight of the design houses themselves.
Yet these renegade designer copies allow styles to move
quickly from the elite to the masses, "fuel[ing] the
incessant demand for something new." »
On the one hand, this prevents designers from milking any single innovation for several collections; on the
other, it may not only induce greater productivity/creativity, but also boost sales. And, as Surowiecki points
out, the absence of copyrights and patents creates a
richer ground for innovation: "had the designers who
came up with the pinstripe or the stiletto heel been able
to bar others from using their creations, there would
have been less innovation in fashion, not more."
If knockoffs made a significant dent in designer profits, the situation would be different. However, the cult

of celebrity and the obsession with authenticity (see
Richard Dyer and Walter Benjamin, et al) as well as a
genuine lust for quality seem to ensure a continued
high-end market.
Legislation or no, binging on old seasons of MTV's
"The Hills" and "America's Next Top Model" assures
me that the Great Chain of Being Fashionable remains,
for the moment, intact.

'Mad Girl's Love Song' does Sylvia Plath
BY ALEX ISRAEL

aisraell@swarthmore.edu

"Mad Girl's Love Song," a solo performance piece
written and performed by theater major Rachel Sugar
'OB, will be shown Oct. 4-6 at 8 p.m. in the Frear
Ensemble Theater. The piece, directed by visiting
assistant theater professor Kym Moore, grapples with
issues like the boundary between art and life, as well
as female artistic identity in the lives of poet Sylvia
Plath, her husband Ted Hughes and Hughes' mistress,
Assia Wevill. The script was created from a combination of original writings by Plath, Hughes and Wevill,
as well as material from their various biographers.
Sugar and Moore began work on the piece in the
summer of 2007, but the idea had been brewing in
Sugar's head long before that. Sugar said that the
story, with its theme of the two women's tangled identities, was ideal for a solo performance piece; having
one actress portray both women helped show the melding ofPlath's and WeviU's identities over the course of
theirlives.

The solo nature of the show was, however, difficult
in many ways. Sugar described working alone as
"incredibly risky...there's no cast, no other actors to
bounce ideas off." Sugar described her stage crew and
director Moore as lifesavers in this respect, saying
that "working as part of a team, with the crew and
Kym, made the experience much easier and more fun."
Despite the fun Sugar had working on the show,
however, the piece ultimately has a serious message.
"It's about the work of an artist and the place of an
artist," Sugar said, adding that she "hopes to break
open the mythology surrounding Plath, Hughes and
Wevill and "make it less about depression and more
about the problems of being an artist and a woman."
she has trained at
Given Sugar's background
Interlochen Center for the Arts, the Moscow Art
Theater and Chicago's Second City as well as her passion for the material, this writer is sure that the piece
will succeed on both counts.

Discovery Weekend: a limited definition of diversity
This past weekend, the
college hosted 130 Swattie
hopefuls from across the
country at Discovery
Weekend. The event lasted three days and gave

prospective students a
chance to explore the

campus and discover
what it's like to be a

Swarthmore

LAUREN MENDOZA

student.

Although the weekend is
used to recruit applicants, a student cannot
simply show up and participate in Discovery

We Need to Talk

Weekend. To attend the
event, a student must
write two short original
essays and then be selected through a competitive application process. But to even
submit an application, the student must identify as a person
ofcolor. It's possible that such a great effort to racially diversify campus could be detrimental in fostering socioeconomic diversity at Swat.
Some students at Swarthmore view Discovery Weekend
as Swarthmore's attempt at affirmative action. However,
most of the college deans will tell you that participating in
Discovery Weekend doesn't necessarily guarantee a prospective student admission into Swarthmore. So when your
friends back home who are stuck going to a state school tell
you that you only got into such an amazing college because
of your race, you can tell them they're wrong ... and that's a
good thing. Everyone is here because they deserve it. But if
the color of your skin can't guarantee you a spot in Swat,
then what exactly is Discovery Weekend all about?
There are certain things about a college you can't experi-

ence just from looking at a brochure or website. Discovery
Weekend offers prospective students of color a chance to be
involved in a weekend packed full of events hosted by various campus organizations. It gives them a glance of what the
campus is really like, and exposes them to the different
intercultural support groups present at Swat. When I spoke
with several deans involved with Discovery Weekend,
including Assistant Dean and Director of Swarthmore's
Intercultural Center Rafael Zapata, they all agreed that the

best way to describe the campus event is as an opportunity
to reach out to students of color who might otherwise not
have the resources to access Swarthmore in their college
application process.

This is a great concept, and I admire all the wonderful
work the deans do to help make Swarthmore a diverse and
accepting campus, but at the same time I feel as if something
is missing. Of course it's a good idea to bring in students of
color and create a more diverse campus community, but
what about students who come from low-income households,
and first-generation college students who happen to be
white? Enhancing the diversity of our campus can't just be

about color. If Swarthmore is going to reach out to students
who wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity, then we
should extend an invitation to all those students regardless
of their race.
I came to Discovery Weekend two years ago. I had never
even heard about Swarthmore until I got an invitation to
apply to Discovery Weekend and visit the campus, all paid
for by Swat. At the time, I was only applying to local schools
in Austin, Texas, as well as a few large universities on the
West Coast. I hadn't even considered going to a small liberal
arts college. But how could I resist a free trip to a part of the
country I had never been before? My family was so excited,
even though they warned me of how different, and white, the
East Coast was. But I figured I had seen enough episodes of
Gilmore Girls to know what was up, so I applied, was accepted and a few weeks later found myself venturing up McGill
walk for the first time. When I arrived at Swarthmore, it was
more than I ever hoped it could be. The gorgeous campus,
friendly liberal atmosphere and several student-of-color
campus groups that welcomed me all helped me decide that
this was the right place for me.
If my last name were not Mendoza I would not have been
given the opportunity to visit Swat during Discovery
Weekend as a Hispanic, and I undoubtedly never wouldhave
even thought about applying to the college. Consequently, I
would have missed out on one of the greatest things that has
ever happened to me.
When I think about how lucky I am, I also can't help but

think ofall the students who miss out on such a great opportunity because they are not a minority students who have
worked hard in high school but don't have the funds to go on
a nationwide campus tour to find their dream college, or students whose parents' only degree is a GED and can't help
advise theirkids on which school offers the best undergrad-

uate experience. Regardless of race, these are students who
also need to be given a chance to discover what amazing
opportunities await them at Swarthmore.
Swat is a unique college that is genuinely concerned with
creating a diverse campus community. The administration
supports students of color by creating a welcoming environment sensitive to a student's need to interact with others
who have similar racial identities. During Discovery

Weekend, the college offers prospective students a chance to
see the kind of intercultural support offered here, including
such groups as ENLACE, SOA, SASS, SOCA, DESHI, Ruach
and Multi. Finding thiskind of support can be a determining
factor for some as they are deciding between colleges. I
would on no account suggest that such support for diversity
is not essential while recruiting students. However, I believe
the college should take the passion it has for promoting
racial diversity and apply it to class diversity as well.
Swarthmore should undoubtedly continue its efforts to
reach out to underprivileged students of color. But underprivileged white kids also exist, and they are often ignored
in the college recruitment process. In establishing a diverse
environment, one of the biggest goals is to include individuals that offer different values, beliefs and experiences to a
group. How can a place call itself diverse if it is almost
entirely comprised of the middle to upper middle class? A

lack of diversity creates a lack of knowledge about those left
out. Not only does this contribute to ignorance of what the
real world is like, but it also gives an unfair advantage to
those who aren't ignored because of their race. College is a
place where students realize their potential to make a difference in society. But if an intelligent person of the lower class
is ignored because he or she doesn't offer more diversity to
a school's demographics, isn't that an equal injustice?
College is also the place where students are given the qualifications to obtain profitable careers. If colleges lack socioeconomic diversity, the rich will always be the ones who get
to the best education, and everyone else will just get shafted.
Discovery Weekend is an incredibly powerful recruiting
tool for the college, so I hope one day it will include all students in need of support during the application process.

Which bubble you check off in the ethnicity box should be
irrelevant. If Discovery Weekend is meant to level the playing field, but ends up leaving some of the most needy
prospective students behind, what's the point?

For widespread change, U.S. needs to look for deeper stake in the U.N.
Last
week the
Burmese
army
attacked
peaceful
demonstrators in several cities.

RASA PETRAUSKAITE
The Bright Future

Thousands
of
them
were
monks. As
a result, at
least ten
people
died, but
the precise

death toll remains unknown. It is unfortu-

nate that the demonstrators in countries

like Burma have no protection from their
countries' military. The U.S., as our representative in the global forum, should take
steps towards empowering the U.N. so that
it can protect the rights of peaceful civilians worldwide.
Many Americans feel that peaceful
demonstrators such as those in Burma
should be protected from attacks by the
military. Most would probably agree that
the demands of the protesters are justified.
The protesters' main demand was greater
economic and political freedom, such as

THE PHOENIX

they would have with a democratically
elected government. This is not surprising,
since the Burmese government routinely
uses its army to crush protests and places
opposition leaders under house arrest. It
controls the economy in a semi-communist
system. In June 2006, Burmese authorities

attempted to block the use of Google's
search engine and email service so that the
state could maintain monopoly power over

telecommunications.
Even if most Americans did not support
the reasons for the Burmese protests, they
would still probably agree that all people
should have the right to demonstrate
peacefully no matter what country they
live in. This belief is in line with the
American vision of a free world.
The U.S. alone cannot credibly threaten
the perpetrators of human rights abuses.
Our country's military is already overstretched with the wars in the Middle East,
and it cannot afford to invade Burma,
Sudan and other countries with rampant
human rights abuses all at the same time.
This fact allows the perpetrators to continue doing what they do without paying
much attention to the U.S. The U.S. should
shift some of the burden of freeing the rest
of the world to other democracies through
international institutions.
The United Nations should protect
peaceful protesters worldwide, especially if

causes deemed just by democratic societies. The American Institute
they protest

for Peace explains the gist of the argument well:
Collective international
efforts are necessary to deal with terrorism, nuclear proliferation, human rights
"

abuses, international conflict and geno-

cide, natural disasters and the spread of
infectious diseases and economic deprivation and poverty. The United Nations, as
well as regional organizations, can be
important vehicles for dealing with these
challenges."
Unfortunately the United Nations, in
its current state, can hardly accomplish
tasks such as promotion of human rights.
Last January, China and Russia vetoed a
draft U.S. resolution at the UN Security
Council urging Burma to stop persecuting
minority and opposition groups. Thus, the
U.N. cannot pose a credible threat to certain human rights abusers because lessthan-democratically minded countries
have a large stake in the organization.
There are other structural roadblocks
in place as well that prevent the U.N. from
promoting human rights. For instance,
one would think that the U.S. could donate
more money to it for peacekeeping operations. Alas, a U.N. rule prohibits this. The
U.N. website literally says, "Current law
prohibits the United States from fulfilling
its financial obligations to U.N. peace-

October 4, 2007

keeping by preventing the U.S. from paying more than 25 percent of the organization's peacekeeping budget." Bizarre.
A better organizational system would
weigh the votes in each commission based
on the amount of money that a country
contributes to it. Furthermore, under the

ideal system, there would be no limit on
donations to any part of the U.N., which
would help countries buy voting power.
This would be great for America. In 2006,
U.S. donations accounted for 22% of the
total U.N. budget for human rights missions. Also, well over half of the U.N.
budget annually comes from democracies.

If the above-described reforms were
implemented, democracies would be able
to control U.N. commissions to a greater
extent.
Achieving changes in the U.N. is "an
uphill battle," says John Bolton, former
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. In the last
decade, when the U.S. sought to introduce
changes to the U.N., it withheld its dues
from the organization until it adopted at

least some reforms. The U.S. could continue using this strategy or try more diplomatic means towards enacting change.
Either way, with a democratically controlled U.N., civilians worldwide would
have more protection from violence.

Freeing Speech
"Taser this... F**k Bush." On Sept. 2L the Editor in
Chief of the Colorado State University Rocky
Mountain Collegian used those precise words in an

editorial speaking out against the tasering of a student at a recent John Kerry speech. In a Completely
separate event three days later, President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad of Iran delivered a speech at Columbia
University that, amongst other things, claimed that
the Holocaust needed further research and denied the
existence of homosexuals in his country. Though
seemingly unrelated, the backlash from both these
events sparked national debate about the meaning of
free speech and the implications of limiting that
right. From what ensued in the proceeding aftermath,
it appears that the root of the problem lies in a collective forgetfulness that the opinions of others, no matter how controversial, must still be respected.
While it's not to say that we support what David
McSwane, of The Rocky Mountain Collegian, or
President Ahmadinejad, said, but we want to shed
light on the fact that both men had every right to
voice their respective opinions. For McSwane especially, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
states that "Congress shall make no law
abridging
the freedom
of the press." The fact that his peers
and school administration are pressuring him to
resign from his position and threatening to oust him
from his seat is both unfortunate and wrong.
McSwane may not have picked the right battle or
made the best judgment call with his editorial, but he
did not do more than exercise his right to free speech.
It is interesting to note that a full-page ad, sponsored by FreedomsWatch.org, was placed in the New
York Times protesting Ahmadinejad's appearance at
Columbia. Just as the organization had every right to
voice their opinion about the event, so did
Ahmadinejad have the right to appear in it and deliver the speech he gave. Protests to ban controversial
speakers from speaking on campuses not only undermine our first amendment rights, but also speak poorly of how college students are viewed. Columbia
University President Lee Bollinger made the right
choice by allowing Ahmadinejad onto his campus
with the faith that his students would be able to
engage in healthy discourse about the event. Viewing
the speech as a learning experience or an insight into
foreign mindsets is both necessary and crucial.
Swarthmore students tend to pride themselves on
their willingness to express their thoughts and The
Phoenix is lucky to be an independently-run student
newspaper at a school with a very open-minded
administration. Our hope is that the students here
can continue to feel safe to speak their minds
no

eyes scan front pages for the words "college" and "university", if newspapers are more likely to report on a
Durham, NC than a Jena, LA, or if it's actually representative of something, but it feels like the majority of these
incidences are taking place on college campuses.
At the University of Maryland and the US Coast Guard
Academy, nooses have been found outside the AfricanAmerican cultural centers and placed amongst the personal effects of a black cadet, examples that pay further
testament to the lasting power of an odious symbol.
Similarly, though also very differently, the student paper
at the University of Virginia printed cartoons depicting
starving Ethiopians and a slave and "politically incorrect" parties at Macalester, UT-Austin, Johns Hopkins
University and Clemson University, among others, have
had students dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan, in
blackface and wearing a noose, among other costumes.

JOSH COHEN

The notion that "education" is the
cure-all for deeply embedded racism
in society would be naive if it
weren't coming from professors and
administrators
The first two examples are inarguably hateful while
the cartoons and costumes are ambiguous enough to
make prime fodder for the sort of conversations academia
loves to have about freedom of speech, ethics and the
state of society. And yet, the responses to these incidences
by authorities affiliated with the various institutions
have implicitly lumped them together, offering indistinguishable official condemnations of "intolerance" and
"insensitivity" and calls for an increase in "racial sensitivity training." The argument is that things like nooses
end up outside African-American cultural centers
because "young people" don't know any better.
The notion that "education" is the cure-all for deeply
embedded racism in society would be naive if it weren't
coming from professors and administrators
in which
case, it's irresponsible. Consider the following explanation and implicit justification given by a professor
of law at the University of Maryland for the incident at
her college: "Young people can sense it's a powerful sym-

bol
I think they know it's racially charged, but they
don't know its full history
how many lynchings there
were, how many were there watching sometimes whole
towns, including here in Maryland."
Similarly, the vice president and chief officer at the
University of Virginia said that "some students arrive
with prejudices and stereotypes they don't even know
they have," and the president of Spelman College
explained that college is the first time many students
experience so many different types of people and that
"many people don't make that transition well."
Self-congratulation looms large when you play the
Swarthmore card, but it really is relevant to note here

that Swarthmore is the exception when it comes to
things like this. Most of us arrive at our diversity workshops almost excessively aware and eager to talk. I've
been to an orientation diversity workshop at a large
Midwestern university, though, and if I think about that
in which we went around the group and
experience
named an instance in which we interacted with "someone of another color"
it's clear to me that the responses by administrators and professors to racism on their
campuses are a serious failure, if not contributory to the
problem itself. The truth is that treating students like
ignorant children ends up giving them license to act
accordingly.

Diversity workshops should be
discussions that ask the questions
society at large isn't asking, not
condescendingly scripted lessons in
the fundamentals of humanity.
To put it another way: Why should "sensitivity trainentail sensitivity for the racists? While it's true that

ing"

lots of students come to college from comparatively
homogenous communities and interact with people of
other colors, shapes and sizes, for the first time in their
first weeks at college, it is insulting to suggest that
racism is a growing pain. You "make the transition" into
drinking, dorm life, staying home alone; you don't need
to take a semester of classes with students of different
races to "transition" your way into humanity, not unless
you were actually raised by wolves (or their parental
equivalent).
Beyond tolerance, active respect should be a prerequisite for membership in a college community, which
purports to be peddling enlightenment, since active
respect is the ideal for a society at large that is still working on tolerance. Instead, though, colleges are justifying
the racism occurring on their campuses by telling students that they are victims of their own ignorance, that
they learn tolerance like a subject in school rather than
practice it, and that morality is, in more ways than one,
skin-deep.
Several students who participated in the "politically
incorrect" parties said that the parties were in response
to the absurdity of the "sensitivity training" on their
campuses. Others said it was in response to the injustice
of affirmative action. None of this makes dressing up like
a Klan member justifiable, let alone funny, but it does
point to the fact that these students are smarter than
that is, they are
their colleges give them credit for
responding to farce of their colleges' attitude towards
racial issues with farce of their own. If there is a message
to be drawn from a "politically incorrect" party, it is the
students exploiting the fact that their university is more
interested in self-promotional talk of tolerance than in
the actual everyday experiences of its students in which
racism and racists, regardless of "diversity", remain the

norm.

Diversity workshops should be discussions that ask
the questions society at large isn't asking, not condescendingly scripted lessons in the fundamentals of
humanity. At my first diversity workshop at the large
Midwestern University, we made a list of examples of
racism, and then we signed a pledge to be tolerant, which
most students threw out afterwards. Really progressive
education is demanding: a college should assume racial
enlightenment of its students, and be accordingly
unequivocal, even err on the side of moral superiority, in
its reaction to students who fail to meet our 21st century
standards for morality. "Insensitivity" is laughing during Beaches; a racist joke is racist. If you leave a noose
outside an African-American cultural center, or if you
dress up like one for a party, your institution should hold
you accountable
but it can't, and shouldn't, aim to
change you. It's your job to educate yourself.

The silent genocide: insights on Zimbabwe
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

I wish that the conflict in Zimbabwe
would be given the
advantage of being
labeled
"The
Zimbabwean
Genocide." Perhaps
then this country
would meet the criteria
for sustained international outcry and a cavalry of righteous student groups armed
with colored armbands
(or, at the very least,
ribbons). Maybe then
CHENGE MAHOMVA
the struggle for life that
ordinary Zimbabwean
Wawona
experiences would be
noted and addressed.
Talking to some students here, I get the impression that some feel genocide is
synonymous with blood-drenched violence and the presence
of two distinct groups of "good people" and "bad people." To
understand the situation in Zimbabwe, though, one has to
step away from that notion. I want to make it clear here
though, that I am not challenging the atrocities of or trying
to take anything away from, other genocides thathave been
marked by extreme violence.
Zimbabwe has its own silent unconventional genocide.
Firstly, there are no machetes or AK47s being used to inflict
extreme violence. The weapon ofchoice is starvation. It's as
though the hunger pains of the Zimbabwean citizenry are
used against it to maintain submissive behavior towards the

dictatorship.
Though starvation seems like an unlikely tool, it is
painfully effective. It preoccupies the Zimbabwean mind
with a single basic thought: "Where will I get my next
meal?" The urgency and potency of this survivalist thought
leaves little room for any ideas of revolution or the over-

throwing the current dictatorship.

How so?
Shopping for basic food in Zimbabwe has become a physically and mentally draining black market affair in which
the wheelers and dealers are everyone from grandmothers
to children. In 2005, legislation was passed that made vend-

ing (selling produce on the roadsides to other civilians) illegal. If you have any concept of Africa, you will know that

op-art

by

sam

vending in marketplaces and along roadsides is like an outdoor version of Macy's. Only this time, the goods range from
sizzling roasted maize to Muthis (medicine) made from a
variety of smelly earthy items. You would also understand
that it is these breezy shopping malls that used to financially support a large percentage ofZimbabweans. But, in more
recent times, the high unemployment rate has created a new
generation of desperately entrepreneurial citizens, creatively adapting to the every changing law.

nation. The fuel crisis in Zimbabwe is so bad that there is no
longer enough fuel to maintain a dedicated bus service.

Buses in Zimbabwe are rare and riding one within the city
is a luxury that only the lucky experience.
3. Upon arriving at the supermarket you would walk up
it's
an aisle and notice one strikingly common feature
empty. In a bid to reduce hyperinflation, legislature was
passed in 2007 that forced all merchants to sell certain goods
at less than 50 percent of their value.
Which merchants want to sell goods at an automatic loss?
-

None.

I get the impression that some feel
genocide is synonymous with
blood-drenched violence and the
presence of two distinct groups of
"good people" and "bad people."
The illegal method of shopping goes as follows:
L As a customer you would remove your cap from your
head and turn it over your head as if you were fanning the
top. This is a signal that you are looking to buy goods different vendors require different signals from their cus-

tomers.
2. Once you and your vendor have made contact you
would hand over a handkerchief filledwith a crisp Z5200,000

bill. At least the Zimbabwean government understands that
hyperinflation can result in people carrying brief cases of
money or bulky pockets. This year they introduced a new
Zs2oo, 000 bill.
3. The vendor will inconspicuously sneeze, accept the
handkerchief and temporarily disappear.
4. Later the vendor will return and place at your feet a
bulky newspaper bundle filled with the illicit goods five
tomatoes.
There is a more legal way to shop, of course, but it has its
own dilemmas and is equally draining.
That process would entail:
1 Waking up you and your child up at a ludicrously early
time in order to start your long walk to a grocery store.
2. On the trek, in loving, motherly coos and ahhs, you
would fill your child's head with bewildering stories of
mythical beings. Your child's favorite story would be of the
long rectangular vehicle that would pick people up at one
destination and drop them off very close to their next desti-

Which merchants are still producing goods? Very few.
So what is available to buy in the majority of supermar-

kets? Close to nothing.
Hyperinflation adds to the insane nature of existence in
Zimbabwe, and it is not uncommon that prices could change
twice in one day. I've woken up and bought bread for Z54300
in the morning and then Zssooo in the evening. One new sick
twist to this lunacy is that you can now have the money to
buy goods but there are simply no goods to buy.
This concept of starvation being used as a tool may seem
new to you, but it is a weapon that has been used before in
other African countries. It's as though every morning the
question a Zimbabwean asks is, "Do I spend my time trying
to find food or trying to start a revolution?" Very few choose
the latter.
The second perplexing feature to the Zimbabwean situation comes into play when we ask who are the "good people" and the "bad people?" It's difficult to answer because the
Zimbabwean population isn't divided by jarring racial, cultural or religious lines. The majority of Zimbabweans suffer
communally under the leadership of the Zimbabwe African
National Union Patriotic Front. Perhaps the best way to
describe this is to consider Zimbabwe to be a battle between
the "haves," the leaders in government and their allies, and
the "have nots," the rest of the citizenry. While the majority
of citizens struggle to shop daily, it's not uncommon for the
ministers to shop in South Africa, the neighboring blossoming country. It's that classic African double standard where
the leaders make the bedand force the citizens to sleep in it.
I have purposefully given a general idea of the current situation, in the hope that you will join me for the rest of the
semester in discovering more about my country. If genocide
is correctly defined as the deliberate mass killing of a specific group do you think Zimbabwe meets the criteria? I
know where I stand.

Extra hours mean more electricity
In the recent debate over extending McCabe's
hours of operation, we as members of Earthlust
have noticed a critical element missing. During
evening operation, McCabe consumes ~167 kWh
of electricity (on a fall weeknight), which
amounts to ~110 lbs of Carbon (given that only
60% of Swarthmore's electricity comes from fossil fuels). Let's consider the value of extra study
time relative to this resource consumption. Just
as it is wasteful to leave an entire lecture hall
(Science Center 101) fully illuminated for the
studying convenience of a few students, it is not
conscientious to leave the entire library run-

a handful of students.
Therefore, the responsible decision will be
the one that considers these environmental
costs and avoids waste. If the number of students who desire to study in McCabe during the
extended hours could all fit comfortably onto a
single floor, then let's only keep a single floor lit.
Recent articles in the New York Times remind
us that the effects of resource waste have significant and growing impacts. Now is the time for
our attitudes and actions to reflect the realities.

Swarthmore men fight for a playoff spot
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu
Do-or-die time has arrived for the Garnet men's soccer
team. The squad, which went into the season with a goal
of making it to the conference playoffs and ultimately to
the NCAA tournament, is hovering in a precarious position in the conference, but is confident about what the
future will bring.
While its most recent results, a 2-0 win over
Washington College on Sept. 26 and a 1-0 loss to
Gettysburg College on Sept. 29, might not have produced
the most desired end on paper, the squad was happy with
its level of play and tenacity.
Against the Shoremen, the Garnet scored two goals
with in the first 30 minutes on a long shot from Michael
Bonesteel 'OB and a penalty kick from Yoi Tibbetts 'O9.
The Swarthmore defense made things easy for goalie
Ryan Sutcliffe 'OB, who didn't have to make a single save
in the first half. The Garnet kept the pressure on
Washington in the second half, outshooting the
Shoremen 11-3, but was not able to convert another goal.
"I'm not sure that everybody was completely satisfied," Sutcliffe said of the result against Washington. "We
would have liked to be a little bit more authoritative, but
we got the win."
Against the Bullets, 468 fans showed up at Clothier
Field to watch a hard-fought match that ultimately went
against the Garnet. Both teams exchanged scoring
chances, with defender Brendan Grady 'OB making an
especially big save on a ball that was heading across the
goal line, but the Bullets hit the one shot that found the
back of the net two minutes into the second half. Still,
Swarthmore continued fighting tooth-and-nail until the

final whistle.

Evan Nesterak makes a play in Saturday's game.

"We've clearly developed since Hopkins," Sutcliffe said,
referring to Swarthmore's 4-0 loss to the Blue Jays, in
which the Garnet "deflated" after giving up a goal. "We didn't back down at all. [ln] the last 15 minutes of the game,
Gettysburg was scared as hell."
The game was "very competitive, very physical,"
Coach Eric Wagner said. "Unfortunately, we made a mis-

take that ultimately cost us. Gettysburg took advantage
of it props to them."
The physicality of the game proved costly for
Swarthmore, as two of its three captains, JeffKushner 'O9
and Patrick Christmas 'OB were forced out of the game
with injuries and will also have to sit out in this weekend's match. Kushner suffered a sprained ankle and
Christmas was knocked out and suffered a concussion.
While another team might be ruined by the loss of two of
its stars, Wagner said the team's depth means this will
not be the case.

"We didn't back down at all. [ln] the
last 15 minutes of the game,
Gettysburg was scared as hell."
Ryan Sutcliffe 'OB
"We can go to other players without having a major
drop in talent level," he said. "Obviously it's different to
lose a player the caliber of Patrick and Kushner
I'm
not at all worried about being able to fill the positions,
the question is whether the leadership void is filled. I'm
sure that Grady will step up."
With the Swarthmore men holding on to a 1-2-1 record
in the Centennial Conference, each game from now until
the end of the season will be important, starting on
Saturday at Ursinus College. "A win will get us right
back on track in terms of getting right back into the conference standings," Kushner said. And apparently, the
team is mentally ready for the pressure that comes with
...

this time of the season.
After the Gettysburg loss, "We took two days off from
practice and [Tuesday] we kind of regrouped," he said.
"We're not trying to dwell on anything that happened in
the past. Our ultimate goal is still to make the playoffs
and win the conference."
Sutcliffe agreed. "It's just a matter of putting in the
work and having faith in our abilities," he said.

Women's soccer continues to dominate, climb rankings

The game could have been called after
three minutes. Three minutes was all
Swarthmore needed Saturday when the
undefeated women's soccer team (7-0, 3-0
CC) took down the McDaniel College Green
Terror (1-8,1-2 CC) in Westminster, Md. 1-0,
with Danielle Tocchet 'OB scoring the lone
goal of the game for either team under two
and a half minutes in.
In defeating McDaniel, Swarthmore
improved its national ranking to number

18 overall, according to the National
Soccer Coaches of America web site

(www.nscaa.com).
The Garnet's ranking has risen steadily
over the last three weeks in the weeklyissued poll. The Garnet went from being
unranked to number 23 in the nation two
weeks ago, then to number 19 overall last
week. The women have only played one
game since then, but .nevertheless have
succeeded in moving up yet another spot in
the Adidas-sponsored poll.
It was not so much its defeat of a team
with a 111 winning percentage by a one-

Volleyball to host Johns Hopkins for a good cause
After a breakthrough tournament the previous weekend at Elizabethtown College,
the Garnet volleyball team continued its impressive play in two conference games last
week. Swarthmore handily defeated Washington College, 30-27, 30-22, 30-22 last
Wednesday at home and thenlost a disappointing, but well-played, match at McDaniel
on Saturday, 27-30, 30-32, 30-19, 25-30, to bring its conference record to 1-2. Despite the
loss to the Green Terror, Coach Harleigh Leach was happy with the team's intensity.
' "We are definitely showing that we're a different team right now," she said.
"We're playing with great efficiency. We ran into some uncontrollable factors on
Saturday
it just didn't go our way."
Katherine Gold 'OB (12), Johanna Bond 10 (11) and Jen Wang 'O9 (10) all put in
double-digit kill performances against the Shorewomen, while Erin Heaney 'O9 contributed a team-high 23 digs. On Saturday, Wang stepped up again with 25 kills and
only two errors, with Vanessa Wells 'OB adding another 15 kills and Heaney recording 32 digs. Setter Kearney Bangs 'lO had 47 assists in the match against
Washington and 61 against McDaniel.
The Garnet will travel to Bryn Mawr College tonight before hosting Johns
Hopkins University on Oct. 6 at 1 p.m. The Hopkins game will be part of Digging for
the Cure, a conference-wide event to raise money in the fight against breast cancer.
The women are collecting pledges per dig from fans to contribute to the cause, and
are excited about drawing a big crowd to the game against a worthy opponent.

goal margin that earned the Garnet a better
ranking this week than last week, but the
way in which it earned the victory. In
Swarthmore's win over McDaniel, the
women showed an ability to dominate the

flow of the game that has been characteristic of many of their wins this season.
In the game, Swarthmore out-shot
McDaniel 23-2. On the season, the team has
out-shot opponents 152-33. McDaniel goalie
Leanne Hollinger managed to keep the
Garnet damage to one goal, as she saved 13
shots on goal in the process. Garnet goalkeeper Lauren Walker 'O9, meanwhile, only
had to make two saves, keeping with her
average of 2.28 saves per game.
Besides Tocchet, other Garnet contributors who put the pressure on the Green
Terror on Saturday included Katie Kanuka
10, who played all 90 minutes and got off
five shots on goal in her second game back
from an injury that had her sidelined for
the first five matches of the year, and
Caitlin O'Neil 'lO, who came off the bench
and was responsible for two shots on goal.
And although the dominance exhibited
on Saturday has been characteristic of
Swarthmore's play this year, according to
O'Neil the team is only getting better.
"We're working out the kinks," she said.
"We're learning how to keep up the intensity level, and how to start the game off strong
and play our style from the beginning."
One of those kinks, said O'Neal, is the
ability to finish plays.
"We're good at getting opportunities in
front of the goal, but we've had trouble finishing."

Swarthmore's 7-0 start to this season
has been a result of the hard work put in by

October 4, 2007

players over the last two seasons, according to Coach Todd Anckaitis.
"Since I came in as coach, we've been
able to put some core things in place, and
the team has taken positives from previous

seasons and made them the'fabrics of the

team."

Anckaitis was particularly proud of how
players this year have built on mistakes.

"It's great because we even have first-years
who have utilized past high school or club
situations," he said.
The Garnet faced Johns Hopkins
University at home last night in a game too
late for publication. The game has been
much anticipated by Garnet players, as the
Blue Jays are likely to be its biggest challenge in the regular season. The Jays, who
are 2-1 in conference play after suffering a
defeat last week at the hands of Haverford
College, are the defending Centennial
Conference Champions, having beaten
Swarthmore in the conference championships last year.
"We're approaching the game with confidence," Walker said yesterday, a few
hours prior to the match. "We just want to
stay focused, and play the way we know we
can."
For the Garnet the rest of the way, every
victory could mean a higher ranking, and a
chance to take Swarthmore soccer where it
has not been before.
The Garnet will look to continue its
streak with conference matches this
Saturday at Bryn Mawr College, and next
Wednesday at Muhlenberg College, before
finally returning home for a match the
following Wednesday

against

Ursinus

College at 5 p.m.

X-C gets Regionals preview
BY MELISSA CRUZ

mcruzl@swarthmore.edu

This past Friday afternoon, Swarthmore's varsity
cross country teams raced at the annual Paul Short
Invitational held at Lehigh University. Every year,
teams from far and near, of all divisions and regions,
meet at the Lehigh University campus to race and to
see how they measure up against other teams, other
runners, fellow teammates and the infamous clock.
Both the men's and women's teams competed in
separate junior varsity races against many challenging competitors, including Princeton University,
Villanova University, Johns Hopkins University and
Syracuse University. Because the races took place

while classes were still in session, several top runners had to miss their races. "Had the women run
the white race (which we ran last year), we would've
placed third out of the 33 complete teams that raced,"
Coach Pete Carroll said.
Although they couldn't score competitively
against other teams, the Garnet women did theirfair
share of conquering individually. The ladies were led
by Ashley Davies 'lO, who smoked the 6k race in 23
minutes and 39 seconds and placed 60th out of 407
female runners. Davies ran the race with a remarkable pace of 6:21 per mile. She was also accompanied
by several of her teammates at sub-6:30 pace. As a
reflection of the team's depth, "we had six of our runners within 20 seconds of each other," Kathy Feeney
'O9 said. Finishing a mere four seconds behind
Davies and placing 67th was Emma Stanley 'O9, with
a time of 23:43. Bess Ritter 'O9, who crossed the finish
line at 24:08, was the leader of a pack of several
Garnet ladies who completed the race within the 24minute mark. Following right on her heels were
Caitlin Russel 'll (24:10), Feeney (24:13), Lauren
DeLuca 'lO (24:17), Nyika Corbett 'lO (24:22), Faith

Pampel 'O9 (24:28), Ada Okum 'll (24:34), Rebecca Woo
'll (24:47) and Chelsea Brett 'll (24:55).
"The strength of our women's team is that we're all
together," Carroll said. "Now we want to move up by
20 seconds over the course of the next six weeks." With
the team already running in the tight pack that was
seen Friday, this goal is certainly not unattainable.
The men's team raced the 8k course following
Erik Saka 'O9. Saka flew through the course with a
pace of 5:26 and an overall time of 27 minutes flat,
landing him with a 77th place finish out of 443 male
finishers. Close on his tail and placing 110th an 112th
were Jon Shoop 'OB and Jonnie "Jonnycakes"
Tompkins 'lO, who raced at 27:22 and 27:23, respectively. More top Garnet male finishers were Patrick
Harnett 'll (27:54), Alex Frye 11 (28:28), Andrew
Vanßuren 'lO (29:13), and David' Riccardi 'lO (30:23).

"The guys are where they want to be," Saka said.
"Running at Lehigh gave all of us, especially the
first-years, a good feel for what Regionals will be
like." Toward the end of the fall 'O7 season, the
regionals race will also be held at Lehigh.
With regards to training in between weekend
invitationals and the occasional weekday meet,
Carroll commented on a new speed approach he is
testing. "Right now we are doing a lot less speedspecificity running than we did last year," he said.
When the team did lots of sprint workouts last year,
Carroll noted that "the runners would get faster,
very quickly and early in the season, but then they
would plateau around the final, more important
races of the season." This year, they're saving the
speed for a bit later in the season.
"Our number one mission was to get on the
course and get a dry run to get a feel for the course,"
Carroll said.
The Garnet will race again this Saturday at the
Dickinson Invitational in Carlisle, Pa.

Physics and Engineering majors battle valiantly on the kickball field
Physicists may lose snowball
fights, but apparently they win

kickball games. Swarthmore's
physics majors defeated their
engineering counterparts in a
decisive matchup on Saturday,
sending them back to Hicks
with a 15-7 thumping. The physicists scored six runs in the first
inning and never looked back,
with the engineers' only threat
coming on five runs in the
fourth inning to bring them
within 9-5 before the physicists
closed the door on their B.S.
opponents.

According to physicist Mike
Rosenberg 'OB, his team was led

THE PHOENIX

to victory behind the arm of Al

Zelaski 'O9 and the feet of Tom
Emmons 'OB. "Al pitched a great
game," he said. With her scoreless first two innings, combined
with the physicists' early offensive outburst, "we basically
cruised to the win." For the
offense, "Tom had a really good
day at the plate... [and was] really aggressive on the basepath."
According to Rosenberg, the
team's success can be attributed
to the small size of its home
department. "We spend a lot of
time with each other and have
good team chemistry as a result,"
he said.

The engineers did not take the
loss too hard. "We all had a really good time outside of Hicks
together," Molly Piels 'OB said. "It
was nice to be totally one hundred percent completely on
everybody else's team."
While neither team has plans
set in stone for future competitions, there is hope that a rivalry is brewing between the two
departments and that more
events will follow in the future.

For now, the physicists have
openly extended a challenge to
anyone else willing to test their
supremacy on the diamond.

fully going towards superstar

infielders Jimmy Rollins, Chase
Utley and Ryan Howard. Let's
take a moment, though, to recognize some other people and
events that contributed to the division championship.
April 18 (3-10, 6 GB): With staff ace Brett Myers struggling and
(

the team floundering, manager Charlie Manual sends Myers to the
bullpen to set up Flash Gordon. It's common knowledge that a good
starting pitcher is more valuable than even a dominant setup man,
so this is blasted as a "panic move" by a manager who needs to be
shown the door. Whatever its motivations, the move turned out
just fine. Myers was ready to take over the closer role when Flash
went on the DL on May 4, and the Phils get decent pitching firs
from Jon Lieber, and then from immortals JD Durbin and Kyi
Lohse, in his vacated rotation slot.
May 24 (23-24, 6.5 GB): New closer Myers goes on the DL. He l
replaced by Antonio "El Pulpo" Alfonseca, who has had one effe
tive season since 200 L Somehow Alfonseca puts up a solid 3.6
ERA for the next two months until Myers returns, converting 8 o
11 save opportunities.
June 13 (35-31,2 GB): Kyle Kendrick goes six solid innings in hi
first major league start; the Phillies go on to win. Who? Kendric
is a desperation call-up from AA, where he was pitching fairl
well, but was unlikely to see the majors until at least 2009.
That changes when Freddy Garcia another highly-paid mem
ber of the supposedly well-stocked starting staff— goes out for th
year with an injured shoulder. Kendrick doesn't miss many bat
in the majors, getting rocked for 16 home runs while striking out
just 49 batters in 120 innings, but somehow pulls together a 10-4
record and 3.87 ERA. After staff ace Cole Hamels goes on the DL in
winning three
mid-August, Kendrick becomes the team's
straight starts.
June 22 (35-33,2 GB) Left-handed reliever J.C. Romero is signe(
after being released outright by Boston. Romero, who had pitchec
poorly in Boston after a disastrous 2006, posts a 124 ERA in
Philadelphia and appears in approximately 87,000 games durin
September.
July 15 (46-45, 5 GB): The Phillies lose the 10,000th game in fran
chise history. This would be funny if the team was playing well
'

but it isn't.

July 26 (52-49, 5 GB): Chase Utley breaks his hand. "Utley i
huge," says Manuel. Things look bad.
July 27 (53-49, 4 GB): Tadahito Iguchi is brought in from the
White Sox to fill the hole at second base. He's hitting just

.251/.340/.382.

August 7 (59-53, 4 GB ): Wikipedia: "[On August 7th,] Tadahito
Iguchi was welcomed into the hearts ofPhillies fans with his own
fan group 'Tadahito's Burritos.'" Incredibly, Iguchi hits .388 in his
first 12 games with his new team. Overall, he puts up

.304/.362/.442 line with the Phils.
September: The Washington Nationals go 5-1 vs. New York an
2-5 vs. Philadelphia. Manuel puts Washington manager Mann
Acta on his Christmas card list for life.
September 13 (77-69, 7 GB): After winning three in a row, th
Phillies drop two straight to the Rockies by a combined margin o
20-2 and look to be dead in the water.
September 18 (82-69, L 5 GB): One day after nearly blowing an 11
0 lead by giving up 8 runs in three innings, the Phillies bullpe
allows just 1 run in 10 innings of work in a 7-4,14-inning win in S
Louis.
September 22 (85-70,

L 5 GB): Romero (9), Gordon (8) and Myer
(8) have combined for a 0.78 ERA over 25 (!!) appearances in th
team's last 10 games (9 wins). All three pitch in five consecutiv
games from Sept. 18 to Sept. 22. I can't remember the last time an
pitcher threw in five straight games, let alone three from the sam
team. Unbelievable.
It's been great, Fighting Phils. Thanks for everything.

Swat rugby squads step up to weekend competition
BY ZHENG ZHENG

,

zzhengl@swarthmore.edu

Though experiencing a number oflosses over the beginning of the season, the prospects of the Men's rugby team
may be looking up after an exciting tied game with
Lafayette College this past weekend. After losing seventeen points to their opponent in the first half, the undaunted Evil Buzzards quickly gained ground in the second.
Yannick Lanner-Cusin 'lO garnered seven points for the
team with one try and one conversion kick. Maurice
Stewart 10 and Scott Bird 'O9 of Neumann College, who
happen to play on the Swarthmore team, each obtained
five points for their tries. The team's remarkable comeback brought the overall score to a tie of 17 to 17, with no
scores upon the Buzzards during the second half. Captain
Paul Apollo 'O9 spoke glowingly of the team's performance,
enthusiastically calling it "one of the best games I've seen
our team play this season!"
The game of rugby is a direct descendant of football
and was founded at England's oldest Anglican co-educational boarding school the Rugby School. One distinct
feature that differentiates rugby from football is the complete lack of any form of bodily protections, except for
mouth guards. Combine the lack of protection with the
aggressive nature of the game, and the likelihood of getting hurt increases drastically. There are currently five
injuries on the men's team alone. Fortunately these hits
to the team are partially balanced by the spirit of the
rookies, who never fail to bring fresh blood and spirit to
the games. This year's rookies include Daniel Leigh 'O9,
Sam Green 'll and Jesse Hoff 'll
"It's been great so far, especially with the characters
who people the Swat rugby team," Green said. "I'm enjoying the structure provided by being on a team, getting
some exercise a few times a week, hanging with a good
group of guys, and of course the thrill of desecrating someone's barnside. It's a beautiful game."
Hoff confesses that what made rugby so enticing a sport
to him was the opportunity to "get in good shape, have fun
at parties and engage in [meaningful] combat."
Team practices are held three times per week. Practices
typically consist of the following sequence of activities:
jogging, stretching, tacking, splitting into forwards and
backwards, engaging in a simulated scrimmage and, finally, conditioning. The team always welcomes new members. "It doesn't matter if you have never played the sport
before," Apollo said. "As long as you are interested, come
check out the practices. We should be able to get you ready
to play within a couple of weeks."

Paul Apollo (center) breaks through a pack of Lehigh University players in a game earlier this season.
Because it is a club sport, no one ever gets cut. The
Buzzards will have a home game this coming Saturday at

1 p.m., competing against La Salle University.
Playing an outstanding game, Women's rugby trounced
Susquehanna University on Saturday, winning by a score
of 49-19. "I am very proud of our performance this past
weekend," co-captain Maria Mello 'OB said. "Everyone
played amazingly. If we keep on playing like this, we will
very likely make it to playoffs by the end of the season."
"The passing drills we do at practice, the tacking drills
and everything else came out in the game," co-captain
Karen Minyety 'OB said. "It showed that people really are
taking these things in." Scorers who earned tries (which
are each worth five points) included Lauren Kluz-

Wizniewski 'OB, Janet Zarate 11 Krystyn Mcllraith 'O9,
Molly Piels 'OB (twice), Minyety (twice), Anna Kastner 'OB
and Leigh Elko 10. Elko also scored two conversion kicks,
worth two points each.
"We all communicated well and supported each other
well on the field," Mello said. "You could see there was a
lot of teamwork during the game and that is the way good
rugby is played."
Veteran Kluz-Wizniewski, who is currently playing her
sixth season of rugby, gave a lively description of her try
from the game. "We had the ball on Susquehanna's 22-meter
line, and got the ball out to the backs, and I ran behind in
support of them," she said. "There was a pass that went off

the mark and the ball was rolling around on the ground, so
I picked it up and cut back inside to get into the try zone."
Normally, two matches take place during the course of a
day, including the A-side and the B-side games. However,
this week, due to injuries, the B-side game was canceled.
Rookies Zarate, Michelle Liu 11 and Amanda Morrison 11
subbed in for the A-side during the second half of the game.
"[The rookies] helped to keep the momentum of the game
going," Minyety said. Their ability to rise up to the occasion
was certainly one of the keys to the team's ultimate victory.
This second game of the season served as a timely
morale boost for the team, particularly because it lost a
game to Ursinus College last weekend. Women's practices
are held three times a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Fridays, on Cunningham field. The captains lead practices
once a week. For the other two practices per week, the
women train under the watchful eyes of their coach Alan,
whose relative taciturnity during the course of the game
contrasts sharply with his dynamic coaching style and his
ability to get the players into the perfect rugby mindset.
"It's no longer about learning new skills, but about
maintaining them and looking at the bigger picture on the
pitch," Elko said. "We've come a long way in a very short
amount of time, and I think everyone on our team deserves
credit for the dedication and hard work we all put forth."
The team's next game is this Saturday at 12 p.m. on
Cunningham field against Bucknell University.

There's no denying the fact

that the sport of boxing is not
what it used to be. Though the
blood and the beatings still occur,
the matchups and the magic are

gling with tremendous popularity

division from the

promote its up-and-coming stars
and spend less time on the aging
superstars whose fights are duller
than "Rush Hour 3." Someone
that boxing could really rally
around and use to turn the sport
around is 28-year-old Kassim
"The Dream" Ouma.
I had never heard of Ouma
until a few years back when he
was fighting an under card bout
that I happened to be watching
before Arturo "Thunder" Gatti
put "Jesse" James Leija to sleep
in the main event. Originally I
thought nothing of him, until a

couple of months later he was
fighting again and the ever ageless announcer, Larry Merchant,

started telling the remarkable
story of Ouma, which captured
my attention fully See, Ouma is
not just the average kid who grew
up around the gyms and had some

natural talent for_ pummeling

fools into the canvas; he is far

more remarkable.
Kassim Ouma was born in
Kampala, Uganda and like many
ordinary children across the
globe, began attending school.
However, it was at school when
he was just seven that Ouma was
kidnapped and forced to be a
child soldier in the rebel National
Resistance Army. After serving
ten years fighting in the Civil
War, Ouma began to box and soon
developed into an incredible amateur fighter. Holding an outstanding 60-3 record in Uganda, Kassim
Ouma traveled to the United
States with the Ugandan national
amateur team; it was a trip that
changed his life. It was on that
trip in 1998 that Ouma defected in
order to pursue a career in professional boxing. Sadly, in retalia-

October 4, 2007

tion for his defection, Ouma's

%

father was beaten to death by the
army and the rest of his family is
constantly under the threat of
death. Ouma's "dream" is literally to bring his family to America
so that they may have a better
life. And if in order to do this he
must beat other men senseless, so
be it. Interestingly enough,
though he fought in a war for
many years of his young life, it
wasn't until he came to the
United States that Ouma was
wounded. In December of 2002,
Kassim Ouma was randomly shot
in the stomach in Florida, which
forced the fighter to sit out for
three months before he could get
back into the ring.
Since beginning his professional career in the states, Ouma
is 25-2-2 with 15 knockouts and a
world championship belt in the
light middleweight division. After
rising through the ranks, Ouma
was offered a title fight against

middleweight

champ

Jermain

Taylor (Taylor since lost the title

to Kelly Pavlik, another hard-luck
fighter out of Youngstown, Ohio,
last Saturday by way of knockout). Though Ouma lost the fight
to Taylor in a unanimous decision
that went the distance, he has not
given up on fighting. Ouma is
known for constantly smiling outside the ring and for being incredibly thankful to God that he has
been given the opportunities that

he has.
Ouma's next bout will be
against former "Top Contender"
champion

Sergio "The Latin
Snake" Mora who boasts an
impressive
19-0 record,
on
Saturday, Oct. 6 on HBO. Be sure
to catch this fight, if for no other

reason than just to see the man
that has come so far from being a
child soldier in the war-torn
nation of Uganda. Ouma has both
the athletic talent and the heartwrenching story to turn the sport

of boxing around.
