Admissions selectivity on the rise, lower yield expected
BY YINGJIA WANG
ywangl@swartmore.edu
Once again this year, Swarthmore's admissions
acceptance rate has dropped to an all-time low. The college received 6,118 applications this year for the class of
2012 and admitted only 15 percent, a two percent decrease
from last year's acceptance rate of 17 percent.
According to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid
Jim Bock '9O, many reasons account for the increased
number of applicants this year. The number of seniors
applying to college each year in America continues to
increase.

Additionally, these seniors are submitting, on aver-

age, more applications.
Bock also cites Harvard University and Princeton

University's decisions to drop their early action and
early decision programs, respectively, as causes for
Swarthmore's rise in applications.

"What I've been saying is that all
bets are off in determining yield
How do you predict yield? It's hard.
It's part art, part science."
Jim Bock '9O
Dean of Admissions & Financial Aid
...

"Harvard and Princeton discontinued their early programs, so there are many more students who are now in

the pipeline," Bock said. "Those students have submitted, probably on average, another 10 to 12 applications."
Even with the class of 2012's increased selectivity,
Swarthmore actually admitted more candidates this year
than it did last year, admitting 929 prospective students
versus 890 for the class of 201
L
Bock said that this approximately 4.4 percent increase
is due to Swarthmore's expected drop in yield, which is
the percentage of admitted students who actually choose
to matriculate at the college.

NEWS

The same factors that accounted for Swarthmore's
increased selectivity may also explain the drop in yield.
According to Bock, the more colleges that students apply
to, the more options they may have come decision time.
Therefore, there is a greater likelihood that any admitted
student will choose another college over Swarthmore.
There is also increased unpredictability involved in
predicting yield this year., according to Bock.
"This year is doubly difficult," he said. "What I've
been saying is that all bets are off in determining yield
How do you predict yield? It's hard. It's part art, part science," Bock said.
Harvard and Princeton's decisions to drop their early
programs come into play with regard to predicting yield
as well.
"It's harder to determine yield not only because apps
are up but because two large competitors have yet to fill
their classes," Bock said.
Bock also cited the often unpredictable ways in which
students choose colleges as yet another factor that makes
yield difficult to forecast.
"[Students applying to college] are 17, so much of what
they do is not logical," Bock said. "I remember one stuIvy League university
dent who said, 'Well, I chose
because I have a better chance of finding a wife there.
How do you predict that?'" Bock said.
As a student who was deferredFall Early Decision but
admitted come Regular Decision time, prospective student Anna Levine is one example of the varying factors
that come into play when making college decisions.
"I really didn't think I was going to get into
Swarthmore regular decision, so I thought about other
colleges too," Levine said.
"I heard back from the University of Chicago first, so
I got pretty psyched about that. It has the same atmosphere and intellectual climate as Swarthmore. But then I
heard back from Swarthmore, and now I'm getting excited about that. I think Swarthmore's still my number one
choice," she said.
As a result of the expected decrease in yield, more students were offered a spot on the waitlist this year.
According to Bock, approximately 1,000 applicants to the
class of 2012 were given this option.
As for the number of students actually on the waitlist,
Bock says that the number is unknown, as students are"
...

IN

not automatically placed on the waitlist, but are rather
offered the option to be put on it. Since decision letters
were sent out recently, the Admissions Office has yet to
receive any replies to its offers for the waitlist.

"I really didn't think I was going to
get into Swarthmore regular
decision, so I thought about other
colleges, too but then I heard
back from Swarthmore."
Anna Levine
Accepted prospective student
...

In response to those who question why Swarthmore
offers so many students positions on the waitlist, Bock said
that his reasoning is twofold.
"The quality is there," Bock said. "What I always say is
that Swarthmore is a highly self-selecting institution. Few
students apply on whim here
The vast majority is
absolutely qualified to do the work here. So a reason that we
waitlist so many is because they're deserving. Another reason is that it makes sense to give the students the Opportunity to come here. Also, we are not putting them on the waitlist, we are offering a spot on the waitlist. They have to
...

accept the spots."

Bock plans to use the waitlist the same way this year as,
he has in years past, stating that the office uses it to round
out the class after all the admitted students have sent thenreply cards back. In the past 12 years, Swarthmore has
admitted as few as zero to as many as 75 students off the
waitlist.
Current students are happy to see the college's selectivity increasing. "I think that something like this can only be
positive for Swarthmore," Angelica Saada 'lO said. "People
always say that they came here or want to come here for the
intellectual atmosphere, so it's good to see that not only are
supposedly smarter students coming here, but that they also
want to come for the 'right reasons.' That is, for the intellectualness that we are

reputed to

have."

BRIEF

Highly attended talk by conservative "modesty' author Wendy Shalit draws big crowds and even bigger questions
Controversial author of "Girls Gone
Mild: Young Women Reclaim Self-Respeet
and Find It's Not Bad to Be Good" Wendy
Shalit spoke to an eagerly expectant audience in Lang Performing Arts Center on
Wednesday evening about sex, modesty
and alternatives to a culture she perceives
as forcedly inculcated toward unauthentic
casual encounters.
Claiming that we live in a society that is
hostile to modesty, Shalit encouraged those
uncomfortable with what she calls the
hookup culture to rebel against what has
become the new norm and actively work to
breakdown what she perceives to be a modern day phenomenon of equating privacy
with shame.
"Today, modesty has become taboo. It's
misunderstoodas having to do with shame,
but it's about setting boundaries and protecting the intimate center of a person,"
Shalit said.
Sharing letters and personal stories
with the audience, Shalit insisted that the
majority of college students are actually
unhappy withthe hookup culture and then
went on to encourage those who felt pressured to conform to what she perceives as
the unnatural, media-indoctrinated hookup culture to make their voices heard.
"Don't underestimate the impact you can

THE PHOENIX

make by speaking out," Shalit said. "By
deciding to no longer hookup and raising
your standards, you're standing your
ground and letting others know that an
alternative is possible."
Students reacted viscerally to Shalit's
speech, finding, in particular, much of her
language problematic and offensive.
When Shalit encouraged both men and
women to rebel against equally low standards and return to modesty, Brianne
Gallagher 'O9 spoke out in frustration,
arguing that we should be pushing for
equal standardsfor men and women rather
than for equally high or equally low standards. She was promptly met with agreeing
applause from the audience.
During the brief question and answer
session that followed Shalit's speech,
Jeremy Freeman 'OB asked Shalit to provide evidence for her claims about the
innateness of modesty, and when Shalit
went on to suggest that children's usual
reactions to the mention of sex
embarrassed giggling
is perhaps significant
because it indicates that sex is something
that should be private, a member of the
audience caEed out to ask Shalit if she was
aware that infants masturbate.
Anna Phillips 'lO raised a concern that,

question suggested, many students seemed
to share, challenging Shalit to explain
wherethe queer community fit into the heteronormative paradigm that she put forth
in her talk.
"Respecting boundaries refers to every-

one because we're all human," answered
Shalit. "It's part of having human emotions
that dosen't change because of sexual
orientation."
Dermot Delude-Dix 'O9 levied a similar
objection of margmalization against Shalit,

April 3, 2008

asking: "If you're critiquing feminism, why
do you think it's a good idea to drop any
notion ofthe political from your analysis or
any analysis of class, queemess, or race?"
Though Shalit attempted to defend her
argument against these objections by elaborating upon the ideas she put forth in her
speech, she was met with a murmuring
crowd, furrowed brows, repeated applause
in support of the questioners' objections
and continuous stream of interruptions.

Event series on Islam begins WEEK IN PICTURES
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu

University
of
professor of Religious
Studies, gave a lecture Tuesday as part of a
film and lecture series on Islamic studies
taking place this month. The lecture, entitled "Islam and the Defense of History,"

Jamal

Elias,

Pennsylvania

focused on the role of reason and rationality in Islam in both a contemporary and historical perspective.

Tuesday's talk is the second lecture of

the

series "Islam,
Globalism and
Cosmopolitanism" put together by the religion and sociology and anthropology
departments.
"The idea is great, and the topic is very
timely," Elias said. "I love the fact that it
deals with globalism and modernity and so
many different topics and methods of
study."
The series organizers, Professor Tariq
al Jamil of the religion department and
professor Farha Ghannam of the sociology
and anthropology department, made it a
goal to invite professors studying different
aspects of Islamic studies.
"We wanted a range of perspectives in
order to get different ideas of Islam," al
Jamil said. "[The lecturers] are really a
group of acclaimed professors, and we
wanted to get their perspectives on what
it's like to be engaged in Islamic Studies."
Al Jamil hopes that the variety of topics
covered will give students a broad perspective of Islam. "We tried to bring together
the artistic and intellectual side of the culture," he said. These facets of Islam are
integrated into the different lectures. "We
are aware of the different dimensions,
aspects and approaches, and we are trying
to engage them all," Ghannam said.
Professors are using this opportunity to
supplement their teachings. "It's good to
bring in different perspectives to fill the
gaps of our classes and to supplement our
teachings," Ghannam said. "It is good for
the students and for us [the faculty] and the
community at large to learn more about
Islam."
The series is made possible by the donation ofSwarthmore alum Bruce Gould '54,
who provided the funds for the series. "If
you look at the television or media news,
or even the government we have these
days, the view of the Muslim community is

so false. There is no understanding about
them," Gould said. "I thought Swarthmore,
with its superb faculty and students, was
the perfect place to breed knowledge about
Islamic Studies."
The lectures so far have been well
attended, according to al Jamil. "I thought
it was really successful. The students
seemed engaged and interested," he said.
Students at the lecture felt similarly. "It
was very interesting, provided a new and
unusual lens onto looking at Islam,"
Camilia Kamoun 11, who has attended
both of the lectures, said. "They didn't
present what you would think of as the traditional religious discussion. It is more
religion as it applies to living in the modern world."
Tuesday's lecture as well as the first lecture in the series, "Islam and the making of
cosmopolitan cultures," by Hamid Dabashi
of Columbia University, focused more on
the historical aspect of Islam, according to
Ghannam.
"We are starting with the history,
because it is important for students to be
versed in the history of the culture,"
Ghannam said. "Then we are going to
move towards the more contemporary
period, the more anthropology based topics."

The upcoming lectures "Sexuality,
Modernity and Authenticity: the checkered career of 'Zina' in the Islamic legal
tradition,"

by
Judith
Tucker
of
Georgetown University, and "Mediatized
Islam, Cyberspace and the public sphere in
the Muslim world," by Jon Anderson of the
Catholic University of America, will be on
April 10 and 17, respectively.
The lectures will be supplemented by
film screenings, which, although not
directly connected to the lectures, touch on
the same important themes covered in the
lectures, according to al Jamil.
The timing of the lecture series is coordinated well to draw attention to the future
goals of the Islamic studies program. "Our
proposal is being considered," al Jamil
said. "We submitted our curriculum and
academic proposal for review."
The series and possibility of a future
Islamic studies program emphasizes the
growing interest in studying Islam. "It's
important to get the entire college
involved, since Islamic studies is such a
timely and important topic," al Jamil said.

Luce scholarship for Asian study awarded to two students
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Goldwater fellowship for scientific research granted to Saxon, an honorable mention to Mai
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swarthmore.edu
As fellowships and prizes news continues to trickle in,
Swarthmore recently received news of more winners from
the college. Marshall Morales 'OB and Noah Metheny 'O3 were
named Luce Scholars while James Saxon 'O9 was named a
Goldwater Scholar and Mark Mai 'O9. received an honorable
mention from the Goldwater Scholars Foundation.
According to its Web site, the Luce Scholars Program
awards stipends and arranges internships for a yearlong
work experience in Asia. Eighteen graduating seniors and
recent alumni from the United States receive the scholarship
every year. While most prestigious scholarships require
extensive experience in the subject matter from its candidates, the Luce is notably different in that it calls for its applicants to have'little or no prior knowledge of the Asian world.
Fellowships and Prizes Adviser Melissa Mandos says that
the college received four internal candidates for the Luce this
year, and, as with nearly all fellowships and prizes,
Swarthmore then proceeded with an internal review process
and sent three nominees to the Luce Foundation. While there
are no caps on the number of internal candidates, there is a
limit to the number of nominees that the college can put forward. Normally, each participating college is allowed two

nominees, but colleges who advanced at least one nominee to
the final rounds in the previous year are allowed three nominees in the current year. Therefore, Swarthmore was given
three nomination spots this year.
Mandos said that the Luce has an especially demanding
interview schedule for applicants. "Every nominee gets an
initial interview by a Luce Scholar. Based on that, Luce
Scholars make recommendations on who should be nominated for final interviews. The final interview is then actually a series of interviews throughout one day," she said.
Morales initially became interested in applying for the
Luce as a result ofhis wish to investigate the ties between the
environment and urbanization in Asia.
"I was interested in the process of urbanization in Asia
with special attention to the environmental degradation that
comes with that," Morales said. "And also, China, Japan, and
the Koreas have very established traditions of urban design
that are very unique. They have a lot of myth and glory I
found interesting the combination of historic and cultural
ideas mixed with contemporary environmental issues."
Although placements have yet to be finalized, Morales
says that he will most likely be working at a landscape architecture firm in Tokyo or Beijing next year.
Unlike Morales, who is a current student at the college,
this year's other Luce winner graduated Swarthmore in 2003.
Metheny matriculated at the University of California,
...

Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law immediately following
graduation from Swarthmore. Metheny said that he became
interested in HTV/AIDS issues while at Swarthmore through
classes and summer research. This interest persisted
throughout law school in the form of internships and externships. At the moment, Metheny is working in Washington
D.C. in the legal services department of a medical clinic
geared towardsLGBT health issues.
Metheny was attracted to the Luce because of the opportunity to take his HTV/AIDS work to Asia.
"The HTV/AIDS epidemic is a very pressing health and
human rights issues in Southeast Asia. I heard about the
Luce at Swarthmore and was always interested in applying.
So, I thought that, given my interests in HTV/AIDS, it would
be a good place to not only continue doing this type of work
but also to gain experience in issues unique to
South/Southeast Asia," Metheny said.
He anticipates that his Luce placement will be in
HTV/ATDS legal work in Thailand.
Metheny's alumni status may have helped him in the
application process in that his several years out of college
allowed him to better focus his career plans. Mandos stated
that the Luce Scholars Program desires applicants with a
strong idea of their desired career paths. "The Luce is really
looking for individuals who are very focused in terms of
their career objectives. Sometimes alumni can have a slight
advantage because they have been out there and have demonstrated commitment to their careers," Mandos said.
Metheny credits the time since graduating from
Swarthmore during which he spent working on strengthening his application. "I initially applied for the Luce my last
year of law school and didn't get it. I think one reason was
that I didn't know what I wanted to do enough to articulate
my position. Being out in the workforce for over two years
has given me an ideaof what type ofwork I want to be doing,"

he said.
Swarthmorealso hit success withthe Barry M. Goldwater
Scholarship this year. As stated on its Web site, the
Goldwater Scholarship, which was established by former
Senator Barry M. Goldwater, awards scholarships to rising
college juniors and seniors who intend to pursue careers in
the sciences, math and engineering. These scholarships are
worth a maximumof $7,500 and are to be used towards undergraduate fees. This year, ten students from the college
applied internally for the Goldwater and four candidates
advanced as nominees, said Mandos. One student, James
Saxon 'O9, won the scholarship while another student, Mark
Mai 'O9, received an Honorable Mention.
Mandos emphasized that the Goldwater Program desires
students with a strong focus on the three stated target career
fields.

Katherine Koch Phoenix Staff

A recent winner of the Luce fellowship, Marshall Morales
plans to work for a landscape architecture firm in Asia.
"The Goldwater is really looking for students that clearly
are committed to careers in the sciences, math and engineerIt also really helps for students to have done work in
ing
the area such as some lab work. It is looking for students who
will have initiative and impact in their fields," Mandos said.
For Saxon, that experience came by way of extensive summer research.
"For the past five summers (i.e., since after my sophomore
year of high school), I have been working for the Transition
Radiation Tracker (TRT) of the ATLAS project, one ofthe two
large, multi-purpose detectors on the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN (the European Particle Physics Labs) in Geneva,
Switzerland. As a whole, the project (2000 people on this
detector alone; thousands more in total), is a discovery
machine'; that is, it seeks to find new physics' beyond the
standard model of our current understanding," Saxon said
in an e-mail.

NEWS IN BRIEF
3rd annual Tri-Co Peace Week to Include panel on Iran-US relations, benefit concert by State Radio, and MLK Jr.
The Tri-College community will be
hosting Peace Week, a week of events to

promote awareness of violence and the

efforts to stop it.

"[Peace Week] is a great
way to learn about
different types of violence
in our community in a
more local way."
Deivid Rojas '2l
Assistant Coordinator,
Peace Week
Peace Week, which begins on Friday
and lasts until the following Friday, was
started in 2003 at Council Rock High
School by Brandon Lee Wolff 'OB through
his organization SAVE R US, and has

THE PHOENIX

expanded to all of Bucks County and
Tri-Co. This will be the third year that
Peace Week has been held at
Swarthmore.
Throughout the week, different clubs
will be hosting various events and workshops on the peace initiative at all three
Tri-Co campuses. For the keynote
events, special blue busses will be used
to transport students between the three
campuses. These events include the
Martin Luther King, Jr. kick-off collection event, United for Peace: Tri-Co A
Capella and Dance Jamboree, the Walk
for Peace, a State Radio benefit concert
and the 60s Peace Party Finale.
The week will feature several
respectable speakers. This Friday, former Senator Harris Wofford, who was an
advisor to Martin Luther King, Jr. and
President of Bryn Mawr, will be speaking at Bryn Mawr. Also on Friday,
Reverend Ralph Roy, a civil-rights
activist, will speak at Swarthmore on
the 40th anniversary of MLK's assassination-

On Monday, Congressman Joe Sestak,
Dr. Philip H. Gordon of the Brookings
Institute and Dr. Ray Takeyh of the
Council on Foreign Relations will talk
about US-Iran relations at Swarthmore
at an event co-hosted by the College
Democrats and Republicans.
Peace Week will start and end with
peace pole dedications. This Friday
there will be a peace pole dedication at
Haverford to start the week and a dedication at Swarthmore the following
Friday to end the week.
The poles will be five sided with pairs
of two languages of conflicting peoples
on each.
"I think it's really cool that we are
not only starting and ending with peace
polls but that the peace polls are permanent structures on both campuses
beyond this peace week and hopefully
for many years to come," Wolff said.
Peace Week does not focus on combating any single case of violence; rather,
the events range from topics on violence
in Philadelphia to the crisis in Sudan.

April 3, 2008

The event planners are very excited
for the events and hope to spread awareness.
"I just think it's cool that it's not just
the committee but that we get to work
with the Tri-Co community and working
with different clubs on campus and how
they all can contribute to the idea of
peace," Assistant Coordinator Deivid
Rojas 11 said. "It's a great way to learn
about different types of violence in our
community in a more local way and learn
about the different kind of perspectives
on what peace can mean."
Wolff stressed that peace week is a
combination of awareness and action and
encouraged everyone to attend the events.
"I think it's really important that students are not only aware, but that they get
educated on issues that they may not
already be knowledgeable about so they
can take action," he said.

Nick Gaw 'O9 has been appointed the new executive
director of the national organization of STAND, A
Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, and will take on this
new role beginning May L Gaw, who has been serving
the organization as the Mid-Atlantic Outreach
Coordinator this past year, will be replacing the outgoing
head, Scott Warren, a junior at Brown University.
STAND, founded in 2004 at Georgetown University, is
the umbrella organization for over 700 chapters at high

and its various coordinators."

Finally, the directorprovides "a long-term vision for the
organization to move forward," emphasizing the persisting nature of the movement against genocide. "It's a powerful position of a powerful movement," Warren said.
Gaw was among several candidates who applied, and
was notified of his acceptance last Friday. "I think we
thought that Nick exhibited a lot of the traits that we want
to see in a student leader," Warren said. "I think he's someone who demonstrated a lot of initiative and leadership
and passion for the cause, and he's someone that I think
will bring a lot to the table next year."
While much of Gaw's experience comes from his work
in the Genocide Intervention Network and Swat STAND,
his interest in Darfur stretches back to high school.
"I first got involved in 2004, in high school, when I used
to do policy debate and the resolution that year was something about the United Nations taking action in a peacekeeping effort and our case was about Darfur, and so that
was something that first sparked my interest," Gaw said.

Gaw was impressed by the group of then-sophomores
who were running Swat Sudan (Swat STAND as of this
year), and soon became involved in advocacy and, as he
calls it, "making noise" by sending letters and petitions.
"This past year I learned a whole lot about how the organization works and I think I've stepped into a place where I
can really start to make it better," he said.
Up until May X Gaw will be transitioning into his new
position. Apparently, STAND itself is also going through a
process of transition and turnover, as it will be hiring an
entirely new management committee, according to Gaw.
Meanwhile, STAND is involved in a campaign to influence the presidential candidates and keep Darfur on the
table. According to Gaw, the purpose of the campaign,
called Ask the Candidates, is to "make sure that all the
candidates have a strong position on Darfur," and once the

next president is elected, to hold them to those promises.

"I think I've stepped into a place
where I can really start to make [the
organization] better."

Incoming Executive Director,
STAND
In addition, STAND is looking to broaden its scope to
include conflicts in Burma and East Congo. "We're broadening out from just Darfur to make sure that when we see
something that looks like genocide happening, we don't
stand complicit by being silent," Gaw said.
Swarthmore's chapter of STAND, formerly known as
Swat Sudan, runs under the general program of the
national STAND organization. With roughly 20 active students, the group is hosting a Darfur cultural event on
Sunday, and is also planning for a conference in two
weeks.
While Gaw's primary role will be acting as executive
director of the national branch, his presence is still felt by
members of Swat STAND.
"We think of [him] as kind of a mentor," member
Elizabeth Calvert-Kilbane 'lO said. "He's at effectively
every meeting, and remains really involved with Swat
STAND."

Spirited mascot contest ends with 'phoenix' debut
BY MARA REVKIN

mrevkinl@swarthmore.edu

Almost one year after the
was voted in as
Swarthmore's official mascot, a
series of grueling auditions has
yielded five finalists who will
collectively represent the character at various athletic events and
campus functions.
Over the weekend, Melissa
Grigsby 'O9, Dan Hodson 'O9,
Juliana Macri 'O9, Scott Storm
'OB and Joel Tolliver 'lO surpassed stiff competition from
several other hopefuls in public
as well as closed-door auditions
to earn the privilege of reprephoenix

senting the phoenix. According
to Kyle White 'OB, an architect of
the mascot selection process, the
team offive students will coordinate their schedules and take
shifts representing the phoenix
at its numerous public appearances, ensuring that the mascot's
visibility around campus does
not suffer from the time con-

straints of its student incarnation.
"Because people at
Swarthmore are so busy, this
allows students with differing
time commitments and sched-

ules to share the responsibility of
wearing the suit," White said.
In preparation for the tryouts, the Communications Office
coordinated
the
"Mascot
Communications
Subcommittee," a group of students and staff who helped
orchestrate the two rounds of
auditions that took place over

the weekend.
In Saturday's preliminary
round of auditions, Anna Baeth
'O9, Alex Gilbert-Bono 'lO, Finlay
Logan 'OB, Macri, Hodson,
Grigsby and Storm appeared

before a packed audience in
LPAC, where they were evaluated on the basis of three separate
criteria: talent, athletic performance and pep. Kyle White 'OB, an

architect of the mascot selection
process, and Claire Melin 'OB, a
co-founder of the Ladies Soiree
Society, emceed the event, which
was scrutinized by a diverse
panel of judges including
Associate Dean of Student Life

Myrt Westphal, Registrar Martin
Warner, assistant track and field
coach Tom Reynolds, Suneal
Bedi 'O9, Maggie DeLorme 10 as
well as a visiting consultant and
authority on character branding,
Dave Raymond. Raymond spent
over 16 years as the original
Philly Phanatic before founding
Raymond Entertainment Group,
a consulting firm with which the
college has worked over the mascot's conceptualization.
According
White,
to
Saturday's competition allowed
the judges to evaluate the contestants' energy and movement
as well as their ability to motivate a crowd. "In the final [pep]
section, the contestants were
played a 30 second clip of music
and they had to use' that time to
get the crowd pumped up. We
wanted to see how the audience
would respond to their unique
personalities," White said.
The public auditions yielded
four finalists: Hodson, Macri,
Grigsby and Storm. Tolliver
made his debut at a walk-on

THE PHOENIX

audition the following day.
At Sunday's closed-door auditions, each finalist spent nearly
an hour in front of the judges,
some of which was spent in the
phoenix costume itself. As each
contestant donned the suit,
Raymond gave directions on how
to move and act. According to
Macri, the person inside the costume cannot speak or show
facial expressions, which complicates the portrayl of emotions.
"The suit doesn't restrict
movement too much, but visibility is pretty bad. You actually
have to see through a mesh panel
in the phoenix's neck, and in
order to have the head of the
mascot facing forward, you have
to be looking down," Macri said.
According to Macri, two of
the five finalists have to be on
hand for any given appearance
by the mascot, since putting the
suit on is a feat in and of itself.

Macri said.

Director of Communications

Nancy Nicely said that she anticipates great future demand for

such appearances, which will
facilitate the character's integration into the college's culture.
"We have already received a half
dozen requests for this semester
and I think this will only
increase over time," Nicely said.
According to Macri, the team
of students has been given considerable freedom to 'develop the
personality of the mascot."
White said that the five finalists
were chosen because "they all
brought unique energy and gave
life to our concept of what the
phoenix should be." Although
the

Mascot Committee spent

much of the fall semester brainstorming a rough framework for
the mascot's character, it is up to
the students who wear the costume to develop unique traits.
"We wanted the phoenix to be
quirky, clumsy, slightly rumpled, but also friendly. We chose
characteristics that embody

Swarthmore's values, but we did-

n't get too specific about personality. We're hoping that the mascot's personality will evolve over
this spring and next fall, and the
finalists will play a big part in

that," White said.
The Communications Office
has taken several steps to
enhance the mascot's visibility.
"The responses we've received
so far have been very positive
and supportive," Nicely said.
The mascot will be publicized on
the college's News Web site with
a feature article supplemented
by video footage of the auditions.

New publications vie for student interest, funding
BY ARIEL MARTINO
amartinl@swarthmore.edu

Three new student-run publications are up for charter,
but the Charter Committee of Student Council presently
has the funds to charter only one. Charter Committee
chair Paul Apollo 'O9 said that all three publications would
be worthwhile projects, but admitted that cost is a "big
issue."
The benefits of being a chartered organization on campus include the ability to receive funding from the Student
Budget Committee. However, in order to be chartered, the
Charter Committee must unanimously approve the organization and its proposed budget.
The Night Cafe, one of the three new publications that
hope to be chartered, has already released one issue,
financed by a $3,000 grant from the President's Office. The
magazine was released just before spring break, complete
with a release party. Editor-in-Chief Eli Epstein-Deutsch
'lO said that the magazine was very well received. "[I was]
particularly glad that so many people seemed inspired to
think of ways they could contribute based on their particular niche, talent or interest," he said.
Apollo characterized the content of The Night Cafe as
"New Yorker-esque," referring to its mix of journalism, art
and fiction. "The content is determined more by how compelling it is than by what genre it falls into," said Alyssa
Work 'OB, senior editor of The Night Cafe.
The Night Cafe is currently requesting $24,000 per year,
considerably greater than the budgets allocated to any
other presently chartered student publication, with the
exception of the Halcyon yearbook. Epstein-Deutsch said
he hopes that the budget will allow for expansion to
include a science section, excerpts from novels and pieces
about Philadelphia. He also hopes to start an alumni subscription service as well as a functional Web site. Another
significant expense will be printing on glossy paper, which
Epstein-Deutsch said is the best medium on which to display the work of the artists and photographers who contribute.
Similarly, the budding photography magazine
Pun/ctum!!!„ which also hopes to be granted a charter,
plans to use glossy paper to provide a medium for photographers that is not offered by any other publication. Editor
Linda Huang 'OB calls the magazine "an excellent outlet for
the visual and creative minded to express themselves in a
publication that caters only to photography."

With a proposed budget of about $12,000, Pun/ctum!!! is
also out of the range that Student Council was willing to
spend on new groups. According to Huang, the magazine's
editors originally believed that Pun/ctum!!! had no chance
of being chartered and had begun considering an Internet
release.
SBC is planning to roll $lO,OOO into next year's budget.
Given the amount of these leftover funds, "Pun/ctum!!! is
likely to be chosen to be chartered," Apollo said.
At this point, some members of the committee are still
apprehensive. Due to the large budgets of both publications, Apollo said the "opinion on the committee right now
is it looks like it's going to be The Night Cafe or
Pun/ctum!!!. The committee is concerned about The Night
Cafe's enormous budget and Apollo said that "if they are
chartered, it will not be for $24,000."
The Swarthmore Review, the third publication that is
being considered for chartering, is an international poetry
journal that editor Justin DiFeliciantonio 'lO hopes will be
similar to other institution-affiliated poetry journals such
as the Yale Review.
Apollo said that The Swarthmore Review has little hope
of being chartered. Because its international focus, the
publication "is not under the category that should be paid
for with student activities funds." Apollo said that
although The Swarthmore Review includes a section for
poetic works of Swarthmore students, its primary objective is to publish poetry from around the world.
While The Swarthmore Review is not likely to receive a
charter, Apollo is hopeful that the publication will get
underway with the help of alternative sources of funding.
The Swarthmore Review is asking for approximately
$6,000 and is currently working with members of Student
Council to find other ways to finance the publication.
Just as Apollo and the rest of the Appointments and
Charter committee support The Swarthmore Review getting started with or without being chartered, they hope
that both The Night Cafe and Pun/ctum!!! will find a way
regardless of the committee's decision. "We're stuck making some pretty hard choices," Apollo said.
The Charter committee supports all three magazines,
but Apollo said "right now the publication market is very
saturated at this school, so if a new magazine comes out,
we need to make sure it's contributing something very
new."
Existing student publications are also concerned about
the feasibility of continuing their activities on campus.

The next issue of new publication "The Night Cafe,"
which aims to provide a forum for longhand essays and
journalism, is expected later this semester.
Rachel Aucott 'OB, editor of Small Craft Warnings,
Swarthmore's existing literary magazine that publishes

poetry, short stories, black and white photography, drawings, plays and short personal essays, said she is worried
about the volume in submissions to campus literary publications. In her time on the staff of Small Craft Warnings,
she has seen the volume of poetry submitted diminish by
one and a half times the number of submissions in Fall
2004. Generally, most of the submissions come from writ-

ing workshops sponsored by Small Craft Warnings and
writing workshops offered by the English Department.
Many students have noted the perpetually extended
deadlines at Small Craft Warnings as a sign of the shortage
of submissions. Aucott points to the fact that most writers
simply wait until the last minute to submit anything and
that "people have come to expect the extended deadline,
meaning that we usually get the bulk of our submissions in
the day or two before the extended due date."
While Aucott believes that the other publications, most
notably The Night Cafe really offer something special, she
believes "the creative writing community here is just not
big or vibrant enough to result in a competitive volume of
submissions for all the magazines on campus."
Work believes that The Night Cafe will not take away
from submissions to other magazines. According to Work,
The Night Cafe is the only publication for "writers who
might not be completely satisfied writing academic prose,
daily news reporting, or fiction."
"There's something really satisfying about writing a
long-form piece well, finding out as much as you can about
it without a limiting daily or weekly time frame, putting
loads of work into it and seeing it published," Work said.
Huang is equally confident that chartering Pun/ctum!!!
would not funnel submissions from other publications.
She is aware of criticism that publishing an expensive
magazine is not necessary with the plethora of art exhibits
on campus and in the city and responds by pointing out
that "art exhibitions around campus cannot substitute a
tangible magazine."
In order to free up student activities funding to distribute to new groups such as The Night Cafe and Pun/ctum!!!,
Student Council is currently in talks.with the administration to stop using money from the student activities fee to
fund Swarthmore's yearbook, the Halcyon. According to
Apollo, student interest in the publication has diminished

and its withdrawal from student activities fund would free
up an additional $50,000 per year.

Delay in annual animal research report,
still in compliance with AWA guidelines
BY ROSARIO PAZ

rpazl@swarthmore.edu

A recent press release made available
on the official Web site of the Humane
Society of the United States concerning a
lawsuit filed by the HSUS against the
United States Department of Agriculture
revealed that Swarthmore was one of 81
animal research institutions that had
failed to file mandatory annual reports
about research animals' "pain and distress" at least one time between 1999 and
2004. The submission of these annual
reports is mandated by the Animal
Welfare Act. According to Associate
Professor of Biology Sarah Hiebert Burch
and Animal Facility Manager Tami Gura,
co-chairs of the college's Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (lACUC),
the failure to file this report was due to a
"clerical mix-up" and the report was eventually turned in.
According to a listing released by the
USDA of the 81 animal research institutions that had failed to file these mandatory reports, the college had failed to file a
report in 2000-2001. During this time,
Burch and Biology Department Business
and Technology Manager Matt Powell
were the appointed co-chairs of the lACUC

at the college.

As it does every year, the USDA, which

acts as an inspecting agency for all insti-

tutions involved in animal research,

requested information from the college in
order to assess its compliance with the
various provisions of the Animal Welfare
Act, according to Burch. This request is
sent to a primary contact, the provost of
the college, in charge of filing a response
to the USDA.
At the time of the failure to file this
report, Jennie Keith was in the process of
ceding the position of provost to Connie
Hungerford, according to Burch.

"The provost doesn't have a direct hand
in research at the institution, but she is, in
effect, our boss. We have to file it through
her," Burch said.
Because of this change of provost, the
request from the USDA was forwarded to
Keith, who was no longer the acting
provost of the college, and was never forwarded to Hungerford or either co-chair of
the lACUC. Consequently, this clerical
error created a delay in the submission of
the college's report.
According to Gura, although the
lACUC had eventually sent a complete animal research report to the USDA, it was
still classified as "a failure to send in the
report."

Failure to send in reports can result in
warnings first, then fines, and ultimately,
termination of animal research at the
institution, according to Burch.
"Basically, all animal research at that
institution would have to be shut down,"
Burch said. "Even those that were not
responsible for violating the [Animal
Welfare] Act would be punished in that
way."
During his time as co-chair of the college's lACUC, Powell had requested that
the USDA annul the warning that had
been issued to the college, which the
USDA agreed to do.
The report itself contains the total
number of animals used in experiments
whether in a lab research project or in
fieldwork. These animals are categorized
in one of three ways: no "pain or distress,"
alleviated "pain or distress" or unalleviated "pain or distress." As of the present, the

college has never had any animals thatfell

Additionally, a USDA inspector makes
an annual visit to the college in order to
ensure that all animal research being conducted meets all guidelines of the AWA.
"So [the USDA inspectors] show up
whenever they want and they look over
everything the lACUC has done since they
last came to campus," Burch said. "They
read all the protocols that the lACUC has
approved to make sure that they agree
with the way we're approving protocols,
and sometimes they ask to see our labs,
records, sometimes they even ask to see
student lab notebooks, so they're extremely thorough when they come."Foliowing

BROWN DAILY HERALD (BROWN U.)
Light streams through
(U-WIRE)
floor-to-ceiling windows in Harvard
University's Quadrangle Recreational
Athletic Center on a Monday afternoon,
hitting a battalion of elliptical machines.
A less noticeable detail of this gym, however, is its most controversial: the
absence of Y chromosomes.
A few months ago, Harvard became
one of a handful of colleges to set aside
specific gym hours for women only, a
policy that has sparked indignation and
debate at Harvard and on other campus-

es across the nation.

In response to requests from six
female Muslim students wishing to exercise without the constraint of burqas and
hijabs, on Jan. 28 Harvard designated six
hours a week in one of its gyms as
women-only. "This trial program is in
keeping with a long tradition at Harvard
of working collaboratively with our students to address issues as they arise,"
Judith Kidd, Harvard's associate dean of
student life, wrote in an official statement. "The program will be reviewed at
the end of the semester."
Many Harvard students have criticized the decision, labeling it anti-feminist, an example of political correctness
gone wrong and a new form of segregation. Others defend the policy as one that
promotes women's health.
Harvard junior Nick Wells said that
when he walks by the gym during
women-only hours, he often sees only
two or three women using the facility.

He said the times allotted for women
early Tuesday and Thursday mornings
and Monday afternoons are inconvenient for anyone living in the religious
houses far away, but are peak hours for
residents of the Quad like himself.
"If they want to help (female Muslim
students) out, at least try to do it in a
genuine way that's practical for them or
practical for us," he said. "I think you
need to be economical about it."
In a Feb. 20 column- in the Harvard
Crimson, Wells criticized the policy's

is
According to the guide, "the goal
to promote the humane care of animals
...

used in biomedical and behavioral
research, teaching and testing." Its definition of laboratory animals includes any
vertebrate animal that is used in
research, teaching or testing.
If animal research were to be conducted following only AWA guidelines, virtually all mice, rats and birds bred for the
purpose of research, which account for
almost 85% of all animals used in laboratories, would not be includedunder the provisions, according to the HSUS Web site.
Animal Rights Coalition Treasurer
Brian Tomasik 'O9 said that animal welfare advocates commonly believe that the
Animal Welfare Act is not inclusive of
enough of the wide variety of animals that
are used in research laboratories.
"The main reason that animal welfare
is important is that you're providing that
animals aren't suffering," he said. "You
suffer just as much no matter what
species you are. It would be important
that this act extends to those species that
people may not,care as much about but

still suffer the same amount."
The complexities of maintaining compliance with the AWA and other provisions dictated by the USDA led the college
to hire Gura, who works full time to
ensure the college's compliance with all
animal welfare regulations.
"Two years ago, Connie Hungerford
agreed that it was an important enough
position that we couldn't just have that
job be a part of someone else's job," Burch
said of the need for Gura's position. "It
makes it much easier for us to keep ahead
of the game. The rules change in small
ways all the time, but keeping with all
that is a big job."

lack of transparency and the inconvenience it causes male residents of the
Quad who regularly use the gym. Dozens
of students and alums agreed with him
in online responses to the article.
"My religion dictates that I work out
in an empty building alone for eight
hours a day. How does Harvard plan to
accommodate me?" quipped one student
in an online comment.
Atena Asiaii 'OB, a member of Brown
University's
Muslim
Student
Association, said she feels Harvard's policy has been cast as a religious issue,
when it is in fact a women's issue.
"I actually think the issue itself has
been mischaracterized in the media," she

said.
The issue of women-only gym hours
has never come up at Brown, said
Director
of
Athletics
Michael
Goldberger. Asiaii, a Muslim woman
who wears a hijab, long sleeves and long
pants, routinely uses the Brown gym
without feeling encumbered by her
clothing.

She said she does not mind co-ed gym
time, though she believes many women
feel more comfortable lifting weights
without men present, simply because
they're "embarrassed that they can only
lift a 20-pound or 10-pound weight when,
there are guys right next to them lifting
100 pounds."
"I would feel more comfortable in a
gym with only women," she said, "but it's
not because of a religious conviction,
and I think many women share this sentiment regardless of religious background and belief."
Asiaii disagreed with sentiments that
women-only gym hours reinforce the
stereotype of women as weaker and less
athletic than men, adding that the hype
surrounding the issue does not stem
from a concern that the policy is antifeminist.

"Unfortunately I feel like the big hype
that's been drawn out of this isn't really
because people are concerned about feminism," she said. "I think it comes out of
a more xenophobic attitude toward
Muslims."

Energy drink chemicals not FDA approved, under new scrutiny
TIFFANE STUCKENSCHNEIDER
THE POLY POST (CAL POLY-POMONA)
(U-WIRE)
Red Bull promises to "give you wings,"
Rockstar encourages you to "party like a rockstar" and
Monster tells you to "unleash the beast."

The Food and Drug Administration, health experts and
a state legislature, however, are scrutinizing energy drink
advertisements for not informing consumers of risky stimulants, according to Boston University's The Daily Free
Press.

Stimulants found in energy drinks such as guarana and
synephrine, alternatives to FDA-banned ephedra, do not
require FDA approval.

"Some people, especially the
infrequent caffeine user or the
caffeine-tolerant, can exhibit a
variety of ill consquences."
Carla Jackson
Health Educator, California
Polytechnical Institute Pomona

Nick Spagnola, a third-year political science student
whose drink of choice is Red Bull.
"I don't know what long-term effects those drinks will
have."
Last April, the FDA tightened its regulations when
Redux Beverages began pushing a product called Cocaine
Energy Drink.
While it did not contain any illegal substances, it's slogan as the "legal alternative" and references to retailers as
"dealers" violated FDA guidelines about marketing and
false or misleading labels.
Redux voluntarily recalled the product but has since rereleased the same formula under the changed name
Censored. The newest product creating a buzz is simply
labeled Blow.
Consumers are supposed to add Blow to a drink of their
choice, creating an instant energy boost.
Using the street name for cocaine, this powdery substance is sold in vials and as of now, can only be found
online.
In 2006, teens and young adults spent almost $3.5 billion
on energy drinks, up 75 percent from the year prior.
With a target demographic of people 30 and under, taking specific aim at college students, the energy drink

industry is ever-popular and continuing to expand.

The average energy drink contains as much caffeine as
one 8-ounce cup of plain coffee. Over-consumption of caffeine can have negative effects, even in regular users.
"Part of the problem stems from the use of energy
drinks that often contain large amounts of caffeine but are
not required to label caffeine content," said Carla Jackson,
a health educator at Student Health Services. "Because
students may be unaware that these energy drinks contain

minors should not be allowed to purchase energy drinks.
"My parents always said cigarettes weren't a big deal 20
years ago. Then everyone started getting cancer," said

caffeine, they may use them on top of their current caffeine intake patterns."
While not listed on the packaging, Monster contains
160 milligrams of caffeine. Soße No Fear comes in second
with 158 milligrams, and Full Throttle rounds out the top
three at 144 milligrams.
At first glance, Red Bull seems mild with its 80 milligrams, but its serving size is 8.5 ounces as opposed to
the others' 16 ounces. In a 16-ounce serving, Red Bull's
caffeine level is similar to the other drinks.
"Even the most seasoned caffeine user can use too
much, termed caffeine intoxication," said Jackson.
Symptoms of caffeine intoxication include restless-

ness, nervousness, insomnia, flushed face, excessive urination, diarrhea, twitching and irregular heartbeat.
"Most people don't have any negative consequences
from their caffeine habits, especially if they tolerate caffeine well and consume in moderation, usually defined
as two to three cups of brewed coffee per day no more
than 300 milligrams of caffeine," said Jackson. "But some
people, especially the infrequent caffeine user or the less
caffeine-tolerant, can exhibit a variety of ill consequences."
Many students have admitted to experiencing some of
these symptoms as a result of caffeine use.
"I get really hyper, and then I totally crash," said second-year management and human resources student
Alissa Benavidez, who prefers Red Bull and Rockstar.
Jen Shader, a first-year liberal studies student, said
she stopped consuming energy drinks because she felt ill
after combining Red Bull and Monster.
"My heart started racing," said Shader. "Afterwards I
got really, really tired."

"It's only an acquittal that triggers

"There are all kinds of reasons" that

Philadelphia criminal defense attorney
Patrick Artur, from legal precedent if

made among judges and attorneys to a
defendant's wish for a case to be resolved.
However, "just telling the prosecutor
to dismiss [because Malinovskaya has
already been mistried three times] without citing case law seems like a poor
argument," Artur added.
Malinovskaya's case has taken abrupt
turns lately.
A change-of-venue request to move the

granted in mid-February due to the level
of publicity surrounding the case, but
was withdrawn by the defense in early

The Swarthmore African Student Association's annual Africa Week will begin in earnest this Thursday afternoon with a whirlwind Sharpies takeover featuring the
traditionalfoods of the African Diaspora. In addition to
offering delicious meals, Africa Week will offer
Swarthmore students a chance to celebrate and explore
many aspects of African culture.-

The overall goal of Africa Week is twofold. With

events such as an African fashion show on Friday night,
Swarthmore's African students are encouraged to celebrate their culture. "Showcasing African music, dance
and fashion are a few of the ways that Africans can show
their pride," SASA vice president Ama Tettey-Fio 'lO

said.
However, the week is also intended to expose the
Swarthmore campus to the nuances of African cultural
issues. Although this past Tuesday's lecture was canceled, an exhibit in Shane Lounge discussing the science
of African Wars in addition to a presentation from

STAND will provide students will ample opportunity to
discuss contemporary African issues. "We hope to reach
many different people interested in learning more about
Africa in as many ways as possible," Tettey-Fio said.
Its cultural objectives aside, Africa Week is supposed
to be fun. "The purpose ofthe week... is really to havefun
with our cultures and to invite others to share that with
us," SASA president Nabta Idries 10 said. Idries hopes
that Africa Week will help the Swarthmore community at
large see that SASA is "an exciting group on campus."
With everything from dance performances to catered dinners, SASA's Africa Week is sure to succeed.

ANNA ZALOKOSTAS

Notes from the
Underground

EP,

"Water Curses,"
is just as fluid,
poignant, seductive and sopping
wet as its title
suggests.

Flowing through
20 minutes of
tightly tangled,
intertwining
songs,

"Water

Curses" trickles
and drips through
your fingers without being caught, runs smoothly and sinuously without solidifying into something concrete and
tangibly, gracefully leaks through itself while remaining
amorphously plastic and ungraspable. Quieter and more
stripped down than "Strawberry Jam," "Water Curses" is

more similar to the winding, multi-layered, piled-on style
of "Feels" even though the first three of its four tracks
were recorded during the band's Strawberry Jam sessions
in January of 2007.

"Water Curses" is just as fluid,
poignant seductive and sopping wet
as its title suggests.
Beginning with swelling tinkering, fast-paced whirls
and rushing, luxurious undulations of noise, the first song
and highlight of the EP, "Water Curses," is beautifully cataclysmic in its swooshes, scratches and reverberations, in
the flitters of dancing sunlight that are reflected off the
rippling ribbons of liquid water. As "Water Curses" airily
percolates into "Street Flash," the second track of the
album starts off slower as it drones and drifts through
beeps and bleeps, bubbling up on the surface before puncturing and rattling off into a colliding, electronic dissonance of static sound. By the end of the song, "Street
Flash" returns to a buzzing murmur that fades into a
choppy, staccato trickle that meticulously flows into the
next track, "Cobwebs."
"Cobwebs" is eerily haunting and languid with its dripping, resounding rhythm, ethereal whirs, accented surges
of swollen cries and space sounds of swooshing rockets,
shooting stars and falling, crashing planes. The soft pattering that ends the song so seamlessly transitions into

one of the best songs on the EP, the last track "Seal

Eyeing," that the ending of the former and beginning of
the later are hardly distinguishable; "Seal Eyeing" starts
off with the floaty fluttering of a keyboard, the soft hum of
whispered vocals, the chirping note of the songbirds in
April 3, 2008

the spring sun and the gurgle of a babbling stream in
celestial space.
The album as a whole functions to create an experience
that is ethereal and otherworldly, submerged underwater
in the clear, cool, twinkling blueness of liquid where proportions are distorted, colors blurred, where light
bounces back, sound echoes and everything slips away so
that once you resurface, all that you're left with is what
seemed so real in your own imagination.
Although "Water Curses" is not actually set to be
released until May of 2008, any Animal Collective fan with
Internet access has probably, by now, downloaded the
leaked version of the EP that appeared online about two
weeks ago. Though many would argue that downloading
the EP before its official release date is both misguided
and wrong for a number of semi-valid reasons the illegality of Internet music downloads, the potentially lost
profit and lower album sales, the seemingly demonstrated
disrespect for the band's desires
downloading and listening to "Water Curses," or to any other leaked album, is
not nearly as detrimental to the band as it is made out to
be. The portion of the profit that comes from album sales
that the band actually receives is, in reality, quite small.
So while your intention in buying the album may be to
support the band, you are ultimately very much more supporting the record label. Though supporting independent
labels is important, necessary and should be encouraged,
most bands big enough to make albums that leak are probably releasing their music on record labels that are similarly big enough to function without some extra fancy

cars.

While the digital pre-release of "In Rainbows" got quite
a few people worried that Radiohead would see declining
sales when the actual album was released, in reality "In
Rainbows" sold very well, with 122,000 copies bought in
the United States alone during its first week of official
release, demonstrating that music available for download
in advance can still yield extremely profitable sales.
Although it is estimated that one third of people who
downloaded the album paid nothing, that is, in the context
of Radiohead's idol-worship status, not terribly surprising
or substantial of number; I have the feeling that that fraction would be more or less the same regardless of whether
or not the album had been available early for download. In
the end, big bands like Radiohead and Animal Collective
have fans that are dedicated and dogmatic enough to
insist on buying the actual album, fans that start foaming
at the mouth at the idea of soon holding the officially
released CD, complete with album art, liner notes and
packaging in their very own hands. Just because people
download the music in advance hardly means that they
will not, especially in the case of Animal Collective's cultlike following, buy it later on.
Besides, with music that is as expertly crafted as
Animal Collective's, it is much better to hear a full-length
album or an EP in its entirety, from start to finish, the
way it was mean to be heard, than to hear arbitrary singles out of place and out of context
all the more reason
to preemptively download and listen to "Water Curses"
now if you haven't already, before you start hearing middle 30 seconds interludes of "Street Flash" chiming from
that room across the bathroom.

As if every 6-year-old in America didn't already know,
Hollywood has finally come back around to the notion

that animation is the natural cinematic medium for the
classics of Dr. Seuss. "Horton Hears a Who," a delightfully nutty romp, is such a vast improvement over the liveaction adaptations of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"
and "The Cat and the Hat" that it will hopefully put those
mangy giant furry suits out of their misery for good.
If only Hollywood had completed the revolution away
from the horrors of Michael Myers, 12 feet tall, on the big
screen, in a cat-suit (can... scrub and... scrub and yet
never be clean) and made "Horton Hears a Who"
into a television special along the lines of the 1966 adaptation of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas." (You know
the one: "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch ...") Because
while an elephant's quest to save a microscopic world
perched on the bud of a clover is thrilling for 45 to 60 minutes, it's a little thin in the gripping-material department
as far as a full-length feature film goes.
But why dwell on the negative when directors Jimmy
Hayward and Steve Martino packed so much to appreciate into such a tiny plot synopsis? Animation studios, it
seems, have at last outgrown their need to throw all of
their energy into the minutely detailed rendering of each

Entertainment is top priority for the team behind
"Horton Hears a Who." (And yes, some of that entertainment is to be found in prancing elephant butts.) As
Horton (voice of Jim Carrey) embarks on his quest to find
a safe home for the miniscule world of Whoville (represented to Horton by the Mayor of Whoville, voiced by
Steve Carell), he encounters the usual obstacles an elephant finds on a journey through the world's least ecologically-correct jungle. Rambunctious monkeys, evil vultures and prissy kangaroos vie with rickety bridges and
elephantine ADD to foul his quest.

trend of using animation to breath new life into the lost
art of slapstick. Freed by the creative anatomy of a
Seussian world, in which naturalism is hardly a requirement, the animators outdo themselves in feeding the
audience a constant stream of silly, over-the-top physical
comedy. It's the kind of humor that never translates well
when an intrepid reviewer attempts to describe it usefully
just trust me when I say that an elephant's attempt
to cross a rope-bridge is funny. "Horton Hears a Who"
doesn't have quite the classic screwball sophistication of
"Ratatouille," but with its jaunty confidence and breezy
absurdism, it has a better comic eye than every previous
Pixar comedy combined. (And from 20th Century Fox, no
less! Oh, how the tables have turned.)

And antics are what "Horton Hears a Who" mainly

Carrey and Carell, an alliterative-minded
marketer's dream, are both as goofy and highspirited as you would expect. Carrey is better as
the elephant than he is in live-action, though it's
entirely possible that a live-action elephant could outfunny Carrey by mere virtue of eating straw with its
nose. However, though more than serviceable, neither
actor provides the kind of revelatory performances Eddie
Murphy gave in "Shrek" or Robin Williams in "Aladdin."

Every now and then, the directors and writers (Ken

sort of amusing in themselves, come across as trying too
hard in the scope of the film. The other (thankfully) few

It was sometime after dinner on Saturday
night, and I was flopping about my room to
the raspy crooning of Lil Wayne on his new
single "Lollipop," getting inspired for the

Party. I wasn't looking forward to witnessing the masses of drunks rubbing their bits
all up on each other. What I was looking forward to was the moment when I could play
dress-up with Mickey and Dwight. For
Mickey, I picked a leopard-print, jersey-knit

of the dress was so stretchy and the skirt
would bounce around when he moved.
In the mid-1800s, Amelia Bloomer made
popular the first pants for women, eponymously dubbed Bloomers, because she felt
that', "the costume of women should be suited to her wants and necessities. It should
conduce at once to her health, comfort, and
usefulness; and, while it should not fail also
to conduce to her personal adornment, it
should make that end of secondary impor-

tance."

But in this post-feminist age, skirts don't
need to be loaded with patriarchal symbolism. Not only is it our choice to wear them,
but in a waay, we can see them as giving
women, and at least on one crazy night
every year at Swarthmore, men as well,
enough mobility to do as you please. My
freshman year, on the way to the Sager
party, a guy friend suddenly had to pee. So
he walked up to a tree, lifted his skirt and
relieved himself. So convenient! But highly
uncivilized! In the end, though, that's what
the Sager party inevitably becomes, for better or for worse. And on this night, boys can
experience the freedom of wearing a skirt. In
the unrefined words of wisdom from the
Geto Boys: "You better come prepared/

Last Sunday, the Lang Concert Hall was completely silent as violinist Serena Le 'OB entered
the stage in an ebony dress with a vibrant fuchsia train for the start of her Senior Honors
Recital. Little did anyone know, Le's younger
brother, Bonaire Le, also a violinist, had handsewn the train onto the dress himself only several hours before. The last minute addition defined
that night; like the brilliant splash ofcolor on her
black dress, Le's inspired violin-playing filled the

hall with vivacity.
Le never intended to pursue music academically at Swarthmore College, but when she auditioned her freshman year for the Swarthmore
Orchestra, the conductor at the time, Daniel
Wachs, seated her as Concertmistress of the

orchestra. She described the responsibility as
"very intimidating" as she led a large group of
older musicians. Le also performed as the first
violinist of a string quartet and received full
scholarship as a Garrigues scholar for private
lessons.
At the same time, Associate Professor of
Music Tom Whitman encouraged Le to study
music theory in order to better understand the
music she performed. After initially struggling
with music theory, Le embraced it when she discovered "there was greater complexity to the
music than I had ever thought about."
Le credits her will to accept challenges for
propelling her throughout her musical career.
When Le was only six years old, she recounts
that she "begged to learn the violin because
somebody told [her] that it was the hardest
instrument." She took this difficult challenge,
and after the guidance of a loving teacher, transformed the challenge into a passion and love.
As a first year at Swarthmore College, Le
found support and inspiration in the music
department. She started to take lessons with
Barbara Govatos, a first violinist for the
Philadelphia Orchestra, during which she rediscovered the depth and intricacy of previously
learned pieces. Her newly found knowledge of
music theory added to the experience. "A lot of
the pieces of music that I dismissed as a child
gained so many layers I had never seen before.
Tom Whitman was right."
Le's commitment to holding herself to a level
of performance in all aspects of her life brought
her to the realization that "it was easy to forget
you inhabit a body vulnerable to strain and use."
At the end of the first semester of what was supposed to be her senior year, she was involved in
her directed creative writing project, her semi-

nar, honors recital practice and composing the
piano part of her violin and piano sonata.
Le soon developed tendonitis, a painful

inflammation of the tendons that immohilized
first her left hand and then her right. Avoiding
wrist movement put strain on other parts of her
body and her condition "spiraled." That spring
semester, Le had to "pull out of a lot of obligations, which was emotionally damaging," she
said. "I had to face the fact that even though my
mind was prepared to do a lot of things my body
wasn't [able] to carry it out."
Le was faced with the dilemma to either graduate as a course English major in 2007 or to postpone graduation to fulfill her honors requirements. "I ultimately decided that playing my
recital was important to my identity at
Swarthmore and important to my identity as a

musician," Le said. She finished her English
major and delayed graduation in the hopes that
her body would eventually heal soon enough to
play a recital the following school year.
After about a year in recovery, Le began the
struggle of "re-approaching, re-learning and
reassessing" her instrument and her technique
with Govatos, her violin. At first, Le could only
practice a halfhour a day, which slowly grew to
an hour a day. Eventually, Le decided she would
be able to give a recital after she cut part of the
planned program.
Although Le originally intended to play some

more obscure works that would "shock and disturb to a certain extent," she ultimately decided
on still underplayed but more tonal pieces so as
not to alienate the audience. Three composers in
her repertoire were Prokofiev, Janacek and
Bartok, who all "moved away from conventional
harmony in various directions."
One composer that has gone unmentioned is
Le, herself. Le took her first music composition
course with Gerald Levinson her junior year.
Since Le was hooked on creative writing, she
wanted to do the same with music. Le looked to
the composers Bartok and Janacek who incorporated folk songs into their works. "Because of the
upheaval [in their time], they were looking for
something simpler and more at the core of their
national and cultural selves," Le explained.
Le adopted this idea by incorporating a
Vietnamese folk song into her original composition. "Both my parents raised me as an American
without cultural ties because they didn't want me
to feel like I had to account for a past and cultural ties that I didn't understand,", said Le, who is

Vietnamese-American, "[but] there are elements
of their past, despite their best efforts, [that] have

seeped into my understanding of the world."
The Vietnamese melody was from sheet
music Le's father had brought with him from
Vietnam that he would ask Le to play throughout
her childhood. "I thought about using it [the composition] as a bridge ... between what I perceived
to be a separate individual self and what is an
idea that is tied to my parents' past that I can't
fathom." For Le, the piece allowed her to "reconcile a wild and unruly nature with a simpler constant."
Le is a musician known for being her own
toughest critic but she believes that while "technically speaking, the recital was far from perfect
I would say the recital was emotionally per...

fect."

"I always said I would view the recital as a
gift, with gratitude. Leading into the recital, I
wasn't sure if I could retain that positivity in the
face of nerves. For whatever reason, I was able to
and was thoroughly happy to be playing," Le

said.

Not only did Le's technical skill at the recital
leave the audience impressed, but they were
moved to see how Le's intelligent spirit and vivaciousness resonated in every note she played. For
those who knew Le's history of hardships, the
pieces were all the more touching. Le's original
composition was the most touching piece to hear
as the lovingly played Vietnamese melody seeped

through the concert hall.

JULIAN CHENDER

The Spiritual Scene
When I walked from my room on
the west side of Parrish to brunch on
Easter Sunday I saw the Easter chalkings that had sprung up in the early
morning hours. "Bunnies are cool,

but Jesus is cooler,"

one said.

Another wished passers-by "Happy
Easter" and a third declared, "Peace
be with you." While I found these to
be relatively benign, I took issue with
some of the other chalkings, especial-

ly the large colorful one that spanned
the breadth of the overhang behind

Parrish: "Ultimate sacrifice becomes
ultimate victory."

Religious belief
becomes a problem
when people turn it
public and it becomes
proselytizing...
The chalkings reminded me of
comedian George Carlin's addition to
the Ten Commandments: "Thou shalt
keep thy religion to thyself!" For me,
and for many others with whom I
spoke regarding the chalkings, religion is something very personal. I
have no problem with people believing that Jesus died for our sins and
that people can achieve salvation
through Jesus Christ alone, or that,
as the Frisbeetarians believe, when
you die, "your soul gets flung onto a
roof, and just stays there." Religious
belief becomes a problem when people turn it public and itbecomes proselytizing or, even worse, serves as the
basis for political policies, wars, etc.
In talking with some of the chalkers, I have come to understand that
the chalkings arose not from a desire
to proselytize but from the wish to
express joy. Even though the chalkings grew out of the need for selfexpression, I found them to be alienating. In religious expression, there
exists a fine line between expressing
happiness in what you believe and
knocking
what someone else
believes. This is a result of the funda-

mentalist and exclusive nature of
many religions, and their one-way-tosalvation beliefs. Such beliefs suggest
that those who do not agree will not
achieve salvation, enlightenment,
etc. Though the only chalking that
explicitly suggested this was the
"Ultimate sacrifice becomes ultimate

victory" (only Christians can share
in Jesus' sacrifice and therefore
achieve "ultimate" victory), I still
found the chalkings alienating and
aggressive.
It occurred to me while talking
with some of the chalkers that I
would not have had such an intense
reaction to chalkings from smaller
religions. Chalkings, as a form of selfexpression, mostly come from minority groups whose channels for selfexpression and representation fallfar
short of those available to Christians.
As a result, I find it easier to take
aggressive chalkings from underrepresented minority groups in stride.
Christians account for 76.5 percent of
people in the United States, while
Nonreligious/ Secular makes up 13.2
percent, followed by Judaism at L 3

percent. Islam and Buddhism tie for
fourth place at 0.5 percent. I understand that the demographics at
Swarthmore differ from those of the
United States as a whole. Coming
from the U.S., however, and personally lying somewhere in between the
0.5 percent and the 13 percent, I
found that some of the chalkings
evoked a sense of the extreme majority flaunting its position. I understand very well that this was not the
intention.
However, Chris Green 'O9 and
Cecelia Osowski 'lO explained that
some Christians find it difficult to be
Christian on campus. Osowski
explained that when she was chalking, "I wasn't doing it to make a political statement per se, but there was

some sense that there are Christians
on this campus [that] feel really isolated and it's nice to let them know
that there are others out here cele-

brating."

Green later mentioned that, "The

chalkings for me is about something
which I feel isn't expressed much
other times [at Swarthmore]."
While I couldn't find the religious

break up in percentages of the campus, I understand that the demography at Swarthmore differs from the
United States as a whole. For
instance, I would guess that
Christians fall below the 76.5 percent,
while the other groups I mentioned
spike to varying degrees. While
Christians do not garner the same
numbers here as they do in the rest of
the U.S., I am confident that they constitute the dominant religion at
Swarthmore. After all, two-thirds of

the religious advisors are Christian.

It occurred to me
that I would not have
had such an intense
reaction to chalkings
from smaller religions.
...

That being said, though I personally did not like the chalkings, the
people who created them had every
right to do so. Their joy and the
desire to share that with the campus
motivated them to do the chalkings,
and there certainly isn't anything
wrong with that.

Food for thought: Sharples etiquette 101, continued
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Sharpies
truly is an
etiquette
nightmare.
We thought

we'd
covered most of
the major
issues

last

time,

but

then we had

several conversations
that started,
"I liked your

MAIRIN ODLE

column this
week,
but
you forgot to

talk about. .
This is

."

noteworthy
for two rea-

sons.
First,
our friends
were being extremely polite when they chose to preface
their criticism with a compliment. Second, they were
right. We missed a lot.
Most of what we missed has to do with serving food.
We have noticed what seems to be a campus-wide quest
for Best Taco Ever. We know that some segments of the
population are trying desperately to achieve BTE
because we're often stuck behind them in the taco bar
line, and other than a BTE obsession, there is no explanation for the care and deliberation that they devote to
assembling their meal. To those of us who don't "get" the
whole BTE thing, this is obnoxious; we just want to get
our food and go sit down. We would also like to point out
that if it is possible to create BTE, it will probably be better accomplished by someone who is sitting down at a
table, has space to work in and can insert materials into
the shell in the order they choose rather than the order
in which they appear in line. The same goes for falafel,
sandwiches or anything requiring construction. So if the
sight of a messy taco really does make you shudder, we

suggest you use your time in line to obtain the materials
and leave putting them together for later.
That said, getting food is not now, nor should it ever
be, a race. If you were in that much of a hurry, you would
have gotten a bag lunch. There is no excuse for failing to

bring your plate to the food; Sharpies made it publicly
known that they would like students to do this, and we've
all seen bacon bits mixed in with the raisins enough
times to know that there can be some pretty horrible consequences for sloppiness. There is also no reason to not
make eye contact with, and say "please" and "thank you"
to the people serving the food and the card swipers. It's
common courtesy, really easy and doesn't take any extra

time.
Whether you eat in the dining hall, a fancy restaurant
or hunt your own deer in the Crum, waiting is going to
be a part of your dining experience. Waiting is best done
patiently. The worker refilling a container at salad bar
is not trying to ruin your day. They are, in fact, trying to
feed you. Rolling your eyes, reaching around them and
tapping your foot impatiently are all incredibly rude and
serve no purpose. If it feels awkward to stand there, go
get a drink or something and come back later. Don't look
a gift container of mandarin oranges in the mouth.
Similarly, the coffee and tea machines, while brewing,
are not trying to cause you mental anguish. Taking out
the pot of coffee or tea while the machine is running
causes coffee or tea to fall directly onto the hot plate,
where it burns and smells bad. We don't know why people do this when already-brewed beverages are right
there, but they do, and it's not OK.
We use lines to make sure that everyone has to wait
an equal amount of time, or at least that's what Molly's
hippie elementary school told her. The salad bar line can
be a little tricky because it isn't a line so much as a circle, but there are still basic rules to ensure approximate
fairness. The line goes counter clockwise (or spins down
for physicists). Please don't stop and tell your epic Sager
story right in front of the refried beans. You must keep
moving or depart the salad bar area. There is also no cutting in at the ends unless the line is virtually empty
the general consensus among a random sample of our
friends is that you have to start near the soup or chili
containers (or oatmeal and maple syrup, for you break-

fast types).

For longer lines, conversation is acceptable so long as
no serving is taking place in that part of the line. So is
eavesdropping
you've got to entertain yourself somehow, and rumors need a mechanism for spreading.
Participating in the conversations of random strangers,
however, is a little too friendly. The only exceptions are
if the others are saying something so banal that anyone
can relate (e.g. "Pasta bar line is sooo long") or if they
are asking a question that you happen to know the
answer to (e.g. "What time does Pub Nite start?").
Once it's finally time to sit down, please respect others' personal space. We know that it gets crowded at
lunch, but if you and your eight best friends surround
someone eating alone and then talk over and around this
person, you will probably make them feel like a weird
loser. And none of us need any more of that feeling,
okay? This especially applies to the four-person booths.
If one person is eating there, sorry, but three strangers
may not also sit there and pretend this person does not
exist. The awkwardness of this situation is causing our
hearts to race just thinking about it.
Don't put your feet on the table. Is that so hard? (We
saw you).
Speaking of things that should go without saying but
apparently don't, all the general rules of table manners
still apply even though our parents aren't here to enforce
them. No one wants to see you chewing with your mouth
open, hunched over your plate, or eating your ravioli as
if it were a popsicle. More importantly, there are photos
above the tray drop off to show you correct (napkin,
apple core, banana peel thrown away and silverware off
to the side) and incorrect (stuff all over everywhere)
ways to put your tray on the conveyor belt. We don't

think that's too much to ask. Conversations consisting of
more than brief greetings in the tray drop-off area are
also a no-no. And by greetings, we don't mean the second
installment of your epic Sager story.
Despite our best efforts, we have probably missed
plenty this week as well. At the same time, however lacking this column may be, we still think it isn't missing as
much as my hash browns were this Sunday: whoever has
the salt shakers in their room needs to bring them back.
Immediately.

Yoga symposium calls together practitioners, flexes body and mind
BY SUNNY COWELL
scowelll@swarthmore.edu
Have you ever wondered how yoga practice could benefit you in ordinary life situations? Well, you would have found the
answers at this week's Yoga Symposium,

which enabled Swarthmore students, faculty and residents to learn about the significance of yoga from the some of the best practitioners and theorists in the field.
The Symposium, called "Practice in
Body, Mind and Spirit," took place this past
Saturday in Swarthmore's Troy Dance Lab
in LPAC. Sponsored by the William J.
Cooper Foundation and the Departments of
Music and Dance, the symposium presented
a range of discussions and performances on
yoga and the body.
One of the most well attended and prominent events of the symposium was a talk
called "Contemplating the Role of Gravity
in Yoga." Irene Dowd, a renowned
anatomist from the Julliard School, was
scheduled to speak, but at the last moment
could not make it. Instead, her assistant
Sarah Plumer gave the talk. Plumer began
her discussion by pointing out that the muscular skeletal system and breathing is greatly affected by our relation to gravity. "We
can conserve our energy by knowing how
much effort should be exerted through each
body part," Plumer said. She distinguished
between different kinds of muscle contractions and lengthening contractions that all
have an effect on how we make simple gestures with our bodies.
Plumer went on to talk about the relaTHE PHOENIX

tionship between the spine and shoulder
gurdle, using a student demonstrator and a
model skeleton to further illustrate her
points. She showed the audience how the
spine and scapula allow a tremendous
amount of movement in humans, movement
that we usually take for granted. Plumer

also addressed how the eccentric muscles
and abdominals aid our breathing. Overall,
Plumer emphasized that we want to minimize how much of our muscles we are using
in order to prevent injury or strain.
After a lunch break, "An Offering of
Anusthana (devoted practice) for Our
Beloved Teacher Sri. B.K.S. Iyengar in this,
his 90th Year" was performed by distinguished yoga practitioners Lara Warren,

Carrie Owerko and Michelle Laßue. The

first of the performance's five movments,
"Invocation," began with the dimming of
the studio lights as the three dancers

emerged in black leotards. In this movement, they did downward dog poses,

stretched their arms forward and backward
while keeping their backs straight.
Accompanied by music, they lifted their
legs in the air, performed controlled flips,
fluid movements and even put their legs

behind their heads.
"I really see how it builds upon what we
did in class. The control that they have and
the connection they have with their bodies
is amazing." Hadley Roach 'll said. "It was
amazing not only what they were doing
but how they sustained it for such a long
time," Camille Rogine 'll added.
The music that accompanied the movements sounded surprisingly contemporary,

characterized by elements of Indian fusion
with a reggae beat. The poses were so
incredible and difficult that they resembled
those of body contortionists. "It was interesting seeing the poses that I do in class and
seeing how I can improve, but also seeing
the beauty and strength necessary to do
these poses," Erin Floyd 'lO said.
The Yoga Symposium concluded with a
reception for all presenters and participants
in the LPAC downstairs lobby. "The teachers and the theorists are also practitioners.
They always reflect on the text and it is a
commitment to all aspects of the form of

yoga," Assistant Professor of Dance Sally
Hess said, referring to the presenters of the
symposium. Hess also expressed to that she
has gained tremendous happiness through
exchanging the body, mind and spirit of
yoga with other people.
"In my life, I know that a consistent yoga
practice supports my physical health and
strength," Dance Professor Sharon Friedler
said. "Additionally, it connects me to a community of like-minded people who are, for
the most part, living in a nonviolent and
respectful way, something I strive for as
well."

"See my breasts, they're the best,
in a low-cut tie and dress" sang Ambar
La Forgia 'll, opening up Spike's
standup comedy night last Friday
with a hilarious version of Beauty and
Beast's classic song "Be Our Guest" as
crowds filtered into SCI 101 and filled
the room with reverberating laughter.
For an hour and a half, a line up of
ten student comedians filled the room
with unrehearsed jokes about everything from politics and hernias to rape
and sucking one's own penis. It was
this unfettered diversity that made
Spike's show so unique. "Instead of
auditioning and rehearsing
we basically asked anyone interested to show
up and be funny," said Spike member
Peter Liebenson 'IL "That's why our
show is a bit more raw and welcoming
of individual comedic voices."
On a campus where many events
aim for political correctness, Spike's
show very consciously did not and
perpetually tested the line between the
offensive and the hilarious. "I railed
against... the general PC nature of the
school with the most offensive material I could come up with," Liebenson
'said, a sentiment seemingly shared by
several of the performers.
The show itself went off without a
hitch: La Forgia's rendition of the
Disney song began the evening, drawing laughter from its audience after
every witty line. "[I took] everything
anyone has said to me in a vulgar
manner and turn[ed] it into something
that was hopefully cute and funny," La
Forgia said. After La Forgia's act, Jon
Peters 'O9 shared with the audience
his new philosophy of setting reasonable goals for himself, like resolving to
forget to floss.
Liebenson followed Peters, spitting
out jokes that were not even remotely
political correct as he made fun of
everyone from his roommate to foreign students and even deaf actresses
and laughed at how sexual harassment by old men is more cute than
creepy: "Man, I can't wait!" joked

"[I took] everything
anone has said to me in
a vulgar manner and
turn[ed] it into something cute and funny."

"At first, I was afraid I was only
going to be telling jokes about sex and
poop, and then I realized I was from
Montana," Brendan Work 'lO said,
after Liebenson's act. His hilarious

performance began with his declaration that "boobs are a social construct" and often poked fun at his
hometown. He insisted that, contrary
to common belief, "[Montana does]
have skyscrapers," but then immediately acknowledged that they "also
have a very low sky."

Daniel Hodson was among the acts in

Friday's Spike standup comedy night.

Swarthmore from the perspective of a
short New Yorker, Singer called the
campus a "tree zoo" and went on to
lament about the lack of anything
resembling vegetation in the city. "We
do have Central Park, but it's manmade," Singer said, insisting that
Swarthmore's plant life is a foreign
world for students from the city and
grumbling that "every spring morning
is a Monday in disguise."
Nicco Moretti 'lO took the spotlight
after Singer, making some of the best
received jokes of the night as he
mocked the inadequacies of the lives
of those arrested for conspiracy to
commit mail fraud: "They didn't even
get away with it!" Moretti exclaimed
to a booming audience. Stephen Graf
'O9, the next comedian, took a unique
approach by assuming the persona of
Leonard Bright, a 34 year-old man who
was speaking about his life to the audience at the recommendation of a psychiatrist. Grafs performance, perhaps
because it was so different from the
comedy of the other students, was
greeted with appreciative laughter
and supportive cheers from a crowd
who hardly found it difficult to laugh
at the pathetic personality that Graf
put forth.
After Graf, Alex Ginsberg 'OB
shared with the audience his mother's
advice about penis enlargement (the
key, apparently, is to eat lots of mushrooms: "Mario eats mushrooms to get

"I am very PC, so I struggled with
the rape jokes and Jew jokes, [but the
show was] otherwise funny," Jane
Abell 'll said. Still, the stand-up comedy had a great range of humor, from
the cute and funny to the borderline
offensive or hilarious. "We had a great
line-up of comics with really diverse
performance styles and points of view.
The show was a lot of fun and I'm
excited to organize more stand-up

Students document a Screw to remember
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS
azalokol@swarthmore.edu

You came, you saw. If you participated, you were
humiliated. If you didn't, you laughed and realized why
you refused to agree to this in the first place. And three
students, Tally Sharma 'O9, Melaine Spaulding 'O9 and
Sean Nesselrode 'O9, caught it all on tape for you to
pause, rewind, watch and re-watch. Your shining
moments of Sharpies glory as you tried to wobble
through the serving area, convinced that the dining staff
intentionally stocked the menu with five different types
of beans served in four different ways just for the occasion will now live on forever in documentary form with
"I Want My Bam Bam: The Search for Love, Screw 2008."
Featuring quirky costumes, disappointed dates, awkward nervousness, amused bystanders, newly formed
friendships and frustrated rejection, "I Want my Bam
Bam" is short, funny, engaging and perhaps a little too
though the crowd that the movie drew was
familiar
small, there was hardly a moment when the room wasn't
echoing with knowing, truth-affirming laughter.
Sharma, Spaulding and Nesselrode manage to recreate the timeline of Screw, capture the chaotic shuffling,

restless energy, hilarious embarrassment and humiliating familiarity of the event as they tell the collective

story of a night that is inevitably compromising for us
all. From ditched dates to unfashionably late arrivals,
obscure and unseemly costumes to name-calling and the
realization that you don't actually share as much in common with your Screw date as your roommates may have
believed, "I Want My Bam Bam" is sure to resonate with
at least some aspect of every Swarthmore student's
Screw experience, from the enthusiastic participant to
the teasing bystander.

"We initially thought we should
make a mockumentary, but we
figured that Screw lends itself to
mockery so easily that the project
became more of a documentary."
Melaine Spaulding 'O9
Piecing together individual stories to create a holistic
retelling of the night while focusing on and following a
couple of students as they progress through their dates,

the documentary truly captures the spirit, terror and
incredible awkwardness of Screw.
Although "I Want My Bam Bam" was thought up on a
half-joking, half-serious whim, it turned into a movie
that, despite its constant flow of laughter, is a surprisingly well put together account of the Screw experience.
"Tally, Shaun and I were just talking one day and
thought it would be fun to get a camera and film some of
the more absurd moments of Screw. We initially thought
we should make a mockumentary, but we figured that
Screw lends itself to mockery so easily that the project
became more of a documentary," Spaulding said.
"Screw is such a surreal experience that we wanted to
capture it on film and really get a wide variety of perspectives from people both participating and spectating,"
Nesselrode added. "You can't do justice to Screw in

Miao tells the 'Truth' about exiled Chinese journalist
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

80-year-old Liu Binyan lounges about in
his nondescript house in bland East
Windsor, New Jersey. He picks up the New
York Times, takes out scissors and begins
cutting, explaining that making newspaper
clippings is the first task of his morning
routine. He's been diagnosed with colon
cancer and explains that he is doing less
work and seeing fewer friends because of
his health. He shows us his study, covered
from ceiling to floor in books
Dostoyevsky's "The Idiot," Marx and
Engels' writings. Liu talks about his love
of reading and how so many great books so
quickly are forgotten and disappear.
The same can be said about mainland
China's modern history and Liu's own
monumental role in it. One might hardly
suspect, in such a demure setting, that Liu

Binyan was once the most prominent
Chinese journalist, no small feat in a country that has no rivals when it comes to
media censorship. Alumna Meggie Miao
'O3 came to Swarthmore this past Monday
to show her documentary "To Tell the

Truth" about the incredible life of Liu
Binyan. Among the amazing facts of Liu's
life provided by the film, Liu was kicked
out of the Communist Party twice and
finally exiled from China in 1989 during
the crackdown on the Democracy
Movement. He was only active as a journalist for nine years of his life, having
spent most of his formidable years doing
hard labor in reeducation camps. And yet
in those nine years, he managed to publish

articles in prominent publications, voicing
the injustices that could not be voiced in
such a repressive society, and leading
many to call him "the conscience of
China."
Liu's life reads like a textbook on
China's last half century with every sweeping nationalist movement usually resulting in Liu's falling out with the
Communist Party, incarceration in labor
camps, and eventual reacceptance into the
Party. Liu was among the victims of the
Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1956, where
Mao Zedong encouraged intellectuals to
voice their grievances, only to turn these
against them in a witch-hunt. Having written about corruption, Liu was personally

THE PHOENIX

criticized by Mao, banned from the Party,
labeled as a "rightist" and sent to a labor
camp. He was eventually freed, only to be
reeducated again in 1969 during the mad

social experiment of the Cultural
Revolution.
Finally, after Mao's death and Deng
Xiaoping's reform policy, Liu immediately
resumed work as a journalist. In 1979, Liu
wrote the widely read "People or
Monsters," which said, "The Communist
Party regulates everything, but does not
regulate the Communist Party." This and
1985's "A Second Kind of Loyalty" placed
Liu in a prominent spotlight in the democracy movement, causing Liu to once again
be expelled from the Communist Party. In
1988, Liu was invited to the United States to
speak at various universities, and during

his stay, the Tiananmen Massacre broke
out. Miao shows footage of Liu on ABC's
Nightline, stating "If [Deng Xiaoping and
the Communist Party] have lost their senses the first time, now they have completely

lost their humanity." Afterwards, Liu was

barred from returning to China.

"Liu Binyan should be
back in China where he
belongs."
Meggie Miao 'O3
Documentary Filmmaker
Miao deftly portrays the events ofLiu's
life through a combination of archival
footage and interviews from various
American sinologists and fellow dissident
writers. But Miao also provides a personal
angle to Liu's story, interviewing his wife,
who accompanied him to the U.S., and his
son and daughter, who remain in China.
Miao's interviews with Liu's family members impress how much was tragically lost
at the expense of Liu's journalistic
courage. Liu did not see his wife or chil-

dren through long -portions of their lives,during which time the family lived only off
of Liu's wife's income. Though many dissi-

dents were abandoned by theirfamilies for
the sake of their families' survivals, Liu's

wife and children steadfastly remained
with Liu.

Adding to the resonance of Miao's docu-

mentary is her own personal connection to
Liu as explained in her first-person voiceover narrative. As the daughter of a dissident writer, Miao left China for the U.S. in
1994 and soon after met Liu Binyan
through her mother. Miao recounts, "I did-

n't understand the unreserved reverence
all the adults had for him. I wondered, who
was he?" Eleven years later, Miao was
invited to Liu's 80th birthday celebration
and learned more about his incredible

background. Having just entered graduate
studies in photography and video, Miao
began to piece together a documentary

about Liu.
Contrary to the Party's view of Liu,
Miao's documentary shows how much
Liu's critical writing was a product of his
love for the Chinese people and his idealism for social welfare that is essentially
rooted in Marxism. Even exiled in the U.S.,

Liu worked tirelessly to cover Chinese
continuing to publish books, pubnews

April 3, 2008

lishing a journal in Hong Kong with his
wife and providing commentary on Radio
Free Asia. Still, Miao, observing Liu in a
Plainsboro library maneuvering through a
crowd of Americans, who have no idea
whom he is, asserts in her narration that

he "should be back in China where he

belongs."
Unfortunately, Liu was never able to
return to his homeland, having died on
December 5, 2005, an event that is depicted
in the documentary with Liu's wife's matter-of-fact message on Miao's answering
machine played to a shot of snow-covered
Jersey through a car.
Miao's documentary ends with a
depressing epilogue, wondering whether
or not any ofChina's new generation even
knows who Liu Binyan is. Some students
at the screening wished that the film had
looked at progress in China today, rather
than dwelling on China's past unresolved
tragedies, a sentiment that Miao responded
to by discussing her next potential project,
which wjll look at adolescent sexuality in
today's China.

This might qualify as the understatement of the year. The Bush
administration has aided the constant Israeli bait and switch

BENJAMIN BRADLOW

Clothes Line Saga
at
When I first arrived
Swarthmore, the most recent hot
political issue was by far the

Palestinian-Israeli
conflict.
According to archived Phoenix articles, 2003 had been particularly rife
with debate and perhaps too-hotheaded
confrontation between
Jewish advocates for Israel and
Palestinian students and sympathizers with the Palestinian cause.
These days, it is rare to see anything
about the issue on campus, especially as students mobilize for the
Democratic primary campaign consuming Pennsylvania.

Accepting its increasing irrelevance in the face of the attention
paid to the electoral campaign, the
Bush Administration has decided to
make one last push in Israel and the
Palestinian territories. They must
know that a time-tested way to make
waves in such a climate is this go-to
lame duck foreign policy issue. In
doing so, the administration will
continue a dynamic that has long

affected the national political dialogue concerning the region. In the
current presidential campaign, we'll
continue to hear the same slogans
coming from both political parties:
"we will not negotiate with terrorists," "security comes first," "respect
Israel's right to exist." These are the
same things we've heard from the
Bush Administration for the last
eight years.

But

even

as

John

McCain,

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
sing the same old tune, the Bush
Administration is seeing that this
empty sloganeering butts up against
a different reality. While from afar,
the administration has refused to
negotiate with Hamas in Gaza, now

that Condoleeza Rice and Dick
Cheney are actually on the ground
they see there is no choice but to do
just that. On Sunday, Rice was quoted in the New York Times recognizing her administration's ineptitude
in its approach to the region.
Responding to the fact that Israel
appears to have violated all funda-

mental aspects of the Bush-led
"roadmap" to peace, particularly
freezing illegal settlement growth,
she acknowledged, "We haven't been
monitoring and verifying during the
last two years."

THE PHOENIX

when Israel bombed southern
Lebanon, home to many Palestinian
refugees, with impunity; they stood
by as Israel continued its open
expansion of illegal settlements in
the occupied West Bank.
Rice may feign surprise at the
lack of progress towards peace in
the region, but her position amounts
to nothing more than willful ignodisempower
you
rance.
If
Palestinian moderates and fail to
take seriously the political power of
more hardline political elements
like Hamas, then it is little wonder
that the Palestinian political vacuum has produced a populace more
open to violence than ever before,
according to recent polls. Could she
possibly not have known of the
crimes that Israel continued to perpetuate against Palestinians, while
the U.S.-Israel alliance bumbled
through its responses to the latest
Palestinian political infighting?
What is perhaps most troubling
is that this year's crop of candidates

is just as beholden to the old terms
of the debate as the Bush administration has been. All of the candidates have appeared at conventions

held by the influential, extremist

lobby group American Israel Public
Affairs Committee.
All parrot the same tired policy
slogans of the past. But the next
president, particularly if he or she

lasts for two terms will face a policy
concern that previous U.S. presidents have not had to deal with. As
growing population facts on the
ground change, the U.S. continued
support for Israel's illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories
will be tantamount to supporting an
apartheid-like state where a minority rules a majority.
In the face of Israel's existence
perpetuating an even greater fundaagainst
mental
crime
the
Palestinian people, American Jewry
and the American people need to
choose a different path from the one
they have traveled thus far.
Jews must reject the
extreme leadership in its midst that
has used vast money and influence
to push presidential candidates to
such hard-line positions in support
American

of Israel.

*

And all Americans must speak up
to reject the crimes in the
Palestinian territories that persist
with our own acquiescence. The
horse-race aspects of the presidential campaign should not be an
excuse to ignore the pressing issues
that make this such an important
election.

Boycott Olympics over Darfur
To the Editor:
I'd like to commend you for the editorial that
you ran in last week's Phoenix on boycotting the
Olympics. The suppression of Tibetan culture
and religious practices is something that all
newspapers that claim to endorse free speech
should find appalling. The state-run media in
China has yet to report on the deaths ofTibetans
in the current wave of violence, and it seems that
the Chinese government intends on approach
the upcoming Olympics in the spirit of aggressive and boisterous nationalism, not the spirit of
openness and inclusion that the games are supposed to be about. It should also be noted that

China is one of the biggest roadblocks to the
international response to the genocide in Darfur.
Critics will claim hypocrisy, or that the
United States is scared of a rising power and
wishes to ruin their moment on the world stage,
but I don't think any outrageous demands are
April 3, 2008

being made. Contrary to how his opinions are
portrayed in Chinese media, the Dalai Lama is
not seeking a break from China, but merely a

level of autonomy that would allow for the

preservation of Tibetan culture and religion.
Also, China is not being asked to send troops or
aid to Darfur, only that it stop doing business
with a government that is known to fund the
genocide of its own people, and to allow UN
troops to be approved.
This is not to say that China is alone at fault
in either case, but it is China that wishes to exalt
their country while attempting to suppress the
voices of a portion of its people. I have no problem with China celebrating its own heritage and
culture with pride as host of the 2008 Olympic
games, as long as its government is willing to
live up to a certain level ofhuman rights and tol-

erance.

nothing else came out of it, at least I could be inspired to
greater heights by driven, community-oriented peers,
and at the very least, we were getting off campus for the
weekend. That fact alone had my hopes high, so that the
prospect of a few days steeped in the spirit of black solidarity seemed promising.
Unfortunately, Yale's conference was a total bust. I
went because I felt strongly rooted in my community and
the need for social justice, and I was looking for inspiration and hope to continue doing the work. I thought that

U.S. athletes
not martyrs
To the Editor:
I would like to respond from a different point of view regarding China's violent suppression ofTibet and its people.
Obviously what is happening on the
other side of the world is a tragedy. I
agree with the writers that offering
China to host the 2008 games was a mistake in hindsight. Maybe the Olympic
committee thought that China would
clean up its act when it awarded them
the Olympics eight or so years ago.
However, I have trouble with the
writers offering up the Olympic athletes
to boycott the Games. I think it is easy
to sit in front of a computer and offer up
opinions when it doesn't cost the
writer(s) anything. I ran for Villanova
University in the early 'Bo's, and I had a
teammate who was ranked No. 1 in the
world in the 800 meters and was denied
the chance to compete in the Olympics
in 1980. He worked eight years to position himself for a chance for a gold
medal and an opportunity to.compete.
To me it seemed the boycott in 1980 didn't accomplish what it set out to do.
Ironically, Afghanistan seems a bigger
mess now. The writers feel it would be
"unfortunate" for the athletes preparing

for the Games. Maybe the writers'
should offer their own sacrifice in trying to convince China to change its policies instead of volunteering other people
to make the sacrifice.

I might discover a vibrant, diverse group of leaders, a
burgeoning social movement in its thrilling early stages.
I should have known, however, that Yale was not the
place to find such things. I mean, the conference's headlining event was Lupe Fiasco, after all
a skilled, relatively principled hip hop artist, but certainly no revolu-

tionary. The weekend's primary corporate sponsor was
none other than Abercrombie & Fitch, for crying out
loud. In fact, I have a conference booklet plastered with
a gratuitous A&F ad to prove it, and a courtesy A&Fbranded daypack by which to remember the whole weekend.
Yeah, uh huh. Abercrombie & Fitch. The company
that was successfully sued not once, not twice, but three
times because it hired pretty white people to work in the
front of its stores and pretty brown people to lift boxes
and stock in the back. Of course, I lodged a complaint
with the Steering Committee on the spot, since it failed
to disclaim in either spoken or written word that the corporate sponsors that made the weekend possible did not
respect and honor our community. I explained that by
taking the money with no questions asked—all I was asking for was a qualifying statement of some sort!—they
had absolved Abercrombie of its sins and any obligation
to work further for the trust and confidence of black communities in specific, and people of color more generally.
What's perhaps worst of all is the utter indifference with
which the organizers, and indeed, most of the conference
goers, received this perplexing fact.
Needless to say, I was disappointed by the conference;
its examination of issues around blackness was disengaged and woefully uncritical. They basically brought
us together to march rank-and-file with them, towing
party line of "Vote Obama in November" (we'll leave that
one alone for now), and the flippant and apathetic atti-

tude in the air was disturbing. You could almost hear
people's innermost thoughts: 'I wonder if I can put this
on my resume...' These kids, knee-deep in social privilege and caught up in the rat race, seemed to have lost
sight of the bigger picture.
After a narrowly defined civil rights agenda was realized in the 19605, bringing blacks into a mainstream society still ill-suited to equitably and justly receive them did
little to alter the racist realities of the American system.
A legalistic framework now neutral on its face still
begets realities of discrimination, though now the beast
has transformed itself. There may be the Oprahs and P.
Diddys
and yes, the Swatties, Amherstians and Elies
but this limited phenomenon is really just the same
old America dressed up in the unconvincing trappings of
racial and socioeconomic equality. Against this backdrop, an Abercrombie-sponsored apathy towards a community's grand problems and narrative on the part of an
elite few individual only serves to further frustrate an
equality that can be enjoyed by all.
Racism is alive and well in this society; its effects,
however, are felt and observed unevenly and disproportionately
and evidently, not so urgently by the black
folk at Yale. Given that newer generations of blacks seem
ill-advised of their role in the grander scheme of events,
the contention that the our 'powerhouse' generation is in
fact ill-equipped to continue the struggle we've inherited
is entirely founded. Perhaps, then, we should hit the
books a bit more before undertaking a conference entitled "Revitalizing the Revolution," because we have to
start a revolution properly first. How? Well, I don't know,
but here's a tip, kiddos: The revolution will not be sponsored by Abercrombie & Fitch.

Shalit's message hateful, regressive
Wendy Shalit appeared on campus
yesterday evening, delivering a lecture
entitled "Modesty: An Alternative
Lifestyle? A Perspective on the College
Hookup Culture." Shalit, whose credentials include both a B.A. in philosophy
from Williams College and the Hustler
magazine Asshole of the Month title, is
most widely known for her book "Girls

Gone Mild: Young Women Reclaim SelfRespect and Find It's Not Bad to Be
Good."

Her
lecture,
by
hosted
the
Intercollegiate
Institute,
Studies
Maimonides, Women's Studies, the

Gender Education Office and the Forum
for Free Speech, provided a perspective
on college hookups similar to that put
forth in her book: that the promiscuity
rampant on college campuses represents

the antithesis of women's liberation.
Shalit's argument in Girls Gone Mild,

particularly in its first chapter "Hi,
Slut!" contends that teens and college-age
students are pressured into having casual sex by a pervasive atmosphere of
promiscuity. Women, she claims, want a
return to sex relations of a century ago,
wherein "dating a woman meant kissing
her gloved hand
when sex meant love
and marriage meant 'till death do us
...

part,'" largely ignoring millennia of prostitution and marital infidelity. Further,
she argues that sexual activity outside of
marriage is dangerous, not only philosophically, but physically. She focuses on
the possibility of a contraceptive failing
or the empirically low chance of STI
transmission during protected sex in
order to advance her views.
Shalit's worst offenses come bundled
with her views on sexual assault. In the
introduction to her first book, "A Return
to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue,"
she writes, "I propose that the woes
besetting the modern young woman
sexual harassment, stalking, rape, even
'whirlpooling' (when a group of guys surround a girl who is swimming, and then
are all expressexually assault her)
sions of a society which has lost its
respect for female modesty." In essence,
she places the blame for sexual assault
squarely upon the women being harassed
due to their perceived immodesty.
Addressed specifically, the claims
raised in "Girls Gone Mild" and in
Shalit's lecture are problematic on sever-

faulted for its reliance on anecdotes
rather than statistical evidence, and
some of her boldest claims, including one
that immodesty has become an "epidemic" on college campuses are without
empirical support.
Second, her ideas are ideologically
regressive. In advocating a return to socalled "traditional positions" where
women are not allowed to be sexually
active before marriage, it appears that
the women's liberation movement has
come full circle. The only difference is
that it is now a woman saying that
women ought not be sexual, with some
men and women rising up in opposition.
With the claim that only sex after marriage is acceptable, her ideas become tac-

al levels. First and foremost, neither
Shalit's educational background nor her
research methodology are suited for academic discourse. Her book is widely

to present hateful and misguided ideas
which accomplish little other than to

itly homophobic and necessarily exclusionary of the queer community.
In light of her lecture on our campus,

Shalit's un-academic assault on feminism
has been granted the credibility of our
institution. While it is undeniable that
free expression, even of unsavory ideas,
ought to be promoted, we believe that
Shalit is using her lecture as a platform
undo the hard-earned progress of the feminist movement.

U.S. and China need more dialogue
BY TOMMY HUANG AND ALICE XIANG

xhuangL@swarthmore.edu and
axiangl@swarthmore.edu

We were dismayed to see last week's staff editorial urging
the world to boycott the Beijing Olympics, while doing little
justice to the political and emotional complexity of the situation or to discussion of the practical consequences. The editorial asserted that, due to
the "very political" nature of the Olympics,
such a boycott would be an opportunity for
"Western nations" (?) to leverage in the interests of political
reform, as well as prevent "American morality" (?) from stooping intolerably low.
On the contrary, we see boycotting the Olympics as a diplomatic action that will not only bear little positive political
effect, but also prove highly counterproductive at both political and grassroots levels. Political reform in China is an
extremely complicated and long-term process, and the government's decision-making is unlikely to be affected significantly by such a boycott. Instead, the ones who truly bear the
brunt of a boycott would be the athletes, many of whom see
competing in the Games as the pinnacle of their careers. In
addition, since the 1980s, the popularity of the Olympics in
China has bordered on that of a national holiday; for millions
of everyday Chinese, finally being host to one is a great pleasure and honor on an individual level. Thus, regardless of the
intention, a boycott of the 2008 Olympics an event charged
with so much personal anticipation and investment would
provoke a widespread sense offrustration among the Chinese
people, and deepen misunderstanding between China and the
international community.
The saddening incidents ongoing in Tibet painfully highlight the increased need for dialogue in resolving socio-political tensions, as well as the disturbing biases that exist in both

China-based and non-China-based media. China-based media,
while making little note of China's own dearth of balanced
media coverage, recently had a field-day with exposing the
sensationalized Tibet-related reports of Western media (in
particular a misleadingly cropped CNN photograph), further
fanning existing nationalistic sentiments within China.
Likewise, many mainstream non-China-based medias have
rushed into making simplistic moral judgments regarding
matters such as Tibet and the Olympics, at the expense of providing in-depth and thoughtful coverage on what are complex
social, political and historical issues. In such an atmosphere,
already full of misunderstandings and pre-assumptions, a
boycott of the Beijing Olympics will only serve to aggravate
tension and create new divides. Thus we feel that a boycott,
rather than the original wish to engage with and confront
important issues, would instead effectively result in a damaging shutting-down upon them.
Discussion outside China of the 2008 Olympics' aggrandized, overly politicized aspects, while deserving of attention
and debate, has continually overshadowed its equally salient
personal facets, as well as the practical consequences of a boycott. We write in the hope of offering a different perspective.
Debate over issues such as Tibet and the Olympics involve
many differing worldviews and interpretations that in turn
necessarily involve different sets of biases. In light of this, we
believe thatthe consequences of a boycott would ultimately be
counter-productive; strains of antagonism, defensiveness and
condescension almost inevitably come to taint such (lack of)
interactions. There exist more constructive, effective and
long-term ways to increase awareness and progress regarding
important issues within China. No matter how difficult, we
should be working towards attaining increased dialogue and
communication, open-mindedness and understanding and
boycotting the 2008 Olympics will only be to the detriment of
all of these.

voice was quickly silenced. The Sager Party is meant to be
tied to the symposium. It is the culminating event and more
than anything, I felt that this year the party served to bring
heterosexist, misogynist reality crashing back around my

ears, ending my genderqueer euphoria.
The party was not a safe space. It felt dangerous and threatening especially for queer people and women. The idea behind
the party is genderfuck, NOT guys wear a dress girls wear less
as is commonly believed. Regardless of what people are wearing, though, there is no excuse for the homophobia and sexual harassment that occurs. I was wearing less and I was mess-

ing with gender. In a queer, celebratory space it was the genderfucking that was appreciated and celebrated. At the party,
however, any genderfucking was completely ignored because
I have a female body and its exposure is taken as a token for
people to leer at me and assume that my body exists for thenpleasure. It does not. The Sager party is not an excuse to leave
misogyny and heterosexism unchecked.
While I recognize that problematic behavior is absolutely
not limited to straight men at the party, this is was what I felt
most acutely. Ifthe party is to continue, I implore those of you
with heterosexual male privilege to check your internalized
sexism, heterosexism and your egos at the door. Just because
a female body is scantily clad (note that female body does not
mean woman), does not mean you have any right to leer,
objectify and especially touch or otherwise harass. Women's
bodies do not exist for your sake.

Sager loses sight of symposium
To the Editor:
Last weekend's Sager Symposium was a great success:

our events were well attended and our speakers were brilliant, unique and thought provoking. But, despite the
efforts of the planning committee, the spirit of the party
still does not reflect the spirit of the symposium. The party
was not only not queer friendly, it was actively homopho-

bic.

Queer people were pushed around the dance floor in
DU and Olde Club. Everywhere we turned, heterosexual
couples (who did not attend the symposium) were making
out. Many presumably straight men made a mockery of
genuine transgendered expression by wearing tutus

while

uttering homophobic comments.
There were many homophobic incidents at the party.
We noticed men pointing and whispering at queer couples
dancing together. Another one of our friends was asked
why all the men were in dresses. When we left, some guys
were climbing trees yelling "Don't go in there! There are
guys making out!" They most certainly did not attend any
of the events in the Sager Symposium.
The issue at question is not a heterosexual presence at
Sager
heterosexual activity has a clear place within the
THE PHOENIX

spectrum of human sexual and gender expression. The
issue is that this is a party organized by the queer community, for the queer community. The specific people in
the straight community robbed that space again this year,
with little signs of support for the many amazing events of
the symposium. We were annoyed by the tone of the party
as one that was not only completely divorced from the
Symposium, but made queer people, at best, exceptions

and at worst, disgusting aberrations.
The Sager Party is not a hetero, grind-up-on-each-other,
have-bad-drunken-sex party. We all know such alternative
.lifestyle choices are tolerated at Swarthmore College. Nor
is the Sager Party intended to be an excuse to further
silence, reject and marginalize the queer community.
Sager is a party to celebrate a weekend of LGBTQ related

speakers.
We deeply encourage all attendees of the party to participate in the events. If you can spend months belaboring
your outfit, you can go to an hour-long lecture, and your
self-realizations will be more than worth it.

OP-ED

Upon a Sager Eve I was informed,
Dogmatic stricture by our fire warmed.
What sundry thoughtful office did endorse
That seemed benign in fact might be quite coarse.
That foe of coital mentors did import,
This to our notice, asking not support,

Gave reason sad to think he might,

Hope spiteful controversy to incite,

And prize a victim's title from our fight.
A title that before unlatched this gate,
When he subjection's tongue appropriate.
A viewpoint we fear not to represent,
In many crude and wounding ways was bent.
Our lives and loves the speaker did defame,
And placed upon us great and monstrous blame.
Nor was this her belief, she claimed, but fact!

Despite the force of evidence she lacked.
Not least of what she could not prove was gleaned
From glossy page of fashion magazine.
Tactics employing of cable news lewd,
She many a disparate statement construed,
And generalized from the lives of a few
I wonder, my friends, did they represent you?
-

By casting the data in misleading light,
She added to her rhetorical might.

Homophobia at Genderfuck Party
To the Editor:
The Sager Symposium was incredible. Hearing speakers
and performers affirm and give voice to queerness was very
empowering. It made me want to dance. But by the time I got
to dancing at the Sager party, surrounded by more Swatties
and others than I could ever deem to count, that celebratory

Unwelcome education

But it was so obvious, didn't you know?
Sex Ed leads to rape, and other such woe!

Some warned me not to get in on this fight,
Lest I add to the size her little spot-light.
But she has our money, support, and our stage,
Which I feel has left no choice not to engage.
That she is coming I cannot contend,
But I ask you consider just what she offend:
Not students alone, but
the most basic principles of our community:
Responsible and Honest Scholarship.
I list these first because
there can be no Freedom
without Responsibility.
Though immodest fiction bias exploit
And discourse be perverted over Hoyt;
Though learned halls their hallowed names debase,
In haste to aid a self-made martyr's case,

Some acolytes of those who endorsed,
Could find no reason to reverse that course.
Those who most plainly could see the offense,
Did anyway rise to the speaker's defense:
"For, though we insult and falsity see,
Yet this some concept of our project be,
So we cannot judge, and we cannot agree."
Thus my fellows their major having lent,
Its name and credibility to her,
Who was most undeserving, protest not.
Though one did say, himself in years gone by,
Would not incline this logic to apply.
As they are great in my esteem, I tried,
To comprehend all, but could not abide.
Ergo my foe I must congratulate,
For me on this one point did he set straight:
Though home of wit and reason Swat may be,
And lovers of fair unveiled knowledge we,
In many a corner exists proclivity,
To impart a perilous relativity.

Though these uncouth facts be forced upon me,
And it seems all were demeaned,
I am, and I will forever be
Queer, Happy, Sexy, Proud, and Free.

past
weekend,
This
the
Swarthmore men's track team used
its outdoor season opener to post
many Centennial Conference qualifying marks.
The Danny Curran Invite, hosted
by nearby Widener University, is
named in memory of a Widener
\thlete who died while hiking in
Oregon. While the meet began as a
small invite, this past weekend there
were over 30 schools represented. As
Jaymes
Fairfax-Columbo
'lO
events,
Saturday's
described
"Overall, I thought the team did very
well. It was a cold, windy day, but the
team still scorched the track."
The fire on the track began with
senior Mickey Katz's 5k race on
Friday. His time of 16:14 earned Katz a
16th place finish, as well as a spot in

the

Centennial

Conference

Championships. Katz's smashing per-

formance on Saturday was followed
by some impressive efforts from the

\iiscus ring.

While Swat throwers Nick WilletJeffries 'lO and Neel Prakash 'O9 both
threw respectable distances of over
25m, throws coach Tom Reynolds,
who competed unattached, blew all of
the competition away with a whopping throw of 49.7 m. Throughout the
course of the track meet Reynolds
went on to place in the top ten in each
of the subsequent throwing events:
shot put, javelin and hammer throw.
Prakash and Willet-Jeffries competed in all of these events with the
exception of the hammer throw.
According to Coach Reynolds, the
event at which Prakash most
excelled this weekend was one in
'vvhich he was competing for the first
time this year: the javelin. The explanation of Prakash's aptitude to this
specific event is most likely attribut-

able to his lack of girth, when com-

ulation.

Tramane Hall 11 made his debut on
the track and was a welcome addition
to the sprints portion of the track
team. Both Hall and Yongjun Heo 'O9
posted Conference qualifying marks in
the 100 m dash. Heo also doubled back
in the 200 later Saturday afternoon.
Chris Mayer-Bacon 'll executed
his preferred race, the 400 hurdles, in
style to add to the list of Conference

qualifiers.
A substantial portion of the distance men used Saturday to tune
their mid-distance skills by racing
the 1500. Junior Connor Darby's 4:16
qualifier was followed by robust performances by Jon Shoop 'OB, Katz,
Andrew Vanßuren 'lO, Dave Riccardi
'lO and Alex Breslow 'IL While not
completely satisfied with his performance, Shoop said, "I passed a lot
of people at the end
like 7 in the
last 100 meters."
According to Ross Weller 'OB,
many of the guys echoed Shoop's sentiment about going out too comfortably in the beginning of the 1500.
"From what the guys tell me, they all
had a lot left in the tank at the end of
...

the race. So we should see some faster
times soon," Weller said.
Dan Kurz 'll, Vanßuren and Seth
Green 'lO all ran speedy 800s. When
asked about his performance and
how he managed to race such a beautiful 800 following his performance in
the 1500 earlier that day, Vanßuren
said, "I had the image of Pete in my
head to keep me motivated the whole
time." What inspiration to kick it
into gear!

Jonnie Tompkins 'lO summed up
the past weekend's performances
with a heartfelt statement, "I feel like
the team is on the road to success."

Women impress in spring opener
BY JAYMES FAIRFAX-COLOMBO

jfairfal@swarthmore.edu

Despite some chilly weather, the Garnet
women's outdoor track and field team brought
the heat at Widener University's Danny Curran
Invitational. The team competed Friday and
Saturday, March 29-30.
The action kicked off on Friday afternoon
with four strong performances in the 5000
meters. Competing in only her first 5k on the
track, Cait Mullarkey 'O9 scorched the rubberized track in 18 minutes, 35.72 seconds to finish
in first place. Fellow juniors Emma Stanley and
Faith Pampel followed her in, clocking 19:00.84
and 19:33.25 for third and ninth place, respectively. Rebecca Woo 'll also ran a strong race,
making her individual outdoor debut in 20:19.76,
a personal record.
Mullarkey's time wasn't just good for first
it landed her eighth on the Swarthmore all-time
list. In examining her race strategy, Mullarkey
said, "It was the first time I've ever raced a 5k
on the track. I didn'tknow how I was gonna feel.
The pace was steady and I felt good in my third
mile so I dropped my splits down." She was also
glad to have some support from her teammates
in the unfamiliar event, as she said, "It was really nice to have some teammates in the race with
me. We worked well together."
Head coach Pete Carroll was pleased with
the girls' 5k effort, as he said, "Cait was eighth
all time. For a half-miler, that's pretty good.
She kinda toyed until the end and sat and
pounced. It was also good to see Emma running well in the five again; it means she's back
in shape and recovered from her injury."
When asked why so many girls run the sk,
Carroll said, "People ran this event as an off
event or an exploratory event. Emma ran this
event to shake off some rust. We don't want to
run people in the same event week after week
so we switch it around."
Pampel was also pleased with Friday's
results, as she said, "Coach was happy; he said
it was a solid first race for all of us. I didn't run
a personal record but for the first time ever I
ran negative splits in the 5k so I was happy.
Mullarkey ran a really great race, and Emma is
definitely coming back strong from her injury
'cause she ran really well."

The action continued the next day, with a
solid contingent of Garnet women competing in
a plethora of events. Lauren Deluca 'lO, Cait
Russell 11 and Melina Healey 'OB all recorded
Conference qualifying times, running 5:15.45,
5:18.05 and 5:24.77 respectively. Bess Ritter 'O9
pulled off a distance double, running both the
1500 and the 800 meters in a sharpening effort
for a run at Princeton University's Sam Howell
Invitational on Friday (she'll be joined by
Mullarkey and Nyika Corbett 10).
Coach Carroll was also proud of the 1500meter results. "I thought Cait Russell ran really
well and Lauren had a good opener. Melina was
solid too. Nyika was ready to go but she
tweaked her ankle Friday. She'll have her time
though," he said.
The Garnetwere also wellrepresented in the
sprints and field events. Nathalie De Gaiffier 10
competed in three events on Saturday. On the
track she recorded a personal record in the 200
meters, running a time of 3L83 seconds. She also
competed in the long jump and made her collegiate triple-jump debut, jumping 3.87 meters

and 8.53 meters respectively for the events.

"It was really nice to have
some teammates In the race
with me. We worked well
together."
Cait Mullarkey 'O9
Heather Hightower 'O9 competed in all three
major throwing events. She blasted the shot 8.07
meters, flung the discus 19.49 meters and made
her collegiate javelin debut with an effort of
13.30 meters.
The Garnet will next be in action tomorrow

with action from Princeton University's Sam
Howell Invite, and on Saturday, April 5 when
the team rocks the Osprey Invitational at
Richard Stockton College.

Women's lacrosse drops two against tough opponents
BY LAUREN WALKER

lwalkerl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore women's lacrosse team dropped a
couple of Conference games this week to two very strong
programs. On Thursday night, they took on the Franklin
&, Marshall College Diplomats, falling short 19-3, and on
Saturday they again came up short against the Red
Devils of Dickinson College, 17-6.
This brings the
Garnet's overall record to 4-6 (0-3 CC).
The Garnet went into Thursday night's game knowing
that it would be a tough battle. F&M is currently ranked
#1 in the country, so the Swarthmore women could not
have seen tougher competition. The Garnet held their
own, however, and fought the Diplomats hard throughout the game.
The Diplomats jumped on the Garnet women quickly
and efficiently, going on a 10-0 run at the beginning of the
game before Swarthmore was able to put one on the
board. F&M capitalized on almost every shot attempt in

its run. Before the half, however, Marissa Schaffer 'O9
put the first tally on the board for the Garnet, netting her
13th goal of the season and bringing the score to 10-L
F&M put two more in before the half, giving them a 12-1
advantage.

The second half saw more goals scored for the Garnet,
Diplomats had recorded several more

but not before the

22

of their own, extending their lead to a margin of 18 at one
point. Abbe Muller 'lO battled back for the Garnet, scoring an unassisted goal with about seven minutes to go.
Attack Amy Vachal 'll followed suit, scoring again for
the Garnet women after picking up the draw and taking
it straight to goal. Hers was the last goal scored in the
game.
The two Swarthmore goalies split the battle against
the constant F&M firing. Susannah Blair 'OB and Allison
Grein 'lO picked up three saves and one save, respective-

ly.

The team had a day to rest before their Saturday
match against the Dickinson Red Devils. The Devils are
also a highly ranked and respected program, currently
ranked #2O nationwide.
Their opponents again struck early and often, going
on a 4-0 run before the Garnet could get a tally on the
board.
After the run stopped, however, Swarthmore matched
each goal scored by the Devils in the first half. Alex
Gilbert-Bono 'lO put the first notch on the board for the
Garnet with 15:41 left in the first half. This was her seventh goal of the season. Midfielder Anna de Regt 'O9

added one of her own ten minutes later, her ninth of the
season. Muller tallied yet another for the Garnet with a
little over a minute remaining. The score was 7-3 going
into the half.

April 3, 2008

At the start of the second half, Muller netted another
goal, her 17th of the season, cutting the Red Devil lead to
three. Dickinson answered back, slipping two more past
the Garnet defense, but the Swarthmore women continued to battle. Schaffer added another for the Garnet with
25:52 left in the game to bring Swarthmore within four.

The Red Devils followed with a huge scoring run, bringing the score to 17-5 before the Garnet women were able
to find the back of the net again. Vachal put in the last
tally for the Garnet with less than a second left, leaving
the final score at 17-6.
Despite the rough start in conference play, the Garnet
women are looking to bounce back in their next game.
"We're really doing a good job applying the things we're
working on at practice," Carey Pietsch 'lO said. "We're
working really hard."
In the three Centennial match-ups they have complet-

ed so far, they have played the three strongest teams.
"We've definitely come through the toughest games of
the season already," de Regt said, "and we're looking forward to our next match up."
They are excited and preparing for their next match
up on Thursday at home against Eastern and their next
conference battle against McDaniel College away on
Saturday. "Hopefully we can take the experience we've
gained from the past two games and use what we've

learned to help us,"

Megan

Sanborn 'OB said.

Softball plays busy stretch Robotic Referees?
BY BEN RAPHEL

braphell@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet softbaU team (11-8,1-ICC) has
been busy and very successful in the past
two weeks. The team played its first conference games and a nationally ranked opponent. Kathryn Riley 'lO continued her success on the mound, while Christine
Sendelsky 'O9 connected for a grand slam in
a game against Arcadia University last
Thursday.

The Garnet built on its strong momen-

tum from its spring break travels, winning
both games of a doubleheader at Penn
State-Berks on March 22, 5-3 and 16-0. Al
Zelaski 'O9 and Riley continued their solid
pitching, while the Garnet's bats were once
again out in full force.

During the first game, Zelaski took the
mound, only giving up four hits over the
course of the game. However, the Nittany
Lions took the early advantage on
Swarthmore, scoring two runs in the bottom
of the first inning. The Garnet answered
quickly though by tying the game up in the
top of the second, when catcher Michele
Perch 10 hit her first home run in her collegiate career. PSU-Berks then took a 3-2 lead
by scoring in the bottom of the second.
The Nittany Lions were unable to score
again though, as Zelaski had seven total
strikeouts in the game and gave up only one
more hit after the second inning. The Garnet
bats were dormant for a few innings, until
the top of the sixth, when Katherine Gold 'OB
hit a home run. Sendelsky also scored off
Gold's homer, and the Garnet took a 4-3 lead.
Melissa Emmerson 'll scored an insurance
run later in the inning, making the final
score of the first game 5-3.
After the close first game, the second contest against the Nittany Lions was never in
doubt. The Garnet jumped out to an early
lead in the first when Walker reached home
plate on a passed ball. Later that inning,
Emmerson doubled, scoring Gold and
Maggie Vizcarra 'll Emmerson would later
score herself, and Swarthmore ended the
first inning with four runs. After getting
another run in the second, The Garnet put
the game away in the third with an eightrun inning. Riley started off the run parade
by hitting a three-run double to score
Lauren Walker 'O9, Krista Scheirer 'll and
Kira Kern 'IL Two batters later, Vizcarra hit
a double to bring home Riley and Sendelsky.
Next up at the plate was Gold, who singled to
allow Vizcarra to score. Gold and Emmerson
later scored off a single by Lauren Marczi
'll This productive third inning gave the
Garnet a 13-0 advantage. The Garnet scored
three more runs in the fourth inning, and
the game was called after five innings due to
the mercy rule.
Swarthmore held its home opener
against nearby Widener University on
March 25. The Garnet won the first game 51 but could not hold on for a second victory,
losing 4-2 to the Pride. In the opener, Riley
pitched a two-hit, one-run game en route to
the win. She also helped on the offensive end
by hitting a double in the fourth inning to
score Walker, and later scoring herself off a
single from Maggie Vizcarra. In the sixth,
Emmerson singled to score Kristin Caspar
'O9. Later in the inning, Gold and
Hendrickson would reach home plate, capping off a strong performance by the Tide on
both ends of the field. The second game
started close, as Swarthmore and Widener
traded a couple runs each. Vizcarra had an
RBI single to put the Garnet on the scoreboard in the third, while Riley's double
drove
home Walker in the fifth.
Unfortunately, the ride scored an extra run
in both the sixth and seventh inning to steal

There
have been
calls from
some quarters of the

the victory away from Swat. Krista Scheirer

pitched a complete game in the loss for the

Tide.
On March 27, the team won both ends of a
doubleheader against visiting Arcadia
University. In the first game, Sendelsky's
grand slam in the bottom of the sixth piloted
the Tide to an 8-2 victory. The grand slam
was Sendelsky's first home run of the season, and fifth home run of her Swarthmore
career.
"Sendelsky's grand slam was like eating
a lobster dinner," head coach Renee Clarke
said.
The second game of the day featured
another shutout on the mound by Riley, as
the Garnet took home a 3-0 victory.
Swarthmore scored all three of its runs in
the bottom of the third, as Walker, Riley and
Sendelsky all crossed home plate. Riley also
held the Knights to only three hits over
seven innings.
"It's the first time in five years at least
that we have swept Arcadia," Gold said in
an e-mail.
On Saturday, the Garnet had traveled to
Dickinson College to begin Centennial
Conference play. Swarthmore split its games
with the Red Devils, winning the first while
losing the second. In the first game, Riley hit
a two-run home run in the top of the third to
give the Garnet an early lead. Riley then
scored again in the fifth off a single by Gold,
ensuring the Tide of a victory. The Tide held
off the Red Devils and won the game, 3-2. In
the first game, Riley was not only a force at
the plate, but she also earned the victory on
the mound. In the second game, Swarthmore
could not keep its momentum up, losing a 20 decision to Dickinson. Red Devil pitcher
Grace Perry shut out the Garnet and only
gave up four hits over seven innings. Riley,
pitching her second game of the day, let up
only four hits as well in the losing effort.
The next day, Swarthmore hosted nonconference foe Rowan University, the 24thranked team in the nation. The Profs (18-3)
jumped out to an early lead and never
relented, shutting out the Garnet 4-0. Riley
pitched in the losing effort, but the Garnet
could only produce four hits during the
game.

"Rowan was a great team and we just did
not hit enough to keep us in the game," team
captain Katie Gold said in an e-mail.
Although Rowan won the game, the Profs
scored most of their runs in the first inning,
and the team was happy to compete closely
against one of the best teams in the region.
"They got real fortunate, because they had
lots of base hits that went right through the

open holes on the field," Vizcarra said.
"Without the first inning, it was only a 10 ballgame," Riley said.
So far this season, Riley has emerged as
a team leader both at the plate and on the
mound. In the Garnet's past 10 games, she
has accumulated a .529 batting average,
along with three home runs and 18 RBI. In
addition to her hitting prowess, Riley has

been pitching both ends of Garnet doubleheaders recently. "I want to give a special
nod to Kathryn Riley, who pitched every
game this week and hit amazingly," Gold
said in an e-mail.
The Garnet's home doubleheader against
Ursinus College Tuesday was postponed and
rescheduled for April 17. The team will next
travel to Rosemont College today at 3 p.m.

for a non-conference doubleheader. After
that, Swarthmore hosts conference rival
Gettysburg on Saturday at 1 p.m.
"Gettysburg won the conference last
year," Riley said. "We won both games in
the regular season last year but they beat us
in the playoffs, so we'll be out to get
revenge."

Red Card

in

the modern
game.
Referees
have been
known

to

make
takes

misin
crunch time
t have made huge impacts on the
final results, such as a goal incorrectly

disallowed or a player unjustly sent
off. The incident, still fresh in my
mind, is that of Marco Materazzi getting a red card for two tame fouls.
Keeping a clean sheet for the majority
of the game at Anfield is no easy ride.
But while it seems to be an obvious
solution to include technology in many
aspects of the game, there are a lot
more factors to take into account.
Diving is a huge problem in today's
game and many believe the introduction of video replays during the game
would help officiate the game better.
Players today have all kinds of tricks
up their sleeves and if it would help
swing the result in their favor, they
would use them. How many times have
we seen players go down in the penalty
box for the faintest of touches? Or nonAlberto
(like
existent
touches
Gilardino during the Milan-Celtic
match last year)? Well-timed dives (it's
pretty twisted how they practice diving) would catch the referee's eye and
many times fool him.

Maybe all the fans could
become machines
yelling without
rhyme or reason.
But how would TV replays really
help? They would cause a small break
in the game to review the incident. If
the player is found guilty of diving, he
might be cautioned with a warning or
a yellow card, and if not, it's a foul for
his team. Unfortunately there is a significant level of subjectivity in choosing whether to give out a warning or a
yellow card. A lot of the times there is
some contact but the player might
have overreacted in his appeal for a
foul. Behind the objective views of the
television cameras are the subjective
opinions of the people making the decision. If this were made official, referees might revert to this quite a few
times, which poses an even bigger
problem.
Football is a simple game without
too many rules, unlike many other professional sports. There are two fortyfive minute halves, three refs, a ball
and 22 players battling it out on a rectangular field. Apart from offsides,
there are no rules. It is played continuously from start to finish.
Many people underestimate the
momentum of a team and its impact on

the game. I just finished watching the
Roma-Manchester United game and
momentum dictated a lot of it. Roma
controlled the tempo in the first half
but failed to make anything of it and
looked increasingly likely to break
through the deadlock until Cristiano
Ronaldo fired in an unstoppable header. Roma, obviously distraught, just
played out the half. In the second half
they came out firing on all cylinders
with a few great opportunities, but
again failed to convert. Then Wayne
Rooney capitalized on a loose ball and
Roma were again without any answers
for the rest of the game. TV replays
would cause unnecessary disruptions,
which would affect the game even more
adversely than human error. A much
easier way to solve problems like diving is to retroactively punish players.
One could distribute fines and suspensions from a committee. What really hurts the players is either a loss of
salary or playing time. The committee
could also take as much time as it
wants as it wouldn't be constrained by
making a quick, rash decision.
Finally, and possibly most importantly in terms of future considerations, the authority of the referee
would be undermined severely if technological oversight were implemented.
The referee's role in the game is, integral as he should not only have good
judgment and decision-making skills,
but he should ensure the game is
played fairly and with good spirit.
With the referee's judgment constantly called into question, players
would easily take advantage and argue
in length over certain calls, intimidating the referee, not to mention the
jeers from the home fans.
One extreme would be to kick refs
out of the game completely. The line
refs would be replaced by high-tech
lasers that are able to detect within 0.1
millimeters. Every time there is a foul,
a loud obnoxious sound could go off.
And maybe all the fans could become
machines yelling without rhyme or
reason. I guess we're not at that stage
yet and tradition is kind of a hard
habit to kick.
But in all seriousness, referees are
there to help the game. Their intentions are fair and when they make a
call, it's probably because they think
it's worth blowing the whistle. Unless
of course we take a situation like the
Calciopoli scandal in Italy a few years
ago, in which the referees were to
blame because they placed a bias
towards one team. That, however, was
the fault of the system and individuals
in positions of power, such as former
Juventus manager Luciano Moggi and
his band of degenerates. Referees are
simply pawns in their evil master plan.
If referees make mistakes, they're
equally likely to do it for both teams.
Of course some calls will be unfair to
one side, but that should balance out in
the long run.

It's really easy to make objective
judgments about a situation played out
with high intensity, tempers flaring,
and adrenaline rushing. It's easy to say
video replays would help the game in
the short run but we are ignoring the
long-term possibilities, including a

massive overhaul of the rules and regulations. I guess, in the end, it really is

subjective.

Baseball blasts Washington, falls to Hopkins

BY MELINDA PETRE
mpetrel@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore baseball team (7-8, 1-3 CC) defeated
Washington College (5-8, 1-3 CC) 15-3 on Friday, earning
its first Centennial Conference win of the season. Scott
Dalane 'OB led the team with four runs, six hits in as
many at-bats and three RBIs. Additionally, Swarthmore
saw offensive contributions from the majority of its lineup, with many players earning hits, RBIs and runs.
Pitcher Neil Mejia 'll (3-2) picked up his first career conference win.

"When we bring our intensity to
the field we're confident that
we can play with anyone."
Ben Schneiderman 'll
This was an important win for Swarthmore, which
was only just coming off its loss at Washington on

Tuesday.

"The loss [on Tuesday] served as a bit of a wake-up
call. Friday's win was confirmation that we can compete
in this conference," said Conor Casey 'O9.
"We didn't let Tuesday's game affect Friday's, we were

confident that we could beat them all along," Jimmy Gill
'lO said.
The team is excited about the message their win sends
to the rest of the conference, particularly "that we are
not just the same old Swarthmore," according to Wiley
Archibald 'lO. "With each win we not only improve, but
also earn more respect," he said.
The team shares Archibald's optimistic outlook. "It
says a lot about our team's resilience to come back after
a demoralizing defeat on Tuesday and really stick it to
them," Ben Schneiderman 'll said.
On Saturday, the team traveled to Baltimore to the
field of defending Centennial Conference Champion #2l
Johns Hopkins University (14-3,4-0 CC), where it suffered
hard losses, 12-1 and 18-2. "We knew we were going to face
a team that executes in all areas of the game. We respected them, but we did not go down there afraid," explained
Gill.

In the first game, pitcher Andy Allen 'll (0-1) recorded five strikeouts in five innings, only allowing six hits.
Schneiderman (0-1) got the team off to an equally impressive start in the second game pitching the first two
innings. "We knew that those games were not going to be
easy, but that win or lose, if we played our game, we
would come out strong and walk away that much better,"
Archibald said. "The scoreboard doesn't reflect everything that really happened in the game."

"We played hard the entire day and did not quit no
matter what the score," Gill added.

losses. "We learned a lot from Saturday's losses
if our
pitchers keep pitching as well as they did against
Hopkins, we're going to win a lot of games this year. All
you can do is tip your cap to the Hopkins hitters when
they take great pitches and turn them into hits,"
Schneiderman said.

"With each win we not only improve,
but also earn more respect."

"I'm very impressed with all the freshmen. They all
play without fear, and hard," Casey said.
Although Tuesday's matchup against Ursinus has
been postponed due to poor field conditions, Swat baseball will face them twice this week. They played yesterday, a game which finished too late for this edition, and
then will play at Ursinus on Friday afternoon. The
Garnet is optimistic about these games. "They're a playoff team, so they're good, but I still think they're very
beatable," Casey said. "If we play like we can, though,
the Bears are going to walk away very surprised,"
Archibald said.
"We just need to play within ourselves, and when we
bring our intensity to the field we're confident that we
can play with anyone," Schneiderman said.
