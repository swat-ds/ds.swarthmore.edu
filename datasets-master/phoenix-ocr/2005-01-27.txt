New dorm to be named for Alice Paul
Student Council-devised system picks name of alum, women's suffragette for new residence hall
BY KEVIN CARR

kcarrl@swarthmore.edu

The search for a name for Swarthmore's

newest building is over.
According to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l, a permanent name has been
chosen for the building that has until now
been referred to as New Dorm. The dormitory will be named to commemorate Alice
Paul, class of 1905.
Paul, a longtime feminist activist, is the
founder of the National Woman's Party and
author of the Equal Rights Amendment.
Her name stood out as the frontrunner in
the name-suggestion process, according to

Student Council Co-President Tom Evnen
'O7.

An alumna donated $2 million for the gift
in September and received the naming
rights for the dorm.
She wished to remain anonymous, however, and suggested that students devise a
contest to determine the name, as reported
in The Phoenix.
Evnen said that the contest was administered by "setting up an e-mail account" and
"soliciting suggestions from Swarthmore

students."
Students sent suggestions to the account
and the popularity of each suggestion could
be determined by looking at its frequency in
the special e-mail account.
From that point, Evnen said that the top
five suggestions were sent to the anonymous
donor the name of Alice Paul was selected.
"The donor is pleased," Eldridge said.
He noted that this will be the first building on campus to be named for a female.
"It's a reach back into the college's history
to honor a woman," he said.
"I'm so happy. That's terrific," Sasha

Grenier 'OB said, after hearing of the dorm's
new name.
Sabrina Danielsen 'O7, a New Dorm resident, expressed mixed emotion on the deci-

sion.
"It's a nice reminder of the past... Alice
Paul did great things for women's rights,"
she said. "At the same time, she was a little
bit of an elitist."

Some students had proposed naming the
dorm after the late Swarthmore professor of
economics Bernard Saffran, who died
November 29, 2004.
Joshua Hausman 'O5, who was a teaching
assistant for some of Saffran's classes,
argued that there may be substantial support for naming the dorm after Saffran.
"They should have named it after Saffran
because there are more students in favor of
it," he said.

Hausman recognized that a primary reason why the name did not make the final cut
had to do with the timing of the naming
competition. "Saffran died after the naming
competition began," he said.
Trade Raizen 'OB, who also supported
naming the dorm after Saffran, was "slightly disappointed," though she did express
support for the decision to name the dorm
after Alice Paul instead.
The dorm will not be officially dedicated
until next year because a dedication ceremony for the new Science Center is slated
for this spring.
"There will be a dedication in the fall,"
Eldridge said.
Until then, students have the opportunity
to get accustomed to referring to the building by its new name, a process which could
take time.
"It's going to get called New Dorm for a
long time," Marty Griffith 'O5 said.

College radio program to report on Iraq war
BY BEN OLDFIELD
boldfiel@swarthmore.edu
35 years ago, Board of Managers member David Gelber
'63 reported for Pacifica Radio, a program that aired a
nightly broadcast called the Vietnam War Summary.
Every day, its producer and presenter Paul Fischer,

who now writes for the CBS Evening News, collected wire
copy from Agence France-Presse, the Associated Press and
other sources, and conducted phone interviews with journalists in Vietnam and Washington.
A forum for news that was reported nowhere else in the
major media, Fischer's program became what The New
Yorker called the single best daily source of news on
Vietnam.
Today, Gelber is in the process of starting a Nightly Iraq
War Summary, based at Swarthmore, to serve the same
purpose that Pacifica did during the Vietnam era.
The program, whose pilot broadcast was produced last
weekend, will be aired through the Swarthmore Web site.
With access to AP and Reuters wire copy, students will
rewrite stories from newspapers worldwide, turn wire
copy into radio copy and conduct interviews with journalists in Iraq and academic experts across the globe.
Now a CBS writer himself, Gelber said his motivation
for creating the program was his own frustration with the
way the American press deals with the war. "It's frustrating for all of us who work for the networks how hard a
time we have covering the conflict in Iraq," he said. "It's
the biggest foreign policy issue since Vietnam, and it
never gets more than a couple minutes on the nightly
news."

THE PHOENIX

Further, according to Gelber, network journalists
reporting from Iraq are severely limited by the threats to
their own safety. "They've got targets on their backs,"
Gelber said, "and can't get the full story."

"Our goal is to enhance the debate
over the war. We want to provide a
greater context than the mainstream
media and ask more difficult,

important questions."
Eva Barboni 'O6
Because the show will be broadcast on the radio rather
than television, news can be obtained from anywhere a
telephone is available, Gelber said. "We're hoping
Swarthmore can do with the telephone what networks
can't do with the camera. For example, at the minimal
expense of a phone call, we could speak with a pharmacy
worker in Fallujah."
Last weekend, Gelber and Fischer came to Swarthmore
to meet with students and faculty who had volunteered to
help create and run the Nightly Iraq War Summary.
After the set was cleared for the Evening News with
Dan Rather at CBS Studios on Friday, the two writers left
New York and worked almost 48 hours straight with students and faculty at the college to produce a sample version of the program.

January 27, 2005

Clips of the pilot program will be aired at an informational meeting tonight, where Eva Barboni 'O6, who has
taken on a main leadership role in the group, will formally unveil the program and its mission to the college popu-

lation.
"Our goal is to enhance the debate over the war,"
Barboni said. "We want to provide a greater context than
mainstream media can and ask more difficult, important
questions."

The program also aims to provide a more profound perspective from the Iraqi people.

According to Barboni, the pilot broadcast included an
interview with a hotel clerk in Baghdad who spoke of the
changes his life took when his hotel began housing foreign
journalists.
According to history professor Tim Burke, who was
involved in the program's creation, this personal element

is absent from mainstream media. "There is a real lack of
information that gets at interesting, human, complex stories. So much gets quickly compressed into being either
against or for the war effort, or reduced to a mere story of
mayhem and disorder," he said in an e-mail.
For him, the job of the radio program is to provide news
that is convincing as well as nonbiased and raw.
After the informational meeting, Barboni hoped many
more members of the community will get involved with
the program. "The pilot broadcast was not an end to the
creation process," she said. "It serves as a model to present
to the administration and to get others involved."
In addition to student volunteer workers, a full-time

Zimbabwean student named Rhodes scholar
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY JULIE BAKER

jbakerl@swarthmore.edu
Tafadzwa Muguwe 'O5 is one of

two Zimbabweans to be honored
with a 2005 Rhodes Scholarship,
making him Swarthmore's 26th
awardee and its third since 2000.
From hundreds of students worldwide who applied for the prestiat
gious
Rhodes program

England's Oxford University,
Muguwe was one of only 95 who
were selected to participate.
Muguwe is a pre-medical student and a biology major who has
conducted research in animal
behavior and pathology at
Swarthmore. He has spent two
summers at the Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York
studying the biology of HIV type I

within the human cell.

At Swarthmore, Muguwe has

been involved in a variety of
extracurricular activities, including the Inter-Varsity Christian

Fellowship,

the

Swarthmore
African Students Association
(SASA), and intramural soccer.
He
is
also
employed
by
Information and Technology
Services and the Cornell Science

Library.
Muguwe had been planning to
attend medical school next fall,
having already received offers of
admission from the University of
of
Virginia,
University
Washington St. Louis, and the
Cornell-Rockefeller and SloapKettering Cancer
Institute.
However, upon receiving word
that he had been awarded a
Rhodes scholarship, he decided to
defer his enrollment in medical

school for one year to study pharmacology at Oxford University.
"Oxford is a culturally rich
place where I can find some of the
best science in the world. The

Rhodes has been associated with
some of the most talented individuals and I thought it would be
great to be in such company. It's a
group of people whom I consider

to be big dreamers; they have big
goals for the world in which they
live. Interacting with them would
also widen my personal horizons
and goals in life," Muguwe said.
Amongst Muguwe's goals are
to continue research on the treatment for HIV and to contribute to

the healthcare system back home
in Zimbabwe. "One problem of
note at this stage [in Zimbabwe's
healthcare system] is the exodus
of professionals like doctors and
teachers to more developed countries. In terms of the structure of
the healthcare system, Zimbabwe
lacks a cutting-edge research culture that is found in developed

countries.
We allocate
our
resources to the most critical
areas, so research immediately
falls by the wayside. I am a strong
advocate of research even on a
small scale because I think devel-

oping countries would benefit
from researching problems that
are specific to them," he said.
Muguwe also hopes to find a
solution to the HIV endemic in
Zimbabwe, perhaps by making
treatment more affordable and
accessible. "The situation at present could be better in terms of
controlling HIV and treating
those who are affected by it.
Science has come up with drugs

that can prolong the lifespan of
people who are infected, but countries like Zimbabwe have difficulty accessing these drugs because
they're currently very expensive.

Many people die within two to
five years of infection, as opposed
to up to 20 years or more if people
had access to drugs. This makes a
huge difference in terms of economics; able-bodied individuals
will be infected, and children will
lose their parents before they get
a chance to go through their education. I think the drugs we have
would eliminate that problem,"
he said.

Muguwe
that the
Swarthmore experience has been
vital in shaping his interests and
preparing him to take advantage
of opportunities such as the
Rhodes scholarship.

was a very narrow-minded individual when I came here. I've
undergone a major intellectual
transformation that came about
by taking courses in economics,
philosophy, and sociology instead
of just science, and also from

backgrounds,
beliefs, and intellectual differences. I think that has been by far

the most enriching thing," he

Philadelphia nian they helieve is the individual who made
early-morning calls to more than three dozen female students last semester. Working with the borough police and
the Delaware. County district attorney's office, the college
will charge the man, whose identity has not been released,
with harassment. A maximum sentence of 90 days, imprisonment and a $3OO fine plus court costs could be imposed.
In an e-mail sent to students who had received the calls
and obtained by The Phoenix, Director of" Public Safety
Owen Redgrave said the man had
a' written
statement admitting he made calls to various Swarthmore
College phone numbers, allegedly on the pretext of finding
a female student he had met-in a Philadelphia-night club."
If the man pleads guilty, about which Redgrave said he
was- "optimistic" due to the written' statement, there
would not be a hearing' and students would not be
required to testify. The case could be resolved in a few'
days or it could take several months, depending on how
the man pleads and whether appeals are initiated after
the fact. Students may still be called to testify if the
charges are contested.
The process for identifying the individual took some
•time, according to Redgrave, because at first the phone
calls were not criminal in nature.-"lnitially the calls didn't
qualify as a crime," he said.
"I believe the district

approved taking on this case primarily because of the sizable number of similar calls," Redgrave said in an e-mail.

they use the same film over and over, and
after so many days it's grainy and not of
very much use to the investigators. But
these photos were outstanding," he said.
Public Safety also has trouble investigating credit card thefts because students
often do not continue working with Public
Safety after initially reporting the theft.
"Most people don't incur financial loss
from credit cards, so many of them don't
follow up with us," Redgrave said.

Redgrave.

On Sunday, Dec. 12, 2004, around 3:00
p.m., a student's credit cards were taken
from his backpack while it was left unattended in Sharpies. Before he could cancel
the cards, purchases were made along
Baltimore Pike at Target, Kohl's, the
Springfield Mall and a Mobil station in
Morton, Redgrave said. The purchases at
Target were caught on the security camera.
The individuals in the photo have not
yet been identified, and Redgrave said he
hopes the college community may be able
to help with their identification. "We can't
say that the people in the photos are
responsible for other thefts, but they could
be. For that reason, we'd like the community to be aware," he said.
Although credit cards thefts happen
periodically on campus, Redgrave said it is
rare to have a situation such as this, where
there is actually potential to apprehend the

perpetrators. One reason is that, even if the
suspects are caught on a security camera,
the photos are rarely of high enough quali-

According to Redgrave, several other

credit card thefts have happened recently
"We certainly haven't had a crime spree,
but number of thefts this year has been a
little higher than average," he said.
A theft occurred in the men's bathroom
in the basement of Lang Performing Arts
Center between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. on
Sunday, Dec. 12, the same day as the theft
from Sharpies. It is not clear whether the
two incidents are related.
Additionally, Melissa Phruksachart 'O7
and another sophomore who asked not to
be named had credit cards stolen from
their bags on Monday, Jan. 17. "We had our

noticed some of her stuff was missing," she

said.
Phruksachart said she was surprised
the theft happened because there were a
number of people around at the time. "It
just makes me really paranoid," she said.
In order to prevent theft, Redgrave
advised students to keep their belongings

with them.

"Every theft

we've had this

year was unattended property," he said. He
also recommended keeping a list of credit
card numbers and company phone numbers so the cards can be canceled immediately if stolen. He stressed the importance
of immediately notifying public safety, as
well. "To know where crime on campus is

happening allows us to do our job more
effectively," he said.

Earlier this month, Liza Anderson 'O5 was named
Swarthmore's first-ever recipient of the George J.
Mitchell Scholarship. One of twelve scholarship winners chosen from a national applicant pool of 220
current students and recent graduates, Anderson
will use the scholarship to pursue a master's degree
in Ecumenics from Trinity College in Dublin,
Ireland.
In her graduate program, Anderson will study
interfaith relationships between Christianity and
other religions through a combination of fieldwork
and coursework, which will help her gain further
experience in developing interfaith community programs.
Anderson has been the college's interfaith intern
since her arrival here, and for over three years has
organized events between Swarthmore students' reli-

Anderson's mentor, commended Anderson for her
work. "I don't know anyone as young as Liza who's
done as much as she has," she said. "I'm impressed
with her depth of passion and the breadth of her
knowledge. She passionately cares about bringing people of different religions together

ground and building bridges."

While in Dublin, Anderson hopes

to travel to Jerusalem and return to Cairo.
Anderson's interest in interfaith dialogue stems
from what she described as a "quirky religious background." Though a member of the Anglican Church,
she was only confirmed this past April and has
intensely studied Islam and Judaism.
She chose to enter the Anglican Church because
of its principles of acceptance. "The Anglican

Church combines a lot of the tradition of the Catholic
Church that I really love
the Seven Sacraments
and the liturgy
but there's more flexibility in
social issues, like gay marriage."
From her perspective, multi-religious understanding is central to the Christian faith. "I would
argue that ecumenical and inter-religious relations
are an inherent Christian obligation, not something
tangential to Christianity," she said. "This was a way

echoed Tompkins' comments. "Liza is an extremely
diligent student. She's very excited about making a
change in the world and her record says that," Dubb
said. "She's really focused on interfaith dialogue and
she's so excited about it that she travels around the
world to further her work."
Dubb expressed hope that Anderson's achievement will raise campus interest in the Mitchell
Scholarship, which, though nationally prestigious,

The Mitchell Scholarship, inaugurated in 1998, is a
national scholarship program that supports one year
of graduate study in any academic field offered at an
institution of higher learning in Ireland or Northern
Ireland. According to its Web site, the scholarship is
"intended to familiarize and connect the next generation of American leadership with the island of
Ireland." The program provides tuition, housing and
stipends for living and international travel expenses.
It is named after former Sen. George J. Mitchell CDMaine) in honor of his contributions to the Northern

TMBG to play Swat in Feb.
Large-scale event chosen for appeal, affordability
BY ERIC MILES GLOVER

egloverl@swarthmore.edu

Last week's choice of alternative rock band

They Might Be Giants to be this year's large-scale
event was based on the band's widespread appeal
and affordability, according to members of the
Large-Scale Events Committe.
Veronica Lim 'O7, chair of the LSE, said the band
is a rock group that is "kind of characterized by
their quirkiness and unique lyrics." According to
committee member Jonathan Fombonne 'O5, "It's a
band that crosses a lot of musical tastes."
According to Lim, this was an important factor
in choosing the musical duo to play Swarthmore.
The six-member Large-Scale Events Committee
wanted an entertainment act that would appeal to
the interests of all students. The committee began
searching for an act the week after Thanksgiving

break by taking suggestions from students at the
top of Sharpies.

The Committee narrowed the
list of forty bands to three
bands: They Might Be Giants,
North Mississippi All-Stars and
The Magnetic Fields.
The committee walked away from Sharpies with
three loose-leaf sheets filled with suggestions for
comedians, bands and other entertainers. "We didn't get a lot of suggestions from the campus that
weren't [for] bands or comedians," Lim said. The
committee decided to search for a band because
they did not want to invite a comedian as the largescale event following Mitch Hedberg's show in
2004.
Using the list from Sharpies, the committee
compiled a list of forty bands from which to choose
an act. Each committee member was assigned a
band to research and given the task of obtaining
their standard offers.
The possibilities were narrowed from forty
bands to three: They Might Be Giants, North
Mississippi All-Stars and The Magnetic Fields, said
David McCandlish 'O5. These bands made the final
cut based on widespread appeal, name recognition
and cost.
"It was difficult to find acts that could fit within
our budget," Lim said in an e-mail. "Bands that
play at colleges our size often cost over $40,000 [dollars], not including tech costs."
The LSE hired They Might Be Giants for $15,000
dollars. In addition, the Committee will pay the
band for their technical equipment requirements
and hospitality costs, which total $B,OOO dollars,
according to Lim.
McCandlish had previous experience with the
planning of past Worthstocks and large-scale
events. He gave the committee advice and educated
them about the logistics involved in planning a
large-scale event.

McCandlish said that in the past the committee
had a "slow and inflexible structure." Last year, the
committee began their search for entertainment
late in the year, did not meet weekly and had a hard
time both delegating responsibility and choosing
an act to play the college, according to Lim. An initial proposal for a DJ show was scrapped by
Student Activities Coordinator Jenny Yim, leaving

the rest of the Large-Scale Events Committee "furious," according to the minutes of a Mar. 2, 2004

Student Council

meeting.

This year has been going more smoothly,
according to committee members. Having Lim

appointed to run the committee was a major
improvement, McCandlish said. Her role, a paid
position, was to lead and guide the committee to
keep it focused. The committee "started at the
beginning of the year and have been working consistently," McCandlish said.
Another improvement was that students could
more easily propose a large-scale event. In past
years, individual students had to propose an act to
the Large-Scale Events Committee in person. The
committee along with faculty members would then
choose the act that would play the college. This
year, the student-run committee makes the final
decision.
The large-scale event is sponsored by the

NEWS IN BRIEF

Saffran memorial to
be held tomorrow
A memorial service for economies professor Bernard Saffran
will be held tomorrow at the Swarthmore Friends Meeting House
at 4 pm.
The service will feature a number of speakers, including
College President Al Bloom, according to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l
After these speakers there will be an opportunity for anyone
who wishes to speak as well.
Except for the speakers who will open the memorial, "[the
service] is vep( similar to the way a Quaker Meeting would happen," Eldridge said.
After the service a reception is planned to be held in the
Whittier Room.
Saffran, who taught at Swarthmore for 37 years, died of a
heart attack Nov. 29, 2004, while visiting family in Montreal.
The Franklin and Betty Barr professor of economics, he was
well known for his regular column called "Recommendations for
Further Reading," which was published in the Journal of
Economic perspectives.
Saffran also served on the President's Council of Economic
Advisers in 1971-72 as Senior Staff Economist.
He is survived by a daughter and two grandchildren.
The memorial service is being planned by the economics
department.

Student Budget Committee, the Student Activities
Committee and the President's Office, Student
Budget Manager Sonya Hoo 'O5 said. The
President's Office contributes about $25,000 and the
Student Budget Committee contributes about

$5,000 yearly, she said, though these figures change
each year. The Social Affairs Committee helps the
Large-Scale Events Committee advertise the event
across the campus.
The large-scale event is open to Swarthmore students, staff and faculty only. LPAC's online electronic reservation system will be used to secure
tickets for the event. Students, staffand faculty will
receive an e-mail notification when they can begin
reserving tickets, according to Lim.
Lim said the Large-Scale Events Committee will
hire extra security to ensure the event remains for
the Swarthmore community only. She has already
received e-mails from students at nearby colleges
requesting to see the show. In 2002, tickets to the

Nickel Creek large-scale event were distributed to
the larger Tri-Co community after a reservation
period restricted to Swarthmore.
"The group has really high energy. Their music
is really interesting," Lim said. "Even if people
haven't heard them before, I think it will be very
easy [for them] to be entertained at the show."
"It's cheesy, goofy pop with a Swattie sensibility
to it," Fombonne said.
They Might Be Giants has released sixteen
albums in their twenty-year musical career and
won a 2002 Grammy Award for the song "Boss of
Me," the theme to the syndicated television sitcom
"Malcolm in the Middle." The band also created
music for "The Daily Show" and the film "Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me."
The show will take place in the Lang Performing
Arts Center on Feb. 19, with the band Common
Rotation opening.

professional journalist will be hired by the
college to help oversee the program.
According to Gelber, the administration
has agreed to fund the journalist's salary,
and students and faculty involved in the
program have already begun interviewing
young journalists for the job.
Burke and fellow history professor
Marge Murphy, who also helped in the program's creation, would both like to see student volunteers receive academic credit for
reporting for the program.
"It will be a big time commitment,"
Murphy said. "We were here all weekend
for a half-hour show."
For those who are interested in the program but are unable to commit to large
amounts of time, Murphy hoped the college
will offer an option to do "audit" work for
the broadcast.
Murphy and Burke believe offering
credit for students' reporting and editing
work will further legitimize the program.
"I'd like to see a more professional journalism option available to students," Murphy
said.
"As a history professor, I see a lot of
students who are interested in careers in
journalism. After all, journalism is the first
draft of history," she said.

it will air five days a week on the

This will happen as soon as the students
and faculty involved work out the last

logistical issues, according to Barboni.

These include the recruiting of more
students, hiring a professional journalist to

serve as an advisor to the group, which
should occur before the end of the weekend, purchasing sound equipment that the
administration has agreed to fund, and
training student volunteers to use this
equipment.

"We're hoping Swarthmore
can do with the telephone
what networks can't do
with the camera."

producer for CBS News
Other than the expense of a professional
journalist and a small amount of new
equipment, funds needed for the program
will be minimal, according to Gelber.
"Radio and telephone just aren't very
expensive," he said. "And we should have
no problem finding young journalists in
Iraq who are looking for an outlet for their
work."
Gelber hopes that the broadcast will
eventually be linked to a public radio station, but until then he believes the program
will bring thousands more people to the
Swarthmore Web site, and thus a greater

media attention to the college.
"No one else is doing this, and for the
college to provide this public service it
would further show the nation how unique
Swarthmore is," Gelber said.
Tonight's meeting for the Iraq radio
group will be held in Kohlberg 115 at 7 p.m.

Outdoor toilet mystery baffles college
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu
The appearance of two toilets and a sink at the top
of Parrish Beach about two weeks ago has become the
first great enigma of the new year at Swarthmore.
A recent investigation about possible reasons for
the open-air bathroom came up empty. Debate on campus about the toilets has centered on whether they are
an art project or a new initiative by the administration
to make relieving oneself more accessible.
Jake Beckman 'O5, creator of the oversized
Adirondack chair that sits on Parrish Beach in the fall
and spring, vehemently denied any involvement. "I
wasn't involved and I have no clue who put them
there," he said in an e-mail.
Yet Dwight Smith 'OB was still convinced of the toi-

lets' artistic value. "They are work of genius," he said.
He was, however, willing to consider their possible
practical uses. "I haven't examined them to see if
they're functioning," he said.
If they had been used, then it would seem as though
the plumbing is in working order: No yellow snow
could be found in the immediate vicinity of the
makeshit bathroom.
Dean Bob Gross '62 seemed to be more on the functionalist side of the debate, but saw more practical
options than an outdoor bathroom in an environment
that has recently experienced near-freezing temperatures and just days after a snow storm that dropped

about a foot of snow. "I was more interested in [the toilets] before I found the men's room across the hall," he
said.
And so as long as the mystery remains, so do the
tough questions: Is itart? Is it just a toilet? Is Bob Gross
really that lazy?

ALEX LEADER-SMITH
The Prodigal Prodigy

NELSON!!! Here in the flesh was
the iconic rebel, the stalwart
enemy of corporate malfeasance,
the valiant David to Diebold's
ugly Goliath. Sure, I'd known
Nelson since freshman orientation, but never before had I seen
tucked away in
him like this
his underground Fortress of
Solitude, preaching to a legion of
like-minded Free Culturalists,
plotting his next strike against
the tyranny of copyright. The
SCCS Media Lounge
does
remarkable things to a man's
complexion. And there I was,
soaking it all in.
I went to Free Culture head-

quarters hoping to get a

whiff of The Next Big Thing. I'd watched
national news outlets laud Nelson Pavlosky 'O6 for Free Culture's
stunning legal triumph over Diebold, and I wanted a piece of that
fame. I've managed some terrific accomplishments at Swat: twelve
weeks ofconsecutive Sharpies breakfasts, a nine-day-long homework
abstention, and soon-to-be-four years at Swat without seeing the
inside of a science lab. Yet none of these triumphs had The New York
Times beating a path to my door. Clearly populist activism was the

real ticket to fame and fortune.
Indeed, the Free Culturalists themselves wanted to make a splash.
They were like Steven Spielberg post-"Jaws": they had a career-defining
success behind them, but were still looking for bigger fish to fry. I thought
I might rally these activists off their laurels, but their whiteboard already
overflowed with ideas. These guys were thinking big, and they wouldn't
chase some old broadcast flag DFM whoziwhatzit mumbo-jumbo. They
wanted pizzazz, they wanted sex appeal, they wanted a campaign everyone could embrace. They wanted, in other words, open access academic
journals
because if rigged elections are America's #1 free culture concern, classified information on Joyce and the sublime is clearly #2.

I was also impressed by Free Culture's brilliant multi-tasking
balanced talk of their national campaign with efforts to bring Free

to hold a debate between a Free Culture leader and a high-profile procopyright executive. If only other Swat groups were so open-minded!
Earthlust could invite Dick Cheney to defend the Bush administration's
energy policy. Animal Rights Coalition could host a dinner with Jim
Perdue. And how better to emphasize women's issues than Feminist

group that couldn't use a dash of debate and a pinch of controversy.
As talks swirled of Cooper Grants and national caucuses, I realized
I'd seen what I'd come for: the birth of a campaign destined for greatness. It's only a matter of time before the free culture paparazzi flock to
this new crusade, battling to gain exclusive Nelson photographs to distribute free of charge on the Internet. Yet something held me back, and
I knew what it was: this Fortress of Solitude already has its Superman.
What could I add to them? I couldn't gain renown by riding Free

THE PHOENIX

author Louise Gliick addressed Swarthmore students, faculty and local residents. The event, sponsored by the Cooper Foundation and the English
department, brought out a sizable crowd and filled
the LPAC cinema.
The former U.S. poet laureate read selections
from her new book, "October." Introduced by
Professor Nathalie Anderson as a poet who
"forces wrenching examinations of family and
self," Louise Gliick discussed personal drama
and tragedy in her second selection, "Prism," a
piece about the myths of romantic love and family life. But her other two works were about wildly different topics. Her third poem, titled
"October," was a deeply private meditation on the
attacks of Sept. 11. Political but not in a conventional sense, with no direct references to the
event itself, "October" expressed her desire for a
safe place to live and told how the events of the
day made her realize that yearning was futile.
"On a basic level, it's a poem about the end of the
world," she told the audience before reading.
Not surprisingly, "October" generated ample
student response. "I'm usually irritated when
artists go into 9/11, but the way she did it was very
unique," Rachel Aucott 'OB said. Katy Feniello 'OB
agreed. "The poem that I paid attention to the most
was the one that was the most human," she said.
Earlier that day, students were able to meet
with Gliick in a more intimate setting for a question-and-answer session. There, she touched upon
a variety of topics such as her life as an artist, her
work and the creative process, as well as her philosophy of poetry.
On being a poet, she said, "One of the advantages of being young and unknown is having this
constant criticism, having all those workshops and
conferences. When you have a reputation, you
worry that people are saying things to please you."
Gliick said she enjoys working with young writers,

particularly undergraduates, because they are
January 27, 2005

"constantly exposed to originality, and I feel that it
will make me a better writer." The 62-year-old poet
taught at Williams College for 20 years, and has
recently taken up a post as writer-in-residence at
Yale.
Gliick seized the opportunity to dispense
advice to the poets attending the afternoon session. In response to a question on what bothers
her the most about poetry, Gliick told the audience that her greatest gripe was when a poet feels
he must prove to his reader that he is well-read or
has to contrive his poems to make them seem

sophisticated, something she considers a kind of
fraud. In contrast, she identified the presence of a
fresh, new voice as the most appealing factor in
contemporary poetry.

Gliick's work has evolved considerably over

many years and 12 books, from traditional collections of poetry to long sequences of poems with
common themes. Her 1993 work "The Wild Iris,"
was in this trademark style, involving a discourse between flowers of a garden, the gardener,
and an unnamed god. It ultimately won the

Pulitzer Prize for poetry. During the informal session a few hours before the reading, Gliick admitted to students that she considered writing in a
book-like style a risk. She then explained how fellow poets like Mark Strand and Robert Pinsky,
the latter a former U.S. Poet Laureate himself,
helped her find her voice and catalyze in her a
burst of creativity that led to "Meadowlands," the
bold 1996 follow-up to "Wild Iris" that combined
the collapse of her own marriage with the plot
and characters of Homer's "Odyssey."
When asked if she identifies with the
Romantic poets, Gliick replied, "My tastes are
I like the stern, classical
much more austere
mind." She added, however, that she considered
her writing to be akin to William Blake's. Indeed,
critics have long characterized her work as stark,
emotional and lyrical, with a unique and austere
voice.
Gliick is also the author of "Proofs and
Theories," a collection of essays centered on literature and criticism, which won the
PEN/Martha Albrand Award for Nonfiction.

Philly museum celebrates Dali's 100th
BY CAMILA HARRIGAN-LABARCA
charrigl@swarthmore.edu

The first time I met Salvador, I
was eight years old. My mother and I
were at Borders Books and I was sitting on the floor of the Art section. I

enjoyed flipping randomly through
the various art books, and on this day
I was struck by one in particular: a
collection of the paintings of Salvador
Dali. His strange pictures shocked me
and the images have stayed with me
ever since. His work now elicits different sentiments within me, sentiments beyond fear and confusion. His
vision of the Spanish Civil War,
depicted in a piece called "Soft
Construction with Boiled Beans," displays mangled body parts with a
breast being horrifically squeezed by

some other unrecognizable piece of
flesh.
As a surrealist painter, Dali creates works of art that toe the line
between comfortable reality and a
dream world of harsh landscapes and
distorted figures. He takes familiar
a watch,
elements of everyday life
a tree, a nude human body
and
combines them with the hallucinogenic surroundings of his inner
thoughts to paint an indecipherable
paranormal world. It's a little bit dis-

couraging that his dreams and his
waking experiences are more interesting than even my craziest fantasies, but that's all the more reason
to indulge in his (exponentially more
entertaining) imaginary world.
Swarthmore college students will
be excited to hear that the
Philadelphia Museum of Art will be
bringing Dali's surrealist art to Philly

in celebration of the 100th anniversary
of the Spanish
birth. From
Feb. 16 until May 15, Salvador will be
visiting America to infiltrate people's
minds with his dream-like, sometimes
nightmarish paintings. PMA will be
the only American museum to host a
major centennial retrospective exhibition on Dali. That's not to say that
other museums haven't shown Dali's
work, but this is the most work ever to
be in one space in the United States.
We are extremely lucky to be so close
to such revolutionary art.
The exhibition will feature not only
Dali's most well-known work, but also
his early cubist-influenced pieces and
some of his late works, in which he
experimented with optical illusions.
No less than two hundred works will
be shown. Paintings such as "The
Weaning
of Furniture-Nutrition"
(1934), "Still Life-Fast Moving" (1956)

and the famous "Soft Construction
with Boiled Beans" (1936) will be on
display, among others.
Up until now everything I've mentioned sounds great, doesn't it? But
there is a catch. The cost to view Dali's
work at the Philadelphia Museum of
Art is $17.00 for students (that's you,
Swatties). This will leave a dent in
your pockets, but I for one plan to
cough up the cash for a ticket. There's
no way of knowing when something
like this could come to the U.S., much
less Philadelphia, again.
I hope that those of you who have

never had the opportunity to see Dali's
work on canvas will join the art lovers
of Philadelphia to see this exhibit. For
the curious and avid Swarthmore
mind this should be a wonderful experience.

ration is.
Take the Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. These
bad boys are rolling around the surface of Mars taking pictures of rocks and dirt, lots and lots of rock and dirt. No
camels, just rocks and dirt. The rovers themselves are
pretty badass, and apparently they're the size of golf carts

10

...I can't wait to check 'em out, but wait, they're stranded
...on fucking Mars. Total cost for rocks and two semi-cool
rovers that I'll never get to see: $6OO million-billion.
As if this wasn't enough, we got to hear about the wonderful journey of exploration to Titan. Grown men cried in
Europe when Huygens started beaming data back to earth.
As David Southwood, Director of Science at the European
Space Agency, put it, "I didn't know how to express how
scientists felt last week and I ended up quoting poetry. You
have to understand: this is exploration, not just science."
Hmmm, sounds to me like a man who's never had sex.
Contrary to Mr. Southwood's assertions, Huygens sucked
more than the Mars Rovers. First, at least the pictures of
Mars were in color. The pix that Huygens took of Titan
were in black and white, and because Huygens was plummeting at high speeds towards its ultimate death on
Titan's surface, most of them were blurry. I guess NASA
couldn't spend the money on a decent camera, but all I
know is that my $350 Nikon Coolpix 4300 could take better
pictures than that tin can. As if this wasn't enough,
Huygens was only designed to last one minute on the surface of Titan but ended up lasting an hour. So now, after
scrutinizing some shitty photos, we've determined that
Titan is one big flammable ball of shit. This isn't an exaggeration; apparently it rains methane on Titan, and do you
all know what methane smells like? That's right: shit. But
if we were genuinely interested in this 'shit,' you'd think
we could have spent the few extra bucks to give Huygens a
roll cage and some off-road radials so it could cruise
around on this ball of liquid noxious gas. Then those losers
who are actually interested in this stuff could have gotten
a few good nights out of it. Total cost: 3 gazillion Euros. We
could have funded a war in North Korea, Iran and Syria
for the total cost of this exploration, but apparently the
new axis of evil is Titan, Saturn and Jupiter (shhh, we

haven't told Jupiter yet).

a better idea: they used a pencil. They also sent dogs into

Fighting the cold,
a layer at a time
Napoleon seemed to have it all: absolute power, his own complex, and a funky
bicorne hat. Yet even Old Boney, in the throes of megalomania, could not outwit the
harsh Russian winter. Swarthmore is home to a number of people who believe they
are God, but in January they, like Napoleon, are just as susceptible to the pain of that
exposed swath of skin between glove and sleeve. Sure, it seemed like a short walk
when you left your dorm. But as you pass the frozen bodies of your underdressed
peers on the way to Kolhberg, you realize that this winter, Mother Nature is a force
to be reckoned with. "Poor bastard," you think, stepping over the guy who once sat
next to you in Econ. You stare at his face, now fixed in a ghastly mockery of a grin.
Then you pry the travel mug from his cold, dead hands and go home to wrap up in

another layer.

Stylistic Devices

Such incidents make us re-evaluate
our priorities. Do I call my parents
enough? Should I really be an English
major? What gives my life meaning?
And, most of all, do I care that wearing
these three sweaters makes me look
fat? The arrival of arctic weather often
seems to require that we supplant chic
form with bulky function. Gone are the
moccasins, the fetching slacks, the
Bedazzled™ jean jacket. Gone is the
casually tousled hair, the sexy unbuttoned collars, the joy, the laughter. In
order to keep warm, we resign ourselves to dowdiness and desperately
attempt to wear everything we own all
at once. The end result usually leaves
us with the boxy shape and limited
mobility of a fire hydrant.
Layering is a clever strategy to beat
the weather, but it can backfire when
done impulsively.

With a little forethought, one can stay both
toasty and relatively proportional. Take, for example, thermal underwear. Investing in a thin thermal undershirt, long-sleeved or no-sleeved, is an
efficient move. Designed by America's best, ski
clothing specifically engineered for this weather
can have the power of ten cotton layers and thus
cuts down on bulkiness. If you can stomach
them, long-johns (named after long-forgotten
pugilist John L. Sullivan, we swear) separate the boys from the men. We direct you
to Muhammad Jowza 'O7 or Reshma Pattni
'O6 for advice on the long-john lifestyle.
In cold weather, the dress-over-pants
combo actually has a purpose besides indie
stylishness, but it must be executed correctly. A flattering length is usually a
hand's breadth above the knee (middle
school teachers be damned!). Widely
flared jeans and baggy pants disrupt the
line of the dress, which looks best when
it is loose-fitting and avoids hugging the
obvious outlines of all your other layers. Dresses with flared skirts or
a shirtdress,
straight, loose outlines
for example
look great over pants and
keep you cozy.
Pantyhose are also woefully underrated. For those with luxuriant leg hair,
pantyhose can be uncomfortable, but tights
are a perfect solution for chilly legs. They are
thin enough to wear unobtrusively under pants
and those who have not tried them should seri-

'In Good Company' a
fun corporate fairy tale
BY ABIGAIL GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu

Paul Weitz, director of the sex, pastry,
and sex-with-pastry romp "American Pie,"
is a man on a mission to prove that he is a
more than a brief blip on our cultural radar.
To distance himself from his youthful transgressions, he has turned to making films
like 2002's "About a Boy" and now "In Good
Company," whose romantic subplots get top
publicity billing but which feature relationships of a less-explored nature. How different is "In Good Company" from "American
Pie"? Well, when a film's primary (and non-

jokes.

With "In Good Company" and "About a
Boy," Weitz is beginning to demonstrate welcome signs of maturity. He has a knack for
presenting characters quirky enough to be
interesting but not so wacky as to be
unwatchable. But where "About a Boy" bril-

liantly toed the line between Richard Curtis
and Wes Anderson, "In Good Company" has
difficulty finding its narrative line. Too
often it forgets that its magic lies in realms

outside the underdeveloped romantic sub-

plot.

the film's screenplay, has given us Dan

"To Build a Fire" that we all had to read in ninth

who freezes to death in the Alaskan wilderness,

to make a fire?
If we can take anything from that tale, it's that
dogs are smarter than people, and that fixating on
your last match can distract you from the larger problem at hand, e.g. impending death. Creative thinking is
key in these harsh conditions, and that goes for fashion as well as survival but keep an

executive contently rounding into his 50s
who is demoted in a corporate takeover and
discovers that his new boss is the half-hisage wunderbrat Carter Duryea (Topher
Grace). The awkward merry-go-round that
is Dan and Carter's relationship lies at the
heart of the film, and the multifaceted tone
Weitz lends his principle players keeps the
pulse going. Quaid isn't going through a
cliched midlife crisis a la Richard Gere in
"Shall We Dance?" He's a satisfied family
man displaced by the changing pace of the
corporate America in which he just can't
keep up. Carter's obnoxious buzzword babble, on the other hand, hides a deeply-rooted
insecurity about his chosen life.
One of the endearing qualities of "In
Good Company" is that it's not on either
Dan or Carter's side. Dan is the paradigm of
an honest old-timer
a corporate worker
who cares about his clients. Before his per-

fection becomes nauseating, the film gives
us a scene where Dan comes out looking oldfashioned and lost. He may have worked

January 27, 2005

longer, but his qualifications to keep up
with the changing pace of business are seriously in doubt. Carter's shortcomings are
more obvious (he uses of the word "synergy'
in everyday speech), but he's also nervous
and genuinely eager for his department to
succeed. "In Good Company" could easily
have been a pleasing comedy about crossgenerational misunderstanding in corporate America, where experience is pitted
against vitality.
It's too bad that Weitz didn't think that
he had enough material right there to work
with. He goes ahead and throws in Scarlett
Johansson as Alex, Dan's collegiate daughter who becomes romantically entangled
with Carter quicker than you can say "plot
device." In the modern movie atmosphere,
where high school students commonly display the kind of sexual wiles Paris Hilton
would envy, it's refreshing to have a young
woman display an imperfect grasp of
romance, and the seduction scene between
Alex and Carter in Alex's dorm room is
sweetly awkward. But the lovers' (understandable) decision to conceal their relationship from Dan only detracts from the
more intriguing Dan/Carter relationship.
Why not milk the comic and narrative
potential of watching Dan deal with both his
boss' youth and his daughter's sexuality
instead of relegating it to a single moment of
shocked discovery? Because the romantic
subplot is hidden from the film's main character, it has little effect on most of action
and ends up feeling superfluous.
Unable to reconcile these threads into
one cohesive story, the script tends to run
out of steam. Weitz rarely misses the obvi
ous joke; as Carter salivates over his new
Porsche, you just know he's not going to get
far with it intact (and waddaya know, it's
sideswiped as he pulls out of the dealership).
Integrating the subplot into the main story
would perhaps have prevented the screenplay for going once too often for the cheap

laugh.
An intriguing movie is buried here,
somewhere, in the stockpile of the cute and
cliche that often overwhelms "In Good
Company." At times, you're even under the
impression that the filmmakers know it and
are laboriously trying to excavate their plot
from under Scarlett Johannson's lips. Their
level of success depends on your preferences
for the oft-rhapsodized romantic love versus
the lesser-publicized fraternal sort. Me, I'll
take two messed-up guys and a snappy
screenplay any day.

jazz world.
The Gold Sparkle Trio, GSB minus Rob Mallard
(sax/flute), features Charles Waters (sax/clarinet), Andrew
Barker (drums) and Adam Roberts (bass) delicately playing
the line between loose composition and collective improvisation.
Now on tour after a date with free jazz leader Ken
Vandermark, the Trio's stop in Philadelphia is an exciting
event for anyone interested in contemporary jazz.
The Gold Sparkle Trio will perform an 8 p.m. show at the
Slought Foundation (4017 Walnut St., Philadelphia) on Friday,
Jan. 28. Student tickets are $lO and parking is free.

Ethics 101: Meet the Ethics Committee

AVIVA ARON-DINE

SARAH COHODES
ELISABETH OPPENHEIMER
The Ethics Committee
So what qualifies us to answer your
ethics questions? Well, we're writing a col-

umn and you're not. Other than that, not
much, except that we often sit around in
Sharpies trying to solve each other's ethical
crises.
This column won't work unless you email us your questions. We want your connot
crete, messy, petty ethical hang-ups
earth-shattering moral conundrums. If the
best moral philosophers of our time haven't

12

figured out whether, say, capital punishment is moral, neither will we. We're writing this column because we're interested in
day-to-day ethics at Swarthmore.
We'll let you know where each of us is
coming from. Elisabeth's moral compass is
oriented by some combination of the
Sermon on the Mount, Miss Manners, many
history classes and her parents. She runs to
her friends when she has a problem (sometimes she calls this Aristotelian ethics.)
When in doubt, Sarah does what she
thinks her mother would do. Usually, this
means taking the most pragmatic route possible. Not coincidentally, she's an econ
major.
Aviva, daughter of a rabbi and a physicist, considers herself a rationalist. This
means she's writing a philosophy thesis on
metaethics but ultimately does what her
parents would do.
To get a sense of what our ethical viewpoints are and decide which of us you can

trust, take this quiz. Our own answers are
at the end. Warning: consistent ethical systems not guaranteed.
L If the SEPTA conductor doesn't see

that you don't have a ticket and you can get
off the train without paying, you:
A: Woohoo!
B: Don't pay, but feel crushing guilt
later.
C: Find the conductor and pay, because
you feel a special obligation to support pub-

lie transportation.
D: Find the conductor and pay, because
you feel you should support systems you

regularly use.
2. You got drunk at a party and cheated
on your significant other and you're never
ever ever going to do it again. Should you
tell your significant other?
A: Yes. Relationships can't exist in the
midst of a lie that big.
B: Yes, for me, but I can't generalize.
C: No, but this only works once; after
that you can't trust yourself.
D: No. Let the guilt be your punishment.
3. You involved several professors in
designing a special major. After they've put
in significant time, you decide you're not

should:
A: Back out. Why should the professors
do even more work when you're not getting
anything out of it?
B: Stick with it. You made a commitment, now follow through. If you back out,
you're making life harder for the next kid

really interested. You

who has a special major.
4. You have a crush on someone who's in
a serious relationship. Can you tell them
how you feel?

A: No. Why bother?
B: Yes, if it's taking over your life.
C: Yes. If the relationship is strong, they
can deal with it.
5. Example of a question not to send us:
It seems like the reason human life

January 27,

2005

deserves special respect is because human
beings have a capacity for thought
unequaled by other beings. Why do we still
owe respect to people whose capacities are
profoundly diminished?
A: We respect those people as a way of
maintaining our respect for people as a

whole.

B: Every person has a soul.
C: This disagreement is silly. It's clear
what you should do.
D: Peter Singer, shut up.
6. What should you dp about your ethical
problems?
A: Write to us, and get a witty and helpful answer
B: Write to Randy Cohen at the New
York Times Magazine and get a supercilious and ethically suspect answer.
C: Stew in your own juices.
D: Shriek in horror and despair.

Our answers:
Aviva: 1: C and D; 2: C; 3: A; 4: A; 5: A;
6: A.
Sarah: 1: B; 2: D; 3: A; 4: B; 5: C and D;
6: A.
Elisabeth: 1: D; 2: B; 3: B; 4: C kinda; 5:

B; 6: A.
We look forward to your letters (e-mail
or campus mail). Anonymity guaranteed.

Our news niche
People in campus media keep wondering whether
we as mere students can ever accomplish anything
beyond reporting on short-term, minor issues in our
own communities. We lack the colossal supply of
money, time and connections that seem necessary to
gain firsthand access to major news events and press
conferences. Is there a reason for the movers and
shakers of the world to respect students wielding
pens? One answer to that question is the Nightly Iraq
War Summary.
Large-scale commercial newsgathering is increasingly the provenance of larger and larger media conglomerates, for whom every news piece is a major
investment of resources. To justify the expense of
sending reporters to a distant and dangerous environment like Iraq, mainstream news organizations
have no choice but to go for the major headline stories, the exciting photo ops, the interviews with
famous public figures and stories told from so close
to the seats of power can't help but be distorted for
political gain.
An atmosphere of cutthroat competition and polit-

ical pressure leaves no room for the smaller human
stories, the day-to-day record of events that is ultimately the only way to build a detailed picture of a

faraway place.
This is where the voices from the margins come
into play. It's the blogs, diaries, personal memoirs and
letters home from ordinary people that tell the story
of a war, and it's precisely those small bits and pieces
that today's high-profile reporters are unable to see
from their lofty posts in pressrooms.
The Vietnam War holds a unique place in our history because it was the first war in quite some time
that ordinary Americans learned about in close
detail, as television cameras gained the power to
transmit images and interviews directly from war
zones, and scenes of warfare that had once been dry
text in government press releases became living
sights and sounds.
Now, as we've become desensitized to images and
TV news has found its power to dig up hidden stories
in Iraq increasingly curtailed, those of us interested
in getting the truly interesting and illuminating stories out of Iraq must look to other sources. Time will
tell how effective a tool phone-call interviews with
ordinary Iraqs will be, but David Gelber '63 proved
something similar could work for Vietnam forty
years ago, and if anyone has the insight, passion and
will to replicate that success today, we believe
Swarthmore students do.

Dear Phoenix:
I am delighted that Swarthmore

has adopted President Bloom's living
wage proposal, modest as it is.
Anything that helps lives of lowincome people is a good thing.
However, there is one negative
aspect to both the specific proposal
adopted and the entire living wage
movement. It is strictly a top down

enterprise

a sort of handout from

the affluent and comfortable (members of the college's board and
administration, supported by some of
the faculty and students) to the poor
and hardworking. It is given, by the
grace of the generosity and "ethical"
Januarv 27. 2005

(whatever

that means) impulses of
the givers. In other words, it has the
odor of charity, in the 19th century

sense: something that has been handed out to the needy but in no way
earned.
I suggest that those who support

the interests of the lowest-paid on-

campus employees
as opposed to
the abstraction of a "living wage"
and all the related high-sounding
blah, blah, blah
should move to
take things to the next step: collective bargaining, by which the college
workers negotiate for their wages
and benefits as a matter of right, not
merely largesse. In short, their

friends in the Swarthmore community should encourage and aid the lowest-paid workers to become unionized. Wages and benefits won by collective action as union members will,
in the best tradition of American capitalism, be fairly gained in the give
and take of the market and not characterized as overcompensation. And
for those among the students, faculty
and administration who think that
the newly unionized workers are
already overpaid, the impact of a
strike of, say, a month or two would
be a consciousness-raising experience.

Summers' remarks were misplaced. But let's be clear: Summers was right. The male
and female brains are different, having evolved under
different sexual pressures and different survival pressures. It would be wholly surprising, in fact, if different
kinds of cognitive ability were not emphasized differently in our different brains.
(I realize, though, that Swatties mostly don't see much

bibliography of Simon Baron-Cohen's "The Essential
Difference." Matt Ridley's "The Red Queen: Sex and the
Evolution of Human Nature" explains why the disparity

relations, which you would expect to be dominated by
females on Baron-Cohen's account of the female brain as
"empathizer." Guess what. It is.
This time, though, we can't simply infer from that
dominance that the path to the public relations profession is slanted against men. Why? Because we expect
women to do better than men. How much better? We
don't know and have no way of knowing. But the point is
that underrepresentation doesn't prove unfairness if the
groups can be expected to perform differently in the first
place. Instead, one would have to identify exactly where
often a tall order,
along the path bias has occurred
especially in a post-feminist world.
Which raises the real question: if there's no
systemic slant to be found, is there anything to try to fix?

Some would say yes. They would ask us to consider
the physically handicapped, who are disadvantaged
through no fault of their own. Were we not to assist them,
the physically handicapped could be "expected" to be
nearly infinitely underrepresented in many fields; after
all, they would be at a huge disadvantage. But is that a
reason not to give them a leg up? Surely the opposite is
true. One should have the same chances of successfully
pursuing one's dreams whether or not one is statistically disadvantaged, and so, by this account, we should educate and shape society until sex representation in as
many fields as possible reflects society's as closely as possible.

But some would say no. They would ask us to consider elections, where some candidates are clearly more likable and charismatic than others. Surely it's not Joe
Lieberman's fault that he's not charismatic. He doesn't
deserve it. And if Joe's opponent is more charismatic
than Joe, that's because he was born and raised that way;
he doesn't deserve his charisma in any true sense of

desert.

The consequences of sex-based differences are profound, and it's far from clear what we should do about
them. One of these consequences is that we cannot know
whether a segment of society is unfair to women (or to
men) by looking just at end results. This is a departure
from what we're used to. We know, for instance, that
there continues to be something unjust at work with

And yet we don't compensate Joe in the polls for
being uncharismatic. Even though the disadvantage is
out ofhis control, we think it's important that the "best"
candidate get the job
and a similar argument could be
made for the PR firm, or the tenure-track physics post.
On this account, it's best and fairest to ensure only that
there are no barriers to fulfilling one's individual potential. Society shouldn'tbe artificially manipulated to fit a
preconceived idea of proportional representation.

No pride in being shamed into morality
Dear Editor:

Upon reading Taru Taylor's col-

umn "No dilemmas for men of
honor" (Jan. 20, pg. 15), I found
myself simultaneously confused and
dismayed. I was merely confused by
his conclusion, because although I
gather that he intended to make a
point akin to the "Garvey good,
Dußois bad" anthem that has run
through many of his columns, that
anthem seems to be as elaborate as
that part of his message gets. I was
dismayed, however, by the arguments he made leading up to it.
First, Taru seems to be misusing
the terms "shame culture" and "guilt
culture." This is honestly not something I am an expert on, but it seems
to me that shame cultures, driven by
how you are viewed by those around
you, are not quite the wonderful
moral ideal that Taru makes them
out to be. Let's say, for example, that

culture, I'd protest my innocence
and struggle to exonerate myself. In
a shame culture, I'd be dishonored
by others' perception of me as a murderer, even if I were innocent.

THE PHOENIX

Now, let's take the opposite
example. I just murdered someone,
and nobody knows. In a guilt culture, it doesn't totally matter that
nobody has found out; it affects my
internal state. Provided I do think
murder is wrong, the fact that
nobody knows does not change the
fact that I feel guilt. In a shame culture, this is different. In a shame
culture, it is the social knowledge
and disapproval of these deeds that
informs dishonor. I can lie, cheat,
steal and kill, and if I don't get
caught or no one blames me for it, I
have no reason to feel bad.
This is a clear counterexample to
Taru's assertion that shame culture
is somehow more "moral." In fact,
absent rigid rules regarding honor
and dishonor and right and wrong,
without an external moral authority
to impose judgments, the emotion of

shame has no moral value at all.

Most disturbing, therefore, was
the manner in which Taru is led by
these requirements of shame culture
to introduce ritual suicide, as practiced by Japanese samurai in the
form of seppuku, as a cultural posi-

tive. To propose instituting such

rigidly defined social norms that a
severe enough deviation from others' expectations must be remedied
by death, to suggest that a society
should go to such an extreme as to

pressure individuals into suicide
due to dishonor and leave them no
other form of agency or opportunity
to argue their innocence is an ideal
that I honestly cannot admire, only

revile.

While it is true that there is much

benefit in an interconnectionist
rather than individualist view of
society, I feel that Taru woefully
misses the mark in his column. In
fact, it seems that in his last paragraph, what Taru is saying, if anything, is that what is best for blacks
is to promote the good of whatever
specific view he has of the "black
race," rather than striving to
achieve what is best for all black people. And here again, as a man of
color, and as one who would likely
exist in the margins of whatever
Pan-African black race Taru wants, I
cannot help but disagree.

Think back to the fall of your
senior year of high school
no,
not about how you didn't have a

date to homecoming, loser. Think
about the college app process.
Remember how you courted
Swarthmore? How you dressed
in your nicest slacks and button-

down shirt for your interview?
About how you gushed in your
"Why Swarthmore?" essay about
how Swarthmore was a place of
.
passion and you wanted more
than anything to be a part of it?
RACHEL ACKOFF
It's true that not every
Swattie writes about the college's
tradition of social justice rooted
Organic
in its Quaker heritage in their
"Why Swarthmore?" essays, but
a ton of us do, according to Dean of Admissions Jim Bock. And it's
no wonder. Prominently featured on the "Swat Speak" page of the
brand-new admissions viewbook is a description of "ethical intelligence" that defines it "as the ultimate goal of a Swarthmore education
not only knowledge and intelligence but a desire to put
them to good use in a larger context." Chapter 3 of the viewbook is
titled "How an Idea Can Become Knowledge (and Change the
World)." As Dean Bock says, it's just part of our spiel.
Fast forward to less than a year later
the honeymoon (orientation) is over, and all those starry-eyed prospective Swarthmore
students who longed to carry on the torch of social change-making
are bona fide Swatties. And where do you find them but back
inside the admissions office, this time staging a demonstration?
The mother of all Swarthmore sit-ins took place back in 1969.
Following meetings with the Admissions Committee and discussion with college President Courtney Smith, the Swarthmore AfroAmerican Students Society organized a sit-in in the admissions >
office to advocate a recruitment and support program for black
students. A week later, while students still had control of the office
in Parrish, President Smith died of a heart attack in his office.
Obviously, not all student demonstrations are so nightmarish
for the administration, but there's no way to get around the fact
that admitting agitators is risky business for the college. Activist
students, committed to creating a college community that is in
line with Swarthmore's social justice tradition, struggle against
not least the college
forces that resist such progressive change
budget. There's no debating that the wage increase recently won
by the Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign will be
-

Politics

costly.

Those concerned with the financial future of the college also
worry that admitting a high percentage of students who are committed to careers in social change won't deliver the big bucks.
Alumni who go on to monitor water quality in Bangladesh or
work in a refugee camp in Uganda aren't likely to become major
donors to the college. They just won't have the cash. And even if
they did, they might have a hard time justifying giving money to
an institution with a one billion dollar endowment when children

are starving in Bolivia.
But despite all of the financial drawbacks to admitting activist
kids and all the headaches of negotiating with them as they try to
move the campus in a socially just direction, Swarthmore remains
committed to its image as an intellectual community ideal for
social change-makers. A number of years back, the Swarthmore
application supplement, like all other college applications, had a
blank that read "father's name" and a blank that read "mother's
name." On the recommendation of a Swattie on the Admissions
Committee, Swarthmore changed the language to read "parent
one" and "parent two" to recognize queer parenting. After the
switch, an applicant wrote his entire "Why Swarthmore?" essay
on how Swarthmore's application was the only application that
made him feel comfortable. Now the Common App uses the same
language.

For the time being, it doesn't seem as if we're at risk of losing
sight of the importance of our social justice tradition and our commitment to ethical intelligence, but it's hard to predict how the college will choose to package its image 30 years from now when our
children are applying to colleges. In a culture that is increasingly
obsessed with "U.S. News and World Report" rankings,
Swarthmore is caught up in the struggle to keep its numbers up
especially the number of applicants. Dean Bock and others worry
that Swarthmore needs to broaden its appeal to kids who don't
wear Birkenstocks while still remaining true to its mission.
Myself a product of Swarthmore's pro-activist messaging, it's
probably no surprise that I believe the college should safeguard its
image as the premier intellectual institution capable of educating
people who will go on to change the world. After all, how else can
we separate ourselves from Williams?

Swarthmore ITS an ally in quest for freer society
Why

is this

column

named "Peer to Peer"? For
most tech-sawy people, the
term refers to peer-to-peer
filesharing networks, computer programs that allow
you to

directly connect

with other people around
the world to exchange
information. However, the
term stands for a more general concept, a structure
which,can be applied not
only to computer netNELSON PAVLOSKY works, but to many other
aspects of society, includto
ing journalism, government and personal relammmmmmmm
tionships. Peer to peer can
be contrasted with master to slave, lord to serf, noble to
peon
not just server-client network architectures. A
peer-to-peer society is a relationship of equals, and that is
exactly the democratic ideal that our country is founded
upon: Our Declaration of Independence reads, "We hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal." Our Constitution prohibits both the federal and
state governments from granting titles of nobility, and you
have a right to be tried by a jury of your peers.
The feasibility of a democracy is dependent upon the
feasibility of placing its citizenry on a level playing field.

Democracy as we think of it today could not have been possible on a large scale before the printing press, and the literacy and ability to communicate brought by the mass
production of books, pamphlets and periodicals. The ability of the citizenry to be "informed and active" was basically brought into existence by information technology,
which it continues to rely upon. Digital technology and the
Internet have the potential to drastically increase the ability of the populace to both inform themselves and to act in
concert with their fellow Americans and citizens of the
world. Because the Internet lends itself to two-way communication, to direct connections between people, it represents a departure from traditional broadcast media and
suggests a departure from a traditional passive culture.
This transformation in society can only be a good thing,
and the purpose of this column is to document and advocate for this cultural shift.
One (perhaps unwitting) ally in this peer-to-peer movement is our own Information Technology Services, which
is responsible for connecting us to the Internet. I would
like to take this opportunity to say a few words in praise of
ITS; whatever its faults, it cannot be accused of significantly limiting our freedom to use the campus network as
we please. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation (a nonprofit organization working to defend your digital rights)
states, "Some schools have capitulated to Hollywood's

demands and are actively monitoring all campus Internet
traffic; some are hunting down anything that looks like
filesharing and disconnecting the implicated students
from the network. Others are blithely turning over stuJanuary 27, 2005

dents' names and addresses at the drop of an RIAA subpoena, even when the papers are filed in the wrong jurisdiction." Note how little the actions of ITS resemble such
horror stories, and applaud ITS for standing up to pressure
from enormous entertainment companies "to assume the
role of cop, judge and jailer," in the words of the EFF.
ITS recognizes that peer-to-peer networks have legitimate uses as well as illegitimate uses and does not attempt
to discriminate between them, nor does it ban the technology "just to be safe." We are free to run our own servers on
the network, and you could host your personal Web site
from your own computer, if you so desired this is not
permitted on other campuses. This freedom to tinker with
technology is essential to innovation and creativity, to
learning and experimentation. Both Google and Yahoo
originated as student projects run from the dorm rooms of
their respective founders, without approval from their professors or the administration, outside of any class that
they were taking. Without the ability to run servers on
their campus network, we wouldn't have either of these

revolutionary companies that have made the Internet vastly more accessible and useful for its users. Also, literacy in
this "new media" is important for democratic participation, and just as we run our own newspapers and literary
magazines, we should be able to run our own Web sites and
servers. Appreciate ITS for keeping our network free as
they struggle to keep our network running, and for
enabling us to participate in the digital revolution.

Mules, others bray for mercy at hands of Garnet
BY GENEVRA POTMAN
gpittmal@swarthmore.edu
Things are finally coming together for
the women's basketball team. After a shaky
and inconsistent start to the season, the
Garnet has won its last five games, beating
key conference opponents in each match.
With wins last week against Muhlenberg
and Ursinus, and last night against rival
Haverford, Swarthmore improved its season record to 10-6, 7-4 in the Centennial
Conference where the team moved up to
fourth place in the standings.
Riding the momentum of wins against
Bryn Mawr and Gettysburg out of its vacation play, the Garnet faced a closely
matched Muhlenberg squad on January 20
and left with a nail-biting 85-82 win.
Swarthmore came out strong in the first
half, and after 20 minutes of play held a 4932 lead over the Mules. Muhlenberg came
back to make it a tight game in the second
half, shooting more accurately from the
field and playing stronger defense.

"The first half we just dominated and
everyone contributed," coach Adrienne
Shibles said. "The second half Muhlenberg
certainly picked it up a little. We had a little bit of a letdown after the half." The
Garnet managed to pull out the win, however, aided by key plays down the stretch
from Ali Wolff 'O5 and Kristen Lee 'O5.
Karen Berk 'OB had the best game of her

Swarthmore career, leading the team with
29 points and 12 rebounds. Swarthmore's
ability to break Muhlenberg's press was
key to opening up scoring opportunitiesfor

Berk, which she took advantage of. "I had
all those points, but only because I justfinished the plays that the team created,"
Berk said
"Karen Berk played like a senior,"
Shibles said of the first-year standout. "She

was just amazing." Despite starting only

the Centennial Conference weekly Honor
Roll for her performance.
Against the Mules, Wolff and Radiance
Walters 'O6 both contributed 11 points, and
Lee added 10. Jen Stevenson 'O6 posted a
team-high six rebounds for Swarthmore.
Two nights later, Swarthmore came
home to face a struggling Ursinus team in
the Tarble Pavilion. There was no nail-biting this time, as the Garnet destroyed the
Bears, 66-30.
With two three-point shots by Lee,
Swarthmore opened up a quick 10-4 lead on
Ursinus and never looked back. Solid
Garnet defense forced traveling calls and
poor passing by the Bears, and with 7:50
left in the first half Swarthmore held a 21-8
lead. The Garnet struggled with shooting
the rest of the half, however, and at halftime the Bears had closed the lead to 23-15.
Shooting was nothing to complain about
in the second half, as the Garnet mixed the
physical play of Walters with the shooting
finesse of Laura Popovics 'OB to send the
Bears back to their miserable den. Despite
being double teamed whenever she had the
ball near the hoop, Walters powered
through defenders to score six straight
points for the Garnet early in the half and
quickly increased Swarthmore's cushion
with a 34-18 lead. The team's leader in
points and rebounds finished with 14 and
10, respectively. Popovics hit four straight
three-pointers to close out the game and
finish with 13 points. Laura Jorgensen 'OB
played in her second game back from
injury, and impressed the crowd with her
shooting.

While Shibles

but hungry to defeat its

perennial rivals. Haverford
came out flat, however,
shooting just 13.6 percent
in the first half, and allowing Swarthmore to open up
a 27-9 lead at halftime.
Though the second half was
closer, Swarthmore held on
for a 68-49 win thanks to
double-digit scoring by four
players, Wolff (12), Popovics
(12), Berk (10) and Debbie
Farrelly 'O6 (10). In a game
in which Walters sat out,
Berk stepped up with nine

Men's basketball struggles
BY TARIQ FISCHER
tfischel@swarthmore.edu

Medieval alchemists slaved fruitlessly to turn lead
into gold.

So it is with the Garnet men's basketball team as
they, unlike the alchemists, successfully turn the frustration of a losing season into determination for the
future. "I admire the kids for that," Coach Lee
Wimberly said at practice in anticipation of last night's
game against Haverford.
Saturday's loss against Ursinus dropped the Garnet
to 1-8 in the Centennial Conference and 2-14 overall.
Over 100 fans were on hand as the Garnet hung with the
Bears, down only four at the half. Swat and Ursinus
scored fairly evenly in the first half, shooting 44 percent
and 50 percent respectively.
Unfortunately, the second half was a familiar story
to Tide fans this season, as Ursinus uncorked a 70 percent field goal blitz to escape Table Pavilion with a 75-61
win. The Garnet hiccupped, shooting only 27 percent.
"In so many of our games we've been ahead, but the win

slips away from us," forward Matt Gustafson 'O5 said.
The box scores tell the tale. Gustafson scored 32 points,
more than the rest of the team combined.
Opposing teams plan for Swarthmore in one of two
ways. "When teams key in on [Matt], he obviously has
a hard time [scoring]," Wimberly explained. Double
and triple teams on Gustafson open up the floor for
the rest of the team, evidenced by the scoring surge
that lan McCormick 'OB has provided this year. The
majority of the team's inexperience has limited total
scoring in games against teams that key in on
Gustafson like Gettysburg, who limited him to nine
points.
Muhlenberg and Ursinus, on the other hand, essentially turn the game into the Gustafson Basketball
Workshop, locking down Swat's other four players and
forcing the senior forward to win the game alone. Last
night's results against the Fords were unavailable at
press time.
Look for a newly transformed Garnet squad against
third-ranked Franklin and Marshall on Saturday at
2:00.

Furstenberg under fire for football comments NFC, Philly Style
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY PHIL SALINGER
THE DARTMOUTH (DARTMOUTH COLLEGE)
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H.
Controversy within
the Dartmouth community continues to mount in
response to the publication of a letter Dean of
Admissions Karl Furstenberg wrote four years ago,
calling varsity football programs "a sacrifice to the
academic quality and diversity of entering first-year

classes."

In the wake of this year's 1-9 season for the
College's football team, some critics have called for
Furstenberg's resignation.
A recent article in the Valley News quoted pieces
of the letter that precipitated the outcry a personal
note to Swarthmore College President Alfred Bloom
after that school cut its football team.
"I am writing to commend you on the decision to
eliminate football from your athletic offerings,"
Furstenberg wrote. "I wish this were not true but
sadly football, and the culture that surrounds it, is
antithetical to the academic mission of colleges such
as ours.... A close examination of intercollegiate athletics within the Ivy League would point to other
sports in which the same phenomenon is apparent."
The publication of the letter has sprouted especially widespread outrage among Dartmouth football
~

alumni.
Bill Wellstead, a member of the undefeated 1962
football team, runs the Dartmouth athletics weblog
and stands at the forefront of the group of disgruntled alumni.
"Mr. Furstenberg's integrity is entirely in question," Wellstead said. "The only acceptable way out of
this crisis is for Jim [Wright] to demand or ask for
Karl [Furstenberg]'s resignation."
Some critics have blamed Furstenberg for the
recent disappointing performance of the Dartmouth
football team, which has amassed a meager 16-53
record in the past seven seasons. The team's poor
performance culminated with the firing of head
coach John Lyons at the end of this past season.
Defenders of Furstenberg have compared his long
tenure at Dartmouth Furstenberg was named dean
of admissions in 1990 with the varied success of the
football program.
The College's football squad dominated the Ivy
League until 1998, earning a 58-19-3 record from 1990
to 1997. Furstenberg presided when the team
reached its pinnacle in 1996 a season that saw the
-

~

-

Big Green win 10 games, lose none and outscore
their opponents by greater than two and a half to

one on average.
College administrators have reportedly not taken
action to replace Furstenberg.

Wright released a letter on Dec. 20 that scolded
Furstenberg for his comments but expressed continued confidence in the admissions director.
"That letter was a lapse in professional judgment,"
Wright wrote. "I very much regret the hurt that the
dean's statements have caused within the Dartmouth
community."
Despite his disappointment in Furstenberg's comments, Wright made it explicit that Furstenberg has
carried out college policy.
"The Admissions Office does not determine

Dartmouth's ambitions. Rather Admissions is
charged by me and the Trustees to admit a class that
will meet our ambitions," Wright wrote. "I am confident that the sentiments he expressed in the letter
have never influenced his admissions decisions."
The Ivy League has strict rules for football
recruiting. Each school is limited to an average of 30
football recruits per year over a four-year period.
League rules also place limits on the allowed gap
between the academic quality offootball recruits and
the rest of the class.
Furstenberg denied that Dartmouth's football
woes are due to the alleged biases of the admissions
department.

"We work closely with the coaches within the
guidelines of the Ivy League," Furstenberg said. "The
admissions policies of the institution are decided on
by a wide range of people including the president and
it's my job to implement those policies."
In recent years, Dartmouth football players
appear to have been successful academically. The
graduation rate of football players is routinely at
least as high as that of the class as a whole.
"One of the things we've been able to do at
Dartmouth is blend intercollegiate athletics and
excellent academics," Furstenberg said. "The bottom
line for us is that students have to have been successful academically."
Even though Furstenberg is confident that he has
done the job he was hired to do, he was quick to apologize for his comments that have offended current
and former Dartmouth student-athletes.
"My overwhelming reaction is one of disappointment and regret," Furstenberg said.

As much as I'd have liked to stay in my spacious, warm room
and watch Boomer Esiason tell Dan Marino what a horrendous
failure his career was while Marino's head explodes, I managed to
get my hands on an extra ticket to the Eagles game this weekend
thanks to my good friend Phil. So here's the play-by-play (my apologies to Joe Buck and the
Fox crew if it doesn't
live up to the ethical
standards
set
by
"Trading Spouses: Meet
Your New Mommy").
Pre-game: It's sup-

posed to be a tad cold, so
I take out every article
of clothing I own and
see how many I can
wear without looking

too much like that

guy

in the Citi commercial
who needs a new suitcase. After twenty minutes, I emerge in three
shirts, two jackets, two
a hat,
gloves and a headband.
On the bright side, if
Philly fans catch on to

m

the
that I'm not
really an Eagles fan, I'll
just curl up into a ball
and roll with the punch-

es. I step outside, don't feel that cold, and take my hat off. Thirty
seconds later, my damp hair freezes into icicles. I decide that
maybe it's a little chilly after all.
After miraculously surviving the snow and SEPTA, we arrive
outside the Line. But first, we have to go through security. Any
time thousands of people are going to be crammed into a small
space and alcohol is going to be prominently involved, these checkpoints seem to be a good idea. However, the only patdown I get is a
quick tap on the back of my head and neck. Granted, it's tough to
check everyone thoroughly, but it'd have been nice if they'd looked
anywhere other than the one place I absolutely couldn't have hidden a small knife or, given my attire and Philly's reputation, half
the city's supply of D batteries.
First Half: The Eagles' defense stops Atlanta's offense from
going anywhere on their first two drives and Donovan McNabb
goes to work. After a big run by Brian Westbrook, Dorsey Levens
punches in the first score of the game. A guy in the row ahead of
me pulls his six shirts over his head and starts jumping up and
down in all his topless glory.
,

Another ten minutes pass, and the Eagles cap off another

march down the field with a great catch by Chad Lewis. It's 14-3
and another guy in the row ahead of me is stripping down.
Things could get real ugly if the Falcons' defense doesn't step it
up. (Let me remind you that all those cheesesteaks Philly fans eat
have to go somewhere.) Also, it's freezing. Believe it or not, just
sitting in negative temperatures can make you really, really cold.
I wish I'd worn about 673 more layers.
Meanwhile, Brian Dawkins stands at midfield, doing his best
Usher imitation to the Eagles fight song. Half the fun of going to
games is watching these guys on the sidelines. Freddie Mitchell
runs up and down the sidelines, showing off his new fro-hawk to
every coach he can find (if only he ran his pass routes with this
much enthusiasm).
Second Half: My feet are frozen. I'm not even sure if I still have
toes. Philly opens the half with a field goal and stretches the lead.
The guys in front of me thankfully keep their clothes on for a
change. The Falcons' offense begins to self-destruct. Mike Vick
throws a terrible interception inside his own 20. In celebration,
Helmet Man runs up and down the stadium aisles. I wonder exactly what a man who believes it's a good idea to wear a helmet twelve
hours a day is actually using it to protect.
It's 20-10 and things are looking bleak for Atlanta as TO. starts
dancing to Snoop on the Philly bench. At the same time, some nutcase jumps out of the crowd (wearing an Owens jersey, of course)
and does his own dance at midfield. The security guard chasing
him actually speeds up as he gets closer before launching himself
into the guy. Ray Lewis couldn't have hit him that hard. Best
moment of the game, hands down.
The Eagles add a TD for insurance and kill the clock. Ball game.
Owner Jeffrey Lurie accepts the NFC Championship trophy and
praises the fans as being the most intelligent in the NFL. I reflect
on that statement as drunken Eagles fans chant, "E-G-A-L-S!
EAGLES!"
I love this game.

Gustafson wails on Garnet record books
BY TARIQ FISCHER
tfischel@swarthmore.edu

•

There's nothing more annoying than a
broken record, record, record, record.
Except when the record in question is
Swarthmore's all-time scoring crown. That
crashing sound emanating all the way from
Muhlenberg last Wednesday night was the
mark set by Scott Gibbons '92 falling to second place behind Matt Gustafson 'O5.

Gustafson has shot 1328 field goals and
298 free throws in the 2792 minutes he has
been on the court for the Garnet. The mere
thought of so much basketball would quiet
even Dick Vitale, gaping at the basketball
machine that has owned Table Pavilion for
the past four years.
The numbers are mind-numbing. Going
into last night's game against Haverford,
Gustafson had 1605 points, 523 rebounds, 57
blocked shots, and 183 three-pointers.

"He's a class act and a
humble leader."
Coach Lee Wimberly

record]," Gustafson said.
In that first season, Gustafson was the
leading scorer for the Garnet and tenth in
the Centennial Conference with 14.3 points

per game. Since then, he has steadily
climbed to the top of the leader board, finishing seventh in the conference with 15.6
ppg in 2003, second with 19.5 ppg in 2004, and
23.4 ppg this season, good enough for first in
the Conference and 13th in all of Division 111.
In addition to the scoring title, Gustafson
is on track to score the most 3-pointers in
Garnet history. Despite attracting the spotlight, the Virginia native tries to keep a
modest attitude. "I don't think that [the
records are] that big a deal," he said. "I
never really thought that much about it, just
about making myself the best player I can

be."
The team's struggles over the years have
shadowed Gustafson's individual success.
"My biggest regret is that [Matt] is the best
player to have played here, but he's never
been involved with postseason play," Head
Coach Lee Wimberley said.
"It would be great to play in the postseason," Gustafson concurred. "It's the goal you
set every year." The Garnet came agonizingly close to achieving that goal last year,
remaining in playoff contention until the

tion.

Gustafson's excellent inside game and
laser-targeted outside shot forces opponents
to pick their poison. Larger players may
keep him out of the paint, but cannot help
but be humiliated by his accuracy. Smaller

players are better equipped to cover his outside shot, but simply cannot stop him from
driving to the basket.
As a first-year, Gustafson scored 354
points, setting the stage for a burning of the

a lung. "After my freshman year I knew I had a chance [to break the

last game of the season.
Still, buckets of Gustafson's fond memories will make up for the team's lack of playoff glory. "I got to meet a good group of
friends," he said, "which is probably more

important in the long run than how the team
does this year."
Wimberley had more to say about
Gustafson's contribution to the team's
chemistry. "He's a class act and a humble
leader," the 17th year coach said. "He's loved
by all of his teammates."
Number 32 will take the to his home
court for the last time on Feb. 16. Eight
games remain on the schedule, providing
more than enough opportunity for
Gustafson to put his record permanently
out of reach, although that may not be what
he wants. "I think it would be good [for my
record to be broken]," he said. "It draws
anymore attention to Swat athletics
thing that can do that is good." good. good,
good.

Women's soccer coach says adios to Tide
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN AND TARIQ FISCHER
gpittmal@swarthmore.eduand
tfischel@swarthmore.edu

Women's soccer Head Coach Amy Brunner recently
announced her resignation after six years with the program. Brunner cited the desire to pursue other opportunities. "I'm just kind of burnt out," she said. "It's
time to move on to new things."
"Coaching was something I got into right out of college," Brunner continued. "I think it's time for a
change."
In her six years at Swarthmore, Brunner's teams
met with some success, including a 2002 campaign that
set school records for most overall wins and most conference wins, as the Tide stormed to a 10-9 overall
record with a 5-5 record in the Centennial Conference.
Recent seasons have been marked by disappointment,
however. The women limped to a 4-13-1 record this season, finishing ninth in conference play with a 2-7-1

record.

As a student, Brunner was a standout goalie at
Bates, receiving both Ail-American accolades and the
National Keeper of the Year award.
Over her six-year stint as a coach at Swarthmore,

she amassed a 48-75-1 record.
"I personally think [Brunner] brought a lot to the
program with recruiting and she always had a positive
attitude," forward Katie Stockhammer 'O5 said."l think
it's a good change for the girls, but I think she did a
good job while she was here."
Athletics Director Adam Hertz praised the job
Brunner did in improving the team. "They've come a
long way since she took over," Hertz said. "We value
the effort she's made and we'll miss her." Brunner
expects to stay at Swarthmore until the end of the
semester, continuing spring training and recruiting for

the Tide.
In the mean time, Hertz intends to begin the search
for a new coach after spring break. Sports Information
Director Mark Duzenski explained the hiring process to
the best of his knowledge.
"We'll advertise the position, take in resumes, form
a committee, and select candidates to interview," he
said.

When Brunner finally moves on from Swarthmore,
she is confident that the team will continue to excel in
her absence. "The season wasn't as positive last year,"
Brunner said. "Now I feel like I'm leaving on good

terms."
