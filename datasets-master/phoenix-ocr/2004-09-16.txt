Bourque leaves Swat, alumna named replacement
BY BREE BANG-JENSEN
bbangjel@swarthmore.edu
Monique Bourque, who worked for the
two and a half years as fellowships
and prizes advisor, left the college this
year to take a similar position at
Willamette University in Oregon.
position at
Bourque pursued a
Willamette in order to be closer to her
)ast

'amily.

Her husband, Tom Valente, who
worked as a biology lab instructor, also
•elocated.
"It was important for us to be nearer to
amily than we have been, and we have

>een wanting to relocate to the Northwest
.. When this position opened up, I jumped
Dn it," Bourque said.
Bourque is also in a more senior role at
Willamette. While student grants and
scholarships at Swarthmore are a function of the Dean's Office, they are sepa-

rately administered at Willamette.
Christina Rose-Dubb '97, a former high
school teacher, was hired to replace
bourque on a temporary basis.
"This job came at a really good

timefor
ne," Rose-Dubb said. "I had a baby a year

ago, and I didn't want to teach full time
anymore and I wanted to come back to

fewarthmore."

Rose-Dubb was particularly interested
in the post because of her own experiences
lis a student at Swarthmore.
"I was a Mellon fellow, and it was a

really good experience. I got money and
opportunities I wouldn't have had access
to otherwise," she said.
"I didn't know of all the other fellowships available at the time. Now I'm
amazed by all the things I could have
done. I want to help students have all the
opportunities that they can," Rose-Dubb
added.

Rose-Dubb began her tenure at a busy
time for scholarship and fellowship applications. This week, Rose-Dubb was receiving and processing applications from the
Watson fellowship, and the Rhodes and
Marshall scholarships.
"Right now until Thanksgiving is the
busiest time of year," Rose-Dubb said. "It
keeps me on my toes."
Bourque is helping Rose-Dubb through
the transition and is continuing to aid students with whom she was working prior
to leaving the college.
"I've been continuing to work with the
students long distance. It's probably felt a
bit bumpy from the students' perspective
but I am certainly hoping that none of
the students have felt that they couldn't
get the help or advice they needed,"
...

Bourque said.
"This job really

entails working closely

with students and the switch might be
hard for them," Rose-Dubb said. "I'm trying to make it as easy as possible and support them."
According to Emily Allen 'O5, who is
applying for a Watson fellowship, the tran-

sition is going quite smoothly.
"I only talked to Monique to bounce
ideas off her and get information," Allen
said. "I don't think [the change] has affected me personally very much. But I think it
would have been harder for the people
who had a dialogue going with her."
"Also, for some of the bigger awards,
like the Marshall or Rhodes, you have to
write the name of your advisor on the
form. I was considering initially applying
for a Fulbright and I had Monique's name
down. Changing that after sending in the
form could be confusing," Allen added.
Rose-Dubb also hopes to improve the
fellowships and scholarships Web site in
the spring after the flow of applications
slows.
"I'd like to make a database that is easier to use, so that students could type in
their interests and get applicable information about fellowships," she said.
During her time at Swarthmore, RoseDubb majored in education and English
literature, with a concentration in
women's studies.
She was also involved in Magic, a tutoring group in Chester and the Hispanic
Organization for Latin Awareness.
Since graduating from Swarthmore,
she has taught high school English in
Morocco and at Penn Charter, a Quaker
school in East Falls, Penn.
So far, Rose Dubb is enjoying her new
position.

work was the pay grade system,

which was implemented just
this year and which now forms

the basis by which compensation is allocated to staff members.
Every
member
of
Swarthmore's staff, from the
cashier who works for Dining
Services to the Provost, falls into
a pay grade between 1 and 13,
which defines the limits of

salaries.

A grade-1 staff member in a
position
salaried
receives
between $19,240 and $31,746 in

compensation, while a grade-13
staff member, such as the Dean

of the College, earns between
$127,141 and $209,782 dollars,
according
to
the Human
Resources Web site.
New staff members who have
enough experience from elsewhere often receive remuneration greater than the starting

salaries, as listed on the grade
scale.
The grade scale also includes
a "Market Target" category,
which represents the salary that
an employee at a certain grade
level should be receiving by
their fifth year at that level,
Young said.
The pay grades do not have
direct impact on raises, howev-

"Inflation is too generalized

and what greatly affect people's
lives," Kornstein added.
Recommendations made by
the Ad Hoc Committee on a
Living Wage, a group unaffiliated with living wage campaign
assembled in the fall of 2002 by
the administration, have not yet
reached the budget committee,
Welsh said.
"This fall the president will
be making a recommendation to
the board on the living wage and
then that recommendation will
be part of the budget committee's
work for this year," she said.
The campaign declined to
comment on this year's wage
increases.

the issues are complicated,

SVRC storms dorms to register voters
The Swarthmore Voter Registration Coalition visited each dorms on Wednesday night to get
all students registered to vote for the upcoming election.
SVRC has been compiling a database of all Swarthmore students who have registered, cofounder Ethan Ucker 'O7 said, and sought to reach those students who had not yet registered by
"storming the dorms" last night.
So far, SVRC has been helping members of the college community register by placing voter
registration forms and information sheets around campus and also collecting the forms in boxes
placed in many main buildings and dorms. After collecting the forms, "[SVRC] makes any corrections that need to be made, like making sure all boxes are checked, and sends in the forms
when done," Ucker said.
SVRC's efforts also extend outside of the campus. Since last spring, the group has also been
registering voters in surrounding areas, like Chester and Upper Darby, The Phoenix reported last
week. This past weekend, Swarthmore students registered over 300 people in Upper Darby in
Chester and are planning another drive for this weekend, Ucker said.
"It's not like we're forcing people to register we just want everyone to know how important
it is," Ucker said.

McCabe coffee bar grinds to a halt
BY SARAH ROBERTS

srobertl@swarthmore.edu
After operating at an average
loss of $4,000 a year, The Daily
Grind, McCabe's only coffee bar,
closed its doors at the end of last
semester and will remain closed
indefinitely.
Dining Services said the cof-

fee bar, the only source of food
and drinks after 10 p.m. and the
only vendor of fair trade coffee,
was not worth adding to their
budget.

The coffee bar, which was run
by students and funded by the
library, was "operating at a loss
since its beginning" three years
ago, Library Accounts Manager
Kiana Nesbitt said.
Each year the financial deficit
was supported by the library's
discretionary

fund.

But after increasing budgetary
as losing money
due to lack of use of public
copiers, the library decided it
could no longer support the coffee
bar using its own resources.
"We've exhausted all our additional funding in order to support
the coffee bar," Nesbitt said.
"It became a matter of the
library losing money or closing
the coffee bar," according to Wee
Chua 'O6, who worked at The
Daily Grind for two years and
was manager last semester.

was one of

the main reasons the coffee bar
lost money, since instead of using

points, students would have to
pay cash to purchase snacks and
drinks. Many students agreed.
"I didn't use [the McCabe coffee bar] because it didn't use
points," Paul Thibodeau 'O6 said.
"I know some people didn't use
the coffee bar because they had to
pay money," Jyothi Matarajan 'O5
said.
Dining Services chose not to
add The Daily Grind to the points
system because they said adding a

third coffee bar to the campus
would be impractical.
"We have two coffee bars
already
I just think economically it doesn't make much sense
to open another coffee bar on a
campus this size, with 1,200 students," Director of Dining
Services Linda McDougall said.
She added that the library was
aware at the inception of The
Daily Grind that Dining Services
would not extend support.
At the end of last year, Chua
and Seiden worked to get the cof...

300 signatures from supporters of
The Daily Grind.

Chua also met with Vice
Larry Schall, who,
according to Chua, echoed
Dining
Services sentiments
about not wanting to add a third

coffee bar.
"[Chua] brought the petition

and asked once again if Dining

Services would support the coffee
bar
the answer was still, 'no,'"
McDougall said.
Besides supplying food and
coffee, the main expense for the
coffee bar was paying student
wages, according to Nesbitt.
Twelve students worked at the
coffee bar last semester, Chua

said.

The Daily Grind was open
later than any of the coffee bars
on campus. It was open until mid-

night Monday through Thursday
and until 12:30 a.m. on Sundays.
The latest the Kohlberg and
Science Center coffee bars are
open is 10 p.m.
"[The Daily Grind] was the
only coffee bar open to students
who were studying at one o'clock
in the morning," Nesbitt said.
"I think it's a shame. I liked
the coffee there better than the
other places. It was good to be
able to get coffee late at night,"
Julia Pompetti 'O5 said. "For me,

"As they say where I'm from,
'make hay while the sun

biology lab coordinator, used to
tell his classes when discussing
ideal times to make behavioral

The sun shone this summer

family, who had been intent on
moving back to the West for the

In August, Valente's wife,

Soon after, Valente, Bourque,

Tripod upgraded for
easier navigation
BY JEEYOUNG OH

johl@swarthmore.edu

This year, when students search for books and other resources on the
Tripod system, they will find a newly redesigned Web site to aid them.
New features include a user-friendly layout for easier navigating, special
tabs for finding journals, videos, online resources and music and more concise instructions for browsing items effectively, according to Digital
Information Services Librarian Kelly Mueller, who headed the Tripod
Redesign Project committee.
"Our first priority was to make Tripod as user-focused as possible,"

Mueller said.
Last semester Library Web Services Integration convened to plan out the
redesign and upgrade of Tripod. LWSI is comprised of two librarians from
each college.
In order to facilitate the interaction between three colleges, LWSI used a
weblog to communicate amongst representatives, to get the ideas from staff
and librarians who have worked closely with students and are aware of
where difficulties arise and to keep track of the logistics of the project.
In May, library staff conducted user-testing tasks with students, faculty
and staff from the Tri-Co colleges to identify problems with the previous
system, according to Mueller.

"College library catalogues are not as easy to
search as Google. You have to go through a lot
of trial and error."
Kelly Mueller
digital information services librarian
The project group developed usability tasks and met with students and
faculty to observe how people use the college catalogue system.
The exercises consisted of typical tasks that have do with using the cat-

alogue.

Tasks included checking out a specific book, finding materials to help in
MCAT preparation and creating a list of books and e-mailing it to yourself.
"Overall, what was striking was that there was a big gap between very
savvy users and people with little experience," Mueller said.
"New users had a particularly hard time because a library catalogue is
very different from the Internet search engine. Another striking point is
that all of the users were good at finding known items. There seemed to be
few problems with that. However, finding unknown items proved to be far
less successful," she said.
"College library catalogues are not as easy to search as Google. You have
to go through a lot of trial and error. You need to think of different keywords and be willing to try various strategies," Mueller said.
Because of these difficulties, changes to the library search system were

especially critical.
"We used the redesigned process to address the failures of the old system," social sciences librarian Megan Adams said.
Help instructions have been improved, using examples instead of long
instructions to aid in understanding the function of each tool.
Access to related library services such as EZBorrow, Live Help, Reserves

and Databases are located on the top of each page of Tripod.
More features are included for patrons who log in, including access to
Interlibrary Loan and library records and the ability to save and re-run
favorite searches, Mueller said.
The vendor of the Tripod program, Innovative Interfaces, Inc., recently
made noticeable improvements to its own program. As a result, the Tri-Co
colleges decided to upgrade the Tripod system.
Other customers of Innovative Interfaces, Inc. include New York Public
Library and the University of London Library, Mueller said.
Since the maintenance, upgrade and other services associated with
Tripod are included in an annual licensing fee, the project did not require
any extra funding except for staff time.
Feedback so far has been encouraging, according to Adams.
"We have had lots of feedback from students, faculty and staff from all
three campuses and it is generally positive," she said.
Haverford librarian John Anderies said his campus had accolades for
the new system, as well.
"A lot of the student responses have been very positive. They liked the
new look, they found it easier to use and they like the way that the new
Tripod is structured," he said.
e added that he has also received positive response from faculty.
There is also a link on the Tripod Web site to give feedback online.
The project group will conduct another round of user testing and update
any loopholes.
"There will be more improvements in the future through feedback and
suggestions. This is an ongoing project," Mueller added.

Offices find new home in Sproul
Because the first floor of Parrish wiH become a central meeting and lounge area for students, the offices of Alumni Relations, Publications and News and Information moved to new
offices in Sproul Observatory earlier this month.
Eight hundred thousand dollars was spent to make interior changes to the building so
that the former home of the computer science department could be converted into new
offices for the three departments, according to Janet Semler, director of planning and construction. Another $200,000 was spent on building ramps for improved accessibility, constructing a new terrace and landscaping.
Although everyone at the office is "thoroughly delighted" with the new space, there is a
slight unhappiness concerning the location of the offices, Alumni Relations Administrative
Assistant Millie Dappollone said.
"I miss being in the hub-bub of activity," Dappollone said.
Geoff Semenuk, the production coordinator for alumni relations, expressed similar sentiments. "[The space] is bigger and nicer, but there's less chance to see the students," he
said.

one for teaching,
has two main labs
and an overflow lab for other computer science students if the teaching lab is taken
as well as specialty labs for robotics, natural languages and a cluster/systems lab for
student research, Chief System Administrator Jeff Knerr said.
The Sun Lab was unofficially named for
the Sun Microsystems computers that it
originally housed. But the department had
gradually gotten rid of almost all of their
Sun machines in the years before the
move. During the move, the department
switched from Dell PCs to Hewlitt-Packard
PCs, Meeden said.
By and large, students, faculty and system administrators are happy with the
move. "I'd say the move is definitely positive. The Science Center gives us a lot more
room," said Josh Berney 'O5, one of the
computer science department student system administrators.
The department introduced the radiotransmitter tags, called radio frequency
identification devices, in order to give computer science students access to certain
computer labs and other facilities at all
hours, according to Knerr.
"We lobbied for [getting the RFID tags]
because we know that our students work at
night and we wanted them to be safe. Now
they can know that every single person in
the lab is a computer science student and
not someone off the street," Meeden said.
Various rooms and computer labs are
equipped with radio transmitters that can
read the circular RFID tags. The entrance
to the Science Center located under the
bridge between Cornell and the Science
Center can be accessed by the tags as well.

With the beginning of this school year,
the computer science department's Sun

department has moved to the second floor
of the Science Center, where it is equipped

The computing equipment underwent

Other upgrades in the center include
new cabling and a bigger server room. "We
now have room to grow," Turner said.
According to Knerr, over 100,000 feet of new
cabling was installed over the course of the
move.
For Meeden, the Sun Lab in Sproul was
not without its distinctive quirks. "I think
the Sun Lab was unique because the building was really old and it was a strange
shape and kind of homey, but we were
cramped for space," she said.

"This space [in the Science Center] is
really nice because we designed it to fit our
needs," Meeden said. She pointed out that
in Sproul, the computer science department was spread over three floors and in
the Science Center, the department is all on
the same floor.

According to Knerr, the cost of the new
computing equipment was $40,000. The
RFID devices cost $45,000, according to
Director of Planning and Construction Jan

Neither Linda McDougall, director of Dining Services, nor Vice
President Larry Schall '75 would disclose specific operating budget information. According to McDougall, "The whole college has
been asked to hold budgets at steady levels, but Dining Services is
allowed to increase [their budget] with inflation."
"The most popular change [in Dining Services] has been the
snack bar's starting meal equivalency at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday and
Sunday," Scott Tutton, manager ofEssie Mae's, said via e-mail.
Essie Mae's also offers new items, such as ice cream products,
Olde Philadelphia brand soda and the return of Herr's snack foods.
These additions were not budget-related. Rather, they are part of
Dining Services' attempt to bring new items to campus every year.
"The ice cream has met with lots ofenthusiasm so far," he said.
According to Purchasing Director Janet Kassab, who is trying
to replace some toQ-familiar menu items with new recipes,
Sharpies now features several new variations on older pasta and
chicken dishes. One new dish that was particularly popular was
jerk tofu.
Some students were less than enthusiastic about these improvements in campus dining, however. "Aside from the additions in
Tarble, I haven't noticed any changes," Megan Bartges 'O5 said.
Jamie Midyette 'OB, a vegan, was more complimentary. "I love
everything. I think they have a good variety," she said, and added

Kassab denied rumors of possible removals of the Greek and

This pleased Celia Paris 'O5. "Greek Bar is a high priority for

How to properly
dress improperly

Arts

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Sincerity is dead. I know it, you know it, even Oscar Wilde knew
it back in the 19th century, proclaiming that "in all unimportant
matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential." Incorporating irony
into your wardrobe can be a provocative and fun way to flex your
fashion muscles, but doing it correctly is not always so easy. After
all, how do you communicate that your "Save the Whales" T-shirt is
an ironic gesture, not just some middle school relic that you don't
know better than to wear?
While forays into the
purposefully unfashionable or out-of-place for-thesake-of-irony
can be
tricky, with the right attitude anyone can successfully pull off this bold

move. Irony is the new
black: incorporated into
anyone's closet with ease,

your wardrobe.
It's a mark of status to

dress outrageously; only
the elite can afford the

pleasure of displeasing.
Fears of looking unattractive or being in "bad taste"
■^^™^^^^^^™"BB
are historically middleclass concerns. Just think
of the anorexic supermodel who looks like a heroin addict and never
smiles. This look probably wouldn't work for you or me, but a million or two richer and you could be emaciated and unhappy and still
own the title of chic.
But outrageous and inappropriate dress is not the domain of the
elite alone; all it takes is a little humor and imagination to pull
together wild ensembles in order to flaunt your own status of individuality. Thrift stores are a cheap and time-tested source of funky
accessories, but another less utilized source is the children's section
of your favorite department store. Bright and bold accessories like
those big plastic digital watches are inexpensive and easy to wear
and, I would argue, a picture of Scooby Doo's Mystery Mobile on the
seat of your little boy undies is sure to give you a certain bounce in
your step.
But it certainly isn't necessary to purchase anything new to
incorporate the unexpected into your dress. Something as simple as
mixing unexpected genres of clothing, like stilettos with shorts, can
have a huge impact. Just take care to keep makeup and jewelry to a
minimum, so as not to come out looking like a hooker. Pairing a
dress with jeans is an easy way to accomplish a creative yet safe
look, but be aware that this turns out best when both pieces are kept
fairly minimalist. Perfectly tatteredand torn clothes can give you a
hip look, too, but again, pair these with more clean-cut pieces to
ensure the look is hip, not trashy. Discretion and balance are the key
to pulling off the purposefully unfashionable.
Finally, I must mention the mother of all fashion faux-pas-cumcool, the ever-controversial sunglasses at night. With their dubious
spokesperson Corey Hart, the donning of sunglasses at night is a
dangerous move, suitable only for the bravest of fashion rebels.
Simultaneously chic and idiotic, the wearer of sunglasses sans sun
shuns the law of The Gap and dresses solely for the sake of dress.
They alone are privy to the secret of style, which, once acknowledged and accepted, will forever change your life.
The earth-shattering secret is this: Fashion is like IHOP
any
time's a good time.
If you can successfully navigate a* evening without removing
your shades, you'll know you've made it into the ranks of the tragically hip, those few members of society who disregard societal
norms, safety and common sense in search ofcool. Also members of
this elite league are girls who have been branded by tan lines resulting from wearing fishnets with pedal pushers in the spring and boys
forced to defend their heterosexuality because they wear women's
jeans to ensure "the perfect fit." To proclaim yourself a hardcore
advocate of all things ironic, consider the PoMo gift that keeps on
giving: a tattoo of "tragically" on your hip.
So sport that neon green fanny pack and wear a peace sign with
your army jacket. It is possible to be properly improperly dressed.

The stars of "The Real World: Philadelphia" spent much of their time

in the renovated Seaman's Institute.

Reality in Swat's backyard
BY BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
bmonkpal@swarthmore. edu

Philadelphia is home to the cheese steak, the
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and now, "The Real World."
Seven strangers have been picked to live in a house
to find out "what happens when people stop being
polite and start getting real."
"The Real World: Philly" (Tuesday at 10 p.m. on
MTV) began airing last week, and the audience can
already tell where the sparks will fly and where the
seeds of romance (or at least lust) will blossom
between cast members.

With seven distinct personalities,
there is bound to be some tension in the house. And if not,
viewers can be sure that MTV
will create its own
The show's production got off to a rocky start
when real-life controversy developed three weeks
before the season started shooting in April. "Real
World" producers Bunim/Murray encountered a disagreement with city unions because they had hired a
non-union company to renovate the Seaman's
Church Institute, the home for the seven cast members. Bunim/Murray pulled out of production in the
city and it seemed that there would be no brotherly
love between Philly and "The Real World." A week
later, Mayor John F. Street brokered a truce between
MTV and the angered Philly union workers to bring
the reality series back to the city.
Similar to recent seasons, this cast wasn't able to
get past the sweeping generalizations and stereotypes that "The Real World" is known for.
We have 22-year-old Sarah, who graciously
accepts the role of red-headed sex fiend; 24-year-old
All-American Landon who hates to be categorized as
the "dumb jock"; and MJ, the built 23-year-old athSeptember 16, 2004

roots, and seems to think he has unmatched gaydar.

prising secret to tell his housemates
Twenty-one-year-old Melanie is the outcast who cries
into the telephone: "I don't want to live with people
who hate me!"
The level-headed Shovonda, 21, once worked at
Hooters and is now dealing with the pressures of a
long-distance interracial relationship.
Finally, there is perky Willie, a 23-year-old personal shopper who made his acting debut 13 years
ago on the popular PBS show "Ghostwriter" and is
the openly gay member of the household.
With seven distinct personalities, there is bound
to be some tension in the house. And if not, viewers
can be sure that MTV will create its own with wonderful editing techniques. Already there seem to be
some uncomfortable romantic situations.
Sarah pursues MJ, who has what Shovonda calls
a "kinda sorta not really" girlfriend of two months
back home in Tennessee. Likewise, the minute
Shovonda entered the house, she made it clear that
she is taken, much to the disappointment of Landon,
who just broke up with his girlfriend of seven years.
While MJ slyly refuses Sarah's advances and
Shovonda tries to resist temptation with Landon, one
can only imagine where these steamy love connections will end up. Chances are, it'll be the hot tub.
Willie could be sparking a romance during this
season as well, while Karamo deals with trying to
connect with an "effeminate" gay man when he himself is on the masculine side of the spectrum. For
now, Melanie is the quiet, background roomie, but
she will definitely push some buttons in the coming
weeks.
One area where "The Real World" really shines is
its ability to capture the distinct auras of the filmed
cities. From the initial meetings of the cast at places
like the Philadelphia Museum of Fine Arts, to riding
SEPTA, to exploring the nightlife on* South Street,
the audience can get a real taste of what Philly is
like. There are sure to be surprises in store for this
season. In this city, anything is possible.

Sobering Thoughts

Fall break is just around the corner, and

it's time for everyone to start thinking
about a road trip. Fortunately, for all you
unoriginal bastards out there, we went on
one, so for at least a few columns (until we
run out of publishable things to talk
about), we'll give you some idea of what an
awesome road trip is like. But before talking about our trip, we thought a bit of history would be instructive.
The first road trip was taken by the
Jews. There is a great omission in the
Bible. Moses actually said, "Let my people
go
on a road trip." And so it was that the
Jews embarked on one bad ass mother of a
road trip. All they ate was manna, they
rode some donkeys, partied every night,
and when they got too drunk, they usually
kicked some Egyptian ass, woke up the

California's really far, plus the fact that an

engine doesn't get great gas mileage, led us
to travel south. South. Oh, the South

what had happened, and blamed everything on God. One night, everyone did acid

home of confederate flags, the fake home of
the Colonel, and other stuff we'll mention
next time. But we digress (again). So the
final destination was El Paso, Texas, home
of Emiliano, and land of the plentiful bounty promised to Jon: Taco Cabana. We were
two men on a Taco mission, but first, we
had to drive 2400 miles.

So yeah, last step to prepping for a good
road trip is getting started, so we did. We
headed for West Virginia. West Virginia,
according to its license plates, is just like
Gentry's mom: "Wild. Wonderful." The
truth is there were a whole lot of trees. The
scenery really was gorgeous, until we got
off the highway and realized how ugly people from West Virginia are. They should
rename Swarthmore the West Virginia of
colleges. We slept in a Ramada Inn outside
of Charleston, although we had hoped to
stay in the Microtel, where the amenities
are apparently fantastic.
In the Ramada Inn, we got our first real
taste of the South. While watching TV alone
in our rooms without any hookers, a talk
show called "Joni" appeared to us like a
message from God. Joni starts telling us
that this week's show is about how homosexuals have been shunned by the church,
and that the church needs to embrace them
and show them the love of Jesus Christ,
even though the Jews killed him (see
Gibson, Mel, "Passion," Twentieth Century
Fox, 2004). We thought, wow, a progressive
Christian talk show; finally a reasonable
position on homosexuality from the church.
Then Joni shows viewers a slide show of the
guest's life. First few slides are of an awkward girl growing up, having trouble understanding her sexuality. She goes to college
and comes out, lost and confused, and then
suddenly, Joni tells us she finds the love of
Christ. Next picture in slideshow is said lesbian with a husband and three kids. Joni
said, "When we come back, we'll be talking
about the L word, Lesbianism." Wow. So
that's the L word. We thought it was Lobo,
who kicks ass. Read his comic. Joni went on
to talk about how by embracing the love of
Christ, God would show us the way out of
homosexuality. The best part of the show

was when Joni went to TCU (Texas CHRISTIAN University) to interview students on
whether or not "we were born gay, or if
there was hope for change." The last interview was a large black man, who said "Uh,
I guess," as he sped off towards class. Cut
back to Joni, who said, and we fucking
quote, "I wanna say, 'Yay' to that last broth-

er." We kid you not.
Anyway, we have to save the rest of the
road trip for future columns, or we won't
have anything to write. Shout outz to

night, John Egan 'O6 and Jacob Winkler 'O7, the group's
co-founders, discussed their reasons for starting the
club.
"We're just two guys who like giving massages and
like the idea of getting better without going to a massage
school, which no one has time or money for," Egan said.
"We want to promote massage as a good thing for the
Swarthmore campus, because getting a massage on a
normal basis is proven to be healthy and helpful."
First-meeting attendees expressed interest in improving their massage skills as well as receiving a good,

hearty kneading themselves.

The massage group's name is SMUT, but their intentions
are pure.

"Swarthmore can be a stressful place," Jessica
Langston 'OB said, "and the beds give you backaches. I
thought I could come get a good massage but learn to give
a better one, too."
Egan and Winkler emphasized the health-related benefits of massage and other natural remedies like acupressure and holistic medicine.
"There is that healing aspect," Egan said. "It's always

students," Winkler said.
The group intends to meet Thursday and Friday

"We'll introduce new material each week. It'll be a

Methods introduced in the class will include Shiatsu
massage, rolling and acupressure. Egan and Winkler discussed the importance of developing a "good routine for

ing, or if they want to relax to go to sleep, it's going to
require a different set of skills."
Their short-term goals for SMUT are simple. "We
would like to see the group meet fairly often, and as the
weeks go on, to grow confident and comfortable in massage," Winkler said.
Further down the line, Egan and Winkler envision
...

"regular people making appointments maybe one day a
week, and eventually a Swarthmore massage practice for

the town."
"We would like to get chartered," Egan said. "That
means we could get funding for real massage tables."
Officially licensed or not, SMUT is off and running.
Students planning to come to meetings should bring
water, blankets or towels, and they should be clean. "I
think this could be really awesome, Winkler said.

'Hero' struggles to rise beyond the past
BY ABIGAIL GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu

For a drama championing the glory of
for ideals, the great tragedy of
"Hero" isn't that lovers are forced into
deadly conflict or that worthy characters
come senselessly under the sword. That's
just what the writers want you to think.
The real tragedy of "Hero" is that
"Rashomon," "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon" and "The Matrix" came out first.
Despite its magnificent blend of visual
and martial art, it is difficult to appreciate
the originality of "Hero" without comparing it to its predecessors, for it teeters presuffering

cariously between historical melodrama
and

modern marital-art

extravaganza.

Fortunately, that fragile balance is maintained by a strong emotional core, rooted in
a set of complex characters that stay true to
the thematic ambiguity of the movie.
Done in the style of Akiro Kurosawa's
1950 masterpiece "Rashomon," the tale of
"Hero" is told multiple times from alternating perspectives. Nameless (Jet Li), a
police chief in pre-unification China, is
brought before the Emperor (Daoming
Chen) to recount how he slew the assassins Sky, Broken Sword and Flying Snow
(Donnie Yen, Tony Leung Chiu Wai and
Maggie Cheung, respectively). In the spirit
of Kurosawa, as the tale is told and re-told
by Nameless and the Emperor, the audi-

ence is left with a central question unanswered: Who is the real hero of this story?
Thfc movie's non-linear structure may
be expected if you paid attention to the
"Presented by Quentin Tarantino," tackily
engraved on the promotional posters. But
director Yimou Zhang manipulates time
with effortlessness that's foreign to
Tarantino fare. The story flows naturally
through flashbacks without the ponderous
feeling of "Crouching Tiger," and because it
continuously reshapes itself, both the plot

10

and characters develop genuinely.
Such development is the movie's
strongest deviation from kung-fu flicks of
yore. While the characters in "Crouching
Tiger" tended to be archetypal (Aging
Hero and Aging Heroine fight Desert
Nomad and Hot Young Thing), "Hero"
defies you to box its cast in. Even the title
is misleading—it's unclear at the end of
the film whether Li's "hero" is any worthier than his adversaries. The screenplay
(Feng Li, Bin Wang and Yimou Zhang) displays the integrity often thrust aside in
martial arts films to up the "whoa" level
with gratuitous fight sequences. While
"Hero" could easily have shed three or
four battle scenes, the characters' strong
emotional
motivations—jealousy,
vengeance, love—justify their actions (if
not their ability to defy gravity). Zhang
has an excellent eye for atmospheric
nuance, taking full advantage of the visual
medium to delicately explore the characters' vulnerability and interdependency.
More so than any other martial-arts
film, "Hero" pays just as much attention to
shot composition and overall imagery as to
the actor's whirling bodies. Zhang dresses
the set and actors in vibrant tones that
complement the mood of each new version
of the story. For example, Nameless' original tale draws heavily on jealousy and
anger. During this scene, the characters
are dressed in reds highlighted by flaming
gold trees and plains. Flashbacks to more
innocent times are clothed in a cool green
palette, enriching the sense of peace and
reflection. The cinematography, too, leans
heavily on the metaphoric, with many lin-

gering shots of characters striving solitarily against a vast, overwhelming landscape
and buffeted almost to the point of ridiculousness by strong winds. (I'd estimate the
electric bill for powering the wind
machines as rather larger than the budget
of some Third World countries.)

Stunning cinematography is a hallmark of Yimou Zhang's "Hero."
Unfortunately, the saturated visuals of
"Hero" are at times a liability. While perfect for dramatic stills, the cinematography is aggravatingly showy during the
fights—they look like souped-up anime.
For all the "Matrix" junkies and naysayers
of the low-tech approach of "Crouching
Tiger," look no further than the first fight
scene of "Hero." Like many moments in
the film, it is overloaded with slow-motion
and digitized bodies pummeled by the
ever-present wind machines. Granted,
there is some beauty in elegant figures
frozen in mid-air, but like much of the
film, it's so obviously derivative that it
degrades the experience.
Not content with stealing Lee's thunder, Zhang also stole his lead actress, Ziyi

Zhang (Jen in "Crouching Tiger"). This

was a mistake. Her character, a pouty,
adolescent kung-fu disciple (sound familiar?) is even more out of place than bullet
time in this universe, and her superfluous angst upsets the much more interesting dynamic between the adults. I wanted
to send her to time out until she finished

puberty.
But though "Hero" loses many of the
sterling qualities of its influences, it
remains one of the finest understated mixtures of cinematic art and violence to date.
It may not be entirely unique, but it has a
fine style all its own.
"Hero" is 96 minutes long and rated PG-13 for stylized martial arts violence and a
scene of sensuality.

Life beyond Cheng Hing can still contain MSG

Two brave writers explore the good, the bad and the ugly of Chinese food from around Swarthmore

BY SUSANNAH GUND AND JOHN RUSSO
sgundl@swarthmore.edu and jrussol@swarthmore.edu
You know those late nights of studying when you need
Chinese food. Maybe you want a little more kick, a little
more sodium, a little more not-on-your-meal-plan than the
Sharpies Asian bar. (Although if they're serving
Asian chicken salad, go anyway.) You're sick of
Cheng Hing. You want delivery, and you want
the best delivery possible. Well, though we may
be lowly freshmen, we have searched far and
wide to find the best Chinese that can be
delivered to your doorstep. We assembled a
panel of experts: John's twin, Armand Russo
'OB, Anna Mello 'OB (a resident of New York
who therefore possesses of superior taste in
good, cheap Chinese food), Ross Littauer 'OB,
Nate Allen 'OB, Tristan Lawson 'OB and Kavita
Hardy 'OB. We ordered from Cheng Hing's three
delivery competitors (China Wok, Happy Wok,
and Panda House), color-coded the dishes and
spread them out on our floor in
Wharton. The resulting lessons:
Not all fortune cookies
taste the same, and the

campus or its dorms very well. This was especially evident
when the food from China Wok arrived nearly 20 minutes
later than expected.
When Christina asked Panda House if they had any special dishes and said she liked spicy food, they suggested
garlic chicken. While Allen thought it was an "exquisite,
buttery chicken delegability with a garlic twist," he
found little support among our other reviewers.
My biggest problem was that it was neither as
spicy nor as garlicky as the restau-

eat them, you might not live long enough for the fortune to

come true." Fortunately they didn't send extra cookies as
they'd promised over the phone. They also ignored the
request for extra chopsticks.
China Wok did send the extra cookies and chopsticks as
promised, but unfortunately the cookies were "less than
awesome." The Crab Rangoon (really just cheese wontons)
were tasty to some, a little flat and too greasy for others, but
after all the bad Chinese food, they were, as Allen said,
"amazingly, spectacularly, knock-me-on-my-ass average." We
also ordered veggie wontons, which were below awesome, below average, and, according to Hardy, left
"an aftertaste of rotting sushi." The only person
to give them a positive review was Tristan, who
said they were better than cheese wontons.
(Tristan hates cheese wontons.) The

sesame chicken was sampled by
everyone and almost as universally disliked. The sauce was
described as "lacking in taste or
pop," "burnt," and even "like toe
jam." Nate thought it tasted
"more like a soggy orange
than chicken." I personally wouldn'trefuse this
sesame chicken if I
were starving, but I
wouldn't order it again.
The 10-mein was disappointing too, especially
in the "low noodle to
other stuff ratio" as

shows to get you talking the day after and others that are
snooze-fests. Here's a peek into a few fall television
shows that should bring Swat students some quality
entertainment.

Ponder all of the intricacies of rich
white kids with too much time on
their hands. Better yet, watch a
'tween WB show
If a hit show celebrated its series finale last season, the
logical thing for a network to do is take advantage of that
buzz by launching a spin-off. If your hit show is "Friends,"
then you've got a lot of work to do to push the new show up
to the extreme level of Central Perk fan devotion elicited by
the original. NBC tried to live up to expectations as the
much-anticipated "Friends" spinoff, "Joey" (NBC Thursday,
8 p.m.), premiered last week. The loveable Joey Tribbiani
leaves his comfort zone of vibrant Greenwich Village and
travels to Hollywood to pursue his acting career. With the
help of Joey's lively sister Gina and new genius roommate,
nephew Michael, he tries his best to fit into the West Coast
scene. Romance seems to be in the air for the perennial bachelor, but having a love connection with his married blonde
neighbor might prove to be difficult.

These small complications in Joey's life aren't the
worst of his problems. The fact is that he lacks "friends."
Chandler isn't around to make sarcastic comments,
viewers are deprived of Phoebe's inconsequential blabber and of Monica's cleaning OCD. There's not even a pet
chicken or duck! "Friends" fans may feel slightly jarred
upon viewing this sitcom for the first time because of the
change in atmosphere. Despite this, the new supporting
cast seems to be solid and easy to enjoy on screen.
Viewers have a chance to look forward to the building
chemistry between characters in upcoming episodes,
and, judging from week one, Joey will be just fine going

solo.
It'll either be an awesome second season or a sophomore slump this time around for two of television's most
buzzed-about shows, "The Apprentice" and "The OC."
"The Apprentice" (NBC Thursday, 9 p.m.) and Trump's
trademark "You're fired" try to hit gold again with 18
fresh-faced entrepreneurial hopefuls vying to become the
second apprentice. With the women's team named Apex
and the men's team choosing Mosaic, the opposing
groups embarked on their first task last week. The mission consisted of creating a new Mattel toy, with the most
marketable toy winning and sending the losing team to
the ominous boardroom. The new twist entailed both
teams choosing a member from the opposite sex to be
their Project Manager. The ladies won the first task,
leaving 32-year-old Rob to be fired from Mosaic. The 15week-long job interview is likely to contain surprises,
challenging tasks and feuding teammates that get the
audience hooked once again.
The hormonally-charged Beverly Hills 90210 clone,
"The OC" (Fox Thursday, 8 p.m.) will return on Nov. 4 for
its second season. Until the exciting opener, you can ponder all of the intricacies of rich white kids with too much
time on their hands. Better yet, watch a 'tween WB show,
because hey, you can never get enough of those. With
new dramas like "Jack and Bobby" and "The Mountain"
paired with critics' faves "Gilmore Girls" and
"Everwood," the WB might finally find a place to shine
other than the Dawsonified rooms of 13-year-olds every-

where.

But my personal picks for the two must-see new
shows this fall are ABC's "Lost" (Wednesday, 8 p.m.) and
"Desperate Housewives" (Sunday, 9 p.m.), premiering on
Sept. 22 and Oct. 3, respectively. "Lost" could be thought
of as "Survivor" without the tribunals and "Cast Away"
without Wilson. From the creator of "Alias," this actionpacked drama depicts the lives of 48 survivors of a plane
crash living on an island. "Desperate Housewives" is a

quirky Stepford Wives-esque primetime soap following
Mary Alice Young, whose suburban lifestyle ends up
killing her. She subsequently watches her friends and

neighbors make messes out of their lives from the pearly
gates. It's what I like to call trashy melodrama at its

finest.
In a time when NFL season is in full force, it's good to
get away from the pigskin and your studying by watching a few shows. From sitcoms to dramas, there is bound
to be something that will catch your eye and get you

MUSIC REVIEW

Dan Friel's electronic noises Confusingly wonderful'
JOSEPH KILLE

I, IV, V
Dan Friel's new solo mini-album, or
ep, "Sunburn" on Velocirecords, is an
outlandish, loud, sometimes abrasive
mix of cheap electronic instruments, gui-

tar pedals, remote control car joysticks,
walkie talkies, and electric guitar. While
this combination seems like it should be
about as un-listenable as the squawks
produced by a computer modem and car
alarm in the throws of their forbidden
passion, the seven-track ep spews forth

something covertly beautiful, filled with
nuance and maturity, completely the
reverse of what I expected from a minialbum of noise experimentation.

Friel's work with the New York-based
rock group Parts & Labor has been slowly attracting attention for its electric

12

instrumental, octopedal percussion,
and, as one reviewer noted, the fact that
the band seems as interested with 'establishing a mood as...punching you in the
face." But "Sunburn" should garner
praise and interest for other reasons
entirely. While music recorded in somebody's home with his particular roster of
"instruments" should soundreminiscent
of that time you blended your neighbor's
cat by accident, Friel manages to produce
sounds that calm rather than irritate.
Put another way, the ep is confusingly wonderful. Despite the electronic
nature of the music, tracks like
"Deadbatteries,"
"Death"
and
"Tractorcalls" seem organic and familiar, never alienating or harsh. The
spikes and blips in each composition are
always appropriate, and even his overdriven guitars and feedback seem natural and acoustic.
"I like exploring the folkier aspects
of electronics and electronic music, and

I like making electronic music on equipment available for nothing on Ebay,"
Friel said in a press release, adding
"you can buy my keyboard for $10." And
this approach works, amazingly well.
For as many times as I've listened to
"Sunburn," I'm still impressed by the
punch that FrieFs managed to pack with
hardly 20 minutes of music. The tracks
can be sparse or lush, the music tragic
or filled with ephemeral joy, but what
he manages to create is always unique
and never boring. The closing track,
"Quitting," consists of different guitar
pedal feedback pitches looped together
into a curtain of sound that closes

behind a burning improvised guitar
solo.
Where a lesser electronic diddler
would have used rhythmic bass or droning minor chords in an effort to impress
weight and importance on the listener,
Friel manages to find delicacy in the
wavering treble of a Casio keyboard and

September 16, 2004

the squealing feedback of a walkie
talkie. Where so, so many others have
created messes of prepackaged squall
and overused, expensive effects, Friel
has been able to find his voice with simple techniques and even simpler instru-

ments.

Even as I type these final ambiguous
words of praise for "Sunburn," I can't
fully comprehend why this ep is so damn
good. Perhaps my dismay is a bit insulting to Mr. Friel's comrades in the noise
scene, but on paper, and as all logic dictates, and as every instinct in my body
tells me that this music should be godawful, it is not. Whether Dan Friel is as
talented as he seems, or this mini-compilation of home and live recordings
occurred by chance, it is a small and simple ep that somehow transcends the
expectations of its genre, execution, and
scale. And it is simply fantastic.

Saving the Grind
The wearying ennui of long hours spent in the airconditioned quiet of McCabe doing class readings and
thesis research is one of the most enduring cliches of
Swarthmore life. So is the cliche of hungry, thirsty students searching for food and caffeine to fuel their nocturnal insomnia. One would think that a combined solution
to both problems would be a roaring success, but bureaucratic inflexibility has, unfortunately, killed the venture

before it was given a fair chance.
The Daily Grind had many starting advantages. It was
located in a natural nook for a small service area, right in
the most high-traffic area imaginable, the middle of
McCabe on late weekday nights. Rather than having to
find staff members willing to work a late night shift, the
Grind functioned smoothly with an all-student staff,
working for student wages, and probably could have continued doing so even with more business. No matter
what, it would have been serving a much simpler menu
in a smaller, quieter space than either Paces or Qiib, both
of which get by with all-student staffs.
So why did it fail? Well, primarily, it was barred from
using Dining Services credit on a campus where students
are strongly discouraged from carrying cash. Most things
on campus that aren't free can be purchased with the
swipe of a card. The exceptions are admission to events
like private parties or food from student cafes like Paces,
which people usually attend in groups as part of large
social gatherings rather than popping in for an impulse
drink or snack.
Skeptics should note that students hanging around
The Daily Grind searching in their pockets for a dollar or
two was a fairly common sight, and that the Science
Center Coffee Bar, whose location and hours of operation
seem a direct parallel of The Daily Grind's, does a very
brisk trade from students who randomly swipe their card
for a cup of coffee or a dollar's worth of candy while
studying.

The Science Center Coffee Bar, indeed, stands as a
great model for how a McCabe coffee bar could work.
Rather than drawing money away from Kohlberg, it
serves students outside Kohlberg's vicinity after
Kohlberg closes. Neither the Science Center nor Kohlberg
are in particularly convenient locations for students in
McCabe after 10 p.m, of whom there are certainly plenty
all through the week. Who's serving them?
With a student staff in place, equipment already purchased and a great location, why couldn't Dining Services
extend the same support to The Daily Grind that it did to
the Science Center Coffee Bar it helped start? Was it just
simple inflexibility, or a distrust of student-started operations? Whatever the reason, Dining Services should
admit that the immediate cause of The Daily Grind's high
prices and lack of profits was their lack of support. There
were other extra costs, such as the fair-trade coffee, but
surely a compromise could've been reached on such
issues, given how much could be gained through cooperation. With a single supplier, the costs of adding extra
pastries

and snacks to the Grind's menu selection would

have decreased dramatically, and The Daily Grind could
have evolved from its tiny beginnings to a complete, convenient source for food, finally satisfying the long-heard
calls for something like the Swa-Wa proposal.
Saying the campus has no need for three coffee bars is
silly; the administration hasn't really asked for student

Daily Grind would be far less of a burden for Dining

the worthy goals ofproviding extra, much-needed student

take the risk?

editor

Don't vote for either of two evils
Dear Editor:
In his Sept. 9 op-ed "Take real
action: Vote John Kerry" (pg. 14),
Scott Tanner 'OB observed that
Swatties are afflicted with a "lack of
engagement" in election-year politics.
Being a first-year, I have no long-term
perspective on the ebb and flow of
politicking at Swarthmore; I can, however, concur that the dialogue on
national issues has been muted these
first two weeks. Coming to a campus
renowned for liberal activism, I certainly expected more visible political
discourse than has manifested itself.
I submit that the uninspiring John
Kerry, whom Tanner urges us to support, may well be the reason for this
phenomenon. Tanner didn't address'
anti-war Swatties. Perhaps that's
because Kerry voted to authorize the
war in Iraq; now Kerry wants to send

more troops and won't rule out conscripting them. Tanner also didn't
address Swatties who value civil liberty. Perhaps that's because Kerry
voted for the PATRIOT Act three years
ago and today backs extending it.
Tanner's appeal to SQU was simply
deceptive: Kerry doesn't support gay
marriage. Likewise, his appeal to
Earthlust willfully disregards fact:
http://www.johnkerry.com/pdf/
pr_2oo4_oBl9g.pdf, a document on
Kerry-Edwards coal policy, explains
that "John Kerry and John Edwards
believe that the Kyoto Protocol is not
the answer."
I am not a liberal, but I suspect liberals at Swarthmore and across the
country are smart enough to grasp

that John

Kerry

is not actually on

their side. I also suspect many, Tanner
included, feel obliged to vote for him

anyway out of opposition to Bush.
Could the political hush on campus be

one

of embarrassment,

of

self-

conscious hypocrisy?
If so, I'd like to offer some advice.
Please, my fellow Swatties, let your
conscience be your guide: Vote for a
third-party candidate. Kerry and Bush

are running on nigh-indistinguishable
platforms; unless you approve of the

status quo, a vote spent for one
against the other is truly wasted. I'll
proudly be voting for Michael
Badnarik, Libertarian, for president.
Most of you probably have views that

align with Ralph Nader's or David
Cobb's, and that's OK too. If we don't
vote for what we believe in on Nov. 2,
how will we be able to respect ourselves should evil (whether "greater"
or "lesser") be triumphant on Nov. 3?

They seemed to expect The Daily Grind to prove its
worth on the library's budget leftovers with no other
institutional support, which is ridiculous. Paces and Qiib,
which arguably cater to much smaller audiences, both
got help from the administration starting out. Let's ask
Dining Services to give The Daily Grind a real chance.

culture is anti-activist.
Swarthmore's mission professes a commitment to "an education that helps students learn to
and to act
question and explore, to think critically
responsibly and with conviction." We've got the critical thinking part down pat, but we're failing to act
responsibly and with conviction. In fact, it's our intensive inquiry that trips us up and leaves us paralyzed
"

Politics

...

by uncertainty.

We arrive at Swarthmore thinking that we know
everything, figure out within the first semester that we
don't know anything, frantically learn, learn, learn
until graduation and leave still thinking we don't know
anything for certain. While understanding the inherent
complexity in the political and social issues of our times
is a necessity, it shouldn't render us so conflicted that
we are without any convictions.
To Swatties success is "critical thought," with an
emphasis on "critical". How many times have you
heard a classmate comment, "The dialectic didn't
account for the views of indigenous peoples?" Or try,
"The heteronormative analysis of the author reinforces
the dominant paradigm." We're obsessed with finding
holes in a theorist's arguments and, when we do, we
consider it a magnificent achievement. The same goes
for life outside of Kohlberg. When we find flaws in an
activist group's organizing model (or lack thereof) we
deem the group silly and ineffective and not worth our
precious time. Rather than judging our success in

terms of our positive contributions

something creat-

Ed, something envisioned
we pat ourselves on the
back when we've thought critically enough to pinpoint
flaws and shortcomings.
What's more, we don't realize that the true depth of
inquiry we seek must be found outside McCabe. At
Swarthmore, our model of learning is a purely academic one, not an action-oriented one. When we spend
hours in Chester registering voters we obsess over the
problem sets we should be solving and the papers we
should be writing. We keep our activist meetings to an
hour
God forbid they should become anything more
than a neatly-packaged study break. But what we don't
understand is that we can learn more from engaging in
real-world struggles than we can from inside the Swat
bubble. Reading about an ever-widening socio-economic class divide will never resonate in the same way that
a walk through the streets of West Philly does.
Most frightening of all, at Swarthmore we believe
that there is no universal truth
no "right." We pepper
our speech with self-conscious phrases like "I feel" and
"in my experience." We have intellectualized honoring
diverse perspectives and cultures to the point that we
believe everything we do is right to someone and wrong
to someone else, so what's the difference? We have
become paralyzed by our uncertainty. But we can recognize injustice. We know exploitation when we see it.
I had a hell of a time deciding between going to
Swarthmore and going to Grinnell. I visited each campus multiple times and on April 30,1 sat on my bed with
a disintegrating piece of paper on which I had scrawled
an extensive pro-con list. On the list, I assessed everything from attractiveness of the male population to
quality of the food. But at the bottom of the list was the
item that I was obsessing over. It read, "Grinnell: 'Learn
to be a better activist.' Swarthmore: 'Learn to be a better thinker.' In the end, I choose to spend my formative college years at Swarthmore because I believed that
becoming a better thinker would allow me to be a better
activist. Now that I'm here, I haven't changed my mind.
The often oppressively critical levels of inquiry in
which we engage as Swarthmore students can strengthen our activism rather than stifle it. If we refuse to
allow our feelings of uncertainty, to paralyze us into
inaction, we will learn to both subject our preconceptions to rigorous analysis and to engage the world in all
its glorious complexity and imperfection.

Working outside the ballot box
BY EVAN GREER
egreerl@swarthmore.edu
I want to take a few moments to respond to Scott
Tanner's op-ed, "Take real action: Vote John Kerry"
(Sept. 9, pg. 14). I was disturbed by the implications of this
letter, which implied that anything outside the framework of Democrat vs. Republican politics is somehow not
"real" action. While I share Tanner's desire to see more
political action on campus, I do not feel that it is my place
as an individual with a significant amount of privilege to
define for other groups just what political action is.
We must realize that what Tanner calls "mainstream
politics" are simply politics that have been traditionally
dominated by white, upper-middle-class and patriarchal
values. -For him to imply that the work that SOCA, SQJJ
or other traditionally oppressed groups do is worthless
because it doesn't directly address the election is both
absurd and disempowering. As allies to those who are
oppressed by the system that we live in, it is not our job
to lead them or tell them how to best take action. It is our
job to let them lead us, to lend support in whatever way
we can and to work within our own communities to break
down the barriers of ignorance and privilege that would
lead someone to think that this campus is void of political
activism merely because there's not a Kerry-Edwards
sign in every window.
I further question Tanner's logic where he portrays
Kerry as a champion of "Swarthmore's progressive causes." There are many good reasons why the activist groups
on campus are thinking outside the ballot box and working at the grassroots level for change, not the least of
which is that Kerry hardly addresses most of our grievances. If you don't see Students Against the Occupation or
SPAC spending all their time rooting for Kerry, maybe

THE PHOENIX

that's because Kerry's policies on Israel-Palestine are no
better than our current president's, and he signed every
free-trade agreement that SPAC opposed. Tanner seems to
want every group on campus to drop everything and
work on the election. I can't think of a single campus
action group who would say that all of their demands
would be met by either of the candidates being elected on
Nov. 2.
This may come as a surprise to those of you who read
my columns last year, but I plan to vote for John Kerry.
However, I do not think that those five minutes spent in
the voting booth will in any way constitute taking "real
action." Voting is something we do every few years to
make surface-level changes to our political situation. It is
one tiny action that has the potential to help a little bit. In
working withmy opinion, however, grassroots action
in communities to build mutual aid, solidarity and selfsufficiency
has the greatest potential to bring about
real change. There is already a movement building on
this campus and around the country to highlight this type
of community action and encourage us all to "Don't Just
Vote!" I may be at the polls on Nov. 2, but I will also be in
the streets of Philadelphia on Nov. 3, regardless of who
wins the election, to join other activists from the area in
calling for some real democracy.
Let's not lie to ourselves. We're not voting for Kerry
because he embodies our vision for a true democracy,
we're voting for him because he's not Bush. It is essential
that we are in the streets the day after the election to let
our voices be heard loud and clear that we are not happy
with a system that forces us to choose between two candidates who barely address the issues that concern us
most. For all of us working towards true change, towards
a world based on democracy, equality and justice, whoever wins in November, la lucha sigue!

though. I have a larger beef with you all. We may stay in ou

Here's the Beef

"Swat Bubble" on weekends and we may know everythin
about one another from GPA to menstrual cycle, but when i
comes to sociopolitical activity we neglect our wonderfu
microcosm. We are wholly apathetic. When it comes to issue
of social responsibility and any form of politics, the campus'
attention is projected outward, not in. Is it really too much t
ask that you care about something going on right in front o
you? Those who advocate voter registration and socia
change will scoff at the notion of even clicking a button on
Web site to submit a Student Council vote. Are we so intel
lectually and politically pompous that every student concern
is beneath us? Even those explicitly seeking social chang
specific to the college, the Swarthmore Living Wage anc
Democracy Campaign, validate themselves as part of th
quest for the "greater good" by including the broad socia
goal of "democracy" in their title. Bringing change to 50
College Ave. alone is not a worthless goal and need not b
taboo.
The year before I arrived at Swarthmore, a student vot
was held to decide the fate of vacant basement space in
Tarble. Should it become a "SwaWa," a 24-hour convenienc
store, or a computing lounge for the Swarthmore Colleg
Computing Society? From what I understand, fewer than 30
students voted. SCCS won, and the student body will suffe
for years to come because of this self-inflicted failure o
democracy. While I sit up at night craving cookies and a soda
I can rest assured knowing that a room full of Linux comput
ers remains a vacuum of student life and a state-of-the-art
media lounge sits vacant behind locked doors. One small, spe
cial interest, student group was able to sway the election t
get their way by the most pure and unquestionable mean
imaginable
simply voting. Ingenious! The apathy of th
Swarthmore classes of 1998-2001 has adversely affected fou
years of many of our lives, and I hope you all have the fore
sight to prevent similar fates from befalling the class of 2009
or any class thereafter.
To combat this apathy, I would suggest that you take th
small bit of initiative required to achieve a position of influ
ence on any student committee or even Student Council, bu
the dearth of interest in the past leads me to think such an
attempt would be futile. If you are to take any agency in you
college career outside of Paces and the classroom, I believe l
will be in small steps. Thus, I make my final plea.
VOTE! Please! Not in the general election on Nov. 2, but i
the special election for Student Council Educational Polic
Representative right now and every other election until yo
graduate.. Fifty percent voter turnout is pathetic! You don'
know any of the candidates? Sacrifice a page of reading an
read a platform or two. Oh, you do know them
and yo
hate each of them? If you don't think they're fit to serve, the
by all means vote "None of the above"! If an academic depart
ment wants an evaluation of a professor
Write it! If the

Senior class officers will be elected next week

Combat Stockholm Syndrome with perfect hatred
On August 23, 1973, two
gunmen took four bank
employees hostage in the
of
Sveriges Kreditbank
Stockholm, Sweden. After
five days the hostages were
rescued and the robbers
were apprehended. The
freed hostages felt gratitude
towards their liberators,
the Swedish police, right?
Wrong. In fact, they resisted the Swedish authorities' efforts to rescue them
TARU TAYLOR
and they defended their
captors. This phenomenon,
Gadfly
of terrorized captives emotionaUy bonding with their
captors and resenting their
liberators, was called "Stockholm Syndrome" by Nils
Bejerot, a psychologist who assisted police during the robbery.

Here we see Newton's Third Law of Motion, that every
action has an opposite and equal reaction, applying to psychology as well as physics, emotion as well as motion. The
captors' action was terror and threat of death. The captives'
reaction was Stockholm Syndrome. The term has universal
application. Any captives hopelessly trapped, isolated and
terrorized are vulnerable to this survival mechanism.
Abused children, battered wives, concentration camp prisoners, prostitutes controlled by a pimp and cult members

16

have all been diagnosed with Stockholm Syndrome.
Tyranny is terror institutionalized. In the USA that
means institutional white supremacy. Many whites wishfully think that so long as they are neither Ku Klux
Klansmen nor neo-Nazis, they are not white supremacists.
But white supremacy is not so narrow and crude. It is comprehensive. It has subtlety and finesse. It is the dominant
ideology of America. Just as those Swedish hostages spent
five days trapped in an 11 x 47 ft. bankvault, Negro exiles
have spent four centuries trapped within the margins of
American society, traumatized by what Alexis de
Tocqueville called "the tyranny of the majority."
American history since the 1660s is the context within
which I diagnose black America as a case of Stockholm
Syndrome. To the antebellum slavers of yesterday, and to
the Jim Crow segregationists of today, Negro lives were and
are worthless lest they cooperate with yesterday's Manifest
Destiny and today's New World Order. House Negroes cooperate by becoming tokens of honorary white status. Field
Negroes cooperate by killing each other and filling prisons.
Historically, we can see that the Talented Tenth's hostility towards popular black liberators such as Booker T.
Washington and Marcus Garvey is a symptom of Stockholm
Syndrome, much like the Swedish hostages' hostility
towards their liberators. Indeed, Dußois's contempt and
hatred of Washington and Garvey was exceeded only by his
admiration and love of the white man's burden. Unlike
Dußois's house Negroes, field Negroes refuse to love Uncle
Tom style. They hold onto their hatred of the white man in
order to hold on to their integrity the best way they know
how. For them, to be black is to be angry. But that anger can

September 16, 2004

quickly turn into gratitude for those given the opportunity
to be "somebody," that is, to assimilate into whiteness. In a
white supremacist society, "equal opportunity" connotes
the opportunity to be white.
The only way out of this emotional dilemma of anger and
gratitude, of resentment and Stockholm Syndrome, is volitional "perfect hatred." The slave reacts to his master. The
victim reacts to his abuser. The militant proacts, regardless
of his circumstance. Saint Augustine defined perfect hatred
as follows: "Since no one is evil by nature, but anyone who
is evil is evil because of a perversion of nature, the man who
lives by God's standards has a duty of 'perfect hatred'
towards those who are evil; that is to say, he should not hate
the person because of the fault, nor should he love the fault
because of the person. He should hate the fault, but love the
man." For Malcolm- X, that meant no longer hating the
white man. It meant perfectly hating the white man's burden. Before he left the Nation of Islam, he hated white devils. After he left to found both the Organization of AfroAmerican Unity and the Muslim Mosque Inc., he perfectly
hated white supremacy. Before, he was a stereotypical
angry black man. After, he was the archetype of black
power. From the resentment of the slave to the perfect
hatred of the militant
thus transcended Malcolm X.
Every black man who would be a man must follow his path
of enlightenment. To be a man is to be a militant. To be less
is to be a slave.

Ultimate Frisbee team is ready to kick

it's just a bunch of friends goofing off,
or two, that it's a cult of guys fanatically devoted to the sport. The women

to staying compeitive.

Men's Frisbee
Scubber, hammer and thummer.
Believe it or not, these are actual
sports terms.
For the men's Ultimate Frisbee
team, these throws are some of the
skills the players have been practicing
this week.

The Earthworms are a visible
presence on campus, diving across
Mertz field for the disc. While you
may not be as pumped up over a flying
Frisbee, this year's team has excitement to spare. "This team is awesome," Gabe Rogers 'O5 said. "We're
going to win the universe!" This is
Rogers' fourth year playing with the
Earthworms.
This year's team certainly has

plenty of eager players, rostering
around 35 guys, enough to field five
separate teams. Captains Alan Smith
'O5, Jacob Wallace 'O5 and Arpy
Saunders 'O6 prepare this team in
every fashion as they come up with
drills for practice, organize transportation to matches and communicate with the Ultimate Players
Association. As a club team, the
responsibility to practice and train
falls entirely on the players.
"Upperclassmen are excited to
teach this new core," Rogers said, and
they better be, with "billions and billions of freshmen." There is plenty to
learn, as the men have four different

defenses and offenses, along with
them compete at the
highest level.
No matter how organized and

plays that help

intense the team members may seem,
they still remember to follow "the
spirit of the game," the main belief
behind Ultimate that everyone should
respect each other and play fair. As
cool as winning is, having fun is

always the number-one priority.
Next time you spot a guy diving
across Mertz field to snag a disc,
instead of scoffing, respect the commitment that keeps the Earthworms
community growing.

Mullan Center making small improvements this year
BY TARIQ FISCHER
tfischel@swarthmore.edu
Swatties have never been known for
their rippling muscles.
That truism may be going the way of the
football team. Why? Because the Mullan
Tennis Center, home to Swarthmore's fitness center, expanded its facilities with the

addition of three elliptical machines on
Wednesday.

"I would like more floor
space. We squeezed
every inch out of that
room we could."
Mike Mullan
Mullan Center director
The much-anticipated machines are
part of what avid patron and Registrar
Martin Warner calls a "continuous
improvement approach." The center,
named for tennis coach and professor Mike
Mullan, uses funds from the annual operating budget. Although exact figures were
unavailable, Site Manager Tom Narkin
praised President Al Bloom for this year's
sizable investment.
"The administration's response has
been pretty quick this time, thanks to
President
Narkin
said.
Bloom,"
"Sometimes the process takes much
longer." Many students expressed discontent last year as cardio machines remained

out of order for months. The problem fell
on the equipment and its supplier, not the
administration and organization of the

Like a long snapper, the gym usually
only gets feedback when something goes
wrong. However, Warner and other Mullan
frequenters seem satisfied with the
Center's level of operation: "As soon as
something breaks, they flag it to get it
quickly repaired," Warner said. "They're
very responsible," Mischa Stevens 'O6, an
employee at Mullan, said. "It's an incredi-

bly-run center. I have amazing employers."
Despite the occasional absence of cardio
machines and the size of the cardio and
weight room, the center is frequented by
many Swatties throughout the day. "The
place is packed wall to wall during peak
hours," Narkin said. Mullan also has
visions of improvement. "I would like more
floor space. We squeezed every inch out of
that room that we could."
When asked about the possible installation of televisions in the gym, Mullan
responded, "We did consider it at one time,
but it seemed a bit extravagant for Swat."

Swarthmore is bulking up.

Come on, laugh. The Yankees are funny.
BY TAKI MICHAELIDIS
cmichael@swarthmore.edu
I don't understand why baseball fans hate the Yankees.
Isn't it funny when a team spending $250 million loses?
Three years ago, Mariano Rivera coughs up a broken bat
single to Luis Gonzalez, and buddy Steinbrenner's astronomic payroll suddenly doesn't look so hot. And then next
y ar, it's the Angels, then the Marlins? The Yankees are
funny. They get the worst bang for the buck in all of professional sports, and their business model is a joke.
Every year the Yankees lead the league in payroll.
Every year they make grandiose midseason acquisitions.
Last year, they traded for Aaron Boone and Javier
Vazquez. This year it was Esteban Loaiza. Yet these acquisitions have been disasters: Boone destroyed his knee and
Vazquez and Loaiza have been atrocious. However, at the
time of their trades to the Yankees, Boone and Vazquez
were about to become free agents, and few teams in the
playoff race could risk trading valuable prospects for
Boone and Vazquez and have them leave the next year as
free agents. However, as the highest bidders around, the
Yankees have the lowest risk associated with trading for
soon-to-be free agents.
But here's the problem: The Yankees' extraordinary
payroll flexibility does allow them to trade for overpriced
veterans and sign free agents above their market value.
Yet, this strategy has left the Yankees with little youth
and a bloated payroll. When the Yankees overpaid for
Jason Giambi by giving him $l2O million over seven
years, they were paying for a 31-year-old first baseman

18

who had just finished four stellar seasons with the
Oakland A's. Derek' Jeter signed his astronomical $l4O
million deal at the age of 29. Mike Mussina signed his $BB
million deal at 3L All three players have seen huge drops
in production.
Statistically speaking, baseball players tend to peak in
their late 20s before experiencing gradual declines in their
abilities. The Roger Clemens and Randy Johnsons of the
world are rare exceptions. Most players are already in
decline by their early 30s. Do you see where this is going?
The Yankees spend astronomical amounts of money, bankrupt their farm system - and for what? Star players that
are about to experience marked drops in their production.
In the interests of understanding why the Yankees model
will always underperform, just look at the poor boys in the

league.
For various reasons pertaining to stadium deals, market size and revenue streams, the A's and Twins have been
forced to compete with payrolls approximately one-quarter
the size of the Yankees payroll. As a result the A's and
Twins have chosen to watch their best players
Jason
Giambi, Miguel Tejada, Jason Isringhausen, Eddie
leave to
Guardado and Latroy Hawkins among them
free agency because of their rising salary expectations.
However, these teams repeatedly make the playoffs. But
how? What people don't realize is that money doesn't equal
success in Major League baseball. Not even close.
Why doesn't money buy love? Well, there's luck. The
truth is that every year some teams get lucky and get
career years from a number of players. There's always
some team that has a mediocre run differential (runs

September 16, 2004

scored-runs allowed) but an exceptional record. That's

just

lucky. But there's another reason why money doesn't
equal success. Teams are increasingly ignoring high
school prospects in favor of drafting college players. As
ESPN repeatedly noted, of all the college pitchers drafted
from 1989 to 1999,62 percent ended up pitching in the Major
Leagues. In contrast, only 43 percent of high school pitchers drafted made it to the Majors. College players are a statistically more dependable investment.
The result of more conservative drafting strategies has
been that the minor leagues' top prospects tend to be
older. Older into the minors means older into the majors.
When Minor Leaguers first break into the Major Leagues,

they don't make top dollar right away. Rather, they must
use up their option years and five arbitration years before
entering free agency. So, by the time players reach free
agency they are already 29- or 30-years-old. Enter the

Yankees. They sweep in and pay top dollar. However,
these players are worth top dollar for only a few years at

best.
The Oakland A's, the Minnesota Twins and the Florida
Marlins have used a different strategy: draft carefully,
stock the minor league system, avoid high-cost free agents

and allow players to develop to their potential. But,
because the Yankees have no patience, they trade away
their best prospects before they develop. As a result, their
only source of players is the free agent market. Can you
imagine what the Yankees would be like if Steinbrenner
could keep his pants on for a couple of years and let their
minor league system restock? They would be unstoppable.

Laugh, it's funny.

single piece of clothing that is consistently worn by a multitude
of university students. It is even harder to discover a single
accessory that is equally popular among diverse segments of the
student body Around the University of Virginia today, however,
many students can be spotted making an identical fashion statement: a plain, yellow band worn on their wrist, imprinted with
the motto, LIVESTRONG.
These bracelets

convey a world of meaning in their simple but powerful statement.
"Wear Yellow: Live Strong" was the motto that Olympic
cyclist and five-time Tour de France champion Lance
Armstrong adopted when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. His cycling career was at its peak when he received the lifechanging news in 1996. He was only 25 years old. At a moment
when Armstrong might have thrown in the towel, he chose to
take an active role in the fight for cancer by creating the Lance
Armstrong Foundation in 1997. Through the LAF, Armstrong
vowed to help educate people around the world about the ways
to overcome cancer and assist those who are battling the disease, according to www.laf.org.
One way in which Armstrong chose to spread his subtle, yet
powerful, mantra to "live strong" was through the creation of

with those words. The bracelet
color was chosen to match the yellow jersey that Armstrong
wears during the Tour de France.
Armstrong's goal for the LAF was to raise $5 million to support cancer victims the world over. The project proved to have a

Swarthmore will host the Garnet Classic this
weekend, with its first game Saturday at 9 a.m.

11 million people across
America and around the world have purchased bracelets, and in
doing so, raised approximately $ll million for cancer research.
Many students at the university are proud to say that they
can be among the multitude of individuals who support the LAF.
First-year student Carolyn Kener grew up in Austin, Texas,
where the LAF was originally founded.
"The foundation was so large and popular in my area, and it
is one of the most efficient fund-raisers for cancer victims,"
Kener said.
Kener also had a personal reason for buying her commemorative bracelet.
"My dad had cancer, so this is the easiest way I know to support ongoing cancer research," she said.
Other college students said they also supported this cause
because they have experienced the tragedy of cancer on a personal level.
"I wear the yellow 'Live Strong' bracelet in remembrance of
my father, who died eight months ago," first-year student Wendy
Hudspeth said. "He was always my biggest supporter in whatever I did, so this is my way of supporting him. Every time I see
the bracelet I think of my dad, and it makes me sad, but it also
gives me courage and hope."
Besides purchasing the bracelet online from LAF's official
Web site, students have also been influenced to buy the yellow
bracelets because of the support that the LAF has received
from businesses around the nation, such as Nike and other
sports stores. These stores, aside from donating money directly to the organization, have ordered large quantities of the
bracelets in order to help educate the public on the positive
progress that the LAF is making in the fight against cancer.
Nike has raised an additional $5 million in its sales of the "Live
Strong" bracelets.
"One day when I had finished shopping in Champs Sports
and was checking out, the cashier asked me if I was interested
in purchasing a 'Live Strong' bracelet," first-year student
Thomas Puryear said. "It was the first time I had ever heard
about them. I decided to buy it because it was for a charitable
cause."
Other students said they decided to buy the bracelet not only
because the purchase supports the fight against cancer but also
because the bracelets are becoming a popular trend. First-year
student Sara Stinson said she believes that these bracelets serve
multiple purposes.
"My two best friends from high school got them, and I felt
bad about not having one because it seemed like everyone had
them," Stinson said. "It's such a cheap way to support a good
cause, and it's a good conversation starter here at the univer-

Women's volleyball falls to 2-7

GENEVRA PITTMAN

The Garnet volleyball team came out strong in its
home opener Tuesday night, but eventually fell to a
tough squad from Franklin and Marshall, 3-0 (30-32,
24-30, 17-30). The match followed a disappointing
weekend for the Garnet, in which it dropped three
out of four matches at the Muhlenberg Buttermaker
Tournament, and brought its record to 2-7 on the

season.
At the tournament, Swarthmore recorded losses to
Dickinson 3-1 (26-30, 30-22, 27-30, 17-30), FDU-Madison
3-0 (16-30,16-30, 22-30), and Albright 3-0 (31-33, 28-30, 2230). The team managed to close out the tournament on
a better note, beating Montclair State by a score of 3-1

(30-28, 23-30, 30-27, 30-21).
"I think we were all a little disappointed," co-captain Natalie Dunphy 'O5 said of the team's performance in the tournament. "Things weren't clicking for

us."

Despite the rough weekend, the Garnet was fired
up for its first game of the season at the Tarble
Pavilion against the talented Diplomats, who came
into the match at 4-0. The fans brought equal amounts
of energy, as drum beats and spirited chants could be
heard throughout the early games.

Swarthmore came out

looking

formidable in the

first game of the match. Erica George 'O7 opened her
service with an ace and led the team on a 6-0 run before
the Diplomats called a time out. The Garnet continued
their tough play, winning a long rally to take a 13-5 lead
before Franklin and Marshall made a run of their own
to tie the game at 15 and then opened up a 21-18 lead. At
23-21 (Diplomats lead), a save by Emily Conlon 'O6 on a

ball heading out of bounds followed by a block by
Karen Berk 'OB gave Swarthmore the ball back, and a
point later the score was tied again at 23.
But the Diplomats pulled ahead again, 26-24 and 2926, before the Garnet fended off three game points
with an ace by Conlon and a tip by Vanessa Wells 'OB

THE PHOENIX

to even the score at 29. After a mix up on the Franklin
and Marshall side and two mistakes by Swarthmore,
a lift was called on Wells, and the Diplomats took the
game by a narrow 32-30 margin.

The Garnet started the second game on a strong
run as well, opening up a 5-1 lead early on. But
Franklin and Marshall went on a run of its own to
take a 6-5 lead, and the game remained gruelingly
close for most of its duration. Swarthmore tied the
game at seven, after which the teams tied on each of
the next 10 points. The two teams then went on alternate runs, as the Diplomats led 20-17 before the Garnet
tied the game at 20 and then at 23. That was the last
time they would be even, however, as the Diplomats
closed out the game at 30-24 to push the Garnet to the
brink of its seventh defeat.
Franklin and Marshall was in full control for most
of the third game, gaining an early 7-2 lead and then
continuing its dominance to go up 18-8 midway
through the game. Swarthmore responded with a run
that included two spikes by Dunphy to come within
three points at 18-15, but the Diplomats responded
with their own run and went up 23-15 before the
Garnet called a timeout. But talking things over did
not help the situation, and Franklin and Marshall
closed out the game with another run to finish off the
Garnet by a score of 30-17.
"Today we came out really strong," George said.
"Once we got stuck in a passing rut, we just got frustrated and lost our intensity." However, she said, "I
think in general we're playing really well and build-

ing team chemistry."
In spite of the outcome, coach Harleigh Leach was
pleased with her team's play in its first Centennial
Conference match of the season. "It was a good effort,
this was a very good conference team," Leach said.
"We definitely improved upon our play from last

Amateur hour
in the NCAA
While most college football talk this week has surrounded
the early upsets of Florida State, Michigan and Kansas State
(along with the customary bitching and moaning about the
BCS), very little attention has been paid to two players who
didn't take the field this season: Jeremy Bloom and Mike
Williams. Sadly, neither will

don a jersey for his universities ever again.

Let's start with Bloom. For
two years, he played wide-out

for the Colorado Buffaloes and
emerged as one of the best
kick returners in the nation,
all the while staying in top
form as a world-champion
freestyle skier. Last winter,
when Bloom could no longer
afford to cover all the expenses of training with the U.S. Ski
MATT SCHILLER
Team, he began to accept
endorsement money to pay for
his preparation for the 2006
Winter Olympics. However, as
an NCAA "scholar-athlete" (I
shudder at the use of a term that makes Shaquille O'Neal a
former scholar), you are not allowed to earn a cent for your
athletic contributions. Of course, your school can make millions of jerseys as your number fly off the shelves, while
advertising companies shell out dough to broadcast your
accomplishments on live TV. If that isn't sports at its purist, I
don't know what is.
Now, you might say that Bloom should've followed the
rules if he wanted to take advantage of having a scholarship
and an opportunity to compete under the national spotlight.
After all, it's all in the spirit of amateurism. Surely, that must
explain why University of Miami star Willie Williams, who's
been arrested 11 times since 1999 - I'm not making that number up, I swear won't be playing this season either. In reality, Williams is out with torn knee ligaments; the NCAA has
done nothing. You could argue that you'd have to be an amateur to get busted so many times in such a short timespan,
but I've got to think that this wasn't the sort of amateurism
the NCAA was going for. In the meantime, even though
Bloom offered to postpone his acceptance of the money until
his graduation and even donated some of his winnings to
charity, his football career is over. Don't forget that former
Heisman Trophy winner Chris Weinke was one of many athletes to give Minor League baseball a shot (and get paid for it)
before returning to compete in the college ranks.
For those of you sticklers who still think that rules are
rules, look at what happened to USC wide receiver Mike
Williams. After Maurice Clarett challenged the NFL's rule
barring anyone from declaring for the draft without being
three years removed from high school, Williams, a sophomore, decided to follow suit, hoping the extra money for his
family would outweigh the loss of a year in college (he likely
would've turned pro before graduating anyway). So, Williams
dropped out of school and hired an agent, only to have an
appeals court reverse the original ruling and uphold the
NFL's rule. Williams, stuck in a tough position by the change
in rules, began taking summer school classes to meet the
NCAA's academic requirements, promptly fired his agent and
returned all the money he'd collected. By that point, it was
already too late. The NCAA ruled that he wasn't allowed back.
It didn't matter that he never would've left school in the first
place had the rules not allowed for it.
Before we all shed a tear for these two victims, let's
remember that Williams will likely still become a millionaire
as a first round pick in 2005, and Bloom is now free to line his
pockets with as much endorsement money as he can manage.
However, the premise of not allowing these guys to return to
school because it compromises the integrity of the NCAA is
ridiculous, if for no other reason than it implies that the
NCAA still has some integrity left. Until the NCAA makes
some attempt to pull its reality back into the same universe as
its ideals, there really is no better word to describe it than
'amateur.'

Men's rugby opens season with wins

BY DARCY NELSON
dnelsonl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore Evil Buzzards descended and
devoured its competition Sunday. Winning the red division of the 2004 Media RFC Liberty Cup Tournament,
the men's rugby team dominated three teams, including two historic rivals, Ursinus and St. Joseph's.
The first victory came when the team defeated West
Chester B 12-0 with two tries (five points each) and one
conversion, adding an extra two points. Brandt
Rakowski 'O6 scored two tries in the first game. Co-captain Jon Fombonne 'O5, who plays second row, tallied
all of the conversions. A great defensive effort by
Rakowski aided in the shutout against West Chester B.
Rakowski dove on a loose ball in the end zone, causing
the West Chester players to fumble the ball.
The team then went on to defeat St. Joseph's, a
tough, respectable opponent.
"We haven't played them in many years, but they
have a great reputation within the EPRU [Eastern
Pennsylvania Rugby Union]," co-captain and scrumhalf Randy Goldstein 'O5 said.
The 3-0 score came from a penalty kick scored by
Fombonne.
The Buzzards triumphed again in its third and final
game, posting a 5-0 win over Ursinus.
Rookie Sherief Raouf 'OB scored the only try in the
last minutes of the game against Ursinus.
"It was probably the best start Swat rugby has ever
had in my experience playing here," Emiliano
Rodriguez 'O5 said. "Our defense was incredible; we
weren't scored on. Given how elementary a lot of players' understanding of the game was, it was incredible to
see people play rugby that well."
Fombonne was proud of the effort that the team put
forward at the tournament. "In the four years I've been
at Swat, we've relied a lot on certain individuals, but
this time, we really played as a team. No one really
stood out; it was a team effort," Fombonne said. "St.
Joe's was ranked much higher than us, but we outSeptember 16,

2004

played them, even though we lost a lot of good seniors
last year. At the tournament, everyone got to play, and
there were some impressive performances by Alex
Ginsburg 'OB, Raouf, and Beex Buechner '05."
"We have a great rookie class. It is probably the
largest and most talented we have had in recent years,"

Goldstein said.
In addition to the strong first-year class, the team
will be looking for great contributions this season from
Tevye Kelman 'O6 as a fullback and John Turcik 'O5 as
an eightman. "Tevye was definitely our MVP this weekend," Rodriguez said. Also, flanker Brendan Bond 'O5,
prop Rodriguez, fly-halfRakowski, and center Jonathan
Augat 'O7 will play big roles on the team.
The ruggers are coached by Brian Sloman, who is

back for the first season since he coached the team in
the 1980s. "We are looking forward to getting a new perspective on the game with [Sloman]," Fombonne said.
Sloman was very impressed by the team's performance this weekend. "I'm not sure I had myself convinced, but they obviously believed in themselves as

they went out and blanked Ursinus, West Chester B and
St. Joseph's, the latter an old nemesis now playing in a
whole division above ours," Sloman said, "there were
some highlights, but I can't and wouldn't single out any

playe. We won as a team."

With such a successful tournament on their record,
the Evil Buzzards have high hopes for the season. "If we
keep playing the way we did this past weekend, we have
a good chance of winning our division," Fombonne
said.
The eastern division includes Lafayette, Lehigh,
Widener, and Swarthmore, while the western division
is comprised of York, Bucknell, and Ursinus. The winner of each division plays for the championship at the
end of the season. "We have proven that we are a good
team defensively, and as new players learn the game
and we develop some creative offense, we may be able
to win our division," Fombonne said.
The Buzzards will hit the pitch against Lafayette
this Saturday at 2 p.m. on Cunningham Field.
