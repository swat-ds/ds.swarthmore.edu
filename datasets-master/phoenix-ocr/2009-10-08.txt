Corrections
FROM THE OCT. 1, 2009 ISSUE:
The staff editorial titled "Multitude of voices have diluted power of
protest" falsely reported that the G2O economic summit convened
at the University of Pittsburgh. The summit convened at the David
L. Lawrence Convention Center.
The sports brief titled "volleyball undefeated in early conference

score of 3-1 on Sept. 5. Franklin & Marshall was the victor, defeating Swarthmore by a score of 3-1.

Israeli teenagers speak out against their military
BY DANTE FUOCO

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu
American
many
While
teenagers spend their senior

years of high school writing college essays or applying for jobs,
two Israeli women who spoke at
the college yesterday prepared
themselves for a much different
future: prison.
Both 19 years-old, Maya
Wind and Netta Mishly spent
time in prison earlier this year
for refusing to serve in Israel's
mandatory military service
because, according to Wind,
they are politically opposed to
the Israeli military's actions, in
occupied territories in Palestine
and Israeli territories. The two
women spoke in Science Center
101 yesterday.

The event, called "Why We
Refuse," is part of their roughly
month-long national "Shminstim
Tour" that has stopped at various universities, synagogues and
community centers.

Students for Democratic
Society, the Peace Collection,
and the Peace and Conflict
Studies program co-sponsored
the event.
SDS
member
Majandra Rodriguez 'l2 said
that, as SDS is "focusing on different social issues and organizing protests," it was relevant to
have Mishly and Wind speak at
the college.
After all, Rodriguez said, the
two women aimed to not only
talk about the Israeli army's
occupation but also introduce
"ways to mobilize people
around this issue." Rodriguez

heard about the tour because
she went to an IB school with
Wind in India.
In an interview before the
event, Wind said, "As civilians,
we decided to protest our government's policy."
During their senior year of
high school, Wind, Mishly, and
eight other Israeli seniors
became part of the informal
group the "Shminstim," which
means "twelfth-graders" in
Hebrew. In 2008, they drafted a
letter openly declaring their
refusal to serve in the Israeli
army due to their opposition of
its practices.
The letter states: "Our
refusal comes first and foremost
as a protest on the separation,
control, oppression and killing
policy held by the state of Israel
in the occupied territories, as
we understand that this oppression, killing and routing of
hatred will never lead us to
peace, and they are all contradictory to the basic values a
society that pretends to be democratic should have."
By publicly voicing refusal to
serve in the military and, as a
result, going to prison, the
Shminstim was able to get "a
platform to have a voice," Wind
said.
"[We were] expanding our
ground and making a public
protest and saying to everyone
in our society and to the government, 'This is not something
we are willing to do. And we feel
so strongly about it we're willing to go to jail,'" she said. "It's
a pretty extreme statement, and

then people listen."
By coming to the U.S., Wind
and Mishly wanted to "share the
story of the occupation" and
also communicate that the U.S.
provides military aid to Israel.
"The U.S. is the one funding
the occupation," Wind said.
"[lsrael] could not do it without
the U.S."
Israeli-Palestinian issues,
both religiously and politically,
have historically been highly
controversial. During the tour,
which finishes tomorrow, Wind
said that she believes there is "a
lot of misinformation out
there," citing that many people
have "attacked" and "chal-

lenged" her and Mishly.

"It's pretty intense," Wind
said. "They think we exaggerate

asking
"many
questions."
Though there was one person
who claimed "Israel is always
blamed," Rodriguez didn't indicate this was agressive.
About 70 people attended.
Since the event was open to the
community, Rodriguez said the
attendants were not only stu-

dents but also members from

peace groups and Jewish groups.

I talked to people after the event,
people [said they] loved it."
Rodriguez also said that
Mishly and Wind were "suc...

cint," "clear" and "educational"
in stating their points.
Israeli citizens prepare for
their mandatory conscription
during twelfth-grade. Wind said
that her draft date was Jan. 14 of
this year and Mishly's was Apr.
22. When a student voices
refusal to conscription, he or
she must have a hearing before
a conscientious objectors committee, Wind said. The problem
is what the committee deems as
legitimate reasons for conscientious objections.
"Their definition of a conscientious objector is a 'pacifist'...
and all of us were 'political
refusers,'
she said. "I myself
am a pacifist, but not everyone
in the group is."
Wind said that she was tried
five separate times, served
three terms in prison and three
terms in military detention. She
went to prison in the middle of
January and went back and
forth from it until the beginning
to
April.
According
of

being released.

The women were released on
the grounds that they were
"mentally unfit to serve.... [This
is] a way to get rid of us and
sort of disqualify us. ~..
Pathologize us, also," Wind said.
Mishly said in an interview
on Grit TV that going to jail
isn't the only consequence of
politically refusing to serve in
Israel's military.
"The most important part is
that we risk our place in society," Mishly said. "We're becoming outsiders, and this is much
harder than going to jail. The
experience, wherever you go
and it doesn't matter who you
meet, one of the first questions
is, 'What did you do in the
army?' or 'What, at this age, are
you doing in the army?'
Wind added in the same interview that most job applications
ask applicants what rank they
served in the military. If the
employer discovers that an
applicant did not serve in the
army for political reasons, he or
she will often turn down that

applicant immediately.

Wind said that she was more
scared about jail before she got
there: "[I wasn't sure] how it
would be, how I would feel.
Would I handle it? Was I strong
enough?" After getting to
prison, though, "to some level
you get used to it."
"Obviously being in prison

was not fun," but "it's not
Guantanamo," she said. "It's
not like we were ever physically
[There was] nothing
abused
worse than verbal abuse.
Compared to Palestinian prisons, we have nothing to complain about."
Wind said in the Grit TV
interview that this letter of
open opposition roots back to
the 1970s when high school seniors expressed their opposition.
Only in 2001 and 2005, however,
have the letters echoed 2008's
refusal to serve.

Bike-sharing program
under consideration
BY LINDA HOU

rhoul@swarthmore.edu

Since their start in Amsterdam

during the 19705, bike-sharing programs have spread to cities and colleges worldwide. In last week's
Student Council meeting, Student

Council President Rachel Bell 'lO

proposed a bike-sharing project for
the college.
A bike-sharing project would
have public bikes for use by students. Options include having
bikes at designated areas around
campus for pick-up anytime or
renting bikes out for certain periAndrew Cheng Phoenix Staff

ods.
Bell gave three main reasons for
such a program.
First, it would aid students who
need to run errands outside the college but within riding distances.
Second, the program allows students who are living in dorms far-

ther from campus, but who do not
want to buy a bike just for a year, to
be able to ride a bike to the center
of campus. Both of these reasons
would decrease shuttle use and
make the campus more environmentally friendly. Finally, the program would provide a fun recreational activity for students.
Bell said that she first began
thinking about the idea over the
summer. Her brother helped start a
similar program in Carleton
College, and Bell enjoys biking
recreationally. When she returned
to school this year, Bell was
approached by Adam Bortner 12,
who had a similar bike-sharing program in mind for the college.
Though the idea is still in its
early stages, Bell hopes to finish the
planning process by Thanksgiving.
She would like to first start a pilot

program with a few bikes and then

extend it campus-wide.

Power Shift, 350 to raise environmental awareness
BY HANNA

KOZLOWSKA
hkozlowl@swarthmore.edu

In the week following October
break, environmentally-minded
student groups will be introducing new modes, of outreach, both
on and off campus. Earthlust will
a
be kicking off a "350 Week"
week of events devoted to raising
awareness about its environmental initatives, and for the first
time ever, the GoodFood Project
will be presenting a workshop at
an environmental conference.
Good Food at Power Shift
The Good Food Project has
been invited to speak at the
Power Shift Regional Summit, a
conference devoted to facilitating
activism for environmental
issues. It will be held on October
24 on Penn State University. Ben
Dair 'll is preparing a workshop
for the conference.
"We want to help other student groups, talk to them about
local foods, composting, gardens," Jamie Hansen-Lewis, one
of Good Food's leaders, said.
Power Shift is a part of the
Energy Action Coalition, a youth
initiative composed of environmental organizations
from
around the country, dedicated to
promoting and supporting the
clean energy movement. Power
Shift 'O9, a national conference,
brought 12,000 activists to
Capitol Hill to show legislators
their concern with action on climate and energy. This year, 11
Regional Summits are aimed at
lobbying for a clean energy jobs
plan to be passed by Congress by
December.
The Power Shift website (powershifto9.org) calls for people to
act on these goals, saying that
"we can create millions of jobs

pay."

The Pennsylvania Summit
will include lectures, panels,
training and workshops. The
Good Food workshop, which will
be conducted with Dickinson
College, is called "Campus Food
Systems."
"We want a more creative
workshop than your standard
picture presentation," Hansen.

Lewis said. She and Dair haven't
decided on the specifics yet.
Good Food wants to share the
keys its success in changing
some of Swarthmore's food policies with other colleges. Good
Food launched the composting
program and has been engaged
in promoting local, organic food
on campus through the "Look
Local" campaign.
The group is entirely studentrun a status publicized by its
members. "It appears that we
have less institutional support,
because we have no 'director,'
but the administration has been
supportive," Hansen-Lewis said.
"It is good that the garden is a
legitimate student space."
Besides the "good, coopera-

tive dynamic with the administration," Lewis said that the
small size of the garden is an
advantage because it makes the
project more manageable.
Earthlust and non-affiliated
students are also attending the
event. It was, in fact, thanks to
Earthlust that Good Food
received an invitation. Earthlust
has been working with Power
Shift for some time.
"If I have any goal or if we
have any goal, it's for everyone
to find an avenue that they're
really interested in and learning
and growing from it," said Zein
Nakhoda 'l2, one of the leaders of
Earthlust.
Nakhoda also emphasized the
importance of networking at
Power Shift. "It would be nice if
we teach each other about what
we're doing on national campuses. Communication is the biggest
thing," he said. He hopes that the
members of Earthlust will get to
know each other and other
Swarthmore
students
that
choose to attend.
While at Power Shift.
Nakhoda would also like to pursue his own interests, which
include the power of direct
action in social movements and
the solidarity economy, an idea
born out of Latin American
countries. It proposes an alternate economic system that
involves self-governed, selfowned local production.
Powershift is a forum where
Nakhoda can explore his interests. "The good thing about
Powershift is that they have a
very wide range of entry points
into the social justice component
of the environmental movement," he said. "[Powershift]
breaks down a lot of the environeconomy
ment
versus
dichotomies that get presented
as reasons why the environmental movement can't succeed."

350 Week
In the week leading up to.
Powershift, Earthlust will host
350 Week on campus to raise
awareness about unsafe levels of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and to encourage students
to reduce carbon output through
consumer pressure, political
pressure and personal choices.
"Our 350 Week is centered on
the number 350," Nakhoda said.
Three hundred fifty is the safe
upper limit for the amount of
carbon dixoide in the atmosphere, a.quantity measured in
parts per million. Currently the
carbon dioxide of the earth's
atmostphere is above that level,
at 390 ppm. If the carbon dioxide
remains at this level, there will
be irreversible environmental
consequences,
including the
melting of the Greenland ice
sheet.
But Nakhoda explained that
the week is about more than just
a number. "It's about people
becoming engaged in the change

to a more environmentally just
way of living

...

and then learn-

ing how each person can engage
in their own way."

Olivia Natan Phoenix Staff

The Good Food garden will be one of the topics covered at the group's Power Shift presentation.
A general
letter from
Earthlust to the students
explains the week's goal. "As a
Swarthmore commuity, we are
among the most environmentally privileged in the world.
With the right intention and

information, every one of us
has the potential to drastically
reduce our energy footprint."
Many of the events are just
fun activities for students
a
t-shirt tie-dye session, a variety show performance, and a

party.

But

Nakhoda

hopes that these events will
draw students in to hear the
group's message. "We might
put up a presentation between
acts of the variety show," he

said.

Burson proposed hosting a
forum for students interested
in an interdisciplinary studies major.
The forum will target student concerns on the effect of
budget cuts on academic
affairs and will focus on
methods to strengthen interdisciplinary studies.
Burson also discussed
ways to encourage students
to design a special major.
Burson believes that if many
students were to begin focusing on a specific self-designed
major, departments would be

6

prompted to provide a cohesive program for that major.
With finances and financial
aid issues currently dominating the scene at Swarthmore,
Burson hopes to find a "quiet
week" to host the forum.
In the second part of her
initiative on educational policy, Burson hopes to create
Student Advisory Boards in
each department. The boards
will be designed to assist the
department chair with different departmental affairs,
including planning for social
affairs within the department, student advising on
curriculum requirements,
and student-faculty communication.
The board will be an
avenue for students to
express their concerns to
departmental chairs.

Burson hopes that this line
of communication will allow
students' interests to be better represented within the
department. Part of the problem, she believes, is that professors don't know what the
students are concerned about
and cannot coordinate the
curriculum to fit student
needs. Professors are enthusiastic about plans for the
board.
Plans for the boards are
still in the making. Student
Council continues to discuss
ways to select members of the
board.
Student-Administration
Relationship
In a continued effort to
improve the student-administration relationship, Student
Council discussed opening up

October 8, 2009

communication with other
colleges and universities with
good student-administration
relationships.
In line with this effort,
Student Council proposed an
idea that allows students to
"take their professors out to
lunch."
The idea, already used in
some universities and colleges, allows professors to
post dates online when they
are free for lunch.
Students could check the
website and sign up for open
spots for lunch with their
professors. Groups of students could have lunch with
their professors to discuss
pressing issues in class or
simply to socialize.
Student Council discussed
how this would be a good
draw for prospective students

looking for

an undergraduate

institution with close student-professor relationships.

Safety Walk
Student Council discussed
the recent initiative to
increase lighting on the
Swarthmore campus.
The safety walk with Vice
President for Facilities and
Services Stuart Hain to pinpoint areas of campus that
need better lighting is set for
7*30 p.m. on Oct. 10. The rain
date for the event will he Oct.

Bryn Mawr finalizes plans for gym renovations
BY SHEILA LOBO

BICONEWS.COM, OCT. 6, 2009

Renovation plans for Bryn Mawr
College's Schwartz Gymnasium are being
completed this week. The athletic department anticipates beginning construction in
December of this year, and the completion
date is set for August 2010. This is the first
time Schwartz Gym wil have been renovated since it was built, in 1982, by architect
Daniel Tully.
Joseph Marra, the current Bryn Mawr
College architect, said that the original
project was much larger in scope and twice
the budget. It included a separate building
for a fitness center with a connecting
bridge. However, by working with the
existing building, the budget was reduced
to $7.5 million.
"It's going to be quite a dramatic transformation," said President McAulliffe. "I
cannot wait."
More glass panels will be added in the
front of the building, gym, and pool area, to
reveal the building's expansiveness and
provide more daylight, Marra added. In
addition, other improvements to the facili-

ties include a new atrium in the front entry,
staffand coach offices on the first floor, and
an expanded fitness center. Currently, the
fitness center and cardio equipment, physical education classes, and free weights are
all housed in the same room.
"We're introducing a new fitness center
on the second floor with a multi-purpose
room with multimedia capabilities
inserted in that
space for classes
yoga,
such as

pilates,
dance,
kickboxing, etc.,"

said Marra.

When renovations begin, the
athletics depart-

ment

plans

and athletic teams all share lockers.
"They are really dingy," said Marra
about Schwartz's current lockers.
There are some electrical changes being
made, because equipment like treadmills
need dedicated electrical service.

"Once we determine what the capacity
is, we'll build from there. So for instance, if
we can take five
mmmmmmmmm
treadmills, then
we'll take five, and

and

To develop a
layout Tierney will enlist the help of a committee of athletes, students, and staff. They
will additionally help decide appropriate
hours, and to identify any access issues. To
resolve such access issues, Tierney will
also meet with representatives from vari-

to

move the main fitness center to the former
Rhoads Dining Hall. However, the room has
a much smaller capacity and different electrical capabilities, and not all of the equipment will move.
Marra explained that the locker facilities are in need of upgrading. Currently,
Bryn Mawr community, faculty, students,

ous campus offices, student life, campus

security, and dining services.

Alternative locations will also be needed
for physical education classes such as kickboxing, yoga, or Pilates because there will
not be available floor space.
"We're working now to start to identify
some of those spaces because those are* such
important classes for our students. They're
in our schedule [for the, spring semester].
Now it's just a matter of finding the available space," said Tierney. "That's challenging on our campus."
The pool will be closed and no swim
classes will be offered in the spring.
Instead, six swimming classes have been
offered this fall, and students who have not
met the proficiency requirement as of yet
have been contacted.
In addition, the offices of coaches and
physical education faculty and the athletic
training room will need to be relocated.
Tierney anticipates they will be housed in
temporary trailerfacilities.
"The focus was on creating a state-ofthe-art fitness center that our students
could be excited about. There will be natural light, it will be wireless and wi-fi compatible," said Tierney. "It's extremely exciting."

Safety at Founders dances Mawrtyrs Explore Norristown
questioned, problematic
BY HANNAH JAENICKE

BICONEWS.COM, SEPT. 27, 2009

BY AUDREY JOHNSTON

BICONEWS.COM, OCT. 6, 2009

Much of Haverford's history is

held within Founders Hall. As the
oldest building on campus, it has
been the site of classrooms, student
housing, and faculty and administrative offices. At present, many know

it best as the venue for the dances
that occur throughout the school
year.

While the high ceilings, windows,
big stage and overall spaciousness of
Founders make it a good venue,
recent incidents have caused the
Haverford community to consider
the risks involved in this particular
space.
On September 5, students at the
annual 80s dance were seen dancing

on the high windowsills and climbing onto the roof. The dance was shut
down by Safety and Security after
one student fell from a windowsill

and sustained serious injuries.

Students have danced on the windowsills in the past, and they occasionally venture up to the roof during campus events such as Dorm
Olympics. In light of such dangerous
behavior, collective efforts are being
made by the administration, Safety
and
Security,
Facilities
Management, and the student body
to ensure that Founders remains a
safe place for social events.
Steve Watter, Dean of Student
Life, Jason McGraw, Director of
Student Activities, and representatives from the Special Events
Committee for Students (SECS), the
Joint
Administrative
Student
Alcohol Policy Panel, and Quaker
Bouncers recently met to discuss the
situation. Following the meeting, an
email was sent out to students at
Haverford calling for heightened
awareness of safety at Founders
dances. In addition, new security

THE PHOENIX

measures were taken in hopes of
making Founders safer.
At a dance held there this past
weekend, the windows on the first
floor of the building were opened
only slightly to allow ventilation,
and the sills were lined with signs
asking students to remain on the
dance-floor. Streamers and otherdecorations were placed in the windows
to deter students from climbing up.
The second-story windows that
open out onto the roof were locked, a
precaution that is usually taken during Haverfest and similar occasions

when members of the administration
and Safety and Security believe it is
necessary to do so. More drastic

measures, such as barring the windows, have been proposed, but have
been rejected for now.
Tom King, Haverford's Director of
Safety and Security, said he had confidence in the added security measures and saw the situation as an
opportunity for the community to
learn from a series of "teachable
moments" and to engage in a conversation about safety at Haverford. He
emphasized the important role the
student body plays in evaluating the
safety of the campus.

Coral Walker, HC 'l2, a member of
SECS, expressed the importance of
conveying this message of safety to
students from the Tri-Co who come
for dances, and said that SECS was
looking into possible ways of doing
so. SECS may be considering alternative locations for dances, but
Founders is currently regarded as
the best place for large crowds and,
ultimately, one of the safer options
on campus.
Dean Watter spoke of the importance of students taking responsibility and collectively watching out for
each other: "We ask that students
use common sense and make sound
judgments about what they do."

A group of Bryn Mawr students headed to
Norristown on Friday afternoon to participate
in "A Taste of Norristown," an event sponsored
by the Civic Engagement Office aimed at
informing students about the town and its volunteer opportunities.
A tour of Norristown was organized by Rosa
Quintana, the community partnerships in

a support program
Alcamo Family Center

After School Program and Los Arcos Mexican

"We really rely on volunteer efforts from
folks like you," he said to the group of Bryn
Mawr students standing before him.
The visit to Aclamo sparked an interest
among some. "It seems like it's such a great program and being able to look at it before volunteering for it....1 think that was really great,"
said Tong. She's hoping to start volunteering
there soon.
The Salvation Army on Swede Street was
the next stop on the group's itinerary.
The Salvation Army offers an After-School
Program that consists of two programs. One
works with elementary school students and the
other focuses on teens, said Chantel Parnell 11
who was attending the trip and has volunteered
at the Salvation Army a few times a week since
the second semester ofher freshman year.

the children with arts and crafts, homework,
and other activities. "After long breaks, I like
going back to the Salvation Army and having
all the kids run up to me and give me hugs,"
said Parnell. "That's the best feeling ever."
The tour concluded at the Los Arcos
Mexican Restaurant on Markley Street where
students got a taste of Norristown's Mexican
cuisine. The attendees enjoyed a buffet of burritos, rice, refried beans, and many other dishes. "The restaurant was really great. The service was good, it was nice eating authentic
Mexican food," said Parnell. "I plan to take my
friends soon, so they can experience the good
cuisine."
The CEO offers many other volunteer opportunities in Norristown in addition to the ones
mentioned on the tour. Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance (VITA), organized by Webb, certifies
Bryn Mawr students to help Norristown community members with their tax returns and
Program Pals at Gatwals Elementary School
allows Bryn Mawr students to organize games
and activities during the children's recess.
"A Taste of Norristown," overall, was a
relaxing escape from the Bryn Mawr Bubble in
which students got the chance to explore
Norristown and some of its volunteer opportunities.
"It was a lot offun and it was really cool seeing what you can do in the community outside
of Bryn Mawr," said Wheaton.

It may be schaudenfreude, but we still can't resist
BY ANNE COLEMAN

acolemal@swarthmore.edu

Winnie is trapped inside a mass ofrock
and earth from the waist down, and has
been for quite some time, but you couldn't
lose at misery poker to a happier person.
The lead character in Samuel Beckett's
"Happy Days," currently playing at the
Company
Lantern
Theater
in
Philadelphia, Winnie is capable of optimism far more remarkable than the
extraordinary situation she is in.
Played with limitless exuberance by
Mary Elizabeth Scallen, longtime member
of The People's Light and Theatre
Company, Winnie leaves a lasting impression. One of the most challenging female
roles on today's stage, the character of
Winnie requires stamina to portray: the
play is two acts of essentially solo performance with only one or two brief
glimpses of Winnie's absentee cavedwelling husband. Portraying Winnie also
requires the ability to keep an audience
engaged in a world where nothing "happens" in the traditional sense of the word,
and to do so without the use of most ofher
body. The second act, in which Winnie has
been further swallowed by the earth until
only her head sticks out, demands a level
of facial expressiveness that far exceeds
the capacity of most performers.
"Happy Days," like so many of
Beckett's plays, is not ostensibly about
anything. The action of the play is not contained within the traditional conceptions
of dramatic or comedic action. Winnie
spends the play talking, seemingly about
nothing, and executing a series of rituals

that help her to connect to her world and
to define herself within that world. Her
internal and psychological endeavors constitute the "action" of this play.
Winnie is trying to give life
and
more specifically, individual days some
semblance of meaning. Her obsession is to
pursue an illusion of happiness and to
pursue the diversion that accompanies
the thought that things have changed for
the better.

What Scallen and director David
O'Connor achieve is all the more remarkable, given this context. "Happy Days" is
fast-paced, engaging and wildly funny.
Scallen's sing-song "No, no," whenever
she finds herself getting too close to the
sad truth is as powerful as it is simple.
Winnie's extreme and diverse efforts to
remain "happy," and the resulting emotional burden, are conveyed with ease.
There is no way to determine whether
Scallen or O'Connor contributed more to
this effortless portrayal of irrationality
and the all-too-human pursuit of life's elusive meaning. What is clear, however, is
that this production of "Happy Days" is
the result of a truly exceptional collaboration between two big names in the
Philadelphia theater scene.
It is also a testament to the Lantern
Theater Company's value in a city that is
populated by a large number of small theater companies. Lantern's first staged production was Beckett's "Waiting for Godot"
in 1994, and this return to its roots in its
15th anniversary year is a good sign.
Next up this season, the theater will be

adaptation of Moliere's "Scapin." One can

only hope that artistic director/co-founder
Charles McMahon is planning to incorporate some of the unassumingly dangerous
comedy in "Happy Days" into the more
frivolous, flippant comedy of "Scapin."
As for "Happy Days," it seems that the
team can do no wrong. Scenic designer
Meghan Jones's two-sided set (the St.
Stephen's Theater seats audiences on two
sides of the stage) is everything it needs to
be, and is just as successful from the latecomers balcony as it is from either side of
the audience.- The lighting design cap-

tures the miserable truth that Winnie is
forever exposed to the elements,, cooking
in the sun even when she tries to drift
off to sleep, and the sound of the bell to
wake and sleep is as annoying the second time as it is after a month. As a collective, the production's design reliably
conveys the overlying truth of Winnie's
life: there is no escape.
For the audience, however, escape
isn't particularly desirable. Watching
Winnie suffer is entirely fascinating and
often enjoyable.

WSRN expands beyond Swarthmore campus
BY CAMILA RYDER
cryderl@swarthmore.edu

Managed entirely by students,
WSRN 9L5 FM, Swarthmore
College's self-described "fiercely
independent" radio station, started broadcasting on Sept. 28 with
a slew of new shows ranging
from hip-hop to folk, jazz to
world music. While there are
over 60 shows, "Chester Noise"
with Daniel Symonds 'll, "We're
Still
Just Friends"
with
Bertolain Elysee 'll and "The
Chem Lab" with Professor Bob
Paleyare some of the shows that
focus on the creative, educational and exploratory side of music.
"Chester Noise" stands out
from the other shows because of
its focus on community building
and, as Symonds put it, "music
empowerment." Symonds said
that the show is just one aspect of
the program he started last year,
Chester Noise, which works
along
with Chester Police
Activities League (PAL) and
Cory Long, head of Making a
Change Association (MAC). The
program, Symonds said, "tries to
tie Chester youth with all the
sort of media resources available
on campus."
The Chester teenagers also
receive studio training, where
they learn about how to work at

8

a radio station and mix and produce music. During the show,
Symonds said that the show will
become "a vehicle for promoting
and playing music made by students in Chester Noise." The
show is a combination of talk
and music, mainly hip-hop. But
"there's definitely a push to talk
about social issues and let
Chester speak for itself for once,"
Symonds said.
An interesting aspect of the
program is the involvement and

investment that the Chester
put into the show.
"Chester students play a primary role in the decision-making process in all aspects of
Chester Noise," Symonds said.
Symonds believes that all the
opportunities
available
to
Swarthmore students should be
accessible to Chester students.
"We kind of owe it to everyone
around us to share our
resources," Symonds said.
Symonds hopes that Chester
Noise will continue after he and
others involved graduate.
"Chester Noise" will not officially start for another few
weeks, but Symonds will be
DJing with high school students
during the allotted slot on
Fridays from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
While some of the music on
"Chester Noise" is freestyle,
youth

Elysee's "We're Still Just
Friends" is composed entirely of
freestyle music. This is Elysee's
first semester with the show,
which is somewhat of a sequel to
a similar show that was here his
freshman year called "We're Just
Friends," though he has been the
hip-hop director of WSRN since
his sophomore year. "We're Just
Friends" was run by seniors in
Vertigo-go, who would "get
together every weekend and
freestyle," Elysee said.
"[FJreestyle tradition disappeared from WSRN, so I figured
that it was important to resurrect the tradition," Elysee said.
"I'm hoping that after I leave, it
will become almost an institutionalized part of the hip-hop
department."
Freestyle
is,
according to Elysee, where "you
have a beat and people just drop
rhymes 'right off the dome,' and
spontaneous rapping. It can be
telling stories, it can be kind of
word play for wordplay's sake,
but as long as you're rapping."
At the moment, Elysee and the
other students on the show are
using tracks and beats from JayZ and Lil' Wayne to 90s rap. He
hopes that they will be able to
"start making original beats."
With some of the other radio
shows, DJs try to prepare
playlists for the show. With

October 8, 2009

"We're Still Just Friends," there
isn't much preparation beyond
finding beats. "These days, there
are written freestyles, which to
me is like an oxymoron. Or [people] will have a few lines already
in their head and will rhyme off
of those, but as far as I know,
we're all just going in completely
a blank page," Elysee said.
He hopes that the show will
encourage students to try out
freestyle and be excited about
rap music. "I want to see WSRN
become more of a creative, productive space... hopefully people
will just start going in and making beats," Elysee said.
Though the radio station features mainly college students,
chemistry Professor Bob Paley

turned his love for music into
"The Chem Lab," a show that
just started its seventh year.
"It's all about music. Unlike a
lot of people in my peer group, I
still listen to a lot of new rock
music," Paley said. "It is an outlet, an opportunity for me to continue hearing new music."
Paley came to teach at
Swarthmore in 1989 and about 1415 years ago, was in a rock band
with students. "We played live a
bunch of times on campus and
then they graduated. For a number of years, I didn'thave a musical outlet," Paley said. One of his

research students was the rock
director of WSRN, and Paley suggested doing a show. Though the
name "The Chem Lab" might
make students wary, Paley
thought "it would be fun to say
you're in the chem lab on the air.
I make no attempt to try to play
[science-related] things."

The show features mainly
rock music, which ranges from
the classic bands of the 60s and
70s to indie rock. But Paley shies
away from playing things that
are on mainstreamradio. "Since
I grew up in the 70's, mainstream
music from the 60's and 70's got
played over and over again on
the radio. I don't think anyone
listens to mainstream radio anymore," Paley said.
Paley tries to play what he
thinks students are listening to,
mentioning
how he reads
"Pitchfork" every day to stay upto-date on current music.
"Alongside new music, I play the
old stuff. There's no good reason
why the music from the 60s to
the 90s can't be played alongside
current stuff," Paley said. "Good
rock music is good music."
"The Chem Lab"

Evil monster hordes held back for one more year
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY MIRIAM HAUSER

mhauserl@swarthmore.edu

If you passed the Science Center Saturday evening,
you probably saw them: the monster hordes dressed in

trash bags, clutching Fun Noodle swords, in fearsome
battle against human hunters. You probably also saw
the Pterodactyls with their frightening cardboard
wings and super-soakers and the wizards with their
staffs and red cloaks. And maybe you saw me, running
around like a fool, pretending to be a goblin and dying
every two or three minutes.
All of this was part of the Dactyl Hunt, an annual
live action role-play event begun in the early 1980s and
run by the Psi Phi Club. The basic idea of the game is
this: three pterodactyls have descended upon
Swarthmore's campus (specifically, the lawn between
Kohlberg Hall and the Science Center), and all of the
many types of monsters have banded together to protect them. It is the goal of human hunters to kill the
three pterodactyls and retrieve their hearts.
"We're doing the whole army-of-darkness thing,"
William Hopkins 'll, one of the three presidents of Psi
Phi, said at monster orientation. "Forces of evil against
forces of good."
The basic rules of the game are simple: monsters
kill hunters, forcing hunters to drop their weapons and
acquire new ones. Hunters kill goblins and ores, allowing them to receive money (poker chips), with which
they may upgrade their equipment, and forcing the
goblins and ores to re-spawn by touching the side of
Kohlberg. Money could also be used to buy hunting
licenses, which allowed hunters to attack the three
Dactyls themselves. The game ends not when the
Dactyls are all killed, but when all three of their hearts
(made of glow sticks) are returned to the Wizards without the person returning the hearts getting killed on
the way there. No head shots: if any participant hits
someone in the head, the person doing the hitting dies.
Only striking in the torso region will result in a kill.
"Your head is made out of explosives, and if they hit
you in the face, they explode," Benjamin Schwartz 'l2
said. "There are rules, and then there are rules of
physics
It's just one of those things." Schwartz,
along with Psi Phi president Orion Sauter 'll, played
the role of Wizard in the hunt. The Wizards run the
hunt, ensuring that rules are followed, settling disputes and keeping track of which side is winning: monsters or hunters.
The game is made more complicated by an abundance of invincible special monsters and players. The
deadly Cheshire Cat, played by the third Psi Phi president Rachael Mansbach 'll, willkill for you, but only if
you bribe her with a fish, acquired from the
Fishmonger. The Sphinx, played by David Edelman 'll,
will reward you, but if you answer his riddle wrong,
you're dead. And the deadly ninja strike team, the
Kobolds, comprised of the fencing team, may be killed,
but are armed with better swords than the average
...

monster.
The Dactyls are well-guarded by the Dactyl Guards,
who, as Sauter described in an e-mail to those who
signed up to be monsters, "know that the pen[cil] is
mightier than the sword, which is why they are armed
with giant pencils and,"more importantly, shields
inscribed with the opening of the Aeneid."
Players were encouraged to have fun with their
characters. "Feel free to act out your wounds,"

Schwartz said. "It'll make it so much funnier ... It's not

every day you get to die."

After hunters and monsters attended their separate
orientations where they were provided with costumes
(white trash-bags for hunters, black for monsters) and
acquired their weapons, the two sides were unleashed
on each other and quickly demonstrated that, for the
most part, neither side was particularly interested in
fair play.
Goblins and ores banded together and ganged up on
hunters. Humans stabbed monsters in the back; monsters stabbed humans in the back. Limb and head shots
were unavoidable in the chaos of the game. One goblin
wore a stolen white trash-bag hunter uniform in order
to avoid death by pretending to be human. And in general, the lawn descended into wild, happy chaos.
Within five minutes, I was killed at least three
times. Within ten minutes, I had killed at least five
hunters, lost my band of brethren at least twice and
discovered that I am a terrible, terrible swordfighter. A
group of Bryn Mawr ores and goblins, largely comprised of the Bryn Mawr fencing team, cried out the
Bryn Mawr chant. And I grew sick of Kohlberg, as I
returned again and again to it to re-spawn, invariably
forgetting to "make the video game noise of your
choice," as Schwartz had instructed us to do during

orientation.

md many people simply
ignored the fact that they

but there are also exciting alternatives.
Spread some peanut butter (at the

already sweet, so it's convenient to use.
If you have some time though (no more
than 30 seconds), try adding a bit of"
honey (at condiments bar) to plain
yogurt to sweeten it it's the ultimate w
way to enjoy yogurt, in my humble opin-

coated walnuts

(plain walnuts available next to peanut
butter), and chocolate syrup (which can
also normally-be found at the condiments bar). A little bit of these toppings
goes a long way
try not to overkill it
with the syrups. You can mix the ice
cream sundae, rip pieces of waffle and

top with the ice cream mixture.
The textures and flavors explode in
your mouth. The warm, crunchiness of
the waffle combines exquisitely with the
cold and soft texture of the ice cream in
the first bite. The chewy and not-sosweet interior of the waffle then balances out the intensity of the ice cream
mix. Yum.

PHOENIX PLAYS PHILLY

have been some of the only ones

BY MARIE ROUSSEAU
Natalia

Cote-Munoz
'll,
Maki
Clarissa Skinner 'll and I
headed towards the Swarthmore train
station on Monday, Sept. 28. We innocently chatted on the train and got off at
Market East where Natalia pointed out
the illustrious poli sci professor
Dominic Tierney. "Was he a secret
Phoenix fan?" I wondered. We then
walked towards Electric Factory, the
venue of tonight's show, skipping and
dancing around in excitement (but all
the while retaining our dignity).
Why, you ask, were we so giddy? The
answer is were going to see Phoenix, a
French band from the Parisian banlieue
of Versailles that released its first album
United in 2000. They then slowly rose to
prominence with their song "Too
Young" by featuring on the soundtracks
of both Lost in Translation and Shallow
Hal. Their big breakthrough this year
was playing on Saturday Night Live, the
first French band ever to do so.
As we approached, I spotted Deck
D'Arcy, the Phoenix bassist, walking
back to their tour bus. Seizing my best
chance at ever talking to Phoenix, I
shouted out "Bonjour!" to the Parisian.
DArcy raised his hand in acknowledg-

-

"Lisztomania", one of the hits from their
newest album Wolfgang Amadeus
Phoenix. We were able to scream "A
Lisztomania / Think less but see it grow
/ Like a riot like a riot oh! / Not easily
offended / Know how to let it go / From
the mess to the masses!" Overall, the set
list was a balanced mix of songs from
their newest and previous albums.
Personal favorites "Run, Run, Run,"
"Too Young," "Lasso" and "Armistice"
were the highlights of the show for me.
At one point, Mars decided to have
his "rock star moment" and came down
to the front part of the stage, where we
were all standing. He stood on top of bar-

riers, leaning in and singing. We were
suddenly pushed forward along a wave
of fan excitement. We were all able to
reach out and caress Mars' angel-like
face and soft hair while looking straight
into his entranced eyes. It felt like hours
but probably only lasted a split second.
Of course, I should not omit my desperate attempts to get Phoenix's atten-

ment, all the while whistling under his

breath and doing his best to go by undisturbed. Chairlift, the opening act, had
started playing once we entered. After
standing at the back for a while, the
girls and I pushed our way closer
towards the stage. Luckily for us, no one
felt like shouting at 5'4" girls that night.
Chairlift ended their opening act with

tion by shouting things like "Vive la
France!" "Je t'aime!" and "Epouse-moi!"
(Marry me!) in between songs. But to

their best-known song "Bruises," which

When Phoenix finally took the stage,
the whole crowd went wild. Lead singer

"We weren't expecting this! Thanks for
coming!" Maki and I thought: "What?
Are you serious you're a 'we-sold-outall-of-our-shows-in-New-York' band!" In
our heads, it was only possible to communicate by telepathy at this point.

Clarissa's textbook and wrote "VIVE LA
FRANCE!" on it. Epic fail. If only they
had realized one of their kinswoman
was standing in the crowd beneath
them, who knows what would have happened? Would I have become Mrs.
D'Arcy?
We shall never know.
Nonetheless, I enjoyed the concert.
Phoenix closed the set with "Funky
Squaredance," a little-known song from
their debut album United. They dramatically exited, only to reappear five minutes later, according to the traditional
rules ofThe Encore. Mars first covered
Air's "Playground Love" with soulful
acoustic guitar backing from lead guitarist Laurent Brancowitz, then burst
into the classic "If I Ever Feel Better",

and finally into the fantastic "1901,"
which ended their set. Thomas Mars
took another literal leap into the crowd:

the mic cord across the mosh pit. While
Mars paraded himself for the crowd,
Brancowitz played an electrifying guitar
solo as he stared into space with what I
can only describe as "fish eyes," much to
the amusement of the fans.
The concert finally came to a close,
with the sounds of Xavier Cugat's
"Perfidia." We retreated, heading to the
train station only after waiting pointlessly in front of the back entrance
where we caught brief glimpses of

Chairlift and darling D'Arcy. As we
skipped gleefully back, the song
"Armistice" kept popping into my head:'
"When the lights are cutting out / And I
come down in your room / Our daily
compromise / It is written in your
signed armistice." My French patriotism was revived.

it's a "pretty inexpensive place, [but] you
can get a lot of great stuff." He started shopping at Uniqlo this year after a friend rec-

ommended the store. "It's sort of along the
same line as H&M, lower prices, but still
very nice stuff."

Wardrobe staples:
"Everyone has to have a nice suit, especially the guys," Zhu said. "I obviously
don't always wear a suit, but every now
and again it's nice to take it out." Zhu also
said that 50 years ago, men were wearing
suits to college and that to him, a suitdoesn't always mean a "businessman, working
9 to 5."
An accessory that most men take for
granted is the tie. "Guys don't realize how
much fun they can have with ties," Zhu
said. "In some ways, it's like how a guy can
explore something different. There are so
many options you have with a suit and a
dress shirt, but with a tie you can take it
wherever you want."
He wishes that more guys would consider using ties to spice up an outfit, but,
he said, "whatever floats your boat."

KITCHEN TABLE REVISITED
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

Last weekend, Swarthmore
was host to not one but five powerhouses in the world of spoken
Liza Garza, Kelly Zenword
Yie Tsai, D'lo, Mayda del Valle
and Ursula Rucker. The occasion was "Kitchen Table
Revisited," a part of the Cooper
sponsored
by
Series
the
Intercultural Center and the
Swarthmore Womyn of Color
Collective, and named in honor
of the Kitchen Table: Women of
Color Press, the first publishing
company run by women of color
to promote writing by women of
color.
The Kitchen Table Press was
started in 1980 by a group of
notable activist and feminist
writers of the time, spearheaded
by author Barbara Smith, but
also co-founded by playwright
Cherrie Moraga and poet Audre
Lourde among others.
Nearly 30 years later, the
writings of a new generation of
women of color take the form
not of print, but of performance.

Jake Mrozewski Phoenix Staff

Throughout the weekend's

series of events
from a panel
on Friday, Oct. 2 to a master
class on Saturday, Oct. 3, where
the artists talked about their
creative process and took students through free form workshops, to the final concert on
Saturday night
attendees saw
that the five artists represented
the large diversity that the
movement of spoken word
encompasses.

The concert featured every-

thing from slam poetry pieces to
hip-hop with musical accompaniment by Rucker to D'lo's act
resembling standup comedy,
where he played his mother
with lines, like "I can't imagine

what could have made her a
gay" and "I tell we should have
never left Sri Lanka."
The fluidity of spoken word

From left to right, artists Ursula Rucker, Mayda del Valle, Kelly Zen-Yie Tsai, D'lo and Liza Garza were part of a panel discussion on Friday, Oct.
2 as a part of "Kitchen Table Revisited," bringing together the new generation of women of color spoken word artists.
can be attributed to the relative-

ly young movement's origins,

when Marc Smith started the

very first poetry slam in
Chicago in 1984. A few of the
artists were able to speak briefly

about their craft before the concert, and Tsai, a Chicago native,
described the first poetry slams
as "a whole bunch of different
convergences of different things
happening, like hip-hop happening, poetry slam happening,
even the kind of spoken word
coming from punk rock
all of
those things."
Spoken word gained more
mainstream attention in the late
'9os and early 2000s when the
film "Slam" and the documen-

tary "SlamNation" earned accolades in independent film festivals in 1998, and later when
Russell Simons produced the
HBO show Def Poetry in 2002.
Several of the artists have connections to the groundbreaking
show, including Tsai, Garza and
del Valle, another Chicago
native, who was an original cast
member of the show's Tony
Award-winning Broadway iteration.
Bringing spoken word to
mainstream awareness may
have led the movement to lose
some of its leftist, activists
roots. Del Valle said, "I think
that poetry pre- and post- Def
Poetry Jam on HBO has, for me,

shifted dramatically, in content,
in style, in the amount of people
who were doing it and in the
reason people were doing it. I
think after Def Poetry there
were a lot of people who were
trying to get on TV, whereas
before that was not the case. Up
until then, people had just done
it for the love, and there really
was no other outlet for it, so it's

changed."
The struggle between the
spotlight and the art was precisely the focus of one of pieces
del Valle performed, "The
Gift." Dedicated to her fellow
cast members in the Broadway
production of Def Poetry, the
piece was a stirring wake-up
call to self, urging del Valle not
to grow complacent as an

artist, with lines like, "This is
not a job or an occupation, it's
a vocation, a calling" and "I
won't get where I want to, if I
don't know where I'm from."
"Among the issues brought
up at the panel was how the
Internet has been a boon and a
nuisance to the artists' crafts
in recent years. With websites
like YouTube, spoken word
artists have been able to reach
new audiences and fans, but
also have had to deal with
swarms of anonymous hateful
and bigoted comments.
Technology even found its
way into one of the songs by
Rucker, the Philly-based artist
who worked with The Roots in

12

2oop

their 1994 album and performed at Swarthmore last
semester in the Spring Poetry
Festival. The piece, appropriately
named "Tron" had
lamenting
Rucker
"how
machines move forward while
people stand still" and asking,
"Can we find that balance
machinery
between
and
humanity?"
Rucker performed with her
longtime band that brought a
metal edge to "Tron" and
allowed Rucker to experiment

with the cadence of her words
in her many songs. Other
artists also brought the band to
the stage in their acts, allowing
them to try out musical accompaniment to their pieces for
the first time. Del Valle used
the band to sing a prologue to
the piece that she performed at
the White House for President
Obama's inauguration, which
was "for grandmothers" and
"everyone who came before
us." Garza also employed the
band for songs urging the audience to "dream on. Hold on to
your dreams, child."
Like in Tsai's equally playful and purposeful piece "Self
Centered," which imagined a
world where, rather than being
the Other, Tsai was "the center
...of everything," the "Kitchen
Table
Revisited"
series
brought these five all-star
artists and their life stories to
center stage.

The most important thing about the

once) as Pierce, a painfully unhip baby
boomer trying desperately to fit in.
Other standouts are Yvette Nicole
Brown (recognizable from a whole lot of
one- or two-episode stints on various
shows) as Shirley and Allison Brie (Trudy
Campbell on "Mad Men") as Annie, two
women who over the course of three

Lather on the leather: fashion trend on the rise
They've been in for a while now

Maya Marzouk

Fashion is all about skin: how
much to show, how much to
cover and what to cover it in.
Fall 2009 seems to have brought a
new skin trend to the table: covering skin in more skin. That's
right, Swatties! Leather is in. It
seems to be everywhere this season, from runways to street-ways
and on every type of fashion article you could imagine. Tops, bottoms and accessories are all
being subjected to the leather
trend. It's on all the runway models, and soon you too will be able
to wear leather with pride. (And
hopefully without emptying out
your wallet.)

Let's start with leggings.

Opening up roommate dialogue
The latest addition to the Tufts
campus-living handbook reads as follows: "You may
not engage in sexual activity while
your roommate is present in the
room. Any sexual activity within
your assigned room should not
ever deprive your roommate(s) of
privacy, study, or sleep time." And
with that, the university's administration took a definitive step over
the threshold that governs students' private lives.
As The Tufts Daily reported on
September 24, the policy was put in
place following careful study of the
previous year's residential trends.
The new sex policy gives uncomfortable residents, to quote Tufts'

Community

The second point, regarding the
logic in dealing with roommate
conflicts, can be addressed via an
oft-overlooked tool: the roommate
contract.

The roommate contract has
many uses. On one hand, there is
the traditional Roommate Contract
that RAs hand out to residents at
the beginning of each school year
and that residents often choose to
promptly ignore. A more general
conception of the roommate contract, however, involves frankness,
initiative and timeliness.
It is easy to dismiss the roommate contract as a superfluous
idea that only the most paranoid
and exacting roommate would suggest creating.
But

Judicial
Affairs,
Carrie AlesRich, "[something that] empowers
[them] to have a good conversation
with the roommate."
Indeed, the policy is not paired
with any indication of how it will
be enforced, which is awfully convenient, because it is difficult to
see exactly how such a policy could
be enforced at all.
Issues of enforceability notwithstanding, the necessity of Tufts'
sex policy for any college campus
is questionable. Roommate-toroommate matters of that ilk
should be left to the concerned parties themselves.
At the very most, a Resident
Assistant, or RA, can be brought
into the discussion. The Tufts
Daily reported one of the university's first-years as saying, "I think
they are imposing something that
should be decided between room-

mates."
Here at Swarthmore, sex is
unmistakably a part of college life,
and roommate conflicts certainly
stem from it, as they do on other
college campuses. The weekend
that the Tufts sex policy was publicized, in fact, several residents of
David Kemp's second floor were
forced to cobble together a
makeshift bed using the lounge's
couches victimized by the unfortunate phenomenon known as
"being sexiled."
To be sure, being sexiled is generally accepted as part of roommate life. At the same time, no one
denies the hindrance to sleep and
study
and general inconvenience
that being sexiled causes.
Nevertheless, these facts do not
warrant administration intervention under any circumstances,
mostly because it would be both
impractical and illogical for an
official guideline to address the
problem. Difficulties in enforceability have already been acknowl-

issues
between roommates, including, of
course, the -always interesting
topic of sex. Far too often, roommates experience a smooth initial
living arrangement, only to watch
the agreeability disintegrate over a
single bump in the road. This is
especially true for first-years, of
whom virtually
all entered
Orientation Week living with complete strangers, and especially true
at this time, now that the month
(read: grace period) of September
is over and heretofore-nonexistent
roommate conflicts may begin to
appear.
Thus, honest dialogue between
roommates is always necessary
and always more effective than any
administrative policy could be.
Mutual understanding can only be

effected if, as mentioned above,

roommates are frank with each

other about limitations, take the
initiative to talk through a potentially awkward subject and are
able to set parameters for their living arrangements in a timely manner.
Complaining about roommates
having sex in the room while one
is asleep after the fact and without
having expressly disallowed it
beforehand does not qualify as
timely action.
This kind of advice is admitedly
obvious. But it is also often left
unheeded.
Such open dialogue is important
now more than ever, especially
given the nature of the roommate
as an institution. Residents are
assigned roommates for practical
reasons (space considerations);
that much has not changed since
schools across the country started
providing room and board. What
has changed, however, are countless societal norms.
With facts like premarital sex,
homosexuality and co-ed living
now socially recognized and publicly discussed, the roommate
dynamic has become much more
than a simple case of "meet Smith
and live with him while you get
your education." Continuous and
open communication about various contingencies is imperative to
reduce conflict and to preclude
administrations from feeling that
they have to intervene in our private lives.
More variables means more
volatility. And only roommates can
grasp the dynamics defining their
unique circumstances. It is only
logical that we hold ourselves
responsible for preempting conflict. As any game theorist will say,
too much uncertainty invariably
engenders relative disaster.

Powerful activism
needs action logic
To the Editor:
As a leader in Casino-Free Philadelphia, I
appreciated the acknowledgment of our movement and our relative success. I agree with the
sentiment that mass actions with no coherent
well
a mixed
message are bound to have
public message, at best. But mixed messaging is
not the real issue.
The diluted power of. action from the G2O is
because activists operated without any action
logic.

It does not clearly follow that if you oppose,
say, the Afghanistan war or the government
responses to climate change that you should

take over the streets of Pittsburgh. The actions
created a space for self-expression. But the
actions did not explain their issue. Contrast
Casino-Free Philadelphia's recent blockade of
the proposed SugarHouse site. We blocked
trucks from entering, in an effort to slow down
and halt SugarHouse's development. Fourteen
were arrested, including Lang Visiting
Professor George Lakey.
That action has logic. Oppose SugarHouse
casino? Stop it from being built.
Actions that require much more explanation
are less effective. And they result in exactly the
kind of mixed issue focus that confuses.
Protesters interested in effective change would
do well to stop using those tactics.
Rallies are really just big gatherings where
people say we oppose or support this policy. And
if others show up, they add other opinions,
watering down the message. That's why in its
history Casino-Free Philadelphia has virtually
abandoned the tactic of a rally.
Instead, I believe the best actions reflect our
message. You should know what we stand for
without reading a sign or talking to a media
spokesperson. That's action logic. And that's
powerful activism.

raise awareness of climate change and push for an
international treaty. Three hundred fifty
parts per million, or ppm, is the number
that scientists say is the "safe upper limit
for CO2 in our atmosphere."
British economist Nicolas Stern,
whom 350 calls "the most important climate economist in the world" lays it out
for us. He warns, "If we don't act, the
overall costs and risks of climate change
20 percent
will be equivalent to losing
of GDP or more" and that could cause
pain "on a scale similar to [that] associated with the great wars and the economic
depression of the first halfof the 20th century." I've never been a gdy to hold hands
and sing, but it might be Kumbaya time.
Given that my hands get clammy at
the thought of digging deep into my soul
as I stand on AstroTurf listening to
Disney songs, I decided to look to economics literaturefor an answer instead of

singing.

Let's carefully consider 350's goals and
how to achieve them. 350's concerns
about the consequences of rising temperatures include increased deadliness of
vector-borne diseases like malaria, ocean
acidification and rising sea levels. 350
says we can save the world by reducing
atmospheric carbon density to 350 ppm.
350's solution is simple. It's also
wrong.

Climate change affects people as well
as the environment, but some populations may actually be better off in warmer
temperatures. Obviously, we should not
subsidize warming. But we should carefully consider the costs and benefits of
global warming and our approaches to

fight it, because adverse effects often hide
behind good intentions. To sensibly
address climate change, we should try to
internalize the social cost of carbon via
some Pigouvian tax while minimizing the
tax's effect on global trade in order to protect vulnerable populations.
A Pigouvian tax is a tax levied on market activity that creates negative externalities. In this case, developed nations

impose uncompensated costs onto poorer,
undeveloped nations. So without this tax,

energy is oversupplied and there is market failure. To impose an appropriate
Pigouvian tax, we must determine the
social cost of carbon, or SCC, so firms and
individuals pay the actual costs associated with their market activities. (Note: I
am not suggesting a cap-and-trade regime
because our limited experience with such
a system shows it suffers from even more
extreme volatility than the stock market
and oil futures.)
Unfortunately, figuring out SCC is
really hard. The uncertainty about climate change has led scientists to offer a
wide range of taxes to be levied on activities that release carbon into the atmos-

phere (i.e. everything).
Although traditional cost-benefit
analysis, or CBA, is discussed in the rest
of the article, it's important to acknowledge the uncertainty that
with
CBA. A forthcoming paper by Harvard
economist Martin Weitzman emphasizes
the inadequacy of CBA. Weitzman argues
that CBA arbitrarily ignores the likelihood of high-impact, extreme catastrophes based on the logic that they are

almost statistically impossible. Weitzman
suggests we incorporate such events into
analysis because, according to his model,
risk-averse agents would be willing to pay
a "very high price to eliminate or reduce

deep uncertainty."
Social injustice is at the center of the
global policy response to climate change.
Most of the world, particularly those who

don't much like America, argues for an
international climate change abatement
treaty because the effects of climate
change, caused mostly by affluent
Western countries, impacts mostly poor
countries.
(This is precisely why the United
States should not sign a climate change
treaty. By signing the treaty, the US

would put domestic energy policy in the
hands of foreign nations that don't have
our best interests at heart. We should
pass climate legislation through traditional means that allows for input by the
American public.)
But proponents of a climate change
policy rightly point out the plight of poor
people in this context. According to World
Bank Senior Insurance Specialist Eugene
Gurenko, weather-related disasters associated with climate variability can affect
as much as a quarter of GDP in developing nations, which rely more on vulnerable
natural
resource-based
enterprises.
Surprisingly,
developing
nations, particularly those in
Africa, actually
stand to lose from
climate change
abatement policy.

Yes, lose. This is
because we can
only currently reduce emissions by
reducing growth, which is bad for developing nations. Let me explain:
According to Nathan Lewis of the
California Institute of Technology, we do
not have technology cheap enough to
maintain current energy consumption
and reduce emissions. And currently, the
only way to reduce emissions is to reduce
energy consumption, which means cutting economic growth.
If OECD countries were to make reductions consistent with demands of the
Kyoto Protocol, Babiker et al. (1997) show
that the costs to "non-OECD countries
would be high, because exports to the
OECD would fall substantially, not only
for oil but for other commodities." This is
consistent with most of Congress' sentiments, especially that of Senate
Democrats who say they will not vote for
a bill that doesn't impose what they like
to call "border measures" (also known as:
'—

"tariffs").

Tol and Dowlatabadi developed a
model that relates OECD emissions
reduction to economic development and
show how development can reduce deaths
from vector-borne disease. They argue
that once pjer capita income in developing

that the relationship between percapita income and

malaria incidence
is
somewhat
weak, although it
has been replicated using different
datasets.)

If our goal in
mitigating climate
change is primarily to help poor people,
then we should reconsider our priorities.
:

While we don't have carbon-neutral
means of producing lots of energy, poorer
nations, especially those in Africa, are
better off when we embrace economic
growth and limit our ambitions for big
reductions in carbon emissions. (Of
course, island nations threatened by rising sea levels require a different policy
response.)

This doesn't mean we do nothing, however.
First, we must revise our ambitions
for reducing carbon density in the atmosphere. Dr. Lewis argues, "to stabilize the
concentrations of CO2 at 350 ppm by 2050
would necessitate reducing carbon emissions on our planet to zero by that date."
If even the International Energy
Agency questions whether a 450 policy
scenario is "technically achievable," why
do we push for an even lower number
(350) that is less feasible?
Second, we should set our Pigouvian
tax equal to SCC. According to climate
economist Richard Tol's analysis, the
SCC is at most $5O per ton CO2 and is likely to be much lower. We should couple
this tax with the exploiting of inexpensive
technology to combat climate change,
such as the cloud whitening techniques
proposed by University of Texas engineer
and economist J. Eric Bickel and
American Enterprise Institute researcher
Lee Lane.
Third, if reducing ocean acidification
is important, we must campaign for it
directly. Pearce and Moran (1994) report
that people's willingness to pay to preserve nature remains below one percent
of income. Economists and scientists
must put a higher price on biodiversity to
make it a more important part of any
CBA.
Finally, we must spend more money on
researching the probability of climate
catastrophes, as Weitzman suggests, and
develop technologies for carbon-neutral
"

energy production.

Should research substantiate an unac-

ceptable probability of high-impact
events, current CBA will become mostly
invalid. Reducing uncertainty, then,
should be a top priority.
Decreasing energy consumption to
zero to reach 350 ppm is not an option. In
fighting global warming, we must make
humanity better off in the future as well

as the present.

Former Marine finds a new Basketball trick shots
crew team to row along with become online fodder

BY QUINN ROBERTS
DAILY COLLEGIAN, SEPT. 29, 2009
Imagine sitting as the turret gunner on
top of a seven-ton vehicle through the Anbar
province of Iraq.
For Emily Thompson this wasn't a dream,

it was real life.
Thompson, a senior majoring in kinesiology at Penn State University, served in the
United States Marine Corps in Iraq from
October 2006 to May 2007 as a combat correspondent and is now a member of the Penn
State crew team.
The Harrisburg native specifically
remembers a mission where she and other
members of her unit traveled down the
Tigris-Euphrates River to deliver medical

supplies to displaced people.
"I remember thinking that if these people
can survive this, I am pretty lucky that I
have all of these opportunities and am
exposed to things that make my life so much
easier," Thompson said. "Just being exposed
to that and people who on a daily basis are
living with the threat of death, it changes
your mind completely."
But before she was a soldier, Thompson

coach Fritz Spence said. "It is a huge transition from high school to college track and
field. It really is a full time commitment."
Once Thompson quit the team, she felt an
extreme void of athleticism, something she
couldn't take as a serious work out addict.
Yet the more Thompson looked into crew,
the more interested she became.
A novice in her first two semesters during the spring and fall of 2008, she is now a
member of the varsity women's lightweight
crew team. Thompson is only in her third

spring of 2009 studying abroad in Egypt. She

"The first semester I rowed was the most
painful experience of my life," Thompson
said. "You put your body places and feel muscles you didn't know you had.

have your hands ripped up and your back

tion Toney said he never expected.
"Once we came out with the first
video we didn't expect anything to
happen, and we definitely didn't
expect everything that has happened to the degree that it has,"
Toney said.
Dude Perfect started as six college roommates betting each other
sandwiches on scored baskets in
their backyard. The group soon
decided to capture their unconventional shots on camera. But it didn't
stop there.
After brainstorming and spending one afternoon at Toney's ranch,
Dude Perfect produced a ranch edition of basketball trick shots. With
two of the members spending the
summer as counselors at the
Christian-based camp Sky Ranch, a
summer camp edition was born.
Posted on Youtube, the videos skyrocketed to success.
Their videos have made a
splash, raised the roof, and gone
the distance literally.
The tricks include goals scored
while wakeboarding on Styrofoam
behind a four-wheeler, baskets
made up and over rooftops, and
swishing the world's longest basketball shot from the third deck of
Kyle Field.
Debate has been raging over the
authenticity of the videos, but Dude
Perfect's philosophy has been "just

"We love it when people say it's
fake because it makes the shots
seem even more ridiculously
impossible; and we get more publicity and hits and YouTube so we
love the mystery of knowing
whether it's real or fake," Jones
said.
The guys average 15 tries for
each made basket, with some of the
shots, such as the Cloud Shot on the
Ranch edition and the Golf Cart
Shot on the Summer Camp edition,
being made on the first try.
The secret is all in the technique, said Toney, the shooter

behind the Kyle Field shot.
"It's actually more of football
than basketball. I played quarterback in high school so I think that's
what helps more than any basketball skills I might have. Especially
the long throws, that is pretty
much all football throws, just with
a basketball," Toney said.
The Dude Perfect videos have so

group has found a way to turn this
unexpected attention into a golden
opportunity.
"After the summer camp edition, we were like 'listen what can
we do' because we are making
money off of the hits we are getting.
We have to do something with it, so

Dude Perfect's ministry plans do
not stop there. The group wants to
have a more hands-on involvement
with kids and sharing their faith
with them.
"We want to take this fame, or
whatever you want to call it, and
use itfor something other than ourselves. If you ask any of us we will
tell you it's not about us," Toney
said. "It's about using this opportunity to show others that it doesn't
always have to be about you. There
are plenty of ways to use what God
has given you to do something
other than glorify yourself."
The team has even talked about
starting their own organization.
"What we are really about is

her decision, and he's been to every practice since.
Yoshimura's generosity came at a
price however, as he truly sealed the deal
on his collegiate playing days (including
if he were to play in graduate school), forfeiting years of competitive eligibility in
favor of working with the women's team.
As Duke basketball coach Mike
Krzyzewski once said, "I don't believe in
rules. I believe in standards. Rules don't
promote teamwork; standards do."
Yoshimura is this team's constant standard.
"First of all, love your teammates,"
Krzyzewski said. "Love what you do. Be
excited to improve. Be excited for that
opportunity to play every day. If I could
just convey that to them that it's a really good thing for you to be able to do what
you love for the people you love that's
when you can get extraordinary things to
happen." That's the standard, and true to
what coach K. believes, he lives it.
"Seeing how talented he is and knowing he'll never get to play... I think the
players feel for that," Chwastyk said.
Santana echoes that sentiment. "If
you see someone do something that
amazing with so much heart and dedication, it makes you feel like you have to
match it or beat it to not let them down,"
she said.
Yoshimura brings it every day, showing off his spindly athleticism with gravity-defying dives and endless hustle.
He spent the summer working on his
jumping ability and has unselfishly
adjusted his game to play to the women's
net height, which is approximately seven
inches lower than the men's net height,
and spends practices simulating the competition of Swarthmore's upcoming opponent rather than working on his own
skills.
"With the number of hours I devote to
the team, I should be majoring in girls'
volleyball," joked Yoshimura. "I consider

now."
He's naturally quiet, which serves
him as an observer who leads by example. To the untrained eye, during a twohour practice, it would appear that he
merely mumbles, but his soft-spoken attitude amplifies the times when he does
speak.

"When he has something to say, it has
so much meaning and substance behind
it," Chwastyk said. "The players understand he can do exactly what he's asking
of them."
Whatever he's saying and however
he's saying it, something's working.
"When he's on your team [in practice],
you want to play harder just because he's
there," Kat Montemurro 'l3 said.
"You don't want to let him down
because he goes all out for everything,"
added co-captain Sarah Lambert 'IL
With the ability of a player, the
approach of a manager and the demeanor
of a coach, Yoshimura perfectly shifts
between his roles, constantly wary of
when he is needed without overstepping
his bounds. But what really makes him
so extraordinary is that all of his efforts
are driven towards the success of his

teammates.

Unlike myself and athletes in my position, who workout and practice both to
help our'teams and to improve ourselves,
Yoshimura will only attain gratification
through the success of other people.

Langley tricks Bullets in dramatic soccer victory
BY VICTOR BRADY

vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
As the fog descended around the Garnet

and the Bullets, Morgan Langley 11 buried a
bicycle kick goal in the 89th minute to propel
the No. 13 Swarthmore men's soccer team
over visiting Gettysburg (4-4-2, 1-3 CC)
Saturday at Clothier Field by a score of 4-3.
The dramatic finish capped a frenzied
evening that saw the Garnet jump out to a 30 lead in the first 20 minutes of play and the
Bullets score three goals of their own to
draw even.
With just over a minute to play, Langley
scored his third goal of the game
and 10th
of the season to lift Swarthmore over their
Centennial Conference rivals.
Off a corner kick from Roberto Contreras
IV 'l2, Dylan Langley 10 headed the ball
back across the box to where his brother
waited. "I just wanted to get a foot on the
ball any way possible, and it floated right in
front of me," Morgan Langley said.
The Centennial Conference awarded the
younger Langley for his effort by naming
him the Centennial Conference Offensive
Player of the Week. In addition to Langley's
three goals against the Bullets, he had an
assist to his credit in the Garnet's 6-0 romp
of Washington on Sept. 30.
With 10 goals on the season (in just 10
games), Langley is the first Swarthmore
player to score 10 or more times in a season
since 1995. He leads the Conference in points
(23), and his 10 goals are also a conferencehigh, tied with Johns Hopkins' Scott

Bukowski.

But the Garnet have shown all year that

individual stats are secondary to the overall
success of the team, and even after his individual success, Langley was not satisfied
with the way that he and his team played on
Saturday. "If we get an early lead, we cannot
let off the throttle, We became lazy
with the lead, but the other teams in the conference are too good to allow us to do that,"
he said.
In defeating the Bullets, the Garnet
improved to 9-1 overall and 3-1 in the
Centennial Conference, but this win also
served as a wake-up call. Swarthmore
allowed more goals in 90 minutes of play
(three) than they had allowed in all of their
previous games combined (two).
Head coach Eric Wagner agreed that "we
didn't play our best game defensively
we
were pretty unorganized, and we lost our
shape a couple of times." Wagner attributed

the flurry of Gettysburg goals to a loss of
focus by players and coaches alike.
"When you take your foot off the accelerator against a good team like [Gettysburg],
not only can they get one back, but they can
ride the momentum for the whole match,
and that's what they did. They got us on
their heels, and it was tough for us to regain
the momentum," Wagner said.
goalkeeper
Swarthmore
David
D'Annunzio 'l2 only made one save in the
securing the victory, but it was one of his
biggest yet. With the score tied 3-3 late in the
match, D'Annunzio made a lunging save to
his right on a blast from the top of the box,
preventing a Bullets lead and recharging the
Garnet momentum.
"We came in with the attitude that we
needed this win, but once we went up [by]
three goals, we became too relaxed. We
thought the job was done. [When] we let in
that first goal, it gave Gettysburg the confidence that they needed to get back in the
game. It was just a huge momentum swing,"
D'Annunzio said.

But the Garnet, riding ever-present
waves of support from the fans at Clothier
Field, were able to rebound from the

momentum shift in time to preserve their
top spot in the Centennial Conference standings. Head-to-head victories against Johns
Hopkins and Gettysburg leave Swarthmore
on top of a jumble of teams.
Fabian Castro 'l2, who took three shots
against Gettysburg, knows that the Garnet
must stay focused as they move through conference play. "We can't get complacent with
our position and ranking. We can't have
mental lapses to allow teams to get back in
games." Castro added that the squad is pre-

pared to act in order to prevent this from
happening again.
The three goals were the most given up
by the Garnet since falling to Johns Hopkins
4-0 in 2007, but Wagner was pleased with his
team's resilience. Wagner recalled that he
applauded their display of "heart" and "char-

acter" after Gettysburg evened the score.
"The way we regained our composure and
regained our shape and regained our

momentum was hot only dramatic, but it
was also really telling of what this team is
made of— the heart and soul that this team
shows," he said.
Last night at Richard Stockton, the
Garnet picked up their 10th win of the season, coming from behind to defeat the
Ospreys by a score of 2-L
The Garnet trailed 1-0 at the half before
the Langley brothers connected yet again,
