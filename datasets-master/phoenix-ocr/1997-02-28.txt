Dolores Huerta, Labor
Activist, to Give Lecture
By

Mandara Meyers

Ending the Feminist Majority's "Women's
Victories" CooperLecture Series, labor activist
Dolores Huerta will be speaking on campus on
Tuesday night at 7:30 p.m. in the Lang Performing Arts Center.
Huerta was born in 1930 in a small town in
New Mexico. Her father was a miner, field
worker and union activist himself, but Huerta
was raised by her mother from age five on. Her
mother, Alicia Chavez, worked as a waitress,
cannery worker, cook, and eventually ran a 70
room hotel which frequently housed the families
of farm workers for free.
Chavez's efforts went mainly to her children;
thanks to her mother, Huerta attended the University of the Pacific. After college, she taught
grammarschool until the poverty ofthe children

she was teaching began to overwhelm her.
She explained, "I couldn't stand seeing kids
come to class hungry and needing shoes. I
thought I could do more by organizing farm
workers than by trying to teach their hungry
children."
Huerta began working in grassroots organizations and eventually met Cesar Chavez
through her efforts on behalfoffarmworkers.
Chavez once commented, "Dolores is totally
fearless, both mentally and physically." In
1962, the two co-founded the National Farm
Workers Association (NFWA). In 1966, the
group merged with a Filipino organization,
the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, and became the United Farm Workers
Organizing Committee. In 1972, the group
received a charter from the AFL-CIO.
Huerta directed a grape boycott in 1970

which marked the first collective bargaining
agreements for farmworkers in California.
Huerta wrote, negotiated and administered
these agreements.
During her activist career, she has lobbied
in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., organized field strikes, directed United Farm

Workers boycotts and led farm workers campaigns for political candidates. Her work as a
legislative advocate has paved the way for
the passage of major legislation: removal of
citizenship requirements forpublic assistance;
disability and unemployment insurance for
farmworkers; and the enactment of Aid for
Dependent Children.
Huerta has been one of the most visible
symbols of the UFW for over thirty years

Symptoms of spring were apparent this week the crocuses began to bloom,
the weather was balmy, and students enjoyed outdoor activities. The swing,
neglected for most of the winter, was used by students and local children alike.

Prior to Sunday's meeting, SC had
spent several weeks discussing

A total of twenty candidates were
chosen for interviews, which took
place during theModern Language
Convention. In the final round of
the selection process, the five
short-listed candidates were interviewed by members of the English department, two faculty
members from other departments,
theProvost, thePresident (depending on availability), and students
from the Student Liaison
Commitee of the English department and the Swarthmore Asian
Organization (SAO). "Afterall the

brainstormed a numberofideas
for effectively increasing communication between the student
body and Council members to
determine which issues are of
particular importance to students. Some of the ideas to this
end included placing a suggestion box in Sharpies, a poster in
Parrish for students to write suggestions and comments about
Student Council activities, and
placing weekly press releases
in campus publications, such as
The Phoenix, The Daily Gazette, and The Weekly News.
Council also talked about
other issues that they felt needed
to be addressed immediately.
This discussion included a consideration of morning shuttle
service from ML and PPR in
the winter months, and what
might be done about the drainage and mud problems on Mertz

lawn and the fieldsaround PPR.
They also discussed the Student Council Van Policy, specifically, how vans can be reserved and how priorty for van
use is decided. Finally, they addressed exam and paper return
policies resulting in a suggestion to establish a policy to insure that professors make all
papers and exams from the previous semester available to
students.Each of the members
present at the meeting took one
of these issues for further examination.
At the end of the meeting,
Council members created oflist
of other issues to be discussed

list includes the status of the

New cafe to meet caffeine needs...

The Bean Bag Replaces the Cow
By Jennifer Klein
The Daily Gazette

On March 24, The Bean Bag, which replaces the
Jumping Cow Ice Cream and Coffee House, will open its
doors to customers.
The new owners ofThe Bean Bag, Joe King and Craig
Hobdell ofClassic Coffees, are currently remodeling the
space down by the SEPTA station in order to provide an
improved atmosphere for their patrons. The two are
planning on expanding The Bean Bag's menu of coffee
and desserts to include meat sandwiches and a vegetarian
menu.
Under the new ownership more entertainment activities, such as poetry readings and evening cookouts, will
be occurring weekly in an attempt to attract students. The
artwork of local artists also will be on display.
The Bean Bag will be the second business venture of
the Classic Coffees partnership. King and Hobdell already operate an espresso bar at the Chester-Crozer
Healthplex in Springfield.

gram.
The list also includes examining workbox and laundry/
bathroom facilities, the campus
parking situation, and working
with Public Safety towards solutions to campus securityproblems.
They also will be discussing
SAC procedures and their decision-making processes, alternatives to Pub Nite, the availability of space for student groups,
the creation of a staff lounge,
and the possibility of having a
Student Council-sponsored
speaker each semester, as well
as various food issues, such as
Tarble hours. None of these issues were formally taken up or
discussed by Council at
Wednesday's meeting.
The next Council meeting
will be held Sunday, March 2 at
7:15 in Kohlberg 330. All students are welcome and encouraged to attend the meeting.

The history of the station coffeehouse extends back to
the mid 1980s when Beth Gross, Dean Bob Gross' wife,
opened up Sidetracks with a group of women
entrenpeneurs. They subleased the space from W.S.
Cumby & Son who leased and renovated the entire
property from SEPTA.
Sidetracks was primarily staffed with Swarthmore students. The student employees were great with the only
downside being, as Gross explained, that "some of the
students would give me heartache when their hearts were
broken or papers were due."
Sidetracks eventually closed and Sandi Dee moved in.
The owner was mainly involved incatering and the coffee
house was a side project. Sandi Dee was only around a
short time before the owner sold the business to Terry
Rumsey and Robin Lasersohn 'B9 who opened the Jumping Cow. The Jumping Cow officially closed on January
20, 1997.
Like many past owners of the establishment, TheBean
Bag is planning on hiring Swarthmore students for their
staff.

Budget Prompts Salary Debate
By

Janice Gallagher

This Saturday, the Board of Managers will discuss the proposed budget for next year. This
budget, ifadopted, will set faculty salaries at 102.5 percent of their national comparison group,
while maintaining staff salaries equal to the average of their comparison group.Some students
and staff members feel that this disparity is one of the most controversial aspects of the
proposed budget.
The Daily Gazette of February 27 reported that President Al Bloom said in January that
faculty should earn more than the market value because "the center of this organization is its
educational effect on the students, and the people most closely involved with that are the
faculty." However, some members of the staff have disagreed, saying the difference in target
salaries sends non-faculty employees the wrong message about their importance to Swarthmore.
This message, some say, is confirmed by other aspects ofhow Swarfhmore treats its different
workers. An unofficial survey conducted among the staff last semester indicates that there is
concern about the way jobevaluations are done and pay raises are determined.There were also
concerns voiced about the grievance procedure, which some said was not always made clear
or followed.
Now on the table are proposals submitted to Provost Jennie Keith by a group of staff and
faculty. Currently, pay raises are determined by formal evaluations, and there is no published
salary schedule which enables employees to know how their salary reflectswork experience,
acquired skills and education.
As the College Planning Committee plans for Swarthmore' s future, it will hear presentations
about the student, faculty and staff experiences. Part of the presentation about the student
experience includes the relationship of students with other constituencies on campus.
This is the first in a series

of articles on faculty and staff issues.

and the Reverend Jesse Jackson.
Huerta's current focus is on the
strawberry campaign in California.
Although there has been no official

labor activists are pushing for an extension ofbasic rights for workers in
the strawberry fields.
Throughout her extraordinary career as an activist, Huerta has also

Along with Huerta, several organizers from the UFW will be on campus on Tuesday. The lecture, which

will be a call for action for members
of both the College and the larger
Swarthmore community, will be followed by an open organizing meeting/reception in Kohlberg Coffee
Lounge.
Huerta and the members of the
UFW are hoping to establish a committee here at Swarthmore to work
with them on the strawberry campaign.
Kristin Sostowski '97, who worked
with Huerta in California last summer, and is also one of the main
organizers of the lecture series said,

from being able to finish my dissertationand begin

Saragosa was asked to reconsider applying for
the tenure-track position when the appointment
committee did not reach a concensus on hiring an
applicant from the original pool of five final candidates. Karman Mak 'OO, administrative chair of
SAO, explained that "none of [the other candidates] were exactly what we wanted so the English
Department expanded the search to someone else
on the finalist list and Frank."
According to Mak, students who are taking
Saragosa's classes and were involved with the
evaluation process "praised his teaching" and
wondered why he was not considered.
Saragosa presently teaches two classes, "Introduction to Asian-AmericanLiterature" and "AsianAmerican Misceg-Nation," which was one of the
reasons Saragosa was hesitant to apply. As he said,
"Since I had not yet met my students, I didn't want
a job search to complicate my classes in any way."
Saragosa reactivated his application and was
invited to experience the rigors of the twelve-hour
day of evaluation at Swarthmore; like the other six
final candidates, he attended six interviews with a
total of twelve faculty members and administrators, and had lunch withthe Student Liaison Com-

mittee. He also made a presentation about his
doctorate work on Miss Saigon and, as Saragosa
explained, "how whatI see as larger cultural sexual
and violent fantasies about Asia were operative in
the staging of the musical." He also met with
members of SAO for dinner in Sharpies.
At the end of the entire process, Saragosa was
appointed to be an instructorfor the next two years.
He will be teaching one course each semester, and
advising students informally as well as working on
his dissertation outside of classes.
Mak explained that the students involved in the
process felt more confident about choosing
Saragosa because they already knew him and liked
him as a teacher and a person. "He had more going
for him coming into the selection process," said
Mak.
Throughout the interview process with the various candidates, interviewersraised questions about
how an Asian American studies professor will
function within the academic departments and in
campus life. When asked how he felt about being
a "one-man Asian American Studies department,"
Saragosa replied, "We shouldn't undersell the resources forAsian Americans and for Asian American studies at Swarthmore. I am surprised at how
much the library has, and its holdings are better in
Asian American studies than, for example, at the
University of Pennsylvania. Professor Woon-Ping

Chin...dida very good job in developing resources.
Moreover, I am very impressed with what SAO
and PRO [Pacific Rim Organization] do in terms of
cultural, political, and educationalactivities. Given
that, I don't have to start from scratch, or work in
a resistant environment."
Possible future courses include "Literatures of
the Asian Diaspora," a look at Asian American,
Asian Canadian, and Asian English literature and
an examination of "the political contexts ofAsian
migration, exile, and return," said Saragosa. Another possibility is "Oriental Visions and Asian
Eyes: Performance, Race, and Representation,"
which will deal with the way Asians are depicted
in film and theater, and examine the response of
Asian artists to such traditionalforms of representation.
Saragosa is also considering starting a course
called "Asian American Legal Fiction," which,
according to Saragosa, "would deal withboth legal
and literary traditions."
Professor Williamson congratulated Saragosa
on behalfof the English faculty: "The department
is pleased to be welcoming Saragosa to its ranks
next year." Said Saragosa, "I will be available to
whatever degreeI can to help students interested in
Asian American studies, in and out of the English
department, and to be a resource for bringing
Asian American artists and academics to campus."

Letters to the Editor
Swarthmore, It's Time For the Wake-Up Ca11...

Violence cannot be overlooked in consumerism
Last week, outside of Parrish, there was a scream. It sounded like a female
voice yelling for help. But instead, the scream was a car alarm that had
accidentally been set off. Instead of the characteristic beeping and whistles,
the alarm was that of a female yelling for help. This is disturbing to us.
The need for car alarm manufacturers to continually reinvent and improve
the car alarm over the past few years has led to some interesting changes in
the device. The first models emitted an obnoxiously loud noise reminiscent
of a town emergency horn. Later models used deep and loud male authoritative voices instructing intruders to back away from the car. As a whole, the
police and most people have become quite skilled at tuning out the distraction
of the car alarm. At first we used to jump and look, but now we shut the
window or simply resume whatever we are doing. We havebecome apathetic.
But a female voice yelling in distress still gets our attention, which is why
the new alarm sports a feminine voice. However, apathy towards a voice
crying for help is inevitable with a car alarm exploiting the same sound. We
cannot forget the boy who cried wolf one too many times in jest, only to find
that no one would listen to him when a real wolf finally appeared.
With the female voice as a car alarm, women have no control over the
blatant misuse of their voice. There are serious dangers if people become
habituated to the sound of a woman's voice in trouble. We should all
remember the case several years ago ofKitty Genovese who yelled for help
as a man attacked her. As the people in her neighborhood listened and ignored
her cries, she was murdered. Violence against women is real, and it cannot be
ignored or trivialized in the form of a car alarm.
A scream, whether male or female, is not something to be trivialized.
Making a car alarm, something that often goes off accidentally, sound like a
human voice in danger makes real emergencies seem much less important.
Protecting a car may be important, but respecting human life is essential.

A letter from the editors
The controversy sparked by last week's news article, "E-mail Slams
Student Council Candidate," has raised some important issues. As editors of
The Phoenix, we have learned from this experience, and hope to work with
others to make the Phoenix more representative of the entire student body.
One important issue that has arisen is the importance ofrepresenting the
different views of students on campus. It has typically been Phoenix policy
that when a writer wishes to include the view of a particular organization in
an article, he or she would interview the president or coordinator of that
organization. The Phoenix does not deliberately overlook the diverse views
of students within a campus organization in only obtaining a statement from
an organization's president. But, we do recognize that it is crucial for writers
and editors to get a variety of representative opinions in order to write
accurately; this is one specific change we shall be implementing as a staff.
This need for accuracy and fairness ofrepresentation brings up the need for
having writers on the staff from many different groups on campus. At the
beginning of this semester, we sent an e-mail to all campus groups encouraging them to suggest topics for articles and to contribute as writers. But we
realize now that a greater effort is needed in order to make our staff more
representative of Swarthmore. We would like to extend an invitation to all
students to contribute to the Phoenix, either as regular writers or in the form
ofletters to the editor. We also encourage topics for articles and a willingness
to work with our staff further to create an open dialogue and increase
awareness about diversity and sensitivity.
We would like to make it clear that the staff of the Phoenix, and therefore
aspects of the policy, change every semester. To a certain degree, it is
important that the Phoenix policy remains consistent; we typically do rely on
past precedent in our decision-making. But each semester, the editors make
changes in accordance with what they see to be the changing campus
atmosphere. This means that editors should not be held responsible for
decisions made in previous semesters. We view this change as something
positive, feeling that this suggests a particularly attentive relationship between the Phoenix staff and the student body at large.
In addition to being responsive to changing issues on campus, a significant
portion of the Phoenix policy must necessarily be contigent on legal issues.
As thecampus newspaper, we must abide by certain guidelines establishedby
the College Constitution and the Dean's Office. For example, several students
have expressed concern about our policy regarding naming specific individuals in articles. This particular policy is largely dictated by such legal issues.
One of the difficulties in producing a college newspaper is finding a balance
between providing interesting, thought-provoking, information to our community and stepping beyond the bounds of journalistic integrity. This balance
is one we struggle for each and every semester, and this, perhaps, is where we
need the most help from the student body. We realize that there were several
significant problems with the article published last week. But instead of only
receiving sporadic feedback, we would like to know how you think we're
doing on a regular basis. More importantly, we want to know how you think
we can improve on our responsibility to the Swarthmore community and
make ourselves a more effective representative of the diversity of opinions on
this campus. The best way, as we see it, is to get as many of you as possible
to use the Phoenix as the forum that it is for student, faculty and staff voices.

Corrections
In the February 21 issue of The Phoenix, a news article entitled "E-mail
Slams Student Council Candidate" mistakenly named MariaLuisa Guardiola,
not Marialuz Castro '9B, as the HOLA president, and Connie Cheung '9B, not
Gil Baretto '97 and Cecilia Tsu '9B, as the coordinator of SAO.

To the Editor:
In an atmosphere that is supposed
to foster the freedom of choice as
well as personal opinion, the "e-mail
controversy" over the past week concerning the student elections has
proven to be a contradiction. It is a
contradiction because an act that was
meant with good intention has been
erroneously misconstrued as slander.
John Todd was one man who came to
the forefront and represented himself, alone, unattached from any organization or group. He is a man who
is concerned about the welfare and
well-being of the members of the
Swarthmore community and has every right to voice his feelings, his
concerns and to promote the people
that he feels are in the best interest of
the student body. This was in no way
an act ofpersonal gain, yet it became
a matter of personal attack on Todd's
integrity and character.
We must remember that when a
person such as Ford O'Connell, or
anyone for that matter, decides to run
for a public office his character, his
integrity, and behavior from past to
present, will be subject to public opinion and scrutiny. If members of the
Swarthmore communityperceive that
O'Connell has demonstrated bigoted
acts or any other acts of hostility, why
not have that questioned or debated
in a public arena by the very people
he wishes to represent?
In terms of responses to Todd's email, there have been varied opinions. Among them, which stood
prominently within the article, was a
statement made by Reuben Canada,
president of SASS. He criticized the
action of sending the e-mail and also
pointed out John Todd's responsibility as "a role model." Since Canada
has established Todd's position
within the community, does this then
mean that John Todd cannot have an
opinion and does not have the right to
express his opinion to four students
in a private e-mail? As for Canada's

apology sent to members of SASS
and O'Connell, one must question
the necessity of this action. By apologizing for this e-mail, it gives the
greater public the impression that the
organization as a whole was not supportive of Todd.
The writer of the article did not
include a section that conveyed the
views of non-executive members of
both the SASS organization and other
organizations which might have lent
stronger support of Todd or shed
more light on the situation. It is dangerous on the part of those involved
in the writing and editing of this
article to assume that one person with
one opinion can represent an entire
community of willing and able
voices; a single voice cannot properly represent any community,
whetherit be SASS, SAO, HOLA, or

SQU.

Now for the wake-up ca11... We
Swarthmore is
just a smallerversion of the society at
large. We have different voices, different circumstances and varied experiences that shape our views of the
society and the people within it. We
are all struggling to co-exist inside a
society that was not created for everyone to partake in, i.e., people of
color, women, and homosexuals.
Why is it when someone from the
Swarthmore community decides to
speak out against something he or
she believes to be wrong, this person
is criticized for standing up? We must
also begin to ask why the community
at large takes a passive role, while
issues concerning race, sexuality, and
bigotry remain avoided, untouched,
•and unchallenged. Not only do we
need to begin to ask why theseissues
are not dealt with consistently and
with seriousness, but what we can do
to create an atmosphere in which
harassment and malice towards any
group is not accepted nor condoned.

Survival

of the Fittest

Concept is Misunderstood

To the Editor:
I have some objections to assertions Shola Adidoye made in her
George Soros-influenced letter to the
editor (2/21), regarding the threat of
laissez-faire ideology. The first is her
understanding of "Social Darwinism." Quoting Soros: "Implicitly
laissez-faire capitalism also embraces
a socially Darwinistic, 'survival of
the fittest' mentality." Had she read
anything by Herbert Spencer, the
originator of the phrase, "survival of
the fittest," Abidoye would realize
that George Soros is mistaken.
The survival of the fittest concept
was simple. Classical liberal scholar
George H. Smith (1990) notes that in
his Essays, Spencer writes that "The
law is not the survival of the 'better'
or 'stronger'...lt is the survival of
those which are constitutionally fittest to thrive under the conditions in
which they are placed."
Smith emphasizes that "survival of
the fittest" is a description, not an
evaluation. It is based in the fact that
an organism must generate its own
actions in order to live, and that the
nature of these actions depends on
the nature of the organism and its
environment. Fitness is adaptation
"to the requirements of survival."
Abidoye and Soros are troubled
that lately "market values have undermined traditional values." Yet, the
�market* does not value things; a
free market is the interaction ofindividuals pursuing their values through
voluntary relationships among each
other. Are Abidoye and Soros upset
that people's values have changed,
and do they want to make laws to
force people to pursue "traditional"
values?Their problem is that ifpeople
are free, they may not do what they
want them to do.
In a free market, people are free to
pursue their self-interest. Abidoye
sets up a false alternative commonly
used by altruists: either the end of an
action is for others, and not for one-

self, or for oneself, and not for others.
This distinction is false. One's selfinterest is not restricted to considering only one's self. Consider your
own interests, and those you know:
Do you value the well-being ofother
people, and are you willing to take
action to support this well being?
Taking such action means *taking
responsibility* for achieving your
goals. The best refutation of the idea
that a free market does not promote
caring for others is history: look at
the numberofcharities around today,
and the number of charitable organizations that have been crowded out
by inefficient government programs.
Abidoye attacks freedom with a
quote by Soros: "the rights of the
individualare safeguarded but...there
are some shared values that hold society together." What does thatmean?
That people are free doesn't mean
they have no shared values—if they
did not, there would be no cooperation, no businesses, no charities, no
schools. Do Abidoye and Soros want
to violate people's rights to force
everyone to pursue the same values?
Laissez-faire and unchecked individualism bring about "the complete
subordination of the common interest," says Abidoyoe. What is "the
common interest"? People have interests, and they may have them in
common. Why can'tpeople with common interests get together and pursue
them in a free society?
I am sick and tired of people invoking some supernatural "common
good" or "common interest" as sort
of higher supernatural Platonic ideal
that people should live for. People
who use these terms claim that the
individual's self-interest should be
sacrificed for the "common good,"
and that the purpose of one's lifeis to
live for the sake of society: everyone
else but oneself. Well, excuse me for
being naive, but I still don't know
what the common good is.

Corporate Contracts Exploit Prisoners
By

Mark Charette

Why mine foreign soils for potential sweatshops when you can exploit
American workers and appear virtuous doing it?
This is the message delivered to
American transnational corporations
by California GovernorPete Wilson,
who envisions a profitable partnership between a downsized America
and a predominantly African-American and Latino prison labor force
who cannot demand health care or
higher wages and definitely can't organize in unions. The same governor
who championed Propositions 187
and 209 (which curtailed basic services to both legal and illegal immigrants and gutted Affirmative Action), slashed education budgets, and
supported the efforts of wealthy Californians to become virtually tax exempt wants to sell off the job surplus
served by the fast-food-justice of
"Three Strikes You're Out" (in which
offenders convicted of three felonies
are summarily sentenced to lifetime
imprisonment) and other policies intended to maximize the "efficiency"
of the state's justice system. The sentiment voiced by Wilson has been
spreading across the country for more
than a decade, provoking pronouncements to "make prisoners work 10
hours a day, six days a week'' (Phil
Gramm) and transform prisons into
"factories with fences" (former U.S.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren
Burger.) It is estimated that by the
year 2000, thirty percent of all inmates will be employedby American
companies.
Superficially, prison laborappears
as corporate charity bordering on civic
virtue. Provide prisoners with marketable skills and a work ethic that
will ease their re-entry into society.
Pay them considerably more than they
would make pressing license plates.
AT&T, Microsoft and Texas Instruments giving back to the community
as their stock prices skyrocket. A
win-win combination offering inmates twenty-first century alternatives to the unpaid mandatory field
labor exacted in Texas, Arkansas,
Louisiana and Alabama prisons.
Unfortunately, the relationship between state, contractor and company
is a glaring example of corporate
welfare rarely covered in the mainstream press. In an arrangement typical of prison contracting nationwide,
the Exmark Corporation rents the industrial facility at the Monroe penitentiary from the State of Washing-

ton for a dollar a year. In many other
states the rent is free. Construction,
equipment, and maintenance costs
—

all of which companies would normally have to pay—are covered by
the state. Workers are paid between
twenty cents and two dollars an hour.
In some states, wages are seized by
prison authorities under the guise of
repayment for meals and housing.
Recent reforms have provided private enterprise with additional impetus to contract with the nation's prisons, relaxing already minimal workplace safety standards and halving
the number of prison inspections
Coupled with a widespread "get tough
on crime" sentiment, these reforms
have created a political environment
in which prisoner demands for decent working conditions and fair
wages are pushed beneath the selfrighteous tide of "government efficiency."
In theory, "government efficiency"
holds elected officials accountable to
the needs of the majority of their
voters. The term has been trumpeted
by both Republicans and Democrats
as the key to a golden era in which
representatives publicly announce
government expenditures and respond to "taxpayer" demands for
spending increases and reductions.
"Trim the fat" has become a mantra
for voters who see little resemblance
between the government they read
about in high school history textbooks and the government they gape
at on the nightly news. If the "taxpayers" who want to "trim the fat" were
truly representative ofthe majority of
voters, one would expect the results
of their cries for "efficiency" to have
enormous social benefits, including a
revamped prison system with both
reduced costs and a lower rate of
receividism. Instead, "taxpayers"
have demanded longer sentences and
reduced inmate education programs.
It is liberal conceit to assume that
such priorities are not representative
of a large bulk of American voters.
But would an "efficient" government
with the money of its taxpayers in
mind subsidize campaign contributors like Minnesota entrepreneur
Irwin Jacobs, who landed a contract
with Wisconsin prisons to repackage
damaged retail goods after he and his
colleagues contributed $40,000 to a
state representative's reelection campaign? Would a government committed to "retraining" its incarcerated for a socially and economically

money spent on soap, towels, food,
beds, and other items necessary to
run a prison, companies granted contracts stand to earn hefty profits. Interestingly enough, politicians never
discuss and the media seldom highlights this aspect of the war on crime.
Moreover, in a never ending quest
to cut costs and make prisons more
profitable, wardens contract out their
inmates' services to major corporations more and more. Thus the nice
new jeans or shirt you just bought
may have been produced by prison
labor.
Eventually we must question who
benefits and who suffers from the
proliferation of the prison-industrial
complex. I'd propose that a small
coterie of individualsreap great profits and gain influence as a result of
their involvement while the nation as
a whole suffers from the growing
percentage of incarcerated citizens
and people with criminal records and
the siphoning of money to finance
increased spending on crime-related
items, among other things. Merely
warehousing prisoners does not solve
the problem. If anything it makes the
situation worse given the nature of
our prison system. Our prisons do not
intend to reform criminals. Instead
they effectively teach how to commit
bettercrimes by bringing experienced
criminals together with impressionable youth and novice crooks. If we,
in fact, wish to make this country
safer we need to thwart the development of the prison-industrial complex and begin utilizing more preventative measures.

find locals on the banks of the bayou
with their cane poles catching perch,

One of the secret treasures of the
Southern coast is that white Americans, Europeans, Blacks, and Indians

Doesn't this sound just too horrible? We should make these unsophisticated people more passionate
about life; more aware how their

are ruining the lives of oppressed
chickens and contributing to the perpetuation of social injustice in Brazil.
Instead of buying five ears of normal

Perhaps in their free time—somewhere between working their ass off

of civic duty enables them to pursue
whatever whim excites their imagination and expect everybody else to
say "good, good, another A+just like

I will not respect a binary vision of
the world where there is good and
evil, hungry cows with corporate
logos. The root causes of world hunger, deforestation, and genocide of
indigenous people are far more complicated than a moral choice to eat
vegetables. But so many passionate

people choose to make simpleminded symbolic acts which are often harmful to the people they allegedly care about. For all our friends
who hate sweatshops in Guatemala,
they might want to consider that those
jobs often pay a lot more than fieldwork, and that Guatemalan union
activists often think self-interested
American labor unions are greedy
bastards for trying to impose regulations (for the benefit of the poor, of
course) that make sweatshops less
profitable and less likely to threaten
American jobs. Emerson said something along the lines of "when I see
somebody coming down the path offering to help me, I run away as fast as

possible."
It is true that everybody has a right

people's passionate opinions can be
challenged: Does that paper reflect
your opinion, or did you justforget to

Excuse me, there are "control issues"
in that statement.
I just want to know, Do you love

ethnics? Do you love Pat Robertson,
because a lot of them do? Do you
care that rising wage inequality is
probably the greatest threat to our
democracy —not cows? Do you love
the hardwork required to remedy the
social ills that leave the poor and

people to access institutions, or is it
easier for you to criticize and destroy
the institutions that made it possible
for you to live in abundance? Are
you prepared to help people help

Cynicism Prevents Meaningful Discourse
By

Min Lee

In a school of such calibre as Swarthmore, the clashing of bright minds
and strong personalities is inevitable.
The fact that the student body comprises so many confident and intelligent individuals—and who are perhaps accustomed to being reckoned
so—and the fact thatthe small liberal
arts college is an academic setting
conducive to intellectual discourse
and debate, naturally leads to a showdown between students (not necessarily aligned with liberal or conservative camps) who hold extremely
strong opinions.
And this is not a bad sign at all.
Swarthmore is a place where intellectualism is highly valued, and what
better way to promote such a quality
than an intense exchange of ideas?
But sometimes the intensity can lose

control, often leading to unwanted
effects. One of the offshoots of this
atmosphere is cynicism.
The source of cynicism is often an
overly strong sense of self-righteousness, and in the case of intellectual
debate, the feeling that one's ideas
are superior to others—almost an arrogant, blind confidence in the infallibility of one's position. Its emergence is dangerous in that it signifies
a derailing of one of the original
goals ofintellectualdebate: to achieve
a better and more complete understanding of the issues of concern
through the collaboration of minds.
Yet where does the collaboration
come in when everyone simply refuses to give any credit to opinions
other than their own?
Cynicism breeds more cynicism—as the subject of attack is put on the
defensive—thus sparking an endless

vicious cycle, which brings about a
gradual divergence—rather than a
desired convergence—of various interests.

Apart from some fundamental ethical values that are more or less held
universally, there is no such thing as
a right or wrong idea, in the absolute
sense. Deviance from the norm is not
wrong by definition, but simply deviance from the norm. Every student on
campus is entitled to their own beliefs and views, as long as they are
backed by sound reasoning. Hence,
the starting point of every argument
should not be that such an argument
is the unequivocal truth, butrather an
acknowledgment that it is simply one
of the many legitimate points of view
present. Intellectual discourse within
the community—both political and
otherwise—should be undertaken in
the context of a willingness to recog-

nize other ideas and to engage in
honest, open debate. This form of
discussion should be characterized
by clear, rational thinking, as opposed to unabated, inflammatory criticism.
Yet this is not to say that we should
refrain from disagreementaltogether.
Dispute is good, and by all means it
should be preserved. What is suggested here is simply that we develop
a basic respect for all soundideas and
opinions, the only criteria for soundness here being a plausible line of
reasoning. To express disagreement
one need not resort to the literary
devices of hyperbole and irony, but
rather directness and a clear sense of
purpose to produce more conviction.
The "battle" of ideas need not be a
bitter, scathing one. Indeed, respect
is not a sign of conformity, but rather
one of civility.

So, you thought conservatives

Dante's Peak Erupts In Midst Of Terrible Disaster Movie

Disaster

movies are back! Everywhere
you look, the new Hollywood fad is
to spend untold millions of dollars
creating movies depicting every kind of natural and unnatural disaster imaginable, from
tornadoes to asteroids to aliens to volcanos.
Who are the real victims of these neo-disaster flicks? Certainly not the characters in
peril, who, after the filming stops, are sitting
high and dry in posh palaces in Beverly Hills.
No, the real victims of disaster movies are
filmgoers, who have to sit through tiresome
re-hashes of the same dumb plots over and
over again.
A good case in point is Dante's Peak. This
movie is bad. It's not fun-bad, whereyou can
sit and laugh. No, Dante's Peak is bad-bad.
It's so unremittingly and unimaginitively
lousy, by the end you'll shake your head in
disbelief.
Pierce Brosnan plays a geologist who, as
the movie opens, loses his fiancee to an
erupting South American volcano. Four years
later, he is sent by the US Geological Survey
to investigate some anomalous readings from
Dante's Peak. When he arrives, he finds a
tiny, beautiful town with a beautiful mayor
(Linda Hamilton) who welcome him.
When two vacationers are toasted in a hot
spring, Brosnan wants to put the town on
alert. Of course, Brosnan's boss (Charles
Hallahan) doesn't want to put the town on
alert, because he's sure that the anomalous

peril are present in full force, and that absoreadings don't mean that the volcano is going and Hamilton, who have to go up the mounHamilton's

All

hail, Minions of Darkness. Many
pardons for my absence last week. I
was unexpectedly called away to the
Third Annual Conference of the Black Arts
and Magicks, held this past weekend in Las
Vegas. (Those ofus withthe power to predict
the future love Las Vegas.) Normally, I
would not let you in on my whereabouts, but
I thought .you might find the Conference's
events worthy of your attention.
The theme for this year's conference, much
to my surprise, was "Magic, Mutilation, and
Multiculturalism." This was in marked contrast to last year's conference, whose theme
was "Bringing Sorcery to Politics," or the
first year's, "The Occult and Public Relations: How to Recover From Waco." But
once I learned that the annual final orgy had
not been cancelled —similar to that party
known as "Genderfuck" which concludes
every Sager Symposium, only all the outlandish costumes are black—l threw myself,
so to speak, into the conference's discussions, and found myself agreeing wholeheartedly with a fellow sorcerer who observed that
these were the whitest black arts he'd ever
seen.
As discussion continued, for the first time
I began to realize how thoroughly true his
statement was. After all, who stands for my s-

when was the last time the Apollo Theatre

American occult frontieris almost completely

commendable when the Conference voted to
(1) take more active steps to drawing people
ofall races to Satan's path; and (2) educate us
in the ways of fortune-telling and magical
practices from cultures not necessarily our
own.
Such as:
'Predicting the futurefrom music videos.
For example: the popcorn thrown in the final

less fun. One ofmy favorite ofall time has to
be Irvin Allen' s 1978 masterpiece The Swarm,
about invading killer bees in Texas who seem
to be able to destroy nuclear plants, derail
trains, etc. The movie has quite a cast of
characters, including Michael Caine, Richard Chamberlain, and Olivia De Havilland.
Now, since we never really see everything
happen and the bees are just a huge penciledin cloud in the sky, our mindsmake the scope
of the movie gigantic. But, in Dante's Peak,
the multi-million dollar special effects show
us everything head on. There's no sense that
anyone had to be creative, and watching the
movie is a lazy experience.
Dante's Peak is rumored to have cost something like $ll5 million, which would place it
in a small group with Waterworldand James
Cameron's upcoming disaster mo vie Tita/ific
as one of the most expensive movies ever
made. Mick Jackson's forthcoming Volcano
(not the same movie, I promise) is said to be
another $ 100 million project. What a waste!
I imagine much of the cost of Dante's Peak
came from producing every exterior shot of
the town, in which a towering peak had to be
added digitally in the background. Also, I'm
sure Brosnan' s hair products took a big chunk
out of the budget.
I have a better idea: Instead of making
another bad disaster movie, why not just take
the money and give it to real-life victims of
natural disasters? It would save a whole lotof
time and effort and would be infinitely more
effective.

Long Kiss Sets Off On-Campus Movies
By Jeremy

Ma thus & Julia Sable
with Patrick "Toltec" Runkle

"Set It Off!" Queen Latifah cries spiritedly, trying to psych up her three best friends
halfway through Friday night's flick. And
"set it off they do, robbing banks, shooting
people, and making a statement against the
American legal and justice system all at the
same time. Set It Off, while not an outstanding film, is slightly intriguing, somewhat
entertaining, and a bit upsetting.
The movie gets off to a quick start, as we
watch four female pals (Latifah as tough
Cleo, Vivica A. Fox as assertive Frankie,
Jada Pinkett as intense Stony, and Kimberly
Elise as timid Tisean) face horrible events
which change their outlook on life—and the
U.S. "System." An innocent brother is shot
and killed by the police; a child is taken away
by a child protection service; and so on.
Watching the shocking violence and random
acts of cruelty by the higher authorities, we
are drawn into the story immediately. Luckily, we do feel sorry for the main characters,
or the rest of the movie would not work. It
should seem preposterous that the girls take
up arms and start robbing banks, but it doesn't
(although it might have been safer ifthey had
just gotten counseling, but how much money
would a flick like that make?).'
The masked avengers storm L.A., robbing
in their spare time when they are not working
as housekeepers in a ritzy penthouse apartment (where, incidentally, they hide their
money). The movie contains several interesting, brief sub-plots: there's the boss' theft of
the money (and his eventual demise brought
upon by a tireless search by the group), Cleo's
involvement withanother woman, and Elise's
fight to get her child back. However, we
wanted brief subplots, not Stony's romance
with Keith (played by "hunk" Blair
Underwood), a Harvard-grad corporate
banker. This silly affair, which takesup a fair
amount of time, diminishes the film's quality. Dapper Keith treats Stony like a princess,
makes her feel special, and, in the end, guess
whose bank she robs? This boring contrivance permeates the female-buddy action
movie like bad breath in an enclosed space.
As the motion picture progresses, we see
that the women have gone too far; their strong
bond as friends has elicited a stronger bond as
criminals, one which means they will, as a
group, stop at nothing until they' ve looted the
largest reserves in town. They don't care that
the police are after them, nor that they, themselves, are ending the lives of innocent per-

sons.

Fate lures theirfriendship into a doomed
finale which is unpredictable, and, at the
same time, heart-breaking.
Set It Off, as a movie, is very affecting. The
story introduces some riveting twists on an
idea that could have been lame and unorigi-

nal. Three of the four women also give fine
performances. Only newcomer Kimberly
Elise detracts from the film. Her part, which
is the smallest of them all, seems to be underwritten, misdirected, and just added to the
blend at the last minute; while on screen,
she's either crying or complaining—she
doesn't demonstrate much versatility in this
role. Queen Latifah, on the other hand, steals
the movie from her counterparts. She has
such amazing screen presence that, when the
other women are on the screen, you can't help
but move your eyes toward her—her overreactions, ferocity, and anger all revitalize
the movie in its weakest hours (or 10-minute
stretches). Most of all, while the movie is not
extremely well-executed, it's more than just
an action movie. It conveys an important
message, namely, thatit is possible for women,
or, for that matter, anyone, to feel so scorned
and frustrated by the government that they
start abiding by their own brand ofdangerous
laws.
Renny Harlin's action-packed spectacle The
Long Kiss Goodnight stars his wife Geena
Davis as Samantha Caine, a mild-mannered
housewife with amnesia who leads a normal
life in a small New Jersey town. One day, she
discovers she may have a secret past hidden
under the cloak of her amnesia.
Samantha hires a local disreutable private
eye (Samuel L. Jackson) to search for her
mysterious past. (Samuel L. Jackson or no
Samuel L. Jackson, is there no movie character capable of hiring a respectable private

eye?) When people start attacking her home
and family, her past life as a top-secret assassin (as well as her blonde hair) is awakened
and she goes on a cross-country odyssey to
figure out what's going on.

Restaurant Review

Have Lots Of Cheap
Fun At Pappou's Place
By Brantley Bryant
&

Rachel Buurma

After

our brief sojourn into Philadel
phia (whew, what a trip!), we're go
ing to return this week to the homely
comforts of the Baltimore Pike. You know,
we could probably write reviews all year for
restaurants on the Pike and still not run out of
them; it's really a wealth of culinary resources (although some ofthem are dubious).
One of the Pike restaurants that is anything
but dubious is Pappou's. It's easy to find, as
it's right in frontof the Burger King (get there
by taking a right onto the Pike from Swat).
Pappou's is a small pizza place. They offer
a decent variety of food, with pizza, pasta
dishes, burgers, and the like. The prices are a
little bit more than Renato's, but the difference in the food is notable. Rachel recom-

Speaking HerMind...

Don't Talk Any (Intellectual) Trash
By

Christine Leahey

If

I had to, I would write the First Amend
ment in my own blood. I believe the right
to free speech is the most precious libert

granted in America. However, the consequence of such freedom is that a lot of stupid
things are said. If you thinkchalk scribblings
are bad, you should hear the things I have
been told while at Swarthmore. Lacking the
anonymity afforded by sidewalk graffiti, selfdescribed Swatties unabashedly voice the
most inane, far-fetched and politically
(in)correct thoughts in the entiremarket place
of ideas. Pre-historic cave drawings express
more complex thoughts than the utterances of
some people at this institution ofhigher learning.
For instance, the other day I overheard a
conversation in Tarble lounge. A visitor from
Franklin and Marshall asked a Swarthmore
student about her Intro to Islam course. It was
a rather broad question, along the lines of
"What did you learn?" The girl hesitated for
a moment, then replied: "We learned about
Islam." I laughed. After further contemplation, she explained herself: "I can't tell you
what I learned because I have already internalized the knowledge...it seems like I al-

ready knew it, so it's hard to explain." Of
course, she followed this statement with: "Do
you know what I mean?" I laughed harder.
I'm not sure about anyone else, but what
I've learned at Swarthmore is that pseudointellects can turn big words into cliches,
while the average person can give cliches
new meaning.
Sure, I say dumb things on occasion, but at
least they are stated absent-mindedly or under duress. Whereas the following claims
have been made after some deliberation. I've
been told that smoking is calming because it
helps you breathe deeply; fascist dictators
had to conquer Third World countries in
order to "civilize" them; patriarchal societies
are ideal for women; anything—female genital mutilation, racism, polygamy—is justifiable if it is a part of one's "culture" and that
the best welfare solution is to bomb the inner
cities, to name a few.
Of course, there's also the thing which
people talk about more than anything else:
sex. Most, if not all, of the Swatties I have met
are obsessed with it. The quote boards on
every dormitory hallreaffirm this perception.
The sad thing is that some of those sound
bites aren't taken out of context. In fact, some
of the most outlandishFreudian remarks are

made in the classroom. My favorite came
from a girl in my English course. Her analysis
of Hamlet's "To be or not to be" soliloquy
equated "the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune" with airborne phallic symbols. So
what if Shakespeare never intended flying
penises to represent Hamlet's Oedipal angst?
Revisionist interpretations are more fun.
Or how about the Swarthmore gigolo who
claimed to have fallen in love with me "at first
sight"? He failed to mention that he confessed this to every other female in the freshman class. When I confronted him about
being an opportunistic sleaze, he clarified: "I
know I told other girls that I loved them, but
I only meant it when I said it to you." Frustrated that he couldn't outtalk me, he concluded that there was a language barrier between us. Apparently his lexicon doesn't
include words like honesty, integrity, respect.
Surprisingly, I have more frank, stimulating conversations with the fifth-grader I tutor
than with my peers. She's too young to worry
abouthow her words will be perceived and so
she speaks the truth. Luckily, her weekly
didactic counterbalances therhetoric spewed
by my fellow classmates. I guess that's where
you'll find the greatest wisdom—out of the
mouths of babes.

mends the roast-beef sandwich dinner special, which is actually made on home-made
bread. Of particular interest to students is a
special for about six bucks, which gets you
two small pizzas (10") and two
Cokes...although the Cokes are very small.
The atmosphere is pretty festive, as there
are usually a decent amount of people drinking beer at the bar at almost any time of day.
There's a big
screen TV in the
corner which is
usually playing either news, talkshows, or sitcoms: things most
Swatties sometimes get a real
craving for. It's
family-run (or at
least we think so)
and so the staff can
be variable. When we went there yesterday,
we were served by a really friendly guy who
got us our food quickly and called Brantley
“doctor” (we have no idea why). Of course,
another time we went there, we got a waitress
who was less than pleasant. So it’s pretty
variable. A good idea is to dress like real
people when you go there, and not like college students, as the more conservatively
dressed you are, the better you’re served.
Speaking of “serving,” Pappou’s also offers beer. But, as a piece of warning to everyone over twenty-one: they will not serve you
unless everyone at your table is over twentyone. So take heed, elder Swatties.
Overall, Pappou’s isn’t great, but it’s good,
and it’s definitely a good idea to go out for
pizza once in a while, just so ordering it in
seems like a treat.
We’ve received some response from our
first article about the “Casino Customers in
Back” sign on the R-Way diner. Apparently,
the “Casino Customers” are people who take
buses to Atlantic City for the day, and the*
buses stop in the back of the R-Way. For this
information, we would like to thank Professor Turpin, Terri Narkin, and Doug Berger.

got a hold of it.
Since then, Harlin and Davis had a complete disaster when their $9O million pirate
movie Cutthroat Island (itself a laughable
flick) lost more money in its release than any
other film ever. While Cutthroat Island was
in post-production—i.e. before it flopped—they took on this big-budget project with lots
of gusto.
The result is somewhat strange. The script
is hard-edged, but the movie is lacking in
direction. While the movie could have been a
crackling action-thriller, Harlin, as expected,
thrives on overkill. Every scene is over-shot,
over-edited, and over-acted, and any initial
inspiration the script had is lost.
This is not to say that themovie isn't totally
unenjoyable. Thankfully, the movie's saving
grace is Jackson, who manages to inject lots
of humor into the picture. Davis has never
been the most gifted actress, and with her
husband as director her performances are
getting more and more unfocused. But the
banterbetween them is actually really funny.
In the end, The Long Kiss Goodnight is not
a good movie, but it does move along quickly
and the action is eye-popping. Still it's not
much of a treat for the brain.

Menzer
Fights a

Duel
To The
Death!

I

know that in a peace-loving
place like Swarthmore, whatl'm

about to admit will probably

shock some of you gentler souls,
but I need an article subject for this
week, so it must be done.
I often think about if I was forced
into a live or die, one man standing,
to-the-death duel with my best
friend, who would win?
At first glance, I think most of
you would bet on my friend Becky.
She's easily got about six inches of
height on me, sometimes goes to the
gym, and has good muscle tone.
But, you also must remember that
she is inherently a good person.
She's not a killer. She would fight
fair.
I, on the other hand, wouldn't. I
would pull hair, scratch at hereyes,
and, if necessary, biteclean through
to the bone. So in a match between
me and Becky, I think I would ultimately stand victorious over the
mangled, bloody corpse of my best
friend. Sorry, Becky, but you gotta
do what you gotta do.
Yeah, you can waste a lot of time
thinking about stuff like this. Like
what if McCabe library dwellers
were to wage war against Cornell
library inhabitants? Cornell kids do
have a technical advantage. They
can probably use their surroundings
to build suspension bridges and
water purification plants. But
McCabers have the knowledge of
the Ancients on their side. They
have the timeworn experience of
such great warrior races as the Vikings and the Romans, not to mention all the wisdom we have gained
from our studies of feminist criticism.
How about Tarble checkers versus Sharpies checkers? This one I
think is easy because, although
Sharpies checkers tend to be more
"mature," Tarble checkers are probably suffering from malnutrition as
well as high cholesterol.
The Administration versus Public Safety. Well, Public Safety does
have some nifty pieces of equipment (like walkie-talkies and big
sticks) and should probably have
some sort of training, but pound for
pound, they do tend to be a little
more dense than the Administration. I mean, I' ve seen PublicSafety
try to apprehend extremely inebriated, naked young men running
around outside ofWillets and fail. I
think a sure-footed member of our
Administration could easily avoid
the grasp ofPublic Safety and, then,
attack when the officers were taking a nap in Ben West. The Administration is wily that way.
In a match between the guys who
empty the dumpster outsidemy windowevery morning and Swarthmore
Police, I dunk the victor would naturally be the former. They would just
annoy the police to death.
The final battle I would like to
propose is one that my friend Josh
and I discuss quite a bit. Who
would be left standing in a duel to
the death between McGruff the
Crime Dog and Flipper the Dolphin
in a pool of thigh-high water? Josh
says that McGruff would win because McGruff is a canine biped
with sharp claws and pointy teeth.
He also has police training. Josh
believes that McGruff would just
pick flipper out of the water and
take a bite out of him.
I strongly disagree with Josh for a
severalreasons. First, Flipper is slippery and McGruff does not have
opposable thumbs. Idon'tthink that
McGruff would be able to pick up
that deft dolphin. Second, Flipper
is fast. He'll be out of McGruff s
reach before the dog's got a paw in
the water. Third, McGruffhas obviously been sitting behind a desk for
several years, writing public service announcements and scarfing
down doughnuts and coffee. He's
out of shape and no amount of police training will save him if he's
got a cramp.
I think that Ripper will swim up
behind McGruff, snap both of the
detectives's ankles in his powerful
jaws, and squeal and chirp in delight as McGruff, unable to stand,
drowns facedown in the water.
Yeah, they call him Flipper.

Scores His 1,000th Point
Against Haverford College
By

Colin Convey

When

Ben Schall
arrived
at
Swarthmore
four years ago there were
high expectations for
what he might do. As a
senior at Moorestown
High School, Schall had

scored his one-thousandth point during his
team's final regular season game and proceeded
to lead them deep into
the playoffs.
This past weekBen has
managed to equal that
feat once again. Last Saturday at Haverford,
Schall scored his onethousandth point with
only two minutes remaining in the Garnet's final
regular season contest.
With that basket, he became only thefifth player
in school history to record
1000 points and 500 rebounds. He is the thirteenth player to score
over 1000points in Swarthmore history. Schall

continued to add to these
totals in the team's two

playoff wins this week,

rival Muhlenberg and

game to another level in
these post-season games. He has made a ton of big shots and is probably the main reason why we’ve been so
successful this season.”
Aaron Bond '97 said, "Ben has been our go-to guy for the past two years. Whenever we're in the clutch, we
give him the ball and he usually delivers. He definitely deserved to join that select group of people."
Throughout his career at Swarthmore, Schall has managed to exceed any expectations that Head Coach Lee
Wimberly could have held for him. Wimberly said, "Ben Schall is the most complete player I have ever had
at Swarthmore. His ability to do so many different things well on offense and to guard any opposing player has
been unmatched."
Indeed, Schall's numbers speak volumes of his versatility. Ben is the only Swarthmore College player ever
to collect 1000 points, 500 rebounds, 200 assists, and 100 steals. Those numbers place him in the top ten on
each of the school's career lists; and this season, they have landed him in the top ten of each category within
the Centennial Conference as well.
"Ben was an integral part of our success even in his sophomore year when I was a senior." adds Swarthmore
Assistant Coach and fellow 1000-point scorer Kirk Daulerio. "It was really cool that he scored his one
thousandth point in his last game which was against Haverford... If anyone deserved the honor, it was Ben
because of his hard work and dedication to the team."

Dr. Joel Fish, Ph.D., addressed
Swarthmore students on Monday
night in a presentation geared towards balancing the pressures ofboth
athletics and academics in a college
setting. This lecture was sponsored
by the Captain's Council. Dr. Fish,
who has worked with the Phillies,
76ers, U.S. National Gymnastics
Team, and U.S. National Women's
Soccer Team, talked about the important role of mental health in athletic performance.
Fish broke the audience into pairs
on various occasions, asking them to
share theirearliest competitive memories and then later break down their
sources of pressure (family, friends,
and coaches, for example). Fish emphasized that the attitudes athletes
bring into their current situations are
deeply rooted in early memories.
Through the course of his lecture,
he touched upon five basic principles:
self-confidence, temper control, team
work, attitude, and respect. By breaking down the mental aspects of athletics into these categories, Fish focused on devising tricks that would
enable the athlete to maintain a balanced life on and off the field, often
using simple relaxation techniques to
reduce stress and maintain a positive
perspective.

final nail into the coffin.
OnSunday, both Competitive & Non-Competitivebasketball leagues
held championships. In Non-Comp action, The Mertz Squad hung on
for the overtime victory over Aaron's Snatch, 51-45. It was definitely
a "thriller in Lamb Miller" as Josh Roth '99 put the game out of reach
with his final two-pointer in the closing seconds. In Comp hoops,
Amar's Army repeated as IM Champ with a convincing win over The
Alumni, 47-35.
In IM Whiffle Ball action Linder's Team convincingly stomped "We
Did It Like This" with a score of 10-4. In the nightcap Men's Baseball

Women's Basketball Season Finale
Rachel Gutman

As the 1996-97 women's basket-

ball season ends, it is a time for reflection on the season and contemplation for the future. While the Garnet lost their last two games, against
Eastern College and Haverford College, finishing their season with a 716record, team membersand coaches
are remembering the high points of
these past few months and already
thinking towards next year.
Thursday night, Swarthmore
hostedEastern College in what proved
to be a close contest and frustrating
loss. After twenty minutes of tough
defenseand aggressive offense, Swarthmore went into the locker room at
halftime with a five point lead.
Their 3-2 defensive strategy had
proved capable of shutting down their
opponent and creating turnovers that
led to scoring on the other end of the
court. Thalia Mills 'OO commented,
"The first half was really good. Even
though the refs were not exactly on

our side, we [were] controlled and
ran our plays. [Our] rebounding in
the first half was also very strong."
Swarthmore was confident and
hopeful as the secondhalf began, but
Eastern College came out ignited and
immediately headed a campaign for
victory. With some questionable rulings by the game's officials and
Swarthmore's struggle to stay levelheaded, Eastern emerged on top with
a 69-60 win.
Key players in this contest include
MichelleWalsh '9B and Lisl CochranBond '97, both with 15 points and
eight rebounds. Walsh also had four
steals. Jean Quinn '99 came off the
bench to add 10 points and eight
rebounds and Holly Baker '99 contributed nine points and four assists.
Saturday night's game against the
rival Fords from Haverford College
was also a disappointing loss. Although Swarthmore was pumped to
annihilate Haverford on their home
court, especially after losing earlier
this season at home, Swarthmore was

outscored and out-rebounded in both
halves of the game. One of the
Garnet's biggest problems was its
free throw shooting, as they sunk
only 42 percent of their attempts from
the line.
Team leaders in this contest were
Cochran-Bond with 16 points and
five rebounds and Holly Barton '99
with 11 points and six rebounds. Pia
Houseal '97, though ill, added eight
points and six rebounds.
This game also proved to be the
last for senior co-captains, CochranBond and Houseal. Walsh, the lone
junior on the team, said, "Lisl and
Pia's presence on the court and in the
locker room will be missed very
much. Their points and rebounds will
be difficult to replace, but we're not
just losing great players, we' re losing
great friends and leaders on the team."
Mills added, "Even though I've
only played with Lisl and Pia for one
year, I will miss them very much;
they have given so much to the basketball program over their years at

Swat. Basketball will definitely be
different next year without them."
When looking forward to next
year's season, optimism is the prevalent attitude. Team membersfeel it is
important to learn from this year's
mistakes and build from them.
Mills commented, "One ofthe main
things that we need to improve on is
our consistency. Sometimes we
played great, and other times, well,
we didn't exactly light up the court."
"We didn't finish the season as
strong as we had hoped, but we do
have some things to build on for next
season," said Walsh.
Head coach Adrienne Shibles is
already preparing strategies for next
year. "With just one senior next year,
the team will be extremely young. In
addition, the loss of captains Pia
Houseal and Lisl Cochran-Bond
makes us a much smaller team. I am
anticipating a completely different
style of play for the team next year.
Look for more full-court pressure
and fast break basketball."

CatherineLaine had an amazing weekend in her quest to help bring the
Centennial Conference Championship title to Swat. On Friday night,
Catherine had the fourth longest jump in the nation (Dili) so far this year
to win and qualify automatically for Nationals. Her jump shattered the
meet, school, and conference records. She then led off the victorious
4x200, giving Swarthmore a huge lead.
On Saturday, Catherine started off by winning the 55m Hurdles in an
NCAA qualifying time of 8.71 that also shattered the school record. Next
on the agenda, she finished second in the open 55mand second in the open
200 to teammate Danielle Duffy '9B, who was named co-athlete ofthe
meet. Finally, Catherine ran the first leg of the 4x400 relay, which set a
meet, school, and conference record of 4:12.24. Not only did Catherine
lead by example, but her astronomical energy level and attitude infected
the whole team on their march to victory.

"Colin is our court leader," said Aaron Bond '97. "He distributes the
ball well and is essentially our coach on the court." Colin Convey was
named on Tuesday to the men's basketball All-Centennial Conference
First Team. This is the first time Swarthmore has had a men's basketball
player named First Team since the conference was formed in 1993.
Colin led the conference this season in assists (4.0 per game), led the
conference in three-point field goals made (55), and was fourth in the
conference in free throw percentage (.804). He averaged 11.0 points for
the season. He holds the school record in three-point field goals.
Colin also collected 10 points in the upset victory on Wednesday night
against Johns Hopkins to advance to the Centennial Conference Championship game, taking place in Tarble Pavilion tomorrow at 7: 30 p.m. The
team has qualified for a playoff bid to the NCAA Division II Tournament,

Every member of the men and
women's indoor trackand field teams
gave everything they had to make the
Centennial Conference Championship Meet at Haverford College this
past weekend an extraordinary success for Swarthmore.
In a pep talk from the team's captains Thursday evening, theSwat team
was compared to various entities:
predators prepared to devour their
rivals, a constellation where each
member of the team represented a
star whose light was necessary to
make the team complete, and a circuit where the combination of
everyone' s effortand enthusiasmproduced an insurmountable amount of
energy, the team was inspired to perform to their fullest capacity in the
competition.
The Garnet women gave it their all
this Friday and Saturday, winning
the Conference Meet for the first time
since 1989. Danielle Duffy '9B was
honored the title of co-athlete of the
meet for a stellar performance
throughout the course of the championships. Duffy stole first place in the
200 dash at 29.96, took second in
both the 400 m dash at 60.42 and the
long jump where she jumped a distance of 16'3.75", and placed third in
the 55m dash crossing the finish line
in 7.68.

11-15,but rebounded to win the second one 15-7, forcing the match into
a playoff game. Doan and Chomat
eventually triumphed 15-12.
The singles players were not so
lucky. The only singles victory of the
day was posted by second singles
Tepavcevic against Albright oppo-

The team won overall with a score of
3-2 to earn its second win against
Albright this season. The sweetest
part of the victory was beating the
only team to triumph over Bry nMawr.
The competitive badminton season is not finished for some players,
who will test theirmettle in the Pennsylvania State Open Tournament taking place at Albright College on
March 8.
With five seniors graduating, and
four of them starters, next year will
be a rebuilding year for the team. But,
the team has many strong players
both old and new, so who knows?
Next year, maybe Bryn Mawr will
meet crushing defeat at Swarthmore's
hands, and maybe the team's 6-2
record will turn into an 8-0 one.
