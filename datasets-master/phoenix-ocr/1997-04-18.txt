Honors Change
Angers Students
By Wendy Kemp

Several junior and senior
honors students were surprised
early this week when they discovered that the Honors grading system was undergoing a
major revision. Earlier this
week, the Curriculum Committee proposed a change in the
grading techniques of the Senior Honors Study. Under the
new system, students in the
Senior Honors Study would receive a grade on their transcript
of A+ for Highest Honors, A
for High Honors, and B+ for
Honors. In addition, two new
categories of "pass" and "marginal pass" were added.
"I think most seniors reacted
with shock and anger," said
Honors student Jessica Fisher
'9B. "After all, Senior Honors
Studies are due this week...and
exams are just a month away."
The new grading system was
implemented in order to make
transcripts more clear to medical and law schools, which have
often expressed confusion over
just whatthe different denominations of Honors signify.
"Some students have found it
hard to convince medical and
law schools that the Honors notations mean anything," said
Fisher. Graduateprograms consider a student's grade point
average to be indicative of that
student's overall performance
in college. With no letter grade
available for Senior Honors
Study, these schools are unable
to calculate the GPAs of Swarthmore students.
With only a month before

external examinations begin,
some seniors feel theissuecould
not have come at a worse time.
"It is a crappy time of the year
to have to deal with this," said
Honors student Wendy Williams '97. "These grades have
been talked about for two years
and only decided on three weeks
ago, and only conveyed to us
yesterday."
Much doubt remains in the
air as to whether theeffect these
changes bring about will be
positive or not. Adding these
two new denominations to the
program (pass and marginal
pass) would naturally result in
the examiners using them, with
proportionally fewer students
receiving Honors upon graduation. "Basically, by having marginal pass and pass, they are
encouraging the External examiners to move" more of us
into those categories, so that
fewer of us get honors," said
Honors student Justin Herring
'97. "I understand the reasoning behind having the pass option, but it is overkill to put in
pass and marginal pass."
The issue has been discussed
everywhere, from Sharpies to
Parrish Beach. Yet the question
remains among students as to
why the marginal pass category
is necessary. "All the goals of
adding a pass level would be
met if we had only the three
levels of honors and a pass
level," pointed out Herring.
Among the hotly debated issues was the elimination of an
'A-' from the program, with

Several amendments proposed by Student

Council (SC) regarding its jurisdiction over
Budget Committee (BC) have sparked heated
debate amongst council members.
Under current rules, a series ofchecks and
balances are in place to limit the power of
both SC and BC. SC presents its budget to
BC. Although BC's final budget must be
approved by SC, SC cannot change the budget itself; it can only suggest changes. In the
case of an impasse, SC has the authority to
override any BC recommendations concerning accounts over $lOOO dollars.
Most contentious are amendments I and in
of SC's proposal., which essentially allow
SC to bypass the regular budgeting process,
giving it full authority to allocate funding
without the consent ofBC. The latter amendment, which has caused much controversy,
asserts "Nothing in Article IV [which details
the duties of BC], Section I of this Constitution shall be construed to deny the final jurisPhoto by Diana Hunt

"When I was asked to do this, I
said sure, and then I realized what I
was getting my self into," said moderator Raymond Hopkins, professor
ofPolitical Science, as he began the
panel discussion on Israeli-Palestinian relations Sundayafternoon. The
end result proved educational, although passions were raised among
the more than one hundred members of the Swarthmore community
in attendance.
The discussion featured Lisa
Hajjar, Assistant Professor of
Sociology &Anthropology, presenting the Palestinian perspective,
Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, speaking on the sideof Israel, and Jon Fox,
a member of the International Relations committee in the U. S. House of
Representatives, who arrived an hour
late, and was only able to participate
in the question and answer section.
Hajjar began the first of the 18

Furthermore, she said, since Israel has the "upper hand," any
change will be seen as an Israeli

one-sided generosity on the part of
the Israelis is "wrong." Hajjar said,

Swarthmore engineering students, notched
more victories last weekend. The robot handily defeated almost all ofits competitors in a
race Saturday at Princeton University. Swarthmore was not eligible to win any prizes in
the contest, since this race was officially for
colleges and universities located in New Jersey and further north. But Swarthmore's
mouse registered a faster time than every

mouse officially entered in the contest.
The robots had to explore the maze, determine the fastest way through, and make a quick
trip from start to finish. Final scores were a
combination of the time each robot took on its
fastest run through the maze, plus a penalty for
time spent exploring. Unclear rules on how the
exploring penalty should be calculated made it
impossible to tell whether Swarthmore had
defeated Lafayette College, another Philadelphia school that was not officially eligible on
Saturday. Swarthmore's only obvious defeat
came against Mitee Mouse 3, which is one of
the world's fastest robotic mice.

Robots entered in Saturday's contest came
from Merrimac College, the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, and the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. Among the
entries was a mouse that played music as it
travelled through the maze; it got lost and
wandered about the maze playing the theme
song from "Mission Impossible." Andrew
Brown '97, Allison Marsh '9B, John Rieffel

"Several students have made formal complaints," said Fisher "These
changes were announced to senior
Honors students but...not to Junior
Honors students. We ought to be concerned about them, too; certainly we
have a right to be informed of any
significant changes!"
As a result of all the student complaints, the Curriculum Committee
first debated over whether to turn the
Honors grade from a B+ to an A-, but
the idea was scrubbed. As a compromise, the Committee has decided to
give Honors students grades of "H"
for Honors, "HH" for High Honors,
and "HHH" for Highest Honors, with
a description of what each denomination stands for written somewhere
else on the transcript. Rachel
Henighan '97, a student representative to the Committee, added that the
Curriculum Committee saw this as a
more appropriate way to grade senior
honors study than simply assigning
letter grades. As a result, a description as to the level of Honors a student receives, as well as the meaning of the evaluation marks, will
appear on the transcript along with
letter grade equivalents for Honors
marks. According to Henighan,
these grades should be the ones
which external examiners receive
when they evaluate students for the
honors exams.
However, before becoming official, the whole Honors change proposal will be discussed at length by
the faculty next week. At this meeting, the students who had expressed
anger and concern over the first draft
of the proposal, will be allowed to
provide input. Meanwhile, Honors
students still express doubts as to the
newly-revised program. "I think that
ifthe Honors program ceases to carry
some of the real earned prestige that
it has had in the past," said Fisher,
"and if it is inundated with folks who
want their transcript to look great for
post-graduate work, folks are going
to stop wanting to do the pretty
grueling work that being Honors
means."

Williams added that the Honors
system is supposed to be the college's
pride, and an accolade for students
who achieve it. Expressing disbelief
at the grade of B+ for an Honors
student, she said, "A B+ is an accolade? This is how the student is rewarded for his or herexcellent work?"
In addition, some feel thatthe Honors
program is losing its meaning, and
some students have even gone so far
as to drop out of the program completely. "I...just talked to three guys

She also reported that some students
feel others are doing Honors "not because they really want to learn seminar

These proposed changes in the
Honors program were made without
informing the Juniors in the program,
resulting in anger, confusion and concern about whatthe changes mean for
the Honors program itself. "I only

change spread around campus, a committee was formed, and numerous emails expressing anger over the situation were sent by Fisher and other

He concluded by suggesting that the world's

that they imperiled the checks and
balances system and suggested that a
final appeals body be brought in as a
final check on SC power. His proposal that CJC take on this role was
not accepted at that time.
Both Barney and Alloy emphasize
that Student Council was given full
responsibility by the administration
to oversee the use of SAF. Barney,
however, did assert that"for the most
part, BC are the ones who make the
decisions, and we don't plan to interfere with that." Rather, one of the
main aims of the amendment is to
give SC the authority to allocatefunds
in emergency situations. "If SC is
going to be relevant," Barney said,
"it must be able to act on...concerns
directly." He also mentioned that
because SC is more public than other
groups, "It would be very difficult for
SC to do anything extravagant."
Barney pointed out that in the past,
SC had been in charge of budgeting,
but that it had relegated this duty to
BC when it turned out to be "too

Student reactions to the panel discussion varied.
Ari Plost '9B, who organized the panel, said, "I
think it was a good constructive and informative
panel discussion, and it was very interesting to hear
different perspectives of the various panel
participants...justitbeing underdiscussion was great."
Other audience members were more critical.
Sarah Goldberg'OO thought that Klein, "instead of
representing the Israeli position in a positive light,
managed to alienate those members of the audience
with his emphatic and negative portrayal of Arabs."

much work." The move was made
given the knowledge that SC jurisdiction over BC would not be sacrificed. Jones, on the other hand, says
that, the College's controller was in
charge of SAF before the existence
of both BC and the current SC. In
1989,BC was created to handle budgeting for student groups. Only in
1994, when the current constitution
was written, did SC incorporate BC
into its body as a subcommittee.
Seaman thinks that the amendment was a direct result of BC's
decision to make substantial cuts to
the SC budget this year. "My feeling
is that this Amendment was created
because several Council members
who submitted a budget to BC felt
slighted in the budgeting process.
They would like to spend the
SAF...for their own purposes, to
serve their own goals." Even Barney
agreed that BC has been more "aggressive" than in previous years.
The amendments are due to be
voted on during next Thursday, April
24. A two-thirds majority is needed
to secure passage.

Matt Sosland '97, had a different opinion of
Klein, "I though that Mr. Klein presented arguments which I didn't expect to hear on this campus.
It was enlightening to hear his takes on Arafat and
his takes on the process."
Overall, according to Hajjar, the discussion was a
success, and more events like this one are in order.
She said, "I think the attendance at the event and the
interest which people showed indicates thatthe Swarthmore community should be bringing more people
who present a variety of views to campus."

Condemning Hate Speech on Campus
The most recent hate speech incident reminds us more than anything else
that hate speech is everyone's problem. Although hate speech is typically only
targeted at specific groups and persons, hate speech makes it impossible for
a real community to exist on this campus—we cannot have community if
there is not a basic level of understanding between each person on this
campus, and the hate speech incidents that have occurred this year seem to
have proven that there is not.
The report of the College Planning Committee TaskForce on Speech in the
Academic Community released last fall (and published in the November
1,1996 issueof The Phoenix) states, "To count as harassment, such expression

must be reasonably regarded as (a) taunting, vilifying or degrading whether

In order for speech to be adjudicable, according the report released by the

Time to Start Talking About All Aspects of Identity; Oppression Isn't Just About Black and White

Swiss Don't Provide the Answer For America

To the Editor:
Having come to Swarthmore because of its reputation for intelligent
discourse, I've always been excited
to see dialogue in The Phoenix such
as Vincent Jones' column and the
many responses it has incited, as well
as other letters from students addressing political and social issues salient
on this campus. Up until now, I've sat
back and read other people's contributions, content to let them speak for
me. But I realized the other day, while
reading Vincent's column, Mr.
Boykin's letter in response to letters
published March 27, and Eric
Freedman's comments on the position of straight white men in a diverse
society, that no one is speaking about
sexism. Time to start talking.
Time to start talking because I want
to know why Vincent sees nothing
wrong with confining his articles to
discussions of race, and race alone.
The intersections between race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, and the
myriad of other human characteristics cannot be ignored—AfricanAmerican women are not just African-American, they are also women.
Anyone who wants to fight for the
equality of one demographic group
must pay attention to the way other
groups are
oppressed and
marginalized. I understand that as a
black man, Vincent finds his greatest
passion in talking about racial issues,
but I am disturbed that this is to the
exclusion of issues such as sexism
and heterosexism. The lack of discussion in The Phoenix and in other
places on this campus about issues of
gender inequality makes me particularly nervous.
I wonder how much women's lives
have really changed. Certainly, more
women are in the paid work force in
higherpositions than everbefore. But
at what cost? Using studies done on
working men and women in the
1960's and 1970'5, Arlie Hochschild
found that women who worked a paying job workedroughly 15 hours more
than men. That adds up to an extra
month of workeach year. Hochschild
calls this work the "second shift." It's
the work women do at home, often
with little help from their husbands

To the Editor:
I would like to discuss Vincent
Jones' article "America Should Take
Swiss as Example." First, I would
like to consider Jones' claim that
"America would not enjoy such a
high standard of living hadit not been
for the toiling of African slaves on
this Continent." This is a powerful
soundingpiece of rhetoric, but I think
there is little reason to believe it. For
it to be true, we would have to attribute much of the present standard
ofliving in this country to the welfare
of the South, whose plantations held
most of the slaves. The South is anything but the nation's strongest economicregion. Also, I suspect that the
Civil War, quite arguably a cost of
slavery, undid most every advantage
slaves might have given to the New
World. I think we can much more
likely attribute America's high standard of living to an abundance of
natural resources per capita, a democratic government and a market
economy.
Returning the stolen money of
Holocaust survivors is also a very
different issue than making reparations to the grandchildren of slaves.
About 50 years ago, several Swiss
banks destroyed the bank records of
Jews and kept their money. In response to public pressure, the Swiss
government set up a fund into which
several Swiss banks have paid sums
in order to compensate the survivors
of the Holocaust for what they had
stolen. The Swiss government is not
just making everyone pay for past
inequities imposed on the Jews,
though it may choose, if it has not
already, to add to this fund.
Jones argues that every U.S. taxpayer is responsible for making reparations to the children of slaves for
wages their grandparents and generations previous to themshouldhave

or partners. Perhaps this has changed
greatly since the 70's. But I ask you,
before you assume things are totally
different now, who did the housework in your family?
The scary thing is that we can look
at much more recent data, and still
find huge disparities.In 1995, women
made up 46% of the employed labor
force. However, they made up 74.4%
of the textile, apparel, and furnishings machine operators. Textile and
apparel machine operators rarely receive medical or social benefits and
are among the lowest paid workers in
the country. These positions are also
predominantly filled by immigrants
who often lack the training and language skills to work elsewhere and
are given increasingly less help from
our government to get out of these
situations.This is just one example of
the connection between women' s and

minorities' struggles to gain economic
equality.
It never ceases to amaze me that so
many people assume welfare recipients, particularly single mothers, are
lazy and incompetent, given how
much these women have to do to
survive. Working minimum wageand
raising a kid by yourself is nearly
impossible. Where are these mothers
supposed to put their children while
they are working? How are they supposed to educate themselves when
they need to be working constantly
just to make it to the next check?
You may be wondering why I'm
ranting and raving about these injustices when everyone here has heard
them before. Why do I think it's so
important for enlightened, intelligent
Swarthmore students to think about
these facts more? Because sexism is
still tolerated in this society, even in
Swarthmore, in a way that racism is
not. In my life I have been called
"baby," "broad," "bitch," "whore,"
and other less pleasant expressions.
We have changed so much in the past
fifty years that it is completely unacceptable to use the n word, yet we
have not made this kind of progress
with sexist epithets. And when was
the last time you heard a sexist joke?
If the words had been changed so that
it was a racist joke, would it have

been tolerated?
Or look at a magazine. There we
see ads with Guess models straddling
buckets of popcorn and obnoxious
Sears ads that tell us women are only
interested in pretty clothing and jewelry and have no use for radial tires or
satellite disks. I certainly don't mean
to make this a tirade on men, either.
Some of the worst of these messages
are contained in women' s magazines,
even ones edited by women. Women
are told by the media to be thin,
passive sex objects. If we are not, we
won't get men and we will never be
happy. Women of color are given a
particularly bleak picture—if you
can't be white, you should at least be
as pale as possible. Heaven forbid
your hair or features should look
"Asian," "Latina," or "black." Look
at the women ofcolor in advertising:
Halle Berry, Daisy Fuentes, Naomi
Campbell. Only a narrow portion of
very European looking women of
color are considered beautiful.
Women are posed in submissive positions, working hard in theirkitchens, or stumped about what to do with
their messy husbands and families.
My point about the sexism in mainstream media is this: when was the
last time you saw an ad making a
joking reference to slavery? We
wouldn't tolerate it. Yet we continue
to accept these stereotyped images of
women in our lives every day.
I do not in any way mean to say that
people of color are not also stereotyped in the media. Anyone with two
eyes can see that (on those rare occasions) when people of color are represented in mainstream media, it is in
horrendously stereotyped roles. I also
do not want to state that any form of
oppression is more or less important
or painful than another. On the contrary, what I mean to say is that the
divisions of people and power in this
country cannot be looked at independently ofeach other. No one is simply
black or white or male or female. If
we were to attempt to define the White
America that Vincent tells us about
every week, we'd likely find that this
group is actually mostly a white,
straight, protestant, male America.
Not everyone in that demographic

Working Poor Need Attention
By

Vincent Jones

Declining wages, frequent
downsizing, and the gradual obliteration ofthe federal safety net has made
life difficultfor those living justabove
the poverty line. While the recent
changes to the decades old welfare
system created new problems for
those trying to escape poverty, other
changes in our society and economy
have made it severely unpleasant for
the nation's working poor.
Twelve years of Reaganomics in
the Reagan/Bush years did wonders
for the wealthiest Americans and
nothing for those with low incomes.
Nearly all ofthe economic gains during that period accrued to those in the
top tax bracket.
The Reagan administration championed the ability of supply-side economic theory to stimulate economic
growth for businesses, which, in turn,
would trickle down to the masses.
This manifested in increased corporate welfare in the form of reduced
capital gains taxes, more tax breaks,
and lucrative military contracts,
among other things.
We also shouldn't forget the millions acquired by a small percentage
of the country through S&L scandals
and junk bond schemes. The failure
of numerous savings and loans due
largely to questionable investing practices had profound economic repercussions. Thefederal government had
to pay out billions of dollars to people
who lost money in the federally insured S&Ls which resulted in an even
higher budget deficit. Nonetheless,
the few ring leaders of the scandal
profited heavily from the whole affair at the expense of the American
public.
At the same time, technological
and political changes made the world
into more of a global community.
Many American firms set up plants
and factories abroad to exploit the
cheaper labor costs and increase their
profit margin. Although such actions
can positively impact the economies
of many developing nations, they
negatively affect the wages ofAmerican workers.
The flight ofAmerican factories to
developing countries contributed to
higher unemployment and a general
stagnation in wage growth. Amidst

such tenuous economic conditions
and given the unfriendly political climate, labor unions and workers lost a
good amount of their bargaining
power.
All of these situations contributed
to a widening income gap. While
wealthy citizens enjoyed increased
profits from stocks, corporate salaries, and other fringe benefits, wages
for the rest of the country stopped
rising to reflect higher costs due to
inflation for first time in the post
WWII era. In other words, the rich
got richer and everyone else got
screwed.
Moreover many people joined the
ranks ofthe working poor.Their situation puts them in an interesting predicament. On the one hand, they earn
too much money to qualify for many
means-tested programs like AFDC.
On the other, they do not earn enough
income to adequately provide for their
basic needs—food, housing, health
care, education, etc.
To make matters worse, liberal/
progressive activists, the political
mainstream, and the right do not seem
to care about their woes. We don't
hear outcries from the public to ex-

pand the Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) which both Republicans and
Democrats laud as the most effective
anti-poverty measure. In fact, shortsighted Republicans attempted to
drastically cut the program during
the recent budget show-downs which
resulted in two government shutdowns.
Neither do we hear about any plans
to improve access to affordable health
care for those working, but still poor,
Americans. Under the old system,
welfare recipients lost their medical
coverage once they earned a certain
amount ofincome. This poses a great
problem since health care costs generally burden working poor families
the most.
Recent legislation granted workers the opportunity to keep their medical insurance when they get a new
job. However no efforts have been
made to expand access to health care
for people who work in companies
which do not offermedical insurance
and cannot afford to pay for it themselves.
In addition, working poor families
could benefit from assistance in pay-

ing for quality child care. This would
not be as much of a necessity if more
businesses realized the importance
of family and had on-site child care
facilities. Efforts should be made to
encourage such initiatives through
tax credits or other incentives and
inducements. Reduced child care
costs could significantly enhance the
ability of working poor families to
move up the socio-economic ladder.
While the Clinton administration
has made many proposals to make
higher education more affordable,
many of his initiatives have been
targeted towards the middle class.
Although middle class Americans
deserve assistance in sending their
children to college, the working poor
could more easily escape poverty with
targeted help. Workers at various
firms can have their educational expenses paid for by the company but
many working poor individuals don't
have this opportunity.
Conservatives shouldn't have a
problem with helping these people
since they are working. They tend to
blame the problems of non-working
poor people on themselves. If anything,Republicans and conservatives
should applaud the working poor for
their personal responsibility and integrity. However I don'tforesee this
happening in the near future.
Unfortunately, progressive activists tend to devote a great deal of their
energy trying to reinstate welfare in
an adversarial political environment.
Since most current welfare recipients
will be thrust into the class of working poor Americans given the nature
ofthe changes in federal entitlements,
efforts to alleviate obstacles for this
groupwould yield more positive outcomes than the current agenda.
Americans of all political persuasions need to realize the plight of
working poor families. This group
can claim very few government programs, tax breaks, etc., designed to
benefit them. However, poor, middle
class, and wealthy citizens can list
several initiatives targeted towards
them. If this problem continues to
fester without adequate attention,
America will be a nation of rich and
poor with no true middle class. This
situation only leads to one thing—class warfare. Is this your vision for
our country?

group is rich or powerful. And hot
everyone in that group is apathetic.
So what, as Swatties in one of the
more gender-equal and generally tolerant places in this country, can we
do? The obvious first step is using
our votes. Use this power to get legislators who youbelieve in intopower.
Pay more attention in our classes to
who talks. If your experience has
been anything like mine, it is probably more often the white male students who do the talking. If you rarely
talk in class, speak up! If you are
always talking, sit back and let others
talk. When you hear sexist jokes,
don't laugh. Boycott products that
have advertising that degrades women
and other marginalized groups. Sure,
these are small steps, but they're important in the way that they contribute to our subconscious attitudes towards groups of people. Finally, take
a women's studies course, or a black
studies course, or a Chinese history
class or a Latin American politics
class. Encourage your department to
offer thesekinds ofclasses and to add
diverse curriculum to all of their
classes. Learn something from a different point of view than the media
and most primary education assume
we're all coming from.

College's Investments
in Fast Food Are
Fully

Defensible

To the Editor:
I was greatly traumatized to learn
that some people want the College to
divest in McDonald's on the grounds
that this great corporate butcher contributes to high cholesterol, landfills,
and other alleged misdeeds. The College investment in McDonald's is
perhaps the most socially responsible
and efficient investment ever made
by an institution of higher education.
To understand why all colleges and
universities shouldinvest in fast-food,
just look at the main people who eat
there hungry teenagers and suburban families. Each time a hungry
teenager buys a nasty value meal
(and supersizes it) at McDonald's,
this individual contributes to Swarthmore College's endowment.
A teenager is doing more than buying a burger, she is investing in her
future; lowering the cost of higher
education; and making America better and brighter. Burger consumption
is a voluntary tax for higher education. It only seems fair that teenagers
and their families should contribute
to their education.
Is there a more delightful way to
pay this cost than munching on a
high-cholesterol patty? Rather than
screw-up an efficient and equitable
relationship by forcing a very successful firm to modify its behaviour,
we should encourage all institutions
to follow our path, and remember, the
only social value of a greasy burger is
a happy customer and lower tuition
rates.

received. Since the slaves were freed,
millions of immigrants have come to
the US, many from the basest conditions. Should they too be responsible
for paying these past wages, particularly when they may have reaped no
benefit? Reparations are a way of
both compensating victims and making people responsible for their actions. They should not be a way of
making some people responsible for
the actions of other people who are
long dead. Jones could argue with
equal validity that we should hand
this country back to the natives and
pay everyone's boat-fare back to their
country of origin.
Finally, as Jones desired, there already is a multi-billion dollar fund
that includes Medicare and Welfare
which disproportionately benefits
Blacks, since they are a disproportionate fraction of the poor. Furthermore, affirmative action and college
loan programs have a cash value,
though those figures would be hard to
determine.
These funds and programs have
been around quite a while without
appearing to have remedied racial
inequity too significantly. I suggest
that Vincent Jones abandonshis factfamished rhetoric and look to the
future and not the past when suggesting how and why the government
should work towards achieving racial equity. As a reason "why," I offer
thatracial equity is a good thing and
that it is right to tax those who benefit
from economic inequity accordingly.
As a way "how," I start by suggesting
new actions such as legalizing drugs
and privatizing public schools while
providing vouchers
things that
will get both thugs and police off the
streets and kids educated, without
depending on government to do the
job right.

Consensual Relations Document Process Defended
To the Editor
I am writing in response to the
March 25 article entitled "Faculty to
Vote on Consensual Relations." As
the Chair of the Equal Opportunity
Advisory Committee, I would like to
clarify the facts regarding a few issues that were raised.
First, I would like to outline the
procedure we attempted to follow in
order to obtain opinions from the
entire community. The EOAC has
been working on the draftpolicy since
last semester. When the draft was far
enough along that we were comfortable that it was a reasonable representation of our thinking, but certainly not finalized, we sent advance
courtesy copies to the President's
Office, Provost's Office, Dean's Office, Office of Human Resources,
Student Council, Student Life Committee, and Daily Gazette. We requested preliminary opinions from
these groups and offices as a courtesy, and as a first check that our draft
did not have a serious problem that
we had not noticed (but that might be
obvious to someone who had not
worked on the text as long as we all

had). After these groups had an opportunity to respond, we planned to
solicit opinions from the entire community. We were already working
with the Weekly News, and were also
considering other campus publications to which we might send the

policy. Additionally, we were planning for discussions with those in the
community who were interested.
On page two, the Phoenix article

stated that "It was originally intended
that Student Council would solicit
opinions from the student body about
this policy." This is not the case.
Student Council members were asked
only to read the policy and comment
on it themselves, as described above.
They did give us useful preliminary
feedback, which we brought to the
faculty meeting when the faculty began its discussion.
I am personally saddened by some
ofthe statements that were made about
the leaders ofStudent Council. All of
the SC members with whom I have
dealt have been thoughtful, responsible, and conscientious.

Action Instead of Immaturity
By

Janine Gent

At the debate on Wednesday, April

9,1 wanted to hear what Robert Rector and Wendell Primus had to say
about welfare reform. Recently, a
close friend of mine was diagnosed
with a serious congenital defect that
requires major surgery. Unfortunately, my friend is a legal immigrant. Even though his family has
paid taxes to the federal government
for the last 18 years and he has been
doing so individually for the last 7
years, he would not be eligible for
any federal assistance during his operation and recovery timebecause of
his status as a legal noncitizen of the
United States. He would lie in a hospital bed disabled for a minimum of
six weeks not receiving any pay and
would be ineligible for any unemployment or disability. His family's
survival depends on his income,
which would be nonexistent. He
wouldbe left homeless since he could
not pay the rent. I wanted to hearhow
Rector could justify this injustice. I
wanted to know how the welfare reform would impact my friend's scenario, as well as that of my family
members who have immigrated to
this country legally. But I couldn't.
The people sitting near me took it
upon themselves to groan, and laugh
at Rector as he spoke, to express their
disgust with his arguments. They
didn't even give me a chance to hear

what these arguments were half of
the time. If Rector's arguments were
illogical and racist, I'd like to ask
those who took it upon themselves to
groan and laugh out loud at his comments to instead go up to the microphone and ask him an intelligent question which wouldreveal the flaws in
his argument (which many Swatties
did so eloquently, when I could hear
them). Please let the stupidity or rationality of the speaker's opinions
speak for themselves.
I cannot help but recall Sarah
Weddington's visit. At this lecture, I
specifically remember members of
the organization Swarthmore Students Advocating Life being at the
lecture. They passed out papers describing their position. They did not
heckle or interrupt Ms. Weddington
as she spoke. These anti-abortion
advocates consider abortion the termination of human life. You might
expect those "radical right-wing
Christian Fundamentalists" to rudely
interrupt Ms. Weddington. They did
not. Their behavior was a sign of
strength and maturity in my eyes.
I wish the handful of student audience members at the Welfare debate
would have followed suit. I understand they feel passionately about
this issue as do I and believe that
effects of the reform will result in
tragedy.
Please, at the next debate, don't
shut up and be passive. Be aggres-

sive. Ask questions which reveal se-

rious flaws in the debater's argument. Help convince the audience
that one way is better than the other—through facts and passion—not
through immature mockery that only
implies that you cannot substantiate
your opinion withregard to the issue.
Also, thank you to those ofyou that
did force Rector to address his shallow argument against the federal assistance to legal aliens. If anyone was
able to hear over the heckling, he did
seem to waver and acknowledge his
lack of substantial fact and statistics
to back up his argument. To those of
you who were so proud of yourselves
for belittling Rector, who don't feel
any need to show him any respect
because ofhis views, good for you. I
hope you feel good about yourselves,
ill tough and righteous. By the way,
my friend and my family members
are still up shit creek without a paddle
while you and Rector were having a
battle of inflated egos in this ivory
tower we call Swarthmore College.
If you care so much, next time be
respectful of the audience and show
your intelligence and maturityby asking good questions. Like you, people
in the audience, including myself,
care too and would like to hear what
people have to say because for some
of us this is real life and not just
another little Swattie political discussion where we can prove how
witty we are.

PHIL To Hold World Debut Concert Tomorrow

Says...

Move

Your
Sharples
Butt

I've

had a lot of difficulty deciding
what to write about this week because
I' ve been given two excellent ideas by

my friends.
First, if you had to choose a Smurf as a
lifetime companion, which one would
you choose? Brainy, that pretentious snot,
is obviously out. Hefty is buff but not too
bright. Greedy has too many issues. Papa
Smurfis a bit too mature and Smurfette is
a nit. That just leaves Handy, but he's a
workaholic and would have little timefor
you. This topic's going to take a lot of
soul searching and introspection, I can
see.
The other idea given to me centered
around the stupid things that people do in
Sharpies. And while I know that this is a
subject that hasbeen discussedmany times
before, justlike fire safety, I don't believe
it can be overly emphasized. And, after
all, the Smurf topic is a very personal
matter for which you probably need some
timefor rumination.
Let's begin withthe beginning-the card
checker stations. Have your ID card out
and ready and waiting before you reach
the nice Sharpies checker ladies. I don't
want to stand behind you and watch as
you grope each of your orifices in search
of your card.
Now, on to the tray servery. The key to
this area is smooth, efficient movements.
Get your tray, choose your silverware,
grab some napkins and go. Do not stand
there with your hand in the spoon receptacle, discussing the mating practices of
the gentle manatee withyour friends. The
people behind you in line are hungry and
grumpy, and wouldrather eat the gentle
manatee alive than listen to you wax poetic about it. Move along.
Don't pick through the stir fry and hork
all the broccoli.
If there is a large crowd at the condiment bar, don'tspread your cream cheese
on your bagel while at the bar. I understand that Swatties are, by definition,
obsessive compulsive, and need exact
and uniform application of their condiments. So take a dollop of your favorite
condiment and spread that quarter inch
thick layer of peanut butter in the cozy
comfort of the Small Room. Heck, use a
ruler and a protractor if you need to, just
don't spread your toppings while a murderous mob at the bar plots your untimely
demise behind you. If you're worried
you're not going to have enough for a
proper thickness, take abig dollop. You're
paying $28.75 for this wonderful meal
anyway, you might as well get your
money's worth.
The beverage bar, though, is a completely different story. It's each man for
himself when you're getting your ice.
There is no honor amongst theravenously
thirsty, and the meek will not be allowed
to survive. Even the slightest moment of
hesitation can cost you your place under
the Hi-C Pink Lemonade tap, so be aggressive in your quest for liquid refreshment.

If you're

not strong enough to scoop
your own ice cream, you shouldn't be
there eating it anyway. You should be at
the gymeither forming some muscle tone

for yourself or making friends with those
who already have itand would be willing
to scoop the very tasty ice cream treats for
you.
When choosing a seat in the Big Room,
don't stand in that small channel between
those front tables and the beverage bar as
you survey your domain. A traffic jam
will quickly form behind you and you will
invariably end up with a bowl of tapioca
adhered to your butt.
Finish your meal before you bring your
tray to the conveyer belt. It will be much
easier for the volunteer firemen to perform the Heimlich maneuver on you as
you choke on your food at your table than
ifthey have to fight through the throng to
get you at the conveyer belt. And they
might be mad enough at you for holding
up the line that they won't try to save you
anyway.
If you believe that you are making a
political statement by refusing to arrange
your tray with the tumblers to the left and
the silverware to the right, then, darn it,
hold your ground. Don't get up to the
conveyer belt and buckle into peer pressure then. If you're going to arrange your
tray, though, do it before you leave your
table to cut down on the congestion.
But most importantly, remember to have
fun. Now, go play in the street.

"We want everyone to know that there is

life after Booty," says Matt Neal '9B, bassist
for the new 4-man musical phenomenon
PHIL, which will be making its World Debut
Saturday at 3 p.m. on MertzLawn (if it rains,
they'll play in Mephistos). "The campus musical scene was alive last year, but this year
there hasn't been much." PHIL seeks to
change that, and, if the energy they showed
during the rehearsal I attended was any indication, they might just succeed.
The core of PHIL is made up of Jeremy
Taylor 98 and Jonathan Hauze '9B. Taylor is
the lead vocalistand saxophoneplayer, Hauze
also sings and plays guitar. Rounding out the
ensemble is TopherLeinberger'oo on drums.
I got the special opportunity this week to
see and hear the work in progress. PHIL's 11song set is comprised of totally original material and is very eclectic, ranging from a
classicrock sound to hard-edge alternative to
jazz, sometimesall in the same song. In fact,
the band seems to thrive on eclecticism, and
*

refuses to try to define their works, instead
inviting the audience to decide for themselves.
The band's songs are contemplative and

interesting, most with heavy jazz influences
(Neal, Taylor and Hauze all play in Jazz
Band). Some of the longer, more challenging
works, like their epic "TheLeave Of Peace,"
are multi-part songs that are quite ambitious.
The band's more whimsical moments are
also some ofits best, like "Sunday Morning,"
in which there's a repeating figure where the
instruments tacetmomentarily, and then slam
back in.
The instrumental performances are great,
especially Neal jamming away on the bass.

In some songs, it seems like he's in a different
band. Topher's drumming is thoroughly entertaining and energetic. The band was so
musically enthusiastic that while I was listening it was hard to make out the vocals, not
because they weren't sung with equal enthusiasm, but because the instrumental parts
pushed the hellish acoustics of Olde Club to
the limit.
The band seems well-suited to perform in

spiffy." Of course,
after hearing them,
I'm sure you'll
think they're a singular entertainment
entity.
Although the
band obviously
wanted their work
to speak for itself, I
got them to open up
a little. Taylor offered the story of
how the idea was
born. "I was sitting
around playing
computer games
one night, and
Jonathan came in
and said, 'We have
to write a song.' We
did, and lots of
people thought it
was catchy." It has
taken several semesters for their inspiration to become
reality, but their

performance.
As with any kind of music, it is best to
wide-open spaces for lots of people, and,
indeed, the band invites everyone to come discover for yourself, and in the case of PHIL
and have fun. As Neal notes, "Whether you there's more than enough types of music

From the Minds of Swatties: Night of Scenes
Student-written, studentdirected, student-acted
plays go up in Paces, of all
places
By

Jessica Harbour

This

was no ordinary Night of Scenes.
Students packed Paces on Thursday
night to watch a presentation of scenes
written, directed, acted, and produced by
students, all underthe auspices ofRoadMark,
the new student group given to evaluating
and producing original dramas.
First up was the first part of "Cushioned,"
a Swarthmore-set drama of intrigue written
by RoadMark's founder, Dan Gallant '9B.
The action revolves around Lauren (Leigh
Nolan '00) getting Tommy (Seth Olshfski
'00) to take her shift at the Tarble gameroom.
But why? And what's going on between
Lauren and her boyfriend Rob (Jacob Hartog
'00)? And why does his roommate Phil (Aaron
Hoffman '9B) hate Lauren so much? And
what's with the song-writing contest?
Before the answers came, the lights went
down and came back up on an entirely different work: "Spoon River Monologues," by
Andrew Bryce 'OO. Inhabitants of the fictional town of Spoon River stepped forward
to tell their individual stories, vividly played
by Hoffman, Olshfski, and Cathy Muller 'OO.
A watchman spoke ofhis fascination withthe
turning of the cogs; a man vented his bitterness against the town he felt didn't understand him.

For the third scene, first-year Suellen Lee's.
"No Win, No Lose," the audience's attention
returned to the Tarble game room, where
Devina (Nancy Benson-Nicol '9B), Brenna
(Jocelyn Kea '00), and Jon (Olshfski) engaged in a debate over whetherthere has to be
winners and losers in life. Devina, a would-be
art major whose parents are pressuring her to
go pre-med, butts heads with cynical Jon and
then finds herself breaking down under the
strain.
The first half of the show closed out with a
film noir spoof, appropriately titled "Film
Noir,"written by Ben Wurgaft '00; the
audience's laughter could be heard through

"I really feel honored and
lucky that people would
want to say lines that I
wrote. It's a wonderful
compliment."
—lsaac Reed 'OO
Paces' open windows. Nolan played the AilAmerican Sam Spade, .45 in hand, who goes
after the destructive forces of postmodernism
and Communism, as represented by The Conspirator Guy (Hartog) and literary critic
Mamie Beale (Muller). Intermission arrived
just in time to let the ensemble cast catch its
collective breath.
The second half of the show contained the
second parts of "Cushioned" and "Spoon
River," as well as the much-anticipated opus

Restaurant Review

of Isaac Reed 'OO, "In Search of a Plot, or The
Poisoning of Cliche Guy." Cliche Guy himself (Hartog) can speak nothing but, but the
Joisey-accented Bad Guy (Hoffman), the
Good Looking Female existing for no other
reason than to shake it (Claire Farel '97), the
man ofLove (Olshfski) and the only member
of the motley crew who actually wanted to be
in a play (Kea) aren't doing much better until
the box ofbananas comes along... The second
half of"Spoon River" dealtwith perceptions
of deathand art, while "Cushioned" finished
with a bang—or, rather, a veggie calzone,
hand delivered by the sinister Quipic (Rafael
Luna '00) and his actress girlfriend Tara
(Farel).
Afterwards, all the writer-directors seemed
pleased at how the performance had gone. "I
am stunned by my actors," declared Bryce.
"They are just so incredible." Gallant spoke
of the various challenges the group had en-

countered: actors having to learn lines for
several scenes at once; thepressure of putting
on a full production after only three weeks of
rehearsal; and Paces itself. "Paces isn't often
used for theatrical things," he explained, "so
we had to figure out a way to use it. It ended
up feeling like an off-Broadway performance."Stage managerand RoadMark member Sarah Scheckter 'OO was also pleased by
the results: "This was always the goal of
Road Mark, not just to read student dramabut
to get it out there. ..hopefully we can get it out
every year."
For Reed, the biggest thrill lay in seeing his
own scene performed. "I really feel honored
and lucky that people would want to say what
I wrote. It's a wonderful compliment."
The performance will be repeated tonight
at 8:30p.m. Be warned: attendance was standing room only at the first performance, with
some people being turned away at the door.

Swat parties are good, and there's usually one or two every
weekend. But have you noticed they sometimes seem pretty
redundant? Same kind of music, same kind of dancing. Now, we
have no problem with this, because we think it's pretty fun.
But, if you're looking for something different...

According to President Bloom, it

a road through which North Korea

On the whole, the trip was a success. The group sealed a tentative

agreement, severalNorthKorean professors would spend a week at both
Swarthmore and Guilford Colleges.
The NorthKoreans also accepted an

Two seemingly diametrically
opposed concepts. Butthrough
channels established by the American Friends Service Committee
(AFSC), since several years ago, the
College has been provided the opportunity to step outside of the bounds of
academia for a change.
As part of AFSC's efforts to develop friendly ties between the people
of the US and North Korea, Swarthmore participated in a series of educational exchanges with one of the
most isolated countries in the world,
beginning with a campus visit by a
non-governmental delegation in the
fall of 1995.
AFSC has had a long history of
promoting development in Asia. The
organization's involvement in the
Korean peninsula dates back to 1953,
when they offered aid to both North
and South Korea after the Korean
War. In the end, the latter—but not
the former—accepted the offer. However, the Quakers eventually gained
ground in the late 70s, when a representative ofthe organization successfully contacted the North Korean
United Nations delegation.
Their efforts paid off as AFSC
members were rewarded with an invitation to visitNorthKorea in 1980.
From that point onwards, an article
by the Greensboro News & Record
published last year—regarding
Guilford College President Don
McNemar's participation in theAFSC

group, led by Mr. Ho Sop, chairman
of the committee, met with a range of
organizations in New York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Seattle. Also on their itinerary was a
stop at Swarthmore, which featured a
open discussion between the visitors
and students and other members of
the community. Sop and his colleagues also met with faculty and
staff over lunch. At the conclusion of
their visit, Sop issued an invitation
for a reciprocal visit.
After further planning by the two
sides, it was decided that a small
delegation of representatives from
several Quaker educational institutions in the US, including Swarthmore, would partake in the visit
during the week of August 10th last
year. The party includedPresident Al
Bloom, McNemar, Kay Edstein,
AFSC Administrator for Asian Affairs, as well as Ed Reed, head of the
AFSC office in Kobe, Japan. According to President Bloom, the main
aim of the visit was to "move beyond
general links to a link between North
Korea and the US in educational areas." One of the goals of the visit was
to establish a faculty exchange programwith local universities. The delegation mainly focused on visiting
academic institutions, most notably
the Juche Institute, which is in charge
of many aspects of the nation's education curriculum.
The visitalso came while the country was suffering fromits worst famines in history, and when foreign
countries, lead by the US, were seeking ways to engage North Korea —in
the hope ofresolving ongoing NorthSouth tensions—and at the same time
help alleviate the food-shortage situation there. Although the trip was not

invitation to visit Swarthmore from
President Bloom.
The Greensboro News & Record
mentions how President McNemar
of Guilford was somewhat surprised
by the level of enthusiasm the North
Koreans showed towards the proposed exchange program. Despite its
committment to Juche philosophy,
remarked Bloom, "there was a wonderful openness among teachers, students and administrators to developing relationships with the West and
to open and candid conversation at a
level far beyond what I had expected
to find."
But things took an unexpected turn
this February—a month before the
North Korean delegation was scheduled to make its recipricoal visit
when North Korean official Hwang
Jong Yop, also one of the country's
top theorists of Juche ideology, defected to the South Korean Embassy
in Beijing. Mr. Hwang was the immediate boss of the official at the
Juche Institute who met with the delegation during their summer visit.
The latter was also the head of the
visiting delegation. The College, in
conjunction with AFSC, had already
been making arrangements for the
upcoming visit; Ms. Edstein, the

made recently in getting NorthKorea
involved in four-party talks —along
with the US, South Korea and
China —to negotiate a peace treaty,
putting an official end to the Korean
War, which ended in 1953 with only
an armistice. Bloom also mentioned
the fact that the North Korean government had apologized for the submarine incident last fall—in which
North Korean submarines entered
South Korean waters—and agreed to
store hazardous nuclear waste forTaiwan.
And recent developments certainly
lean in favor of President Bloom's
statement. High-level talks are being
held between the US and North Korea this week. Despite the latter's
insistence on linking further aid to its
participation in talks on the peace
treaty, it has already promised to discuss issues concerning missile development with the US and South Korea, according to a New York Times

In

Adventures In Babysitting,
Elisabeth Shue plays Chris, the
ill-fated baby-sitter who innocently accepts a babysitting job one
Friday afternoon for two kids (Keith
Coogan and Maiaßrewton). The boy,
a typical adolescent, has a big crush
on Chris, and the girl, a whiny little
ten-year-old imp, runs around the
house in a Viking hat. The afternoon
is dull until Chris receives a pleading
call for rescue from her friendBrenda,
stuck in the middle of a downtown
Chicago bus-station...without a car, a
wallet or her glasses. Chris has no
choice but to take the kids, and the
boy's friend, into the city on a field
trip that goes drastically awry. After
they blow a tire and run into some
intimidating truckers, it's all downhill from there. An encounter with
the mob...crawling across six-inch
wide steel rafters fifty feet above the
ground...singing "The Babysitter

let your brain relax, go see Adventures, because you're not going to get
a second chance Saturday night.
Saturday night, as it turns out, is for
thosewho love the romantic, the epic,
and the tragic. The English Patient, a
beautifully filmed adaptation of the
recent much-praised novel, recently
won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.
The English Patient is really two
intertwined stories, one told in the
flashbacks of a World War II patient
burned beyond recognition as he lies
dying in an Italian monastery in the
aftermath of the war. A compassionate nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche),
decides to stay on alone to take care
of him. As both struggle to accept the
horrible events that have come to
pass, they reach a mutual understanding about each other's pain. Meanwhile, two important visitors come to
the monastery: amaimed thief named
Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) and a
young Indian bomb diffuser named
Kip (Naveen Andrews). As the story
unfolds, the flashbacks tell of a beautiful woman, Catherine(Kristen Scott
Thomas), her husband, an English

lieutenant (Colin Firth), and an arrogant and enigmatic land surveyor
(Ralph Fiennes), who wreaks havoc
on both their lives. This intricate story
moves from the sweeping sand dunes
of the Sahara to the bustling intrigue
of Cairo, leaving the viewer awed by
its beauty and tragedy.
The acting is superb, the directing
is amazing, the scenery is breathtaking, and the story is original and masterfully well-crafted. From the opening scenes, the film grabs the viewers' attention and continues till the
end with incredible and unrelenting
intensity. The three leads give incredible depth and emotion to their
characters and the story as a whole:
Scott Thomas shines as the sophisticated, worldly, conflicted Catherine,
Fiennes evokes the conflicts and loyalties of his character, and Binoche
symbolizes the pain that war and lost
love can bring. The director, Anthony Minghella, captures the allure
and mystery of Michael Ondaatje's
poetic novel, and, more importantly,
he ties all of the story elements together in a wonderfully satisfying
and elegant way.

In the end, the North Korean government also took a reconciliatory
stance towards the defection. In a
radio address soon after the incident,
NorthKorean leaderKim Jong II said
that the country did not need cowards. It was announced last month
that Hwang would leave China for
South Korea through a third country.
It is AFSC s beliefthat "unofficial,
people-to-people contacts between
individuals from North Korea and
the United States will increase understanding between the two countries,
reduce the risk of conflict, and create
a positive environment for the success of official negotiations now underway bewteen the two governments." Judging from the current situation, this has more or less been
proven true. And Swarthmore has
played no small role in realizing such
a vision.
Bloom observed that "Pyongyang
was a surprisingly elegant, modern,
monumental city." Perhaps it is gratifying to know that a small college
likeSwarthmore has indirectly helped
to keep it that way and to bring closer
the day that we can all admire the
beauty of Pyongyang for ourselves.

On the day the group was scheduled to arrive on campus, AFSC received a message from the North
Koreans saying that they would not
be able to make the trip as expected.
No reasons were supplied for thelastminute cancellation.
President Bloom emphasized that
the decision may not have been a
direct a result of the defection, although he did not exclude such a
possibility. He suggested several
other possible decisions behind the
move. "It could be that since things
are in turmoil, they decided to hold
back a bit." Bloom also mentioned
the fact that two other delegations
were also in the US then, suggesting
that that may have been "too much at
one given time."
The delegation was invited to come
again at a future date, but it has yet to
reply to the invitation.
However, Bloom does not consider
the incident a setback. "The impression is that the general forward momentum that our visits were part of

Bryn Mawr Fights to the End while
American University Falls Down Dead
By

Amber

Halsey

On Saturday, the Swarthmore
women's rugby team faced two
skilled teams and managed to extend
their undefeatedrecord. In the first of
three A-side games played that day,
Swarthmore met their arch rivals, the
Bryn Mawr Mawrters and tied them
0-0. In the second match, Bryn Mawr
faced American University and fared
better in this match, defeating A.U.
with a score of 7-5. In the third game,
the women ruggers crushed American University in a shut out game,
resulting in a score of 22-0. The Bside squad subsequently played A.U.
and tied them 0-0.
The score of the first game against
Bryn Mawr does not reflect the skill
with which the Swarthmore team
played against their ferocious opponents. While neither team managed
to score, the entire game was played
on the Mawrters' defensive side; in
addition, the last 20 minutes of the
gamewas played withinten meters of
their try zone. Becky Snyder '9B and
Sarah Cross '99, who both play at the
prop positions, arduously fought to
drive the ball into the try zone and in

addition, continued to display their
talents in evading the tackles of their
opponents with their perfected

"straight-arm" technique. Bridget
Arbour '9B and Alexa Miller 'OO aggressively struggled to place the ball
on the ground after the forward pack
repeatedly drove it into the try zone.
The intensity of the forwards was
equally matched by the back line who

day and kept them in the game. Holly
Baker, Googins and Betsy
Rosenbaum '9B each found the back
of the net twice. Kristen Osborne '97
and Ernst each scored one. Defense
women Sam Peltz '97, Kelly Wilcox
'97 and Singleton played excellent,
tight defense, especially on clears
from the opposing goalie, often leaving the keeper to walk up the field
withthe ball having no one to pass to.
Jane Kendall 'OO and Kate Doty 'OO
also played well with three and six
saves respectively.
The team then hit the road again on
Tuesday to travel to Muhlenberg. The
Garnet walked away with a 14-11
win. Rosenbaum was the leading
scorer for the Muhlenberg game with
four goals. Baker followed with three.
Ernst, Googins and Starita each had
two and Osborne one. The
Swarthmore goalies both had a great

day in goal and made 14 saves total.
The team traveled to Rowan College yesterday for a non-Conference
contest. Its next game is on Saturday

skillfully stole the ball from Bryn
Mawr throughout the game. Giovana
Giuliani '97 made some exceptional
tackles on Mawrters that were twice
her size. Beth Vose '99 broke through
the defense of the opponents several
times during the first gameand overwhelmed the other team with her
speed as well as her strength.
In the second game, however, the
Swarthmore women ruggers focused
their frustration from the Bryn Mawr
game on the defenseless American
team, scoring four tries and a conversion kick. The first try was scored by
Miller, who, with the aid of Arbour,
carried the ball into the try zone and
maneuvered it to the ground. Courtney
Clark '9B scored the second try of the
game, after speedily running the ball
single-handedly through a hole in the
opposition's defense. While this effort was Clark's first time at scoring
in an A-side game, she executed the
tactic like a veteran. The third try was
scored by senior captain Andrea
Barnett, who not only shepherded the
A.U. squad into the try zone in order
to score, but fulfilled a self-proclaimed prediction to Brennan who
later successfully kicked a conversion, adding two more points for her
team. The final try was scored by
Amber Halsey '9B close to the end.
Overall, Swat played beautifully
throughout their entire second game.
Joan Hoffman '9B played a strong

Winning Big against West
Chester to Send off Seniors
By George Matula

Oneof the West Chester Warlords'
strongest hitters, a future Olympian
approached a high, lofty set wide on
his strong side. He jumped high into
the airand slams the ball hard into the
waiting arms of one Imran Posner
'OO. Blocked and disgraced, the hitter
realized what a great team he was
facing on that fateful spring night.
Last Tuesday the Swarthmore
men's club volleyball team faced a
powerhouse in the Centennial Conference, second place West Chester
University. They were defeated only
once prior to playing in Tarble Pavil-

game and they were excited to play
them.

Prior to the game the team was
looking forward to the big task ahead.

Nate Schaffran 'OO. They knew that
their low standing in the conference
would not change with a win but they
wanted to give the two seniors on the
team, Kevin Koo '97 and Matt
Sosland '97, a good send off and a
positive memory of their volleyball
careers at Swarthmore.
The game started with an emo-

tional Swarthmore team taking the
early lead. Their passing was good,
which was a change from prior
matches. In addition, other aspects of
their game were in sync. They were
generally aggressive going after every ball. This is another trait that they
lacked in previous matches. Sparked
by some excellent jump serves by
George Matula '9B and by some
tenacious defense by Paul Hsu '9B,
the team won the first set 15-8.
The second set proved to be no
different. The team was consistent in

all areas of the game. At times they
were tentative, but they pulled through
following some strong leadership
from strong-side hitter Koo. The
Garnet Gastroenterologists won the
second set 15-12.
However, the third and fourth sets
were a different story. The team
seemed to have lost confidence in
their abilities and played passively.
West Chester sensed this and climbed
all over Swarthmore. Their hitting
power seemed to increase as they
became more aggressive and took the
third and fourth sets easily.
Determined not to spoil the seniors' last game, the Swat team came
out oftheirhuddle with a competitive
fire in their eyes. There was no doubt
about it. Fueled by some excellent
serving from Charles Ellis 'OO and
some great defense the team pulled
out an emotional win 15-8.

Baseball’s Baptism by Fire
By

Frank Amar

The light at the end of the Garnet
Tide's tunnel has turned out to be a
runaway freight train, rather than a
ray of sunshine. After several weeks
of improved, if not totally successful, baseball, the Garnet Tide has
regressed. Since the last printing,
the Garnet Tide has dropped four
more games and nine in a row overall. Despite the mounting losses, the
team has yet to throw in the towel,
remaining confident that they can
notch a few more wins in order to
salvage the season.
Last Friday, the Garnet Tide traveled to Franklin & Marshall to complete the season series. TheTide was
looking to build on the positives
from Tuesday's game, while the
Diplomats were looking to defeat a
team it felt had no business taking
themto extra innings. Jeremy Bonder
'97 absorbed much of F & M's offensive explosion, surrendering 19
runs and 17 hits. However, the Garnet Tide defense-which has played
very well at times this year-totally
collapsed, committing 8 errors. All
told, the Diplomats rapped out 20
hits en route to an easy 20-2 victory.
The lone bright spots for the Garnet
Tide was the hitting of Carlo Fitti
'OO (3-5, 2 doubles, rbi) and Josh
Roth '99 (3-4).
Inclement weather postponed
Western Maryland's arrival until

Sunday afternoon. In game 1, the
GarnetTide jumped out to an early 20 lead. Joe Aleffi *OO led off with a
single and then moved to third on a
one out single by Pat Straub '97 (23). A balk scored Aleffi from third
and moved Straub to second, where
he would score on a base hit from
Fitti. The GreenTerrors plated single
runs in the 4th and sth to tie the score.
In the bottom of the sixth, Rufus
Frazer '99 led off with a single. He
promptly advanced to third base by
way of a wild pitch and a stolen base.
Roth's one-out double plated Frazer,
giving the Tide a 3-2 lead.
Unfortunately, the seventh inning
brought heartbreak once again. Two
critical errors lead to the tying and
eventual game winning runs. The result was a 4-3 defeat, wasting a superior effort from starter Steve Farneth
'OO (7IP, 4H, 4R, OER, 188, 6K).
Just like the previous week against
Johns Hopkins, Game 2 lacked the
compelling drama of Game 1. The
Tide held a 3-2 lead going into the 6th
inning, but the Green Terrors ended
the suspense, scoring nine runs in the
final two frames to post an 11-3 victory.
Tuesday afternoon, Muhlenberg
played host to the Garnet Tide in
Allentown at Cedar Creek Field. The
two teams had a wild season series
last year, with Swathmore winning at
home 20-16 and Muhlenberg triumphing in Allentown 12-9. Neither

team's pitching has been up to snuff
this season, and the offenses from
both teams took full advantage. The
Garnet Tide plated four runs in the
first two innings, and it looked like
the rout was on. The Mules, not to
outdone, threw up a seven spot in the
bottom of the second. The resilient
Tide added three more in the third to
tie it up at 7-7, the Mules added two
runs in the third and two runs in the
fourth to open up an 11-7 lead. Each
team added a run in the sixth to make
it 12-8. In the seventh, the Garnet
Tide cut the lead to 12-11, only to
have the Mules answer with two more
to make it 14-11. The Garnet Tide
forged back ahead in the eigth, scoring four runs to make it 15-14. The
Mules fought back, plating three runs
to go back ahead 17-15. RBI singles
by Roth and Farneth in the top of the
ninth knotted the score at 17-17, setting manager Frank Agovino and assistantcoach MikePatrone upfor yet
another Maalox moment. A leadoff
single and successive walks loaded
the bases with nobody out. Dave
Lischer '97 induced the next batter to
pop out to short, but a single through
the drawn-in infield by the following
batter ended another typically wacky
GarnetTide baseball game, 18-17.
With at least eight games left in
their season, the Garnet Tide hopes to
not only win a few more games, but to
establish something positive for next
season, as well.

Men's lacrosse stays
positive in a tough,
winless season
By

Jennifer Z. Chen

Rebuilding appears to be the motto
for this year's men's lacrosse team.
Leading a rather young and inexperienced squad, tri-captains Aaron
Hultgren '9B, Pat Donaghy '9B and
Pete Hamilton '97 shoulder a bulk of
theresponsibilities in guiding the team
during the games and in practices.
Head coach Pat Gress noted their
contributions in encouraging and developing younger players.
Although Hamilton has been sidelined with a shoulder injury for the
majority of this season, Hultgren and
Donaghy consistently provide solid
performances in the games. Coach
Gress complimented his players' ability to "slay positive in a pretty tough
stretch." Without a victory under their
belt yet this season, the squad is definitely going through trying times.
In last Saturday's game against
Dickinson College, the Garnettallied
one goal against the Red Devils. Goalkeepers, Sig Rydquist 'OO and Ben
Hen wood '97, split the time in the
cage and allowed in ten goals.
Henwood started the game and
warded off four shots whereas
Rydquist kept seven of Dickinson's
shots from entering Garnet's net.
The Swat offense registered sixteen shots on the opposing goalie.
Donaghy, playing the midfield, in the
fourth quarter scored the only Garnet
goal offapass fromattackman Steven
Shin '9B, who collected an assist for
the day. Tony Buendias '9B, who had
not played lacrosse in highschool,
filled in admirably on the attack as
the regular player was sick.
The Garnet and the Red Devils
were evenly matched in terms defensive draws. Swarthmore controlled
forty-four groundballs in comparison with the Dickinson's fifty.
One thing that the Garnet did not
take advantage of their extra-man
attack when the Devils committed a
penalty. Swarthmore failed to capitalize on any offive chances to score
with an extra man on the field.
Dickinson, on the other hand,
scored on two of their four man-up
situationsand had two players to score
hat-tricks. Evenly matched, the Swat
offense did not have as much luck as
the Dickinson team did in finding the
back of the net that day.
The Garnet next faced the Longshoremen of Washington College,
who are ranked second nationally.
Although Swarthmore was shut-out,
Coach Gress described this game as
one of the most solid performances
thatthe Garnet had put on this season.
"We played hardfor the entire sixty
minutes," Gress said. "Washington
walked off the field with great respect for us because we did not give
up one bit."
Swarthmore managed to keep
Washington scoreless for the first
eight minutesof the game, which was
a feat that most teams could not accomplish. This was due in part to the
strong defensive play of Alex
DeShields '9B and Tucker Zengerle
'OO. This game was a prime example
of what Coach Gress called the
Garnet's improvement and maturation as a team over the season, as they
forced the Longshoremen to work for
every single point.
The game stats demonstrated why
theLongshoremen are the second best
team in the nation, but they were not
indicative of the Garnet's efforts.
Washington out-shot Swarthmore 5020, and drew twenty-three more
groundballs than Swat's forty.
Swarthmore's two goalies matched
the efforts of four Washington goalies in making a total of nine saves.
Not taking advantage of their extra-man opportunities once again was
Swat's downfall as they passed up
the eleven times that Washington
played with a man down. The fact
that the Longshoremen committed
eleven penalties showed the aggressive playing style that they utilize.
The Garnet's next match-up is on
Saturday against the Bullets of
Gettysburg College, whose style of
play is similar to that of the Longshoremen. This home contest on
Clothier Fields is guaranteed to be a
competitive one as the young Garnet
squad fights to chalkup their first win
of the season.

Softball Struggling
By

Jean Quinn

The softball team continues its
downward spiral. Having lost all
four games this week, the Garnet's
record is now a dismal 2-22 overall,
0-12 in the conference.
Last Friday the team faced Allentown College and should have been
driven to victory by an article printed
in Allentown's newspaper which
summarily slammed Swat's team and
labeled them a pushover. Intensity
was high in the beginning of the game
and the Garnet scored three runs in
the first inning.
Apryl Dunning '99 made her teammates proud when she slid safely into
home and hurt theircatcher's mouth.
Allentown also had spirited moments
and broke juniorFernanda Gonzalez's
finger on a close play at second. In
the end, the Garnet lost the battle 8-7
after going into the seventh inning
with a two run lead.
Amy White 'OO sparked a sixthinning rally with a pinch-hit double.
Michelle Walsh '9B was four for four,
with a double, 3 runs, and a pair of
RBIs. Lurah Hess '99, Jen
VanderVeer '99, and Rhiana Swartz
'OO each collected two hits.
Coach Cheri Goetcheus lamented
the team's inconsistency on the offensive end. "Five errors hurt us, as
we weren't able to make up the difference with our offense. Defensively,
we allowed them to sneak back quietly into the game and we didn't have
enough in us to answer back. When
were pressured to come up withruns,
we weren't able to come through,"
she said.
The Garnet dropped a non-conference game to Albright on Monday, 86. Once again, the team, scoring four
runs, put up a strong showing in the
last inning, but it was unstable fielding that cost them the game. "Two
errors in the first inning were the
difference and allowed 2 unearned

runs to score. Once again errors cost
us, allowing Albright to build a lead
and put us in a hole," said Goetcheus.
Nowadays, no play is routine for the
team, who struggle with everything
from fielding grounders, making accurate throws, catching flies, and

hit-

ting cut-offs.
Offensively, Jean Quinn '99 was 3
for 4 with a triple and two runs scored.
Walsh tripled and hit a 2 run homer in
the last inning to narrow the gap.
Mary Beth Alvarez '9B and Dana
Lehman '9B were both 2 for 4 at the
plate.
The team had a poor outing against
defending conference champions
Ursinus and dropped both games of
the double-header, 8-1 and 9-0. With
four skilled pitchers, the Bears overpowered the Garnet, who were for
the most part silent at the plate.
Alvarez commented, "No one
seemed intense and ready to play the
best we c0u1d.... I was disappointed
because previously we had been hitting so well as a team. I thought we
were finally getting our confidence
up."
One strategy that had catalyzed the
Garnet's bats was a changed line-up.
"I think it gives us a more potent
offense. We've spread our power hitters throughout the lineup and given
some strength to the bottom of the
lineup. It can surprise other teams
when they assume that the bottom of
the orderis our weaker batters," commented Goetcheus.
Remaining on the Garnet's schedule are doubleheaders against conference foes Haverford and Franklin
and Marshall, as well as games versus Beaver and Widener.
"We have the opportunity to win
our remaining games if we always
come prepared to play a full 7 innings. We have to have a positive
mental edge going up to the plate and
we have to complete the routine
plays," said Goetcheus.

Clashing Sticks vs.
Devils and the Mules
By Jaclyn

Coutts

The swarthmore women's lacrosse
team played three hard games this
past week and Walked away with two
wins and one loss. The team began
their tough week by traveling to

Dickinson College last Thursday. The
Garnet started out slowly, giving up
three goals in the first ten minutes,
and were down by one at halftime. A
"motivational" talk from head coach
Karen Borbee woke the team up a bit
during half timeand sent the women
back on the field with more determination. "We just decided we couldn't
lose to Dickinson, so we startedplaying harder and concentrating more,"
said sophomore cover point Sarah
Singleton. Senior captain Lia Ernst
led the scoring withfour goals. Freshmen attack wing Alicia Googins kept
her college record going strong with
three goals. Holly Baker '99 tallied
two and Ch'uya Hornberger '97 and
Laura Starita '97 each scored one to

bring the final score to 11-8.
A rainy Saturday saw a tragic defeat for the Lady Garnet against
Gettysburg. The intensity of thegame
made the overall atmosphere like a
Nike "Just Do It" ad. "The team really played a good game," said Karen
Borbee. "It's a shame we had to lose
to Gettysburg again, but I'm happy
with the overall playing and effort
from the team." The two teams battled
neck and neck for the duration of
play, with Gettysburg scoring the final and decisive point with only thirty
seconds left, leaving thefinal score at
8-9. The intensity of the game caused
tempers to run quite high on the sidelines. Tempers were so high in fact
that the Gettysburg coach was given
a yellow card by the referee forarguing against a call. The Garnet's attack
put up a good fight, tallying 27 shots
on goal. Fortunately for Gettysburg,
their keeper had a really great
