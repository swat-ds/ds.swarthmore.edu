Connerly talks to tense crowd
of ending 'racial preferences'

By Mara Hvistendaht
Phoenix Staff

CAYLEY PENDERGRASS | Phoenix Staff

'ard Connerly, Proposition 209 proponent, spoke last Thursday.

The atmosphere in LPAC was
civil but tense as Ward Connerly,
a leading opponent of race-based
affirmative action, spoke last
Thursday. Connerly, who successfully ended racial preferences in California with the initiation of Proposition 209, provoked criticism that at times bordered on contempt as he spoke
to a predominantly pro-affirmative action audience.
Connerly focused on the use of
affirmative action to achieve racial diversity in university admissions, suggesting that the
preferences many universities
give to racial minorities should
instead be given to those from
disadvantaged socioeconomic
backgrounds.
"My whole objective as long as
I live on this planet will be to try
to drive my nation to the point
where we eliminate the silly little

boxes that we have on application
forms," he said.
To Connerly, a libertarian who
allies himselfwith conservatives,
race-based affirmative action
both ignores the rights of the individual and provides a simplistic solution to a complex problem. "We sometimes throw in
race or ethnic background as a
shortcut, as a proxy," he said.
"Give the individual the benefit
of an individual assessment." If
we want to abolish racism, he
suggested, we should treat race
as a descriptive feature like eye
color or hair texture.
It is a position for which, much
of the time, Connerly stands
alone. His support for the individual has earned him the enmity of the groups that he purports to help. "Do I have an open
door from the NAACP? No, not
at all. Do I care for one? Not really.... There are some groups
that, in my view, aren't as interested in solving the problem as

they profess to be."
If a rugged and opinionated
individualist, though, Connerly
was candid abouthis own misgivings. He acknowledged that affirmative action has effected
some important advances: "I'm
still torn about whether it was the
right thing to do in the '6os when
it was embarked upon. I often
wonder, where would we be without it?"
Even his life mission to abolish application boxes is problematic at times. "I want to get rid of
the boxes, but at a certain level
the boxes have some value," he
admitted.
His personal doubts aside,
however, Connerly was bold to
deliver the speech he did at a
campus that he described as racially "engineered." Some audience members did not take to his
ideas easily, and the lecture was
marked by a few interchanges of

Brand-new Mock
Trial team wins
trip to Nationals
By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff
The fledgling Swarthmore Mock Trial Asso-

ciation stunned the competition at its first American Mock Trial Association regional tournament
at Princeton this past weekend, winning the

award for "Best New Team." The Swarthmore
MTA, founded just six months ago, placed seventh out of 25 competing teams. Team member
Payal Shah 'O3 was awarded the plaque for "Best
Witness." On Tuesday the team was informed that
they won a wild-card bid to the National Tournament, which will be held in Minneapolis-St.Paul
on March 31.
The Swarthmore MTA was founded last semester by Bohee Yoon 'Ol and Dennis Cheng 'Ol, and,
unlike their competition, has no faculty or legal
coach, and a very small budget. Cheng wrote that
we team's performance "was unprecendented
tor a new team, despite the constraints we faced."
According to Yoon, the team was "the buzz of
the whole tournament." The Swarthmore team
defeated Brown, NYU, and Penn State before
losing to Princeton in a close match.
In a mock trial competition, each team is given
the same case to prepare, alternating every year
between a civil and a criminal case. Three members prepare each side of the case, and they

UPenn demonstration ends
After University of Pennsylvania students staged a nineday sit-in that culminated in a 48-hour hunger strike, the
university administration agreed Tuesday to step up its efforts against sweatshop labor.
The students, who numbered about 30 in all, began the
protest because of concern that the university had not taken
adequate measures to ensure that its clothing line was produced under fair working conditions. They demanded and
successfully obtained theresignation of the university from
the Washington-based Fair Labor Association (FLA), a motley crew of manufacturers, human rights groups and universities that monitors factory conditions.
The problem with the FLA, according to the groupPenn
Students Against Sweatshops, is that its affiliation with the
apparel industry makes it biased. They want UPenn to follow the lead of Haverford, Oberlin, Bard, Brown and Loyola
and join the Workers' Rights Consortium (WRC), a group
that has no such industry ties.
In a statement on the Students Against Sweatshops Web
site, UPenn historyprofessor DavidLudden put it this way:
"The choice between the FLA and the WRC is basically b&
tween an organization composed of corporate interest groups
and their supporters (FLA) and an organization composed
of unions, workers' rights groups, and their supporters
(WRC)."

Ludden went on to explain why the administration would
be reluctant to part with the FLA. The endorsement of the
FLA by governmental and corporate bodies makes the organization very appealing to a culture that practices "corporate cronyism." The UPenn administration has not yet decided whether to join the WRC.
Swarthmore is listed as a member of neither the FLA nor
the WRC on the organizations' Web sites.

"Beam Me Up Fatty" host Brendan Nyhan interviews former "Different Strokes" star Gary Coleman last Sunday night.
Nyhan, along with co-hosts David Plante, Rory Alarcon and Nick Attanasio, asked personal and career questions of the highvoiced and dwarfed TV personality. Coleman is currently promoting ugo.com, a gaming and video site. The interview was
scheduled to broadcast live on WSRN from 10 to II p.m. but was cut short because of technical difficulties.

Dar Williams charms Swat audience
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
Even though tickets were not going to be distributed
until 8:15 pm, Catherine Vanderwaart 'O3 and her friends,
diehard fans, set up camp in LPAC at 3:30 p.m. last Friday afternoon in anticipation of the Dar Williams concert to be held that evening. Explaining their early arrival, Vanderwaart said, "People were doing work. They
might as well be sitting in LPAC." To pass the time, Ben
Zhuk 'Ol brought out his guitar. Other people in the growing line, so as not to lose their spots by going to dinner,
ordered pizzas to theLPAC lobby.
Not until just before 11 p.m., more than seven hours
after Vanderwaart's arrival, did Williams, a singersongwriter best known for her folk sound and poetic
lyrics, walk out on stage before a packed and enthusiastic house. Alone on the mainstage, with only an acoustic guitar, she nevertheless managed to captivate the
600-person audience, many of whom had never heard
of Williams until the buzz began on campus a few weeks
ago.
Although billed as a musician, Williams played an hourlong set that was almost equal parts song and speech. It
was this conversational tone, honest and without pretension, that endeared the performer to much of the audience.
Playing both to and with her listeners, Williams included many references to Swarthmore, including her
parents' appraisal of the school, "smart," and her Yalie
sister's wish that she had gone here instead. JeffLevine
'OO found Williams's interactions with the audience the
best part of the concert. "That's what I appreciated most,"
he said, "because the music style wasn't a favorite."
Paul Arandia 'OO echoed this opinion, saying that "the

most enjoyable part was her talking."
The overall audience reaction to Williams's openess

was similarly positive; many people reported developing crushes on her over the course of the concert.
Williams's concert appealed to both her avid fans and
those unfamiliar with her music. Vanderwaart, who has
become a Williams fan since her arrival Swarthmoreand
knew all of the songs performed on Friday, said of Williams that "she's really good live."
Vanderwaart also stressed that the concert was a wideranging success. "Even people who had never heard of
her seemed to really enjoy the concert," she said.
Levine, one of the uninitiated, agreed. "Overall, I
thought it was a really great concert," he said.
Williams's concert cost approximately $15,000, a large
sum of money for an event whose success was uncertain beforehand. Yet the response of both the
Swarthmore and the larger Tri-Co student body showed
that the expense was worthwhile. Even though Williams
was relatively unknown on campus, the lobby of LPAC
was full of people waiting for tickets by 7:30 p.m. Of
the 650 tickets available, 600 were distributed exclusively to Tri-Co students, faculty and staff by 8:30 p.m.
Even with the dividing wall down, the LPAC main theatre easily filled to capacity. When asked if he thought
that the cost was justified, Levine assented enthusiastically. "Yes," he said, "becauseit was good to have something. We need events."
After the concert, Williams autographed CDs in the
lobby and chatted with students. Unafraid to get personal,
she told Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol stories about his father
who had been one of her favorite psychology professors
at Wesleyan. A few enamored students invited Williams
to go to Tom Jones, a local diner, but due to previous plans,
she had to reluctantly decline.

Fr. Roy Bourgeois, founder of the School of theAmericas Watch, will speak at Swarthmore next Monday afternoon. The event, entitled "The War on the Poor and the
School of the Americas," will focus on Bourgeois' life
and his campaign against the School of the Americas. In
addition, Bourgeois will examine the larger economic
implications of American intervention in I,arin America.
His visit is sponsored
by Solidaridad.

groups in military tactics. The organization
already has an active
presence on the Swarthmore campus, as Ben Schweigert
'O2, one of the organization's members, explained.
Solidaridad works closely with SOAW's local chapter, and
when Schweigert heard that Bourgeois would be in the
area, he invited him to speak on campus. "[Bourgeois]
has a pretty incredible life story," Schweigert said, "It's

inspiring."
That life story includes Navy service in Bolivia, a
forced flight from the country due to threats from the
military dictator, Hugo Banzer Suarez, and the death of
six of his Jesuit acquaintances in San Salvador. Both
Suarez and the killers of the Jesuits were graduates of
the School of the Americas. This series of events led
Bourgeois to found the SOAW and coordinate an international campaign against the school.
For the past few years, as part of this campaign, Bourgeois has organized annual rallies at the army base in
Georgia which serves as the school's campus. Last year
over 12,000 people attended, including such notables as
Pete Seeger and Martin Sheen, along with almost 60
Swarthmore students. With over 4,400 people commit'
ting civil disobedience, the rally was the largest such
action since the protests surrounding the Vietnam War
Schweigert initiated Swarthmore's participation, along
with Mattie Weiss 'Ol.
Bourgeois also spoke at Swarthmore last year, but his
lecture was poorly attended. Schweigert attributes the
small size of the audience to a lack of publicity, but based
on the involvement in this year's rally and the interest
already expressed, he anticipates a much larger crowd
this year.

Seven
members
of
Swarthmore's Pro-Choice Task
Force (PCTF) witnessed a bomb
threat at the Planned Parenthood
clinic in Philadelphia on Saturday.
The students were there to escort
patients past anti-choice demonstrators and into the clinic.
When a member of the Planned
Parenthood surgical team received an anonymous bombthreat call, the students and other
helpers, who were in the building
at the time, were asked to leave
the building immediately. The
clinic was evacuated and the surrounding streets were closed. The
search squad discovered no bomb
and the clinic reopened around
lunchtime on Saturday, but no
abortions were performed on that
day because of the huge delay.
The threat mainly caused disruptions to the patients. For most
of the women, rescheduling appointments interferes with other
plans. It may even be more dangerous because rescheduling can
often mean the difference between an abortion in the first trimester and the second, during
whichabortionis more dangerous.
One of the escorts, Claire
Feldman-Riordan 'Ol, reflected on
these problems. "Some of the
women who were there that day
have children and jobs and will
have trouble rescheduling their
appointments," she said. "One
woman said that she wouldn'tbe
able to get another appointment
for a month, and by that point the

pregnancy might be too advanced."
PCTF members regularly go to
the clinic on Saturday mornings
at 7 a.m. to escort patients at
Planned Parenthood and at the
Elizabeth Blackwell clinic.
Theaccident will in no way stop
PCTFfrom performing its weekly
task.Ariel Kobylak 'O2, the presidentofPro-Choice Task Force and
coordinator of the escorting program, explained that PCTF plans
to provide an adequate response
to the bomb threat. "I personally
think that, while people are very
upset by this, they're also angry,
and will want even more to escort
and do whatever they can to protect women's—everyone's—legal
rights," she said. She has already
received several e-mails from
people who got interested in the
escorting program because of
what happened on Saturday.
The group has planned an escort training session on Feb. 23
and a campaign to raise awareness of pro-choice issues like the
threat to reproductive rights that
pro-life demonstrators maypose.
"If there's anything good that
will come out of this, it's that
people's awareness will be raised
about the issues involved in the
abortion controversy," said
Kobylak. "It helps to think of all
the Swarthmore students that
wake up before dawn to drive into
the city to help women they don't
even know, but nonetheless care
about, while getting little but personal satisfaction from this task."

SCCS proposes using
gameroom space
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
Two Student Council members
and a system administrator for
the Swarthmore College Computer Society have written a proposal to convert the Tarble
gameroom into a 24-hour computer lab and a meeting space for
student groups.
The authors, Student Council
co-chair Brandon Silverman 'O2,
council member Nick Attanasio
00 and Tom Stepleton 'O2 of the
SCCS, have submitted their proposal to the council. It calls for
moving a pool table, foosball
table and Ping-Pong table from
the gameroom in Tarble basement to the first floor of Tarble
near the pinball machines.
. "The purpose of this proposal
Js to
address the present inefficient use of the Tarble All CamPus Space, the clear need for a
computer lab on campus
and the inadequate space currently occupiedby the SCCS," the
Proposal states.

The proposal follows the deteat last semester of the SCCS's

into a computer lab. That option was defeated by a proposal
°t student art
space by the Photo
4ub. and the Student Art Assoclation. Silverman, the art

association's president, is now
working to arrange new organizational space for the SCCS as
well.
According to the proposal, the
gameroom space in Tarble basement would become a 24-hour
student-accessible computer lab
with iMacs, Windows PCs and
Unix workstations. The center of
the room wouldcontain a conference table for student organizations, and the nearby "theater"
room would have a video projector, VCR and computer for showing MPEG movie files. The adjacent windowless storage room
would become the site for the
SCCS's servers.
Upstairs, the game tables
would join Student Council's new
pinball machines, whichthe proposal noted have begun transforming the first floor lounge
space from a study area into a
recreational space.
"The most appropriate area for
a gameroom/recreational space
is not the basement of Tarble,"
the proposal states. It also addresses the fact that the proposal
would completely remove a
study spacefrom campus, noting
that additional quiet lounge space
will be added to DuPont during
the upcoming renovations.
According to the proposal, the
SCCS is in need of new space for

its servers because rainwater
leaks into its current room on the
fifth floorof Parrish, whichcould
potentially damage its equipment.

Under the proposal, the organizational space would be maintained by the SCCS and Student

Council.
Renovations necessitated by
the proposal include repainting
the gameroom space, running an
Ethernet connection there, and
adding power sockets and a fiberoptic security system similar to
the one used in the computer sci-

ence department's Sun lab. On
the first floor, the proposal suggests removing the wooden wall
between the snack bar and the
lounge space, removing the current furniture and installing a
television set, which would be
purchased by Student Council.

contained hostility.
For example, when Connerly
outlined his vision of a future in
which race is only used by the
police (for descriptive purposes),
the memory of the Rodney King
beatings gave way to peals of sardonic laughter. Connerly responded with equal contempt:
"You know, one of the problems
is that on every campus some students think they know what
you're thinking."
Yet, despite the atmosphere of
mutual frustration, Connerly engaged the audience members in
a lengthy question and answer
session: "I have to wake up at 4
a.m. tomorrow," he said, "but I
don't want to shut anybody out
here." Students responded eagerly with challenges, and more
flocked to him during the reception that followed.
To some, the question and answer interchange was inhibited

by audience biases. JamieRowen
'O3 said that although audience
members effectively challenged
Connerly, "people seemed to
have their own predispositions to
his arguments."
For Karima Wilson 'O3, however, Connerly was entirely deserving of the critical onslaught
he received. "If he could tackle
the real issues, then maybe I'd
give him a little credit," she said.
College Repulicans co-president Dave Thomas 'O2, who was
instrumental in bringing
Connerly to campus, anticipated
and even welcomed the barrage
of criticism that Connerly received. In his introductory
speech, he announced that his
goal in bringing Connerly was to

half'...and to convince you that

Swarthmore is gettingready to
step into the limelight with a new
set of directional signs which will
appear on campus during the
2000-01 academic year. A special
committee has been formed to
discuss plans for making
Swarthmore easier to navigate,
especially for visitors who are
flocking to campus attractions in
ever-increasing numbers.
Like many other college campuses, Swarthmore is largely unlabeled. The first round of proposed signs will help people find
where to park on campus for different destinations and direct
them to the various sites they are
seeking. This phase will include
mounting signs on the surrounding roads, including the Baltimore Pike and Route 320. A second phase of the project will label less-public destinations
which are mostly visited by students.
The committee has already
chosen to work with the Douglass
Group, a design firm based in
Washington, D.C., with extensive
experience in creating signs for
arboreta and parks. The
Douglass Group designed the
signs for the National Arboretum
and several botanical gardens.
The firm will meet with the steering committee in the beginning
of March to begin working on the
details of the proposed signs.
The nine-person committee is
made up ofrepresentatives from
admissions, the arboretum,
LPAC, student activities, facilities, the art department, the Office of News and Information,
and Student Council. They eventually hope to incorporate alumni
input, along with the opinions of

borough representatives.
According to Janet Semler, director of planning and construction, the committee is trying to
commission a system that is easy
to maintain and is adaptable to
new buildings, suitablefor a constantly changing campus. The
garnet-colored signs around
campus are "a stopgap means,
envisioned to be temporary," said
Semler. They will be replaced by
the new signs.
Visitors to campus often have
trouble figuring out where to go.

tures, the librariesand the admissions office, are all popular yet
elusive destinations for visitors.
The List Gallery also attracts
many art-lovers from the surrounding community in increasing numbers, according to Tom
Krattenmaker, director of the
Office of News and Information.
He says that the new signs will
"send a signal that this is a welcoming college community."
Student response is generally
positive. Jacob Krich 'OO points
out that on a campus where every tree and shrub is labeled, it
makes sense to label its essential
edifices as well.
A wide range of visitors come
to campus needing directions;
one senior recalls that telling an
ambulance how to get from the
Rose Garden circle to Hallowell
was "more stress than I was prepared for." The signs would be
especially useful for directing
traffic to different areas of campus more efficiently.
Foot traffic is no less important, even for the new class of
freshmen every year. Tim
Stewart-Winter 'Ol believes that
"not labeling buildings is kind of
snooty. It's like you're already
supposed to know, and if you
don't know, you're an outsider."
The new directional signs should
eliminate the distinctionbetween
insider and outsider by helping
visitors and new students alike
feel at home on campus.

"Ah, yes," you are thinking. "Just what I wanted to
read another person complaining about college food."
In that case, let us reassure you. There will be no
talk of the quality of the food in this editorial. Yes, we
know. Sharpies is not serving foie gras or breast of

So what is this editorial about? A fine question,
gentle reader. This editorial is about convenience. Not
24-hour Wawa convenience, mind you, but that wonderful type of convenience that allows us to wake up at 2
p.m. after a long night of writing and still manage to
procure a hearty meal.
Oh! To sing the praises of the snack bar! Tarble and

Kohlberg
when we actually eat breakfast, to subvert the mealtime paradigm imposed by Sharpies.
But do not let us get ahead of ourselves. The snack bar
is not always the infallible culinary goddess we wish her
to be. We must ask, "Where are you, snack bar, when we
unshackle ourselves from our books at midnight? Where
are you, mother-provider, when we rouse ourselves from
a Friday night of Dionysian indulgences?"
In the days of the ancients, the oracles did not close
their doors to lonely souls seeking spiritual nourishment at the witching hour. The snack bar should be a
modern-day oracle, offering sustenance to the famished wanderer.
This is why we are throwing down the gauntlet. Will
you rise to the challenge, snack bar? Success will bring
you many fine offerings of points and credit.

The Dar Experience
Remember The Way lon Experience? We do. After a
failed attempt to bring George Clinton to campus last
spring, the Social Affairs Committee hastily disposed
of nearly $lO,OOO to bring a no-name college band and
some anemic special effects to the LPAC Mainstage.
On the night of the show, some students filtered in and
many filtered out of the half-filled venue, and those
who stayed danced to bland rock tunes and those
washed-out favorites.
Swarthmore's collective memory may be thin, but
anyone at the Dar Williams concert last Friday and at
The Waylon Experience last spring know that the two
events are beyond comparison. The latter does not
deserve to be in the same sentence as the former, let
alone in the same venue, at the same college or, God
forbid, in the same price range.
Quite simply, Swarthmore received a genuine treat
when Dar Williams, one of the most authentic folk
singers today, gave a nearly two-hour performance in
LPAC last Friday night. Her presence filled the
oversized stage rather than succumbing to it, and her
balance of verbal ramblings and spirited performances
energized the 600-plus member audience.
The event was simply electric, despite tight scheduling and a lack of publicity. Students undoubtedly had
their fair share of complaints not a big enough name,
not well-organized, not enough publicity but the
event's success is what resounds most.
Dar Williams was such a wonderful event partly
because of the way it snuck up on the campus. It only
took a reasonable amount of planning on the part of a few
Swatties to bring a popular folk singer to campus.
Beyond a series of Phoenix articles, the buzz around
canipus was minimal. As if out of nowhere, 600 Tri-Co
students converged on LPAC, some more than five hours
before the show's start. Suddenly, Dar was all the buzz.
Ultimately, any event that draws that many jaded
and gets them that excited has to be billed as a
success. All this, mind you, for an event that cost a little
over $lO per Swattie and about $25 for each person in
a ttendance. We would gladly pay that much for another
event that can mean so much to the campus.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Ad campaign ignores victims
To the Editor:
If I were independently wealthy, I wouldpublish "We,
Dead," a counter-attack on United Colors ofBennetton's
recent advertising ploy "We, On Death Row."
With permission of the victims' families, the glossy
magazine would be filled with color photographs of
the convicts' handiwork: murdered bodies recovered
from brutal crimes scenes, bodies prostrate for dissection on autopsy tables, lain frigid in morgues, blooddrainedand painted in caskets. I would pose the corpses
withthe same questions asked of their convicted murderers, questions that resonate with a cruel twist of
irony:
It has been a long time since you've been on the
other side. What does it feel like to have lost your
freedom?
Have you noticed any changes in your body?
Do you ever fantasize about where you might have
been today?
I loathe the thought of hampering closure on violent
cases, but the unscrupulous fashion moguls at
Bennetton already grossly violated the sanctity of the
grieving process with their international publication. A
dark satire with visceral, honest, chilling imagery is,
unfortunately, the only vindication possible. I am not
arguing for or against the death penalty, however. My
personal stance on the matter is irrelevant. The contention is simply thatBennetton's presentation, alone,
is reprehensible. Why ask of the guilty murderer what
we long to know from the innocent dead:
Do you dream?
Can you hear the rain?
Do people come to visit you?
There were no intimations of remorse from those
interviewed, but instead only pathetic, selfish, unwarranted pleas for sympathy.For example, as a pull-quote
for a double-page spread, Bennetton cited JohnLotter's
despair: "I think people like seeing other people suffer
and killed." In hisfull interview, this utterly hypocritical
remark was preceded by the qualification thatmurder
is a natural human instinct. Several other death-row
spokesmen cited bereavement at the loss of fellow

FDA's gay men restriction: Bad blood or bad policy?
By Corey Datz-Greenberg
and Tim Stewart-Winter
For The Phoenix
We know you've been wondering: What
will the queers complain about next? Well,
it has to do with the blood drive. Before
you get the wrong idea, though, we'd like
to make it clear that we're very much in
favor of blood drives, at Swarthmore and
in general. We applaud the tremendous
efforts of An Hoang, Matt Asano, and DU
members who organized the drive, particularly given the present emergency blood
shortage in parts of the country.
However, we're concerned about the
current policies of the FDA, which regulates blood. In compliance with these policies, the Red Cross administers a questionnaire asking blood donors whether they fall
in various high-risk categories. They ask,
for instance, whether you have engaged in
prostitution; whether you're an IV drug
user; and, if you're a man, whether you've
had sex with another man since 1977. If you
answer yes to this last question, yourblood
will be "permanently deferred." In plain
English, this means it will be thrown out.
We think this policy is not grounded in
adequate scientific evidence, but rather
has remained in place because of our
society's prejudices against homosexuality. The policy is statistically indefensible,
discriminatory, and rooted in deep-seated
cultural fears. The public's concerns about
protecting the blood supply are valid. Still,
in this case, the policy produced by those
concerns is discriminatory—and, we
think, unnecessarily so.
First, the statistics. In 1997, the FDA's
Blood Products Advisory Committee reviewed the current policy. They considered
threekinds of data in this review: estimates
of the prevalence of HIV infection among
men who have sex with men (MSMs); estimates about how many MSMs would donate blood if the policy were changed; and
estimates of the chances of inaccurate test
results caused by (1) the window period
between exposure and seroconversion, (2)
human errors and (3) laboratory errors.
At this meeting, FDA scientists roughly
estimated that, if they changed the questionnaire procedure so that MSMs could
donate blood, the number of infected units
of blood making their way into the nation's
blood supply would at most increase from

with another man since 1977.
If you answer yes to this last
question, your blood will be
"permanently deferred."
one unit, out of 14 million per year, to two
units. This would not be an order-of-magnitude increase—and according to the
FDA's own projections, it could increase
the annual blood supply by over 140,000
units. Since there are frequent blood
shortages in the United States, the increased blood supply would save lives.
Since routine testing of the blood supply
was introduced in 1986, there has been virtually no risk of HIV infection associated
with receiving donatedblood. Clearly, in the
early days of the AIDS epidemic, the blood
supply was seriously compromised, and
excluding MSMs from donationmade sense.
But today we have excellent tests and an
extremely safe blood supply, and we still
would if MSMs could donate. Almost no risk,
times two, is still almost no risk.
Second, FDA policy regards malehomosexuality as a behavior only, not an identity. Identities, in our society, are protected; for example, even ifpeople ofcolor
were twice as likely to be HIV-infected as
white people, the government's commitment to official nondiscrimination would
probably take precedence over the increased risk. Maybe the FDA would even
defend such a decision by telling us that
almost no risk, times two, is still almost
no risk. Yet, when it comes to MSMs, the
FDA continues to point to the public's view
that "any threat to the safety of the blood
supply is intolerable," in the words of an
official at the 1997 meeting.
The FDA, and the government in general, do not have a commitment to nondiscriminationagainst homosexuals. In fact,
in a personal interview, an FDA spokesperson refused to acknowledge to us the obvious overlap between MSMs and gay men.
Admittedly, there are important distinctions between the categories, but the overlaps are important as well.
Imagine if the FDA found that using
tampons increased the risk of HIV infection; could they seriously argue that using tampons had nothing to do with being

a woman? This is precisely the type of argument the spokesperson made to us: the
FDA discriminates against a behavior and
not an intrinsic identity like sex, gender, or
race. Some gay men don't have sex with
other men, just as some women don't use
tampons. The vast majority of gay men,
however, like to have sex with other men,
and see this behavior as part of the definition of what it means to be a gay man.
Moreover, even if the FDA refuses consciously to take into account the concept
of gayness as an identity, its policies nevertheless take place within the framework
of our culture's subconscious discourses
about blood, transmission, and contamination. The anthropologist Mary Douglas,
among others, has shown that lots of cultures are filled with strange ideas about
pollution and contamination; these fears are

often attached to body fluids and products.
For instance, you might say that the public is afraid that a man having sex with
another man might thereby taint his blood,
not just with HIV, but with a kind of nebulous unacceptability. Our often unconscious fears ofcontamination affect which
"facts" and "data" we emphasize when we
make decisions about risk and probability.
It is important to recognize that the
FDA's science does not operate in some
sort of neutral cultural universe of precise calculations, but is rather influenced
at every stage by stereotypes and emotions about same-sex sexuality. The policy
that prevents gay men from donating
blood is unnecessary discrimination that
not only contributes to an atmosphere of
intolerance, but also exacerbates the
nation's blood shortages.

Rethinking college relationships on Valentine's Day
By David Catanese
The Crusader (Susquehanna University)
(U-WIRE) Valentine's Day

the holiday that generally means much more to
females than to males.
For some, it's a joyful day filled with
roses, teddy bears and chocolates topped
off with a romantic, candlelit dinner with
that significant other. For others, it's a
depressing day that heartbreakingly illuminates the fact that they are not in a relationship.
Every year this holiday rolls around,
there are many who think not having a
relationship is a painful cirucumstance to
be in. As college students, no one should
feel sad, depressed or lonely for the sole
reason of not having that significant other.
It'syour roommate, yourbest friend, the
guy down the hall, or maybe even you.
Most of us have played roles in the different parts.
Relationships can be the best and worst
things to happen to people. An equal and
honest relationship is one of the greatest
treasures in the world. On the other hand,

there are a significant number of college
couples that are unfortunately not in that
situation.
Think about someone you know in a relationship. When was their last fight or
problem? College is a time of change: We
grow physically, emotionally and ideologically. It is a time of reinvention and experimentation. It's said to be the most fun
time in your life. College relationships can
begin with a mere glance across a room,

an instant physical attraction, a romantic
encounter that develops into some type of
committment that grows into love which

provides security.
Relationships have great advantages like
stability, but sometimes thatis all that some
evolve to be
nothing more than having
someone. In the college atmosphere where
we are constantly meeting and interactins
with new people, keeping a stablerelationship is difficult. Both partners must want

to work at it. If one of the two stop caring,
it begins to go down the drain.

Other relationships are abusive and
filled with distrust, animosity amd even
rage. Some partners just use each other
for primarily physical or emotional reasons. Some relationships are downright
untrustworthy.
Once seemingly perfect couples willbe

It's a healthy learning experience, but

repeatedly get back together for the wrong

familiar with. That is not healthy, especially
in college. In order to mature, many people
in college relationships need to let go and

AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT AL BLOOM

Drug convicts' financial aid at risk
Dear President Bloom,
Earlier in this week, you announced that
Swarthmore College, through its athletic
teams, would "...support the NAACP boycott of South Carolina over the issue of
the continued display of the Confederate
flag." We believe that this is a valuable
statement ofintolerance for an antiquated
inflammatory symbol, and with the help
of similar actions by other institutions it
can bring about a sensible action by the
people and government ofSouth Carolina.
We now request that you continue the effort to bring about "...a humane and just society," and support another policy which has
been endorsed by the NAACP, as well as the
National Organization for Women, American
CivilLiberties Union, United States Students'
Association, and Friends Committee on NationalLegislation. The policy we are speaking of is a reform of the Higher Education
Act of 1998 to remove a provision which denies federal financial aid to students who
have been convicted ata state or federallevel
of any drug related offense.
This provision of the HEA goes into effect this July 1,and already the Free Application for Federal Student Aid includes
question 28, which asks students to report
whether or not they have drug related of-

fenses in theirrecord which subject them
to a loss of eligibility. As a result of the
provision, thousands of students will lose
their federal need based aid, and with it,
their ability to attend college. There is no
similar regulation for students convicted
of crimes such as murder, rape, assault,
vandalism, or theft. This law imposes an
unequal burden on students from lower
income families, allowing wealthier students to continue their education without
worry, in effect creating separate drug
laws for the rich and the poor.
In addition, this law is, whether intentionally or not, inexcusably racist. The
facts about drug arrests and convictions
are crystal clear. Non-Hispanic African
Americans make up a little over 11.3 percent of Americans over the age of 12.
Americans from Hispanic backgrounds
make up about 10.2 percent. Non-Hispanic
Blacks make up 15 percent of current
drug users, and Hispanics make up about
10 percent. Blacks (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), were 36.8 percent of those arrested
for "drug abuse violations" in 1997. In
1996,Blacks (againregardless of Hispanic
heritage) made up 53 percent of those convicted of a felony drug offense in State
courts, including 49 percent of those con-

victed for possession related offenses.
The incongruence is staggering.
Student governments from 13 campuses
around the country have endorsed HEA
reform, and we hope that the Swarthmore
student body will follow suit shortly. My
challenge to you, President Bloom, is twofold. First, we ask you, on behalf of the
administration of Swarthmore College, to
endorse HEA reform, and the end of aracist restriction on need based federal financial aid. Secondly, we ask you to work with
the Swarthmore financial aid department,
to replace aid denied to students because
of this act of Congress.
Flying a Confederate flag over a government building is a symbolic gesture
which many Americans now come to
equate withracial hatred and discrimination. Denying need based financial aid to
students in an observably racist fashion
is worse. It is an act which continues the
legacy of the Confederate flag, and what
it symbolizes, indefinitely into the future.

Facts of life: A biracial encounter
By Kari ma Wilson
For The Phoenix

While I would never say that my race defines me, being biracial often provides me with a unique perspective on life. Occasionally, it grants me experiences that challenge the very way I
see myself.
As I sat in an empty Tarble a few weeks ago on the day of the
snowstorm, I overheard a conversation about a recent Oprah
show, a dialogue on race and racism. The show featured students from a private high school and celebrities narrating their
experiences. When the girl spoke of the biracial participants,
whom she described as "black with a little something in them,"
ray ears perked up. One participant in the talk show, who was
black and Mexican, had saidhe identified as black because that's
how people see him and therefore that's what he would be. The
girl was ecstatic to tell this part of the story and her friend
shrilled with excitement. As the listener focused all her attention, Girl A said, smiling, "Finally, a mutt that's not confused."
My fellow Swattie's comment made my stomach wrench so
badly that I shot from my seat. I expressed my emotions to the
two girls. Girl A explained that the comment was part of an "ongoing conversation on biracials, those here at Swat" and she "had
even talked about it with her biracial friend." I told her I appreciated that she had put it in context but that it still hurt my feelings. Her friend, Girl B, offered me a seat as she explained in a
motherly tone a few things about the facts of life thatI as a first
year had not yet learned.
She told me how, as a minority in the Class of 2000, her firstyear experience had been one of little institutioinal support and
a lot of animosity. Because I openly admit that there are plenty
of things I do not know, I thanked her for sharing her experiences. Full of condescension, she continued talking. "Many
biracials around here think they're proof of tolerance. Just because their parents lied down together does not mean they loved
each other. The white parent is probably still racist. They like to
say they are biracial so that their white friends will think better
of them. But then when the shit hits the fan, they want to come
running back." She added as I stood to leave, "You yourself are
black because that's how people see you. Maybe as a senior you
will have a similar conversation and you'll be able to understand
then." I nodded, smiled and walked away to finish my lunch.
When I left Tarble, I cried.
Since the two girls would not apologize for their statements, I
'eel I have the right to address them publicly. My goal is not to
chastise them but to share with the entire community a very
Personal aspect of my life. While I understand and empathize
with the anger from which they spoke, I have a few points to
Nake to my new friends.
Foremost, Girls A and B, your statements were racist, derogatory and offensive. What would have happened if you had overheard two white people saying the equivalent of "Finally, a mutt
that knows his place!" except using the n-word instead? I wonder if you would have bothered as I did to learn the context of
the statement. It is ironic that as you narrated your struggles

through people's misconceptions about you, you insisted upon
your own prejudices about me without caring to know my experiences.
You might have learned what my life has been like as a member of a biracial family in the racially divided city of Birmingham, Ala. Girl B, you insinuated that my parents did not love
each other and that my white mother was racist. Unlike you, my
mother is not racist; she has probably experienced more racism
as the mother and wife of minorities from people who think like
you thanyou could imagine in your oh-so-wise-twenty-something
years. But this is an assumption on my part. My mother always
taught me an assumption makes an ass out of u and me—a lesson you might look into learning.
Throughout our conversation, you spoke to me as if you wanted
the best for me, but it was you, not a white person, who was racist
to me that day. It was you, not a white person, who threw the shit
not on the fan
but in my face. In saying this, I am not agreeing with your assumption that white people are racist by default.
I tend to give individuals more credit than that.
I apologize in advance if I hurt your feelings, but I am only
saying now honestly and openly what I would have said that
snowy day in Tarble if I was not about to either cry or slap the
smirk off your face. While I have paraphrased the comments
and omitted large parts of the conversation, I have not altered
the basic content or the tone in which they were spoken.
I challenge you or anyone who disagrees with me to say so and
by using this same forum. I say this because I believe that people
here, including me, are too content or too scared to voice their
true beliefs. I want to thank you for inspiring me to share mine.

Confed up
This space is usually devoted to national
politics rather than issues confronting
Swarthmore, but on the rare occasion
when the two intersect I am compelled to
keep my column closer to home. One of
those rare occasions was last Wednesday,
when the President's office issued a statement canceling all sports training trips to
South Carolina.
The NAACP has been calling for a national boycott of the state of South Carolina since Jan. 1 because it flies the Confederate flag over its Capitol Statehouse.
It seems that most students have accepted the College's decision to join a
handful of other area schools in participating in the tourism boycott, but I'm wondering if some students have done so only
reluctantly and without a full appreciation
of what an NAACP boycott is all about.
One athlete was quoted by The Daily
Gazette on Feb. 10 as saying, "It's not every day that you get to go to Myrtle Beach,"
and another student said, "The Confederate flag has been flying for years, and it
doesn't make sense for people to try and
make it stop now by cutting South
Carolina's revenue from athletic events."
Another athlete told the Gazette, "I don't
care we are going to California." I don't
think I need to explain why this seems to
me only a small improvement over the
previous two comments.
On Thursday morning, I overheard a
student defending South Carolina's "freedom of speech." Another student thought
that the boycott was organized by the
NCAA, not the NAACP.
I do not mean to suggest that all or even
most students did not support the College's
decision, and I certainly do not wish to imply that athletes have been more insensitive to the issue than other students; they
are simply the ones most directly affected
by the College's policy. But it is important
to note that the College issued its proclamation without muchof a public education
campaign to go along with it, and student
awareness may be suffering as a result.
Student-athletes who feel that they are
missing a rare opportunity to go to South
Carolina should realize that they are participating in a rare opportunity to protest
racist symbols and stand up for racial justice. Those who are relieved solely because their spring trips were relocated to
other sunny areas should consider how
they might have felt had rescheduling
been impossible, and whether such feelings would be justified.
Students who excuse the Confederateflag
because it has been flying for years should
know that it was erected in 1962 to commemorate the Civil War centennial, and
probably to express South Carolina's resentment for the civil rights movement then
flourishing in the South. They should also
recall similar arguments made by Southerners who resisted the civil rights movement,
as segregation, too, had existed for years.
While South Carolina can claim its
"State's rights" to fly the Confederate flag,
that should not stop an incensed public
from using all the rhetorical means at its
disposal, including economic sanctions, to
remove this highly offensive symbol from
its government buildings. Until it does so,
the NAACP, the College and its students
should not rest.

Connerly errs in class-based proposal

obligations
The administrationhas been wellbehaved
in the past week, acting as the paragon of
civil rights in boycotting South Carolina. Yet,
there are still two nagging issues that hideouslyblemish its usually soundtrack record
of reason and common sense the physical education requirement and swim test.
Perhaps many students perceive these
requirements as a necessary evil and a
hasslebut a small price to pay for being at
this lovely little Utopia (I find bothof these
ideas a tad far-fetched), but there is a
dearthof reasons for having thePE requirements or the swim test and a plethora of
arguments against them.
The administration needs to question what
it perceives as the purpose of Swarthmore;
I've never come across the College's mission statement, nor do I know if one exists,
but, judging from the atmosphere and the
mentality that Swarthmore fosters, I understand it to be something along the lines of
developing compassionate, intelligent citizens prepared for global responsibility. If this
is the case, I fail to see how not knowing
how to swim wouldbe a crippling obstacle in
realizing those goals, or conversely howbeing able to swim would further students in
realizing those objectives. There is something faintly absurd when I see a seniortaking four quarters of PE his senior spring,
trudging to the field house three times a
week so that he may graduate.
I agree that athleticism is a great asset,
but there comes an age when that becomes
a personal choice. If building the foundations
for a healthy way oflife is what the College
wants thePE requirements to engender, the
College must realize that forcing a student
to take, say, two semesters of fencing will
fail miserably to achieve that goal. As it
stands, the requirements make no substantive difference in students' lives; it manages
only to create a nuisance for them.
There is a case to be made for basic academic requirements in order to ensure that
students graduate from Swarthmore well
versed in various academic disciplines and
functional in at least one language other
than English. Academically well-rounded
students can contribute on many levels to
the quality ofclass discussions, impromptu
conversations about various topics, and
even the writing in ThePhoenix.
There is no reason that the College
should not offer the PE and swimming
classes if they are not made mandatory
I simply ask that it should be our privilege
to choose whether to take those classes.
It is not as though students are going to
emerge from Swarthmore as if it were from
the chrysalis of childhood our formative
years are past and our bad habits have
already been formed. Forcing students to
run around the indoor track like rats in a
wheel or to lift the aged and crumbling
nautilus weights three times a week will
only serve to annoy them with yet another
requirement. Worse, it prohibits students
from spending their time pursuing what
truly interests them.

February 17,2000

Ward Connerly's talk was bound to provoke thought, conversation, anger, and
even ridicule. And it did.From the embarrassing gaffe on the promotional signs
("Aff irTmative Action or Racial Discrimination?") to the palpable tension pervading LPAC Cinema on Thursday, his presentation ran the gamut of emotions.
What got me thinking, more than anything else, was his support for a classbased affirmative action program in place
of the race-based affirmative action programs of the past. A noble idea, but it addresses the wider issues of race, gender,
nationality and ethnicity in America
through a terribly narrow window.
We live in a country where one third of
all black males will be in jailbefore the age
of 30. We live in a country where women
earn significantly less than men, despite
equal job skills and experience. We live in a
country where, in faint marks under the
Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments, still lay the faint remnants
of the Three-Fifths Clause. We live in a
country where minorities make up 80 percent of those under the poverty line, yet
less than 50 percent of the total population.
To say that class can be the only outside determining factor in institutionalconsiderations of hiring and admissions is to
completely ignore the mitigating circumstances of the American socioeconomic
strata. It is reductionism at its worst, taking all of America's various perceptive ills
and shoving them under a heading that is,
at best, a symptom of a larger problem
rather than the problem itself.
Nobody is Latino/a, or Irish or female
because they are poor. But, all too often,
poverty comes as a result of those ethnic/gender/racial lines. The economic
plight of many groups can be directly related to past discrimination.WASPs are the
economic forebears of this country because they founded it and structured it.
Blacks are at the bottom of the economic
ladder because of centuries of an institution that devalued them to the point of
inhumanity. Women have been, and in many
ways continue to be, treated differently
than their male counterparts of any race
or ethnicity based entirely on their gender.
As one of our illustrious Republicans/
Conservatives felt the compulsion to shriek
at me last Thursday during the talk, there
are plenty ofpoor white people. However,
how much does their race factor into their

MICHELLE LEE

economic status, their experience in life?
How hard is it, comparatively, for a white
man with the surname Taylor to walk into
a department store and buy a watch peacefully, as compared to my "black" self?
Would he get followed and pestered by
"overly helpful" clerks? Would he get
pointed towards the less expensive
watches because he "didn't look like he
could afford it?"
I want to paint this picture in broader
strokes than academia because affirmative action is supposed to address and aid
in recognizing and fixing the larger problem also present outside of the workplace
and schools. Connerly's contention was
that class issues would be more usefulthan
race issues as an excuse to "even the playing field." The problem is that he wants to
even the playing field in the worst way
imaginable, by giving undue consideration
to relative economic levels, which may or
may not play into that person's academic
experience. There are great public and even
private schools out there that are accessible to everyone in a given community,
regardless of economic status, but are
only available to certain communities, divided by race and ethnicity.
Class is an effect of a much larger and
pervasive cause in America. By attempt-

For The Phoenix

ing to deal with something that incorporates all of America's social foibles and ignoring the underlying causes, we are attempting to feed the hungry by giving them
a nice set of china. A nice gesture and one
that, in theory, would help, all other things
being equal, but ultimately futile and useless.
Connerly believes that class-based affirmative action will help America's poor by
allowing them access to higher education,
by using their poverty as an excuse for
inferior academic performance. This was
the exact same attitude he rebelled against
when he spearheaded Proposition 209 in
California. Contradictory, confusing, and
muddled, Connerly is a man who is a figurehead for a movement he himself doesn't
understand.
The purpose of affirmative action is to
make education and jobs available to everyone, and to respect the cultural differences and diversity that make a person
more than a GPA and a set of standardized tests. Connerly's specific idea of
class-based affirmative action takes a
wrongheaded and hypocritical stance on
the matter. He ignores the issue in favor
of a program that would do little to help
anyone, except those who are against any
form of contributive affirmative action.

GUEST EDITORIAL

Fascists in control after Austrian election
Staff Editorial
The Daily Athenaeum (West Virginia Univ.)

If those who do not learn
(U-WIRE)
from history are doomedto repeat it, there
might be some serious trouble in Austria.
Tuesday, Austrian President Thomas
Klestil swore in the newly-elected government, as is the custom following the results of the general election. The problem?
The election was won by a group that includes the right-wing Freedom Party.
The Freedom Party, led by Joerg
Haider, is not your usual right-wing group.
By most accounts, they are strongly antiimmigrant, are not particularly fond of
human rights and are often referred to as
fascists and Nazis, and with good reason.
Haider has denounced the Austrians'
membership in the European Union and
bashed non-Austrians, while at the same
time praising the philosophies of Adolf

Hitler and referring to former SS officers
as "decent people of good character."
President Klestil felt that he had no
choice but to swear them into office,
though he turned down two of their cabinet appointments and refuses to allow
Haider to gain any active control of their
national government.
Meanwhile, Austria has already been hit
with a "diplomatic quarantine" by the rest
of the EU, freezing all bilateralrelations
with them and minimizing the power of
Austrian ambassadors all over Europe.
Until the situation changes and these men
are removed from power, EU President
Antonio Guterres said, "... we shall maintain this stance."
The fact that the Austrian people would
even elect these men to their positions is
a telling sign that there are problems in
Europe. The problems are not confined to
Austria either.

Germany is reportedly very upset over
the Freedom Party's rise to power, fearing that their own weakened government
might also fall prey to a Heider-type individual who would capitalize on people's
feelings for immigrants and dislike of the
European Union.
Fortunately, the rest of the world is noticing this time and is responding accordingly. It still remains to be seen, though,
if these sanctions will cause Austrians to
turn on their new government or embrace
it more heartily.
If they do choose to keep the Freedom
Party in power, something will need to be
done in order to remedy the situation
quickly. Leaving these men in power is tan-j
tamount to permitting the spread of fascism across an entire nation, and the result of allowing that kind of political ideology to fester and growis all too well known
for the world to standby and let it happen

Answering the Cry
On Location
Swarthmore College Psychological Services (Psych

Services) is located in the North Wing of the Worth Health

Center. Although Psych Services and the Health Center
share the same building, they operate separately. Nevertheless, a visit to Psych Services requires that one enter through the large lobby of Worth, where posters of
smoking giraffes hang side by side on the walls with venereal disease pamphlets. In a hallway to the left of the
entry way, a green folding partition separates the Psych
Services wing from the main lobby of the Health Center.
It ensures confidentiality by allowing those who use
Psych Services to exit the main lobby unseen.
The Psych Services area is surprisingly pleasant and
relaxing: chairs sit in thehall amidst green plants; tasteful, muted carpeting and wallsreflect light from the outside window, and soft classical music plays on a stereo.
The area includes a main office, where administrative
assistant Brigitte Hasselgrove takes phone calls and sets
up appointments, and several smaller rooms that the
psychologists use for counseling sessions. Psychologists
bustle about continually, working on computers, eating
lunch, and inviting students into their offices to talk behind closed doors.
Nine psychological services staff members work part
time; on any given day one is likely to find four counselors in the office. David Ramirez, Ph.D., licensed psychologist and directorof Psych Services, works with permanent staff Paula S. Rosen, Ph.D., Sabrina Ford, Ph.D.,
and Jack L. Solomon, M.D. The remaining counselors are
Carolyn Garret, Jack Mac Andrew, Madeline Page, Jill
Ragozzino and Allison Smenner, all the psychology
equivalent of medical residents.
The front desk of Psych Services is officially open
weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., though on some
days counselors stay late to accommodate students' hectic schedules. A secretary staffs the front desk in Worth
Health 24 hours a day, enabling students to find help even
when the psychologists themselves are not present. At
least one member of Psych Services is always on call.
While Psych Services' main focus is on free, one-to-one
counseling sessions between its trained therapists and
Swarthmore College students, it can and does refer faculty and staff to outside sources of help when necessary.
During academic year 1998-99,Psych Services helped
213 students, or 16 percent of the student population.
Forty-one students who did not have previously scheduled appointments made contact with Psych Services,
an increase of 46 percent over the previous year. Twelve
more students stayed in the infirmary, which Psych Services operates in conjuction with Worth. In last year's
graduating class, 123 seniors, or 36 percent of those
graduating, had visited Psych Services at some point in
their college careers.

No Problem Too Small
Students go to Psych Services for a variety of reasons
ranging from serious to fairly routine. Common issues
include relationship problems with significant others and
family members, academic stress, depression, anxiety,
concerns regarding sexual orientationand gender identity, as well as the perennial question of what to do with
life after Swarthmore. Students also see a counselor to
discuss problems related to alcohol and drug-use, as well
as eating disorders. A few students seek counseling on
suicide.
In addition, students grieving over the death of a family member, anxious about their midterms, or simply
seeking to escape their hallmates can retreat to the quiet
environment of the infirmary for a few days or weeks,
and sometimes convince their professors to postpone
looming schoolwork.
"Some students come to us with long-standing problems, problems they've had to work on their entire life,"
Ramirez said. "[With others] something traumatic happens, and they come in."
But whatever the nature of the concern or its duration, Psych Services is there to talk about it any time,
according to Ramirez.
"There may be some problems that can't be solved,"
Ramirez said. "But there is no problem that can't be
talked about... [A student might wonder] what kinds of
things should I come in for? The answer is anything you
want to talk about. That's enough. That's enough to bring
you in here."

Nevertheless, many of the students interviewed for
this article do not choose to avail themselves of Psych
Services.
The majority were generally uninformed about the nature of care available at Psych Services. Few knew that
they could receive free counseling by calling the Worth
Health desk. Even fewer were aware that they could
check themselves into Worth to escape the pressure of
college life.
"I've wanted to go before, but I haven't known the hours
or really what it entails," one student admitted.
But the problem is not merely a lack of information.
The social stigma involved in seeing a "shrink" is another factor that keeps some students away from the
North Wing of Worth.
"I think there's a stigma attached to Psych Services,"
one student said. "It's assumed... that only problematic,
abnormal people frequent them."
David Ramirez acknowledged these fears. "We're the
last resort for many people," he said. "Students think,
T've tried talking with my friends. I've tried working it
out in my yoga class, I've tried dancing. Nothing else
worked. I'll give you a shot.'"
"Making the decision to go to Psychological Services
is not an easy one," Ramirez added. "Once students have
made the call, they've already taken the hardest step."
The students interviewed echoed Ramirez's senti-

out forcing a single person to accept unwanted treatment.
Four students were hospitalized with the help of Psych
Services last year, but all entered voluntarily.
In extreme cases, psychologists are required by law
to prevent a patient from seriously injuring himself or
others; however, Swarthmore Psych Services has never
yet encountered a situation in which they have had to
take this step. Although Swarthmore police did force one
student who had threatened to take her own life into hospitalization last year, the borough police handled this incident, not Psych Services.

Coping With Life
For students who do seek help, Psych Services employs
a number of strategies to help them deal with their problems. Counseling sessions are typically scheduled once
a week for as long as they are needed. Students with
medical concerns are referred to a doctor, while those
with academic troubles are advised to partake of services offered by the deans, departmental tutors, Writing Associates and other forms of academic assistance
available on campus.
"Swarthmore humans are like humans everywhere,"
Ramirez said. The difference, however, is that
Swarthmore students define themselves largely by their
academic intelligence. The limitations of that, Ramirez
said, can be frustrating. The same brain power needed
to write a paper or
take an exam cannot
a^HHßi mtmmmm mmaa^ mmmm
solve everything,
and when students
confront a personal
problem they do so
not with the academic attitude of
"I'm open to this. I
can learn from this"
but rather with "I
should know how to
deal with this alPsych Services
ready. Why can't I do
this?"
The students interviewed who had undergone counseling had mixed responses.
"I did not find them helpful at all," said one junior.
"First of all, they refer you to whoever's available with
an appointment. You don't get any choice about who you
want to talk with, any idea of their background... I had a
psychologist at home, and she was much more helpful to
me. The psychiatrist there is absolutely terrible. He just
asks you what drugs you want and then lets you go."
But most other students interviewed said they personally had benefitted from Psych Services or knew someone who had. One student, who admitted that she herself
had abandoned psychotherapy to pursue inner peace
through more spiritual means, acknowledged the ways
in which counseling had helped her friends.
"I know two people who used Psych Services I am
under the impression that Psych Services helped [one of
them] a lot by giving her hope. She has 'gotten better'
since she started using them."
"I've had four or five sessions," one senior said. "I
haven't really solved my problem, but at least I know
now thatthat part of my life can't be solved, so I can deal
with it. A lot of times the psychologist gives me the same
advice as my mother. That's really irritating, but it's not
all bad. My mom's pretty smart."
Ramirez reported a high level of satisfaction with his
job. "The college supports psychological services financially That means that here at Swat, the Psych Services staff can do its work."
Over the years, Ramirez has realized that psychological counseling can make a tremendous difference in
people's lives, even if that difference isn't immediately

"There may be some problems that

can't be solved, but there is no
problem that can't be talked about."
David Ramirez, Director of
ments. Most said they would use Psych Services, but only
after first trying other options such as talking with
friends and family members, dancing, drinking, and even
praying.
"I wouldn'tfeel as comfortable around a psychologist
as I would around my friends," one student said.
"I think if I were to be in an oppressively stressful
situation, I might feel like 'I don't have the time for counseling. Gotta go to the library,'" another student asserted.
Those battling depression often resist seeing a psychologist because they fear that talking about the problem will push them closer to the edge. Ramirez stressed
that even in these cases, counseling is almost always beneficial, helping students probe their feelings and adopt
strategies to keep them under control.
A few students who did decide to use Psych Services
said they had trouble scheduling appointments.
"It took me a while to get an appointment," one student said. "If you look at their schedule, they're all booked

up."

Ramirez acknowledged that the full case-load of the
staff means students requesting routine counseling will
have to wait a week or two for their first counseling session.
"It is unusual to peak this early," said Ramirez. "Usually, peak use happens around midterms."
But Ramirez stressed that Psych Services always responds immediately to students requiring emergency assistance. Moreover, the current crush is likely to be only
temporary and has not affected many students. "There's
only three students who haven't been seen yet," he said.
Confidentiality is perhaps the largest issue for those
considering seeing a therapist, especially on this small
campus where everyone knows each other. The staff at
Psych Services do not release patient names to anyone,
not even to concerned parents and professors. In fact,
when the FBI or the Peace Corps sends them a polite
letter inquiring whether or not an applicant has had counseling, Psych services sends an equally polite form letter in return, stating that they release no studentrecords.
Contrary to the perceptions of some students, Psych
Services handled over 50 crisis situations last year with-

...

...

recognizable.
The downside, he says, is that counseling involves real
pain and discomfort. "Therapy has limitations. A person
who lost their father when they were young: you can't
give that person their father back. Or, to take a more
usual example, someone whose parents got divorced."
What, in the end, can students expect from counseling?
"You get right down to the nitty gritty of hope,"
Ramirez said. "To say that anything can happen is a kind
of lie, and it's also kind of true. Some issues that seem
unsolvable, patients can in fact make progress on."

Polish theater ensemble to present 'Ferdyduke'
By Hillary Dresser
Phoenix Staff
Next week, an internationally known theater group
from Poland will visit Swarthmore College for three days
of workshops and two weekend performances.
The group is a cooperation of two companies, the Teatr
"Provisorium" and the Kompania "Teatr," which have
been collaborating since 1996. They will perform an adaptation of the 20th century Polish novel "Ferdyduke"
by Witold Gombrowicz.

Thanks to the diligent public relations work of both
the theater group's administration and the Swarthmore
theatre studies department, the companies' reputation
precede their arrival. Students are advised to reserve
tickets as soon as possible, as the Theatre Department
expects ample interest from off campus.
"Ferdyduke" tells the story of a young writer who has
been damned by an evil literature professor to go back
to his adolescent school-days "to learn how to do it right."
The hero is met with opposition and crises at every turn.

show was nationally votedBest Production by an Alternative Theatre in Poland.
Critic Elzbieta Morawiec, praised, "It's a bold and daring performance... and, at the same time, of great beauty
that is, it contains scenes which are so strongly metaphorical that they will remain forever in the memory of
the audience. In other words, it's a great event."
Phrases like "the best," "important work," and "brilliant" surface repeatedly in reviews of the companies'
European performances.
One of the two companies that have collaborated on
this performance is the Teatr "Provisorium." Teatr
"Provisorium" is an alternative theater company that
started in the 1970s as a part of Poland's student experimental theater movement. Their debut in 1976 was a play
based on "Ferdyduke." Since then, the Teatr
"Provisorium" has become one of the best known alternative theaters in Poland and in Europe. They have received numerous distinctions, including the 1992 First
Fringe Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for their
production of "From Heaven through the World to Hell."
Over 20 years after its premiere, Teatr "Provisorium"
has no doubt polished theirtake on the "Ferdyduke" story.
The second company, The Kompania "Teatr," is a theater company that began in 1995 with three graduates of
the State University of Performing Arts. Their unique
performances have been consistently met with rave reviews and awards at numerous international theater festivals.
Both companies are based in Lublin, Poland, which is
"a leading Polish academic center in eastern Poland,"
according to Swarthmore theatre department head Allen
Kuharski, and "has traditionally been a hotbed for both
student and alternative theatre groups." The unionof the
companies brings together two directors, two ensembles,
and entirely different work styles. So far the outcome
has proven successful.
This year, Swarthmore marks the first stop of the
group's American tour. The performance on Saturday will
be the North American premiere of the companies' coproduction of "Ferdyduke." For Swarthmore, the group

the

Just three years in, the '9os got its very
best show in "Homicide: Life on the
Streets." The other nominees are invited
to please stand down; consolation prizes
will be handed out at the door.
"Homicide" (executive producers Tom
Fontana ("OZ") and "Rain Man" director
Barry Levinson), focused on a squad of
Baltimore cops trying to keep pace with
the rising tide of unsolved murders. The
show ran from Jan. 1993 to May 1999 under constant threat of cancellation. It won
three Peabodys and two Emmys and is
currently being shown in reruns on
CourtTV.
During its initial run, the NBC show
occupied a 10 p.m. Friday slot, which is to
say that it had critical acclaim and a small
but fervent band of followers. Mind you,
a lot of its recognition got misplaced onto
"NYPD Blue," the five-oh melodrama that
debuted the same year, trading on the
Steven Bochoco brand of soaped-up grit.
It drummed up controversy and ratings
with the train-wreck, circus-geek, soterrible-I-can-not-avert-my-eyes envelope
bursting of Dennis Franz's big old naked
butt.
The rawness of "NYPD Blue" was a
thing totally compromised by its sexiness
and every episode, for its so-called real-

which Kuharski has developed over the course of last
six months in close collaboration with the companies.
Given the premiere status of the performance and its
distinguished reputation, local press, including Philadelphia Weekly and City Paper, are covering the upcoming
event at Swarthmore. In addition, the theatre department
has sent out a substantial mailing to targeted Swarthmore
alumni. The group's arrival in Swarthmore should be a
widely anticipated event.
Kuharski explained the reasoning behind advertising
the show so extensively. "We basically want to increase
the level of off campus attendance and visibility for
majorperforming arts events at Swarthmore such as this
without limiting student, faculty, and staff access," he
said, "because the real cost to the college of such a performance event in the LPAC typically runs $3O-$5O per
seat
whether the seat is occupied or not. Therefore,
every empty seat at a Cooper-funded event is a net financial loss to the College as well as missed opportunity for reaching out to alums and others in the community around us."
The theatre department suspects that off-campus spectators will take full advantage of this privilege. Therefore, interested students should make every effort to
reserve tickets as soon they become available on Monday, Feb. 21. All events will occur on the mainstage of
the Lang Performing Arts Center. The week's events have
been sponsored by the William J. Cooper Foundation.

'Star Wars' special
effects guru, to speak
By Nathan AshbyKuhlman
Phoenix Staff
With the job of a
grown-up fifth grader,
Terrence Masson has a
resume just as likely to
impress your average
elementary schooler as
his own employers.
That's because the far-from-childish quality of
his computer special effects work is apparent in
all of his credits, from "Star Wars Episode I: The
Phantom Menace" to "SmallSoldiers" to his short
animated "Bunkie & Booboo," which will be shown
Friday during his three-day visit to campus.
Masson, who goes by the nickname "T-Man,"
was invited to campus in a Cooper Foundationproposal by Jane Ng 'Ol and Jordan Wales 'Ol.
Through Saturday night, he is presenting three
lectures on the use of computers as artistic media as well as the history and technology of computer special effects. The Friday night lecture will
feature multimedia.
Masson was the computer graphics sequence
supervisor for "Phantom Menace," but some of
his other uncredited work was even more widely
known; his team created the frog tongues for the
"Bud-weis-er" commercials and he was the one
who proved to Comedy Central executives that
computer animation could simulate the choppy
construction-paper look the creators wanted.

Canceled 'Homicide' gets second chance

ism and its coptalk poetry, also has the
inevitability of soft porn: hey, the crooks
are all locked up, time to play. Homer
Simpson said it best when he said, in short
sleeves and a tie, "I wish I were Sipowitz
[played by Franz]." "NYPD Blue" is what
Dads dream when they drift off in their
armchairs in the middle of "Columbo."
A couple of weeks back, President
Clinton in his State of the Union address
said that America is a nation whose
dreams still outweigh its memories. It's a
Dylan reference, I think, but it is theradiant pioneer optimism the Balto murder
cops of "Homicide" don't buy into. Their
American city is a graveyard, way overcrowded with the dead and the about-tobe-dead, and our detectives, despairing,
obsessive, funny, philosophical and a little
crazy, are deeply haunted by all the cases
they still cannot solve. That's why the best
of them aren't heroes running around firing guns, or even amazing criminal investigators; they are mediums they channel the dead, speaking uncannily for those
who can no longer speak for themselves.
In the middle of the room sat The Board,
maybe the best device ever on television;
on The Board, each detective's cases were
listed—closed cases in black, open ones
in red. The red reminded us at home and
them in the squad the way the show often
short-circuited narrative satisfaction, focusing instead on the trauma of living with
it: sometimes crimes stayed unsolved,
criminals went uncaught, and the dead lay
restlessly in their coffins, the names of
their killer caught breathless behind
closed lips.
The cast was the Super Friends ofcharacter actors: Yaphet Kotto, Richard
Belzer, Jon Polito, Daniel Baldwin, Ned

Beatty, all of them huge talents, trapped
forever on the peripheries of films, coming alive when brought to the fore. Network television we know is despicable for
its primetime whitewash, making "Homicide" exemplary not only for its troubling
disturbing dissections ofracial tension but
its incorporation of many vivid and complex African-American characters.
Among them was Lt. Frank Pembleton,
played by Emmy winner Andre Braugher.

was six zillion times better than any other
television actor at the time—and probably
in the ninety-ninth percentile of twentieth
century actors. Frank Pembleton, inhabited by Andre Braugher, was incendiary
and fiercely intelligent, equally capable of
volcanic explosions and devastating silences. The heart of the show was
unpartnerable Pembleton's difficult perfect relationship with his partner Tim
Bayliss (the gifted Kyle Secor), who
moves over the course of the series from
gullible novice to Zen veteran to bad

breakdown.

Canceled in the spring of last vear, "Ho-

micide" has been given a second chance
in the afterlife of TV movies; its first,
which revolved around the shooting of Lt.
Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto, who owns the
biggest tongue in show business), was
shown last Sunday. The two-hour movie
was moving but frustratingly diffuse: a lot
of its tension and knotty trouble gets sacrificed for token, sometimes terribly contrived, appearances by all of the major
characters in the series' history, even the
dead ones.
But it did the work it was supposed to:
it left me feeling very quiet and provided
a luminous calming coda to the best show
of the 19905. "Death goes on and on and
on," Pembleton says, to which Giardello's
son replies, "That's because life goes on
and on and on."
So the film ends the series in a place
where the dead find peace among old
friends. It may have been heaven but,
dunno, maybe it was Baltimore. Check out
"Homicide" in the place where canceled
shows find repose: in syndication. You will
not see better television anywhere at any
time.

Surreal Thai locale perfectly
contrasts scruffy Leonardo
By Morghan Holt
Phoenix Staff

Thailand is all the rage: tropically exotic, strangely mystical, intensely surreal.
What better setting for Leonardo's
scruffy, wandering traveler to bump into
an addict with a map, a lunatic who claims
to holdthe key to paradise. Bangkok is the
perfect city for Richard (played by
DiCaprio), a transient without direction,
aspiration or association. He leaves the
sensous city behind him in his search for
a supposed Utopian island. The locales
provide the perfect contrast.
Statistically, Bangkok boasts the largest per capita percentage of world's prostitutes and is home to one of the world's
most powerful drug trafficking networks.
In short, the social ills run rampant. The
distinction between the reeling Thai capital and the harmonious world, free from
the detestable societal problems, serves
to perfectly set the stage for DiCaprio's
latest flick.
Like any goodplot, Richard, after a brief
encounter with the strung-out ex-member
of the island commune, happens upon a
map. (It was left on the door of the sleazy
hotel room.) Intrigued, Richard determines to find the island and escape civilization for good. Joined by a French couple,
one of whom (Virginie Leyoden) Richard
lusts after madly, DiCaprio swims two kilometers to the island's sandy shores.
After arriving at the beach, Richard and
his French friends trek their way across
rocky precipices and fields of marijuana
farmed by the gun-toting scumbags who
lay claim to half the isle. They finally
reach the commune, which consists
mainly of men and women in their early
twenties.

JANE LIU

thton

off

There's this poster in my room that
reads: The world is simple. There's good.
There's evil. And there's Batman. That's
what the following is all about. Enjoy (and,
as always, feel free to borrow from me)!
What: "Batman No Man'sLand: Ground
Zero" (DC Comics) by Gorfinkel, Rucka,
Land and Geraci.

Background: Although Batman as a
character has always fascinated me, I admit that in general, I found the Batman
continuum comic books to be rather dull,
and I rarely read any of them. Then, last
year, something really wonderful happened. Gotham City was hit by one monster of an earthquake.
Wait! Let me explain. The wonderfulness of it all was that this event led way to
a year long marathon of some pretty incredible stories of Gotham and its inhabitants coping with the disaster's aftermath.
After trying to deal with the devastation for a few months, the U.S. Government makes the rather rash decision to
close down the city, declaring it a No Man's
Land (NML). The city's occupants were
told to evacuate, the bridges going into the
city were all bombed, and no one was allowed in or out anymore.

The premise, fundamentally William
Golding-esque, touches on the most primal aspects of humanity. If director
Danny Boyle had worked the script differently, had explored the Utopian aspects
of the Beach's community and had omitted Richard's trite video game hallucination, this might have made for a pretty
decent movie. The storyline has the potential of a modernized version of "Lord
of the Flies."
Richard is the only character in the entire film that is at all developed and even
his character leaves much to be desired.
The plot dwindled and the movie's otherwise profound statement about the evil
nature of mankind diminished until it
seemed almost trivial.
Still, "The Beach" is a movie worth seeing. If one can look past the obvious flaws
in the plot and the character development,
and refrain from comparing it to such
similar plots as "Lord of the Flies," the
film is, at the least, entertaining. Leonardo
DiCaprio gives a high quality performance as Richard, banished from the commune and forced to examine the uglier
aspects of humanity. The message of the
movie, if you can get past the initial confusion of the plot, is intense and telling:
location is virtually irrelevant and true
Utopia impossible.

Batman books revitalized by earthquake
If you're thinking right now, "Thatis the
lamest thing that I have ever heard of,"
you're not alone. A lot of people thought
that. DC Comics advertised NML as a
year-long event. They were pretty much
betting the bank on this one.
But you wanna know what? They won
—big time. A series of incredible stories,
some pretty awesome art, and the same
old Dark Knight in all new situations made
a lot of people, including me, eat their
words.

I admit that in general, I found
the Batman continuum comic
books to be rather dull, and I
rarely read any of them. Then,
last year, something really
wonderful happened. Gotham
City was hit by one monster of
an earthquake.
The NML storyline began Jan. 1999, taking off three months after the city was
officially closed. The story is of thosewho
stayed behind for reasons ranging from
illness to a perverse loyalty to the city.
The story begins with wacko villains escaping from Arkham Asylum, chaos ensues, gangs fight over territory in the broken city, and the Batman is nowhere to be

seen.
When he finally does return, it is to unfamiliar territory and without Batcave,
Batmobile, or any of those "wonderful
toys." But he made a vow, to protect the

city, and he holds to it. Gotham has been

redefined, but the contrast of good vs. evil

remains constant, as does the Bat.
This is a story of survival. It is a story
of stripping down to the essentials, and
thereby defining what is essential. The
series was set up to continue on in a
weekly manner, rotating through four different books: "Batman, Batman: Legends
of the Dark Knight, Shadow of the Bat, and
Detective Comics."
Each story arc was also handled by a
different creative team, therebyassuring
that the concept didn't go stale at any point
throughout the year.

This issue: Ground Zeroaddresses what
was happening in Gotham those three
months between closing Gotham and
when NML picks up the story. It serves
as a prequel for NML and came out halfway through last year.
The story is written in part by Greg
Rucka, who I am just loving at this moment. He thinks of the Bat just like I do
the pure obsessiveness of the World's
Greatest Detective draws us both in. And
in this way, Ground Zero plots out exactly
what the destruction of Gotham means to
the Bat and to his allies.
We find that there is no Batman without Gotham City, and Bruce Wayne is
pretty much a drag to have around when
he doesn't get his nightly fix. We also find
out that Gotham means a lot to some other
people as well people who chose not to
leave NML. Freebie: There's a new

Batgirl in town.
The book is beautifully drawn, fastpaced, and intricately crosscuts between

several subplots. This double-sized issue
left me wanting for more.
The rest: And if it does that for you too,
then try some of the other NML stories.
The first, four part story arc, "No Law and
New Order," intricately sets up the conflicts which will plague Gotham throughout the year.
The
Joker
shows up halfway
through the year,
and all of his stories are well-done
and full of chaos
and
mayhem.
Best of all, Harley
Quinn, a character originating
from the animated
series,
makes her first
appearance in
NML.
If you want,
just read the last
four issues of the
storyline,
"Endgame,"
which
Rucka
wrote. The story
arc focuses in on
the re-opening of
Gotham and i;iof a main character whichleft me in tears.
Trade Paperbacks of the entire NML
story will start appearing soon, and Rucka
has also adapted the entire storyline into
novel format. Read and enjoy!

Swimmers finish dual meet season
By Becca Howes-Mischel

Phoenix Staff

The swim team competed in their last dual meet of the
on Wednesday
1999-2000 season at Washington College
The men scraped by Washington with a finish of 108-96
while the women were just barely edged out 109-96. The
results of this late night meet put the women at 9-3 (5-2
in the conference) and the men at 7-4 (4-2 in the conference).

This win put an excellent cap on the men s swim season. The team of nine managed to pull off a season that
many thought impossible, since each swimmer can only
swim three events (including relays). Most teams have
between 16-24 swimmers so that they can fill each race
with three to four swimmers. Strength in numbers allows teams to pick up points for their depth. With two to
three men in each event, the men's team attacked
Washington's weak spots and gained the points necessary to end the season on a high note.
For the women it was somewhat disappointing to end
an excellent season with a conference loss. Going into
the meet Coach Davis told the women that this would be
a close meet in which Washington would be swimming
up to Swarthmore's level, which they did. The meet was
fast paced and edgy with some expected places lost to
Washington and some picked up in surprising races. In
the end, the women needed to win the last relay to win
the meet by a point. As Washington touched out
Swarthmore by 0.6 seconds for the win the pool area echoed with screams.
The men's meet started with the fast paced 400 medley relay. If they had not won this race, the meet would
be have essentially been lost. Although Washington
pushed at the Swarthmore team for the entire race, Brent
Wasser 'OO, Ted Sherer 'Ol, David Whitehead 'O3, and
Jason Kerensky 'O3 swam out of their minds and pulled
off the win. The pressure did not let up as John Lillvis
'O3 and Chris Bussard 'O3 wore out the Washington swimmers with a 1-2 finish in the 1000 free and then again in
the 500 free. With one swimmer hurt and out of the water, Nik Johnson 'Ol stepped up and went back-to-back
races in the 1000 and 200 free, adding to the badly needed

points. The 200 free was another close race as Whitehead sped ahead in the last lap to blow past two Washington swimmers. Sherer and Mike Dudley 'O3 dominated
the 200 IM with their 1-2 finishes. Later in the meet
Wasser, Dudley, and Paul Dickson 'OO pulled off a surprising 1-2-3 finish in the 200 backstroke. Sherer finished
the individual races by pulling ahead of the Washington
breaststrokers for a win in the 200 breast. Each of these
swims was hard fought and came down to sheer grit and
determination to finish.
Grit and determination also characterized the women's
meet. Although they lost, Swarthmore women never gave
up the meet and pulled off some amazing swims in their
attempt to best Washington. The 400 medley relay of
Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol, Natalie Briones 'O3, Alice
Bonarou 'O2, and Emily Almberg 'O3 finished the dual
meet season undefeated in the conference. Laura Fox
'O3 surprised everyone, including herself, by pulling off
a personal best time and third place finish in the 50 free
from the outside lane. Elisabeth Newcomb 'OO held on in
the 200 fly to beat out Washington in a season best and
third place finish. In the 100 free Claire Arbour 'OO and
Davita Burkhead-Weiner 'O3 let out their frustrations
about being touched out at Dickinson against the hapless Washington swimmers as they powered to a close 12 finish.
At the second break, Davis called the team together
and planned out a strategy that could keep the women's
team alive. It involved Briones, Bonarou, and Fox making sure that no Washington girl got to the wall before
them. The three women scrapped out a clutch 1-2-3finish. While the women were not able to pull off a win, this
was in no means a disappointing meet. That was especially the case for Julie Corder 'O3 and Stephanie
Tonneson 'O3 who finished their first Swarthmore swim
seasons with season bests in the 50,100 and 200 frees.
After a week and a half without competition, the swim
teams travel to Franklin and Marshall this weekend for
three days of Conference Championships. Some swimmers are going for a win, some for personal bests, some
for national cuts. After the fast swims in dual meet season, this conferences promises to be fast with tight finishes.

Indoor track and field
teams going strong
By Donald Nguyen
For The Phoenix
The Swarthmore indoor track & field team did not have
to travel far to compete in the Six-Way Challenge, which
was at home on Saturday. The atmosphere on

Swarthmore's 217-meter track was nonetheless exciting
for the Swarthmore team since they did not have to worry
about broken buses and lack of sleep, as they have
throughout this season. Consequently, here are the team's
favorable results.
Leading the charge for the women's team was Imo
Akpan 'O2, who was wearing her own spikes this time
and finished first in the 55-meter dash and second in the
200 dash. Junior Joko Agunloye performed to perfection,
finishing first in the 5,000 run and fourth in the 800 run.
Sarah Jay 'Ol had an excellent performance in the 1,500
run finishing second, which carried her into an excellent evening performance off the track as well. Karen
Lloyd 'OO came off her excellent performance at F&M
with a third place finish this week in the 5,000 run. In the
field events, Clara Fuchsman 'Ol lived up to her interview with a fourth place finish in the shot-put.
Leading the charge for the Men's Track and Field team
was Marc Jeuland 'Ol with second place finishes in the
3,000 run and 1,500 run. It seems as if he wanted to see
his last days being 20 years old go by fast. In the same
1,500 race, Jeff Doyon 'OO finished fourth. Running on a
nagging hamstring, Keith Gilmore 'Ol nevertheless finished second in the 400 dash. In his first 55 high hurdle
race ever, Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 finished fifth. Expect good
time as this hurdler gains experience. On the field, freshman Matt Rapoza finished fifth in the shot-put.
Rounding out the scoring for the men's team was the
4x400 relay team (Ntoso, Doyon, Gilmore, Kerwin Valcin
'00) with a fifth place finish.
The squad's next meet is the Centennial Conference
on Feb. 26-7 at Haverford College. Come support the
teams as they take on Haverford.

Just before 9:45 p.m. on a cold Thursday night, a dozen or so students linger
by the rose garden outside Parrish Hall.
One holds a pair of ice skates with one
hand and stretches a leg behind him with
the other.
Another stands and talks with a cluster
of people, skates slung over her shoulder

latter part of Thursday nights has begun to the cheers of a small but enthusiastic audience.
Rather than play games, Puckers participants join a line, or practice session,
depending on their skill level; tonight has
A, B and C, A being the best.
The "A-line" players, up first, take the
ice aggressively. They tangle with one
another and slap sticks; blades scrape the
ice sharply, and spectators look on intently, cheering loudly and banging on the
wooden rink barrier.
A chant of "ten, nine, eight...,"seemingly
out of nowhere, ends the session.
"It's hard out there," says one A-line
player who has exited the rink.
The B-liners follow. They play hard, get
physical and cheer. Then, after the same
chant, the C-liners the beginners
wobble onto the ice. Converging on the
puck, they scratch at it in vain and watch
it slide gently between their skates. Despite their efforts, they receive their share
of cheers. The cycle then repeats.
Gary steps off the ice with the A-line
players after their second round, his face
flushed. "It was gooood," he remarks,
panting slightly.
"Kill!" he exclaims, as theB-liners start
up. "I mean, ahh, play!"
After a third round of lines comes free
skating. With multiple pucks on the ice,
the students shoot on the goals, skate leisurely forward and back and hold hands.
By midnight, play has ended. In a
smaller, adjacent room, a woman lies on
her stomach as two people unlace the
bulky goalie pads that run the length of
her legs.
At close to 12:15, Gary carries an armful of hockey sticks from the room out to
a van and stuffs them beneath the back
seat. On top of the seat lies a pile of hockey
equipment; on top of that, a female student.
"This is really comfy," she remarks.
Soon, both vans take off for campus.
Most riders get off at Parrish, while some
continue to Wharton, where they help unload the equipment into a storage room.
"Thank you very much," Gary says
cheerfully after the gear has been stored.
He waves to the others, and they head off.
For his part, Gary seems tired. Tonight

Men's b-ball attempts to salvage season vs. Haverford
By Ben Park

Get ready Swarthmore fans, the game of the
season is upon us.
On Saturday, at 8 p.m. in Tarble Pavilion, two
basketball squads representing two of the top liberal arts colleges in the nation will meet.
Haverford is 1-10 in the Centennial Conference
and 3-19 overall. Swarthmore is (2-9; 3-19). Eighty
years and 137 games stand between these teams.
For seven seniors, it will be the last game of their
career. This is the tale of two teams on a collision
course with the full force of destiny behind them.
One might expect that Swarthmore is the favorite in this contest. Haverford has dropped its
last nine games, and Swarthmore won the last
battle 65-58 at Haverford. Sophomore guard
Michael Jeffries called it "thebest part of the season." On top of this, Haverford's second leading
scorer, Chris Riley, will most likely not be appearing on the court this Saturday.
However, the Garnet are not running on all cylinders either. lwo key players,Kyle Lewis 'O2 and
senior co-captain Joe Culley, are questionable for
the season finale. If they are not able to play, a

Swarthmore victory will depend on the contributions
of its reserves. "Some people will have to step up,"
said sophomore guard Isaac Cohen.
Yet, thereare several intangibles that will likely lead
Swarthmore to victory over the Fords. First, there is
the fact that the excitement and energy that the fans
fromboth schools bring with them always charges up
our Garnet Tide. Next, Swarthmorehas not lost in five
years against theFords at home. Finally, as Cohen put
it, this game hasbeen the "culmination offive months
ofhard effort."
In other news, the Garnet faced two of the top teams
in the Centennial Conference this week. On Feb. 9,
they played Johns Hopkins (8-3; 16-6;2nd in western
division) and lost 73-49. Swarthmore managed to start
the game making 40 percent of their shots from the
field, yet still trailed at the half by 13. Culley and center David Gammill 'O2 both scored 10 to lead the Garnet.

On Saturday, Swarthmore traveled to the Palestra,
home of the Penn basketball team, to take on the
UrsinusBears (8-3; 16-6; Ist in eastern division). The
Garnet played a decent game, and guard David Pearce
'O3 managed 18points. Yet, the Garnet could not keep
up as the Bears came out hot, shooting 52 percent in
the second half to win 73-56.

responsibility for their own lax alcohol
policies.
All and all, DU has been pinned for some
events that were not even slightly related
to the fraternity or any of its members.
No members of DU have jumped out any
windows, yet some have linked them with
that embarrassing incident. I've heard
they were responsible for the InterculturalCenter incident, which is entirely erroneous. I mean, when one of the violinplaying freshman lushes gets drunk and
throws up in Willets, the RAs seek out a
frat boy/football player to blame.
Meanwhile, very positive activities that
DU is a part of, such as the blood drive,
go largely ignored. They also throw some
(read: most or all) of the better parties on
campus, giving me and many Swatties a
just cause to fight for when we're grabbing by the tail the dragon that is
microeconomics.

I believe that the committees and bureaucracies will make the right decision
in regard to the future of athletics at our
school. In regard to the current situation,
I believe it would be better for all if we
learned to co-exist without slinging accusations. If you've never met one of the DU
guys, don't believe the hype. They're not
disrespectful to women, thieves or morons. And if you take the number of rumors you've heard about their sadistic depravity and divide that figure by about a
thousand, thenyou might have some truth.
Stop the self-fulfilling prophecies that
come with preconceived notions.
In closing, drop your preconceived notions about DU, many of which I believe
come from high school, and give each individual member a chance. They didn't get
in solely because of their football or lacrosse skills. They're here for manyother
reasons. One of them is that they're all
good guys.

clinches playoff berth

Ursinus Bears, winning decisively, 66-34.

(The score of Swat's first win over Ursinus
was 84-76 ending in double overtime.) This
triumph was a veritable team effort as all

healthy membersof the squad contributed
to Garnet Tide success. This second and
more convincing romp of the Ursinus
squad was lead by Kile's 19 points and 14
rebounds and teammate Tufano's 18points
and six boards. Christina Ciambriello 'O2
displayed an infallible offensive performance amassing eight points. She went 33 from the floor and 100 percent from the
charity stripe. Kristen English 'Ol dominated the defensive end holding Ursinus'
point guard, Jackie Cooper, to just three
points. The Garnet women out-rebounded
their opponents 49-24 in their dominating
attack. This win guaranteed not only a conference playoff slot, but it has also proved

that this team has seriously honed its
game since a brief but significant January slump.
Swat hosted another game against the
Muhlenberg Mules on Wednesday. The
Mules barely edged out the Garnet 44-41,
but this loss does not affect the
Swarthmore's berth in the playoffs. The
women will host their last regular season
game this Saturday, Feb. 19 in Tarble Pavilion against the old rivals, the Haverford
Fords. Come down and see what these
women are all about, and witness for yourself the team that has everyone talking.
This squad can play with any team in the
league and looks to validate its top position in the Centennial Conference with a
fine showing in the playoffs. There is
nowherefor these women to go but up, as
they look to elevate their game to an even
higher level in their first playoff game on
Wednesday.

Garnet get first playoff trip ever
By Christina Ciambrieilo
and Caitlin Ryland
Phoenix Staff
The Swarthmore women's basketball

team is officially headed for the Centen-

nialConference playoffs for the first time
in the school's history. The ladies clinched
a playoff berth after their routing of
Ursinus College last Saturday. It is an exciting time for the Garnet squad as they
look to lift the program to unprecedented
heights.
The women displayed theirballing ability in two fine showings last week against
Ursinus and Johns Hopkins. Although the
women did not get the win over Hopkins,
they made it a game, which is more then
any Swarthmore team has been able to
offer in years. The women battled the en-

tire game with the conference leader and
held their own letting the ladies at Johns
Hopkins know exactly what's up in the
league. Swarthmore is no longer just a
"smart" school these girls can play and
they mean business. The women wiped out
Ursinus 66-34 to round out the week.
Swarthmore could not close the gap
against a feisty Johns Hopkins squad last
Wednesday in Baltimore and fell to the
Blue Jays
Once the invincible and
untouchable top seed of the conference,
Hopkins was feeling the heat at halftime
as the Garnet felt confident for a strong
second half.
A victory was well within reach as the
Tide trailed their opponent 24-20 at the
halfway point in the game. Plagued with a
poor shooting percentage both from the
field and from the free throw lineand poor

rebounding, the Swat women could not
convert the win. Heather Marandola 'Ol
and Heather Kile 'O2 each contributed
nine points and Sarah Tufano 'O3 and
Kristen English 'Ol each had eight points
for the Garnet.
In the second half of the contest, Caitlin
Ryland 'O2 tore her anterior cruciate ligament and will be out of commission for
the remainder of the season. She plans to
have surgery over spring break. On a
more positive note, Pam Lavallee 'O3, who
suffered a serious ankle sprain suffered
earlier in the season, is expected to return
for this Saturday's home contest against
Haverford.

Defending DU
If a member of SWIL decided independently to start stealing trays from
Sharpies, would we persecute and condemn him or her? Would Al Bloom and
Jennie Keith form committees to evaluate the value of imagination at
Swarthmore? If I had stolen the license
plates from around campus, would there
be an article in the Phoenix, "Rumors link
stolen license plates to Phoenix sports,
College Dems, Learning for Life and wrestling team?"
The answer to these questions, of
course, is no. The recent license plate
scandal that has hit Delta Upsilon has
been, in fact, ridiculous in the manner that
rumors linking individual members have
led to an investigation of the fraternity.
Let's lay out an important fact. Some
members ofDelta Upsilon (DU) did in fact
steal the license plates. This we know. I
know it; Al Bloom, Tedd Goundie and Public Safety know it. But DU president Paul
Willenberg 'OO should never have had to
answer a single question about it.
While individual members of DU were
involved, the fraternity brothers by no
means had a secret meeting and decided
to steal the license plates. An investigation of DU resulted because rumors automatically associated the actions of members of DU withthose of the entire group.
The fact that campus rumors, Tedd
Goundie and Public Safety were all on
DU's tail about the license plate thefts
shows something deeper about
Swarthmore's culture. There are many of
us here who have never participated in
athletics and reject it without giving it
consideration.
I'm not going to sit here and pretend I'm
a zealot in favor of turning Swarthmore
into Rice. Rice could very well be ranked
No. 1 in the nation, ahead of the CalTechs
and Harvards of the world, ifthey decided
to forego maintaining a competitive Division I athletic program.
This article draws deeply on personal
experience. I feel like I have a unique perspective on athletics at Swarthmore, having seen the situation from many different angles. I was a recruited athlete. I am
an athlete who has come from a very
strong high school program to a mediocre at best wrestling team here. I know
many of the members of DU and hang out
with them. I also know some of the more
imaginative personalities on campus, and
enjoy my time with them. Sometimes the
conflict between the two makes me cry
out, "Can't we all get along?"
We can. I play a sport, have a math/physics/technical theatre girlfriend from the
flip side, and possess an affinity for Foucault and Baudrillard.
There are many cases to be made
against furthering the cause of athletics
at Swarthmore. Having lowered the quality of personalities on our campus is not
one. Visit Willets first south some day.
Meet some of the sophomores.
DU does need to assume responsibility
for fiascos like Margaritaville last spring,
when a number of students were arrested
for underage drinking. But even that was
hardly their fault. Underage drinking is
as common at Swarthmore as Shaquille
O'Neal missing a free throw. It happens
everywhere, including Paces. Ifanything,
Swarthmore should have accepted responSee CHAN, pg. 19
