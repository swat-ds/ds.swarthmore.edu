Sexual assaults lead to questions of justice
BY lAN YARETT AND JACK KEEFE
iyarettl@swarthmore.edu and
Jkeefel@swarthmore.edu
The prosecution of a series of sexual assault cases that
was stopped short when the alleged offender left
Swarthmore has raised concerns about how the college handles such cases.
Multiple female Swarthmore students reported to the
administration last November that they were sexually
assaulted by the same individual, a mutual friend, within
the space of a few days. According to one victim of these
assaults, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the case, the victims had a meeting with
Assistant Dean and GenderEducation Advisor Karen Henry
'B7 and Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal to
explore their options.
After the meeting one victim chose to pursue a College
Judicial Committee hearing against the alleged perpetrator.
The hearing was cancelled once the alleged perpetrator did
not come back to the college this semester. According to the
victim, the meeting was planned because the victims wanted some action on their case. "We chose to put ourselves
through this so we can have something happen, and if things
don't happen through the CJC, I know I did everything I
could have done, but it will also feel like I put myself through
hell for nothing," she said prior to the cancellation of the
CJC hearing.
The victim expressed frustration with the perceived
hands-off attitude of the administration towards their case.
"In the whole situation, you end up feeling powerless anyway, and the school didn't help that situation at all," she
said. "They made sure that we knew that we were okay with
the fact that we didn't have to do anything. At the very least
we didn't feel pushed into action. We chose to put ourselves
through this so we can have something happen."

According to Westphal, Karen Henry's role is to explain
all of the options, even if a victim comes in saying that
they've already decided how to proceed. "Sometimes, that
might feel like a non-supportive statement for what you
think you want to do," Westphal said.
Henry said that the first steps taken when a student who
has been sexually assaulted comes to a dean depends on how
long ago the assault occurred and whether the student might
need immediate medical attention. "For instance, if the
assault had happened this morning, and the victim had not
taken a shower, I would talk with them about going to Worth
[Health Center] or having a rape kit done at the hospital,"
she said. "Depending on how they are when I first see them,
I usually lay things out in the first [counseling] session
how they might want to resolve their situation and what

their options are."
In the first session, Henry said she tries to make sure victims have all the information they need and provides support. After that, she goes over the ways through which the
situation might be resolved.
According to Swat Survivors Co-Facilitator and Sexual
Misconduct Advisors and Resource Team member Nicole
Belanger 'OB, victims of sexual assault have a variety ofmedical, counseling and disciplinary options available to them.
Medical action can involve either going to Worth, where
birth control options such as Plan B are offered in addition
to STD tests and other services, or to Chester Crozer hospital, which offers rape kits through which evidence is collected that could be used in court should the victim decide to
press charges.
Between one and three students come to the health center each semester needing Plan B as a result of sexual
assault, according to Director of Health Services Beth
Kotarski. "If you choose to go to the hospital, someone from
Women Against Rape will come and stay with you,"
Belanger said. "The hospital also contacts the police, who

ask questions, but the victim does not have to answer and
has the advocate [from WAR] there with them for support."
Counseling options on campus are offered by many individuals and groups, including the SMART team, Swat
Surviviors, CAPS and Henry. "At SMART, we really try hard
to bend over backwards to make things are as easy for [victims] as possible
we try not to let victims feel alone,"
Belanger said.
Within the realm of disciplinary action, options for victims range from doing nothing to seeking a CJC trial or contacting the police.
According to Belanger, victims sometimes choose to confront their assailant in a way that doesn't necessarily
involve disciplinary action through a facilitated discussion
moderated by one of the deans. Others choose to communicate with their assailant through e-mail or letters.

After the meeting with the deans, one victim in this case
decided to pursue a CJC hearing and also filed a report with
the police. At that time, approximately one month had
passed since the assault.
The CJC hearing was scheduled for early this semester,
but was recently called off since the alleged perpetrator did
not return to campus after winter break, according to the
victim.

According to Westphal, there are times when someone
commits an act and for whatever reason decides to leave the
college, or is given that option by the college. "However, if
they ever decide to return, there might be a CJC trial waiting for them," she said. While an individual can be tried by
the CJC if they are abroad or on a leave of absence, as long
as they can be given a chance to represent themselves
(whether by coming back to the college, sending in a statement, or participating in a conference call), an ihdividual
cannot be tried if they have withdrawn from the college.

LPAC dance rehearsal space to favor dance majors and minors
Terpsicore, Rhythm-n-Motion to find new space where they can practice consistently, including Upper Tarble and Tri-Co
BY YINGJIA WANG
ywangl@swarthmore.edu
The tussle for rehearsal space between
the college's extra-curricular dance groups
and its dance students approaches a potential solution this semester. The dance
department is implementing a new space
reservation system that will give priority
to students of the department.
Citing a significant increase in the number of dance majors and minors this semester, Director of the Dance Program Sharon
Friedler explains that the dance studios in
the Lang Performing Arts Center are for
curricular, rather than extra-curricular,
activities "first and foremost."
As a result, dance groups on campus

such as Rhythm-n-Motion and Terpsichore
will no longer have easy access to rehearsal spaces in LPAC.
"In the past, there were sign up sheets
outside the studios, anyone could just sign
up. The problem occurred when there was
an increasing number of majors and
minors who were blocked out of rehearsal
space by people who may have a really
strong extra-curricular interest, but who,
however, are not being graded on the work
they do in the studios," Friedler said.
Starting this semester, non-curricular

students wishing to reserve space may do
so on a weekly basis through the dance
department's administrative assistant,
who has the master schedule for the
department's spaces.
Rhythm-n-Motion co-Director Carmella
Ollero 'O9, who has also participated
extensively in Terpsichore but is not a
member of that group's leadership,

THE PHOENIX

explained Rhythm-n-Motion's reaction to
the change.
"I think, as a group, we were definitely
surprised. I guess we've taken for granted
that we've been offered a space on an informal level, so the whole thing was kind of a
shock. But I think the whole group understands why this has happened," Ollero

said.
Both extra-curricular dance groups on
campus and the dance department have
met with members of the college administration to find possible solutions to the
space problem. According to Ollero, members of the Rhythm-n-Motion executive
board spoke with deans Myrt Westphal,
Darryl Smaw and Raphael Zapata.
"We talked to the deans at the end oflast
semester to see the precedent for this decision and to get ideas on what to do for this
semester," Ollero said.
"The deans were very receptive. One
benefit of going to them is that they're very
much on our side to get [new] space, so
when [the topic of finding new rehearsal
space] comes up in meetings they'll be supportive of us," she said. Recognizing that
no easy solution is on the horizon,-Rhythm-

n-Motion is already discussing moving
rehearsals off of the Swarthmore campus.
According to Ollero, the group may capital-

ize on its Tri-Co status by holding some
practices on the Haverford and Bryn Mawr
College campuses.
Friedler has also met with President Al
Bloom, Provost Constance Hungerford and
Vice President for Facilities and Services
Stu Haiti to discuss alternative practice
spaces for extra-curricular dance groups.
One popular idea is Upper Tarble.

David Mai Phoenix Staff

Starting this semester, dance majors and minors will be given preference in reserving
dance studios in the Lang Performing Arts Center, leaving extracurricular dance groups
to make alternative arrangements.

"We've been asked to look for spaces
that won't interfere with academic or athletic programs, and Upper Tarble's one of
those spaces," Hain said.
According to both Friedler and Hain,
Upper Tarble is a viable option because it
has a sprung wooden floor that is safe and
appropriate for dancing. Unfortunately,
Upper Tarble does not have mirrors, but
that problem may be resolved by purchasing portable mirrors for use in the space. In
addition, Upper Tarble is already a popular
space for extra-curricular groups and as a
performance venue, so scheduling for the
space will become even tighter with the
addition of dance groups.

January 31, 2008

Hain mentioned another possible solution as renovating some of the other spaces
on campus, such as an old wrestling room
in Tarble Pavilion that is currently used by
martial arts groups.
Hain also emphasized the need to identify both long term and short term solutions.
"The next couple of semesters might be
a struggle, but we'll keep working at the
solution. As long as people work together
and stay flexible, we'll solve most of the
problems," Hain said.
"We won't solve all of them, however,
because space will continue to be less available," Hain said.

"Beverly"
Helena
Warren, a card swiper and
former cook at Sharpies,
passed away on Monday,
January 21, 2008. Beverly,
known to many as Ms.
Beverly, was 62 years old.
The Warren family will
be holding a memorial service for the longtime college
employee at the First United
Methodist Church today. A
photograph of Warren sits
on a desk at the front
entrance of Sharpies, along
with a letter announcing
her passing and a box for
people to convey their condolences to her family.
Director
of Dining
Services Linda McDougall
met Beverly 17 years ago,
when McDougall first started working at Swarthmore.
"She was a really wonderful
person," McDougall said.
"She'll definitely be a person that we'll miss, a smile
that we'll miss around

here."

In an e-mail, McDougall
said, "Beverly was a faith-

met her son, who is the
same age as Klein's nephew.
"Every Sunday when we
would go to work, I would
look at her and say, Another
Sunday,' and she would look
at me and say, 'Yep, another

health committee is a special case because
it needs to be completely filled with six to
eight people. "We are trying to assemble a
diverse group of students to really help
Beth give student feedback to Worth,"
Erskine said. "The goal is to get a greater
student voice at Worth."
Erskine also described the difficulties
involved with appointments. "One of the
troubles we have with student appointments is to generate the publicity. We send
e-mails through different groups but also
hope people check the Web site," he said.
Erskine said the application processes are

"There has been a lot of frustration in
the past after students make proposals [for
receiving money for activities] and faculty
later ask for revisions. This committee will
help streamline the process," Gardner said.
He believes that putting proposals through
a committee will allow faculty to ask questions and give constructive criticism before
all the effort is put into final proposals and
they are submitted. Udekwu added that, "It
is a way for students to get input immediately instead of having to wait."
The Student Health Advisory Council
will be used as a way to open dialogue
between students and Worth Health
Center. Regarding the new health committee, Udekwu said, "The new one with
[Director ofHealth Services Beth Kotarski]
is literally just being started now and is
still taking applications."
"The health committee will be giving
input on how to improve health services

Gardner said. "Beth will get input provided from the committee. I think Beth is fantastic and eager to get student input and to
actively get the student body's opinions."

"We talked about the structure by
which recommendations could be implemented and how we might have accountability," Everbach said. Some accountability measures the committee discussed
include an external review committee to
see if benchmarks are being met, an internal committee within the college, a staff
position to ensure recommendations are
good and are being implemented well or
possibly a hybrid of the aforementioned
ideas.

The initial discussions remained on the

topic of the process with which the committee will work. "Before we get to recommendations we want to make sure our
envisioning of the process will be entertained by administrators, to know that we
will not make recommendations that will

be dead on arrival," Everbach said.
"Recommendations will not be a surprise
and will be pre-vetted so they are feasible.
That does not mean they will not be expensive or bold but they will be possible."
The hope of the SustainabilityPlanning
Committee is to make recommendations
and hand them up through higher committees with the hope that they add their
input. The new committees all hope to get
a foot in the door this semester and begin
to help the community in ways not previously considered.

For some students: many options, not enough action
From ASSAULT, p. 3
"I guess what shocks me the most is that
people [can get] suspended or expelled for
plagiarism, but for sexual assault I guess
the last CJC hearing decision that was
made was a 2-3 split and he was found not
guilty," the victim said.
The victim was extremely happy with

the support she received from the SMART

team. "[Our SMART team member] was

with us every step of the way, she came
with us to the Deans Office, she came with
us when we went to Worth."
"It makes all the difference if you come
when you're needed," she continued. "I
know that if we hadn't called [a SMART
team member], we might have lost our
nerve and not have talked to anyone
it's
like the first jumping off point. Karen
Henry is also wonderful with victim support."
"My major concern was that I think that
this kid. needs some serious counseling,
and they seemed to think that not only
could that not happen, that they were not
inclined to see that happen, and we got the
feeling that unless we had to bring this forward, that the school and everything would
go on like normal," the victim said.
In taking a proactive step toward an inschool resolution of this crime, however,
the victim was not necessarily expecting
an immediate condemnation of the individual by the school, per se. Rather, she said
that she wanted her actions to lead to a full

investigation of the charges

-

not just for

herself, but for the accused as well.
"If you tell the school something like

that, then they have somewhat of a respon-

sibility to the other students to at least
you know,
check it out or investigate it
just for the safety of everyone," she said. "I
don't want them to immediately condemn
[the perpetrator]; I don't think that's fair,
but I do think it is fair to [demand a psychological evaluation of] the perpetrator,
whether he's guilty or innocent, in that it
doesn't impede anything."
"Say I went to the deans and I told them
what happened ... but both of us decided we
didn't want to press charges. I still think it
would be helpful for the college to say, 'No
matter what you guys do, we're going to

look into this.' It was basically
we do
something or nothing happens," she said.
Julia Berthet 'lO, who attended one of
the meetings the victims had with the
deans, said that she was concerned that
there is a tendency in cases like this to
assume that the incident is isolated and
that it won't happen again. "[The victims]
realized when they talked to each other
that this is not something that happens
once and goes away," she said. "I think that
raising awareness about sexual assault on
this campus can stop it from happening."
"I don't see the administration taking a
strong stance that if you assault someone,
it will go on your permanent record, you
will be put on academic probation, this will
happen, this will happen, and this will happen," Berthet said. "No one wants to be
scared all of the time 'oh no I might be

but they should be
aware and build this into their weekend
habit [to] be on their guard and not act
without complete certainty."

...

Westphal pointed to ASAP workshops,
sexual health counselors, the Clothesline
Project and safer sex workshops as ways
the college tries to prevent sexual violence.
"I think there is a lot of education that is

here by both staff and students,
but we can't control who comes and who
doesn't come to those workshops,"

THE PHOENIX

Westphal said. In fact, the Dean's office has
discovered that some people who have been
accused of sexual assault did not attend
those workshops, Westphal said.
However, some close to the individual
case believe that an additional degree of
awareness of sexual assaults as they occur
and as they pertain to the campus is necessary for any significant change, either to
the number of assaults that occur or to how
they

are treated.

"I was talking to Karen Henry about this,
and she said that there's a possibility of
putting a note on his transcript. However,
the note would be on the back of the transcript, not on the front, and only the front
of the transcript gets photocopied and sent
to the school in case of a transfer," she said.
This principle can extend to decisions
issued by the CJC. A punishment can be
non-notational, wherein the record can
only be accessed by the school and is essen-

post-graduation.

a given punishment can be
notational, meaning it will stay filed with a
student's transcript and can be revealed if
someone inquires as to an individual's

school applications (specifically medical

school). Westphal identified non-notational
punishments as being significantly more
common than notational punishments.
In addition, in some instances cases
involving two different accounts of the
same event wherein there is no clear evidence either way can pose an issue, either
for a declaration of guilt or innocence. "In
some cases, we really don't know
we
have no way of telling which one is telling
the truth," Westphal said.
...

"Although I understand my role as a student or whatever, I don't know the whole
inner workings of the administration I
also see that at least, sitting on the outside,
I feel that the reason they don't want to do
something is to protect Swarthmore's
image," said Hoa Pham 'lO, a friend of a victim. "Not mentioning this is not making us
...

feel safer."
She also expressed exasperation as to
how the rumor system of the campus functions in relation to these cases
that, frequently, unattached details of a given
assault may find their way to the campus
body that may distort the actual facts of a
case. However, in the current situation,
Pham said, these rumors are one of the few
ways to be aware of when to be most on
-

guard.
A CJC member who asked to remain
anonymous due to concerns about commenting on the issue given their position
believed that there were ways to go about
"getting [information on sexual assault
cases] out to the people without violating
anonymity and confidentiality."
"That's the first step to having a community that is safer
it has to be recognized that it happens," she said.
The CJC member also expressed disappointment over the way in which cases
...

sexual assault had been handled
by the body in the past. "If you ease up on
the penalty because of the level of alcohol
[the accused] had in them at that moment,
that shouldn't be in my idea [something
that gets them off the hook]," they said.
Some concern also exists as to the status
of an individual accused of a serious crime
prior to any hearing that may or may not
later occur. Westphal indicated that the
school can take cautionary actions prior to
a CJC hearing, such as requiring an individual to temporarily move his or her place
of residence if they live in campus housing.
"Would you be comfortable if your children went to a school where the guy who
raped them came back in time to graduate?
[lf I were assaulted,] I shouldn't have to
transfer," a survivor and friend of the victim said. "In the real world, if a rapist is
caught, he's going to sit in jail, even before
the trial happens, he's going to sit in jail...
there's no walking the streets in the real
involving

world," she said.
According to the victim, the perpetrator
will likely be able to get away from this
with hardly even a note on his transcript.

Furthermore, the relative power of the

"guilty" verdict (i.e. how many CJC members called for such a verdict) could positively or negatively influence the magnitude of a given punishment for a given
charge. Given two cases with identical
charges but wherein one was presented with
which a more solid amount of evidence, "the

one we would be more sure of the decision...
the fact that we felt more sure about one
than the other because we had concrete evidence, we may or may not take that into
account with the punishment," she said.
"The majority of the people I see choose
not to use the CJC or go to the police,"
Henry said. "Most people who come to me
even in the most egregious situations
choose not to move forward in charging
assault."
While Henry said some individuals do
call the police and press charges, or pursue
a CJC hearing on campus, there are also
many reasons why people choose not to.
"It's a difficult process to go through
each person has to decide whether they
want to go through that," Henry said.
According to Henry, people often find it
hard to tell their stories to anyone, let
alone strangers; although some people do
feel empowered by doing that, for many it
is an intimidating process. "It's a lot of
information to take in at once
victims
are often overwhelmed coming in the
door," Henry said. "If a person can't decide,
I make sure they have enough information
to make a decision, but I can't make a decision for them. I will support them in any
I have gone to the
option they choose
police with victims and testified in court
for them."
According to Swarthmore Borough
Police Chief Brian Craig, the police's first
response to allegations of sexual assault
depends on the length of time between the
incident and when the report is made. "The
first priority is the safety of the individual," he said. "If [a sexual assault] is reported a month later
there's generally much
less we can do about that."
Not all cases brought to the police are
prosecuted, according to Craig, and in general the victim is given the right to make
that choice. "We can't force people to prosecute, except under certain situations such
as in certain domestic abuse cases, or in
cases where witnesses may have been

January 31, 2008

intimidated," Craig said. "We also would
likely not press charges where it could further traumatize the victim."
Craig noted that the statute of limitations for how long after the incident sexual
assault cases can be prosecuted depends on
the specifics of the crime usually five to
seven years or more. The Swarthmore
Police have not had any sexual assaults
brought to them beyond that timeframe.
While Craig said that two or three month
old cases are more commonly reported,
there is still not much that can be done at
that time in terms of prosecution, since
physical evidence is not recoverable and
the memory and availability of witnesses
may have declined.

However, this is not always the case.
Craig said that the police department had
one case several years ago that was report-

ed about a month and a half after it
occurred and resulted in successful prosecution. Other cases like this, though rare,
do exist.
"We understand that victims [of sexual
assault] go through a range of emotions,
but it is helpful to us to deal with it right
after it happens," he said. Craig said that
the police talk to SMART team members to
keep them informed "about what we do, but
not to change what they do."

"[The victims] realized
when they talked to each
other that this is not
something that happens
once and goes away."
Julia Berthet 'lO
"A lot of sexual assault cases also
involve abuse, which impacts the memory
of people and their recollections," Craig
said. Depending on the circumstances,
underage drinking might be a factor as
well, although Craig said that victims who
have brought their case to the police have
never been cited for underage drinking.
"Our primary concern is for the well
being of the victim," Craig said. "We only
have one female police officer, but generally we contact Women Against Rape and ask
them to have a counselor present during

police interviews."
According to Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave, anyone on campus desig-

nated as a campus security authority,
including deans, Public Safety employees,
health center employees, RAs, SMART
team members and others, can report sexual assaults they learn of through a simple
online form, in accordance with the Clery

Act requirements.
Only statistical information is needed to
no information that idenfill in the form
tifies the victim, and these statistics are
compiled each year and made available
through the Clery annual report, also
available on Public Safety's Web site. Some
other types of crimes that occur on campus
are reported in this way as well.

"So long as the [campus security
authority] believes that someone believes
that [an assault] occurred, they report it,"
Redgrave said. In addition, Westphal said
that the deans are bound to pass on any
crime explicitly reported to them to Public
Safety to be included in the Clery statistics,
although no details of the crime outside of
its class are included in their notes to
Public

Safety.

Students bring language instruction to district schools
When the local school board cut funding for foreign language classes, students stepped in to fill the gap

Hena Choi Phoenix Staff

Jiuxing Xie and Kazuo Uyehara teach a Chinese class in the Wallingford-Swarthmore school district, where public elementary schools were forced to eliminate foreign language
instruction this year due to budgetary constraints.
BY ROSARIO PAZ

rpazl@swarthmore.edu

Although most introductory education courses allow
for classroom observation fieldwork as part of the class, a
new pedagogy workshop class being taught by professor of
French Carina Yervasi is allowing students to actively
engage in teaching non-English languages in which they
are fluent at Swarthmore Rutledge School and Nether
Providence Elementary School as part of an after-school
language program.
According to Yervasi, the new course is "a way for students who know a language, or who are learning a language, to be able to use that and participate in the larger
community in which they live. I also think, pedagogically,
it's really great for children to learn other languages and

learn about other cultures because it opens their horizons
at a very early age."
Previously, both elementary schools had implemented
other language programs into the school's curriculum.
Foreign language programs within the public schools of
the Wallingford-Swarthmore school district were either
"eliminated" or "replaced with some other program" that
was part of a "curricular decision," according to Yervasi.
"I was shocked to find out that there was no foreign language program. The Home and School Assocation, basically the PTA of the Parents-Teachers Association, were having a meeting about how to get the foreign language program back at the elementary school," Yervasi said.
With the help of financial support from the school district and advice from Farha Ghannam of the Sociology and
Anthropology Department, Sibelan Forrester of the
Modern Languages and Literature Department and Lisa
Smulyan from the Education Department along with her
colleagues in the Modern Languages Department, Yervasi
was able to successfully organize the current course.
"[Lisa] encouraged me to try and put together a foreign
language pedagogy course to help the students to teach at
the schools She totally supported me," Yervasi said.
The after-school program allows students of the college
to sign up to teach one of the seven languages currently
being taught within the Modern Languages Department.
...

THE PHOENIX

Students at the elementary school, with the help of their
families, then sign up for the language they want to learn.
Although students are not required to have taken previous education courses or have any formal teaching experience, students are not always guaranteed to be able to
teach because of the varying popular demands for each
language. "Two students signed up to teach Russian, but
there weren't enough students to run a class," Yervasi said.
The teaching component of the course is strictly held as
an after school program from 3:30 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. Students
taking the course for the whole semester are only required
to do a teaching session once a week, but those taking the
course for a half semester must prepare for two weekly
teaching sessions.

"The classes started [last Monday] and the kids go
Mondays and Wednesdays or Tuesdays and Thursdays,"
Karen Minyety 'OB, one of the students responsible for the
Spanish sessions, said. "It went well. A few of them
brought their notebooks home to show how they know
Spanish. They were asking each other their names.
They're catching on pretty quickly, I think."
"It was a lot offun. The kids looked like they were having fun and us teachers were also having fun. There were
a lot of kids, but because there were four teachers we were
able to manage the class pretty we 11... We just started with
the basics
and the kids really caught on. We thought
they would be pretty shy about it and not speak up but they
were definitely willing to try It was great," Rita Kamani
'OB, another student in charge of the Spanish sessions, said.
In addition to the teaching component, students must
attend one of the pedagogy workshop classes available
either Thursday evenings or Friday afternoons.
"I decided to take the class because I like working with
younger students and I'm really enthusiastic about learning Chinese and the importance of learning a non-western
language, in particular because Chinese is going to become

ing communicative method and "natural approach" teaching strategies. For their first week of teaching, students
were given an example lesson plan that would introduce
the students to basic greetings in their respective languages.

"[The student teachers] must always speak in the foreign language. Clearly, if the student is about to burst into
tears, they can use English. It's about using a communicative method... to give the students the most exposure to the
target language as possible. I teach them how to use this
method, based on what is called a "natural approach' how
to learn the way they have learned their own language,"
-

Yervasi said.
The idea that students must teach their languages without the use of English stems from the hopes of providing a
simulation of complete language immersion, similar to
that of language ledges done at language programs at
Middlebury College and other intensive foreign language
programs.
"[ln having complete language immersion] I think it
has the potential to be more frustrating, but I also have
seen people who have learned languages using too much
English have a hard to time learning when people speak
more quickly or when they use words you don't know. But
if you get more used to learning a language by immersion
it seems to be more useful. If it works, I think it's a useful

technique," Flamm said.
"I think the advantage with Spanish is that there are a
lot of cognates, a lot of words that sound similar in English
and Spanish. We've made an active effort to choose the
words that sound similar
I think that if we just threw
them in a classroom... and we didn't provide them with the
tools to try and connect with the language, that would have

been much different," Kamani said.
Students interested in the new pedagogy class are
encouraged to ask about the possibility of signing up for
the second half of the semester, or upcoming semesters
thereafter. With the support of the Education Department
and the Modern Languages Department, the class will likely continue to be available for those students interested in
providing a positive language learning experience for
schoolchildren within the community.

them."
Even though Nyombayire was only eight at the time,

Stephanie Nyombayire, a co-founder of the Genocide

American Prospect Editor in Chief Robert Kuttner to speak at the college regarding US economic crisis
Robert Kuttner, recipient of an honorary degree from the College, will present a lecture entitled "Deregulation,

gressive
political
magazine
The
American Prospect, a senior fellow at
Demos and author of the new book, "The
Squandering of America: How the
Failure of our Politics Undermines our

Prosperity."

Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l
recalled an earlier speech that Kuttner
gave in 1999, when he was presented
with an honorary degree at the
Commencement ceremony. "I checked
on what he said then and believe it is
pertinent for students now: '... even
within the professions, you can be constructive, ecstatic outsiders, and benign

what matters and holding on to it. I am
sure he will grace the campus with further wit, wisdom and acute insight,"
Eldridge said.
Political Science Professor Richard

Valelly believes that Kuttner's
speech will be important for students to

Kuttner will
give a backdrop as to how the political
economy will effect the 2008 election,"
he said.

Kuttner recommended an increase in

"If you put some public money into
rebuilding infrastructure, whether it's
schools or roads or rail or energy, developing energy independence, 100 cents on
the dollar gets spent domestically," he
said.
His insightful ideas on the state of
the economy are described in detail in
his new book. The Squandering of
America. "His new book couldn't be
timelier," Valelly said.
It predicts
that the market fundamentalism and the
financial deregulation that have defined
our political economy for the past quarter century have been generating not
only income inequality but also
increased systemic vulnerability to
financial crises."
"In other words, the 'great moderation' idea is wrong and a dangerous
delusion, a possibility that we may all be
coming to grips with right now," he said.
Kuttner will discuss his views of the
economy when he speaks on Monday. The'
sponsors (including the departments of
Political Science, Economics, Public
Policy, Sociology and Anthropology,
Educational Studies and the Office of the
President) of the event are evidently looking forward to his visit, and hope that it
will draw a large turnout from the

Student opinion to be solicited for deer decision
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY HANNAH PURKEY

hpurkeyl@swarthmore. edu

In response to the overpopulation of white-tailed deer in the
Crum Woods, the Board of
Managers is moving forward with

a consultant's recommendation to
hire sharpshooters to eliminate
the deer abundance and asking for
the campus community's opinion.
At the Board of Managers meeting in December, Byron Shissler,
president of Natural Resource
Consultants, was hired to look into
different approaches to deer population control. Shissler presented
his findings and suggested the use
of sharpshooters as the most efficient and effective option, according to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l
"[The overpopulation of deer] is
an actual problem that has negative consequences and we have to
address them somehow," Eldridge
said.
In 2001, Provost Jennie Keith
Crum
Woods
formed
the
Stewardship Committee in part to

look into the deer situation in the
Crum as well as to "create a protection, restoration and stewardship plan for the Crum Woods,"
according to the committee's Web
site. The deer overabundance was
officially addressed in a study by
the Natural Lands Trust and
Continental Conservation in 2003.
In an effort to monitor the ecological impact of the deer population on the woods, the committee
hired Shissler, an expert on deer

population management according
to Eldridge, to produce a report on
the current state of the deer population as well as possible remedies
to the problem. Once compiled, the

results of Shissler's research were
presented to the Board of
Managers.
"[Shissler] went through all of

the alternatives and has recommended that sharpshooters and
bait sites be used," Eldridge said.
Other alternatives discussed
include contraception options,
fencing, trap and release approaches as well as recreational hunting.
According to Eldridge, the board

dismissed these options as inefficient or forbiddenby Pennsylvania
law.
"The killing is as accurate and
clean as can be," Eldridge said of
the use of sharpshooters. This
option, if implemented, would take
place over winter break ofthe 20082009 school year to ensure the presence of few people on campus. All
of the deer suitable for human consumption wouldthen be donatedto
a food bank or to needy families, in
accordance with regulation 147.326
of
the
Pennsylvania
Game
Commission.
The committee's next step is to
bring the suggestion to the students and faculty members. "The
committee is going to have some
public opportunities for the campus community to comment on the
recommendation [for sharpshooters]," Eldridge said. Taking into
account this feedback, the Board
will make a final decision at the
May Board meeting.
Eldridge does not know what to
expect from the studentreaction to
the school's recommendation, but

hopes that students can see that
despite the harshness, this suggestion is the most humane option. "I
hope that students will see us as
being reasonable and not unwontedly inhumane," Eldridge said.
Many students can understand
Eldridge's position. "It seems to be
reasonable to keep the deer popu-

under control," Eric
Christiansen 'O9 said. "Bringing in
sharpshooters to shoot them individually might be a little expensive, but I'm not morally outraged." If offsite contractors are
used, the price can vary from $lOO

Shissler's report.
Other students are less sure of
the method Shissler is recommending. "I don't like the idea of
directly killing the deer," Zebi
Brown 'O9 said. "But I know other
methods might not be as effective."
Sharpshooters have been used
to successfully lower the deer population in the Philadelphia area
with no incidents, according to
Eldridge. Before sharpshooters
can be used here, though, the col-

lege must obtain jurisdiction from
the borough of Swarthmore and
adjacent
township.

Eldridge said that there are two
things that must happen first.
"One would be to amend [township] ordinances about firearms to
permit them for a specific activity
such as deer culling," Eldridge

said. "And second, on our behalf,

apply to the game commission of

the

commonwealth

of

Pennsylvania for a permit."
Eldridge said that dates will

soon be announced for a series of
meetings at which students and
staff will have the opportunity to
express concerns about the potential use of sharpshooters.
The Crum Woods Stewardship
committee also will be coming out
with a summary of Shissler's position and the current state of the
deer situation so students can be
informed and involved throughout
the process.
"Students or others may feel
very strongly about it and express
that," Eldridge said. "And we want
to hear it."

Harvard law fights RIAA
BY CRISTINA ROJAS
THE DAILY FREE PRESS (BOSTON

IM

(U-WIRE) BOSTON While universities are still caught in the middle of
-

the Recording Industry Association of
America's nearly year-long effort to
punish music piracy on campuses

across the country, some students are

beginning to strike back against the
RIAA with legal investigations of
their own.
A Harvard University law class is

currently exploring the legal indications for universities caught between
a responsibility to protect their filesharing students and their accountability to an industry crusading to
make examples out of students violating piracy laws. Harvard Law School
professor Charles Nesson's class has
been working to formulate arguments

on the schools' behalf.
The RIAA started sending letters
to university administrators in

February 2007, requesting they forward the settlement letters to the filesharing students, according to the
RIAA's website.
Nineteen Massachusetts Institute
*

of Technology students received letters in the latest round of letters this
year.

When the RIAA tracks down a filesharing student, it files a "John Doe"
lawsuit and then tries to use the
court's discovery process to find out
who uses a certain IP address, said
Nesson.

The RIAA gets permission to subpoena a university with access to IPaddress information to find out individual student names.
Nesson said the lawsuits are
unfair fights. "Students are completely overwhelmed by

the

legal apparatus

behind the enforcement that the
RIAA is bringing to bear," he said.

THE PHOENIX

He said schools should not necessarily protect their students, but act
in their own interest by staying neutral in the RIAA's campaign.
"I think the university has a huge
interest at stake here," Nesson said.
"It has to deal with the responsibility
and mission of a university to provide
an environment in which young students learn about and come to terms
with legal authority."

Nesson said students would benefit by standing behind their university to stay neutral in the dispute
between the RIAA and their students.
"[Students should] make a strong
representation to the university to
recognize its own interest in resisting
the request by the RIAA to become its
policing instrument," he said.
When the RIAA issued subpoenas
requesting the names of 17 students at
the University of Oregon, administrators sought the help of Oregon
Attorney General Hardy Myers, said
Justice Department spokeswoman
Stephanie Soden.
She said the university has decided to ignore the RIAA's request and
the Justice Department has filed a
motion to "quash the subpoena."
"There has been no word from the
judge yet," Soden said.
Boston University does not reveal
students' names to the RIAA unless it
receives a lawfully-issued subpoena
by which the court demands Boston
University
provide
the name,
spokesman Colin Riley said.
He said students should do what is
in their own best interest and seek
legal counsel.
"There can be consequences for
students who violate the Code of
Computing Ethics and the Code of
Student Responsibilities, but those
are certainly secondary when you're
looking at the students having to deal
with the legal action on behalf of the
RIAA," he said.

Senate targets many endowments
BY NATHAN C. STRAUSS AND KEVIN ZHOU
HARVARD CRIMSON (HARVARD)
Senators
(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
Max S. Baucus and Charles E. Grassley, the
chairman and ranking member of the Senate
Finance Committee, sent letters to the 136
wealthiest colleges in the nation last week asking for detailed information about their
finances and operations.
The questionnaires, which were sent to colleges whose endowments topped $5OO million as
of the end of 2007, come amid a push to force universities to spend a larger share of the endowments, which some lawmakers believe would
reduce tuition costs.
-

Harvard's $34.9 billion endowment is the

largest in the country, though it trails Princeton
on a per-capita basis.
Kevin Casey, Harvard's director of federal
relations, said that the University would
answer the voluntary questionnaire, which it
received last Friday. "We look at it as an opportunity, if it's seriously a fact-finding matter, to
help broaden Mr. Grassley's perspective about
what the endowment is all about," Casey said.
Grassley, an lowa Republican, has gained
widespread attention for proposing that universities be held to the same standards as other
charitable organizations, which must spend a

minimum of five percent of their endowments
each year.
Jill Gerber, a Grassley spokeswoman, said
that no legislation has yet been filed, and that
responses to the questionnaire will provide
needed information before further steps can be
taken. "This will give the committee members a
more complete picture of what's happening,"
she said. "Senator Grassley would like to see
more action and a fuller understanding of
growth and spending."
While Harvard, which currently spends 3.5

percent of its endowment wealth each year,
intends to provide the committee with much of
the information that it has requested, Casey
said a five-percent rule would be detrimental

because universities face different challenges
than other types of non-profit organizations.
"When charities have to reach the five-percent spending rate, they can just write a check
January 33, 2008

to another group, but we have to plan budgetary
cycles over a much longer horizon," Casey said

"To establish the rules of the road is fine, il
there's abuse. But you don't always have to leg
islate."
Casey added that much of the difficulty ir
developing new spending efforts rests in the
very nature of the endowment, which is com
prised more than 11,000 private funds, many ol
which come with constraints on how they car
be spent.
"The endowment has to support all of the
University
all 11 schools and all 20,000 stu
dents," he said. "I don't know if Grassley has
thought of it as serving all of those purposes."
Grassley and Baucus, a Montana Democral
who attended Stanford, applauded the recenl
expansions of financial aid by Harvard, Yale
and Dartmouth in their letter to the 136 univer
sities, calling it the "first good news in a long
time" in terms of reigning in tuition costs.
"It seems clear from recent actions by oui
nation's top universities thatthere is much thai
can be accomplished...to control costs and pro
vide real relief for students from low and mid
die income families," the senators wrote.
The Senate investigation
which was
launched after a study by the National
Association of College and University Business
Officers revealed massive endowment growth
at the nation's wealthiest universities
has
received strong support from senators on both
sides of the aisle.
Senator John F. Kerry, a Yale alumnus whc
also serves on the Finance Committee, said thai
with soaring tuition costs and shrinking mid
die-class incomes, it has become increasingly
important to expand

tuition assistance pro

"This initiative will help us better under

New Jersey student newspaper shut down by student government
BY MICHELLE MCGUINNESS & MEGAN DEMARCO
THE SIGNAL (COLLEGE OF NEW JERSEY)
(U-WIRE) EWING, N.J. In a controversial decision that
some believe could have repercussions for college media
across the state, the Student Government Association
(SGA) of Montclair State University halted, printing for the
first Spring issue of the student newspaper.
The editors of The Montclarion discovered their budget
-

was frozen, preventing them from printing, on Tuesday,
Jan. 22, the first day of the Spring semester.
In an exclusive interview, SGA executive president Ron
Chicken said The Montclarion violated SGA policy.
Chicken said they did this by consulting a private attorney
about SGA's potential violation of New Jersey sunshine
laws, which prohibit public bodies from conducting closed
meetings. According to Chicken, The Montclarion should
have consulted SGA's attorney.
"This is not a question of censorship," Chicken said.
"It's a matter of them (the staff of The Montclarion)
breaking rules and regulations that they've agreed to follow."
Although Montclarion attorney Sal Anderton has
since been released from service, Chicken is requesting
that correspondence between Anderton and Editor-inChief Karl de Vries be turned over to SGA. De Vries
refused to disclose the documents, citing attorney-client
privilege. As of press time, The Montclarion was still
without the funds necessary to print, but was publishing
online.
Lawyers say Chicken's move could have legal ramifications that would affect college papers across the country because of the ease with which a student government
organization stopped a student newspaper from printing.
Chicken, however, maintained that SGA was simply following its financial policy.
The Lawyer Controversy
A letter signed by Chicken and executive treasurer
Melissa Revesz told The Montclarion that its budget was
frozen because the newspaper had spent its SGA-allocated funds illegally by using them on Anderton without
having a contract approved by SGA. In addition to the letter, The Montclarion's printer, RFM Printing, was contacted by SGA and told not to print until further notice.
Chicken said that if The Montclarion wanted legal
counsel, it could have utilized Schiller & Pittenger, PC,
the official legal counsel of SGA. The Montclarion is not
independent from SGA.

"This is not a question of censorship.
It's a matter of [the staff of the
Montclarion] breaking rules and
regulations that they've agreed to

follow."
Ron Chicken
Montclair State U. Student
Government Association President
De Vries felt this system was flawed, however.
He said if SGA's lawyer was to advise or represent The
Montclarion, he would be "representing his client against

his client."
According to Peter Schaus, managing editor of The
Montclarion, the former SGA president approved
Anderton, himself a former Montclair SGA president, as
the newspaper's lawyer.
Chicken, however, objected to the paper pursuing an
independent lawyer.
"How is it possible that there is a separate attorney for
The Montclarion to sue SGA?" Chicken said. "It's all part
of one organization. You can't sue yourself."

Anderton's attorney, Chris Adams, said it would be a
conflict of interest if The Montclarion had used SGA's
attorney. He said the lawyer would be legally obligated to
say no to counseling the paper. SGA's lawyer would be
unable to advise the paper on matters about SGA.

10

"It's contrary to all legal principles," he said.
As of press time, SGA's lawyer was unavailable for

comment.
Douglas Mclntyre serves as both chief copy editor for

The Montclarion and executive secretary for SGA. He said
he stands by SGA's decision.
"I don't feel conflicted because I stand by what the executive board (of SGA) decided," he said.
Mclntyre said in previous years The Montclarion had
been told by SGA administrations that it was following
SGA policy by talking to an outside lawyer. Mclntyre said
this year, however, SGA members realized that it was not
their policy and are working to fix it.
Joe Specchio, attorney general for SGA, asserted that
SGA is simply following a policy. However, he said he
understands the implications of shutting down the newspaper.
"I could see how it looks like we're repressing the voice
of the school," he said. "You're taking away something the
college needs. It looks bad."
Specchio, whose duty is to advise student organizations
on the school's laws and policies, said he did not vote for
shutting down the budget and is unhappy that he was not
consulted.
He said he believes the legislature of SGA will unfreeze
the newspaper's budget at its Wednesday meeting and
added that actions may be taken within SGA in the future

to challenge Chicken's authority.

The Documents
Although the matter will be addressed at SGA's
Wednesday meeting, neither Chicken nor de Vries seemed
likely to budge on turning over the documents.
Chicken said because de Vries never had a valid contract with Anderton, no attorney-client privilege ever existed.
He said the newspaper was contacted several times
since September asking for the correspondence. He said
that because SGA is separate from Montclair and The
media organization of SGA," SGA was
Montclarion is
technically Anderton's client. Due to this, SGA should be
able to have all the correspondences from the attorney,
Chicken said.
"I will not hand over the correspondence between
myself and the attorney. That is attorney-client privilege,"
de Vries said.
Adams, Anderton's attorney, said de Vries will not turn
over the documents under any circumstances.
"He has an attorney-client privilege," he said. "No
request from Mr. Chicken or his lawyer is going to do any'&

thing eviscerating that privilege."
SGA attorney general Specchio agreed.
"(De Vries) believes in attorney-client privilege. There's
nothing in those letters," he said. "He doesn't want to be
strong-armed by SGA."
De Vries did say, though, that The Montclarion is not a
separate entity from SGA.
Chicken said SGA has about $33,000 in its budget for the
newspaper this semester for printing costs.
"We're not independent of them in any sense, unfortunately," De Vries said.
The newspaper generates about $50,000 a semester in ad
revenue, but until recently, Chicken said, most of this ad
money went to SGA and only a small portion was re-allocated back to the paper. Chicken said he and the SGA executive treasurer, Revesz, recently instituted a policy that
allows the newspaper to use all of its ad revenue.
Legal Implications

Chicken's actions attracted media attention because of
the lack of legal precedent surrounding censorship of college media.

Mike Hiestand, an attorney and consultant for the
Student Press Law Center (SPLC), said student newspapers
are rarely shut down, and never for "such an outrageous
excuse."
Tom Cafferty of the New Jersey Press Association
agreed.
"I've never heard of it before at a college paper," he said.
Hiestand said SGA is clearly violating the law.
"The law really is clear," Hiestand said. "Student government at public colleges cannot shut down student publications."
Adams agreed.

January 31, 2008

"To think that the elected student official of a public unihas such little respect or knowledge of the First
Amendment is scary," he said.
Hiestand said SGA is not justified in requesting to see the
documents. "It's outrageous to think that the student government thinks they have the right to violate attorney-client
privilege," he said.
Adams said Anderton would not represent The
Montclarion if a legal battle ensues because he is a witness,
but said SPLC is setting up lawyers to represent the paper.
Adams said the paper could bring a lawsuit either against
Montclair, or Chicken as an individual. He encouraged the
school to advise Chicken to drop the request.
versity

"[The shutdown] is much more than
whether or not [Montclair] has a
printed paper. Every student
newspaper should be terrified of
what's happening at Montclair."
Karl de Vries
Editor-in-Chief, The Montclarion
Montclair State U.
School administrators did not immediately return phone

calls requesting a comment as of press time.
Hiestand and Cafferty both said other college papers

should be concerned.

"Every college paper needs to be very concerned," he
said. "The president (Chicken) doesn't seem to care what the
law says. He just wants to do what he wants to do."
"If the decision stands, then I would think this is something other New Jersey papers should be worried about,"
Cafferty said. "It could have profound implications."
De Vries agreed that The Montclarion's dilemma could
have far-reaching consequences for all college media.
"This is much more than whether or not (Montclair) has
a printed paper," he said. "Every student newspaper should
be terrified of what's happening at Montclair."
-

Hitting Home for the College
Unlike the College of New Jersey, Montclair's SGA also
acts as its Student Finance Board (SFB).
Chicken explained that the system is modeled off of the
federal government. Montclair's SGA contains a judicial,
legislative and executive branch, as well as an executive

board for cabinet officers who work withthe executive president.
All checks and balances for the SGA come internally.
This system is part of the reason Chicken and others feel
they are legitimately upholding their financial policies.
Leo Acevedo, SFB executive director at the College, said
the College's system, which defines SFB, SGA and all student organizations as separate groups, is more beneficial to
students.
"It completely factors out politics," Acevedo. said.
Dan Scapardine, vice president of Legal & Governmental
affairs for the College's SGA, lauded the split system here.
He noted that the SGA has "no control over The Signal and
that's the way to do it."
The SGA does, however, have to approve any amendments made to The Signal's constitution.
Additionally, SFB can freeze The Signal's budget if the
newspaper is in violation of policies and has as recently as
last semester.
However, because of The Signal's independence and
because it is largely funded through its own ad revenue, the
temporary budgetary freeze did not halt or disrupt The
Signal's publication in any way.
"Thank goodness that we have a separate SGA and a separate student board," Acevedo said. "Whether we finance (a
group) or not, they're still independent organizations."
Scapardine said that to him, the situation at Montclair
seemed like a case of SGA asserting authority.
"It's probably a case of them (SGA) reasserting their
authority over the newspaper," he said.
"Obviously, it can be resolved in a more diplomatic

way."

Growing up in New York, I encountered
many Chabadniks. They were distinguishable by their dress: men wear dark suits with
white shirts, tzitzis (fringes), long beards and
yarmulkes often covered by another hat (the
women are harder to pick out of a crowd).
My impression of Chabad has not been

The Spiritual Scene Interestingly,
Chabadniks are not interested
in converting people to Judaism; rather, they
push Jews who, for whatever reason, do not
practice as religiously as they. On some Sundays, Chabad sets up a stand outside of the Union Square subway station in Manhattan. They ask passers by
"Are you Jewish?" When I said yes, one man asked me if I had ever wrapped
tefillin (also known as phylacteries). Tefillin is two boxes with biblical verses

America. "Muslims in America need to fully
embrace that they are American," Soofi said.
Monday's event also showed the first episode
of the Canadian sitcom "Little Mosque on the
Prairie." The sitcom depicted a struggling
Muslim community in a small Canadian town
that has to set up a makeshift mosque in the local
church. Though the show doesn't hit all of its
comedic notes, it's nonetheless daring, holding a
mirror up to prejudice against Muslims by exaggerating it with such broad slapstick. Some at the
screening also liked that the show portrayed a
diversity of ethnic backgrounds and beliefs within the Muslim community.
On Tuesday, MSA showed the PBS documentary "Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet", which
looked at the life ofMuhammad and his influence
since then. The documentary followed contemporary Muslim Americans that find much significance in how Muhammad led his life. One of the
documentary's subjects is a fireman in New York,
who felt, Ailya Vajid 'O9 recalled, "his saving peois his way of connecting with Muhammad
ple
and doing something right for the world."
On Wednesday, MSA invited Saint Joseph's
University professor Isra Yazicioglu to hold her
lecture "The Ventures of Adam and Eve in the
Qur'an." Professor Yazicioglu explained the
importance of the story of Adam and Eve in the
Qur'an and where it agreed with and differed
from Judeo-Christian tradition. Yazicioglu discussed the absence of original sin and the admission of free will in Islam, stressing that Islam was
very much about self-realization. Later, attendees
got to look at works ofIslamic calligraphy.
The final event will take place today at 6:30
p.m. and features a panel with members of MSA
and with Religion professor Tariq al-Jamil and
Sociology/Anthropology
professor
Farha

the audience about the Islamic faith and the
Muslim identity in America. Additionally, "we
also want to open it up to the audience ... and see
what they think and what they've learned and
what they're curious about," Vajid said. For
Vajid, the political sensitivity of these issues
makes it all the more urgent for them to be discussed "because people don't want to be offensive
and everything's so PC at Swarthmore." With
Islam Awareness Week and its culminating
panel, MSA hopes to bring a greater understanding of what it means to be Muslim in America.

A screening of "Muhammad: Legacy of a
Prophet" was one of the many events at the
first Islam Awareness Week.

BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

In the reality TV series "30 Days," Morgan
Spurlock strolls along the streets of a small
American town and stops random people for a
quick game of word association. Spurlock offers
the word "terrorist", and the responses he
receives are all too often "Muslim" and "Islam."
Since 9/11, misunderstandings of Islam in the U.S.
have been greatly exacerbated, which is why the
many issues discussed at Swarthmore's first
Islam Awareness Week, hosted by the Muslim
Students Association, are more important than

me some literature.
Another bit of Chabad presence in Manhattan is a billboard on the West Side
Highway and 44th St. with a picture of the late Chabad religious leader Rebbe,
saying "Moshiach," the messiah, "is here... Long live the Rebbe King Messiah
forever!", This public display of religion not so subtly suggests that Chasidism
is the true way (their Rebbe is the messiah, after all). When I heard there was a
Chabad group at Swarthmore, I expected the same Jewish evangelism. As it
turns out, the only public voice Chabad has is in the form of advertising for
events, and that's fine as long as it isn't in the Reserved Students Digest. Swat's
Chabad group is a branch of Chabad on Campus, a foundation that sends rabbis to college campuses in order to create a "'home away from home' for Jews
on campus and offers a wealth of social, educational and spiritual programs."
Rabbi Eli Gurevitz is the Director of Chabad on Campus for Tri-Co. He
serves as an "internal resource to Jewish students" and performs Jewish educational outreach. He holds weekly Lunch *n' Learn meetings in Sharpies where
he serves bagels and lox, distributes the week's Torah portion and chats with
students. Rabbi Gurevitz conducts informal classes on various aspects of
Judaism, including text study, and meets with students individually upon
request. Chabad on Campus also sponsors events surrounding Jewish holidays.
For instance, this past fall they had Sushi in the Sukkah, -hosted a trip to a
Shofar factory and held a Hanukah party.
Rabbi Gurevitz aims "to reach every student that's interested in exploring
Jewish educational texts or Jewish heritage." But if people are not interested,
that's okay. He isn't looking to convert people or get them to "sign on to anything." He looks, instead, to explore Jewish wisdom with interested students
and faculty, Jews and gentiles alike. For Rabbi Gurevitz, Jewish wisdom is neverending; it's a constant journey of discovery. According to Rabbi Gurevitz,
"Chabad philosophy is based on love for your fellow human." Even if the
Chabadniks in Union Square are pushy, and even if they put up messianic billboards, any religious movement that sticks to this philosophy has a place at
Swarthmore. Especially if they aren't pushy here.
Julian is a junior. You can reach him atjchendel@swarthmore.edu.

A screening of "30 Days," held on Monday,
Jan. 28, was part of the first event for the week.
The episode places Dave, an all-American,
Christian family man from West Virginia, in the
household of a young Muslim couple living in
Dearborn, Michigan, the U.S.'s most densely populated Muslim community. Through the first half
of the episode, Dave squeamishly follows the customs of his host family, learns about the Qur'an
from the local mosque's imam and takes Arabic
lessons. By the end, Dave is petitioning for legislation against racial profiling and going on a
radio talk show to quell ideas that Muslims in
suburbia are engaging in terrorist activity.
There was a lively discussion afterward, in
which some grimaced at the cute animations that
the show used to briskly introduce the basic tenants of the Islamic faith and some of Dave's comments like, "They're really great people and really productive." But overall, some felt the episode
was valuable in reaching Middle America. Omar

Although India is one of
the many countries that students can choose from when
deciding to go study abroad,
there are already several
international students from
India who are, in a sense,
studying abroad just by coming to the United States.
Miranda Weinberg 'O9 traveled from Swarthmore to the
Darjeeling district just northeast of the Himalayas while
Maithili Parikh 11 traveled
from Bombay, the capital of
India, all the way to
Swarthmore. Darjeeling is
located in thefar eastern part
of India while Bombay is on

the western coast. Although
when compared to the distance from India to the
United States, the difference
Bombay
between
and
Darjeeling seems small, India enjoys great cultural

diversity.

For Weinberg, one of the biggest adjustments
she had to make was to the food. "The only meal
you ate was dal
lentils, rice and vegetables,"
Weinberg said. "The exact same thing everyday,
twice a day. By the end, I really loved it, though."
Weinberg turned on the television to watch
American shows such as "Top Chef because of the
difficulty inherent in being around non-English
speakers and spending the last three weeks of her

independent study with no English at all.
Returning home and readjusting was an experience in itself. "I didn't have running water over
there" Weinberg said, adding that "having a hot
shower when I wanted" back in the States took
some getting used to.
Weinberg also said that in the States,

"Everyone wanted to know if it was really dirty

always on time, liking pets. We're all giant, tall,
white, Christians and extremely rich," which
Weinberg noted was ironic since the richest man

Parikh was born and raised in Bombay with
her family roots in the Gujarat state. Her main difficulty with adjusting to life in the States was with
the food at Sharpies because she is vegetarian.
Other than that, there were no huge shocks when
adjusting to life away from India since "Bombay is
a pretty modern city," Parikh said, although she
admits "the cold is something I need to get used to.

Parikh has also adjusted to
living away from home by
keeping in close contact with
friends and family. "I speak to

my friends are studying in the

them once a week," Parikh
said. Since Parikh visited the
United States before coming
to Swarthmore and has family and friends here, Parikh
did not have many misconceptions

although she noted that some
people from smaller areas in
India may perceive America
as just being "McDonalds,

The first impression that Laura Post
'O9 had when she arrived in Beijing last
fall was: "China is just so big." While the
Asian Studies major had closely-studied
Chinese culture and the language

in the
modernized coastal city
of Nanjing.
"[Nanjing] has been
developing very rapidly
in this age of globalization so we watched
Hollywood movies and
ordered pizza from
Papa John's," Du said,
"It wasn't that much of
a culture shock for me."
Du first decided to
come to Swarthmore
because she was interested in studying social
science but "China is
still a socialist country
so it's hard to study
things related to ideology." The more rigid Chinese higher education system also left little
room for academic exploration.
The biggest surprise for Du when she arrived was the trademark Swarthmore work ethic. "I was pretty surprised that
American students were studying really hard," Du said,
"Compared to Chinese students, the stereotype is that the Chinese
students work harder than their American counterparts but it
turned out to be not exactly right, especially here."
The initial language barrier for Du was "not substantial."
"I just went to a normal public high school but we had a lot of
exposure to American culture so English wasn't very difficult for
Chinese students these days," Du said.
While Du misses authentic Chinese food, living away from
home hasn't been difficult "because I can talk to my parents online
using the web camera and I go back home twice a year." Coming
from a large city, Du has also had to adjust to the 'tirastically different population densities."
Du's favorite memory of Swarthmore remains the
Thanksgiving break when she was invited to a roommate's home.
"We had a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner," Du
recalls, "It was very special and a really good memory because
everybody was very friendly."
One thing Du misses when she returns to China is the attitude
toward academics prevalent here.
"Here, students are so passionate about what they're studying
and a lot of people do all the work because they like the material so
much. But back in China, especially in the coastal cities, a lot of
people are just concentrating on how to become rich and find a
good job and go abroad to pursue the best degrees," Du said,
"People are more pragmatic in China."

U.S. to Ghana

Before journeying abroad to Ghana in late summer of 2006, Nora Taplin 'OB had learned of
Ghanaianculture through stories from international Swarthmore students. After studying African
dance at Swarthmore, Taplin chose to participate in
the dance department's study abroad program,
which tookher to the University of Ghana in Legon,
the University's largest campus located outside of
the capital city of Accra.

"rote learning." Furthermore,
"resources were limited," said
Taplin, and not all students
had access to the required
textbooks.
Taplin appreciated how
welcome she felt while in
Ghana. This outgoing candor
of Ghanaians, however, did
take some getting used to.
"People come up and talk to you on the street,"
»
Taplin said.
After acclimatizing to the easy-going lifestyle in
Ghana, Taplin realized that she had to "step up the
pace" in order to get used to being back at
Swarthmore. Yet, Taplin found it most difficult to
meaningfully describe her experiences in Ghana.
For Taplin, there is no true way to "package the
experience" of being abroad.

Ghana to the U.S.

Omari Faakye 10 lives in Accra, Ghana's capital city, yet he truly hails from an indefinable
region in "the east," the land of his ancestors.
While his high school classmates were scrambling
to apply to Ivy League universities, Faakye would
"sleep and dream about Swarthmore." Using the
Admissions viewbook as his "Swarthmore bible,"
Faakye was drawn to "the sense of community
and intimacy" evident in its photos of "gardens

and happy faces."
Because he never looked up Swarthmore's
location on a map before journeying to the college,
Faakye was surprised to find that Parrish Beach
was not an actual beach. On a more serious note,
he also perceived a change in the pace oflife in the
United States. "Things in Ghana go slowly" while
"Americans are very serious," Faakye said.
Despite American seriousness, Faakye said
that he, like 60% of his peers at his pan-African
high school who applied to colleges outside of
Africa, was eager to go abroad. While Faakye
knew exactly where he wanted to go, many had
"lost hope in their own country" and would have
gone anywhere simply for the sake of leaving.
Although Faakye is happy at Swarthmore, he
still believes in the old cliche that there is no place
like home. "You can never fully be comfortable
when you are not in your own home," Faakye
said. Whether or not he will return to Ghana after
graduation is still up in the air. For Faakye, this is
a decision he cannot currently make. He wants to
'ido the best" he can here while letting "the future
hold what it wants to for [him]."

Playful 'Marvels' of Things' delights' of List Gallery

Studio Art professor Brian Meunier integrates animal forms with different kinds of cultural signifiers in his collection.

If asked to describe his latest series of
sculptures entitled "Marvels of Things
Created and Miraculous Aspects of Things
Existing," studio art pofessor Brian
Meunier may just proudly tell you that he
has absolutely nothing new to say. But even
a quick glance at the series, on display at
the List Gallery until Feb. 23, and you'll
know that this is meant in the best way pos-

modern art to flee from the vicinity of the
List, "Marvels" is a fairly straightforward
collection of ceramic sculptures mostly taking on animal forms and integrating them
with all different kinds of cultural signifiers of human civilization, such as an elephant swimming on top of a pagoda. The
series is accessible and fun, while at the
same time, an impressive display of
Meunier's technical craft and his creative,
often humorous, play with forms.
And it doesn't mean that Meunier's
series has nothing important to say. "For
over 25 years, Brian Meunier has not been

perpetrating the myth of originality or
going for the shock of the new. Thank goodness," List Gallery director Andrea
Packard said at last Saturday's lecture on
the exhibit. "Rather he has been exploring
connectedness. He's been looking for universal meaning and poetic resonance in
both natural phenomena and the achievements of diverse cultures throughout history."
The lecture was packed with students,
faculty and many artists, who were all
treated to a narration through Meunier's
career that was easily as entertaining as
the exhibit itself. "I'll, make a sculpture
about anything," Meunier said, and sure
enough, every piece that Meunier displayed
to his audience had a back-story, many of
which elicited laughter from the audience.
One ofhis works, "Thistle," was inspired by

the orchid collection of a close friend of his.
However, his mother misinterpreted it and
remarked, ""Why do you always make phallic sculptures? Where did I go wrong?"
Meunier also showed some of his
weightier pieces, like "Pandora's Box"
made in the Reagan era, which dealt with
his paranoia about nuclear war, but still
with Meunier's innocently playful trademark style. "It's a strange thing for an
artist who makes whimsical things that
look like toys to deal with serious topics,"
Meunier said at the lecture. The lecture
concluded with Meunier's most recent
pieces of the series. One of them, "Gazelle",
which features a gazelle standing upright
on its hind legs, was inspired by a photograph Meunier saw of a standing gazelle. "I

undergraduate, Meunier seriously considered biology and anthropology. "I became
an artist so I could do all of those things,

but it's under my own terms,"
Meunier said. Naturally, he
has not only drawn inspiration from other artists,

but also from engineers
and scientists of the past.
He was especially drawn to
the works of 15th century

mechanic Tocala in

made many sketches of animals that they
had never seen before, which, for Meunier,
interestingly pitted the natural against the

Meunier even adopted the name
of al-Qazwini's cosmography treatise for his series. "I just love the
title," Meunier said. "I think the title
says it all in terms of my attitude about
how I go about assimilating information
from the natural world and from the
world ofartifacts."
The play between natural and
human creation has fingerprints
all over Meunier's "Marvels," all
of which was created in a sevenmonth fervor. The standing

ways to be passive aggressive, but for the most part, we've
remained polite. Confrontation, in some form, is necessary.
It's just an issue of picking the right way.
Like all Swatties, we tend to be pretty conflict-averse.
When we say "confrontation," we don't mean to imply a 2
a.m. screaming battle between you and your neighbor and
his girlfriend over "practicing their lines for Acting I," or
any kind of contact at all with anyone whose actions do not
affect you. We mean that you need to find a way of letting
that person or group of people know what behavior is bothering you. Staring at them will only make them think they
have spinach in their teeth or that you are madly in love
with them. Humor is recommended. Shouting is not.
We have left a few anonymous notes signed by the
Etiquette Fairy in etiquette problem spots. This has been
effective: the people engaging in rude behaviors have

stopped, but they haven't been publicly humiliated (yet) and
we haven't made any enemies (yet). If you adopt this tactic,
we request that you not try to blame it on us if it backfires.
If it works, we take full credit.

One of the

major themes
in our conversations of the past four years has been the
impolite and inconsiderate things that other people do. It
isn't us, certainly; it's got to be everyone else. It wasn't
because Mairin was trying to pick around all the onions in
the stir-fry line; it was because everyone else was being
impatient. It wasn't because Molly just had to catch up with
her friends in front of the juice dispenser, either; it was
because everyone else was experiencing an irrational

desire to drink juice right then. We don't mean you, our
Dear Readers, of course, we still mean, "everyone else."
We've dealt with our etiquette frustrations in a variety of
ways, some more fruitful than others. Passive aggressive
tactics have been surprisingly effective. There are rude

Confrontation, in some form, is
necessary. It's just an issue of
picking the right way.
There are a lot of situations in which this could not possibly work. It's one thing to leave a note at the dorm kitchen
sink asking people not to dump macaroni and pizza crusts
down the drain, but leaving a note on a cell-phone-lover's
thesis carrel is not OK. This is a personal problem and it
should be settled face-to-face as privately as possible.
Making someone else's lack of consideration an opportunity to display your deep understanding of propriety will only
make you look like the jerk you are. It's important to keep

rudeness in perspective. Ultimately, it's not so serious that
it requires knives, arm waving or even raising your voice.
Approach the person, say, "Excuse me, but do you mind not
doing X?" And when they comply, don't forget to say,
"Thank you." It's that simple.

Off the hall, it's just like when in
third grade you learned about
"stranger danger;" the trick is to find
the nearest authority figure and ask
him or her to handle it for you.
In some cases, you may not feel comfortable confronting
another person at all. This is a good opportunity to make
your RA earn that humongous single room, parking space
and paycheck. Off the hall, it's just like when in third grade
you learned about "stranger danger;" the trick is to find the
nearest authority figure and ask him or her to handle it for
you. You can also go somewhere else. This isn't letting the
guy who put his unshod feet up on the table win; this is you
valuing your health above making a point.
It's probably not a good idea to stew about it and get
angrier. That won't work. We've tested it to death. For our
Dear Readers out there who have etiquette anger issues and
no Phoenix column in which to vent them, we make the following offer: If there is a reasonably common practice that
is generally inconsiderate, feel free to write to us about it
and we'll address it in our column. Maybe the people engag-

ing in this activity will read the column. Maybe they won't.
But if you highlight it appropriately and slip it under their
door, we guarantee they'll figure out that something is
wrong.

only the collar of this one is adorned with roses and his
hair has been gathered into several bulbs across the top of
his head.
If you forget for a moment that these are film cos-

tumes and view them as the manner of dress of a (particularly outrageous) person in the year 2263, there is
a valid comparison to be made with the Prada collection. Ruby's fashion sense, part male, part female,
part topiary (that hair!), is consonant with Prada's
vision of turning traditional ideas of feminine/masculine dress inside out. But where the Prada collection's use of gender binaries evoked feelings ofmale
vulnerability, there is nothing particularly emasculating or weak about Ruby's clothes because
they are a fitting complement to his strong person- i

Miuccia Prada herself said the collection was revenge for
what men do to women. Other critics saw it as suggesting
a break from our conventional gendered conceptions of
what is feminine and masculine.
While I respect all the gender commentary, I also
thought that many of the feminine elements of the collection were too satirical for me to take seriously. The
exposed bikini bottoms, for example, seemed like a rather
literal translation of that dark period when it was trendy
for girls to have their thong straps displayed above the
tops of their low-rider jeans.
Out of the swirl of other images that popped into my
mind when I saw pictures of the collection was that of
Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod in Luc Besson's futuristic film
"The Fifth Element," whose clothes also have many feminine elements to them. The first time Ruby Rhod is introduced, he wears a skin-tight leopard-print jumpsuit with a
high, broad collar like Maleficent from "Sleeping Beauty"
and he has his hair teased forward like a unicorn horn.

Miuccia Prada herself said the
collection was revenge for
what men do to women.
Furthermore, all the other characters in the film have
equally unique manners of dress such that there isn't
really a dominant aesthetic in the film that would necessitate any sense of deviation from a norm, as the Prada
collection seems to conjure up.
This speaks to the notion that fashion is no longer
about achieving a certain universal standard but more
about fulfilling the needs of individuals and certain sectors of the population. Designers no longer wield the
broad, top-down power they once did in having a sweeping
effect on the aesthetic landscape like the way that
Christian Dior's New Look, introduced in 1947, heralded a
new hyper-feminine silhouette that was the ruling aesthetic for most women in the 19505. Today, the New Look
still exists. But, as suggested by the many 2008 collections,

The role of fashion designers
today is in proposing the potential
for something different and leaving choice open for individuals to
decide. In Prada's case, it is the
possibility of integrating traditionally feminine motifs into
men's fashion without treading
on drag queen chic. And while I

do think this collection looked a
bit awkward in its playing with
feminine and masculine modes of
dress, I think a big part of that discomfort comes merely from the novelty of
the looks. But this feeling is exactly
what pushes fashion forward. And now
that the suggestion has been proposed,
it's up to individuals who use these collections as reference points to interpret
the looks as they will into their own aesthetic sensibilities. So does this mean

Screw 101: How to set up a perfect match
mate. If the student lives in a single, hopefully he or she
has Facebook so you could click View friends' to see any
mutual friends you might contact about setting up that

BY JOAN KIM
Jkim3@swarthmore.edu

The annual Screw Your Roommate Formal, which will
be held on Saturday, Feb. 23 in Upper Tarble, seems so far
away, especially with that problem set due tomorrow and
the essay that refuses to write itself. However, your roommate will be forever grateful if you started looking now
for his or her date.
For those who are newcomers or completely oblivious
to college events, SAC member Rachel Bell 'lO explained:
"Screw is basically a way to screw over your roommate or
put them on a really good date where you don't tell your
roommate who they're going to be screwed with and you
coordinate with the date's roommate so the couple can
find each other in Sharpies. Then later, there is a formal
and they may or may not go together." Screw can be a
time to meet someone on campus whom you have never
met before, an increasingly rare occurrence the longer
you are here at Swarthmore. You could use also use Screw
just to get to know an acquaintance better or just to go
with a friend. Just because you are in a relationship does
not mean you have to miss out on the fun
friends or
already established couples are often screwed together.
Sometimes, roommates and friends have to get a little
creative when finding dates to keep the element of surprise at Screw. "My Screw experience was different
because my friends brought my best friend from high
school for Screw," Ailya Vajid 'O9 said. Other roommates
have created lists of people who are off limits for Screw
dates but whether the roommates will use that list for or
against their roommates is never certain. "Some people
have told me that they like being screwed with someone
they don't know so it's a little bit more exciting and a little less awkward than being screwed with someone you
know already," Vajid said. Finding a date is often a collaborative effort from friends and sometimes involves
extensive research using our sacred online friends,
Facebook and Cygnet. Be certain, however, that the person being screwedmakes it clear if he or she wants a rela-

person.

After the Screw date-search is over. The next step is a
job for your creative side. The dates don coordinating or
corresponding costumes. Past examples include Romeo

-

tionship, a crazy fling or just to make a friend. Having

one date expect the love of his or her life and the other
wanting a friendship makes for an uncomfortable experience.
Not everyone has secret spy skills so we must all consult online sources to figure out not onlysimilar interests
but also where potential dates live. If you cannot find the
person's residence on their Facebook or you want to
avoid sounding extremely sketchy when asking people
who might know, one option is to search on Cygnet. A disclaimer about people who live in non-Swarthmore College
housing: they are not to be found on Cygnet. To Cygnet
shop, search the name of the potential screw date and
note where the student lives. Be careful because Cygnet
likes to abbreviate dorms like 'Willets' as 'Willet,' Mary
Lyons as 'ML,' and Alice Paul' as Aliceß' Then plug in
the dorm and room number on Cygnet to find the room-

and Juliet, James Bond and Bond Girl, a doctor and a
nurse and even ketchup and mustard. In one unforgettable Screw experience, there was one date slathered in
peanut butter and another in jelly. "I'm letting my imagination run wild when it comes to the costumes that my
roommate's going to wear," Serra Kornfilt 'll said. Or not
wear, as in the case of a legendary Adam and Eve couple.
Many of these costumes have been recycled so people
are always looking for ways to put a twist on the typical
costume. Last year, one student dressed up as Cindy Lou
Who and her date went as the Grinch. Another couple featured Katie Kanuka 10 dressed up as Jake Ban 'lO and
Ban dressed up as Kanuka. An overcrowded Sharpies
filled with students wearing costumes makes it difficult to
instantly find your date but it's a sight not to be missed,
which is why students who are not being Screwed often
come to Sharpies to be entertained.

Tm letting my imagination run wild
when it comes to the costumes that
my roommate's going to wear."
Serra Kornfilt 'll
The worst that could happen is an awkward experience, which is hardly rare on campus anyway. A few couples have even gotten relationships out of Screw. The
most common post-Screw scenario is gaining a new friend
with whom you experienced a fun Swarthmore tradition.

'27 Dresses' is lacking in both humor and originality
BY ABIGAIL GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu

I stared at a blank computer screen for
20 minutes before I could start reviewing
"27 Dresses." Why was I blocked? Bad
reviews are always the easiest to bang out,
and to alleviate the suspense, I can tell you
right now that this one was gonna be a
doozy. The obnoxious characters! The flat
punchlines! The bedraggled narrative arc!
James Marsden's preternaturally white
teeth! I should have been able to rhapsodize at length about the death of the
American romantic comedy (long live
England!). I could have waxed eternal on
my frustration with stereotyped women. I
might have bored you to tears with more
comments about teeth. So why couldn't I?

This movie is not much
fun with a dick and Jane.
...

And then it hit me. I already wrote this
review. I wrote it three years ago. It was a
dark and stormy night (okay, probably
not). There was a movie called "The
Wedding Date." There were obnoxious
characters. Flat punchlines galore. A narrative arc that the dog dragged in. My
memory is hazier on the teeth situation,
but orthodontia aside, there's not one comment I would make about "27 Dresses" that
I didn't get out of my system on the last go.
And so now all I can think is, "Ugh, this
again?"

Not the kind of reaction Katherine

Heigl wants to be inspiring with her soph-

omore film. (Well, IMDb informs me that

16

she was in a number of films before last
summer's "Knocked Up," but I think it's
lying. But now my curiosity is piqued by
the undiscovered classic "Zyzzyx Rd." and
the "shocking, tragic twist" to its "DEATH
OF A SALESMAN meets LOLITA ending!"
Sweet! And now back to our regularly
scheduled programming.)
To be fair to Heigl, acting is not this
film's Achilles' Heel. In fact, cast chemistry is what keeps this sucker afloat. A
goofy Heigl looks like she's having a blast
as Jane, a human doormat who agrees to
plan her sister's wedding to her boss, for
whom she secretly pines. Heigl masters
the art of the fake smile, the grimace, the
obligatory scene were she does drunken
she seems born
karaoke on top of a bar
for slapstick, and one waits in vain for a
moment when she might get to show off
that talent. Marsden is a better actor than
the part he is given, that of Kevin, a cynical weddings columnist who hopes to use
Jane's story
she's been a bridesmaid 27
times
as his ticket to big-time feature
writing. Everyone in the supporting cast
(Edward Burns as Jane's boss and Malin
Akerman as Jane's self-absorbed sister)
clicks onscreen, and I'm sure that they all
have great comic timing, if only screen-

McKenna tries so hard to throw out a
laugh, but seems comedically constipated
the jokes just don't come out. The
romance is equally problematic. The "I
hate you/I love you" dance is harder to
pull off than Jane Austen makes it seem,

and McKenna ain't Jane Austen. The
future lovers can dislike each other, but
it's paramount that they not be actually
dislikable. Which Kevin is. Jane has it
right when, after suffering through a barrage of Kevin's cynical cliches about love,
she rolls her eyes and comments, "How
refreshing, a man who doesn't believe in
marriage." McKenna should pick up some
of that attitude, because Kevin's obnoxious cynicism, not to mention his complete

lack of journalistic ethics (Jane never
finds out that he's profiling her until his
humiliating story is published) makes him
a totally unsympathetic suitor for Jane's
hand.
Add the fact that Jane and Kevin only
sleep together when they're both horribly
drunk (Wham! Flashback to "The Wedding
Date!" Why, God, why?!), and that his apology to herfor his article is more about him
feeling better than her ("Here, take this
expensive thing I bought you so that I
don'tfeel so bad") and you'll be rooting for
Jane's boss to come around. Given those
circumstances no romance and no comedy
all this movie is, is not much fun
with a dick and Jane.

writer Aline Brosh McKenna gave them
any opportunity to show it off.
No, this film's Achilles' Heel is the
humor. Its Achilles' Shin is the character
development. Its Achilles' Thigh Fat That
Won't Go Away No Matter How Many
Lunges You Do is pretty much everything
else. McKenna's last project was "The
Devil Wear's Prada," and if you want to see
a smart, sexy, sophisticated film about
dresses, that's the ticket. "27 Dresses" is,
in comparison, a half-hearted knockoff.

Juno mixtape a hit
soundtracks do. The movie and the
music that goes along with it have a sort
of reciprocal arrangement going on, in
my mind at least, where the more I love
the soundtrack, the more I love the film,
and vice versa.
Above all, the soundtrack is heartfelt,
honest, careful, evocative, full of teenage

exuberance, invincible confidence, cele-

bratory, awkward, uncertain first-love,
whimsicality, quirkiness and pure,
untainted ingenuousness suffused with
self-protective humor. Appropriately
starting off with the folksy "All I Want Is
You" by the children's music songwriter

ANNA ZALOKOSTAS

Notes from the Underground
Considering Juno MacGufFs strong

affinity for Patti Smith, The Stooges and
The Runaways, her appreciation for Les

Paul guitars and the prominent role of
music in the film, it seems appropriate

(though

somewhat ironic) that the

movie's success in the box office has
spilled into the world of music (the film's
soundtrack release party was filled to

capacity an hour and a half early, with
over 100 people waiting outside the venue
for a chance to see Kimya Dawson per-

While music charts make it clear

form).

already discovered the skillfully crafted
and carefully chosen compilation of
songs that constitutes the soundtrack for
the movie, Swarthmore students aren't
particularly well known for following
what goes on in the "real world," and so,
as part of the column-quest I have decid-

edly set out on this semester
to hopefully bring some deserving music to the

attention of a wider audience on campus
I insist that if you have subjected me
to the embarrassment of having (accidentally, I presume) read this far into my
babbling, that you at least listen to the
damn thing. It's pretty good, if I do say so
myself (the soundtrack, not my column
most definitely not my column), so
stop being a snob, pretend you don't
know any of the names on the track list,
and listen to the songs without doing any
song title or artist reading.
Admittedly, part of the reason I love
"Juno" so much is because of its soundtrack. "Juno" is the type of film that is
impossible to separate from the songs
that accompany the happiness, awkwardness, anger, sadness and giddy giggling that the characters manage to elicit in between their sarcastic quips, and

while the soundtrack is very much able
to stand on its own as a fine piece of mixtapery, it works extraordinarily well
with the actual film
more so than most

THE PHOENIX

the first track is one
of the happiest songs you will ever hear.
It is innocent, uncomplicated and powerful in its simplicity, in its straightforBarry Louis Polisar,

ward declarations of childlike love. It's
like "The Giving Tree" in song form.

Covering the sweep from sweet, simple,
classic love songs like Buddy Holly's
"Dearest" to the mushiest of the mushiest with The Moldy Peaches' "Anyone
Else But You," to the witty, wistful, softly
articulate pattering of Belle & Sebastian,
the real glue that holds the soundtrack
together is the music of Kimya Dawson.
Dawson dominates the soundtrack

with both her own work and her work as
one half ofThe Moldy Peaches (the other

-*

half being Adam Green). While Dawson
and Green's song "Anyone Else But You"
is often singled out as the highlight of the
"Juno" soundtrack, there is so much
more to this soundtrack than The Moldy
Peaches. It is very much the childlike
idealism, the confessional honesty, the

sweet concern and persistent spirit that
refuses to die, the resilience and
inescapable humor of the chorus of
strong voices that insist on singing "We
won't stop until somebody calls the cops
and even then we'll start again and just
pretend that nothing ever happened" in
Dawson's solo songs that communicate
the tangle of teenage awkwardness and
fragility that "Juno" confronts us with. I
will admit, Dawson's songs are very girlish, and in many other contexts, they'd
probably be a bit too cutesy
but in the
context of "Juno", their simplicity is part
of what makes them work. And they do
work, and that is one of the greatest feats

of "Juno"'s soundtrack: making all these
songs that are silly but happy, really simple and childlike, completely transparent
but also entirely heartfelt and sincere
work, making all of them come together
and bring out toothed grins and dimples.
In the end, I only have one objection
when it comes to the use of music in the
film: Sonic Youth is not "just noise,"

Just off campus, Renato's is many a student's main source of nighttime sustenence, but
is by no means the only pizza option in Swarthmore.

What's the best pizza deal?
BY LEAH RETHY
lrethyl@swarthmore.edu
In Swarthmore there is little opportunity for fine dining. Luckily, though, we do
have quite an assortment of places from
which we can order pizza. The prime spots

ordering are Renato's, Alfredo's,
Appetito's and Acapulco, and there is a
very definite hierarchy regarding the quality of the various restaurants.
Renato's: The most popular place to
order pizza. Unfortunately, though, it is
only open until midnight, which is usually
precisely the time pizza cravings begin.
There have been a few periods around
exam time when I have actually planned in
advance for the relatively early closing
time by making a few phone calls around
11:30 p.m. to the usual suspects to find

for

someone who will share the Student
Special. Although there is something very
natural about calling in and simply saying
"Student Special," I have been told
(though, I personally have never been able
to order anything other than the Student
Special) that they do in fact have a good
variety of toppings. It is also the case that,

if you have time, taking the five-minute
walk into town rewards you with a
warmer, and for some reason, considerably
better pizza. The staff at Renato's is quite
friendly and the scene in the restaurant
never fails to make me incredibly happy
that I am no longer in junior high school.
When I asked Pete, a four-year employee of
Renato's what he thinks of Swarthmore
students, he said: "Swarthmore students
are very nice...they're good kids, not
rowdy like the locals."
Alfredo's: After Renato's
closes,
Alfredo's is generally thought of as the
best choice, assuming that it is before 1
a.m. Alfredo's is unfortunately somewhat
more expensive than the other popular
pizza parlors, perhaps owing to the fact
that its official name includes the term ristorante (Alfredo Ristorante, Inc.). Yet,
according to some students, it truly is sig-

January

especially in the cheese
nificantly better
department. Alfredo's also lays claim to
being one of the friendlier restaurants.
When I called to ask them what they
thought of Swarthmore students, they
were exceptionally pleasant and refrained
from hanging up on a caller who was not in
fact buying any pizza. Megan, the Alfredo's
employee with whom I spoke, described
Swarthmore students as "generally very
nice," though she was quick to add "they
order some weird stuff sometimes, like
Hawaiian pizza." Although I can sympathize with her bewilderment at the concept
of a pizza that has both ham and pineapple,
I fail to see the absurdity of ordering an
item off the menu.
Appetito's: I am pretty certain that I
have never heard of Appetito's being called
if it is not between the hours of 12 a.m. and
1 a.m. and Alfredo's is not picking up the
phone. The prices are cheap but the pizzas
are very small. Dan Symmonds 'll vocalizes the universal frustration felt after
ordering a large pizza with a few friends
only to discover that the pizza is not even
big enough to satisfy your own hunger
pangs: "Fuck Appitito's for marketing a
large pizza in a small box." In addition to
Appetito's selling very small pizzas, the
staff is never particularly friendly. When I
called them to ask if they had any comments about selling pizza to Swarthmore
students, an irresistible PR opportunity,
the employee simply hung up.
Acapulco: Oh dear, what is there to say
about Acapulco Pizza? Although ordering
from Appetito's marks some degree of desperation, true desperation has not hit until
you dial Acapulco. The pizza bears a
strong resemblance to "heat-it-up-yourself" pizzas and, as Anagha KrishnSn 'lO
relates, it is hard to believe that there is
any actual pizza making at this pizza parlor: "I'm pretty sure Acapulco's is just
some guy's basement, and Acapulco is a 40
year old man who buys frozen pizzas at the
supermarket and heats them up in a
microwave oven."

Ron Paul has cultivated political base from farcicals
conservative. It turns out, he's a pretty
charismatic guy whose willingness to speak
out against many of Bush's policies has
earned him recognition from many
Americans eager for drastic change in our
government. But I also feel that overall Ron
Paul isn't the freedom-loving, anti-govern-

ment libertarian his campaign slogans claim
him to be. Often, I found him to be offensively hypocritical.
Ron Paul supports limiting entry into our
country over reforming immigration policies, an opinion many in this country hold.
My concern with his stance on immigration

comes from how he frames the issue as part
of the war on terror. "A nation without
secure borders is no nation at all. It makes
no sense to fight terrorists abroad when our
own front door is left unlocked." But who
can recall the last time our neighbors from
the north or south snuck across the border
into the United States and attacked our

LAUREN MENDOZA

The Big Guns

nation, leaving

When I went home to Austin over winter
break, I was amazed upon my arrival to see
that the city was plastered with Ron Paul
endorsements. While Austin is in Texas,
where Ron Paul serves as a member of the
House of Representatives, Austin is also a
very liberal city. As it turns out, this
Republican candidate has gained support
from enthusiastic libertarians nationwide.
When I asked various people who
claimed that their political leanings were
more to the left than the right about their
decision to support Paul, they all gave me
the same general reply: "He's the most outspoken candidate against the war... fuck
Bush!" I was intrigued, but curious as to
how this platform could be convincing
enough to .persuade a liberal to vote for a

almost

three thousand

Americans dead? While I commend Ron
Paul for being the only conservative candidate to criticize the War on Terror, I do not
feel this validates his incoherent ramblings
about the threat that immigrants pose to our
country's freedom. He even goes so far as to
compare the threat of immigrants to that of
terrorists, saying, "Immigration officials
must track visa holders and deport anyone
who overstays their visa. This is especially
important when we recall that a number of
9/11 terrorists had expired visas." Paul is
using the same brand of fear propaganda
Bush is known for to support his opposition

immigration reform,
encouraging
Americans to fear anyone from the other

to

side of the border because they might be
covert terrorists. Like the other GOP hopefuls he contrasts himself to, he is exploiting

political

the fear Americans have of the possibility of
another 9/11 to gain support for his beliefs.
When it comes to protecting the rights of
an innocent fetus however, Ron Paul is an
enthused advocate for life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. He has been quoted as
opposing the Patriot Act, saying, "The
biggest threat to your privacy is the government." Yet Paul is the main sponsor of the
We the People Act (H.R. 300), which would
nullify Roe vs. Wade, giving states the

authority to make their own legislation to
oppose abortion, violating a woman's right
to privacy as protected in the constitution.

"Ron Paul isn't the
beacon of hope for
America that he
promotes himself to be."
Ron Paul claims, "This is a practical,
direct approach to ending federal court
tyranny which threatens our constitutional
republic and has caused the deaths of 45 million of the unborn." Is Paul is calling the
freedom to choose tyrannical? Paul claims to
be in favor of minimal government interference with citizens, but is then in favor of the
government telling me what to do with my
uterus? It just doesn't make sense.
In a CNN interview during which several newsletters published under Paul's name
were criticized for containing racist, antigay, and anti-Semitic comments, Paul
claimed that he was not a racist and did not
know who wrote the articles, nor read them
when they originally came out in the 80's

and 90's. The comments included suchracist

remarks as, "The criminals who terrorize
our cities in riots and on every non-riot day
are not exclusively young black males, but
they largely are... they are trained to hate
whites... to 'fight the power,' to steal and loot
as much money from the white enemy as

possible." His supporters have labeled this
occurrence as an attempt to smear Paul's
name, but have failed to account for as to
why Paul waited so long to refute the content
of these newsletters and why he has not
taken a stronger course of action regarding
them. And while Paul might not have read
these articles, it does not change the fact that
he should take responsibility for the publishing of these newsletters rather than
pointing the finger of blame in another
direction. He never requested that his name
be removed from the publications, asked for
their retraction or attempted to make any
corrections to the statements. These ignorant statements appeared repeatedly under
Paul's name, and only recently has he chosen to denounce them for the sake of salvaging his public image. His refusal to take

action is a clear demonstration ofhis inability to be a leader.
If you are looking for a presidential candidate who is chiefly opposed to the war,
Ron Paul might be the guy for you. Or if you
favor a balance of parties in power in the federal government, Ron Paul might also be a
fair candidate. But Ron Paul isn't the beacon
of hope for America that he promotes himself to be. He is more like the politicians he
opposes than he openly admits. As far as I
can tell, implementing Paul's policies would
be a huge step backward from where we are
today. Isn't it time to move forward?

community. Listen harder, though, and
you'll gradually pick up on a furtive whisper here, a barely-spoken allegation there,
until before long that warm hum has

taken on a dark and discordant under-

tone.

What you're hearing, fellow Swatties,
is a serious problem. It is a problem not
uncommon in the universe of American
campuses, and regardless of what we can
do or how we may act to combat this problem, its specter will always haunt young
men and women as we come of age, especially here, under the uniquely liberated
and unconstrained lifestyle that a college
campus offers. Still, in trusting, tight-knit
communities like the Swarthmore campus, this problem is a serious one, an
insidious affliction that threatens to
undermine the cherished foundations of
our community that is, our trust and
faith in one another.
What is this problem? It is sexual
assault, and more important for our campus, the prevailing silence around inci-

dents of sexual assault and misconduct in
our community. In light of certain developments, which I am still trying to grasp
fully, I felt a pressing need to voice my
concerns in a very public way so as to convey just how dangerous I think this problem is for our otherwise cozy little campus.

First, of course, I must make due note
of positive aspects of campus culture in
regard to this issue. There is formalized
student organization around sexual
assault, widespread support for survivors
among the student body, as well as an
understanding of their needs and sensitivities, and institutional policy that clearly
outlines what constitutes sexual misconduct and how it is dealt with, internally
and external to the College. All of these
realities are encouraging reminders that
we as a community understand the gravity of this issue and how important it is to
combat both the trend and the persistent
silence surrounding it.

Thls problem is a serious
one, an insidious
affliction that threatens
to undermine the
cherished foundations of

our community.
Beyond this encouraging aspect of our
community's dealings with sexual assault
there is a darker underbelly to the reality,
one where the seeming solidarity of the
community is

abandoned for more frac-

letters

to

tious and divisive politics and where its
ostensibly peaceful surface is betrayed as
deeply troubled. If you were here last
semester, for instance, you were at some

point unavoidably privy to the more clandestine conversation going on, a conversation of which I myself only caught wind
near the semester's close. A flurry of
hushed exchanges and furtive whispers in
Essie Mae's; knowing, slidelong glances at
parties in Paces and Olde Club; highly
sensitive or downright hurtful allegations
on Facebook and the Daily Jolt; and rampant rumor-mongering in Sharpies
together, these things represented a part
of campus life to which I have sadly
-

remained oblivious, and a part of campus
life that deeply troubles me.
I would like to address the use of substances like alcohol in the campus hookup
culture, or subtler still, the dangerous
"mob mentality," real or perceived, that
seemingly manifests itself in various
organizational cultures on campus. In the
end, though, I think it is most productive
to draw attention to this under-the-table
treatment of these issues within our own
social circles and beyond institutionalized
dialogue. The torrent of whispered suspicions belies a dangerous way of sublimating and never quite processing the
destructive effect sexual assault has on

our trust—not just between the parties
involved and their friendship circles, but
also in the community as a whole. Open
and difficult conversations between
friends and outside of formal dialogue and
institutional structure are necessary if we
are to hold each other accountable in a
healthy manner. Pursuing these ends will
preserve what is so precious about
Swarthmore's scene: a feeling of safety
and security in knowing that you are not

more assuring still, among good-hearted,
well-intentioned Swatties.

Open and difficult
conversations between

...

The best ways of dealing with these
matters are necessarily the ones which
garner the least attention, and I know that
they are already well established here.
Even now, as I pen this somewhat vague
and foreboding column, I am conflicted as
to whether it should be published at all.
Ultimately, though, this stuff hurts my
heart like, for realz, you guys and that
it has to go down in this way isn't okay.
The fact that for so long I blithely counted
Swarthmore amongst the exceptions to
the rule makes me doubly eager to hold
myself accountable, and put it out there so
that all of us can begin examining the
challenge at hand in a less destructive,
more inclusive way. To this end, I hope
that we'll begin those healthier and more
open, albeit difficult, honest conversations about how, in big ways and small, we
can all be a part of the problem, and also
its solution.

DU responds to sexual assualt SSSL Bad Stats
On behalf of the brothers of Delta Upsilon, I would like
to publicly reaffirm our commitment to standing against
and working to prevent all forms of sexual violence. My
purpose in writing this letter is to share some of the work
that DU has engaged in over the last year in becoming better prepared to prevent and deal with instances of sexual
assault. More importantly, I would like to detail some ofthe
steps we plan to take in continuing our commitment to
actively creating a safer campus.

Delta Upsilon takes preventing
sexual violence very seriously and
personally, which is why we are
also commited to engaging in
dialogue with other campus
groups to form a united front.
...

We learned from the Clothesline and Handprint projects
in Spring 2006 that it is not enough to say we are against
sexual violence; we need to take action. The first step we
took was to invite members of the SMART team to a DU
meetjng in order to hear a new perspective on the role DU
can and must play. We continued to work with SMART and
the Deans Office to amend our constitution to specifically
address sexual misconduct. The amendment includes
specifics on making the house safer for all guests, holding
brothers accountable and working to prevent sexual
assault. Furthermore, it requires that all new brothers go
through a fraternity-specific ASAP workshop run by

THE PHOENIX

SMART, which deals with general prevention issues as well
as those specific to ensuring that the DU house is a safe
social space. Our newest members went through this training before being initiated.
While we are proud of these successes we recognize that
we still have much to learn and even more to do in order to
truly call ourselves allies. For this reason, we are continuing our efforts. During February, all brothers who were not
required to go through the first DU-ASAP training will take
part in a second round of the workshops. Additionally, we
will ensure that at least one brother is a member of SMART
and ASAP next year and will also post a SMART poster in
the house for quick reference. We will take steps to make
parties safer by posting signs indicating which brothers
present at each party are designated to deal with issues
such as an unhealthy partygoer or someone relentlessly
bothering others with undesired sexual advances.
Delta Upsilon takes preventing sexual violence very
seriously and personally, which is why we are also committed to engaging in dialogue with other campus groups in
order to form a united front. First, we would like to hold an
informal meeting next week for anyone interested in talking with us about the role DU can take in preventing sexual assault on campus. In the following weeks, we will extend
an invitation to the other brotherhoods and men's groups
on campus (Phi Psi, ABLLE, athletics, etc.) to come together to discuss and commit to fighting sexual violence on campus.
I wouldlike to reiterate thatDelta Upsilon stands strongly against sexual violence and will continue to work to
make DU and Swarthmore a safer place. I hope that this letter can open positive dialogue. Please contact me with any

comments, concerns or questions.

The Swarthmore Students Supporting Life have recently plastered the campus with posters. These posters state

various statistical "facts" about issues such as abortion.
These statistics are stated without reference or citation.
First, statistics are not facts about a population.
Statistics are functions of sample data. These functions are
then used to estimate population parameters through statistical inference. Such estimates are often subject to biases in their measurement, interpretation and presentation.

The statistics in question are
stated without citation
[SSSL members] would be better
served by providing some
indication of where their
information is coming from.
...

Second, and more importantly, we cannot even begin to
discuss such issues when the statistics in question are stated without citation. Statistics without citation are contentless. The fact that I also disagree with many of SSSL's

respect their desire to express it publicly. However, if their

Awareness essential
In addition to the news coverage we present
in this issue regarding the issue of sexual
assault and how it is handled on this campus,
we received, independent of our editorial guidance, unsolicited opinions pieces this week
expressing concern over the prevalence of sexual assault and the silence that accompanies it.

We cannot remain silent
when confronted with the
undeniable presence of
sexual assault on our
campus.
To us, this clearly demonstrates that the
question of sexual assault on campus is one that
warrants serious discussion and to date, it has
not adequately been explored in a public forum.
While there are aspects of the administrative procedures, for prosecuting sexual assault
that some argue do not best serve the interest of
the victims, we wish to acknowledge several

recent decision was in part due to
congressional pressure on endowment spending.
This is not to be overly cynical.
Tuition relief is a worthy goal, even
if it does stem from mixed motiva-

mechanisms that are effective in helping with
the healing and counseling process for victims
of sexual assault. The SMART team's ongoing

support of victims throughout their ordeal has
been indispensable in helping many of these
students work through their options. We hope
that our news coverage of the issue of sexual
assault does not discourage victims from seeking support from the administrators or student
resources like the SMART team and Swat
Survivors. While we understand and are concerned that printing these articles could potentially trigger an emotional reaction in individuals whose lives have been affected by sexual

assault, it is our sincere hope that the primary
effect will be increased public awareness of
these issues, which we hope will be a positive
force in preventing or minimizing sexual violence on campus in the future.
As a community known for challenging
norms and questioning the status quo, we cannot remain silent when confronted with the
undeniable presence of sexual assault on our
own campus. We encourage readers to respond
to the coverage in this week's issue and welcome letters to continue the discussion on the
pages of this publication and beyond.

Clothes Line Saga
At a series of fireside chats last
semester about the policy-making
and financial operations of the college, terms like "social change,"
"equality" and
need it bear
repeating
"ethical intelligence"
were off the table. In their place,
"complexity," "prudence" and "stability" became the catchphrases du
jour.

Maybe this should not be so surprising. Newspaper headlines warn
of imminent economic recession in
this country, which rightfully concerns Swarthmore's high-level

administrators

much. In an expected move, the
Senate Finance Committee, led by
Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), demanded detailed information from the
136 wealthiest universities in the
United States about their tuition
prices, financial aid policies and

endowment management. Congress
is threatening to require universities to spend five percent of their
endowments just like it does other
non-profit financial institutions.
Last week's editorial in The
Phoenix wondered if Swarthmore's
decision to end its practice of loaning money as part of its financial
aid packages was in part due to
pressure to compete with rival
institutions pursuing similar policies. I have no doubt that this influenced the decision, but that pressure has existed for about a year, as
schools with smaller endowments
than Swarthmore made similar
moves in early 2007. The policy
change is part of a series of much
more recent moves by the wealthiest institutions of higher learning
being targeted by the Senate.
The same week that Swarthmore
changed its financial aid policy,
Harvard and Yale Universities
decided to extend financial aid
grants to "middle-income" and
"upper-middle-income" families at
unprecedented levels, while the

University of Pennsylvania made a
change similar to Swarthmore's. A

week later, the Senate Finance
Committee made its request for
financial information from all of
these universities. According to a
Jan. 22 New York Times opinion
article by Roger Lehecka, a consultant for scholarship programs for
needy students,
and Andrew
Delbanco, the director of American
studies at Columbia University,
Yale President Richard Levin openly admits that his university's

before these most recent policies,
the contemporary financial policies of wealthy institutions of higher learning have been having this
effect. Between 2004 and 2006, 26 of
the top 30 liberal arts colleges saw a
decline in the number of Pell Grant-

eligible students attending.

So when Swarthmore decides to
make a surprise change to its financial aid policy after months of

emphasizing prudence and complexity, our cynicism need not be
directed towards the change itself,
but towards the potential of the college to be an agent for social change
in providing the opportunity of
elite higher education. Maybe the
Senate's proposed five percent is
arbitrary or not sound policy. Such
a proposal, however, indicates a
perception of institutions like
Swarthmore as tending to follow
rather than to lead; tending to
wring one's hands in myopic fright
rather than move boldly towards
the future.

Our cynicism [should
be directed]... toward
the potential of the
college to be an agent
for social change.
If Swarthmore is to jump to the
head of the pack in this regard, it
should formulate a wide-ranging

plan to spend money to fund lowat
income
students
while
Swarthmore, and recruit more lowincome students not only straight
out of high school, but also as com-

munity college transfer students.

Last month, Swarthmore sent out
an e-mail hurriedly announcing the
recent change, only to be followed

by a Student Council-induced clarifying e-mail a few days later. This
will not do and will not convince
anyone of a fundamental commitment to being an institution of
greater opportunity that embraces
President Al Bloom's proposed
creed of ethical intelligence, social
change and equal opportunity.
Swarthmore's best chances for

institutional
will
inevitably be coupled with compre-

hensive demonstrations of*the
inner light of social justice that has
been the college's rhetorical creed
since its founding.

Tough break for men's b-ball Youth craze

It seemed like a comeback was in the works when
the Garnet successfully put
a stop to their four game
skid with what can only be
described as a merciless
bludgeoning of Philadelphia

they dominated the visiting

squad by 42 points.
Rolling this energy into
their next home game, the

Garnet wrenched a victory
from Washington College in
a thrilling 93-87 double over-

time victory.
The visiting Shoremen

offensive showing of the season while simultaneously
getting blown away by the

With renewed vigor, the

Women's squad galvanized by loss
BY SARAH REYNOLDS
sreynol2@swarthmore.edu

The
Swarthmore
Women's
Basketball team put up a strong showing this Saturday, Jan. 26 when the
squad traveled to Collegeville, PA to
face the Ursinus Bears. The Garnet fell
just short as they lost to the defending
Centennial Conference Champion 62-53.
into
Going
Saturday,
the
Swarthmore women knew that they
would have a tough game ahead of them
and they prepared knowingly, according to captain Karen Berk 'OB. "Ursinus
is a team that isranked high in the conference so we knew we had a challenge
ahead of us. I think we rose to the challenge and we played really well. We had
practiced defending their offense really
well so we were really prepared," Berk

said.
This preparation showed early on.
Swat jumped out to a 25-10 lead in the
beginning of the game. "We started off
really strong," forward Kathryn
Stockbower 'll said. "I think we surprised ourselves because we knew that
Ursinus was a really strong team. We
got ahead by a lot in the beginning and
that was great," she said.
By halftime, Ursinus had closed
Swat's lead to four points, 29-25. The
game stayed even for the majority of the
second half, until the Bears went on a
12-2 run to put them up ten points with
four minutes left to play. "They went on
a run at the end of the game and for

whatever reason we-couldn't manage to
close the gap," Stockbower said. The
Bears held onto the lead, finishing the
game nine points ahead of Swat for the
win.
The majority of the play on both
sides of the court was dominated by
strong performances by the women in
the paint. The sophomore Ursinus center Carolyn Kostanzer scored the game
high of 24 points along with nine
rebounds.

"We haven't lost faith in
ourselves or our team
and we're learning from
each game."
Karen Berk 'OB

...

For the garnet, Berk had a team high
of 20 points along with eight rebounds.
The freshman powerhouse, Stockbower,
posted her 13th double-double with 15
points and a game-high 13 rebounds.
The Swat guards also added some
impressive stats with Laura Popovics
'OB, who posted a career-high eight
assists, and Pam Costello 'lO, who finished with four assists and nine points.
Swat owned the paint, out-rebounding the Bears 46-38. Unfortunately, this
margin was balanced by the 21-14
turnover deficit. This would prove to be

the turning point of the game. "I thinkit
came down to turnovers in the second
half," Berk said. The team identified
two areas of focus for their remaining
decreasing
games
this
season:
turnovers and owning the boards.
Specifically, Stockbower says they look
to "stop the other team from scoring on
their offensive rebounds."
With eight games left in the season,
the Garnet women hope to finish strong
after coming off some tough losses during winter break. "I'm still looking forward to a couple of good wins,"
Stockbower said. "I know we can pull
through the losing streak we've been
having. I think things will start coming
together. Our game Saturday is evidence that we can play with some of the
best teams in the conference," she said.
The team has kept a positive attitude
and looks to keep improving its play,
according to Berk. "We haven't lost
faith in ourselves or our team and we're
learning from each game and moving
forward," she said.
The Ursinus Bears, now on a four
game winning streak, look to continue
their competitive play in the Centennial
Conference. The Swat women's team (412 overall, 1-9 CC) faces rival Haverford

on Wednesday, Jan. 30, although the
final score will not be available before

publication time. The Garnet will next
travel to Franklin and Marshall
College's campus to face the Diplomats
in a double header with the men's team
on Saturday, Feb. 2.

cerned about the
media hype and
unrealistic expectations placed on young play-

ers.

Specifically, the rate at which bigger
European football teams have been acquiring
the best of the future is alarming. The spotlight
is usually on the bigger clubs like Chelsea,
Barcelona, Milan, Manchester Utd, etc. as the
media tends to focus on superstars and anything
headline-worthy.
This month, Milan signed a well publicized
contract with Alexandre Pato, a highly skilled
18-year-old with the potential to become a world

great. Without much hesitation, the media
labeled him as "the next Ronaldo" even before
he made his Milan debut earlier this month.
Carlo Ancelotti, Milan's manager, quite confidently predicted that Pato would win the Ballon
D'or, an award recognizing the most talented
player in Europe.

I'm concerned about the
media hype and unrealistic
expectations placed on
young players.
I guess once someone is 18 or 19 you can
argue that he or she has a reasonably well-devel-

oped sense of self. Some of the players entering
professional clubs, however, are as young as 16!
Theo Walcott made his Arsenal debut at that age
and now his manager, Arsene Wenger, known
for turning promising youth players into fullfledged footballers, admitted that he was not
happy with Walcott's -progress. I'm not surprised.
Two years ago, he was touted as England's
hottest prospect and even made it to the World
Cup, the most prestigious sporting event worldwide. He constantly made the headlines. He was
only 17! At that age, I was a carefree teenager
while he had the burden of an entire nation resting on his shoulders. That kind of pressure
could falsely build up your confidence, your ego
and be very harmful for your development, not
only as a soccer player but also as a human
being.
Vanderlei Luxemburgo, ex-Brazil and Santos
manager, recently spoke out against the exodus
of Brazilian talent to top European football clubs
and believes South American countries should
restrict players under 23 from transferring.
While I don't agree with him completely, I do
think that everyone should finish high school
before going professional.
Sure, for many players football is a way out
of poverty and a weak educational system. Not
everyone has the means to attend school and
that problem needs to be addressed soon. But for
players to be complete, professional athletes, the
media's obsession with something young, something dazzling needs to cease. In the meantime,
public fascination with youthful stars may do
more harm than good.

Garnet crushes hapless Cavaliers

Ylmei Zou Phoenix Staff

After a month-long reprieve followed by a rigorous training trip to Puerto Rico, the women's and men's swim teams dominated Cabrini in their first home meet of the semester.

BY BEN RAPHEL

braphell@swarthmore.edu

Fresh off their training trip to Puerto Rico, the
Swarthmore men's and women's swimming teams scored
significant victories on Saturday against Cabrini College,
in their first home meet of the semester. The men (3-4, 2-1
CC) rolled to a 154-41 victory over the non-conference
opponent Cavaliers, while the women (5-2, 3-0 CC) won by
the score of 143-105.
Casey Osborne 'lO said that the team was anxious to
compete again after four weeks away from Swarthmore
and an exhilarating trip to Puerto Rico. "Training trip
always signifies a turning point in the season where
everyone begins to shift their sights towards the
Centennial Conference Championships," Osborne said,
adding that the team returned home "sore and sunburned, but with a renewed desire to make the hard work
pay off in every race leading up to our championship."

Both Garnet teams got off to a quick start, as the men
and women each won their 200-yard medley relays. In the
next contested event, Chelsea Brett 'll won the women's
200-yard freestyle with a time of 2:03.01. Brett said that the
team's impressive performance on Saturday bodes well
for a strong showing in future competitions. "We've been
working really hard and I think that it is going to pay off
at the conference meet and at our meet this Saturday
against Gettysburg," Brett said.
Following Brett's victory was Michael Ahn 'lO, who
clocked in with a time of 1:50.81 to win the men's 200-yard
freestyle. This dominance continued throughout the day,
and the Garnet lost only four total contested events overall. All-American sophomore Anne Miller 'lO added two
decisive wins to the women's record.
Not only was Swarthmore faster than Cabrini, but
they outnumbered the Cavaliers as well. A few events,
such as the 1000-yard freestyle, did not feature any
Cabrini swimmers. After clinching victories on both the

men's and women's sides, the Garnet did not even count
their results toward the final score for six of the later
events.
"For the Cabrini meet, the team went in expecting to
do well, but I was really impressed how hard everyone
swam when they had no competition," Doug GilchristScott 'O9 said.
"People still went out and raced, and used [the meet] as

good practice."

In addition to the 200-yard freestyle victory, Ahn won
the 200-yard IM relay, which was run as an exhibition
race, with a time of 1:50.81. Also getting two wins for the
men was Gilchrist-Scott, who won both the 100-yard butterfly (56.69) and the 100-yard freestyle (50.01). Anne
Miller 'lO doubled up for victories on the women's side, as
she won both the 200-yard butterfly (2:12.98) and the 500yard freestyle (5:30.33).

The women's team faced Bryn Mawr at home yesterday, in a Centennial Conference competition. This
Saturday at 2 p.m., both Garnet swim teams will have
their last home meets of the season at Ware Pool, when
they face off against Gettysburg.
The Bullets are currently undefeated in the conference
on both the men's and women's sides, so this will be a
very important meet in regards to conference standings.
"They match up with us really well, so it should be a
hard-fought meet and extremely close," Gilchrist-Scott
said, in regards to Gettysburg. "We beat them last year, so
there's no reason we can't do it again, we just have to step
it up."
Osborne said that the team's current momentum
would help carry them through another tough contest
this weekend. "We hope that this win against Cabrini will
springboard us to another great meet against Gettysburg
this weekend, which is sure to be a dogfight," she said.
Miller said that the team is particularly motivated to
win this Saturday because it is the seniors' final at-home
competition. "This Saturday against Gettysburg is going
to be a big test of our team's strength and spirit ...I think
we can [win] because this team has managed to come
together for difficult meets before and we will all want to
give the seniors a great last home meet," Miller said.
Swarthmore will use these meets to help prepare for
the all-important conference championships, which will

According to Anne Miller 'lO, the team is already modifying its training schedule in preparation for the culminating event. "The team is getting ready to start tapering for
conferences. We are looking good and I think everyone
will perform well," Miller said.
