Cartoonist speaks on race, war and wit
BY SARAH STANTON
sstantol@swarthmore.edu

People have called Aaron McGruder a
master satirist, an anti-Semite, a reverse
racist, a funny guy. Few speakers on the
Swarthmore campus could provoke as wide
a range of reactions as the creator of the
nationally syndicated comic strip "The
Boondocks" did here on Saturday night.
Speaking to an audience that well exceeded the 400-seat capacity of Lang Concert
Hall, McGruder spent nearly two hours discussing a variety of often uncomfortable
subjects as people crowded into the aisles
and onto the stage. He created dialogue with
the audience by inviting people to shout out
their questions or comments as he spoke.
Anna Perng 'O3, who helpedbring McGruder
to campus, said she hoped this dialogue
would continue long after McGruder had
left.
Perng and Rebecca Amdemariam 'O3
wrote the proposal for a Cooper Foundation
grant to bring McGruder largely as a
response to what they saw as stagnation in
the discussion of race relations on campus.
After an incident last semester in which
a student wore blackface to the Mary Lyon
Halloween party, the Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Student Society put together an
educational series designed to promote discussion, but it was poorly attended.
"Students were held up by their own prejudices" from seeing those events, Perng said.
"We really thought that Aaron would give
everybody a kick in the pants."

McGruder opened his speech by declaring, "I am not a motivational speaker. I'm
not here to get you excited, to make you feel
energetic and motivated ... I'm not going to
spit a lot of rhetoric and make you feel good

The talk provoked emotional responses
from many audience members, including
clapping, laughter, tense silence and even an
"Amen!" but few students reported feeling
comfortable the entire time. Perng, using the
words of a New York Times Magazine headline about McGruder, called him an "equal
opportunity offender." In his talk Saturday,
he criticized people ranging from George W.
Bush to Jesse Jackson. "No one could sit and
be smug the whole time," Perng said.
The talk covered a variety of issues,
including his experiences creating the strip,
war in Iraq, presidential elections, affirmative action and the lack of leadership on the
political left. The only issue on which
McGruder refused to comment was the

Israel-Palestine conflict.
"I live and work in Hollywood," he said.
"I will never talk about Israel-Palestine
because I am trying to make a living."
Throughout the talk, McGruder introduced
topics in a fairly agreeable way, pushed

them to the point of discomfort and finally
released some of the tension through laughter. But, for many students, the discomfort

lingers.
"I found myself agreeing, then kind of
realizing I'd been duped," Steve Huang 'O5
said of McGruder's arguments.
Although Huang felt as though confusion
might be beneficial hi making the audience
think, Perng said she often hears this comment presented as a criticism of McGruder's
talk. "The main complaint I heard from students is that they couldn't tell when he was
joking or not," Perng said. "But me and
Rebecca think that's why he's so brilliant.
It's refreshing to have a speaker who can
blur that line" to deliberately make students
think, she said.

about yourselves."

English Department Chair Chuck James
described this confusion as the mark of good

satire. "People get bamboozled by the ambiguities of it," he said. "It can be an unpopular mode, because it's hard to nail down."
Through laughter, however, satire can allow
people to explore difficult issues, such as
race relations, that they generally may be
uncomfortable or unwilling to discuss on
their own, he said. James described
McGruder as "an artful dodger but a very
clever fellow" who had read the audience

well.

Many students remained perplexed
about McGruder's stance on affirmative
action. He began this section of his talk by
saying he "would be kicking white people
out of school," which provoked some audience applause. As McGruder continued,
"when white people struggle, I get confused,"
claiming that white people in poverty must
be doing something wrong, the room became
almost painfully silent. He broke this silence
by saying, "Come on people, I'm joking!
Did you forget what I do for a living?"

Aaron McGruder created The Boondocks.

...

Perng suggested this might have been a
"lesson for Swatties. Be careful what you

clap for." Both she and Huang said that, after
his talk, McGruder explained that part ofhis
intent is to make people realize how easily
they can be convinced by a talented speaker.
McGruder acknowledged this power
inherent in his satire, saying, "I can blend
the truth with hyperbole and blatant lies
effortlessly, and I never have to tell you
when I'm doing what."
For some students, this ambiguity
remains a problem. One student approached
Perng with concerns that by leaving "so
many open ends," McGruder might have
been supporting anti-Semitism or racism.
Perng responded that if students are concerned that people on campus have those
feelings, the campus community may have

larger issues to work on than those that can

be addressed through one speech. "I think
this is just the beginning for a lot of students
in realizing that there is a larger community at Swarthmore we need to work on," she

said.

Whether they agreed or understood all of
his opinions, students interviewed seemed
to agree that McGruder was a valuable
speaker for the campus. John Anderson 'O3
said McGruder had discussed "a lot of critical insights about leftist and black politics
that I wasn't familiar with. It was very educational." Jeremy Cristol 'O5 mentioned the
relevance of McGruder's ideas about "playing to win" in politics to campus activist
groups.
Perng hopes that students can continue
to look beyond Aaron McGruder himself and

"focus on what members of this community
think, because that's what really, really matters."

"I would like to say we wouldn't be swayed
by that consideration. I do think that we're
realistic, though," Burstein said. "I would
hope that we would consult with members of
the finance committee to figure out how far
they're willing to go."
"I hope we present to the board a proposal
for a 'living wage' that we think is morally
right and solidly grounded in our research.
And I recognize that the board will not necessarily grant us everything we propose," Brown

said.

While there is no guarantee that the board
would approve of the proposal, some are optimistic, especially given the support for a "living wage" here at the college.
"I feel it is possible for the college to find
the amount of money we will propose,"
Bradbury said.
The committee has been gathering "living
wage" data from Women's Association for
Women's Alternatives and the Economic
Policy Institute. Depending on family size and
location, estimates for a "living wage" in areas
surrounding Swarthmore range from just over
$8 an hour to over $2O an hour. According to
the committee's Preliminary Data on Target
for a Living Wage, most of the estimates center
in on the $lO to $l6 area.
"These numbers will no doubt serve to
inform the proceedings of the committee. That
said, I know we're also realistic about what
would actually be approved by the board,"

Burstein said.

The
Living
and Democracy
Campaign, which is not affiliated with the ad
hoc committee, has determined a "living
wage" to be $l3 an hour, according to Delgado.
Currently, Swarthmore pays its lowest-wage
workers $9 an hour.
The committee is also looking at ways to
keep the hourly wage down while increasing
non-monetary forms of compensation such as
subsidized childcare, housing and transportation, according to Burstein.

Three sent to hospital after falls
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

Public Safety has transported
three students to the hospital recently, probably from ice-related injuries.
Two students fell on Sunday, Feb.
23, between 6 and 8 p.m., Director of
Public Safety Owen Redgrave said,
and a third was hurt several days
before.

Ice-coated paths plagued campus.

Assistant Director ofPublic Safety
Leon Francis was not sure of the
cause of the falls, but he suspected
they were all due to ice. "There were
icy conditions. Let's put it that way,"
he said.
After the students fell, Public

"We've had people staying each
evening and on weekends," he said.

ebucknel@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore and 26 other liberal arts colleges have filed an
amicus curiae, or "friend of the
court," brief with the Supreme
Court in support of the
University of Michigan's admissions policy.
The Court plans to hear the
case on the use of affirmative
action in Michigan's admissions
policies on April 1, when the two
separate lawsuits involved in the
case, Grutter vs. Bollinger and
Gratz vs. Bollinger, are brought
before the Court.
The lawsuits were filed by
white students at Michigan who
criticized undergraduate admissions system. The system is based
on a 150-point scale and awards a
20-point bonus to black, Hispanic
and American Indian applicants.
The Court's decision is expected to have widespread implications for institutions of higher

learning.
The brief urges the Court to
permit colleges and universities
to consider race as one of the
many factors used to ensure a

"If the Supreme Court further
constrains the use of affirmative
action strategies in college
admissions, it will be much more
difficult for us to sustain the level

According to Michigan's sta-

Swarthmore's decision to sign
the brief, said Amherst had invited Swarthmore to participate.
Eldridge said he believed the
court case was significant not
merely for social and ethical reasons but also because of its broader implications for the educational system.
"One of the points the brief
raises is that educators should be
the ones to best decide educational policies, not the courts,"
Eldridge said.
Eldridge said it was important

The

recent proposal for the creation

open forums and a large campus
event
each semester. Bill
Wanjohi 'O5, Jon Rosa 'O3 and
Mara Gustafson 'O3 wrote the
proposal.
The purpose of the multicultural educational hall will be to
"enhance the ability of a diverse
group of students to engage in

in-depth learning about living
in a diverse community, plus
develop skills and leadership
qualities that will help lead the
campus to better understanding
of the issues of a multicultural

Wanjohi said that a domestic

student from Pomona
College had introduced him to
exchange

multicultural education halls.
"Swat is similar to Pomona in
terms of our interest in promoting
multicultural affairs,"
Wanjohi said. "But we haven't
gotten far in that pursuit."
All students except entering
first-years will be allowed to
apply to live in the multicultural
hall through a joint submission
with a roommate. No sophomores on the hall will be allowed
to occupy singles and must apply
in pairs.
Students will be able to apply

The details have not been
completely worked out yet, but
the hall will not be a "Noah's

of each race, religion, sexual

gaps in composition. Westphal
said they would try to gather "a

experiences."

Both Wanjohi and Westphal

loose so as to allow the students
participating to flesh out the
hall's function on campus.

But the hall could function
simply as an experience for the
students living in it, in which
case the selection committee

decide to do.
"It is an experience intended
for the enrichment of the people
directly involved," Wanjohi said.
"However, hopefully, the interactions of that core group will

reach the entire campus."
Westphal said most halls

College ID may get facelift
BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu

Prompted by Student Council, the publications department is working on a new
design for student identification cards to
make them more aesthetically pleasing.
"Instead of IDs that look like they're
made in somebody's basement, they'll have
something that is more professional,"
Student Council Appointments Chair Chris
Ciarleglio 'O4 said. "Right now, our IDs
don't even say 'Swarthmore College.' They
don't have the word 'college' on them, which
I think is important to have."
According to Ciarleglio, the process
began earlier this year, when Student
Council decided to address "upgrading the
aesthetics of the ID." Ciarleglio recently
designed a few model cards to present to the
council. Last week, in a meeting with staff
members from Publications and Dining
Services, Ciarleglio gave the designs to

"I will be adding to some of the designs
that Chris came up with, which are quite
attractive, and assembling a portfolio of
design options for Student Council to look
at, maybe in a month," Stern said. "Visual

elements on the card may include the traditional college logo, color photography,
blended background and watermark. We
will have to assess what kind of new technology might be required to produce cards
with any given graphic effect."
Lott said he was unsure of the cost of the
cards and of who would fund them.
The basic function of the cards will probably not change. However, the introduction
of new cards may come with a change in the
software that controls the meal plans,
according to Scott Tutton, back-of-house
manager for Dining Services.
Currently, CBORD software keeps track
of how many meals and points students use.

Due to its age, CBORD is "reaching the end
of its life," Tutton said.

to
According
Dining
Services
Administrative Assistant Lynn Grady,
Swarthmore has used CBORD since 1996,
and it is "becoming obsolete," which means
more difficulty in repairing and replacing
broken items. Grady said Dining Services
was planning to upgrade the meal card system anyway and has been looking into software other than CBORD with the hope of
running a new system by next semester.

"Right now, our IDs don't
even say 'Swarthmore
College."
Chris Ciarleglio 'O4
A new system would not necessarily
mean expansions in meal plan options.
Tutton said that, at least initially, there
would be no changes in the meal plan.
Following the implementation of a new system, it would be at least six more months
before any such changes might take place.
New cards would not be necessary for
the new meal plan software system, because
any card with a magnetic strip would work.
Tutton added that "during our research,
we visited several local colleges to observe
their meal plans in action and were able to
see a variety of ID cards. Some of them were
very impressive, with artwork or full-color

photos of campus buildings."

Even before Student Council's move to
change the cards, Tutton said, he felt that
"our IDs could benefit from a facelift."
On a more practical level, Tutton said he
hoped a new card would be more sturdy and
include a larger-print identification number to help checkers and cashiers.
Ciarleglio said the college could distribute the cards next year or the year after,
probably only to entering students.

will be considered, including those inexperienced in

Students on Sharpies
Love it or leave it, Sharpies is here to stay. The Phoenix asked
what you thought of this college center of culinary and social life.
BY ELENA CUFFARI

ecuffarl@swarthmore.edu

My favorite foods at Sharpies are both boring and
constant: spinach leaves with mushrooms and balsamic vinegar, lentil stew, organic peanut butter,
grapefruit, oatmeal, basically every option of cake
or cookie, all frozen yogurt offerings, unsweetened
iced tea, cupfuls of mini M&Ms. Picky as I am, I can

pretty much always find something matching my
criteria, and, if not, I just have four desserts instead
of three.
This piece is not about my eating habits, luckily,
or anyone who has devoured this issue of The
Phoenix cover to cover and is now eating alone in
Tarble would slip into a coma of either the sheer
boredom or sugar variety. Come now, hasn't The
Phoenix been a more faithful lonely lunch companion than that? This is actually a riveting and meticulous survey of the tastes and habits of the people
whom I see at Sharpies on a semi-random basis.
Students' reactions to Sharpies are fairly diverse,
yet on the whole surprisingly positive.
Nate Wessler 'O4, recently returned from a semester abroad in Rome, is a big fan of Greek Bar. "When
orgasmic," Wessler relatthey have baklava, it's
ed. (See? Told you this topic is exciting.)
David Berger 'O4, also back from a semester
abroad, was less enthusiastic about his return to
Swarthmore fare. "Even in Prague, a city not known
for its food, I did not miss Sharpies," Berger
informed me recently. "Wing Bar is the only thing I
...

like."

In these final frigid
winter days, sometimes
our only solace is the
warm and fuzzy feeling
of a full stomach.

"When they have baklava, it's

Sharpies can be an intimidating place to come
back to after a lengthy absence, as evidenced by the
reaction of Milena Velis 'O5, who lives off-campus
and normally takes her meals in an arguably less
sanitary but perhaps equally predictable

Barn

kitchen. Gracing Sharpies with her presence at dinner the other night, this self-sufficient sophomore
balked at the sheer volume of the Dining Hall
throng.

"I forgot how much I miss socializing with all my

February 27, 2003

friends at Sharpies," Velis commented dryly.
Watching her poke her simple spaghetti with
marinara sauce and side of steamed corn after battling through the food lines, I realized that Pasta Bar
night might not have been the best opportunity to
get an off-campus reaction to Sharpies cuisine,
i
Perhaps Velis would have had a better time had
she picked up a few pointers from Jocelyn Braddock
'O4, an expert at making things fun. Braddock, who
offers an insightful distinction between "regular"
foods (hummus) and "rotating" foods (the various
"bars," non-fat mint 'n' cookies frozen yogurt, etc.),
advised a creative approach to Sharpies dining.

"Even in Prague, a city not
known for its food, I did not
miss Sharpies."

David Berger 'O4
"I love people who create new foods," Braddock
gushed. "It's an art." She went on to explain her own
artistic endeavors: "I make omelettes now all the
time. I move from obsession to obsession."
Alejandro Acevedo Ali 'O4 also enjoys the creative opportunities offered by the Wok Station,
though he favors one of my beloved standards:
"Every time there is spinach in the salad bar, I make
a salad," Alejandro shared. Perhaps I have found a
kindred spirit.
Even if you don't generally come for the food,
there are other worthy attractions specific to
Sharpies, like its active, potentially overwhelming
role in your social life. Marissa Vahlsing 'O6, a selfdescribed "outgoing and provocative" first-year,
warned, "If you're not careful, Sharpies can become
the epicenter of your universe."
And if you're still not convinced that you ought to
be taking your solitary lunch-eating self to Sharpies
more often, Swarthmore's own Inflight Rock Band is
playing a gig in the small room this Friday. So now
your spinach and baklava come with free, live entertainment, too.
Really, though, everyone has something they like
at Sharpies. Sharpies Checker Jean Gadbois, whose
favorite dish is meatballs, summed up my semi-scientific findings nicely. "The food is always good
here," she said.

I want candy
Need a sugar rush? Try out these fast-acting sweets,
available at Target
but please, don't forget to brush up
afterwards, or those rotten teeth will become a reality.
Like its more acknowledged sister stimulant, caffeine,
Swarthmore life sometimes just demands sugar. All
healthy, crunchy, deliciously fiber-y foods have their
place. Eat them, feel virtuous, poop regularly and rejoice
but none will fill the void sometimes. Doubt it? Then
you’re in denial. You’d better believe that at three in the
morning, slogging away at a seminar paper due several
hours ago, when the Mountain
Dew runs out, you won’t want
that damn banana you stole

gummy, so yummy. In your

about things that aren’t cool,

is a lifestyle. To paraphrase

“sugar high” is a natural

to the Greatest Place on Earth,
also known, in common terms as Target.
After wandering blindly, and almost impulse-buying an
array of items including giant green Hulk hands that
make smashing sound effects, “Dude, Where’s My Car?”
on DVD, and a very creepy cupcake kit, I finally found
my way to the candy. Two aisles of pure, unrefined, high-fructose joy, not even counting the
spill-overs into the “Easter stuff” section. I
would have walked off with it all, and ended
up very sick, but for one small problem: I am
very poor. So with the 10 dollars whose withdrawal literally halved my checking account, I
picked the cream of the candy crop, what I
hoped was a representative sample of frightening, wonderful and delicious variations in life’s

Peaches, bananas and everything fine
Spice up your love life with fresh tips on how to bring food into a tasty threesome
There have been several
memorable Hollywood scenes

(especially from B movies) in

which food and sex have been
used in creative and exciting
ways, and the results were so
sensual that they remained
burned in our perverted collective consciousness. Need I
mention the whipped-cream
bikini from "Varsity Blues"
(I'm not proud) or the olive in
the bellybutton from "Hot
Shots"? On the other end of
the erotic spectrum, there is
SARAH WALSH
George Costanza's fantasy of
Sex and the Swattie eating a sandwich during sex
and the "Road Trip" dork's
experiences with peanut butter (I'm not judging). I am
using the above examples to illustrate an important point
about this sexual genre
the combination of food and sex
play in and of itself is not necessarily sexy, but if it is used
in imaginative ways, it can definitely be both fun and satisfying.

Traditionally, certain foods, labeled aphrodisiacs, have
been culturally renowned for their alleged ability to boost
sexual desire and performance. Some of these famed
libido-enhancing novelties include oysters (wonder why?),
chocolate (hence the abundance of leftover cocoa products
remaining in stores after last weekend) and even onions.
(If you try this last one, however, make sure you also give
some to your sweetie; otherwise you won't be getting any,
no matter how hot and bothered you are.)
In spite of a lack of scientific evidence that aphrodisiacs
actually deliver, the concept refuses to die, partially
because eating them may trigger a placebo effect. So if
you're convinced that you get hornier after you eat sushi
(or ice cream or apples or whatever), by all means keep
that food in your diet. On the other hand, if, like me, you
are skeptical of the actual power of any so-called aphro-

disiac other than alcohol, don't despair. (Other drugs also
fall into this category, but I won't elaborate.) Skillful integration of food into sex play entails precisely what good

sex does creativity.
In addition to cultivating your sense of adventure, I
would also recommend maintaining your sense of humor,
as things may quickly get messy. Sure, whipped cream or
chocolate sauce are initially extremely exciting when
someone is licking them off of you, but they can soon
become just plain annoying when you are still sticky
despite your honey's best efforts. Also, though almost any
food can be integrated into your sexcapades in some way,
there are certain foods that will quickly dampen your sexual fire. I learned this lesson once in high school when I
forgot that I was chewing gum during a heavy-petting session with my significant other at the time. I know none of
you want me to go into any details (although I'm willing to
bet a few of you do, sickos), so I'll just say that it was lucky
I had scissors around or he would have driven home a very
uncomfortable boy.

play entails precisely what good sex

does

So yes, you need to be careful which foods you choose,
and where you put them. For example, the vagina is dangerous territory for food play, especially when food containing sugar are involved. Even a small amount can
encourage nasty bacteria and yeast growth. This includes
fruit, sweetened whipped cream, soda or sugary drinks
and liqueurs. That said, there is no reason why these
treats cannot be used anywhere else, and they can even
help you explore the parts of your lover's body that you
may tend to forget about in your anticipation.
Other novelty items can be a turn-on due to their ability to change sensitivity in the skin, and these include ice

cubes, Altoids, and lubes that get hot when you blow on
them (although personally I have heard that they are not
nearly as fun as they sound, and can be downright uncomfortable). On a slightly different note, over the years the
thought of using a dildo-shaped fruit or vegetable for vaginal or anal stimulation may have occurred to you. As long
as you use lube and a condom and make sure there are no
sharp or rough edges (watch out for bananas) that can
damage delicate skin, go for it.
Foods don't need to be used in bed in order for you and
your honey to spice things up. Cooking can be a very hot
experience, and cooking for or with your partner can
transform any run-of-the-mill meal into "sex food." Try creating a whole aphrodisiac meal for a loved one, and think
of creative and sensual ways of serving it. (C'mon,
Swatties, you shouldn't need me to explain ways to do
this.) Better yet, cook in erotic ways with a lover.
Unfortunately, for most of us, the lack of privacy of dorm
life makes it impossible to really let loose in the kitchen,
but part of the fun could be in finding ways to be both sexual and subtle. Think of dipping a finger (or anything else
you can think of if you're lucky enough to have your own
apartment) into your culinary creation and then letting
your significant other taste it.
I have to admit, on one level I feel torn about writing
this type of column, in which most of my advice really
applies only to people who are at this point regularly getting their grooves on (and even then only to those open
enough to try any of it). What can I say? The paper's theme
this week is food, and I figured I might as well be a "joiner." So to those of you not in relationships who are reading
this and asking yourselves how this can provide you gratification now, I can't really offer much help. (Hey, kid who
keeps mailing me about getting a hands-on tutorial, that
means you. I'm changing my address.) However, I did
come across a recipe for "Better-Than-Sex" chocolate cake
during my modest Internet research for this column. I
can't guarantee it lives up to its name, but I'd be happy to
provide you with the recipe.

Dining hall blues: new complaints on an old subject
It's not that there's a problem with the food; this time the problem is with the people eating it
BY AARON WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu

Too many people love to rip into
Sharpies. As a topic of conversation, it has
the same status as complaining about how
much work you have; everyone returns to
the issue when they've run out of all other
subjects in order to illustrate their problems with this school. Well, I'm taking a
stand. Considering the amount of people
the staff cooks meals for, I think they do a
remarkable job. I can always find something I'm generally pleased about eating
(and I'm not just writing this hoping that
Linda McDougall might want to put a few

tacos one lettuce leaf at a time, it's enough to make
you want to live on Career Services' free pizza. (Or
you could go to Tarble, but, hey, this is about
Sharpies.) The lines! The waiting! Everything tastes
the same! I know someone who claims that they put
cumin in everything. It's possible.
To be honest, I complain about Sharpies. All the
time. I also recognize
as most people do that the
folks at Sharpies work hard to make our meals enjoyable. It's a difficult and largely thankless task, given
that most students are not in the business of complimenting the cuisine.

However, Sharpies does, unarguably, provide
choices for those of us with discriminating palates.
Options abound
pasta every day, a huge salad bar,
woks, toasters and all the rest. Each of us has a few
special dishes that we know how to make in
Sharpies, for those times when dinner fails to
delight. It's wonderful to walk past the wok area and
smell the tantalizing aromas of someone else's sup-

per. Cooking is relaxing, especially if you give yourself ample time. There's little more pleasurable than
enjoying the fruits (or stir-fries) of your labors.
Exercise some creativity in preparing your meal!
Try out new blends of sauces, add a new condiment
to your sandwich. Sharpies may serve the same
things all the time, but they serve a huge variety of

those things. The proverbial possibilities are endless.
Here are two recipes to help you prepare a perennial favorite: peanut noodles. These recipes are two
of my favorites. Eat these sauces over pasta, rice,
fresh or stir-fried veggies, with chicken or tofu, on a
sandwich ... however you like.

A Tale of
Two Fatties
Three stories of gluttonous proportions
To get in shape for the strenuous
upcoming rugby season, we have

both gone on a diet. This made it
difficult for us to contribute a column worthy of a place in the food
issue. Fortunately, having gone
into withdrawal, we started having
dreams of the feasts of days gone
by. These caloric wet dreams have

defined our very existences.
1) Jon's Dinner for Eight (or
Two). I was born a skinny lad, and
so when my mother looks at me
nowadays and wonders what happened, I am forced to remind her that she had plenty of signs that
my ass would get big. I didn't start developing my "winter coat"
until senior year in high school, but when I was five, I proved that
gluttony could reach new limits. It was my uncle's birthday party,
and I was allowed to hang out with the cool adults for the first time.
However, I could not drink with them, as I was too "young" or
something preposterous like that. The truth is that my mom would
have had to clean up less puke if she had just let me have a couple
of shots of vodka with the big boys. Instead, she decided to let me
explore the house. I found myself in the dining room with at least
five different birthday cakes. I decided to sample each one, and by
sample I mean eat two whole chocolate cakes and half an apple pie.
The chunks were not too hard to pick up off the Persian rug. Happy
birthday, indeed, uncle. I had your cake and ate it, too.

Stir well.

Ginger Peanut Sauce
...

for when you've got time to burn (but don't burn it).

Gather the following ingredients:

Add the following:

1/2

vinegar and sugar
2 teaspoons soy sauce

bowl mung bean sprouts

(the thick ones, not the delicate
curly ones)

1/2 bowl onions

(red in salad bar are milder, white in
deli are stronger)

1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
6 tablespoons peanut butter
(3 large spoonfuls)
1/2 mug of hot water
2 packets of sugar
1 lemon slice

Commandeer a wok. Plug it in and heat

to 375 2F. Squirt in a little olive oil and add

the onions and bean sprouts. (If the onions
are in rings or big chunks, cut them smaller
with a butter knife.) Cook until the onions
are translucent and smell nice and oniony.

Neither of us went home for
Thanksgiving: Texas is far away, and
Canadians are atheists.

(or more to taste)

2 teaspoons sesame oil

(this is the darker oil at the wok area)

1/2 teaspoon curry powder

1 teaspoon ginger

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
dash of cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste
Mix well to form an aromatic paste clinging to the onions and sprouts. Mix the hot
water and peanut butter with a fork (again,
persevere!) and pour into the wok. Stir well.
Taste and adjust seasonings. Squeeze the
lemon slice in, taking care to keep seeds
out Add more water if it's too thick, and let
simmer for a minute or two while you find
something to eat it on.

2) Emiliano and the Rack of Ribs. My mom thinks I am a contractor. One weekend, she thought it would be cool if she made me
build a two-story carport next to the house. So I did with the help
of my friend Daniel. After finishing the two-story carport, my mom
decided that to reward us she would make us a rack of ribs. The
hours leading up to the eating were almost as rewarding as the
feast itself. Within minutes of cooking, the house was filled with
the fantastic aroma of liquid smoke and that secret family ingredient my mom likes to call "crack cocaine," the honey of drugs. I
mean, honey, the crack cocaine of marinades. When dinnertime
finally came, Daniel and I were faced with the daunting task of
having to finish 14 ribs. Unlike the carport, the ribs were real, and
the flab on my ass I still can't get rid of serves as a reminder of the
following eating mishap I regret to this day. The lard on the ribs
tasted so good that, after finishing the torso of a cow, we thought it
would be better for the environment to suck the fat off all the
bones. It was on that day that I learned that fat from foods can actually make its way to the pores on your face, and I have the acne
scars to prove it.
3) Thanksgiving 2002: A Tale ofTwo Fatties. There's not a whole
lot to say about this Thanksgiving. In short, we ate ourselves into
oblivion. Neither of us went home for Thanksgiving: Texas is far
away, and Canadians are atheists. (Un)fortunately, this meant that
our moms weren't around to curb our eating. Words can't describe
the fatness of the day, afternoon and evening. The next morning,
we were still giving thanks for the 13-poundbird we had consumed
and for not having a heart attack. 'Nuf said.
(On a final note, we wanted to apologize to the campus for our
Valentine's Day column. Our joke regarding blindfolding was
made in poor taste. Although we did not intend it to be offensive,
it came across as inappropriate. Even we can get carried away
with our humor, and the joke was not meant to turn something as
serious as sexual misconduct to derision. We regret our actions
and apologize.)

How many conservatives
are mere On CampilS/ How different are their views from those of the
supposedly liberal majority here? Political views and social values that mark someone as a

conservative are complex, and those questions are not easily answered. Among the self-identified
conservaties The Phoenix talked to for these articles, some expressed frustration at how difficult it is
to find tolerance for their views, while others viewed the political climate here as a healthy challenge.

vould hardly expect that
•titution dubbed "The
1I on the Crum" by former

vice president and Republican
party stalwart Spiro Agnew
would have a sizable, or, for that
matter, any, conservative population.
However, relatively conservative Swatties may not be as rare
as one might believe.
"There are more than people
think," said Randy Goldstein 'O5,
president of College Republicans.
"The campus environment is just
such that some people are hesitant to vocalize their beliefs."
There are currently about 20
students
on
the
College
Republicans' e-mail list, but
Goldstein estimates that "at least
double that number" sympathize
with the conservative agenda."
Former College Republicans
president Matt Rubin 'O3 claimed
that "people were constantly
inquiring about our group, most
of whom never showed up to
meetings."
While Rubin certainly does
not believe that Swarthmore conservatives constitute any kind of

"silent majority" on campus, he
does believe there are far more
political moderates on campus
who sympathize with a number
of aspects of the Republican ideology than common knowledge
would suggest.
"There are a lot more moderates on this campus than people
realize," Rubin said. "I learned
that after Sept. 1L I got a lot emails expressing interest in the
College Republicans in the
month that followed. There are
more people who are willing to
support, in the right circumstances, military action against
Iraq, for example, than one
might assume. There's a perception that everyone on this campus is a pacifist, and that's not
true."
Rubin pointed to last semester's Swarthmore Progressive
Action Committee-sponsored referendum on a statement opposing military action against Iraq.
While 60.8 percent of the 660 students who cast a ballot voted in

favor of the resolution, 25.3 percent voted against it and 13.9 percent expressed no preference.
Rubin also sees a lot of sympathy among moderates for the traditionally conservative issues of
free trade and support for Israel.
"I think there are a lot of capitalists on this campus who
believe in free trade, and you
also see a lot of support for a proIsrael foreign policy position,"
he said. "Those are both
Republican issues."
Daren Tedeschi 'O5, a current
member of College Republicans,
echoed Rubin's sentiments.
"On the whole, Swat could be
characterized as liberal, but the
stereotype that Swat is full of
extremely, extremely liberal people is just not accurate,"
Tedeschi said. "In reality, the
majority of people would tend
towards the center. And I'm sure
there are also a lot of closet conservatives."

Adil Nure 'O5 said that the intense academic atmosphere at Swarthmore also challenged him to remember
his priorities. "My mind is distracted by other obligations," he said. "I forget the purpose of my existence,
which is not getting an A or making money. I am a Muslim
before I am a scholar."
Others said their values had actually grown stronger
by coming to college. Rozina Ali 'O6 said that, as one of few
Muslims at Swarthmore, she has come to value her own
beliefs more. "My beliefs have definitely been questioned
in coming to college, but it has helped me appreciate my
values. It makes me want to be more religious," she said.
Devi Ramkissoon 'O6, who describes herself as a relatively conservative Hindu, shared the feeling that coming
to college had strengthened her beliefs. "It's easy to have
strong beliefs when I'm at home and everyone shares
them. Coming to college and seeing the ways others
choose to live their lives helps me see why I hold my values," she said.
Nure also said Swarthmore had strengthened him religiously, not because of the diversity but because of the

THE PHOENIX

networks he has formed. Referring to the
Muslim Student Association, Nure said, "I've formed tight
knit bonds, and we've helped support one another relireligious

giously."

These bonds, he said, formed not through planned
activities but rather through close friendships. Scott
Birney 'O6 agreed, saying he had found a religious community in the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship.
"Practicing Christians are the minority here. It's different
from home," he said, referring to his Texas hometown.
"But, at the same time, the small group of us has become
close, because there aren't as many of us."
As a result of their religious values, some find it difficult to fit into the social mainstream. Sato said she avoided social activities that would expose her to activities not
in accordance with her lifestyle, such as drinking alcohol.
"It's just not a part of my reality, not that I deny it exists
here," she said.
"I probably don't socialize as much as I would if people
here had the same values I do," Ramkissoon said. "Instead,

Campus liberalism leaves many feeling left out
See Conservatives, pg. 14
After she wrote an opinion
piece for The Phoenix in
November, expressing a “wish
that people would stop assuming
that Republicans are unthinking
idiots who have no place at
Swarthmore College,” former
College Republicans treasurer
Sarah Donovan ’04 said that a
number
had
of
students
approached her with similar frustrations.
“When I wrote that piece for
The Phoenix, people would just
come up to me and shake my
hand,” she said. “They just came
out of the woodwork.”
While conservative students

have each had very different experiences at Swarthmore, many
have had a similar reaction to the
overwhelmingly liberal character
of school’s political climate.
“I wouldn’t say I feel threatened due to my conservative
views,” Tedeschi said. “It’s not

daunting to be a conservative at
Swarthmore, but its definitely not
easy.”

Most conservatives say any
frustration stems more from their
experience in classes than from

social situations.

“Socially, it really hasn’t been

a

problem," Remus said. "I don't feel
like I'm being ostracized. I wouldn't say I'm in general uncomfortable here, it can just be frustrating
in class. Politics shouldn't saturate your French lit course or
your chemistry course."
Many students feel that conservative students' ideas are accorded little respect in academic dis-

cussions, primarily by students,
but at times also by professors.
"It's hard for people to believe
that any conservative view could
be arrived at using the power of
logic," Tedeschi said. "The only
time when your views aren't really criticized is when they're covered by religion, which I think is a
sticky subject and is viewed as
more of a personal decision."
Goldstein also feels that his
views are not given appropriate

consideration.
"I think the majority of this
campus just dismisses me as a
wealthy white boy," he said. "Not
many people are willing to seriously discuss my political views."
Other conservative students do
not even attempt to discuss their
political views because they feel
their peers will judge them
harshly.
"I can't stand to discuss
American politics, because it's so

personal here," Donovan said. "If
you have an 'incorrect' political
view, it's as though it reflects
immorality or some innate evilness. Swarthmore's, not really a
tolerant place, it's just liberal.
When a friend of mine found out I
was a Republican, she said, 'But
you're not crazy! You don't belong
to the NRA or anything, right?'
While being in the political
minority has its disadvantages, a
"

number of conservative students
believe it has added to their education.
"Swarthmore is the best education in the country for a conserva-

tive undergraduate," said Rubin.

"It's to the benefit of conservative
students to be in classrooms that
are flooded with liberal and leftist
texts, because it prepares them for
what they're up against."
Many conservatives are quick
to point out that their liberalpeers
don't seem to be exposed to the
same educational challenge.

"I think it's a real

problem edu-

cationally when students aren't
exposed to a diversity of opinions," Remus said.
"I think they're losing out on a
lot. If the only people you're arguing with are people who agree
with you,.how much is that really
preparing you for anything?"

Objectivists: a tiny minority
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

Zoila Forgione 'O3, co-founder of the now defunct
organization
Students
of Objectivism at
Swarthmore, said most people who call themselves
objectivists would be offended to be classified as
conservative in the political sense. The group's
other founder, Greg Goldman 'O3, said one had nothing to do with the other beyond free economic principles.

But on campus, Swarthmore-brand Republican
students are the ones Forgione most identifies with.
She described both objectivists and Swarthmore's
conservatives as fiscally and politically conservative but socially progressive. "Personally, I find
affinity with them," she said. "Unlike many conservatives, Swarthmore students do not, for example,
believe that homosexuality is morally wrong."
Goldman, who is on leave from the college, said he,
too, could imagine feeling "kinship" with conservatives because of the "strong contingent of socialists
and Marxists" at Swarthmore.
Objectivism is a philosophical system based on
the work of 20th-century writer Ayn Rand, whose
most well known novels are "The Fountainhead"
and "Atlas Shrugged." In those stories, the paths of
her characters' lives reveal a "reverence for the
man of the ego," Goldman said. "As illustrated in
'The Fountainhead,' her hero Howard Roarke is a
mover of society, and he moves everyone up with

him."

Forgione said the objectivist philosophy was
based on the principle that "reason is the only
absolute." Rand believed that "the laws of nature
are immutable and that reason is the tool for understanding cause and effect," Forgione later explained
in an e-mail. "Humanity has dignity which derives
from a person's capacity to think and create."
The philosophy is rooted in the principle of ego"not the traditional sense of egotism, in that
ism
it's every man for himself, but egoism, in that every
man should try to achieve his own values, but not at
the expense of anyone else," Goldman said. He said
he thought Rand had envisioned a "benevolent
brotherhood" in which people made no claims over

14

others' lives and recognized nobody else's claims
over their own, including their time, effort and
property.
In the most basic terms, Rand described her philosophy as consisting of four parts: objective reality, reason, self-interest and capitalism, according to
the Web site of the Ayn Rand Institute.

Despite their status as an extremely small
minority on campus, objectivist students have
made an impact through three objectivist speakers,
which the group Students of Objectivism funded

with money from the national Ayn Rand Institute.
Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, one speaker, Dr.
Andrew Bernstein, gave a talk on the need for a
swift retaliatory response in which the United
States would attack Middle Eastern nations, especially Iran. Many students who attended the talk
walked out, offended by Bernstein's notions of Arab
culture, Islam and the moral duties of the United

States.
"Subtle psychological abuse" was a continuous
problem for Goldman as he tried to build Students
of Objectivism at Swarthmore.
"A lot of the students there had heard of it and
had a negative stereotype about it without firsthand
experience," he said. Many Student Budget
Committee members were "openly hostile" to him,
and "there was a lot of snickering going on" when
he applied to them for funds. "It kind of wears you
down," he said.
Goldman said he started Students of Objectivism
because, although he did not consider himself a
member of the objectivist movement, he wanted his
education to include an organized study of objectivism, which he had pursued "as a lifeline for
myself, because I felt pretty starved for reason."
Forgione said she was first "impressed with Ayn
Rand's vision of the heroic man" when she discovered "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged" on
her father's bookshelf.
Before leaving her Catholic high school, whose
religion-based teachings might have pushed her
toward a reason-based philosophy, Forgione convinced her English teacher to make "The
Fountainhead" required reading for the eleventh
grade.

the people I find myself getting close to are the ones who do share
my values."
Other students, however, felt that not drinking alcohol did not
have a large effect on their social life. "I do what I want and what
I can within the acceptable confines of my religion," Nure said.
"I'll go to a party but just make sure not to drink."
"It's not that I am unaccepting or that I alienate myself from
those that do choose to party," Stevenson said. "I just don't hang
around them on the weekends. I haven't really found it to be a
huge problem," she said.
Birney said religious values did not prevent him from enjoying the Swarthmore social scene, but they do have an effect. "I'm
not opposed to drinking, but I don't get drunk. It's hard to have
fun with people who are plastered when you're not drunk," he

said.

He often experienced difficulties sharing his perspective with
others, who "don't understand why I choose not to socialize on
Saturday nights so that I can wake up early to go to church on
Sundays."
While Swarthmore's campus is still very liberal, some of those
feel that they should speak out more. "While students with conservative lifestyles are not the majority, I feel that they are a vital
part of the Swarthmore community," Ali said. "We need a vocal
conservative presence."
But Ramkissoon said that would be easier said than done. "In
such a liberal environment, it's hard to speak out more. I feel like
if I put these things out there, the Swarthmore community would
judge me," she said.
Stevenson also felt that her desire to share her religious
beliefs was not readily accepted.
"The main challenge I face at Swat is a personal challenge concerning how vocal I should be with my values and beliefs," she
said. "How can I share what I believe so deeply with someone in
such a diverse melting pot of religions that Swarthmore repre-

sents?"

Most students interviewed thought it was important to recognize the students' rights to make individual choices.
Ramkisson said she did not want to impose her beliefs on others, and Nure agreed. "I've learned to accept other people and not
criticize," he said. "My religion teaches me to tolerate others and
their differences."

New housing will
hurt diversity
We like multiculturalism. That's why we oppose a
multicultural hall.
Students come to Swarthmore in part because of the
diversity it offers. Take classes and live life with people
from all over the country and the world, and you learn
about ethics of Christianity, economics in China, politics
in the gay community, language policy in Southern
California, public education in Baltimore. You meet people different from you, get to know them, expand your
knowledge and pass it on. It's what diversity is all about.
Some students make a hobby of multiculturalism.

They actively promote learning among people of various
backgrounds to the benefit of those around them. They
organize educational events. They work to make multiculturalism thrive. They are what diversity is all about.
Encouraging those students to band togetheron a single hall is not. Such a system has the. potential to drain
the rest of the campus of multicultural leaders, as Dean of
Residential Life Myrt Westphal commented last week.
The "multicultural educational" hall in Mertz will be
open to students of all ethnicities and sexual orientations,
which makes sense. We don't doubt that the hall will be
enriching to all its residents, whether they're already
active in advancing a particular culture, whether they're
minority or majority. It is the rest of Swarthmore we're

concerned about.
Sure, the deans have required that the hall conduct
all-campus multicultural events, but those will only happen once a year. If the college

really
wanted to promote diversity, they would take the organized cultural discussions that will take place on their hall
and promote them all over campus. That's what multicultural education is all about: expanding ideas across

perceived boundaries.
We know it is not a piece ofcake to put together a wellattended discussion about diversity for whomever may
want to attend. Students are already strapped for time
and involved in their own activities. The campus group
Dialogues attempted to organize public discussions on
diversity two years ago and has since stopped functioning. But one purpose of the multicultural hall may be to
train its residents to work with diverse populations,
according to Dean Westphal. That provision is somewhat
vague, but assuming that it includes learning how to promote multiculturalism, shouldn't the people learning
those skills be using them with the rest of the campus?
Plenty of cultural understanding and education
already takes place in the residence halls. A multicultural hall will enhance this experience for a small group of
students while detracting from it for everyone else.

Substance-free housing a student idea
Dear Editor:

I appreciate somewhat the point of
view adopted by the staff of The
Phoenix in their editorial about
Substance-Free Housing (SFH) ("No
need for substance-free housing," Feb.
20, pg. 14). It is possible that a stigma of
some sort could develop in the eyes of
people not in touch with Swarthmore's
culture for people not living in SFH,
though I do not think many such people would make the leap from "does not
live in SFH" to "crack addict."
However, the rest of the objection put
forward by the staff is wrongheaded,
which they would know if they had
attended Housing Committee.
As
a member of Housing
Committee, I can tell you that it was
expressly the concern of the Housing

Committee and the deans that the

RA(s) of SFH not become "DEA

enforcers 24/7." Such a role, we all felt,
was extremely inappropriate for an
RA, and we discussed many ways of
implementing SFH to avoid such a situation. The proposal adopted by the
Housing Committee and the deans is
that the role of the RA in SFH will differ minimally from the role of an RA
in a smoke-free hall, with the
"enforcement" of substance-free rules
resting on the substance-free commu-

nity more generally.
Further, I am amazed to see the
misperceptions on campus about the
origins of SFH. The idea was first proposed by students, not the administration. Housing Committee conducted a
survey of the classes of 2004, 2005 and
2006, many of whom indicated that
they would, indeed, like to see SFH on
campus. SFH is not the administration's "simplistic institutional solu-

tion" or "face-saving measure," but
rather an option that members of the
student body want.
To get some issues straight: SFH
will be offered in Woolman next year.
(See story, pg. 4.) Students will have to
apply for SFH in a manner very similar to applying for a block. To apply
for SFH is to agree to abide by the
rules that the SFH community will
decide upon next fall. If there are not
enough applications for SFH to fill the
space with people who want to be
there, there will be no SFH. That
means no one will be forced to live
there SFH will only exist if the student body demonstrates a desire for it.
Even if you or I would not choose
to live in SFH, we are not in a position
to say that there is "no need" for the
people who would.

Color-coded

Everyone knows that there is nothing that duct tape can't
fix. From a dangling windshield wiper to a leaky roof, we
would be lost without the duck. So, when the head of the
Department of Homeland Security tells you that good ol'
trusty and reels of plastic sheets are what may save you from
the next terrorist attack, you haul ass to the hardware store
and see if they now carry it m
colors that match your wood
paneling.
Recently, the color-coded
terrorist alert index was lifted
from yellow (elevated) to
orange (high). Watching CNN
or MSNBC, you will note that

9/11, issuing do-it-yourself
home disaster planning instructions. These include "a threeday supply of food and water, a battery-powered radio and
extra cash" and instructions to "seal up a room with duct tape
and plastic sheets against chemical or biological attacks."
Tom, are you serious? I know you're just doing your job, but

the floor? And does this mean that in case of a terrorist attack
we follow Swarthmore's emergency plan and go to Sharpies,
or do we quickly pick our least annoying friend and ducktrap
him or her inside of the quarantined room?
All jokes aside, it is obviously important for the government to alert the public when they have intercepted intelligence indicative of terrorist behavior. The orange warning
was triggered in part by al-Qaeda mutterings intercepted by
American surveillance that spoke of unidentified "packages"
recently delivered to the United States, a new audiotape
release starring bin Laden and a call for Iraqis to carry out
suicide attacks against Americans. Thus opinion polls show
that the number of people living in fear of a terrorist attack is
now at its highest level since October 2001 So I agree that it is
important to take safety precautions. But I have to question
the effectiveness of the color-coding warnings. What good is it
to know that instead ofelevated worry I should be at high anxiety? What are we possibly going to be able to do when the
code goes from orange to red? Start digging a small cave under

Instead of being so scared of another terrorist attack
(which either will or will not occur regardless of our fear factor), we should be refusing to be paralyzed by terrorism. I can
just imagine Osama right now, filo-faxing his terrorist contacts in some far-off cave, his high tech equipment strategically feeding American intelligence lines like "UPS packages," "whippets" and "happy meals." If we continue to buy
into these fear tactics, soon little brown packages and our
favorite fast food cravings will be outlawed. Our lives will be
dictated by fear and paranoia, and the terrorist mission of
psychological trauma will be realized.

Protesters waste freedom of speech
Two Saturdays ago, approximately 75 Swarthmore
students flocked to New York City to waste their time.
They joined hundreds of thousands of like-minded individuals to criticize the United States' pending liberation
of Iraq, condemn the Bush administration and revel in
an atmosphere of general anti-Americanism. In the end,

they accomplished nothing.
The freedom to speak
and assemble peacefully is
a key tenet of democracy.

This freedom, when exercised effectively, is intended to ingrain the will of the

people in the decisions of

the government. Not only
was the New York protest
ineffective, it was contrary
to the spirit of democracy.
Rather than an attempt to

change, it was an attempt at

impressive,
Frivolous protest does not lead to consensus. At the
center of the New York madness lay a stage with a large
banner proclaiming, "The World Says No To War." While
an incredible number of protesters did gather in New
York and around the world, it is flawed logic to say that
this represents any sort of majority opinion on the issue.
By definition, the act of protest is an outcry against the
status quo. Those who support the status quo have no
real incentive to mobilize. Thus, when a protesting
crowd is unanimously against an issue, it is really representative of nothing. Their gathering to protest does
February 27, 2003

not imply that their opinions are of any greater validity
than the silent majority's.
If simply gathering to protest a single issue were not
sufficiently futile, the sad truth is that these protests consistently erupt into a cacophony of largely unrelated
issues. Among the antiwar signs in New York, one could
find others that were anti-capitalist, anti-globalization
and anti-Israel. This is more reflective of a self-righteous
leftist love-fest than a serious movement for change.
Rather than gather for the cause at hand, protesters gather for the sake of gathering. For the individual protester,
the event is more social than political.
With such a large gathering, it would be foolish to
claim that all participants are peaceful and well behaved.
Yet these events are consistently followed by complaints
of police brutality and the non-cooperation of local government. In the midst of such a chaotic event as occurred
in New York, protesters should be relieved that only 312
individuals were arrested. While peaceful dissent is permissible, the interference of non-dissenters going about
their daily lives is not. Reports have emerged from New
York of police officers being disobeyed, traffic being purposely obstructed and police horses being assaulted. So
much for the left's commitment to animal rights.
Activism is admirable and necessary to effect real
change. When executed properly, it has the power to persuade individuals, abolish injustices and correct past
mistakes. The vast majority of all modern protests, New
York included, do not effectively achieve these goals. The
end result is that, aside from the protesters' getting high
on warm, fuzzy feelings (among other things), nothing is
accomplished. The causes of the left would be better
served by thoughtful and effective action. Productive
activism is far more admirable than a self-serving frolic
in Manhattan. It is a shame to see so many individuals
squander the privileges of democracy.

Crisis pregnancy centers offer
options for women needing aid
Dear Editor:
I was struck by how drastically
the characterization of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) by Josh
Kramer 'OO ('"Crisis pregnancy
centers' mislead," Feb. 6, pg. 14)
contrasts with my personal experiences working with them.
Kramer, who called these
organizations "nothing but a propaganda tool of the anti-choice
movement to scare mothers into
giving up their right to choose,"
should take another look at what
they are offering and how. I doubt
that he has ever actually been
inside a CPC or attempted a lowbias review of their services. His
reference to the despicable practices of some CPCs masks the fact
that many others, without coercion, legitimately provide muchneeded pregnancy and post-delivery services to low-income women
who otherwise would have virtually no choice at all.
To
bolster his argument,
Kramer referred readers to the

Web site of the National Abortion

Rights Action League (NARAL).
Conspicuous by omission in
NARAL's literature is any mention of CPCs like the one I interned
at last spring to fulfill a requirement of the women's studies capstone seminar. It wasn't perfect
(what underfunded and understaffed organization is?), but it is
serving a need among Philadelphia women that is not being
served elsewhere.
I almost laughed out loud at
Kramer's assertion that Planned

Parenthood "offers all legitimate
choices to women." Planned
Parenthood does some things weU.
But how can an organization that
does not provide or refer for
affordable housing, employment
services and other pre- and postdelivery support be said to be

offering all choices?
Let's be clear about this: There
are plenty of women who don't
want to end unexpected pregnancies. If they don't have the finan-

cial or social resources to carry a
pregnancy to term, where can they
turn? The good crisis pregnancy
centers
and Kramer's letter
slanders CPCs indiscriminately
fill this void. It is too often precisely the lack of these resources that
pushes women toward abortion.
If you're interested, by all
means check out what NARAL has
to say. But don't forget to look at
some CPC Web sites, too
they
are no more biased than NARAL
is, of course
and talk to anyone
you know who might have some
experience with CPCs. If you get a
chance, visit one. Get as broad a
picture as you can from as many
sources as possible. Evaluate the
worth of individual crisis pregnancy centers for yourselves, because
Kramer's inflammatory rhetoric
doesn't
serve
women well.

Kramer is so poorly
informed on this topic that it was

Frankly,

Duct tape will save you
from more than terrorism
I want to be Tom Ridge. I want to live in a world
where duct tape and plastic are the simple solution,
the cure-all for everything from nuclear warfare to
nervous neighbors. With a wave of my enlightened
hand, I want to dismiss the fact that duct tape and
plastic over windows doesn't prevent bio-terror crap
from sneaking under my door or slipping insidiously
through the cracks in my foundation. With a shrug of
my wise shoulders, I want to ignore how much it
would wreak psychological havoc on American citizens if they actually bought into my suggestions, sealing themselves into their
homes, dreaming of looming toxic plumes, stocking their basements with
enough water and nonperishables to

every time they're asked

sanctuaries.
Most of all, I want to take
home a hefty paycheck
for coming up with
genius security measures. In light of recent
tragic events, I have
devised my own prescriptive Homeland Security

recommendations:
1. When patronizing
local nightclubs, it is best to be properly prepared with
a good 10 yards of plastic sheeting and a durable roll of
high-grade duct tape. In the event of incineration,
wrapping the plastic sheeting about your head and
body and securing with a few thick strips of duct tape
will minimize smoke inhalation and potentially prevent serious burns that could produce unseemly scarring. This security measure is especially important if
you happen to have a taste for clubs that feature
revival 'Bos hair bands with no formal training in
pyrotechnics. In the event of stampede, several layers
of plastic sheeting, again secured with thick strips of
THE PHOENIX

duct tape, could be used to fashion a crude force-field,
preventing the undesirable death by trampling.
2. When boarding NASA space shuttles and
embarking on risky final-frontier endeavors, be sure
your space craft is adequately equipped with at least
25 yards of plastic sheeting and two jumbo-sized rolls
of duct tape per crew member. In the event that the
craft should spontaneously combust as it reenters the
Earth's atmosphere, the plastic sheeting and duct tape
can be easily manipulated to serve as a sort of parachute, which will help land you safely on ground and
prevent a nasty midair demise. Alternatively, the duct
tape could prove particularly useful in mending parts
gone bad aboard the space craft, preventing explosive
setbacks from the start.
3. When undergoing major organ transplants,
avoid unnecessarily unsafe complications by preemptively adhering a large patch of plastic sheeting to the
skin directly above the target organ. Duct tape can be
used not only to affix the plastic sheeting to your body,
but also, when properly torn into smaller strips, to
spell out the words "Check my blood type, dumbass!"
4. When riding South Korean subways, always be
prepared with enough plastic sheeting and duct tape
to MacGyver your way into a Tarzan-like lasso that
would support the weight of you and your fellow passengers should you need to swing to platform safety
because some lunatic has decided to ignite a milk carton of gasoline.
So you see, ladies and gentlemen, virtually none of
the most recent tragedies our nation has seen were
entirely unpreventable. There's no dilemma so deadly
that a little preventive foresight and a handbag staple
of duct tape and plastic employed appropriately
couldn't quickly cure. And Tom Ridge thought his

anti-asphyxiation-on-toxic-plumage measure
was impressive. Seriously, people, I've formulated
methods for the successful prevention of four (not one)
omnipresent threats to the American public. Ridge,
your job is mine.

and al-Qaeda. Domestically speaking, the majority of French and
German citizens oppose the war (as do most British and Turkish
citizens). Yet Bush keeps pushing unwilling and unconvinced
allies toward a war they don't want to fight, for reasons that are
either dishonest or disingenuous. There was an outpouring of
goodwill after Sept. 11, and, in the War on Terror, these same allies
have stood shoulder to shoulder withthe United States in hunting
down al-Qaeda and other international terrorists. To these allies
and their citizenry, Iraq simply seems like the wrong war in the
wrong place at the wrong time, to borrow a phrase from former
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Omar Bradley.
Allies remain unconvinced. The threat of Saddam Hussein,
contrary to the rhetoric of the pro-war crowd, is not only marginalized, but also contained. When we look at the suffering of
the Iraqi people, we support every possible method of aid to
them, short of a destabilizing and unjustified war. What, then, do
we get? The very backbone of the pro-war crowd, the
McCarthyesque accusation of anti-Americanism at every turn.
Antiwar protesters are, in the words of preeminent conservative weblogger Glenn Reynolds, "objectively supporting" Saddam
Hussein, using the words of George Orwell (with regards to communism) that even Orwell admitted were both wrong and overstated. Many a conservative pundit, bloated on an inevitable war,
has affectionately picked up the rhetoric of Vladimir Lenin, referring to antiwar protestors as "useful idiots." What's amazing is
voicing opposition to
that the truth actually needs to be stated
this war is in no way anti-American. The millions who marched
across the world were not motivated by anti-Americanism
(besides a few fringe elements, of course) but instead by opposition to a war they see as unjustified and unprecedented.
The sadness of this all is that those who are dominant in the
pro-war sphere are comfortably delving into this idiocy. It's a
scorched-earth strategy to take down a second-rate despot at the
cost of international standing and established diplomatic principles. It's an awe-inspiring fit of pique, this push for war, predicated on little more than inane demonization, terrifically poor
logic and fewer facts than an average Wall Street Journal editorial page. And it is how Bush is defining America.

Huey Freeman
was a no-show
BY ARTHUR CHU

letters

to

To be honest, I wanted to hear something about comics.
When a nationally syndicated cartoonist comes to your school, there
are certain things that it is cool to know. The way characters popped
up, the inspirations for certain stories or dialogue, the funny stories
that occur as a result of hobnobbing with the famous and fortunate victims of one's razor-sharp wit
you know, the kind of thing that you
think about when you think, "Hey, a famous cartoonist is coming to
...

Swat!"
But that changes when the famous cartoonist is Aaron McGruder
the "Boondocks" guy, for those of you who were trapped in McCabe last
Saturday.

I suppose this is natural. I would expect the same if Garry Trudeau
came here, I guess, or Wiley Miller, or Ted Rail (especially Ted Rail).
Comic strips in this day and age are more and more tied up with op-art
cartooning, and there's nothing wrong with that. And I can't deny that
it was fun hearing one of the greatest equal opportunity offenders of
our generation letting loose on a huge audience, especially since, even
at his most unabashedly radical and quasi-anti-Semitic, he was able to

keep it self-deprecating and light in tone.
But he wasn't saying anything much that I can't hear from any other
radical African-American activist at any time on campus. He was really funny, yes, but I found myself thinking at various moments that,
despite the fact that "The Boondocks" was a hyper-left-wing political
comic strip, what made it more appealing than "Non Sequitur" or "The
Real World" was the characters, the creativity of the jokes, the fact that
even the hyper-left-wing character who speaks for many of the cartoonist's opinions, Huey Freeman, is often shown to have his ridiculous

side and his human failures.
In other words, "The Boondocks" is a comic strip that has more than
a point. It has characters, it has plot, it has jokes; it's fun.
I got some of that from the lecture, of course; McGruder can't help
being funny. But I didn't get the feeling I was listening to a great cartoonist who'd created Huey, Riley and Grandpa Freeman. I got the feeling I was listening to, well, a radical speaker. A good speaker, a funny
speaker, but I didn't get the feeling I'd gotten my full money's worth for

whatever my share was of the ten thousand it cost to get Aaron
McGruder instead of some less well-known radical African-American
speaker with a quick wit.

Classism and racism both exist

funny. He raised important points about politics in

America, and yet I left disappointed by some of his
final words.
America, for McGruder, is black and white.
We're beginning an unwanted war, according to
McGruder, because (White) America was more
concerned with constitutionality than with the
disenfranchisement of thousands of (Black)
Floridians during Election 2000. Beyond issues
blatantly connected to race, McGruder seems to
understand much of American life through the
paradigm of white versus black. We saw this in
McGruder's comment that, when he sees a white
person doing poorly, he asks himself how and why.
The implication was that, no matter how low a
white person falls, they will never endure the
degradation of racism. Challenged by audience
members asking about poor whites, McGruder
scoffed racism, in his eyes, always trumps classism.
These comments generated a tension so palpable that even McGruder backtracked, claiming he
was joking. Joke or not, the comments were unnecessary and contradictory to McGruder's stated
goal of "trying to help people out." Class-based
oppression results in no less hurt, powerlessness
and exploitation than racial oppression. While the

experiences of racism and classism are qualitatively different, it does no good to argue which one
is worse. People who believe that classism exists
yet ignore the effects of racism are mistaken just
like McGruder. A poor person of color will face

both racism and classism while a poor white per-

son encounters only the latter.

Activism,
Swattie-style
"Boondocks"-style, should not forsake itself by

touting ignorant simplicities. Have we not moved
past that in 2003? We need to be able to examine
the complexities of both race and class in
America and not just throw up our hands at difficult topics like "white Puerto Ricans." Life cannot be reduced to binaries, no matter how seduc-

tive they are.

Lighten up, you may say. It's comedy. OK, but if
I take it as just a joke, I discount the many valid
points he raised. He is a political satirist, not a
comedian. His message is potent and intelligent
and needs to be heard. Americans should re-examine the election controversy as much as they
should turn their political efforts to defeating a
right-wing funded attack on affirmative action.
Then, the next time Aaron comes to campus, a
diverse group of Swatties can laugh together during his talk and party together in Wharton basement afterward.

It is sad that a man of Aaron McGruder's talent
can't get his head straight when it comes to Jewish

Americans.

When asked at his lecture Saturday about the

is implying that the Jews run Hollywood and that

conduct.
To suggest that the word "sketchy" should be reclaimed,
celebrated and embraced is not only to deny the prevalence
of sexual assault on Swarthmore's campus, but also to

imply that allegations of misconduct are unfounded and
that perpetrators are justified in their actions. Harding may
have written his column in jest, but its implications are
anything but lighthearted.

Rachel Burstein 'O4
Coordinator of Swat Survivors

Whites split on flag
Dear Editor:
In his column last week, "Red, Black and Green," Taru
Taylor should have mentioned that many white South
Carolinians are fighting tirelessly to stop the state government from flying the Confederate flag on state property. I'm
sure that when he referred to "the whites," he felt it went
without saying that he meant "the whites who support flying the Confederate flag on state property." But it doesn't go
without saying, because some people still do not understand
that white Southerners disagree with each other about
issues related to race.

Libertarians mix social liberalism with conservative economics
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu

Benjamin George 'O3 and Elliot Reed 'O3 describe themselves as "more or less" libertarian. As libertarians, they are
one of the political minorities on Swarthmore's campus, frequently overshadowed by the college's Democratic majority.
"When I go out into the real world, I feel awfully liberal,"
Elliot said, but "on this campus, I feel pretty damn conser-

vative."
George guessed that there might be "three to 25 libertarians" on campus.
Swarthmore's liberal bent has pulled Reed toward the
left. "I was really hardcore libertarian when I showed up to
Swat," he said, "but I've been infected by a lot of Swat liberalism. I think I was wrong in the past."
Still, George and Reed see some fundamental differences
between their libertarian politics and those of the rest of the
campus. In Reed's opinion, "a lot of the Swat idea of government is that its function is to engender widespread social
change in a way that seems to be just."

University

"I'm still inclined to doubt that and to believe that governments are dangerous things," Reed said. He sees the government's role as "to protect individual rights and to pursue
justice on a case-by-case basis."
From his libertarian viewpoint, George said, "the purpose of having a legal code is to provide standards to what
complaints people can raise against each other."

When asked about social institutions such as Medicare
and welfare, Reed said that "this is where the Swat liberalism infection comes in. When I came here, I'd have said definitely fro' to all those. I still feel there's something philosophically repugnant, but I grudgingly accept them."
"I haven't," offered George, who also said he believed that
"taxation is at best a necessary evil."
While they've had ample opportunity to be influenced by
liberalism, both feel that the campus is not receptive to alternative political views. "People feel afraid to publicize their
opinions, and I don't think that's a healthy environment,"
George said.
Reed reacts to "whiny articles or op-ed pieces about how
conservatives are being oppressed" with a firm "I want to

agree!"
Reed compared the constant assumption in daily conversation that everyone here is liberal with the heterosexist
presumption that everyone is attracted to the opposite sex.
He says he finds them equally offensive. "I'd like to sit down
with my friends without everyone assuming I think George
Bush is an idiot, though I'm not a big fan," Reed explained.
Due to the small numbers and lack of fanaticism, Reed is
"not particularly interested in having a political group,"
though George said he'd "show up for meetings."
As a first-year, Reed said, he "tried to join the
Republicans because they said they'd take anyone, but they
were pretty much a drinking club."
For the time being, Reed and George attend the Third
Wing, which is an open discussion group that meets
Wednesdays at 5:30 upstairs in Sharpies. Third Wing is for

people of alternative political positions, including libertarians, neo-conservatives and anarchists, but 'Anyone is welcome to come," George said.
Third Wing's members largely overlap with SWIL simply
because its founder Amy Smith 'OO was a SWIL member.

The deans requested that the

A survey that Jim Maiolo 'O3,

their proposal for substance-free
housing revealed that 32 percent

of the campus would approve of
substance-free lifestyle hall.
Nearly twice that number voted
in favor of a substance-free dorm

230 students answered the survey.
The college attempted substance-free housing for "at least
three years, probably in the

unsuccessful.

Robinson repeats as CC Player of the Year
BY KATE NELSON-LEE

knelson2@swarthmore.edu
When head coach Adrienne Shibles
rushed into Tarble Pavilion and jumped on
guard Katie Robinson 'O4 in practice early
this week, the modest co-captain wasn't
entirely clear what was going on. It was only
after Shibles broke the news that Robinson
had become the first player in conference

history to earn back-to-back Centennial
Conference Player of the Year accolades that
the guard fully understoodher impact on the

conference this season.
"It was a shock," Robinson said of the
award. "It's a great honor because there are
so many great players in the league. I definitely wasn't expecting it for the second year
in a row."

The first of many post-season accolades,
the Player of the Year is determined through
the balloting of the CC's 11 head coaches.
Along with the POY nod, Robinson was
named both First-Team All-Centennial as
well as to the Winter Academic Honor Roll.
Robinson leads the conference in scoring
for the second consecutive year, averaging
18.2 ppg. The guard also leads in steals (4.4
pg), free throw percentage (87.5), and is seventh in field goal percentage (47.0). After
breaking the century-mark earlier this season, Robinson is currently fourth in
Swarthmore's career scoring list with 1,225
points.
Most of Robinson's points have come in
the latter half of the season, as she has averaged 22.9 ppg in the month of February. In
the last seven games, Robinson only had one
game where she has scored under 20 points.
After struggling in the early part of the season, Robinson points to a mid-season groin
injury as the turning point in her season.

"Coming into the season I put a lot of
pressure on myself and I had trouble living
up to my own expectations," she said. "But it
all changed for me when I hurt my groin
because it was really tough to sit on the sidelines and that gave me a different perspective. I realized that I was just so lucky to be
out there, that being out on the court and
playing is just a great feeling, and I didn't
want to let things get in the way. So then I
relaxed and just started to play; that's when
I was able to set up it up in the big games."
It was fitting for Shibles to be the messenger of good news this season, as
Robinson sees the coach's influence in her
play. "Ever since I came here to Swat, the
coaches always believed in me. They found
something in me that I never thought I had."
Robinson also credited her teammates
for providing a basketball atmosphere, in
particular co-captain Alison Furman 'O3. "I
love the team, they're the greatest group of
women. Ali Furman especially has
increased my confidence and helped me
along the way."
In keeping with the program's focus on
specific games, Robinson has spent her last
few practices getting ready for last night's
CC semifinal game at Johns Hopkins. "We're
all so excited; it's just a great feeling to be
playing in the playoffs," she said. "We can
definitely beat them, and it would be so
sweet to beat them in our own gym. I know
in the past that Hopkins used to blow Swat
out, so there's always a little bit of "we'll get
them back for all those years" sentiment."
The Garnet took a three-game winning
streak down to Baltimore last night, including a 51-46 win over CC East Champion
Muhlenberg and Saturday's 73-53 trouncing
of Haverford. After a tough first half against
the hosting Fords, the Garnet were unchar-

acteristically down 39-37. Robinson

teamed
with fellow junior Jerusha Rodgers and
rookie Zoey Adams-Deutsch 'O6 to post a 3614 Garnet second half. "Jerusha had a great
game," Robinson said. "She was owning the
boards and had lots of great rebounds and
big baskets. She's worked so hard all season
and it's nice to have her step up for us."

Runners tune up for CC championships
BY JIM DALTON
jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
The
much-anticipated
Centennial Conference
Championships are now less than a week away as the
Garnet indoor teams are gearing up for the climactic
track meet of the indoor season. Last Friday's Haverford
Keogh Invitational, however, should not be overlooked,
for it served as a solid tune-up meet for the Conference
Championships, which will be held at Ursinus College
this upcoming weekend, March Ist and 2nd.
For the women's side, harrier Elizabeth Gardner 'O5
finished second in the 1500-meter run, setting a new personal record with a blistering time of 4:49.8.
"I can't wait to run this weekend; it's going to be a
great meet," Gardner said. "There is a good chance that
we will break some school records and win a few gold
medals, so it should be exciting. My personal goal is to
drop a few seconds off of my 800 and run well in the distance medley with Claire [Hoverman 'o3], Sarah [Hobbs
'o6], and Njideka [Akunyili 'o4]."
Gardner, whom distance medley teammate Hobbs
regards as a "track goddess," has led the women's team
with a very solid showing this season.
"Being part of such a dedicated and hardworking
team has really paid off," Gardner explained. "Everyone
is encouraging and it really helps to have support from
teammates and coaches. Overall, the team looked pretty
strong at Haverford and it was a good preparatory meet

for conferences."

Hobbs and Akunyili have consistently improved over
the course of the season and have been key contributors
for the women's side. This past Friday, Akunyili finished
second in the 400-meter run with a speedy time of 1:01.3,
while Hobbs placed fourth in the 800-meter run with a
hasty 2:30.0 time.

After being sidelined with an injury at the start of the
season, Claire Hoverman 'O3 is back in stride, finishing
ninth in the 1500-meter event with a time of 5:09.3. She

too is confident that the Garnet women will have a
strong showing at this weekend's Centennial Conference
Championships:

"We have a number of strong women that can defi-

nitely throw the competition for a loop. We are running
the distance medley relay, and due to our training the
past few weeks and racing different distances, all four of
the relay legs should be ready for just about anything."
"The Haverford meet was a nice warmup before the
conference championship this weekend," Hoverman
explained. "The meet was not too big so it was a nice
opportunity to practice various distances in a live race
environment. I can't say how we are going to do this
weekend because I don't want to jinx anyone, but I think
there are a number of opportunities to upset some of the
larger female teams in the Centennial Conference."
Jessica Zagory 'O5 ran three events for the Garnet
women this past Friday at Haverford, finishing 15th in
the 200 meter-run at 31.1 seconds, sixth in the 55-meter
hurdles at 9.8 seconds and seventh in the long jump at
4.10 meters.
For the men's side, sprinter Matt Williams 'O4 and
shot put thrower Robert Melick 'O3 paced the Garnet men
this past Friday at Haverford. Williams finished second
in the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 7.9 seconds, missing the school indoor record by only 0.1 s. Melick, who
threw the shot put 13.0 meters, also finished in second
place.

In the 1500-meter run, Garrett Ash 'O5 led the Garnet
with a sixth-place finish at 4:10.7, while Adam Hunt 'O6
was close behind in 11th place with a time of 4:17.4. Hunt,
who was sidelined for much of the beginning of the season due to illness, has emerged as a solid runner for the
men's indoor team.
"I feel strong going into the conference meet," Hunt
said, "I don't really know what events I'm going to run,
but running a PR would be great."
"I didn't start training until the last week in January
due to illness and this was only the second race of the

February 27, 2003

The team was confident heading into last
night's game against the Blue Jays despite
their 69-56 regular season loss to Hopkins.
"As Adrienne put it, we're just two wins
away from winning the conference,"
Robinson quipped. "We just want to have fun
and let things happen out there on the court,
and hopefully our season will continue."

Garnet fall to Hopkins
In CC playoff action last night, the Garnet Tide
lost to the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays 69-55. In front of
a hostile crowd, the Garnet overcame an early 13-3
deficit to tie the game at 26 apiece at halftime. It was
a defensive first half, as Robinson scored only two

points in the first half. She finished the game with 12
points on 6-14 shooting. Furman opened the second
half with a three-pointer to give Swat one of its few
leads in the game.
The Tide had no answer for 6'2" center Kathy
Darling, a two-time All-Conference player. She finished with a game-high 19 points, scoring most of
her points deep in the low post.
Swarthmore managed to narrow Johns Hopkins
lead to 54-59, but the Blue Jays hit their free throws
and scored baskets to seal the win.
Four players scored in double digits for the
Garnet Tide, including Furman with a team-high 14
points. Wolff and Adams-Deutsch finished with 11
points apiece, and Adams-Deutsch was a perfect 5-5
from the field.

season (for me). I went into the race feeling that I had to
prove that I wasn't all that out of shape and I was happy
with the outcome. Although I didn't have any prior success to back it up, I was confident and it helped. I'm glad
that I got to race the 1500 before conferences because it
lets me know how I can expect to run next."

Following this weekend's Centennial Conference
Championships, the Garnet track teams are looking forward to a promising outdoor season. Matt Williams commented, "I'm also anxious to end the indoor season and
head outside where we won't run into each other as
often," Unfortunately, this will come at a price, as the
teams will be forced to practice at Widener University
due to prolonged construction delays on the new Clothier
Field outdoor track.

While Swat was not to have the
championship, individual and
relay performances were impressive. Mike Dudley 'O3 put on an
amazing show for spectators as
well as his opponents as he broke
the school record in the 200-yard

Centennial Conference record in
the 100-yard breaststroke with a

those wins, Dudley capped his performance with a win in the 200yard IM

While Dudley worked to earn
points, his teammates continued to
do their share of the winning. In

Last Friday I put on my sneakers and crossed to the other side
of the tracks to visit "the cage." My adventure brought me far
away from the library and down to the mail truck's last stop at
the field house. I'd never let more than a finger or a casual hello
slip through the metal wires, but this time I spent nearly an hour
inside with the duo of Dave and Ray.
If you've ever bounced a ball or done something even remotely athletic at Swarthmore in the past couple of decades,
Equipment Managers Dave Lester and Ray Scott helped to make
it happen, and they might have done your laundry, too.
Dave and Ray have managed equipment for 30 and 10 years
respectively. Dave got his start at Swarthmore on Jan. 17, 1959,
working in Dining Services and Maintenance before joining athletics in 1974. After 44 years at Swarthmore, Dave now greets the
children of Swarthmore athletes he used to know, though, as Ray
points out, Dave "looks the same, just a little more gray." Ray
came to Swarthmore in 1993 after managing equipment for the
76ers, the Flyers and his alma mater Widener as well as spending
a couple of years in the electronics business.

February 27, 2003

When they're not busy, both like spending time with their
families and, of course, sports. Besides Swarthmore sports, Dave
is also fan of NASCAR racing. Ray uses his summers to visit family in Las Vegas.

Dave and Ray take care of equipment needs for varsity, club
and casual use, but their main job is organizing everything, to
"try to keep the students smiling down here." As for how much
laundry they do, Dave says, "I couldn't even begin to tell you."
While most equipment rooms are out of sight, the Swarthmore
field house brings students, coaches, visitors and nosy reporters
to the cage. With so much exposure, students become more than
just anonymous stacks of equipment in cubbyholes.

Dave was especially involved with the football team for 27

years, fixing cleats and helmets at games and organizing for the
fall season in May. When Swarthmore eliminated the team, he
said, "they cut out a part of my heart."
Though Saturdays don't feel quite the same, and Dave won't
be able to watch games fr«m his spot behind the flagpole after he
retires, Swarthmore athletics continue to develop. Ray expects
the new fields to look great, though Dave jokes that the school
might install a rock-climbing wall. Ray approves of the recent
shift to more full-time coaches, which has allowed staff members
to settle in and build better relationships with teams and fellow
employees. The new Mullan Fitness Center has diverted some of
the student fitness traffic away from the field house.
During his tenure, Dave also witnessed the transformation of
women's sports with the implementation of Title IX. One day, the
teams brought all the equipment down from an old gym, and the
facilities and equipment managers had to accommodate it quickly. "It was more work, but enjoyable, and both men and women
could work together," Dave said of the transition. Though the
schedule for facilities renovations changed because of the influx
of equipment and teams, the co-educational system is running

well.
While equipment and laundry needs fill the time, the students
keep Dave and Ray excited about their work. The managers especially admire the dedication of scholar athletes. Recognizing the
academic rigors of Swarthmore, Dave is continually "amazed
when kids find the time to do well in school, train and be nice."
Ray says of the students, "That's why we're here. The kids are the
main thing. That's why we're still here." In addition to their own

children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nephews and
nieces, Dave and Ray have enjoyed the company of generations of
young Swatties from all over the country and the world. "You get
a different kind of education down here," Dave said.
Though some students are more social than others, Ray said
that "you'd have to dig to find bad ones." For Dave, "the best part
is getting to know them, and the worst part is not getting to know
them well enough." Whether a student waves hello, two seasons
overlap, a coach searches for a baseball cap, or a reporter needs
a basketball to perfect her baseline jumper, Dave and Ray are
ready. So the next time you take a break from Swat to head down
to the other side of the tracks, stop by the cage and say hello to
Dave and Ray. Tell them I sent you.

WS: Where to begin? Stick with the basics. This whole

honors
at

men's and eight women's teams in the conference. All
the teams had been working tirelessly throughout the
