Kuperberg also citedinstances
where actions of the Borough had
caused dissatisfaction within the
campus. "I'm on the Alcohol Policy

However, Kuperberg stated
that because he is an economics
professor, he will be mostly "involved with the financial side of

dealing directly with the school."
Finally, Kuperberg stressed that
the Borough Council elections significantly affect everyone on campus, and especially those students
who are registered to vote in the
Borough or who live off campus.
He urged all registered voters to

Gender specialist visits Swarthmore Swat Foundation
offers the world

By Erik Huneke
Dr. Bernice Sandler, a senior
associatewith theCenterforWomen
Policy Studies, presided over a series of workshops concerning gender-related issues this week. Separate workshops were organized for
students, faculty and staff on October 27 and 28. The program was
sponsored by the offices of the President, the Provost and the Dean.
According to education professor Eva Travers, there is concern
about the "treatment of people on
campus [with respect to] gender issues." This concern is not limited to
the classroom or informal socialsituationsbut extends to extracurricular
activities.
As many faculty members in a
wide variety of disciplines attempt
to incorporate women's issues into
their courses and to be sensitive to
gender concerns in the classroom,
they can benefit from feedback on
their current effortsand suggestions
for new actions. Administrators are
interested in discussing what forms
ofaction are most effective in dealing with cases of sexual harassment.
Swarthmore has undertaken
other programs in these areas, such
as its Acquaintance Sexual Assault
Preventionprogram (ASAP) and the
upcoming symposium on people of
color in the sciences.
Such workshops are nothing
new forSandler. She hasconducted
at least 1500 campus presentations
and written more than 60 articles
about sex discrimination. She has
been a pioneer in exposing differential treatment of males and females
in classrooms.
Working on a Congressional
committee created to" deal with
women's issues, she was instrumental in the creation and passage of
Title IX and other laws prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of gender in education. Aside from receiving a host of honorary doctorates and other awards, she has ap-

During past years, students
have engaged in a wide variety of
projects. Last summer, one spent

Anti-abortion groups
target college papers
Compiled from briefs by the College Press Service
By Diana Smith
Pro-life groups are targeting colleges
with paid newspaper supplements that use
first-person accounts and photographs of babies and developing fetuses to urge women
to consider alternatives to abortion.
"We hadhoped to put it in 100 campuses
nationwide this year," saidBob Cheatham, a
graduate student at the University of Southern Californiaand past president of the California Collegians for Life. Students who
oppose abortion want to print and distribute
1 million copies of the publication through
campus newspapers.
Thecampusnewspapers at Stanford University at Palo Alto, Calif., the University of
Texas-Austin and the University of California-Los Angeles are among about threedozen
universities that have agreed to run the preprinted 12-page advertisement, which runs
as an insert.
However, the supplement hasraised objections from some students who believe it is
an attempt to bypass theeditorial process and
get pro-life views into circulation without
dissenting opinions. Pro-choice students also
have criticized some information in the publication as false or misleading and question
whether First Amendment issues are involved.
Students involved in getting the supplement into college newspapers believe the
pro-choice groups are disgruntled because
Collegians for Life have found an effective
communication tool.
"The vast majority of campus newspapers accept advertising from thefamily-planning industry, i.e., for abortions," Cheatham
said. "I view it as equal access. The advertising for abortions in college newspapers is
really a marketing technique because it's
used to convince students to buy a product....
(The supplement) is not selling a product
it's persuading a point of view."
According to the pro-life sponsors, the
supplement is included in newspapers for an
average charge of IS cents per newspaper,
including printing and distribution. Costs
vary depending on the newspapers' ad rates.
The HumanLife Alliance of Minnesota Inc.
recently paid about $ 1,000 to have the supplement inserted into The Daily Texan, the student newspaper at the University of TexasAustin.
An insert, prepared by the Human Life
Alliance of Minnesota, was recently run at
several colleges, provoking studentreactions.
It features six photos of developing fetuses,
and one picture showing thefeet of an aborted
fetus and two ofbabies. It also includes firstperson accounts of anonymous women who
said they had abortions and regretted the
decision, statistics, names and telephone

numbers of pro-life groups who offer pregnancy testing, post-abortion counseling,
maternityhousing and adoption services and
informationabout the stages of fetal development.
Local pro-life groups decide whether
they want to sponsor the supplement, which
is customized so that local information can
be included on certain pages before copies
are printed. The cost of the advertising
generally is paid by local pro-life groups,
sometimes with the help from the Human
Life Alliance, Cheatham said.
"There needs to be someone responsible for ads
someone on the board to
check figures,'* said Dino Perez, an engineering senior at the University ofTexas. "I
really believe in freedom ofthe press, but it's
the media's responsibility to check facts."
Cheatham said he has reviewed the information in the supplement and believes it
to be correct. "I would challenge those
students to point out where the information
is misleading," he said.
Theresponse was similarat North Carolina State University. "I am outraged at the
anti-choice propaganda so lavishly included
in this Monday's Technician" Sean Korb, a
junior in computer engineering, wrote in a
letter to the North Carolina newspaper. "I
realize that such a large advertisement likely
paid a great many bills, but the integrity of
thepaperand our school have been violated.
The opinion page of the paper is the proper
space for expressing opinions."
Others said they were upset that students' money was being used to support the
newspaper and that all sides in the abortion
issue should have a chance to be heard.
However, editorsand ad managerssaid they
were bound by First Amendment rights to
print advertising regardless of whether they
agreed with it.
"When considering the students who
are upset about the tabloid, you must keep in
mind (his question: How is it any different
from making the tax dollars ofChristians go
toward 'art,' via the National Endowment
for the Arts
Is this freedom of religion,
being forced to pay for art that offends your
religion?" wrote Colin Burch, editorial page
editor of the Technician, in response to the
criticism.
James Barger, advertising manager for
the Daily Texan, said the political viewpoint
of the supplement was not the issue. The
newspaper's policy was designed to be open
to advertisements from people who hold
views contrary to the editorial staff.
Cheatham said the low-key approach
that the supplement takes is a key factor in
decisions to run the advertisement. This is
a more respectable way of presenting some
issues," he said.

Noted controversial sociologist discusses social policy
By Mark Kernighan
Theda Skocpol, a world-renowned sociologist and author, gave the second Cooper series lecture of the year ("AfricanAmericans and National Social Policy from
the Civil War to the Present") on October
14. Skocpol toldabout the struggle of African-Americans againstinequity, pointed out
similaritiesand contrasts with the history of
poor people and otherprotected groups, and
concluded that pro-black reforms have succeeded best under the umbrella of larger
multiracialreform movements.
Skocpol isknown for using history as a
guide to contemporary life. "Policy-making
is always in relation to what was there before," she said. While most historians believe that "universal" government aid policies took off with the New Deal, Skocpol
has tracedthefirst wide-sweeping contributions back to Civil War pensions.
The period from 1900 to 1930, which
Skocpol calls the Maternalist Era, was "an
early welfare state for wage-earning working men." Mothers and grandmothers were
also given pensions, and laws were passed
toprotect women from over-demanding jobs.
Women's volunteer groups formed to "focus the moral attentionof legislators." These
populist movements were reflected decades

later in African-American history. But while
"the moral inclusiveness of the category of
mothers' and white women's groups" led
to "an explicit effort toreach out to mothers
who were different," some groupsexcluded
African-Americans, who continued to suffer from unwritten segregation and discrimination based on geography, job opportunities and domestic traditions.
Under the New Deal, African-Americans said "good-bye toLincoln and hello to
the Democrats;" all races supported Roosevelt. But some programs, such as Social
Security and welfare, put the black working class at a legal disadvantage. The New
Deal also contributed to mothers, children
and the elderly, though "Southern blacks
[still could not] vote or safely organize."
The relationship between black race
and poverty (which, as Skocpol claims,
carry two very different though related
stigmas) has changed recently, with the
emergence of welfare and the urbanization
ofAfrican-Americans, whountilthe 1960's
lived primarily in therural South.The issue
of urban poverty exploded into a "tug-ofwar" between liberals and conservatives
over new welfare policies.
TheAfrican-American race was heartenedby a history of successful, aggressive
activism (sometimes with white coopera-

tion, sometimes without), but also held back
by a history of poverty, from the 19th-century plantations to the farms to the modem
cities.
According to Skocpol,reform prospered
most when African-Americans linkedthemselves to "HonorableBeneficiaries"-multiracial needy groups, such as mothers and
veterans, whose interests didn*tseem as controversial in a racist society. Lyndon
Johnson's War on Poverty and "Great Society" helped poor African-Americans by targeting beneficiaries of all races, softening
the fears of the new far right. It didn't work
forever. "The greatest period of the Reagan
era stigmatized the role of a strong government policy and beneficiaries in barely concealedracial and gender terms," saidSkocpol.
She added that Clinton's campaign,
which glossed over many questions of race
and poverty, could be read in two ways: as a
calculated appeal to conservative white voters (though "the South is no longer a white
racial oligarchy"), or as a benevolent, pluralistic boostfor families and jobs, to "shift the
discourse away from racial divisions."
History professorMarjorie Murphy gave
a fairly long post-lecture, filling in historical
details, supporting Skocpol on most points,
and reexamining some well-reveredinstances
of government outreach for racial bias and

shrewd political acting. Then Skocpol returned to discuss current events, the Reagan
backlash, welfare, health care, and the dynamics of black leadership.
Two political science professors, Rick
Valelly and Carol Nackenoff, organized the
lecture series. Before the lecture, Valelly
introduced Skocpol as "one of the most distinguished social scientists in America."
Skocpol's lecture, held in the PAC in
anticipation of a large audience, was sponsored by the William J. Cooper Foundation
and the Department ofPolitical Science, and
co-sponsoredby the Black Studies Program,
theForum for Free Speech, the Department
ofHistory, the Department ofSociologyand
the Women's Studies program.
This was the 1993 Charles E. Gilbert
Lecture, named after a former professor of
political science, Swarthmore's first Provost, who helped found the Public Policy
program. "One prominent speaker per year"
is chosen for the GilbertLecture.
On November 11 Ira Katznelson from
the New School for Social Research will
give the finalCooper lectureof the semester.
Next semester, according to Nackenoff,
Michael Rogan will speak on black/Jewish
relations in the 1960'5, Jim Mulrone will
speak on labor, and there will be a third
speaker, so far unnamed.

All-campus messages
overload e-mail system
Computing center encourages 'appropriate' communication
By Andy Perrln
Day-long delays in the processing of
important mass e-mail messages have led the
Computing Center to look for ways of stemming the tide of all-campus mailings.
Robin Jacobsen, Manager of User Services in theComputingCenter, toldThe Phoenix that it can take up to an hour for the
college's e-mail system to process an allcampus mailing, and that some messages had
waited as much as 14 hours before being
distributed to their intended recipients.
The latest problem was a message sentto
the faculty reminding them of a faculty meeting; by the time the system got around to
sending the message out the meeting was
over.
Before, explained Jacobsen, frivolous
all-campus mailings were not policed because they caused no problems to the e-mail
system. Now, though, the Computing Center
is considering the deletion of the 'students'
mailing list or restricting its use to authorized
offices in order to avoid system clogs.
Before it does so, however, there will be
a campus-wide education effort and discussionabout more efficient means ofelectronic
communication.
The Computing Center is hoping students will use the NewsWatcher discussion
program and the Gopher information system
to access much of the information that currently comes via all-campus e-mail.
NewsWatcher is a program thatretrieves

post a reply to a previous article. There are
many Swarthmore-onlynewsgroups, as well
as hundreds of newsgroups of regional, national and international interest.

take over the discussion functions of allcampus e-mail, Gopher is intended to be a
general source of information.
In a statement, the Computing Center
emphasized that this move is intended to steer
students toward the most efficient and appropriate means of electronic communication,
not to restrict computer-based discussions.
"We're not trying to eliminate something,
we're just trying to provide more appropriate
means for communications," said Jacobsen.
The Computing Center is planning a
series of student meetings in Sharpies to discuss the proposed changes. In addition, students can send comments by e-mail to acmscomments or post them, using NewsWatcher,
to the _swat.cc.questlons newsgroup.
Jacobsen stressed theurgency of making
some change; if all-campus mailings keep
increasing, she said, "I don't think we can get
much further."

OBERLIN, Ohio
The nation's college bookstores reported a huge increase
222.4 percent â€”in sales of custom-published
and locally produced course materials in August 1993.
The National Association of College
Stores reported a 15.6 percent average in-

crease in totalsales between August 1992and
August 1993, compared with 14.3 percent
from the previous period.
New textbookssales rose 16.5 percent, a
smaller increase than in the 1991-92 accounting period, while used textbook sales showed
an 11.5 percent increase, a little higher when
compared with 1991-92figures.

NORTH EASTON, Mass.
Every
freshman entering Stonehill Collegethis year
is required to donate a day to St. Paul's soup
kitchen, the Habitat for Humanity, a homeless shelter, or the Old Colony Hospice.
"I don'tknow of any other college that
does anything like this with its entire incoming class," said the Rev. Dan Issing, the
founder of the program.
School officials say they created the
program to familiarizestudents with the community of North Easton and to make them
aware of the social problems that exist in the
world outside of college.
"It's proving to be a very positive experience for everyone involved," Issing said.

Education support rises
NEW YORK â€”While contributions by
corporations and their foundations to charitable causes in the United States declined in
1992,colleges and universities can take heart;
donations to higher education rose slightly.
The Council for Aid to Education estimatedthat in 1992higher educationreceived
70 percent of corporate educational contributions at an estimated $ 1.7 billion. This figure
is up less than 1 percent from $ 1.69 billion in
1991. Overall charitable contributions declined 1 percent to $5.9 billion, the council
said.
The council estimated that corporate
contributions to education for 1993 will fall
by 4 percent, based on preliminary information.

OPinJOfl October 29. 1993
Beavis gets with the program, not The Program
The Phoenix

Usually, it begins as a distant rumble, quickly growing in size and magnitude. Then, as
quickly as it comes, it subsides. The panic and concern it causes often does the same. Sound
like an earthquake? In California, possibly. But this editorial refers to the 'increasing'
violence in the television and film industries, and the latest wave of panic it has caused over
the past few weeks.
First, a child accidentally burns down his own home, killing his sister because of a
segment in the MTV cartoon Beavis and Butt-head. Then, because teenagers emulated afilm
scene in which severaldrunkenfootball players lie in the middle ofa busy highway, one is dead
and several are critically injured. Unfortunately, these teens forgot that The Program was
only a movie, and the child was unable to distinguishfantasyfrom reality. As aresult, Beavis
andButt-head has been moved to a later time slot, and an expurgated version <?/The Program
arrived at theaters last week.
While the incidents stemming from both Beavis ...and The Program were treated
similarly, they were not ofthe same like. Although thedecision to move Beavis... to a later time
slot was reactionary, it was nevertheless a good decision. The show is now not as accessible
to younger, less mature audiences. No longer will scenes intended to provide humor be
misinterpreted by children who may not be able to differentiate the perceptual world of
cartoon televisionfrom real human existence. Given whatand whois at risk, we reiterate, the
decision was favorable. It was not favorable just because lives may be saved or at least
mishaps avoided, but rather because the show was made available to young impressionable
audiencesâ€”audiences who were victimizedby theiryouthful naivete. The censorship of the
Dare in The Program, however, is ill-fated and counterproductive.
Like the choice to move the time slot of Beavis..., the censorship in The Program was
reactionary. Foolish teens (mostly from New Jersey), after seeing the movie, decided to
attempt the stunt. Unlike the child who set fire to his home after seeing Beavis..., these
individuals understood the scene in The Program for what it was a stunt. Unfortunately,
however, they attempted it anyway. Who is at fault? Granted, The Program catered to a
younger, male, and possibly macho audience. It was after all a movie that detailedfootball
culture in all of its complexity displaying this complexity in scenes which included heavy
drinking, attempted acquaintance rape, steroid abuse, academic dishonesty, and other
manifestations of male egotism and machismo. However, The Program offered more than
these images. It offered the portrayal of successful drug-free athletes; it detailed genuine,
monogamous relationships between male football players and members ofthe opposite sex;
and it above all demonstrated that these athletes were subject to humanfrailty and human
injury. No one in the movie was invincible (for even the most dominantplayer experienced
defeat at the hands of a career-ending injury). And surely the viewers who attempted the
highway stunt knew that they too were not immortal. Ah, but still should the scene have been
removed?
No. Itis thewrong decision for the wrong reasons. The scene was not considered worthy
ofcensorship whenfirst displayedfor public consumption. Several humandaredevils decide
to play Macho-men after seeing the movie, one dies, a few get injured, and the scene is
subsequently removed. Who are theyfooling ? Everyone who willsee the moviehasbeenmade
fully awareofthe scene. Infact, itsabsencefrom thefilm only increases the mystique ofdanger
with which it is associated. The Dare has now quantitatively risen in risk and valueâ€”becoming even more enticing to would-be daredevils. The decision to remove the scene seems
so temporary and unproductive. Will all displays ofreckless macho male heroics beremoved
from all R-rated movies that teenagers and young adults might watch? Of course that won't
be the case...unless ofcourse individualschoose to emulate suchrecklessness again. The MTV
show was not censored, justredesignatedfor a differentaudience. It wasn'tgiven a different
time slot because a child was accidentally killed, but because that act of misunderstanding
revealed the inappropriateness of the showfor aparticular audienceâ€”not the inappropriateness of the scene for all audiences. The Program is a very appropriate movie which is aptly
given a restricted rating for children under seventeen. Infact, the Dare is appropriate as well.
Itis a vitalpart ofthe movieand similar irresponsible acts are an irrefutable part ofthe culture
the movie posits. What is inappropriate is not the movie nor the scene, but theresponse ofthe
individuals whoenacted what they identified as "stunt" and the reactionary censorship ofthe
scene by the movie industry.
Fory ears American televisionand film havebeenfilled withfoolish anddangerous things
that nobody shouldemulate-a somewhatpitiful reflection ofwhatmany Americans want. But
such a reflection cannot be rectified by knee-jerk censorship.

We are officially in the '9o*s. 'Bo's nostalgia is on the market. "Dazed and Confused" is the 70's version of"American Graffiti" and "The Wonder Years." Television
commercials frown upon the 80's and sell
their product as having *"9o's" values. How
come people get wiser every 10 years? Remember in 1990 when everyone on TV was
saying to RE-everything?
Does it take a new decade to make us
reflect on our society? If politicians knew
this, both the liberals and conservatives could
have a ball. The liberals could change our
number system to a system of base 5, and
people would change their attitudes twice as
much as they would now. Elections wouldbe
more frequent, until conservatives were
elected to office. Then they would change
from a base ten number system to a high base,
say 17. A decade would be 17 years long; so,
the status-quo would be 17 years long. The
conservatives would be in power for that
long. If they really knew what they were
doing, the conservatives would make a base 1
million system. The status quo would last
forever.
Places like Babylon were liberal because
their life spans were shorter than ours. A
human needs a certain number of special
birthdays in his life. Our life spans accommodate about eight of them, for eighty years.
Babylonians needed the same number ofspecial birthdays as we do, so they had a base
sixty number system. Their decade, a tenth of

a century, was only six years long. A Babylonian would have a big bash every six years.
The big two-four wouldbe the mark ofbeing
middle-aged. Because of their base six system, their political climate was liberal.
The lengthening life span of humans is
advantageous to conservatives. Ifpeople start
living longer, our society may switch to a
higher-based system to retain the significance
of big birthday bashes. Having ten or eleven
of them can be a burden to families. They
would have to organize parties all the time,
and big ones, to account for over-population.
Hallmark would not object, however. 0.K.,
enough of the pseudo-SeinLanguage, this is
an editorial.
Of course, thesolution to conserving our
base ten number system is to reevaluate the
motives of the politicians who potentially
threatenit. The terms "liberal" and "conservative" should not classify political views. They
are relative terms. People should deduce their
political beliefs from their ideals. They are
absolutes. Really, whatkind ofideals would a
conservative have if he really supported the
status quo? They wouldcontain the contradictory premises behind current governmental
policy and "traditional" values.
If the premises of an ideacontradicteach
other, one of them is wrong. An opinion
deducedfrom contradictory premises isfaulty.
People shouldlabel opinions in terms of their
premises. No one who deduces their political
views from ideals can support the status quo.
Everyone would want change in the direction
of their primary premises.

Science demonstrates
that spooks do not exist

Supernatural is

often hoaxes and coincidences

By Kar-yee Wu
If you have been walking about campus
lately, you will have noticed certain tell-tale
signs that something is up. The leaves are
turning orange, red or yellow; the weather is
colder and paper ghosts, witches and pumpkins grace the walls and windows of various
rooms. There's even a rumor that Old Tarble
is now haunted.
What does all this mean? Elementary,
my dear readerâ€”it's time for Halloween,
otherwise known as All Hallow's Eve. Time
for all the kiddies to go around and extort
candy from neighbors while dressed up in
ridiculously adorable costumes. It's enough
to make you want to be 8 years old again.
You might ask yourself, "what doesHalloween have to dowith Point/Counterpoint?"
I'm not here to argue the pros and cons of
Halloween, but a broader subject connected
to the whole mystique of it, when ghosts,
ghouls, goblins and other such spirits walk the
earth before being banished by All Saint's
Day (November 1). I intend to argue that
ghosts, ghouls, goblins and the supernatural
itself do not exist. Whether or not I personally
believe in the supernatural is an entirely different matter which I will happily argue with
someone at a later date. What I believe is not
the point; what I argue is.
First and foremost, I should define what
I mean by the supernatural. Telekinesis, telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, Ouija boards and
such related things fall under therubric of the
supernatural. Ghosts, poltergeists, gremlins,
ghouls, gargoyles, demons, devils and the
like are also supernatural, as is as anything
that seems just plain weird (no, not your
younger sibling, nor your roommate). I am
not including witches because they exist
whether or not the supernatural does, just like
Muslims exist whether or not Allah really
exists. UFO's are also an entirely different
subject dependent on your egocentricism.
Now we all know what I mean by the
supernatural. Let's press on. Basically, we
have little to no substantial scientific proof
that the supernatural exists. By scientific proof
I mean documentedevidence (pictures, video,
and the like) that irrefutably capture the existence of the supernatural and that these are
consistentlyreproducible, meaning that someone in the same situation can gather roughly
the same data and produce roughly the same
results. I say roughly because only in a laboratory under very controlled conditions can
you one get the exact same results.
Further, the evidence that we do have
regarding the supernatural points towards
fraud and hoaxes. Remember the guy who
said he had telekinesis and moved spoons
around? Hemoved the spoons by very gently
blowing on them There are other explanations for what people consider supernatural
events, particularly hauntedhouses. After living in old houses for a long time (haunted
houses are rarely ever new), I know some of
the natural noises of the house sound pretty

ghost-like, even down to creaking floorboards sounding as if someone walked
across themwhen you absolutely know
that no one else is in the house.
I also propose that some of the
supposedpsychic connections between
people, even the use of Ouija boards,
seances, and the like, are inherently
influenced by the conscious and/or
unconscious desires of the people that
engaged in them. Body language can
speak volumes as to whatpeople want;
an astute person can read those signs
and react accordingly, even though he
or she may not be consciously aware of
it.
The subconscious is a very powerful thing, enough to influence our
actions whether we know it or not, as in
guiding where the Ouijaboard pointer
goes. We can convince ourselves that
something else guided our hands, but
equally possible is our own subconscious thoughts that movedthepointer.
There are an amazing number of
coincidences in this world. However,
coincidence is not proof. Correlation is
not a direct measure of causality; just
ask yourfavorite statistician. A lot of
ships and planes have been lost in the
Bermuda Triangle, never to be found
or seen of again.
Well, a lot of ships have been lost
off Cape Cod, never to be recovered
again, and I have lost more clothes
doing laundry here than I care to catalogue. No one has suggested that the
coast off Cape Cod is inhabited by
strange and supernatural forces that
mysteriously suck away ships and
planes, nor that the laundry rooms in
Wharton A and E sections have supernatural beings that mysteriously whisk
clothes away (though I would like my
green turtleneck shirt back).
Does the absence of proof mean
that something doesn't exist? Logically, yes. One could argue that we
simply haven't figured out the proper
methods of gathering reliable data on
the supernatural. This argument could
go both ways. We haven't the technology to measure the supernatural or we
don't have to the technology to prove
that the supernatural doesn't exist. An
eclipse was an angry deity eating up
the moon or the sun; now it' s the shadow
of the earth. Who is to say the same will not
of the earth. Who is to say the same will not
happen for things like ESP, ouija boards or
theBermuda Triangle That we cannot explain
it now does not mean something supernatural
causes it. I don't understand why my brother
likes electrical engineering. I certainly
wouldn't suggest it's because of the supernatural (though one never knows with him).
In absence of conclusive proof, logic
demands the nonexistence of the supernatural.

Tests prove nothing...yet
By Ligeia Jennis

At one point some dolt came up
with the idea that the earth was round.
He was, however, roundly ignored
and jeered by every sound-minded
person. These people knew, they just
knew, that the earth was flat.
Furthemore, they knew that their flat
earth had an edge which could be
passed to the doom of many a poor
sailor. Now, these intelligent, knowing people based their conception of
the flat earth on the science of their
day, on the clearly demonstratedfacts
that they discovered and confirmed
with numerous tests.
Unfortunately, these sound
minded people had not run the right
tests. They had made an additional
error as well in saying that they knew
that the earth was flat. The tests they
had performed had never proved the
existence of the flat earth. On the
contrary, the tests had merely proved
that, to that point, there had been no
real evidence worthy of disproving
theexistence of the flatearth. The two
concepts are widely different. When
someone had suddenly come along
with a more efficient test, the playing
ground became quite different. That
one test, in and of itself, had effectively disproved the flat earth theory.
If my high school science serves
me at all, this test is the essence of
scientific inquiry. The scientific
method is wonderful for disproving
things by the existence of contradictory evidence, such as the flat earth
theory being disproved by the pictures from space. The scientific
method cannot, however, prove anything. It cannot prove that I exist or
the reality of Beavis and Butt-head.
What it can do is prove that, as far as
the modern tests go, a hypothesis has
not been disproved.
Rather, by the same tests, it has
only been disproved. All the
conculsions are inrelation to the tests.
Eventually people must take the step
to say that, in all probability, this
hypothesis will never be disproved
and is therefore probably true.
So now we come to the question
of the paranormal. I realize that there
has never been a scientifically accepted study confirming the existence of the supernatural. The logical
extention of this fact, however, is not
necessarily that the supernatural does
not exist. I can believe that the supernatural
does not exist. I can even go a step farther to
say that therehave been many tests performed
of such a wide variety and scopethat I feel that
it is improbable that the paranormal exists. I
cannot, however, say that the fantasy of the
supernatural has been proven. It hasn't been
proven. Or, rather, ithas only been proven in
each of the very isolated instances ofthe given
tests. In other words, someone might someday come up with a more efficient test, just as
they did concerning

the shape of the earth. Ifthey do come up with
a better test, the playing ground of science
would again change, just as it did in regard to
the earth.
I would stipulate that current scientific
abilities are sufficient to dispute the claim of
some individual supernatural events. I think
thatyou can verify a given"psychic's" claim,
if that person goes so far as to say that his or
her supernatural abilities are controllable and
reliable. But what is being "proved" here is
the control of an individual event and not the
existence of a phenomenon in general. I would
say this neatly parallels a math test. The fact
that I cannot pass a multi-variable calculus
test proves only that I am unable to master
multi-variable calculus, not that multi-variable calculus, as a phenomenon, does not
work. If everyone in the world is unable to
pass the multi-variable calculus test, only
thenit becomes possible to believe thatmultivariable calculus is a defunct phenomenon
This belief, however, is not knowledge. The
only fact the world's failure proves is that
current techniques render multi-variable calculus wrong.
A person can come up to me and say that
they believe that science, as we know it, is
sufficient to answer all questions of existence. They can go further to say that, since
they believe this to be true, they also believe
that the supernatural has been proven false. I
would claim, however, that this belief is just
as suspect as my belief, for this argument, in
the paranormal. Nobody has the logicalproof
needed to convince anotherother person. We
are dealing with different assumptions. It is
these assumptions, not any real fact, which
guides our decisions on the reality of the
.

supernatural.
I would like to question this person's
belief, however. The certainty needed to dispel all thoughts of the supernatural is one I
wouldlove to possess. I don't think it is valid,
but it certainly would make sleeping at night
much simpler. Do we really understand the
workings of the universe so completely that
we can discount the unexplained? I certainly
don have that kind of intelligence. I am
reasonably certain that one day we will be
able to explain away all of life's questions. I
just don't think we have reached that point
yet. Discounting, out of hand, phenomena
that have been recorded from as far back as
our first histories is a pretty drastic step. I
don't think we have just cause.
Look at the examples of vampirism and
lycanthropy. For years werewolves and vampires were dismissed out ofhand as fantasies.
Studies have come forward, however, that
suggest that the "magic" of these ghoulies are
really nothing more than genetic disorders.
No, the people do not really change into half
men/half beasts, but they do evince many oi
the other symptoms described in the legends.
Magic, and here I mean the supernatural as
well, is simply anything that hasn't been
explained. At one point the movements of the
sun and moon were magic, as were the actions
of simple chemists. Science has found a way
to explain away some of the magic already.
Eventually, I believe it will see to the rest. The
fact that it has not done so yet is not "proof*
that it never will.

There's Pterodactyls The problem with easy e-mail
Three students relate their experience with e-mail use and abuse
in them dar hills!

There are Pterodactyls running wild tonight,
so ready your armor and your trusty sword
By Ben Salter
"Break out your armor! Mount
your horses, drawyour swords! There
are pterodactyls to kill! "This cry will
ring out across the Swarthmore campus Friday, October 29 as the
Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative
Literature (SWIL) launch the (approximately) 10th annual Pterodactyl Hunt A crowd of brave, intrepid
warriors girded in garbage bag armor, with their highly polished, razor-sharp rolled newspapers glinting
in the lamp light, will be eager for
blood and pizza.
The historyofthis event is fuzzy
at best, as related by two Swat alumni,
Jed Hartman '9O and Jay Scott 'B4.
These
former
SWlLlies describe
thevariousHuntsthat
they have participated in as having
variable rules and
changing aspects
over the years. They
describe it as having
been started by the
FolkDance Club and
taking place in the
Crum Meadow. The
original turnout was
minimal, but a bunch
of people thought it
was a good enough
idea to keep going.
SWIL took over as
sponsor.
Jere 7 m y
ThoTrpe '94, current
president of SWIL,
describes this year's
rules, me primary
objectiveof die game
is, obviously, to kill the two Pterodactyls. This is done by striking the
beast twice upon the foot with a
sword, made of a rolled newspaper.
The player must then capture the
Pterodactyl's "heart," a green glow
stick, and bring it back to home base
(Parrish Beach). Another objective
is to capture the Pterodactyl "eggs,"
which are water balloons hidden
throughout campus.
The players must overcome
fierce Ores and cunning Hobgoblins,
played by SWIL "non-members,"
who surround the Pterodactyls and
guard them. The Pterodactyls themselves are also armed with "poison"
squirt guns to defendthemselvesfrom

theirattackers. If someone is squirted
with one of these, that player must
surrender his sword and return to
Parrish Parlors for a replacement
The playing area consists ofParrish
Beach and NorthCampus. The competitors win apizza for killing a Pterodactyl and bringing its heart back,
and they win a large candy bar for
capturing the eggs. The hunt will be
refereed by Lesley Tsina '96 (who
will be in Parrish Parlors coordinating equipment distribution) and Sam
Weiler '96 (who will be walking
around outside); they will settle all
disputes.
ThoTrpe describes past years as
having some problems, mostly dealing with misunderstood rules and
extra

monsters

which people created on their own.
He also described a
few incidents in
which
people
placed straightened
coat hangers in their
rolled newspapers,
which he said was
"really crappy."
But, he hopes for a
safe, fun time this
year, stating that this
year "Security will
know more about it,
and will be patrolling thearea, and the
rules should be a lot
clearer."
This year will
beTho?rpe' s fourth
Hunt, and he says,
"It's great. It's really a lot of fun as
longasitdoesn'tget
out of hand. My biggest concern is
drunk people, or people who just
come to work out their aggressions."
ThoTrpe says that past Hunts have
drawn anywhere from twenty to one
hundred people. Players can work
together in teams, but they are not
allowed to form groups larger than
six people.
The Hunt will take place from 7
to 9 p.m. tonight. The competitors
will meet in Parrish Parlors to get
their swords and armor and receive a
copy of therules. Itis open to anyone
who showsup. Any questions should
be directed to Jere7my Tho?rpe

hunt, Lesley Tsina x 5575.

Multi-Media Performance
Kip Fulbeck, a multi-media
performance artist who addresses
issues of bi-racial identity, will
represent "banana split & other
mix ups" at Swarthmore College
on Wednesday, Nov. 3, at 8 p.m,
in thePearson-Hall Theatre, Lang
Performing Arts Center.The event
is free and open to the public.
"banana split & other mixups" is a creative illustration of
the cultures and experiences that
have shaped Fulbeck's life. The
combinationoflivereadings, slide
projections, text and sound moves
away from traditionalartistic classification and challenges the
boundaries between artistic media. Rhythmic monologues, anecdotes and snapshot imagery take
the audience through cultural dilemmas raisedby Fulbeck'smultiracial background.
Kip Fulbeck is an assistant

Mission and Patriot improve your groove
The Mission's cinematography is an intense experience

,

By Adam Blakeley and
Will Buttram
Welcome
back from break,
W:
everyone. Boy, am I pissed off to be
back
A: Me too. Let's go back to
Tennessee. I wanna fish some more.
W: Let's hope you have better
luck in classes than you did on the lake,
eh?
A: Agreed. So anyhow, to the
movies. This Friday, The Mission is
playing at 7:30 & 10 p.m. in DuPont,
and on Saturday, same place and time,
is Patriot Games.
W: The Mission: Genius. Jeremy
Irons plays a Jesuit priest whose mission is to convert a South American
aboriginal tribe to Catholicism in the
1750'5. The mission he founds is
successful until European politics
threaten the Jesuit order, and a representativeof thepapacy must decidethe
fate of the mission.
A: Irons is aided by an ex-mercenary, portrayed by Robert DeNiro,
whose characteris certainly themost
volatile in the movie. DeNiro provides some of the most moving
scenes in the movie, particularly his
penance for past crimes.
W: Jeremy Irons is equally
moving. This is easily one of his
best roles (see Damage).
A: (Don't see Damage.) By
the end ofthe movie, circumstances
have put both Irons and DeNiro to
the test Each tries to uphold their
ideals in a different way. Their
images in the last scene transfixed
against each otherput into dramatic
question the nature ofmorality and
the power of religion. I was very
moved by this film.
W: I don'tknow if it was shot
on location, but the scenery was
absolutelybreathtaking. Especially

when coupled with the music, written
(as most ofyou probablyknow) by the

brilliant Ermio Morricone. I know the
soundtrackhasbeen hyped, but I really
believe it lives up to itâ€”not just aesthetically, but to its function in the
movie; some of the scenes are made by
the music. And when you couple
DeNiro and Irons with Morricone, it's
magic.
A: A fantastic movie any way
you sliceit I'd skip just about anything
to see it, but not... (warningâ€”plug
upcoming)
W: The Captain Corduroy "Improve your Groove''party in Tarble (10
p.m.)!
A: Anyway,folks, seeTheMission at 7:30 and then come to a great
party at 10. Onto Patriot Games.Let's
just say, right off, that we disgree about
this movie.
W: Agreed. Surprise, surpriseâ€”
I liked it; you didn't.
A: It's not so much that I didn't
like it... I was just a bit disturbed by
some aspects of it But first, the plot,
whichis based on Tom Clancy's novel
of the same title. Harrison Ford, one of
the best actors in the universe, plays
Jack Ryan, an ex-CIA agent who saves
some members of the British royal
family from an Irish terrorist attack.
W: He then becomes a target of
that terrorist organization, and the rest
of the movie deals with the ensuing
intdUgerKx/counterintelligencemoves.
Not to mention some brash assassination attempts.
A: Qancy'smarketablepreoccupation with warfare technology really
shows through inseveralintense scenes
o' violence and espionage.
Todd Sasaki: Hi guys. Clancy
and the movies don't really give Irish
people a good name, although there are
several good shots of Guinness in the

beginning. I'd still rather play NBA
Jam than watch it. By the way, what
was The Mission about? I got distractedby the cinematography (gen i us)
and the soundtrack (see cinematography).
W: Why don't you go write reviews for someone else and leave us
alone?
A: Actually, Todd has a good
point. There is a fine shot ofa pint o' my
favorite in the film. Furthermore, I was
a bit bothered by the portrait of Irish
people in the film. Obviously, I'm not
trying todefend tcrrorisLs, but the movie
didn't even try to present an Irishman
who was anything but a slug. And the
portrait ofthe IRA and SinnFein given
in the movie was, I thought, a bit inaccurate.

W: Then again, the politics of it
are due to Clancy himself. He'sarightwing bastard, but he knows how to
write.
A: Yeah, I thinkI liked the movie
all-in-all, though parts of it were farfetched. And as I said, my Irish sensi
tivities were disturbed. Besides, the
movie depicted some scenes of CIA
violence that Ihave trouble with, which
the protagonist also appeared to find
disturbing, but with him it's kind of
glossed over. There is the sense that the
CIA were fully justified in theiractions.
Whetherthey were or not, I don' t know.
Those things just bother me.
W: So what you're saying is, you
liked the movie, but you didn't like it,
and then again maybe it was OK.
A: More or less. I think.
W: RighL Well, I highly recommend it Politics aside, it's a great
action-thriller. I'd skip the beginning
of the ML party for it, but not...
A: The Cap'n Corduroy party?
W: You read my mind

Reasons why men are domestically impaired

Milt Priggee

Spec Envy
By Katie Menzer
Willets is being torn apart It always
begins innocently enough. One first-year,
sitting in the lounge, contemplating the airspeed velocity with which a Sharpies banana
of that sizehad to be thrown in order to make
such a substantial stain on the wall, sveltely
comments to another first-year also observing the yellow projectile, "I'm getting a spec
tomorrow."
A gasp is quickly hushed and a furtive
glance is suppressed as the second first-year
remarks in an affectedly calm voice, "Oh,
that's kinda cool. Why don't you bring him
by my room or something if you get the
chance." There is a tense andpregnant silence
as the first first-year clenches his teeth and
says in a voice filled with forced charm,
"Sure, man. I'll do that." Each first-year
walksaway, one murmuring"Hmph! The day
my spec goes to your room will be the day I
actually start reading my Bio 1 homework!"
as the other one thinks contemptuously, "A
spec! You got a spec! You can't handle a
spec!"(catch theWillets Third North allusion
to A Few GoodMerit) and leaves the banana
tocontemplate thisgruesome exchange. These
first-years will never speak again.
And so, let it be known to the Swat
community that Willets is being invaded by a
horrible enemy: Spec Envy.
Although notat first recognized as one of
the seven deadly sins, the study of specs and
spec envy is quickly gaining increased popularity among theologians and desperate humor columnists. It is a phenomenon that
cannotbe easily explained but whose significance cannot be overlooked. The reason why
first-years living in Willets so covet each
others specs is unclear. Perhaps they wish to
share their newfound joy ofS warthmore with
other intelligent and deservingyouths of this
world Perhaps the first-years feel that hosting a spec will give them a chance to return a
smidgen of the warmth and hospitality that
Swat had so graciously extended to them
during Orientation Week (What! Another
8:30 a.m. lecturetomorrow!) to another young
person. Or perhaps the guy wants the five
bucks to buy a load of gummi fish at Tarble.
Whatever the noble reason, specs in Willets
are a hot commodity.
There are, however, different kinds of
specs of varying desirability and value. The
least dear spec is from the species Northern
Massachusettius-New Jersiorum and of the
genus ancd retentivitum. Her/his name is
most likely Michael but all of his/her friends
all have some cute endearing nickname for
him/her, like snugglebunny or skunk burger.
This spec decidedtheminute s/he walked into

It's just that men are basically babies (or as my

Here at Swarthmore, sensitive New Age

I hear that the spec can make a mean pineapple upside-down cake. Hmmm...

and the sense of running free and
unencumbered in nature, like a raging stallion unfettered, which makes
cross-country interesting. This mile
loop also just happened to be that
mile over which the Fords do their
frequent interval workouts during
training. Yes, these boys in the red
and black knew every nook and
cranny of this mile loop; the Fords
are like school in the summertimeno class. To their credit, the
Haverford squad did run well, nearly
shutting us out. Only Reents's sth
place kept us from being utterly
shamed. After Scott, Freeman and
Vann were the next two finishers, at
11thand 12th. Boeye, who suffered
from an illness characterized by a
nasty hacking cough, and was nearly
tripped during the race when the
author went into space cadet mode,
had a sub-par race, but still managed 15th place. John Kane '95,
Jones, freshman Jeremy Weinstein
(making his first appearance in the
top-7), Bartley, Laubach, Peck,
arid the rest of the gang were not far
behind.
The Centennial Championship
meet is the team's next opportunity
to excel. To place in the top three
teams, Swat will have to have an
exceptional effort from the entire
top-7. The team is almost 100 percent healthy and a taper in training
this week after months of high mileage will payoff. There is an air of
confident anticipation andreadiness
about the team this week; we're
ready to bust. And if our performance last year at the Dickinson
Invitational is any indication, Swat
excels as a team on their flat, open
course. After centennials, the Garnet will return to Allentown on November 13 for NCAA Division HI
regionals.

Big plays characterize '93 Series
By Nicholas Gisonda
Offense, offense and more offense. The 1993 WorldSeries can be
summed up just that easily. The
Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies flexed their muscles to
place many runs on the scoreboard
throughoutwhat will beremembered
as the most impressive display of
scoring since Ruth, Gehrig, and the
Yankees of the Murderers' Row era
pounded the competition during the
late twenties and early thirties.
The Blue Jays beat the Phils,
four games to two, in a Series marked
by the herculean efforts of noteworthy individuals. The Jays' attack,
shutdown only once in the Series (by
CurtSchilling's masterpiece ingame
5), was led by suchfamiliar names as
Roberto Alomar, Tony Fernandez,
and Paul Molitor. Alomar was his
usual pesky self, hitting with authority, stealing more than his share of
bases, and making some of the most

spectacular plays in the field that I
have ever seen. Fernandez set a
World Series record for most runs
batted inby a shortstop, nine, includingfiveintheJays' wild 15-14 comebackvictory in Game4. Molitor, the
Series' Most ValuablePlayer, earned
his title by hitting .500 in the six
games, with two home runs and nine
runs batted in. Of course, there's Joe
Carter, whosedramatic ninth-irming
home run off "Wild Thing" Mitch
Williams sealed the Jays' bid to repeat as champions of major league
baseball. To me, however, the unsung hero of theBlue Jays was relief
pitcher Duane Ward, who, in a Series
where the pitchers were generally
hammered, pitched superbly in earning at least one win and two saves.
ThePhils were not withouttheir
ownsetofheroesaswell. ThePhillies,
as always, had "The Dude," Lenny
Dykstra, whose four-homer Series
(including two in one game) will
standas one ofthe great World Series

feats of all time. Many of the Phils'
regulars, such as John Kruk, Man ano
Duncan, and Kevin Stocker, stepped
up to have excellent World Series
performances, both on the field and
at the plate. Pitching-wise, the Phils
staff, like the Jays, was lit up. Still,
there were some efforts, such as Curt
Schilling's shutout in Game 5 and
the incredible 2 1/3 innings of baseball thrownbyRoger Mason in Game
6, but Philadelphia's main downfall
was their tiredand tremendously ineffective bullpen. Blame Phillies
manager Jim Fregosi for precipitating thefatigue ofhispen, especially
that of Mitch Williams.
In the past few years, my interest in the WorldSeries has seriously
declined. However, this World Series between the Blue Jays and the
Phillies was the most entertaining
Series since the 'B6 Mets went all the
way to the championship.
Don't worry Phils fans, the future is looking bright for '94.

Week Nine Pro Football Previews This is where it's at
By Rob Utley

Week Nine marks a bye week
for the Steelers, Oilers, Bengals and
Broncos. As always, home teams
are listed first.
Eagles vs. Cowboys: Ah, yes.
The long-awaited match-upbetween
my two least favorite teams. The
Eagles will go into Sunday's game
against theCowboys with their third
starting QB of the season, Jets castoff Ken O' Brien. The Cowboys, on
the other hand, have a surging QB in
Troy Aikman. Add to the mix WR
Michael Irvin (perhaps the NFL's
best receiver thus far), the NFL's
second-rated defense and a s'B"
halfback who answers to the name
of Emmitt and you have the makings of a blowout.'Nuffsaid. Winner: COWBOYS.
Dolphins vs. Chiefs:The Chiefs
without QB Joe Montana vs. the
Dolphins without QB Dan Marino.
This could have been one of the
season'sbestmatch-ups ifbothstarters were healthy. Even still, the
Chiefs' defense should still put on a
lell of a defensive exhibition. Pick

the Chiefs with plenty of room to
spare. Winner: CHIEFS.
Giants vs. Jets: In the battle for
New Yorkâ€”or should I say New
Jerseyâ€”the Giants/Tets game should
provide an excellent matchup. Both
teams are resurgent, sporting winning records and arepotentiallyplayoff-bound. The Giants' star RB
Rodney Hampton is still nursing
various injuries and without him,
the Giantslack their main offensive
weapon. Reserve back Lewis
Tillman has been very productive in
Hampton's absence, but his reign of
terror is over. Thebalanced offense
of the Jets, led by QB Boomer
Esiason, WR Rob Moore, and RB
Johnny Johnson, is high-powered
and shouldproduce more points than
the boys in blue and white. By the
way, since both teams play their
home games in the Meadowlands,
who's got the home-field advantage? Winner: JETS
Bills vs. RedskinsfMoh): The
departure of WR Gary Clarkand the
resignation ofheadcoach JoeGibbs
were by far the two greatest offseason losses for the Redskins. Al-

though Washington would indubitably have to enter the 93-94 season
with a new look and perhaps decreased productivity, few couldhave
forseen a complete collapse of one
of the NFL's premier teams. Two
years ago, Washington pounded
Buffalo 37-24 in the Super Bowl.
This week at Rich Stadium, Jim
Kelly, Thurman Thomas, and
friends may return the favor. I still
stand with my Redskins, but realistically... Winner: BILLS
