Campus responds to the continued threats
BY MARIA KHIM

mkhiml@swarthmore.edu

Since the first series of threatening emails two weeks ago, there have been two
more similar bomb threats directed at the
campus, one that specifically targeted the
Lang Center for Civic and Social
Responsibility and another that threatened
action on Tuesday, Sept. 1L
Early Friday morning, the second series
of e-mails were directed to the News and
Information Office. All of them were sent
within a short timeframe and consistently
rerouted through multiple remailers in
order to avoid being traced back to the
original source.
Unlike the previous e-mails, this threat
concerned a specific building on campus,
the new Lang Center. Shortly after the emails were reported, the college relayed
the info to the Swarthmore Police

During the. search, a bomb squad was
requested from the District Attorney's
Office of Delaware County after two bombsniffing dogs responded to a package found
in the building. After the package was
examined by the squad and deemed safe,
the area was cleared and people were
allowed back into the building a little after
1 p.m., approximately three hours after the

threats were first received.
"Everything often hinges on what information one has," Associate Vice President
for Facilities Stu Hain said. "When a threat
is very general, there are a limited number
of things that can be done with it. Besides
being watchful, we tried to pay special
attention to building security and keeping
things locked, all the things we always do
in addition to looking out for suspicious
conditions and responding to calls from the
community."

Department.

After being notified at 9:50 a.m. that
morning, the police arrived on campus

with bomb-sniffing dogs that were requested from the Sheriff Department and
Folcroft Police Department. Upon their
arrival, everyone in the Lang Center was
evacuated and the building was secured
until it was found to be safe a few hours

later.
"The biggest problem is that you might
make a mistake;" Chief of Police Brian
Craig said. "We try to search every premise and to make sure people are safe and we
do everything possible to minimize the

threat."
At the time of the bomb threat, Lang
Center Administrative Assistant Delores
Robinson was in the building on her own
except for Associate Director for Student
Programs and Training Patricia James who
arrived sometime later. Both people were
evacuated while the search proceeded.
"I was the only one in the building,"
said Robinson. "I didn't receive the e-mail
so I didn't know about [the bomb threat]
until Stu Hain came in and informed me. I
was asked to leave before the police officers
arrived with their dogs and had to stand
outside until they were done."

"We did take the right
precautions I would hate
for us to be too lax, but...
we don't need to be so
anxious."
Maurice Eldridge '6l
Vice President of the
...

College
Then, on Monday, Sept. 10, another
series of e-mails were received by the
Admissions Office as part of another general threat predicting events the next day.
"The speculation on my part is that all
of this has been triggered both by the fact
that we're starting school again and the
imminence of 9/11, in addition to the recent
news about the investigation of mass murders at Virginia Tech," Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6l said. "All of this
seems to be the context of this behavior."
Similar e-mails were sent to other col-

lege campuses across the country, and
have been traced back to the same remailers located all around Europe. The investigation still continues to be active and a
number of people including Public Safety,

the Swarthmore Police and the FBI remain
involved in the on-going process.
"What is really difficult is that we can't
really 'know' what is real and true. Instead,
one has to go on the probabilities set in
place by accumulated experience and judgment plus any advice the experts at the
police and FBI may or may not provide,"
Eldridge said.
On

the other hand,

difficulties posed in handing such a delicate situation.
"It's hard for me to be closed mouth in

an open community, but it's difficult
because if. you arm the people that are
doing this with information about your
response to the threats, you give them
more strategies and ways to raise your anxiety level," Eldridge said.

"Who would target

Swarthmore?"
Karen Minyety 'OB

the Criminal

Investigation Division under the District
Attorney's Office in Delaware County
remains uninvolved in the investigation
process, but expressed its willingness and
availability to assist if called.
"To my knowledge, the Swarthmore
Police and FBI are reviewing the issue,"
Joseph Brielmann, spokesperson for the
District Attorney's Office, said. "My office
is aware of the e-mail threats and is ready
to assist but as of now remain uninvolved.
We are generally an assist agency and only
get involved when enlightened into the sit-

uation."
All students were notified of each set of
threats through awareness bulletins sent
out to all student e-mail accounts yet in
some cases, students overlooked the emails or did not take them very seriously.
Others remained largely unconcerned in
response despite the repeated reports of the
bomb threats.
"It's hard to take it seriously, especially
after the fourth e-mail. And it's
target
would
Swarthmore.
Who
Swarthmore?" Karen Minyety 'OB said.
Still some students voiced their concern
about these events. "I've been becoming a
little concerned because of the repeated
threats. A lot of people seem to be disregarding it as just another e-mail, but with
something as serious as a bomb threat
maybe the school should have notified the
students through another way as well,"
Taleah Kennedy 'lO said.
The college took a very cautious stance
in handling the issue, especially with the

While putting an emphasis on staying
cautious and vigilant, many agreed that
there was no need to become overly worrisome or troubled of the incidents and that
it was important that this did not disrupt
the life on campus.
"There can be two aspects to this situation," Craig said. "Number one that everyone should be aware of the situation but
more importantly, that people shouldn't let
it disrupt their daily routine. They can't
stop living because there is a flux in the
world. You can't let it stop everything that
you're doing but you have to make an evaluation, determine how to react to it, and go
on with your life and move on."
While it is important to remain notified
and aware, the school also expressed its
wishes to handle the situation in a very
calm and undisruptive manner.
"We did take the right precautions,"
Eldridge said. "At this point, I don't think
there is anything to be gained by being
worried. We live in a world where a certain
amount of alert is necessary. In my past
experience at an urban school, a number of
times the problem was that even though
something real was happening, it [became]
so routine that people don't take it seriously. I would hate for us to be too lax, but on
the other hand, we don't need to be so anxious. Finding a balance is what we have to
do."

PE credits to be completed by sophomore year
BY APOLLINE BERTY

abertyl@swarthmore.edu
As a result of some students not gradu-

because of a failure to complete their
PE requirements, the entire Dean's Office
recently decided that starting with the
class of 2011, students who fail to complete
their physical education requirements by
the end of sophomore year will neither be
able to pre-register for courses nor be able
ating

to participate in the spring housing lottery.
"Although policy has not changed, the
new consequences which currently apply
only to the class of 2011 are not mentioned
on the Academic Advising and Support
Web site," said Associate Dean for
Academic Affairs Garikai Campbell '9O.
Although the new consequences that
have been attached to the policy only apply
to the Class of 2011, this fact has not been
explicitly stated on the Academic Advising
and Support Web site.
"We could've done a better job of saying
to everybody, being clear and articulate

about how the other classes were affected
and how it was different from how the
incoming class was affected," Campbell
said.

Students had always been highly persuaded to complete their PE requirements

THE PHOENIX

by the end of their sophomore year, but
now they are obligated to do so in the face
of these new consequences. According to
Campbell, however, these measures were
added for the benefit of the students to
ensure that they do not run into problems
in their senior year and to encourage them
to take part in the benefits of physical edu-

cation.
"The most important thing is that this is
not intended to be some draconian measure," Campbell said. "It's meant in two
ways; first to be protective, it is a requirement that must be done by the time one
graduates and we would like to protect
folks from finding themselves in a jam a
jam that ultimately puts enormous strain
on PE instructors, the student and potentially on families preparing to come see
their son, daughter, nephew, niece, etc.
graduate."

"Trying to do all the PE credits senior
year is very hard," Housing Coordinator
Liz Derickson 'Ol said.
Campbell believes that lack of completion of the PE credits will be a "rare occur-

rence." The consequences of not completing four PE credits by the end of sophomore
year will now include being placed on hold
from pre-registration and prevented from
participating in the spring housing lottery,

which would likely lead non-compliant students to receive poor housing relative to
their class year.
Additionally, students who do not complete their PE credits by the end of sophomore year will then have to meet with
Campbell to develop a plan for making sure
that the requirement is fulfilled. This is
also true for students of the classes of 2010
and 2009, who will also have to meet with
Dean Campbell to discuss their plan for fulfilling the PE requirement, though "nobody
in classes of 2010 and 2009 will have to
worry about the precise consequences that
the 2011s would face," Campbell said.
"The consequences seem harsh but I
think their idea is good," Jake Ban 10 said.
Some freshmen do not seem particularly
concerned with the new measures, viewing
them positively as a motivation to complete
the units in time, and as a way to escape
work for a little while.
"I actually don't mind too much,
because I wouldn't do it unless I was
pushed into it," Rhiannan Thomas 'll said.
"If I do it now, I won't have to do it junior
and senior year."

Thomas also mentioned that though she
didn't mind having to do the credits within
two years, albeit that she was somewhat
bothered by the fact that older students had

September 13, 2007

a different system. Furthermore, she said
that this new rule for the class of 2011 may
in fact ease the transition to a new system,
as it would prevent the over-enrollment of
PE classes with sophomores and juniors
scrambling to complete their credits.
Though some may argue that being
forced to take PE credits in only two
years might get in the way of taking certain
classes, Thomas believed that the PE classes would probably be beneficial to studying. "PE as a whole is a pretty good thing;
even though it takes away from studying, it
ends up making your studying more effi-

cient."

"For those students who are in that situation where they are really trying but can't
find the course they want, I can appreciate
the difficulty ... but hopefully that will only

happen once out of four semesters. This
seems the best we can do given all the
restraints," Campbell said.
Moreover, Campbell added that there
are about 35 PE classes offered at various
times throughout the day, as well as clubs
that also satisfy the credits.
"I'm not a student trying to sign up for
these classes, but I think that the athletic
department has done a pretty terrific job in
having a large number of offerings spread
out throughout the day," Campbell said.

SEPTA raises fare prices due to lack of funds
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

A projected $l5O million deficit results in ticket cost increases by an average of 11 percent
BY ELENA CHOPYAK
echopyal@swarthmore.edu
This
summer,
Pennsylvania
Southeastern
Transportation Authority raised transit pass prices, lightening the pocketbooks of both frequent and occasional
Regional Rail commuters.
According to SEPTA's Web site, a "Zone 3," which
includes the Swarthmore station, round-trip peak ticket
increased from $9 to $9.75, resulting in a 8.3 percent price
increase, and an off-peak round trip tickets now costs $8.25,
a 10 percent jump from $7.50. Monthly and weekly pass fares
have increased by approximately 11 percent.

"I think I'm less likely to go into the
city with a bunch of friends unless
the [Philly] shuttle is running."
Marina Isakowitz 'O9
According to a press release statement provided by
SEPTA Media Relations Press- Officer Felipe Suarez, SEPTA
has suffered a deficit due to a lack of funding and a rise in
expenses. "SEPTA projected it would face a $l5O million
deficit in its Fiscal Year 2008 Operating Budget due to the
lack of a dedicatedfunding source for transportation authorities in the state of Pennsylvania and an increase in expenses (which include wages, health care benefits, material and
services, fuel and utilities)," the statement said.
"The SEPTA Board approved Budget Plan A to increase
fares by an average of 11 percent in order to raise $35 million
and hoped to receive additional funding from the state to
cover the remaining deficit."
A SEPTA ticket agent who requested anonymity to protect her job security said that SEPTA's price hike is justified.
"I feel SEPTA is doing the best it can with what it has to
work with. They are very concerned about their customers,"
she said. Despite the fare increase, the ticket agent has not

witnessed a decline in the number of people taking SEPTA.
"I have seen an increase in people buying passes because
that is the most efficient way to travel," she said.
Swarthmore Borough Manager Jane Billings has also

observed an increase in the number of people taking SEPTA.
Also, Billings stated that she has not heard many complaints

from SEPTA passengers over the fare increase. "The cost of
driving and parking is way more than the cost of SEPTA,"
Billings said, citing the increase in gas prices as a significant
deterrent for driving a car. "People do not have the option
not to go to work."

According to http://septa.org, SEPTA boasted an annual
ridership in 2005 of 299 million, servicing over 2,200 square

Furthermore, students have the option of taking the college-run Philly Shuttle on the weekends by reserving seats

and perk type.Suarez pointed to the University pass program, which has existed for 10 years, as a way SEPTA reaches out to college students. The program allows students to
buy discounted passes from their university for a semester.
However, Temple and UPenn are the only two universities

that currently participate.

The price of these university passes has increased by 11
perccent as well. The price students pay for the passes
depends on the price the universities set themselves. "The
price [of the university pass] did increase along with the
other passes," Suarez said. "However, the price is passed on
the university." Most Swarthmore students, however, are
ineligible for "Pass Perks," as they ride SEPTA only occasionally, often to go out on the weekends or to travel home.

fare increase. "I think I'm less likely to go into the city with
a bunch of friends unless the [Philly] shuttle is running,"
Isakowitz said. While SEPTA has received complaints, it is
uncertain what kind of commuter seems to be the most
upset. "We did receive our fair share of complaints, but we
do not have a breakdown of the calls," Suarez said.
However, there are some who chose SEPTA over other
means of transportation. Even though she owns a car,
Visiting Instructor in the Spanish department Elena LahrVivaz depends on SEPTA to travel from New Jersey to

Lahr-Vivaz pointed to the stress level of driving, environmental impact, uncertainty of traffic patterns and leisure
time on the train to explain her decision to opt for a one and
a halfhour train commute as opposed to a 45 minute drive
into Swarthmore.
"As the semester goes on, I might take the car more
often," Lahr-Vivaz said, stating that travel time and fare
prices play a large role in her transportation choice. LahrVivaz noted that the college allows faculty to purchase transit passes before taxes are removed, resulting in a 30 percent
savings on tickets.
"You will always have people who find the unfairness in
everything," the SEPTA ticket agent said of passenger complaints. "But you also have people who understand."

StuCo moves forward with diversity workshop
BY ROSA KIM

rkiml@swarthmore. edu

Student Council reconvened in late August to participate
in a diversity and anti-oppression workshop facilitated by
Training for Change (TFC), an internationally-recognized
Philadelphia-based organization whose objective is to "help
groups stand up for justice, peace and the environment
through strategic non-violence," according to its Web site.
The idea of having an anti-oppression workshop for
Student Council and other student leaders developed in discussions in the dean's office, the council and leaders of the
IC and BCC communities. "All of us together in various conversations decided that having an anti-oppression workshop
for Student Council would be a productive move, in terms of
getting the council educated about certain issues and to formulate a plan for the future," said Sam Asarnow 'OB, Student
Council Vice President.
Members of the IC and BCC reacted positively towards
the Student Council's efforts to make what members viewed
as necessary improvements.
"Just like the diversity workshops we have for freshmen,
I think that this shows thatthis is an important issue to community," said Nicole Nfonoyim 'OB, an executive board member of the Swarthmore African-American Student Society
(SASS).
"This is really important in the way that we Swatties do
things. The fact thatthere is a space for that dialogue is really significant and it really shows the type of culture that we

have and the type of students that are part of this communi-

ty."

"I'm glad that [the workshop] happened, and I think that
should have happened in the past as well," said Rory Sykes
'OB, organizing member of Class Awareness Month, member
of the Student Queer Union (SQU) and IC executive board
member.

In addition to having worked with the college in the past,
TFC, an internationally recognized organization for nonviolent social change, has a diverse clientele, including
Greenpeace U.S.A.
Its experience with a wide range of groups and its knowledge of Swarthmore's particular environment appealed to
the council as the right organization to help themreach out
to the different communities on campus and help them create an effective plan to meet their goals.
The first part of the two-day workshop focused on establishing the historical and present diversity framework at
Swarthmore and laying down the college and council's priorities concerning diversity.
From there, they moved onto exploring the most effective
ways to communicate with the various groups on campus,
each with its specific needs.
"We sat down and started with where do we go from here.
What are the concrete things we can do and changes we can
make to help everybody move forward in a collaborative and
productive way," said Student Council President Peter
Gardner 'OB. Gardner also expressed interest in exploring
what initiatives and outreach projects Student Council

could pursue to these ends. In the structured environment
provided by TFC, council members explored creating a plan
for the specific changes they wanted to make. "Something
that I thought was really valuable was how communication
can be used as a powerful tool for anti-oppression. That's not
something Student Council had a ton of experience with. I
feel much better equipped to use that tool [now]," Asarnow
said.

"[Student Council] can take certain
actions that can help to alleviate the
experience of oppression and start
the semester by taking tangible
action."
Peter Gardner 'OB
Student Council President
Some of the specific issues raised in the workshop included ways in which the council can make various processes,
such as student funding, more transparent, and how
addressing accessibility difficulties experienced by some
groups in the past. "The best way that I see for Student
Council to respond and interact in a positive manner, is to
make certain processes more fair for everyone," Sykes said.
"When it comes to money and power with student government, like Forum for Free Press and SBC, and other subsidiary groups, Student Council should make sure that these
committees with power and money are stable, on track and
held accountable."
This includes clear appeals processes and explanations
provided for the decisions made. Gardner, who was quoted
in a May 2007 Phoenix article as planning to advocate for
"efforts to increase course offerings that reflect institutional
support of queer students, students of color and Workingclass citizens," expressed his continued willingness to stand
by this effort.

"We can take certain actions that can help to alleviate the
experience of oppression and start the semester by taking
tangible action. This is an issue in which Student Council
should be playing an active role; we are the advocates of the
student body. That does not mean that we're giving up on the
broader, more long-term goals. Ethnic Studies, for example."
Gardner said. When asked whether these efforts were in
direct response to the disappointment expressed by members of the IC and BCC on the presidential candidates' lack
of knowledge and involvement concerning the different
groups on campus, Asarnow said, "As someone who had a
think
it def-

leadership role in Student Council during that time, I
that this is not just a specific reaction to that, although
initely catalyzed this process."
Asarnow said that it's possible for some of the
issues to have come to the surface in another way. "I

same
think

that whole controversy was a reflection of another set of
underlying issues that are broader on campus," Asarnow
said. "A lot of this is Student Council not being perfectly
adapted to these situations. I think what we've been doing
has been in response to those issues, not just to the forums
that we had. Although at that time allegations were made
against people who were running for president, Student
Council has decided that it is something we as a whole needed to be educated about."
The council also sees this as an opportunity to move forward in a collaborative and productive way. "We don't want
to have our plans be something Student Council lays down
as this is what we're going to do. We want it to be a two-way
process that involves the whole community, particularly the
IC and BCC communities," said Asarnow.
Sophia Pan 'O9, a member of the Swarthmore Asian
Organization, said thatshe would like to see commitment to
go beyond dialogue and see concrete policy changes made.
President of SASS Keith Benjamin 'O9 said that it's
important to look forward and make real progress. "There
has to be a marrying between Student Council and the diversity groups. We have to be stepping up and we have to take
charge as well, and not just demand certain things, but make
certain things happen," Benjamin said.
"As TFC said, where it may seem like there is a lot of
intractable conflict, those are spaces where institutions can
progress and make great leaps forward," Gardner said.

Psych Services undergoes a name change
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ROSA KIM

rkiml@swarthmore.edu

What's in a name? More than one might
think, based on comments from students
and administrators in response to
Psychological Services' recent name
change.
Psychological Services, which has been
running under its original title since it was
established in 1980, was renamed
Counseling and Psychological Services

over this summer. CAPS Director David
Ramirez initiated this name change with
support from the administration. Dean of
Students Jim Larimore said he had been
conferencing with Ramirez about a name
change since last spring. Ramirez continued
dialogue with administrators and students
before deciding to enact the change. This
summer, the name switch took full effect,
and the college Web site, bulletin and student planner all reflect the change.
Ramirez said the hope is that including
"counseling" in part of CAPS' official title
will better communicate the variety of services available and make the facility more
accessible and approachable for students.
"Especially in the last few years, I got feedback from my colleagues in the dean's office
that the name Psychological Services had
been suggesting to some people a formality
and seriousness that didn't accurately characterize the range of reasons people come to
[CAPS]," Ramirez said.
Although it's a subtle change, some students said the new name seems more casual
and carries less of a stigma. "When you tell
another student 'l'm going to CAPS,' rather
than 'l'm going to Psychological Services,' it
doesn't seem as big of a deal," said Ashley
Da vies 'lO, a transfer student from The
College of William & Mary.
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt
Westphal would like students to perceive
CAPS as a resource for exploring ways to
come up with solutions to a wide array of
issue that they might have. "If you're stuck,
if there's a block, or something that's not
going well for you in a particular realm of
your life, you can get some advice and help
to look at what is the situation and what
needs to change for it not to be an issue,"
Westphal said. "We all need counseling now
and then. This is an opportunity to explore
with trained professionals
something
that is not working right for you right now.
Whether that's a friendship, a family rela...

tionship, if you're not getting the grades you
want, or if you have a diagnosable condition
like depression or anxiety."
Many counseling centers in colleges and
universities across the nation go by CAPS,
including neighboring institutions such as
the
University
Pennsylvania,
of
Pennsylvania
State University and
Haverford College. "The name that we
chose, CAPS, is descriptive and it provides a
memorable acronym. The hope is, if the old
name was a barrier at all, that that barrier
will be eliminated," Ramirez said.
The name change doesn't completely

eliminate reservations some students may
have about counseling, however. As
Ramirez suggests, there are sometimes still
issues of uncertainty and fear, possibly contributed by others' attitudes toward counseling.

"There's a stigma attached to counseling
not only on Swarthmore's campus, but
everywhere," Jim Marzluff 'OB said.
Ramirez, who has worked at Penn and
Haverford before coming to Swarthmore,
believes that although misunderstandings
and stigmas still exist, comparatively speaking, there is more acceptance to the idea of
counseling and psychotherapy than there
was in the past.
Statistics indicate that about 35 to 36 percent of the students of any given year will
have sought counseling at least once by the
end of their Swarthmore career.
When asked about how Swarthmore's
environment might play a role in triggering
certain emotional reactions compared to
that of other institutions, Ramirez said, "I
think Swarthmore's academic rigor and the
opportunities that are afforded to students
that they end up taking advantage of create
a kind of intensity that is somewhat
unique."

He also said that this intensity doesn't
necessarily translate into negative stress. "I
think for many people it's a very energizing
and livening kind of intensity. I think the
things that bring people to the counseling
center at Swarthmore are the same kinds of
things that bring people to the counseling
centers at other colleges and universities,"
he said. "And this involves the challenges
that come with self-exploration, from
"learning about life, dealing with relationships, family problems, [to] alcohol and
drug use, that are independent of academic
stress and more reflective of a more internalized stress land pressure."

Psychological Services changed its name over the summer to CAPS. Director David
Ramirez and others hope that the change will lessen the stigma attached to the name.
Ramirez said that although these are
experiences college students share in different ways, they aren't necessarily direct
byproducts of college. "I don't feel that college creates the kind of psychological distress in a person they might not ordinarily
experience somewhere else," he said.
Nevertheless, increasing suicide rates at
colleges and universities such as the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
New York University have been under the

media's watchful eye over the last several
years.

Just this past Friday, The Daily
Pennsylvanian, Penn's independent student
publication, reported that a 23-year-old
undergraduate was brought back to safety
after an attempted suicide on Penn's cam-

pus.
As for Swarthmore, in the early days of
CAPS' establishment, there was a myth that
the suicide rate at Swarthmore was much
higher than that of other colleges and universities. Ramirez said that because of
Swarthmore's academic reputation such a
concept seemed plausible.
Since his arrival at Swarthmore, there
was one case of suicide in the fall of 1995.
"One thing I can say is that all counseling
services are experiencing more and more

attendance, that's reasonably a universal
experience for counseling services in uni-

versities and colleges across the country,"

said Westphal.
Ramirez believes the best prevention for
suicide and stress on all levels is creating an
emotionally-safe environment. This entails
"adequate provision of counseling and psychotherapy that's worth the college's investment."

Ramirez also expressed future hopes for
a greater amount of space to be able to provide more services and also offer more privacy. This may involve building a formal
entrance in addition to the entryway
through Worth Health Center, but as of now,
this is more of a proposed idea than a com-

mitted project.
Davies suggests
brochures around
mailings would be
campus to address

that distributing CAPS
campus and through

one way to compel the
attitudes surrounding
this issue. Such pamphlets would help
increase CAPS' presence on campus and
raise awareness amongst students regarding many details, namely that there is no
limit to the number of sessions you can
request, and that they are paid for by the
college. For Larimore, future visions for
CAPS include providing studentled support
groups in addition to individual counseling,
and outreach work to challenge any existing
stigma concerning counseling and psychotherapy on campus.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Spammers hijack sites hosted on SCCS servers, exploiting a vulnerability in the The Phoenix's Web site
Between the approximate hours of 7p.m. to midnight
this Monday, SCCS had to reinstall their server software
due to a stealthy hijacking of certain SCCS Web sites by
spammers, apparently using as a jumping point an
unknown vulnerability in the directory containing The
Phoenix's Web site.
According to Swarthmore College Computing Society
Coordinator Kit La Touche 'OB, the spammers had apparently been executing arbitrary commands in the background of the site primarily to route www-data/PHP pharmaceutical spam mail through it.
SCCS discovered the problem on Sunday, La Touche
said, when "we noticed the load on the server was really
not normal and generally bad." After looking into it, SCCS
discovered the problem, choosing to reinstall the server
software rather than engage in a difficult search to find
the offendingfiles.
In response to the hack, SCCS took down The
Phoenix's site until further evaluation of its security status. It remained uncertain as to whether or not unique
vulnerabilities in The Phoenix's current Web site code
caused it to become a target, though La Touche said it was

6

likely a coincidence that the hackers targeted The
Phoenix's directory in particular.

"[On Sunday night], we noticed the
load on the server was really not
normal and generally bad."
Kit La Touche
SCCS Coordinator
"It's not entirely clear," La Touche said. "It's definitely not the entire fault of The Phoenix page." Some of the
problems may have arisen from "unused processes in the
background." While some PHP Web coding protocols will
be blocked on The Phoenix's site until a full security audit
can take place, The Phoenix's site was brough back online
yesterday evening with all primary functions unaffected.
Furthermore, the spammers utilized scripts they

September 13, 2007

placed in directories on the SCCS servers to hop spamming protocols into other SCCS-hosted Web sites' directories, including those of Free Culture, The Daily Gazette

and a few user pages.
"The [Free Culturel Web site was sort-of deadlisted,"
Free Culture member Ben Mazer 10 said. "It was using a
very old version of blogging software. Because it was so
old, there were some vulnerabilities." Mazer reported
that the Web site had apparently been covered with ads
for "porn and Viagra pills" until the SCCS reverted their
site for them.
While it seems as if the integrity of all SCCS sites
affected will return, La louche expressed some worry as
to the lingering effects of the attack. Specifically, La
Touche worried as to whether the spam being routed
through the SCCS system could have placed SCCS on
spamming "black lists" for software such as "SpamCop"
and conglomerates such as Google, though this remains to
be seen.
"For now, it seems to be just an unfortunate thing," La
Touche said.

Earthlust recognized for wind power initiative
PennFuture will be awarding campus environmental group with the "Green Power: Turn It On!" award
convince the Board of Managers to commit to a
higher percentage of wind power.
Earthlust first began its campaign for wind power
on the Swarthmore campus in 1997, and it is still campaigning to reduce carbon emissions.
Earthlust member Elizabeth Crampton 'O9 said, "We
are certainly not done yet."
Last year's wind power achievement, marked by the
group's award, will lead into this year's carbon-neutrality campaign.
The campaign's goals include seeking balance
between producing and using carbon, especially balancing carbon-dioxide emissions. Some possible ways
to do so include planting trees to offset vehicle emissions and growing plants to use as fuel sources.
This campaign is based in Chester, Pennsylvania,
the location of a dumping ground.
Right now, Earthlust is doing the background work
and investigating the steps that have already been
taken to help the situation and is preparing the site to
layout a comprehensive plan for action.

not only seek alternative sources of energy, but to

Earthlust recently received notification that it will
he honored with the "Green Power: Turn It On!" award
for 2007 from Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future
(PennFuture).
The college's own environmental awareness group
was selected as a winner as a result of its efforts to use
wind power as a prominent source of energy on campus.

"Energy is cheap, so there is no
strong motivation to modify what
[We have to find]
what we do
ways to use less."
Rachel Merz
Professor of Biology
...

Through last year's campaign, Earthlust was able to
attain Swarthmore's current use of 40 percent of energy sourced from wind power.
Prior to last year's efforts, the college had been purchasing 19 percent of its energy as wind power.
In order to increase the percentage, Earthlust held
a rally last year before the annual budget review meet-

have.
Rachel Merz, biology professor and faculty member
of the environmental studies department, said,
"Energy is cheap, so there is no strong motivation to
modify what we do." Merz also said that it is imperative that we find "ways to use less [energy], and modify the ways in which we consume." Earthlust members
have taken this initiative directly to campus.

Earthlust member Shandra Bernath-Plaisted 'O9
said, "It is our responsibility to find a much more sustainable and less harmful way of life. Our everyday
lifestyle choices actually make huge impacts on the
environment."

Bernath-Plaisted said the award from Citizens for
Pennsylvania's Future enabled "a congratulatory
beginning" for the group and was an encouraging way
to say "good job for starting."
The added bonus of the "Green Power: Turn It On!"
award only serves as motivation for current Earthlust
members looking to the new year with further plans to
address environmental issues.

Inn construction awaits college decision
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Several interested developers have submitted plans and are awaiting review
rpazl@swarthmore.edu
Discussions between the college and the borough concerning the inn development project are in continuance
for the new school year. Recently, the college requested
that various interested developers submit their qualifications and a concept plan to present their general ideas
for the proposed inn in the Ville.

"Currently, the borough Is at a
standstill in the developments for the
inn Because the development is
occuringon private college property,
they're the ones in the driver's seat."

Associate Vice President of Facilities and Services
Stu Hain has worked on the "request for qualifications,"
a document that was recently sent out to approximately
20 firms that were deemed appropriate for the develop-

ment project.
"[The developers] tell us who they are, their concept
and how they plan to develop the site. Ideally, we know
that there are eight to nine developers who've expressed

interest," Hain said.
The document lists the various details of the inn
development project, including the number of allotted
rooms, the amount of retail space and the exact location.
Developers are then asked to respond with their own
concept plans by Sept. 14.

"The developers

that's when
they'll go ahead and decide. The
college is putting up the land. The developers will have
to rent the land and lease," Hain said.
At this point, the college can decide to narrow down
the list of concepts and talk to developers most suitable
for the project. Subsequently, the selected developers
will be sent a second document, a request for proposal,

sit down and work out all the num-

...

about their intentions.
Swarthmore Borough Manager Jane Billings said that
the borough and college are looking for a more concrete
decision on concept plans by February.
The idea for an inn as a joint collaboration between
the college and the borough came about in the mid-19905.
Both entities mutually worked towards developing
a nearby locale that would attract more activity for the
town.
Hain said that there was a town plan developed with
various steps on how to go about proceeding with the inn

idea, including the hiring of planners for the
project. Since the plan involved tranportation-oriented
development, due to the vicinity of the train station, the
idea, Hain said, was for the inn to be "situated in a very
thriving town where people can stay to work overnight. That's always been the plan and we'll see what
happens."
"Around 2000 there was a referendum in the town,"
Hain said. "There was a vote to serve alcohol in the Ville,
to facilitate the building, to create a regional draw and
help make the town more lively. That was the driving
principle that always focused on a restaurant and a bar,
a retail space and an inn."
After the referendum was passed, the borough and
college encountered another issue with parameters in
2005. An ordinance was proposed in order to establish
the IN-C Institutional Commercial Overlay District.
This was done in order to modify the type of zoning in
which the inn was intended to be built. The west side of

Chester Road near the train station, the

proposed

area

for the inn, was institutional zoning. "The borough
changed the zoning to allow commercial development,"
Billings said.
Currently, the borough is at a standstill in the developments for the inn until the college makes a decision

based on the responses received from the request for
qualifications. "Because the development is occurring on
private college property, they're the ones in the driver's
seat," Billings said.

"There was a vote to serve alcohol in
the Ville, to facilitate the building, to
create a regional draw and help
make the town more lively."
Stu Hain
Associate Vice President of
Facilities and Services
"At this point, the borough is in a sort of a wait and
hold position," said President of the Swarthmore

Borough Council Peg Hebner.
"We are waiting to see, based on what the developers
submit, whether [the college] need[s] anything from the
borough that is not already covered in the existing ordinance. The subject would be open for discussion with
people in the community, and there would be action
based on those factors. Beyond that, there isn't anything
that we can do except say that we have laid the groundwork," she said.
"Not all college and towns work well together, and I
think we're lucky sometimes. We're very excited to continue working with the college. It's a great effort,"

Billings said.

Mascot to be finalized by winter 2008

Raymond Entertainment consulted for final character design of the phoenix
BY RAMYA GOPAL
rgopall@swarthmore. edu

The athletics department's phoenix mascot is being constructed and is expected to be completed by early next winter. Embodying the Swarthmore spirit, the mascot will be
a mythical creature with Swattie superpowers.
The "character-building process," student co-chair Kyle
White 'OB said, has been contracted out to Raymond
Entertainment. Currently, they are finalizing the character
design while planning the selection process for candidates
to actually "be" the phoenix. Although the committee discussed utilizing Swarthmore resources for the mascot, "we
tried to figure out ways to not go corporate," White said.
Raymond Entertainment developed a reputation by
designing the Philly Fanatic, the mascot for Philadelphia's
baseball team. Raymond Entertainment has also constructed such mascots as the University of Delaware
Fightin' Blue Hen and Millersville University's parrot-bodied Marauder, Scully.
CEO David Raymond said that his company "works
with sports teams, colleges and universities and corporations
to [help] people understand how to be successful
with character branding."
Additionally, Raymond said that the company works
with a diverse range of services including, "consulting programs all the way to construction."
"The reasons for hiring a contractor were special,"
White said. "The time frame was not realistic, nor the
maintenance. We wanted to get more support service."
Such services would include quick damage repairs and a
mascot "bootcamp" training for candidates, White said.
White said that the total contracting cost for the mascot

was not disclosed to him.
Using designs submitted by Swarthmore students as
guidelines, the committee is working with the company to
create the personality. Most importantly, said Women's
Lacrosse Head Coach Karen Borbee, the committee "didn't
just want a costume. We wanted a whole personality."
Borbee cited this as being an additional reason to "get the
experts" in the field of mascot designers.

"My concern was also that the
character shouldn't be silly. But I
found out that the students want to
be known as college students
having fun."
David Raymond
Raymond Entertainment CEO

"Character building" is how Raymond describes his
company's work. Although he has helped create characters
for large and small colleges alike, Swarthmore was a different type of institution in its "enormous emphasis on academics," he said. "The intellectual program is by nature
higher than most... [we] want outsiders to know that students can enjoy college life as well."
This difference posed an issue to Raymond. "My concern as well was that the character shouldn't be silly," he
said. "But I found out that the students want to be known
Septermber 13, 2007

as college students who are interested in learning, but at
the same time having fun." It was a contrast to other colleges, where "we have toned down the silliness, usually
and [have to] explain that a character can say great things
[to others] about community good, fundraising and the
like."
Fun seemed to be the feeling that White wanted to present. "Intelligent," "goofy," "rumpled but personable" and
"always there for you" were the phrases he used to describe
the mascot; these characteristics "embodied what Swat is,"
he said.
As a mythical creature, the phoenix would have the
power of osmosis. "It can touch anything and absorb it... a
trait any Swattie would want," White said. Among other
oddities, the phoenix is gender neutral, lives in the Parrish
dome, "travels around campus by steam pipes" and can
only fly upwards. According to White, the quirkiness just
"seemed to fit."
Committee Member Elena Viboch 'O9 said, "I particularly loved the fantasy look." Physically, the costume will
be able to accommodate people of varying body sizes.
The Mascot committee met over the summer and underwent some changes, to include a more diverse range of
members, such as alumni, deans, other administrators and
students not involved in athletics.
The phoenix will definitely make an apperance at
Haverford games and at various other events on campus
such as alumni weekend, Chocolates and Choosing, and
may even be found roaming around Parrish Beach on occasion.

Committee member and Housing Coordinator Liz
Derickson 'Ol said that, "The process has been managed
well, in quintessential Swarthmore fashion."

Friends Historical Library receives donation from alum
The library obtains a valuable set of suffragist papers as well as exposure on PBS

BY SARAH PETERSON
spetersl@swarthmore.edu
Through a generous in-kind donation from a
Swarthmore alumna, the Friends Historical Library has
acquired a significant number of letters, journals and
family papers once belonging to Mariana Wright
Chapman, an influential New York suffragist and
women's rights advocate. Chapman was the president of
the New York State Suffrage association in the 1890's, and
the letters within the Chapman Collection include her
correspondence with such high-profile figures in the
women's rights movement as Elizabeth Cady Stanton

and Susan B. Anthony.
While the news of the acquisition was released on the
college website in more recent weeks, the documents
including several thousand letters
arrived at the FHL
during the fall and spring semesters of last year, according to FHL curator Christopher Densmore.
The donation came from Anne Chapman Booth '32, a
Swarthmore alumna and Chapman's granddaughter.
Booth passed away last fall, but she and her daughter
Mary Doty arranged for the donation before that time,
believing that the FHL would be an appropriate place for
her grandmother's papers.
Since their arrival, the documents have been

processed and catalogued. Excerpts from the collection
can be viewed on the college Web site, through the News
and FHL pages.
The FHL was encouraged to put the catalog online by
the fact that many were interested in the documents.
"Because of the interest in the materials, we organized it
fairly quickly," Densmore said.
While the famous woman's very signatures make

even the shortest letters worth thousands of dollars each,
Densmore explains that much of the collection's value
lies in understanding how much organizing and planning went on behind the scenes of the suffragist movement.

"These were the people that made things happen.
They're not necessarily public figures. Mariana
Chapman is not somebody who gets into the history
books as being the Stanton or the Anthony," Densmore
said. "But Stanton and Anthony can be these public figures because there is a body of people that are doing the
grassroots organization. They're making it possible for
the bigger names to speak. They're organizing lecture
tours, they're making sure people have a place to stay,
they're doing the lobbying, the letter-writing."
It's not immediately clear how the letters of a suffragist fit within the mission of the FHL to preserve and
record Quaker history, but Densmore explained that the
connection between the new collection and the Quaker
community is quite strong.
Chapman, herself Quaker, was in touch with a number of other Quaker activists like herself, such as abolitionists.

Some of the papers involve correspondence with and
abolitionist Aaron Powell, whose sister was Elizabeth Powell Bond
a former dean of
speeches given by

Swarthmore who was involved in the anti-slavery movement as a young woman.
"In [Chapman's] role as president of the New York
State Suffrage Association, that's not a specifically
Quaker activity. But she is a Quaker, she's involved with
a lot of other people who are Quakers," Densmore said.
"Susan B. Anthony was a Quaker; a number of these people had connections both with the Society of Friends and
Swarthmore College
If it had just been a women's
rights collection without a Quaker context, we wouldn't
have taken it."
Densmore went on to explain that without the papers'
particular Quaker context and relationship to the college, he might have recommended that they be given to
the Schlesinger library at Radcliffe, or to the Smith collection.
...

"

"[Friends Historical Library is] like a
little jewel within the larger building
of McCabe, so anytime that they
have the chance to really show off
how much there is, I'm all about it."
Alisa Giardinelli
Associate Director of News and
Communications
"There are many things that are worthwhile having,
but to have something that is out of context is not helpful to scholarship," Densmore said.
The match was not only appropriate on a scholarly
basis, but also on a personal one. Several members of
Booth's family attended Swarthmore, according to
Director of Development Stephen Bayer who first met
Booth several years ago.
According to Bayer, Booth was very interested in the
college. "I showed her the [Meaning of Swarthmore] campaign video, when we were launching the campaign,"
Bayer continued. "She was almost in tears watching it."
Booth attended the launch of the campaign, and was a
regular donor to the college well before donating the
Chapman Collection.
"In my seven years of travels and meeting with alumni, she was one of my favorite alums. She was wonderfully sweet and so interested in what was happening here
at the college. This gift is a fitting tribute to her legacy,"
Bayer said.
The FHL received more media exposure Monday, Aug.
27, when an episode of PBS' "History Detectives" aired
featuring an interview with Densmore.
The show begins each episode by taking an object or
document of uncertain significance, then talks to historians and experts to uncover its meaning and historical
importance.

For the episode featuring Densmore, the object in
question was a manuscript map bought at a yard sale.
The map's new owner wondered if the markings on the
map possibly denoted a map of the Underground

Railroad.

The show's producers' research led them to Densmore
and the FHL.
Both Densmore and Alisa Giardinelli from the News
and Information Office saw the show as a great opportunity not only to assist in interesting research, but aj[so to
give the FHL some publicity.
< "The Friend's Library is so great. There's so much
there. It's like a little hidden jewel within the larger
building of McCabe, so anytime that they have the
chance to really show off how much there is, I'm all
about it," said Giardinelli, who publicized the episode
prior to its airing.
"In a way it's just another type of research that we
engage in," Densmore said. "We did make the decision
that it was probably worth working with them simply on
the basis that this will get information about Quaker history and specifically on Swarthmore College out to a
broader audience
It's going to be 20 minutes that's,
...

going to reach an audience."
During his interview on the show, Densmore was able
to explain that the map was not likely linked to
Underground Railroad activity.
"A road map out of your car wouldn't say that you're
planning to go to Atlantic City. And even if it does say
that you're planning to go to Atlantic City, it doesn't say
if you're going there to organize the workers or gamble,"

Densmore said.
However, Densmore did compare the found map to a
similar one belonging to the FHL collection in order to
explain that the manuscript map did reflect a certain
kind of anti-slavery activity.
The map was likely drawn for the benefit of' Quaker
settlers moving north from North Carolina, where their

beliefs against slavery had made their lives uncomfortable and difficult.
The map, Densmore explained, "is connected with an
antislavery story in the sense that there are people moving in to this area to get away from slavery, the Quakers
in this are anti-slavery, there's a lot of Underground
Railroad activity in this area, there are a lot offree black
communities that are tied to the Quaker communities.
So there are all these associations."
Densmore also added that in the process of turning
the episode from unvarnished research into an entertaining story, History Detectives ended up shooting historical reenactment footage in the Swarthmore area.
According to Densmore, the footage was shot close to
campus. "There will be scenes [in the episode] of a fugitive slave escaping through the snow. It's the Crum
woods, or somewhere around here," Densmore said.
The show will likely air again sometime later this
year on the PBS channel.
Students who are interested in finding more information can find the transcript of the show at the History
Detectives website.

Trash 2 Treasure plans a second sale for next spring
BY MELISSA CRUZ

mcruzl@swarthmore.edu

Due to the success of last year's first
ever Trash 2 Treasure sale, the Trash 2
Treasure team plans to hold a second sale
next spring.

At the end of last semester, students,
staff and even some volunteers from the
community came together to organize and
sell items that were donated or left in col-

lege dorms.

Volunteers sorted and priced items
ranging from clothes to children's toys, as
well as dry erase boards, stuffed animals,
books, countless laundry detergent bottles and furniture. The sale, which was
held in the Lamb-Miller Field House, netted more than $12,000. The money was
raised in order to benefit Chester Eastside

THE PHOENIX

ministries and the Chester Education
fund.
After sorting the donations, volunteers
priced items at cheap rates for their sale.
For example, a full-size futon sold for
about $2O, a typical dorm butterfly-style
chair, $5, and refrigerators were sold at
anywhere from $5 to $2O. Marina
Isakowitz 'O9, who partnered with Juliana
Macri 'O9 to head the project, said minifridges proved to be the most popular
item.
"Over 45 mini-fridges sold out in the
first thirty minutes of the sale," Isakowitz
...

Welcoming Ramadan

cartoon

BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

In Arabic, Ramadan means 'intense heat' or 'scorched ground.'
For many Muslim students at Swarthmore, it also means 30 days
of fasting from dawn until nightfall and spiritual concentration.
Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, begins
today. It is considered the holiest month of the year, during which
the Islamic religious text, the Qur'an, was first revealed. In addition to abstaining from food and drink during the day, Muslims are
encouraged to actively practice their faith. Intense prayer and
charitable actions are meant to foster purification, reflection and
self-control. According to Syeda Tasnim 'O9, the deprivation of
Ramadan also allows people to "experience what the poor might

experience."
The challenges of Ramadan are manifoldfor college students.
Getting up before dawn to eat is considerably harder than trying
to make an 8:30 class. This year in particular, students will have to
survive the brutally humidity and heat wave without drinking
water during the day. Ramadan also provides time to step back
from the party scene and to self-center.

Swarthmore's small but close-knit Muslim Students
Association works to help those observing Ramadan. The MSA is

highly supportive during the month since there are few who are
going through the same experience here. "The last ten days are the
hardest," Sofia Saiyed 'lO said. "It's good to have a support group."
In addition to lending moral support, the MSA provides more
tangible services during Ramadan. Collaborating with Sharpies,
students can pick up bagged breakfasts so that they can eat before
dawn. The MSA also organizes an annual Ramadan dinner, scheduled this year for Sept. 18. The purpose of the annual dinner is to
open the observance of Ramadan to the Swarthmore community.
According to Humzah Soofi 'lO, those who are able to attend will
enjoy

delicious Middle Eastern food,

This year's Ramadan dinner, however, will include a sense of
loss. Paul and Asma Fischer, parents of Tariq Fischer, a deceased

"The [MSA-hosted Ramadan] dinner will
be very rewarding, entertaining and a
great learning experience."
Syeda Tasnim 'lO
member of the Class of 2008, have worked with the MSA and
Tariq's friends to honor the memory of their son. Together, they
are bringing Imam Mohammed Al-Homsi, a family friend of the
Fischers, to Swarthmore for the dinner. According to Tasnim, AlHomsi will lead a discussion "about the significance of Ramadan
historically and spiritually, in an attempt to raise awareness of
this month on campus" and lead a prayer after the meal.
In addition to Al-Homsi, the MSA has succeeded in securing
Baba Ali as another speaker. Ali is known for his "often hilarious
online video blogs in which he discusses practicing Islam and different facets of Muslim life in the States," Soofi said. He will most
likely "be presenting some of these [blog clips] or simply speaking

Overall, despite the apparent hardships, students are content
with observing Ramadan at Swarthmore. Khapalwak, who is originally from Afganistan, had a generally positive experience during
last year's Ramadan. He greatly appreciated the support of his
friends and fellow Muslim students, especially when breaking his
fast at Essie Mae's in good company. Ruhullah Khapalwak 10 did
miss cooking meals to break the fast with his family and visiting
friends over evening tea, both important parts of Ramadan. Yet,
his hectic days at Swarthmore give him an unexpected boost during the holy month: "Here I am busy enough that I don't think
about food."

One man, three wives and one 'Big' show
BY ALEXANDRA ISRAEL

aisraell@swarthnfore.edu
When the HBO show "Big Love" first premiered over
a year ago, it caused quite a stir in my hometown. I come
from Salt Lake City, Utah, the very city in which the
show takes place, and reviews from the locals were very
mixed. Some, like my family and I, found the show fascinating; others objected to the light in which Utah, and
specifically the Mormon Church, was shown. In a city
where polygamy is both an important part of history and
regular front-page news, any show that deals with the
topic is bound to generate strong reactions. What Big
Love succeeds in doing is creating a compelling drama
enacted by sympathetic characters, while at the same
time accurately portraying modern-day polygamist
lifestyles.

["Big Love"] is about polygamy in the
same way that "The Sopranos" was
about the mafia and "Six Feet

sents a community known as "urban polygamists:"
polygamist families who live relatively normal lives in
the city. No one knows exactly what their numbers are,
but the current estimate is that there are several thousand urban polygamists in the greater Salt Lake area,
which is home to a million people total. These kinds of
families are not connected with any particular religious
sect (here I think it's important to note that the Mormon
Church outlawed polygamy over a hundred years ago,
and if a Mormon is found practicing polygamy, they are
excommunicated).

Underbill Library renovations are pleasing to the ear
With the help of the Project Manager

BY JOAN KIM

jkim3@swarthmore.edu
The newly renovated Underbill Library
for Music and Dance, located in the Lang
Music Building, opened on the first day of
classes to the students' and faculty's delight
after a summer of renovations. Although
the renovations have been well received,
many students miss the homey feeling of the
original Underbill, and some are even
thinking about petitioning to bring the purple chairs back into the music library.
The differences are quite striking from
the moment one enters the library. Some
students are already won over by the new
additions to Underbill.
Music major Mark Loria 'OB said,
"Admittedly, I was a little uncertain about
how I felt at first, but I've become a big fan
of the makeover, especially since the colors
suggest a perpetual sense of autumn
I've
already started planning a candlelight dinner in the main study area."
Stepping through the doorway, the modern lighting hanging from the walls illuminates the new earth-tone carpeting, the
brand-new ceilings and everything in

and dance-related books, CDs, films and
scores. Underhill is the haven for many student dancers and musicians to study, socialize or enjoy the wealth of music resources

provided.

The plans for renovations began two
years ago when Donna Fournier entered the
scene as the new Performing Arts
Librarian. Like a "new tenant," as she refers
to herself, "I started dreaming about all the
possibilities." Project Manager Jan Semler
said, "The renovation of Underhill Library
was undertaken with two goals in mind: to
improve functionality and to improve accessibility."

THE PHOENIX

Semler, Library Director Peg Seiden and
input from the faculty and students,
Fournier started to turn dreams into reality.

Students and faculty got to play
Goldilocks when the library held a sit-test
for several chairs being considered to
replace the veteran purple chairs. Comment
cards were available for the students testing
out each chair. Some would have preferred
to keep the original purple chairs that were
famous for being a common napping place.
Alyssa Van Thoen 'OB, said, "Ireally miss
the purple chairs. They were so soft and
comfortable. The orange chairs [that
replaced the purple chairs] are more practical, but we all feel nostalgic for our purple
chairs. They were pretty and so familiar."
Others have learned to adjust. "It's true
that the orange chairs are less comfortable
to sit in, but if you pull up one of these
[wooden chairs] to rest your feet, it's pretty
comfortable to sleep," said Zach Waterfire
10, after waking up from a quick nap. "If I
leaned back to read in the purple chairs, I'd
fall asleep so the orange chairs are better for
staying awake and reading," Waterfire
added.
Amelia Kidd IX who had never seen the
library previous to its renovations said,
"It's a very comfortable and relaxing place
to study. I'm sure I'll use it more as the
semester goes on."

Another factor in the renovations was

staying true to the original design of the
building. Semler said, "One aspect of the
project, which was especially challenging
,was the iconic architecture of the building.
All of us working on the project agreed that
the renovation needed to respect the original design by the noted firm of
Mitchell/Giurgola Associates." Fournier

Marissa Davis 'OB first learned about
Swarthmore College through her older
sister. After a number of visits, she was
convinced that the intimate, yet diverse
environment of the college would provide

her with the opportunities of a lifetime.
"I felt that I could blossom here,"
Davis said, "My time at Swarthmore
showed me paths I had never known
were open to me."
One such path led her to a hurricanestricken New Orleans, where she went on
to orchestrate the construction of a youth
library for an afflicted community. While
she was already involved in various
extracurricular activities during herfirst
two years at Swarthmore, it was in the
area of community service that Davis
really came into her own.
Her dedication to New Orleans began
in her sophomore year with an assignment for Spanish class. "We were asked
to find a news article in Spanish," Davis
recalls.
"Katrina had happened two days [earlier], so I found an article about the aftermath."
Deeply affected by what she read,
Davis decided that she had to help out in
whatever way possible. "I didn't know
what I was doing" she said, "but I knew

Washington.
In her junior year, upon her return
from a semester abroad, Davis was eager
to continue her work in New Orleans. A
transition needed to occur from "immediate response" to a more structured form

ofassistance.
It was then that she remembered
Washington, and eventually decided to
raise money for the Cutoff Community
Center. Living expenses proved to be the
largest difficulty, but Davis was able to
obtain a donation from the Lang Center.
She traveled to New Orleans in 2007
during her Spring Break and presented
the Cutoff Community Center with SIOOO
for various school supplies. The group
also organized afternoon tutoring sessions and Dance and Arts workshops.
Davis, however, remained unsatisfied.
She wanted to do more to create an
enduring bond with the community. As
she turned her attention toward the local
book drives that had been held, Davis
came up with the idea of a youth library.
While she received a Swarthmore
Foundation Grant for her own living
expenses, the funds for the actual library
proceedings came out of her own pocket.
"I was out $700," Davis reminisces,
"But those kids went through a lot, and
were forgotten. I wanted to show them
that someone respected them, and the
bright young men and women they could
become."
Davis had envisioned an efficient and
colorful learning space and worked on

their work. Davis described how the

work on her thesis on Black Culture in

(and sanity) in this endeavor to her

researching for her thesis.

material. "That is what it was all about,
creating a space for parents and children
to spend time with each other,"she said.
After being featured in local newspapers, Davis was inundated with phone
calls inquiring about further donations.
Yet, Davis still considers her job far
from over. Her future goals include raising campus awareness with her new
organization at Swarthmore, NOLARIZE, teaming up with faculty volunteers
for future workshops and creating potential internships in the city. Her fondest
wish, however, is to encourage similar
behavior among her beneficiaries.
"I hope that the library inspires the
members of the community, so that they
can do the same for someone else one
day," Davis said.

The first visit, which took place over

effort. Davis was profoundly moved by
the pathos before her.
"It blew my mind," she said, "These
people had their whole lives ahead of
them and it was all wiped away in an
instant. No one was helping them, and
that hurt my heart." With a renewed

Swarthmore about New Orleans culture.
For the past two years, Davis and others have organized trips to New Orleans during breaks. 17 Swarthmore
students went on the most recent trip last spring break.
Like many others, Davis says she "wanted there to be
some kind of long term plan" to rebuild New Orleans,
besides the short-term relief efforts.
Members of NOLA have helped rebuild the city of New
Orleans by participating in activities such as tutoring students at local community centers. The New Orleans

New Orleans and create interest in NOLA and its efforts.
"NOLA is throwing around the idea of a 'New Orleans
Week' similar to Africa Week,' when we'll teach the
Swarthmore campus about the culture of New Orleans,"
NOLA member John Boucard 10 said.
NOLA also wants to move away from just fundraising
and focus more on the culture of New Orleans. "Raising
money is always a good thing," Mara Phelan 10 said, "but

to achieve the impact we want now we are headed toward
a goal of campus-wide awareness. We want NOLA to have
a domino effect on our campus and surrounding campus-

es as well."

"It's amazing how much people think it's all back to
normal," Phelan said. "I want to get people angry that

These two freshmen are an example of the
recent unparalleled surge in Facebook activity
seen with the Class of 2011, thanks in part to the
fact that, for the first time, the class received
their Swarthmore e-mail accounts before arriving

on campus for Orientation.

Ben Van Zee 'll
Some first-years, such as Ben Van Zee 'll,
had well over 250 Swarthmore Facebook
friends, eclipsing most veteran Swarthmore students, before he even met a single Swattie at
Orientation. The Swarthmore Class of 2011
group has even garnered 304 members.
On the other end of the spectrum, first-year
Jenn Crick 'only" had around 20 Facebook
friends before coming to Swarthmore, made up
of her hallmates and roommate.
"I didn't want Facebook to eat all of my
time," Crick said. "Plus, I think it's weird to talk
to someone from Facebook and say you know
them when you haven't really met face to face."
So what happens when Facebook lets people
take cracks at the ice before they even have to
break it?

Signing in
The Facebook fervor is inevitably affecting
freshmen interactions, as demonstrated by
Egawa and Hall, including various online relationships that have cropped up. In the world of
Facebook, friendships are made with a click of a
mouse. But do "bffs" online actually translate
into best friends in real life?
Some people like Hall and Egawa hit it off
immediately, while others like Van Zee have not
really felt the impact of prolific Facebook
friendships.
"I consider Facebook more like virtual
acquaintances than friends," Van Zee said. "I
meet them on Facebook just to get an idea of
who they are. For me, it doesn't really matter if
the friendships continue."
For Van Zee, crucial factors for friendships
such as "body language, body chemistry, just
being around each other can't be done online."
Kate Aizpuru 10 also had "quite a few"
Facebook friends before she came to Swat last
fall. She admitted that at times, it could be awkward when she thought she "was going to be
super tight with someone and then never ended
up talking to them."
"The people I'm closest friends with now are
people I met once I got on campus. Partially it
was just who I lived with, but also people are

THE PHOENIX

with online friends.
"If we didn't have Facebook, conversations
would be awkward like, 'Hey, why'd you come
to Swat?'" Hall said. Instead, Hall and Egawa
are more likely to have happy reunions with
Facebook friends.
"It was really helpful to me when I got here
to kind of have an idea of who I was going to
meet, and to have people to say hi to and sit with
in Sharpies those first few days," Aizpuru said.
Even with minimal Facebook usage, Crick
said that Facebook "speeds up friendships."
"If you meet someone in passing, you can
talk to them more on Facebook and build friendships that way, when you might not have been
able to talk to them again," Crick said.
More than just a social network, Facebook
also has become a tool for many prospective students deciding on colleges. Thanks to Facebook
group events, meetings between alumni, students and prospective students have been held
all across the country and in Egawa's case, even
on her recent trip to Turkey.
The darker side ofFacebook
Whatever the benefits of Facebook, the constant surveillance that Facebook "facilitates can
be stressful. With the Facebook Mini-Feed introduced last year, actions such as posting a comment or a photo can be tracked by someone in
your network. Posted profile information meant
for friends such as cell phone numbers could
potentially fall into the wrong hands.
"If we make one comment, because we're

■

Behind the 'Wall'
Facebook can also be a relieffor people who |
are more socially introverted to establish rela- I
tionships ahead of time. As Hall put it, "the ice I
has already been broken for you."
The paradox of the Facebook community is
that while it may be a relief for shy individuals,
it is also allowing people to become bolder in
terms of defining who they are in their interactions with others.
For Hall, the opportunity to declare who you
are in profile categories, unchallenged,,ranging
from political views to sexual preference
'allows people to break down certain barriers
and be open about themselves, whether it is
their sexuality or their religion or politics."
Kirk agrees that it's beneficial that "people
know what to expect and they know not to be
inadvertently offensive."
The Future ofFacebook

According to a recent Aug. 12 Newsweek
article, "Facebook Grows Up," more than half of
Facebook's 35 million users are not college students and it is predicted that less than 30 percent of users will be in a college network at
year's end.

really have to watch what we do, what we say,
or what we post," Egawa said.
"It can be scary because you don't know
what people are saying about you," Hall said.
"I'm on all the time. I have to know what people
are saying about me."
Egawa takes a different approach, saying,
"I'm a little too busy to Facebook-stalk everything that has my name on it. I can't stop what
other people say about me, or post about me."
But growing a tougher skin may not be
enough protection in the online community.
During the summer, a student allegedly began
posing as an accepted Swarthmore 2011 student.
Later, it was revealed that she had never even
been admitted. However, Egawa actually sees
the incident as an indication of the cohesiveness of the Facebook community.
"With one person getting suspicious, the rest
of us weeded her out. It helps that we can, in a
sense, look into each other's business but look
out for each other," Egawa said.

This is widely resisted by college students
who feel Facebook could become another
MySpace. Unless you place a strict privacy setting, strangers and parents could gain access to
photos or information users want to keep private.
Van Zee predicts the phenomenon will
become a victim of its own success. Even now,
he complains Facebook "is a little bit too main-

stream."

"Facebook is just getting more popular
because
it gives the impression that it is
more secure. That will probably change now
that it's been made public," Kirk said.
...

Logging Off

All three agree that despite the initial connections that Facebook can provide, nothing
replaces meeting someone in person.
"Often, it's, 'Wow, you're so much better in
person than online,'" Egawa said. "Text doesn't
have inflection so it can be tough to see if
they're being facetious or not, joking or not."
Whatever the costs, none of the freshmen
seem to regret being so intensely Facebook
friendly.

"Facebook isn't perfect, but it's been worth
the risks since I've met a lot of great people and
it's broken the ice so easily, so many times,"
Hall said.

While I do enjoy

spectacles
at
times, I can't
help but be reminded of how much of this is just a business tactic built up through runways, photographers and

media blitzkriegs (according to the media blog Jossip,
727 of this September's Vogue's 850 pages are ads) to elevate trends to an almost divine status.
Furthermore, I get a slight sense of deja-vu when
viewing these trends. No doubt the plethora of plumage
harkens back to my Big Bird days. But the bright colors
and metallic sheens remind me of the fluorescent yet
indifferent types whose photos get snapped nightly and
posted on sites like thecobrasnake and lastnightsparty.
Because, really, designers are influenced by everyday
life just as much as the vice versa is true; inspiration
from the streets gets picked up, rethought, repackaged
and resold at a much higher price. To illustrate this in

concrete terms, the Keffiyeh, the traditional headdress of

Arab men which for a number of years became the neckwear of people wishing to express solidarity with
Palestinians, began spreading in popularity among
Europe's counter-culture youth and was last year picked
up by Urban Outfitters, only to be renamed the "anti-war
scarf." Most recently, I spotted the Keffiyeh in a fashion
spread in the New York Times' Women's Fashion Fall
2007 magazine, flooding the neck of a puppet-string-posed
Cecilia Mendez and accredited to Junya Watanabe, a

Japanese designer of Commes des Garcon fame.

Designers are influenced by everyday life just as much as the vice
versa is true; inspiration from the
streets gets picked up, repackaged
and resold at a much higher price.
An instance like this underscores the bottom-up
nature of fashion that is too often taken for granted

because of movies like "The Devil Wears Prada," which
presents fashion in all its forms as something ruled over
by a strictly elite oligarchy. The case of the Keffiyeh also
shows the degree to which thought and conscious decision-making tend to become distilled out of many people's sartorial choices when they blindly fall prey to
trends.
This is not to say that trends are a bad thing, but they
should be adopted in a way that makes sense for an individual's body and mind. I'm particularly keen on the
masculine tailoring that is popular for women this season because to me, a successfully executed androgynous

look (for both men and women) oozes confidence and sex

appeal.

I'm also intrigued by many of the
more matronly silhouettes that I've
seen. They're conservative in one
sense, but utterly subversive in another, if you think about the effect that
Hollywood yo-yos like Paris and
Lindsay are having on the hemlines and midriffs of young women
everywhere.
Ironically, I find great personal
style inspiration in the anti-fash-

of
rocker/performance artist Andrew
W.K., whose original choice of
wearing a white t-shirt and white
jeans during performances, so as
to appear a tabula rasa for his

trademark.
Not only does he not have to worry

Philly Fringe Festival showcases experimental theater
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

On the SEPTA to Philly on a Friday
night, you can always find a small crowd
with enough spare change to embark on this
brave voyage beyond the Swarthmore bubble. Some Swatties are hunting for Korean
food, others checking out art galleries for
First Friday. I find myself heading to
Signatures Salon, a "progressive hair salon"
complete with vaguely hip pop art of
Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein and a
histrionic beauty consultant with scary
make-up who does not wait long to tell us,
"Being beautiful was something of a mountain to climb as I am a product of incest."
Alas, I'm not here for a beauty consultation. I am here to see "An'tisalon," a modernday extension of Sophocles's Antigone that

is one of the thousands of theater and dance
performances taking place during Philly's
Live Arts and Fringe Festival. Now in its
eleventh year, the Fringe Festival originally
anodeled itself after other alternative performing arts festivals, such as the
Edinburgh Fringe Festival. These festivals
strive to push the boundaries of theater and
shake viewers away from the passive mainstream. But, unlike other metropolitan centers, Philadelphia hardly has a mainstream
to fringe away from. The director of
"An'tisalon" Ryder Thornton tells me the
festival is "important to small theater companies because it helps them build and gives
them publicity."
"An'tisalon" is a production of Kaibatsu,
a theater company with the kind of unique
style of theater staging that the festival is
known for. Their emphasis is on performances that take place at a site wholly
detached from theater. By working with the
of the space and interacting
with the audience, Kaibatsu hopes to create

14

a more engrossing theater experience.
In the case of "An'tisalon," the site
specifics have a surreal effect. The play is
clearly not meant to be taken literally.
Ismene (Macah Coates) is the loony beauty
consultant who wants not only to impart
some skincare tips to her audience, but also

to revive her martyred sister Antigone
(Chanelle Benz). Soon, what is intended to be
a beauty consultation becomes a fight
between two opposing worldviews.
The audience of no more than 20 people
sits mere feet away from the two sisters and
follows them as the play moves through dif-

ferent rooms of the' salon. The intimacy
between performer and viewer makes for
both a greater engagement with the characters and a heightened awareness of the
absurdity and theatricality of the play. It is
thrilling to hearthe actors bellow out monologues without the usual barrier between
cast and audience, or to step foot on the same
floor where the performance is taking place.
Yet, the closeness makes it all the more
apparent that these are characters whom
we've antiseptically come to know from high
school English, not actual people that are
giving each other facials. Some lines are just
painful to the ears, like Antigone's accusation of Ismene: "You're sacrificing yourself
at an altar of denial." The belabored effort to
incorporate audience participation borders
on cheese when Ismene proclaims, "Once
you have your color, you have beauty. And
once you have beauty, you have power. I am
here to empower you with your beauty," and
then promptly gives a few audience members scarves that designate their particular
"color."
All of this talk of beauty would be easier
to swallow if there were a clearer connection
between "An'tisalon" and its source material. As the play stands, however, it trivializes
any relevance "Antigone" may have to

"Antigone" gets a makeover in the daring play "An'tisalon" at the Philly Fringe Festival.

world, using only its premise to ask
no-hum meta-questions, like "what is it like
to be a minor character in a play?" and to
obtusely discuss the nature of beauty.
(Shock: it's more than skin deep.) Its interpretation of free will and fate, though pretty
half-bSked, is thought-provoking in the contoday's

text of the play's forte the rivalry between
the two sisters, one of whom needs to believe
that she can change her outward appearance
and another who is content to be herself. It is

September 13, 2007

a credit to the actors that we feel genuine
friction between these two paper-thin characters. "An'tisalon" might just have worked
better if it had ditched its palimpsest aspirations.
The festival is full of experiments, such
as "An'tisalon," that turn out for better or for
worse. The Philly's Live Arts and Fringe
Festival ends its run this weekend. You can

In praise of privilege My Friday night sights
And if we, the favored sons of fortune, do
not revel, if we spurn luck (who has been so
generous), then we make a mockery of life. If
we are not at least happy, if we no longer have
that Germanic wisdom to know that to be
lucky is to be happy, do we not then spoil the
hopes and dreams of the Earth? What then
should the oppressed struggle for, if privilege
brings no joy? All is in vain and life a cheat. If
we, with our multitude of opportunities, can
find none to validate existence if we cannot
be easily justified in our content then how
can any hope to live?
All are confronted with the problem of life.
Those, like us, who possess great privilege,
face the problem starkly, for we bear more
responsibility for our life; we live life more
than others. On us, then, falls fully the burden
of justifying life. We have ample opportunity to
sample her wares, to taste and to judge. We pronounce sentence on life. If we are not happy
and can find no pleasing flavor, then all those
who lie beneath us must moan in terror. If we
eat what is richest and are not satisfied, then
those below must retch on our leavings.
We must proudly be as we are. Say not mid-

What is Delicious?
Today we raise a call for all good men to
arm themselves in defense of privilege. Those
who would turn your backs on it ultimately
fail: for the act of renunciation, the choice of
abstention is wholly different from the incidental and unwanted absence of a thing.

Laying down privilege is exercising it, denying
it is affirming, as intentional action itself is
privilege in its purest form.
Even were you to lay down wealth and
power, in an attempt to join the worms of the
Earth, always there would be the division that
you had chosen this life, while it chose them.
And so all of your misfortune would return to
nest upon you, while they are scourged by fate;
or much more likely, your peers.
We students here are privileged. This is
true in obvious comparison with our brethren;
one need only look out the arrow slits of the
Citadel (McCabe) and survey our domain.
To those who would see privilege over-

thrown, I beg of you, do not pronounce this sentence on mankind! Catholics know well the
worth of man, born in sin. Remember that
Jesus is life everlasting, while sin earns death.
Then think on Ephesians 2:8: "For it is by grace
you have been saved, through faith
and this
is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."
Let me be the first to deny the truth of
Christianity, but also the first to affirm the
message here: that life comes to us wholly
undeserved and through no virtue of our own.
Fundamentally, there is one privilege: life. The
economic and social power that are more com-

monly recognized as privilege are in fact raw
potentiality.

dle class when you mean upper, and say it
unashamed and with a smile. Those who take
discomfort at our unearned privilege, remember Nietzsche's epigram: "To be ashamed of
one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the
end of which one is ashamed also of one's
morality." When we, as guests, are offered a
dinner, what is done? Do we spurn generosity
insisting that we are unworthy? To do so
would insult the wisdom of our host for welcoming us. Do we accept, but shamefully so,
and so shame our host with an unhappy guest?
No! We eat our fill, gladly so, and compliment
our host. This is how we must live. Eating our
in joy, in the
fill, gladly so, and praising life
taste of delicious and with our words.
It is true that we eat to excess while others
starve. But somewhere there must be someone
happy. If only here, after a pint of honey mixed
with vodka, we can make peace with our gift,
then at least we will provide to all men hope
that such peace can be reached. Swarthmore
offers a greater (the greatest) privilege: unfettered access to millennia of cultural production and near unending hours of leisure with
which to consume it. Isn't that delicious?

BY RORY SYKES
rsykesl@swarthmore.edu
Growing up in Chicago fostered
within me a deep appreciation for the
anonymity of large, public spaces. In
cities, you brush up against people, you
overhear their conversations, you
inhale them ... and yet you never have
to acknowledge them. Unlike the awkward "do-I-or-don't-I-say-Hi" situations
in which
on Swarthmore's campus
there is no safe interaction default
when three years later you pass by that
kid from your first year seminar (Is it
creepy that I still remember you?)
navigating urban spaces necessitates
the affectation of cool indifference to all
those you pass.
It is this code of obliviousness that
allows one (okay, me) to people-watch
on the sly and not be dragged into an

exchange of mundanities in order to
uphold the social etiquette of polite

response. On the off chance an attempt
at conversation is made, a disdainful
stare and slight shift in body language
is usually enough to shut down said
attempt. I revel in this freedom to
observe without threat of interpersonal
engagement; it's comfortable, it's
thrilling, it's endlessly entertaining.
But sadly, it's an experience to which
Swarthmore's uncomfortably close
environment denies me access. And
that is why I go to the art museum.
Philadelphia's Museum of Art is
nothing compared to the Art Institute of
Chicago, but it serves its purpose. More
than simply a central location for people who are looking to congregate, the
PMA encourages alternative modes of
sharing space with strangers through
its "Art After 5" program. Every Friday,
the PMA entices people to mingle
amongst its works as the museum
extends its hours and plays host to a
musical performance ("international"
or jazz) in the Great Stair Hall. It also
doesn't hurt that they set up a bar.
Without fail, the space fills up with people (many of whom trot out their art-

viewing best and contribute their bodies as a site for sight) and quickly

becomes abuzz with

delicately

sloshed

drinks and murmured musings on art,
life and love. Oh man, is it great.
It is the experience of being amongst
a crowd (a jostling, tipsy and elegantly
exhibitionistic crowd) that is engaging
with art both visually and aurally that I
intend to capture in this column.

There's something magical (yes, magical) about the way that certain open,
cultural spaces act as catalysts in transforming how people exist, both individually and in relation to each other. It is
this quality that I hope to capture. So
here is a sampling of observed individuals and interactions as an introduction
to my "Art After 5" adventures:
The man who took his obliviousness to my presence so seriously that
he, had I not moved it in time, would
have sat directly upon my gin and tonic.
A true lesson in dedication to the art of
affected indifference to any and all
around you.
The failed French sexologist (currently American medical student) who
attempted to hit on me. Said attempt
also failed. But I did have to smile when
he made explicit the connection
between Paris, wine and romance—way
to enact cultural stereotypes in pursuit
of amorous advantage.
The three.art professors sitting just
above and behind me this past Friday,
discussing the students in their classes.
Never had I known such a capacity for
gossip existed outside the realm of middle school.
The late middle-aged couple with a
clear desire to be seen. The woman,
impeccably dressed; the man, shirt
unbuttoned so as to halfway expose his
grey-haired chest. I'd be lying if I didn't
-

admit it was more impressive than
some of the works formally on display.
And so, these types of personal fasci-

nations will serve as background to my
more thematically focused future reflections on the sort of exchanges and relationships activated by the incubating
space of an art museum open after
hours. I encourage you all to experience
it firsthand but on the condition, of
course, that should we cross paths, our
eyes need not meet. Here's to unabashed
voyeurism.

Talib Kweli brings both questions and answers to your 'Eardrum'
BY NICK GAW
ngawl@swarthmore.edu

"What becomes of a dream deferred, that never makes it
to the world to be seen or heard?" asks Talib Kweli at the
beginning of his latest album, "Eardrum." Released Aug. 21,
"Eardrum" asks many questions. Kweli responds to some,
but leaves many unanswered. After a few times through, the
record left me asking myself one big question: why I haven't
been listening to Kweli's old work since "The Beautiful
Struggle" (2004)? "Eardrum" has that rare ability to be an
addictive new record that also energizes the entire canon of

Kweli's work. Put simply, "Eardrum" fails to disappoint.
"Eardrum" is released on Blacksmith Records, Kweli's
independent label that he heads with Corey Smyth. Kweli's
labelmates, Jean Grae and Strong Arm Steady, appear on the
record to great success. In fact, "Eardrum" is full of guest
appearances
most notably Kanye West, Will.l.Am and the
unfailing Justin Timberlake. Alas, Kanye's appearance, on
"In the Mood," is one of the weaker parts of the album,
though his flow does feature one of "Eardrum"'s two
MichaelRichards references. That has got to count for something. Some of the cutest guest stars are Kweli's children
Amani Fela and Diani Eshe, who perform a rap written by
Amani before the track, "Oh My Stars." Hopefully we can
look forward to a full length from these tiny tots soon. Kweli
fans will also note the influence of long-time partner Madlib,
who produces several tracks with a Midas touch.

THE PHOENIX

In traditional Kweli fashion, "Eardrum" features more
standout tracks than duds. "Eat to Live" begins by reminding us of the tough decisions being made in poor urban communities each day, a "ghetto prayer" for undernourished
children. After the first verse, Kweli broadens his message;
he is "watch[ing] what the media feeds you" while empha-

sizing the importance of spiritual fulfillment. Ultimately,
Kweli shows his hope for a new generation. Certainly he has
his two children in mind: "In order to receive, then we need
to give. We got to feed the kids, they got to eat to live."
"Give 'Em Hell" is a narrative of Kweli's religious
upbringing. The song features a healthy dose of skepticism
paired with a jeremiad chorus, sung by a gospel choir. Kweli
focuses his confusion on religious conflict, and emphasizes
his critical "spiritual" worldview: "Just because the Lord is
my shepherd don't mean I gotta be no sheep."
Like many of his album tracks, "More or Less" is Kweli's
vision of a better world. Focusing on hip-hop's intersection
with American society, Kweli prescribes more and less of
everything from "community activism" (more) to "Britney"
(less). Kweli advises "more rap songs that stress purpose
with less misogyny and less curses/ Let's put more depth in
our verses." That is something about which we can all agree.
On the next track, "Stay Around," Kweli jumpsright into
a super-catchy hook that he sings himself. The track speaks
to the current state of hip-hop, explaining Kweli's personal
philosophy of composition, which involves lyrics that paint
"portraits that make the average exotic." This is just one
September 13, 2007

case in which Kweli's upbringing, specifically his father's
influence as a sociology professor, really gets to come
through.

After a string of such perfected and insightful tracks,
"Eardrum" falters. "Hot Thing," produced by and featuring
Will.l.Am, is certainly weak. Will.l.Am's hook
lacks the intelligence found throughout the
album. Though perhaps commercially
viable, this is not a collaboration
that I can get behind. What I
can get behind, in a big way, is
the album's last track. "The
Nature" featuring Justin
Timberlake, who gave Kweli
the song's beat and hook and let
him run with it. Kweli definitely made it happen. This track
is anathematic, leading the
listener through stripped
down verses, eventually cul
minating in a funkinspired outro. This is one
H
you have got to hear.
"Eardrum" is a really good
album. Talib Kweli is a really talented
musician. With some great guest
artists and incredible producers, it
would be hard to go too far astray.

Thinking outside the... The swim test in review

YOSHI JOHNSON
Yo, It's Not That Deep
You can have your lens, but you can forget
about my box.
Matriculating at

sonal filter according to our varied and
diverse backgrounds
is a good one.
Sitting down to write this first column
this time, I was hoping to write on class in
I started worrying
Admissions decisions
about my audience and this basic idea: how
would Swarthmore read my columns? What
kinds of lenses were out there, and how could
I possibly anticipate how all of them would
process what I had to say? This frantic inner
turmoil sprang from the same species as the
classic dilemma, "What do people think of
me?" and so it naturally evolved into a confounding maze of agonizing possibilities.
Before I knew what had hit me, my inner
tumult over how to write this column was
leading me head-on into the throes of an existential crisis. Business as usual for the overly
reflective brand of student we like to call
Swattie, I suppose.
Eventually, of course, I ignored my Swattie
inclinations and took a deep breath: Hold up
it's not that serious, yo! And really, it isn't.
I'm writing an opinions column, so that gives
me license to be as stupid as I want in saying
whatever I want, am I right?

At Swarthmore, we quickly
zero in on the words "queer,"
"heteronormative," and
"male privilege."
Still, with a lone, blinking cursor taunting
me by the second and my screen still a vast
expanse of empty white, a real dilemma
loomed. I might not have cared what people
thought about what I had to say, at least not for
my own sake, but I still had to care about the
implications of my words for others.
Give people a few clues about yourself, or
position yourself just right on a few controversial issues, and the sorting hat in our minds
will go to work. We all have to break the world
down into more manageable parts, sort it out a
bit to process it functionally and get on with
our lives' endeavors, and sometimes that
involves thinking a little more rigidly and simply about things than the complexities of the
world require. That is £o say, we sometimes

a liberal arts college like

Swarthmore, we all invariably stumble upon
the concept of a "lens" in our time here. Here,
you're almost guaranteed to come upon the
phrase, "...examine it through the lens 0f..."
and while not all of us buy into the discourse
of lenses, at least not fully, the basic idea

tend to think in boxes, especially living on a
college campus. So sure, I could forget about
y'all and your lenses, but I still had to worry
about others being guilty by association; I still
had to worry about the boxes I'd get put in.
But what happened to it's not that serious,
you ask? Well, it isn't for me, but I claim membership to various communities, in my life
here and elsewhere, and on top of that, people
may associate me with whole groups of people
anyway. Take, as an example, the people of
color who have chosen to write for The
Phoenix on issues relating to their communities: first and foremost, readers can't help but
notice the picture featured prominently atop
their column. Depending on the melanin levels they can gauge from a picture, many stu-

Well It isn't [that serious] for
me, but I claim membership
to various communities, in
my life here and elsewhere.
And sure, a picture doesn't always furnish
the necessary clues for flagging a piece as a

"diversity piece" (i.e. the writer is lacking in
the melanin department, comme moi), so
sometimes we have to skim a little more. At
Swarthmore, though, we quickly zero in on the
words "queer," "heteronormative" and "male
privilege" and bingo! Houston, we have a lesbian! Or we might eventually pick up on
enough instances of "class," "privilege,"
"wealthy" and "moral imperative" to glean
that we're reading the complaints of some
lower-class bloke bent out of shape about class
disparities
or, more appropriately for
Swarthmore, the inner workings of some überprogressive rich kid's guilty conscience.
For most people, a statement made by
George W Bush does not necessarily invite
some larger inductive conclusion about the
views of whole groups of people, at least not
beyond an easily identifiable cadre of his
cronies. Usually, white men, Christians,
wealthy individuals and even Republicans
need not tremble with fear every time the man
(Unless you're
mouth.
opens his
on
Swarthmore's campus, of course, in which

case some of those constituencies just tremble

away regardless.)
In the case of Al Sharpton, on the other
hand, his words and views sometimes come to
encompass the entirety of a diverse and plu-

ralistic American black community. Granted,
I'm not saying that this erroneous association
is always in play, but he has undoubtedly
shaped a public perception (or portrayal?) of
black America, and not always for the better.
Having inked out this journal-style column
instead of something more pointed, I suppose
all I am asking is that my audience engage my
columns thoughtfully this semester. And even
if I could evade the boxes and "just be me and
me alone"
and I can't, because that's just life
I'd rather be a George W. Bush than an Al
Sharpton, anyway. (Not to think in boxes or
anything.) If anyone has to suffer the carnage
caused by my rants, then I'd just as soon have
people box up me with the likes of loopy, inept
buffoons like Mr. Bush than with whole groups
of innocent bystanders.

September 2, 2007.

■

One of the more
interesting aspects
of the story told of the origins of the
swim test in World War I-era beliefs

that a gentleman should know was
how not to get himself drowned.
Very Teddy (as in Roosevelt). Of
course, schools like Bryn Mawr
College and Swarthmore College
adopted the swim test for all their students too, so apparently young ladies
were understood to be worthy of saving themselves as well.
I was distressed to learn from the
article, though, that the natatorial
graduation test for the Swarthmore
fighting Quakers —or the Phoenixi
(Phoenixuses?) or whatever it is we
call our sports mascot and ourselves
these days—has been much outmacho'd by the swim test at the West
Point

Military

Academy,

which

trains male and female officers for
the United States Army. Their swim
test involves a deep wading pool, a
wave-generating device, strobe lights
cutting through in the dark, a smoke
machine, heavy metal music pounding over loudspeakers and other
amenities. Oh, I also forgot to mention that the cadets have to negotiate
the waves in full battle regalia, holding rifles above their heads. Sort of
like combat, I guess, or at least a
movie set.
Seems to me that the difficulty
level of Swarthmore's swim test
should be raised a bit, so that we
don't come across as quite so
Quakerly-wimpy. True, Swarthmore
requires its students to swim in

water above their heads, unlike the
Army. And perhaps it's okay to let
our Swatties continue to wear civilian swim suits. But perhaps adding
strobe lights and really grating music
would make our swim test more of a
real challenge. It might raise our U.S..
News
World Report rating, too.
Ozzy Osbourne's "Walk on Water,"
though not strictly speaking heavy
metal, might be thematically appropriate to blare over the Ware Pool
And Oz's "song" is
loudspeakers.
some of the worst music ever created—thus, it will be soul- and bodytoughening for our aquatic undergraduates, especially if repeated nonstop for 15 minutes.
Following Swarthmore traditions,
a committee should probably be
formed to study the question of the
proper swim test format. Should the
College keep the swim test status quo,
or courageously up the ante? What
are the reasons, anyway, for singling
out one sport, swimming, or rather
floating, as necessary for graduation—as opposed to a graduation
requirement that shows students how
regular exercise in'any sport you
enjoy may give you fitness for life?
While the committee is, um, floating such questions, it might also
want to consider instituting a phys ed
requirement for faculty. Faculty
need to be fit enough to make it
through the long-distance run known
as the Swarthmore semester and the
grading that comes after. But if faculty members are required to take a
swim test too, especially if it's in our
regalia, those black professorial'
gowns, please don't force us to listen
to Ozzy Osbourne, or Aerosmith's
"Walk on Water" either, despite its
immortal lyrics. We respectfully
&

request instead the more demure
"Water Music" by George Frideric
Handel, and the use of the shallow

end of the pool.

Forced fitness
The administration's new
phys. Ed requirements
hurt more than they help
While the physical education requirement might have once seemed like a
laughable matter, the administration is
making a big change that proves the issue
is serious. Now that junior housing and
pre-enrollment are in jeopardy without
completion of the PE requirement by the
end of sophomore year, the class of 2011
and beyond will be forced to get moving
literally
very early on. Although this
decision might positively affect the student body in some ways, it does so with
huge costs.
It is a well-known fact that obesity,
including childhood obesity, is on the rise
in America. Therefore, it makes sense
that Swarthmore look out for its students
by putting emphasis on exercise in the
first two years of college, when the stress
of higher education and freedom from
parental supervision could negatively
affect eating habits. It is smart of the
administration to push its students to
maintain healthy lifestyles amidst hours
of sitting and tackling its decidedly
intense academics
even if gaining the
Freshman 15 may by no means mean
becoming obese. Yet, if the concern is simply helping its students live healthily,
then it makes little sense that the college
is not instead enforcing physical education requirements throughout a student's
four years of college.
Perhaps another consideration is
assisting

lowerclassmen with time sched-

uling
both in the short and long term.
By putting limits on their future years,
the college might be prodding first-years
and sophomores to finish their physical
education requirements before scheduling

conflicts with honors seminars or

study abroad programs could occur. If
this is the case, it is unclear why the physical education requirement holds prece-

dent over any of the other distribution

requirements imposed on Swarthmore
students. Just like a physical education

class could take up the time needed for an
upper-level course or seminar, so could
the stress of piling on additional classes to
fill the academic distribution requirements if they have not already been completed. Also, these classes could interfere
with course experimentation as students
try to choose a major. Why focus solely on
athletics?
Then there is the problem of severity:
it is clear that the administration feels the

need to emphasize the importance of the
requirement, but it could choose a more
forgiving alternative. Other consequences
to be considered are significantly more
problematic than simply affecting a student's course load. For instance, students
on financial aid might not be able to
afford alternative off-campus housing if
they are not able to get college housing as
a result of their failure to complete the
requirement.

Those who can afford off-

campus housing may not be able to find it.

And, even if they do, this could be risky if
they aren't guaranteed the courses they
desire.
In short, the college's concern for its
students is noble, but withoutbetter alternatives to the newly proposed consequences, Swarthmore students might

have to compromise a mental state of
well-being for a physical one.

Administration handles emergency admirably
To the editor:

We would like to recognize the response of the school in
regard to a health-related incident that occurred this past
Thursday. The arrivals of Public Safety and the local paramedics were nearly instantaneous. In addition, Deans Kai
Campbell '9O and Jim Larimore involved themselves from the
outset, arriving at the hospital in the early hours of the morning.

They demonstrated genuine interest in the student's well being
and were supportive to his family and friends. Overall, the way
Swarthmore handled the situation was extremely reassuring
and worthy of our thanks.

in his mantra from a feverish and guttural
"Coooooookie" to the more docile "Cookies are

attributable to Sesame Street's Healthy Habits
for Life campaign, aimed at reducing the
American childhood obesity rate. The thing is,
it isn't working, even as it blasphemes the basic
innocence and carefree spirit that make Cookie
Monster who he is, and children who they are.
A vicious Internet rumor began to spread in
late 2005 that PBS would be changing Cookie
Monster's name to "Veggie Monster." Before it
was proclaimed false and died out, PBS
explained that "[Cookie Monster] now eats a
fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set
a good example for viewers at home. Sure he
loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in
general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart
is happy." The new Cookie Monster hasn't
replaced his affinity for sweets with his own
vegetable garden, but he is "broadening his eating habits," which includes only eating his
eponymous foods at designated "sometimes"
during the show. Sounds pretty tame, right? It

does, until it becomes clear that Cookie
Monster's new dieting scheme is just another
superficial
but in this case, damaging
lifestyle recommendation that doesn't do a

social changes that promote obesity and laziness.

THE PHOENIX

Report confirms that the childhood obesity rate
has more than tripled in the last two decades to
include 25 million children, and in the last two
years, since Sesame Street has tried to slim
down, it has nevertheless grown steadily. The
Healthy Habits for Life campaign is an all-toocommon corollary of America's underlying
naivete—just like the $3O billion a year the FDA
reports that Americans spend on weight-loss
products.

Cookie Monster's new dieting
scheme is just another superficial —but damaging lifestyle
recommendation that doesn't
do a damn thing
We're full of superficial pseudo-solutions to
the obesity problem, and watching Cookie
Monster's weight isn't nearly the worst. We've
eliminated trans fats from Fig Newtons, we
watch NBC's "The Biggest Loser" and we drink
Coke Zero. But in our high-fat-low-exercise society, we ignore the cornerstone of good health,
physical activity and the childhood obesity rate
is much higher for it. According to the Surgeon
General, only one third of children meet recommended physical activity levels. Sitting in front
of the TV and watching Carrot Monster devour
a rutabaga, their metabolic rates drop and their
waists swell. So what's a PBS exec, to do? Well,
nothing.

It isn't Sesame Street's job to teach our children good health habits. It isn't even a cute
idea, because when "Healthy Food," Cookie
Monster's latest aria, replaces "C is for Cookie,"
it sends a veiled message that cookies for cookies' sake—in effect, the essence of childhood—aren't allowed. We have to recognize the glorious disparity between puppets and parents:
Puppets teach us how to play, parents teach us
how to grow. Should they occasionally adopt
each other's roles? Certainly. After all, Cookie
Monster taught us that if you take a bite out of
a cookie, it makes a 'C. But should they ever
interfere with each other? Let's just say it's not
a healthy choice.

Awareness necessary
Due to the recent bomb threats, communication
and vigilance at Swat are increasingly important
The idyllic tree-lined campus
inhabited by Swarthmore students
carries with it a sense of safety and
of (sometimes claustrophobic) closeness between peers. It is no surprise,
then, that Swarthmore has been
called a "bubble" at many a time.
However, recent word of bomb
threats against our school has raised
the question of what would happen
should this bubble pop
and with it
the scary realization that we simply

don'tknow.
For many students, entering college is a welcome escape from the
restrictions and rules of high school.
Long gone are the days of fire, earthquake and lockdown drills. In fact,
the occasional fire drills imposed on

our residence halls are often lamented as a huge nuisance or simply
ignored. But the threats on campus
raise a few disconcerting concerns
about this laidback approach. For
one, should a fire occur, the blaring
fire alarm could be ignored ifregarded simply as another annoying drill.
Worse yet, even the most attentive
students would only be briefed on
the most effective escape routes in
their own dorms
not any of the
other buildings on campus. And this
is only in regards to fires
disasters
we have prepped for since elementary school. The procedures following a bombing on campus are nearly
unfathomable.
Unfortunately, the Virginia Tech
tragedy serves as an example of
what could happen to a campus without an effective alert system and students without preparation for emergencies. It seems as though there is a
large gap in communication between
the administration and its students
that needs to be remedied. It could be
that our administrators have elaborate plans installed to protect its students, but if that is the case, we certainly don't know about them.

Additionally, the relative casualness of the student body towards the
recent bomb threats is indicative of
a larger problem: Swatties are so
steadfast in their belief in the
Swarthmore "bubble" that they
have lost sight of the realities of the
outside world. Although the campus
distributes the NY Times free of
charge, it almost seems as though
the situations described on its front
pages occur in a world completely
separate from our own. Now wellknown advice like looking out for
foreign objects or strange people is
cast aside under the premise that
everyone on campus is trustworthy.
And while good faith within the student body should be treasured, it
should be balanced with a healthy
dose of vigilance and increased
awareness.

Virginia Tech serves
as an example of
what could happen to
a campus without an
effective alert system
It seems as though the only way
to truly make ourselves a nearlyimpervious bubble is to increase the
flow of communication between the
school's administration and its students. It is only fair that students
are not just given fair warning of

possible events, which the administration has been doing regularly
and well, but also how to handle

them

-

an issue that still remains

mysterious. Once given this knowledge, students should let go of the
stubborn notion of "it couldn't happen here," and, instead, start thinking about what steps they would

take if it did.

Sound and Fury

On the week of
September 11, it is
worthwhile
to
reflect upon the lessons of that day and
the ways in which
they apply to the
contemporary
geopolitical scene.
And no, I'm not
talking
about
September 11, 2001;
I'm talking about
September 11, 1973.
On that day, a
CIA-backed coup
deposed Salvador

Allende, the demo-

cratically-elected
socialist president
of Chile, and installed General Augusto Pinochet, who
ruled the country dictatorially for the next 17 years.
Pinochet's rule was marked by extreme human rights
abuses and violent suppression of all political opposition.
Thousands of leftist dissidents simply "disappeared,"
never to be heard from again. Wages for the lower classes dropped precipitously, and unemployment at its height
reached 30 percent. It's no wonder that voters so overwhelmingly rejected Pinochet in a plebiscite on his rule
in 1988.
All of this repression was supported by the United
States, which provided Pinochet with economic aid and
military support. The CIA even directly paid Manuel
Contreras,

the head of Chile's feared

National

Intelligence Directorate and one of the men most responsible for the Pinochet regime's horrific excesses. All of

this was part of a broader pattern of U.S. support for
repressive, brutal rightwing regimes throughout Latin
America as part of Operation Condor. Given such a
record, is it any surprise that there is so much antiAmerican sentiment in the region?
Today, Latin America is largely governed by leftist,
anti-American leaders, epitomized by socialist firebrand

Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who now wants to amend his
country's constitution so he can essentially become president for life. (He also now wants to move Venezuela's
clocks a half-hour forward something about energy consumption and productivity, I think. I guess that's the sort
of thing you propose when you have that much power.)
Chavez feeds off of fiery anti-U.S. rhetoric, and yet some-

how we wonder why he has been so successful.

Iran and Chile are but two examples
of U.S. support for dictators having
the unintended consequence of
leading to anti-U.S. sentiment and
leaders.
Latin America is not the only region where U.S. support for dictatorships has engendered an angry backlash.
This summer, the Bush administration announced that
the Revolutionary Guard of Iran, an elite security force of
the Iranian military, will be added to the list of U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. This is an incredibly
counterproductive decision, and is also contrary to international law, which clearly states that a terrorist group
must be subnational; the security forces of a sovereign
state are by definition not terrorists. It is also an
extremely ironic decision, given the impact of the U.S. on
the creation of the Revolutionary Guard in the first place.
In 1953, a coup deposed Iranian Prime Minister
Mohammed Mossadegh, who was democratically elected
to the Iranian parliament and appointed by Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in accordance with the Iranian
constitution of the time. Mossadegh was a staunch
nationalist responsible for nationalizing Iran's oil industry, which had hitherto been controlled by the British
Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Naturally this upset Britain,
so Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower agreed to
conspire to overthrow Mossadegh. The CIA approved the
appropriation of one million dollars to be used in this
mission, termed Operation Ajax, and Mossadegh was

ousted by pro-Shah forces funded by the U.S. and Britain.
Following this, the CIA and its British counterpart the
Secret Intelligence Service continued to support the
increasingly unpopular pro-Western government of the
Shah, including funneling five million dollars to General
Fazlollah Zahedi, their choice to succeed Mossadegh.
Eventually dissatisfaction with the Shah's policies
reached a climax, resulting in the Iranian Revolution of
1979, which led to the installation of an anti-U.S. Islamic
Republic and the establishment of the Revolutionary
Guard. During the Revolution, Mossadegh's legacy was
used as a rallying point for resisting U.S. imperialism.
Had he remained in power in 1953, perhaps the revolution
would never have occurred. Former Secretary of State
Madeline Albright has even admitted that "the coup was
clearly a setback for Iran's political development" and
that "it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to
resent this intervention by America in their internal
affairs." It is a cruel irony that in many ways, U.S. support for the Shah helped bring about the Iranian
Revolution, which led to the creation of the
Revolutionary Guard which the Bush administration
now regards as a terrorist organization.
Iran and Chile are but two examples of U.S. support
for dictators having the unintended consequence of leading to anti-U.S. sentiment and leaders. Indeed, modern
history is littered with them. U.S.-backed dictator
Fulgencio Batista in Cuba was overthrown to make way
for Fidel Castro. Al-Qaeda cites U.S. military intervention in Saudi Arabia and support for the Saudi royal family as justification for terrorist attacks. Hell, during the
1980s Ronald Reagan even armed Saddam Hussein to fight
against Iran and the Taliban to fight against the Soviet
Union. We all know how well those turned out. American
foreign policy is based almost entirely on momentary
national interest and fails to take into account the desires
and interests of others. This short-sightedness has not
surprisingly led to hatred. We need to move towards a foreign policy that respects the right of self-determination.
We need to learn that supporting unpopular, dictatorial
rulers generally comes back around to bite us in the ass.

First! Nullus.
As a former writer for The Phoenix, as well

as an incredibly amateur blogBer>r > I was very confused by
Josh Cohen's article last week.
Based on the title, I was hoping
to read about the potential threat many journalists feel from blogging, where people who
report on news firsthand are no longer as valued as those who tag articles they feel their
readership will enjoy. Instead, what I read
was something that felt like the very thing
Mr. Cohen was raving against in the first
place: blogging to Be Heard. Many of the ideas
and problems that he claims come with blogging could also be argued to exist originally in
opinion writing for a newspaper. There are
many things I have read in The Phoenix in my
time here that could be considered intentionally contrary, and I imagine I have been the
writer of some of those columns. The whole
point of opinion writing of all types, in my
estimation, is to be heard in some way; that is
why you are making your thoughts available
to public criticism. The idea that writing for a
newspaper is somehow nobler than my cute
little blog assumes that The Phoenix is some
pillar of excellence in journalism and that
people who keep blogs do so because they cannot hang with the big boys who work with
paper. Frankly, this is a pretty elitist view.
One of the joys of blogging for me, besides
the piles of ducats, is that there is no pressure
to always come up with something groundbreaking or profound every two or three

or old rap videos I used to love. I am not con-

fined to a box of constant "serious" or
"mature" commentary that involves politics or
social issues. It allows my admittedly small
readership to see the full scope of who I am
and to have a conversation with me about
things I enjoy. Also, Mr. Cohen's complaint
about constant commentary struck me as odd
because when I wrote for The Phoenix, there
were days that were filled with constant, short
opinions shared by people after reading my
column as well as e-mails.
The difference with blogging is only that
these conversations, held in person when I
wrote for the paper, are now just words underneath a post. I will say my one complaint
about blogging is that comments seem very
impersonal and stripped of context on the
Internet(s). However, to say all Swatties left

my column thinking, "I agree here
skeptical of this point..." is a bit of a stretch. I
am surprised Mr. Cohen did not take advantage of the ability to delete offensive or unproductive comments on his blog posts, though
this could be seen as a bit of a suspicious
move. I also find it interesting that while Mr.
Cohen rails against the form of blogging, he
seems to enjoy using footnotes (somewhat of a
staple amongst the blogs I frequent) a great
deal, though it makes following a column quite
difficult. Of course, he could be doing this as a
satire, and I am just a dense fruit fly. It all just

Kudos to The Phoenix for completely contradicting Mr. Cohen right beneath his column

Mistakes were made, of course,

these marked the only possessions on which New England

The country vs.

"club" never meant much in

era of 100-million-dollar-perclub TV revenues and inflated
transfer fees in which untried
talents such as Ashley Young
can command a sum of 10 million pounds! The popularity of
European football has risen to unprecedented levels in recent
decades, making the age-old 'club vs. country' debate all the
more interesting.
Our most recent victim of the 'club vs. country' scandal is
England's prodigal scouse, Steven Gerrard. Considering
Liverpool's excellent start to the 2007-08 English Premier
League season, manager Rafa Benitez is sensitive to anything
regarding his talismanic captain. Gerrard, having picked up a
toe injury in recent days, was called up to the England squad
for its Euro 2008 qualifier against Israel. Benitez, wary of the
central impact Gerrard has on the Liverpool squad, requested
that England Manager Steve McClaren rest him for the match.
McClaren, however, ignored the request, claiming that Gerrard
will play even if he is forced to take pain-killing injections in

the process.
Here we go again: the club vs. country row. In this case, both
managers have a lot at stake. If the England squad failed to win
the Israel qualifier, McClaren would have most probably found
himself jobless before the post-match
interview.
Simultaneously, Benitez is under tremendous pressure to win
the Premier League, especially following the near-30 million
pound transfer of Fernando Torres from Atletico Matrid. Fans
v nd chairmen alike expect a lot from Liverpool this season, and
an injured Steven Gerrard could easily render such goals
impossible. Add to this the fact that Liverpool Football Club,
not the English Football Association, pays Gerrard's wages,
ergo if Gerrard injures himself in the Israel qualifier,
Liverpool covers the costs of his recovery. Now, it becomes
much easier to understand Benitez's frustration. Where do we
go from here?
One option: ask Gerrard. Ah, that's a tough one
he's a
scouse (Liverpool born-and-bred) and an England regular,
Liverpool captain and England's central source of offensive creativity. The honor of playing for your country, especially in
England, would have made this a non-issue in the early '9o's, but
it has become a more sensitive affair in recent days. In the end,
he chose to play in the qualifier, a match England comfortably
won 3-0 at the New Wembley Stadium but what would have
happened if he had aggravated his toe injury? The FA would pay
Liverpool a minor "consolation fee," which can never account
tor the opportunity cost of his absence in Premier League matches, and Benitez would continue moaning about the world's hate
for Liverpool FC. Why doesn't the FA just pay a "just" compensation fee? Answer: they simply can't afford it.
The other option: pull a Francesco Totti and retire from the
national team. This sounds like madness, but it has been done.
Totti is more of a Romanista than an Italian, which is understandable given his background of coming through the youth
ranks of AS Roma. He has shunned all interest from the usual
European suspects, including Real Madrid, Juventus and
Manchester United, to remain in Roma, living his childhood
dream. Some may argue that this is foolish, but I respect it. He
chose club over country for coherent reasons other than
"fatigue," cough, cough, David Bentley. He took one stance, and
Gerrard took another; neither is absolutely right, nor absolutely wrong. Personally, I'd hope fewer players had to limbo
between club and country obligations, hoping to achieving a
balance between the two. I lack creativity, though, so for now,
the club vs. country row lives on.

Shutout streak kept alive
BY CONOR CASEY

ccasey2@swarthmore.edu

The womens' soccer team's undefeated season was
put briefly on pause Tuesday night when its match

against neighboring college Philadelphia Biblical
University was rained out.
Going into the game, the women were riding a 3-0 hot
streak that they hoped to carry into Tuesday night's
match-up. Instead, they will have to wait a few more
days before they once again put their skills to the test.
As of yet, the team is unscored upon, winning its
first three matches by margins of 1-0, 3-0 and 3-0, against
Catholic College, Neumann College and Grinnell
College, respectively.
Although it is still early in the season, individual
Garnet players have already been receiving accolades

from opponents and from around the conference. For
the week of Sept. 4, forward Danielle Tocchet 'OB, and
goalkeeper Lauren Walker 'O9 netted conference honors of Offensive Player of the Week and Defensive
Player of the Week, respectively. At the 12th Annual
Swat Kick Classic, held the weekend of Sept. 1-2 and
featuring teams from Catholic, Neumann and Villa
Julie, four Garnet players made the all-tournament
squad, with Walker, Tocchet, Sarah Reese 'll and
Megan Colombo 'll garnering credit for their play in
the weekend's games.
With three shutouts to start off the season, the
Garnet is clearly playing good soccer.
"The team has a mindset on scoring goals," thirdyear head coach Todd Anckaitis said. "It's not just the
strikers. Even the backs are scoring goals."
Players agree.

"We play with a lot of speed, and we play very well on
the ground," Monica Cody 'lO said. "And we encourage
each other on and off the field."
The mindset on scoring goals has resulted in an offensive onslaught in the first three games. In the game
against Grinnell last Friday, Swarthmore out-shot the
team from lowa 20-9. And in the previous game against
Neumann, the numbers were even more one-sided, with
the Garnet out-shooting its neighbors 28-4.
September 13, 2007

The team does not appear surprised or even satisfied
with its fast start. The squad has high expectations for
this fall after last year's record-breaking season.
"Our goal is to win conference," forward Caitlin
O'Neil 'lO said. "I think we can, definitely."
Midfielder Lizbeeth Lopez 'lO agreed, saying, "Our
goals are beating Johns Hopkins and winning conference."

Such hopes are not that far-fetched, given the success
oflast year's team, which posted a 15-5-1 record, the best
in the program's 24-year history, and made the
Centennial Conference finals for the first time ever.
That success should only increase this year, given the
fact that the Garnet lost only three seniors to graduation
while gaining an influx of first-year players
10 in all
among whose credentials include all-county and allstate honors. Five of these first-years cracked the starting lineup of the season opener, while veterans filled in
the remaining six spots.
But don't let the large first-year class fool you. "This

year's team has a lot more experience," Anckaitis said.

"Last year we had a decent-sized freshman class, who
have a lot more experience now. A lot of them played a
decent amount of minutes last year."
Among its many seasoned veterans, the Garnet
returns four all-conference players in forward Katie
Kanuka 10, who captured first team honors last year
with her conference-leading 17 goals, nine of which were
game winners (another conference top), Caitlin
Miillarkey 'O9, a defender who was named first team allconference for the second year in a row and midfielder
Maggie DeLorme 10 and Walker, both of whom received
honorable mentions last year for their efforts.
This year's team is on a mission to make believers out
of those who still doubt whether it is a team with which to
contend in the conference. The only way they feel they can
do this, however, is if they are all on the same page.
"The group is working hard to come together as a
unit," Anckaitis said.
Lopez agreed. "It's not just a one-man team," she said.
With this mentality, the Garnet looks to continue its
hot streak this Saturday at home at 4 p.m. against conference foe Dickinson College.

Stone leads Tide past Richard Stockton
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

Another year, another fast start for the Garnet field
hockey team. After defeating Richard Stockton College by
a decisive score of 5-1 on Tuesday night, the Swarthmore
women improved their early record to 3-1, matching the
team's success in the opening weeks of its last two seasons.
Natalie Stone 'O9 came off the bench for the Garnet to lead
the team with three goals against the Ospreys who were
shut out by goalie Katie Ashmore 11 after their only goal
16 minutes into the game.
Richard Stockton took the early lead on a shot by
Samantha Horner off a penalty corner, but the lead did not
last long as Stone responded with her first goal just four
minutes later from an assist by Jordan Schmidt 'O9.
Schmidt added a goal of her own just before halftime on
another shot off a penalty corner to send the Garnet into
the break with a 2-1 advantage.
While the Ospreys hoped that the Swat sticks would be
cooled off by the start of the second period, the Garnet continued its scoring streak soon after the whistle blew to
solidify its advantage. Stone converted the second and
third goals of her hat trick in the 41st and 52nd minutes,
and Abbe Muller 10 put the nail in the coffin with a tip
into the back of the Osprey net in the 61st minute.
Swarthmore barraged Richard Stockton goalie Debi
O'Kane with 21 shots in the game, while the stingy Garnet
defense held the Ospreys to just five shots.
The Garnet did suffer loss of forward Hoa Pham 10 in
the game, as she will be out for at least a week with an
ankle injury.
The win was the perfect follow-up to Saturday's just as
impressive win over Neumann College, when the Garnet
defense allowed just three shots, none in the second half,
as Ashmore recorded the first complete game shutout of
her Swarthmore career. Co-captain Abigail Fischer 'OB
scored both of the Garnet's goals on the afternoon on six
shots out of the team's total of 32.
"The game [Tuesday night] was a step forward," Joslyn
Young 10 said. "We came together a lot in the second half
...We have a pretty young team but everybody's really
excited."

"We've improved a lot in each of the games," Stone said.
"We've been really moving forward. We have a lot of talent
on the team this year in all the different classes."

Coach Kelly Wilcox '97 praised the effort the team has
put in and is impressed with the level of play she's seen so
far. "This is an incredibly resilient and coachable and
open-minded team," Wilcox said. "They really have surpassed their own expectations and our's as coaches in
terms of what they're doing on the field." Wilcox is happy
with her options on the field, as she has a range of players

who can score, making it hard for other teams who are
preparing to face the Garnet.
"A lot of teams wrote us off," she said. "I knew better. I
knew that we have so much talent. Team chemistry is
already really impressive
I think this team is almost
...

limitless and boundless."

Young said the team is working on staying strong and
playing tough from start to finish in every game. "Part of
it is just putting together a consistent game and coming
and just playing together
out strong and playing poised
as a team for the entire game."
Swarthmore will play two more home games against
non-conference teams in the next week before it enters the
heart of its season. Randolph-Macon College will visit on
Sunday Sept. 16 at 1 p.m., followed by Elizabethtown
Thursday Sept. 20 at 7 p.m. This will be the last chance for
the Garnet to tune up its play before seeing what the rest
of the Centennial Conference has to offer as it heads into
four straight match-ups against league rivals.

Men's soccer remains undefeated

Robert Manduca for The Phoenix

The Garnet men continued their recent success
this weekend in games against Skidmore College
and Montclair State. On Friday night, Swarthmore
earned a 2-0 win over the Thoroughbreds, with
Ladule Lako Lo Sarah 'O9 scoring both goals for the
Garnet. On Saturday, Swarthmore came back to face
the Red Hawks, the llth-ranked team in the country.
The Garnet held its own against Montclair State,
holding on for a 0-0 tie. For his effort in the matches,
Swarthmore goalie Ryan Sutcliffe 'OB was named
Centennial Conference Defensive Player of the Week
on Monday.
Swarthmore faced off against St. Mary's (MD)
College last night in a game too latea for publication, and will hardly get a rest this week. On
Saturday, Centennial Conference foe Johns
Hopkins, ranked ninth in the nation. Last season
the Blue Jays played host to the Garnet and defeated Swarthmore 2-0, but Swarthmore will be counting on the support of its home crowd this time
around. The Jays will make their highly-anticipated visit this Saturday at 7 p.m.

frustrating matches to
Neumann and Moravian Colleges this
week, taking the first game from both the
Knights on Saturday and Greyhounds on
Tuesday before losing the next three. In
between, the Garnet handily defeated a
young squad from Marymount College in
three games, giving Swarthmore a 2-5
R record for the young season.

On Saturday, Swarthmore hosted both
Neumann and Marymount in a tri-match
in Tarble Pavilion. The Garnet was looking for revenge against the Knights, who
had taken the teams' early scrimmage at
the Swat Preseason SpikeFest two weeks
before. Swarthmore came out firing
against Neumann with 13 kills in the first
game to take the 30-26 win. But the initial
energy was not sustained, and the Knights
put the reins on Garnet offense in the second game and were able to use their
momentum to finish off the match, 30-17,
30-24, 30-28.
"It was good preparation for conference
play that begins next week," Erin Heaney
'O9 said of the match. "We identified in the
i game a lot of things that we're going to be
working on ... Our setter transition and our
blocking will probably be the big focuses."

In the second game of the day,
Swarthmore was able to bounce back
against a team from Marymount that featured four first-years on the starting roster. The Garnet exploited the Saints' lack
of experience, sustaining its early effort
and
completely
shutting
down
Marymount's attack in the second game
for a lopsided 30-8 win to take command of
the match. Swarthmore's offense was
impeccable in the second game, as the
Garnet recorded 13 kills but only committed one error. Even more impressive was
the team dynamic of the win, as no single
player went into double-digits for kills in
the match, but six had at least five kills.
Sarah Lambert 'll gave Swarthmore
something to be excited about by recording five service aces in the match, which
the Garnet ultimately took 30-23, 30-8, 3025. In the third game, it felt like
Swarthmore's finishing trouble might be
coming back to haunt the squad once
again, as Marymount cut a 28-18 lead to
29-25, but the Saints missed on their next
kill attempt to give the Garnet the victory.
"That was huge and exciting," Heaney
said of the victory. "I think that everybody really pulled together. There was a
lot of communication between everybody
that was on the court."
Swarthmore was not so lucky on
Tuesday night, when it could not take

advantage of an early lead and was barraged by a Greyhound team that converted
63 kills over the course of the match, led by
21 from senior JennaWallace. Jen Wang 'O9
(18) and Katherine Gold 'OB (13) both were
in the double digits for kills, and Wang had
17 digs to go along with Heaney's 22, but it
was not enough for the Garnet to slow

"Skill-wise we're there, we

Vanessa Wells 'OB
Swarthmore's early impressive play in

all three matches hints at its potential this
season, but the team acknowledges that it

has work to do before Centennial
Conference play starts next week and has
been hitting the court hard in practice to
work out the remaining kinks.
"We're still trying to have some perspective," Vanessa Wells 'OB said. "It's week
four and we have 11 weeks. We haven't run

September 13, 2007

a 6-2 before so we're getting used to that...
Skill-wise we're there, we just need to figure out how to sustain the talent that is
clearly on the floor."
Coach Harleigh Leach agreed. "We have
a strength on our side in that we start off
games strong," she said. "We need to learn
how to start the second game with that
same intensity."
Swarthmore's final test before conference play will come this weekend at the
Garnet Classic, where Swarthmore will
play host to teams from Rutgers-Newark,
Frostburg State University, Stevens
Institute
of Technology, Salisbury
University and Cabrini College. The
Garnet's scheduled matches are on
Saturday against the Scarlet Raiders at 2
p.m. and against the Bobcats at 6 p.m.
Sunday's semifinal and final matches will
be decided based on Saturday's results,
but Leach forecasts that Swarthmore
could face off against either Stevens Tech
or Salisbury, two of the most talented
teams in the region.
The Garnet Classic has consistently provided Swarthmore with a chance to hold a
high-quality tournament at home and the
talented competition shouldmake this year
no exception. "It's going to be a strong tournament," Leach said. "I'm hoping that it
just continues to be as great as it has been
in the past."
