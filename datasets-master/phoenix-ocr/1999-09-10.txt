have a hearing later this
month; their expected punishment is community service
and participation in an alcohol

Lloyd was relatively pleased
by the probation decision, noting that the sanctions
"could've been much worse."
Goundie said that because
DU was serving minors and
not checking student IDs,
some sort of punishment was
necessary. While he said he
considered options as lax as a
warning and as strict as an

in early October, replacing a
historic telescope that has
been used by the College for
over 100 years.
The new telescope, a sixteen-inchSchmidt Cassegrain
reflector, is currently being
installed in the dome in the
south end of Strawbridge Observatory. The dome is being
renovated to create an elevated platform around the

telescope and to add a computer room beneath it which
can be used for student observations.
The telescope which the college is replacing was first installed in 1884 and was built
by Alvan Clark and Sons of
Cambridge, Massachusetts,
widely considered the best
lensmakers of the era. However, the telescope was extremely worn, and according
to Professor of Astronomy
Steve Boughn, it would have
cost thousands of dollars to fix
it. Instead, the college sold it
to a collector for $20,000 and
used the money to pay for a
new, more modern scope with
a larger lens, as well as to finance the renovation project
in Strawbridge Observatory.
The new scope will be under
wraps until October.

Back on top: Swat returns to No. I in U.S. News rank

By Emily Brown
For The Phoenix

For the second time in three
years, U.S. News and World

the best liberal arts college in
the nation. The rankings were

calculated on the basis of academic reputation, graduation

and retention rates, faculty
resources, student selectivity,
financial resources, alumni

performance.
Swarthmore edged out
Amherst College for the top
overall score, earning the top
rank in the category of student selectivity and tying with
Amherst and Williams for the
best academic reputation, 4.8
on a 5.0 scale. The top six colleges overall were Swarthmore, Amherst, Williams,
Wellesley, Haverford, and
Middlebury.
The academic rating was
the most significant factor in
the calculation of the
rankings. Deans of colleges
and universities around the
country completed questionnaires regarding the academic reputations of 160 national liberal arts colleges.

Even with increased name

also a prevailing sentiment

Where long lines of students
waiting to have their bags
checked once clogged the
main entranceway to McCabe
Library, patrons now move
freely in and out, without having to stop at the reception
desk. The installation of a new
electronic security system
over the summer makes this
possible.
"The library decided to install an electronic detection
system in an effort to solve
several problems," said Amy
Morrison, assistant head librarian. She said there was an
"overwhelming dissatisfaction" with the old procedure of
checking bookbags when patrons exit the library. Through
theft, there were also an increasing number of materials
missing from the collection,
especially video recordings.
For materials no longer in
print, replacement was difficult and costly.

Since then, however, no

other items that have not been

These plans were not meant

summer, the same equipment
will be put in either the
Cornell Library of Science

will be a part of a renovation

"As with all new things
there is a period of adjustment," Morrison said, "and
with the new security system
it is no different." She emphasized that the system was installed for the benefit of library patrons and to preserve
the collection.
So far, no personnel changes

the students.
In her resignation letter,
Yang noted that choosing to

enjoyable experiences she
had on Student Council.
"I resign not because of
unhappiness with the organization, the planning process, or the college community," Yang wrote, "but because it would be extremely
unfair for me to maintain a
position where I would not
be able to fully serve the students."
Yang admitted in her letter that Student Council has

said that its members "do

implementation of the security system. Polly Hallman, a
member of the library staff
for 31 years who retired in
June, will not be replaced.
"While in the immediate future, the familiar and friendly
faces of the receptionists will
still be present to greet and
assist entering patrons as well
as clarify any needed action as
patrons leave the building,"
Morrison said, "as other possibilities occur, we'll make
adjustments."
Students seem to be reacting well, or not at all, to the
new system.
"Most people don't even notice," Smith said.
Ann Agenbroad, reception-

ist at McCabe for eight years,
commented that she has seen
students unconsciously linger
at the reception desk to have
their bag checked before they
remember that it already has
been done electronically.
"The faculty and staff seem
very receptive to it," she said.
Helen Fu 'Ol said she likes
the new system, especially in
comparison to the old one.
"The old system was a bit
degrading," she said."lt was
sort of embarrassing to have
the receptionist dig through

time, it was a waste of human
resources, because people
could still sneak things out.

Director of Dining Services Linda McDougall hung this sign where the frozen yogurt machine will eventually be.

Thanks to Solomon, yogurt arriving for meals
By David King
Phoenix Staff
It already has Pino's Pasta,
waffle batter, and apple butter. But soon, Sharpies Dining
Hall will offer a new culinary
delight: soft serve frozen yogurt.
Exactly when the new machine will arrive on campus is
not clear. Director of Dining
Services Linda McDougall
said she was told on Wednesday it was somewhere in
Philadelphia, and that the distributor expects it to arrive by
the end of this week or early
next week.
The idea for the machine
came from Student Council
co-chair Jared Solomon 'Ol.
"I had been receiving a lot
of requests from students for

soft serve ice cream, so I
acted on it," said Solomon.
The ice cream and yogurt
currently offered "require a
torch to soften up enough to
eat," he added with a touch of
sarcasm.
Last year, Solomon approached McDougall and Vice
President for Facilities and
Services Larry Schall about
ordering such a machine.
McDougall told Solomon she
would look into one, but only
if it were technologically advanced enough to not need extensive cleaning after every
meal
as is the case with
older models.
Fortunately,
explained
McDougall, those manufactured today operate with removable cartridges, making
them more "user friendly."

The machine, which will
serve the brand "Miss Karen's
Yogurt," will rotate between
42 fat-free flavors
26 with
sugar, and 16 without.
And just who is responsible
for the large "Thank you
Jared" sign by the grill in
Sharpies?
"It is untrue that I stealthily snuck into Sharpies during
the night and placed up the
sign," asserts Solomon. "It
was all [McDougall]."

Yes, admitted McDougall,
she did it. "Jared had told me
at one meeting he may be a
politician one day," she explained.
"I wanted Swatties to remember [him] for getting soft
serve yogurt, [so that] they
might vote for him in the future."

In the fall of 1998, when
Swarthmore began supporting Windows users for the
first time, PC use skyrocketed. Of the freshmen who
brought computers to school
with them last year, 58% were
Windows users while the other
42% brought Mac computers.
This year, the percentage of
PC users is even greater, with
approximately 70% of the
class of 2003 using Windows
and only 30% of the class using Macs.
This trend seems to indicate
that the number of PC users
will far outstrip the number of
Mac users in only a few years.
Currently, fewer than 100 of
the 900 computers on campus
are PCs. In addition, only 23
of the 67 electronic classrooms have PCs.
The dramatic increase in
the number of PC users over
the past few years has compelled the school to search for
software that is compatible
for both computing systems.
Currently, most of the major
software that is used throughout Swarthmore is available
for both PC and Mac users,
including Microsoft Office,
Netscape Navigator, and
spreadsheet software.
The main problem still
faced by Swarthmore computing is that some of the software that professors choose to
use in classes has not been
developed by the software
producers in both forms. According to Judy Downing, director of the computing center, the goal is to provide identical or nearly-identical software for both platforms. "Our
plan is to come as close as possible to matching the software
for Macs in Windows form,"
she said.
The school has had to hire
many more dorm consultants
in order to lighten the
workload of last year's PC
counselors. In the fall of 1998,

Swat was obliged to hire an

additional two consultants,

bringing the number of PC
consultants up to eight. This
year, there are eleven PC consultants and sixteen Mac
dorm consultants. The college
hopes to eventually have at
least one consultant for each
platform in every dorm so
that the PC consultants will
not be forced to travel to other
dorms to make house calls.
Consultant Al Bui 'O2 notes
that "the workload varies, but
it takes two to three times as
long on average to set up a PC
than [to set up] a Mac." Even
though there are currently
fewer PCs than Macs on campus, the work required of PC
consultants is lengthier. However, the increase in dorm
consultants has lightened the
workload of all the counselors.

Freshman ritual: the rush of registration

Math professor Helene Shapiro helps freshmen sign up for their mathematics and statistics courses

at registration

Leahey starts new service program
By Marina Boevska
For The Phoenix
A new volunteer service
program is starting this fall,
and it aims to arrange some
activities to help the visually
impaired people in the Delaware County. The program is
sponsored by the Swarthmore
Lions Club and is organized by
Christine Leahey 'OO.
"We are not necessarily
looking for students to join the
Lions Club," said Leahey, "but
our real objective is to start a
volunteerprogram that offers
direct interaction with and
services for local residents
that are visually impaired."
Last January,Leahey joined
the Lions Club and met Swarthmore alumna Anne Marie
Kikuch-Teal. The two of them
thought it would be a great

idea to start a cooperation be-

tween the college and the club.

The service program will be
sponsored entirely by the Lions Club. It is an international
organization that is not affiliated with any religion or nation. It raises money to gear
aid for "less fortunate
people," Leahey said, but it
works mostly with people with
visual impairments and blindness.
The main aim of the new
service program at Swarthmore is to organize a "check
writing clinic." This event will
be organized once a month on
a Saturday morning. Swarthmore students will go to a center for visually impaired
people in Chester and help
them with some of their basic
needs like reading their mail,
doing their bills, and writing

checks. Leahey knows that for
now there are at least sixty
people from the Chester community who have expressed
interest in getting aid from
Swarthmore students.
Another aim of the program
is to bring college-bound high
students
school
onto
Swarthmore's campus, so that
they can get a feel for what it
means to be at college and live
independently. Those students
would not necessarily have to
be interested in Swarthmore.
The third main goal that the
service program hopes to realize is to get Swarthmore students to make voice recordings of texts that are not

most part being responsible
and acting in good faith."
For that reason, Goundie
"didn't want to cripple the organization," but felt it necessary to show that the college
"takes [underage drinking]

seriously."
DU was quick to accept the

probation and saw the less-

than-harsh punishment as an
acknowledgement of the miti-

gating circumstances surrounding last year's incident.
In particular, both Lloyd and
Goundie pointed to the lack of
PAs, trained Party Associates.
Had there been PAs at the
event, they would have
checked IDs and maintained

order.
The fraternity had requested
PAs
for
Margaritaville, but none were
available. To keep this situation from repeating itself, administrators are trying to recruit more PAs for this year.
Around campus, reaction to
the decision was mixed.
"If the frat was doing things
that are against college policy,
then yeah, they should get
some punishment," said one
freshman who asked not to be
identified. "This seems pretty
fair, too the punishment fits
the crime."
Tiffany Lennon 'O2 took a
differentapproach: "The frats
here aren't that influential
anyway, so I don't think it'll be

that big a deal. And it's only
for a couple weeks, too."
On the other hand, several
upperclass students said they
would miss the DU parties.
But Lloyd had an opinion
that seemed to be shared by
everybody. "We just want to
put all this behind us," he said.

Court upholds censorship
of Kentucky State yearbook
By Mark Vanderhoff
Kentucky Kernel (U. Kentucky)
(U-WIRE)

LEXINGTON,

A federal appeals court
Ky.
in Cincinnati Wednesday upheld the censorship and confiscation of Kentucky State
University's 1993-94 yearbook, saying the yearbook was
not a public forum for student
expression.
The decision has drawn
criticism from media educators, media students, the StudentPress Law Center and the
plaintiffs, former KSU student editors Charles Kincaid
and Capri Coffer and their
media supervisor at the time,
Laura Cullen.
"We've had thirty years of
significant college (First
Amendment) protection, and
they ignored the cases that set
precedents," said Mike
Hiestand, staff attorney for
the Student Press Law Center.
The majority on the threejudge panel for the case of
Kincaid vs. Gibson cited an
earlier decision, Hazelwood
School District vs. Kuhlmeier,
to justify their decision.
"The court in Hazelwood
noted... that if the school did
not intentionally create a public forum, then the publication
remains a nonpublic forum,
and school officials may impose any reasonable, nonviewpoint based restriction on
student speech exhibited
therein," Judge Alan E. Norris
wrote for the majority.
Many critics say the application of Hazelwood, a high
school case, to a college publication is dangerous, and
have said the decision poses

serious threats to First
Amendment rights.
applying
"They're
Hazelwood, a high school decision, at a much different
level. We're talking about substantially more sophisticated
folks in college," said Richard
Goehler, the journalism
educator's coalition attorney.
"There could be danger on
a wide scale if censorship
creeps into academia," he
said.
The decision disappointed
Mike Agin, UK's media supervisor.
"This poses a danger for the
rights of students to express
themselves without administrative interference," he said.
Agin is confident the decision won't effect UK, and said
university administrators
have been very supportive of
UK students and their rights
to free expression.
If an incident such as the
one at KSU ever arose at UK,
"I'd fight it with everything I
have," he said.
Which is what Cullen did,
and she was fired.
Yesterday's decision presents problems for advisors
and students alike in protecting their First Amendment
rights, Hiestand said.
Hiestand received a phone
call this week from a student
who is currently experiencing
censorship problems at her
college newspaper in Michigan.
"In the past, I would'vebeen
able to fax her copies of caseby-case ways to defend herself.
"As of today, I can't do that,"
he said.

Success, but at what price?
As the goalposts were coming down last Saturday after Swarthmore's
streak-stopping victory over Oberlin, Dean of Student Life Tedd
Goundie, obviously thinking of the cost of replacing the goalposts, said,
"Success has its price."
The comment, however, runs much deeper than Goundie perhaps
intended. The success of the football team
indeed, of the college
publicity mill as a whole has taken its toll on Swarthmore.
We don't take issue with the game of football or those associated with
Swarthmore's football program. We do, however, find the "peculiar
institution" of college football to be a questionable addition to the
college.
At some point not so long ago, someone in Parrish. decided that
Swarthmore needed to change its image
to increase the academic
prestige, to enhance the conventional perception of the college in
general and to rehabilitate a failing football program.
It's hard to argue with increasing Swarthmore's visibility in the
corporate world or bringing more prestigious speakers to campus. But
as the decision to overhaul the football program now comes to fruition,
we believe the administration should have more thoroughly consulted
students;
those who are shouldering the bulk of the consequences
It is a noble goal for Swarthmore to be the best at whatever it does,
and we understand that it was for that reason the changes took place.
But that is not the bone of contention. Few students were consulted
when the administration decided to embark on its athletic "experiment," and with the Bunsen burners now at full blast, students are
precisely the ones forced to deal with the results.
It has been both pleasant and relieving to see the football team
rewarded for their hard work with a win. On the other hand, students
have also been forced to live through the DU bust and the subsequent
probation as well as last spring's incidents of prospective football
players harassing students at parties.
For a school that stresses equality, Swarthmore has shown blatant
favoritism in this recent decision. How Quaker is it for the football
team to receive $20,000 worth of new jerseys while other, more successful teams find themselves underfunded?
Regardless, the greatest travesty in this whole "experiment" has
been how few students outside the football program were asked how
they would feel about the renewed emphasis on the sport. We can only
hope that the next time the administration does something in the name
of success, they ask students for the price first.

No more empty promises
It's as predictable as the tides
a new school year begins, and
students hunker down in McCabe. The football team loses game after
game, and The Phoenix trips over its own shoelaces trying to make
good on the promise of a "new" newspaper.
But things change, even at Swarthmore. Chalk it up to La Nina or
something in the water, but in a little over a week we have seen the
football team break a 28-game losing streak and crazed students tear
down the goalposts at Clothier Field. And
call it optimism if you like
we hope that as you hold this first issue of The Phoenix in your
hands, you're thinking, "This really is a new Phoenix."
Granted, we're not The New York Times, but we never set out to be.
The Phoenix is first and foremost a campus servant, here to keep you
up-to-date on what matters on campus and to stick our nose into other
people's business when you don't have the time.
With that goal in mind, we have completely reorganized The Phoenix,
journalistically, visually and as an organization. No longer will you have
to read your roommate's political theory paper or some senior theatre
major's postmodern manifesto; instead, with the help of recently hired
journalism professor Ben Yagoda and a talented staff, we hope to treat
you to insightful, exciting and engaging works of journalism relevant to
your world. The new design and expanded photography are intended to
enhance and complement the writing, as well as stand on their own.
Swarthmore certainly isn't a stodgy school, and The Phoenix should
reflect that rather than looking like a turn-of-the-century relic.
After a rebuilding semester last year, we spent the summer pumping
some proverbial iron, and we're now a leaner, hungrier, smarter Phoenix. The paper runs more smoothly, our equipment is better and we
even have a few surprises in store for you.
In exchange for this, all we ask is understanding. The football team
can't go from 0-8 to Division 111 national champions in a single season,
and The Phoenix can't turn into The Daily Northwestern overnight.
But if you bear with us for now, we promise you will see a top-notch
Phoenix this semester. No guarantees on that Division 111 title, though.

GUEST OPINION

Economic progress has only
benefited the rich and powerful
By David Lord
Rocky Mountain Collegian (Colorado State U.)
(U-WIRE)
Politicians, media and big
business are propagating a huge national
lie. Day after day we hear stories of how
great the economy is and how America is
in the midst of prosperity. The real truth
that Washington and Wall Street doesn't
want America to know is that the rich and
powerful are basically the sole beneficiaries of all economic progress over the last
several decades.
The Institute for Policy Studies and
United for a Fair Economy recently released a report entitled, "A Decade of
Executive Excess: The 19905." This report
details the grim story of pay increases
over the last nine years. Since 1990,
American factory workers have seen
their wages raise only 28 percent, barely
enough to keep pace with inflation. At the
same time, the wages for executives have
quadrupled, giving these businessmen a
481 percent pay increase.
The story becomes even more disgusting when one considers wages for hourly
workers. When Congress raised the minimum wage to its current level of $5.15 an
hour, it made up for only half the ground
that was lost to inflation during the 1980s.
According to a report issued by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "a
minimum wage of $5.15 an hour in 1997
is 15 percent below its average purchasing power during the 19705, after adjusting for inflation." This issue is of particular concern for college students who rely
almost exclusively on hourly wage positions in order to pay rent, tuition, child
care and other expenses.
A vast majority of college students cannot rely on family wealth alone to get
through school. According to Colorado
State University's Financial Aid Office,
approximately 65 percent of CSU students receive some form of public assistance from the government.
Critics of a wage increase argue that the
average college student is making significantly more than $5.15 an hour. Even so,

the hourly wage would need to be $6.07
just to return the wage to its purchasing
power during the 19705.
This discrepancy in wage growth cannot be allowed to continue. We cannot
stand by and allow the few at the top to
achieve excessive wealth on the backs of
the millions of American men and women
who contribute hard labor to the system.
It's time for Congress to pass a real minimum wage that is sufficient for survival.
In addition to this increase, Congress
must ensure that we never again allow the
minimum wage to decrease its purchasing power. The minimum wage should be
permanently indexed for inflation.
Opponents of real wagereform usually
raise one of two points. Many will start
out by arguing that an increase in the
minimum wage leads to significant increases in unemployment. This reasoning
is completely theoretical and its truth is
not borne out by history. In a series of
three prominent studies (by David Card,
Lawrence Katz & Alan Krueger and
Alison Wellington) on minimum wage increases and their effect on employment,
the only negative ramification of a wage
increase was a minor decrease in teen-age
employment. The Wellington study found
that a 10 percent in-crease in the wage
met with a 0.6 percent decrease in teenage employment which was "not statistically significant." The study found no job
loss for adults age 25 and over.
The second argument used by opponents
of a wage increase is that it is "not capitalist." This red herring is raised only when
logical arguments have failed, based on the
assumption that anything that is "not capitalist" is also immoral or misguided. I'm
not sure who is more to blame in this situation; the business elites who have erected
the idol of unrestricted capitalism, or the
millions of Americans who buy into the lie
and bow down before it.
Despite the lies and illusions that Washington and Wall Street spread, America's
economic and moral well-being depends
on increasing the wage of the working
poor.

U.S. News rankings mislead students, parents
Staff Editorial
Brown Daily Herald (Brown U.)

(U-WIRE)
People Magazine lists
the year's most beautiful people. Car
and Driver lists the best cars on the
market. PC Magazine lists the top computers. And, of course, U.S. News &
World Report annually lists its version
of the nation's top colleges. While they
all have different content, they share
an underlying common purpose
to
gain readership and viewers, and to
make more money from advertising
and sales.
Each year, more than a million parents and students peruse the lists to
find which schools are supposedly the
best in the country. And each year, the
entire country engages in an animated
discussion to rationalize the changes
among the rankings.
Unfortunately, the people reading
the rankings aren't buying cars or
picking computers. They are attempting to make one of the biggest decisions of a person's life
choosing
where to attend college and where to
expand one's mind. For such an important process, it's a shame that there are
so many games being played.
At the very least, the U.S. News
bankings are misleading. At worst,
they're downright dishonest. Year af-

vice to its students. Just as a school
finds a way to raise its place in a category, the people at U.S. News could
change the makeup of the rankings
entirely. Of course, most schools
wouldn't act so irrationally, aware that
they can't outsmart the magazine's
statisticians.
Most students make college decisions based on the quality of teaching,
the satisfaction of the students, and
the overall educational environment at
the institution. And determining such
subjective quality is precisely the
stated goal of the U.S. News rankings.
But unfortunately for the millions of
people who read the rankings each
year, it is also where the magazine fails
its readers most.

ter year, the methodology changes to

move schools around on the list. And
based on this subjective system disguised as a science, high school students and their parents develop flawed
notions as to which colleges they
should attend, effectively compromising their futures. While it is fairly safe
to say that Cal Tech won't be swamped
by potential history majors next year,
it's also likely that many students will
fail to search for proper matches, letting a magazine make their decisions

instead.

Moreover, any school that reacts to
the rankings to improve its place on
the list would be doing a great disser-

Note to freshmen:
It's time to get
used to realities
of Swarthmore
Since it's a little early in the year to
bring to bear wide-ranging complaints
on the state of Swarthmore, I figured
that I would instead make a few recommendations to our incoming brethren (the first of which is to not use
brethren in the case I just did; the second of which is to not split infinitives).
This can be a difficult place to which
to get used (isn't English beautiful?),
and having already fallen behind myself, after a mere two days of class, it
seems time to impart, if not wisdom,
learned advice upon our new students.
1. Ppn't fall behind seriously. You
know that book that you skipped when
you couldn't find it on Tripod because
you spelled "critique" without the second "i"? It's on the exam. You know the
econ problems you didn't do because
you thought you understood demand
curves? You don't, and that will soon
be exploited by a thorough (some
would say sadistic, but where's the line
drawn?) professor. While this is probably useless advice because you're already a member of five clubs and an
officer in three of them, it's still true.
2. You're not leaving campus. I know
you think you are. I know that in your
essay you wrote that one of the reasons you want to go to Swarthmore is
that it's near Philadelphia, and not only
will you get a great education, but you
will be exposed to the thriving metropolis of the city of humanly love and
thus have a richer and more varied
experience than is possible at isolated
institutions such as Amherst, Williams
and West Point, but trust me, you're
going nowhere. If you ever leave, it
will be on the movie shuttle, because
it's organized and on time and you
don't have to convince three friends
(including the one with a car) to all go
to the same place (which they don't
want to do) at the same time (which
they can't, because one has a girlfriend
to which he is nearly engaged and the
other won't be done with his/her/its/
goat's reading until eleven). Just go to
Marple. See something with a little
skin. You'll thank me.
3. Bring a map. I know it's a small
campus, and you've already been to
classes, but trust me, when you wake
up three minutes before your Bio 1
midterm (is that a required class now,
or does it just seem that every freshman takes it?), and you're half asleep
and half think that you're back at
home, you won't remember how to get
to Martin. My most vivid freshman
memory is coming out of Trotter and
trying to get back to Dana. To do this,
I knew I needed to walk past an observatory. Unfortunately, the dome I saw
was the one on the arboretum building, so I headed in the opposite direction for at least ten minutes, while at
the same time making myself late for
preseason soccer. By the time I figured out what had happened, I was
twenty minutes late and fumbling like
an idiot. Now, I'm not saying that's why
I didn't make the team, but it couldn't
have helped.
Well, I believe I've written myself
out of space. You'll be hearing a lot
more idiosyncratic Swarthmore jokes
in the months and even years to come.
Enjoy. By the way, do you know if any
good movies came out this week?

Girls are human,
so is body hair
For something as unimportant as
body hair, it's amazing how much attention women at Swarthmore attract
when they refuse to shave. I remember noticing last year during orientation howmany women refrained from
shaving and whispering comments to
similarly stunnedfrosh.
Eventually we all got used to the
strange idea, and I hadn't thought
about it until I was reminiscing about
what orientation had been like last
year. Why was it such a big deal?
I remember in middle school when
kids first began growing hair on their
bodies. Hair became a sign of manliness for boys; we were growing up,
and were proud to display our newly
grown prizes whenever possible. At
the same time, girls didn't seem to
have any hair except on their heads,
where they had quite a bit. That was
one of the few differences between us
at the time. I suppose the few times I
did see girls with hair on their bodies
I associated it with masculinity.
I don't know when I realized that
many girls had to cut the hair off their
bodies, but it was much later. By that
time, the idea that body hair on women
was undesirable had already been
well-established in my mind.
At Swarthmore I questioned that
idea, along with many others. I had a
discussion with a friend who told me
about an article that stated that guys
were turned off by the idea of their
girlfriends defecating, going through
PMS and several other bodily functions which the males said they preferred not to know about.
Now that seems like a really stupid
idea. I think these guys are trying to
pretend that their girlfriends are not
actually humans, but rather something
resembling a doll. Dolls are great, I'm
sure, but it has to be hard to have a
healthy relationship with one. Plus,
people are not dolls, of course, and
they probably don't enjoy being
treated like them.
It wasn't until a few days later that
I realized I might be doing the same
thing by preferring that my girlfriend
shave her legs. Was I really as bad as
these fools, ruining my relationship
for myself, hurting my girlfriend's
self-esteem and contributing in general to the Barbie complex afflicting
America's youth?
I think it all depends on how you
approach it. I mean, I shave, too
every day, unfortunately. I don't mind
it is worth a certain amount of effort to look good, or in my case, better. However, if I miss a day and end
up with some stubble, I don't expect
to take any slack. Luckily, society is
on my side, and men can get away with
that. Unfortunately, sometimes
women cannot.
The standard of beauty for women
is much more stringent than that for
men, and deviations from that rule are
not as accepted. This is what needs to
change. Whether women shave their
legs, armpits or anything else is meaningless and purely a matter of personal preference. It shouldn't matter
any more than whether men shave or

not.

I'm fairly sure there are some genetic traits that men find attractive in
women for purely reproductive reasons, but I don't think lack of hair is
one of them. Body hair is not a big deal,
and realizing that fact will probably
help change our ideal women from
plastic to flesh and bone.

The India-Pakistan conflict, which is

Washington likes it or not, the U.S. is

Trouble in Taiwain: Economic incentive
should stabilize One-China policy
By Andrew Fefferman

For The Phoenix

On July 9 Taiwanese president Lee
Teng-hui declared that the relationship
between China and Taiwan would be
"state to state." The U.S. responded by
siding with China. This was surprising, considering that the U.S. supported the Chinese who first fled to
Taiwan in 1949 as the true leaders of
all of China.
On the other hand, the U.S. also has
a legacy of attempts to mollify China.
For instance, the U.S. arranged a 1979
agreement between China and Taiwan
that indefinitely postponed the re-assimilation of Taiwan into China. Also,
the U.S. has placed the importance of
trade with China above the importance
of addressing its human rights record,
as shown by the continuation of
China's Most Favored Nation trading

status.

Yet the U.S. supported Taiwan in
1995 by sending aircraft carriers to
the straits separating the two countries when China began to fire missiles
toward Taiwan. Is the U.S. now doing
the right thing by appeasing China and
turning its back on Taiwan, a country
with many who seek to maintain self-

determination?

For those who are cynical, this is a

moot point. The U.S. does not come to

the aid of countries because they are
suffering from oppression. For instance, in its defense of Kuwait, the
U.S. may have been mostly driven by
ulterior, self-serving motives. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq resulted in a
great increase in the price of petroleum, so it may have been that the defense of Kuwait was primarily to control rising oil prices. Therefore, a
more realistic question may be, "Are
the interests of the U.S. better served
by turning our back on Taiwan to mollify China?"
In The New York Times on Sunday,
Thomas L. Friedman asserted that a
military conflict between China and

Taiwan over Taiwan's independence

would seriously disrupt our economy.

The computer industry offers a good

example of this. Many large computer
companies, such as Compaq, Dell, and

Cisco Systems, get many of their com-

ponents from Taiwan because it is

cheaper to manufacture them there.
The disruption in supply of computer
components that would result from an
invasion of Taiwan would coincide
with the climax of the Y2K crisis,
which will cause a surge in the demand
for replacement computer components. This was one good reason for
the U.S. to mollify China.
Instability in China and Taiwan also
has effects on the stock markets in
those two countries. After President
Lee's statement, both countries' stock
markets suffered huge losses. These
two countries were bastions of stability during the Asian economic crisis,
so there is probably a great deal of U.S.
investment in both places. Therefore,
the U.S. appeased U.S. stockholders by
not inflaming the conflict between
China and Taiwan.
There was also the possibility that
the U.S.'s support of China would result in more aggression from China
and possibly even a forceful, immediate takeover of Taiwan. This was unlikely, however, since both China and
Taiwan have pressures acting on them
to avoid conflict. For one thing, Friedman wrote, Taiwan will be increasingly dependent on China's large market in the future.
This, too, is clearly shown in the
computer industry. While Taiwan is
now profiting by supplying computer
components to U.S. companies, U.S.
companies are now considering obtaining their computer components
from other Asian countries with even
cheaper labor. Therefore, Taiwan
needs to take the same step that
American companies did: make the
transition from manufacturing to programming.
Taiwan needs to maintain good relations with China because of the large
Chinese-speaking labor market in
China, whose programmers can write
software for Taiwanese companies,
and because of the large output market that can consume computer software designed for the Chinese. This
large market in China would justify

The disruption in supply of
computer components that
would result from an invasion of
Taiwan would coincide with the
climax of theY2K crisis, which
will cause a surge in the demand
for replacement computer
components. And China will

the risks involved in the Taiwanese
move from manufacturing to programming.
But China, too, is dependent on Taiwan for economic reasons. It will need
the Chinese language software that
will be written by Taiwanese companies in order to build efficient businesses that utilize computers. Also,
Taiwan was one of the few countries
in Asia to avoid the Asian economic
flu, and it has kept China from stagnating during this period by investing
there.
A conflict between China and Taiwan would also be ill-advised because
of public opinion in China. In China, a
get-rich attitude has pervaded ever
since Deng Xiaoping declared that "to
get rich is glorious." The only way that
China can do this is if it has a period
of stability without military conflict.
Although the Chinese showed their
fierce patriotism after the accidental
NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, this get-rich attitude may prevent any military expression of this patriotism.
Hopefully, the Chinese government
realizes that although a nominal "oneChina" policy is important to the Chinese, they aren't willing to sacrifice
the prospects of financial success by
invading Taiwan, and the U.S. decision
to mollify China will prove to be a good
one.

The main issue is neither India
or Pakistan. It is Kashmir and
the Kashmiris, a place and a
people to which the entire
world turns a blind eye.
determination, which India steadfastly refuses to grant.
Pakistan, of course, is not much better: it sends guns and fanatic
mujahiddin to the Kashmiris to "help"
in the fight for freedom, on the tacit
recognition that a newly independent
Kashmir would automatically join Pakistan as its fifth province. Pakistan
does not recognize that Kashmir has
developed through adversity into a
region separate of others. A referendum on independence is in order, as
called for by many Security Council
resolutions that were never followed.
In war there are no winners, only
losers. The side who loses the least is
declared victor, while those who lose
the most are not the defeated side as
much as the innocent victims.
What was defeated in Kargil was a
piece of Kashmir's dream to be a free
land independent of regional nuclearpower politics. Whether that dream
can survive is an open-ended question.

New SAT system
not so smart
Staff Editorial
The Pitt News (U. Pittsburgh)

(U-WIRE) We're safe, if you think
about it. We already made it into college. Acronyms such as SAT and GPA
have made way for GRE and QPA.
Those nostalgic for the acronyms of
yore might want to think again. The
SAT you thought you knew is soon to
be no more.
The Strivers program in development by the ETS is a bad idea. In estimating a student's score based on nonacademic variables, the ETS is expecting certain types of kids to do
poorly based on who they are. Sure,
it's ready to reward students who perform better than estimated with the
quasi-elitist term "striver," but using
the SAT as an indicator of something
more than just scholastic aptitude is
dangerous.
It's been a long criticism that all the
SAT tests is the ability to take tests.
This, in turn, was said to be a poor
factor in figuring out the potential of
a student's performance at college.
The Strivers program will transform
the SAT into a test that doesn't even
test test-taking abilities but rather
one's ability to do better than those in
similar life situations.
While Strivers statistics will be
used only in situations where it can
benefit students, the idea of Strivers
will change the attitude of students
going into the test. Instead of trying
to do his personal best, will a black
a demographic
inner-city youth
only try
with a low estimated score
to beat out others "just like him" by
200 points, thus ensuring his Striver
status? Will this make him attractive
in the eye of a highly selective school?
These questions call attention to the
faults of the SAT-to-be. You can't assume a student will get a specific
score based on his life experience.
Fortunately, the Striver program
has yet to be implemented. Unfortunately, it's in strong development. We
hope colleges and the ETS will see the
errors of a system that will do little
outside of introducing even more
haziness and gray areas into an already ambiguous test.

RECONSTRUCTING
SWARTHMORE

Facilities spends summer working on renovations
By Min Lee
Phoenix Staff
After the last student left campus for summer vacation, Director of Facilities Management Stuart Hain and
his staff at the Facilities Management Department had
no good reason to rejoice, unlike their colleagues up
the hill, who yearn for the peace and quiet of a
studentless campus.
For Hain and his 100-member team, the departure of
the final student marked the beginning of a hectic summer. The Department oversees the maintenance of all
campus facilities, as well as new constructions and
renovations. It takes care of jobs big or small, from a
faulty faucet in Mertz to the upcoming renovations of

DuPont.
To minimize disruption to campus life, Hain and his
crew stick to smaller projects during the school year,
but come summer, they pick up their pace rapidly. Facilities Management completes between 30 to 40
projects of year, two-thirds of which are finished over
the summer.
"Summer is hell," said Assistant Director of Facili-

ties-Special Projects Alice Balbierer with a sigh of resignation.
So while President Bloom was schmoozing with the
European intelligentsia in Krakow and Paris, and while
Dean Gross was vacationing in his summer home in
Vermont, Hain and company were hard at work, making the campus a better place
in the most concrete
sense of the phrase
for us to live in. Armed with a
yearly budget of over $l7 million about a quarter of
the College's total spending
out of which around $5
million a year is devoted to capital upgrade projects,
such as dormrenovations and building upgrades, Hain's
department is certainly a force to be reckoned with.
And unlike many other departments with comparable
budgets, perhaps projects the most tangible impact
on the campus community. Our quality of life is directly
affected by the work of his department.
As in previous years, this past summer witnessed a
full slate of renovation and construction projects, of
all shapes and sizes. In keeping with the Department's
plan to renovate one dorm per year, Mertz was thoroughly refurbished. As most students would have noticed by now, Parrish Parlours were finally restored to
a condition worthy of its "Parlours" status. As for the
less conspicuous projects, the Martin greenhouse received its long overdue upgrade; the Publications Office was moved to the former Parrish sth5th lounge/makeshift art gallery and renovated; Sproul 3rd was also renovated and repartitioned to yield a new classroom and
two new faculty offices; and finally, Bond was spruced
up to put it on par with the likes of the Scheuer Room.
This year's renovations cost a total of approximately

$3 million.

Here's the lowdown on some of the bigger projects:
Mertz
Mertz was outfitted with a new heating system. New
industry boilers were installed; an individual heating
unit was installed in every room, along with a thermostat so students can adjust the heat themselves. The
new heating units are encased by a quasi-counter, which
provides for additional desk and shelf space, along with
the newly affixed mounted bookshelves, similar to the
type seen in Danawell dorms. Contrary to a popular
rumor, the individual units do not have air conditioning.
The carpet was replaced; new lighting was installed.
A new ceiling was constructed on the 3rd floor to conceal the piping of the new heating apparatus. Finally,
the much-resented burlap walls were painted over in a
pristine white.
The overall student reaction to the renovations was
positive. While certain students voiced concern over
the amount of space that the new heating units occupied, most believe that they are a necessary measure.
"If they improve the heating, then it's as good as a
way to do it," said Matt Murphy 'Ol, of Mertz 2nd South,
and a second year resident of the dorm.
His hallmate lan Huntington 'Ol, while concerned
about the space issue, also offered his vote of approval.
"If they the heater works, I'm all for it," he said.
Their RA, Rodney Morris 'Ol is a huge fan of the
counter and the new shelves. Morris, a voracious
reader, was especially delighted by his newfound shelf
space and found the arrangement "aesthetically pleasing." He was however, disappointed that the poorly
ventilated bathrooms were left unscathed.
All interviewed students gave the new wall color a
big thumbs-up. Besides being simply a cheerier color,
many students thought the old burlap color made the
rooms seem smaller than they actually are. The new
thermostats also fared well.

"I like the illusion of control they give," said Huntington.
The Facilities Department plans to install the same
devices in every dorm on campus. While it remains a
time consuming project, "it seems like a very practical thing to do," observed Mimi Hanaoka 'Ol, of 3rd
North.
But perhaps the biggest fan of the new Mertz is Nick
Attanasio 'OO, of 3rd South. He considers Mertz now "the
best dorm on campus."
Parrish Parlours
All the furniture in the Parlours was either replaced
or reupholstered. The new Parlours now boast two impeccable mahogany tables in each parlour, surrounded
by plush tan greenand striped sofa-chairs.
A separate set comprises granite coffee tables enclosed by purple felt covered armchairs. The carpeting was replaced as well; new lighting was installed
into the ceiling, along with wall sconces; finally, a new
set of curtains will adorn the ceiling-high parlor windows.
The overall effect was one of, as Sarah Yahm 'Ol put
it, a "Jane Austen period film." But despite the fact
that the renovations were reflective of student input,
and in spite of the fact that the new Parlours have left
a positive first impression on most students, skeptics
still remain.
Some students thought that while the appearance of
the Parlours is significantly better, upon learning the
$25,000 cost of the renovations, they believed money
could have been put to more constructive uses.
The main shortcoming of the old Parlours was its poor
lighting, observed Maya Seligman, a final semester
senior, and that problem could have been rectified at a
lesser cost. The lavish renovations did not draw her to
the Parlours any more than before, she said.
Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol believes that this project
should have been "weighed against," in his opinion,
more important "budgetary priorities."
Senior Vi Truong noted that the extravagance of the
Parlours stood in stark contrast to the more modest
lounges in most dorms, giving visitors a false impression.
But Stewart-Winter ultimately came through for the
Parlours.
"At first I thought it was a bit fancy," he said, but
"Swarthmore as an institution has a mission to improve
my upward mobility," only half-kiddingly, referring to
the genteel feel of the new Parlours.
Martin Greenhouse
The greenhouse received an eagerly-awaited total
makeover, the culmination of a long lobbying effort on
the part of the plant physiologists in the Biology De-

partment.
The old greenhouse was as primitive of a greenhouse
as one could get, according to Professor Colin
Purrington, one of the plant physiologists who will be
using the greenhouse. "It was a greenhouse," he said,
"but not a greenhouse where you could do world-class
research."
The headhouse, the area adjacent to the greenhouse
itself where the plants were worked on, simply constituted a couple of fluorescent lights dangling from the
wall, plugged into surrounding outlets, as well as some
2x4s that served as benches.
In fact, a greenhouse renovation was one of the conditions on which Swarthmore lured Purrington away
from the University of Chicago, but the condition was
not fulfilled until now.

The new greenhouse will feature a new canopied entrance thatbegins on the side of Martin closest toLPAC.
Previously professors and students would have to enter the greenhouse via the choice of two laboratories.
Both the headhouse and the greenhouse will be enlarged. A new partition will be added to the greenhouse
to complement the existing one. In the greenhouse, a
new hard floor will replace the previous stone and
gravel floor. The most prominent addition is a fullyautomated climate control system that, for the first
time, will allow the plant physiologists to simulate different climate conditions in different partitions.
Before the renovations, one of the partitions was sim*
ply so hot that only cacti could be stored in it. In any
case, many of the plants would have died by April because of the heat, ending research activities abruptly,

said Purrington.
The new system features, among other devices,
evaporative water banks made of corrugated cardboard
that will pump water to their surface, which will then
be evaporated with the help of fans installed on the side
of the greenhouse. Part of the new headhouse will also
feature a new office for the head of the greenhouse,
Bill Pinder.
Student Publications Office
In a big boost for student publications on campus,
including The Phoenix, the Publications Office move*
next door to a new and larger space, the old Parrish sth5th
lounge, which often doubled as a makeshift art gallery.
The move, also the product of prolonged lobbying
efforts on the part of both Phoenix editors and the Student Publications Coordinators, was catalyzed by a visit
to the old office by President Bloom, initiated by Phoe-

nix Editor-in-Chief Justin Kane. According to Kane,
Bloom was "shocked" and "appalled" by the conditions
in the office.
"The biggest needs [for publications] are to have
work space and somewhere you can meet," noted
Brendan Nyhan 'OO, Student Publications Coordinator.
The old office, in addition to its bad location, was failing in both regards. The old office had no meeting
space, and the number of computers was insufficient.
With The Phoenix working around the clock, other publications were given limited use time.
The conditions "were a barrier to staff recruitment
'and retention," said Nyhan. The new office, almost
three times the size of the old office, is much taller,
and brighter, with its numerous windows. A low-level
partition divides the room into a conference area, which
will soon receive an actual conference table and a work
area where computer stations and other equipment are
located.
New computer purchases are also in-the-works. Besides the new partition, Facilities Management, also
brought in actual computer tables for the computers,
formerly used in the Sproul computer lab.
While the summer rush may be over, Stuart Hain's
work continues. Looking ahead to the rest of this year,
Hain and his staff will be participating in the continuing planning process for the DuPont renovations.
Right now that process is still in its conceptual stage,
with the planning committee considering differentproposals to modify the building. None of the proposals,
Hain notes, though, will entail the destruction of any
part of the building. Hain anticipates a starting date of
Summer 2001 for DuPont.

"I was totally surprised
when I arrived on campus," said Morgan Holt

The construction, which
was supposed to have
been completed before
this year's freshmen arrived on campus, is the
result of the college's attempt to make the campus
compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA). The act, passed in
1990, requires that campus facilities (including
parking lots, paths, buildings, and bathrooms,
among others) be accessible to the disabled.

It was a totally Faustian deal, one
that we'd been living with pretty
happily for going on twenty years.
Every summer, from Memorial Day
to Labor Day, Hollywood unleashed
its latest round of increasingly overhyped big-budget special-effects
spectaculars, and every summer we
went to see them, claiming we were
there just for the air conditioning,
but really we went because we liked

of flus and monsoons, and our
appetites for these zillion-dollar
extravaganzas had the calculus of a
good solid drug addiction: with each

higher, the explosions got way, way
better. Movies were measured out by
the heaping handful; quality got all
confused with quantity.

The summer's biggest hits, the
sequels to "Star Wars" and "Austin

anomalies, as they opened to readymade audiences, mostly long lines of

ticket and gotten to know a local barber, all in French. I had snow-skied
and water-skied in the French Alps,
heard Celine Dion sing in French and
witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime solar
eclipse near Paris.
And I had conversations that truly
touched me. My French friend, a
teenager, told of how tears welled up
in his eyes whenFrance finally won
the World Cup in 1998. My second
cousin in Israel was near tears as she
spoke of how upset Israel's loss of
the Golan Heights would make her,
while questioning whether the fighting and loss of lives was worth it.
When my Israeli friend explained
that in Israel, you have to wait to receive your license in the mail before
driving, I told him that in New York,
you can start driving right after the
an honestroad test. His reaction
to-goodness, "Only in America..."
How would I convey back home
what it felt like to hear that?
Moreover, just how long would it
be before these sharp memories began to fade?

Pointless gore of "13th Warrior" makes it forgettable
By Gabriel Hankins

A bloody mess of a movie,
"The 13th Warrior" is derived
from Michael Crichton's novel
"Eaters of the Dead" but ends
up as a boring, violent tale
riddled with inconsistencies
and lacking emotional
backbone. The carnage is wellproduced at times, but it
simply cannot make up for
poor acting and weak writing.
For more movie listings, see
pg.

14.

Some movies hardly qualify as tangible
cinema; while they have an immediate
presence, you'll likely remember them as
nothing more than a bad dream, a shadowy
concoction of gags and blood and not much
plot.
"The 13thWarrior" is one such movie. It
surfaces, it kills, it eats, it pauses for imand
plausible love once or twice, it kills
then it recedes into darkness.
The film, derived from Michael
Crichton's "Eaters of the Dead," has its origins in the first-hand account of a 10th-century Arabic poet, Ibn Fahdlan. Fahdlan,
played by Antonio Banderas, has been exiled to an ambassadorship in a distant Germanic land because of an illicit desire.
While traveling, he encounters a band of
northern warriors who tell of demons that
have been terrorizing their town
un-

and disappear with the light. The
Norsemen enlist Fahdlan as the pre-ordained foreigner who is necessary for vic-

tory.
After a few days of warrior camp, in
which Banderas's Arabic turns to Spanishaccented English, the battles begin. Many
men die creatively and gruesomely. The
earth goddess and the crazy fortune-teller
woman show up to splash some blood.
Women appear to comfort the bloody and
love the victorious. Many more men die.
And that's about it.
In the gaps between fighting, the movie
superficially touches on the philosophical
waxings of the poet Fahdlan. These men

are struggling for the truth and fighting
for victory yet are almost indistinguishable from the beasts they fear in the heat
of battle. To die valorously and be remem-

known beings that come down with the fog

bered in epic prose, this is above all their
goal.
Admittedly, there are moments that carry
resonance, albeit the gore-spackled resonance of Tarantino and anime\ In the climactic battle scene, the director creates
psychological mayhem out of the warriors'
prayers and arching slow-motion choreography. The violence is as graceful and overwhelming as that in any Kurosawa or John
Woo film, and an added effect is a sense of
the Valhalla that awaits the warriors, as it
surely must in this Wagnerian setting. The
bloody battlefields are also places of bravery, places where the courageous cut off
each other's limbs for sport, then laugh,
reattach them and sit down to dine together.
Still, blood can only go so far. The true
emotions the film could have capitalized
on fear and doubt are absent. It is that
missing emotional backbone that makes
"The 13th Warrior" nothing more than a
grisly apparition, a movie best forgotten.

Esteemed political scientist James Q. Wilson
will kick off the schedule of Cooper Series events
this year, lecturing about contemporary liberalism on Friday, Sept. 17, at 1 p.m. on the Lang Performing Arts Center main stage.
The UCLA professor will give a talk entitled
"Moral Intuitions" in addition to participating in
a handful of campus events throughout the course
of the day.
The Cooper Foundation will sponsor and fund
Wilson's visit at the proposal of Nate Stulman 'Ol.
Wilson will be the first of three lecturers in a series entitled "Rethinking Contemporary Liberalism" and will engage in a critique of contemporary liberalism from the multi-disciplinary perspective of morality.
The purpose of the series, as described by
Stulman in his proposal, is "to stimulate campuswide discussion about the status and merits of
liberalism in contemporary America."
When asked to elaborate on "liberalism,"
Stulman was quick to specify.
"I mean 'liberal individualism,' the focus on
individual rights at the expense of individualand/
or collective responsibility and at the expense of
the community," said Stulman.
Indeed, Wilson and fellow speakers and
Harvard professors Juliet Schor and William
Julius Wilson share a skepticism of policies that
put the interests of individual over the interests
of the community as a whole.
Wilson's perspective will be "ideologically more
conservative than many of his contemporaries,"
Stulman said, "but his criticism of liberalism will
be one of the most poignant and interesting."
In addition, Stulman spoke highly of Wilson's
writing style.
"He is a witty and engaging social critic," he
said. "He writes for a wider audience than just
the academic, [and he] will speak to a wider au-

and too extensive for departmentalization."
Swarthmore political science professor James
Kurth agreed with Stulman's assessment.
"(James Q. Wilson) is one of the two to three
most distinguished political scientists of the second half of the 20th century," said Kurth.
Wilson's expertise is in government and political science. His 11-page resume lists a number of
honors and published works, and the average
Swattie may recognize him as the author of the
widely used AP Government high school textbook,
"American Government." He has been the James
A. Collins Professor of Management at UCLA since
1985 and was a professor of government at
Harvard University for 26 years before that.
He served on a variety of White House advisory committees on law enforcement and social
justice in the late 1960s and has been credited
with developing intellectual strategies that have
led to recent urban renewal.
"There's probably no other political scientist
in the country...who has had so much influence
on public policy," Swarthmore political science
professor Rick Vallely said.
Most recently, The New York Times praised his
latest book, "The Moral Sense," for its "unusual
ability to mobilize the findings of empirical researchers so as to provide answers to questions
important to the rest of us."
Incidentally, Professor Wilson's talk will focus
on more than just his field of expertise. The foundation of his topic, morality, stems from the questions posed by 18th -century moral philosophers
like Hutcheson, Smith and Hume. In applying the
idea of a universal morality to contemporary liberalism, Professor Wilson will cite psychological,
sociological and anthropological research. From
this base, he will extend the discussion to a critique of government policy.
Professor Wilson will also hold a post-lecture
question-and-answer session and attend a catered
reception open to the Swarthmore community in
the lobby of LPAC to engage in discussion with
students.

Summer recordings bring out indie bands' best work
Joan of Arc, Marine Research,
American Analog Set top lists
with summer music releases
By Patrick Boe
For The Phoenix

Joan ofArc

“Live in Chicago, 1999”

Jade Tree
In the summer ot

1999, two high-profile

emo bands from Chicago put out records.
Two bands brought all
their cuffed jeans,
their blocky glasses
and their college degrees in Communications to bear on the
musical challenge that was the exploding Chicago
art-rock scene.
The two bands, Joan of Arc and The Promise Ring,
abused their screwed-up voices through one more
bout of screamy post-angst. Only one band made a
good album.
While the Promise Ring came out with a record
of pretty disappointing watered-down alternative
rock, Joan of Arc’s “Live in Chicago, 1999” brought
the band into a new, wonderfully experimental domain. The album, recorded entirely in a studio (the
“live” in the name rhymes with “give”), strips down
the heavy guitars and screaming of previous albums. In some places they are left intact, but the
space is often filled instead with weirdly-constructed noise courtesy of sound engineer Casey
Rice.
For some reason, these blips, clicks, and whooshes
often fit perfectly into the bursts of constipated
screaming, but the better moments are when the

or fourth time, like in the case of "Helplessness to

sometimes abrupt changes render the whole arti-

fice of the recording very obvious.
The cerebral, nonsensical wordplay of JOA's earlier albums continues in abundance. Tim Kinsella
scream-sings things like "To a to be to see and wonder that is yours for now" and "If you're not bound,
you're only on the rebound," and "Don't regret forgetfulness, forget regretfulness."
And the art in the liner notes? Scenes from "Weekend," the classic of counter-cinema, here reenacted
on an elementary school stage. Of course the record
is pretentious, but extremes of pretension this great
deserve some hearty applause.

Marine Research has put out a few singles already,
and they have been touring like madcats, but “Sounds
From the Gulf Stream” is their first full-length. It is
solid enough to confirm all the hopes that must have
sprung out of the work they have done so far.
Really, it is just pretty gem after pretty gem on
this album, with lush, full sounds and rich
songwriting to be found just about everywhere. I
found it hard to get through the whole thing in one
go, because I kept moving the record needle back
to listen to the song I had just heard a second, third

guide

Hopelessness."
Sweet, wistful lines like, "I still want to hear you
end your half-finished pop songs, I still want to be
who I am but be it with you" are just so hard to pass
by without a second listen. Chimes and liquid drops
of sound are liberally sprinkled throughout. There
is no way to hear two songs on this album and then
decide not to buy right away.

When a record
comes
out whose

chimes, mellophones,
and guitars are so
similar to each other
that it's hard to figure
out which is which, it's
a good record. Never
mind the self-glorifying name; "The Golden Band" is such an album.
It's a long line of quiet, introverted songs of muted
beauty that would make absolutely perfect makeout music. Everything about it is tentative, excited,
curious. Small, buzzy Casios flood through the caring tenor vocals and among restrained drumbeats.
Piano notes and chimes lap about. It all makes for a
record that could be either hopeful or distressing,
depending on your mindset, the quality of light in
your room or just about any other external factor.
This is not music to force your friends to put on
at a party (this is something I did, because I had
just bought it, had not heard it and was all excited)
because it will lull conversation, put people to sleep,
send them out onto the balcony to think about their
futures or encouragerandom couplings between the
guests. This is music to put on when one of the above
has already happened and added poignancy is
needed.

Student Council vans leave from Parrish East circle for AMC Marple 10 every half hour
from 7-10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday.The last van trip returning to Swarthmore leaves
the theatre at I a.m.

"Stigmata"
R. 102 minutes.
Starring Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne.

7:50,10:15

Patricia Arquette plays a young hairdresser prone to violent and bloody paranormal
attacks. Driven toward an MTV audience,"Stigmata" is more a collection of bloody images
than a coherent movie.

"Bowfinger"
PG-13.97 minutes.
Starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather
Graham.

7:30,9:50

Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy play director and actor in a farce about Hollywood
filmmaking. Martin can't nab hot-shot Murphy for the title role in his schlock movie, so he
instead frames Murphy into unknowingly acting out his scenes and hires a dimwitted
lookalike (also Murphy) to fill in the gaps. Expect ticklish if not gut-busting laughs.

"Chill Factor"
R.
Starring Cuba Gooding jr. and Skeet Ulrich.

8:10,9:30

Cuba Gooding Jr. stars in this "Speed" on ice. A chemical warfare weapon will detonate at
50 (degrees) and blow up half of (Montana), so Cuba must keep his (ice cream truck) out
of trouble or else (Montana) blows up. Expect this mail merge movie to melt as fast as
Cuba's stock of ice cream.

"Stir of Echoes"
R. 99 minutes.
Starring Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe and Kevin Dunn.

7:50, 10:15

Following the lead of"Sixth Sense," "Stir of Echoes" stars Kevin Bacon as a Chicago
telephone lineman whose hypnotic supernatural sessions reveal a world of, you guessed it,
dead people.

"In Too Deep"
R. 106 minutes.
Starring Omar Epps, LL Cool j and Pam Grier.

8:05, 10:30

Omar Epps plays a young undercover cop whose emotions test his ability to fight the
teeming underworld of Cincinnati as he tries to take down the city's biggest gangster.The
film, though powerful in spots, ultimately fails because of poor dialogue and character
development

"Inspector Gadget"
PG. 85 minutes.
Starring Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett and Joely
Fisher

3:15

This unanimated remake of the Gadget cartoon series won't let you reclaim your
childhood. Rather, it will claim your $6.50, and give in return a good guy, a bad guy, a
spunky girl and no plot whatsoever.

"Mickey Blue Eyes"
PG-13. 102 minutes.
Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan and Jeanne Trippiehorn.

7:10,9:45

Hugh Grant plays one type of character, but he certainly plays it well.As a Brit in the Big
Apple, Grant's genteel ways are tested when he meets his fiancee's extended mob
family. Predictable and cheesy,"Mickey Blue Eyes" is still a simple, fulfilling romantic
comedy.

"Outside Providence"
R. 95 minutes.
Starring Alec Baldwin, Sara Gilbert and Shawn Hatosy.

8:00, 10:20

As a bum teenager shipped off to prep school in the post-Watergate years,Timothy Dunphy
(Shawn Hatosy), discovers just how narrow his world is. For a film advertised as being "from
the people who brought you 'Dumb and Dumber' and There's Something About Mary',"
"Outside Providence" goes soft on the plot but still makes you laugh your ass off.

7:00,9:40

In this "Pretty Woman" reunion, Richard Gere is a USA Today columnist covering Julia
Roberts's nasty habit of abandoning grooms at the altar.The movie is nothing like its
energetic predecessor, but it floats nonetheless on tried-and-true plot turns, little-old-lady

humor and Robert's wonderful, if not hackneyed smile.

"The Sixth Sense"
PG-13. 107 minutes.
Starring Bruce Willis, OliviaWilliams and Haley
Osment.

7:20.9:55

Joel

If you've heard about "The Sixth Sense," you already know the premise. If you haven't,
suffice it to say,"l see dead people." If you go, you'll see more than just dead people; you'll
see a tantalizing, confusing, intelligent, overloaded horror film with a killer ending.Arrive
early because this one is selling out theaters.

Burning rubber: road testing
condoms for a safer America

Familiar supplants foreign after time abroad

By Brad Keller

Inferior, or just different?
Boarding the plane to New
York in Paris, I overheard an
American saying he couldn't
wait to get home, that he was
so excited to be returning.
Returning. That's pretty much
how I felt after my first trip
to Paris, two summers ago.
But that trip lasted just a
week. Spending more than
half a year abroad, you can't
help but consider things dif-

The Pitt News (U. of Pittsburgh)

(U-WIRE)

Don't let the

headline fool you. I did not research this article by running
over prophylactics with my
car. What I did was test five
brands of ultra sensitive
condoms. You know, like, with
women and all.
The five brands I tested

Ultra
were Lifestyles
TroSensation,
Kimono,
Thin
jan ENZ, Avanti Super Thin,
and Naturallambs, all of
which are available to purchase at Eckerd Drugs on
Forbes Avenue or at the Stu-

dent Pharmacy on the fifth
floor on the Medical Arts
Building on Fifth Avenue. I
chose the extra sensitive
brands because, well, as a
man, I like to get as close as
possible to the natural feeling,
but not have to worry about
contracting anything terminal, like an unwanted pregnancy.
All condoms are rated on a
system I invented called the
Dikter Scale. For those of you
who are familiar with the
Richter scale of rating earthquakes, it's a similar system.
For those of you who aren't,
the joke isn't as funny.
Lifestyles Ultra Thin Sensitive: I have lived the majority
of my sexual life believing
that latex was inventedby vindictive scientists. They
wanted us foolish, promiscuous ingrates to have as little
sensation as possible and not
be able to reproduce because
they were bitter that we were
getting laid and they weren't.
However, if you're going the
latex route, this is the condom
for you. It's the best science
has done with the worst substance possible. This one gets
a 5.7 on the Dikter Scale. The
best of the best of what's out
in latex.
Kimono: I have nothing
good to say about this condom.
I have nothing bad to say
about it either. It's completely
average in every way. And
since the Japanese are already killing us with cheaply
produced steel, why kill your
sensation by buying their
cheaply produced prophylactics? If you're the exciting
type that looks to buy a Toyota
Corolla after graduation, this

is the rubber for you. I give it
a 3.9 on the Dikter Scale. Just
enough to shake the bed.
Trojan ENZ: Trojan uses a
horse to market its products.
Evidently, it's to market their
condoms to men with horselike endowments also. This
condom was by far the worst
tested. It was large and cumbersome and I plan to use my
remaining ENZs as Windbreakers when temperatures
begin to fall. This should be an
indication of its ability to insulate one from the outside
environment. Trojan gets a 3.2
on the Dikter Scale. Mainly
based on its ability to double
as the newest craze in winter
fashion.
Avanti Non-latex: The
Avanti Non-latex is advertised
as a non-latex condom. Apparently instead of latex, they
used some manner of roofing
insulation. I could have been
six blocks away watching antelope mate on the Discovery
channel and felt a more pleasing sensation. Here's a tip for
Avanti: next time, don't use
fiberglass. It gets a 4.6 on the
Dikter Scale, since it does protect you from the elements
and doesn't jump the latex
bandwagon.
Naturallambs: I've poked a
lot of fun at latex in this article. I've also poked a lot of
holes in latex, which has lead
to many tense moments with
the comforting men and
women of the suicide hot line.
But that's a story for another
time. Naturallambs is a condom made from sheep intestines. While this may seem
like a marketing ploy geared
towards well-hung West Virginians who want their sheep
intestines to touch their
sheep's intestines, it isn't.
What it is is the best, most
natural- feeling condom I
tested. One thumb up! Way
up! Naturallambs wins with
an 8.2 on the Dikter Scale. It
does to sheep intestines what
the Scottish dish haggis tried
to do but failed.
It's been an exhausting two
weeks, but I came out of it
with my head held high. It's
my hope that by writing this
article, I helped you to make
an informed decision to bring
about the best of a bad situation: compulsory condom usage.

Summer movies herald coming

me a lot of Nicholas Roeg's "Don't Look Now"
(1973), a really beautiful and suggestive thriller about a
couple mourning their drowned daughter
in, of all places,
Venice. (It's most often remembered for its extended sex
scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie their
aii-too-real-looking lovemaking is intercut with banal shots

slow
hallucinatory unraveling to them, a patient way of
revealing their horrors. They spread and stain like spilt ink.
&WI, the big twist at the end of "The Sixth Sense" unmasks it
as just a really good version of "Ghost."
Its not my intention here to proclaim the death of blockouster, nor to herald some new Hollywood renaissance of
counter cinema. The blockbuster will continue to bloat;
Hollywood will persist in flattering imitation rather
than
rewarding novelty.
What was proven this summer was that hype beats all
nands and that buzz
that little birdie that tells you

and-joy high-speed train,
which has run between Paris
and the provinces for over
twenty years. That technology will finally arrive in the
U.S. next year
on just one
line. France has a nationwide,
standardized system of pharmacies, and the country's
health care system, from
what I've heard, is excellent.
The whole country also has
embraced the "Minitel," a
simple, black-and-white computer terminal used by everyone
not just the technological elite
to access on-line
services.
At the same time, many
bathrooms in France, even in
restaurants, lack hot water,
soap and/or
toilet

seats. Very few people have
caught on to the idea of wearing a bicycle helmet. And
pity the health conscious
"low-fat" anything is almost
non-existent.
During my first trip to
France, what I noticed as different was "silly" or "inferior." Living there, though, my
eyes opened a little more, and
I found myself wondering on
many occasions: "Hmmm...
why don't we have that?"

STUDY

A nice place to visit...
My world in France was full
of charm, and I almost always
found something intriguing to
explore, if not just contemplate. Upon returning to the
U.S., however, I found my life
here, well, just as it was.
There was some news
a
maniac had recently opened
fire on a Jewish center in Los
Angeles, and a guy named
Ricky Martin, who appeared
out of nowhere, was now immensely popular but otherwise, life was pretty much as
I had left it.
Now, as yet another semester back at Swarthmore gets
under way, I can't help but get
somewhat nostalgic. France
wasn't perfect for me
I'd
never want to settle down
there but it was a home.
I miss French music on the
radio. I miss the country's
beautiful parks, with old men
playing "boules" (bocce). I
miss the terrific train network, and, laugh if you will, I
sorely miss my baguettes.
It's okay, though; I'll be
back. And besides
I've
taken a lot of it with me.

Football team: 'The streak stops now"
From FOOTBALL, pg. I

"I can't even describe how
great the feeling from finally
winning is," said Neff.
The win was also the first at
Swarthmore for second-year
head coach Pete Alvanos, who
came to Swarthmore from the
University of Chicago.
"I'm numb—just completely

overwhelmed," said Alvanos

after the game. "Today was a
day of firsts, and I just feel tremendous."
Alvanos has orchestrated a
turn-aroundof sorts in the football program. The team had
dropped to as few as 28 players the year before he arrived
—this year, the team carries 51.
But perhaps his greatest feat
hasbeen changing attitudes towards football at Swarthmore.
"We just wanted the kids to
believe
in themselves,"
Alvanos said. "When they
bought in, they got into the
weight room and started improving."
Heads were turned in Parrish
Hall as well, where a visit from
a number of returning and
former players brought increased support from the administration.
"[Playing] football at a small
school is a struggle," said Dean
Bob Gross, who watched the
victory from the Swarthmore
sidelines. "It's not easy to maintain a winning program, but
we're committed to it, and we
have put the resources into it."
"The team has worked hard,
and they deserve success," continued Gross. "But the reality
is that we won't go 9-0, and this
isn't Happy Valley. We're just
trying to get it back to the right
balance."
Gross's comments seem to
reflect the current sentiment
on campus, where debates over
whether to field a football team

"Nobody wants to
support you when you're
losing, 70-0, every week."
have been raging on and off for
more than 100 years. Student
attendance at last Saturday's
game well exceeded any in recent memory, and numerous
team members commented
that they perceived increased
student support this season.
"It feels like the student body
has embraced the football
team," said placekicker Rob
Castellucci 'Ol. "Nobody wants
to support you when you're losing, 70-0, every week, but now
that's changed. It's like we're a
real football team now."
Some students wondered
whetherthe support would continue, however.
"Storming the field is a great
feeling after two years, but I
don'tknow if it will spill over,"
said Matt Murphy 'Ol. "Not
with the same enthusiasm, at
least."
Regardless, the Garnet Tide
cannot relax too soon. Next Saturday they open their Centennial Conference schedule in
Baltimore against Johns
Hopkins, the nation's No. 5
ranked Division 111 football

team.
Alvanos, typically confident,

isn't ready to wave the white
flag just yet.
"Don't you worry," said
Alvanos. "We'll have a game
plan worked up for Johns
Hopkins."

New coach, new faces jump start women's soccer
Swarthmore kicks off season with 3-1 record after handling Alvernia, Marywood and Widener
By Sari Altschuler
For The Phoenix

With a 3-2 defeat in overtime over Widener University
on Wednesday, the women's
soccer team advanced to 3-1.
Even before the games began,
the team was looking especially strong with the key additions of coach Amy Brunner
and nine players. Add the returning veterans and the team
was ready for the new season.
This fall, Coach Brunner has
been instrumental in shaping
the team. Her mixture of
friendliness, goal-oriented focus, support, and commitment
has helped make practices
and games enjoyable and
valuable learning experiences. Her dedication to preparing the team by means of
a balance of drills and game

Despite the loss of a few
key graduating seniors,

uniform this year.
situations has given confidence to the women who play
for her. Merry Lubking will be
assisting Brunner.
Despite the loss of a few key
graduating seniors, the Swarthmore women have gained
immediate impact players in
the many new faces that will
wear the Garnet uniform this
year. Lizzy Pike 'O3, Carolynn
Laurenza 'O3 and Karly Ford
'O3 have already demonstrated strong resistance to
Swarthmore opponents in the
back field. In the midfield,
Claire Hoverman 'O3 and Liz
Brainard 'O3 are displaying
strong skills. Likewise, E.B.
Fortier 'O3 poses a serious
threat to the competitors' defense, often dribbling right
through them. Other strong
contributions from the Class
of 2003 include Jenn Hart and
Erica Kaufman on defense.
The Swarthmore women
have the strong leadership of
co-captains Becca Schmidt
'OO, Kate Doty 'OO and Sarah

Jay 'Ol. The three captains
have demonstrated their skills
at bringing the team together
both on and off the field. During games, their enthusiasm
and support for their fellow
team members helps keep the
team upbeat and working hard
even during matches against
tougher teams. During practice, the atmosphere has been
enjoyable yet dedicated.
In the season opener against
Alvernia, the Swarthmore defense was virtually untested.
The team completely dominated the opponent's field,
shutting them out with a score
of 5-0. After the game, Jay
observed that meeting a lesschallenging team first was
beneficial for Swarthmore.
"Starting out with that game
was good because we really
got to see the strengths of all
of our players," she commented. "I was very impressed by our first team trial.
I think it showed us some
things we needed to work on
but also showed great hope for
this season."
The following match—the
Swat Kick Classic, an annual
tournament played on the first
weekend of the school year—proved to be slightly more
challenging. Despite playing
Marywood, a stronger opponent than Alvernia, the first
game went well. Swarthmore
once again dominated the first
round, finishing up with a
score of 5-1. The team turned
in a strong performance, highlighted by Schmidt, Annalise
Paaby 'OO, Fortier, Brainard
and Michelle Lowry 'O2. Sarah
Nusser 'O2 impressed the fans
with an outstanding performance, including a threeheader hat trick.
The final round of the tournament, however, presented a
challenge for the Garnet. Although both keepers, Emily
Manetta 'OO
and Sari
Altschuler 'Ol, turned away
many difficult shots, the Garnet was defeated by Montclair
State
5-1.
Swarthmore
claimed second place for the
third year in a row.
With a winning record and
a host of exciting additions,
the Swarthmore women's soccer team looks forward to a
promising season. Their next
game is against Ursinus on
