College faces cuts with a
$700,000 deficit looming
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

The president's staff met Tuesday morning to propose
and discuss ideas for how to cut about $1 million from next
year's budget. As the college prepares its 2003-2004 budget,
it is facing tight constraints and a projected deficit of
roughly $700,000. The endowment is down, and insurance
and utilities costs are rising rapidly.
While students on the College Budget Committee (CBC)
and administrators emphasized that there is no official list
of cuts on the table yet, Vice President for Administration
Larry Schall, at the Student Council (SC) meeting Monday
night, named a number of cuts he could make in areas he
oversees, including ending dinner meal equivalencies at
Tarble and stopping the employment of special-needs individuals for clean-up jobs in Sharpies.
Dean of the College Bob Gross did not share specifics on
what student services might face cuts. But, "I'm not terribly hopeful that we can do it just with cutting around the
edges," he said.
This is the second time departments have been asked to
make cuts in the past year.

Based on concerns over the declining endowment and
the troubling state of the stock market, the college asked

departments to tighten their belts last spring, and cut their
budgets by five percent. "Last year, what we did was make
some cuts in order to preserve flexibility for new programs
this year," Gross said. "We weren't working under quite
the sense of urgency that we're working under now."
Over the summer, it became clear that the budget situation this year would end up worse than anticipated. Some
costs shot up unexpectedly. Health insurance for faculty
and staff increased 20 percent. Property insurance will
cost $400,000 this year, up from $140,000 last year. Utilities
were up over $500,000 from two years ago. These expenses,
Welsh said, are ones that "we don't have much choice
over."
The college is absorbing those increases this year with-

out any sudden cuts. After a September budget review, the
Board of Managers (BOM) agreed to take $879,000 out of a
college reserve account to keep the budget in the black this
year. The college is already dipping more deeply into its
endowment than it has in the past decade.
Student Council Co-President Ryan Budish 'O4 was an
observer at the September BOM meeting. "They discussed
this impending budget issue and one person did raise dipping into the endowment, but it was quickly struck down,"
he said.

"I'm not terribly hopeful that we can
do it just with cutting around
the edges."
Dean of the College Bob Gross '62
The endowment, which peaked at $1 billion in 2000, is

down to about $B3O million, Welsh said.
Next year, she expects the college to have more money
available to spend than it did this year. "But that amount
of growth isn't enough to handle all these cost increases,"
she added. "We'll have to reduce some things in order to
make room for these cost increases."
The college has an operating budget of more than $BO
million this year— and that's not including the funds spent
on science center construction. As a result, a large, as yet
unspecified portion of money could be shifted around.
The question, administrators said, is how. Eldridge and
Welsh emphasized the college's desire not to touch expenses that go toward the college's core priorities.
"The academic program and some of the student services are priorities," Welsh said. Financial aid will also go
unaffected, she said.

Where the deficit came from
Post-Sept. 11 stock market and insurance rates played primary roles
BY MATTHEW FITTING

mfittinl@Swarthmore.edu

Rising health and property insurance premiums, an
ailing endowment and a turbulent stock market all contributed to the college’s current financial difficulties,
and, taken as a whole, present the argument that a year
and a few months later, Swarthmore is feeling more
tangibly than ever the

nationwide
economic
effects of Sept. 11
News Analysis
Despite a deficit of about
$900,000 this year, and a projected $700,000 deficit for
next year if no cuts are made, Vice President for the
Administration Larry Schall was quick to point out that
other colleges across the country are faring much worse.
But Swarthmore’s current state, he said, like those of
other colleges across the country, “is all Sept. 11 driven.”
Reinsurance companies, which usually cover larger
companies and institutions of higher learning, “got
massacred” in the stock markets directly following last
year’s attacks, Schall said, with property insurance premiums in particular that have risen, in Swarthmore’s
case, from $140,000 last year to $430,000 this year.
Rising Utility costs, which have shot up more than

$500,000 in the last two years, also played a factor. The
utility market's situation, however, is not completely
related to Sept. 11 Pennsylvania's deregulation of its
energy market has also contributed. According to
Schall, when the state originally deregulated in 1994,
"for three minutes the price went down," then most
companies that had helped to make a more inexpensive,
choice-driven market withdrew their services. Now the
college, like most of Pennsylvania, is back to using the
Pennsylvania Energy Company (PECO), who the college also used before the state's deregulation.
The utility market, however, like the reinsurance
market, is likewise linked to the nation's ailing stock
market, which has proved tumultuous during the recession of the last few years, and especially turbulent after
last year's terrorist attacks.
In addition, according to Sue Welsh, vice president for
finance and treasurer , said falling insurance rates have
meant a lower rate of return for the college's nearly $BO
million operating budget. These rates, too, relate to the
ailing stock market.
Asked about the state of the national economy, and
his hopes for when and if it will recover or return to its
post-Sept. 11 status, Schall said, "I have no idea."
He added, "It'd be nice to think my pension won't
keep coming down."

Housing committee
debates substance-

free dorms
BY JULIA POMPETTI

jpompetl@swarthmore.edu
At its meeting on Nov. 4, the Housing Committee discussed the idea of substance-free housing. They talked
about whether there was a precedent for the idea and
about what form the housing would take on a small college campus like Swarthmore's.
It did not, however, reach a formal decision, and
aims to gauge student opinion on the issue through a
survey which is being distributed in Sharpies and
through campus mail.
The surveys ask students whether they perceive a
need for substance-free housing, what location they'd
choose for such housing, and whether they prefer the
"space" or "lifestyle" version of substance-free housing.
Residents of a "lifestyle" substance-free dorm would
agree not to smoke, drink alcohol or use illegal drugs.
The "space" version of the proposal would only prohibit substance use within the designated substance-free
space.
David Mister 'O4, a member of the Housing
Committee subcommittee that is working on the issue,
explained why some students supported the move. "I
think students' reasons for wanting substance-free
housing are varied," he said. "But the one I've heard
most often, and would put forth myself, is that there
aren't a lot of social circles or events on campus that
don't involve alcohol, either tangentially (most Paces
parties) or centrally (Pub Nite). Believe it or not, there
are students who attend Swarthmore who don't consume alcohol, be it for personal or medical reasons or, a
more general philosophical aversion."

"I don't see this campus as such a
drug- and alcohol-saturated place
that you can't find a space. Just
don't live in Willets."
Mathew Louis-Rosenberg 'O5
Jim Maiolo 'O3, another subcommittee member,

reinforced this sentiment. "I see the most important
aspect here as the creation of a strong and supportive
community for people seeking alternative modes of
recreation," he said.
Mister hoped that "some form of substance-free
housing would give these students a place to go that's
free from the intrusions of alcohol, smoke or other
drugs. It can furnish some sort of social group with the
one common thread of being substance-free, which in
other contexts may ostracize students rather than wel-

come them."
Some students, however, don't see the need to designate housing as substance-free. Mathew LouisRosenberg 'O5 believed substance-free friendly space is
already available. "I don't see this campus as such a
drug- and alcohol-saturated place that you can't find a
space," he said. "Just don't live in Willets."
Some believe substance-free housing is taking
Swarthmore's ivory tower mentality to an extreme.

Louis-Rosenberg added, "If you can't handle living in
the same building as someone who might go somewhere
and imbibe something then you need to live off campus.
You're not going to be able to surround yourself with
people who don't do drugs in the real world."
Others believed that substance-free housing would
unduly segregate interest groups, contradicting what
they see as the purpose of the college's small size: to
encourage people with diverse backgrounds and beliefs
to interact and learn from each other.

SC approves referendum
on possible war on Iraq
Issue will be posed to students at the same
time that voting for council positions occurs
object to helping what he predicted

BY GREG NELSON

Emily Mollenkopf Phoenix Staff

Clay Bennett, right, Pulitzer Prize-winner for editorial cartooning, credited artists from
diverse sources such as Eastern Europe and The New Yorker as his chief influences.

Pulitzer-winning cartoonist
offers tips on artistic punditry
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

When Clay Bennett was five years old, he
drew a caricature of his substitute teacher,
Mrs. Bailey, on the blackboard, an action
that got him sent to the principal's office.
This would become a defining event in the
life of the man who would go on to win the
2002 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartoons.
"I was in the principal's office because
of a drawing," he said. "It challenged their
authority and tweaked at the powers that
be. It had turned me from a nobody into a
great school hero."
Bennett presented a multimedia lecture
this Tuesday on "The Art of Heckling." He
spoke of the skills needed to be an editorial

cartoonist and the benefits of the job and
presented 30 of his cartoons
including
some of the drawings that helped him win
the Pulitzer to a packed Scheuer Room.
Philadelphia Daily News cartoonist
oigne WiiKinson introduced Bennett.
"Whereas many of us rely on words to get
our point across, he really plumbed the

visual image," she said.
Wilkinson detailed the long career that
led up to Bennett's garnering the Pulitzer
this year. Bennett began his work at the
University of North Alabama. One year
after graduating, he secured a job at the St.
Petersburg Times in 198 L He is currently

employed by the Christian Science Monitor
and draws five cartoons a week for the
newspaper. His works are available in color

in the Monitor and on his Web site.
Bennett first spoke about the use of
words in his cartoons. As a cartoonist,
Bennett prefers to express his ideas
through images. "I try to strip the words
out," he said. "I have an affinity for the
pure visual image."
Many of Bennett's cartoons contain just
a single word or phrase that serves to
enhance the effect of the visual images.
After relating his first experiences with
caricatures and detailing his methodology,
Bennett went on to describe his political origins and the environment in which he
learned to hone his opinions. "My father was
an Army lifer and a card-carrying member of
the Republican party," said Bennett, who
grew up in various parts of the South. "My
two sisters were hippies of the '6os. I learned a
lot about politics from both sides of my family. Over the years, I would come to draw on

4

both perspectives for my own political views."
Bennett, as his cartoons show, is clearly
liberal when it comes to the world of
American politics. He believes that cartoons can be very effective in subtly undermining authority. "My earliest influences
were Warner Brothers and Chas Addams'
New Yorker cartoons," he said. "They were
strongly anti-authoritarian in their nature.

The heroes were always the underdogs."
Art from the Eastern Bloc produced during the Cold War has also strongly influenced
Bennett's work. "These cartoonists were
under the incredible pressures of government censorship," he said. "The messages are
so subtle that they are almost subliminal."
With these influences, Bennett knew how

he wanted to disseminate his political views.
"Nothing quite appealed to me like editorial
cartooning," he said. "There are no rigid
rules to cartooning and even fewer in editorial cartooning."
His job has provided Bennett with a wide
spectrum of emotions with which to work.
When the national mood calls for it, an editorial cartoonist can present any side of an
issue, from the somber to the humorous. As
Bennett explained, however, every cartoonist fears "those four words: T don't get it.'"
Before his multimedia presentation,
Bennett outlined the principal rule of cartooning. "Make it insightful. If you can't
make it insightful, make it funny. If you
can't make it insightful or funny, then
make it timely. And if you don't get it, then
it wasn't meant for you," he said.
After the brief talk, Bennett presented some
of his favorite cartoons along with some
images from his
portfolio. He closed out his lecture with a short story
about the subtlety required to get some cartoons past his editors.
"When you get into an argument with
someone, you can shout at them," he said.
"But if you're a little more clever, you can
make fun of them right to their face, and they
won't realize it until they're driving home
later that night. That's how I have to think in
order to get some cartoons past my editors."
Most students in attendance believed
that Bennett, with his Southern drawl, was
a very effective speaker. "A lot of cartoons
seem to say predictable things in predictable ways. When the cartoons aren't
predictable, people get upset," art major
Audrey Chan 'O4 said. "They are afraid of
being challenged."

Stones from Switzerland for a dorm delayed again
BY AVIVA ARON-DINE
aarondil@swarthmore.edu
Construction of the new dorm will be delayed due to
lack of funds, but building materials will arrive in the
from Switzerland. The stone for the dormitory's
spring
exterior will be supplied by the Truffer Quarry, a small
family-owned stone quarry located in the village of Vals, in
the Swiss Alps.
Ordinarily, Swarthmore purchases stone from local
sources. But in this case, the type of stone desired is different. While other buildings on campus have exteriors of
split face stone, stone which is chiseled and split, the plans
for the new dorm call for an exterior of cut stone, stone
which is sawed into smooth blocks.
"We've been working with the architects for two years
with a committee of faculty, staff and students, and this is
what we decided on," said Larry Schall, vice president for
administration. The way the process works, he explained,
is that "you take a design, and then you go off and try to
price the design." But when the college priced the cut
stone, "it came in a lot higher than anticipated." College
representatives went back to the architect and explained
that unless a cheaper source of stone could be found, the
architectural plans would have to be changed.
The architect referred the college to the Truffer Quarry,
which had just supplied the same type of stone for the
famous Thermal Baths in Vals, Switzerland, built in 1996
by renowned architect Peter Zumther "They were set up to
cut it the way we wanted, and so it was a lot cheaper,"
Schall explained. The college will be paying a little more
than $1 million for 130 tons of stone, cut into blocks ranging from three to five feet in height and three to seven feet
in length. The closest bid from a United States company
was several hundred thousand dollars more expensive.
Schall could not say how the price would compare with
the price of an equivalent amount of split stone. "We never
priced the building for split stone," he said.
Even when shipping costs (the stones will be shipped by
boat) are factored in, Schall said, purchasing from the
Swiss company remains far cheaper than the alternatives.
"Stone is generally expensive to move since it's heavy and
bulky and stuff, [but] we're shipping it for a little over
$2,000 per container for about 40 containers. You might pay
$3500 for Utah to Boston," he said. "The shipping costs
will be about $lOO,OOO on a contract of well over a million."
Schall speculated that the relatively low shipping costs
may be due to the slow economy.

Larry Schall journeyed to the Truffer Quarry in Switzerland in order to purchase stones for the new dormitory.
Although plans for construction have been delayed, Schall, a geologist and the architect still made the over-seas trip.

The college decided to go ahead with the stone purchase
even though it is not ready to build the dormitory. "We had
an opportunity to buy the stone for the dorm at sortie savings, several thousand dollars," said Dan West, vice presi-

dent for alumni, development, and public relations. "Even
though we haven't raised the money yet to finance the
dorm, we decided to take advantage." The stone will arrive

Schall has already seen samples of the stone, since he
was part of a delegation of four which flew to Switzerland
early in October and visited the quarry. The other members were a geologist and representatives of the dormitory

According to Schall, the trip to Switzerland was a necessary and normal part of stone selection. "Maybe seven or
eight years ago, we went to Minnesota for Kohlberg," he
recalled. "I've gone to the places where they make the steel

time we've gone overseas
This is our money and they
can't spend our money without us. The architect won't
authorize a purchase without our seeing [the stone]." He
....

added that the cost of his trip was included when the col-

lege compared bids from different stone quarries.
Schall described his days in Switzerland in a detailed
six-page memo which he sent to all staff and faculty. He
explained the need to visit the quarry, writing that "you'd
be amazed at how different the stone from within one of
these quarries can be, depending on where in the quarry it
comes from and how it is prepared. In order to control for
this variation, mock-ups (sample wall sections) are prepared to review and approve."

With the other members of the

delegation, Schall looked

at various mock-ups of wall sections and helped choose
between them. "I was very involved in the process," he said.
When shown around the Baths, Schall was particularly
struck by the attractiveness of a room built with split
stone. He asked the architect to incorporate some split
stone into the design of the new dorm. Thus, in the end, the
college will actually be purchasing and using some Truffer
Quarry split stone, as well as the cut stone which provided
the initial reason for purchasing abroad.
In addition to looking at stone, Schall had a chance to
tour the Baths, climb Mount Zervailhorn, and have dinner
with the renowned architect Peter Zumther. In his memo,
Schall wrote extensively of the warmth and friendliness of
his hosts, Pia and Pius Truffer, and of other members of
the town of Vals.

gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

Two weeks after a white student donned
blackface at a Halloween party, a collection
of the college community met Friday afternoon in LPAC cinema to watch a documentary focusing on the depiction of AfricanAmericans in American pop cultural history

and discuss race relations at Swarthmore.
Associate Dean for Multicultural Affairs
Darryl Smaw and history professors Tim
Burke and Allison Dorsey were the most
vocal of several faculty and administration
members who joined the collection, but student turn-out was less than expected, and
many of the cinema's seats were left
unfilled. "Clearly we were hoping to get
more people to come," said Raphael Zapata
Director of the Intercultural Center.
The

film,

Marlon

Riggs'

"Ethnic

Notions," examines the evolution of
African-American stereotypes in popular
entertainmentfrom the 1840s to the present.
Much of the film focused on the use ofblackmakeup worn by white performers
face
that represented African-Americans as savage, unintelligent, subhuman caricatures,
which was later worn by black performers
forced to mock themselves in order to make
a living on the stage.
-

"Kraig's stereotype that black people

can dance is connected to blackface, slavery and racism,". Dorsey said, referring to
William Kraig 'O4, the student who painted
his face black at the Halloween party. He
later claimed that he did it "jokingly" hoping to "gain some superpowers that would
enable [him] to dance."
"You don't inadvertently put on blackface, you inadvertently bang your shoulder
on the way out the door," Dorsey said.
But much of the discussion focused on
broader issues relating to ethnic diversity
on campus. Katrina Clark 'O3 charged that
more racism exists at Swarthmore than

most of the population is willing to admit.
"Nobody wants to take personal responsibility to deal with their shit, to go through

by them, that they haven't gone through
their shit." Challenged to give an example of
racism she experienced in the classroom,
Clark recalled professors making the
assumption that "a black neighborhood is a
dangerous
neighborhood
where no
Swarthmore student would ever want to go."

question their professors' attitudes
towards race from an intellectual perspective rather than an emotional one. "You

intellectual level
on the emotional level,"
Jeff Wu 'O6 said. "There are these subtle incidents ofracism we never look at," he added.
Chela Delgado 'O3 pointed out that there
were other costumes worn by students at
the Halloween party that she found offensive, including a "lazy Mexican" and a
"Palestinian terrorist."
She pointed out that, in comparison to
the histories ofother races, "the Latino history is equally complex." She added that

Burke cautioned against the "stringing
together of all offensive things" that have a
"separate unique history."
"What strings those things together,"
Dorsey responded, "is what Americans do
around the construction of race."

"What it comes down to is white students

At the close of the collection Smaw
invited those present to join him in a

moment of silence.

Dorsey offers historical perspective on issue
Associate History Professor Allison
Dorsey talked to The Phoenix about
blackface, Amos and Andy and racial
stereotyping.
"You still see some traces of [blackface] in the 1950s Amos and Andy,
which is eventually taken over by black
actors, begins as two white men pretending to be black people living this
real life of Amos and Andy. The
Characters of Amos and Andy are variations on Sambo and Zip Coon, and
when "Amos and Andy" come to television they are still in many ways a blackface routine even though they obviously
aren't wearing blackface It's routed
...

...

in that same racial stereotype.
"The irony is that by the timeAmos
and Andy come to television not only, as
the film 'Ethnic Notions' suggests, is this
an avenue for professional black actors
to work, it has also become part of
some of the concepts of black humor."
"[Amos and Andy] both employs
black actors and entertains white people in a very racist fashion but also
entertains black people who are for the
first time seeing themselves perform on
television. So its sort of a twisted irony."

"The problem is that there is nothing
inherently wrong with black people
doing comedy, there is nothing inherently wrong with black people singing and
dancing, or even, occasionally, playing
the stereotype. The problem is when
that becomes all there is, and that's

what is most frequently celebrated to

the exclusion of all else."
"And certainly Spike [Lee] in
Bamboozled is suggesting that much of
modern television fare to be found on
UPN and WB and FOX are images of people that are far more stereotypic and in
the tradition of rigid blackface kind of
humorthan modem, mature, educated,
political, more dramatic roles."
"When Hattie McDaniels is critiqued
for playing a maid over and over again
in the 19305, the 19405, and into the
1950s she quips quite logically: 'better
to be making $3,000 a week pretending to be a maid, than making $l5 a
week being a maid.' There's something
to that. It is difficult to begrudge people who want to make there living in the
theater... sometimes they have to take
the roles that come along so is it fair to
stand back and say You should not

take that part because it casts black
people in a bad light.'"
"For me the real question is, why
does that type of film that uses stereotypical elements get made over and
over and again. Who are they appealing
to? What's being reinforced? Isn't
there some other way that we can
make Hollywood movies? But that's a
structural argument."
"Americans watch them in general,
. It
collectively Americans watch them
is no longer a case where such films
are just made for a white audience that
is comfortable with negative racial
stereotypes. It does exist, and it's not
going to go anywhere, at least not in my
lifetime. But sadly, from my perspective
some of those traditions and visions
are being absorbed, viewed, celebrated,
by working class black people."
"These [stereotypes] are kept churning in our popular culture so that they
come in the next generation and the next
generation in a rather unthinking fashion,
just sort of free floating in the air. We
could probably do better than that."

Speaker: Traditional medicine survives in South Asia
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
kduongll@swarthmore.edu
"Traditional medicine in South Asia has survived all

kinds of Western medicine and medical plans that did not
include traditional medicine," Helen Sheehan said during
her talk entitled "Contemporary Issues in South Asian
Health and Medicine."

Sheehan is a South Asian studies lecturer at the
University of Pennsylvania. She spoke to a small audience
of 20 people in Kirby Lecture Hall on Monday at 4:30 p.m.,
sharing her views on and experiences with the introduction of Western medicine in South Asia.
The lecture began with slides of some of Sheehan's travels in India since the 19605. During that decade, there was
much excitement about the possibilities for development

in areas like India and Pakistan.
This interest began initiatives for preventive health care
programs in the area. During this time, Sheehan worked
with a group that organized nutrition classes for children as

well as pregnant and nursing mothers in villages.
Sheehan stated that she and others believe that this was
a model system that improved both preventative and current health of the Indian people. The government ran most
hospitals and clinics; all Indian people had access to the
same doctors, regardless of economic class.
This model system, however, did not remain intact as
foreign interests encouraged privatization of hospitals
and clinics. Private institutions led highly qualified
health care professionals away from state health care
facilities, leaving poorer Indians with a lower quality of

6

health care.

Furthermore, India began to experience new waves of
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS
at this time. Sheehan noted that while she was working in
India, the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DTT) was used to deter the mosquitoes. "Little did we
know at the time that DTT was very bad for you," Sheehan
said. Because the use of DTT has been halted, however,
malaria has become worse during the past few decades.
Sheehan emphasized the effect of poverty on the nutrition of the South Asian people. She listed examples of
cities that she traveled through in which garbage was not
even picked up by the municipal departments. Both the
water systems and the environment became polluted during the past couple of decades as industries entered the
area, adversely affecting the nutrition of Indian people and
endangering their health.
Jessica Lee 'O3, who studied abroad in China, agreed with
Sheehan on this issue. "Poverty is the thing that needs to be
solved," she said. "Globalization and privatization were not
necessarily the solutions to the nation's problems."
"The solution that [Sheehan] suggested was rather
large scale and probably not very practical
take care of
but it also makes a good point about how deeply
poverty
ingrained the health problems are," Jyoti Gupta 'O5 said.
Sheehan's lecture also focused on a wide array of topics
concerning traditional medicine. "Western medicine is
very hot and fast," she said. "If you have a fever, it'll cure
the symptoms, but what about the root cause of that fever?
The argument of traditionalmedicine is that it cures more
slowly and

without such drastic action on the
November 14, 2002

body."

She pointed out that China is one Asian country that
has been successful in allowing Western medicine and traditional medicine to coexist.
Finally, Sheehan addressed the role of gender in the
Indian family. Sons are often fed more and given better
health care than daughters. Once abortion became available, pregnant women often aborted female fetuses. "Many
girls do not reach the age of five," Sheehan said.
"I felt that it was a good expository lecture," Gupta said.
"[She] gave what I felt [was] an engaging overview of the
health issues in South Asia. She mostly talked about India,
though I imagine much of the information applies to surrounding countries as well."
Organizer Renuka Nayak 'O4 shared some similar sentiments. "I liked it in the sense that she presented a lot of
topics," she said.
Upon finishing her undergraduate studies, Sheehan
volunteered in the Peace Corps for two years. During this
time, she worked in the Applied Nutrition Program in
Andhra Pradesh, India.
She received a Ph.D. in sociology from Penn and now
teaches courses dealing with health care in South Asia.
Sheehan also researches medical systems in South Asia
and has worked and studied in India and Pakistan.
Sheehan was brought to campus when Sonal Bhatia 'O2,
the Asian outreach coordinator at Penn, recommended to
Nayak that Sheehan speak at Swarthmore. The talk was
organized by Deshi and sponsored by the Forum for Free
Speech and the Pre-Medical Office. Students interested in
taking classes in South Asian Health and Medicine at Penn

were especially encouraged to attend.

Nation's top colleges take steps to alter admissions process
UC schools to begin spotcheck of extracurriculars
of applicants
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.
The
University of California will take a new
approach to applicants' claims of extracurricular activity involvement next year
trust, but verified.
Next fall, UC will phase in a system-wide
program requiring that some applicants'
activities be independently verified. UC
will revoke admission offers from applicants who fail to provide evidence verifying
information in their applications, according to a report issued by the UC Board of

Admissions and Relations with Schools.
A trial run of the program conducted
last year by UC San Diego uncovered only
one instance of unsubstantiated claims out
of a pool of 437 applicants.
"I like the idea," said Berkeley High
School senior and UC applicant Justin
Lawrence. "I can really show them aspects
of my life and what I have to offer them."
The new policy would probably not affect
many students, because they really do participate in extracurricular activities, he added.

The verification system, however, may
leave prospective UC students with a negative impression of the application process,

Berkeley High School college advisor Rory
Bled said.
"I think it's unfortunate, and I don't
know who dreamed this up," she added.
"It shows students we don't trust them
very much."

Yale, Stanford follow
Harvard's lead, end early
decision policy
(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE, Mass. In policy changes that will transform college
admissions, Yale and Stanford Universities
independently announced Wednesday, Nov.
6, that they are eliminating their Early
Decision programs in favor of nonbinding
Early Action starting with next fall's
-

admissions cycle.
Yale President Richard C. Levin and
Stanford President John L. Hennessy cited
abandoning Early

similar reasons for

Decision, arguing that the policy puts too
much pressure on high school students to
make a decision early in their senior year.
"We have been deeply concerned about
the tremendous pressures that talented
young people face as they apply to colleges
like Stanford," Hennessy said. "This new
policy offers those who have set their
hearts on attending Stanford the opportunity to apply early in their senior year,
without the additional pressure of having
to commit before they are ready."
"Early Decision programs help colleges
more than applicants," Levin said. "It is
our hope to take pressure off students in
the early cycle and restore a measure of
reasoned choice to college admissions."
James M. Fallows, whose 2001 Atlantic
Monthly article "The Early Decision
Racket" sparked much of the current controversy over Early Decision, said he
believed that the "trend of history" was
moving against binding admissions.
"When the most prestigious schools say
that this is something they don't need, it
may become seen as a tool of less prestigious schools," he said. "There would be a

factor."
But others suggested that it would be
much more difficult for slightly less prestigious schools to abandon Early Decision,
shaming

because their admissions yields would be
likely to drop substantially.

Early Decision is attractive to colleges
in part because locking in substantial por-

tions of the applicant pool increases yield,
the ratio of admitted students to enrolled
students, which factors prominently in the
annual U.S. News and World Report college

rankings.
Early Decision has been criticized for
privileging wealthy applicants who don't
need to compare financial aid offers from
multiple colleges before making a decision.
Neither Stanford nor Yale mentioned
this factor in their public statements,
although Stanford Assistant Dean of
Admission Marcela M. Muniz said that
Stanford "considered how financial aid
affects a student's decision to consider
other options within the whole scope of
issues."
Early Decision has come under increasing fire over the last two years. The
University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
abolished its Early Decision program last
spring, and Harvard University threatened
to undermine the system this summer by
letting students enroll who had been
accepted elsewhere under Early Decision.

Earthlust campaigns to raise Ford's fuel efficiency
BY KELSEY HOLLENBACK

khollenl@swarthmore.edu

The Philadelphia Sierra Club is beginning an effort to convince the Ford Motor
Company to increase the fuel efficiency of

its vehicles, and a group of Swarthmore
students is working to support the environmental group's campaign.
The "Freedom Option Package" that the
Sierra Club is encouraging Ford to adopt
includes three technologies: the continuously
variable automatic transmission, the variable-valve-control engine and the integrated
starter-generator, currently available only in
specialty vehicles such as SUVs and muscle
cars. All these advances are designed to
increase fuel efficiency and help meet Sierra
Club's stated goal of a fuel efficiency of 40
miles per gallon in all Ford motor vehicles.
"One thing about the campaign is that it's
the first time that the Sierrra Club has
departed from lobbying directly to politicians
and policy makers and directing the action
specifically toward a corporation," Keefe
Keeley 'O6 said. "We targeted Ford specifically because they have stated that they want to
be an environmentally friendly car producer.

we're asking them to live up to that."
"They advertise as being a good-for-theenvironment company," Jen Holzer 'O5
added. "But in reality, they cut all their
funding for hybrid and electric vehicle
research. We want to pressure them because

a number of our Earthlust meetings and gotten volunteers from Earthlust to help out
with the call-in day, where students could
call into Pacifico Ford Dealership in
Philadelphia or Ford headquarters in

Michigan and talk to them about using
these technologies," explained Keeley.
While Earthlust is the campus organization sponsoring the campaign, Holzer said,
"there's a lot of other people on campus
who are not affiliated with Earthlust but
are still working with him."
"I think it's really relevant because of
the present situation with Iraq and the role
that oil consumption plays in our society
politically, environmentally, and just the
American mindset about consumption,"
Holzer said. "I think people have a sense of
the urgency and relevancy of the campaign
more now than they would, but I think
since the seventies, the oil crisis in the seventies, people have been very aware of it.
Maybe our generation hasn't because we
weren't around during that time."
Keeley added, "I don't think it's just
because it's environmental or just because
it decreases our dependence on foreign oil. I
think that these are important issues to a lot
of people, and it seems a sensible thing that
Ford should institute these technologies."

Welsh added she would not want to

make across the board cuts, because she
would rather cut more heavily from less
essential programs.
But significant cuts must still be made.
Last year's five percent cuts did not solve
the overall budget problem. "We'll end up
with a deficit of $900,000 if nothing is done,"
Schall said, but Welsh added that number
could be as high as $1 million.
Compared to the college's overall budget, "It's not a significant number," Welsh
said. While it's clear that the period of high

growth the college's finances experienced
in the 1990s is over, Welsh added, "We don't
want to make this a crisis. This is very
manageable for the college."
There won't be a deficit, Welsh said, and
a balanced budget for 2003-2004 will be presented to the BOM in February. She said
that the process will be a "healthy re-examination" of where the college spends its
money.

Maurice Eldridge, vice president for college and community relations, said.
Eldridge expects that news of the budget constraints will change elements of the
Swarthmore culture, in that it will make
departments less likely to present longer
"Christmas lists," and that it will be much
harder for new programs to get funding
over the next few years.
But some things would be harder to cut,
Eldridge said, and it would be "hard to
imagine" cutting expenses for the Meaning
of Swarthmore fundraising campaign.
Yet he said he doesn't think students
will see changes "in a meaningful way,"
and that students should be reassured that
"we consult with people about serious

tradeoffs."

Traczynski confirmed that the CBC has
set priorities of items not to cut that they
discussed at their meeting last Friday.
"They didn't want to touch anything academic," he said, and that "touching staff
salaries would set off a war greater than
the one already going on."
Budish said he hoped repercussions
from the cuts would not be too severe.
"Hopefully we

can get student involvement

in this issue. Students need to make clear
what sacrifices they are willing to make.
"It's important for the administration to
give us enough information to provide reasonable alternatives and to ultimately
allow us to give some input on what we'd
be willing to sacrifice," but added that "I
think that facilities and dining services are
easy targets for cuts," he said.
After he learned the college would try to
cut about $1 million from departments'
budgets next year, Budish invited Schall to
speak about his proposals to end meal

equivalencies and instead keep a reduced-

service Sharpies open later into the night.
The other cost-saving proposal he suggested was to stop outsourcing cleaning staff at

Sharpies through a program that currently
employs special-needs individuals.
While no proposals are yet official,
Schall detailed yesterday some of the other
cuts he is planning to make in the facilities
department. The renovations to the basement level of McCabe have been put on
hold, and student spaces won't be renovated as soon as they would have otherwise.
The locker rooms in the athletics buildings
won't see replacement this summer, and
Schall added that only necessary renovations, such as making facilities more handicapped-accessible will continue on schedule.
"Any conversation at Swarthmore
about doing less is difficult because we've
rarely had to have those conversations,"
Schall said. "Swarthmore is in a relatively
good position compared to other colleges."
"If everyone participates to solve this
problem, no individual will be affected," he
added. "If you ask the whole college to
work on this it won't be a huge problem for
anybody."
Student Council Co-President Matt
Rubin 'O3 said, "We were interested in having Larry [Schall] and Linda [McDougall]
come discuss these options at Student
Council because we think students should
have a direct impact on budget cuts that
tangibly affect them,"
"I'm particularly concerned that the
options as proposed by Vice President
Schall do not accurately reflect budget cuts
that students would make were they to
have more input," he added.
He said he hopes students will be more
upset by the idea of cutting the jobs of special-needs employees rather than getting
rid of meal credits at Tarble.
Next Friday, the CBC will meet with the

Finance Committee of the Board of
discuss next year's budget as
well as five year budget projections.

Substance-free dorms debated
by housing committee for future
From HOUSING, pg. 3
Maiolo, however, was not overly concerned. "The question of segregation of the
campus is a difficult one," he said. "But I
don't know how much people who would
want to be substance-free are currently
mingling with people who drink heavily or
indulge frequently in illicit drugs. I can see
a difficulty with the middle ground
will
this separate Jane Doe from her friends
who drink just a little bit? I think that some
of that might happen."
Another concern raised in the Housing
Committee minutes is that the substancefree housing option might "add to/start to
ghettoize" other housing on campus.
To prevent this possible negative consequence, Mister believes that lifestyle substance-free housing would be preferable.
"That way the dorm won't become 'real
estate' (a place to retreat to, a nice pick in

the Housing Lottery, etc.)," he said. "The
students who live there would be consciously committed to being a community."
Dorms being considered for substancefree housing include Woolman, Parrish
North and Pitt/Palmer. Mister said "What
will probably be used is some variant of the
blocking system
if you want to live in
SFH, you would submit an application, and
those with the best averaged numbers
would get to pick into the space that gets
November 14, 2002

designated."
"In terms of enforcement, the options
that we have discussed include a warning
system that would involve the RA giving a
first warning followed by subsequent intervention of the Deans," Maiolo added. "This
approach is very similar to the current
approach to smoking on non-smoking halls
(which usually involve one or more warnings before the deans and/or fines become
involved). I would also hope to see a system
of community enforcement put into place
by the people who actually choose into substance-free housing such that they could
uphold their own standards for substancefree housing."
Ed Stehlik 'O5 believed there is no good
way to enforce substance-free housing, and
asked, "What RA wants to do that? I know

a number of RAs that feel antsy about ask-

ing people to be quiet after hours. They
can't be peer supportive and be getting on
people's cases about releasing stress, i.e.
partying. And half the RA's job is making
sure people are releasing stress."
If demand is determined to be high
enough, Mister said the "Housing Committee
might consider making one or more dorms
substance-free dorms next year."
The idea irritated some students.
Stehlik believes it goes against the spirit of
the college. "The whole Quaker thing is to
let people do what they want," he said.

Getting Around
Philly

RASHELLE ISIP
One Stop Out of Swat

How do you get around
Philadelphia? Walking is
obviously a popular choice
once you've gotten off any
of SEPTA'S trains, trolleys
or bus lines. Then there's
taxis, buses, bikes, scooters, you name it. Philly can
be explored in a variety of
different ways; it's just up
to you to choose which way
you want to do it.

The Philadelphia Marathon
Okay, so you might not be participating in the
marathon this year then again, maybe you are. If you're
not, you can still get a feel for what it is like to explore
Philadelphia by running. This year's marathon starts at
8:30 a.m. on Sunday, November 24. If you want to cheer on
the runners you can literally just stand in one place, as the
start and finish line is at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Or if you're up for exploring you can follow the course as
it winds its way through Center City, South Street, past the
Philadelphia Zoo, up to Main Street in Manayunk and back
down again to the art museum. Expect crowds and traffic
delays; walking through the city (besides running itself) is
the best bet.
Phllly in a Phlash

Faster than walking, cheaper than a taxi, it's
Philadelphia Phlash! Take this bus service to get around
Center City Philadelphia and University City with the
greatest of ease. A fare of $4 (yes, $4!) lets you ride around
all day long. The service runs seven days a week, every 1015 minutes. Destinations include the art museums, South
Street, Penn's Landing, locations near the Penn campus
and the Philadelphia Zoo. Hey, not a bad way to get
around. Just look for the bluish-purple bus.

Eminem hits all the high notes in Hanson flick
Rapper's musical compositions in "8 Mile" show potential for crossover success
BY ESTER BLOOM

eblooml@swarthmore.edu

Not a whole lot of people saw Mariah Carey in "Glitter"
or Britney Spears in "Crossroads." General consensus
seemed to be that the public was not interested in a threedimensional soundtrack glamorizing a two-dimensional
star.

But "8 Mile," starring our generation's Elvis
now
that's different. Surely director Curtis Hanson, renowned
creator of "L.A. Confidential" and "Wonder Boys," wouldn't squander his talent making a music video. There's no
risk, in going to see what's being called "the Eminem
movie," that you'll be bored, just that you might be
offended.
While indeed he manages to stay about eight miles from
PC at all time, Eminem (Marshall Mathers in real life,
Rabbit in the film) holds his own as an actor. More than
just a convincing punk, he vividly portrays the struggles of
a young rapper anxious for success and a way out of a life
that seems to be going nowhere. He broods, he bristles, he
fights, he screws around, he yells at his mom. He also doodles in rhyme on the bus to work, takes care of his little
sister, takes care of his friends and looks damn compelling
the whole way through.
Rabbit lives in a part of Detroit where abandoned houses never get torn down. A few years past high school and
fresh out of a pointless relationship, he has just moved
back to his mother's trailer, where she's living with her
daughter Lily, her boyfriend, who is roughly Rabbit's age,

and the fog of a permanent hangover. Rabbit works in a
factory, trying to save up enough to move out on his own.
The bright spot on Rabbit's horizon is his talent. But he
lacks the necessary money for studio time to make a demo,
or the ability to perform when his friend David, also and
purposefully called Future (Mekhi Phifer from "O"), signs
him up to "battle." The battles, held at the Shelter, a local
club, feature two rappers freestyling insults, trying to outwit and out-rhyme the other; the audience chooses its
favorite. Rabbit tries and chokes, unable to spit out even
one word in response to his opponent's rhymes. He is
booed off the stage.
He also knows that his being white in an almost entirely black environment doesn't work in his favor. Even
while putting down the Beastie Boys, his circle of friends
support him, but the community as a whole is suspicious.
Slowly he wins over small crowds in parking lots, always
acknowledging his status as an outsider
and the fact
that his whiteness, even if not in the world of hip-hop
artists trying to make it, is a privilege.
In a bizarre sense, "8 Mile" works as a musical. There's
no leaping or twirling or sweet true love subplots, but people do burst into song. Hip-hop is key to Rabbit's world. It's
how he proves himself and how he gets by. Hip-hop is also

one of the film's graphically violent scenes.
But what it boils down to is the music, and th|it comes
to a head when Rabbit finally agrees to battle again. Even
though you know how it'll turn out, the 20-minute-long
contest is pure adrenaline.
Despite Eminem's colorful reputation, his character
doesn't come off as a homophobic misogynist. Rabbit is
vulgar, just like everyone around him, but he's not malicious. Whether that impression is thanks to sympathetic
filmmaking, good acting, or Eminem's pure soul shining
through, you'll have to decide for yourself.

Senior Company's production begins to bloom
Second in a series about the Senior Company and their upcoming performance of "The Mineola Twins"
BY ELIZABETH COLLINS
ecollin2@swarthmore.edu

We're each in rehearsal for ten to 12 hours a
week," Nelson-Lee said.

Walking into a Senior Company rehearsal
on a Thursday night run-through of this year's
play, Paula Vogel's "The Mineola Twins,"
might be a bit overwhelming to the uninitiated.

every member of the ensemble are now spent
perfecting particular scenes. The entire ensemble begins with warm-ups led by the directors.
The physical and vocal warm-ups are intended
to get the cast members "into the theater" and
into character. "Shakedowns" and tongue
twisters not only help to get the actors into
their characters but also help to get the energy
among the actors flowing. From the company
warm-ups, each actor has his or her own way of
preparing for the rehearsal. "I need a moment
to concentrate and really come into my character. I have to think like my character,"
Elizabeth Zimmerman 'O3 said.
From warm-ups, the cast moves into running the scene. "We work in hour blocks usually," Nelson-Lee said. "We spend about an hour
running each scene except for one day,
Thursday, spent running through the entire
performance with the entire cast."
Scene work originally consisted of directors
asking the actors character-provoking questions. Now the scenes tendto move more quickly, and the focus of the work has shifted into
working on the transitions necessary for a
smooth production. Set changes, prop changes,

Screams of "1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8!" and spontaneous,

over-the-top noises and movements fill the dark
Frear theatre. The Swarthmore Senior
Company has begun its weekly Thursday runthrough: a timefor the ensemble to see how far
it has progressed in the past week of rehearsal.
Major parts of the sets are in place, the

beginnings of costumes have appeared on their
the play
respective actors, lines are learned
goes off with nary a hitch.

So last time they were auditioning, right?
Suddenly they're performing!? How'd they get
there? Well, in the words of some awful,
brawny German schoolmaster, "Practice
makes Perfect!" This article intends to examine the "practice" involved in putting a production on its feet, from tentative beginnings to
tentative middles to, well, tentative ends.
After the first week of rehearsal, consisting
reading and rereading the
of "table work"
script
the cast began intense improvisational exercises. The improvisations were intended
to help the actors develop their characters.
Each improvisation session lasted about an
hour and focused on the interactions among
the characters. For example, one improv featured the first time Myrna (one of the twins)
and Jim (her high school sweetheart) meet.
Kate Hurster 'O3, who plays the "voice,"
among other roles, found two improvisations
particularly helpful. The voice represents that
of the twins' mother in the play. In the first
weeks Hurster participated in an improvisational exercise of the funeral of the twins'
father; the scene focused on the guilt the mother feels for having done a poor job raising her
children. Hurster was also able to focus on her
"motherly" characteristics in a scene where
one of the twins, Myra, comes out about her
homosexuality to her mother.
"My part was particularly nebulous; in fact
it wasn't even written into the original script,
so these improvs have proven to be extraordinarily helpful in shaping my character,"
Hurster said.
After several weeks of only minimal scene
work and character-based improvisation, the
ensemble moved on to the blocking, or movement, aspect of the play. Characters moved on
impulse with the directors "tweaking" their
steps as they went along.
"At this stage in the production, Jessica
[Nakamura 'o3] and I were mainly concerned
about getting the scene 'on its feet.' While doing
scene work we would be blocking and answering questions the actors had about their characters," said Senior Company director Kate
Nelson-Lee 'O3.
After October break, actors were required to
to have their lines memorized.
go "off book"
"The first run-through after October break was
a turning point for the production. Everything
started to take shape and fall into place after
that," Nelson-Lee said.
After the beginnings of a production were
starting to take shape, the ensemble moved
from their normal pattern of one run-through
every two weeks to a run-through every
Thursday night. Practice is now a grueling five
nights a week: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
and Thursday's run-through.
Wednesday
Practice usually starts around seven and goes
until ten every night.
"Originally Jessica and I stayed for 14 to 15
hours every week. The schedule got to be overwhelming, so eventually we decided that each
of us would take one night off every week.

The eight to 12 hours required of practically

and übiquitous costume changes are now the
most challenging aspects of the rehearsal.

of each scene the directors give notes that

about 'tweaking' the imperfect parts," Hurster
said.
"Certain scenes are particularly hard to perform realistically," Nakamura said. "Paula
Vogel demands complete emotional involvement from her characters, and that can often
prove difficult."
Eight to 12 hours a week, every week can
either bring a group of people together or tear
them apart. Fortunately for the Senior
Company, the outcome has been the former. "I
was fascinated by the dedication every cast
member has, regardless ofhis or her age, experience or role," Hurster said. "Even the nonSenior-Company members have proven to be
completely focused.
"I was thrilled to discover how supportive
cast members are of each other. Actors stay in
the room to watch each other perform, even

when they aren't on stage," Nakamura said. "In
other productions I've worked with, cast members have never been so supportive."
"The cast members have amazing attitudes.
They are playful but not afraid to take risks to
push the envelope," Zimmerman said. "The
Senior Company members exhibit no pretentiousness toward the non-Senior-Company
members, a quality that I found to form a fluid
dynamic among every cast member."
So where to next for the Senior Company
players? Sets are practically in place now, but
most of the costumes need to be prepared, and
lighting and sound have yet to be added. "I
focused on developing the 'actor's space' first,
followed by the 'actor's character' when developing the sets, props, and costumes," designer
Erica Cartmill 'O3 said. "Once the big props had

"We plan to have sound in place by the end

Studying study spaces Sex and the city...
I mean... Swattie
BY AARON WASSERMAN
awasserl@swarthmore.edu

.

I have a bony butt. It's something I
can't help. Recently, I've been trying to
add some junk in the trunk, but to no
avail (my doctor once told me that I
have a very high metabolism rate).
This works well for the indie-rock aesthetic, but it becomes an extremely
pressing issue when it comes time to
study.
I can't study in my room because
there are just too many distractions, so
I frequently find myself in the wonderful confines of McCabe Library. In
McCabe, all studying locations can be
separated into two classifications: the
comfortable, plush chairs and couches
in the open lounges
or the spartan,
wooden chairs at the secluded desks
(see where my butt becomes an issue?).
Very few options fall somewhere in between. This
raises the question that sparks an eternal dilemma: should a student choose to relax while studying, risking sleep, or remain focused via the
thorny wooden chairs, risking morning-after soreness? Pam Harris, the wonderful reference librarian, dubs this the "ascetic vs. aesthetic" argument,
and it's an issue worth further investigation.
Harris is a firm believer in "treating [her] body
as well as [she] can," so she always goes for the
luxurious studying option, even if this means that
she misses some valuable studying time because of
spontaneous naps. In fact, she has also been advocating the addition of fireplaces and sofas in the
library to make it feel even more like a home away
from home. She highly recommends McCabe's
fourth floor as a good place to find an area that's
comfortable and quiet.
Apparently, others on the reference staff agree.
Anne Garrison describes herself as a "total plush"
person. As I interviewed her, she told me to take
note of the expensive and amazingly comfortable
chairs behind the research desk. The first thing
she does when she begins her shift is fix the chair
so it can lean back all the way, ensuring maximum
levels of comfort. "The primary function of undergraduate libraries is to serve as a study place, not
research," Garrison said. "Comfortable couches
are of the utmost importance." Harris and
Garrison obviously work together.
This doctrine has even managed to travel the
five-foot gap between the research and checkout
desks. Flo Bendrick, the lovely lady who manages
the checkout desks on Sunday nights, agrees with
Harris and Garrison. She said that she would
always choose the plush over the austere, although
she would never stay on the main floor because it's

simply too small and noise travels easily. Take i
from the professionals: find a couch that's not in
the lobby so you can have a quiet, relaxing study

session.
Others choose to ignore the dilemma McCabe
creates by simply eschewing it as a favored study
location. Miranda Peters 'O5, a student employee a
McCabe, finds herself frequently working on prob
lem sets in her room or in a study group in
Cornell. "I don't really consider McCabe to be a
study place," she said. When I asked if it was hyp
ocritical for a library employee to ignore th
library's wonderful study space options, she
looked at me with a raised eyebrow and a sligh
look of alarm and responded, "No." .
Mike Spiegel 'O3 is a computer-science majo
and spends most of his time in the Sun Lab
Unfortunately, he has yet to develop a tan. As an
RA, he can bring yet another perspective to th
subject: "Everyone should work more in their ha]

said. The students seem to be offering a contradic

Casey Lee 'O5 belongs to an interesting group o

The island ofManhattan I mean ... the ivory tower of Swarthmore
is filled with 1,400 sexually viable humans. Many of these sexual candidates choose to operate in monogamous relationships. As a current
monogamist, I have to say that it is not easy. So why put yourself
through it? Are we monogamists really in love, or are we just being
greedy and holding onto someone while waiting for a better someone to
come along? And more important, how do we crazy monogamists keep
the sex fresh and exciting?
In this sexual anthropologist's musings, I will deconstruct the relationship and sexual lifestyle of one example of these brave souls. The
example is, of course, me. Despite the ever-lauded diversity of our population, extrapolate, please. You will find parallels.
My relationship is over a year-and-a-half old. His name is Mr. Big

Digs. Ah yes, the intelligent, sexy, and ever-so-Ukrainian Mr.
Digs. He may not be a Swattie, but that's a plus. The sex gods know I
bring enough Swattiness into the relationship.

When the sex starts to feel like a PDC, the
relationship is in trouble.
He's actually from our equivalent of New Jersey: UPenn. In the magical land known as University City, we wine and dine. Well, he wines
and cooks; I say no to Cosmopolitans but pass the curry. We sing and
dance. Well, I sing and dance; he talks in his sexy Soviet monotone voice
and sways side-to-side while eyeing other boys. We fuck and cuddle.
Well, fuck is a relative term, and he seems to be much more into the cuddling right now than I am.
Which leads me to my current dilemma: the sex has plateaued. A
blowjob is a blowjob. We know which position feels best. We know how
long we want to prolong it. We know that it's getting old. And as idealistic as I'd like to be, I have to face the fact that sex plays a huge part in

a relationship.
And when the sex starts to feel like a PDC, the relationship is in trouble.
So how to correct the problem? How do we liven it up? Does this
mean it's over? Is it time to move on? If this is what monogamy leads
to, you might as well lock me up in Cornell or take away my Chanel,
right? No! This Swattie still believes in all the mumbo jumbo bullshit
that Meg Ryan and even Sarah Jessica Parker feed us.
Let's put this Swattie mind to use and brainstorm ways to spice
things up.

Aha! When all else fails, create a list. This Swattie's list of ideas to
heat things up in that rent-controlled apartment on the Upper East Side
I mean that financial-aid-sponsored Parrish North dorm room:
L Actually try anal sex.
2. Role play, role play, role play.
3. Dildos galore.
wait, or is that included in role play?
4. S/M
No, no, no! Is this what love is all about? Handcuffs and a plastic
penis? Shouldn't I perhaps question other aspects of our relationship
rather than just the sex? Use the other head and figure out what else
might be causing things to go the way of Haverford?
So Digs and I did some soul-searching. When I actually stopped to
think about it, rather than trying to figure out how to get more bang out
of my fuck, there was a lot going on. We had lots of academic work on
our plates. We had less time to spend together, and thus less time to do
creative, different and exciting things. We weren't taking time to share
our ideas on politics and life goals.
If this is someone I'm going to potentially spend the rest of my life
with, I need to realize that it's not just about figuring out ways to maximize the trajectory of his ejaculation. And while it might sound exciting to pursue someone new, just ask a single friend of yours what his or
her life is like. Does Screw sound like fun? Perhaps the sex isn't as hot,
but there's a case to be made for reliability as well.
Why am I putting myself through the hell that is monogamy?
Because I care about Mr. Digs deeply and want him to be a part of my
life. It's not just about sex; it's about love.
Am I just hanging onto him until someone else comes along? No,
there have been opportunities to move onto a Mr. Pig or Mr. Twig. But
they didn't cut it.
Will our sex life inevitably dwindle? Probably, but I've learned sometimes a trusty pair ofAdidas is better than a flashy pair ofManolo Blahniks.
In Swat speak, yeah, Thai Bar is exciting, but sometimes Pasta Bar
just feels right.

Day of the Dana Bug
BY SYDNEY BEVERIDGE
sbeveril@swarthmore.edu

There's always that one hallmate. You
know
that odd one. He's kind of small
and a little dirty, always scurrying
around and never doing work. But what
really creeps you out is the way he clings
to the wall with his 15 pairs of legs stalk,

ing insects.

No, this is not your ordinary roommate; this is Scutigera Coleopterata but
you can call him "Dana Bug." A longtime
fixture in many campus buildings (especially its namesake, Dana) this insect has
sparked anger, fear and occasional sympathy in many a Swattie.
Hailing from Mexico, these "house centipedes" have infiltrated buildings around
the United States.
insects grow to up
to one-and-a-half inches, with long antenna and 15 pairs of legs. They enjoy the
comforts of warm, damp crawl spaces in
buildings like Dana, and they breed
-

indoors.

Biology professor Rachel Merz has
been hearing about the insects from students for at least 10 years and occasionally runs into one in Martin. She explained
that the predators primarily feast on
smaller insects such as baby cockroaches,
flies and silverfish. According to Merz,
these insects should be welcomed in any
household, as they eat pests rather than
food waste. Their agility impresses Merz.
"I just think they're sort of amazing little

animals to coordinate all those legs and
run fast," she said.
For visiting professor of biology
Justine Melo, Dana Bugs evoke frustration rather than awe. Just hours after she
moved into Swarthmore campus housing
in August, the first insect stopped by, and

the bugs have made daily appearances
ever since. The bugs have been thriving
in the basement and walls of Melo's home,
audibly crawling around her wall. In her
frequent encounters with the species, she

has even spotted specimens as long as her
index finger. Melo does not fear all
insects, just these bugs. "I don't mind spiders, but picture these guys crawling on
my face at night," she said.
Traditional pesticides have little effect

on Dana Bugs, so like many of their other
foes, Melo must employ one-on-one combat. Unfortunately, even after their
demise, Dana Bugs continue to be a bother. "If you step on them, you feel like you
want to put your shoes in the washing

machine," Melo said about the remnants
of her bug battles. "The insect legs can be
hideous, and the corpses tend to smell
like decaying dishwater." She offered to
capture the next one, but this reporter
declined.
The centipedes can live for as long as
five years, especially in the lush confines
of the Dana basement, but a chance
encounter with a student predator quickly shortens that lifespan. Olivia Gruber
'O3, the dutiful RA of Dana basement, has
had many experiences with "those
wretched little things." Gruber and other
students tend to leave the bugs alone but
must occasionally dispose of the pests
when they come too close. Former
Danawell resident Ben Galynker 'O3
summed up the reactions to Dana Bugs in
this simple formula: "the closer they are
to your bed, the nastier they seem."
After dealing with Dana Bugs in her
room and around her hall, Gruber has
scraped many insects off her flip-flops,
She commented that the worst part about
them is their fast speed, which they attain

House centipedes feed on small insects, insect larvae, and on spiders. Thus they
are beneficial, though most people lake a different point of view and consider them a

traverse the floor. Early in September, a
fellow Danawell RA discovered a bug
coming out of the faucet, "preening itself'
in the sink. Fortunately for Dana residents, the cooler weather has greatly
reduced insect sightings.

Dingman "saw the little bastard chillin'
over there on the radiator." Recognizing
his opportunity, he thought, "This is my
chance to be brave," and reached for a
nearby chopstick.
With his makeshift weapon, Dingman
"speared the little bastard right in the
middle of his thorax," splitting him into
two pieces. He had eliminated one of his
insect intruders, but its brethren
returned periodically, despite the impaling incident. Now a resident of Parrish,
Dingman is free from the torment of the

You think you're a pretty good dancer. You rip up the beer-stained checkered floor of PACES regularly. But be prepared to be shown up on Saturday in LPAC at 8:00 p.m., as the Rhythm 'N Motion
dance group brings *five* different genres of dance to the stage: African dance, jazz, dancehall, hiphop, and Latin. Think your 'grind' can match up? Then watch as groups from Haverford and Chester
prove that the rest of world knows a great deal about dancing, too.
But don't worry about your ego too much; just go and have fun. Jumatatu Poe 'O3 assures me that
the show will have a "little bit of something for everybody." If you can't make the show on Saturday,
there will be an open dress rehearsal on Friday at 4:30 p.m., also in LPAC.

Cuts ahead

by A-CHAH

During the lush economic times of the late 19905,

students and administrators grew
accustomed to a new degree of luxury in and out of
the classroom. Now that the nation is struggling
Swarthmore

through uncertain economic times, the college is
faced with its first budget crisis in many years.
Confronted with the national economy's miserable post-Sept. 11 condition, the college faces a
$700,000 deficit next year if budget cuts aren't negotiated for next year. This year, conveniently, the
Board of Managers is swooping in to ameliorate
the $900,000 deficit currently plaguing the 2002-3

budget.
Things look, at first blush, grim. Though admin-

istrators don't have a clear picture yet of everything that will suffer from the squeeze, they all
agree that cuts will have to come from many
places, if not from all parts of the college.
It was unfortunate, though, that Linda
McDougall and Larry Schall, in attendance at this
Monday's Student Council meeting, offered specific
proposals for possible cuts in their departments,
namely the facilities projects and the meal equivalency program for dinner. It is important now that
no one start obsessing over these particular proposals plenty more, unfortunately, will face the ax
before the bloated budget comes in at a palatable
price. There's some bad news there, but good, too: a
little bit taken away from everyone's mouths is better than any one or a few of us completely starving.
Students will feel the cuts also, but thankfully
not in their tuition bills (the college will keep its
policy of raising tuition at the rate of inflation plus
one-and-a-half percent). And if some luxuries have
to go
a few fewer hours of vans running to PPR,
ML and Strath Haven, a little less heat in dorm
rooms, then so be it. This is a college, not a luxury
resort, and sometimes, that's easy to forget, especially during the coming crunch of finals time,
where the world outside Swarthmore seems to all

but evaporate.
The cuts will hurt, and Schall is right: it's difficult for the college community to talk about what
needs to go, since it's so rare that such conversations are called for. In what will be an uncertain
time ahead, reasoned decisions over what can and
can't go are necessary, but it is just as necessary
for all of us to remember why these cuts make us
so uncomfortable. Life here at Swarthmore is usually pretty good, and to keep it that way, to keep the
budget balanced, we'll all have to tighten our belts
a little. But we'll turn out better for it in the end.

Explanation and correction
The Phoenix attempts to publish letters to the

editor as free expressions of opinion, though we
draw the line at misleading statements that
amount to personal attacks. Yet last week we failed
to hold that line. The phrases in quotation in
Susan Roth's letter last week [November 7, 2002
"Homophobia larger issue than 'straight-bashing'"]
were misleading in that she implied those were the
exact words of Jeff Rogg. While it is not disputed
that a confrontation occurred between Elizabeth

Lindsey and Jeff Rogg last fall, to the knowledge of
The Phoenix, there is ho record of what Rogg said
other than what Lindsey claimed he did. [October
25, 2001 "Chalkings spur 'homophobic harassment'"] In order to avoid printing phrases which
we could not independently verify that Rogg said,
the only responsible way to print the phrases quoted in Roth's letter would have been to refer to

Lindsey's account of Rogg's words.

Last's week's article "Swat students protest
Cheney's Penn visit," should have cited Alex
Brennan 'O4 as saying that most, not all, of the
speakers at the Oct. 25 protest were white men.

Shallow look at queer culture misses mark

This is a liberal campus, but tolerance and support are

two vastly different things. People at Swarthmore, ever
respectful, won't say 'fag' if they know they are around one
but do they really know? Queer at Swarthmore doesn't
always imply Out at Swarthmore. Yes, we are a queer-tolerant campus community, but
hardly a queer-friendly one.
Finally, I want to state cleartends
ly that it is not solely the
responsibility of SQU to foster
world

First of all, I have never claimed to represent the queei
population of Swarthmore. Being queer at Swarthmon
means and entails different things for everybody. For eacl

students from queer families.

Furthermore, I cannot speak
for other members of SQU or
QSA. Our lifeways, while perhaps intersecting in specific arenas, are otherwise entirely dissimilar. When I speak at meetings of SQU or QSA, to my
friends, or to a reporter, I am presenting only my thoughts,
and would never presume my views to be applicable to
anyone else.
Second, I would like to address homophobia on campus,
since Nelson appears to have excised my thoughts on this
what I interpreted to be the purpose of his article. I personally do not sense a great deal of homophobia on this campus.
I am lucky in that my social circles are predominantly
queer-friendly, if not patronizingly so, and always, at the
least, tolerant of difference.
I recognize that this is not true for everybody. There is
nothing I can do about that. In lieu of homophobia on campus, I see rampant heterosexism and heteronormativity.
Look these words up. This campus tends to categorize things

facets of life. Queer-safe should be a campus mentality. The
response to Coming Out Week should not be, "How is the
week helping people to come out?" but rather, "How can I
help someone feel safer on this campus?"
Coming Out Week provides a time for students, faculty
and staff to question their ways of being, their responses to
queerness on campus. The Phoenix should provide more
than a 'look how liberal we are!' treatment of Coming Out
Week and lead students to a deeper understanding of what
they have neglected to see on their own.
I'd have been thrilled to see this Oct. 31 issue of The
Phoenix if it had been published in 1986. With the evolution
of discourse on campus comes a greater responsibility to
represent various perspectives on a more than superficial

level, and The Phoenix has failed.

male, have managed to instigate a
series of complaints and accusations from self-righteous members
of the Swarthmore community.
Somehow I find myself unable to RANDY GOLDSTEIN
sympathize.
Bursting the Bubble
There is no disputing the fact
that racism is a very real and serious problem in our global community. Its consequences are often disturbing and it is occasionally carried out to such a degree that it results in gross violations
of human rights.
We must realize, however, that there is a difference between
blatant racism with violent consequences and the innocent
intentions of a small group of party goers. Rather than recognizing the poor judgment of those party goers and moving on with
their lives, some students have chosen to create an issue whose
relevance on campus is dubious. Is there really a racism problem at Swarthmore College?
I challenge anyone to identify an institution within this college in which students are discriminated against because of
their race. Minority students enjoy a level of equality at
Swarthmore which is sadly unparalleled in the real world.
The Halloween costumes neither obstructed this equality
nor presented any physical threat to those whom they might
have offended. In fact, the only realistic complaint that has
emerged from this chaos is that the Halloween costumes were
offensive to some people.
Were a campus debate to erupt every time a Swattie, was
offended, we would have little time to do anything other than to
engage in meaningless dialogue while feeling bad for ourselves.
To cite the Halloween costumes as an incidence ofracism on
campus is to cite one's own inability to separate emotion from
logic. While they may have been offensive to some, the costumes in no way oppressed or discriminated against anyone, no
matter how badly some feelings were hurt.
That said, Swarthmore College is under no obligation to prevent its students' feelings from being hurt. This also applies in
the real world, where one cannot so easily vent frustration to
the Associate Dean for Multicultural Affairs.
Swarthmore is meant to provide an education in a safe, open
environment. To interpret this as a duty to stifle free speech, no
matter how offensive one may find that speech, is absurd.
The more troublesome issue in this controversy is the manner in which Swarthmore students reacted to the initial situation. After complying with a request to remove his blackface,
that student was forced to flee ML as he was physically threatened by a number of other attendees.
Where is the outcry against those who would implement violence as a means of displaying their disapproval of this student's actions?
Soon after the party, rumors began circulating that I, who
went dressed as an Arab male, was in fact dressed as a
"Palestinian terrorist." While the costume was nothing more
than an imitation of stereotypical Arab garb, some ignorant
Swattie equated Arab with Palestinian and Palestinian with terrorist. This seems to embody the exact cultural unawareness
against which the perpetuators of this rumor claim to be struggling.
A recent letter to the Phoenix demanded that the administration "take a strong role in promoting a healthier campus
environment for all of us."
For that to happen, Swatties must realize that while diversity is a desirable and noble ideal, they cannot selectively create
an issue out of a minor event whose impact will ultimately be
inconsequential to that ideal.
Instead of concentratingour efforts on a trivial incident with
no lasting implications, we would be better served to promote a
campus in which diversity of all types is encouraged and
embraced. To scapegoat a few students over a one-time lapse in
judgment is to hinder that process and discourage a healthier,
more accepting campus environment.

bility for the accident. The
Liberty was sailing too close to
the war zone (Israel was fighting
the Six Day War) at a speed of 30
knots, and the Israeli town of El-Arish had reported bombardment from the sea. Israeli planes failed to identify the ship's
nationality because it was a windless day and the flag hung limp
at the mast. After the initial airstrike, Israeli torpedoes mistakenly identified the Liberty as the Egyptian supply vessel El
Quesir, and since the ship did not respond to their challenge,
promptly launched torpedoes. The attack only lasted five to six
minutes, at which point the Israelis realized their mistake and
offered assistance to the ship.

The torpedo boats carefully shot each
life raft to bits as the crew tried to lower
them into the water.
There is another side to the story, however, which cannot be
dismissed as "simply inaccurate." The attack on the Liberty
killed 34 Americans and wounded 17L Lieutenant James M.
Ennes, Jr., survived the attack and wrote a book entitled
"Assault on the Liberty." Ennes reports that according to the
ship's log and crew testimony, the wind was blowing at a speed
of eight knots, enough to keep the flag extended and fully visible.
The Liberty was traveling at a speed of only five knots, and the
ship's name was painted in large letters on the stern. The report
about El-Arish being bombed from the sea was false, and regardless, the small guns aboard the Liberty were incapable of shore
bombardment. The Egyptian vessel El Quesir was in port in
Alexandria for the duration of the Six Day War, 250 miles from
El-Arish, and was incapable of speeds greater than 14 knots.
Israeli reconnaissance planes flew over the Liberty eight times
to verify its identity, "each time executing the now-familiar
counterclockwise orbit before completing a low-level, diagonal,
direct over-flight of the ship" as Ennes related. Intercept officers
aboard the Liberty picked up transmissions in which the Israeli
pilots identified the ship as American. Ennes recalls that at one
point Captain McGonagle remarked to him, "It's good that we
have sunbathers on deck, it helps to show that we're peaceful."
The torpedo boats carefully shot each life raft to bits as the
crew tried to lower them into the water. The attack lasted for 70
minutes. During the subsequent investigation, crew members
who insisted on arguing with the official version of events were
pulled out of the courtroom and told by their superiors that "We
don't want to hear about that," Ennes reports. Most of the crew
testimony that conflicted with the Israeli account was stamped

Top Secret and withheld from the public. Crew members were
forbidden to talk to reporters and later allowed to give interviews only in the presence of commanding officers, to ensure
that the conversation "stayed on track, according to Ennes."
I recommend Ennes's book for further information. One of
the most painful questions raised by the incident was why we
did not come to the aid of our own sailors when we knew they
were under attack. The U.S. Fleet was positioned nearby, and the

USS America did in fact dispatch four F-4 Phantom jets to defend
the Liberty. Inexplicably, the Sixth Fleet received the following
message from Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara: "get
those aircraft back immediately." Admiral David L. McDonald's
response, according to Ennes, was more explicit: "You get those
fucking airplanes back on deck, and you get them back now." So
before we rush into a war to defend Americans from an attack
not yet carried out, we might do well to reflect on those attacks
from which we did not see fit to defend Americans.

Election coverage misleading
Dear Editor:
The Phoenix story about students voting in the
November 5 election was misleading.
The Republican Party put up signs directed solely
at students about penalties for voting twice. In several precincts the election judges removed the poster for
three reasons: It was allegedly signed by the County
Democratic Party Chair when, in actuality, it was not;
it did not have a note declaring that it was printed by
the Republican Party; and it was intimidating. The
case went to the courts, the magistrate agreed with
the objections, and he ordered all signs to be taken
down. He did, however, allow a much altered and
milder form of the sign to be posted.
Matt Rubin 'O3 certainly had the right to ask ques-

tions of students going in to vote, but students should
have refused to answer them. Instead, they should

have immediately called for the Precinct Judge of
Elections, who would have checked to see if they were
registered and, if so, would have let them vote. This
has been the procedure in the Western Precinct
(where students living at Mary Lyon, who have their
address listed as Harvard Avenue, vote) and where I
have been election judge. The other precincts in
Swarthmore, I believe, have followed a similar policy.
If students felt intimidated or harassed by questions
asked by workers of either party, they should have
also told the election judge, who would have called the
constable. As the Phoenix story reports, Matt Rubin
'O3 and Claudia Sell 'O4 did not feel that Rubin's "series
of questions" was intimidating, but they are not the
final authority on this matter.
Frederic L. Pryor
Emeritus Professor, Department of Economics

Illegal signs could intimidate voters
Dear Editor:
I write this letter to see ifI can add some facts to the
erroneous report given by Matt Rubin 'O3 regarding the
"double dip" voter problem of this past election day.
First of all, the signs in question were clearly illegal.
They contained a disclaimer at the bottom indicating
that they had been authorized by the chairman of the
Delaware County Democrat Party, Cliff Wilson, and the
chairman of the Delaware County Republican Party,
Tom Judge. I know both of these gentlemen personally
and I do not believe they intended to do anything illegal,
but I believed the signs were intimidating and illegal
because they singled out one category of voters to warn
about the consequences of voting twice: Swarthmore
College students. Why? There must have been some
imagined belief that these students have a history of
voting in two places, and more importantly, that a vast
number of those college students would vote in
Swarthmore for one party or the other (can you guess
which one?), skewing local election results.
If the signs had directed a warning only to people
of one race or another, or to people of one religion or
another, would Rubin consider that to be proper or
legal? I would not, and the signs in question were just
as illegal for carrying a warning directed only at col-

November 14, 2002

lege students.
Second, I have lived in Swarthmore for 45 years. I
have served as a Judge of Elections in both the Western
and Northern Precincts. I was solicitor to the Borough
of Swarthmore for 17 years and mayor of the borough
for 8 years. I was, am, and will remain a Republican.
I have never seen any student challenged for voting twice in any election in the borough. I have never
known any Swarthmore College student to vote twice
in an election. The issue is not whether you are registered in two places; people rarely withdraw their registrations when they move from one town or state to
another.
I was the lawyer who went to the judge to get the
signs corrected to make them conform to the law. The
judge agreed with me. The chief witness who would
have testified for the removal of the signs is Ken
Klothen '73, a Democrat and the President of

Swarthmore Borough Council.
This issue was not about Democrats threatening
Republicans. This issue was about illegal signs threatening or intimidating Swarthmore College students. I
know Ken Klothen saw it that way. I saw it that way.
The judge saw it that way.

Erotic poetry: not just Swattie shame
Dear Editor:
We editors of Ourstory were surprised to find the
Phoenix's voyeuristic, covert coverage of our event "A
Night of Shamelessness: Ourstory's Erotic Poetry
Reading." Phoenix reporter Jason Perini's well-intentioned, playful article titled "Poetic Lust" (Nov. 7) was
amusing and creative, but his little piece left some-

thing to be desired.
Ourstory is Swarthmore's biannual, all-campus
diversity literary and art publication. Ourstory
reflects the diversity of voices at Swarthmore, which
is why any student, faculty or staff member may contribute. The purpose of each reading is different: On
Valentine's Day 2003, for instance, we will be hosting
a multi-lingual poetry slam to celebrate diverse written and oral traditions.
Ourstory also hosts "A Night of Shamelessness:
Ourstory's Erotic Poetry Reading" every fall. Perini
writes about one student's poems:
something
about frogs and enzymes and slugs and other sexy
things, and I wonder: That is erotic? Yes, this is still

Campus should honor veterans
Dear Editor:
Monday, November 11, was Veterans Day, on which
we should honor and remember those who have
fought for our country.
It is a day on which we should remind ourselves of
the great sacrifices made throughout our history that
allow us to enjoy the freedoms we have today. Yet here
at Swarthmore, nothing was done to commemorate
Veterans' Day and honor those who have fought and
died for the United States of America.
Instead of honoring those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our great nation, Swarthmore has
chosen to do nothing. A collection was held on the
anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11,
but thousands more people have died defending our
country than perished on that dreadful day. Instead of

Why does McDonald's taste so good?
It really doesn't, but I can guarantee that more Americans
would be likely to answer a mail-in survey about McDonald's
than to vote in their local elections. Americans seem to think
that voting is something you can do for fun. Other than bitching
about McDonald's, what we are really trying to say is that
Americans don't seem to realize the value in voting. About 7
million people elected officials for about 24 million people in
California state elections. We have one of the lowest voter
turnouts in the developed world, and yet we claim to be the beacon and bastion of democracy across the world. While we may
admit that voting is a right, Americans need to conceptualize it
as a duty. Most people don't really realize how lucky we are to
be able to vote. This hits close to home as well. Instead of bitching about how shitty the world is, why don't some of you stop
and ask yourselves if you voted? We did, you damn hippies. Now

we may sound like fascists, but how about a mandatory voting

law in conjunction with a voting holiday. France along with
some others we can't remember and maybe Australia all have it

aren't forcing people to vote for someone, just asking them to
tell you what their opinion is.

All these reforms may not help. We would
hope that mandatory voting and a voting holiday would get people in this country to place greater value on democratic participation, but it's not difficult to argue that Americans still wouldn't care. The clearest indicator of someone's political beliefs
isn't education or socioeconomic status; it's their parents' ideologies. The future of American politics is really just one giant

Beirut and Burstein: Matter and antimatter collide
In search of beer lore, Rachel travels to Phi Psi to learn more about Beirut
etymology, records and techniques from students of the drinking game
BY RACHEL BURSTEIN
rburstel@swarthmore.edu

I had the article all written in my head.
It would be easy. I would mock the name
"Beirut," peppering my drinking game
coverage with cleverly disguised critiques of American foreign policy. I'd
define Phi Psi as the pairing of two Greek
letters representing the three core ideals
of debauchery, lewdness and general male
idiocy
in the tradition of classical literature, of course. I would assert my morally superior voice, condemning the frequent frat-house references to tits and
ass. My research would consist of watching "Animal House." I would count passed
out bodies and pools of vomit. I might
have even taken the time to find out
which frat house was Phi Psi and which
one was DU. I would be clever and smug.
I would make everyone look stupid. I
would also succeed in turning a sportsrelated topic into something thoroughly
non-sports-related for the fourth consecutive week.
It would have been a great article.
But, instead, my editor cajoled me into
actually fulfilling my job requirements

through conducting a full investigation
into the Beirut scene at Swarthmore. I
regarded this development as a major setback to my master plan, but I humored
him and complied. It is never good to have
your editor upset with you. Besides, there
is a lot to report on.
Like the name of the game, for
instance. I spent the first 20 years of my
life under the mistaken impression that
Beirut was the capital city of Lebanon. It
turns out that this frequently held mis-

conception involves an enormous conspiracy propagated by seventh-grade
geography teachers. Armed with their
superior education, college students, particularly those of the J. Crew-wearing-fraternity-belonging-jock variety, know differently. Thus, contrary to popular belief,

Beirut actually involves disposable cups
a ping-pong ball, and a liquid that when
ingested in large quantities causes a person to behave like a jackass, if he isn't one
already. This has been scientifically docu-

mented.
Dictionaries are part of the conspiracy,
identifying Beirut only as a "seaport"
without a more adequate description of
the alcoholic makeup of those treacher-

ous waters. Recently, linguists have
begun to correct for this problem of
exclusion, conclusively tracing the etymology of the word to your mom. But
despite this attempt to standardize word
origin in definitive texts, myths continue
to circulate in the popular imagination of

x

Beirut enthusiasts worldwide.
Zak Gelacek 'O3 explained the origin of
the Beirut title, saying, "I've heard that
the name Beirut came from a Lebanese
kid who was really good at the game." He
followed up on this analysis by remarking, "I doubt that this is true." Gelacek is
not one to fall for the seventh-grade geography teacher line. As the co-holder of the
Phi Psi record for most consecutive cups
made in a single game, Gelacek is not easily fooled.
Neither is Ben Wiles 'O3, who, when
probed, said, "I'd go with the whole 'beer
root' story." I was not familiar with this
story, and did not ask, fearing that my

total lack of qualification to report on any
and all sports-related topics would be
revealed. Several days later, I was still
contemplating the linguistic relationship
between a beer root and Beirut, in addition to trying to determine what a beer
root actually is. I certainly have never
heard of one.
Other theories circulate, many drawing a link between pong, a pageant typically staged in observance of Seventh
Grade Geography Teachers' Awareness
Day, Beirut, and aliens from outer space.
As stated earlier, the most plausible of
these academic insights involves your
mom. This has been well documented in
several journals nearly universally recognized to be of ill repute by the General
Establishment.
The
General
Establishment is part of the conspiracy.
The conspiracy is far flung. It extends
to informing general notions of drinking
games and the people who play them. It is
assumed by people who don't know better
that Beirut is about getting drunk, and
that, paradoxically, the only skill
involved is the gift of a high tolerance for
alcohol. I don't know any people who
might think that. After careful research
on the topic, I can assure the reader that
it takes extraordinary skill to play Beirut.
One must cultivate the

perfect

arc of the

toss, the exact splash of the beer, the precise bounce of the ping-pong ball. I am
told there are algorithms for these things.
No one seems to know these equations.
One must also like beer, preferably of the
cheap, warmed variety. I was told by reliable sources that Natty Light works well.
But this reliance on the consumption
of bad beer should not be interpreted as
the essence of Beirut. Beirut is a mental
exercise. As Chris Loeffler 'O4, the sole
holder of the Phi Psi record for most consecutive cups made (which, as it is my
journalistic duty to report, is different
than most consecutive cups made in a single game) said, "The game has some skill
to it, rather than other drinking games
where it simply comes down to who can
drink the most." By his own admission,
Loeffler doesn't usually excel at such pursuits. Beirut is equal opportunity, rewarding brains over brawn. It is my kind of
sport. Too bad I don't like beer.
But like all good sports, there are
rewards for playing Beirut well. If you're
good enough, and you're playing a team
that's bad enough, you don't have to drink
beer at all. This never ever happens. But
that evenly matched competition is reason enough to learn the rules, the psyche,
the moves, the entire deal.
There is a lot to know. As far as I can

November 14, 2002

tell, Beirut involves the equal arrangement of a mutually agreed upon number
of cups containing a mutually agreed
upon quantity of alcohol, and the ability
of players to sip the contents of said cups
dry without turning into complete jackasses. The players that is, not the cups. In
short, exact quantifiers are about as frequent in Beirut as DU pledges are in

McCabe.

But this lack of precision is simply a
reflection of Beirut's status as the
Premier Thinking Game. As Loeffler
explained, Beirut is "at least equal to
bowling, rhythmic gymnastics, billiards
[or] curling." And we all know how much
thinking curling requires. So much thinking that we can't remember what it is.
Similar confirmation of Beirut's special status among the Mental Games
comes from Wiles, who compares Beirut
to "watching TV or going to church,"
other activities in the reasonless sports
category. I make a mental note to do an
investigative report into churchgoing.
In the meantime, I plan to hone my
Beirut skills. I'm perfecting the flick of
the wrist, the elegant splash and the
ingesting of various dirt particles from
the Phi Psi floor. I will need a partner,

though. Any takers? Remember, it's a
thinking game.

KNL: Ele, you seem to be on top of proper pregame
warm-up wear, what is necessary for the Swarthmore
athlete to sport during sports?
ELE: I find that pre-wrap is essential to the pregame
warm-up. It is important that you do not match the opposing team's colors when
keeping the wispy hair at
bay. Yet at the same time,
you must insure that your

KNL: How should one

select a lucky T-shirt?
ELE: Wow, that's a
■
tough question, KNL. I've
had my lucky shirt for as long as I can remember. I suggest finding an old gray t-shirt with writing on it and then
washing or wearing it until threadbare.
KNL: How should the injured athlete incorporate tape,
braces, etc. into fashionable sporting attire?
ELE: Well, as an injured athlete, I've had to tackle that
problem on a daily basis. Black braces are easily incorporated into the athletic outfit because I tend to match
my black brace with my black cleats. Taping is another
matter, however. Since the training room refuses to purchase multiple colors of athletic tape to accommodate the
fashion-minded athlete, one must do one's best with the

off-white version. For the truly concerned, I suggest permanent marker rather than the washable kind for tape
coloring to prevent sweat induced drippage and uniform

staining.
KNL: Ele, what about the daily gear? How do you combine a class outfit with a practice outfit during the day?
ELE: I just wear the same thing all day; sports come
first, naturally. I go for comfort with layers, generally
pairing warm-ups over my spandex/sports bra ensemble.
Of course, the lucky T-shirt can always be seen on game
days in the classroom, despite its transparent nature.

You have to take pin wash for what
it is: you put your laundry in a bag, it
gets washed, and you don't have to
worry about it.
KNL: As all Swarthmore athletes are provided various
services, including towels and laundry from the equipment gurus Dave and Ray, I wonder how you maintain
your clothes. What are your opinions surrounding pin
wash?

ELE: First of all, my lucky T-shirt never goes through
pin wash. I hand wash it, if at all. I've been known to go
three or four games without washing my game attire,
simply because it is important to keep the winning cycle
going. As for my other clothes, pin wash is always used.
Why waste quarters?
KNL: Some athletes complain about the pinkish
nature of their clothes after repeated pin wash use, and it
is rumored that no soap is used. How do you feel about
these complaints?
ELE: I strongly feel that these are not legitimate con-

cerns. You have to take pin wash for what it is: you put
your laundry in a bag, it gets washed, and you don't have
to worry about it. No-nonsense clothes maintenance.
KNL: How about the men? Do you have any thoughts
on what the male Swat athlete should make a point of
including in his athletic wardrobe?
ELE: I have certain dos and don'ts for the guys. First
off, proper underwear is a must. Boxer briefs serve as
fashionable AND functional under-uniform attire. Under
Armor is a personal favorite of mine, the tighter the better. As for headgear, Men should NEVER wear things like
pre-wrap or sweatbands. It just doesn't look good on anyone.
KNL: What about practice gear? It seems that some
men's teams here on campus have a "practice uniform."
What do you think?
ELE: Actually, this is not a choice on their parts. A
coach-imposed policy, I think it limits one's ability to
express himself on the field. For these unfortunate athletes, I suggest supplementing the practice outfit with
carefully selected colorful footwear. They might find a
selection of designs and colors from which to choose.
Gold is never an option, trust me.
KNL: What about the "Swarthmore Athletics" issued
sweats?
ELE: I love the sweat suit. I wear the full ensemble
whenever possible, sometimes rolling the pants up to
mid-calf for a change of look. I highly recommend pairing
the issued T-shirt and shorts as under-layers for a complete look.
KNL: Thank you, Ele Forbes. You are a fabulous, yet
underused fashion resource for the on-campus athlete. Do
you have any parting sporting mantras?
ELE: When selecting an outfit, just keep this one
thought in mind: "Will this make me perform better
today?" If the answer is yes, change

of those in charge of television was sports broadcasting.
No matter what the executives did, each game was different; each highlight reel was like an individual snowflake.
Sports programming began to take a decidedly different
approach, though. Beginning a few years ago, sports shows
that were less about sports and more about reality, or the
journalists covering the sports, began to pop up. This
could be seen with shows on the almighty ESPN, like "The

change of pace to the constant live sports coverage that the

average American had grown accustomed to.
All good things must come to an end, though. This year
found the great ESPN fallen amongst the ranks of the lowly
and lackluster networks. For earlier this year, ESPN stumbled across a veritable goldmine: "Pardon
the
Interruption." "PTI" began to dominate the airwaves, and
the executives at ESPN got the great idea: hey, let's make
more shows like this. And so the downfall began.
For those of you who live in a hole, or simply cannot
watch cable because we are not allowed to have it in our
rooms, "PTI" is the best show on television. Hands down.
The program features two prominent DC columnists, Tony

Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon, each of whom has an

extensive background in radio and TV. The two meet daily
on the air to discuss recent happenings in the sporting
world. The idea was about as fresh as they come. Though
it bit off "The Sports Reporters" slightly, never before had
sports programming featured individuals arguing over

November 14, 2002

opinions. Viewers love the show's edge and humor. The
show played offlike two buddies arguing sports over beers
at the local bar. It was, and still is, brilliant.
Those in charge of ESPN could not have been happier.
Ratings were great; publicity was skyrocketing. It was
then that the idea came to them: let's make all the shows
like this. Soon, Kornheiser and Wilbon were appearing on
"Sportscenter," and segments were introduced into that

show mimicking "PTI." Then, a new show was launched.

"Around the Horn," starring Max Kellerman, is now being
aired directly in front of "PTI."
Where "PTI" succeeds, "Around the Horn" fails miserably. While "PTI" gathers two highly respected journalists
to debate, "Around the Horn" gathers four, mediated by
Kellerman. Kellerman asks questions about the sports
scene, and each journalist is given a chance to respond.
The problem is, these writers have no TV experience, and
it shows. Most have the charisma of your average biology
professor. They are given almost no time to talk, and the
hectic pace of the show is plain confusing.
And do not get me started talking about Kellerman. He
sits there and asks questions like, "What was the worst diet
you were ever on?" or "Who is your all-time favorite football announcer?" Hey Max, "Who gives a rat's ass?" Then,
the little twerp has the audacity to award and detract
points from the respondents. As if Max Kellerman is qualified to judge the answers of these people. It is possibly the
stupidest game show format in the history of television.
At the end of "Around the Horn" today, Max Kellerman
told one of the guest journalists, "No one cares what you
think." Exactly, Max. No one cares what any of you rip-off
artists think. And let me warn you: if you make public

Swimmers split with Widener in home opener

Andrew Steel Phoenix Staff

The women's swim team begins its conference title defense with a home dual meet against F&M this Saturday. After beating Widener last week, the team is off to a 1-1 start.

BY DERRICK WU
dwul@swarthmore.edu

In a prelude to this weekend's meet

conference foe Franklin and
Marshall, the men's swimming team lost
158-142 Widener on Saturday. Since the
team's primary goal was to give every
swimmer the opportunity to qualify for
the Eastern College Athletic Conference
(ECAC) tournament this winter, it did not
always use its strongest lineup during the
meet. The Garnet were therefore relatively satisfied with the narrow margin of
loss. "The men have swum two very good
meets," head coach Sue Davis said.
The women's team also swam well,
defeating Widener 170-131 to rebound from
a loss to New York University the previous
weekend. "The women came back and
swam a good meet against Widener,"
against

Davis said.

The meet was a strenuous workout for

many of the swimmers, since many of
them were swimming extra events to qualify for the ECAC tournament. "It was very
close this year. We all swam a lot of
events," Davita Burkhead-Weiner 'O3 said.
"We did a lot more swimming so people
could qualify for ECAC's."
Swimmers credit Davis' emphasis on
endurance workouts for the team's
impressive times this early in the season.
"Last year we had an interim coach, and

our training method was focused on

sprints and dry land workouts.T personally don't think we had the endurance and
aerobic conditioning," co-captain David
Whitehead 'O3 said. "This season, we have

had endurance workouts since the first
week of the season."
"Practices have been ridiculously hard,
so I was glad to see it payoff [against
Widener this Saturday], Michael Auerbach
'O5 said. "We definitely wanted to win, but
we were happy with the way we swam. We
didn't come out of the meet upset."
Davis' goals and philosophy are simple.
She demands from her swimmers "as
much as they can give me," and her goal is
to "do as well as .we can do in every race."
To get the most out of her swimmers,
Davis is not afraid to employ unconventional instructional methods. During practice on Tuesday, she reinforced proper

breathing techniques by threatening to
strike swimmers with a large wooden
pole. "Sue doesn't always coach us in conventional ways. Sometimes she literally
beats us with large sticks," Auerbach said
jokingly. "I guess it's a good way to
emphasize the little things of swimming."
"One part of my coaching style that has
never changed is try to do the best you can
do," Davis said. "Train as hard as you can
train, and when you get to competition,
compete and dare to see how good you can
be. Coaches will say how we get all those
good swimmers at Swarthmore. We don't.
We make them, and these swimmers are

responsible for their success."
Thus far, the hard work has paid off for

the Tide. The women's team, for example,

is
gunning for its third straight
Centennial Conference Championship.
Despite graduating some key swimmers
from last year's squad, the team has been
bolstered by an impressive freshmen
class. "The freshmen kick ass," Katherine
Jantz 'O5 said.
Even though it's difficult to distinguish
the top freshmen this early into their
careers, co-captain Burkhead-Weiner did
say, "The first name that pops into my
head is Patricia Funk. She's a really good
swimmer."
With the influx of talent, the Tide are
confident they can challenge F&M and
Gettysburg for another conference title. "I
think we're looking better than last year,"
Jantz said.
One year after being blown out against
Widener, the men's team put up a good fight
against bigger and faster swimmers.
Whitehead and Auerbach along with Mike
Dudley 'O3 and John Lillvis 'O3 led the Tide

by combining for seven individual first
place finishes at the meet. "Mike Dudley did
really well," Auerbach said. "Individually I
think he's undefeated this season."
After two warmup meets against NYU
and Widener, the team is putting out its
full-strength lineup against Franklin and

Marshall this Saturday. "F&M is one of
our big rivalries. This Saturday will be

our full strength lineup," Whitehead said.
"We have a really good chance of beating
F&M. We have been swimming very well
early in the season. We'll have a lot of
alumni and parental support."
"I think we have a really good shot. We
really want to beat this team. Personally,
we have issues with them." Auerbach
added.
This could be an exceptional year for
the Tide. After a fourth place finish in the
year's
last
Centennial Conference
Championships, the Tide are returning all
of their swimmers, including seniors
David Whitehead, Mike Dudley and John
Lillvis. "I think we're going to have a good
season, this being the last year for seniors.
We're the true driving force of the team,
and we're going to go all out and hope for
the best," Whitehead said.
"The seniors are great leaders on the
team. They're swimming excellently this
year. It's really inspiring, and we swim
really hard for them," Auerbach said.
The Centennial Conference portion of
the schedule begins this Saturday at Ware
Pool, and the Tide want to see you there.
"We're going to revolutionize the sport by
making it more of a fan-friendly spectator
sport," Auerbach said.
"This meet against F&M this Saturday
is one of the biggest meets of the semester," Jantz said. "F&M is one of our better
competitions, so everyone should come on
down to the pool and watch."
