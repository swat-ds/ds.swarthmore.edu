power themselves," said Christina Sornito
'OO, member of ETS.
KWRU's goal in attending the march was
to "pressure the government to give them a
voice." More specifically, they were protesting Workfare, a new government program
which requires recipients of public assistance
to

Poverty Awareness Week, is organized by
ETS (Empty the Shelters), is an "attempt to
get students interested in issues of poverty,"
explained ETS member JoshKnox' 99. Some
of the planned activities this year included a
rally in Harrisburg, screenings of documentaries about poverty, and fund-raising activities.
About 20,000 people, including about 50
Swarthmore students, participated in a rally
in Harrisburg this past Tuesday, demanding
rights for the poor.
ETS joined ranks withKWRU (Kensington
Welfare Rights Union), which was invited to
participate by union organizers. KWRU is a
local group run by and for homeless and
unemployed people who "are trying to em-

work.

Sornito compares this program to "indentured servitude." The government "advertises people to private companies as cheap
labor" while laying off unionized workers.
Workfare recipients work long hours, receive
few benefits, and earn low wages. A plumber
on workfare makes $2 an hour, while a unionized plumber would make $lB an hour, said
Sornito.
Even though KWRU was not allowed to
speak at the rally, Sornito considered the fact
that they were invited a "first step." After a
rally at the governor's mansion, they marched
to the Poor People's Embassy, a building
where poor people can live and organize.
Obtaining this building was the result of
KWRU's intensive organizing during the past

few years.
In the summer of 1995, about 36 homeless
families set up camp in an abandoned lot in
Philadelphia. Homeless Diaries, which was
shown here this Thursday, is a documentary
made by Francis Negr6n-Mutaner which
chronicles the history of Tent City. Inhabitants of Tent City demanded adequate education, income, and housing as legitimate social
rights. They protested the injustice ofhaving
24,000 homeless people in Philadelphia even
though there are 27,000 abandoned properties in the city.
As a result of recent activism, KWRU has
obtained housing for some of its members.
ETS, an organization of local college students, supports KWRU by providing transportation, baby-sitting children, and mobilizing people for rallies.
ETS also helped organize Art Jam and the
Dance-a-thon which will happen tonight at
the First Unitarian Church Philadelphia. Art
Jam is an art collection about poverty and the
dance-a-thon is a fund-raiserfor the Union of
Homeless.

Psych Services Busier Than Usual
By

Jessica Roney

Psychological Services staff have been
working longer hours and students have had
to wait longer for appointments this semester
as a result of an increasednumber of students
scheduling appointments.
"We got busier sooner in the semester than
usual," said David Ramirez, director of Psychological Services. "Thecrunch" came about
the end of October, when there was one
particularly hectic week, but "all of October
was very, very busy," Ramirez said.
A comparison of one week's figures with
the equivalent week last year shows that there
were "half again as many [students making
appointments with Psychological Services in
that sample week] as last year."
The Psychological Services staff has been
taking shorter breaks for lunch and staying
later at night to accommodate the increased

demand.
According to Ramirez, most students have
been able to schedule an appointment within
four days of calling, but he said it is possible
that some students might have had to wait as
long as two weeks for appointments.
Students who say they have an emergency
are given priority, and every effort is made to
see them the same day, according to Ramirez.
Those who say they can wait are usually seen
within four days unless they insist on seeing
a specific person, in which case the wait
might be longer.
Now the rush has "leveled off some,"
Ramirez said.
He hopes the rise in cases is a demonstration of"confidence in Psych Services" and a
sign that people are looking out for each
other. He said that more faculty have been
calling in to refer students, and that the RAs
have done a wonderful job monitoring the

situation in their halls. He hopes it is a sign
that Psych Services is more "accessible, visible and approachable."
Linda Echols, director of Worth Health
Services, also said that they have had many
more cases than last year. There have been
more than twice as many in-patients this
month than last November. Echols did not
know what the exact percentage was, but said
that many of these cases came not for treatment of specific illnesses, but for rest and
relaxation.
According to Dean Ngina Lythcott, there
are other reasons some students have had a
long wait for an appointment with a therapist.
Many students have tight schedules and need
to schedule appointments at specific times,
while others request specific therapists. "If a
student will see anybody, it will be much
quicker [to schedule an appointment]," she
said.

More Black Studies Classes Offered
By

Kate Doty

Next semester, there will be more courses
in the Black Studies Program than in the past.
Approximately 15 courses are cross-listed
between Black Studies and seven other departments.
On Thursday night, professors and students met at the Black Cultural Center (BCC)
to discuss the various courses offered as well
as the Black Studies Program in general.
Course offerings are only one part of the
ever-expanding Black Studies Program. First
created in 1969, the program has grown gradually over the years as student demand for
courses dealing with African-American issues has increased.
The meeting was part of an ongoing effort
to make students, especially first-years and
sophomores, aware of the Black Studies Program from the beginning of their Swarthmore
careers. "I felt that I needed to broaden my
horizons...[and] learn about the history of
my people," said Jocelyn Kea 'OO.
The lack of PDCs in the Black Studies
courses was of some concern to students, but
according to Jason McGill, visiting instruc-

tor in history, "The program is in the process

of rejuvenating and reinventing itself."
Although the College did not specifically
intend to increase the numberof Black Studies course offerings, "When we make these
[temporary] appointments, we are always
thinking about ways to make things stronger," explained Provost Jennie Keith. For
instance, Eugene M. Lang Visiting Professor
of Social Change John Baugh and Visiting
Instructor of Art History Jurgen W.W.
Heinrichs are both teaching courses next semester that will count towards a concentration in the Black Studies Program.
Seven professors, from the departments of
history, English, psychology, modern languages and literature, and art history gave
brief overviews of their courses in Black
Studies and later fielded questions from students. Black Studies courses are also offered
in the departments of religion, economics,
and music and dance.
Burke and McGill represented the department of history. Burke will be teaching History 8A: Africa in the Era of the Slave Trade,
as well as two sections of an honors seminar.
Burke is interested in "what the African-

American community at Swarthmore thinks"
about the program, and what courses African-American students would like to see offered.
McGill will be teaching a freshman seminar entitled "The History of Race in North
America." The course was created mainly
through students' reactions to History 7A,
"particularly the reactions of the black
students.. .We talk about the question, What
is race? Who has it? Where does it come
from? We will try to answer that," explains
McGill. He aims "to create a space where
folks feel comfortable" discussing the issues.
Jacqueline Goldsby, a minority-scholarin-residence and visiting instructor in English literature, will be teaching a course
about the African American novel and African American literature in the 19th century. It
will be an examination of the political statements about culture which are included in
black works of literature from roughly 1853
to 1912.
Burke summed up the overall feeling of the
Thursday meeting stating, "come talk to us
about courses you'd like to see ...[or find]
helpful or interesting."

Seniors Screen Their
Film About Poverty
By

Toki Rehder

"More than one in five children live in
poverty" flashes across a black screen, thus
beginning the documentary, A Fight for Survival: Voices on Poverty, which is the result
of one and a half years of work by Johanna
Peters-Burton '97 and Dhruvi Kakkad '97.
This film, which premiered this Thursday
as part of Poverty Awareness Week, examines local poverty and homelessness and
chronicles the role of student groups in fighting for change.
According to Peters-Burton, this documentary is "revolutionary" because it is the first to
emphasize the importance of students' role in
the struggle against poverty. It shows "how
we can use resources we have as students."
Kakkad agreed, "We each have a role to play
[in the movement against poverty]. We need
to access the skills we have."
Students can use theireducational skills to
do research about government policy and
activist strategies. In addition, the presence
of students often attracts media attention to
protests and demands of the poor. Empty the
Shelters (ETS) is one student organization
which supports the efforts of homeless and
unemployed people.
The documentary chronicles the cooperative efforts of the Philadelphia-based organization Kensington Welfare Rights Union
(KWRU) and ETS during the past few years.
One sequence, which took place this fall,
shows members ofKWRU and ETS preparing to engage in civil disobedience by refusing to leave the house of a family that was
supposed to be evicted. As a result of their
efforts, the family received enough private
donations that they were allowed to stay.
In addition to the strategy ofcivil disobedience, KWRU and ETS sometimes take over
abandoned homes, a move "which sends a
message to the city and government" said
Kakkad. Various protests and a sleep-a-thon
held in St. Edwards Catholic Church last fall
both raised money and attracted press coverage.
The long term goal of this movement is to
"get people talking about poverty and class
issues in this country," said Beth Green '97,
a Swarthmore student featured in the docu-

mentary who is taking a semester off to work
with KWRU. A homeless man in the documentary stated that currently "the economy is
organized around profit, not human lives."
Kakkad sees the documentary as "a first
step in changing consciousness." Kakkad
hopes that these images documentary will
"incite people to act."
Peters-Burton expressed a similar sentiment. "We want people to be touched," said
Peters-Burton, because these images "touched
our hearts and minds." They chose to use
film, "one of the most powerful mediums,"
because it can show images that are often
difficult to put into words.
Currently, Peters-Burton and Kakkad are
creating a curriculum on poverty and
homelessness to complement their documentary. Next semester, they plan to present their
work at local colleges and high schools.
The Lang Opportunity Program provided
funding for this project. It is part of PetersBurton's Lang Project and senior thesis and
an independent study project for Kakkad.
Funding was also obtained from the Philadelphia Youth Action Fund and Chestnut Hill
Friends Meeting. It was produced in collaboration with Laura Jackson of Nightingale
Production, whom the filmmakers met when
she taught the course "Non-violence and Social Change" at Swarthmore two years ago.
Kakkad and Peters-Burton's documentary
closes with a quote by Margaret Mead: "Never
doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committedcitizens can change the world; indeed,
it's the only thing that ever does." Indeed, the
work of Peters-Burton, Kakkad, and other
members of ETS is a testimony to this fact.
The Thursday screening at LPAC cinema
played to a mostly full house. It was well
received by those present. "They did a really
good job portraying the history of empty the
shelters movement and documenting the students and the people' s passion for that movement. I was in tears because it was so power-

ful," said Chloe Dowley '99.
"I felt that the film was an excellent depiction of the realities and experiences of
Kensington Welfare Rights Union and the
Unionof the Homeless, programsETS works
with," said Michael Williams '9B, a member
of Empty the Shelters.

As a possible solution to the crowding at Sharpies at peak lunch hours, Dining
Services will soon be offering box lunches in Tarble lobby.
The box lunches, which will be available from noon to 1:30 pm on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Thursdays, will contain a sandwich, fruit, dessert, and a beverage.
There will also be a vegetarian option.
According to Dining Services Director Linda McDougall, this new service will
start next Tuesday, November 26, though she is still trying to gauge student interest.
Jon Temin 'OO thought the box lunches would be a "good idea," while Becca
Newlin 'OO said, "Nobody will get them because people like to make their own
lunches...unless you're going to lab. Then it's a good idea."

SC Discusses College
Size, Support Groups
By

Josh Kramer

At last Sunday' s meeting, Student Council

made a number of decisions regarding a report that they will soon submit to various
College committees regarding aspects of the
size of the College. They also discussed plans
for a retreat during which they hope to address the futurerole ofcampus support groups.
Student Council plans to contact a number
ofstudents in order to solicit outside views on
how growth of the College would effect the
student body. At the previous meeting, however, Student Council became bogged down
in technicalities regarding the method by
which the report would be delegated, and
therefore requested that various proposals
regarding the exact method of writing the
report be brought in writing to this meeting.
A number ofproposals for how to structure
the report on the size of the College were
submitted, including sophomore Will
Nessly's proposal to create thirteen general
issues, and assign oversight of each section to
an individual member of student council. In
Nessly's proposal, after the individual members reported their findings to the Council as
a whole, the Council would then create a
questionnaire, distribute this questionnaire to
the students, and tabulate the results to aid to
the next council in writing general position
papers to various committees and to the school
at large. This would be completed before the
CPC finalizes its long range planning.
Giridhar Srinivasan '9B offered an alternative, recommending delegating the report on
the size of the College to a work group composed ofStudent Council members and other
students with interest and giving the Council
final oversight. According to Srinivasan, however, "Not too much was taken from [my
proposal]."
Finally, Alyssa Rayman-Read '99 offered
an addition to either proposal during the ensuing discussion, asking that Student Council
begin the process by doing research on their
own, and, additionally, offering a student
body meeting part way through the procedure, calling this forum a "pause button" in
the process. This proposal was actively supported by Nessly and Josh Alloy '9B.
In the end, Student Council approved a less
sine i versi< >n of Nessly' s pi opot al, combined
with Rayrr:;in-Read"s pro, osal. The final decision delegated various sections of the re-

World

port to any interested student, with oversight
from Student Council at the very end. Included was the expectation that an open meeting would soon take place to discuss the
report, and to include the entire student body
in brainstorming about the overall effects of
changes in the size of the college.
Student Council also approved a grant application to the Hewlett foundation, requesting money to fund a Student Leadership
Retreat, whose topic would be
"Multiculturalism, Support Groups and the
Law: The Civil Rights Restoration Act and
the Future of Exclusionary Groups at
Swarthmore College." This was the first Student Council had seen of such an application,
which was co-authored by Barney and Jen

Leigh, Coordinator of Student Activities.
Leigh first became involved when she attended a long-range planning procedure forum at the beginning of the academic year,
which she reported to StudentCouncil on two
weeks ago.
There were arguments both for and against
this proposal. Some members of studentcouncil, such as Andrew Lund '99, felt that this
forum was only going to further serve as an
opportunity to attack support groups, while
Sean Barney '9B felt the forum was a necessity, stating "I'm not going to sit on any more
charter appeals on these groups unless we sit
down and discuss this."
Many members of Student Council expressed the belief that the support groups
were in directviolation ofthe law, though this
was questioned by former IC Director,
Fernando Chang-Muy, who was unavailable
for comment.
In addition, Rayman-Read expressed the
sentiment that having a discussion regarding
support groups might "lower our liability.. .in
regards to the support groups." Executive
board members of the Swarthmore Asian
Organization, Swarthmore African American Students Society, Hispanic Organization
for Latino Awareness, and the Swarthmore
Queer Union were not able to be reached for
comment in time for publication.
The final vote on the proposal was six to
one in favor of the application with two
abstentions. Alloy, Nessly, Barney, Rachel
Henighan '97, Chris Seaman '99 and Edgar
Lee '9B voted for the proposal, Lund voted
against, while Srinivasan and Seth H:>rvey
'97 abstained.

Swarthmoreâ€™s small, and we like it that way.
Swarthmore is a very small school. We all know that. Many of us
considered the smallness as one of the major factors that drew us to
Swarthmore. Most of us like small schools. That's why we're here. We like
the sense of community that comes along with attending a small collegeâ€”the ability to sit in Kohlberg Commons and bump into students and
professors alike; the opportunity to have small, engaging classes; and the
feeling of familiarity that has become a near-tradition on the Swarthmore
campus which encourages us to smile and greet strangers we pass on the
path. After all, we're all Swatties, and since there aren't that many of us, we
have to stick together.
So we find the idea of expanding the size of the College, even thoueh it iÂ«
only under preliminary consideration, a bit troubling. Several different
Collegecommittees haverecommended or considered increasing the school's
size by approximately two or three hundred students. While that may not
sound like a tremendous amount, it could change the nature of many of the
institutions that make Swarthmore the kind of place it now is.
We'd clearly need another dining hall, as Sharpies is already overcrowded. However, the atmosphere at Sharpies, where you can bump into
anyone and everyone, and run into people you haven't seen in weeks, is a
building block of our sense of community. The addition of another dining
hall would destroy that collegiality.
More students would also affect the atmosphere made possible by a very
closely-knit student body. We refer to many of our professors by their first
names and haveoften visited theirhomes. When we talk about conservatives
on campus, we can list them by name. Members of the administrationknow
most of us by sight and a reasonable proportion of us by name. We think
that's good, and much of it is unique to a school of our size.
In the end, regardless of whetheryou agree with us that the College should
stay about the size it is now, we think you should be involved in deciding
whether or not we grow larger. Although the College insists that it is not
currently planning on increasing the student population, the number of task
forces that havebeen created to study the option suggest thatit is being taken
more seriously than some would like us to believe.
So far, these committees have been driven by proposals like those of
professors wanting to expand the available lists of courses, add specialists
to their departments, and allow them more time to do research. These are all
laudable goals for the school, but in the end, professors shouldn'tbe the ones
to determine whether or not to expand. We should make that choice.
If the College wantsto be able to broadenits class selection, it shouldlook
into expanding the underused option available to us nowâ€”furtherutilization
of the faculty and classes at Bryn Mawr and Haverford. Next semester,
Patricia White, assistant professor of English at Swarthmore, is co-teaching
a class with Professor Sharon Ullman on the Bryn Mawr campus; a similar
joint effort has been undertaken by Hans-Jakob Werlen, associate professor
of German at Swarthmore, and a Bryn Mawr German professor. We
encourage this attempt to increase interaction not only between the students
of the three colleges, but also the professors.
While we realize that faculty and administrators are essential to what
happens to the College, the expansion of the student body is one decision in
which students' voices should play a primary role.

Psychological Services needs College support.
The diligence of the current Psychological Services staff in light of the
recent influx of students is certainly laudable, but perhaps the College needs
to consider whether this increase in demand has any significant long-term

implications.

At the same time that increased use of Psych Services may be perceived
as a sign of confidence in this portion of the College's support network, it
also reveals the necessity for considering expansion. The College should
allow for some flexibility in allocating funds for hiring more staff for fsych
Services. At this point, at least part of the appointment bottleneck i. due to
students' busy schedules and desire to see particular psychologists. Hiring
a larger and more permanent staff would not only lessen the work load of the
current staff, but might also establish more options for students seeking to
schedule appointments.

BCC/IC interaction should continue.
There have been several encouraging signs of collaborative activity
between the Intercultural Center (IC) and the Black Cultural Center (BCC)
of late, but the possibilities for interaction have been far from exhausted.
Last Monday, members of the Swarthmore African-American Students
Society (S ASS), the Hispanic Organization for Latino Awareness (HOLA),
Swarthmore Asian Organization (SAO), and Swarthmore Queer Union
(SQU) joined for a hearty meal in the BCC. But the event conflicted with one
organized by SAO, thus revealing the need for more careful planning for
future events.
Support groups of the IC and BCC have jointly endorsed an open letter to
the community against bigotry; solidarity among these and other organizations demonstrate that this is one community which will not let itself
succumb to the divisive potential ofhateful expression. And two weeks ago,
the BC and ICC co-hosted a talent night, which revealed that Swatties'
talents really do extend beyond just churning out papers and problem sets.
But in order for such interaction to continue, members of all constituent
groups must feel that they have a stake in its success. Organizing more joint
social and community service events can only bring us closer to this ideal.

We were stupid. Again.
In a correction last week, we misidentifiedthe faculty member in a recent
photo of the Kohlberg Cappuccino Bar as Brian Schwartz. It was actually
Barry Schwartz, associate provost of the College and professor of psychology, who appeared in the picture.

The Republican Congressional

takeover of 1994 triggered a rebirth
of the Left and of the Democratic
Party. Since then, various segments
ofthe liberal/progressive community
have been successfully organizing
against the archaic agenda ofthe radical Right extremists. The actions of
labor unions in this country beautifully demonstrate the renewed and
improved efforts of leftleaning activists as well as
groups. President Clinton's
reelection in
November
further illustrated the ascendancy of the Left.
Although I'm excited by this turn
ofevents, I'm somewhat nervous that
this renewed sense ofpurposeamong
liberal/progressive activists will begin to wane without the presence of a
strong opposing force. The rapid rise
of Newt Ginonoh and his
neoconservative
provided
nemocrats and leftists activists an
enemy on whom to focus their legislative efforts.
I'm afraid that the loss of Gingrich
and crew to rally against will have a
significant impact because liberals
and progressives seem to have this

fear ofand/or inability to build institutions which can sustain progressive action over a prolonged period
of time.
Generally, leftists place a negative
connotation on institutions and their
potential for perpetuating the status
quo. However, in doing so, the positive potential latent in institutions
based upon progressive principles and
organized in forward-thinking ways,
is completely ignored.
The Right has been extremely successful largely because of well-organized structures which effectively link
together various segments of their
movement and last beyond the involvement of a charismatic leader.
For example, several conservative
research organizations or "think
tanks" have and continue to churn out
public policy proposals whichweaken
the ability of the nation to provide for
all ofits citizens, protect civil rights,
and advance social justice.
The passage ofCalifornia's Proposition 209, the so-called "California
Civil Rights Initiative," attests to the
effectiveness of such organizations.
Moreover, their high-paid researchers produce propaganda disguised as
scholarly writing to advance their
archaic agenda and gain acceptance
among the masses.
As a result, the liberal/progressive
community has only been able to
gain enough strength to fight the attacks of such well-organized endeavors. As yet, not much energy has been
placed on shaping the political de-

Can We Ameliorate
Chester's Problems?
By Bryan

Gobin

Our College community has the

opportunity to help initiate the process of economic revitalization in
Chester, a microcosm ofall the worst
aspects of urban decay. By all statistical measures (health, crime, unemployment, educationalattainmentlevels, drug use, social integration, etc.),
Chester is considered one of the most
impoverished cities in the nation.
With a population of48,000 residing
in 4.5 square miles, the problems
facing this city should be manageable. This distraught city could provide a laboratory for social experiments that could provide lessons and
models instructive to policymakers
searching for solutions to widespread
urban ailments.
If theCollege expanded itsinvolvement in the city, it would have to
identify the most effective point of
entry for using its resources to achieve
the maximum payoff for both the
College and the community. The research and pedagogy of faculty combined with student interests would
have to be matched to theneeds of the
community. This would most likely
occur at the policy level as opposed
to the grassroots level or any position
within an organization below the up|j<-i

echelons.

Although grassroots work appeals
to idealistic notions of democratic
values and collective action, given
the limited resources of our institution, we should apply our resources
at the level where we can obtain the
most benefits for the most people.
The argument for grassroots work
rests on the assumption that the targeted group will develop the leadership and skills necessary to pursue
their own interests within the context
of their particular situation. In certain situations, grassroots work may
be feasible; however, in Chester, the
efficacy of grassroots work is questionable given the demographics of
the population and the economic and
political characteristics of the city.
Moreover, the longevity, intensity,
and scope of work required by any
high-payoff grassroots work in
Chester extends well beyond the
available resources and mission of
the College.
Although it is necessary to keep an
attentive ear to the concerns of the
poor, it is not realistic to expect them
to have the skills, leadership, and
expertise necessary to tackle the long
range planning and implementation
of the programs needed to revitalize
their communities. However, through
training, education, and experience,
the poor could develop the skills to
become more self-sufficient and integrated into society. It is noteworthy
that Chester resident leaders have
shown skill and savvy in responding
to certain crisis situations. Yet these
leaders need assistance in formulating policies to anticipate crisis situations in order to preclude them. Crisis
management is a typical characteristic of many grassroots organizations

managed by low income residents.
Conditions in Chester are extremely
unfavorable for grassroots work. The
poor often don't vote, usually have
marginal if any employment, and
don't have basic skills. For example,
take the average headof household in
Chester public housing. She is female and poor with a 7th or Bth grade
education level and has a 40 percent
chance of being functidnally illiterate. Although it might be possible to
organize public housing residents, it
would take a massive effort. A number of attempts have been made to
organize public housing residents
with only limited success. Two of the
major initiatives included the National Tenant Management Demonstration Project and a multimillion
dollarHUD-sponsored grant program
to aid resident councils across the
country. Program evaluations revealed that resident councils had extreme difficulty addressing basic organizational activitiesâ€”setting agendas and conducting meetings, dealing with group dynamics, and planning and implementing activities.
Until they developed these skills, they
could not effectively engage in any
activities. Most Swarthmore college
students learned some basic organizational skills while involved with
idikli" teams, student councils, Key
clubs, anr l <->!her such activities Unfortunately, most public housing residents nevci had tho opportunity to
develop these skills through education or employment activities, and
therefore cannot even conceptualize
the steps that must be taken to improve their living situation. Teaching such skills to adults is highly
problematic, even in the most favorable ofcircumstances.
Our public policy objectives should
address these deep social problems.
HUD is pumping millions of dollars
into Chester to provide bricks-andmortar solutions as well as job training and employment opportunities to
residents. Unfortunately, the Chester
Housing Authority (CHA), which
administers these funds, needs assistance in making sure that programs
are developed to maximize the benefits to Chesterresidents. So far, hundreds of thousands of dollars have
disappeared from CHA, which was
less than diligent in making sure that
contractors complied with regulations
requiring employment opportunities
to low income residents and minority
contractors. Public housing residents
are too disorganized and lack the
sufficient resources necessary to influence CHA decisionmakers.
However, the College has the necessary prestige and resources to organize a Task Force that could negotiate a more favorable outcome for
residents. Jobs and training represent the only viable solutions to poverty and low skills. Presently, the
millions in HUD funds represent the
only hope for the city. These funds
also represent the biggest opportunity for the College to work at the
policy level.

bate and propounding progressive
alternatives by the Left.
This can be attributed to the tendency ofmany liberals to react without thinking about the pros and cons
of such actions and to the absence of
strong institutions working to embed
progressive policies, frameworks and
ideologies into the fabric of this great
nation of ours.
Without such bodies, I believe the
Left will have considerable difficulty
sustaining the remarkable progress
made in the past few years despite the
adversarial political climate.This will
happen largely because the enemy
will become harder to identify and
the charismatic leaders of the Left
will change, burn out, sell out, pass
away or be assassinated. Unfortunately, conservatives will be perfectly
poised to take advantage of that situation when it occurs because of their

well-organized political institutions.
With that said, I desperately hope
the liberal/progressive activists on
campus and in the broader community, conceptualize action in both the
short and long terms. Otherwise, any
positive results from the most wellplanned action will probably last only
until the next issue enters center stage.
This can be avoided through institutionalizing progressive action.
Granted, the potential exists in
building institutions to exacerbate
current or latent problems, inadvertently alienate important allies, or
highlight tensions between arbitrarily
devised coalitions, if much attention
is not placed upon the process utilized and the people involved. However, these problems can be easily
avoided with careful planning, clearly
defined goals and an inclusive political process.

Non-English Speech
Poses Little Threat

With the new wave of immigration
to the United States, intolerance and

fear have surgedâ€”immigrants are
being blamed for the country's misfortunes (crime, budget deficits, etc.)
as they have been all throughout history. Legislation like English-only
has become the symbol of the increasing xenophobic sentiment in the
United States.
The English-only movement seeks
to regulate language by restricting or
prohibiting the use of any language
other than English in government
agencies and federal documents. Supporters want the federal government
to declare English the "official" language of the U.S., supposedly to accelerate the acquisition of English by
immigrants and to discourage the
persistence of "linguistic ghettos."
But how is the English-only movement going to accomplish this when
it is not really changing what already
exists? According to U.S. News &
World Report, 96 percent of all federal documents exist only in English
and 97 percent ofthe country' s population speaks English. So exactly what
is there to fear?
English-only has fabricated myths
and created imaginaryperils, leading
73 percent of the nation's population
to agree with this mentality. This
movement has been given life by
resentment stemming from the increase of immigration and the perceived threat to people's jobs and
safety. The English-only movement's
policies are a form of discrimination
and oppression that violate the constitutional right offreedom ofspeech.
The proliferation of state and local
English-only laws has led to a flurry
of language discrimination and lawsuits, recorded by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
In Monterey, California, Asian books

were removed from library shelves
and business signs were asked to be
put down because they were not in
English. Courts have even endorsed
laws that call for exclusive use of
English on the job, giving employers
an unquestioned license to discriminate.

The implications of the surging
discrimination against different ethnic groups is also evident at Swarthmore. When I first came here, I
thought I didn't have to experience
the hatred and intolerance that has
spread throughout the United States,
but I was wrong. I had only been here
forabout two months when I was told
by a student, "If you want to speak
Spanish, then go back to where you
came from!" These words weren't
just ignorant, considering I was already in my country, but they expressed the xenophobia and intolerance that the United States is experiencing. Spanish seemed to threaten
the person who spurted, these words
ofhatred and brought out the insecurities that he and many Americans are
experiencing. The words "go back to
where you came from" hurt me and
shattered my image of Swarthmore.
How was I going to make Swarthmore my home when people felt
threatened by my native language?
Spanish is part of who I am, of my
identity, and it is not something that
can be taken away by ignorant comments or an English-only law.
As a community, we must help
deter incidents like this and fight laws
such as English-only, if we want to
stop hatred and fear. We can't just sit
back and let the silence lull us. We
must actively oppose the politics of
fear in our daily life to prevent injustices like this from occurring. We are
a learning community. How can we
learnab< >ut the rest of the worldwhen
we refuse to respect and learn about a
fellow college student?

The Republican Party
Faces the Wrath of
Exclusive Policies
Excluding women and
minorities proves harmful
to the future of the GOP
By

Brendan

Nyhan

The Republican Party has never been known
for being inclusive. An increasingly powerful group of GOP moderates want to change
that, but, in the process, may threaten the
coalition that the party has ridden to two
Congressional majorities. Thus, an emerging
issue in American politics is the split in the
Republican Party.
The party is now seeing a wave of dynamic
and popular moderates who want a more
diverse, welcoming Republican Party that
appeals to centrists and minorities. The GOP
internal strife will become increasingly apparent as candidates and factions jockey for
positions for the elections in 1998 and 2000.
This issue exists within the Democratic Party
as well, but in a different, less severe form.
Liberals and "New Democrats" have major
differencesbut the threat of government controlled by Newt and the boys has pushed
everyone into line. Republicans don't have
that impetus to come together (because the
Democratic Party isn't looming as any sort of
political force).
Increasingly, women and non-whites are
being alienated by the Republican Party, leaving, as usual, a core of white males. Moderates have new vigor after the election as
women and minorities supported the Democratic Party in the presidential race in even
greater numbers than usual. Bill Clinton lost
California with white males (by one point
according to exit polling) but got over 70
percent ofthe vote from every minority group.
The traditionally large gender gap was sixteen points, back up from a five point gap in
1992. Results like this embolden moderates
within the party, because, quite simply, the
GOP's conservative agenda pushed these
people away.
Bill Clinton won because he captured the
political center and Bob Dole did not. The
reason for this, in large part, is the fact that
Dole owed the Republican Right. Party activists overwhelmingly are Christian conservatives, meaning that candidates seeking party
support must have similar views. Dole had to
take conservative positions because of these
circumstances. Without the foot soldiers behind him, the force behind the 1994 Congressional rout, Dole would have lost a great deal
of votes. On the other hand, he might have
been able to appeal to more moderate swing
voters and perhaps capture a greater number
of votes. It's the Republican Catch-22.
The 104th Congress brought matters to a
head.The conservative right fought to cut
immigration, both legal and illegal, while

originated with the 1994 Republican "ConClinton packed the
reform into his portfolio, was praised for his
excellent work, and did not allow welfare to
become a campaign issue. It is precisely this
example which leads me to believe that similar things will happen during the next four
tract with America." Still,

passing draconian welfare "reform" and other
entitlement cuts. All this hurt the poor, who
are disproportionately racial minorities.
Women tend to be more moderate on social
issues than men, and were offendedby, among
other things, attacks on abortion rights, gun
control, and affirmative action. The result of
all this was strong minority and female support for the Democrats.
Moderates want to takeback the GOP. The
most prominent, and divisive, moderate candidate is Colin Powell. He would be a more
palatable Republican candidate to the general public. A consummate Washington insider, Powell is a non-threatening black man
who Americans (at least say) they will vote
for. While a supporter of smaller government, free enterprise and entitlement cuts, he
is in favor of some forms of affirmative
action and opposes drastic slashing of the
safety net. This, of course, infuriates the
right. However, the party realizes his appeal
and tried to capitalize on his popularity
through speeches at the convention and with
Dole on the campaign trail.
Powell's greatest challenge, if he runs, lies
in the primaries, as it does for any centrist.
Republican primary voters tend to be more
conservative than Republican voters in the
general election. If he can overcome this,
though, Powell has a great deal of appeal to
centrists in both parties and independents
the vast majority of the electorate.
If Powell or any other moderate captures
the nomination, the right certainly won' t help
the candidate. Possibly, the far right wing,
led by the Christian Coalition, bites the bullet
and runs a third party conservative. Several
conservative candidates are already being
bandied about as prospects should Powell or
anothermoderate of his ilk capture the nomination. Any such candidacy ensures a Democratic victory by splitting the Republican
vote, but perhaps the right is willing to do that
to assert its power within the Republican
Party.
Is this scenario plausible? Possibly. However, Powell has beenallowed to rise through
thewhite-dominatedpower structure because
he plays the gameand doesn't cause trouble.
He probably will back out of running when
confronted with the scenario of tearing apart
the Republican Party (if media scrutiny isn't
thereason). The conflict exists, and a Powell
cop-out doesn't mean that moderates won't
still push hard for the nomination of one of
their own.
The prospect of anotherDemocratic presidency after two Clinton terms will pressure
the Republican factions to reconcile. Ultimately, the GOP's challenge is to find a
candidate who bridges the gap between the
two groups, who is more centrist than Dole
yet supported by the right and its minions. If
this person doesn't appear, then start saying it
nowâ€”Gore in 2000.

Now that the elections are over, President
Clinton has four more years to produce accomplishments for the history books. Along
with the notion of making history, the President continues to press on with his "bipartisanship" slogan. But, it seems thatthis "working together" may not be for policy sake
alone, but for his own political well-being.
Why else would Clinton want to see our
political parties lose their identities? Just
think: if we were all meant to agree on issues,
we would not have the Republican and Democratic parties.
Our parties are based on fundamentally
different political philosophies, which the
president shouldrespect. On November fifth,
American voters showed their strong support
for a divided government precisely for this
reason. They wanted to make sure that Republicans were present and in the majority in
order to keep a check on the Clinton White
House.
Also, Mr. Clinton may be blurring party
distinctions because he wants to take credit
for ideas that are not his own. The policies he
deems "bipartisan" are actually those which
he robbed from the Republican party.
For example, rlurine the elections, Clinton
took credit for wel fare reform. But, he robbed
the plan to overhaul the U.S.Welfare system

years.

If we see a balanced budget amendment to
the Constitution, Mr. Clinton will take the
full credit. If Congress prolongs the life of the
Medicare Trust Fund, the president will get
the applause. Despite the fact that these policies have been traditionally Republican, Mr.
Clinton will walk away with the credit and
will be remembered this way. The only way
to attain this great status is to blur party lines.
By trying to convince the American people
that he wants to pass effective policies and
not quarrel about petty matters, Mr. Clinton
may hope to discourage Congressional Republicans from investigating his participation in various scandals, that isâ€”filegate,
travelgate, and Indonesian campaign contributions. If this is the case, the President is
once again deceiving the American people
with his false show of good faith.
He must beware, though. He cannot use his
charisma and sweet talk to distract independent, non-partisan commissions such as the
Whitewater committee headed by Kenneth
Starr.

Hence, if the president is investigated, he
probed by an independent commission. The Republicans must make sure that
Clinton's "bipartisan" showmen are not too
revolutionary, because if the Republicans
take the offensive they might injure their
plans for the 1998 and 2000 elections.
This, however, does not only have to apply
to ethical investigations. Senator Trent Lott,
the Senate majority leader, has decided to
take a similar route in policy initiatives. After
the President accused the Republicans of
shutting down the government and cutting
Medicare for elderly Americans during the
elections, Senator Lott stipulated that the
President set the agenda.
The President is in a bind now. He is
probably asking himselfwhether he wants to
put forth proposals for the Federal Budget
and Medicarethat align withhis philosophies
or those which he can pass through Congress.
I tend to believe that he will choose the
second optionâ€”again, for his own political
well being.
Clintonknows that he must keep himself in
a favorable light with the American people to
ward off ethics investigations.
So, when Bill Clinton talks about "bipartisanship," do not be fooled. Please realize that
he is not as concerned with the amelioration
ofAmerica's problems as with shoveling out
the rising water from his leaky boat.

Counterpoint
Bipartisanship isn't an Excuse, But it is Harmful to the Goals
By

Fred Bush

Clinton is a weenie.
It's hard for me to speak so nastily of a
Democrat, especially a Democrat who has
just been reelected to the presidency, but
Clinton seems to be disavowing more and
more of the ideals I cherish.Thus, I find it
easy to rip on him in kind.
After an initial flurry of true liberal
policymaking culminating in his failed redesign of the welfare system, Clinton slipped
into a pitiful centrist tango, moving to the
beat of his opinion pollsters.
Clinton's clever plan was to take popular
stances on divisive political issues in order to
get reelected. He did, and it worked. With his
passage of the popular but ideologically bankrupt Defense of Marriage Act, Communications Decency Act, and Welfare Reform Act,
to name a few bills I'm particularly incensed
about, Clinton took the road of least resistance.

By embracing these right-wing policies,
Clinton hurt the cause of the Democratic
party. Democrats got nowhere in the Senate,
and gained a paltry few seats in the House, at
a time when popularity for Newt Gingrich

and the "Contract with America" is at an alltime low. With a popular Democratic president and a demoralized and discredited Republican Congressional majority, more Senate and House seats should have gone Democrat.

If Clinton had focused on Democratic ideas
during his term of office, if he had consistently and properly touted the liberal ideals
that got him elected in the first place, then
perhaps his comrades in the Senateand House
races would have been able to ride his coattails to success.
Instead, all we heard at the national level
was crime, crime, crime, taxes, taxes, taxes,
welfare reform, welfare reform, welfare reform. On these issues, Clinton was advocating positions contrary to most of the Democrats running for office.
Americans were hearing a popular president speaking about important political issues, and he was going against his own party.
While he could have spoken about things like
Americorps, his environmentalwork, orheck,
his two principled vetoes of the Welfare Reform Act â€”which would have been more in
league with Democratic idealâ€”he instead
chose to focus his campaign on issues that

of the Democratic Party

made Republicans look good. Clinton could
have won without this ideological aboutface, and such a win would have helped other
Democrats.
Now, Neena would have you believe that
Clinton's doing this to buy off the Republicans so they won't investigate him. I don't
think so. Good oP Alphonse D'Amato, perpetual embarrassment to the state of New
York, will make sure that Whitewater never
dies, and the Republicans could still get lots
of play out of an impeachment. Besides, it
would allhavebeen academic ifClinton had
lost the election. No one would have cared,
and the Congressional investigations would
have died. Clearly, Clinton's first priority
was reelection, and obviously the voters don't
care about ethics.
There's plenty ofevidence that Clinton is a
corrupt slimeball who regularly chased skirts.
He's also a smooth policymaker who'sended
wars on three continents, presided over a
growing economy, and felt our pain through
numerous terrorist acts and a bomb-scarred
Olympics. Voters care about the public
Clinton, not the private Clinton, and Clinton
knows this. He's a smart puppy.
But he's still a weenie.

Solutions to Lack

of Student Space May Be Forthcoming

In the fall of 1995, Student Council
conducted a survey of student preferences for campus improvements. The
results showed thatstudents were primarily interested in a new dormitory
and a student center. SC members
Seth Harvey '97 and Rahul Sakhuja
'9B then made recommendations for
improving Tarble in response to student interest in a real student space.
While the administration never acted
upon their recommendations, Seth
and Rahul's work on this issue led to
the creation of an ad-hoc committee
to examine Tarble and consider renovations which would make it a more

effective student space.
The Tarble Renovation Committee commissioned an architect to examine the building, and her suggestions are being considered, though no
renovations are planned as of now.
The proposed changes include creating more lounge space on the first
floor, changing traffic patterns around
Essie Mae's to make better use of the
lounge space, and opening up and
renovating the office space in the
back of Tarble.
Thearchitect is constrained by several factors, however, because of the
construction of the building and the
needs of the college. First, because
the windows are so high, the corridors on either side of the main level
must be preserved to ensure some
natural light in the building. Second,
the heating and cooling ducts in the
building predetermine the location of
walls and dividers. Finally, the College has no meeting/banquet room as
large as Tarble all-campus space, and
therefore, any renovations cannot disturb that room.
Itmay be that, given its constraints,
Tarble can never be the student center for this campus. In that case, the
college needs to explore other possibilitiesfor a long-term solution.There
are several which readily present
themselves. First, the college could
construct an entirely new building,
giving the architect the freedom to
plan the structure around student
needs and input. Second, the college
could renovate Old Tarble, once a
very well-used student center before
it burned.
While considering all these options,
ihe questions we should be asking
ourselves are: where do students

gather now and why? For example,
the first floor of Parrish, our de facto
student center, is where most campus
communication happens already.
Students gather in Parrish Parlours
and communicate information on the
walls of Parrish. The College needs
to consider learning from and capitalizing on these student spaces which
already exist.
It is important to keep in mind that
any renovations to Tarble or construction of a new student center will
not delay or prevent the construction
of a new dorm, the expansion of the
library, or renovations ofParrish, and
it will not negatively impact financial
aid. The student body should not feel
that this is an either-or proposition.
As the College continues its long
range planning process over the next
year and a half, the short and long
term plans for student space on this
campus will be addressed. The undersigned are advising the Tarble
Renovation Committee about student
interests in a student center, and, as
the process continues we will be seeking your input into our recommendations.
We are writing this letter for two
reasons. First, we would like all students to be aware of the history of this
discussion and that it is continuing.
Second, we would like any student
withparticular interest in this issue or
with strong feelings to contact us
with your concerns.

SAC Sadly Misjudged the Worth
To the Editor,
In writing this letter, the residents
of Woolman hope to help remedy
issues that we see with the mechanisms for student funding.
We are not trying to bash SAC; we
simply feel that there are problems
and loopholes that need to be corrected.
Woolman tried to host a free, SAC
funded preformal under the rationale
that we don't often have parties and
that an event held before the weather
turns bitterly cold would maximize
the number of people who would
attend.
We thought we would draw a different crowd than the Parrish
preformal and wouldthus not be competing with them, and that this would
be an opportunity to bring people to
Woolman whowould otherwise never
come.
Also, we had a live jazz band lined
up. Despite these conditions, we were
denied funding because SAC thought
(or told us) that no one would go to
our preformal.

of Woolman

We had thought that SAC's responsibility was to help fund diverse
settings for parties in terms of who
applies and who attends, so that there
will unique party options for the campus.
Instead, we were disadvantaged by
Woolman not being mainstream or
central enough.
Wasn't funding our only party this
year a risk they could take for the
sake of brightening and broadening
the campus's party horizons for one
evening? Doesn't everyone complain
that therearen'tenough differentparties anyway?
Despite SAC's reasoning, and despite competing with at least four
other preformals, we had 178 people
sign our guest register, not including
Woolman residents and those who
didn't sign.
This makes us wonderwhat would
have constituted enough interest to
warrant funding.
We also wonder how many people
knew about or went to one of the
preformals that SAC did fund which

was advertised over an email list instead of publicly as an all-campus
party.
We feel that the following are necessary:
â€”Some method of recourse for
students who are denied funding for
what they feel is a legitimate request.
â€”Guidelines governing advertisement of all-campus events, and consequences for those who abuse the
terms of granting of SAC funds (retroactive revocation of funds, a fine,

etc.)

Minimum Wage Laws Prevent Maximum Employment
To the Editor,
Last week Vincent Jones wrote
about how changes in the market adversely effect blacks.
He writes that "[l]nstead of building factories or plants in urban areas,
business-persons have begun setting
and moving their operations overseas to exploit cheaper labor and less
strict governmental regulations.
Hence, Black people have lost their
primary source of jobs."
I could not help thinking that the
minimum wage law is one of the

regulations that creates unemployment.

In Free to Choose, Milton and Rose
Friedman wrote that "We regard the
minimum wage rate as one of the
most, if not the most, antiblack laws
on the statute books."
This is because such a law makes it
illegal for people to work below the
hourly wage of $5.15. Many of those
hurt by this law, whose skills have
market value less than the minimum
wage, are black.
If government did not forbid cer-

tain economic relationships among
people, would someone's employment be "exploitation," or a source of
income and a means to developing
skills to acquire better jobs in the
future?
I can not tell whether Jones thinks
it is good that American workers are
not working, as it would be "exploitation," or that they should have the
opportunity that foreign workers
have: to sell their skills at market
value.

plan would involve excavating the
field and building two levels of parking, one slightly below ground level
and one beneath that. The field itself
would remain, but would be raised
approximately eight feet. The students believe that the quality of the
rugby field would in factbe enhanced
by theconstruction ofan underground
parking garage. Thefield is currently
in a slight depression, which has
caused drainageproblems in the past.
If the garage were constructed, the
field would be above the level of the
surrounding area. Furthermore, ifthe
garage is built, an effective drainage
scheme would have to be designed to
avoid flooding in the lower level.

The structure itself would probably be made of pre-cast concrete
sections. Each section wouldbe made
off-site and transported to Swarthmore on large trucks. Pre-cast concrete has numerous advantages over
poured-in-place alternatives, the most
significant of which is the speed of
construction that it offers.
The students estimate that the garage could be completed within a
single summer. "This is not going to
be another Kohlberg," said Walton.
The field, however, might take
slightly longer to recover. At worst,
they say the rugby teams would have
to be relocated for one season. The

Cornell with it.
This sitehas the advantage that it is
close to LP AC and the Lang Music
Building, which both frequently host
events attended by people from outside of Swarthmore. It does, however, have serious disadvantages.
First, and perhaps most importantly, it is an incursion on the Crum.
The design would be careful to minimize visual impact, including, for
example, a screen of trees surrounding the structure which could be transplanted from the area taken over by
the garage. As Lehmann pointed out,
"It would be no less visually appealing than the retaining wall."
The construction of a garage in this
location would necessitate the building ofan access road from Lang to the
site. Even so, there might be difficulties in getting the large sections of

pre-cast concrete to the site.
The administration has suggested
several alternate locations to the students. The most feasible would be a
earape located on the Cunnin"b?-n

location is unsuitable because it is
too far away from campus.
Both of their locations are ideally
situated for maximum convenience
to most of the academic buildings. A
Cunningham garage would be
underutilized, they say, because many
people would choose to park their
cars on the grass on campus. This site
would also raise the important issue
of the safety of pedestrians crossing
Route 320.
"Swarthmore," said Zimmer, "selects the most intelligent and independent students in the country, and
then takes away their independence
by denying them parking permits."
As long as Swatties remain independent, and as long as SEPTA remains expensive and inefficient, there
will always be a need for adequate
parking. By the end of next semester,
these four engineering majors may
have a solution.

A Crazy House & Some Strange Flirting
By Andy Murray
& Emily Shartin

This

weekend, National
Lampoon brings Swat
a taste of what everyone
knows it has long had a desperate
craving for: Greek life. Yes, Animal Houseâ€”that piece ofAmericana that has spawned such movie
masterpieces as PCU and the
highly respected Ski Schoolâ€”is
so likely to convince Swatties of
the benefits of having a wild frat
scene that I wouldn'tbe surprised
at all if waves of students began
withdrawing from the College the
next day.

By mentioning movies like Ski
School or Meatballs I, II or 111, I
am certainly not advocating that
people go out and try to see these
films. If you went through your
high school years without seeing
any of them, it is very likely that
there was a reason for it and you
probably wouldn't appreciate having to wade through all the soft
porn to get at their genius.
Butevervone should go see Animal House, both Kcause it was
the first ofits kind and because it
is also important to help us understand what American men fantasize about.
When parents are tired of the
lip they get from their children,
they often yell that they're sick of
thekidV'backtalk" or"sass." Parents who are really inventiveâ€”or
perhaps a little flustered â€”will
shoutthat they're sick and tired of
the kid's "back-sass." It's not a
word, but it's helpful to understanding Animal House as ayoung
boy's fantasy that to get ahead in
life and to get women to have sex
with you, you don't need to be
strong, athletic or intelligent. You
only need to have confidence and
a lotta lip. In fact, Animal House

takes it so far as to suggest that a man
can be a cocky slob, but if he's got a
big mouth he is guaranteed charisma.
There is only one person in recorded history that this has been
known to work for: John Belushi.
Luckily, Animal
House survives as

proof that the
dream can be a
reality. Captured
on film is Bluto
(Belushi), as he
shuffles down the
cafeteria snack
bar to a Sam
Cooke song.
Anyone watching the film has to
ask: is it any wonder that this guy
died before he was
40? But truly, underneath the slob
scarfing the Jello,
there is an undeniable animal magnetism.
Along the same lines, Otter (Tim
Mathcsufl) is irresistible to the coeds. His appeal is not found in snappy
outius or an athletic figure. And it
certainly isn't found in his respect for
women. All Otter has to do is make
humorous pretenses at being suave
and he'll always be on a roll.
If the theory behind Ski School was
that "to be the best, you must lose
your mind," the lesson in Animal
House is that you can let yourself go
and still be successful.
Animal House, after all, was the
movie that showedhow you could go
to college, smoke pot with your professors, make it with your dead
fiance's roommate, shoot a horse in
the Dean's office, have a toga party,
shoplift, kidnap your wife, and still
become a U.S. Senator.
Animal House shows Saturday
night in DuPont Lecture Hall at 7:30
and 10:00 p.m.

profile on Sharon Green, Administrative Assistant

Green Keeps Swat Athletics in Good Shape
By

Rachel Gutman

Sharon Green is truly thebackbone

of Swarthmore College Athletics. In
her role as administrative assistant,
she helps to organize the day-to-day
aspects of the College's sports program. Her responsibilities include
everything from answering the
phones to typing sports schedules,
rosters, contracts, requests for payment for sports officials, and anything else that comes across her desk.

She also arranges for transportation
to contests, purchases athletic equipment, and keeps track of the various
team coaches.
Green is native to the Swarthmore
area; she was raised in Wallingford,
Pennsylvania where she attended
what is now Strath Haven High
School. Though she never played
sports herself, she was involved in
school athletics as a cheerleader for a

long time.
After high school, Green worked
for The Franklin Mint for ten years,
after which she became administrative secretary for the Tyler arboretum. Green has been with athletic
administration at S warthmore exactly
one year, a position which she calls
"the perfect job."
At present, Green lives in
Boothwyn, Pennsylvania with her
husband Harry, a shift supervisor in
Philadelphia; her two children
Rebecca, 15andRachel, 14;and three
dogs, Snickers, Snuggles and Bear.
Taking after their mother, Green's
daughters are heavily involved with
sports at their high school, where
they play soccer, softball, field
hockey, basketball. They also play
for their township league of

Brandywine Youth Club.
In her spare time outside of work,
Sharon and her husband grow and

sell Christmas trees. Green is committed to attending all her daughters'
home games and even some away
matches. Green tries to support Swat
teams by attending games and cheering for the school.
Green is active in her Baptist
church, which she visits several times
each week and where she helps arrange special dinners and programs.
She also helps with Sunday school
instruction.
She belongs to the Brandywine
Youth Club, a township sports league
organization, and is involved with
her children's high school and its
parent/teacher organization. During
her lunch break, she likes to work out
in the Nautilus room or on the track.
When Green first came to Swarthmore, she had never had any experience with a college. But she found
Swat to be "aunique and warm place."
The other staff members in the Ath-

letics Department were "willing and
helpful" and the students were "nice
and pleasant."
Green finds her position at the
College rewarding and challenging.
"It's hard to make sure everything
gets done on time when there are ten
things that need doing all at once.
You must get your priorities straight
and keep on top of things. The days
go by very quickly and I often wonder where thehours go. I just try to go
with the flow. I'm still new at this job
and there is so much to learn." Green
wonders out loud, "Will I everknow
it all?"
Commenting on the pace of the
work, Green exclaims that it keeps
her very busy. "There is never a dull
moment! It is the hustle and bustle as
well as the people I work with that
make this jobrewarding. I enjoy coming to work; there is always something to do!"

This past Saturday the wrestling
started off its season with the
eighth annual Swarthmore Takedown
Tournament. After last year's unprecedented eight hours of take-down
action, this year's tournament proved
to run more smoothly and in less
time, still offering equal amounts of
fun and excitement for fans and wrestlers alike. In fact, one official admitted having come to the tournament
for the coffee alone, but decided to
stay after getting a taste of this year's
Swarthmore wrestling action.
S warthmore entered a small squad
of six wrestlers in this year's tournament, while the remaining team members proved to be vitally important in
pre-tournament training. Starting off
his college career at 118 was Nick
Attanasio 'OO. Nick proved to be a
holy terror on the mat as well as in
Sharpies Dining hall, but fell a little
short of the top place winners. Next
in line was '99 co-captain Adrian
Wilson wrestling at 134. Incited by
team

the presence of special fans, Wilson
battled his way through raging
Gloucester tyrants and "28 year-old
construction workers" to reclaim a
spot in the top three for the second
year in a row.
This opened the door for Aaron
Kobernick 'OO to follow suitand make
a name for himself in his debut at
142. Aaron also battled valiantly
throughout the day and left a lasting
impression in the minds of his competitors, despite ending the day a little
shy of the money round. Following
Kobernick was co-captain Scott
Timm '99 wrestling early in the season at 150. Timm reportedly ran into
some very large men who, upon making weight "honestly," managed to
stunt his overall tournament success
(although Timm gave a strong performance against an extremely tough
Conference opponent losingby a very
narrow margin). Later this season,
Timm expects to be doing the kind of
damage he's accustomed to at a
slightly lower weightclass.

A group of Swarthmore students
recently applied to the Athletics Department to have crew introduced as
an official sport of Swarthmore College. However, at the Student Council meeting last week, they were told
that their hopes, at least for the time
being, would not become reality.
According to Seth Garber '99,
Swarthmore has placed a cap on the
number of sports it will allow itself to
fund. Although Student Council
seemed to think crew to be a good
idea, it has already reached that cap,
and a crew team at Swat is as of yet
impossible because of this policy.
There are ideas about finding funding outside of the College, but that is
not an easy task, as crew is a very
expensive sport to maintain.The plan,
said Garber, is to begin by getting
chartered as an organization in Swat

rather than as a sport, making the
group legitimate for some College
funding, if not a grant to cover all

expenses.
It has been difficult to track down
alumni with an interest in crew. Advertisements were placed in the
alumni magazine and the group re-

mains hopeful.
What does the group plan to do
with funds if they get them?Thefirst
thing they need is a boat, but even
that might not be a realistic goal for
this year. "That's the worst thing that
can happen," said Garber, referring
to the possibility that crew might be
confined to dry land for their first
year. A rowing machine, called an
ergometer, or "erg," would be a less
expensive alternative, and it looks
like that might be the crew's fate for
awhile.
Of course, the group would like to
find a different answer than dry land
practicing. Interestingly enough, Bryn
Mawr is also in the process of forming a crew team, so there is talk of
sharing a boat with them. The team
has also applied to Villanova; many
crew teams rent their boats from there,
according to Garber.
A boat club in Philadelphia called
"Vesper" also invited the prospective crew team to come to a meeting
in the spring to discuss the possibility
ofrenting or buying a boathouse.

The group is confident that they
will be able to pull something together soon. After that happens, they
hope to practice at least once or twice
a week, just for the workout. The
group would also welcome any
bumbling novices who want to learn
how to row.
Dean NginaLythcott told the group
that a surprising number of prospective students chose not to come to
Swat simply because we lack a crew
team. In the future, they wantto show
the Athletics Department that this
organization is something that will
stick together over the years, in the
hope that the department might recognize it as a sport. If this happens,
the sport will start as a student interest sport, the mandatory first rung of
the ladder forany sport. In later years,
crew might be granted club level or
even varsity level recognition.

Season ends, but Team '97 is already looking to next year

Garnet Tide Saved Best For
Last, Still Not Good Enough
By

Alex Lundry

The Garnet Tide closed out their
season this past week in an exciting
fashion during one of their closest
games ofthe year, losing to the Washington & Lee Generals 31-21. While
thegame did haveits moments, nothing can make up for the poor season
which the 0-10 record Garnet experienced this year. The Tide cannot fail
to overlook the steady improvement
that it has shown as the season pro-

gressed, though. This improvement
was evident in the first three quarters
of this past week's game.
The first half proved to be a defensive battle between the Generals and
the Tide, with a low halftime score of
6-3 in favor of the Garnet as a result.
TheTide's defense kept the Generals
to only one field goal, while the offense was able to move the ball
steadily and score once on a one-yard
touchdown run by quarterback Pat
Straub '97.
As always, though, the Tide lost
their edge in the second half of the
contest. After the Tide allowed a
W&L touchdown, they bounced right
back with a touchdown pass of seven
yards from Straub to Mason Tootell

'99. This score, coupled with a successful two-point conversion, put the
Garnet up 13-10.
Yet this lead was extremely shortlived, as the Tide proceeded to allow
Washington & Lee to return the ensuing kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown
and the lead for the duration of the
game. During the remainder of the
last quarter, the Generals scored on
two more occasions. The Tide, meanwhile, was only able to muster one
more score in the closing minutes,
thanks again to the sure running of
Straub, who found the endzone from
34 yards out. The Tide found themselves 31-21 with time quickly running out on their season.
Despite the upsetting record for the
year, the Garnet found themselves
with a number of high points to look
back on. Talent was far from lacking
as the Tide placed four players on to
the All-Conference team: Kurk
Selverian '97, first-team defensive
lineman; Ben Hall '9B, second-team
offensive lineman; Tootell, secondteam wide receiver; and Straub, honorable mention quarterback. The only
low point, looking at the make-up of
next year's team, is the loss of so
many talented seniors.

Garnet sprinters swam hard against
an impressive field, with Arbour
claiming first in the 50 free. In the
exhibition heat of that event, Jamie
Flather' 00posted an impressive time
after having practiced for only one
week.
Coming off a sound victory in the
800 free-style, Jill Belding '99 won a
close race in the 200 butterfly. Herring scored big points for the men in
that same event. In the men's 200
back, Ross Dickson '9B and Keith
Earley '99 finished 1-2. The 400 free
proved to be an important race for the
men, withBrandon Walsh 'OO bouncing back from a disqualification in
the 200 fly to join Friedberg in victory In the second to last event of the
day, all Garnet breaststrokers performed well, notably Harvey, who
won for the women.
With the meet coming down to the
wire, both teams needed to win the
400 free relays in order to defeat the
hosts. The women's race was close
all the way, with Blair, Polinsky,
Robertson, and Unger neck-and-neck
with their opponents. Unfortunately,
NYU's final thrust proved to be too
much and the Garnet was barely
touched out. Although the men' s team
of Ryan Fruh '99, Earley, Robbins,
and Sanders raced hard, NYU had
saved enough of their fastest sprinters for the final relay to hold off the
Garnet.

&

After a two-and-a-half hour bus
ride through scenic New Jersey, the
men's and women's swim teams arrived in New York on Saturday for
what was an intense contest with talented host New York University and
visiting Vassar College. Both Garnet
teams defeated Vassar, while they
exchanged leads with NYU throughout the meet, only to come up five
points short. The final scores of 5045 understate the quality of both the
men's and women's performances.
While the home team was at an
apparent advantage having trained in
their 25-meter pool, Swarthmore did
not let the longer distance intimidate
them. Perhaps the extra motivation
of their a cappella-techno-cheer provided Swat with the added drive to
succeed. Both Garnet teams jumped
to early leads when the medley relays
raced to decisive victories. The
women's team of Kristen Robertson
'9B, Jenny Harvey '99, Cathy
Polinsky '99, and Claire Arbour 'OO
blew away the competition in the
final leg. On the men's side, the quad
of Andy Robbins '9B, Fred Gerson
'99, Justin Herring' 97, and Carl Sanders '9B breezed to an easy victory.
The individual events began in fine
form when MarkFriedberg '9B scored
an impressive come-from-behindvictory in the 800 free-style. Liz Blair
'OO also performed well in her first
ever attempt at the long distance event.
In the 200 free, Molly Marino '9B and

University.

This year's senior group provided
the core of leadership that went beyond the team's expectations. Defensive back Brian Baird '99 said,
"The seniors this year faced such a
tough time having to lead a winless
team, but they still managed to keep
everybody up and into [the game].
They couldn't have done a better
job."
So now, with the season over, the
Tide of 1997 have already begun their
planning. For the majority of next
year's team, theiroff-season training
has already begun. This is the perfect
example of the dedication which this
Swarthmore team has had throughout this rough season. Now the only
hope is that next year all their hard
work will truly pay off.

Gearing for Rose City Classic
By

Jean Quinn

Last week the Garnet took on
Albright in their final preparatory
scrimmage before the real women's
basketball season begins today. To
open the competitive portion of the
season, the team travels to Drew
University for an overnight trip to
participate in the Rose City Classic.
St. Elizabeth's and host Drew will be
the Garnet's first opponents.
Against Albright, Swarthmore put
forth a strong effort. The format of
the scrimmage consisted of two
twenty-minute halves, followed by
an extra ten-minute period. Albright
led by ten points at the break, but
managed to extend their lead in the
second half so thatthe final score was
73-38. The Garnet regrouped and tied
Albright, eight points apiece, in the
final period.
Head coachAdrienne Shibles said,
"The team looked much better at the
Albright scrimmage than they did at
the Widener scrimmage.Albright was
a very athletic team with a lot of
depth. I thought that, with the exception of the second period when I was
trying out different combinations, we

played them extremely tough." Rebounding was one important area
where the Garnet showedmarked improvement, no doubt as a result of
special practice drills that emphasize
boxing out. "Albright was a much
more physical team than Widener,
and we managed to do a great job
controlling the offensive and defensive boards," said Shibles.
Co-captainLisl Cochran-Bond '97
returned to the court after a year
abroad and led all scorers with 17
points. She shot seven of eight from
the foul line and has emerged as a
"go-to"playerforthe Garnet, Shibles
believed. She is great at drawing the
foul and is deadly from the freethrow line. Cochran-Bond diagnosed

Equinox Is the First Step

Yearafter year, there is a preseason
poll of Centennial Conference
coaches and sports information directors to attempt to predict the outcome of each of the two divisions of
the men's basketball league.
This year Swarthmore is predicted
to finish fourth out of five teams in
the East Division despite having six
of its top seven scorers returning.
Judging by the team's performance
in its two scrimmages, the league is in
for a surprise.
The team's starting five is expected
to includefour seniors, three ofwhom,
co-captain Ben Schall '97, co-captain Colin Convey '97, and Aaron
Bond '97, have been starters or key
substitutes since their sophomore
year.
Schall was conspicuously left off
of last year's all-conference teams

despite finishing ninth in the conference in scoring (15.8 ppg) and second in rebounding (8.5 rpg).
As point guard, Convey (11.0 ppg,
2.7 apg) will direct the offense. He
and fellow backcourt mate Tim
Schofield '99 (6.9 ppg) should turn
heads this year.
In the two scrimmages this fall,
Schofield has shown that he has de-

veloped a more mature court sense,
making him an even more potent
weapon. They each have the ability
to penetrate a defense on dribble or
sink a three-pointer.
Swarthmore took 123 more threepoint attempts than their opponents
last season. The Garnet connected on
36 percent of them, while its opponents made only 31 percent of their
attempts.
All of the Garnet's top three-point
threats are returning. Convey was

Jen Philpott, co-captain of the women's rugby team, had a spectacular
and consistent season this fall. She is a key and invaluable player on the
team, a leader on and off the field. She turned in a great performance in
the last game of the fall season against traditional rival Bryn Mawr. She
scored one of the team's tries in the second half, which added to the team's
20-0 victory over the Mawrters.
Overall, Philpott is a great rugger and a very supportive team player.
As scrum half, she has the opportunity to lead the team on the field, a job
she does admirably. I would not want to be on the field without her," said
teammate Andrea Barnett '97. Her tenacity inspires her fellow teammates
to better performances, despite the team's dismal record this fall. With
Philpott at the helm, the women ruggers can look forward to a better and
more consistent season this spring.

and Tean Ouinn '99, who scored eight
and seven pointsrespectively. Shibles
commended Houseal's showing as a
strong inside force and Quinn's consistency on both ends of the court and
emergence as one of the more aggressive defensive players on the team.
Eight players on the team scored in
all. "The Albright scrimmage proved
that we need to be more patient and
disciplined offensively. Oftentimes,
we went for the first look inside instead of working through the offense
and looking for a better shot," commented Shibles.
The team had a week to prepare for
their first game, but injuries and illness have plagued the Garnet.
Michelle Walsh '9B suffered a displaced nasal fracture and will have to
wear a guard to protect her face for a
while. Quinn also broke her nose but
fortunately it was not displaced.
Jammed fingers and the flu have impaired the play of many members of
the team as well. The outlook remains positive on all ends, though.
Erin Greeson '99 said, "I feel that the

Pat Straub, the starting quarterback and co-captain of the Garnet Tide,
played his last collegiate game this past Saturday against Washington &
Lee. Straub has been the backbone of the Tide offense for the last four
years. He collected a total of 4,670 passing yards, which places him in
second place of Swarthmore's all-time passing yardage record and ninth
in the Centennial Conferencerecord. Straub's performance in the quarterback position garnered him. the sixth berth in the all-time Centennial
Conference passing list.
In addition to his spectacular offensive plays, Straub lso played defense
in the Tide's last three games. Alex Lundry '99 said, "Pat is someone who
can be put in any situation and perform spectacularly, regardless of the
circumstances." Straub rounded off his season and collegiate career as an
honorable mention quarterback in the Conference.
