Due to allergy worries, beloved campus dogs, including Dobby, George and AN, are no longer allowed in buildings on campus, though
their presence is still welcome outdoors.
BY AARON KRAMER
akramer2@swarthmore.edu

Recently, many dog owners on campus
have been told that their pets will no
longer be allowed inside campus buildings. There have been talks of barring
this privilege universally.
A handful of faculty, administrative
staff and others have brought their dogs
to their work for years, and some of the
dogs are frequently seen around campus
and in buildings such as the Kohlberg
Coffee Bar and Parrish.
A few students and campus employees
have complained
about some of
Swarthmore's big-ticket dogs, like
George, Ali and Dobby, citing fear of dogs
and allergies.
Steve Levin, who has been working in
Swarthmore's bookstore for about 15
years, has been bringing his dogs to work
for the past 6 years.

According to Levin, barring the bookstore dogs from the bookstore will be
removing two beloved campus icons.
"Visitors, students and staff go
through the bookstore, and they always
see the dogs. They have become very
familiar to people," Levin said. "Today, a
lot of people ask about the dogs, because
they don't see them anymore. A lot of
alumni and parents of students love to see
the dogs and ask about them. It's a shame
that there is a possibility that
[Swarthmore] might do away with that."
Some of the complaints come from

Environmental Services (E VS) citing that
dog hair clogs their vacuums, and that
some of the staff are allergic to dogs.
According to Steve Levin, he understands and accepts these complaints, but
doesn't believe this warrants a ban on
dogs in academic buildings.
Professor Bob Paley ofthe Department
of Chemistry does not support the ban
either.

"Progressive companies such as
Google and Amazon, to name two of
many, allow dogs in the workplace, and
find they have a positive impact on
employees and productivity," Paley said.

Several studies have indeed shown
that proximity to pets is linked with happiness and health.
"I would like to think that we, as a progressive college, can do the same," Paley
said. "Yes, there are people who have
allergies, and yes, there are people who
are afraid of dogs. Somehow the aforementioned companies manage to deal
with these issues
the positives far outweigh the negatives. Dogs, and pets in
general, enhance our lives."
According to Levin, the College should
focus on trying to accommodate everybody.
"I think the bookstore has done an
excellent job at accommodating folks who
have any sort of problems with the dogs,"

Levin said.
Jake Neely 'l3, a dog lover, sees no
point to the ban. "My initial reaction was
that barring dogs from campus buildings

April 21, 2011

was a very bad thing. I like seeing the
dogs, I love the dogs. One of the things I
like about this school is our relationship
with the animals on campus."
According to Neely, the best policy
would entail students and employees handling their concerns individually.
"If you are afraid of dogs or have an
allergy, why can't you just ask the owner
to put the dog away?" Neely said. "I think
that students with dog allergies is a legitimate concern, but I think there are ways
around it without destroying something
most students faculty on this campus

enjoy."
In the past, if someone was allergic or
afraid of dogs, they would inform the
bookstore staff, who would promptly put
the dogs in Levin's office. "There was
never a problem," Levin said.
Likewise, if a student who feared dogs
needed an appointment with Professor
Paley, they would simply meet in a dogfree location. "[lt was] a really simple
solution," Paley said.
Both Paley and Levin believe that
holding dog owners responsible for cleaning up after their pets is a sufficient way
of ensuring that people who are allergic
to dogs stay healthy.
"It works for companies," Paley said,

in the White House

over many,
it can work here."
According to Levin, many students
will be losing something valuable. "For
the students," Levin said, "it's a touch of
home."

WNR funding guaranteed for another year

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY PATRICK AMMERMAN
pammerml@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's War News Radio
is guaranteed funding
through next year, but those
involved are already beginning to
discuss what road the program can
take in the future. Lang Center
Director Joy Charlton calls this a
"moment of planning" for the
organization. "I am truly optimistic
that ways will be found to help it
move forward," Charlton said.
Originally, WNR was created in
2005 as a response to the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a media
outlet through which students can
research and report on issues that
are global in scope, in contrast to
The Phoenix and The Daily Gazette
that focus mostly on campus news.
"War News Radio is an important independent media organization that keeps an eye on conflicts
in a time when the traditional
media
is
Jim
contracting,"
MacMillan, WNR's journalist-inresidence said.
Since the beginning, WNR has
mostly been funded by the
President's Office, said WNR
reporter Jared Nolan 'l2. The
organization was originally a "pet
project" of former Swarthmore
President Alfred H. Bloom, and
received funding to hire a full time
journalist-in-residence to oversee
the project.
Last year, funding was renewed
by President Rebecca Chopp, but in
a reduced form. "Last year we had
to make significant budget reallocations across the college and WNR,
like many other programs, had to
share the sacrifice," Chppp said.
It was expected that War News
Radio would eventually be removed
from the budget of the President's
fund.
"The
discretionary
President's Office funds soft money
projects or one time events, and at
some point they are either moved
onto the budget or fundraising is
successful and they get an endowment," Chopp said.
The President's Office usually
provides funding to an organization
for up to three years, but the success of WNR, coupled with the difficulty of finding funds in the midst
of the economic downturn, has led
Chopp to grant diminished funds
for another two years.
This reduction in funding meant
that WNR could no longer hire a
full time journalist-in-residence.
Macmillan, the group's new journalist-in-residence is employed part
time and comes to campus two days
a week; while previously, the group
had a journalist on hand five days a
week.
The journalist-in-residence has a
variety of responsibilities within
the club in addition to assisting all
members with their stories.

working is so
important to War News Radio,"
Alan Zhao 'l2, member of the WNR
staff, said. In response to last year's
cuts, Zhao found that the "quality of
our work has definitely suffered by
a small margin because you don't
have that journalist [always] there
to look at your scripts."
Losing funding from the president's office next year has members
of WNR contemplating the group's
future. Nolan and Zhao worry that
sources of funding on campus such
as the Student Budget Committee
(SBC) could not finance bringing in
a journalist-in-residence at all,
which may jeopardize the legitimacy of the group's reports.
"Radio is
a different beast
when it comes to journalism, and
requires more guidance," Zhao
said. Zhao also fears that the club's
egalitarian framework may be
impossible to maintain without a
journalist-in-residence figure.
"The journalist-in-residence sort
of allows for [egalitarianism] ... but
without him a student or students
would have to step up into his role,"
he said.
Another issue in finding funding
is that War News Radio does not fit
into any existing establishment
within the school. It is affiliated
with the Lang Center, but the program does not fit in with any of the
school's major departments and is
too large to be funded by the SBC.
According to staff members,
that's precisely what makes WNR
stand out from other organizations
on campus. "It's such a unique
it gives you
learning opportunity
skills that you don't really learn
otherwise in a liberal arts college,"
Nolan said.
While staying updated on current events, reporters have the
opportunity to reach out to people
in all walks oflife around the world
and gain valuable skills in the
process.
"[The reporters] learn so much
about politics, and history, and economics, and public policy
about
how to communicate, how to interview people, how to have the confidence to make phone calls,"
Charlton said.
...

Currently,

strategic

planning

meetings have begun to take place
between WNR members, Macmillan
and Lang Center staff.
"I think it's premature to imagine solutions, but I'm aware that

our supporters are investigating,
and a year seems like a good
amount of time [to find a source of
funding]," MacMillan said.
He and others foresee WNR continuing on into the future.
"Given the recognition of what
War News Radio continues to
accomplish, I am truly optimistic
that ways will be found to help it
move forward," Charlton said.

NEWS IN BRIEF

Students commemorate oil spill with symbolic ink-stained hands
On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater
Horizon oil rig, owned by British
Petroleum (BP), exploded in the Gulf of

Mexico. The spill, which dumped around
4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into the Gulf,

a massive economic downturn along the
Gulf Coast. Yesterday marked the one

Olde Club ends year with electro-pop and rock 'n' roll
BY HENRY KIETZMAN
hkietzml@swarthmore.edu

Olde Club will sign off with its last
show of the spring season this Friday
with performances from Hunx and His
Punx, Shannon and the Clams, and
Swarthmore's own Ben Starr 'll as
Lexi Starr. The dancing will continue
with a DJ set by Physical Therapy to
finish off the night.
In 2008, Seth Bogart (aka Hunx) created Hunx and His Punx after he fronted the electro-pop group Gravy
Train!!!! Based in Oakland, California,
the band describes their sound on
their website as '"Young Oldies,' a
mixture of 'sos teenage rock 'n' roll,
'6os girl groups and bubblegum pop."
Hunx and His Punx had its first
national tour alongside Jay Reatard
and Nobunny in 2009 and released
their first album with recording label
Hardly Art, "Too Young To Be In
Love," in early 201 L The band's performance this weekend is part of the
headlining tour for "Too Young To Be
In Love." Other members of the band
include Shannon Shaw, Erin Emslie,
Michelle
Amy
Blaustein
and
Santamaria.
Blaine O'Neill 'IL the Olde Club
Booking Director, is responsible for
bringing Hunx and His Punx to campus. After hearing about the "Too
Young To Be In Love" tour, O'Neill emailed their agent. "I thought it would
be a really good last Olde Club show of
the spring season," O'Neill said.
Shaw provides the vocals for
Shannon and the Clams, a band selfdescribed as a combination of Garage,
Pop, Rock, also based in Oakland. On
their website, the band claims a variety of influences, from The Shangri-las
to Black Sabbath to Elvis. Shannon
and the Clams' sophomore album,
"Sleep Talk," was released in early
April as part of a dual album release
party with Hunx and His Punx' "Too
Young To Be In Love."
Bogart is excited about the show
and is happy that Swarthmore
"worked into [his] schedule." He lists
The Chipmunks and '6os girl group
The Ronettes among his musical influences. The artist describes his set as
unpredictable and calls it "a gamble,
some nights are crazier than others."
During his performances, Bogart
tries to maintain a very open and

should just be [comfortable with] who
they are no matter what," Bogart said.
"We'll have live animals, stunt doubles, fireworks and explosions, so it's
going to be a night to remember,"
Bogart said, jokingly, about his anticipation of a rousing show.
Tayler Tucker 'l3, an ardent fan of
Hunx and His Punx, talked excitedly
of the upcoming performance. "A couple of my friends and I were really into
Hunx and His Punx our senior year in
high school so it's really exciting to
have something like that here,"
Tucker said.
She enjoys Hunx and His Punx's
"gender bending [and] sexuality-bending farce craziness" that accompanies
their performance. Tucker believes
that the band is going to push

space."

Tucker thinks that this performance will allow students to feel completely comfortable to push boundaries and explore their sexualities,
even more so than Genderfuck.
Tucker is especially excited about
Starr's performance who will perform
in drag and open for Hunx and His
Punx. After seeing him in drag before
and watching a couple of his performance videos, Tucker believes that
Starr "is a great fit." She's excited
about the collaboration, remembering
last year's Martha Graham Cracker
performance. Cracker, the drag alter
ego of Dito Van Reigersberg '94
founder of Pig Iron Theatre Company
was one of Olde Club's best attended nights of last year.
At the beginning of the year, Starr
was asked by O'Neill to perform at an
Olde Club show. "It's really exciting to
be able to open for a real band," Starr
said. Starr will perform covers with
his band. He'll be covering Katy Perry,
Alicia Keys, Queen, Carrie Underwood
and Etta James, among others. Starr
quotes several musical influences,
including his love of jazz.
"I picked songs that I really love.
All of the songs that I'm playing are by
artists that have inspired me in some
way or another," Starr said. He cites
specifically Bjork, who "inspires [him]

Starr said. It's Starr's first time opening for a band, and his first time performing as Lexi Starr. "It's going to be
awesome, and a really good time,"
Starr said. O'Neill agreed, adding,
"Swatties should expect an energetic,

to let loose."

Forget Buy&Hold: focus on the long-term direction
&

In continuing in the
vein ofhow to grow your
money, let's explore the
two forms of investment
opportunities that will
be available to most of
us: "Buy&Hold," and the
active "Market Timing"
approach. Buy&Hold is a
passive
investment
strategy in which an
investor buys stocks and
Aliya Padamsee
holds them for a long
period of time, regardMoney Matters
less of fluctuations in
the market. The conventional Wall Street consensus is that Buy&Hold is the only prudent investment approach because short-term market movements have always been difficult, if not impossible,
to predict. Focus on the long-term direction, which
has been decidedly upward over time. In a "bear"
market, as the market dips, your automatic monthly inflows buy cheaper and cheaper values of the
stock/mutual fund that you are invested in. When
the market rebounds, you will ride the appreciation
of price while you now average in at higher prices.
Over time, the buys all average out, and you will
ride the market appreciation and will have a secure
retirement. On the other hand, the Market Timing
approach is a more active strategy of making buy or
sell decisions of financial assets with an outlook of
market or economic conditions resulting from technical or fundamental analysis.
It is true that the equity markets have a bullish
bias, but let's look deeper, and let's dissect the facts.
(Of course we are going to ignore the fact that
money managers get two percent of "assets under

"There's something real and scary

why she prefers the "Stab" films to the

Spring poetry festival to feature folklore, OASIS
BY SERA JEONG
sjeongL@swarthmore.edu
In commemoration of Dr. Kathryn Morgan, the Sara
of History, the
College will host the third annual Kathryn Morgan Spring
Poetry Festival. Scheduled for this Friday at 5 p.m. in the
Scheuer Room, the event, titled "Memory, Love and Social
Justice," coincides with National Poetry Month. Members
of the student spoken word group, Our Art Spoken In Soul
(OASIS) and local spoken-word duo Nagohead will present
poetry.
Professor Morgan, who passed away in 2009, was a poet,
folklorist and the first African American female professor
with tenure at Swarthmore College. Born and raised in
Philadelphia, she obtained a M.A. from Howard University
and a M.A. and Ph.D from the University of Pennsylvania.
In addition, according to the Folklore Project website,
Morgan became the first folklorist to write AfricanAmerican family folklore when she published "Children of
Lawrence-Lightfoot Professor Emerita

Strangers."

Professor of history Allison Dorsey organized the event
during her time as coordinator of the black studies program
in 2009. Three objectives motivated Dorsey in creating the
event. "The first goal was [to] raise the profile of one of the
oldest interdisciplinary programs at Swarthmore College.
The second was to help students understand the depth and
width of the field of black studies beyond the confines of
Swarthmore College, and," Dorsey said, "the third was to
make connections with faculty on campus whose work
dovetailed or might be linked with black studies." For
Dorsey, it seemed natural to host a poetry event, which she
believes is 'artistic, intellectually stimulating and uplifting."
Dorsey designed the poetry festival to encompass the
works of both professional and student poets and spoken
word artists, all of whose work embodies a sense of strong
social consciousness, which echoes this year's theme.
Friday's performance will feature professional spoken word
artists Nagohead, a spoken word duo whose Philadelphia
origins compliment Dorsey's focus on local artists. "I wanted students who have expressed a love for and interest in
poetry/spoken word to realize that Philadelphia has a
vibrant and dynamic poetry scene," she said.
Associate professor of sociology Sarah Willie-Leßreton,
also involved in the organization of the poetry event, invited Nagohead, a husband and wife duo, Paul Wright and
Debra Powell-Wright, to perform on campus following the
recommendations of Lorene Cary, founder and executive
director of Art Sanctuary, a black arts organization in
Philadelphia and Swarthmore College student activities'
coordinator Paury Flowers. "They were ultimately selected
because Debra and Paul Wright seem to embody the social
justice, loving spirit and multi-disciplinarity [sic] that also
described Dr. Kathryn Morgan," Willie-Leßreton said.
Originally from London, Wright is a professor of English

at the Community College of Philadelphia. "Since becoming
an English professor, Paul's writing has become a love for
words and how they come together to make meaning, no
matter the subject," Powell-Wright said. Powell-Wright is a
member of local four-female spoken word ensemble In the
Company of Poets and believes the experience impacted her
greatly. "Being invited to join the In The Company of Poets
ensemble gave me the courage to use words as a means to
inspire others as well as to purge about personal, community, and societal issues," Powell-Wright said in an email

interview.

"We feel that these works are appropriate to Dr. Kathryn
Morgan's legacy as a folklorist, a cultural activist, a woman
of color and a person who navigated the waters of injustice
when necessary," Powell-Wright wrote in an e-mail. "As we
read Dr. Morgan's bio, it is a particular honor to perform for

this festival," she said.
The event is an opportunity not only to showcase the talent of student artists, but also to develop students' art along-

side professionals.

Dorsey believes this reflects the relationship Morgan
had with students. "A proud, beautiful, committed and
much beloved black teacher, [Morgan] was devoted to help-

ing her students master new skills and develop strategies to
achieve success," Dorsey said.
Student and OASIS member Heydil Henriquez 14 will
also perform at the event. "I write spoken word poetry
because it's a way to speak on social injustices and simply
voice what's often forbidden and forgotten," she said.
Communities within the college have felt Morgan's
absence. "I think black studies and the Black Cultural
Center have lost an advocate and a champion and one of few
people who possess vital institutional memory about the
black experience here at Swarthmore," Dorsey said.
Initially the college denied Morgan, the first African
American professor to teach at Swarthmore College, tenure.
Eventually, she led a career at Swarthmore College spanning 25 years, and in 1991, the college's Black Alumni
Association honored her for contribution to the African
American community at the college.

members, NAFSA is the world's largest nonprofit professional association dedicated to international education.
Hamilton's department is small only a staffof six
but the work they do is significant. Since her start,
| Hamiltonhas launched an e-learning program in addition
to managing webinars, or online seminars, and organizing training events and workshops. With the help of over
300 member volunteers, the team produces and delivers
all of these professional development offerings under the
guidance ofHamilton's department.

Swarthmore's influence:
Looking back, Hamilton does not feel Swarthmore succeeded in preparing students for the post-Swarthmore
world, unless it involved graduate school. However, she is
glad that the college's current externship program, for
which she has mentored, exists "to provide student with
experience during college." Hamilton believes particular
skills from her college days have proven quite useful.
"The ability to write well has certainly served me in any
kind of professional capacity I've had, [in addition to]
thinking about things from lots of different angles, and
managing lots of projects at the same time," she said.
Along with participating as a mentor in the externship
program, Hamilton participates in a Swarthmore book ]
club in D.C., which will often follow the curriculum for a ]
course currently being offered at Swarthmore. The pro- j
fessor of the course provides discussion questions, and 1
often joins the group at the beginning and end of the year \
to lecture on the class theme. Noting the caliber of con- j
versation, Hamilton said, "The level of conversation and j
discussion is just coming from a different perspective and 1
is at a different level."
Words of advice:
For students not looking towards a career in academia, Hamilton suggests "getting experience outside of the
college that's a little more practical." To do this,, she \
believes students should pursue an internship over the ]
summer, use the extern program and utilize career serv- j
ices before graduation.
Also, for students trying to figure out their futures,
Hamilton advises just focusing on what they enjoy and j
what they are good at. She hopes that young people
who often appear preoccupied with over-planning their
lives know that "wherever you work first, it's not for- \
ever. It doesn't have to be the perfect choice."

This collaboration between Funari
and the women in the film permeated
the entire project. In Tijuana, an organization entitled Factor X had organized
women in the area for social and environmental advocacy. Both Funari and
De La Torre raised money for the organization to provide workshops in filmmaking, particularly in video narration
and editing.
All of the writing for the script, shooting and production were done in collaboration with the female factory workers.
"These particular factory workers were

Carmen. Lourdes, whose family lives
near the toxic waste of a corporation
that failed to clean up their mess, advocates for environmental responsibility

Path to her career choice:
"When I graduated from Swarthmore, I really had no
clue what my career path was going to be," Hamilton
said. Originally, she hoped to be a professor of history, but
considered it as a sign when, working in library archives
on her thesis, she found out thatshe had severe dust allergies. Shifting her focus to other possibilities, Hamilton
began working at a small publishing company where she
operated as a publicist, mostly for authors who wrote selfhelp books. However, Hamiltondid not feel thather heart
was in the work. "I realized that I didn't want to pursue a
simple career in public relations where you have to advocate for any author that pays the bill," she said.
In 1995, after partaking in various jobs, she moved to a
member coalition of Human Needs called Women Work!
The National Network for Women's Employment. In the
group, she aided single mothers and women trying to
transitionback into the workforce by providing training,
doing policy work and supporting publications and other
projects. She worked briefly at the Grantmakers for
Children, Youth and Families before getting a job at
AACTE, the American Association of Colleges for
Teacher Education, "where [she] was able to finally move

Rewards and challenges ofher work:
For Hamilton, the creative partnership between volunteers and staff is rewarding. "We're lucky in that we
get to do a lot ofcreative work even though we're behind
the scenes," she said. "When We're working with volunteers to create the curriculum, we're bringing expertise
and design training for adults, and what they're bringing
is content expertise around a particular subject area
That partnership is really exciting." She enjoys working
on webinars her department produces, which aid in
explaining, for example, new regulation that international student advisers at colleges have to be aware of, or

trends in international student recruitment.
In addition, Hamilton has learned a great deal about
things she never anticipated such as regulations for student visas or how international students manage their
taxes. However, she laments that she is often removed
from the actual results ofher work. "You can see the big
picture, but it also sometimes seems removed from the
issues you were trying to influence," she said.
Ultimately, however, Hamilton believes that NAFSA's
mission to educate professionals has made a visible
impact Hamilton explained that the people who ultimately get training through the work NAFTA supports in

Television produces masterpieces of our time
When I first interviewed to write for The

wanted to write about

I explained to lan

who, at the time, was in
film school, had just
made some snarky comment to me about how
television was film's
"bastard child," and I felt that I had to defend my
medium to the general public, that I must convince
people that television had the same potential for
artistic greatness as film, literature and music. In
short, I made it my mission to show my readers what
they were missing by dismissing television in such

Pencils Down,

■

terms.

I

Flash forward three and a half years, and television is finally getting some respect. Shows like "Mad
Men," "Fringe" and "30 Rock" are regularly praised
by critics, and many actors' career trajectories now
move them from film to television, rather than the
other way around. That very same friend who had
brushed off my arguments as to the greatness of television spent her last two years of film school working on the sets of "Nip/Tuck" and "24."
At this point in time, I doubt that any cultural
critic would question the audacious, breathtaking
storytelling that characterized television masterpieces like "The Sopranos" and "The Wire," or deny
the influence that "The Simpsons" has had on popular culture.
In this column, my last as a writer for The
Phoenix (don't worry, I'll still be writing about TV at
www.pencilsdownpasstheremote.blogspot.com, and
you can join the lovely and talented Emilia Thurber
as a follower!), I want to go even further with my
defense of television. You see, I don't just think that
television is the equal of the other art forms that I
mentioned earlier; I think that, in recent years, the
best shows on TV have surpassed cinema, literature
and music.
They have not necessarily been surpassed in
objective quality (although artistic merit is hardly
objective), but in cultural influence. To me, the artistic masterpieces that define our time are the fourth
season of "The Wire," the first season of "Lost," the
paintball episode of "Community" and the infamous
gorge jump from "The Simpsons." These, and many
others, are our cultural legacy.
Don't worry, I can already hear the English and
film and media studies (not to mention art history)
majors furiously typing counter-examples to refute
my claim. But give me a moment to defend myself.
Think about it this way; in the last few years, have
you read a new book or seen a new movie that you
think defines your generation or your time?
I know that no film or book I've encountered during my time at Swarthmore has spoken to me the
way that the fourth season of"The Wire" did (a major
exception being Karl Marlantes' crippling, masterful
novel "Matterhorn," which, though an absolute masterpiece, defines a generation older than ours). And I
don't think that any book or film, no matter how
clever or incisive, has sent up current culture with
the same satirical wit as "30 Rock." I strongly suspect
that, if Jonathan Swift were alive today, he would be
working with Tina Fey.
For those who take issue with my mention of the
awesome "Community" paintball episode, I'll say
that many great films and works of literature are
genre pastiches. Quentin Tarantino is probably the
first filmmaker who comes to mind when discussing
the re-appropriation of genre elements, but Jean-Luc
Godard's "Breathless," a film that helped revolution-

ize cinema in both France and the United States, is in Dostoevsky and Dickens, Sinclair and Hugo, writers

Anniversary of oil spill should be a time for activism
Yesterday marked the one year anniversary of the
British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The
Deepwater Horizon explosion killed 11 men and dumped
approximately 4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into the Gulf
waters.
Throughout the summer months in 2010, live coverage
of the oil spill dominated every news outlet. CNN and the
Huffington Post offered the oil spill's live camera, which
showed the millions of gallons of oil gushing into the

Wagner, Marable
Ryan budget plan a viable
remind us of politics of option for fiscal solvency
history vs. memory
P
April

Dr. Manning Marable, one of the greatest historians of our time, passed away this month.
The influential Columbia professor, known for
authoring "How Capitalism Underdeveloped
Black America and Living Black History," was
days short of releasing the much anticipated,
"Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention." In a 2006
interview with talk show host Tavis Smiley,
Marable expressed his frustration with what he
argued was the reduction of Malcolm's life.
Marable believed the icon's incomplete political
legacy was attributed in part to the "gentrification of black history."

nities or outright urban removal. However,
Marable claimed that as history, linked to artifacts and ideas, become valuable and marketable, authentic stories get lost in the process. Consequently, entire
scholarships have emerged solely based on reclaiming and reinterpreting
conventional historical narratives.
This month I had the opportunity to sit down with Dr. Hudlin Wagner,
the Vice President for Student Development & Dean of Students at
Carleton College, prior to her public lecture on campus. In addition to her
administrative duties, Wagner co-teaches a course every few years called
"History & Memory" with an emphasis on the transatlantic slave trade.
At the end of the course, she takes a group of students to Ghana on a
research and fact-finding trip. "I've always been fascinated with the concept of history versus memory," she explained.
As Wagner outlined, many people spend their lives grappling with the
realities of a fractured identity. As a Native American, Jamaican and
black woman, she acknowledged that it has been her life long mission to
maintain her own sense of personal history, yet the greatest challenge in
preserving and retelling these accounts is the trivialization of oral tradition. "The Native telling of history has been an oral history but European
values are so locked into [mainstream] language that when individuals
talk about history, they are talking about a written text. Oral reports are
described as myths and legends," Wagner said.
Essentially Wagner maintained that if we fail to continually ask ourselves, "Whose truth is it?" we will never work towards solving the historical puzzle. If we all invest in truly engaging the process of preservation, retelling and reclaiming, it is then we can understand how historical memory is constructed.
When Wagner was a little girl, she attended a Catholic school targeted
for Native Americans and people of color in her community. Her parents
never realized that her mere presence at the institution would contribute
to an erasure of her own history as she was challenged with some indoctrination of Catholic ideology.
Nevertheless, Wagner has always maintained a sense of cultural pride
and a dedication to telling the stories of Native American women. While
popular books and films, though constructions of individuals like
Sacagawea and Pocahontas, have provided a seeming platform to
acknowledge Native existence, it has done little to broaden the education
of its contemporary audience. One of the most intriguing obscured components were the expressions of gender roles and sexuality.
"Two-Spirit" people, Wagner recalled, were individuals she described
as having both male and female partners and not necessarily aligning
themselves with a particular gender. According to Wagner, it was not
unusual for women or men to "share two spiritualities."
While Western women have long battled for equality and an expansion
of their roles in society, Wagner suggests Native American women were
respected for their self-reliance. Strong women, who understood economic stability and trade, especially among the Huron women, were highly
valued.
As Wagner recalled these forgotten women who occupied society in a
way that challenged the Western gender binary, they seemed to be a
tremendous source of inspiration in her own life.
Like Wagner, Manning Marable was deeply concerned with the realm
of reconstruction. However, his attempt to retell Malcolm's history will
undoubtedly make people angry. "Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention" is
already being described as a sharp departure from the usual heroic analysis. Professor Marable is being remembered as a man who engaged intellectual debate with a measure of civility and integrity. Students and academics all over the world are rightfully mourning his loss.
Nevertheless, one must wonder if Marable's own story one day might
experience its own .reinterpretation and if an unbiased and reportedly
true history is even attainable.

Democrats have a plan and Ryan doesn't."
Unfortunately, the progressive plan is wedded to a healthcare law whose unpopularity, cost and confusion climb each day. Not
to be outdone, President Obama's budget
address last week lambasted the usual culprits: Paul Ryan, George W Bush, and those
pesky "Millionairesand Billionaires."
My gripe is not so much with the Dems'
fancy political footwork as it is with the
reality that the Obama budget is a house of
uncoated cards. The "$1 trillion in new tax
breaks for the wealthy" the President referenced is disingenuous. The tax skirmish
back in the fall concerned whether or not to
extend theBush-era rates, certainly not any
newfound windfalls.
Even a hefty tax hike on the wealthy (by
whom the IRS means anyone household
earning more than $250,000, regardless of
the Daddy Warbucks rhetoric on Capitol
Hill) would cause no sizable dent in the
debt. There simply are not enough rich people to go around, and any comparison to the
Clinton tax-rates is erroneous since our fiscal situation is far stormier than it was in
the 19905.
In order to address the real budget blitz,
our nation would need to shoulder a massive tax increase on the middle class, from
whom most of our revenue is drawn. I am
by no means in favor of this, and neither is

ment reform is the "third-rail" in politics.
Essentially, Americans come to rely on

their government programs, and intervention is akin to the prognosis for poking a
high voltage wire: not a long political lifetime. Paul Ryan, it seems, nary a care, has
hurled himself in front of a SEPTA car.
Tackling Medicare, Paul Ryan proposes
funding at a certain level for individuals
over 55, who have worked their lives with
the expectation of government aid in retirement. For the rest of us, there would be a
looser set of private health-plans, with the
government picking up some of the premi
um tab.
In a world without Medicare, the gov
ernment would relieve itself from the
unworkable central-planning that went into
dictating medical prices; Uncle Sam could
take a holiday from strong-arming
providers into performing procedures thai
don't result in positive patient outcomes.
The soundbite backlash against House
Republicans has been that Representative
Ryan is callously capping healthcare costs
for seniors. What pundits fail to mention is
that it was Obamacare which initially
sought to cap the general girth of Medicare
spending. Launching in 2015, Obamacare
inserts an upper limit on annual Medicare

spending growth.
By 2018, Obama's landmark legislation
will be set one point above per capita-GDP
growth. This guarded growth rate will be
enforced by a 15-member technocratic
group titled The Independent Payment
Advisory Board, whose only oomph in
keeping costs at predestined levels is slash
ing payment rates for doctors providing
services to patients
an uncomfortable
thought for the uncomfortably soon future.
Ryan's plan correctly injects regional

incentive into Medicaid. As it now stands

states determine eligibility and benefi
qualifications for recipients, yet the federal

government gets stuck with half of the
check. Alternatively, the Ryan budget pro
vides states a set amount of cash to spenc
on the medical needs of the poor.
Let's face it. Medicaid is a cruel system
with the program's patient health utterly
indistinguishable from those with no insur
ance whatsoever. Although not ideal, at
least the Ryan Budget allows for local solu
tions and cuts off states who manipulate the
federal gravy train.
Importantly, Ryan has diverged from the
current stalemate in the House whereby
John Boehner, the Tea Party and the Dems
scuffle over symbolic, top-down cuts. Alas
the GOP is not out to hammer the needy or
line the pockets of Scrooge.
Ballooning interest rates, dismal curren
cy and snail-like growth hurt al
Americans. The Bowles-Simpson plan
which Obama has offered a quasi-endorse
ment, achieves deficit-reduction by the
2030s via higher long-term taxation.
Not only is this unpopular, it depletes
the savings of middle class voters who
would otherwise be in a stabler condition to
finance their own healthcare and retire

BY DANIEL DUNCAN

dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

In just three meets this spring, the Garnet men's
and women's track & field teams have qualified a
large contingent for the Centennial Conference
Championships, with one last chance to qualify at
Widener tomorrow.
The women are led by Kenyetta Givans 'l2, the
USTFCCA Division 111 Indoor Track Athlete of the
Year for the Mideast Region and one of the top hurdlers in the Centennial Conference. She has qualified for conferences in dominating fashion, winning
the 100 meter hurdles at The College of New Jersey
Invitational on Saturday, April 9 and coming in second in the event in a season-best 15.13 seconds at
Moravian Greyhound Invitational on Sunday, April
17.

The season best at Moravian is all the more

impressive considering the conditions, as Emily

MacDuffie 'l3 said, "It was really windy."
She has also qualified in the 400 meter hurdles.
Givans ranks in the top three in school history in
both hurdle distances.
Joining Givans at the Centennial Championships
are Rebecca Hammond 'l3 and Stephanie Beebe 'l2,
who placed fifth and seventh in the 1500 meter run

t

the 1500 are Becky Painter 'l3 and Katie Gonzalez 'll,
while Gonzalez and Elliana Bisgaard-Church 'l3
have made the championship field in the 800.
Also making it to Conferences are Chanelle
Simmons 'l4 in the 100 meter dash, Vija
Lietuvninkas 'l4 in the 400 meter dash, and Emma
Saarel 'l4 and Rebecca Woo 'll in the 5000 meter run.
In the field, Chelsea Hicks 'l4 qualified in the triple
jump, Simmons in the long jump, Nicole Cox 'l2 in
the high jump, and Sarah Diamond 'l3 and Naomi
Glassman 'l2 in the javelin throw.
With such a wide variety of qualifiers, the Garnet
hope to improve on last year's eighth place finish at
conferences. Glassman said the relays should contribute as well. "The 4x400s at the TCNJ meet were
some of the best we've run in a while."
The men have a large Centennial squad as well,
led by the distance runners. Jacob Phillips 'l3 has
qualified in the 10,000 meter run at Princeton, while
he and John McMinn 'l3 both placed in the top 10 in
program history in the 3,000 meter.
McMinn, Robert Fain 'l4, Stuart Russell 'l4, Bill
King 'l3 and Aidan Dumont-McCaffrey 'l3 all qualified in the 5,000 meter run at Widener. DumontMcCaffrey, McMinn and Richard Scott 'l4 have also

qualified in the 1500 meter run.
The Garnet have a plethora of qualifiers in the
800 meter run: Scott, Cariad Chester 'l3, Henry
Ainley 'l2, Hugh Troeger 'l4, Matthew Heck 'l3 and
Jake Weiner 'l4. Other qualifiers on the track
include Chris Wickham 'l2 in the 3,000 meter steeplechase; Travis Mattingly 'l2, Eric Verhasselt 'l3
and Chris Mayer-Bacon 'll in the 400 meter hurdles;
Daniel Ly 'l2 in the 100 meter dash; and Heck,
Mayer-Bacon and Dan Kurz 'll in the 400 meter
dash. Mayer-Bacon has also qualified in the 110
meter hurdles.
In the field, Verhasselt, setting up an exhausting
weekend for himself, made it to Conferences in his
first decathlon ever. "I am learning and improving
in the events, and it has been quite the learning
experience," Verhasselt said. Although he is new to
the decathlon, he was pleased with his performance
and excited to compete further.
Also in the field, Ly qualified in the long jump
and triple jump. Aaron Moser 'l3 also made it in the
triple jump.
The conference squads could grow further tomorrow at Widener. The first events start at 5 p.m.

The Swarthmore
men's
and

are on a six-win streak in the season,
while the women have won three out of
four games played. The men now stand
11-6 (7-1 CC) on the season after defeating Washington College, while the
women are 8-8 (7-2 CC).
Both teams hosted Conference opponent Franklin & Marshall on April 9,
dominating the Diplomats with wins of
6-3 for the men and 9-0 for the women.
The Garnet reigned in doubles play,
taking all three games. Stephen
Youngblood 'll and partner Zac Kelm

Bressman 'll and partner Max Kaye 'l4
took No. 2 doubles 8-6, followed by

Frosh going back to Cali
After riding the pine at Penn, guard Casey James
looks to transfer back to West Coast
BY BRIAN KOTLOFF
dailypennsylvanian.com,Apr. 19,

2011

California native Casey James arrived
at Penn this year as a member of a heralded freshman class of seven accomplished
high-school players.

Hailed by ESPN as "the most prolific
shooter in the west," the combo guard said
he came in expecting to play "significant
minutes," even after his recruiters, Glen
Miller and John Gallagher, left for other
coaching gigs.

Then the season

and the Did Not

Plays
began.
Three-quarters of the way through the
28-game schedule, James realized he could
find better opportunities elsewhere. His
decision to transfer became official at the
beginning of April, and he's now looking to
return to his home state.

San Francisco State

THE PHOENIX

University

of the

California Collegiate Athletic Conference
is his current "number-one option," followed by Loyola Marymount, Pacific and
schools in the National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics.
"Basically, my decision is basketballrelated," James said. "I just want to go
back to California to play at a school where
I know I'll play a lot and also have a good
time."
The adjustment from senior captain at
Capistrano Valley Christian to benchwarmer proved difficult for James. He
went from averaging 16.7 points per game
as a senior to playing a total of four minutes all season.
James and fellow freshman guards Dau
Jok and Steve Rennard faced the negative
side of a seven-man recruiting class, as
they became casualties of an eighteen-man

roster.

James said he, Jok and Rennard

grew

"unhappy" sitting the bench for entire
games at a time.
And they're not the first ones. Before
the season, forward Brian Fitzpatrick
transferred to Bucknell, citing the large
roster as one of his main grievances.
Also a Miller recruit, Fitzpatrick was
told by the now-Connecticut assistant
that he would "come in and play right
away." Instead, he found Jerome Allen to

James doesn't see the frustration ending.
"Definitely there's going to be some
problems with playing time and just the
flow of practice."

have different coaching beliefs.
"For a freshman to play in front of a
senior, he has to be that much better,"
Fitzpatrick said in June.
James ran into the same trouble,
explaining "the whole year, you have a
lot more opportunity as an upperclassman than as a freshman, regardless of
how you play. It's set in stone."
When asked the reasons that the
coaches gave the freshmen for their
DNPs, James said, "They would say, 'lf
you don't do certain things offensively or
defensively, then you're not going to get
in the game,'" but did not discuss
specifics.

With three more guards from the
Class of 2015 committed for next season,
the team will again practice and play
with a crowded roster.

Quarterback development Baseball struggles against

key to Pitt football program
BY GREG TRIETLEY
pittnews.com, Apr. 19, 2011

According to head coach Todd Graham,
the key to the future of the Pitt football program is the development of his quarterbacks: Tino Sunseri, Mark Myers and

Anthony Gonzalez.
At Pitt's intrasquad Blue-Gold Game on
Saturday, the importance of the quarterback was on display as starter Sunseri, who
has thrownfor 300 yards once in his career,
attempted 55 passes, mostly from the shotgun, and picked up 416 passing yards.
The junior has had to absorb "bike a
sponge," as Graham phrased it, one of the
more intricate systems in college football.
The system, one that Graham has repeatedly described as no-huddle, high-octane and
explosive, centers around a quarterback
who is capable of running the intricate
offense.
"It takes time to learn," Graham said.
"This system is somewhat complicated,
and all the pressure, I'll tell you, is on the
quarterback. This is a quarterback-driven
offense. We've got to have a quarterback
that is smart and makes good decisions.

We've been impressed with [Sunseri]."

Overall, the Blue-Gold Game showed
that Pitt's skill positions
recruits from
the methodical, plodding Dave Wannstedt
era have adapted to Graham's up-tempo,
no-huddle scheme.
The offensive productivity stood in
stark contrast to that of last year's BlueGold Game, in which the offense scored one
touchdown on a 9-yard run by Sunseri and
former star running back Dion Lewis
picked up just 74 total yards on five carries.
Looking back, the 2010 Blue-Gold Game
was an omen of an offense that often struggled during the season, most notably during a 35-10 loss to West Virginia. If this season's game is any indication, Pitt won't be
struggling to put points on the board very
often.
Pitt averaged 26.3 points per game last
season, while Graham's Tulsa squad put up
seventh in the
414 points per game
nation. Pitt ranked 65th.

But despite the offensive showing in the
Blue-Gold Game, Graham was the first to
admit that nobody should read too much
into Sunseri's more than 400 passing yards
and the starter-laden Blue team's 48-13 victory.

"Gold was made up mostly of our twos
with some guys mixed in," Graham said in
the post-game news conference. "Naturally,
the score was pretty predictable."
Gonzalez also used his feet well on
Saturday, scrambling for 39 yards and
avoiding pressure all afternoon, but the
challenge of leading Pitt's offensive supporting cast against its defensive starters
was too great. He finished just 9 for 26, for
82 yards with two interceptions.
Graham said he was impressed with
both Gonzalez and Sunseri, but it's clear
his quarterbacks are still learning the complicated system's nuances.
"It doesn't even matter what the yards
were today," he said. "We're not even close
to where we want to be in this offense."
Kinks in the scheme appeared occasionally Saturday, especially on riskier gadget

plays. The Blue offense ran a flea-flicker
late in the game, but Sunseri had to throw

the ball away under pressure from the Gold
front seven.

Graham admitted the team ran "pretty
basic stuff" throughout the scrimmage.
"We've got training wheels on right
now," he said.

18

Players have had to adjust to the game
speed that Graham touted when he brought
his system to Pittsburgh from Tulsa.

Conference opponents

Sunseri and the offensive line have spent
much of the spring working on lining up as
quickly as possible, and the entire offense
has quickened its pace between plays.
"The first day when we got out there,
when everybody was running from drill to
drill and everybody was yelling 'high
octane' and [wide receiver coach Mike]
Norvell was yelling to hurry up, we kind of
looked at each other like, 'Whoa, we're not
used to this,'" Sunseri said after the scrimmage. "As each practice moved on, we felt
like our offense got more and more comfortable."
Conditioning the players for the season
has been a priority for the coaching staff
this spring. Pitt forewent a halftime
Saturday and played for more than two
hours with no intermission. In total, the
Panthers ran 100 plays on offense, and

defensive starters each saw about 80.
"We're going to play a whole bunch
more snaps than what they're used to,"
Graham said. "That's why we went 100
snaps. I wanted to show them. Toward the
end there, they were tired. They probably
haven't run 100 snaps in maybe ever."
Now that the coaches have introduced
the offense, the players will have more time
to adjust to both the system and the game
speed during training camp this summer.
Saturday was the first time under
Graham that the Panthers reached tripledigit snaps, and it showed as the scrimmage went on. The firepower displayed in
the first quarter turned into punts by the
fourth —l5 in all.
"We came out quick. We started off pretty strong," wide receiver Mike Shanahan
said after the game. "Then there was a lull
where we had some penalties and some
turnovers
The 100 plays might have
slowed us a bit."
Pitt ran 830 total plays under Wannstedt
last season. With Graham at the helm,
Tulsa ran 1,006.
The passing game looked crisp on
Saturday despite the steady rain that fell
for most of the scrimmage. Some have
doubted the effectiveness of a high-tempo
offense at Heinz Field
a playing surface
often chewed up by inclement weather and
sometimes by two-game weekends
but
the results Saturday suggest otherwise.
"We're going to have games like that,
especially in this part of the country,"
Graham said. "We threwfor over 400 yards,
and I'm standing in ankle-deep water on
that field. That was one of the most encouraging things, seeing how accurately we
threw our edge passes and our comeback
...

passes."

Graham recalled Tulsa's 2009 bowl game
against No. 22 Ball State to show that he
won't change his game plan based on the
weather. Playing in torrential rain that
turned the field into mud, Graham's
Golden Hurricane racked up 632 total yards
in a 45-13 blowout.
Sunseri, a Pittsburgh native, said he
prefers bad weather because it puts pressure on the opposing secondary, which has
to match wide receivers' cuts on a poor
playing surface. Graham doesn't mind the
weather, either.
"It doesn't matter
rain, sleet, snow,
wind," he said. "It doesn't affect how
we're going to operate. We're going to
run our offense. We're going to throw the
ball. We're going to run the ball. We're
going to do all the things just like we

t After

a historic sweep of Johns Hopkins and a much-needed sweep of Washington
t week, the baseball team stumbled this week, going just 1-4 against the 6th place
Muhlenberg Mules, the 9th place McDaniel Green Terror and the 7th place Ursinus
Bears. Just one game out offirst place after the win against Washington, the Garnet lost
two and a half games in the standings and is now vying for the fourth-seed in the
Centennial Conference playoffs.
On Thursday at Muhlenberg, the Garnet carried a 7-2 lead into the eighth inning, but
a string of six singles in the eighth closed the gap to 7-5, and a two-out, three-run ninth
inning home run against Swarthmore closer Ramsey Walker 13 gave the Mules the
walkoff 8-7 victory. The offense was led by two-hit performances from second baseman
Anthony Montalbano 'l2, catcher Mike Waterhouse 'l2 and first baseman Mike
'l2.
Looking for redemption on Friday, the Garnet again took an early lead and watched
it slip away. Paced by a three-hit day from Waterhouse and four runs scored by shortstop Thomas Nakamura 11, the offense put up 14 hits and ten runs, but four
Swarthmore errors and a six-run Muhlenberg fifth put the Garnet on the wrong side of

Ivy League lacrosse players face option of pro careers
Princeton and Brown senior athletes have option to pro careers with minimal salaries
BY JOE SANFILIPPO
pittnews.com, Apr. 19, 2011

While Penn seniors busy themselves
with the On-Campus Recruiting process,
Brown senior David Hawley received his
first job offer this Jan. 21, without ever

applying.
Hawley, who plays midfield for the
Bears' lacrosse team, was tracking the
Major League Lacrosse collegiate draft

online with some friends when his name

popped up 40th overall—a seventh-round
pick by the Boston Cannons.

The New Canaan, Conn, native was
one of 48 college seniors offered a spot to
play professionally beginning this pro season in May.
He joined Princeton attack Jack
Mcßride as one of two players selected
from the Ancient Eight
the fewest Ivy
League selections since the draft's inception in 2001.
Though traditionally held after the
NCAA lacrosse season, the 2011 draftcame
before any of this year's selections had
played a game as a senior.
"That helped kids that had big years
last year and hurt some of the seniors that
kind of came on late and had good years

this year," said Drexel coach Brian
Voelker, who led the Quakers from 2003 to
2009.

The timing of the draft puts Hawley
and his peers in another unique position
of having to choose between professional
lacrosse and other job offers in more common professions.
Studying commerce, organization and
entrepreneurship, Hawley is looking into
finance and real estate opportunities in
the Northeast.
In order to retain NCAA eligibility
throughout the year, players cannot officially decide whether to play professionally or not for months after the draft.
"Any kind of conversation with the
team you were drafted by would deem you
ineligible for NCAA [competition],"
Hawley said. "You kind of get drafted on
that day and wait until the season is over
to actually start conversations with a
team."
And while being drafted into the NBA
or NFL may mean millions in contracts
and endorsements for a college athlete at
the top of his game, the transition to the
MLL doesn't carry quite the same fanfare
especially given one's other options as
an Ivy League graduate.

With just a six-team league and a threemonth season, most players earn less than
and just
$25,000 yearly for their efforts
a select few secure endorsements.
"People aren't building their lives
around those jobs, frankly," said Penn
coach Mike Murphy, who ran a pro combine in Philadelphia several years ago
while at Haverford College.
"The salaries, they're certainly not
enough to live on," Murphy added. "If you

play in the professional indoor league,
[the NLL] and outdoor league you could
maybe put together somewhat of a living."
But the challenges aren't limited to
pay, either.

Voelker, who saw two of his players at
Penn drafted, can easily relate to the grind
of a pro season in tandem with other jobs
and a family.
"I was running around like a chicken
with my head cut off," Voelker said of
playing with the Long Island Lizards
while coaching the Red and Blue in 2003.
"I was already out of town so much
running around, chasing kids and recruiting... it was crazy, it was hectic," he
added.
Voelker noted he had great family support, but not all players are as fortunate,

and aside from juggling multiple jobs and
life at home, potential MLL players need
to first possess enough natural skill and
athleticism just to compete with the best
athletes in the game.
"The bottom line is: it's production,"
Voelker said. "You have to run by people
I don't think
and bury opportunities
our game is that complicated."
Young players must also adjust to a few
key rule changes in the professional
game, like a shot clock used to quicken

game flow.
Another key rule first-year professionals must adjust to is the 16-yard two-point
line. But that seems to suit Hawley just

fine.
"He can really shoot the ball," Murphy
said. "Hawley is particularly valuable for
that league because of the range of his
shot."
And regardless ofrule changes or poor
pay, Hawley now has the chance to continue competing in the sport he's played
since age six.
"It really is just the love of the game,"
Hawley said about his options next year.
"It's hard to ever see it come to an end
I'm open to any opportunity to keep playing."

Yale crew gains 'Victory at Sea' on Housatonic
BY JAMES LU
yaledailynews.com, Apr. 18, 2011

windy conditions on the
Housatonic River on Saturday, Yale lightweight crew left Columbia and Penn in its
wake for a nine-second victory in the
Dodge Cup.
Weather was not enough to stop the second varsity boat, which won its race by 14
seconds. The freshman eight, on the other
hand, was swamped and almost sunk midway through its race on the Housatonic
River Saturday.
"My old coach used to call conditions
like Saturday's 'Victory At Sea,'" said
head coach Andy Card. "At one point I
thought I saw a U-boat snorkel, but I can't
be sure."
It was a disappointing day for all the
Despite

coaches, Card said, because none of them
got to see a contest that was decided solely

by the skill and condition of the rowers.
Though captain Andrew Hakanson 'll

said he had never seen conditions like
Saturday's, he felt the crews handled the

conditions well.
"It is hard to accurately judge our performance, however I feel we did a decent
job of adapting to the conditions," he said.
"We were presented with a challenge from
both our opponents and the weather; we
did a good job rising to the occasion of
both."

Card explained that the results from
the Saturday races cannot be taken at face
value because no one can tell how much
water each boat took on, and hence how
much additional weight each crew had to
pull through the water.
Still, the races were the third-to-last the
Bulldogs will compete in before the championship season begins with the May 15
Eastern Sprints.

Next week the Elis will have a doubleheader on the Housatonic, taking on
Cornell and Delaware in the morning and
Dartmouth for the Durand Cup in the
afternoon.
"With the heats and finals in the champions races we'll need to be prepared to
race twice in one day, so we're looking forward to this upcoming doubleheader at
home as an intense test in that regard,"
said Will Zeng 'll, who sits in the stroke
seat of the varsity boat.
Card said all three crews the Bulldogs
will face next week "look pretty damn fast
by all accounts," adding that he expects
races of greater intensity because of how
close last year's races were. Last year,
Yale's and Dartmouth's varsity boats finished in a dead heat, which Card said was
the first time he could remember such a

result occurring.
"I think this weekend

will be telling,"

Hakanson said. "Our search for speed continues. Our day of judgement will come."
After next Saturday's races, the team
will only have the Goldthwait Cup against
crews from Harvard and Princeton before
the championship season.
Card reiterated that there is no "middle
period" to the lightweight crew team's season, explaining that teams develop at a
rapid pace as the weather warms and the
first month of competitive training is complete.
"I can't say our improvement is linear
with any honesty, but we do focus on getting better every day," he said. "We are
still waiting for the truly stable weather of
a traditional warming April, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards these days,
right?"
Racing will kick off in Derby, Conn.,
from 9 a.m. Saturday, and spectators can
look on from the Gilder Boathouse.

Softball can't shake Conference losing streak

Jakob Mrozewski Phoenix Staff

Infielder Rose Pitkin and catcher Kira Kern high five pitcher Melissa O'Connor.
The Swarthmore softball team continued to struggle against Conference competition, running its losing streak to eight straight with a 0-6 showing last week.
The seven-day stretch was highlighted by three doubleheaders against Ursinus,
Dickinson and Washington, and was epitomized by a 5-0 loss to Dickinson in
which the Red Devil pitcher threw a perfect game.
On Thursday, the Garnet played a home twin-bill against the Ursinus Bears,
losing 3-0 and 10-6. An impressive complete-game pitching performance by Kate
Smayda 'l3 in Game One (7.0 IP, 3 ER, 5 K) was not enough to make up for the lack
of offense, which managed just three singles offof Ursinus starter Jennilyn Weber.
The bats came around in Game Two, scoring six runs on 13 hits (two each from
Smayda, designated player Kira Kern 11, first base woman Krista Scheirer 13 and
shortstop Liz Cushing 'l2), but pitching ace Melissa O'Connor 14 was uncharacteristically knocked around by the Bears, surrendering seven runs and walking
five in just four innings.

broke open a close game and gave the Shorewomen a late lead they would not
