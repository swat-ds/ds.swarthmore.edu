College urges company to
form sexual orientation policy

News

Tactic is similar to anti-apartheid divestiture in the 'Bos
BY BRENDAN KARCH
bkarchl@swarthmore.edu
In the first attempt by a higher
education institution to influence corporate social policies since the antiapartheid divestiture of the 1980's,
Swarthmore is using its shareholder
status to press defense giant Lockheed
Martin to bar employee discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
The college will introduce a stockholder resolution at the annual meeting April 25 asking for a change in
the company's equal opportunity
employment policy, which prohibits
discrimination on the basis or race,
gender, religion and other categories,
but not sexual orientation.
Largely student-initiated, the proposal emerged from Swarthmore's
four-year-old Committee for Socially
Responsible Investing (CSRI). Morgan
Simon 'O4, a student member of the

committee, helped lead the initiative
and will fly to San Diego to present

the college's proposal.
National press coverage of the
action has caught the attention of
Lockheed Martin officials, who will
meet with the Swarthmore representatives on Thursday. It also drew a
spate of hate mail to the students,
including Simon, who were mentioned in an article distributed by the

Associated Press.
Lockheed Martin, a giant defense
contractor focusing on advanced technology systems, employs 125,000 workers and had annual sales in 2001 of $24
billion. Many of the company's competitors, including Boeing, Honeywell
and Raytheon, have already adopted

Unless the company's policy specifically bars such discrimination, "it
offers no protection to its gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgendered employ-

ees, who may become unwitting victims of bias in the workplace," Andy
Wong 'O2 said in an e-mail. Wong is a
student member of the CSRI.

The Onion, features several articles mocking the strict

Blair said he thought The Swonion was an interesting
forum and believed it could not be just a student effort. "It's
relatively knowledgeable, which is one of the surprising

aspects of it," he said.
But Debbie Sloman, an administrative assistant in the
political science department, thinks it is students who are
putting out The Swonion. "I don't think most of us have the
time [to do it]," she said.
The Swonion appears to serve a purpose greater than
entertainment. "It's gotten some people thinking about the
truth beneath the satire," Blair said. Hamza Wali, an environmental services employee, agreed. "This helps," he
said.
Wali also said that the anonymity of The Swonion is a
clear example of the fear many staff have of speaking out
about working conditions. "I'm somewhat puzzled in this

Sky-high prices and SEPTA's continuing refusal to
offer student discount rates have prompted Student
Council
to organize a weekend shuttle to

Philadelphia.

"The administration is committed to funding vans
into Philly as soon as they receive a viable proposal,"
Student Council Co-President Matt Rubin 'O3 said.
"Hopefully, this will happen this semester."
Based on the SC recommendations, the

shuttle

would most likely operate on a
loop on
Friday and Saturday nights. The shuttle would make
stops-at several locations popular with Swarthmore
students, including South Street and concert venue
the Electric Factory.
This won't be the first time the college has organized a Philadelphia shuttle. The last attempt, however, was not successful. The other time the college
offered a van to supplement SEPTA service, student
interest waned, and the administration ended up
scrapping the program.
"We've tried it before, and we're willing to try it
again, but the experience has been that it doesn't
work," Vice President for Facilities Larry Schall
said. "I think that people were excited at first, but
after a while no one was using it. The problem is, you
can't be running a shuttle in every hour.
It doesn't make sense. There aren't enough people
using it."
However, Rubin pointed out that many of the
things that made the shuttle unpopular in the past
can change. While previous shuttles were big yellow
school buses that ran on inconsistent time schedules
and did not stop at places of student interest, the new
van system would be far more convenient.
Most importantly, the Philadelphia van would provide students with the opportunity to remain in the
city after the last SEPTA R3 train back to
Swarthmore". Currently, the last trains on Friday and
Saturday nights return to campus around 11:50 p.m.
For many students, this usually means leaving events

such as concerts before they end. The SC proposal
would address this problem.
Students responded favorably to the idea, but few
said they would use the shuttle regularly. "I would
definitely use it, but only if it happens to be particularly convenient at the time I want to go in," Al Silva
'O4 said. "I'm not going to wait around for an hour or
two."

Parrish renovators hear residents' ideas
BY MATTHEW FITTING

mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

Adam Gross has a complicated, difficult
job ahead of him, with many people to
please. If he didn't know that before, more
than 20 Parrish residents made it clear
Monday night.
The building he has to redesign should
include rooms that feel homey and retain
the idiosyncrasies that make its current
residents love calling it home. It must also
undergo a drastic technological renovation, without losing the likable features its
long history has left behind.
Gross is a partner in Ayers Saint Gross,
the architecture firm charged with
redesigning Parrish. Most of the residents
at the study break live on the east wing of
the second, third and fourth floors, and
they met with Gross and the firm's two
other partners at a study break Monday
night.

"The biggest complaints are about the
systems," she said. "Heating, plumbing,
that kind of stuff." But, she added, there's
no denying that those who live there can
quickly form an attachment.
"People love the location, location, locaalthough they have to climb up
tion
huge, horrible stairs," she said. "I think
they like the character of the building."
Westphal added that even though she
wanted "obviously improved systems, I
want the character of the building to stay
the same."
Parrish's biggest problem lately, she
said, has been with the high female
demand for rooms there. Many females

who live there their first year form an
attachment and want to stay for their
sophomore year. But, with another class
on the way, they are usually forced to
move elsewhere.
"Often they continue to want it,"
Westphal said. "But there's not enough
[room] for them."

"People love the location,

location, location
although they have to
climb up huge,
horrible stairs."
Dean of Residential Life
Myrt Westphal
Most said they like the hominess and
the oddities of their dormitory. They also

enjoy the spacious rooms and single sex
halls. "I was surprised how much storage
space I had," said Qian Li 'O5. "I could not
fill those drawers until I got a boyfriend."
Among the complaints were poor lighting and acoustics. "[The sound of] people
just living their lives on the floor is
unbearable for people on the third floor,"
said Susie Ansell 'O2, Parrish third RA.
Myrt Westphal, dean of residential life,
had her own praise for and complaints
about Parrish.

The residents had several suggestions
and reactions to different plans Gross presented.

Current plans would also move residence halls out of Parrish north, possibly
onto the building's fifth floor.
"We're not thinking about residence
halls [in the north wing]," Gross said.
"We're thinking about more administrative space," adding that one idea included
the admissions office's moving to the second floor, in the space now occupied by
dorm rooms.
The idea immediately drew protest as
many insisted that admissions should stay
at the center of Parrish. But, Gross quickly added, what he described as a "grand"

staircase starting on the first floor would
make it clear that admissions was on the
second floor. He said the majority's desire
seemed to be to keep admissions in a centralized location.
"When I was going on college tours,
there were so many admissions offices that
were hard to find," Vanderwaart said.

"When you're looking at a college, that

makes you just not feel welcome."

The classroom on Parrish third was the
first answer when Gross asked what could
go. "It's really just a novelty," Ansell said.
Though the residents agreed that the
architects should include more social
space and lounges, some balked at the suggestion that the male and female residents
of Parrish should share such a space. "The
guys wouldn't keep the kitchen clean,"
Sarah Bryan 'O5 said jokingly.
The group also had a few suggestions
for how to renovate Parrish apart from
dorm life.
The group objected to the architect's
idea of expanding mailboxes so that packages could fit more easily. "It makes your
day when you get a package [slip],"

Catherine Vanderwaart 'O3 said.
Make sure the higher ceilings stay, was
one piece of advice.
Keep the bulletin boards, was another.
"I give tours, and I always tell visitors
that, if they had to get a feel for the campus, they should just look at the signs,"
Ansell said.
Overall, Susan Sayer, the Parrish
redesign project manager, was pleased
with the evening. "I think the residents,
for the most part, their input has been realistic and reasonable and can be accommodated," she said. "We'll work very hard to
accommodate these needs."

Scholarship created to help students denied aid
In reponse to federal bill, fund will fill in for aid money withheld because of drug convictions
BY MARCUS MROWKA
U-WIRE (D.C. Bureau)
A scholarship for students
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON
deniedfinancial aid due to drug convictions was inaugurated in New York City last week. The foundation of the John
W. Perry Fund is one of the first scholarships set up to offer
assistance to students that are deniedfederal aid due to the
1998 amendment to the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965
that bars students from aid after being convicted of illegal
drug use or sale.
The national fund, the first established to aid ineligible
students, will award scholarships of up to $2,000 to those
affected by the HEA provision. The scholarships are based
on greatest financial need. Current figures indicate that at
least 46,000 would-be students have lost some or all of their
aid during the 2000-01 school year.
Perry, the namesake of the fund, was a New York City
police officer and activist who spoke out against the "war on
drugs." He was killed during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11
after rushing into the first tower moments after the first
plane struck. The fund was named after him as a tribute to
honor his life-long commitment against America's "unfair

drug policies."
"To punish students who are financially unable to go to
college without [federal] assistance is a travesty," said his
mother, Patricia Perry. "John would very definitely be in

favor of students like that."
The HEA was originally created to offer every student
the opportunity to pursue a college-level degree. The act
established federal financial aid programs including
Perkins Loans, Pell Grants, PLUS Loans and Work-Study
programs.

"To punish students who are financially unable to go to college without
[federal] assistance is a travesty."

Patricia Perry
It was amended in 1998 with a new provision, sponsored
by Rep. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) to limit financial aid to students with convicted drug charges. According to the provision, students caught with possession of a controlled substance are ineligible for federal aid for one year after their
first offense, two years after their second and indefinitely
after their third. Students arrested for selling a controlled
substance are ineligible for aid for two years after the first
offense and indefinitely after the second. A student may

program, but the law provides no funds for such treatment.
Campus governments and organizations all around the
country, including George Washington University,
Northwestern University, American University and Yale
University, among others, have endorsed a resolution calling for repeal of the 1998 provision.
Hampshire College, in Massachusetts, created a loan for
any student there denied federal aid because of a drug
record three years ago through a campus-wide vote.
President Gregory Prince calls the ban "part of a larger pattern of the discriminatory impact, intended or not intended,
that the drug policy has had on different communities, particularly minority communities."
Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, voted last month
to make up the difference if any of its students become ineligible for federal aid because of a drug conviction.
Souder has since said that the bill was misinterpreted.
He says he meant to bar aid from those students already getting federal aid when convicted.
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) recently introduced a bill
to repeal the HEA drug provision. The bill currently has 57
co-sponsors; one Republican and 56 Democrats. A similar
bill was introduced by Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) in 20G% but
the amendment failed by 15 votes in a 31-16 committee deci-

sion.
There is no word on if and when the bill to repeal the provision will reach the House floor.

Pranks plague Parrish, printers

Council proposes
overhaul of financial
aid review process

BY NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN
nashbykl@swarthmore. edu
One April Fools' Day prankster believes
Swarthmore uses the words "postmodern," "capitalism" and "Afghanistan" too much. With a bit
of computer programming, he instructed public
laser printers in Beardsley and McCabe to
remove those words and about 260 others on
Monday, leaving blank spaces in many students' printed documents.
The unusual prank left some students heading to class with incorrect printouts.
Information Technology Services (ITS) employees spent several hours trying to find the source
of the problem and resolve it.
Gabe Rosenkoetter 'O2, who wrote the program that caused the prank, said Monday night
that he did not believe it caused much harm. "It
was noticeable, but not destructive enough to be
a big deal," he said. "It's one of those things people can shrug off."

Several Student Council members met with Director of Financial
Aid Laura Talbot on Tuesday to discuss student concerns about the
financial aid appeals process.
"We're looking into making sure that all students have equal and
fair access to a substantial review process," Student Council CoPresident Matt Rubin 'O3 said. "Currently, there is some confusion
among some students about how to access an appeals committee
other than the Financial Aid Office."

"We're looking Into making sure that all
students have equal and fair access to a
substantial review process."
Matt Rubin 'O3, SC co-president

"It was noticeable, but not
destructive enough to be a
big deal. It's one of those
things people can shrug off."
Gabe Rosenkoetter 'O2

Currently, Talbot herself handles the review process. Students
and their families are assigned to a financial aid worker. However, if
they feel that they are not getting satisfactory aid, they can request
a review of any aid decision. The review itself is conducted independent of the primary evaluation, but there is no official way to
appeal a decision outside of the financial aid department.
Talbot refused to comment on the existing financial aid policy
and her role in the council's proposed review.
Many students support the council in its attempts to formulate
an official review policy. "I've heard that there is an unsatisfactory
appeals process," Sherry Choe 'O5 said. "I think it would be a positive step toward bettering the financial aid situation."
Jared Passmore 'O4 agreed that a new appeals process would
strengthen the college's commitment to meeting every student's
need.
"I think it's a good idea," he said. "Every effort should be made
to make financial aid a case by case process."

Robin Jacobsen, ITS's manager of client
services, disputed that interpretation in a
Monday afternoon e-mail she sent to ITS
employees, two deans and The Phoenix. "After
hours of troubleshooting, we were able to
resolve the problem," Jacobsen wrote, "but
many students were upset because they needed

to [print out] papers and couldn't."
The prank did not affect documents printed
from PCs, only those from Macintosh computers. According to Jacobsen's e-mail, ITS employees first tried to fix the computers before realizing that the problem was instead with the printers. They tried resetting the printers and assigning them new network addresses before switching to a new print server. Macintoshes in the
Beardsley computer lab printed correctly by late
afternoon and those in McCabe by the evening.
Rosenkoetter, who for April Fools' Day last
year programmed Clothier tower's bells to ring
randomly at 3 a.m., said he created the prank in
the Postscript computer language, which computers use to communicate with printers. His
program, which he sent to public printers several times Monday, created a list of the 260
words to remove and redefined the Postscript
functions that create text on a page to accomplish the prank. The program itself
was
straightforward. "You use very simple procedural stuff in Postscript to walk through that
list and use functions that already exist in
Postscript to detect the words," Rosenkoetter

said.
Marc Richards 'O2, a public area lab manager for ITS, spent part of his evening reconfiguring the McCabe computers for the new print
server, but he said the switch to the new server
needed to be done soon anyway and was not
what really solved the problem. In the end, "it
fixed itself," Richards said.
The problem disappeared when a computer
told the printer to deactivate the preloaded
Postscript commands, Rosenkoetter said. One of
his friends had sent those instructions to all the

affected printers by 7 p.m. Monday night.

Rosenkoetter speculated that since printouts

from PCs were unaffected, the Windows

operat-

ing system may include similar reset commands
embedded in the documents it sends to printers.
The idea for the prank may be relatively
unique

one similar stunt
but all printers that use
Postscript are susceptible to it. To prevent copycat pranks, Rosenkoetter said, he does not
intend to make a functional version of his program publicly available.
Still, other good programmers could write
their own. Rosenkoetter said he did not know
Postscript before Sunday night, when he consulted online manuals while writing his program. He said it only took him four or five hours
to complete the code.
The loophole has existed since Postscript's
invention in the 1980s. Since such pranks are

uncommon anyway, Rosenkoetter believes programmers with the appropriate knowledge are
conscientious. "Most people who would take
the time to do this," he said, "would also be
responsible enough to know when the joke
stops."

The other major campus prank Monday
involved a bizarre series of fake reserved-students e-mails. Some of the messages claimed
that student records had been stolen from a
computer database. A second set that was also
apparently forged urged students to disregard
the first set. The e-mails, which ostensibly were
from deans Bob Gross and Tedd Goundie and
Registrar Martin Warner, were illegitimate,
Jacobsen said.

The Ring hosts panel on dynamics of free speech
New organization hopes to promote discussion of ideological differences among students
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

nbrundal@swarthmore.edu

Ben Park 'O2 wants to provide students
at Swarthmore with an open forum in
which they can discuss their differences in
ideology.
On Monday, he hosted the first meeting
ofThe Ring, an organization established to
achieve this type of exchange. Although
The Ring used to be affiliated with the
Swarthmore Christian Fellowship (SCF), it
now exists independently and has formed
its own leadership board. With four moderators and an audience of 30, this week's

discussion focused on the issues behind
free speech on the Swarthmore campus.
"The Ring is working under the goal of
promoting student discussion of differences on the Swarthmore campus," Park
said.
Brandon Silverman 'O2, Liz Brainard
'O3, Ted Chan 'O2 and Rajaa Shakir 'O4 led
the discussion, during which the group
agreed that free speech should not be compromised but felt that it was important to
understand the effects of what you say and
what it means to speak your mind without
anonymity.
The Coming Out Week chalkings were
one of the most heavily debated topics of
the evening. Each year, these chalkings

include

remarks and

drawings on the walkways throughout

campus. Several members of the audience
felt that this year's chalkings went too far,
because they created an atmosphere that
ran counterproductively to the goals of

Coming Out Week.
"I definitely think that a heterosexual
bias exists on this campus, but I also think

that this year SQU went too far," Chan
said. He noted that the explicit nature of
the chalkings and the responses to them
created an atmosphere less accepting of
those who may have wanted to come out
that week.
"People should be self-reflective and
introspective to how people will respond to
what they say," he said. "Extremely strong
free speech often leads to a polarization
that is harmful."
"I don't think there's a problem with
free speech," Shakir said. "I think there's a
problem when people don't question what
they say. Freedom of speech doesn't warrant abuse of free speech."
Several members of the queer community in the audience disagreed, contrasting
free speech that is offensive with free
speech that is harmful.
Jackie Aponte 'O2 pointed out that the
chalkings were done on an individual basis
and that SQU or the Queer-Straight
Alliance had not scripted them. She
referred to the multiple goals of the week,
including recognition and visibility of the
gay community. "A lot of the chalkings are

UPenn professor speaks on welfare conditions
BY REIKO TESHIBA
rteshibl@swarthmore.edu

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Elijah Anderson discusses his fieldwork, which takes
place in areas fed by drug money, gambling and welfare.

6

Elijah Anderson conducts his fieldwork at car washes.
He strikes up a conversation with the black boys with their
rags and Windex and takes them to lunch to learn about
their lives.
On Tuesday afternoon, Anderson, the Charles and
William L. Day Distinguished Professor of the Social
Sciences and Professor of Sociology at the University of
Pennsylvania, spoke about the realities of people oh welfare
in his lecture, "The Impact of Welfare Reform on the Inner
City Poor."
Anderson did his fieldwork in what he calls "ground
zero" neighborhoods in Philadelphia. These areas are ridden with poverty and crime. He said that in these neighborhoods, which are predominantly black, the money generators include low-wage jobs, income from drugs, gambling,
theft and welfare payments.
The rationale for welfare reform, according to Anderson,
was to create an incentive for people to get work. This was
possible when the economy was booming, but with the
onset of the recession, they have had to turn to drugs and
crime for the sake of survival.
Anderson described how the welfare recipients have
found themselves in a "culture of dependence." He drew a
contrast between the "decent" people, those who believed
they could improve their situation by hard work and education, and "street" people, those who were unable to cope,
thus socializing their children into the "codes of the street."
"To take care of yourself is part of the code," Anderson
said. "Acting tough builds up your reputation." He
described how many welfare recipients would spend their
monthly paycheck as soon as they got it, causing them to
borrow or gamble to make ends meet. They would use subsequent paychecks to pay off debts. Anderson also said the
"community of scarcity" caused a psychological need for
material luxuries.
April 4, 2002

Anderson has done extensive ethnography at car washes. "I'm interested in the interface between crime and legitimate work," he said. "When times are tough, even good
people can go wrong." He pointed out that the car wash is
stratified: The older men act as trustees, and the younger
boys work for tips, which could amount to $5O to $6O a day.
When Anderson took the three boys from the car wash out
to lunch, he asked them, after the ice had broken, how long
it would take for them to steal his 1992 blue Ford Explorer.
"About two minutes" was the answer.
"These young men were thugs," Anderson said. "I mean,
thugs. They represented the bottom tier of the car wash. But
they really wanted to work. One of them kept asking me for
a job the whole time. I think it's very important to appreciate the situation 'ground zero' in the context of an increas-

ingly globalized society and economy."
Student responses to the presentation were mixed. "I
wanted to hear more about the effects of the recession on
welfare reform," Jonah Eaton 'O2 said. "I was expecting
something more economically oriented.""
"I thought the lecture was well presented and well organized," Laurel Kean 'O3 said. "I'm always a little surprised
when someone's lecture is so scripted, but given its speechlike style, it was interesting."
Matt Kaufman 'O2 said he thought "Anderson's talk was
really provocative. The picture he painted of 'ground zero'
seemed like it was a forgotten place, where there was no law
enforcement or financial entrepreneurship.
"We think of welfare work as a good thing," Kaufman
continued. "America lives in exorbitant wealth, but within
its borders, we have people struggling daily for survival."
Anderson taught at Swarthmore as an assistant professor of sociology between 1973 and 1975. He received a B.A.
from Indiana University, an M.A. from the University of
Chicago and a Ph.D. from Northwestern. Anderson has
received the Robert E. Park Award from the American
Sociological Association for his book, "Streetwise: Race,

Class and

Change

in an Urban Community."

When most people graduate from Swarthmore, they

will spend next year studying dance in India and Brazil.
Lee has won the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, which
will pay for her studies for a year.
"Dancing the Body Divine: Religious Dance in Brazil
and India" is the title ofLee's project, which will send her
to the Bahia region of Brazil to research the candomble
and numerous locations in India to learn kathak dance.
"Dance is something I am really passionate about," Lee
said. She has shown that interest by earning an honors
minor in dance, and she is currently taking two classes in
Indian dance from Pallabi Chakravorty, a Mellon postdoctoral fellow teaching at Swarthmore this year.

dance and helping her find contacts in India. Lee's program in India will take her to Ahmedabad and Calcutta,
where she will study with "a famous cutting-edge choreographer" who has visited and performed at Swarthmore.
Candomble, the Brazilian dance Lee will study, links
African Yoruban traditions with Catholic ideas. It is
sometimes considered the Brazilian equivalent of Cuban
santeria and Haitian voodoo. She first became interested
in candomble when a friend of hers learned it and has
since "taken some African dance classes here" and

become "really interested in the music."
"I don't think [winning the Watson] means I'm definitely going into dance as a career," Lee said, "but dance

Although Lee was the only Swarthmore student to win

Altogether "32 students submitted proposals and personal statements," the two parts that make up a Watson

College urges company to bar sexual
orientation discrimination in policy
From CHALLENGE, pg. 3
The company also has an Executive Diversity
Council, and supports the affinity group Gay,
Lesbian, or Bisexual at Lockheed Martin (GLOBAL). The Phoenix was unable to contact any
members of GLOBAL.

"We want to be independent of any employee
group," Welsh said. She thinks it is important to
separate the college's proposal from internal
employee concerns.
In the past, Lockheed Martin has faced lawsuits charging discrimination. In 1996, the com-

pany settled a class action age discrimination
suit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC).
In December 2000, the EEOC joined a private
class action racial discrimination lawsuit led by
famed attorney Johnnie Cochran.

That lawsuit alleged that Lockheed Martin
permitted discriminatory behavior such as
racial slurs, intimidation and the dissemination
of Ku Klux Klan material and graffiti. The case
was dropped in Aug. 2001 due to insufficient evidence.

"I think this effort has the
potential to generate more constructive shareholder
activism on campuses across
the country."
Andy Wong 'O2
of Lockheed
Corporate representatives
Martin have already been in contact with the

college to discuss the possibility of dropping its
proposal.
According to Simon, the representative asked
if Lockheed Martin could do anything short of
changing its policy that would convince
Swarthmore to abandon the resolution. The college sees little room for leeway.
"We would be happy to drop the resolution if
they would just change the policy," Simon said.
Simon is unsure how much will be accomplished at Thursday's pre-shareholder meeting.
"Basically it seems like the goal of that meeting is for them to try and show us that the policies that they have in place are sufficient,"

Simon said.
Why won't Lockheed Martin simply change
the policy? "That's something I'm not entirely
sure of," Simon said. She added, however, that
shareholders at other corporations have tried to
reverse policies that bar discrimination gays, lesbians and transgendered individuals, and that
Lockheed Martin could be afraid of such a backlash.
Following a college press release on March 27,
the national media has covered the proposal. The
Chronicle of Higher Education is planning an
article for next Monday, and the Associated Press
(AP) wrote a piece that was widely syndicated in
Tuesday's newspapers.
On the same day that articles appeared in the
national media, Simon, who was quoted in the

AP article, received hate e-mails condemning her
actions as immoral, un-Christian and socialist.
An evolving committment
The college shareholder proposal is the result
of an evolving commitment from the Committee
on Socially Responsible Investing, which works
the Board of
with the Investment Committee
Managers' formal committee for overseeing
investment
to give social activism a voice in
college shareholding. Much of the committees'
memberships overlap, with Welsh and three
other CSRI members also serving on the
Investment Committee.
In the past, the committee has focused more
on guiding the college in proxy voting for shareholder clauses, but it slowly developed the idea of
writing its own proposal.
Welsh sees Swarthmore's resolution as part of
a national trend toward greater responsibility on
the part of stockholders.
"There has been an increasing interest in the
emphasis in the role of the shareholder as the
ultimate owner of the company," Welsh said. "I

Research Center, no college has on its own issued
a shareholder resolution since the 1980's, when
colleges and universities led the shareholder
movement to divest in companies that did business in apartheid South Africa. That movement
helped toppled the system.
However, Swarthmore doesn't intend to pursue divestiture if Lockheed Martin doesn't
change its policy. Welsh called the shareholder
proposal an "active" stance, as opposed to divesting.
"We would own it or not own it based on eco-

work together.
"I've been just amazed as to just how much
support they have given," Simon said of the BOM
Investment Committee.
Because that committee must focus on maintaining a strong endowment, Welsh said, much of
the legwork on socially responsible investing has
been left up to CSRI student members, who did
much of the research and communication for the
Lockheed Martin resolution.
"Most of the work and time has been handled
by student members of the committee," Welsh
said. Future social activism through shareholding, she added, depends on continued student
interest.

SQU posters did not. "Signing your name

the anonymity and not taking responsibility for what you say that is so harmful."

crucial to mutual understanding and
acceptance on campus. "I think it's a very

"

where people have the freedom to say
what they're thinking, but where you also
have the ability to go up to them and discuss it with them," she said.
Samantha Crane 'O4 also felt that dialogue was important but said there was a
difference between discussion and force.
"I feel like I should be free to talk to people about my personal views, and I feel
like people should be free to talk to me
about their personal views; that's what
dialogue is," she said. "But there's a fine
line between this and forcing someone to
do something."

Overall, students praised The Ring as a
way to promote discussion and understanding on campus. "I thought the Ring
was very interesting," Brandon Carver 'O4
said. "Very rarely do different groups get

to sit down and talk about relevant issues.
I thought the discussion was very insightful, and it gave me a better insight on certain issues that I didn't know the full
history of."
Other students felt the discussion fell
into the trap of trying to determine who
was right and who was wrong, rather than
coming to reasonable compromises
between differing parties.
"I would have liked to have seen more
time spent talking about this community
and our responses to different types of free
speech on campus, because that is what
we needed to talk about to some extent,"
Tamika Songster 'O4 said. "I feel like its
one thing to say that we promote free
speech, but I don't know that we always
promote the environment for free speech

on a personal or on an institutional level."
The Ring is planning another discussion later in this semester. It will probably
involve debate over whether fundamentalism and Western capitalist values are
inherently incompatible.

Proposal's promise
For the first time since the uproar over last year's athletics cuts, Swarthmore is back in the national spotlight,
and this time it is for a far more palatable reason. In a
move that is reminiscent the anti-apartheid divestitures of
the 1980s, the college is using its status as a shareholder in
the defense contractor Lockheed Martin as a way to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The shareholder proposal aims to change the Fortune
500 company's equal opportunity employment policy to
include a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation. Members of the Committeefor Socially Responsible
Investing (CSRI) wrote the proposal, which stockholders
will vote on at their April 25 meeting. Social activism
through shareholder initiatives is a relatively new idea,
and Swarthmore is the first institution of higher education
that has tried to influence corporate social policy since the
divestiture movement. It's an admirable effort, and it just

CSRI members this week to discuss the proposal.
The method in which the committee approached its
goal, however, is a bit surprising. Rather than addressing
a problem at a specific corporation that had come to its
attention, the committee selected an issue to address
equal opportunity employment
and then looked into the
practices of whatever Fortune 500 companies in which
Swarthmore had enough stock to write a shareholder proposal. Lockheed Martin was the only one that didn't bar
discrimination based on sexual orientation.
If the CSRI wanted to tackle the issue of queer rights in
the workplace at companies the college is invested in, it
might have been better off contacting the queer community at a specific company and seeking advice on what workplace issues were most important to them rather than
picking an issue and then finding a company. Lockheed
Martin itself supports an organization called Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual at Lockheed Martin (GLOBAL). Perhaps different issues, such as benefits for same-sex couples, are a
greater concern for them than simply adding a phrase to
the company's discrimination policy.
In any case, if the path the CSRI is taking does effect
change by formalizing queer rights, its actions will have
been well worth it. It seems clear that Swarthmore has the
clout to attract the media spotlight, and accordingly, the
attention of corporation bigwigs. If the college believes in
equal opportunity enough to bar discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation, it is only responsible to take
the next step and promote such opportunity at other institutions. The corporations Swarthmore supports through
shareholding should reflect the principles of the college.
On a left-leaning campus that recognizes its Quaker heritage, promoting equal opportunity employment seems like

a given.

A new way to appeal
Right now, the only way to appeal a financial aid decision is to call on Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot.
Regardless of whether you can't handle that big a loan,
whether your grants just aren't enough, or whether one or
both of your parents are refusing to help pay that $36,000
price tag, the only option open to students is to make their
case to the same director of financial aid whose office put
their package together.
This is not about whether Talbot specifically is capable
of making fair decisions on a case-by-case basis. The point
is that no one person should be placed in a position of such
power. Student Council Co-President Matt Rubin 'O3 uses

all the right words when he describes what the council
envisions for a new appeals process: fair, equal, substantive. He hopes for a multiperson committee composed of
members outside the Financial Aid Office.
It should be a process to which aU students have access
and through which changes in the college's financial aid
policy can take place. If an abnormally large number of
students show that the FAFSA or the CSS Profile or the
college itself inaccurately portrays their financial situation, the Financial Aid Office should act accordingly.
If Student Council accomplishes nothing else for the
rest of this semester, the establishment of a fair, substantive financial aid appeals process will stand as proof that
theirs was not an administration that sat idle, ignoring a
crucial campus issue.

Prejudice unacceptable
even in casual writing
Dear Editor:
In his column "On being sketchy" (March 28),
Matthew Fitting calls rural Tennesseans trailer trash.
Just by using the phrase "trailer trash," Fitting suggests
that people who cannot afford permanent houses are
worthless. And to suggest that all people who live in
small Tennessee towns are poor and trashy and own
mean dogs reveals not only class bias but also ignorance
of American demography. I too make assumptions about
others that I should not make. But we must try hard,
even in casual writing, not to prejudge people whose cul-

tures or circumstances are differentfrom our own.

Effects of war must come before politics
BY JENNIFER HOLZER

jholzerl@swarthmore.edu

On Monday, I had the opportunity to attend a meeting of the Israeli Consulate General with the Jewish
Community
Relations
Council of
Greater
Philadelphia. To my surprise, I did not see suits scrutinizing political opinions or criticizing their leaders
at home and abroad. I saw people in pain, feeling helpless, finding comfort in brainstorming actions they
could take to support their families and friends in
Israel.
Sitting in that boardroom, I felt the pain of a sensitive person who has grown up without knowing war. I
felt it when I heard about the bombing that killed over
100 Israelis as they sat down to their Passover seder,
knowing that my cousins heard those ambulances
from their home in Netanya. It was precisely the pain
of Sept. 11, when I contemplated the incomprehensible
and feared for my dad, who works in New York.
We can and must "question the war," that is,
America's own war against terrorism as well as
Israelis. We must certainly question whether the

This school needs more projects. Not more projects really,
but more cool stuff being done. Swarthmore students, I
believe, do not do nearly enough, and I am as guilty as anyone.
I understand that many students do many different activities, which is a good thing. But I don't think that we are doing
many things that really have much import or really impact
each other's lives. We may get 200 people who want to be CAs,

Early last semester, I came up
with what I thought was a
great idea. It was called, "Campout in the Crum," and this is
what would happen. Everyone who wanted would camp out
down by the Crum one night, maybe on a Friday night or
something. It would be a fun night for everyone who decided
to go down there with a little something for everyone.
There would be a traditional campfire with marshmallows
being roasted for s'mores and hot dogs, too. There would be a
group of people singing songs while someone played a guitar,
and there would be a scary story telling group off to the side
in the dark. There would be lovey-dovey couples wandering
off together, and some immature boys would even raid the
girls' area. Basically, it would be a camping outing straight
from the movies, with a few hundred of your closest friends.
Now maybe you think this is a pretty lame idea, but I am
guessing that it appeals to a good bunch of you. If we can get
almost a hundred people to watch a movie on chickens and
frogs on a Tuesday night, we should at least get that many fo

Reworking SAT levels playing field
Current exam tests one thing: your ability to study for the test
BY MATTHEW MUGMON
The Daily Pennsylvanian (U. Pennsylvania)
(U-WIRE) PHILADELPHIA

An SAT prep

teacher once told me that the SATs only test you on
one thing: your ability to take the SATs.
It seems that the college admissions process, as a
whole, only tests one thing: your ability to get into a

particular college.

Claims about the unfairness of college admissions
are nothing new, and that discussion has always centered around the SATs.
Some decry the SAT for not accurately reflecting

what students learn in their high school classes.
Some claim it doesn't serve as an adequate "predictor" of how well students will do in college.
According to a University of California study last
fall, the SAT I is more socio-economically biased
than than the subject-based SAT lis, which were also
reported to better predict college performance than
the former.
And a spring ago, some top American business
executives, with the National Urban League at the
helm, signed a letter encouraging universities to pay

less attention to applicants' standardized test scores
and more to their potential for leadership and
growth.

Last week, The New

York Times reported that
the College Board is planning an overhaul of the
test. The College Board is

spinning the change as a
way to improve the edu-

cation of high schoolers.
After the revamping, the

focus more on their classwork.
Anything that will make high schoolers more diligent students can't be a bad thing, even if I have
severe doubts that an annoying Saturday test could
possibly motivate 16-year-olds to spend that extra
hour studying trigonometry.
But much of the real problem lies in testing itself

no matter how you cut it. Revamping the SAT to
make it "fairer" or more indicative of what students
have learned in high school only further obscures
the real problems
inherent and daunting
in our
nation's college admissions process. The SAT is built
on the naive premise that an adequately objective

way of comparing college applicants is possible.
In an article in The Daily Pennsylvanian last year
about the letter from business leaders, University of
Pennsylvania Admissions Dean Lee Stetson called
the SATs "a measure of many measures in the admis-

Unfortunately, none of the "many measures" is

much.
In a system as haphazard as the college admissions process, every "measure"
especially a standardized test
only makes an unfair system look
less so at the surface.
But it's not time to give up hope.
As it stands, college admissions is a crap shoot
for students and universities.

finding objectivity in admissions
a problem that
likely has no solution.
The test lets institutions of higher education
think they have got some way of looking at high
schoolers from all backgrounds and from all regions
on some sort of standard platform. The theory is that
other parts of the admissions process are inadequate
and filled with loopholes. Universities can't really
compare students from across the nation based on
grade point averages or extracurricular activities, or
what goes on page 217 of your autobiography.
And the fact that every single person in your family for eight generations has gone to Penn

"predictor" of college success, what is "success,"
and should universities, then, only be searching for
students they think will get good grades in college? A
university that answers "yes" to the second part of
that question isn't a nurturing academic environment.
But removing
rather than revising
standardized exams entirely from the admissions process
would be the first step toward revamping the admissions process as a whole. Getting rid of the test would
not be easy, but it would take away the convenient
option that colleges can use to make their final student "purchasing" decisions. And it could make them
think more about why they accept the students they
do.

Once an institution defines whom it's looking for
and it shouldn't just be high schoolers who pay
attention in class
it can start finding the right criteria by which to judge them.
Not that any of the current criteria can't stay

Replacing a meal card with grocery shopping and a dorm room with an apartment
often comes out of a search for psychologi-

cal distance from campus. It's an appealing alternative to those seeking either a
taste of or a return to more independence.
Off-campus living rarely
results in increased physical
distance from campus for
those students who opt out of
dorm life. Only a small portion of the approximately 100
students who live off campus
each year live as far away as

Philadelphia;
most
take
apartments in the ville
and
many are closer to the center
of campus than students living in Mary Lyon or PPR.

Still, their experiences
have a different flavor from
those of dorm-dwellers.
Since Swartmore makes
it easy for students to stay on

campus all four years, and
living off campus does not
always mean saving money,
the primary factor in the
choice to live off campus is
usually personal preference.
Those students who do
live off campus rarely regret

their choice. About twothirds of the students who
choose to do so are seniors,
and some see the experience
as a helpful transition to life
after college.
Spruce Street, Philadelphia
"It's not New York, and
it's not Omaha," William
Williams 111 'O2 said, comparing Philadelphia to the quintessential big city and to his
hometown. In part, it was
the appeal of city living that
led Williams to move into a
big brownstone apartment
with high ceilings on Spruce
Street, close to the campus of
Penn, where he is president
of a regional fraternity.
His junior year, one of his
frat brothers was looking for
an apartment in the city, and

THE

Williams decided to go along
with him. After finding a
place, the hurdle was convincing his parents that living off campus would be beneficial. "I wanted off campus,
Philly wasn't too far and I
thought it would be cheaper."
In actuality, Williams
said, although the bare
necessities of his setup cost
less than Swarthmore's
room and board, he has
ended up spending more
money this year, due to gas
expenses for his car and "frequent stops at the pizza shop
on the corner."
Because of his job as one
of the Student Employment
Office coordinators, he chose
not to go abroad his junior
year. In a sense, living in
Philadelphia is a substitute
for that forgone experience.
"It's been fun. It's difficult,
but it's real fun," he said. He
said there is more to do on
weekends with easy access to
clubs and other city amenities. He is glad he no longer

has to deal with the typical

on-campus struggle of finding
something to eat at 2 a.m.,
and he enjoys being able to
devote more time exploring
places like

South Street.
The biggest adjustment

for him was buying groceries
that and parallel parking.
"I'm a pro now," Williams
said. Finding a spot near his
apartment is a challenge, and
spots are metered. "One
time, I spent 15 to 20 minutes
trying find a parking spot,"

he said. Parking tickets are
another annoyance.

"I spent a fair bit of time off campus even
before I lived here," he said. "It's not a complete shift of my sensibilities or my activities

Issenberg found dorm life to be one of the

He likes the freedom and the space away
from the dorms. "It puts things in perspective. You get to see the real world a little. Not
much, but a glimpse."
Living off campus lends "more of an upperclassman perspective to the college experience." He said it was a more typical experience, noting that, at many other colleges and
universities, it is the usual course for juniors
and seniors to move out of campus housing.
Living off campus also provides a return
to a more familiar routine. "It's more of an
experience like it was in high school. You go
to school in the day and come home in the
evening. It's something I actually prefer,"

Neff said.
While the majority of his friends are living on campus, he doesn't mind the slight
separation. "When you live on campus, so

Like Solomon, Neff said he liked cooking
and has been to Sharpies only twice this year.
He said the cost of living in the ville ended up
about equal to college room and board.
Parking in the ville is a little difficult, though,
he said, and the tickets can get expensive. To
connect to the college network, Neff has DSL

The case of the mistaken Monet
Our columnist's expatriate cousin finds love through art, only to lose it because of confused identity
BY JOEY SPADOLA
jspadola@swarthmore.edu
I have before my eyes just now an
extraordinary letter which I received several days ago from a cousin very dear to
my affections. This cousin has recently

undertaken the existence of a vagrant
bohemian in Europe. I have always
received her correspondence with joy, for
she is a cultured lady of many accomplishments. To some she appears to be a mere
poseuse, but this is simply the term the
jealous employ for genius.
On this occasion, unhappily, her missive heralds more grief than wisdom.
Nonetheless, I would have the reader see
part of it, because it is an unforgettable
example of

our human frailty.

On all these points I
could not but assent. She
is a quite a marvel, this
cousin of mine. And we
must call a spade
a spade.
"O eyes!" begins the missive, after the
usual salutations, "O eyes, no eyes, but
fountains fraught with tears! O life, no life,
but lively form death! Were I able, my dear
cousin, to impart to you the tenth part of
the anguish, of the affliction, of the malheur, which in recent days I have had to
endure, you would not wish to live on; you
would have, as I now have, the abiding horrible desire to end it all; you would pine, I
say, for rest, and you would adore the
grave, for there alone is dispensed the
sweet nepenthe of rest eternal.
"Now, you know quite well that I am
well made. Do I not attract, wherever I
direct my delicate feminine steps, the longing stares of men of every ilk and of every
age? Have I not had to turn down pretenders innumerable, and these not always
unattractive or unaccomplished? And
indeed I am more than a pretty face. I am a
lady ofparts. Can I not recite, with flawless

precision, the whole fourth book of the
Georgics, without so much as missing a
single dactyl? Do I not speak
nay, compose verse in
no fewer than seven languages? And to speak generally, who, dearest cuz, among the women whom you have
met in your life, is wittier than I, or sharper than I, or cleverer than I, or funnier
than I? In short, am I not a dove among
crows? Do I not coo, while the rest but
squawk?"
On all these points I could not but
assent. She is a quite a marvel, this cousin
of mine. And we must call a spade a spade.
"So that it will seem all the more surprising and indeed unjust," continues my
ill-starred relation, "that I should have met
with the misfortune that, recently, has

been my lot.

"It happened thus. I decided once upon a
fine day to attend in Paris a certain art
gallery which in the highest artistic circles
had acquired some fame for its exhibits,
mostly modern, though classics were not to
go unrepresented. Now, in this there is

THE PHOENIX

nothing out of the ordinary; there are not
dimes enough in the world to match the
number of such exhibits I have seen, and
this one appeared to me at the time to merit

no distinction. But O cruel fortune! Of what
pain it was to be the occasion!
"I was strolling leisurely through the
gauntlet of paintings, contemplating each
with a lazy but nonetheless artistic eye,
when I was stopped, tout a coup, by a painting of the most necromantic allure. Its
effect on me was as mysterious and inexplicable as that of wine on the spirit.
Indeed I was intoxicated with the genius of
the piece. In one glance the fetters of complete adoration were fettered. I stood
entranced, wondering whether it was heaven or a canvas that I saw before me.
"After a long interval of gaping in awe, I
shook myself as from a daze. I took a step
closer to the painting, and saw the numerals 'O2. It was a production of this very
year! Here was a new artist, exploding,
fresh and vigorous as a vernal sunrise,
upon the artistic scene. I must meet the
man, I swore to myself. I bent my gaze closer; and it was then that I saw written, in
the most flamboyant lettering that human

hand has ever produced, the words at the
sight of which my heart shall forever
throb: C. Monet.
"For this Mr. Monet, in one instant, I
tumbled amorous
as the French have it.
It was love; love at first sight; at first sight
not of his face but of his name
of his art.
Before the expiration of 10 seconds, I had
already resolved upon holy matrimony

upon eternal union with the divine artist
whose face I had never seen but of whose
soul, through a mere canvas, I had partak-

en. Those there are who may consider such

a thing precipitous, but you, I fancy, dearest friend, are not among them.

"I entertained little doubt but that after

a single interview the good monsieur
would be mine. My charms are not few, as
we have signalized above; and when ardent
and youthful passion is mingled with
these, it is an unfathomable proposition
that I should be rejected. Immediately,

Here was a new artist,
exploding, fresh and
vigorous as a vernal sunrise, upon the artistic
scene. I must meet the
man, I swore to myself.
therefore, I betook myself to search in the
local directories for a C. Monet, and
although it cannot be imagined that either
the surname of Monet, or the initial of C, is
uncommon among the Parisians, there was
listed only one; and that, I was sure, was
my man. I took down the address, put on
my finest attire, and showed up, glowing,
at the doorstep of my would-be husband.
"This latter, as I discovered upon his
answering the door, was not unattractive.
He was young and of good stature. He possessed large handsome gray eyes, which

spoke well and with conviction. There was

charm in his every movement. On seeing
him, I was entirely confirmed in my intentions, and I did not delay in letting them be
known to this stranger whom I desired as a
spouse.
"He politely confessed to be flattered by
the proposition, but was, as he said, the
member of a happy marriage of 10 years.
'And while you are quite a charmer,
Mademoiselle,' he added by way of consolation, 'and while indeed ten years ago you
may have stolen my heart, I truly love my

wife.'

'But I have seen your work, my dear
Monet,' I protested, 'and I am certain that
you are too free a spirit to be confined by
some arbitrary societal convention, such
as that of monogamy. You needn't forget
your wife entirely, but come and see what
bliss we two cultured souls are capable of.'
'My work?,' replied the man, startled.
"Indeed!" I answered. 'Are you not that
fresh flash of brilliance which has lately
blinded the artistic world? Are you not, I
say, that divine C. Monet?'
'My dear,' the man cried, 'I am but a
plumber; and although indeed I bear the
name of the immortal late artist, I have no
talent myself for the craft. And it really is
in poor taste to joke in this way about a
dead soul whose brush and pallet were
active a full century ago.'
"Here the door was shut firmly in my
face. I crept home, sunk in the very abyss
of grief and embarrassment. And I now
write you this letter as I read, in the
Encyclopedia Britannica, of that famed
painter who first stole, and has now broken, my heart. I am
Melancholically, Your loving cousin."

Technological advances can't make up for stale script

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MORGHAN HOLT

mholtl@swarthmore.edu

Animation ain't what it used to
be. It's so much better that it's

hard to imagine what will develop
to replace the current standards.
black-and-white,
From
the

delayed-motion, poorly dubbed
Mickey Mouse flicks of the early
fifties to the muted-color reels of
the original Johnny Quest to the
Technicolor thrill of Scooby-Doo to
Pixar's 3-D rendering of animated
insects in "A Bug's Life," animated
films have definitely come a long
way. Technological innovation in
film production and computer science have improved both characters and scenery alike. Too bad
these amazing advancements don't
automatically seep over into animated films' scripts.
Even in its previews, when my
daughter and I first caught wind

of its release, "Ice Age" was pretty

amazing, at least aurally and visually. The 15-minute interlude was
completely gripping with its computer-generated, surround sound,
fast-moving glaciers. The eye
candy was incredible. Animated
pictures, I thought then, are getting unbelievably realistic.
The preview won me over.

When my four and three-quarter
year old protested my movie picks,
complaining that she was tired of
watching "adult" movies and that
she really, really wanted to see
"Ice Age," I only briefly argued.

Whatever, I thought; the preview
looked decent.
Little did I know that, although
the animation was intense in its 3D realism and the surround sound
were also pretty impressive, 20th
Century Fox's vast improvements
in the animated presentation
would not even come close to making up for its nearly absent script.
When will Hollywood learn that
eye candy isn't everything? At
least Mickey Mouse was relatively
entertaining.

After my initial astonishment
at the realistically moving blocks
of icy snow and the independently
moving hairs on the mammoth's
large back, I began to roll my eyes
and shift in my seat. The dialogue
was forced and tedious. The plot
was incomprehensible and far
from fluid at most points. The
characters were templated, nearfacsimiles of the main characters

from "Shrek": the ever-jabbering
Donkey and Shrek himself. For an
hour and 25 minutes, I sat and
groaned at the utter lack of any-

Courtesy Fox movies

thing resembling originality or
anything remotely engaging about
the characters' interactions (even
as their eyes actually well up with
tears). The animation itself was
intense, but it sure didn't make up
for the fact that "Ice Age" wasn't
about anything, except some cool
chunks of cracking ice, a random
squirrel-looking thing obsessed
with an acorn, a large mammoth
grumpy for reasons never fully
disclosed, a sloth whose incessant
jabbering bordered on the annoyance of Jar Jar Binks, a lost
human infant and a scheming
saber-tooth. The connectivity was
nil; every lead into something of

substance was lost on imagery.
"Oh, brave new world," my
incensed friend muttered as we
walked out, "that has such movies
in it." As we left the theater, my
daughter exclaimed excitedly in
front of us how totally cool the
movie had been. My daughter really liked "Ice Age." And she's not
dumb. But the movie was. She just
wasn't able to distinguish between
the amazing effects of the animation and the awful, awful script.
Or maybe she just didn't care.
Maybe she's so used to getting one
or the other that she was totally
satisfied with the tradeoff. Which
speaks volumes about the current

state of the entertainment industry (non-animated movies I've
seen lately seem to be only slightly less pandering to their adult
audience than "Ice Age" was to its
younger viewers).
Evolution could have been a big
part of the "Ice Age" story, or
maybe something sort of historical, or maybe (gasp) something
actually born of the imaginations
of the creative-writing analog of

the animation masterminds.
It's always baffling to me to
check the box office scores after
having seen a dreadfully dismal
film just to find that the same dis-

aster is at the top (as in the case of
"Ice Age," second only to "Panic
Room"). Hollywood doesn't seem
to notice the discrepancy between
visual content and actual substance.
But it isn't entirely Hollywood's
fault that the discrepancy remains,
since the audiences apparently
don't mind, either. As I listened to
my child chatter gleefully about
the wonderment of "Ice Age," I
cringed. If Hollywood isn't made to
realize that the films it's producing are utterly vapid, if Hollywood
isn't forced to produce worthwhile,
engaging entertainment, if audiences continue to numbly ingest

contrived emotion, stale stories,
and mind-blowing but superficial
special effects, we are just
moments from Huxley's greatest
fears. I've seen too many movies

lately that hinge entirely on visual, computer-animated effects,
allowing for too much contrivance,
far too pre-packaged plots. I want
something original. I don't simply
want to be entertained by movement on the screen; I want to be
entertained by movement in my
mind, my heart. I want movies
that are more than the latest

cyber-tech novelty. Is that too
much to ask?

Eels' newest is
'life-affirming'
'Souljacker' balances 'scantily clad
dirty rock' with emotional confession
BY MATT RUBIN

mrubinl@swarthmore. edu
From the first crunchy fat chord
of the Eels' "Souljacker," you know
this is an album with some serious
personality. And from the liner
notes, you know that eccentric Eels
frontman E thinks so, too; the
back of the package declares
"Souljacker" the "encyclopedia of
love" and the "Magna Carta of Rock,"
among other things.
EELS
However, this album is great precisely because it is not the "hardest
Souljacker
rocking substance known to man."
Dreamworks,
E, whom producer and multi-instrumentalist John Parrish (of P.J.
2001
Harvey fame) joins here, has conRating:
structed an album with all the attitude of hard rock ("like a rock baking
in the desert sun") set to a profoundly subtle emotional backdrop. I have to admit that lines like "You little punks think you own this town" make this album great for dancing around the Worth courtyard in nothing but a pair of CK boxers
while using an old Norelco to destroy your stubble, smooth skin, and

8/10

all standards of decency simultaneously. But this paradise of scantily-clad dirty rock is periodically interrupted by terse emotional confessions with a creative and nuanced instrumentation of countless
well-honed and varying synthesizer tones, lush but tactful brass, and

quirky percussion.

Thematically, this is an album about the
affirmation of life and the discarding of
past fixations with depression.
This is also the perfect album to listen to while living domestically with your girlfriend, unless, of course, your girlfriend is not currently talking to you, in which case it's the perfect album to listen to
in order to remember why it's the perfect album to listen to while living domestically with your girlfriend. Yeah. From the clunky, rollicking dropped-D grooves on both "That's Not Really Funny" and
"Souljacker Part I" to the light and atmospheric but slightly dysphoric pop of "Friendly Ghost," this album moves your booty at just
the right rhythm for cooking a budget meal and drying the dishes.
But it's also got several poignant, sentimental numbers interspersed,
particularly "Woman Driving, Man Sleeping" and "World of Shit,"
that ring wildly true in their straightforward simplicity, paving the
way for tenderly real embraces in between ketchup stains.
Thematically, this is an album about the affirmation of life and
the discarding of past fixations with depression, about asserting
your love for life and pursuing it. On "Friendly Ghost," E sings, "If
you're scared to die, you better not be scared to live." This is a far
cry from lyrics on his older albums, such as the line "Waking up is
harder when you want to die," from 1998's cathartic masterpiece
"Electro-Shock Blues" or any of the lyrics from the Eels' one huge
hit, "Novocain."
As always, E is conscious of the contrast in his work, letting his
listeners know on "Bus Stop Boxer" that he is now over the problems of his earlier catalogue and ready to live: "I don't miss where
/ When I wake up in the morning / I'm too tired /
I came from
And tired of being alone / So I get up and go downtown / And pick
me up a little piece of ground / Where I can prove something to the
world."
E has finally moved on, clearly seeing himself reformed, ready
to set out and conquer life using the power of rock. And, indeed,
when you can write such simple, touching lyrics as, "In this world
of shit / Baby you are it," life has already been conquered, if by life
you mean any girl's heart. It's the ability to write lines that perfect
that gives E the right to sing my favorite line on the album (and the
one that most applies to my life): "I'm the man, baby I am the man."

double for former turntablist DJ
Rek. The group was impressed, and
the substitute, now known as Still,
became a permanent member.

hip-hop wunderkind, is said to put

There's no other way to say it:
The Parsons Dance Company is
one of the coolest modern dance

companies today.
This weekend, the company
brings the world premiere of "Too
Many Cooks" to the University of
Pennsylvania's
Annenberg
Theater. "Too Many Cooks" is set
to music by Mexican composer
Juan Garcia Esquivel
and, in a
rare event, the music this weekend will be performed live.
The company will perform
Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday at 8
p.m. and Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.

There is a student discount of $5
off the regular ticket price; however, if you go to the box office with
your student ID, you can buy your
tickets there for only $l5. And
trust me, it's worth it.

Mixed results for
men's lacrosse
BY JUSTIN KANE

Despite its best efforts to keep
Saturday's contest against No. 11
Western
Maryland
close,
the
Swarthmore men's lacrosse team fell
victim to the Green Terror's explosive
offense, losing 19-5.

The Garnet Tide (0-2 Centennial
Conference, 5-5 overall) kept themselves
within striking distance throughout the
first half and went into halftime only
four goals back, 7-3. But the Green
Terror, led by All-American attackers
Tom Brown and Joe Ellis, overwhelmed
the Tide defense in the second half.
The Garnet managed to keep Western
Maryland in check early, as Brown sat
on the bench in the first half. Attacker
Jeff Donlea 'O5 and midfielders John
Murphy 'O3 and Tim Chryssikos 'O5 each
scored, providing just enough offense to
bolster Garnet hopes for a second-half
comeback.

But when Brown entered the game in
the second half, the Garnet Tide suddenly found themselves overmatched.
Brown, who broke the Centennial
Conference career goal-scoring record
in the game, tallied six goals in an eightminute midway through the second half,
shooting down any hopes of a
Swarthmore comeback.
With that, the floodgates were open.
Brown's barrage triggered a 12-goal second half for Western Maryland, including nine in the fourth quarter. Brown
added two assists to his six goals, and
his teammate Ellis notched two goals
and dished out four assists. Attacker
Justin Merson also contributed three
goals to the Green Terror onslaught.

The offensive pace was too much for
the Swarthmore offense to match, as the
Tide could only muster goals from
Donlea and midfielder Tom Coughlin
'O5. Donlea and captain Blake Atkins 'O2
each added an assist, as well.
Last Wednesday, however, the Garnet
Tide set the offensive pace, defeating
York College 13-10. Behind the attacking
midfield play of Atkins and the offense
of Joseph DeSimone 'O4, Swarthmore
opened up a 5-1 lead midway through the
second quarter.
But York was a persistent opponent,
and the Spartans' star attacker, Scott
Hermes, kept the team in the game with
three goals in the first half, including a
pair snuck in minutes before halftime.
The second half played out like a mirror image of the first, with Swarthmore,
paced by Murphy, racing out to a 12-7
lead. With 6:48 left in the game, York's
offense finally began clicking, and the
Spartans tallied three quick goals to
mount a comeback in the final minutes.
It wasn't until the Tide scored their final
goal with 30 seconds left that the game
was out of reach.
The Swarthmore defenders had their
hands full with Hermes, who scored six
goals. But the Tide countered with the
midfield duo of Atkins, who had three
goals and two assists, and Murphy, who
scored four goals and gave out one
assist.

The Garnet Tide now turn toward
their first legitimate opportunity to win
a Centennial Conference game, facing
Dickinson this weekend at 3 p.m. Before
No. 11 Western Maryland, the Tide's
only conference matchup had been
against No. 2 Gettysburg. The team has

0-3 Centennial road
trip toughens Tide
Women's lax opens Centennial schedule
with losses to No. 15 F&M, No. 10 Gettysburg
BY KATHRYN JANTZ
kjantzl@swarthmore.edu

Washington, the game showcased two quality teams that were evenly matched.
Swarthmore began with a 5-1 lead, and

The Swarthmore women's lacrosse
team is down but not out. After going 0-3 on
the week against three of the top four
teams in the Centennial Conference, the
team still hopes to move into the top four
to qualify for the conference tournament.

than Swarthmore have yet to play the top

Brainard 'O3 brought Swarthmore to a 5-1

The Garnet women suffered a crushing
loss to No. 15 F&M last Wednesday, losing
17-7. Although Mavis Biss 'O2 scored four
goals and Katie Tarr 'O2 scored three, they
could not overcome the strong F&M
offense. With the rash of cancelled games,
the contest was the first time for the
Garnet to adjust to the high level of play
that is so predominate in the conference.
"The F&M game provided us with a
challenge we had not yet seen this season."
tri-captain Tarr said. "It showed us both
our strengths and what we need to
work on."
No. 10 Gettysburg proved to be just as
much of a test on Saturday. Coming off of
their Centennial-opener, the Tide started
out with a bang when Tarr opened the contest by scoring off a free position. But the
Bullets responded with a goal of their own
18 seconds later. After a tight 15 minutes,
Gettysburg scored three in a row. Though
the Tide played to the bitter end, the
Bullets 10-0 run across the intermission left
the Garnet little chance to stage a comeback. Mariam Levy 'O2 tallied the lone
Garnet goal in the second half.
Jenn Hart 'O3 made thirteen saves in
goal to surpass Christy Turtzo ('9l-'92) on
the Swarthmore career saves list. Hart finished the week with 261 career saves, good
for the No. 5 spot.
"I think Jenn Hart is a gem," Biss said.
"Her ability to control where she is mentally makes her a consistently good player."
While the Tide were not expected to win
either game, the one-two punch of nationally ranked teams gave the team a chance
to raise their play to the next level for the

Garnet, but Washington scored the final
three goals of the game to finish 12-9.
Between the pipes, Hart had 15 saves.
What sets the Washington loss apart
from the previous two of the week is the
level of play. "We are definitely improving
on a lot of things." Tarr said. "We just made
some mistakes that were costly and that
Washington took advantage of."
According to Tarr, these three games
marked an improvement in midfield play.
The team is starting to connect more in
terms of throwing and catching and has
improved at seeing the open play on the
field. The team's main flaws have been a
few costly mental lapses, but each game is
a little bit better than the last.
Tarr is three goals away from the conference career scoring record. Lindsey
Carey 'OO holds the current record of 217.
The current record is 217 goals, and Tarr is
up to 214 goals. The question is whether
Tarr will score those goals today against
Widener or whether the record will faU vs.
Dickinson on Saturday.
"I think the most amazing thing about
Tarr breaking the record is that we still
have a significant number of games left,"
Biss said. "She's not going to narrowly eek

teams in the conference.

Though the women lost 12-9 to

advantage. Washington staged a late firsthalf run to bring the Shorewomen within
one. After the break, Washington took
advantage of a flat-footed Garnet defense to
score two quick goals.
Biss tied the game at 6-6 halfway
through the second half, but Washington
scored three times in quick succession to
pull ahead 9-6. Kim Cariello 'O2, Biss and
Tarr all scored to tie the game at 9-9 in an
attempt to bring the game back to the

it out, she's going to be substatnially
above it."
Now 0-3 in the conference, the Tide
heads into the heart of the season with
high hopes of a playoff berth.
"Our next couple weeks are the crucial
part of the season." Tarr said. "Everything
helping
counts towards
us make

the playoffs."
After the cancellation of the March 20
College of Notre Dame of Maryland game,
the Tide's home opener will be today at 4
p.m. against cross-town rival Widener.
The game will be the first of a two game
home stay before the team heads to Cedar

has been coming up huge."
"If he doesn't have that game, we probably lose to
Washington," tri-captain Scott Kushner 'O2 said of his
teammate.

Kushner thinks Swarthmore is a better team than it
has shown in series-opening losses to Washington,
Dickinson, and Ursinus. "We were the better team
[Tuesday], but score-wise they came out on top," he said.
"We outplayed a worse team but managed to cough it up
in the end."
Kushner said the same thing happened in Saturday's
loss to Dickinson. The Garnet tied that game at 5-5 in the
seventh inning only to give up four runs in the eighth, losing 9-5 to an inferior ball club.
Tuesday's loss to Ursinus may have been tougher to
swallow. Led by Corso and King, the Garnet built a 5-0 lead
with runs in the first, third and fifth innings. But in the

22

bottom of the fifth, the Bears posted six runs, five
unearned, and never looked back in their 9-5 victory.
"We had a lapse in pitching," said Goldstein, who
pitched four shutout innings before experiencing some
problems in the fifth. "My arm was a little fatigued, and
there were definitely some calls in the fifth inning that
could have gone either way. But that's not an excuse for
what happened. The pitching staff didn't uphold its end of

the bargain today."
"He was having some trouble throwing strikes, but the
umpire was really squeezing the strike zone on him," Ryan
Chahrour 'O4 said. Goldstein also pitched on less than
three days' rest.

Regardless, it was clear that the Tide had outplayed the
Bears. Swarthmore had 15 hits to Ursinus' four. But the
Tide gave 16 bases to the Bears, walking 12 and hitting six
batsmen. Ultimately, that was enough to cost Swarthmore
the game.
Though the team remains somewhat inconsistent
defensively, it has been strong at the plate since entering
April 4, 2002

conference play. The Tide have put extra time into batting
practice since returning from their spring break trip to
Florida, and the work has paid off.
"The offense has changed," Chahrour said. "We started
getting production from the entire lineup and timely base
hits with people on base." Kushner added that the offense
will be even better once he, King and Ryan Pannorfi 'O4,
the first three hitters in the lineup, start hitting to their
potential.
If the Garnet can work out some defensive kinks, they
stand an excellent chance of making the playoffs. Last
year, teams with a .500 record qualified for the postseason,
and the Garnet are on pace for that record if they continue
to split their series. "We're looking at 9-9 or better" to
make the playoffs, Kushner said.
Swarthmore hosts Ursinus on Saturday, and James
Zvokel 'O4 likely will get the start. Zvokel (1-1) won his first
decision of the season in last Friday's 7-6 win over
Washington. "He's a solid presence on the mound,"
Goldstein said. "We know we can win behind him."

coach Mullan sees something special in his number-one singles player.
When I asked coach
Mullan about Thomas on
Tuesday, a warm smile
washed over his face.
"John is definitely a
great leader," Mullan said. "He's really
enthusiastic about the game."

Thomas began playing tennis in his
home state of Georgia when he was 11
years old. In a few years, Thomas was
ranked 15th in the South and was travelling as far away as Arkansas to play in
national tournaments. By the time he was
a high school senior, several elite colleges
had begun to recruit him, including
Swarthmore.
"Coach Mullan is the reason I came
here," Thomas said. "He's so interested in
you as a person."
Since then, Thomas has brought his
game to a new level by working on his technique with the coaching staff, including
coach Mullan and former assistant coach
Chris "Wheels" Pearson.
"I've worked on my volleys and really
improved my net game a lot," said Thomas,
who is the 48th-ranked singles player in
Div. 111. "Coach Mullan emphasizes attacking the net and pressuring your opponent."
"His game is much more complete now,"

said. "The guys look
up to me, and I try to

inspire them."

Goldsmith

has

helped Thomas work
on leadership skills
"Mike's taught me
the
mentality ol
being
a leader,'
Thomas said. "I try to
be vocal on the court and motivate guys."
Since Thomas' captaincy, the team has
raced off to one of its best starts in recent
memory, defeating six straight Div. I opponents before succumbing to Div. II powerhouse UC Davis 8-L Since then, however,
the team has dropped two straight Div. 11l
matches to 20th-ranked Mary Washington
6-1 and 17th-ranked Washington and Lee 43, putting the team in jeopardy of missing
the nationals. "They take seven teams from
our region," Mullan said. "We're right on

the borderline."
The past two matches have been particularly frustrating for Thomas, who has had
to succeed two-time All-American Pete
Schilla 'Ol as the number one singles player
on the team. After splitting the first two sets
with his opponents, Thomas has lost both of
his final sets 4-6.
"I can't let that happen," he said. "If I
win my match, we win. The blame goes to
me if it goes to anybody."
"John is a great number one, he's just
been facing some tough competition,"

John Thomas leads the Garnet in a contest over spring break. Behind Thomas' leadership, Swarthmore has dispatched six Div. I teams and is closing in on a nationals berth.
Mullan said.
Thomas, however, doesn't make any

excuses for himself. "Honestly, I'm playing
the same guys I've played before. I could
have handled it better and played tougher,"
Thomas said.
With the team sitting "squarely on the
bubble," all of the upcoming matches will
be important for the team.
"We need to bring intensity to every
game," Thomas said. "We're so close to
qualifying for the national tournament."
For Thomas, this season will be probably be the last of his playing career. When
he graduates, Thomas plans to move on to

coaching tennis. He's already accepted a
high school coaching job in Taiwan next
year.

According to coach Mullan, Thomas
will make a terrific coach. "He's a great

teacher. He's so enthusiastic about the
game, and he'll inspire others to play well."
"It's nice to see young players pick up
and see things," Thomas said. "I'm beginning to realize a lot, but I'm still an unpolished player [and coach].
"Coach Mullan has been coaching for
thirty years, and he knows so much about
the game," he said. "I still have a long way
to go."

THE PHOENIX

April 4, 2002

Garnet softball has gotten off to a
slow start, dropping its first 12 games
of the season, including four
Centennial Conference matchups.
The trouble started in the season
opener versus the University of the
Sciences, when Swarthmore took the
game into extra innings and built a
one-run lead in the top of the eighth.
But the Garnet allowed two runs in
the bottom of the inning and lost a
heartbreaker.
Since that game, the team has not
worked well offensively. It has
notched just four more runs on the
season despite strong hitting from
third-baseman Katherine

Athanasiades 'O5 and shortstop Pam
Lavallee 'O3. The squad has also had
its fair share of defensive struggles,
making 39 errors in the field as of

April 2.
A main contributor to the team's
start has been its lack of home

games. Of their 12 games, the Garnet
have hosted only four. In addition, the
Garnet has faced a difficult
Centennial Conference schedule; its
first two opponents were first-place
Western Maryland and third-place
Ursinus.
The team will host Widener today
at 4 p.m.

Lose the first game of the series, win the second. That's
been the Garnet Tide's tendency since entering Centennial
Conference play.
Last week, Swarthmore dropped its home opener to
Washington 5-2 only to beat the Shoremen 7-6 two days
later. The Tide then split a doubleheader with Dickinson

last Saturday, winning the second game 7-2. On Tuesday,
the team fell to Ursinus 9-5 after taking a 5-0 lead. The
Garnet hope to salvage a series split when they host

Garnet to their first win of the season. Goldstein's play

"It was an honor," Goldstein said. "But any of the guys
are capable of putting up great hitting games. Joe Corso ['o2]
went 3-for-4 on Saturday afternoon, and Brandon King ['os]

"Hopefully, that trend won't continue," tri-captain Matt
Goldstein 'O4 said. "It probably speaks to the young nature
of the team, but it shows we can rise to the occasion."
Goldstein certainly rose to the occasion in
Swarthmore's 7-6 win over Washington. He posted a 4-for-4
