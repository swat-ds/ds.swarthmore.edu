The deans decide not to rescind offers after concerns about the dorm's racial balance
stolen from
same room
By Brendan Karch
Phoenix Staff
In whathas become a f rustratingly routine theft for Public
Safety and for professors, another video projector was stolen
from Kohlberg 302 this week.
Without any leads or tangible
evidence, Public Safety is essentially in the dark over a series of
four Kohlberg projector thefts in
the last year that have cost the
college upwards of $20,000.
According to Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave, the
$4,000 projector was stolen
sometime between 2:30 p.m.
Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday.
Cleaning staff discovered the
theft, but because they opened
the door with their keys, they
could not verify whether or not
the door was locked. Public
Safety, however, found no signs
offorced entry and all signs point
to an unlocked room.
Redgrave is almost certain
that the thief or thieves used additional hardware to remove the
projector. The bolts that tie down
the projector were sawed
through, said Redgrave, who
added that "someone had to bring
some tools and spend some time"
to steal the projector.
Thompson Bradley, chair of
the Modern Languages and
Literatures Department, has his
own hypothesis based on
Redgrave's evaluation. "My
assumption is it's people who
know what they're doing," said

By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff

Discussion of the lack of diversity of Wharton RAs selected for next year continued
this week, but the deans decided not to break up the group
of RAs already placed there.
One RA position in the dorm remains vacant, however, and the
RA Selection Committeepromises to take race into consideration when making its placement decision.
After last week's Student
Council meeting, at which
BoHee Yoon 'Ol alerted Student
Council to the uneven distribution of RAs of color for next
year, Student Council, the deans
and the RA Selection Committee were left with the task of
remedying a situation that
many feel is regrettable: all the
RAs selected for Wharton,
Dana and Mary Lyon next year
are white.
Yoon feels that the dearth of
RAs of color in those dorms is
unacceptable because they all
house freshmen, a third of
whom are ofcolor and may feel
more comfortable bringing
their concerns to an R A ofcolor.
In response to Yoon's complaint, Student Council scheduled a second meeting for the
following night to discuss their
position on the issue. RA decisions are not under the jurisdiction of Student Council, but SC
Co-Chair Brandon Silverman
'O2 believes that it is reasonable
for SC to be involved in discussion of the issue because the
council's "role is to address student concerns as best as is possible, as well as present an edu-

cated voice on behalfof the student body."
Dean of Students Tedd
Goundie described Student
Council as acting "in an appropriately even-handed way" in
bringing their concerns to his
attention.

SC members never actually
talked to the deans, but they did
exchange e-mails with Goundie,
eventually coming to a consensus on the issue by agreeing
that they trusted the RA Selection Committee. In his letter to
SC, Goundie wrote that the Se-

lection Committee "kept an eye
toward the placement of students of color at all times," but
that after all other factors are
taken into consideration, they
"cannot ensure all buildings
housing first year students will
have students of color as RAs."
SC believes that the RA Selection Committee would like to
see racial diversity among RAs,
but understands that "sometimes it's just not possible without sacrificing another aspect
of the decision that may be
equally as important," explained Silverman.
According to Goundie, the
committee is "very attentive to
issues of diversity," but he believes that such attention includes "choosing students who
can deal with and embrace issues of diversity—qualities not
limited to students of color." He
added that they still recognize
the value of having students of
color in the RA group, both for
their personal experiences and
for themodels that they provide
for students who identify with
them.The committee this year
was aware that three dorms
with freshmen will have no RA
of color, but for other reasons
could not remedy the situation.
Both Goundie and Student
Council cited the limited number of RA applications submitted by students of color as one
reason for the RA imbalance.
Student Council decided to
work on increasing the diversity of the RA applicants for
next year, since the Committee

2 alums win nationwide scholarships for work in Asia
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff

Two Swarthmore alumni,

Quinn Bauriedel

'94

and

Maeghan Maloney '93, havebeen

named asLuce Scholars in a prestigious nationwide competition
whose 18 winners will receive
funding for a ten-month internship in Asia.
"It's a great honor and a really
amazing opportunity," Bauridel
said of the distinction.
Bauriedel and Maloney were
chosen from a pool comprised of
applicants nominated by 67 colleges and universities. Their in-

ternships will begin this August.
Founded in 1974, the Luce
Scholars Program provides financial support for cultural and
intellectual exchange between
America and the countries of the
Asian-Pacific region.
According to the Web site of
the Henry Luce Foundation, "the
program's purpose is to increase
awareness of Asia among future
leaders in American society." In
collaboration with the San Francisco Asia Foundation, the program arranges and funds internships in Asia for young Americans.
Candidates for the award must

be no more than 29 years old.
They must have demonstrated
leadership in their field of choice,
have at least a bachelor's degree
and havelittle knowledge of Asia.
From the nominees who meet
these requirements, the program
selects 45 finalists. Divided into
three groups, the finalists undergo what Bauriedel termed an
"intense eight interview session"
to determine the final 18 winners.
Once chosen, the winners work
with the Asia Foundation to construct an internship suitable to
their personal and professional
interests. The details of the internships of this year's winners

are yet to be determined.
Bauriedel, one of the founders
of the Philadelphia-based Pig
Iron Theatre Company, has little
definite knowledge of what he
will be doing next year, or even
in what country he will be living.
His aspirations include working
with an acrobatic circus, studying with a clown and exploring
traditionalmasked or puppet theatre. Any of these options would
fulfill his ultimate goal which is
to "study theatre in a place where
people really care about theatre,"
Bauriedel said.
Maloney works as a deputy district attorney in Portland, Or-

egon. She could not be contacted
to comment on the details of her
year in Asia.
Once Bauriedel and Maloney
know where they will be sent in
Asia, they will have to begin language lessons, also paid for by
the Luce Scholars Program.
While they do not expect to reach
fluency by August, they will need
to acquire at least rudimentary
communication skills before
their departure.
Bauriedel hopes that he will
return from Asia brimming with
new ideas for Pig Iron. "It's a
place that really inspired a lot of
people I admire," he said.

Freshmen organize new group for
multiracial, multicultural students

'Sincerely,
Robin Mamlet'

By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff
Parrish Parlors rang with
laughter Sunday night as the first
meeting of a new group for multiracial and multicultural students on campus wound down.
The meeting, organized by four
freshmen who identify as multiracial, drew a crowd of 25 students, mostly freshmen and seniors, for Chinese food, talk about
the functionof the group and discussion of personal experiences.
The group's organizers, Laurel
Kean 'O3, Laura Damerville 'O3,
Karly Ford 'O3 and Karima Wilson 'O3, said that they had gone
to some of the already existing
support groups and knew that
they were looking for something
else, a group that would address
some of their unique concerns as
multiracial students. Even
though the four do not share common heritages, they felt they had
"something in common that transcended our particular backgrounds."
They said that they have encountered only support for their
group from students and administrators alike.
Wilson stressed the accepting
nature of the group, saying that
their mission involves "remaining open to anyone, and not excluding anyone." They are especially reaching out to students

whose families are multiracial or

multicultural, including people

whose parents come from distinct cultural backgrounds, and
children of interracial adoption.
Damerville added that they may
try to incorporate students who
are in multiracial relationships
as well.
At Sunday night's meeting,
which Ford described as "full of
energy," the group discussed
their ideas for the future. Some
students saw the group as political, and some envisioned a more
social entity. They talked about
these different ideas, and tried to
decide whether they wanted to be
a support group or a club. These
issues were not resolved at the
meeting, and the four women
expect that process to take some
time. For now, they are more concerned with "providing a network of support while not becoming too exclusive," according to
Damerville.
They seem to be succeeding in
that mission, judging by the success of the first meeting, and the
personal feedback that its organizers have received from interested students. "People were so
enthusiastic," said Kean. "The
consensus seemed to be that we
were filling the void." Wilson
agreed, adding that many of the
seniors who came to the meeting
had thought about starting a similar group at some point, but had

never managed to, and were
pleased that freshmen were taking the initiative.
After the business part of the
meeting, most freshmen decided
to stay afterwards to share their
answers to the question: "When
was the first time you were multiracial?" They laughed with
each other about standardized
forms that would not accept their
identity, angry notes they
scribbled on test answer sheets
and teachers who considered it
their business to definetheir students' race when it was not immediately clear. They told stories
of people making assumptions
about their racial identities,
treating them as exotic and, of
course, asking that dreaded question: "What are you?"
As the multiracial freshmen
agreed, the answer to that question is rarely simple, and it never
boils down to simple recital of
racial components.
They all seemed to view being
multiracial as a positive aspect
of their identities, despite the
occasional difficulties. Proud of
who they are, the students at the
meeting enjoyed the camaraderie they found with each other.
"In Birmingham, I was the only
only," explained Wilson. "Now is
the first time I've ever been
around other people like me besides my family, and it's a really
powerful experience."

Bradley, who added that, "It seems like it may well
be the same people." He even suggested that "the
people who are doing this may have access or have
a key."
An ad hoc committee on technology issues has
touched on the issue of technology protection. Most
rooms stacked with computers or other expensive
equipment are also equipped with alarms or cardswipe access, but Redgrave said that such protection for rooms with projectors would be costly and
would severely limit student access.
"There are always ways to protect things," said
Redgrave. "I could protect the whole campus, but
no one would have access to anything."
Kohlberg often stays unlocked until late in the
evening so students can use the building, and even
when it is eventually locked, students are often still
inside studying, commented Redgrave.
Bradley said that, "It's quite dispiriting, if nothing else." Two projectors were comissioned to be
bought for the department two years ago, and so
far the department has seen one of its projectors
stolen once and the other one stolen three times.
Bradley added, "We will try to replace the projector [again,]" but neither Bradley nor Redgrave
knew the exact origin of funds or the timetable for

However, it remains obvious that without a
change in policy or extra lockdown protection, the
projectors will be just as vulnerable to thieves.
"They've been successful twice," said Bradley,
"and I suspect they will continue to try."

tional number of RA applicants
who are students of color.
Although Yoon originally
hoped that some RA dorm placements would be rescinded and reissued in a manner more sensitive to race, the deans vetoed
such an action. Goundie informed SC that they "will not
take away anyone's appointment,
and we will not force anyone to
move from the placement they
have been offered."
One student offered an RA
placement in Wharton has declinedthe position, which may be
offered to an RA of color on another hall, with an alternate being placed in that RA's original
position. Goundie would not guarantee that the committee, which
will meet later this week, would
choose this course of action, but
he did promise that "the committee will give this issue the careful consideration it deserves."
Considering the current situation, Yoon conceded that bringing one RA of color from the
other side of campus to fill the
Wharton vacancy would help
"balance it out." She believes that
by advocating greater RA diversity she is representing the opinion of many students on campus;
she has received only positive
feedback from students who
thank her for calling attention to
the issue.
"This is the tip of the iceberg,"
asserted Yoon. "This is just more
evidence that the RA selection
needs to be worked on." She said
that the deans are discussing
ways to make the RA program
more attractive to students who
are on financial aid and do not
have a financial incentive to
serve as RAs.
Yoon, Goundie and Silverman
are all glad that the topic is being discussed and thatthere may
be a possibility of having an RA

now, though, they are looking

Seeking balance
In questioning the diversity and distribution of RA
appointments, BoHee Yoon 'Ol has definitely done the
college a good deed. There is the obvious: she has
pointed out an unfortunate situation that may inadvertently lead to the suffering of some students. This is
undoubtedly a good thing.
Although her questioning has not resulted in a major
change of RA placements (and understandably so it
would be unjust to forcibly rescind a placement offer),
it has brought to the college's attention issues in the RA
appointments process. The authority and influence of an
RA is substantial, and for this reason balance is important. Race, gender, sexual orientation, class year and
even general interests should all be considered during
the selection and placement processes to yield a group
of RAs that reflects the balance of Swarthmore at large.
At the same time, Yoon's concerns have breached the
larger question of balance in the Swarthmore community. Theoretically, general-interest organizations with
open or representative memberships should roughly
reflect the composition of the community. In practice,
few do Student Council (as of the beginning of this
semester) is only 25 percent female and an even smaller
percentage minority, and The Phoenix Editorial Board,
while over half female, is less than 20 percent minority.
Female or minority Student Council co-chairs and
editors in chief are even rarer.
What should be done, if anything, to correct this
imbalance? No matter how the question is approached,
there is no simple and straightforward answer. Perhaps
Student Council, The Phoenix, the RA Selection Committee and other groups should more aggressively seek out
interested and qualified females and minorities, or
perhaps these institutions should simply make themselves more attractive and comfortable to all people.
Whatever is done, it should be done with an eye to
caution and an interest in fairness. Sometimes we, as
individuals and as groups, overestimate the strength of
our community and forget that imbalances are a mark
of increasing entropy.

Minors a major idea
Under current college policy, students not participating in the Honors program can include a double major
or a concentration in their academic plans in addition to
the one required major. It is a flexible if confusing
system, but it is missing one element of flexibility that
many other colleges offer: a course minor. Now, the
Council on Educational Policy is considering allowing
minors on an optional basis. Giving non-Honors students that option is an idea whose time has come.
Few students are likely to disapprove of a proposal
that increases their academic options, but the encouraging news is that faculty seem supportive as well.
One thing faculty are concerned about, though, is
sacrificing breadth for depth. Under the CEP's current
thinking, the addition of minors would be combined with a
so-called "major plus one" requirement, meaning students
could choose to pursue a double major, a major and a
concentration, a major and a minor or just simply one
major but no more than a major and one other program.
Students should begin thinking about whether they
believe such a requirement is fair and begin talking to
faculty members if they think it is not, but changing
faculty opinions now would probably be an uphill battle.
Although instituting the "major plus one" requirement
would compromise the plans of some students, the
faculty's feeling on this issue is, it seems, probably
right. Pursuing more than two programs for a degree is
tough, and devoting so much time and energy to just a
few academic areas leaves less for the variety of
courses that make up part of a Swarthmore liberal arts
education. So while limiting some students' flexibility to
pursue more than two programs is not ideal, we think
if it comes down to it that would be an acceptable
price to pay to get minors for everyone else.

LETTERTOT -IE EDITOR

Column distorts conservative views
To the Editor:
Dann Naseemullah's most recent column ("Common
Senseless," Opinions, pg. 8, March 16) goes a long way
toward supporting the claims made by Common Sense
namely, that Swarthmore is diverse when it comes
to everything but conservative viewpoints.
Conservative viewpoints are not accepted at
Swarthmore. I have been in many classroom discussions where conservative viewpoints were most definitely frowned upon and discouraged, and I am not
alone in perceiving this. I have seen students not speak
their mind, and I have seen students say what they
think their liberal classmates and professors want to
hear. I have done so myself.
Naseemullah does not ask why it is that conservatives feel their views are not welcome on campus, and
he does not ask what the campus can do to provide a
more comfortable atmosphere for the free exchange
ofideas. No, Naseemullah says that conservative complaint about this atmosphere is "dangerous in that it
stops any real discussions of virtue from occurring."
Naseemullah's evidence that this complaint limits
discussions of virtue is Dave Thomas' article on his
semester at George Washington University. If one
goes by Naseemullah's presentation of it, Thomas'
article truly does sound outrageous. But essentially
all Thomas' article really said was that there's a very
different world out there
where people are more
grounded in reality, where there is a significant and
visible Republican presence and where people care
about getting practical skills in addition to working
theories. Thomas reminded us that Swarthmore can
often be a self-enclosed bubble and that we should
realize that there is something to be said for other
types of college educations.
"I am not looking to make a lot of money or have a
lot of power through Dave's 'practical knowledge,'"
responds Naseemullah, his words dripping with confidence in his superior morality, to Thomas' relatively
innocuous point. "I want to be a good and virtuous
person, who has the knowledge and ability to do the
right thing." If Naseemullah resorts to this demeaning tone over a critique of the Swarthmore bubble, is
it any wonder that conservatives feel embattled at

Swarthmore?
As for Joon Suk Choi's characterization of School of
the Americas protesters as sheep, I agree with
Naseemullah that this is insulting to supporters of that
noble cause. Yet this treatment is not so differentfrom
what conservative students encounter daily in
Swarthmore classes. If you do not blame U.S. imperialism for half the world's ills and globalization and capitalism for the other half, expect to be attacked as naive and
foolish. Your views will be considered no more than a
repetition of the lies of governments and corporations,
and your position seen as untenable and either ignored
or mocked.
I consider myself open-minded. I am a Diversity Coalition Dialogues facilitator. I supported John McCain for
president, and I now support Al Gore. I am on both the
Swarthmore Progressive Action Committee and the College Republican mailing lists, because they both provide
valuable information. I think that an open political debate is the only way that we can understand the complexity of the issues facing us. At Swarthmore, however,
the debate is too often closed to conservatives.
Naseemullah could have received the conservative
complaint and addressed it constructively. Instead, by
mischaracterizing the articles in Common Sense and
equating these conservative viewpoints with a "misleading and dangerous" restriction of real discussion of virtue, he has made himself part of the problem.

Wharton

should have minority RAs

By BoHeeYoon
For The Phoenix
Last TAiesday, I spoke at the open mic portion of the Student
Council meeting to express my concern about there being no
RAs of color in Wharton next year.
Why am I causing such a ruckus? What's the big deal? Well,
the RA list is extremely symbolic for me. In all of Dana,
Hallowell and Wharton, there will be just two RAs of color
out of 17. All two will live in Hallowell. That's an entire side
of the campus with just two RAs of color. On the other hand,
Willets, Mertz and Worth will have a combined seven RAs of
color out of 16. Palmer, Pittenger and Roberts will house three
RAs of color out of five. Most on-campus RAs will be fairly
well-integrated, except for Wharton and Dana.
Some question the importance of having an RA of color, but I
can't stress it enough. I remember coming to Swat as a frosh
and not having any access to an RA of color in my dorm. I never
thought about it or ever felt it was important. There came a
time, however, when I began talking more and more to an RA of
color in the neighboring building because I realized that, while I
got along well and connected well with others, there were questions I had as a frosh about student life and being Asian-American at Swat. Since I, like the majority of students of color, had
not participated in the Tri-Co program and did not attend
Swarthmore Asian Organization (SAO) meetings, I did not have
a network or support system where I could take my questions. I
didn't want to advertise my questions, so it meant a lot to me
that I had a trustworthy authority figure physically near me
who could provide some answers without needing to seek an
outside figure.
The point is, the need arises. It really does. As a current RA,
I understand and acknowledge the fact that RAs are trained to
work together and to approach each other for advice if we do
not have all the answers for our hallmates. I have no doubt in
my mind that every RA can handle questions on diversity and
can ask other RAs for help if they need it, but the initial questions may never be asked if our hallmates feel a white RA can
neither speak from experience nor have any direct answers. If
Wharton, which houses the more frosh than every dorm except Willets, does not have any RAs of color, that really limits
the avenues that frosh of color may take.
Just as dorms and halls are gendered so that all students will
have access to an RA who is of the same sex, the same policy
should be followed for race. For example, I can't even begin to
imagine having to tell my senior male RA as a frosh that I had
clogged the toilet by attempting to flush my tampon down the
drain. Can you? That's why I get knocks on my door from women
who live on other floors in Hallowell because there are certain situations in which onZy a female RA can be of any use.
Sure, any number of male RAs can approach me on tampon
etiquette, but will any female frosh actually approach them
with such questions? I know my example is making you cringe,
but I'm sure the females who have no access to a female RA
and have lived through this are doubled over with the memories.
As an RA of color, I also get knocks on my door from people
(especially frosh) from all floors regarding racial and cultural differences between roommates and questions about
support groups and my experiences as a student of color. I

|Hiblic

The Clinton
legacy

know that I'm seen as a resource for those who don't necessarily have any other avenues. I acknowledge that there are
certain situations in which only an RA of color will be approached, regardless of a white RAs ability to handle the problem.
I'm not saying the committee purposefully kept RAs of color
out of certain dorms. In fact, I know the committee actually
talked about the lack of diversity in these dorms during the
deliberation process. The committee did not, however, take
any direct actions to address these concerns. I agree that the
teams which were agreed upon were carefully thought out,
but certainly one or two teams could have been changed once
the issue arose. The committee placed having certain teams
of RAs above providing a diversity of RAs in dorms. We need
to strike a balance. Having just one RA to whom I could relate when I was a frosh made all the difference in the world.
It did not matter to me whether or not he got along with the
other RAs, since he provided a service I could not find elsewhere without seeking a stranger. The fact is, no frosh in Dana,
Mary Lyons, or Wharton will be able to talk to an RA of color
to discuss such issues without walking outside and choreographing a meeting.
But the lack of RA diversity in dorms for next year is merely
one example of the problems with the RA Selection Committee. In the long run, we as a student body need to address the
lack of incentive for students on financial aid to be RAs and
the lack of diversity within the applicant pool.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Common Sense authors disrespectful

To the Editor:
"Too often, the more liberal students [at
Swarthmore] will insist on arguing with
professors rather than pausing to think
about what reasoning the professor was
usmg. And they waste my valuable class
time." —Anonymous Republican, in the recent issue of Common Sense.
This Common Sense contributor opted not
to take responsibility for his or her article,
but that's understandable. If I had authored
such a patently offensive comment, I would
seek the protection of anonymity too.
The Republican publication Common
Sense was cited by its founder as a way to
provide an open and friendly forum for
conservative views." Open? Yes. Friendly?
Not even close. Despite the repeated complaint that Republicans at Swarthmore are
a marginalized minority suffering at the
hands of narrow-mindedand intolerant liberals, almost everyarticle in Common Sense
was condescending and arrogant in stance.
While the Common Sense contributors
claim to be closed off from true debate
...

DAN KOROBKIN

by opinionated and self-righteous liberals
who attack Republicans simply because
of their political beliefs, I would like to
offer another explanation. Maybe, just
maybe, it is not the political views of the
Common Sense authors that Swatties find
offensive; maybe it is their attitudes.
If there is one thing that Swatties seem
to love to do, it is to debate everything under the sun. And there is generally adequate representation for either side of an
issue; few Swatties can be easily catego-

rized as "liberal" or "conservative" in their
diverse views. Furthermore, when I personally voiced my support for the removal
of pre-frosh weekend, I was challenged and
debated, but I received no animosity from
anyone. But maybe that's because I, unlike
the Republicans, have respect for the opposing view, and the intelligence of the
people who offer it.

Political journalism tip: When a lameduck president stops doing anything constructive while in office, begin referring
to his "legacy."
The 22nd Amendment prohibits presidents from running for a third term, but
many of us would like to think that presidents can have an influence on American
politics which persists beyond their tenure
in the Oval Office. What is Bill Clinton's?
For sure, his impeachment will have lasting impact. Thepost-Clinton presidency will
have no immunity from public scrutiny over
private behavior. Executive privilege will
not protect the president from private torts,
and public opinion will not protect him (or
her) from a vindictive Congress.
But President Clinton was elected to
replace an incumbent and thenre-elected
for a second term, and it wasn't for nothing. Pundits speak of the Clinton legacy
in the positive sense because he reshaped
American politics to adapt to a conservative retrenchment, the era of globalization, and the post-Cold War world.
Clinton's rise to the presidency ensured
the survival of the Democratic Party at a
time when American voters were becoming increasingly concerned by rising crime,
ballooning deficits of "big" government, and
a domestic economy which seemed to be
losing ground to the rest of the world. Enter the Democratic Leadership Council,
which resolved to reshape the Democratic
platform to embrace more conservative
crime-fightingpolicies, a balanced budget,
and free trade in a globalized economy.
"New Democrats" like Bill Clinton and Al
Gorebecame legitimate candidates by staking out the middle ground.
Suddenly, the debate was not tax-andspend versus no-new-taxes. According to
the New Democrats, globalization was
upon us whether we liked it or not, and if
America wanted to compete in the "new
economy" it had to open its markets, educate and re-train its workers to regain
their skill premium, and balance its budget to keep interest rates down. Government should spend money primarily
where it can generate returns to its investments, such as job training and welfareto-work programs. The New Democrats
remained liberal on social issues such as
abortion, and they told voters they
wouldn't have to choosebetween a healthy
economy and a responsive government.
In foreign policy, Clinton faced an opportunity to redefine America's place in a onesuperpowerworld. As thenumber of smallscaleethnic conflicts went up and the number of vital, globally significant crises went
down, the Clinton administration developed a new pick-and-choose doctrine of
foreign intervention, exerting its influence
selectively with the hope of maintaining a
comfortable political stability overall.
Now Al Gore and Hillary Clinton are
running for office, trying to lose their
mentor's impeachment baggage but embrace his political message. Will that message endure? Whether they like it or not,
Bill Clinton's legacy is up for referendum
in November, and his "bridge to the 21st
century" lies in the balance.

LETTERS

Lacrosse team's
another morals are

nothing special

Video wars'
new winners
I'm an incurable video game fanatic,
and a bit of news that was released recently excited me to no end.
Microsoft's X-Box, an incredibly powerful home video game console, was revealed to the press last week. More powerful than any other console, it marks a
distinct technological step forward. It also
marks the first foray of one of the world's
largest companies into an elusive yet extremely lucrative market. Microsoft is
going to fail, and here's why.
Nintendo of America is headquartered
right across the street from Microsoft. They
are the video gaming industry's venerable
elder, and they just happen to hate
Microsoft. Vehemently. Microsoft attempted in vain to buy Nintendo. The
Redmond, Wash., neighbors have a rift between them that isall but incurable. You can
bet that every time a hit game is released
on the X-Box, Nintendo will have an even
bigger game set to launch.
Microsoft's Windows CE drives Sega's
Dreamcast, which will be firmly entrenched by the time the X-Box launches.
The X-Box's main draw to developers is the
ease of translation from PC to console,
given that it will run on a modified
Microsoft OS. The Dreamcast already has
this ability and is easy for console-centered
developers to take advantage of as well.
The PC games that will come to X-Box will
invariably also come to Dreamcast, which
will just make the offerings available too
homogenous for buyers.
Sony is, perhaps, the proverbial 800pound gorilla, the guy you don't mess with.
Sony's Play Station is the most successful
system ever, and now the sequel, PS2, rivals, and in some areas surpasses the technological might ofMicrosoft's monster. Almost every developer throughout perpetuity is making a game for the system, and
the addedbenefits of the PS2, such as DVD
support and backward compatibility,
make it the favorite to win these impending "video wars."
The outlook? Here's what I predict:
Nintendo and Sega will drop out of the
hardware manufacturing business. Sega is
a beleaguered company enjoying terrific
success with a system that will soon be incredibly outclassed, out-marketed and outof-date. They make games better than they
do hardware, and they will eventually learn
to stick to it. Nintendo is too proud to simply stop making hardware, but their eternal delays of everything from the system
to the games to the peripherals and lackluster technology will force them to rethink
how they do business.
Sony will become the giant of the hardware industry, with support from both
Nintendo and Sega. Microsoft will enjoy
some support from Sega, but the same
games will most likely be on both the XBox and PS2. It is the console exclusives
that Sony will land in spades that will
prove the testing ground. Microsoft's second-run PC games and versions of other
PS2 games will not draw in the necessary
base to make the platform viable.
It feels so good to prognosticate sometimes. . .

To the Editor:
I would like to address some of the comments made by Kate Nelson-Lee in her
article "Drinking on break a matter of
respect" (Sports, pg. 18, March 16). I was
astounded at how pointless the article was
and by how many ways it managed to offend me. The article put down every student-athlete on the campus who is not a
member of the women's lacrosse team by
saying that they are the only team that
shows "respect and motivation."
Apparently, the coach told the players
before their training trip not to consume
alcohol during the trip, and according to
the article, they followed her orders, due
to their "respect for theircoaches." So, the
women's lacrosse players did not drink for
one week. In the words of the late Chris
Farley, "Whoop-de-frickin-do!" This is not
a pressworthy story. This is barely even
worth mentioning in conversation. Ms.
Nelson-Lee makes it sound as if the entire team should be invited to the White
House and praised for their dedication.
One also wonders if the team would have
showed such obedience if the coach had
said before the season that she expected
no alcohol consumption during the season,
or year-round.
Ms. Nelson-Lee blatantly lifts herself
and the rest of her teammates onto a pedestal above every single student-athlete
at Swarthmore. This simply is not right. I
do not believe that the job of a Phoenix
writer is to use the platform to promote
herself and her friends. While the members of the team, including Ms. NelsonLee, ought to be commended for their
commitment to Swarthmore athletics, so
should every other student-athlete.

Stop complaining
about Sharpies
To the Editor:
Natsu Furuichi's article "Empowered
Painters" (In Depth, pg. 10, Mar. 16) disturbed me because of the following sentence: "The poor quality of food at
Sharpies dining hall is usually enough to
depress most Swarthmore students." I'm
not sure why, but complaining about the
food served in Sharpies seems to be a favorite pastime (outside of complaining
about school work) for many Swarthmore
students. I agree that Sharpies does not
serve incredible, world-class cuisine, but
I believe that it is quite good for what it
aspires to be: a college cafeteria. Having
sampled the cuisine at other colleges in
the U.S., and now in Poland, I can say that
the food at Sharpies is by far the best that
I have had. The selection of choices that
Sharpies offers alone should make
Swatties feel grateful. Furthermore, I am
amazed by the receptiveness of the
Sharpies staff to student input. Here's the
secret: instead of complaining to your
friends about how bad the food is, e-mail
food@swarthmore.edu and give some constructive suggestions to the people who
can actually do something to change the
situation. Chances are if you request lobster and caviar, you'll be disappointed, but
if you keep expectations realistic for a
college cafeteria, you might just see
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts one day.

Support groups needed
To the Editor:
As a self-identified black Swarthmore
student, I must say I took some offense to
alumnus Sigmund "Pete" Beck's letter to
the editor ("College endorses racial stereotypes," pg. 6, March 16). I find it extremely troublesome that Mr. Beck does
not distinguish between administrative
and student-driven efforts to provide and
encourage a healthy multi-ethnic environment here at Swarthmore, and a so-called
institutionaland systematic oppression of
"just being oneself," a degenerative relationship that simply does not exist.
Sure, support mechanisms like SASS,
HOLA, SQU and yes, DU, are not wholly
concerned with analyzing, interpreting
and deconstructing black, Hispanic, queer
or athletic "cultures." Yet one fact that is
continually overlooked is that as an academic institution, Swarthmore is not now
what it was 50 years ago, when Mr. Beck
was here. These groups exist to get stu-

dents into Swarthmore, help them survive socially and academically and then,
most importantly, graduate. If Ms. Wilson, Mr. Taylor or any other student
feels categorically "superior" to these
which have both
support systems
their historical origins and present practice rooted not in administrative efforts,
but the collective will of the minority
student body
hopefully the familiar
"nothing is mandatory at Swarthmore"
will be of some constructive use.
Though what is largely recognized as
the "civil rights movement" seems to
some a distant memory of more than 30
years past, I'd like to think the legislative and social land purchased in those
years wasn't simply on loan. Mr. Taylor's
dilemma is real. But interpreted alongside commentary such as Mr. Beck's, it
represents not just two steps forward,
but also four steps back.

Gore is the pro-choice candidate
To the Editor:
Vice President Al Gore is a strong defender of every woman's right to choose
to end her pregnancy. In the March 16
edition of The Phoenix, Mark Dingfield
criticized Gore for his evolution on the
issue of abortion ("Gore distorts his antiabortion past," Opinions, pg. 7). It is true
that in the early 1980s, Al Gore cast votes
in Congress that he wouldn't cast today
But he has always defended the basic right
to choose embodied by Roe v. Wade. The

next president will appoint up to four new
Supreme Court justices enough to overturn Roe v. Wade. George W. Bush wants
to take away a woman's right to choose
under all circumstances. And if he is
elected president, he will have the power
to do it. Now is the timefor all pro-choice
voters, Republican, Democrat and independent, to protect women's reproductive
freedom by supporting Al Gore for president.

How to write a Phoenix editorial
By Nick Attanasio

For The Phoenix

I

"bubble.")
Style Three: Spike
Now we're getting more advanced. A writer has to be awfully
sure of his or her ability when writing an editorial in the humorous tradition of that great humor magazine, Spike. The most im-

circus

Spending
snafus

portant requirement is to remember that it isn't enough just to be
funny in a Spike editorial; you also have to be cool. Obviously,
your average Phoenix writers won't be capable of reproducing
the highly refined humor of Swarthmore's only annual humor
magazine, but with a few "tricks of the trade," they can be the
next best things.
First tip: use profanity. I cannot emphasize this enough. Believe me, there is nothing funnier than the wortK'fuck." When
you're done writing, look at your editorial. Ask yourself, "Do I
say 'fuck' enough?" If the answer is no, simply use the find and
replace function of your word processor to replace all marks of
punctuation with "fuck."
Second tip: name-drop elite literary figures and use "cool"
theoretical jargon. Look at the following list: Kafka, Other, postmodern, Pynchon, Lacan. Can you use all these in a sentence?
How about: "Kafka's post-modern m(Other) Pynchoned Lacan.
Fuck." See, it's not that hard. (Bonus option: listen to WSRN while

writing.)
As you can see, writing Phoenix editorials is, like all other
forms of art, really a science. Of course your options are not
merely limited to those outlined above. There are more advanced
approaches available including: 1) the staff editorial (Be really,
really, really mad about something. Insult whomever you consider responsible. Works best if written right before deadline);
2) the U-WIRE piece (Low on copy, Mr. Editor-man? Just plug in
a real editorial from a real college newspaper!); and 3) the
Fischette editorial (Edgily funny and unfunny at the same time.
Not to be confused with the Spike editorial.)
I hope that Phoenix writers will cherish these pearls of wisdom. Part two of this guide will return next week when I explore even more advanced opining techniques including the bitter "Ex-Phoenix editor" editorialand the "Look how I can rip off
Dave Barry and still not be funny" editorial.
See you then.

LETTERTOTHE EDITOR

Excessive use of N-word distressing
To the Editor:
I am truly concerned with the way in
which theN-word has somehowslipped into
many facets of speech. I listen to hip-hop or
rap songs, and for some reason, many artists feel the need to use it profusely. I listened a few weeks ago when Power 99 (a
local radio station) held a forum about the
usage of the word, its origins and how itaffects the black community. Artists defend
the use of the word and explained how African-Americans have changed the meaning
of the word by removing the "er" at the end
and adding an "a" interesting.
I am writing because I have heard this
word used on two occasions by three different people on this campus, a campus
that is supposedly diverse and politically
correct. I truly despise the word and its
history, and the fact that African-Americans use it too much troubles me. However,
it also troubles me that in both instances

MIMI HANAOKA

fdbls

Lately, I've been feeling the heavy burden of my 21 years. It's
not that I feel old exactly, it's more that I can feel myself getting
more crotchety and complacent. And as the unappetizing and
ill-defined prospect of my life after Swarthmore rears its ugly

head, I've been forced to realize just how little I've actually done
here.
Well, it's time to change that.
If there is one thing about Swarthmore that I am qualified to
speak on, it is The Phoenix. In various ways, I have contributed
to the school newspaper for six semesters. Remember when it
only came out twice a month? That was me. In any event, The
Phoenix used to be my baby. Sure, it was a malformed and ugly
baby, no one liked to look at it much and it was always a sort of
unpleasant surprise when it arrived every Friday afternoon, but
it was mine.
Therefore, my lasting contribution to the Swarthmore community will be this op-ed: "The official guide to writing a Phoenix editorial." Oh, I know what you're saying to yourself, reader.
You're saying, "But Nick, anyone with the IQ of moldy cheese
can write a Phoenix editorial. What's to know?" Ha ha, reader,
pardon me for saying this, but you are an idiot. Crafting a Phoenix editorial is a painstaking process that can take upwards of
45 minutes in extreme cases. To simplify things for those hard
working writers and to ensure that the proud editorial tradition
of The Phoenix continues, I've prepared this guide, a copy of
which will be bronzed and placed, unread, in the Friends Historical Library.
The single most important consideration when writing an editorial is style. Never forget that old saying, "Style is substance."
Whether you're aiming for the now all-but-forgotten humorous
bitterness of a Katie Menzer or the whiny, angry bitterness of a
Mimi Hanaoka, style is key. In regards to Phoenix editorials,
there are many time-tested styles to choose from.
Style One: The Political
This is a great editorial for the beginner, as no one will read it
except for the writers of other political editorials. Just pick an
issue that's as far away as possible from the Swarthmore campus and write about it. It doesn't matter what stance you take, as
long as you generalize the political attitudes of the entire campus. In addition, the writer whohas the most liberal opinion wins
a prize at the end of the year, so you should emphasize how
Swarthmore really isn't all that liberal and that if you were in
charge, "defacing" the College Republicans board wouldn't just
be an option, it wouldbe a requirement. If you are a Republican,
pretend that "conservative" equals "oppressed minority." (Bonus option: be an economics major and use high-tech words like
"supply" and "demand" to give your argument that extra "kick.")
Style Two: The Painfully Obvious
This is another quick and dirty style; try to aim for under 15
minutes. Start with a variation of the following, "Swarthmore is
not the same as the real world." Continue by pointing out exactly how Swarthmore differs from thereal world. Conclude by
restating your thesis: "Swatties need to realize that Swarthmore
is not the real world." Simple. (Bonus option: use the word

when I heard the N-word, it was used by
white males. The first time, I was in Phi
Psi when one gentleman used the word Nword when speaking to another gentleman.
I did not have the opportunity to say anything to the person who said it, but I did
say something to his friend. He apologized,
and that was the end of it. Saturday night
while leaving Phi Psi, I heard two gentlemen singing a verse of a rap song and continuously using the N-word. I did not confront the two gentlemen because they were
intoxicated and I did not want a scene.
The part that bothers me the most is that
people, regardless of race, feel comfortable using a word with such a dark history. It was used to subjugate AfricanAmericans and maintain a level of superiority. I cannot understand why we as
African-Americans continue to use this
word to address each other, but it needs
to stop. Hip-hop artists need to realize that

non-black people listen to their musicand
sing lyrics where the N-word shows up
constantly. I am not putting all the blame
on record industries, but we need to stop
using the word and come up with more
creative ways to affirm each other.
I now look back and wish I had said
something to those guys. I hope that the
word is not a part of their everyday vocabulary, because the connotationsbehind
it are very hurtful. I do not care if Jay-Z,
DMX or Eve use the N-word all the time
in their songs; it does not give anyone the
right to use it, for any reason. I know those
guys would not have said it if there were
black people around; and if their friends,
whether black, white or purple, let them
use it, then that's a huge problem as well.
We need to understand that words have
meaning and history, and it is time for the
N-word to be buried, forever.
Shelley Laws 'Ol

"Weather Hotline!" is the only response
I ever manage to get from the new $25,000
automated voice recognition system, regardless of what I say to the parrot-like
voice at the other end of the line. Unless I
have a crippling speech impediment that
makes anything I say sound like "weather
hotline," and nobody else on campus is
ever exasperated by the perplexingly
fickle voicerecognition, I wonder why we
have the system at all. It isn't as if we are
saving money by eliminating the operators that we used to have.
I have no intention of providing stunning
economic analysis. I simply want to point
out a few of the wonderfully useless, annoying and expensive things that the college
has purchased in recent months, just because it makes for such an entertaining list.
My favorite splurge by far is the installation of sound-dampening panels in the
big room of Sharpies, because of the painstaking research that went into this investment. In a letter to President Al Bloom,
professor Carr Everbach, who conducted
elaborate experiments on how to reduce
the ruckus in Sharpies, wrote that "the
reverberation time (the time a soundtakes
to decay sixty decibels) has been more
than cut in half, from almost four seconds
to well under two." The Phoenix discovered that "in a series of late-night tests,
Everbach fired a starter's pistol in the big
room and recorded the decibel decay on a
digital oscilloscope, later analyzing the
resulting graphs to find the reverberation
time." The 118 panels cost $15,000.
The college also narrowly escaped the
tempting proposition of becoming a Krispy
Kreme franchise at a cost of $750,000 when
labor problems with the local distributor
prevented shipments ofKrispy Kremes to
the college in early February. Short of
spending three quarters of a million dollars so that students could gorge themselves on doughnuts, the only other option
Director of Dining Services Linda
McDougall had was to buy the doughnuts
at retail prices from Acme. This crisis
reached fever pitch when McDougall discovered that there would be no way to get
the doughnuts to campus, because Acme
could not deliver them. God only knows
how this crisis was resolved, but I'd like to
congratulate the college for its self-control
in not indulging in an impulse buy which
would have transformed our college into a
purveyor of fine Krispy Kreme products.
According to one of my fellow writers
here at The Phoenix, the college is "getting ready to step into the limelight with a
new set of directional signs which will
appear on campus during the 2000-01 academic year." A nine-person committee has
been formed with the explicit purpose of
discussing where and how to strategically
place signs. The college is still mum on
how much this sign-posting extravaganza
will cost, although they have decided that
a Washington, D.C.-based firm will work

Losing a landmark

f light on the charred spectacle at

door on the exposed second
floor swings eerily back and forth; cars and pedestrians slow or stop to glance at
the historic landmark blocked offby a flapping line ofyellow tape; and an unburnt, bright
white sign on thefront lawn announces the ironic truth: ulngleneuk Tea House
Closed
Mon. iff Tues."
No one knows if the Ingleneuk will ever reopen, and the shock ofsuch a sudden transformation has affected the town psyche. According to State Police Assistant Fire Marshall
Robert Dodge, 50 percent to 65 percent of the building has been destroyed, and the owner,
Sally Perrine, sees little hope of rebuilding on the existing foundation. While the oncebustlingfamily restaurant had lost its lusterfrom the days ofold, itspresence in the community was still strong enough that its burnt remains have created a genuine sense of loss.
Like a lost puppy, the words of the owner and community members reflect a quaint remembrance of the past and a subtle urgency to reclaim the tangibility ofa loved possession.
120 Park Avenue. A

...

The Night of the Fire
The last customers left the Ingleneuk only a half-hour
before the blaze was sparked, at 9:20 p.m. Saturday night.
Sally Perrine, the third-generation owner of the family establishment, had closed up the tea house and was already
at home when the Ingleneuk's next-door neighbors called
and told her about the blaze. Perrine drove to the scene
immediately, and as she approached from Route 320, she
saw the first signs of the fire.
"It was unbelievable," she recalled in a phone interview
Tuesday. "I could see smoke from College Avenue."
Perrine knew how bad things were when she arrived to
find the upper half of her tea house in flames. She looked
on as eight area firefighting crews attacked the blaze, but
she was encouraged to return home after a short while.
There was nothing she could do except watch the Ingleneuk
continue to burn and smolder.
According to Perrine, her first thoughts that night were
not about the house, but about her father, Bill Kurtzhalz.
"He was my main concern," she said. Kurtzhalz, an animated octogenarian and a lifelong Swarthmore resident,
was the second-generation owner of the Ingleneuk, inheriting the place from his stepmother, Leslie Osgood
Kurtzhalz. He had worked at the Ingleneuk for over 60
years.
Perrine's husband Scott, co-operator of the Ingleneuk,
made the trip to Kurtzhalz's house just a few blocks away
to tell him the news. He did not go to see the building until
the next morning.
Kurtzhalz was also at the Ingleneuk earlier that night.
He works part time at the front desk and serves as cashier
during his three-day a week duty, and he is unpaid. That
night, he recalled, about 50 patrons from two private parties were still dining at 8 p.m. A half-hour later, he left work
for perhaps the last time. He recalled hearing sirens about
an hour later, but he said, "I just didn't think it was necessary to go on the porch [to see the origin of the smoke.]"

Perrine, meanwhile, was "up all night" and stayed back
the next morning as her husband and father returned to
the scene. Kurtzhalz looked on and reminisced to reporters and residents about the rich history of the Ingleneuk.
Perrine arrived later that day and was able to enter the
building to reclaim remaining items. Among the things she
took away were portraits of each of the three generations
of owners: Osgood, Kurtzhalz and Perrine.
According to Perrine, the two portraits of Osgood and
herself are in decent condition, but the portrait of her father was pretty much ruined by the fire.
Also present Sunday afternoon was Alice "Putty" Willetts,
a Borough councilwoman and Rotary Club president. The
Rotary Club held their weekly meetings in a room at the
Ingleneuk, and Willetts was able to reclaim most of the club
paraphernalia out of the unburnt corner of the building.
Willetts recalled the scene inside the building as an eerie
juxtaposition of elegance and disaster. Several tables were
prepared with full serving implements and flowers for the
next day's business, but the first floor was soaked by thousands of gallons of water. "The damage looked like Niagara
Falls coming down the stairs," commented Willetts.

A Landmark Steeped in the Past
The sense of history at the Ingleneuk is the overwhelming symbol of its importance to the Swarthmore community. In its heyday, the tea house was known throughout the
Philadelphia area for its menu specialties, particularly its
sticky buns. In Willetts' words, "Swarthmore was known
for the Ingleneuk." Lines often slinked out the door as
people lined up for family-style dining.
Kurtzhalz remembers the exact day he started working
at the Ingleneuk
Sept. 4,1937. Through the years, he has
moved into the kitchen and back out, seen thousands of
patrons come and go and has inherited the official responsibility for the Ingleneuk and then passed it on.
The Ingleneuk's heyday was marked by, in Perrine's

The charred remains of IngleneukTea House stand over Park Avenue a

words, a "wonderful relationship with the college."Many
students worked at the restaurant, including James

Michener, and the general atmospheres ofboth the college

and the tea house had more in common.
Over the years, the style of dining at the Ingelneuk has
become an anachronism. A Ville ordinance in 1983 made it
illegal to bring your own bottle (BYOB) in an already dry
town, and patrons flocked to restaurants on the nearby
Baltimore Pike. Those who still frequent the Ingleneuk and
Village Restaurant, the other family-style restaurant in the
Ville, are mainly older, longtime residents.
The recent history of the Ingleneuk simultaneously celebrated and tried to overcome the antiquated atmosphere
The placemats told the story of the place, but according to
Perrine, the general feel of the place, and the menu, needed
overhaul if it were to thrive in the future. Last year, Perrine
attempted to sell the Ingleneuk, but no one was willing to
buy the building.
The new Ville revitalization plan hoped to reclaim the
centrality of the Ingleneuk to the Swarthmore community.
Recongizing the predominately older clientle and declining market, the plan recommended that the Ingleneuk be
converted into a Bed and Breakfast.
But for some, including Willetts, the Ingleneuk was still
a frequent restaurant stop. Willetts said that the Ingleneuk
has been there all her life, and that a lack of alcohol was
not enough to stop her from going.
A sense of history and contunity defined the Ingleneuk.
The Rotary Club held their Friday meetings there for th*
last 50 years. And just last Friday, Florida resident Jack
Dutton'2B, a Swarthmore track and field record holder,
dropped in at the Ingleneuk. Kurtzholz was glad to see his
old friend.

venue as a reminder of the 82 years of memories made there.

said Dodge. "We're just waiting to confirm our ideas with
the findings of the insurance investigators." Dodge will
release the official results of the investigation Monday.
Luckily, the fire spared much of the most expensive
equipment and most precious items in the teahouse. According to Dodge, the fire started at a single source in the
rear left corner of the building and traveled vertically, pushing out horizontally whenever it reached an obstacle,
spreading around it and then resuming its upward path.
Firefighters were able to contan theblaze before it spread
to the kitchen and much of the dining areas. Perrine is
borrowig moving equipment to move some of the heavier
ilems out of the tea house.
Perrine is currently stuck in a morass of insurance
bureacracy, making calls day and night to begin the claims
process. She expects the Ingleneuk to continue to be her
full-time job, though her job description will now include a
difficult and long-term rebuilding process.
"I'd like to be able to get in there [and start renovating],"
said Perrine, expressing her frustration with the insurance
process. Still, the fire comes at a time of transition, and
Perrine intimated a hint of optimism about rebuilding.
Kurtzholz lost the tangibility of 60 years of memories
this weekend. His tone of voice in a phone interview Tuesday seemed to eulogize both the building and his role in it.
When asked what he will do with is weekends now that he
is on at least a temporary sabbatical from his job at the
Ingleneuk, he had no specific plans. All he could say was,
Tm not gonna sit in this house."
Perrine's sense of loss was tempered when she said,"lt's
a nightmare, but nobody got hurt and you have to put that
in perspective." And although some have lost their way of
life and their sense of place, no one was left homeless.
Well, almost no one. After 50 years, The Rotary Club has
suddenly been displaced. According to Willetts, a room at
a local country clubhas been rented for the next few months
of Rotary meetings. But, she added, "It's just not the same.
That was our home."

They don't have a Dalmatian or a fire pole, and they
don't rescue cats from trees.
For Swarthmore's volunteerfirefighters, life is far from
the intermittently leisurely and exciting existence of their
storybook counterparts. It is a juggling act that involves
balancing their work and social lives with the demands of
constantly being on call.
As the Ingleneuk Tea House blazed on Saturday night,
it was the volunteers' ability to pull off this balance that
shone through.
Nearly half a dozen Swarthmore students worked to
beat the fire, carrying hoses and braving the heat and
smoke, for almost six continuous hours, not leaving the
scene until 3:30 a.m. Several were stationed in the heart
of the flames, on the precarious third floor, which they
had to evacuate before it caved in.
And yet, for most of the volunteers, it was just another
day's work. AllisonFloyd 'O2 and Jesse Wells 'Ol, who have
both volunteered with the department for over two years,
were dismissed from the station at 4:00 a.m. only to return there several hours later for an eight-hour training
session. During those few spare hours, Wells barely slept;
instead, he responded to two more calls to investigate reports of possible flare-ups at the Ingleneuk.
The next morning at the training, "we were a little
1ate...," Floyd said, trailing off while she, Wells, and emergency medical technician volunteerBrian Murray 'Ol momentarily tilted their heads and turned their attention
away from the interview toward a force that this reporter
could not detect.
"It is this whole world that comes out to you when you
become a firefighter," Wells explained, pointing out a
barely audible siren. "Just being at Swarthmore, [you]
start to hear and feel this world outside of you. You listen
to all the other sirens that go off, and you get to learn
which ones they are by the very sound and duration of
the sound."
It is arguably this attentiveness and devotion that makes
the Swarthmore department one of the most successful
volunteer departments around. According to Floyd, it is
one of the only departments that rarely faces the prob-

lem of "scratching", which occurs when the department
does not get enough volunteer response to a call to send
out an engine.
Floyd attributed Swarthmore's success to the ability of
Swarthmore students to respond to calls quickly because
they tend to stay within the borough most of the time. This
explanation downplays the role that the students' intense
dedication must play in the matter, however; many of the
volunteers never exempt themselves from duty.
"Every call I can make, I'm there," said volunteer Dan
Krausz 'O2. Most volunteers put a change of clothes out
before they go to sleep in case they should have to respond
to a call in the middle of the night and carry their pagers
with them to the bathroom when they shower.
Krausz recently doubled his call load when he also started
volunteering with the South Media fire department, but his
work as a Swarthmore department volunteer alone is undoubtedly heavy. Volunteers, especially if they also serve
as EMTs, often put in over 30 hours a week of work with
training and calls. They must complete 160 hours of initial
training before they can even begin to fight fires, and even
seasoned volunteers continue to attend training sessions.
But the extensive training pays off: it ensured that
Saturday's fire-fighting effort went smoothly. Articulating
the feelings of the other firefighters interviewed, Krausz
said, "On Saturday, things went as well if not better than I
could possibly have imagined them going...Everybody
worked together very well."
And yet, a "good" fire still means 300 degree heat, blinding smoke, and unpredictable difficulties. Krausz, who described the eerie experience of being inside the flaming
Ingleneuk, said, "In some ways there's a sense of isolation
because our gear really does isolate us from the
environment...You can't see very far at a11...Y0u have to
rely on your other senses."
It is emotionally and physically difficult, and, yes, even
the dedicated volunteers get tired. "By the third hour, I
was wishing for a hot shower and bed," said Jonah Eaton
'O2, whose position operating a deluge gun required him to
continually move the heavy water cannon.
Despite the challenges and strains, however, the volunteers were resoundingly positive about their firefighting
experiences. "I've been really happy doing it," Floyd said.
"I can't imagine Swarthmore without it."

In depth | March 23,2000

During

the final week of February,
as students confront an onslaught
of midterms and hastily finalize
plans for spring break, the college announces a decision that often garners relatively little attention from the largest faction of the Swarthmore community. The
decision to grant eligible faculty members
reappointment with continuous tenure "is
one of the most important decisions made
by the [c]ollege," according to the
Swarthmore Faculty Handbook.
Tenure decisions, which determine the
members of Swarthmore permanent faculty, have a direct and longlasting impact
on the college.
"Unless they choose to leave or become
unable to carry out their job, [tenured faculty members] will stay here for the rest
of their careers," Provost Jennie Keith
said.
Swarthmore has approximately 160 tenure-track positions, of which 70 percent
are occupiedby tenured faculty members,
according to Keith. Non-tenure track faculty at the college include those hired temporarily as leave replacements forpermanent faculty. Professors generally become
eligible for tenure after six years at the
college. Because ofits emphasis on teaching, Swarthmore never grants tenure to
its faculty members upon hiring them.
Nevertheless, the tenure process is usually accelerated for those professors who
come to Swarthmore with extensive prior

teaching experience.
This year's tenure decisions were
unique in that they involved an unusually
large numberof eligible faculty members,
all 12 of whom received tenure, Keith said.
Notified of their promotion on Feb. 26,
following a final vote by the Board of
Managers, newly tenured professors are
MichaelBrown (Physics), Tim Burke (History), Frank Durgin (Psychology), Maria
Luisa Guardiola (Spanish), Cynthia
Halpern (Political Science), Sarah Hiebert
(Biology), Philip Jefferson (Economics),
Nora Johnson (English), Haili Kong (Chinese), Lisa Meeden (Computer Science),
Patty White (English) and SarahWillie (Sociology and Anthropology).
"It's a big vote of confidence," Hiebert
said of her recent promotion. "[And] it's
all the sweeter because everybody got tenure this year."
Factors in the Tenure Decision
The two key criteria for tenure at
Swarthmore are teaching and scholarship,
though service to the college and to the
wider community are also taken into account, Keith said. In keeping with

Swarthmore's central mission, the tenure
evaluationprocess places great emphasis
on the candidates' teaching ability.
"Teaching has to be strong," Keith said.
"We never tenure someone who's a star at
research but not a strong teacher."
But the college also seeks to tenure faculty members who are excellent scholars
a quality intrinsically
in their fields
linked to teaching, according to Keith. Research enables faculty members to stay
abreast of the latest developments in their
fields and to communicatethis knowledge
to their students.
Service, the third criterion in the tenure evaluationprocess, ranges from participating on college committees to working for social justice outside of
Swarthmore. While service does "matter,"
according to Keith, it receives less weight
than teaching or scholarship and "does not
make up for serious flaws" in these two
most important areas.
Although faculty diversity may play a
role in tenure decisions, it "is not considered in any categorical way," according
to Keith. The college uniformlyapplies the
criteria for tenure regardless of a
candidate's race or gender.
"When we read a [tenure] file, we're
looking at a judgement of the whole person as a teacher, a scholar, and a member
of the college community," Keith explained. "There is no quota or different
type of judgement [for certain faculty
members]."

Nevertheless, Keith maintained that
race and gender could not be called "irrelevant" to tenure decisions, as these
characteristics are clearly relevant in
most situations in American society. For
instance, students may say in their letters
that having a minority or female faculty
member makes a positive difference in a
particular learning situation.
Williams and Amherst Colleges weight
teaching, scholarship, and service similarly to Swarthmore, according to the faculty handbooks of those colleges.
The University of Virginia, a large public institution, also uses these criteria, and
in recent years has placed increasing emphasis on teaching, which is now almost
as important as research in the tenure
evaluation process, according to Dean of
Faculty Melvyn Leffler. Nevertheless,
Leffler maintains that, during discussion
of tenure cases, "more time is spent discussing research and publications than
any other issue."
The Tenure Process
Tenure candidates at Swarthmore go
through a standard
evaluation process that
has multiple stages and
involves the participation of nearly all factions of the college community. According to a
memo sent by Keith to
all department chairs
last fall, the academic
department ofeach tenure candidate compiles
a dossier that includes
the candidate's curriculum vitae, copies of his
or her scholarship and
an optional statement
from the candidate on
his or her research and
teaching. These dossiers also must contain
letters from every
member
of
the
candidate's department,
letters
from
Swarthmore colleagues
outside the department,
letters from external
colleagues in the
candidate's field and letters from students the
candidate has taught or

of TENURE

advised.
All tenured faculty members of a department and occasionally non-tenured
faculty members meet to read and discuss the dossier of the tenure candidate.
Based on this discussion, the chair writes
a letter that states the department's recommendation on whether to grant tenure
and explains the process by which this recommendation was reached. This letter,
which becomes part of the candidate's
dossier, should include the opinions of all
tenured members of the department, not
just those of the chair, according to Keith.
This process is generally uniform
across departments, though interviews
with department chairs revealed several
exceptions. While encouraged to write
about a candidate before looking at student and extramural letters, faculty members in each department are permitted to
look at the candidate's dossier ifthey feel
that this access would "substantially improve" their own letters, the Faculty
Handbook said. Most of the department
chairs interviewed said they asked faculty
members in their department to write letters before reading the dossier.
"Faculty don't see the dossier [before
writing their letters] to make sure that all
viewpoints are aired," said professor Peter Collings, chair of the department of
physics and astronomy. "We prefer that
tentative opinions be heard and perhaps
changed rather than not heard at all."
Although most department chairs said
they solicited letters from 40 to 50 students in order to obtain the requisite 25
for the candidate's dossier, Collings said
the physics and astronomy department
asks for letters from all of the candidate's
former and current students, who often
number over 100. Moreover, only tenured
faculty generally read a candidate's dossier and discuss his or her tenure case; in
the physics and astronomy department,
however, both tenured and non-tenured
faculty participate in the departmental deliberations.
"I can think of no better way to help tenure-track faculty understand the [tenure]
process," Collings said.
The department must submit a
candidate's dossier to the Committee on
Promotion and Tenure (CPT) by early
December, according to Keith's memo.
Appointed by the Committee on Faculty
Procedures (COFP), the CPT consists of
four faculty members from all three academic divisions, in addition to the provost
and the president.
The CPT, which meets during the first
six weeks of the spring semester to review
each candidate's dossier, does not simply
accept a departmental recommendation,
Keith said. On the contrary, the Committee carefully evaluates each dossier and,
in instances when a particular tenure case
is not straightforward, the CPT may interview members of the candidate's department or request additional information. The CPT sometimes gives a negative
recommendation where the candidate's
department offered a positive one.
Following deliberations, the CPT formally presents its tenure recommendation
to the president, who in turn submits arecommendation to the Board of Managers
(BOM), according to Keith. Since the

president serves on the CPT, however, his
recommendation is almost always consistent with thatof the Committee.The BOM
has the final power to accept or veto any
tenure decision from the president.
Faculty members denied tenure may
request an oral explanation of the reasons
for the decision. They may then appeal the
decision if they believe there were insufficient grounds for denial.The candidates
may first ask for a reconsideration of the
decision by the faculty and administration
involved. If the results of thereconsideration are not satisfactory to them, they may
ask for a written statement giving the reasons for the college's decision. If the candidate continues to believe that there are
respects in which the consideration of
there case was inadequate or improper,
they may have their case reviewed by the
faculty members of the CPT. In cases
where the faculty members on the CPT
also made the original decision to deny
tenure, the COFP will appoint an ad hoc
committee of faculty members to review
the case.
These stages of the tenure process are
nearly identical at Amherst and Williams
Colleges, according to the Faculty Handbooks of those colleges. At the University
of Virginia, an additional committee reviews each tenure case, Leffler said,
though the structure of the process remains similar to that at Swarthmore.
Student Input
One of the central aspects of the tenure
process at Swarthmore is the use of student letters to evaluate teaching.
"I can't emphasize enough how important student letters are," Keith said. "They
are the major source ofinformation about
teaching."
The six department chairs interviewed
also underscored the primary importance
of student letters when judging a tenure
candidate's teaching.
The candidate and the department each
choose approximately half of those students solicited to write letters, according
to Keith's memo. These students should
include those who did well in the
candidate's course as well as those who
did poorly, those in the Honors program
and those in course, as well as those who
have taken introductory courses and those
who have taken upper-level seminars.
Recent graduates.are also asked to write
for a candidate.
Keith and the faculty members interviewed said they were generally very
impressed with the thoroughness and insight of the student letters.
Nevertheless, the majority of students
interviewed for this article were unsure
how much weight their letters had in the
tenure process. One anonymous student
had misgivings about whether student letters received adequate consideration.
"They say it is impossible to get tenure
at Swarthmore without positive student
recommendations, but I don't think that
is the case," he said.
Moreover, most of the students interviewed said they would hesitate to write
a negative or an ambivalent letter about a
tenure candidate.
"I would only write for a professor I felt
positively about," said one student, who

www.phoenix.swarthmore.edu

Fairness of the Process
The large majority of the faculty interviewed for this article
three of whom
were junior faculty members and 11 of
whom were tenured
agreed that the
tenure process was as fair as possible.
Many faculty cited the thoroughness of
each candidate's evaluation as ensuring
the fairness of the process.
Collings said the sheer volume of statements written by students, Swarthmore
faculty and colleagues outside the college
prevents any minority opinion from receiving undue weight.
"The process in general is fair," Collings
said. "But whether it's fairfor every single
case depends on the people involved."
The CTP functions in part to prevent
any lapses in the process by making sure
that it has a complete and representative
view of the candidate, Collings said. Faculty serving on the CTP are also supposed
to familiarize themselves with each department and the dynamics within it.
Indeed, psychology professor and chair
Deborah Kemler-Nelson, who has served
on the CPT, said the members of that committee carry out the tenure process "remarkably well."
"I'm impressed by how much work the
people on the committee put in," KemlerNelson said. "They make good judgements
even about people outside their fields."
History professor and chair Bob
Weinberg said that, in the twelveyears he
has taught at the college, the process has
produced few surprises. In general, those
he has expected to receive tenure have
done so, and in the cases where faculty

f

to right;

members have failed to receive tenure, "it
has not been a total surprise."
Several faculty members at all levels
mentioned that Swarthmore's willingness
to tenure qualified faculty members contributes to the fairness of the process.
"The logic wouldbe to say no way should
the college tenure [all] 12 people," English
professor and chair Chuck James said in
reference to this year's tenure decision.
"I don't know where else would have done
that. It's very refreshing."
While the tenure evaluation process is
extensive, it is not designed to "weed out"
all but a few select candidates.
Swarthmore has no departmental or college-wide quota for tenure, according to
Keith. Consequently, tenure-track professors in departments with a large percentage of tenured faculty do not face a more
rigorous tenure evaluation than those in
departments with a small percentage of
tenured faculty.
"It would be very negative for the college to have a quota because it would wind
up losing some wonderful people," Keith
said.
Indeed, the college tenures approximately 80 percent ofits tenure candidates.
By comparison, over the past five years,
Williams College has granted tenure to an
average of 68 percent of eligible faculty
members, according to Gail Burda, an administrative assistant in the Williams office of the dean of faculty. At the University of Virginia, approximately two-thirds
of tenure-track faculty receive tenure,
Leffler said. Williams, Amherst and the
University of Virginia do not have tenure
quotas.
Although Swarthmore tenures a comparatively high percentage of faculty,
longtime professors Tom Blackburn and
Thompson Bradley said that it may have
become slightly more difficult to receive
tenure than when they arrived at the college in the 19605. Blackburn believes that
the national market for tenure-track jobs
has become tighter in recent years, causing institutions to make their tenure evaluations more rigorous. Moreover, the expectations for scholarship, though always
rigorous, have become slightly higher
across the country, Bradley said.
At Swarthmore, the tenure process has
changed in more fundamental ways as
well. In the department of modern languages and literature, Bradley said the
process has become "fairer" because it
now involves many more people. Before
the 1980s, the chair used to make a recommendation to the CPT without input
from faculty, and fewer letters were solicited from faculty outside the department. Blackburn said the process has become muchclearer than in the past, which
may reflect a national trend toward increased awareness of litigation and liability.

Expectations for Tenure
For many faculty members interviewed, the fairness of Swarthmore's tenure evaluation process is closely related
to clear expectations. While conceding
that there is "no checklist" for tenure,
Collings said faculty members should be

told what is expected of them in as much
detail as possible.
"The part of the process that needs constant scrutiny is the information given to
the tenure-track faculty in the years prior
to the tenure decision ... We should never
say we're doing that well enough,"
Collings said.
This information is generally communicated to a candidate during a formal
review prior to the tenure decision. The
review, which occurs during a candidate's
third year at the college, determines
whether or not he or she will be reappointed for three more years and then become eligible for tenure in the sixth year,
according to the faculty handbook. Academic departments compile the same dossier for a third-year reappointment candidate as they would for a faculty member being considered for tenure. This dossier is reviewed by the department, provost and president. Unlike the tenure
evaluation, however, there is no committee involved in the third-year reappointment decision.
Like Collings, most department chairs
cited the third-year review as an opportunity to make sure tenure expectations are
clear. The provost and department chair
meet with the candidate to talk about the
general content of thereview. Candidates
are told what they are doing well and in
which areas they need to improve.
Most faculty members who have undergone third-year reviews within the past
several years said the process improved
their understanding of" tenure expectations by providing useful and supportive
feedback.
"I'm worried less [about the tenure process] because I went through a mock tenure evaluation," said math professor
Philip Everson, whose third-year review
occured last year. During his meeting with
the provost, Keith summarized the contents of Everson's dossier. This summary
provided a "very clear statement of what
you should do the same or differently to
prepare for tenure," Everson said.
But physics professor Michael Brown,
who received tenure this year, said it
would have been helpful to receive more
ongoing input regarding his performance
in the classroom. Although the physics
chair observed his classes several times,
there was "no [regular] guidance or feedback in terms of teaching," Brown said.
"It was hard to know objectively how I was
doing."
Brown was unsure what form an effective system offeedback on teaching might
take, however.
Possible Changes
Other faculty members also suggested
possible changes in certain areas of the
tenure process. Chemistry professor Paul
Rablen finds the prospect of being evaluated by "very distinguished" nonSwarthmore scholars one of the most
"nerve-wracking" aspects of his tenure
consideration.
The candidate and the department chair
each choose half of the six outside scholars who write letters for the tenure dossier, according to Keith's memo. The

BRENDAN KARCH | Phoenix Staff BRENDAN KARCH | Phoenix Stafff
:

asked to remainanonymous. "I know professors are anxious about receiving tenure, and I don't want to be the one to mess
up [their chances]."
But department chairs said they lookfor
general trends in student letters in order
to get an honest sense of the candidate's
teaching ability. If one letter is drastically
inconsistent with the others, it probably
will not have much influence. Those involved in the process also look at other
factors that might affect how the student
felt about the professor, such as performance in the course.
"[A student's] letter is not going to make
a decision go one way or the other, but it
will contribute," Collings said.
In fact, Collings said he would be concerned if student letters contained no
negative material, since this might indicate that the candidate was not sufficiently challenging students.
Most of the students interviewed did not
feel that they would experience negative
consequences from writing an honest letter. Keith said confidentiality should not
be a concern, since departments do not
keep a copy of a candidate's dossier on file.
For legal reasons, the college administration keeps one copy of the dossier for several years and then destroys it.
Non-tenured and recently tenured faculty agreed that student letters were an
effective way to evaluate teaching if the
process was done fairly. They were aware
that one negative letter would not hurt a
tenure case.

Professors Thompson Bradley (Modern Languages), Tim

scholars chosen by the department may
know the candidate only through his or her
research.
Rablen is concerned that some scholars
might not be aware that a small college
like Swarthmore has limited resources for
carrying out research, especially in terms
of equipment, laboratory space and release time from teaching responsibilities.
"If these differences aren't taken into
account, it could potentially be worrisome," Rablen said.
He suggested that the college provide a
description of Swarthmore's environment
for conducting research when it requests
tenure evaluations from outside scholars.
Department chairs currently include a
copy of the faculty handbook's section on
tenure when they make such requests,
though they are not required to send any
additional information on Swarthmore.
Although Rablen supports the use of
student letters in tenure evaluations, he
also suggested that more faculty involvement in judging teaching might provide a
fuller perspective. There is currently no
direct process whereby the college examines course materials, such as syllabi or
laboratory handouts.
"[This material] tells something that
students might not be able to judge because they are not experts in the field,"
Rablen said.
Nevertheless, Keith said that students
frequently discuss these materials in their
letters.
Several professors also said they wished
that more information couldbe conveyed
to tenure candidates regarding the status
of their cases before they were notified
of the college's final decision.
"There may be checkpoints during the
process where perhaps some of the uncertainty could be resolved sooner," said professor Philip Jefferson, who recently received tenure in the economics department.

Amherst Collegeis among those schools
that notify tenure candidates of departmental recommendations before thefinal
decison is announced, according to its
Faculty Handbook.
Keith said Swarthmore does not divulge
information about the department's recommendation primarily because the tenure decision is ultimately made at the college level.
Divulging the departmental decision to
a candidate could also lead to difficulties
in unusual cases when the department decides to deny tenure and theCPT makes a
positive recommendation, Keith said.
Newly tenured history professor Tim
Burke suggested a more radical departure
from Swarthmore's current tenure process. He feels the process allows colleagues at large research universities to
dictate the standards for good research.
These colleagues tend to prize narrow
specialization above the kind of broad
knowledge necessary for teaching.
Burke would prefer to be evaluated not
by other scholars who specialize in Southern African history, but by a diverse group
of people outside his field, his discipline
and even the academy itself. Burke ac-

Damm Yankees:
they've
got heart
By Catherine Osborne
Phoenix Staff
It's 1957, and the Washington Senators baseball club
has a lot of heart. This is about their only positive attribute: they have no good pitchers, no good fielders
and especially no good long-ball hitters. But they have
one resource even their tirelessly cheerleading manager Van Buren (John Loeser '00) doesn't know about.
They've got the devil on their side.
"Damn Yankees" is George Abbott's musical-theater
version of Douglass Wallop's novel "The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant." It plays on Swarthmore'sLPAC
mainstage this weekend, and is brought to you by director David Ryan 'OO, musical directors Bonnie French
'Ol and JoshLewis 'OO, choreographer Laurel Kean 'O3
and a cast of dozens. Abbott's book (and the songs of
Richard Adler and Jerry Ross) follows the story of one
Senators fan who would, literally, go to hell for his team.
This is Joe Boyd (Hollis Easter 'O3), a real estate salesman who treats his wife Meg (Megan Jo Moerke 'O3)
like a piece of furniture for six months of the year while
he sacks out in front of thetelevision watching the game.
Poor Joe's enthusiasm is misplaced; the Senators, who
couldn't win a ballgame if their lives depended on it,
spend every year ensconced firmly at the bottom of the
second division while the Yankees make off with the
pennant. This state of affairs leads to one of the best
moments of the production, a hilariously sarcastic rendition of "Heart" by Loeser and the men's chorus. It's
clear that to break out, the Senators are going to need
supernatural help. And after one too many losing games,
Joe Boyd announces to his empty living room that he'd
sell his soul for one long-ball hitter.
Enter Mr. Applegate (Jerry Melichar '00), who is
happy to help out Joe. He offers a deal: Joe gets the
hitter, and Applegate gets Joe. This is just too tempting
for the diehard fan, and Joe accepts the deal. But he
manages to slip in an escape clause. If he decides before midnight on the Sept. 24 that he wants out, he can
have his soul back. Applegate, momentarily distracted,
lets him have his clause, and Joe Boyd, middle-aged
suburbanite who can't touch his own toes, becomes Joe
Hardy (Evan Gregory '01), barely post-pubescent sports
genius. Needless to say, the Senators start winning...
and winning... and winning.

Leading Chinese author to give lecture

Joyrides and
horror films
"The Ninth Gate" and "FinalDestination"
are second-string horror films with surprisingly strong pedigrees: the first comes from
Roman Polanski, who in 1974 gave usa perfect motionpicture in "Chinatown"; the second from "The X-Files" Glen Morgan and
James Wong. Both films were terrific fun
to watch but not successes in any 'reviewable' way. It's a real shame that most horror films, like dreams, become stupid in
summary because in the dimness of theaters and living rooms, they enter into us,
making us scream and laugh and jump and
shake. They are rollercoasters and joyrides
and no criticism can ever fully explain away
the pleasure of experiencing them.
"The Ninth Gate" stars Johnny Depp, in
glasses and goatee and an accent of clipped
sonorous tones, as arare book detective trying to track down three ancient volumes said
to conjure up the Devil's personal pager
number; it does not bode well for the trajectory of Polanski's career that I would be
more apt to compare this film to "The
Devil's Advocate" —the 1998 Keanu Reeves
film that was "Wild Things" rethunk in Biblical terms
than to any of his earlier
greater works. Its long shelves ofbooks are
beautifully shot but its characters are thin
as paper and its pacing is way off, too slow
in start-up, too expeditious in winding down.
Polanski has always been too tormented
a filmmaker to really profit from the tonguein-cheek humor of the script. The friend I
saw it with pointed out that the film was a
weird mix of a lot of pretty nebulous
genres—the hard-boiled detective mystery,
the supernatural thriller, the horror comedy—and that mix, while interesting, also
proved pretty slight. Really, "The Ninth
Gate" seemed to possess no particular passion for its subject and I for one enjoyed
the quest and its sudden perverse details
but couldn't have cared less who found the
Devil's book, or what they did with it. After
a while, I just leaned back and waited for
Polanski's wife, Emmanuelle Seigner, to
bear her breasts, which she does in all his
films, and did here, a few minutes from the
end, before a curtain of flames.
In "Final Destination," it's a dead heatbetween which is more ridiculous
the
premise (a reluctant teenage psychic and
six of his friends narrowly escape dying in
a fiery plane crash—only to discover that
the Grim Reaper is out to settle the score!)
or the dialogue ("Death—you don't want to
fuck with that Daddy-mac!"). As this is a
teen horror film, the characters aren't exactly Shakespearean in their depth and vividness. The conceit of the film a slasher
film without a slasher feels invigorating
partly because it spares us an anti-climactic unmasking at the last minute (what I call
"the Scooby Doo dilemma") and partly because it inspires the filmmakers to come up
with some viciously clever ways of offing
their teens. The best death scenes are kind
of like that old Mousetrap game, governed
by an uncanny and diabolic domino effect,
where everything becomes treacherous
(hell, one person is killed by a teapot, a gas
oven, a cracked mug, a shot of vodka, a personal computer, a dish towel and a kitchen
knife). It's not believable, but it's entertain-

ment.

Author Mo Yan is predicted to be a future Nobel laureate, but tomorrow the only

red carpet underhis feet will be the slightly
worn one in the lobby ofMcCabe. Mo, a leading contemporary Chinese writer and, to
some, a baffling contradiction will give a
lecture in Chinese there titled "My Three
American Books" on Friday at 4:15 p.m.
His series of novels that reexamine
China's social and political histories have
earned him a position among the ranks of
the world's leading authors and a good
chance of becoming China's first Nobel
Prize-winning writer. 1994 winner
Kensaburo Oe said, "If I were to choose a
Nobel laureate, it would be Mo Yan."
According to Professor Haili Kong, the
prize committee may agree. "[Mo] is considered to be one of the most promising
writers [for the prize], probably one of the
two most," he said.
No doubt China would be proud. For the
government, however, such a prize would
be a bittersweet acquisition: Mo's work has
been a steady stream of subtle antigovermental criticism, principally through
his adept manipulation of history. At the
forefront of the root-seeking movement in
Chinese literature, his novels seek causes
for contemporary problems through reexaming the past few centuries of Chinese
history, and their conclusions are not kind
to the current Chinese government.
But if Mo's political generalizations annoy the Party, the distinctions he draws
among the experiences of different genera-

tions of commoners should inflame it. His
works often track the course of family lineages in which the lot of each successive
generation worsens. Kong commented, "It's
an implied criticism against the present, a
very strong subversiveness. It's very clear."
The Chinese government has been conspicuously silent on Mo's work, however.
Mo's position in the cultural affairs department of the People's Liberation Army, which
he held until several years ago, seems to
have exempted him from official criticism
in a country where critical intellectuals are
rarely given a second chance. Puzzling also
is that after Mo's avoidance of punishment
and achievemen and international acclaim,
he chose to continue to work for the PLA,
one ofChina's most reactionary institutions.
Kong calledit "amazing" and said that he is
eager to ask about the contradiction.
Perhaps Mo consciously cultivates incongruity. His symbolism is rich with unconventional combinations of opposites. In
"Red Sorghum," one ofhis best-known novels, sorghum represents both a basic necessity (a nourishing grain) and a source of
passion (sorghum can be made into wine).
Moreover, this mixture of simplicity and
intensity is in many waysreflective of Mo's
life. One of many children of a poor peasant couple, Mo grew up in rural Gaomi
County in the southern Shandong Province.
He worked herding cattleand later in a cottonseedoil factory before turning to the pen
and the fame it would bring him.
Deeply rooted in those humble beginnings
and yet somehow detached from them are
the three internationally acclaimed works

spawned. "Red Sorghum" was made into a
movie by the famed director Zhang Yimou,
who has said that he plans to adapt another
of Mo's works for his next film. "Red Sorghum" will be screened tonight at 8 p.m. in
a third floor viewing room of McCabe.
During tomorrow's lecture, an English
translation of Mo's words will be available
and a translator will be on hand during the
question and answer portion.

MTV's Winick creates endearing comic
By Greg Erskine
For The Phoenix
The majorproblem I had in writing this
review is that I'm not sure how to convince
my fellow students to read "The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius." As
much as I'd like to use a threat, I sadly
have no plague of locusts with which to
inflict said punishment. So in order to keep
your attention, I will use the same cheap
gimmick that the comic's publisher used:
the identity of the creator.
JuddWinick, writer and artist of "Barry
Ween," is probably best known as the
geeky guy from season three of MTV's
"The Real World." While the camera was
trained on the dramatics of Puck and
Pedro most of the time, Winick remained
quietly off-camera, drawing his cartoons
and honing his writing skills. In "Barry
Ween," these skills shine through. The
comic revolves around title character
Barry, a ten year old kid with a 3501Q. He
mutates his loved ones, he blows things
up, he swears a lot, and he's tremendously
endearing. Though Ween seems more
likely to destroy the world than save it,
his violence is always tempered with
gentleness, preferring to use tranquilizers and tazers over lethal weapons in the
elimination of those who would oppose
him. His best friend, Jeremy, also serves
as a moral anchor for Barry, keeping him
firmly entrenched in the daily life of prepubescent whippersnappers. Upon discovering that an alien has crashed in their
town, Jeremy's motivation for nursing it
back to health is so that he can try feeding it Reese's Pieces. Ween comes across
as an average kid with average takes on
the world around him. The only difference between him and the other kids is
that he has the ability to destroy the earth,
fix the lottery and create robot duplicates
of his babysitter.
Winick's simple, cartoony drawing style
has grown on me over time. His first ma-

jor work in the comics industry was the
Eisner Award-nominated miniseries,
"Road Trip," about a pair of siblings who
find out their older brother has died in a
car accident, and must identify his body.
Though "Road Trip" was powerful in its
own right, Winick's drawings lend themselves best to goofy, id-fueled childhood
escapades, and that's exactly what "Barry
Ween" is. The premise of a boy genius getting into trouble isn't exactly a new one,
and the situations Ween gets into are standard fare for kids' misadventures (after
all, what Swarthmore engineering student
hasn't accidentally opened up a glowing,
vagina-like interdimensional time warp?).
Winick's writing, however, is hilarious,
with the conversations between his characters timed perfectly. By keeping the
plots formulaic and the dialogue unique,
Winick keeps the book from straying too
much into "Amazing Stories" territory,
where the concept is better than the story
itself. In the second issue of the series,
Jeremy is turned into a dinosaur, and he
is less concerned about the science behind
his freakish mutation than with the reac-

tion of the other kids at school, who are
bound to point out the fact that his penis
hasn't grown proportionally along with the
rest of him. It's clear that Winick has a
soft spot in his heart for puerility. This
works out quite well, since, as we all know,
dick jokes equal funny.
Comics legends Matt Wagner ("Mage")
and Mike Allred ("Madman") have called
the series "Calvin and Hobbes on PCP"
and 'Dexter's Laboratory' meets 'South
Park.'" Like all three of the aforementioned creations, it captures the gleefulness of childhoodwhile inserting a healthy
dose of surreality. No matter how you
choose to describe it, "The Adventures of
Barry Ween, Boy Genius" is an absolutely
brilliant comic book. The first three issues, comprising volume one, have been
published in trade paperback form by Oni
Press, and issue one of volume two is currently on sale in comic stores. Because
each issue is a single, self-contained story,
it doesn't matter which one you start with.
So go, buy them now, borrow them from
me (x3461), do anything you must to get
your grubby little paws on them.

Likeable cast makes splashy 'Damn Yankees' a success
Show's stars give empatheticperformances with lovely singing
FromYANKS,pg. 14
Senators as they move up to second place in the first division
(just under those damn Yankees),
is the strongest by far, both in
terms of book and production.
Melichar is sly and very, very
funny as Applegate. With his wild
head of curly red hair (which
clashes violently with all of his
clothing), he slinks and shimmies
his way through the production.
And as usual, evil gets all the best
lines: when Joe, having second
thoughts, asks, "Is it so terrible
just to want to go home?"
Melichar doesn't miss a beat before replying "It's gauche."
Gregory is successful as Joe
Hardy. He's a ham but can also
be likable and tender. He starts
to realize almost immediately
what he lost when he left his wife,
and his journey back to her is the
emotional heart of the show. It
gives rise to some nice singing
on the parts of Gregory, Easter
and the sweet-voiced Moerke, although all three have trouble
making themselves heard over
the orchestra in their more introspective moments.
The chorus, particularly the
men's half, is extremely strong.
The Senators are a likable bunch
of schmucks, not too bright and
not too talented, but with a touching willingness to put the game
above drinking, late nights and
even (though with more reluctance) women.

Charlie Ellis 'OO and Steve
Salter 'O2 are particularly charming, and as a group they are all
strong singers and dancers. This
is a very male-oriented show, and
the women have much less to do,
but as girlfriends and fans they
find ways to periodically take
over the stage. Blair Cochran 'O3
and Meredith Hegg 'OO are hilarious as Meg's autograph-hound
friends Sister and Doris. Kean's
choreography is impressive and
all her dancers are very welldrilled; in addition, a tap number
choreographed by Rodney Morris 'Ol is really spectacular.
As Act I (by far the longer of
the two parts) continues,
Applegate's careful plans begin
to fall apart. Joe, too decent a guy
to be really good lost-soul material, just can't seem to forget
about his wife, and keeps going
back to his old neighborhood,
even renting a room in his own
house.
In a last-ditch effort to keep
Joe distracted, Applegate brings
in his man-eating sidekick Lola
(Abigail Stewart-Teitelbaum '01)
to make sure he has no chance of
being saved. Lola's two big numbers, "A Little Brains, a Little
Talent" and "Whatever Lola
Wants," are the two genuine hits
the score has to offer, and
Stewart-Teitelbaum makes the
most of them. In the first, she
high-kicks her way across the
stage in a totally revealing leopard-print bodysuit; and in the sec-

ond, she drives poor Gregory to

the brink of insanity with a slinky
striptease. Alas, for the sake of
the plot Lola has to become a
good girl in Act 11, and gets a lot
less interesting, but StewartTeitelbaum's brief interactions
with Melichar and Gregory still
light up the theater.
The second act deals rather
rapidly with the salvation of Joe,
his marriage and the Senators.
Melichar's lament for the past,
"The Good Old Days," presented
as a show-stopping nightclub
number complete with spotlight
and microphone, is the only real
time out. The book is a little anticlimactic
all the loose plot
threads of a 2 1/2 hour show are
tied up in the last 20 minutes
but with a splashy musical, the
story line is sort of unimportant.
What matters is the heart. And
fortunately, this production has
plenty of that.

More to 'Erin Brockovich' than boobs and long legs

By Morghan Holt

Phoenix Staff
The former Miss Wichita has two divorces, three munchkins and God knows
how many pairs of high-heeled shoes. She
is undereducated, unemployed, and getting

desperate. Dressed like she belongs on the
corner flagging down prospective clients
like she did in "Pretty Woman," Julia Roberts steps out in her latest role, reenacting
thetrue-life events of Erin Brokovich. The
sagabegins with Roberts, scantily clad and
looking sufficiently slutty, stumbling all
over herself as she botches another interview despite her push-up bra. Climbinginto
the rusted out Mazda that epitomizes her
welfare motherhood, the depressed
Brokovich is broad-sided by a speeding
jaguar, which lands her in the hospital and
then theoffice ofEd Masry, a stuffy, poorly
dressed lawyer who promises to win her
case.
Unfortunately, Brokovich screws that
one up as well. On the stand, she breaks
into a fuming furor, letting profanity get
the best of her, and consequently leaves the
courthouse empty-handed. Back to the
classifieds. A few more failed attempts at
employment and a resigning babysitter,
and Brokovich storms into Masry's office,
guilt-tripping him for her lost case and her
three fatherless children. She walks out
with a job. That's how Brokovich operates:
she's a stubborn, straightforward, no-nonsense woman who knows the power of her
prowess and uses it to the best of her ability. She's loud and indecent and doesn't
have a lot of manners, but she looks good
in her micro-mini skirt and 3-inch stilettos. This lady gets what she wants.
Maybe her "I-won't-take-your-shit" atti-

tude is the result of being twice divorced
and dumped with theresponsibility of supporting herchildren alone. Maybe she's too
used to backing down and making allowances for the men in her life. But it doesn't
really matter, because she's determined to
make something of herself, to create a life
for her children. All she needs is the right
opportunity.
She gets that opportunity, in a manila
folder marked "Pro Bono" and stuffed full
of real estate documents that Ed drops on
her desk. "Open this case," he tells her, and
she does. In doing so, though, she spots
something fishy. Not understanding why
medical documents are included in the file,
she asks her boss, who shrugs it off, tells
her it's not important. Without authorization or legal expertise, she sets out to investigate the case on her own, looking for
the suspicious motive she knows underlies
the $2B billion dollar Pacific Gas and Electric Company's desire to buy up all the
property in Hinckley, a sparsely populated
town in California. She finds many are suffering from tumors, ovarian cysts, chronic
nosebleeds, and several types of cancer.
So many in Hinckley are sick because

their water contains toxic chromium rus
inhibitor. Seeing the injustice coupled wit
the pain in the eyes of mothers slowly los
ing their children to chronic illness
Brokovich takes on the corporation, enlist
ing the help of a very reluctant Ed.
Erin's story is an uplifting tale ofhuman
ity, of spirit and determination, of an un
lucky woman succeeding against all odds
It chronicles the PG&E lawsuit, and main
tains the suspense of other law-relatec
films ("A Civil Action") without the direc
influence of a threatening pursuer. Julia
does an incredibly believable job of por
traying Erin Brokovich, proving there's
more to her than the boobs and long legs
of which her character's so proud.
This movie hit a tender chord with me;
was swept up in the intensity of what thi
lady almost single-handedly accomplishec
in the hundreds of lives she touched and in
her tenacity and self-sacrifice. It's more
than a movie about some impoverishec
woman and her lawsuit, though. It touches
on the universal theme of the compromise
in gender relations, finally putting the bal
back in the female court, and
illustrates almost too realistically the sad
structure of the
American class
system, as Erin
struggles to stay
afloat in the
never-ending
bills that her bonus promises
she'll never have
to fret over
again.

theTIGHTROPE of TENURE
From TENURE, pg. 13

knowledges, however, that "this is a difficult ambition to make real," in part because it would require similar institutions
to adopt the same policy.
Evaluating Tenure
Almost all the faculty members interviewed said t2nure enabled themselves or
others in their department to take risks
in their scholarship and teaching.
"The best part of tenure
is that it
makes you free to do things you wouldn't
if you had to get [a contract] continually
renewed." Burke said. While admitting
that his former untenured status did not
have a "particularly strong inhibiting effect" on him, he hopes to develop a new
course on digital culture and the Internet
that he probably would not have considered teaching prior to his tenure promotion.
In the sciences, faculty may engage in
a research project that takes longer to
produce publishable results than other
projects, according to Collings.
Instituted in the 1940s to preserve academic freedom, in recent years tenure has
come under attack from critics who say it
promotes a lack of flexibility and efficiency in institutions of higher education.
At Swarthmore, most of the faculty
members interviewed said they ultimately
support tenure, though not without some
misgivings.
Many faculty cited the original reason
...

for its inception as still valid in the academic community today.
"We'd be poorer as an institution and as
a country if we did not have the freedom
and ideas that come about as a result of
the institution of tenure," Jefferson said.
Although Keith admitted that the major pressures threatening academic freedom may no longer be political, certain
issues discussed in the classroom may incite controversy, such as gender or sexual
orientation.
Other faculty said tenure enables an
institution to have a permanent faculty,
which contributes to a sense of community and the overall quality of education.
Tenure also gives faculty the power to
criticize an administration they feel is
acting unjustly without fearof retribution.
But some faculty said they felt
ambivalently about tenure.
While acknowledging that the institution of tenure often protects innovative
academic research, Burke said that at
some universities it also may serve to punish non-tenured faculty by restricting the
type of research they can undertake if
they hope to get a tenure promotion.
"For [some] junior scholars, tenure does
the opposite of what it is intended to do; it
takes away academic freedom," Burke said.
Collings suggested that institutions
could benefit from an inflow of faculty at
all stages of their academic careers; however, this movement is discouraged under
the current system of tenure.
Echoing one of the most frequent criti-

Tenured Versus Non-Tenured
The faculty members interviewed
unanimously agreed that there is no negative dynamic between those whohave tenure in a department and those who do not.
Collings said he deliberately tries to
minimize the divide between non-tenured
and tenured physics professors by involving all faculty in departmental decisions

and responsibilities, including the participation of tenure track faculty in reappointment, tenure, and promotion decisions.
While Rablen does not feel that he has
less influence in decision-making within
the chemistry department, he is nevertheless conscious of his non-tenured status.
"As a junior faculty member, you always feel a littlereserved about what you
say in front of tenured faculty," Rablen
said.
In the history department, as in most
academic departments at Swarthmore
junior faculty do not sit in on tenure decisions. "[Non-tenured] faculty do not participate in the most central political decisions a department will make," Burke
said. Although this policy "makes sense,"
according to Burke, it also creates a "formal divide." Unlike their tenured colleagues, junior faculty members have not
yet faced the hurdle that will determine
their future at Swarthmore.
"There's a feeling of people sitting in a
room and deciding the fate of others,"
Burke said.
Despite any misgivings about tenure in
its current form at some institutions,
Burke said he appreciates the way in
which it has changed his relationship to
his department and to the college.
"There's a way in which people now talk
to you with an assumption of your permanence," Burke said. "Tenure makes you
into a citizen of the college in a way you
weren't before. It's an academic rite of

an in-depth look at the tenure process

cisms of tenure, several faculty members
said the institution makes it difficult to
remove tenured faculty who are not performing competently.
Nevertheless, the faculty interviewed
unanimously agreed that at Swarthmore
cases of tenured faculty not performing
as expected, if they exist at all, are rare.
With the exception of one review when
a faculty member is promoted to full professor, however, Swarthmore has no formal post-tenure review to gauge faculty
members' performance after they receive
tenure. The faculty interviewed were divided on the issue of post-tenure reviews,
with several professors advocating for
some form of post-tenure review and others maintaining that it was unnecessary.
Keith said a post-tenure review would
be "a very positive thing." She has discussed the issue extensively with faculty
and other "diverse channels" during
Swarthmore's long-range planning process two years ago.
"My hope is we could find a way to do
[post-tenure review] that would be appropriate for Swarthmore," Keith said.

the men and women played
together as a B team.
They played four games, going
a disappointing 1-3. Penn State
and University of Delaware defeated Swat 13-8, Haverford's A
[team won a close 13-10match and
Swarthmore manhandled their B
[team, claiming a 13-2 victory.
Despite the team's overall
record, there were several
'strong performances on the field.
Team leader Vincent Pallaver 'OO
lauded Misha Horowitz 'O3 for

spectacular defense, especially
against Delaware.
Brandon Silverman 'O2 had a
spectacular layout grab andalum
Tim Heffernan thwarted an opposing scoring threat with fullfledged effort. Also, Horowitz
complimented defense by
Pallaver and Patrick Hagan 'O2,
particularly Hagan.
"He played sky-high D versus
all teams' huck attempts," said
Horowitz.
This weekend will bring the
prestigious Easterns tourney
for the Warmothers in North
Carolina and a chance for redemption at Rutgers University against many of last
weekend's teams for the Earthworms. Both squads will be playing closer to full strength.

Swimmers make splash at nationals Women's lacrosse team
Sherer finishes seventh, receives All-American honors
keeps up winning streak
By Becca Howes-Mischel
Phoenix Staff

Swarthmore was the only team
in the Centennial Conference to
have both men and women represented at this year's Division
111 NCAA Championships.
Natalie Briones 'O3 traveled to
Emory University in Atlanta
March 9-11 for the women's
meet. Ted Sherer 'Ol followed a
week later, March 16-18, to compete for national honors. His efforts in the 100-meter breast
earned him All-American status.
Nine Garnet swimmers qualified for national consideration at
the conference meet. Based on
their performance at conferences, Briones and Sherer were
invited to attend nationals.
In Atlanta, Briones faced a
tough field as a freshman, but she

ended up with a lifetime best in
the 50 free (placing 34th), a 24thplace finish in the 100 breast and
a 29th-place finish in the 200
breast. After swimming a month
longer than most of the other
swimmers, she has ended the
season with three national cuts,
six personal bests, a pool, college
and conference record in the 400
medley relay, three conference
gold medals and countless dual
meet victories.
Sherer had some astounding
national swims that capped off an
amazing season. On the first day
of the meet, he placed seventh in
the 100 breast after being seeded
17th. This finish was a personal
best, which shattered his conference and college records and
earned him All-American status.
His 50 split of the 100 gave him
the college record. He followed

this swim with a 16th-place finish
in the 200 breast, which was good
enough to be an Honorable Mention Ail-American finish. He then
placed 44th in the 50 free. Sherer
not only set conference and college records with his times, but
he also set the college record for
the highest-scoring male swimmer from Swarthmore at nationals during head coach Sue Davis'
26-year tenure. With 13 points,
Swarthmore recorded the highest
finish ever at men's nationals.
This season Sherer has made
three national cuts, four college
records, one conference record,
one ECAC record and two conference gold medals.
Kenyon won both men's and
women's Division 111 nationals
for the 21st consecutive year for
the men and the 17th consecutive
year for the women.

Women's tennis starts conference
season with win over Washington
By Laura Brown
For The Phoenix

The Swarthmore women's ten-

nis team started their conference

season Tuesday, March 21, with
a 7-2 win over Washington College. In doubles, the No. 1 doubles
team of Jen Pao 'Ol and Laura
awerdlow 'O2 prevailed 9-7.
. This match was particularly
interesting to watch because of
the quality doubles points that
were played. The No. 2 doubles
team of Laura Brown 'OO and Fran

Gimonds 'O2 lost a close match 79 after coming back from being
down 4-7. At No. 3 doubles, Jamie
Flather 'OO and Katherine Voll 'O3
came out on top, winning 8-5.
In singles at the No. 1 position
Pao barely broke a sweat as she
impressively shut her opponent
out, 6-0,6-0. At the No. 2 position,
Simonds lost, 2-6, 3-6. Swerdlow
breezed past her opponent, 6-1,
6-1, at the No. 3 spot.
Tanya Chotibut 'O3, who missed
the doubles match because of an
exam, started off a little rusty be-

fore finding her range and taking down Washington at No. 4
singles, 3-6, 7-5, (7-4). At No. 5,
Flather prevailed in a long match
with intense rallies, 6-4, 6-7, (73). Both Chodibut and Flather
played a tiebreaker for the third
set because the team match outcome had already been decided.
Voll smashed her way to an easy
win, 6-1, 6-1.
The team will next face
Ursinus at home on Saturday,
March 25, and Johns Hopkins
away on Wednesday, March 29.

It was a sunny Saturday after-

noon, but excruciatingly cold.
Nevertheless, the ever-faithful

and supportive fans of the
Swarthmore women's lacrosse
team bundled up and headed out
to Cunningham Field to witness
yet another fine display of
athleticism against the College of
Notre Dame in Maryland.
Despite the cold temperature,
the Garnet soon turned up the
heat on the field. Mavis Biss 'O2
got the Garnet on the board first
with a tally at the 26:12 mark.
Kim Cariello 'O2 followed in hot
pursuit, picking up her first tally
just 17 seconds later. Mariam
Levy 'O2 contributed to the early
rally that soon gave Swarthmore
a 3-0 lead. Swarthmore led by an
impressive 15-4 margin at the
half.
Cariello scored five goals total,
while teammates Biss and Katie
Tarr 'O2 each added four tallies.
Jane Kendall 'OO had 11 saves in
goal and Jen Hart 'O3 had nine
saves to round out the collective
effort of the Garnet win. When all

was said and done, Swarthmore
had completed an 18-6 rout of
College of Notre Dame of Maryland.
Biss has been recognized for
her efforts and has been placed
on the Centennial Conference
Weekly Honor Roll. Biss scored
a career-high five goals with an
assist vs. Widener, then followed
that performance with a fourgoal, one-assist effort vs. Notre
Dame.
The Swarthmore women's lacrosse team has also made their
presence known in the Centennial Conference. Both Biss and
Tarr are among the top five in the
conference for scoring, both averaging 4.5 goals a game. Levy
and Cariello are also in the top
20 in scoring. Holding down the
fort on the other end of the field,
goaltender Kendall is leading the
conference with a saves percentage of 79.3.
The Garnet travel to Mt.
Holyoke College in Massachusetts this weekend for the annual
Seven Sisters Tournament.
They will play on Saturday at
11 a.m. and 3 p.m.. The gametime
on Sunday is yet to be determined.

student-athletes and eases their financial burden, if necessary. A
new structure should provide them with incentives to perform well
academically and earn their diplomas.
This is not a simple issue to resolve. If you are going to pay basketball and football players, are you going to pay wrestling, gymnastics and other non-revenue generating athletes? Just how much
should we pay athletes? Are they entitled to a share of the marketing or media fees?
These are tough questions, but they are ones that deserve resolution. In order to better protect player interests from the money sharks
that are agents and gamblers, a better support system must be implemented.

But think of how much money footbal

Weather prevents baseball comeback
By Scott Kushner
Phoenix Staff
Last Thursday the baseball team traveled to Lebanon Valley for what was
scheduled to be a nine-inning game. The
day got off to a bad start as the team arrived at 3:30 for the 3 p.m. game.
After a hurried pre-game warm-up,
Swarthmore stumbled out of the starting
blocks.
Swarthmore fell behind early, never
leading the game. Jay Schembs 'Ol started

a brief rally in the second inning with a
line drive double down the right field line,
coming around to score on a clutch single
by GeorgeRosenbaum 'OO. Scott Kushner
'O2 played a role in the other two runs,
driving in Rosenbaum and the scoring on
sacrifice fly by Carlo Fitti.
Through four and a half innings,
Swarthmore trailed 7-3 as a light drizzle
began to fall. The temperature was still
warm, and the rain was hardly perceptible, yet the home plate umpire chose to
call the game.
