Alum competes in current 'Survivor'
BY MENGHAN JIN
mjinl@swarthmore.edu
From being held up at gunpoint to
rescuing an injured rock climber
already 13,000 feet up a mountain in the
dead of winter, Marty Piombo 'B4 has
had anything but a boring life. And
now, at 48 years old, the Swarthmore

alum and former Yahoo! executive is
finally facing his ultimate challenge:
having his turn at trying to outplay,
outlast and outwit nineteen other contestants in the Nicaraguan wilderness
on CBS's long-running reality TV show,
"Survivor."
"I always thought that it was the
ultimate challenge both to combine athletic . . . endurance and the difficulties
limited food, no shelter, no clothing,
no amenities
with the psychological
aspect of the game," Piombo said.
Now in its twenty-first season, the
game of "Survivor" forces a diverse
group of 20 strangers to brave the harsh
conditions of uninhibited areas of the
world together for 39 days. One contestant is voted off each week, and at the
end of the 39 days, the last one standing
receives one million dollars and the
title of Sole Survivor.
"What does it take to win Survivor?
You need to use your brain; you need to
have heart; you need to use your body
and you need to use your gut for
instincts. And Marty has a marvelous
combination of those four qualities,"
longtime friend John Longley 'B5 said.
During
years
his
four
at
Swarthmore, Piombo, a political science major, kept himself physically
active by staying involved in athletics
on campus. He was a member of the
wrestling team and occasionally hurdled for the track team. "He's really
intense when he does stuff. He gets fully
immersed in it," friend and alum Doug
Humphreys 'B4 said.
Piombo's physical prowess will
prove helpful when contestants compete for rewards, such as food and comfort items, like blankets and towels, as
well as for their survival in the game,
Longley said.
Swarthmore also prepared Piombo
for the diversity of people he faced on
this season of "Survivor," with contestants ranging from a former NFL coach
to a dog trainer and from a goat rancher to a medical student.
"Going to Swarthmore helped me
psychologically fine-tune the way I
dealt with people," Piombo said. "There
are people from every walk of life you
can imagine [on "Survivor"], and the
ability to be both tolerant and accepting
. . . did help in that regard."
Friends remember Piombo as a very
funny and entertaining character in
college.
"He
was
hysterical,"
Humphreys said. "All the stuff that he
did
it was so clever and so intelligent that it was genius of itself but not
necessarily of the kind that would earn
him a good grade."
Classes at Swarthmore, however,
were not Piombo's strong suit. "I probably butted the system a little bit while
I was there," he said. "I could have been
a more applied student, let's just say."
Though professors and courses may
not have stuck with Piombo throughout
the years, the friends he made at

Marty Piombo joins "Survivor: Nicaragua" as a member of Espada Tribe.

Swarthmore have and remain to this
day his closest circle offriends.
It was, in fact, this group of friends
that convinced Piombo to apply to be a
contestant on "Survivor: Nicaragua."
"Marty was made for either television
or the movies in that he's got a largerthan-life personality. Marty . . . just
commands center stage," Longley said.
Since the show has just started to air
on CBS, Piombo was unable to divulge
any spoilers. He did say, however, that
what concerned him most was the possibility of other contestants perceiving
him as a villain, which could potentially work against him in the show. "I'm
sure I come off. . . as the guy that's too
smart for his own good
he's kind of
aloof; he's a corporate guy; he's worked
in big companies, managed a lot of revenues; he went to a fancy school and all
of that," he said. .
But Piombo went into the game with
a specific strategy in mind: build an
alliance with a group of women and be
calculatingly ruthless until he reached
the end.

with Entertainment Weekly. "I can see
him going for a while, though. Don't
know if he can win, don't know if he's
likable enough to win and don't know if
he knows that."
Wednesday night marked the season
premiere of "Survivor: Nicaragua" and
right off the bat, the twenty contestants
were split into two tribes based on age.
"This season's format of young versus old is perfect for Marty.
He still
has the ability to both think and act
like a college student. That said, he's
also matured into what will be an astucious player, both subtle and cunning.
That combination will serve him very
well," Longley said.
Piombo's friends have no doubt that
Marty will be a big player in this season's "Survivor."
"The question is not whether he'll be
a successful contestant. The question
is: will he go all the way and win the
million dollars?" Longley said. "My
money is on Marty."

Sharples replaces ceramics with melamine dishes

at Sharpies," Reed Coke 'l3

Allegra Pocinki Phoenix Staff

A sign on the microwave in Sharpies warns students not to heat their food on melamine dishes. Paper plates are provided instead.

BY LAUREN KIM

Meredyth
Duncan

showed a bowl she made to
her ceramics professor, and
said >that she is planning on
using it to eat at Sharpies,
since the dining hall provides
melamine dishware.
Beginning last semester,
Sharpies started making the
transition from ceramic to
melamine dishware, which
was complete at the start of
the new academic year.
Melamine is an organicbased chemical used extensively in making plastics and
laminates. It is a popular
choice of material due to its
initially moldable composition and sturdy final form.
Director of dining services
Linda McDougall said the
main reason for the decision
was based not so much on
financial factors as practical
grounds.

"Back when we were going
through the budget process, I
realized we needed to replace
the
existing
china,"
McDougall said. "I would not
say it had more to do with
cost-saving than with finding
more durable replacement

wares. [The melamine plates]
cost a little more, initially,
but their lifetime is generally
much longer than china."
McDougall
said
that
Sharpies still has a few
ceramic plates left, but that
the inventory is quite low.
The remaining ceramic dishware was added to the stock
for the Mary Lyon kitchen.
She further supported the
practical function of the
melamine plates by saying
that they were more convenient to deal with for the
Sharpies workers. She also
said the melamine plates last
longer.

"I checked around with a
lot of other nearby colleges
and they were using [the
plates] with a lot of success,"
she said. "[The plates are
also] better for the dish-room
crew, since they're not as
heavy. You'd have to really
slam them down to break
them. And they don't get as
hot as the china plates did."
However, there have been
some concerns regarding the
safety of using melamine
plates among the college community. One of the main concerns is the potential toxic

said. Twelve other students
who were approached shared
his view, saying that they had
not paid much attention to
the plates.

more caution, Sharpies has

although the ceramic coffee
mugs were also replaced by
melamine ones, paper takeout cups are still available for
use.
Jessica Holler 'll, in an
interview, spoke of the action
she had taken to avoid using
melamine dishware. She also
mentioned that she had done
much requesting on her part.
"I asked Sharpies if they
would let me use two or three
ceramic bowls," she said. "So
at every meal, I pick them up
from behind in the kitchens,
eat, wash the bowls, and then
put them back."
McDougall recalled the
occasion Holler had come to
speak to her about using
ceramic bowls.
She emphasized the point,
however, that Sharpies could
not accomodate every student
wishing to use ceramic 'dishware, especially with the dining hall's scant remaining
inventory.
Jesse Marshall 'll, representative of the Good Food
Project, however, had different concerns. He disapproved
of the fact that Sharpies' decision to use the dishware had
been relatively one-sided.
"I wish there had been a
little more discussion and
students,"
from
input
Marshall said. "I understand
you can't involve students in
every decision, but when it
comes to what we put our
food on, we should be able to
have more of a voice. The
Good Food Project would also
have had many suggestions."
The Good Food Project is a
student group that places priority on sustainable food
issues. Its members run an
organic garden and also work
closely with dining services.
McDougall asserted that
Sharpies remains aware of the
safety of its plates, and more so
for the sake of the whole community.

In addition, she pointed out
that the staff are also looking
out for their own health by
insuring the safety of the dining ware used in Sharpies
since students are not the only
ones eating their meals with
the melamine dishware.
"Just like if [a melamine
dish] were a piece of china, if it
looked compromised, the dish
crew would throw it out,"
McDougall said. "Obviously,
we're eating off the same plates
that everyone else is eating off
of too."

Swarthmore has long been
seen as an institution that
feeds, probes, molds and eventually grows curious minds. It
thus came as no surprise to
students and faculty that Unigo
named the college one of the
top ten schools in the country
where the pursuit of knowledge goes beyond the classroom. Yet, "intellectual" is not
the only word to describe
Swarthmore.

The ranking is amongs many
created by Unigo about colleges,
including top party schools, best
sport scenes, etc on the basis of
student votes. Unigo has been
cited by major news sources like
The New York Times and NPR.
Colleges are ranked on the website in various lists, based soley
on the votes and experiences of
actual students at these respective colleges.
For
"most

intellectual
schools," Unigo looked for schools
with students who spend all their

waking hours in the pursuit of

intellectual stimulation, ques-

tioning life, challenging the status quo and letting their curiosity

run wild.

Unigo picked its top ten
schools that accept and embrace
being a nerd from votes casted by
30,000 students across the country. Swarthmore was named one
of the most intellectual schools in

also agrees that Swarthmore is
an intellectual heavyweight
institution.
While
at
Swarthmore, he was part of a
group of students who occupied
the president's office as part of
the anti-apartheid movement in

compassionate, and passionate
people who believed they were
doing the right thing using their

intellectual foundation from
classes to further their own

be having their first formal meeting with StuCo
this academic year meeting on Sunday, Oct 3rd.
According
to StuCo,
Chopp wants only twenty

meeting. Of those, three
to four students should
"present ideas for what

September 16; 2010 :

Damon
incomparable
(the
lan
Somerhalder). The first season played

off the dynamic between the three of
them, creating a sort of love triangle
with Elena as the apex, and the second
season has upped the ante by throwing
in Katherine Pierce (also played by
Dobrev), the probably evil vampire,
beloved by Damon and Stefan, who
turned both brothers into vampires
and who happens to look exactly like
Elena. This conceit, which could have
been extremely off-putting, is made
awesome by the (always) excellent
writing and by Dobrev's tour-de-force
performance as both Elena and
Katherine. Nina Dobrev, I owe you an
apology; I totally questioned your acting ability in season one, but your portrayal of both the steadfastly loyal
Elena and the twisted sex-kitten
Katherine is amazing.
The real heart of the show, however, is Damon (who, coincidentally, was
just named the Ultimate Sexy Beast
by Entertainment Weekly, which is
great for him, but it's just appalling
that he beat
out Alexander
Skarsgard's Eric Northman from
"True Blood." Just sayin'). Those
who only know Somerhalder as
"Lost's" whiny, obnoxious Boone
are sure to be stunned, as I was,
when they see the way he completely inhabits Damon. His
quips are always perfectly
timed and delivered (and
what wonderful quips they
writers, you are
always are
my favorite), his eyes are playful
and naughty, and his heart is
absolutely and forever broken, which is currently causing him to do nasty things, like
break Elena's brother's neck.
(Don't worry, he lives. I won't
tell you how, but he does).
Somerhalder's performance is
wickedly funny and deeply tragic at the same time; it is truly
one of the best I have seen this
year.
I wish I had time to go into
the other myriad reasons that
"The Vampire Diaries" is my
favorite show about vampires
(I'm sorry, "True Blood," but this
past season was, with the exception of the epically fantastic
Russell Edgington, kind of a waste
of time, not to mention that Sookie
got really annoying really fast), but I
passed my word limit a while ago. I'll
just leave you with this recommendation: if you only do one thing on

my next article
will
address a wide scope of
tech-related issues, I want to dedicate this beginning-ofthe-semester article to a topic of extreme relevance forall
of you who have ever been subjected to the perennial
(and oftentimes ruthless and bloody) debate: Mac or PC?
I believe there is a very obvious solution to this debate,
although I have seldom seen it adequately presented
until now.
I will begin this topic with two disclaimers. Until the
age of 18,1 was a dedicatedPC user. I even took Microsoft
training classes for four years in order to become a
Microsoft-certified professional. I managed my high
school's network of 1200 PC-users and had a part-time job
as a PC consultant. Then, during my senior year, when
the deadline came for me to take my Microsoft test, something inside me imploded. Maybe it was one virusremoval or one blue-screen-of-death too many, but I decided to skip the test, quit my job as a PC consultant, invest
in a white Apple Macbook, and spend the next three
years of my college life in a state ofbliss. My second disclaimer is that my argument here is only going to be
worthwhile if your four-year college budget for computing can total at least $llOO. If you are limited to $3OO for
four years of computing needs, then a netbook is probably right for you. But from the moment you cross that
$7OO to $BOO threshold, I believe that Macs become economically viable.
Apple naysayers cite a multitude of factors for their
refusal to make the switch, including gaming and software compatibility issues, but the most common complaint is economic: Apple laptops simply cost more than
their PC counterparts. However, if you really wish to
make an economic decision, you need to factor in economic logic, which includes a little thing called opportu-

nity cost. Let's start, however, with basic up-front costs.
Apple's 13-inch Macbook Pro costs $1,099. Dell's cheapest
comparably-equipped Studio 14 laptop costs $859, a roughly $250 discrepancy. I'll first note that I've seen many students' parents veto Apple notebooks from cost concerns
and then proceed to spend the $ll9 for Microsoft Office
software and an additional $9O for a three-year subscription to McAfee Security Suite. That, of course, brings the
cost of your Dell notebook to $lO6B, which makes my

argument into one of aesthetics, which Macs will almost
always win.
I'm going to assume, for the sake of not presuming
anything about your or your parents' decisions, that
you're sticking with the basic $859 Dell with no Office or
McAfee upgrade. So let's see how opportunity cost can
cover that $250 difference. For all the non-economists out
there, opportunity cost is best described as the "next-best
choice forgone," which
means, for example, that

constant
philosophical disorientation characterized by the stripping-away of assumptions, the asking of big questions, the
thinking of new thoughts: "What is my
purpose? What's it all about? Is that a
cockroach on my bed or just an ink stain?
Wow, I really hope it's just an ink stain,

because the presence of that one cockroach would probably mean there's an
extended family living in the shoe at the
back of the closet that's been walking
around on its own," etc.

But perhaps the most profoundly disorienting element of all of this is the
extremely peculiar architecture. It's mostly the Science Center. It came to my atten-

tion, after a great deal of disoriented drifting, that it is possible to start off from any
location in any direction and walk in a
straight path to the Science Center. It
turns out that the Science Center is seven
miles long, covering the periphery of campus and zigzagging, periodically, across
the middle. The whole situation is a
ridiculously sinister one designed to spatially baffle beyond redemption helpless
first-years who need to get to the music
building.

The music building is mobile and travels around campus on an abstract schedule known only to worthy music majors.
The new and only slightly musical are
thus forced to chase after it, bouncing
wildly off the expansive walls of the
Science Center and careening around corners in time to catch faint chords disappearing. Getting to the music building
from, say, Willets, tends to take about
three hours.
Now that I've brought it up, we should
probably talk about Willets. Willets:
where the masses go to vomit, as we say
with affection, or Willets: we might have

mice, also people vomit, maybe the mice

vomit too, and often, Willets vomit. It's
actually not that bad; I haven't seen a

mouse vomit yet. The squirrels that hang
around tend to look a bit woozy, but the
squirrels are quite unpredictable all over
campus, displaying, most notably, an inordinate propensity for hopping. The other
day I was standing around being disoriented and waiting for the music building
to show up when this squirrel wandered
over, stopped and without warning, propelled itself a good four inches straight up
into the air.
There are two possible explanations for
this behavior. The first is that the squirrels have come to believe they are rabbits,
which is plausible because in that typically open-minded, Swarthmore style there is
a lot of rabbit-squir|

I would love to go along optimistically

Navigating the European transportation system

swarthmorephoenix.com

As I left the European
Union on a bus from
Przemysl, Poland to Lviv,
Ukraine, I found myself
surrounded by friendly
Ukrainians thrilled to meet
an American.
For the first time during
my trip, I decided to leave
my bags unattended, confident that the Ukrainian
tourists and smugglers
Japser Goldberg
would keep them safe.
Around the World
Besides, my thing's were
probably not more valuable
in 70 Days
than the goods that potentially (I saw-nothing) could
be hidden in the hollow walls and removable seats that
our bus boasted.
Before I had even entered Ukraine, I had already
decided that I prefer Eastern European transportation to
its Western version.
One returning Ukrainian tourist, Elene (Olena)
turned out to be fluent in English from her time in
California, and she invited me to continue on with her to
her home city of Kyiv. I had no reservations or plans for
Lviv, so after dinner we headed east on a third class
sleeper train and played durak, a Soviet card game, to
pass the time before the lights were turned off.
I slept with my passport, wallet and camera inside of
my pillowcase, but with 56 pairs of eyes in my train car,
again I didn't worry very much about my backpack.
As Elene was continuing on to Turkey, her friends
showed me around Kyiv and helped me buy my overnight
ticket to Odessa, a city in Southern Ukraine along the
Black Sea and near Moldova.
The next day, I caught a marshrutka (minibus) to
Chisinau, Moldova that I hoped would skirt the separatist region. The marshrutka was filled with cheery
Moldovans, myself, and another American named Yuri,
who had emigrated from Russia several years ago and
come to Ukraine to work as a missionary. At one point,
we crossed a sliver of the separatist region, but fortunately there were only Ukrainian border guards in this
border area.
Upon finally crossing into the part of Moldova controlled by the central-government, the marshrutka
stopped and Yuri and another traveler, Sergio, whose
nationality Yuri and I could not discern, invited me to
join them for vodka shots as everyone celebrated being in
Moldova.
The remainder .of the ride was quite bumpy, but we
soon reached Chisinau and found a place to stay.
. As it happened, we arrived in Moldova just before the
separatist region's (Transdniestria) independence day.
Along with two British travelers from my hostel, Yuri
and I decided it might be educational to visit a place that

considered itself a holdout of communism. It would be a
chance to travel back in time to a Soviet rally in Red

Square.
Unfortunately, Yuri forgot his passport and two
French guys from our hostel, who were sporting black
eyes from a night of irritating club bouncers, joined us
instead. A local student helped us fill out the entry forms,
and after a quick passport check we were allowed to enter
for 10 hours.
Despite the Transdniestrian border guards' reputation
for demanding bribes and being difficult, it was the shortest non-EU border crossing of my trip. Another local gave
us directions to the parade, and we quickly hopped onto
a marshrutka when the French guys turned their backs
to pee on a nearby building (never wise in a police state).
Our day in the separatist country was a mixture of
Pixar themed restaurants, ninjas on horseback, a sighting of their leader (Igor Smirnov, no joke) and soldiers
marching, dancing and riding Soviet tanks that I'm afraid
is far too surreal to fit in this article.
I next planned to travel from Chisinau to Sarajevo,
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the various options
seemed a bit confusing to me. So I bought a ticket on the
next marshrutka heading west, in this case, to Bucharest,
Romania. Start to finish, I spent two hours in the city,
which was roughly two hours too many. Although the

THEPMGENIX

city boasts a "Champs Elysees" deliberately built 6
meters longer than the one in Paris, the second largest
government building in the world (after the Pentagon),
and packs of wild dogs everywhere, I can't quite recommend the place.
After being cheated by the ticket agent, nearly cheated by a kiosk cashier, nearly pickpocketed twice, offered
"assistance" with the ATM by a stranger, and asked for a
bit of a "tip" by the

ticket collector, I final-

ly boarded the train to

independence and the Serbian army besieged Sarajevo.
The train route between the two cities reopened just one
year ago.

The freshness of the reopening became quite clear
during the nine hour trip. The trip required three locomotives (possibly four), four passport checks, four ticket
checks, and three crews. The delays weren't so painful
though, because the scenery was beautiful and the passengers friendly.

I woke up a few
minutes before we
arrived in Timisoara, which is the main advantage of
overnight trains. I spent a nice day in Timisoara with a
friend I met in my hostel. After a night in Timisoara, I
continued on to Belgrade, Serbia, and in Belgrade I

Coinciding with its centennial celebration, the
Players Club of Swarthmore is rejuvenating an
American classic with its performance of "The
Foreigner" by Larry Shue on Friday, Sept. 17. Tradition
is interwoven with novelty in this multi-faceted show,
permeating also into the cast.
The director, George Mulford, is a perfect example, as
a Player whose first season with the Club was in 1975.
Mulford was attracted to the play largely because of its
quirky characters and plot. "The Foreigner" focuses on a
backwoods lodge in Georgia, where several characters,
including an extremely shy man, categorized as a British
"foreigner" due to his silence, a closed-minded redneck,
and a whole array of characters come together and fight
against the lodge's demolition.
"['The Foreigner' is] one of those rare comedies where
the laughs arise from character rather than situation.
The situation the plot
is a flimsy thing, really, farcically absurd if you will, but the play isn't a farce,"

Mulford said.
Eric Crist, another seasoned Player, plays Reverend
David Lee. Crist believes that the way the play addresses

uproarious.
"[The play] is timely as well [due to] our focus on
America for Americans and our suspicions about those
who are not like us," Crist said. "It's [about] getting to
know and understand that which is differentand trying
to understand it rather than going with our preconceived

in every single line," DiLiberto
said.
Unlike Crist and Mulford, DiLiberto is new to the
Players Club. Mulford cast a selection of actors of various ages and experiences. Among these was DiLiberto, a
"young newcomer [who] nailed his reading for the [role
of Ellard]," Mulford said. Mulford was similarly excited
to cast T.J. Deluca as Charlie Baker.
"I was delighted to see [T.J.] audition, whose work I've
admired for years in both amateur and professional productions. He's my lead, and has been wonderful to work
with. He's cast rather against type, actually, and he's relishing the challenge," Mulford said.
Although the theater is not a professional theater
company, and the actors have different levels of experience, the whole cast is focused on producing an unforgettable, thigh-slapping evening. Since July, the cast has
attended three rehearsals a week.
"[During rehearsals, people] foqus in on their character when it's their time to walk through the door,"
DiLiberto said. Mulford also emphasized the complexity
of putting on a comedic performance and the need for
thorough preparation, as the play has had a celebrated
reputation in the past.
"The play has endured to become a staple of regional
and college theater," according to Mulford. "I think it's
going to be one of the evergreen staples of the American

On a local scale, just as "The Foreigner" has held a
pertinent position in American theatrical culture, so has
the Players Club in the Swarthmore-Springfield community.
"People from Swarthmore slip across the border to
have a good time," Mulford said. "But we also offer a
place where people... can exercise their artistictalents...
and where families can find an activity that engages
everybody."

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Monika Zaleska
Year: 2013
From: Narberth, PA
Current Residence: Willets
What She's Wearing:
"The pants are Cheap Mondays, and I got them from
Urban [Outfitters]," Zaleska said, adding that she found
them for "super super on-sale," a rarity since most Urban
Outfitters' clothing runs $6O and up. Her shoes are by
Blowfish Bootie, which she purchased at DSW, and her
bag is by Relic, which she found at a thrift store. "The
shirt I got at a vintage store in New Jersey," she said, "and
I made the earrings."
Zaleska's outfit is within the similar vein of other
Swarthmore students, favoring muted colors. Her handmade peplum blouse, with its simple color and floral
designs, is a throwback to the 60s and 70s, an era she particularly favors. She continues the muted palette with her
canvas and leather bag and charcoal Cheap Monday
jeans. But it's her shoes, for as simple as they may seem,
that are tres cool. The combination of moccasin and laceup boot evokes the fall's go-to item of lace-up shearling
boots. Her pairing of the traditional workman's shoe with
the delicate floral top creates a dichotomy of the tough
and the feminine.
How She Describes Her Style:
"I would say that I'm really into kind of the history of
fashion," Zaleska said. "So I like to, if not actually have
vintage pieces, have pieces that are inspired by the 60s
and 705." Zaleska turns to the 60s and 70s for her inspiration, but she also loves the 50s and 60s because of her
affinity for "poofy skirts" and "romantic clothing."
The return of the 50s marked numerous Fall 2010 collections, like Prada and Louis Vuitton, whereas the
recently revitalized Chloe and Marc Jacobs Spring 2011
collection embraced the high-waist flared pants and psychedelic palette of the 70s, respectively.

Fashion Influences

&

Inspiration:

"[l] like high-end designers that I could only dream of
owning, like Chanel, Rodarte, Miu Miu and Chloe,"

Zaleska said. Zaleska loves the look of the past, but her
modern and younger- designer choices evoke her similar

10

style: vintage with a modern edge.
Zaleska, like many others, looks
toward what others wear and enjoys
flipping
and
people-watching
through gossip magazines to see what
people are wearing. "In terms of other
inspiration, I really like patterns, and
I admire people who mix pattern and
color really well," Zaleska said. Art,
particularly folk art, is another source
for inspiration, as Zaleska likes "the
nuclear, little flower designs and
folk[s]y, country pieces."
•

Where She Shops:
Zaleska enjoys the thrill of "hunting"

for those perfect items at thrift stores.
"But I also really like Anthropologie,
again on sale, and I shop at Urban
[Outfitters]," she said. "I generally try to
look for good deals on things and try and
keep in perspective how much stuff is actually worth versus what the price tag says."
Like most people and college students, find-

ing quality clothing for cheap can be hard to
come by.
"On a budget, it's not always easy to get
like really nice quality clothes so you kind of
make sacrifices both ways," Zaleska said. "Try
and buy good things cheap, and then buy cheap

things that look really good." Sound advice.
Favorite Item In Her Closet:
"This [shirt] is actually my new favorite item
because it's handmade, and it's from the 605,"
Zaleska said. "I love that it has a history to it."
This is a testament to many who enjoy thrift store
shopping, as someone owned and possibly cherished the item before you create a connection to
that perfect dress or purse from Goodwill.
"Somebody made this shirt by hand to match the style
of the day, picked out the fabric and everything," she said.
"I found it randomly at this store when I visited my roommate over the summer, and it was $2O, and I got to hear
the whole history of the shirt when I bought it."

Going deep into the aesthetics of the everyday
ISAAC HAN

ihanl@swarthmore.edu

The nature of the everyday is cur-

rently under exploration at the List
Gallery.
The
exhibit entitled
"Aesthetics of Intimacy" seeks to

unravel truths in observations of
commonplace objects and places by
displaying works from artists Susan
Jane Walp, Mark Karnes and Don
Southard, whose paintings and drawings succeed in finding profundity in
the mundane.
"These artists found exploration
of still life as inspiration and sought
to discover relationships that can
speak to familiar experience as they
reveal truths about lighting and
color," List Gallery Director Andrea
Packard said.
Although the works presented in
the gallery are merely a small representation of their respective artists'
bodies of work, they highlight the
artists' predilections for experiencing and interpreting the commonplace in their own styles and view-

titled
another painting
In
"Inspired by the Tail of this Spanish
Radish" (2010), Walp highlights the
more jovial contrasts of the curved
tail that spirals more freely than the
stricter dimensions of the table and
plate on which it rests, and of the calculated placement of the bright
green "doublemint gum" wrapper
that adds a whimsical flavor to the
piece.

The deliberateness with which
Walp represents her perception is
the most fascinating aspect of her
work. The way she plays with the differences in the similarities of each
painting reflects the way she focuses
and utilizes the nature of the objects
she paints.
"Painting still life allows for a
contemplative and meditative element to painting," Walp said in an
interview.
Walp's paintings offer a way for
her to meditate about the everyday
and to present objects in a way that
inspire the peace and contemplation
with which she paints. The way that

America still blinded by religion in aftermath of 9/11

Rahma Salie may be Muslim, but the emotional scars
from the 9/11 terrorist attacks still run deep in her surviving family. She is one of an estimated 60 Muslim victims
who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, but little is said
or acknowledged of their losses today.
Salie, a graduate of Wellesley College, died with her
seven-month-old unborn child aboard American Airlines
flight #ll Her mother and family were not allowed to travel to her memorial because they were being interrogated.
Salie was raised in Japan, but her Muslim heritage made
her a suspect in connection with the terrorist attacks.
However terrible, forcing Salie's family to miss her
daughter's memorial was a justifiable act at that moment
in the name of national security and the frenzy that followed the attacks. But the hysteria virus spread. For the
past nine years the hatred toward and suspicion of the
Muslim world at large has seized hold of this country. It
has entered our books, movies, television, Internet, politicians, elites and most importantly our predominating religion.

Five days ago Muslims should have been allowed to
grieve alongside their fellow Americans, their fellow people. But there is a battle against Muslims, and the events
leading up to the anniversary of those horrible attacks
only served to epitomize how far wrong we have gone in
our response to 9/1 L Most notably, the sudden fame of a
small sect pastor, Terry Jones, and the blocking of a proposed Mosque two blocks from Ground Zero show a country headed away from its core values.
The answer to all these issues of bigotry seems simple
and, perhaps for some, self-evident: Accept one another.

For some, perhaps it's a washed-out phrase irrelevant in

this 21st century after two planes crashed into New York
City buildings, one into the Pentagon and another in
Shanksville, PA.
But the problem in America is that the status of this
nation as a Christian state with broad ideas about the
Islamic faith is putting the public at odds with being able
to identify Muslims as equal human beings.
Fervor over mosques and Qur'ans and other vague
"Muslim issues" that demagogues are gladly calling out in
the guise of American values highlight a sickening yet
increasingly present hypocrisy in American culture:
Those claiming they know what's tearing American civilization apart are, in fact, the ones who are doing so.
This nation has failed to learn that mosque-blocking
and Qur'an-burning only gives more ammunition to hate
America, a so-called city-on-a-hill that feels more like a
guarded mansion than a beacon of freedom.
People must identify their fellow human beings according to their actions, for their compassion or hatred, for
their true essence, instead of a generalizing factor like religion. For a country that supposedly teaches equality and
that prejudice based on the color of one's skin or beliefs is
bad, where did we go so wrong? Is this not a lesson we supposedly learned many years ago?
If a group wants to build a mosque near Ground Zero,
so be it. Evaluate proposals not from a religious standpoint, but from a practical one. There are people who are
Muslims, and there are people who are terrorists. Simply
because many terrorists follow an extremist form of the
Muslim faith does not mean all or even most of them do.
The Qur'an does not instruct humans to kill any more
than the bible or God told Pastor Terry Jones to burn it.

Perhaps it is a stealthy guise used by both sides to justify
acts of violence and disrespect, but at the core these are
human thoughts and actions. Strip away religion from the

core of this discussion, and the absolute ridiculousness of
the planned Qur'an burning and the opposition to a
Mosque near Ground Zero is evident to anyone willing to
open his or her mind.
Granted, some people, like Pastor Jones, will never
change. We can only hope that someday, with the leadership of people like Barack Obama and New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, these extremists will be
pushed further to the fringe.
This forces a re-framing of the 9/11 attacks. Yes, all of
the terrorists involved were Muslim, but that is an
extreme generalization. We must focus on more specific
connecting factors between the attackers, like extremism
and jihad, not the Muslim faith as a whole.
This can only happen through a broader public disassociation of politics with religion must occur. America
should not be identifiable as a Christian nation, but a
nation of people united under democratic ideals.
Religion has its purposes at the individual level as a
means of spiritual guidance, community-building and
instructions for how to live a healthy and fulfilling life, if
religion is a chosen course for those things. But religion
has no place as an identifying factor of a nation. It furthers
the belief that people who do not follow Christianity are
wrong. It does not allow space for Muslims to live in equality. And worst of all, people publicly pushing extremist
ideas in the name of Christian beliefs, like Pastor Jones,
are creating misconceptions about America in the same
way the 9/11 terrorists have created hatred in America.

Willow and Jaden are quickly becoming
household names, while college-aged cutie
Trey, born of Will Smith's previous marriage, is not on the Hollywood path.

can't be afraid to be yourself... Lots of people don't act like themselves, so they are
not happy," the adult child explained ofher
song's deeper meaning.
There is an increasing market for these
adult children, not only in mainstream
media but also in our everyday lives. What
more can we expect when we push college
in kindergarten and begin prepping for
SATs by middle school? One of the sad consequences of our urgent rush to speed kids
along is that some of the adultaiments that
plague our society manifest in our newly
formed adult children. This is clearly portrayed in another tween hit single "Pretty
Girl Bag" by the OMG Girlz. Tiny (T.l.'s
wife) and Toya's (Lil Wayne's ex-wife)
daughters rattle off a slew of designer bags
before boasting, "All the boys are on me
cause they see me poppin' tags. Girls stay
hatin' cause they lovin' my swag." Little
girls are socially ingrained to believe that
they must perform their femininity in a
way to fit male expectations at alarmingly
young stages of life.
We can add Justin Bieber to the grow-

ing number of children metamorphosing
into adults. Twelve thousand people sat
outside for two days to see the heartthrob
perform on the Today show this summer.
Paramount Pictures has made a deal to
turn his life story into a 3D film that will be
released next year. Bieber is only sixteen
but clearly sixteen is the new forty, the perfect age for a biopic.
With knowledge comes power, and if
children are figuring out of their own voli-

tion how to arm themselves with resources

to help them out of other adult-created
problems, like poverty and racism, maybe
being an adult child isn't all bad, but the
days of tugging on your mom's sleeve to
ask her where babies come from

will soon
become a distant dream. One of the implications of this expedited adulthood is that
children will inevitably have access to sex-

ual education like nothing we've ever seen.
It is a powerful tool for young people to
know about their bodies and particularly
for young women to be informed about
their reproductive rights. I just wonder
what childhood will mean in the years to
come as it takes on a new definition. When
hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, who recently signed
Willow Smith onto his record label Roc

Nation, called into Seacrest's program,
Seacrest asked him if he thought Willow
might be too young. "You have to start
somewhere There's no such thing as too
young," he said. Perhaps someone should
have forwarded Michael Jackson the
memo.

There has been much discussion of
the Inn project in the campus and local
press lately. As proposed,
the project would include
building an inn, a restaurant, possible residential
apartments, and a relocation of our
campus bookstore to a space adjacent
to the college's athletic complex and in
close proximity to the train station.
Since some of our students were not
here when this planning process began
and some new residents have moved
into the area, I thought it might be
helpful to lend some historical context
to the conversation.
In the mid-19905, there was growing
concern that Swarthmore might succumb to the decline afflicting the inner
ring of suburbs around Philadelphia. It
was felt that it was in the best interest
of town and college to understand the
issue and to plan proactively for the
revitalization of the Town Center business area.
The Borough's Town Center Task
Force then engaged Urban Partners
with Kise Straw and Kolodner to study
the issues. In the course of conducting
"a thorough analysis of the physical
and economic conditions of the Town
Center," they heard from over 900 members of the residential and college communities. In September 1999 they produced the "Swarthmore Town Center
Revitalization Strategy."
Thirty-four strategic elements for
revitalization were presented in the
report. They were grouped in six categories,
including improving the
appearance and circulation of Town
Center; promoting new development
activity; strengthening business activity; protecting residential areas adjacent to Town Center; promoting Town
Center development west of South
Chester Road; and encouraging an
inter-generational Town Center.
Some of the recommendations
such as the reconstruction of the Co-Op
and the creation of an economic develhave
opment position in the Borough
already been implemented. Other more
long-term goals called for the Borough
and the College to jointly pursue development of a high-quality, small-scale
inn and restaurant (approximately 65
rooms were suggested),
Soon after the report was issued,
subsequent discussions with the consultants led to the conclusion that a
restaurant with a liquor license had
the greatest likelihood of success. A referendum of Borough voters passed legislation enabling a liquor license at a
restaurant in the Borough on College
property.
The report also suggested that the
Swarthmore College Bookstore could
be relocated to a larger space in this
area, possibly in joint development
with a restaurant. Should this happen,
the bookstore would move with its current management team in place and
every effort would be made to maintain
the very comfortable, down-to-earth
feel our community so enjoys. There
are no plans, as I've heard suggested
recently, to "sell" our bookstore to a
large chain.
Further, the report recommended a
new south college entrance at Rutgers

Avenue and S. Chester Road that would

not only formalize what has been a sub-

tle connection between the Borough
and College, but also provide safer, easier access to and from the area by
motorists and pedestrians, and
improve overall circulation in the
Town Center.
While it is not unusual for such projects to take years, even decades to come
to fruition, this project was further
delayed due to changing economic conditions.
Then, this past spring, the Borough
was awarded $2 million through the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's
Redevelopment Assistance Capital
Program (RCAP) to pursue the
Swarthmore Town Center West project
with the College. The state grant was
awarded by Pennsylvania Governor
Edward G. Rendell and enjoys bi-partisan support, with assistance from both
State Representative Bryan R. Lentz
(D) and State Senator Ted Erickson (R).
It is now time for a developer (or
developers) to come forward with a
concrete proposal. That plan would
need to move through the appropriate
legislative process, including submission to the Borough Planning
Commission, the County Planning
Commission,
the
Environmental
Advisory Council, the Delaware
County Conservation District and
Borough Council. It is only after extensive community discussion and ultimately legislative action taken by
Borough Council that a final decision
will be made about the Inn project.
There has been and continues to be a
commitment to keep the community
informed of any development activity.
There will be open forums initiated by
the Borough going forward, in which
the College will participate. The
College community will also be
engaged through open forums and
informed conversation and debate.
There is already great passion surrounding this project. Proponents
believe the project will result in more
jobs for the area; provide an economic
engine to the retail district; create new
tax revenues for the Borough, the
School
Wallingford-Swarthmore
District, and the Commonwealth; provide a place for parents, friends, and
visitors to stay while on campus; and
create an enhanced sense of community between and among College and
Borough residents. Others are concerned it may further erode green
space; hinder existing retail outlets;
create the possibility for public safety
and health hazards; and not be economically viable.
I hope that as the weeks and months
unfold, and once there is a more concrete proposal to respond to, we will
collectively honor what has been a
longstanding tradition in the Borough
to study the facts;
and at the College
to listen respectfully; to engage passionately; and to analyze all elements
of the plan before reaching an informed
conclusion about it.
I look forward to many more conversations about this as the project, long
ago identified as an important part of
Swarthmore's economic future, moves
from "concept" to "proposal."
Stuart Hain is the Vice President for
Facilities and Services of Swarthmore
College.

leaders in an
unexpected

late-season
push to the
top of the
standings and were scheduled to play a
four-game series against none other than
the current NL West leaders, the San
Diego Padres. It was September baseball at
its best, and it did not disappoint (well,
unless you are a Padres fan, in which case
you should stop reading this column).
But what really surprised me in last
week's series was not that the Giants took
three offour games after an embarrassing
record of one for nine against the Padres
earlier in the season or that Tim Lincecum
made up for an abysmal August with a
solid outing on the mound while contributing a two-RBI single in game four.
Instead, it was an offhand remark made in
game two that had me confounded.
With the game still tied in the seventh,
Aubrey Huff came to the plate as the leadoff hitter for the Giants. Clayton Richard
lost control of one of his pitches inside and
ended up hitting Huff on the elbow. As
Huff did the Fm-trying-not-to-cry-onnational-television dance towards first
base, the commentators shrugged off the
injury, saying, "It's OK, he's Texas-tough."
This struck me as odd. What exactly is
Texas-tough, and, if it can make being hit
in the elbow by a 90 MPH pitch hurt less,
where can I buy some? Although I'm sure
this comment was simply supposed to fill
the time until the next batter stepped into
the box (for those who care, when he
stopped jumping around, Huff eventually
stole second and scored the only run of tne
game), it is representative of a much larger tendency for sports commentators to
inherently portray American athletes as
tougher and more hard-hitting than athletes from other backgrounds. It makes
sense that a country that so prizes individuals working their way to the top would
also prefer athletes who play through anything, but it is unclear to what extent
American athletes have actually established themselves as the world's toughest
competitors and how much of this reputation is simply whatAmerican fans wantto
be true.
This perception of tough American athletes becomes most prevalent in highprofile international competitions like this
summer's World Cup. Many fans in the
States took offense at the acting jobs many
international players put on to get fouls
called. "Maybe the world accepts the complaining and thrashing around on the
ground, but it goes against the general
sports culture found in North America," a
July San Jose Mercury News article
reported on the subject. Faking an injury
to get a call, according to this journalist,
was simply un-American.
This attitude can even be seen in fringe
areas of the sporting world. The New York
Times Magazine in July looked into the
future of jousting in the US. Participants
were worried that -there was not enough
contact to draw American crowds. "The
sport of jousting is only going to survive in
the United States if there is that ferocity in

THE PHOENIX

it," the article said. "If it is just a bunch of
guys hitting each other with balsa-wood
lances, the only people going will be the
Renaissance crowd."
While I question how many people are
really going to show up to jousting competitions even with more contact, it touches
on the heart of the toughness debate: it is
not that the athletes are inherently more
aggressive, but rather that American fans
demand blood, sometimes literally, in
exchange for their support.
Rodney Fort, in the Scottish Journal of
Political Economy, discusses the possibility of differences between North American
and European sports. Although he is not
convinced of many differences between
sports on the two continents, he does look
at how fans may differ in their approach to
the teams they support. He suggests that in
North America, teams have to compete
with a variety of other forms of live entertainment and thus American fans demand
a show for their attention. Certainly it is

true that the aggressive nature of sports
distinguish them from other live TV programs like Dancing with the Stars (I for
one would be much more likely to watch if
dancers were allowed to tackle each other
in between dance sets).
Unfortunately this is not a subject that
lends itself to empirical study. Even comparing foul rates between American teams
in international competitions in sports
like soccer and hockey fails to show the
mental and physical toughness many

claim is the heart of American sports. The
only way to truly demonstrate this point is
to have more international play. American
teams over the last year have been amazingly successful in world competitions. US
hockey won silver at the Winter Olympics,
US basketball just won gold at the World
Championships in Turkey, and while the
American World Cup team might have
exited the competition too early for their
liking, they still managed to get a nation
notorious for not being soccer fans cheering as loud as ever for them. The success of
these teams should encourage organizers
and players in the top tiers of sports to
look not just at national Competitions as
the pinnacle of their careers, but dream
even bigger and put that American toughness to the test.
Story time with Aubrey Huff
During this past spring training, Giants
hitter Aubrey Huff became mesmerized by
teammate Nate Schierholtz's ripped abs.

So he did what anyone would have: took a

picture on his cell and sent it to his wife
with the text, "Look honey, I've been working out!"

Huff and Giant's teammate Pat Burrell
were also teammates at the University of
Miami. Huff, in his first few weeks there,
was not very happy and wanted to go
home. While talking with his mother in
his room one day, he got an unexpected
visitor. "There is a knock on the door, and
before I can even get off the bed, Pat comes
barging in with a six-pack in his hand,
dripping wet, buck naked." After that, how
could Huff not stay? This story was then
published in an article right before Burrell
returned to play in Philadelphia, where he
won a World Championship last season,
only now wearing a Giants' uniform. Of
course Phillies fans took this opportunity
to nag him about the story from the
stands. Quite unexpectedly, Burrell turns
around to the fans and says, "Actually, it
was two six-packs." Only in Philadelphia
would fans be able to nag a player enough
to get a response.

Swarthmore's head men's soccer
coach Eric Wagner calls the Centennial
Conference "the toughest conference in
the nation." The Garnet proved that it
is ready for a grueling conference campaign with key victories over two previously unbeaten teams
Widener and
this past week.
RPI
Last Wednesday, the Garnet traveled
to Chester to take on an undefeated and
upset-minded Widener. Swarthmore
and Widener are familiar, but far from
friendly, foes. Each year they face off in
the "320 Challenge" and share the
Swarthmore turf for the Garnet Alumni
Classic. Widener assistant coach
Brendan Grady was an all-Centennial
defender at Swarthmore, anchoring a
defense that led the Garnet to the 2007
ECAC championship in his senior season.
The proximity of and familiarity
between the two schools combined to
create an atmosphere of true rivalry.
Feeding off their rambunctious home
crowd, Widener seemed ready to challenge the Garnet, but two early goals off
the foot of Roberto Contreras IV 'l2
crushed the Pride's lofty spirits.
Eight minutes in, Contreras applied
pressure to a Widener defender inside
the box. After the defender failed to
clear the ball, Contreras quickly poked
the ball into the net. Just seven minutes
later, Morgan Langley 'll blew by a
defender and was dragged down outside
the box for a free kick. As the Widener
defense protested the call, Contreras, at
a full sprint from the midfield, placed
the ball and curled it over Widener
goalkeeper Jakub Valdner's head for a
2-0 lead.
Contreras' goals were certainly
opportunistic, but Wagner asserts that
luck played no part. Good teams create
their own chances and take advantage.
"I've never seen a player as 'switched
on' as [Contreras] was against
Widener," Wagner said.
If Contreras' early goals took the
wind out of Widener's sails, David
D'Annunzio 'l2 chopped down their
ship's mast. In the 19th minute,
Widener earned a penalty kick and
seemed poised to get back into the
game. Drew Hilinski took the kick and
tried to surprise D'Annunzio with a
one-step drop, but D'Annunzio dove
right and swallowed up the attempt.
Wagner wasn't surprised. "I had a gut
feeling [that D'Annunzio would make
the save], but I didn't want to say anything. After that, they lost most of their
belief that they could hang with us."
Two minutes after D'Annunzio's PK
denial, Langley scored his third goal of
the season on a long assist from Pierre
Dyer 'l2. In the second half, Micah Rose
'l2, Swarthmore's All-Region midfielder, would enter the 2010 scorebook in
convincing fashion. Off a feed from
Ayman Abunimer 'l2, Rose launched a
left-footed rocket into the upper corner.
Widener's Dan Lorenzet's header in the
77th minute made the final tally 4-L
While the atmosphere surrounding
Widener's game was reminiscent of a
Centennial Conference game, Friday's
matchup with RPI more closely simulated the level of competition that the
Garnet will face during their rigorous
conference schedule. The Engineers
reached the second round of the NCAA
tournament in 2009 and knew that a win

September 16, 2010

-

over the Garnet would propel them into
the national spotlight.
The Garnet midfield, dominant in
the first three games, met their match
against RPI. "RPI played great possession soccer. In the first half, their midfield gave us problems," captain Gage
Newman 'll said. The Engineers' pressure took the Garnet away from its
game plan, forcing them to try to connect on long balls over the top, leading
to seven offside calls.
The officials allowed the RPI defenders to be physical with Swarthmore's
forwards. RPFs back line used its size
and strength to prevent the electric
Langley from turning into space.
Swarthmore's All-Region forward was
held without a shot for the first time
since the Garnet's loss to Amherst in
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament

in 2008.
Other than two dangerous shots by
including one that
Fabian Castro 'l2
RPI held the
rang off the crossbar
Garnet at bay for the first half.
To start the second half, the Garnet
returned to its game plan, possessing
the ball in the midfield and playing
through Rose in particular. This created movement and opened up more
attacking options. "Most of the guys on
the field [against RPI] had experience
winning close games like that, so we
knew what we had to do," David
Sterngold 'l2 said. The Garnet and the
home crowd of 500 could feel the
>
momentum shift.
In the 59th minute, the Swarthmore
attack broke through. Kieran Reichert
'l3 took the ball up the left sideline and
curled it across the box, drawing RPI
keeper Alex Penny out of the goal and
finding a darting Sterngold, who headed home the game winner. For
Sterngold, it was the 14th goal of his

career.
The assist was the first of the season
for Reichert, who has been impressive
early on, taking over at outside midfield for the graduated Dylan Langley.
"Coming out of halftime, we knew what
we had to do, that if we kept all guns firing, something has to break our way,"
Reichert said.
Yesterday, Swarthmore hosted St.
Mary's of Maryland in another
non-conference matchup, coming away
with a 3-1 win to improve to 5-0 overall.
Langley opened the scoring for
Swarthmore on a penalty kick midway
through the first half. Langley, on a
breakaway, was taken down by the St.
Mary's keeper. He calmly drilled his
first career penalty-kick into the lower
right corner of the goal to light the
scoreboard and energize the home
crowd.
Just minutes later, Castro would
make the score 2-0, finding a ball in the
box after a touch from Langley and
scoring in the lower left. Langley's
assist was the 18th of his career, the
most in program history.
Pierre Dyer 'l2 would add his first
collegiate goal to make the score 3-1

before the half.
The Garnet expects to see both the
hostile atmosphere of the Widener
game and the highly competitive soccer
of the RPI game this weekend at Johns
Hopkins. Wagner
said that the
Centennial Conference opener will be
"one of the best games of the year,
nationally. If we have national aspirations, we've got to go through Johns
Hopkins."

While the Lions were winning the
Mayor's Cup this weekend, other Ancient
Eight men's soccer teams were busy making noise on the national stage. Harvard

maintained its No. 6 spot in the National
Soccer Coaches Association of America
rankings this weekend, while Penn
climbed into the top 25 with victories over
George Mason and Lafayette.

John McMinn and Jacob Phillips (above) run in the annual Swarthmore Alumni
Meet held on Saturday. Stephanie Beebe, Emma Saarel, Becky Painter, Melissa
...Frick and Isabel Newlin (below) walk on the track before the race.
Four sophomores and two freshmen were the top six finishers in
the men's cross country team's 36th
annual alumni meet as the current
Swarthmore runners defeated the
alumni by a score of 15-48 on
Saturday. Running at home for the
only time this year, sophomores
John McMinn and Jacob Phillips
ran the 5K course in 16:52, finishing
just ahead of classmates Aidan
DuMont-McCaffrey and Bill King.
Robert Fain 'l4 rounded out the top
five with a time of 17:06.
This is the second consecutive
year in which McMinn, Phillips,
and DuMont-McCaffrey finished as
the top three runners in the' alumni
meet, as DuMont-McCaffrey set the
pace last year with a time of 16:54.
Ross Weller 'OB was the top finisher for the alumni with a time of
17:23, good for seventh-best overall.
Dan Hodson and Erik Saka, who
both graduated in 2009, returned to
run times of 18:14 and 18:15 respectively. In theirfirst race as alumni
a year ago, Saka ran the course in

17:42 with Hodson finishing in 17:5L
On the women's side, the Garnet
bested the alumni in 2010 after
falling by a score of 27-28 a. year
ago. First-year Emma Saarel led
the way for the women, finishing

the race with a time of 20:17. She
was closely followed by Rebecca
Woo 'll, who finished in 20:22.
Sophomore Rebecca Hammond
(21:28) and juniors Melissa Frick
and Hannah Rose (both 21:29)
rounded out the top five female finishers, as the current students
placed the top seven runners on the
women's side.
Melina Healey 'OB was the top
finisher for the female alumni, running the course in 21:38. She was
followed closely by Isabel Newlin
'l3, who is running cross country
this year after playing soccer as a

first-year.
Both the men's and women's

cross country teams return to
action on Saturday at the
Dickinson Long/Short meet. Races
are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.

Harvard
On Saturday the No. 6 Harvard men's

Field hockey looks to build off two tough losses
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS
aapostol@swarthmore.edu
After posting a 2-0 record for the first time since 2006,
the Swarthmore Garnet field hockey team dropped a 2-1
heartbreaker to Widener on Saturday. Widener pulled out
the victory with a goal with three minutes to play, but even
the loss was not without its bright spots for the up-and-coming Garnet.
The one Garnet goal was scored by forward Nia Jones
14. . Fellow first-year Aarti Rao and Sophia Ferguson 'll
added assists. Still in the early part of the season, the interplay of veteran presence and youth has already started to
make an impact on the field hockey team.
"I haven't felt out of place or isolated, which I was worried about before school started," Jones said. "[The upperclassmen] have been so welcoming and helpful. I feel that
we have been working pretty well together.... It's relatively early in the season, so it can only get better," Jones
added.
Jones' confidence in the young team's ability is shared
by her teammates. Defender Anne Rosenblatt 'l4 said of
the first-years on the team, "I think we've done a good job
of integrating ourselves."
Of the on-field challenges first-years face, she said the
transition to college play has been a successful one. "We
have all adjusted pretty well. I know we were all pretty
nervous during the first game," she said, "but once you
start playing you kind of just forget about the nerves and
focus on the game."
The early success of the first-year players has not been
lost on the upperclassmen. Goalie Katie Ashmore 11, who
recorded five saves on Saturday, said that the "freshmen
have been playing just as many minutes as the older play-

ers [this season], and [they] have really risen to the challenge before them."
Singling out the work ethic of goalie Gabriella Capone
has been working really hard to
'l4, she said, "Gabby
adjust to college play. For goalkeepers, there are some big
differences between high school and college play and she is
amazingly determined and intentional in her approach."
Coming off a stretch of seasons in which losses were not
uncommon for the Garnet, the 2010 squad already sees
marked improvement from last season in many facets of
the game. Already, there has a significant shift in attitude
...

from last year.
"Our team has been bonding really well both on and off
the field," said midfielder Taryn Colonnese 'l3, who is currently second on the team in goals scored with two.
"Our team this year seems much more cohesive; we
have much better communication on the field, which has
greatly improved the way we play with each other. We are
playing much more as a team than we have in years past,"
Colonnese added.
While the team's freshmen may not have last year's
experience to compare with this year's play, there is overall agreement on the exceptional ability of this year's team
to communicate and work as a unit.
"The team is very good in pointing out and fixing whatever is going wrong in team play," said Rosenblatt.
"Everyone is there for one another and as a team, we are
very good at supporting one another and communicating
throughout the play."
On Tuesday, the team visited Elizabethtown for a nonconference matchup with the Blue Jays. After going down
1-0 early in the first half, Katie Teleky 'l3 scored her first
goal of the season, the 10th of her collegiate career, off a
penalty corner to tie the game at one.

But the Blue Jays would run off three straight goals en
route to the 4-1 victory, dropping the Garnet to 2-2 on the
season.
While the team's 2010 schedule promises to bring many
further challenges, the Swarthmore women feel as though
they are well equipped to adjust as is necessary to handle
anything that comes their way.
Ashmore believes that this flexibility has been the most
prominent impression that she has gotten from this year's
team through the first four games of regular season play.
"As a team we are capable of implementing changes to our
game during play," she said, "[and] after halftime you can
see a marked differencebased on feedback from our coaches. This will be a big asset to us as we move forward this

season."
The team is confident in its ability to bounce back from
two tough defeats in fact, it looks at losses as motivators.
"I think we will work even harder now," Jones said. "It
didn'tfeel good to lose, especially when it was such a close
game [on Saturday]."

Rosenblatt added, "I think we all know [we have the]
ability to be better.... I think the team will only learn from
it and go out stronger in the upcoming games."
With this drive and work ethic in place, it is not hard to
envision a 2010 Garnet team thatfar exceeds expectations.
"This season we have been proactive in identifying our
challenges as individuals and as a team early on," Ashmore
said. "I think this foresight will serve us well. Swarthmore
hockey has never been in a better position this early on in
the season. I know we can build off of the lessons we
learned in our loss[es]... in our next couple of games."
Swarthmore returns to action on Saturday when
Eastern visits Clothier Field for a noon contest. The
Garnet also plays on Sunday, hosting Drew.

is history,
I'd like to go a little further: what, if anything, do we know right now? While I
waited for Peter King's conciliatory email, here are a few things, in no particular order, that I think we know one week
into the season:
Sidney Rice Will Be Sorely Missed:
If someone had told you right before

kickoff that the Saints would hit Brett
Favre just four times, sack him once,
rush only three men at him on half the
plays, score 14 points and still win the
game, you'd probably think they were
talking about the 2005 version. The New
Orleans cornerbacks, Tracy Porter and
Jabari Greer, are good players, but in last
year's NFC Championship the Vikings
passed for more than 300 yards against
this same defense plus Darren Sharper,
arguably their best defender. In that
game, however, the Saints were preoccupied with Rice, by far the Vikings' best
downfield option, and it freed up Bernard
Berrian and tight end Visanthe Shiancoe
to have big games.
Thursday was an early preview of
what Rice's absence

will
mean to this offense. Shiancoe had an
excellent first half, catching four balls
and scoring Minnesota's only touchdown,

v

'.

ft ."I 1

but this time the Saints could afford to
adjust and sent safety Roman Harper
over to shadow him for the entire second
half. Shiancoe never had another reception, Berrian was shut down by the corners (1 catch, 3 yards), and Favre went 5for-13 in the second half for only 51 yards.
The silver lining for Minnesota is that
Rice has an outside chance to come back
in November. Right now he, not Favre,
looks like the piece the Vikings need to
make the Super Bowl.

If You Underestimate Wes Welker (or New
England), You Are an Idiot:
Wes Welker was simply going to watch
the Patriots play Cincinnati from home

on September 12
or so everyone said,
after Welker suffered a devastating knee
injury in the last week of 20Q9.'
The only one who didn't seem particularly convinced of that was Welker, who
immediately started chipping into people's forecasted return dates. Slowly, the
line went from "his 2010 season is in jeopardy" to "he'll miss the first six weeks,
then come back" to "if he does manage to
play Week 1, it'll take some time for him
...

to adjust."
Eight catches, 64 yards and two touchdown receptions later, Welker is back,
and so are the Patriots, who on Sunday
resembled the 2007 model that broke

every offensive record in existence. The
same talking heads who ruled Welker out
for week one fell over themselves explaining why the Jets and Dolphins, not New
England, are the new forces in the AFC
East. It's only been one week, but the
Patriots didn't waste any time reminding
everyone who has won that division six
out of the last seven years.

The Steelers Defense Doesn't Care That
Ben Roethlisberger Isn't Here:
sth, Ist, Ist, 9th, 4th, Ist. These num-

bers don't just represent how I've placed
in the six blueberry pie-eating contests

I've entered in my lifetime. They're also
the Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive rankings for each of the last six years since
Dick Leßeau took over as coordinator.
Pittsburgh's offensive rankings for those
last six years: 7th, 22nd, 17th, 7th, 15th,
16th. Leßeau, more than anyone else, has
been the reason why the Steelers are able
to overcome inconsistent offensive play
and continue to win year after year.
On Sunday, that defense proved that it
was more than capable of compensating
for the franchise quarterback's absence
with an impressive performance against
a potent Atlanta offense. Holding the
Falcons to three field goals and even forcing a punt in overtime, the Steelers
showed that Roethlisberger's suspension
doesn't mean easy wins over Pittsburgh
in the meantime.
The Steelers have their work cut out
for them against Tennessee's Chris
Johnson next week and the Ravens in
Week 4, but Leßeau's is the one defense
that can even think about making Dennis
Dixon an undefeated quarterback in that
span.

The 'Donovan McNabb Era' Will Be A
Work In Progress:
To say that Donovan McNabb "beat"
the Cowboys on Sunday would be a little
like saying that the Canadian army
"beat" the Axis in World War II; they
were there, and their side won, but...
In this case, the numbers can actually
tell the story pretty well (15/32,171 yards,
63.4 rating, 3 of 13 on third-conversions),
but you had to actually see the game to
get the full picture of just how off
McNabb's chemistry was with everyone
not named Chris Cooley and Santana
Moss.
Washington's new quarterback was
able to put together a couple of nice
drives, but missed targets, drops, and bad
timing was the story for a Redskins
offense that was responsible for only six

Septetrobsr.l6, £010...

points all night. All signs point to
McNabb still having enough left to make
the Redskins a significantly improved
football team, but if Sunday night was
any indication, the defense will have to
carry the load for a few weeks while

McNabb takes control of this offense.
Guess The Jets Aren't Going To Win The

Super Bowl After All:
That sound you heard was about half a
million overzealous Jets fans pumping
their brakes after New York lost to the
Ravens on Monday night. If you thought
Washington's offense looked out of sync
Mark Sanchez passed for 74 yards, the
Jets didn't convert a third down until
their final 'possession, and the Jets
offense ran a total of 37 plays. In the
entire game. Somehow, that unmatched
ineptitude would not have been enough to
doom them without the help of 125 yards
given up on penalties. Final Score:
Ravens 10, Jets 9.
The hype-induced illusion that a team
who can't pass the ball will win the Super
Bowl in 2010 has dissolved, and now the
Jets have to go up against New England,
who put up thirty-eight points against
Cincinnati last week. It certainly looks
rough, but fortunately for the Jets, New
