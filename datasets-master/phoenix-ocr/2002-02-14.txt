New MC dean

Ending a sporadic ten-year quest to hire a permanent associate

Feb. 1 A graduate of divinity school, he spent six years as associate chaplain at Brown, facilitating discussions on race and conducting religious services. The Harvard Graduate School of
Education employed Smaw as associate dean for program development until he was selected for the position of the "multicultural

take an assessment of the
student community. After meeting with student organizations and
examining what current programs exist, then determining other
opportunities to involve the students who are either on the periphery or who don't see themselves as being fully involved in order to
really develop a more diverse community. And sometimes this is
very easily accomplished by building more on current programs.
Other times one has to be more intentional and go after certain
groups or individuals to build alliances. Over the next spring term,
I'll be meeting with student organizations to get a sense of what
opportunities would they like to see for the development in terms of
their own programming and outreach.

The globe, a favorite of students, sits on the third level of McCabe. An electrical motor used to power
the globe's rotation, but it broke in 1976 and has yet to be repaired because no one knows how to fix it.

The world is not enough
The college hopes to find a new home for the Rand McNally
Geophysical Globe before renovating McCabe in 2003
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

Everyone who comes to Swarthmore knows the
globe on the third floor of McCabe Library.
Prospective students on admissions tours see it on
their walks through the library. And many students
have pointed to their home town, state or country at
some point during their four years at the college.
But after the summer of 2003, students will most
likely never see the globe again. With impending
renovations calling for more space for study areas,
the library is looking for a suitable organization to
provide a new home for the globe, opening up space
in the library.
"It really just boils down to the fact that the globe
is using prime real estate," College Librarian Peggy
Seiden said. "Right now, we really have to look at
what students need most, and this includes more
study space available for group studying."
The globe has a storied history. A Rand McNally
geophysical globe 75 inches in diameter, the globe is
a view of the Earth as seen from approximately 7,000
miles in space, according to records. Originally,
Rand McNally manufactured these globes in the '6os
for use in NASA training programs. However, in the
late '6os and early '7os, the company made numerous
globes for

educational institutions.

SPAC concerned about
student record privacy
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

nbrundal@swarthmore.edu

Last October's U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act loosened restrictions on gov-

ernment access to confidential studentrecords. Though the government has not yet askea Swarthmore to hand over the records, student activists have raised numerous issues regarding college policy

The globe consists of three parts: two hemispheres and the motorized base. According to Rand
McNally records, the two hemispheres weigh 160
pounds and the base weighs 210 pounds. The motor
in Swarthmore's globe no longer works. According
to Reference Librarian Ed Fuller, the globe still spun
when he began working in McCabe in 1975. But he
says that the globe has been stationary since the
motor broke in late 1976.
Nowadays, though, it is nearly impossible to find
much information about these globes. "Rand
McNally no longer makes these," McCabe
Technology Services Specialist Andy Miller said.
"Additionally, they do not have much information
on these globes anymore, and they were not willing
to buy it back."
The globe has inhabited its space on the third
floor of McCabe since the library opened in the fall
of 1967. According to school records, Arthur Magill
'29 donated the money used to purchase the globe. In
1967, the globe cost $12,050, and since then, it has
become a mainstay of the library.
"In its small way, there is a certain grandeur and
a certain fascination to it," Fuller said.
Despite its history, the globe is facing the end of
its tenure at Swarthmore. Beginning in the summer

toward government requests for student records.
Most of the concern at Swarthmore revolves around whether students should be informed of these requests. The Swarthmore
Progressive Action Committee (SPAC) has recently met with college
officials in an attempt to make sure the Swarthmore policy is publicized to students. "Our goal is to get some kind of statement saying that the college won't give out records without a court order,
and if they do they will inform us," SPAC member Addie Candib 'O5
said.
Before the passage of the U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act, which stands for
"Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism, "a judge had to
evaluate substantial evidence before government officials could
receive a court order allowing access to student records. "Now, all
the government has to do is certify that someone is involved in a terrorism investigation," SPAC member Sarah Drescher 'O3 said. She
explained that once this certification is secured, a court order is
granted without judicial review.
"It looks like [records] could be easier to get than they used to
be," Registrar Martin Warner said.
Warner noted that the previous laws concerning release of student records contained a provision saying that in a "health or safety emergency," government officials could request student information without a court order. Before Sept. 11, "most [registrars]
assumed that this meant the student's health or safety," Warner

Council addresses financial aid, dining issues
Athletes ask Sharpies to keep food longer
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.eclu

Student Council is planning to pursue
changes in dining services, including later
closing times, and has met with the college
president to address concerns about financial aid.
Ryan Budish 'O4 and

Edward Stehlik 'O5

met with Linda McDougall last Wednesday
to discuss Sharpies' closing time at dinner
and the problems it causes for some athletes. McDougall said Sharpies workers
leave food out until 7:30 p.m. even though
the doors close at 7:15, which is part of an
agreement with the athletics department.
Lately, students have complained that
workers have been removing food early,
but McDougall has posted signs reminding
dining services workers of the rule.
Student Council is also looking into the
benefits of keeping Sharpies open an extra
15 minutes on weeknights.

"If nothing else we're moving in the right direction."
Matt Rubin 'O3
In their meeting, Budish and Stehlik
also asked McDougall about the possibility
of having bag lunches available every

weekday. McDougall said dining services
cannot issue bag lunches on Monday and
Friday, citing budget issues.
They also brought up the possibility of
keeping Essie Mae's Snack Bar open later.
She told them the snack bar used to be open
later but was not profitable. "The reason
they discontinued this in the first place
was because it wasn't making enough
money," Stehlik said. "Not enough people

used it."

Co-President Liane Rice

'O3 noted that

having "Latenight Tarble" would only
work if it were instituted at the beginning

of the school year so that students could
become accustomed to it. The council has
also tossed around the idea of having Paces
offer more fast-food items. Stehlik said he
and Budish had asked McDougall if she
could stock a vending machine with sandwiches, which "didn't seem to be a problem." But facilities, not dining services, is
in charge of the vending machines, so
Student Council would have to consult
with them.

Co-President Matt Rubin 'O3 and Rice
met with President Al Bloom last week to
discuss their concerns about financial aid,
especially the denial of federal aid for students with drug convictions. Rubin said
that Bloom is "open to investigating the
possibility of combining the student advisory group that works on admissions and
financial aid now with the faculty and staff

advisory group."

Rubin liked this idea, since it would
eliminate the need for Student Council to
start a committee dedicated to financial
aid. Some members did voice concerns that

asking the admissions committee to take

on the issue of financial aid as well would
be asking a lot. "I guess the point is that
they are open to the idea of having faculty
and staff and students [working together],
so if nothing else we're moving in the right
direction," Rubin said. "I was encouraged."
Bloom said during the meeting that the
college's current financial aid policy promises to meet students' fully demonstrated
need. This would apply even if the government denied a student federal aid due to a
drug conviction. "It would be consistent

with Swarthmore's current policy to com-

pensate these students, because it's not like
the need goes away the minute you get a
drug conviction," Rubin said. "You have

the same demonstrated need, it's just that
the federal government is refusing to pay a
portion of that demonstrated need."
Rubin is also interested in starting a
Forum for Activists, an idea presented by
council member Jeff Regier 'O3, who is

Phi Psi members on probation
after Haverford scavenger hunt
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu
The deans have placed each member of
Phi Psi fraternity on disciplinary probation for the crimes committed by six freshmen members during their annual scavenger hunt on the Haverford campus in
early December.
"Fraternities at their best can be communities of fellowship and group support,"
wrote Dean of the College Bob Gross in a
letter to each member that informed them
of their punishment. He went on to
describe the crimes committed during the
hunt as "immoral, embarrassing and
against college rules," since they were
defined as hazing activity.
Last December, Josh Farber 'O2, then
president of Phi Psi, was quoted in The
Phoenix as insisting the scavenger hunt
wasn't a hazing ritual. Gross said the
deans had decided this was not the case.
"Their argument is that it wasn't hazing
and it was meant all in good fun," Gross
said. "I mean, dun."

The dean added that the fraternity will
have to be "very careful about door checking and following the rules" at any party it
may hold this semester.
"If any significant violation of college
rules can be traced to the organization,
they'll have the lease on their house

revoked," Gross said. In that case, Phi Psi
would have to find an official house somewhere off campus, and their current house
would be available for use by another
group.
"We think it's fitting, we think it's
appropriate," said Farber. "Every member
takes responsibility for what happened."
Farber is no longer the fraternity president
because Phi Psi changes presidents every
semester, not because of the college's pun-

ishment.
In addition to the probation, the deans
have asked Phi Psi to find a faculty and
alumni adviser "to meet with them periodically and sort of oversee their activities,"
according to Gross. Farber said the fraternity had no problem with this, and that
they will be identifyingboth advisers soon.

The IC sign in the fragrance garden was first reported as vandalized last Thursday.

Unidentified vandals deface IC sign
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore. edu

Vandals defaced the Intercultural
Center sign hanging in the fragrance garden outside Clothier hall, writing in red
marker, "asshole" and "destroy everything," along with an "A" circled, a sign
commonly associated with anarchism.
The vandalism was reported to Public
Safety a week ago, on Thursday, Feb. 7.
Members of groups that co-sponsor the
IC seemed unconcerned about the vandalism, or that it was meant specifically for
the center.
"It's kind of illegible, first of all, and

14, 2002

also it says destroy everything and has a
little lame anarchy sign," said Jackie
Aponte 'O2, a longtime SQU member. "So
maybe this is wrong, but I thought it was
some Ville kids or something."
Though the IC sign has been vandalized
before, last time "it was something explicitly homophobic," Aponte said. This time,
though, "it's more of an annoyance because
we have to repaint it."
"It seems kind of random," she added.
"It's more of an annoyance than anything.
But though it's distressing, Aponte
added, "I'm not going to jump to any conclusions that this was meant for the IC center or anything."

Swarthmore ranked low in community service survey

Study shows below-average percentage of work-study funds going to community service programs

BY JARED LENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu
study,
to
a recent
Swarthmore is undeserving of its sterling
reputation for community service.
A study published in the Jan./Feb. edition of the Washington Monthly and cofunded by Northwestern University's
According

Medill School of Journalism claims that
Swarthmore and the rest of the nation's
cadre ofelite colleges and universities may
be tops when it comes to academics, but
that "what the numbers show is that when
it comes to community service, the
nation's best schools perform the worst."
The survey's conclusions are primarily
based on the percentage of work-study
funds a school uses to pay students to do
community service as opposed to normal
campus jobs. According to the study, 70
percent of the top 20 liberal arts colleges in
U.S. News and World Report college rankings, including Swarthmore, and 75 percent of the top 20 universities fall below the
national average for performing workstudy service.
Swarthmore Director of Financial Aid
Laura Talbot said the college should have
ranked even lower; the study incorrectly
tags the school as using 111 percent of federal work-study funds for service when the
percentage is closer to seven percent, the
federal minimum. The national average is
ILB percent. But Talbot also claims that the
study is misleading and sells Swarthmore

short.
"The article took the percentage of
work-study funds a college spends on service to be a measure of how much community service went on, and the two are certainly not related," she said. "The percentage of work-study funds a school spends on
service is just that: the percentage of workstudy funds a school spends on service. It is
not measure of either how dedicated the
administration is to community service or
how much community service goes on at a

school."
Talbot believes that, contrary to the

claims of the study, Swarthmore continues
to maintain its dedication to civic responsibility.

"Swarthmore has a very strong commit-

ment to community service," she said.
"That is clearly reflected in the number of
students who are involved in CIVIC and
other programs." CIVIC, which stands for
Cooperative Involvementand Volunteers in
Communities, is the umbrella group for
community service.
Pat James, Swarthmore's Director of
Community Service, also dismisses the
notion that Swarthmore has abandoned its
civic mission.
"The article makes it seem as though
the only community service we do is
through work-study," she said. "For
Swarthmore, and a lot of colleges, most
community service is not done through

work-study."
In addition to widespread interest in
community service among students, James
points to the college's generous allocation

of its own funds for service grants.
"The thing that is true for Swarthmore
that's not true for most other schools is
that we don't have a problem finding funds
for students who want to do community
service," she said. "There's nobody here
who can't do service because we won't pay
for it, and we're really, really unusual in

that regard."
This is not to say that either more
money or higher federal requirements
couldn'traise number of students involved
in community service at Swarthmore.
"Federal work study is a wonderful program, but there just isn't enough money,"
Talbot said. "We could have more students
in community service if only we had more

money."

Talbot dismissed the claim made in the
report that "schools are actually swimming
in work-study funding, thanks to the
Clinton-era expansion of the program from
$757 million five years ago to more than $1
billion today. College financial aid officers
are so flush with work-study dollars that
they're awarding grants to middle- and

upper-middle-class students simply by
process of elimination." She said that
although funds might have increased, it
was only to meet rising needs, and that
Swarthmore is certainly not "flush with
work study dollars."
While an increase in federal funds in
the near future is unlikely, a hike in service requirements is. Senators John McCain
(R.-Ariz) and Evan Bayh (D.-Ind.) recently
introduced legislation that would raise
required service spending from seven to 25
percent. This would certainly impose costs
on colleges, which would have to reallocate
funds from their own budget to maintain
their work force or eliminate some jobs
entirely, and work-study students, who
might have to find service jobs that require

commuting.

While schools and students might be
miffed by such an inconvenience, a recent
opinion column in The Philadelphia
Inquirer by Jane Eisner argues that "colleges and universities willing to accept
public money but unwilling to apply it to
the public good" can be justifiably bullied
into acquiescence.
"Most work-study students shelve
library books, file paper, hand out gym
equipment, or spoon out cafeteria food,
providing a steady source of cheap labor on
college campuses," she writes. "Some even
work in private companies off campus.
Useful jobs, sure, but that's not the highest

Students abroad share Sept. 11 experiences
Studying in foreign countries gave most a distinctly different perspective on terrorist attacks and media
BY KRISNA

DUONG-LY
kduongll@swarthmore.edu

Sophia Acord 'O3, like many students, was abroad last
semester. While students here watched the events of Sept.
11 unfold on TV screens in Parrish Parlours, Acord said
those outside the country last fall had different experi-

ences.
"We have a very different perspective on it," she said
at a discussion in Kohlberg Coffee Bar sponsored by Why
War? and the foreign study office last Wednesday. "We
don't understand the sheer horror of it as others who
were here [in the United States] do."
Adrienne Fowler 'O3, who was in Turkey last semester,
organized the discussion. Fowler came home to find that
she had different experiences concerning the attacks than
her friends at home. When she returned to Swarthmore,
Fowler contacted Why War? and the foreign study office,
who both agreed to sponsor the discussion.
Many students in attendance had shared similar experiences concerning the attacks and the subsequent bombing of Afghanistan. Many who spoke agreed that they had
not felt the terror of the attacks as deeply as their families and friends at home.
Others expressed dismay at the American media's way
of relaying information of events. "The thing that upset
everyone was not re-experiencing the event but experi-

encing the rhetoric in the media," Alyssa Timin 'O3, who
studied in Japan last semester, said.

"It was obvious how the information had been tidied
and packaged," Rebecca Kuipers 'O3 agreed. "It was
depressing how commercialized it had become."
Many had similar views concerning the subsequent
U.S. bombing in Afghanistan. Acord, who studied in
France last semester, brought two articles from French
newspaper articles to the discussion. One was printed the
day after the attacks and was headlined "Nous sommes
tous americains" or "We are all Americans." The other
was printed the day after the United States began bombing Afghanistan and was entitled "L'Amerique malaimee" or "America disliked."
Some host families advised their students to say they
were Canadian or British, but few people in the host

and

Canadians, students said.

Fowler, who knew little Turkish upon arriving in
Turkey, was often approached after the bombing began.
"Attacking another Muslim country was a very big deal
for many Turks. I don't think many Americans realized
that," she said. "It was strange to feel that one had to have

an almost rehearsed statement."
Brett Klukan 'O3, who spent last semester in Sri
Lanka, said that when he entered a store following the
American attacks on Afghanistan, "they knew that [he]
couldn't be that bad" because he knew about the Koran.
"They gave me sugar, which is very expensive in Sri
Lanka, and kept asking me why [the United States] are
All I could repeat was that

I didn't like the war."
Because students abroad had not seen the level of
patriotism their friends and families had experienced
after the attacks, many felt out of place when they
returned to towns and cities lined with American flags.
"I felt that I had very specific views that dealt with the
fact that I was not here [in the United States] for the
attacks," Mike Camilleri 'O3 said. He learned about the
Sept. 11 attacks while in a desolate area of Venezuela via
a television connected to a car battery. "I definitely got a
sense that people are very influenced by their environments and situations."

Three-part Islam lecture series kicks off
Columbia University professor's talk is first in series to heighten college interest in Islam
BY REIKO TESHIBA

rteshibl@swarthmore.edu
Brinkley

Messick is interested in how

legal texts can be used to understand how
everyday society works.
In his lecture entitled "Written Law and
Justice in a Yemeni Muslim Court" on Feb.
7, Messick, a professor of anthropology at
Columbia University, spoke about his
research examining the role of Islamic law
on society in pre-revolutionary Yemen. He
also addressed the significance of the legal

doctrines themselves.
The talk was part of a three-part lecture
series entitled "Cultures of Islam," organized by anthropology professors Bruce
Grant and Farha Ghannam. According to
Grant and Ghannam, these lectures seek to
strengthen the college's interest in the
study and analysis of Islam. The talks also
complement their team-taught seminar,
"Culture, Power, Islam," which examines
Islam from multiple perspectives.
Messick's lecture focused on his
research on Yemeni history before the rev-

6

olution of 1962. Military officers overthrew
the last Imam, leading to a struggle
between the Royalists, who supported the
Imam, and the Republicans, who were
backed by Egypt. Messick began his fieldwork in Yemen in 1974 in a province called
Ibb.

The snails belong to Dr. Ron Chase, who

behavior and evolution.
Snail reproduction is a curious tale. Snails
are hermaphrodites, but although individuals
contain both male and female sex organs, they
do not self-fertilize. The two- to six-hour

The tragedy occurred June 10, 2001 in
Rhode Island while Sean was "climbing a

Deveney said. "He was hit by what is
called a flare and was knocked to the

What makes some snail species particularly interesting to Chase is their use of 'love
darts' during copulation. About one third of
snails manufacture hard, sharp darts which
they 'fire' at the objects of their affections.
"The love dart phenomenon has been documented in the literature as far back as the

mid-17th century," Chase said. "Love dart
snails were known to the ancient Greeks, and
it wouldn't be surprising to find that they
influenced the creation of the cupid myth."
The love dart is a tool of male manipulation. Sperm is moved to a storage area within

"Poor shooting is commonplace—onethird of all love darts either fail to penetrate
the skin or they miss the target completely,"
Chase said.
Being hit with a love dart may sound cute
and comical, but for the recipient there may
be costs. Love darts are the equivalent of
being stabbed with a hypodermic needle.
Evidence from mating trials conducted in the
Chase lab indicates snails try to avoid being
hit with love darts. Copulating snails commonly are seen jostling, in an attempt to hit
but not be hit.

Land plans
Flexibility has a flexible definition these days. Though it did not
make the list of the college's values for guiding land use, it is the
goal, the theme and the rationale for the recommendations the Land
Use Planning Committee made and published online last night at
landuse.swarthmore.edu.
Most notable was the recommendation that land now used for
faculty housing in the near north neighborhood should be re-zoned
to provide the college with flexibility. This was made in the interest
of giving the Swarthmore of tomorrow options and prohibiting the
Swarthmore of today from making restrictive choices.
It makes good sense for the college to take a long-term view of
land-use planning. It makes good sense to plan with an eye to leaving a variety of options open for the future. It makes good sense to
plan for a range of eventualities, even presently undesirable ones,
and to realize that the college may face needs in the future that are
impossible to anticipate right now. For instance, it's worthwhile to
consider where the college could put a new academic building 30
years from now.
For those reasons, flexibility is a fine goal, with one caveat. This
not, as some faculty have Conjectured,
flexibility must be real
merely a code word for fixed, unspoken land-use plans that will preclude thoughtful discussion of how much the college should grow.
Plans kept under wraps may be an alarmist concern, but it is one
the college should certainly act more vigorously to discount if it is
not true. Perhaps a more moderate concern is the power of suggestion and that planning for the possibility of growth might make it
easier for growth to become an eventuality.
At any rate, it seems clear that there are a range of opinions for
how closely long-term land-use planning is connected with longterm plans for the size of the college.
Vice President for Facilities Larry Schall '75 maintains that land
use issues and college size issues can be approached separately, but
it is irresponsible to think faculty, students and alumni won't
assume there is a connection or suspect that plans to enlarge the
college may be in place if there is no discussion on that point.
It was reasonable to expect some faculty to be upset when the
committee's recommendations were presented only a few weeks
before the college is to present to the borough. Regardless of intent,
that leaves the impression that faculty response and input apart
from those who were on the committee was never intended to have
a formative influence on the committee's recommendations.
It is also reasonable to expect that one will be reassured that the
committee's plans are only provisional recommendations.
Emphasizing the committee's lack of power begs the question of
who has real decision-making power on land use issues.
Another consideration is that alumni will be unhappy to feel
excluded from deliberations. The board of managers can hardly be
viewed as a body that represents all alumni and their concerns.
Since, as Schall and many others have emphasized, land use is so
important an issue, and making smart land use choices is so clearly in the college's interest, there is a need for more transparency
and opportunities for input. Putting the committee's recommendations online and scheduling tomorrow's faculty meeting were good
choices, but there seems to be no way for input at those meetings to
be incorporated into the presentation the college will make to the
borough next week. Although that meeting will do little more than
start a dialogue between the college and the borough, the dialogue
within the college should be continuous as well.
Land use is an important issue. It should be obvious to anyone
familiar with the land the college owns and the aesthetics of the
campus that the college cannot continue to grow indefinitely without facing some serious difficulties and making some drastic compromises.

The college owns nearly 360 acres, but it will likely be out of easily developable land within the next 20 years. Land is a finite
resource for this college. For that reason, a very serious and inclusive discussion must take place about the trade-offs involved in
changing the college's size, especially as the college asks a committee for recommendations that assume further growth. Land should
be viewed as a basic limiting factor on a campus that should eventually be expected to put a ceiling on growth, in terms of both student numbers and the square feet of buildings the campus can
accommodate.

The college has quite a bit of convincing to do before many peowill stop asserting that plans to re-zone the near north neighborhood and plans to increase the college's size are unconnected.
Whoever has the power to make final decisions about land use,
whether it is President of the College Al Bloom, the Board of
Managers or the land use committee, needs to make a clear argument to the college community. It should explain how it is possible
ple

to discuss long-term land use for the college without carrying out a
debate about college growth at the same time.

WEF protest was not illegal
Dear Editor:
While the article "Three students arrested at
WEF protests" (Feb. 7, pg. 3) presented the facts of
the matter fairly well, I would like to register two
complaints:

The article claims that my companions and I
were arrested at "an illegal protest." This is simply
not true. There is a distinction between "unpermitthe march had no permit, but
ted" and "illegal"
neither did my walk in the Crum yesterday. Since
the demonstration obeyed all standing laws, apart
from the small group that walked in the street, it
was no more illegal than what I did yesterday. The
actions of those who walked in the street hardly
merited two days in jail or misdemeanor charges
and certainly ought not to reflect upon the rest of
the demonstrators.
The article failed to mention that a fourth member of the Swarthmore community, Natasha Stoudt,
was arrested with us. Although Natasha is not a
Swarthmore student, she resides in the ville and
has been active in Swarthmore Progressive Action
Committee and Why War? organizing for months
now. I am dismayed at The Phoenix's lack of consideration for her plight, especially since the

reporter interviewed her shortly after our release.
Regardless, I must thank The Phoenix for its
extensive coverage of what was surely a turning
point in my life.
As for David Ellis' recent editorial display of
contempt, "Weekend's protests full of meaningless
slogans, self-important rich kids," I would like to
request three things of him:
Please, in the future, do not assume that anyone
is rich. (I am far from it.) Likewise, do not assume
that your intellectual adversaries are ignorant.
Finally, if you would like to test my ignorance, email me at any time at jobrienl@swarthmore.edu.

drama in his life is just too

his journal while fighting

for the Austrians in the
trenches of World War I.
So I can start off my film with an impressive war scene
Wittgenstein fighting the Italians and struggling to codify his
genius.

Movies love tortured souls, which is why Wittgenstein
makes such a perfect subject. He sent his manuscript of the
"Tractatus" to his hero Frege, expecting praise. He was devastated when Frege wrote back, claiming that he did not
understand a word of what Wittgenstein had written.
Wittgenstein was orally quizzed for his Ph.D. at Cambridge
on the "Tractatus," and he comforted his examiners, telling
them that it was OK if they didn't understand everything.
Movies are about entertaining and moving the audience.
When I watch a movie that centers around one person, I
want to be amazed. I want to wish that I could have the bravery of William Wallace, the charm of Jerry Maguire or the
good heart of George Bailey. Maybe I could make the audience of my movie wish that they had the passion of
Wittgenstein.
In 1946, the Moral Science Club of King's College at
Cambridge convened. Dr. Karl Popper began to ask if there
are "philosophical problems," and he and Wittgenstein had
words. Legend generally agrees that the disagreement never
came to fisticuffs, but Wittgenstein did become so enraged
that he threatened Popper with a red-hot poker. Could I ask
for more dramatic, engaging material than that? My movie is
practically already written for me.
Swarthmore is a great place. But when it comes to being
the preeminent institution of higher learning in America,
there is little doubt that Harvard is on top, though it has little to do with academics. It has to do with people. Al Gore and
Tommy Lee Jones were roommates at Harvard. Natalie
Portman supposedly goes there now. Conan went there. The
Weezer guy went there. And Matt Damon went there.
When Matt Damon received his Oscar for writing "Good
Will Hunting" a few years ago, he was basically being recognized for changing the world in a small way. He moved millions of people with the story he told. If the students of
Swarthmore want to change the world, maybe reaching for
fame is, indirectly, the way to go. The screenplay that I will
write on Wittgenstein is my first attempt to do that, to say
something to the rest of the world and have them respond.
The only issue is whether the struggles of a suicidal,
depressed and brilliant philosopher can engage a nation. I
think it can, especially if Brad Pitt plays Ludwig. None of
this indie garbage; I say go for the big time. Maybe my rookie version of a Hollywood screenplay based on a European
philosopher will flounder. But I would hope that someone
from the Swarthmore of today will be successful and be able
to really say something.

Activist group a bad idea
community.

Dear Editor:

I'm sorry to say that I was less
than shocked to read of the newlyformed "support group for white
activists" at Haverford. I, a white
anti-racist person, think it's a bad
idea.
The current and historic racial
power dynamic dictates that white
people hold power over people of
color. Why, then, do white people
need a support group? Jesse
Littlewood HC 'O3, the founder of
this group, claims that he wants to
be able to form a "positive identity" for white people. One of the
beautiful things about being in a
position of privilege is that white
people can form any identity they
want to form for themselves. Other
racial groups don't exactly have
that option.
While white people must assess
their own privilege to work as antiracist activists, talking about
white privilege in the context of a
meeting full of white anti-racist
people can only do so much good in
the overall fight against racism.
This is why I'd see merit in occasional workshops for anti-racist
white people but not in an official
group with regular meetings.
What will a typical meeting of
this group be like? If I go, can I

Will one meeting per month feature a real live person of color who

Enough with the snarkiness, I
know. In my opinion, the best way
for white people to make real
strides against racism is by working with people of color to find out
what the oppressed group they aim
to help out feels is best for them. A
group of white people working
together to end racism, however,

activist is really difficult, is not

only something that comes along

with activism but also a valuable
tool for self-assessment. Having
your head checked in a talk about
racism with a white person isn't
going to get you more respect
among people of color as an antiracist ally. Sometimes you'll need
to step back and listen to what people of color think.
Yes, white activists do wield a
tremendous amount of power and
privilege. Yes, it can (and should)
be used in positive ways to end
oppression. But your group's meetings, in which you decide how best
to work together to end racism and
benefit the oppressed, aren't going
to do anything but make some people feel better about being white
and make plenty of other people go

'Journeys with George'
a telling documentary
"You know, you can spell it with a G," Bush offered.

Huh?
And so George W. Bush provided NBC's Alexandra
Pelosi with the title, not to mention some good footage, of
her new documentary about the Bush 2000 campaign.
No one really knows why Bush told Pelosi she could
spell "it" with a G. "Journeys with George" was the title he
recommended, but as far as I know "Journeys" is spelled
with a J and "George" with a G. And "W." with a W.
What did he have in mind, "Geournies with George?"
As opposed to "Journeys with Jourge?"
Hmm.
According to Time
magazine, Pelosi filmed

the entire video on her
hand-held
camcorder
and did the editing in

glimpse into the president's behind-the-scenes

the video and even acted goofy around the camera, as she
had told him it was only for her personal use. Never trust
a daughter of the House Democratic whip, Nancy Pelosi!
The title is not the only juicy part of the movie, or so
Time reports. The entire documentary includes some
interesting revelations about the president's campaign
experience, which was evidently relaxing for him but a
potential train wreck for his aides.
The film captures Bush in his off-the-record interactions with the press, which include him sipping/sharing/guzzling/chugging a "non-alcoholic" beer with the airplane press corps, who were downing margaritas. "It takes
an animal to know an animal," Bush reportedly says.
That's not the only potentially embarrassing new product out on the market. It has been widely reported that The
New York Times' Frank Bruni has written a book, scheduled to be released in March, about the Bush campaign.
The book's title is "Ambling Into History." Needless to say,
it wasn't W. himself who came up with that title.
Like the movie, "Ambling Into History" depicts a goofy
man who wound up as president of the United States.
In some instances, Bush seems to be oddly unaware of
what the rest of the country is obsessed with, pop-culturally speaking. Bruni writes that Bush had never heard of
Leonardo DiCaprio nor "Sex in the City," and that he
didn't even know what a vegan was.
But his low-(low!)-culture sensibilities are in good
shape. His favorite actor is Chuck Norris, he is overly
familiar with the "Austin Powers" movies, and he likes to
munch on "Fritos and Cheez Doodles."
I suppose we should now add pretzels to the list.
Will these new revelations embarrass the president?
Tarnish his image? Lower his approval below 80 percent?
I think that's unlikely. You don't have to make Richard
Posner's list of the top 100 public intellectuals to be president. In fact, public intellectuals need not apply.
Remember what happened to the guy who "lost" to Bush in
election 2000? He grew a beard and took up a position at
Columbia University. He's probably wearing a turtleneck
and jacket and sipping a latte as we speak.
W. may not even know what a latte is. (It's a cappuccino without the foam. Duh!) But to most Americans, we
have all come to learn quite painfully, that's an endearing
quality. Resistance to 8080 culture, the term tokened by
David Brooks, is now the iconoclasm we prize in our head
of state, even if it comes at a price
not knowing that
Africa is a country, for example.
So I am looking forward to the next time the president
teaches us how to be American. I suggest we keep our eyes
out for Alexandra Pelosi's sequel, "George Goes to the
Opera."

In search of flexibility
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

The college will give a presentation to Borough Council
next week explaining how it would like to be able to use the
land it owns over the next 50 years. The issues at stake are
larger than the specific recommendations for rezoning
pieces of college-owned property.
It's a rare chance for the college to look so far into the
future and to get feedback from the borough. Yet while some
feel it is a responsible move on the part of both the borough
and the college, taking a long-term view brings the community's divergence of opinions about the college's priorities to
the forefront. The perception that the college intends to continue growing has emerged as especially contentious issues.
While Vice President of Facilities Larry Schall said he
"wouldn't say the college is running out of land," most of the
academic space on campus is already heavily built up, and
there are few good locations for additional buildings.
"It's is a very important issue," Schall said. "It's very significant to the college and the most important thing I've
worked on in my 12 years here."
Other long-term ideas the Land Use Planning Committee
have presented to faculty staff and students include new
academic buildings and college offices in currently residential neighborhoods, multi-level parking garages, a hotel and
restaurant complex on college owned property and athletics
fields on the far side of the Crum. They will make a presentation to the Board of Managers on Feb 24.
These ideas met a mix of reactions when presented to the
faculty last week, especially the recommendations to alter
the zoning designation for the neighborhood where about a
fifth of permanent faculty live. Changing the zoning from
residential to institutional would give the college the ability to build offices or academic buildings on the land, potentially displacing faculty. Schall and all members of the committee say no such plans are in the works and nothing
would change in the next 15 years.

Everbach hopes to discuss concerns at the faculty meeting tomorrow. "There is a concern among some faculty that
the bulldozers are idling just around the corner. It's an
unfounded concern. There are none planned for many years
to come," he said.
Not all faculty were upset by the possible implications of
re-zoning. Chemistry professor Paul Rablen said he would
have no problem moving if at any point the college decided
to put his house in the near north neighborhood to another
use. The meeting with the borough is part of a year-long
process in which the college has been outlining its longterm vision for using its land. Guided by a set of values
including preserving green space and the residential quali-

ty of the campus, a new land use committee co-chaired by
Schall and engineering professor Carr Everbach has been
discussing ways to allow the college the greatest degree of
flexibility for future land needs.
The same firm that is designing the new dorm, William
Rawn and Associates, has been hired to conduct a planning
analysis for the college's long-range options and has been
working with the committee and facilities.
Prompted by a request from the borough council, the
committee has prepared what co-chair Carr Everbach
called a "flow chart" of possibilities for how the college may
want to use the land it owns over the next 50 years.
The zoning recommendations that will be presented to
the borough with a represent a way to work around the land
crunch the college will face after the current round of
approved construction projects are completed in 10 years.
Flexibility is the catchword being used to describe the
college's land use goals by Schall and others. "Flexibility
means that the college will not be constrained by zoning
codes in deciding what it thinks are the best places for putting new buildings," Sayer said.
Yet flexibility is a suspicious word for some. Religion

College, borough disagree on hotel progress
With liquor law passed, plans for proposed 80-room inn may rest on issues of land use, traffic engineering
BY BRENDAN KARCH

More than three years after the concept
first emerged for an 80-room hotel to be built
on college property, neither the college nor
the borough is seriously moving forward
with plans for construction. Despite
detailed drawings, years of borough planning and Pennsylvania state legislation
allow a liquor license, whether
plans will go through is still anybody's
passed to

guess.

"Whether it will happen or not, I have no
idea," Larry Schall '75, vice president of
facilities for the college, said. Furthermore,
despite all the planning, Schall said either
the college or the borough could "derail
[hotel plans] in seconds."
That may come as disturbing news to
Borough Council, which has looked to hotel
plans as the main way of revitalizing the
ville. Current plans would place a hotel,
restaurant and retail space on the current
site of athletic fields, adjacent to the train
station and across from the downtown area.

Revitalizing the Ville
Plans for the hotel first arose from the
borough's revitalization task force, which
was formed to address issues of a languishing town center. The task force issued a
revitalization strategy report in September
of 1999. The plan noted the borough's current inflexibility in expanding because of
surrounding residential areas, and thus the
desire to move part of the town center onto
college property.

The initial proposal called for "a 65-room
inn with restaurant facilities, a collegerelated
bookstore,
additional
restaurant/cafe facilities and required park-

ing facilities," according to the revitalization strategy report. Vice president Maurice
Eldridge '6l represented the college on the
task force.

The college moved ahead with initial
plans for the hotel in 2000 by hiring a development firm. The
firm, Haverford Hotel

Projects, then hired

an architectural firm
to come up with preliminary drawings.

At this time, it
became clear that the
college would probably not want to own
the hotel, but would
rather lease the land.
The architect's drawings were presented
to the borough in the
faU of 2000. Borough

that the borough would want to see implemented before the hotel was built.
Borough approval is vital for the hotel
because of zoning issues. The property that
would be used is currently zoned institutional, which would only allow for "college
academic and dormitory expansion,"
according to zoning restrictions. The borough would have to approve a change to
commercial/retail zoning. Borough council
is still looking forward to the hotel as a
potential major boost to town revitalization.
However, none of major original proposals
has been implemented. One of the other
major proposals was to allow for the expansion of the Co-Op and then build a road that
would extend Lafayette Court from the firePHOENIX

Obstacles remain
All of these proposed plans have yet to go
through. Plans for the hotel and adjacent
restaurant and retail space have raised
issues in zoning, college land use, liquor
licenses and traffic planning. Only one of
these issues
that of the liquor license
has been resolved. The borough's revitalization task force realized several years ago
that no developer would want to invest
money in a hotel without the profits of
liquor sales. Swarthmore, however, is a dry
town, and sentiment in the borough is very
resistant to changing that. So, the borough
helped lobby for

disappointment. I think it's a

house, through the existing Co-Op, and over
to the train tracks. The borough received an
$850,000 grant last fall for the road expansion and for sidewalk improvements, but is
still waiting on the Co-Op, which must
decide whether to renovate its existing
space or buy the property next door. The
borough hopes to have word from the Co-Op
this spring so they can buy out the property
needed to extend Lafayette Court. The current timeline is a year behind the schedule
set in a report by the revitalization task
force in September of 2000.
"Everything about it always takes longer
than you expect," said borough council
member Lisa Aaron of the planning and
zoning issues. Aaron heads the council's
Planning and Zoning Committee.
The plans for the hotel are moving particularly slowly. The September 2000 update
of the revitalization plan proposed an ambitious timeline for construction of the hotel.
According to the plan, after May of 2001, "the
developer/hotel operator and college can
begin detailed planning and analysis of the
development in this area, complete their
business negotiations, arrange financing,
and submit their detailed plans for review
and approval through the borough's development review process. An optimistic
schedule for these activities results in a construction start in the spring of 2002."

The liquor license loophole was supposed to move along plans for the hotel. But
tangential issues of land use and traffic
routing have continued to delay the project
and have created some confusion about if
and when definite plans can move forward.
In the fall of 2000 the college sent a letter
to Borough Council alerting the borough to
possible zoning changes the college would
like to see. The college currently owns a lot
of land on the periphery of campus that is
zoned residential. By losing use of the land
because of the hotel, the college was hoping
to make a trade off by converting some of its
peripheral land for institutional use.
The college's letter never developed into
a formal proposal, but the borough encour-

College, faculty
debate inevitability
of campus growth

50 years from now...

From LAND, pg. 12
who does not agree with the committee's recommendations, expressed concerns that the ability for the college
to expand its facilities means growth is assumed to be
certain in the eyes of those asking for "flexibility."
At the same time, Schall was clear that "this is not a
proposal to grow the size of the college. This is a landuse issue." The distinction he drew was, "if the college
wanted to grow, it would grow independent of whether
we make good land use decisions now or not."
Growth can be prompted by "our concern as an

academic institution to remaining competitive and
offering the best educational opportunities at the time,
as well as increasing enrollment," said committee
member Olga Rostaphshova 'O2. Both forms of growth
lead to a need for new facilties, she said.
Wallace says growths "needs to be debated at the college. It can't be assumed." He said the "working assumption" is that we will continue to grow. "If the college
remains on this trajectory," Wallace said, "Every 10, 15,
20 years, it's going to have to build new dorms, new classroom facilities, new research facilities. More land needs
to be acquired in order to achieve that."
He said growth is being assumed because "he president of the college believes that in order for the college
to maintain its prestige, ranking and attraction to excellent students and excellent faculty, it needs to continue
to grow its physical plant and improve its facilities.
Part of it has to do with president's perception that the
college can't stand still, that it needs to continue to

Staf

grow continuously.
"I think the Crum, the faculty neighborhood, the
look and feel of the south campus are too important to
sacrifice to this perceived institutional need." In
Wallace's view, growth is not inevitable. "It's within

their control. They think one percent growth serves the
colleges long range interest as a prestige institution."
Wallace is asking for a broader discussion about the
direction and scope of college growth. "I would like to
bump the discussion out of the committee into the wide
campus. I would like people to commit themselves to
debating whether or not this is a good idea."
Schall maintained that the coUege has held open discussions about its size and the desirability of growth in

the past. He said that in the process of outlining the college's priorities three years ago in preparation for the
capital campaign, the size of the college was one of the
first items discussed. Before the start of those conversations, he said, the board had announced an increase in
the college's enrollment
target up from 1,325 to 1,375.
Until the board decides
otherwise, Schall said,
"that's where we'll stay."
That doesn't mean the
college won't grow over
the next 50 years, he said.
Historically, increases in
enrollment have been

"attempts to create flexibility so that if the college has space
needs in the give it will have options to consider." When
doing its work, the committee was told that there had been
a pattern of increasing enrollment by one percent a year.
Political science professor Richard Valelly lives in the
faculty housing up for re-zoning and is very concerned
about the recommendations he heard presented to the faculty by the land use committee. He said that such a statistic is
misleading because enrollment growth has been more
uneven than an average enrollment growth number indicates. Saying the college has

brought about both by
conscious decisions and "a lot of creep," Schall said.
He also pointed out that not all enrollment increases
are prompted by a simple desire for more students. As
long as Swarthmore strives to keep up with new areas
of academic interest continues to expand the breadth of
its curriculum, the number of faculty will continue to
increase, he said. Bringing in new faculty and expanding or creating departments in itself this creates a need
for new academic space and facilities. At the same time,
it makes it convenient to add more students to keep
student-to-faculty ratio constant.
"To be honest, that's where the push to add more students comes from," Schall said. Since it is impossible to
predict how the college's interest and needs will change
that far in advance, this creates a need for flexibility, he
said. Sayer said that in the past the college has tried to
"lay out a prescriptive master plan for land use" but has
found such plans are "not useful as a planning tool."
What the college is doing right now is not prescriptive
planning, she said, but rather land-use analysis, which

The Land Use Planning
Committee has proposed a

the proposals are definite, and
none have been accepted by
the Board of Managers.
The committee has proposed
that the "hinge block," bounded by Chester, College, Cedar
and Elm, become more of an
official entrance to the college.
There would be green 'bailees"
running perpendicularly out
from each other. One would
head toward Ben West house,
and Mephistos would be repositioned. The other would head
up toward Whittier, where
many current houses would be
torn down. This is the "prime
location for new academic
buildings," Larry Schall said.

emphasized that growth is a choice, not something that is
inevitable.
Everbach's response is that even if the college decides not
to grow at some future point, that does not affect his committhe coltee's charge, as explained to them by the president of
lege, Al Bloom. "Our job is to make recommendations based
on a range of possible scenarios depending on what college
policy might be. It's not to dictate coUege policy," he said.
While he said it was important to hold discussions about
whether Swarthmore should grow, that falls outside the realm
of his committee's charge. Everbach suggested that separate
committees could be formed to look at the specific issue of the
size of the college. Regardless, the land use committee needs to
continue "planning for all eventualities" he said.
"Some people would like to forestall or prevent future
options and force the college to make certain choices now,"
he said, which runs contrary to how he interprets the
purpose of long-term land-use planning.
At issue is how much the hands of the college's leaders

will be tied in the future with regard to growth, either
because more academic space is needed or because the college desires to have a greater number of students or faculty.
If zoning remains as it is now, the college would have fewer
options to exercise. The re-zoning requests that will be presented to the borough council next Wednesday reflect what
the majority of the committee feels will give the college the
greatest number of options for using its land in the future.
The dissenting views of committee member and religion
professor Mark Wallace, a resident of faculty housing up for
re-zoning, will also be presented. Although all on the committee are in agreement with the principles and values for land
use that put a priority on preserving the natural and residential qualities of the campus, Wallace believes that the specific
recommendations for rezoning don't fit in with those values.
Although the college would have preferred to present a
unified position to the borough, Everbach said it is important
to express the "latitude of opinion" within the committee.
Schall said the meeting is meant to be the start of a dialogue
with the borough, and that no yes or no answers on rezoning

are expected soon.

There are some doubts as to what changes the borough
will actually grant the college. Rostapshova said her perception is that "the borough is not very sympathetic to the college's needs." Vice president Maurice Eldridge '6l said that
with zoning changes, "what we will get is anybody's guess as
far as I'm concerned."

Whether or not the borough grants the college's re-zoning requests, the college will face a critical set of decisions
about land use about 10 years from now. At that point, facilities projects that have been approved by the board of managers will be completed, and if existing growth patterns continue, there will have caused a need for need for new facilities and land on which to build.
This fact has led some faculty to ask the college to take a
step back and question whether and how the college should
grow before it begins to talk about how to gain flexibility.
Schall said at the staff meeting that the land use committee
exists as a response to the concerns of some faculty as the science center was being planned about how the college intended to use the rugby filed and the building along Whittier.

Sleepwear: a style guide for the lazy
Dahling!
Now, I know it has been weeks since I have written, and I know
how in the meantime your budding style has lost its edge. You feel
lusterless and dejected; you are maybe even pondering a return to
sweatpants. But do not fret, doll; I am back, and I bring you a
mantra to live by from the mouth of the god of style himself: the
ever-mahvelous Prince. Here it is: "Style is loving yourself so
everyone else does too."

Now, there is a common miscon-

I

MARA HVISTENDAHL

ception at this fashion-challenged
institution that loving oneself
means embracing leg and facial
hair, encouraging dry, tangled hair
and flaunting ill-fitting clothes.
Mind you, Prince is telling you that
this is not the case. Would the Artist
be caught dead in unfunky garb? He
most certainly would not! "Loving
yourself' clearly means conditioning your tresses, shaving off that
John Walker Lindh thing you've got
going on and finding yourself a signature color.
Valentine's Day is approaching,
and whether you're in an oppressive

pseudo-matrimonial situation or
not, it's time to be stylish and love
yourself, doll. Get to the mall and
attack the recession-inspired sales!
Get your hair done! Turn some heads! Nothing says "I love me" like
a pair of black leather pants.
Dahling, I mean it when I again quote his stylin' highness:
"Style is an accurate account of what's inside every heart."

Style Queen

Dear Style Queen:
To what extent can I wear pajamas to class?
Sleepy in PPR

Dear Sleepy:
Tsk tsk, dahling. This is clearly a loaded question!
You're assuming there are circumstances under which wearing pajamas to class
is acceptable. As you present it, your style dilemma lies merely in
determining how many days a week you will have to roll out of bed
ten minutes earlier and throw on real clothes. One? Two? You are
hoping I won't say three, aren't you, doll?
I'm so sorry, dahling, but I simply cannot condone wearing what
typically passes for "pajamas." Day or night. I would be shirking
my duties if I implied that flannel isn't an eyesore. I would be omitting important information if I didn't remind you that thermal
weave died with the rest of grunge back in 1993. And I would be
leading you astray if I let on that animal-print cotton is chic. (Dear,
if it looks like an animal but clearly came from a plant, don't touch

it with a ten-foot pole.)
But I don't mean to be so negative. It is simply horrible for my
skin. Now, there is hope for you, doll! If you wear aesthetically
pleasing sleepwear, you can roll out ofbed in the morning and still
look better than 97 percent of this campus. The word is slips,
dahling. Timeless, elegant, sexy, slinky slips. They double as dresses! They will likely be on sale starting tomorrow! Throw on a cardigan and some fishnet tights with a slip, and you are set.
Now, for the gents out there: find yourselves some attractive,
ribbed, muscle-revealing (this will only be the case for those of you
who have muscles to be revealed) undershirts. I am not talking
about those white cotton things that come in plastic bags. I mean
subtle, soft, well-tailored shirts. In addition to reducing your morning prep time, you will look smashing in bed. Now, it is none of my
business what you wear on your lower half (though I recommend
boxer briefs), but be forewarned that whatever it is you will likely
have to put on genuine pants before going to class.
Now, dahling, wear that sleepwear with style!
Correction: In my last column, I attempted to evoke the simplicity
of a "white cotton shift." Now, some style-inhibited copy editor
changed "shift" to "shirt." Shift, dahling, shift! As in the dress! Let
the crusade continue!

Movie viewing to warm (or heal) the heart

Our favorite film critic dispenses advice on flicks to fit your mood on Valentine's Day
BY MORGHAN HOLT

mholtl@swarthmore.edu

Many quintessential Valentine's Day
activities are seriously strata-specific,
depending on the status of your heart
and/or your mental health.
For instance, unattached, embittered
folks generally don't have the (sort of)
desirable option of singing heart-melting
Mariah Carey tunes karaoke-style to their
loved ones across the candlelight of "Lady
and the Tramp"-esque pasta dinners.
Likewise, the dude with his sweetheart
attached to his hip as they trek in a twosome all over campus doesn't have the
option of blowing off his woman and going
to a strip club with his single compadres.
Nor does his snuggly-wuggly even get to
entertain the possibilities of weeping over
loves lost as she digs into a gallon-tub of
Chunky Monkey and single-handedly polishes off a nice bottle of Merlot. "Romeo
and Juliet" is only suited to the dating few
of us, while "Misery" is better tailored for

morose others.
Our various love-life incongruities aside,
there is still a common activity in which we
all, smitten, heartsick, cynical, apathetic,
lustful, enamored, can partake without
making too big a dent in our wallets. Grab
your honey or an extra-large helping of your
favorite comfort food. Snuggle up or wallow/delight in the lack of someone to snuggle up with. Turn out the lights and feast
your eyes on one of the all-time greatest
love, or anti-love, films, depending on what
your dating status dictates.

For the love-struck, ooey-gooey, totally
infatuated couples:
Films based on "destined" love, including
many
Disney's
of
Walt
favorites:"Sleeping
Beauty,"
"Snow
White," "Cinderella" and "The Little
Mermaid." Or go for the cult classic "The
Princess Bride," the heart-wrenching
"City of Angels," or the unequivocally passionate "Shakespeare in Love."
For those reeling from the unexpected
presence of love in their lives, not to

mention the more unexpected reality of
who the person is:
Films based on totally off-the-wall, outof-the-blue, unforeseen but nevertheless
very real love. This includes the surprising love of Mary Stuart Masterson and
Johnny Depp in "Benny and Joon," the
business-like romance and eventual startling love of Julia Roberts and Richard
Gere in "Pretty Woman," the intimate
bonding of business nemeses Meg Ryan
and Tom Hanks in "You've Got Mail," or
the wonder of the unconventional passion
of Disney's "Beauty and the Beast."
Also look for the culturally bridging,
emerged-from-nowhere love that Jodie
Foster and Chow Yun Fat share in "Anna
and the King," the mind-boggling romance
encountered between obsessive-compulsive disease sufferer Jack Nicholson and
worrywart mom Helen Hunt in "As Good
as it Gets," or the utterly unanticipated
love sparked between Margaret Avery and
Whoopi Goldberg in "The Color Purple."

For the vengeful, the heartbroken, the
pining, the obsessed or the mildly psychotic:
Films based on winning love back,
proving love's worth, or, at the very least,
setting things straight. See the classic
love-inspired revenge, "The Crow," Marky
Mark's delightful "Fear," Shakespeare's

own tormented "Romeo and Juliet," the
humorous stalker love depicted in
"There's Something About Mary," Drew
Barrymore's unstable "Mad Love," and
the tale of Ike and Tina's dysfunctional
love, "What's Love Got to Do with It?"

For those dealing with non-conventional love scenarios:
Films that depict the intricate workings of complicated relationships, auch as
the threesome portrayal in "Keeping the
Faith," the older/much, much younger
attraction depicted in "American Beauty,"
the strange love twists of "Wonder Boys,"
the jilted-love, sticky situation of "My
Best Friend's Wedding," the modern-day
Bonnie and Clyde, "Natural Born Killers,"
and the complex interworkings of the
made-for-TV 2000 edition of "If These
Walls Could Talk."
For those tired of dwelling

in the murky

misery of love lost:
Films that emphasize the renewal of
love, love found when, exhausted, you've
finally tired of looking: Sandra Bullock's
"Hope Floats," Tom Cruise's "Jerry
Maguire" and Adam Sandler's "Big

Daddy."

February 14, 2002

A tearjerker for the hopelessly in love: Meg
Ryan and Nicholas Cage in "City of Angels."
For those enjoying singlehood, thrilled
to be unattached on Feb. 14:
Films that emphasize the importance
of other aspects oflife: "Boys on the Side,"
"Reservoir Dogs," any mindlessly funny,
non-romantic comedy ("Dumb and
Dumber" comes to mind), and any non-

stalker, non-romantic horror films, a la
"It," or films that you could only enjoy in
stark singlehood: "Debby Does Dallas,"
"Steel Magnolias," "From Dusk till
Dawn," and any old WCW videos that happen to be lying around.
And, if all else fails, there's always
"Grease," Drew Carey or that overdue
problem set.

Valentine's Day:
Two tentative schedules
Once again we find ourselves at Valentine's
Day. Design your own schedule, entertain yourself with the humble on-campus plan, or take
advantage of the money-to-burn Philly version.

The Humble College Experience

Existentialism and St. Valentine's Day
BY JOEY SPADOLA
jspadoll@swarthmore.edu
Whoever said that life is short was either an idiot or favored

by the gods; for, as the Roman comedian has it, quern di deligunt
adolescens moritur
he whom the gods favor dies young.
Whoever said that life is sweet was, without qualification, a pos-

itive dunce.
For my part, I have not yet accomplished my twentieth year,
yet I feel the weight of my age bear upon me. There is much
more of the bitter, than of the sweet, about existence; so have I
come to believe. And faltering beneath the relentless, the loathsome, the inevitable pressure of existence, as the decrepit steed
bends beneath his unwelcome if familiar burden I do not hesitate to gainsay the optimists and the deluded, and to conclude
that life lasts far longer than it ought to.
"Madonna mia!," wailed my grandmother when I had finished expressing to her a sentiment of just this signification.
"Santissimo cielo! What ideas have gotten into your head? St.
Anthony hardly had the means to clothe and feed himself, yet he
never considered life other than the greatest of the divine gifts.
St. John knelt in rags and in hunger before the image of the
Lord, and thanked him for his humble existence. Jerome spent
his days in laborious silence, translating scripture, and never
once complained. Augustine
what had he in the way ofearthly goods? And yet was he ever heard to begrudge our Savior for
having breathed into him that heavenly afflatus, life, which constitutes the greatest of His works and the most awesome of His
miracles. Or St. Valentine, who
But here she broke off, detained, as it seemed, by the sudden
surge of some puissant emotion. There came a pause, then a
gasp, then a sigh. Whereupon, reluctanty and in trembing tones,

solicit belief, but upon the veracity of which Grandmother
Spadola stakes the remainder of her ever-thinning gray hairs.
Her brother, she related, was born in Rome at full noon, precisely on that date which in Italy is styled il giorno di San
Valentino, and from this circumstance he received his Christian
name, Valentino. Upon entrance into the world, he already possessed a full head of hair and a winning smile. He was a child of
extraordinary beauty. Of his own charm, moreover, he seemed
not to be unaware, even in those first instants of life. He is said
to have winked at the midwife who attended his passage into the
light. All the ladies present at the birth professed to be shocked
by the frankness of the infant's gaze. Even in his first tottering
..."

THE PHOENIX

steps, there was perceptible a certain swagger, a certain ostentation, a certain suavity, which provoked a gasp in any who
regarded him. He carried himself like a Tenorio, and he could
not yet talk.
No sooner, however, had the first words flowed from his lips,
in that mellifluous tongue native to his land, than he became a
veritable devil to the fairer sex. There was not in all of Rome a
signorina who might evade his charm. He knew not the word
"rejection." With maids and matrons alike he had his way. He
was adored. He was fawned over. He was sighed at. He was wept
for. And whoever dared to mutter anything offensive to his person was promptly reminded by his many hopeful female pretenders, that great personal beauty is seldom despised, except by
those to whom it is refused.
But, as often happens with the young and attractive, he elected before long to take the low road to the very depths of
debauchery and profligacy. Gambling, women and drink; such
was the trinity of his creed. He thought himself invincible, and
there was no piece of daring or immorality from which he would
shrink. Relatives, neighbors and clergy intervened in the name
of his soul's salvation. But nothing could detain him in his headlong career to the grave and to the devil.
Every Cyclops will in time meet his Ulysses, and so it was
indeed with our gallant, who came to be vanquished by a girl of
seventeen. Indeed she was a beauty, of the breathtaking sort, as
graceful in carriage as young in years. For spite or for pride, she
openly scorned my libertine forebear; and as we must always
desire what is forbid, he fell quickly in love.
But she would have nothing to do with him. He pleaded, she
refused. He fell at her feet in tears, she turned up her pretty
nose. Letters innumerable were sent in his name, all were
received with the same indifference.
Months intervened, and the plight of the scorned lover is so
familiar that I needn't be minute in describing how precipitously he worsened. Suffice it to say that, just upon the day in which
he attained to the age of one and twenty years
that is, just
upon Saint Valentine's day in the year 1943 he was found lifeless in his quarters, his right hand clasping a bottle of poison,
and his left, an unfinished letter, addressed to her who loved
him not. It was signed, like that famous missive of yore, "di tuo

Valentino."

So my grandmother concluded, weeping piteously. At least
he was young, I assuaged her; he had the gods' favor. He mined
the ore of youth, he lived, and good night. The lament should be
for us, who still toil under the yoke of existence.

It stands for...

Vagina,
of course!
BY SETH SIAS
ssiasl@swarthmore.edu
V-Day will come to Swarthmore as a production of "The Vagina
Monologues" begins tonight and continues through Saturday. According to
www.vday.org, "the 'V symbolizes many things. Victory over Violence.
Valentine's Day. And of course, Vagina!"
V-Day was started by Eve Ensler, who wrote "The Vagina Monologues."
Andy Wong 'O2, co-director of Swarthmore's production explains that it is "a
movement that attempts to stop violence against women and girls." It achieves
this goal by allowing colleges to perform "The Vagina Monologues" as "part of
a charity event that will support women," Keetje Kuipers 'O2, one of the per-

formers, said.
The performances at Swarthmore will benefit women in Afghanistan. The
performers are selling candygrams and chocolate as well as accepting donations at each performance. Erica Cartmill 'O3, another performer, is "hoping
that in the spirit of the piece" people will make donations.
The monologues are a "compilation of very empowering ... stories about
women coming to terms with their sexuality," Wong said. There are many
monologues, each representing a different experience, so each viewer may
connect with a different aspect of the production.
Cartmill recognizes that some people view "The Vagina Monologues" as
anti-male. "Yes, it is about women," she acknowledged, "but it's really about
coming to terms with yourself." Cartmill previously performed the piece at
Swarthmore two years ago and recalls that the men who attended really
enjoyed it. She feels that Swarthmore is a good place for the monologues
because "it creates so much dialogue."

"We've become completely desensitized to
words like Vagina' and 'pussy' and 'cunt'"
Keetje Kuipers 'O2
Dialogue has been one of the most important aspects of preparing the show.
Kuipers emphasized the fact that the performers have learned a great deal

about themselves and become more comfortable with their sexualities and
bodies. "We've become completely desensitized to words like Vagina' and
'pussy' and 'cunt' Kuipers said. "A lot of people are surprised."
Because of the frequent dialogues, "the whole experience has been a very
collaborative process" Cartmill said. The piece is "about having a positive
thrust on a community of women," but also about "celebrating women and
"

their sexuality."

Although all the performers are women, one of the directors is a man.
said he thinks some people might be surprised that a man is co-directing "The Vagina Monologues," but his gender has caused no problems for the
people working on the production. Wong has "been very involved with various women's groups on campus," at one point serving as president of the
Feminist Majority, he said. Co-directing "The Vagina Monologues," he said,
Wong

has felt natural.
One of the reasons that the monologues are so important is that "guys
pump themselves up about their penises all the time," Kuipers said. In contrast, "society teaches us to ignore what we have between our legs," she said.
While recognizing the value of the "Vagina Monologues" some people think
there should be a "Penis Diatribe." "I think there should be one," Cartmill
said. "I would go."

In Short: The Vagina Monologues

Gotta get a gimmick: Valentine's Day albums that aren't dull tripe
BY KATE DUFFY
kduffyl@swarthmore. edu

least favorite Beatle once mused,
"Some people want to fill the world with silly
love songs, and what's wrong with that?"
Tsk, Paul! Tsk! This "love song" jive is to
rock 'n' roll what 8-by-11-inch, white slogan
flyers are to a Parrish bulletin board; you
notice a few good ones, but when thousands
appear, it's impossible to pick out the clever
stuff from the bilge.
Thus, friends: I give you gimmick bands.
For the uninitiated, gimmick (or concept)
bands emerge from the bland stew of standard pop by virtue of their bizarre alter egos,
pseudonyms and unusual garb.
Most of
them have some sort of mission to complete
or a philosophy to espouse. Many are from
another galaxy or time period, some are
superhuman and others aren't human at all.
Perhaps gimmick bands aren't all that
romantic; to be sure, more than a few would
delight in boxing love's ears. Nevertheless,
at least one of the albums listed below should
suit your Valentine's Day disposition.
My

If You're In Love...
Servotron, "Entertainment Program
for Humans: Second Variety"

Servotron, a faction of insurgent automatons, delivers its declaration ofunited robotic revolution and subsequent human

A

enslavement in innocuous album form. "In
the future all humans will die. They will all
be annihilated by the Servotron Robot
Allegiance," band member #1 once stated.
Not the cheeriest concept, perhaps, but the
bouncy, Devo- and surf-inspired tunes on
this CD will have you leaping around

insipidly regardless.
In fact, "Entertainment Program for
Humans: Second Variety" is meant to brainwash mortals into being happy and oblivious
to any brewing insurrection, making it a
perfect listen when one is madly in love. The
most gleeful tracks include "I Sing: The Body
Cybernetic," "Erotomatica" and "Tri-Star
Wheel Groove." The songs aren't exactly serenade fodder (unless your girl- or boyfriend
finds the idea of death-by-robot a romantic
one), but they are rollicking good fun. If you
relish Servotron, be sure to check out
Man...or Astro-man? and The Aquabats.

If you're in a bad relationship...
GWAR, "Scumdogs of the Universe"
A motley gang of alien space pirates was
entombed in Antarctica for several millennia (long story; they had obliterated the
dinosaurs and what have you). Relatively
recently, the group was rediscovered by a
Capitalist Records rep named Sleazy P.
Martini who taught them metal riffs and set
them loose to pillage Earth once more. Such
is the mythos of GWAR.

GWAR exemplifies vile, violent gimmick
band prowess. Members with names like

Techno Destructo and Beefcake the Mighty
don giant warlord spike suits, stomp onstage
and perform nauseating tunes like
"Slaughterama," "Pre-Skool Prostitute" and
"We Kill Everything." In 1993, their biographical film "Phallus in Wonderland"
received a Grammy nomination. Yarr;
GWAR rules.
Über-swellity notwithstanding,

GWAR's

musical stylings are less than joy-inducing.
"Scumdogs" can be employed by reluctant
Valentines to hasten an imminent breakup;
one plays the album and one's significant
other up and runs, hopefully forever. The
track "Sick Of You" is particularly apropos:
"Your face is gross, you eat white toast/You
don't know what to do./It's just your luck,
you really

I'm sick of you."

suck/That's all

If you're single and content...
"Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Voodoo Jive:
The Best of Screamin' Jay Hawkins"
Back in the 'sos he aspired to be an opera
singer, but alas: Screamin' Jay Hawkins'
career never left the novelty arena. He made
do by leaping out of coffins during performances, propping a cigar-chomping, flaming
Henry the Skull on a stake, crooning about
voodoo and, as the prototypical death rocker,
enraging the Establishment with his drunken antics.

Screamin' Jay's songs have a traditional
rock ft' roll sound, but there's something
awfully curious about it, too; the man yelps
spastically about spells and alligators as a
baritone sax lays down thick, eerie progressions. It's off-kilter, jumpy jukebox music
that doesn't have much to do with love or
romance or anything silly like that. The
song "Little Demon" is especially grand.

If you've been dumped...
Devo, "Pioneers Who Got Scalped"

Devo, the primordial concept band, gave
us ever so much more than flower pot hats
and "Whip It." The power plant uniforms!
The herky-jerky synthesizer manifestos!

Booji Boy! Typical song topics include techniques of positive mutation, suburban
robots who monitor reality, Mr. Hinky-Dink
and spuds, but girl-related frustrations are
given equal voice.
The 2-disc Devo anthology, "Pioneers
Who Got Scalped," is a must for the recently
dumped. Half the songs are about mutants,
and the other half are about failing relationships; the music is both distracting and
appropriate, in an upbeat, 'Bos manner.
Phrases such as "We're ALL Devo!" and
"Duty now for the future!" will enter your
personal lexicon, and you'll start concentrating on important things like The Truth
About De-Evolution instead of bemoaning
that filthy cad who left you.

NITER'S WORST NIGHTMARE:
Discovering your landlord's
insurance doesn't cover
your stuff.

That's why you should give me a call about renters insurance. I'm right in the neighborhood, offering the same kind
of affordable protection millions of homeowners trust to cover their "stuff."

New dean discusses feminism, handicapped access
FROM SMAW pg. 3
DS: For me, multiculturalism is
just one of the self-descriptors
under how we build a pluralistic
community. You've got students
who are determined in many
ways to build upon their educational experience by being
involved in one or more of these
different types of groups. You
have other students who decide,
"I don't need to or want to affili-

ate with these particular groups;
however, I would like to have the
opportunity to come and develop
some type of relationship as I
need to. And so there may be just
general programming: Here's an
opportunity for X student to
attend a program that's open to
everyone in the community. Or
you may want to be more proactive in reaching them, which
might mean, for example, bringing a speaker on campus or creating an event that is specifically
targeted for the particular groups
of students.

LD: How do you feel about multicultural education in terms of
curriculum changes and teaching
to a variety of cultures?

DS: I think multicultural education embraces the broader view of
"How do we showcase and enable
students to see that education
involves reaching not only where
you are locally but going beyond
that, so we should look at where
your experiences have been as
you grew up as a student, in
whatever part of the world, then
how do you expand on that? And
one looks at a curriculum to see
how faculty have designed particular courses, how departments
have designed particular programs of study. And then you
want to work with faculty, deans,
program chairs to determine,
"How can we expand the offerings
that are currently existing? How
can we work with students who
see that there are some other
issues or programs or areas of
study that they would like to
explore that are not currently
being offered?" So it's a matter of
looking in at what's currently
here
how can we grow and
expand that
and doing that in
concert both with the faculty as
well as listening to student concerns about how we can have
more depth and breadth from a
multicultural perspective.

looking at a "canon" that is your
Western-centered, and so around
the periphery, you have the "oth-

ers," writers and artists who

bring perspectives that are nonEuro-Western-centered. So I don't
think it's a matter of "throwing
out" the canon. I think one should
be able to open it up and expand
it. We're no longer studying and
living in isolation. I don't think
we can afford to just continue to
study a narrow body of knowledge.
LD: How do you perceive women
as a "minority group" or a "cultural group," and in what ways do
you consider yourself a feminist?
DS: In my training, I grew up in a
time when women were starting
to grow in increasing numbers in

their attendance at colleges and
universities around the country
and were a minority group, a protected group. And so one needed
to think in terms of federal regulations that were first targeting
and
then

women. I took on the label of
"feminist" because, through my
own studies, I began to see more
and more women's oppression in
American culture and around the
world. And so it was my responsi-

LD: How do see your role as an
advocate for the handicapped ?

DS: I served as the disability coordinator at both the divinity
school at Harvard as well as at the
school of education, so I'm somewhat familiar with these issues.
How do we assure that all students have equal access? That
means those who might have a
range of disability issues, both
physical and non-physical. That's
working with the college administration, working with the individual who's been designated to represent those concerns and it is
ensuring that the school and its
policies and programs develop in
concerns.

So part of the role of this position
on the whole continuum is to be
that of an advocate.

LD: What is your experience in
acting as an advocate for queer
students, and how do you plan on
addressing their needs as a group
that is present but might not be as
visible as other populations on
campus?

students who are raising a number of issues and concerns that
they feel are not being met, cerDS:

"I think it should be kept somewhere on campus,"
said Fuller. "The globe is distinct and unusual, and I

Seiden said the globe must be out of the library
before the start of the renovations. "Someone will
have to take the globe by then," she said. "Or else
someone will have to take a sledgehammer to it."
Despite this threat of violence, the college would

Miller estimated that

"Anyone taking it

In the end, most people are not pleased to see this
beloved icon go. "I fully dedicate my personal attention and effort to making sure Swarthmore is not a
globeless college," Matt Rubin 'O3 said. "If it is at all
within my power, the globe will continue to enrich

student life."
Fuller, who has worked in the library with the
globe for 27 years, hopes that it will find a loving

But Talbot claimed that the original intention of the workstudy program was to provide aid to needy students. Any community service emphasis was only added later, she said, without
added funds to accommodate the change.
"It is not as though we used work study to defray our own
costs," said Talbot. "I don't think that student labor has
increased since we've gotten the funds."

Bill calls for mandatory service
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES In a move that could redirect high
school graduates from hitting the college books to hitting military targets for the 2004 freshman class, one House representative is calling on America's youth to relearn the meaning of
national unity and obligation to the country.
The bill, House Resolution 3598 proposed by Representative
Nick Smith, would be "phased in" over 10 years and would
require all male high school graduates to partake in "boot camp,"
history/international relations classes and volunteer in national
service programs for at least six months starting in 2004.
Students attending universities in 2004 would not be affected
by the bill and would not need to drop out. The bill, awaiting
review by the House Armed Services Committee, is a revised
version of a bill that was introduced in December. It is one of the
nation's first legislative responses to President Bush's State of
the Union request for every American to commit two years of
service to the country.

Registrar to announce official stance on
government requests for student records
U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act creates concern over privacy issues for foreign students
From STUDENT RECORDS, pg. 3
But after Sept. 11, "the government reconstructed this clause to mean the government's health or safety," Warner said.
"They were making large a very small

loophole."

Warner said the current area of concern
with the U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act is "what we
do after we've given out the information."
According to Warner, the new law does not
say anything about informing the student,
but he believes that it implicitly says the
same as the old law, and the registrar's
office would thus continue to inform students of government inquiries.
In theory, Warner said, a student's academic records could include "anything
with [a student's] name on it that it used
institutionally by more than one person."
The student's grades and most information
about a student in the dean's office would
be included in the student's file.
Despite assurances that the U.S.A.PATRIOT Act is similar to old laws,
Warner is concerned about what the new
law suggested about the future of the
United States. "Though the new law is
structurally very similar to what we had
before, it worries me that the Patriot Act
suggests a reactionary conservatism similar to McCarthyism. I worry about that for
our country, but as far as Swarthmore
College, its students and the registrar's
office, we're basically OK," Warner said.
Thus far, the act has been used to allow
government access to foreign students.
Drescher explained that the U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act applies to all students in the United
States, whether foreign or American citi-

"It's not an illogical leap for the government to say that any student involved in

Once the college has published a statement regarding college policy toward government requests for student records,
SPAC plans to turn its attention to other
checks on civil liberties brought about by

the U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act and other postSept. 11 legislation.
"I think it's important that students are
aware of what their rights are. There are a
lot of civil rights and liberties that we take
for granted, that the Patriot Act calls into
question. The student records issue is just
a part of this." Drescher explained.
The U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act and subsequent legislation has also made it increasingly difficultfor foreign students to study
in the United States.

5

These acts have allotted additional
funding for the implementation of the
Student Exchange and Visitor Information
System (SEVIS), which has been in the
works for the past four years. When implemented, the automated SEVIS will replace
the traditional paper process of collecting,
maintaining and tracking information
about foreign students and visitors with an
automated system.
"We have pretty good records of who
comes in, but we don't have good records of
what they do when they get in and when
they leave," Foreign Student Adviser
Gloria Evans said. The hope is that the
SEVIS system will help government officials better monitor foreign students.
Additionally, other legislation enacted
in the aftermath of Sept. 11 requires extra
fees and information from foreign students
wishing to study in the United States.
Several fees required of foreign students
have increased for 2002, and a new fee for

foreign students wishing to work in the
United States has been enacted, which may
prohibit foreign students from participating in research activities.
Finally, beginning in January 2002, a
new form will be required from nonimmigrant visa applicants. The new form, the
DS-157, supplements current requirements
and requests extensive background information from all male applicants between
the ages of 16 and 45 and all applicants
from select countries, including China,
Russia, Iran and Vietnam.
"For some kids, it might make a difference between staying here
or not,"
Drescher said. "And I think that's a bad

Yo' mamma told you
not to wear hair spray

Badminton aiming to swat Bryn
Mawr for share of PAIAW title

Diary of two women's basketball players:
hair do's and don't's around the court

BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu

BY EMILY GRAY "GRAY IN WIND" AND
CAITLIN "IGOR" RYLAND
egrayl@swarthmore.edu and
crylandl@swarthmore.edu
While it certainly isn't a hot topic on
par with pre-game rituals or shower etiquette (which, by the way, concerns adequate distance between wet, nude flesh
and the "eyes up here" rule), it has come
to our attention that one of the un-uniformed aspects of the female basketball
player is seldom spoken of. Well, at least
never in a positive sense. No one ever
really says, "Have you seen No. 21? Her
hair is rockin'!" More often uttered are
phrases of dismay or unabashed amazement at such poor decision making: Hey,
the center on that team has a mullet!" or
"Her sideburns are more out of control
than Neil Young's!" Sure, sometimes we
are governed by the variables such as
length (after all, it does take quite a bit of
creativity to deal with short hair), degree
of frizz (an inherited birth defect for
some), and the unruly cowlick. We just
ask that the ladies of the court attempt to
abide by the following suggestions.
1. Avoid excessive use of spray-in or
rub-in hair care products. We don't know if
any of you out there have actually tried to
wrestle a greased manatee, but we are
pretty sure that hair lubes and sprays,
when combined with game sweat, result in
a similar sensation to the aforementioned
manatee. Trust us, trying to contain a 6foot woman who has had sweaty gel dripping down her shoulders and onto arms
and uniform is a task for a superhero. We
mortals request that you all even the odds
and refrain from creating a syrupy mess
that we are also fairly confident is responsible for the hole in the ozone layer.
2. According to the referees in the
Centennial Conference, the hair clip and
the bobby pin are equally as deadly as the
shuriken, the switchblade or other such
pointed objects of mass destruction. Now,
we aren't sure if the requested removal of
such items is for the safety of the player
donning said item or the surrounding
"

a worse ass-kicking than one done up in
matching ribbons in their hair. Say your

prayers, baby dolls!
4. Ladies, just say no to purple and any
other colors that are wacky in the context
of hair. Come on, the Dennis Rodman look
didn't even work for Dennis Rodman, and
it's not exactly a model that any of us
should strive to emulate. Are you a basketball player or a punk rocker? A bailer
or someone who can't avoid freaky latenight Kool-Aid experiments? Please note
that preceding warning does not refer to
decent home-dying jobs which are performed with the intent to alter the overall
hair color (we love Julia Roberts as a
brunette). But, you might want to watch
out for that sketchy bleach session that
you let your roommate tackle, because
sister, your nasty dark roots are screaming out to be dealt with!
5. The Dominatrix: This take-charge
woman of the court has not set her black
pointy boots into a salon since about 1985.
She fashions her mane into a braid-whip
that can subordinate the feistiest of challengers. Sure, she teases officials in
warm-up with her sweet demeanor and
tidy 'do, but with the opening whistle, this
seemingly innocent charmer sheds the

Swiss Miss act. She transforms into a haphazard Rapunzel-copter with a swinging
club of death (but mostly blindness) propelling from her head. The Dominatrix
strikes indiscriminately, often blinding
teammates as often as her foes. Ladies,
chop the phallus from your head and
embrace the layered look; you don't look
like Anna Kournikova and you're just
pissing your friends off.
6. The Vagina Monologue: You know
you did it. You know it was wrong. You
created gasp! Vag Bangs! We are willing to forgive you for slaving in front of
the mirror every morning before school
and curling the top half of your bangs up

The team has two games remaining after last night's match against Haverford; results
were not available at press time. The Tide need to win both matches, at home against Bryn
Mawr on Tuesday and at Bryn Mawr next Thursday, to share the title with the Mawrters.
The 3-2 Mawrter/Tide nail-biter was even closer than the score suggests. The first doubles pair of Liz Leininger 'O4 and Wury Morris 'O4 dropped the third and final set of their
match 17-15. Morris said she and Leininger rallied from six points down in the set and tied
the score at 14-14 before losing three of the next four points.
"Since last year, they've been our real competition in the conference," Morris said. At
last year's PAIAW tourney, Leininger and Morris had the last laugh, edging Bryn Mawr's
first doubles squad 17-16 in the third set of semifinals. Morris thinks she and Leininger
are due to win a close match next week.
Captain Karen Lange 'O2, who plays first singles for the Tide, dropped her match to Bryn
Mawr powerhouse Meredith Stoll in straight sets. "I was playing well," Lange said. "I was
just having bad luck getting points." Though Lange has never beaten Stoll, she has notched
more points against her than anyone else in the conference. "Meredith is the best in the conference," Lange said. "But she's not untouchable. I got eight points off her earlier this year."
Lange has also suffered from a elbow injury for most of the season, which has affected
her play somewhat. "I can't smash as well," she said. "That's really the first thing to go."
However, injury has forced her to improve her dropping skills. "When you can't do one
thing, you have to work on others," Lange said.
When the Tide traveled Bryn Athyn on Tuesday, Lange played through her injury to
win her match 9-1 L 11-8,11-9. She rallied from a 6-9 deficit to take the third set. "It just took
me a while to get my swing going," she said.
The team swept Bryn Athyn 5-0, including a straight set victory by Leininger and
Morris. Newcomer America Holloway 'O5 did a solid job filling in for Laurel Beesemyer
'O4 as Eve Gilman 'o2's partner.
Swarthmore will host some of the best badminton players in the region, including representatives from Howard University and Drexel University, at the Northeast Collegiate
Tournament this Sunday. The Bryn Mawr match is next Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.

With this "run em' down" mentality, the women faced
their last regular season dual meet against Washington
last night. The Garnet will take their cheers and shirts to
the Centennial Conference Championships Feb. 22 24.
The men will also sport a team shirt that shows their
distinct team attitude. It portrays a streamlined man pushing off the wall with arms placed tightly together above

are not heading into conferences a favorite to win the title,
it's not out of reach for the young team.

"Dickinson was a surprisingly hard meet due to the fact
that we were three weeks out of training trip, and, at this
time, we unfailingly hit the taper slump," Chris Bussard
'O3 said. "In addition, Dickinson rested prior to the meet
and swam exceedingly well."
However, the "taper slump" didn't prevent the Tide
from racking up its share of event victories. On the men's
side, John Lillvis 'O3 was a triple winner in the 200-yard
individual medley, the 200-yard butterfly and as a member
of the 400-yard medley relay, which he swam with Jake
Ross 'O5, Mike Auerbach 'O5 and Mike Dudley 'O3. Dudley
and David Whitehead 'O3 won the 200-yard freestyle and
the 100-yard freestyle, respectively.
Although the 111-94 victory was not by as large of a margin as the team had hoped, the defending conference champion Garnet women exhibited their noted speed and
endurance against the Devils. Natalie Briones 'O3 was a
triple winner in the 200-yard individual medley, in the 200yard breaststroke and as a member of the 200-yard medley
relay. Melanie Johncilla 'O5 won the 200-yard freestyle,
while Katherine Reed 'O5 placed first in the 500-yard
freestyle. Both women's relay teams just barely edged out

Washington, but we will do our best."
The Shoremen were a dismal 1-4 in the conference and
3-7 overall, while the Swarthmore men were 2-3 in conference and 4-4 overall. Although the meet was not going to
determine any regular season titles, Washington was the
final hurdle for the young team before conferences. The
Tide pulled a 137-67 whitewashing of the Shoremen.
Individual performances were not available at press time.
After the Tidewomen's unbeaten streak was snapped by
Gettysburg two weeks ago, the Shore women were the only
unbeaten team in the Centennial Conference. A lot was on
the line last night. If Washington won, they would clinch
their first regular season dual meet title. If Swarthmore
won, they would be tied with both Washington and
Gettysburg for the regular season title.
But what was on the minds of the swimmers was not
the "what-ifs" but rather what the meet meant for the seniors. "It's been a great season," Amy Auerbach 'O2 said.
"But Washington will be bittersweet, because it is also my

last dual meet."

Unfortunatly for the women swimmers,
the
Shore women proved to be too much for the tired Tide. The
final score: Washington 139, Swarthmore a dismal 67, the
largest point margin the women have lost by this season.
The women are now 8-2 overall and finish the season in
second place in the conference.

Robinson's ability, humility aid Garnet Tide

From ROBINSON, pg.

overtime, Robinson tipped a pass and came up with her
eighth and final steal of the game. The steal allowed
Swarthmore to convert two free throws and secure a threepoint victory.
Robinson's defense, as well as her rebounding, depends
on a mix of speed, athleticism and instinct. Furman
summed up her abilities: "[Robinson] is a Division I player playing Division III."
Robinson's speed allows her to back off defenders and
then move in for steals. Her 4.09 steals per game lead the
conference. The steals also generate a significant portion
of her offense.
"Her defense creates a lot of her offense," said Shibles.
"At least one or two times a game she gets one of those
steals and a fast-break layup."
Speed and instinct make her a serious presence on the
boards, despite her lack of size. She averages 7.9
rebounds per game, eighth best in the conference, and
will often explode for double-figure rebounding performances. Against Hopkins, she grabbed a game-high 17

three-pointer to tie the game. Because fellow starters Kile
and Caitlin Ryland 'O2 had both fouled out, Robinson's

presence was all the more vital.
"I think they were trying to get me the ball," she said,
"especially late in the game after Heather and Caitlin
fouled out."
Robinson's play against Hopkins exemplified two
aspects of her offensive game. First, players look to
Robinson for offense. "I'm always trying to get the ball to
her," said point guard Furman. "I'm always, always looking for her. If she's even close to open I'm giving the ball to
her."
The game also proved how difficult it is to stop her.
Hopkins, like all conference teams, is aware of Robinson,
but her offensive style makes her difficult to guard.
Robinson moves constantly without the ball and usually
positions herself to receive a pass with just enough room
to sink a mid-range jumper. If her defender is guarding her

teammate Kile. "A lot of

Robinson's defensive play this year has her guarding
the best players on the other team. "She shuts down a lot
of the best players in the conference," Shibles said.
"Her speed really is, I think, her greatest asset," Shibles
added. "I don't think many people at the Division 111 level
in our conference have her kind of quickness."

It all adds up to an incredibly versatile offense. "I think

Robinson's offensive statistics put her among the conference elite. She leads the conference in scoring with 19.8
points per game. Her 5L4 percent field goal shooting leads
the team and is tops in the conference among all players
except centers. When it comes to free throws, Robinson is
also unflappable: her 87 percent mark from the line also

A HUMBLE LEADER
Robinson will always give credit to her teammates
before she gives credit to herself. When asked about her 40
points at Hopkins, she replied, "Everyone was playing
really well. We were just playing off each other." When
asked about her eight steals, she said, "I think it was
because everyone else was playing such good defense."
Even on a team that is, as a whole, quite humble,
Robinson's almost bashful humility makes her a natural

team player.

But with ability comes responsibility, and an unexpected leadership presence. Robinson and the team knew she
needed to step up, especially on offense. "That was a big
concern, where we were going to get the points from," said
Furman about the beginning of the season. "I had a conversation with her at the beginning of the year, and said,
'You've got to do this.'
As for Robinson, she didn't expect to step up as much as
she had. Still, she said, "It just came natural."
Robinson's attitude is where she shines as a team
leader, Shibles said. "She just brings a great attitude into
every game. It's an enthusiasm, it's an energy, and she just
loves to have fun out there. And I think that attitude is
"

infectious."

Robinson's leadership presence became clear to the
coaching staff, said Shibles, only after the game against
Franklin
Marshall, which Robinson had to miss. The
team played flat the entire game, shooting under 21 percent
from the field in a 62-44 loss.
"I was talking to my assistants after the F&M game,"
Shibles said. "We felt like the biggest thing we missed
about [Katie] in that game was her incredible enthusiasm
and her leadership." After the coaching staff was tuned in
to her leadership, added Shibles, it became obvious how
important she was in the team's next game at Hopkins.
There was Katie, before the game, pumping up the entire
team.
Shibles couldn't be happier with the result, not just in
the Hopkins game, but for the entire season. "We didn't
come into the season feeling like Katie Robinson was

With the spring tennis season just beginning, the men's tennis team
has in its sights a number of Division I opponents. Last Saturday,
the Garnet Tide defeated Mount Saint Mary's 5-0 and edged St.

Joseph's 3-2.

This weekend, the Garnet face off against Division I Temple
University here at Swarthmore at 11 a.m. John Thomas, pictured left
in action last Saturday, leads the team intobattle as the only senior
on a team dominated by youth. Thomas, who plays No. 1 singles,
has a tough road ahead, beginning with Temple's strong first

singles player.

The team is also expecting good things from Ben Rae 'O4,
according to head coach Mike Mullan, who is in his 24th season.
Rae's improvement has been immense over the last year, said

Mullan and others on the team.
The Garnet Tide does not begin its regional schedule until March
20, when it faces off against Salisbury State, but the Tide have a
full slate of matches to tune the team for the regional matches. The
schedule includes a spring break trip to California, where the
Garnet Tide will face University of California at Berkeley, Sonoma
State and UC-Davis.

Robinson leads
Garnet Tide
into playoffs
BY BRENDAN KARCH
bkarchl@swarthmore.edu
The tension and excitement are quickly building for the
women's basketball team. With a guaranteed spot in the
Centennial Conference playoffs, which start next
Wednesday, the team will be looking to defend last year's
conference title.
The team's success this year has come from a mixture
of selfless team play and individual talent. Forward
Heather Kile 'O2 has continued to anchor the team with her
post presence on both offense and defense. Point guard Ali
Furman 'O3 has become the team's primary ball-handler
and play-caller and has proven a solid offensive threat on
mostly seniors
the perimeter. A cadre of role players
and first-years has provided the Garnet with solid team
defense, a deep bench and a range of offensive weapons.
But any account of the team's success would be sorely
lacking if it failed to include guard Katie Robinson 'O3. In
just her second year, she has stepped up to lead the team in
scoring and steals and is second in rebounds. At Johns
Hopkins last week, in the team's most exciting win this
season, Robinson broke the school's single-game scoring
