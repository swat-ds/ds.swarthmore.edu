Ville Residents Fear Collegeâ€™s
Interference in Development
by Kathryn Tong
Plans for a market research survey for the
renovation of Swarthmore's business district
have been delayed after concerns arose that
members of the Strategic Planning Committee may have conflicts ofinterest. The members in question include Lisa Aaron, wife of
English professor Peter Schmidt, Associate
Vice President Larry Schall, Chairman of the
Board of Managers Larry Shane, and Paul
Aslanian, Vice president ofFinance and Planning. Residents fear that the committee will
thus place a higher priority on the interests
of the College than the interests of the town.
The accusations have appeared in a number of letters to the editor in The
Swarthmorean, during the past few weeks. A
frontpage article also appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer on February 12th, entitled,
"Plans Tear a Town-Gown Closeness," suggesting that there is a strain between the College and the residents.
Last fall, the borough and the College
formed the Strategic Planning Committee,
consisting of 11 people, 8 members directly
representing the borough and 3 holding official positions at the College. The committee

Chris Rodger '9B, Issac Reed 'OO, David Plante 'OO, and Chris Muth '9B (from left to right) bared their chests in an
unreserved display of school spirit during the men's basketball game against Haverford last Saturday night. Inspired by the
deafening cheering efforts of the foursome and a packed home crowd, the team clinched its first victory of the season,
crushing Haverford 66-49, finally putting an end to a 23-game drought. See story on page 8.

Students Organize To Oppose U.S. Iraqi Policy
by Nate Stulman
The recent international crisis in the
Middle East has spurred the formation
of a new student organization called
the Iraqi Peace Action Group, whose
goal is draw attention to U.S. policy
in the Middle East.
Some thirty to forty students met in
Parrish Parlors on Monday and discussed a variety of options to raise
campus awareness of the problems and
perceived shortcomings of U.S. and
international policies against Iraq.
Tara Schubert '9B organized the
meeting. "The developments of the
past several weeks came as a surprise
to many people and caught us off
guard. I heard about peace movements
at other campuses around the country
and thought that, of all places, Swarthmore should have some kind of a
movement," says Schubert.
The group met with Sociology professor Lisa Hajjar on Wednesday.
Hajjar is a critic ofU.S. policy and has
spoken to various media outlets in recent weeks opposing U.S. military
strikes and U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
"Any American military action
would necessarily undermineAmerican objectives in the Middle East,"
says Hajjar. "The only means to elimi-

nate weapons of mass destruction is

through inspections. There is no way
that bombings or military campaigns
will destroy the weapons."
Hajjar believes Iraq is being unfairly
targeted by the U.S. and the U.N.
"When the U.S. acts unilaterally, when
Iraq is targeted exclusively," she says,
"we ignore the fact that chemical and
biological weapons are a regional problem
a part of a regional arms race
in the Middle East."
U.S. plans to use force against Iraq
were put on hold Monday, following
successful negotiations between U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in
Baghdad. The U.S. has given tentative approval to a deal worked out between the U.N. and Iraq that would
open Iraqi sites to U.N. inspectors. The
U.N. has seeking to prevent Iraq from
developing nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons since theconclusion
of the Persian Gulf War 1991.
Swarthmore's Iraqi Peace Action
Group is hoping to organize a teach-in
on campus involving students, professors, and analysts like Hajjar to discuss
what it believes to be better options for
dealing with Iraq than military strikes
and sanctions. Students are also exploring the possibility of a letter writ-

Noted Sci-Fi Writer
To Speak at LPAC
by Phoenix Staff
Sunday evening, March 1, at 8:00 in the LPAC Cinema,
science fiction writer Octavia E. Butler will discuss her writ-

ing.
Butler, who has been called "the grande dame [of science
fiction]" and whose prose style invites comparisons with the
likes ofKate Wilhelm and Ursula Le Guin, is the author of
10 novels "so far" and a collection of short stories. Her stories have earned both of science fiction's highest awards, the
Hugo Award twice and the NebulaAward for Best Novelette.
Ms. Butler has described herself as "an oil-and-water combination of ambition, laziness, insecurity, certainty, and drive."
She is a 1995 recipient of a Mac Arthur Fellowship.
The talk will be followed by refreshments in the LPAC
lobby where copies of Butler's books will be available. She
will also be present for an open discussion with students and
science fiction buffs on Monday, March 2, at 10:00 a.m. in
the Scheuer Room.
Butler's visit is sponsored by the Mellon Minority Undergraduate Fellowship Program, the Department of English Literature, and the Black Studies Program.

was in the process of choosing which company will conduct this study.
Aaron, chairperson of the committee announced at the Swarthmore Borough Council meeting on February 9th that she would
abstain from voting on issues regarding the
Strategic Planning Committee where the
College's interests could be potentially at
stake. "I did this so that there would be no
question that could be raised about a conflict
of interest... I have no professional relationship with the College at all," she says.
Aaron says that she asked the legal counsel
to the borough, Rick Lowe, to evaluate the
Strategic Planning Committee to ensure that
there are no legal violations. Lowe says that
the members of the committee do not have a
conflict ofinterest. He explains that the committee has no power to make decisions, but
is simply an advisory board that gives its suggestions to the Swarthmore Borough Council, who makes the final decision. "There is
nothing under the law that shows that there
is a violation," he says. Lowe plans to send a
letter to the Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission to assert his beliefs. "The commissee Ville, page

Students and staff across campus were left in the dark
Thursday night after a power failure dimmed campus
for nearly an hour. According to Swarthmore Public
Safety Sergeant Mike McMahon, the blackout also affected parts of the borough of Swarthmore and half of
Springfield Township. At press time, there were conflicting reports coming from PECO Energy, Springfield
Township police, and Public Safety as to what caused
the power outage.
According to PECO Energy spokesperson Tom
Armstrong, the outage occurred at 6:19 p.m. after a cable
malfunction in Springfield Township. Twenty-nine customers, mostly businesses, were affected, the bulk of
which were on the Baltimore Pike between the Springfield Mall and Route 420. Power was restored to all by
7:07 p.m.
Contrary to early rumors, the power failure was apparently not caused by a car accident or a fire on the
Baltimore Pike. College Public Safety initially reported
that a "[car] accident hit a transformer in Springfield
Township," while others believed a brush fire at the
corner of Route 320 and the Baltimore Pike to be the

Chideya: Media Perpetuates Racial Stereotypes
By Tamara Onwuegbuzia
This past Monday, award-winning
journalist and author Farai Chideya
lectured on the media's role in perpetuating racial stereotypes. As a black
woman journalist working in an environment where she feels careless reporting is prevalent, Chideya explained how
misinformation by the
media results
in misinterpretation by
the general
public.
"The media
is one of the

primary translators
of
American experiences,"
Chideya said.
She indicated
in her lecture
that people
often look to
the media in
order to find

fear and/or embrace. "The judgments
we make as a result of media influence affects the ways in which we interact with people on a daily basis,"
she said. "Evaluating and understanding our own viewing and reading habits will help to create a more accurate
it is imporunderstanding ofissues
tant to read across ideological and cultural lines in order to find the most precise version of the truth."
In her discussion on race and the
media, Chideya also touched upon the
growth of a highly diverse America.
Diversity she claims is "neither good

or bad
it is only potential
the
potential to create either unity or
chaos."
In an interview after the lecture,
Ms. Chideya expanded upon herbeliefs about diversity and related them
to the college experience:
Tamara: Your article in the recent
edition of VIBE magazine discusses
the rapid
growth of
a majority/
minority
nation. Do
you feel
that colleges and
universities like
Swarthmore or
Harvard
where you
attended
should
make
a
special effort to reflect this
Uzoamaka Ngezwu

growth
through

the admissions process?
Farai: Most definitely! The reality
is that top colleges like Swarthmore
train the elite of the future. Right
now, even though America is very
diverse, theelite is composed primarily of white males. We have a situation where white males alone are responsible for making decisions for
people of all races. It is important
for minority students to be able to
obtain top-notch educations not only
because it will provide them with the
tools necessary to understand the
world, but because of the networks

that students attending Swarthmore or
Harvard have access to
networks
which translate into a greater chance
of being able to influence the outcome
of important policy-related issues in
the future.
Tamara: How would you respond to
claims suggesting that greater commitments to diversity at the college
level is synonymous to the lowering
of high academic standards?
Farai: Basically, it all goes back to
the classic affirmative action argument
that the presence of a substantial number ofblacks and Latinos
equals low standards. I believe such
a notion to be absolutely false, especially when one takes a good look at
the reality of minorities both in the
workplace and in academic environments. Particularly in the workplace,
one would not find a decrease in productivity simply because there are
more blacks or Latinos employed.
However, in education there does exist a bit of a problem when some students first enter college
especially
when there are black and Latino kids
coming from really bad public
schools and are thrust into a situation
where they must compete with students who have had the privilege of
obtaining a superior education all of
their lives. Many of the academically
disadvantaged students usually can
and do compete when given the necessary support and tools. That is why
colleges and universities should
implement tutorial and pre-enrollment preparation programs for freshmen. Such programs should be designed with the intent of ensuring that
the transition process is a comfortable
and productive one. Academic success has nothing to do with intelligence per se, but with adequate prepa-

ration.

Tamara: Your book Don't Believe
The Hype does a wonderful job at
providing factual information in response to many of the misconceptions that exist about blacks in
America. What exactly inspired you
to write the book? Do you feel that a
more conscious effort by colleges to
dispel racial, gender, and sexuality
oriented stereotypes can make the
college experience a more pleasant
and productive one for all students?
Farai: My book was inspired
mainly by my own experiences. I had
a boss once that gave me an extremely hard time because he believed so many stereotypes about
blacks to be true. So I decided to enlighten him and others like him with
the facts. At a school like Swarthmore, students are at an advantage
because they are exposed to various
dimensions of diversity in addition
to a superior education. However,
what often happens is that despite the
diversity of the population, students
will develop links with people who
are just like them.Then you have issues like black self-segregation that
becomes the focus of the rest of the
campus community. People will see
a group of black students always
hanging out together and it becomes
a problem
but when a group of
white students always hang out together, it is not seen as a problem.
There will never be solidarity between different groups on campus
whether it be blacks, women, or the
PolishAmerican club unless there is
a genuine desire on behalf ofboth the
college and the students to encourage people to mix. It's a tough job,
but it is something that must be done.

A Note From the Editors
As the Editors-In-Chief ofThe Phoenix, we are responsible for what we put in
the paper, and we are prepared to face the consequences of our actions. That is
why we had lengthy discussions last week before printing letters from Bradley
R. Smith, Holocaust denier, and two students from Oberlin who disagreed with
our characterization of Smith's pamphlet.
Faced with the prospect of, on one hand, a campus outcry about Holocaust
denial, and, on the other hand, the suppression ofcriticism against The Phoenix,
we chose to bite the bullet and print the letters, regardless of our personal feelings about them.
We have for a long time received letters, pamphlets, and booklets from Bradley Smith. We never considered printing them, as they were not related to life on
this campus, and were not direct letters to The Phoenix, nor were they responses
to Phoenix material.
Last week was different. The letter we received from Bradley Smith was in
direct response to an article about his pamphlets in the previous issue. We made
a rational attempt to justify both courses ofaction: print the letters and suffer the
consequences, or refuse to print the letters and suppress criticism of S warthmore
and the Phoenix. We chose the former, and feel completely justified in doing so.
It must be made clear that even though Bradley Smith's letter contains much
rhetoric that some find offensive, its primary purpose is to respond to a Phoenix
piece about him. We felt, and continue to feel, that Bradley Smith has the right
to respond, even if the rest of the world finds his ideas repugnant.
We agree that we didn't have to print his letter. Indeed, there are many arguments against printing tirades that deny the Holocaust. We wonder what the
argument is, however, for suppressing Bradley Smith, and suppressing his responses to what we print about him. For us, that is journalistic irresponsibility,
and we will have no part in the outright dismissal of a person's right to participate in open discussion simply based on offensive ideas that he has.
Moreover, much criticism of The, Phoenix in the past week has focused on
why we printed letters from people 'outside the Swarthmore community.' Though
we wonder exactly what the definition of the Swarthmore community is, we
need to point out that the Phoenix is published in an on-line edition accessible
throughout the world, and most letters to the Editor come through e-mail. What
does insulating ourselves in a 2,000-person academic community in suburban
Philadelphia accomplish? Instituting some kind of xenophobic letter policy is
small-minded and inappropriate, especially when the letters address issues that
are germaine to The Phoenix.
We apologize to those who were offended by the letters, but we ask you to
consider that sometimes the price of freedom is that offensive ideas can come to
the fore. A strong intellectual community will be quick in its logical condemnation ofoffensive ideas, assured in its justified stance, and confident of the rights
of others to express themselves.

US News Rankings Misleading
Last week, on the eve of the release of the annual US News and World Report
graduate school rankings, a coalition oflaw schools sent prospective applicants a
pamphlet detailing a study challenging the credibility of the magazine's survey.
According to the corresponding New York Times article, because law firms,
alumni/ae and applicants alike have become over-sensitized to the yearly evaluation, law school deans across the nation claim, schools have had to readjust their
recruitment and admissions strategies simply to stay afloat. Their independence
has been held hostage to an unscientific yet extremely influential analysis, the
deans lament.

Yet US News is much more ambitious academics is only one of the many

The rankings do roughly correspond with the general consensus on academic

the best school in the nation. What does it mean that Swarthmore is ranked a spot
ahead of Amherst? Does it mean that Swarthmore is better academically than

The bottom line is that you simply can't rank schools in such a refined fashion.
And any system of ranking, as a matter of fact, inherently lends a sense of

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Holocaust Deniers Lack Any Shred of Evidence
To the Editor:
The History Department wants to add its
voice to those at Swarthmore who have been
disturbed by the distribution of Holocaust
denial literature at the College. We want to
make it clear, first of all, that Holocaust deniers are not engaged in historical inquiry.
There is a differencebetween denying the past
and reinterpreting the past. Historians are
continually engaged in a dialogue with each
other regarding how to interpret historical
events. As new sources come to light, scholars subject them to critical analysis, thereby
adding to our understanding and knowledge
of the past. But they do not question the actuality of abundantly documented events.
Our understanding of the Holocaust may be
imperfect in terms of causes and motivations,
but historians do not question the fact that the
German government during World War II deliberately and systematically killed millions
of Jews and other Europeans. The existence
of materials that deny the occurrence of the
Holocaust does not mean that such materials
are to be believed. Not all documents carry
the same weight in interpretation.
For example, individuals or groups might
open a Website and post documents attesting
to the flatness of the Earth, but that would not
mean that these materials were accurate. Similarly, the individual documents deployed by
Holocaust deniers, each of which may cast
doubt on a specific aspect of the Holocaust,
do not as a whole constitute an argument
against its historical existence. We need to
learn how to assess the veracity of what we
read about the Holocaust, and the historian's
craft provides the tools to do so. Historians

regard evidence (oral, written and physical)
of the Holocaust as so overwhelming by its
quality and consistency that the Nazi policy
of genocide is irrefutable. Denial of the Holocaust is a malicious disregard of historical
evidence.
The Department also is disturbed by the willingness ofThe Phoenix to provide a forum for
Holocaust deniers. The First Amendment is
not involved here, and the editors ofThe Phoenix would not be infringing on the free speech
rights ofanyone if it chose not to print letters
such as those that appeared in the February 20
issue. Just as The Phoenix is not required to
accept all advertisements, so too is it under no
legal or constitutional obligation to publish all
letters to the editor. The Department is also
curious whether it is standard practice forThe
Phoenix to publish letters from persons who
are not members of the College community.
Holocaust deniers are allowed to say and write
whatever they want, but we do wonder why
the editors decided to provide a forum for
them. By doing so, the editors inadvertently
helped propagate the views of Holocaust deniers. This does not contribute to the intellectual life of the College, and itobfuscates rather
than clarifies what is at stake in studying the
Holocaust.
Finally, the Department recommends
Deborah Lipstadt's Denying the Holocaust for
those interested in learning more about the
phenomenon ofHolocaust denial. Or you can

Support Groups Necessary To Maintain Diversity
To the Editor,
Swarthmore College is a
community devoted to excellence through diversity. As a
result of the rapid rate at
which we are becoming more
diverse, it is necessary to provide a support system in
which minority students can
feel comfortable. The climate
that a Swarthmore education
demands is one in which every community member feels
safe and secure. Support

groups foster an understanding
that allows minorities to participate in the larger arena of
campus life. Although at times
support groups can create an
exclusive atmosphere in that
they are affiliated with specific
ethnicities, religions, or sexual
orientations, they are more
than justified through their
various outreach activities and
the opportunities for dialogue
that they create. Student
Council fully reaffirms its

commitment to support groups
and diversity on campus. In
addition Student Council will
work with support groups and
the student body at large to collectively strive towards a more
diversity on campus. In addition Student Council will work
with support groups and the
student body at large to collectively strive towards a more diverse, understanding, and safe
campus.

To the Editor:
Holocaust "revisionism" does not exist.'
Unfortunately, Holocaust denial does exist.
Mountains of evidence of every sort, decades of exacting scholarship, and statements by government and other leaders in
countries in which the Holocaust occurred,
all concur that Jews, along with gypsies,
Communists, and other targeted populations, were systematically exterminated as
a matter of state policy within Nazi-controlled Europe. Despite this abundant and'
vWdely-availalble information, individuals
and groups shamefully continue to deny that
the Holocaust occurred.
No matter what sophistries and rhetorical
strategies they devise, moreover, and no
matter how hard they try to cloak themselves
in mantles of truth-seeking, objectivity, and
victimization, Holocaust deniers place
themselves firmly and unambiguously in
that long and sorry tradition of antiSemitism that, together with similar forms
of hate-mongering, disfigure human sociâ€¢
ety.

ANDREW BRYCE

Let No Voice
Be Silenced

by Bryan Gobin

An ugly issue has once again shown its face
at Swarthmore. There is once again a "hate
speech debate," as The Phoenix called it two
weeks ago. I remember there being a similar
controversy last year, and I remember myself
writing an article or two about it. I remember
hoping and wishing that, at least in places such
as Swarthmore, humanity wouldbe able to transcend beyond the need for such an issue, that
we would be able to let go of our hatred so that
no one would ever again feel the need for what
is called "hate speech."
Well, that has not happened, obviously. The
Mertz bathroom graffiti last semester and the
brochure on the Holocaust have acted as spurs
on the foot of a rider, and have dug their heels
in the flanks of the administration; the Diversity Task Force is planning to "look into" our
current policy on hate speech, while the administration still investigates this most recent perpetration. I must ask them: to what end? What
is their goal as college administrators in taking
such action? Is it punishment of the people
who commit these "crimes"? Is it the removal
of such speech from our college community?
Regardless, the final end, the ultimate goal of
any speech policy is singularly obvious: silence.
Do you think it melodramatic to use the word
"silence"? You might be right; after all, not all
speech is being silenced, just that which we believ&people should not say. We see speech that
is hurtful and distasteful, and so we say to the
speaker, "You can't say that." Why is this
wrong? Why should we not use "you can't say
that" as a policy against words that we do not
want to hear? It is wrong because "you can't
say that" is just as bald a statement of loathing
as the statements against which it is targeted.

The minorities insulted and targeted by the initial hate speech do not fling hateful words
backâ€”for that would be blatantly hypocriticalâ€”and opt instead for other means ofexpressing their dislike and hatred and choose to implement a speech policy, a policy that openly states
"Shut up."
I agree completely: one should not speak
words ofabhorrence and ignorance. I also think
that one should not cheat on one's husband or
wife, one should not skip class, one should not
keep books late from McCabe, one should not
vote Republican, one should not eat too much
Lucky Charms, and above all, one should not
say to anyone, "You can't say that." It was the
war cry of Orwell's Big Brother; even though
it is now much more innocently and benevolently used, the principle remains the same behind it.
When the government wanted to make flag
burning illegal, I cried out in outrage; when I
am shouted down in a room of conservatives
fcjr speaking my liberal views, I seethe with
anger. Here I see the same problem arising:
people want to keep themselves safe, and I can
understand that completely; we all deserve to
be safe. But we also all have voices, we have
our own thoughts and our own feelings. I believe that the people who perpetrate hate speech
are ignorant, and that they do not act on any
reason other than their own misguided gut feelings. The problem is that the gut instinct to
feel safe or even a little vindicated is just as
strong, and reacts just as quickly and with little
rational thought. There is always a knee-jerk
reaction to such powerful gut instincts as those
of the hate-speaker; when the world punished
Germany for World War I, Hitler rose and punished the world. When, long ago, your little
brother hit you, you hit him back. When someone says that he hates Jews or gays or whomever, that group turns quickly around and says,
"Shut up! You can't say that!"
Swarthmore is a wonderful place, but it is not

We are not here to simply be happy, and, regardless of what anything might say, we are
not simply an academic institution. If our sole
purpose were academics and academic environment, why does the college pay for so much
more? We are here to be a part of Life, and
Life, regardless of how much we all ache for it
not to be so, has a lot of problems and a lot of
hatred held within its cloak. We are not a separate body; even though Swarthmore sometimes
seems like a bubble that has its own set of principles and its own agenda, we still play a major
role in the world, and so we cannot ignore the
Principles that dominate the world. Yes, we

Shattering the African Myth:
Sweet Vindication for Nigeria
by

Jude Uzonwanne

A fascinating development is underway in West Africa.
Last week, an African military mission, led by Nigeria,
forced out of power an illegal military dictatorship. The
regime in question, illegal because no country had accorded it international recognition, was led by Lt. Colonel Johnny Koromah. After seizing power in a May 1997
coup from a democratically-elected civilian government,
it was forced to the negotiation table by a combination of
economic sanctions and eventually a naval blockade. The
decision to use force to dislodge the government was taken
because the Koromah junta had gone back on a diplomatic agreement signed in October 1997 that would have
peacefully returned the deposed Tejan Kabbah civilian
government to power.
For observers, thefact that Nigeria, itselfruled by a military government, provided the driving impetus for the mission is grounds for cynical dismissal of the project. Critics of the intervention argue that it was illegal, in violation of Sierra Leonean sovereignty, and designed to bolster the international image of Nigerian head of state,
General Sani Abacha, as a regional power broker. Why,
demandcritics, should Nigeria back such an intervention,
when its own military government is under international
sanctions for a less-than-stellar human rights record,
among other ills? And isn't this evidence of Nigeria's secret ambitions to dominateWest Africa, and sub-Saharan
Africa?At one level, the critics do have a point. Nigeria's
own domestic political reputation would not immediately
recommend her as regional peace maker, except for one
caveat.

In a widely read 1995Atlantic Monthly piece (The Coming Anarchy, Feb. 1995), international journalist and commentator Robert Kaplan argued that West Africa's political instability, brush wars, and economic difficulties constitute the
model for the future ofAfrica, and
non-western portions of the world.
Writing at the height of the brutal
Liberian civil war, Kaplan's
surefooted pessimism seemed like
the sole way out. Read at senior
levels of the United States government (including President Clinton), Kaplan's piece generated two sets of reactions: frustrated anger and studied silence. The frustrated
folks were mostly Africa experts, who felt helpless. The
frustrated folks in Washington did rally around and helped
created a Clinton Administration initiative, the Africa
Crisis Response Force (ACRF), a multinational military
group that would intervene in any future conflicts on the
continent. The silent ones were some Africa experts, but
mostly African leaders and governments. The silent ones
largely refused to dignify Kaplan because at that point, a
young peace keeping mission, led by Nigerian troops
(15,000 at the height of the deployment), were trying to
end the Liberian civil war.
As of today, that war is over, elections have been held,
and Liberia is at peace. And the ACRF? It remains embryonic because the United States government refused to
involve the Nigerian military, arguing the line I attributed
to critics earlier. As a result the knowledge gains, sharing
both countries experience with peace keeping might have
generated, is yet to materialize. That is however chang-

ing. After a successful assault that lasted approximately 5
days, Nigerian troops captured Sierra Leone, and in the
process gained, albeit grudgingly, America's respect. As
a result, Nigeria's Chiefof GeneralStaff earlierthis week
met with the American admiral in charge of the ACRF to
exchange notes.
However, what does the experience in Sierra Leone really mean? For starters, it has once again confirmed that
African states are capable historical actors who can evaluate a situation and map out a solution regardless of whether
the world wants to support them or not. For too long we
waited for the United Nations Security Council to come
to our help. Like clockwork, the American or French governments always blocked intervention if it did not suit
their interest as was the case in Rwanda circa 1994. The
intervention by African troops in the
country formerly known as Zaire in
1997 put an end to that dependence.
The Nigeria-led mission to Sierra
Leone has confirmed that trend.
Equally importantly, it marks the beginning of the end of Robert
Kaplan's infamous forecasts. For
analysts who work on West Africa, Kaplan's piece was
perhaps the most intellectually damaging thing to have
been written in a decade. Nigeria's military victory has
ended that. Nevertheless, for the conceivable future, Nigerian troops will help secure the peace, and provide a
stabilizing force while President Kabbah's government
gets back to the task of nation building. For some critics,
this is difficult to swallow. But as perceptive readers of
Niccolo Machiavelli will point out, it is justified to use
such means to build a just state. Ideally, nation states without blemish should do what happened in Sierra Leone,
but regardless of what is ideal, a difficult situation nevertheless must be resolved.
The recent success is testimony to the coming-of-age of
the Nigerian army, which will no doubt facilitate the transition to a civil society
in the Nigerian case what
Clausewitz calls the "Holy Trinity" between the national
assembly, the military and the executive. Once again,
Nigeria's military will be made up of men and women
who have earned their medals at the forefront of battle,
and not behind a desk planning coup d'etat.

Hate speech policy
isn't the solution.

People tend to glamorize the work of non-profit organizations as if the singular fact that they do not have
a profit incentive gives them moral superiority. Ditto
for state-owned or managed organizations. Granted
some non-profits produce important social goods that
would not otherwise be generated by profit motives,
but my focus here is on agencies that are grossly inefficient and are staffed by directors that use moralistic
rhetoric to shield themselves against accusations of
incompetence. Let us put on our economist thinking
cap for a moment and pretend that directors of nonprofit organizations are optimizing a particular set of
variables, for example, the director of the Love Low
Income People Agency (LLIPA) will optimize among
the variables explicitly tied to the agency mission:
housing, education, employment, and civil rights. Our
LLIPA director will also be optimizing personal preference variableslike office space, size ofagency (more
employees to manage equals more prestige), agency
budget, salaries, prestige, fringe benefits, and
workload.
Now, in our ideal worldview of non-profits, our courageous LLIPA director would optimize among only
the first set of variables leading to the production of
more social good. Our normative desires make us
want to believe that the LLIPA director will efficiently
allocate resources within her agency to promote the
agency mission and maximize output of social good.
But our LLIPA director is just a mortal like the rest of
us and probably has a preference profile that includes
items that are secondary to the explicit agency mission. As a career non-profit director with a family to
feed and so forth, our LLIPA director who has made
great personal sacrifice to "do the right thing" might
feel entitled to certain perks, and certainly has personal preferences in regards to variables independent
of the agency mission.
In our worst case scenario, the director chooses the
optimization function that gives the least weight to
explicit agency mission objectives and the most weight
to unrelatedpreferences, hence we have a director that
produces the minimal social good required to keep
her joband maximizes her preferences for salary, benefits, office size, budget, and workload. Then there is
the problem of accountability. Unless there are exceptionally active board members, it is highly unlikely
that the director will be held accountable since evaluation of the productivity "bottom-line" requires time,
skill, and energy, not a combination typical of most
board members. In the non-profit world there is no
singular incentive to encourage efficiency with the corresponding weight of the profit motive faced by managers of private firms. Common non-profit management excuses for poor performance include overworked staff, insufficient funds, and so forth. At a
certain point, you have to ask some questions. If your
current strategies are not producing satisfactory results, what steps are you taking to identify implementation problems and alternative solutions? What
deliverables have you produced for your clients (lowincome people) that justify your salary? Why don't
you have standard operating procedures, internal performance evaluations, and better staff management?
Non-profit directors face strong incentives to raise
money simply for the sake of spending it (on their
salaries) rather than producing social good. Social
welfare programs have generated a web of bureaucracies, non-profits, and private contractors that have
institutionalized their role as poverty pimps. Just as
Clinton promised to change welfare as we know it,
another administration will face the task of cleaning
up the mess created by shabby welfare-to-work programs administered by incompetent private contractors and non-profits agencies. Everybody gets paid
except the poor.

from Farai Chideya, page 1
Tamara: I hear that you have a new book that is due out soon. Can you
tell us a little more about the book
the title, some of the specific topics
that you discuss, etc.?
Farai: Well, the book is entitled What Color Is The Future? and it is
scheduled to be released in September. The book is sort of a journey into
the minds of a diverse spectrum ofyoung people throughout the country.
I go from state to state looking at different issues that relate to
multiculturalism in America
for instance, I focus on biracial identity
Los
because
Los
in
Angeles
Angeles has the highest concentration of
biracial Americans. I also go to the Croix Indian reservation in Montana
to gain a different type of perspective. That was quite interesting because
while issues like welfare were similar to that of blacks, the Croix Indians, unlike blacks, voluntarily segregated themselves like a separate nation with their own rules, police force, and taxes. Basically, my book is a
look at how different people live their lives and how race affects them.
Tamara: Do you have any last comments that you would like to share
with the Swarthmore community?
Farai: I just want to say that college provides the best opportunity for
people to truly discuss diversity issues. Students at Swarthmore should
take advantage of the opportunity to dialogue because unlike in the
workforce, if you speak up you won't get fired or be asked to focus on
something else.

sion will make a decision as to
whether this is a ethical violation
or not. I expect that they will say
there is no conflict."
Residents are concerned because
the Strategic Planning Committee
planned to have the market research
study first survey the general public to assess what kind ofbusinesses
would thrive in the town, says
Shane. The second phase of the
research study was to evaluate what
the entire community wanted to
renovate in the business district.
At a crowded open town meeting
on February 17th, a number ofresidents voiced their concerns. One
woman said, "I think that the market study should be given to the
town first and see how we feel."
Many longtime residents were not
in favor of changing the current
look of the town. Several people
also said they were worried that
Swarthmore would become a "wet"
borough, although no steps have
been made by the Borough Council to change the town's alcohol
policy.
"I think that we have not heard
from the majority of the people in
this town," says Shane. Aaron con-

curs, saying that she knows of a
number of people who are happy
about the possibility of a renovation, although they have not yet
come to any of the open meetings.
Students at the College have also
been absent from the town hall

meetings.
On behalf of the College,
Maurice Eldridge, Vice President
for College and Community Relations, tried to reassure detractors
of the College's benign intentions.
"We're not pushing anything but
mutual interest [and] discovering
what those are," he said.
Also brought up at the beginning
of the meeting last week were
plans to gather public opinion, a
process consisting offocus group
questionnaires and some interactive groups. The committee plans
to commission a professional firm
to conduct the survey and hopes
to have at least 10 percent of the
population participate.
Although the renovation of the
business district is facing many obstacles, Shane and Aaron are still
optimistic that the College and the
borough will be able to work cooperatively to improve the district
in a way such that the entire community can benefit.

CIVIC Expands to Include Grant Program
by Alma Ortiz
Swarthmore's community service umbrella, CIVIC, has expanded this year with
four new programs to complement the eleven
other programs are already running. The new
programs under CIVIC include an adult literacy program at Delaware County Prison;
a gardening project with family shelters near
Media; City Team, a church based, afterschool group for helping students with their
homework; and LEAP, a literacy program for
Asian Adults in Kensington.
But although the number of community
service projects has increased, attendance in
certain programshas been thinning out. Erika
Krick '9B, co-coordinator of the Homework
Enrichment Program (HEP) in Chester,
claims that the number of volunteers in the
program has decreased over the past four
years that she has been at Swarthmore. Regardless oflow numbers, Krick believes HEP
will continue in the coming years, but the
negative side to low volunteer numbers is that
the focus of the coordinators has to shift from
working with the kids to recruiting tutors.
Another new opportunity fostering community service at Swarthmore this year is
the availability ofLang Opportunity Grants,
made possible by College benefactor Eugene

Lang '3B.
Lang Opportunity Grants are open to the general student body except for those graduating in
June.Awards of up to $lO,OOO are available for
the creation of community service projects that
will make needed improvements. There are also
sl,ooo-grants for students who need to take
classes to further investigate ideas for projects.
Certain special requirements will shape the
selection process for the Opportunity Grants.
The proposed plan must be original or innovative in either methodology or model. It must also
be practical, feasible, repeatable and self-sustainable. Students must have at least a B average at Swarthmore and start their proposed service before graduation.
Verna Cole is in charge of the Lang applications and is available for students who want to
develop a proposal that will meet the required
guidelines. Grant applications are due by March
16, and can be picked up from Cole's office at
Parrish 289.
All community programs under CIVIC are
student-run. Even though Swarthmore has fared
well in numbers of community service involvement in relation to other colleges, CIVIC coordinatorPat James is looking for ways to improve
the means by which Swarthmore students help
the community.
Among these changes is achieving a better

understanding of what the assisted communities really need, instead of imposing what the
leaders believe is best. CIVIC also wants to
develop better strategies for running volunteer
programs. This includes more cooperation with
fellow community service umbrella ChesterSwarthmore College Community Coalition.
CIVIC also hopes for more training and support for student leaders so leaders in different
groups will not be reproducing one another's
mistakes. Training for student volunteers within
the groups is also seen as a goal
James says
CIVIC wants to avoid using communities as
learning laboratories.
James also comments that students sometimes have the confused notion that service and
social change work act in opposing directions,
and fail to understand that they are both necessary and complementary to each other. The
strategy of service is also important. James
states that there is "no academic field in this
college which couldn't contribute something."
She recommends that students help by doing
what they like most. She also sees a problem
with the student body being very committed
to the community in their first two years and
"burning out" after that. In part, says James,
the change is often due to unrealistic goals
some Swarthmore students set for themselves
that wind up being difficult to achieve.

Almost sixteen years ago, police
officer Daniel Faulkner was shot
and killed on a Philadelphia street
corner. This murder aroused justified anger, yet the efforts bring the
killer to justice overshadowed the
protections guaranteed by civil liberties and the search for truth.
Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted
of first-degree murder and sentenced to death;
sixteen years
later he remains
Analysis on death row,
maintaining his
innocence. His voice is amplified
by advocates ofhuman rights, civil
liberties, and racial equality worldwide. From prison, Abu-Jamal has
written for the Yale Law Journal,
appeared on radio programs, and
published a book, Live from Death
Row. Several foreign governments,
including Sweden and Germany,
recognize Mumia Abu-Jamal as a
political prisoner and local groups
call for his immediate release. Why
has he received so much attention
amid the thousands of disputed
capital cases?
A founding member of the Black
Panther Party's Philadelphia chapter, Mumia Abu-Jamal began a
journalism career reporting events
ofinterest to theAfrican-American
community. He was the only
prominent journalist to investigate
the police bombing of MOVE, a
controversial group of Black leaders living with their families in a
Philadelphia rowhouse. Among the
conflicting stories of what happened on December 9, 1981, this
much is undisputed: Mumia AbuJamal, who was carrying a .38-caliber gun, saw his brother being
beaten by a police officer on a street
corner. He got out of his car, attempted to intervene, and was critically wounded by gunfire. Officer
Faulkner died of gunshot wounds
andAbu-Jamal's brother left Philadelphia after hospital treatment.
Although the official report states,
"the negro male made no comments," several months later the
author of the report told the court
he had forgotten to add that Mumia
had confessed to shooting Officer
Faulkner.
The most shocking element of
Mumia's case is the manipulation
ofevidence and mismanagement of
the judicial process. A reexamination of the medical examiner's report showed that the bullet in Officer Faulkner's brain was from a
.44-caliber weapon and that the
police did not do a routine test to
check if Mumia's gun, a .38-caliber, had been recently fired. Two
witnesses saw at least one other
man running away from the scene
of the crime. Detectives met in
prison with the key witness,
Veronica Jones, a 21-year old
mother of three facing a five-year
sentence for prostitution. After that
meeting, she changed her story,
denying that she saw anyone else

NEWS

running away, and officials
granted her probation. At an appeals proceeding with Judge Sabo
last year, Ms. Jones came forward
to testify that she had withheld vital evidence because of police coercion; police officers interrupted
her testimony and demanded to
take her into custody for missing
a New Jersey court date in 1994.
Although the warrant did not actually name Ms. Jones, who was
released from jail that afternoon,
her additional testimony was not
considered by Judge Sabo. Another witness, also facing prostitution charges at the time, recently
served on a FBI grand jury investigating police corruption, where
she confirmed that she had been
threatened by the police if she.did
not cooperate with Mumia's prosecution. Barred from representing himself in court, Mumia was
assigned a public defender wlio
showed legal incompetence during proceedings and failed td interview key witnesses. The prosecution removed almost all of the
black members from the jury
through measures now declared
unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court.
Regardless of Mumia AbuJamal's guilt or innocence, it is
clear that he deserves a new," fair
trial. All of the court proceedings
since 1981 have been conducted
by Judge Sabo, a member of the
Fraternal Order ofPolice who has
sentenced 32 people to death, in
his career, 84% of them black.
Judge Sabo came out of retirement to deny the appeal for a retrial in 1996. Political motivations
for convicting Mumia Abu-Jamal,
such as Philadelphia officials'
campaign to "get tough on crime"
and Mumia's investigative reporting of police misconduct, further
discredit the court proceedings.
The crusade to execute Mumia
Abu-Jamal is currently led by
Philadelphia District Attorney
Lynne Abraham, labeled "The
Deadliest DA" by the New York
Times. Although carrying out the
death penalty usually costs three
times more than a life sentence
and she admits capital punishment
is not a crime deterrent, Abraham
has sought executions in every applicable case. Under Abraham,
Pennsylvania's death row has
grown to the fourth-largest in
America with the highest percentage ofAfrican-Americans. Political insiders attest that Abraham
will run for mayor in 1999, facing a popularity contest in a city
frustrated by violent crime.
Unless Mumia Abu-Jamal is
granted a retrial, he faces execution at the hand of Governor Tom
Ridge, who has signed more death
warrants than ever before in Pennsylvania history. A successful
civil rights attorney, Leonard
Weinglass, took over as Mumia
Abu-Jamal's lead counsel in 1992
and hopes to keep the trial,,and
Mumia, alive.

Runkle '9B visited the scene of the brush fire and found that there-was
no connection between it and the power outage.

On campus, emergency power generators kept auxiliary stairwell lights
and computers running during the outage. Public Safety reported that
all but one of the electric generators on campus, which turn on automatically during a power outage, operated properly. Ironically, the one
generator that failed to turn on serviced the Benjamin West House and
Public Safety.
Jill Bean 'Ol, who was on duty at McCabe library when the blackout
occurred, confirmed that the library's generators turned themselves on
saving students from utter blackness. "We had emergency power," said
Bean, "but that was only in the stairwells and walkways. It got pretty
dark in the stacks." Bean and CirculationLibrarian Libby Amman added
that students in the library moved to the stairwells to continue their reading until the lights came back on.
Ben Criscuolo, receptionist at McCabe, claims that in power failure
situations it is important to "try to find a safe place to stay."

THE BEAR (as told to KATIE MENZER)

Dear Bear,
As I was procrastinating last night, I found myself pondering a very confusing and peculiar
question. My query began when I was watching
;'*â€¢ rerun
of the immensely popular TV show
Seinfeld. It was the celebrated episode dedicated
entirely to a subject they called "master of your
domain". While it was a real hoot, I was somewhat surprised that the NBC censors let Seinfeld
.get away with it. I, then, remembered the inge. pious suggestion made by the much-lamented
former Surgeon General that stated children
. should be taught about their own "domains" to
. -increase awareness of their own sexuality.
.

It seems like this a subject that is discussed with

'disarming frequency in polite company, and while

the open atmosphere of our present day that alto be aired in the public forum
js an interesting issue, I still found myself wontwo things. First, why are there so many
euphemisms for this topic? I mean, the list is endless. Some of the more colorful ones I have
-.â€¢stumbled across are: choking the chicken, spanking the monkey, slapping the one-eyed slack
Snake, etc.

"lows these things

My second question is why are there so few female counterparts for these euphemisms? Is it
. somehow okay for males to discuss this topic with
..their irreverent dialogue, but women are not
awarded the same privilege? Does this demon"

strate yet another conspiracy of The Man to keep
'Women subjugated under the yoke of sexist tyrâ€¢anny? Or does the apparent discrepancy in euâ–  pMiemisms correlate to the frequency at which this
process takes place for each sex? Please shed
Some light on this subject for me, Bear, for I can't
seem to get any of my work done with this question weighing so heavily on my mind.

*

""'Sincerely,
Confused and Lonely
Dear Confused and Lonely,
While it is obvious that you are indeed lonely, I
. think you fail to realize just how confused you
are. You humans cease to amaze me with your
, willingness to indulge in base, immature, and ridiculous topics. There are reasons why some
doors are closed. There are also reasons why some
doors are padlocked, double-chained, and sealed
With duct-tape. And although I feel that this subject would be better discussed on the Jerry
Springer Show, I will nevertheless do the best I
can to lead you to the light. (Also, the fact that
each of your euphemisms involved an animal is
not the best way to start out with me.)
With these things having been said, let me begin. First of all, you think those names are colorful? The list of the ones I've collected while
prowling around the Lodges puts yours to shame.

These include the five knuckle shuffle, tickling
the tender tamale, bashing the bishop, meeting
. five-fingered Mary, taking Chauncy for a walk,
administering the Heimlich maneuver, roughing
~up
i the witness, and one that I'm sure you would
! enjoy, smiting the evil bunny.
..'Now, on to your second question, which even
further demonstrates your confused state. The
' feason that there are so many euphemisms is precisely as I said before. Humans have twisted, perverted, pathetic senses of humor. Why are there
'.qomparably less names for this playtime activity
for women? It appears as though women do not
get the same chuckle out of these idiotic phrases
that men do. Women apparently have a speckle
â– of decency when it comes to such topics, and

-

don't feel the need to create these names in order
to conceal their inherent embarrassment. And fi-

.

..

nally, for your last question about the frequency
"with which this process takes place, I am, if you
' remember, a Bear. How the heck am I supposed
to know? I have sharp, pointy claws. If I engaged
in such activity, at best, I would get a pretty nasty
infection. I can only guess that with the of amount
of time men like you spend on this subject, the
frequency with which women take part has got
to be right up there, if you can pardon the exjffression.
So, Confused and Lonely, I hope I have enlightened you a bit on this topic. Now get back to work.
And I mean your SCHOOL work.
Dear Bear,

I get knocked down, but I get up again. You're
never going to keep me down.

the Landscape

with

Yusef Komunyakaa

by Elizabeth Cho
This past Thursday, when I listened to
Yusef Komunyakaa read in his deep
voice that filled the Scheuer room, my
first thought was that this man has a true
sense of rhythm. As I absorbed the
sounds of his words, I found my foot
drumming along to the beat of his poems. Even afterhe stopped speaking, my
foot continued to tap the carpet
his
of
is
style reading so powerful you internalize his poems when you listen. As
Mr. Komunyakaa read, he leaned over
the microphone and subtly moved his
upper body to the rhythms of his language; it was though he was trying to
bury himself into the poems that were
laid on the podium before him. He
mostly read from his book, Neon Vernacular: New and Selected Poems,
which was honored with both the 1994
Pulitzer Prize and Kingsley Tufts Poetry
Award. His newest book, Thieves of
Paradise, has been published but is not
available for purchase in stores yet.
Earlier that Thursday, I sat down for an
interview with Mr. Komunyakaa. He
was quiet and friendly. Often, his spoken sentences had the quality of poetry
in the strength of their images and
thoughts.

Liz: In "Fog Galleon," a poem about
your hometown, Bogalusa, you wrote
"The whole town smells/Like the
world's oldest anger." What was it like
growing up in Bogalusa?
Yusef: Well, in retrospect I realize that
it is a place where I could
discover the landscape. I
remember my early rituals
as being excursions out
into the vegetation. It was
a learning process for me
because I was very inquisitive about everything
but also I knew that there
was a sort of violence

so...there was always talk
of Klu Klux Klan activities... Usually, we talk
about the violence in urban centers around the
country but I think the most exact and
scary violence for me is really rural violence because of that immense silence.
Liz: Do you feel comfortable with silence? I've noticed there's a lot of music in your poetry and that you edited a
jazz poetry anthology so I'm guessing

music is very important to you.

Yusef: Music is important but I love
silence...we're talking about a different
kind of silence, of course
it's not silence to cover up anything. It's silence
to become part of because I don't think
we can have music without silence.
Liz: How did you become interested
in jazz?

mother's...radio that was like a shrine,
in a way, because it was huge, and I
would ease behind the radio because I
think it had what they call vacuum tubes
in the radio and they glowed like bright
invitations. I remember them being very
hot, as well, because that was my first
experience with fire but I was sort of
mesmerized by the voice coming out of
the box. Usually the radio station was
tuned to New Orleans so that was blues,
jazz, gospel music, coming into...that
early environment. I realize that as far
as jazz [goes], especially modern jazz,
I probably moved away from Louisiana
to experience modern jazz
to experience Charlie Parker, Coltrane. My
early experiences with jazz is considered classical jazz, traditional jazz.
Liz: When you first heard the new jazz
what was your first thought?
Yusef: It was difficult the first few
times, I think, to connect to that new
sound, but because of the music itself...there was also a magnet. So I listened to it over and over and I understood perfectly the link of modern contemporary jazz with traditional jazz
what it came out of.

"Usually, we talk about

Liz: What gives you inspiration?

fact that we observe what's around

us. I think there's a kind of writing that's
happening even when I'm not facing the
fearful white space of the page. It's informed by a certain kind of need and
the need is informed by a certain kind
of music so inspiration can be found. I
wonder sometimes.

and I think that in a way relates to
my writing process, always revising.
Liz: What's your writing process like?
Yusef: I write everything down. Initially, a poem perhaps could be a hundred and twenty lines long [and I will ]
cut back to forty lines. So, I write in that
way and I think that perhaps is related
to jazz improvisation. But if we think
about improvisation, it's not where evit's where everyerything flies apart

SCRAP Group Creates Surreal Dreamscapes
by Jennifer Callaghan
Half an hour before the SCRAP Performance Group
began, the show started in the Art Bank lobby. The
theater-goers stood in compressed little groups or went
fluidly between them, with everyone finding a slightly
different way to balance. The range of hair color was
magnificent, but it was the range of gestures and facial expressions that implied no one was here for anything sedate.
We took a short walk up the obligatory back staircase and found ourselves fairly comfortable in decent
seats. Actually, the Art Bank Theater doesn't really
have 'bad' seating there seemed to be a good view
of the stage from anywhere in the house; the choreographer sat on the stairs two steps above us. A fashionable twenty minutes late, Myra Bazell's
TRAPTURE took the stage and kept it until intermission.
The piece began with a poetic monologue like the
attempted seduction of Dorothy by the Wicked Witch
of the West, and ended with the most erotic use of
monkey bars I've ever seen. Music by Ambient, De
La Guarda, Gorecki, Moby, Musrat Fateh Ali Khan &
Roger White, This Mortal Coil and Underworld made
up a seductive soundtrack which kept a pulsing beat.
This worked well with Bazell's choreography and
complemented the dancers' violent sensuality.
An eleven member cast featuring Melissa Carey, Jennifer Clutterbuck, Alan Gunderson, Sam Henderson,
Emily Hubler, Brenda Kunda, David Konyk, Katie
McNamara, Katya Roelse, Rebecca Sloan & Orlanda
Taylor, performed complicated lifts and frantic running sequences; when the music paused you could
hear them gasping for breath on stage. The dancers'
movements were classically precise but violent and
sexually driven: orgasmic flexing was a common choreographic motif, as well as more sensual, rhythmi-

cally slower, sections but any feeling of gratuitousness was nicely avoided.
Bazell seemed to strive more for thematic than narrative cohesion, but the piece appeared to deal with a
woman's desire and society's veto of that desire, with
repression and guilt and finally a release in an incredibly intense duet between two female dancers. At the
end of the first part of their dance, the two sat together on stage and watched as three other pairs of
dancers, each within a vertical grid, played passionately with the space, convincing the audience they
weren't interested in celibacy.

The piece ended with the
most erotic use of
monkey bars I've ever
seen.
A final acrobatic duetbetween the first pair of dancers, this time within a monkey-bar type cage themselves, endedwith a symbolic death scene for the more
witnessed silently by the rest
passionate partner
of the cast. Constant themes of struggle for escape,
of shame and sexual desire, of violence and of mental anguish were woven into the performance; choreography took risks which were both shocking and gor-

geous, and the dancers embraced these risks with
graceful hunger. No peaceful bit of dancing, this: but
it was very evocative
a surreal habitat for Bazell
and her dancers to push the physical limits of the human body.
The second piece, Numb by Katharine Livingston,
was less impressive. Described as detailing "a society demented by violence and conformity," it perhaps

too often illustrated itself through grotesque comedy.
The eight Numb castmembers, Tony Agostinelli, Renee
Banson, Alex Cordaro, Tom Cunnane, Maggie Moffett,
Janet Pilla, Paul Struck, and Katharine Livingston herself, created highly stylized stage-collages, translating
their unquestionably graceful movements into a utilitarian parody. Beginning with a Hitchcockian film clip
showing a woman running from an unseen pursuer, the
movie portion of the performance ends as she, trapped
finally in a church basement bathroom, turns to the camera and opens her mouth to scream.
The lights then rose, and all but one of the dancers
commenced a mechanical routine, with jerky movements and occasional violent thrashings of each other,
which I'm sure were orchestrated by the choreographer, but appeared heartfelt on the part of the performers. One lone dancer, dressed in a pink contrast to her
companions' black, moved gracefully and timidly
around the stage, threatened and finally captured by
the machinists; eventually released, she remained on
stage for the entirety of the performance, lying motionless downstage as her co-stars twitched triumphantly behind her. Livingston's choreography divided
the piece into a series of skits, most of which utilized
some aspect of black humor, and all of which had a
more automated feel than the Bazell piece. Less symbolic than TRAPTURE, some portions seemed too explicit, even irrelevant; a sequence with an almost-masculine Bugs Bunny outwitting the usual pair ofhillbillies out for rabbit stew seems wholly unconnected to
the rest of the work.
These portions even lacked the physical poetry which
pervades most of Livingston's other work, mostly preventing a sense of continuity and cohesion. Numb ended
with an achingly beautiful interplay between Katherine
Livingston herself and the pink-clad innocent from the
beginning, but retained an impression ofconfusion more
than anything else.

Though it was not especially flavorful, the

pizza runs eight dollars plus tip and includes delivery and two sodas. The pizza
itself, if not familiar enough to all of us

cheese on top of bland sauce and a somewhat sour dough. The crust, chewy, dense

Swat Swimmers
Steal Second at
Centennial
Competition
byJillÃŸelding
The long season for Swarthmore Swimming has
finally ended. Both the mens' and the women's
teams placed second in the Centennial conference
this past weekend.
Swarthmore's men were second to Gettysburg,
setting many college and conference records on the
way. In the 200 Freestyle Relay, Swarthmore's
"bomb squad" consisting ofEric Haeker '99, Ryan
Fruh '99, Ted Sherer 'Ol and Mark Friedberg '9B
took third, the highest place for this elite group in
memorable history. Friedberg continued to shine
during the meet setting college records in the 500
and 1650 Freestyles, placing third and second respectively. Andy Robbins '9B kept the trend of
college records alive breaking the 200 Individual
Medley record and placing third. In the same event,
Sherer placed fifth and Fruh touched the wall sixth.
Adding another college record was Carl Sanders
'9B in the 50 Freestyle, finishing fifth. Robbins,
Fred Gerson, Fruh and Sanders combined to place
second in the 400 Medley Relay while Robbins,
Gerson, Sherer and Sanders finished third in the
200 Medley Relay.
The grueling 400 Individual Medley was a strong
event for Swarthmore with Friedberg, Brent Wasser
00 and Chris Seaman '9B all finishing in the top 8,
third, sixth and eighth respectively. Fruh and
Haeker made Swarthmore's presence known in the
100 Butterfly with fifth and seventh places. Sanders swam a come from behind swim in 200 Freestyle
to place second.
Fred Gersonclaimed a college record for himself
in the 100 Breaststroke taking Swarthmore's first
golid in the meet. Sherer grabbed the bronze while
Ryan Kennedy swam to sixth. Robbins then took
silver in the 100 backstroke.
Robbins, Fruh, Friedberg and Sanders combined
to Win the 800 Freestyle Relay in college record
time. With the streak of victories established,
Robbins brought another to Swarthmore in the 200
backstroke with a national B cut time. In the same
event, Seaman finished eighth rounding out the heat.
Sanders placed fifth in his other sprint event, the
100 freestyle, narrowly missing the college record
in prelims.
The 200 breaststroke proved to be Swarthmore
men's most dominating event. Four men were in
the final heat of eight. Gerson claimed gold in the
event with a Conference record, a school record
and a national B cut time. Sherer finished with the
bronze whileFruh and Kennedy were seventh and
eighth respectively. In final event, the 400 Medley
Relay, for Robbins, Sanders, Friedberg and Fruh
finished third.
The women's meet was much closer than the
men's with the second place team seemingly rotating between Dickinson, Washington and Swarthmore. When all was done though, the Garnet
claimed the silver behind Gettysburg.
Hilary Clay 'Ol, Cathy Polinsky '99, Kristen
Robertson '9B and Erica Rosenthal 'OO began the
meet with a fourth place finish in the 200 Freestyle
Relay. Molly Marino swam an impressive 500
Freestyle finishing third behind record-setting performances. In the 200 Individual Medley, Rosenthal
andAlissa Parmelee racked upfourth and fifth place
finishes respectively.
Swarthmore's 400 Medley Relay, Robertson,
Jenny Harvey '99, Polinsky and Liz Blair 'OO, kept
the top finishes alive with a silver. A trend seemed
to be forming when the 200 Medley team of Marino,
Polinsky, Harvey and Clay maintained
Swarthmore's second place finishes. The same
placing was swum by Rosenthal and Polinsky in
the 400 Individual Medley and 100 Butterfly, respectively. Elisabeth Newcomb 'OO chipped in a
sixth place though in 100 Butterfly as well.
Marino took bronze in the 200 Freestyle while
Blah took sixth. Harvey took fifth in her 100
Brefetstroke. Swarthmore's women created a wall
in the 100 Backstroke with Robertson, Becca
Ho\?es-Mischel and Parmelee finishing 3-4-5.
Not wanting to disappoint, the 800 Freestyle Relay team of Polinsky, Harvey, Rosenthal and Blair
took silver. Mari McCrann took fifth in the 1650
Freestyle, by far her highest placing at the confer-

ence meet.
Swarthmore women changed their course though
in the 200 Backstroke with four women in the final
heat Robertson took the gold in national B cut
time, while Marino scored the silver. HowesMischel added the fourth place position and
Parmelee took sixth.
Blair tooksixth in the 100freestyle, while Harvey
swam for fourth in the 200 Breaststroke. In an
amazing show of strength, Polinsky took third in
the 200 Butterfly, while Rosenthal touched in at
sixth. Finally Robertson, Blair, Clay and Marino
tied for fourth in 400 Freestyle Relay.
While Robbins, Gerson and Robertson all made
national B cuts, whether they will actually be qualified into the meet is still questionable, but for the
time some swimmers are still getting wet.
With Conferences as a measure, the impact ofthis
year's senior class, Sanders, Robbins, Friedberg,
Kennedy, Marino and Robertson, speaks for itself.

Garnet B-Ball Takes
Revenge on the Fords
by Jean Quinn
The women's basketball team finished
their season on a high note, nearly upsetting Gwynedd Mercy and routing
Haverford in the final contest of the season. The Garnet were 8-16 overall, and
with a 3-12 record in the Centennial
Conference, finished in fifth place, between Haverford and Bryn Mawr.
The Garnet came out fired up and ready
for competition against Gwynedd Mercy,
who entered the
game with an 183 record. Swat
played an exceptional first half,
and at the break
held a 3 point
lead. Intensity did
not lessen in the
second half, but
shots did not fall.
The Garnet fell
57-49. "We neutralized a severe lack of
height against Gwynedd by playing consistently tough defense with good pressure on and off the ball. We were having fun out there, and a lot of things were
clicking," commented point-guard
Kristen English 'Ol. English led Swat
with 16 points, and backcourt partner
Heather Marandola 'Ol poured in 14.
The match against the Fords was onesided from the tip-off. Determined to
avenge two earlier losses to their archrival earlier in the season, the Garnet dominated the entire game and crushed them,
58-38. "Each time they attempted to
make a run, we shut them down and
maintained the momentum... On Saturday, all the pistols were firing," said English. Swat held Haverford's best player,

Colleen Leonard, to 0-16 shooting and
two points on the night from the foul line.
Marandola paced the team with a career best 24 points and 9 boards. English added 12. Jean Quinn '99 chipped
in 9 points, 9 boards, and 5 steals, and
Michelle Walsh '9B had 7 points and a
career-high 7 assists in herlast collegiate
game.
"We were determined, and had nothing to lose. It was our last basketball
game of the season, so we put away our
physical and mental fatigue left
over from the
week of classes
and really focused
in at the task at
hand," said Lily
Marsh'ol.
Coach Adrienne
Shibles celebrated
her first victory
over the Fords.
She praised the team, saying, "It was
wonderful to end the season with the victory over Haverford. It was
a great team effort, and it was the kind
of disciplined basketball that I envisioned
lis playing all season. Upperclasswomen
Michelle Walsh and Jean Quinn provided
great leadership, while the younger players really stepped up for the occasion."
Next season the Garnet hope to continue the kind of play they demonstrated
at the end of the season. "Although
Michelle's graduation is a big loss for us,
we are returning a core of players averaging 52 points per game. I am sure that
the confidence gained at the end of our
season will carry itself to next year's
opening contest," said Shibles.
Michelle Walsh finished her career

It was the kind of

As birdie season drew to a close
last week, the Swarthmore
women's badminton team earned
a second place ranking in the conference, narrowly edged out for
first by Albright College. The final Swarthmore-Albright match,
the deciding match of the season,
resulted in a close 2-3 loss for
Swarthmore.
At the Albright match last Thursday, the team was playing their
hardest. Swarthmore's wins were
fast and effective, while all the
matches lost were forced into
overtime as the game scores were
1-1. Playing at first singles, Tarn
Doan '9B played a tough match
against Albright's Jenny Payne,
ranked the #1 singles player in the
Centennial conference.
Doan lost the first game, ll r s,
but rallied back to an upset as she
defeated Payne in the second
game, 6-11 before falling to the
third. Wendy Kemp '99 at second
singles also forced her opponent
into overtime. Kemp won the first
game, but was unable to triumph
over her rejuvenated opponent
again. The lone singles win was
pulled in by third singles player
Noelle Goodin 'OO, who devastated her opponent with astonishing speed: 11-4, 11-0.
At first doubles, Erika Johansen
'99 and Jennifer Chen '99 pre-

sented Swarthmore with another
win. The experienced duo easily
defeated their two opponents, allowing them to score only 6 points
during the entire match. The final
score was an astounding 15-1, 155.
At second doubles, Jane Ng 'Ol
and Siobhan Carty 'Ol were not so
lucky. Ng and Carty bore the
brunt of the change when the
Albright doubles teams suspiciously switched around in the
lineup. They lost the first game,
15-8, before making a turnaround
to capture the second, 6-15. The
third game was lost narrowly, as
the Albright women relentlessly
drove the birdie at the Swatties
again and again. Albright narrowly
defeated Swarthmore to take first
place in the conference, 3-2.
On Sunday, February 22, the annual Northeastern Intercollegiate
Tournament was held at Swarthmore. Tarble gym was transformed
into a huge arena of eight courts,
side-lines, team corners and cheering squads.
Various teams traveled from
places such as the University of
Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, and
Howard University in Washington
D.C. to compete. The competition
was divided into five categories:
mens' singles and doubles,
women's singles and doubles, and
mixed doubles; the scores were
also added up so that an intercol-

legiate team competition could
take place as well.
In the womens' team competition, Swarthmore came in a wellearned third place, just behind
Bryn Mawr and Albright Colleges.
For the combined competition of
both men and women, Swarthmore
came in fifth out of fourteen.
In the first round of singles play,
every single Swarthmore woman
entrant defeated her opponent
Cathy Vaughn 'Ol, Siobhan Carty
'Ol, Noelle Goodin 'OO, Tarn Doan
'9B, Xiang-Lan Zhuo 'Ol and
Wendy Kemp '99 all entered the
second round of play.
However, only Doan and Carty
survived this round to enter the
quarter finals. In the previous
round, Carty defeated her Bryn
Mawr opponent, but then came up
against the second seed, losing
only after a hard and well-fought
match. This is the first time Carty
has ever played singles. Doan, on
the other hand, defeated Bryn
Mawr's number two player to earn
a spot in the semi-finals. In this
fourth round, Doan was ousted by
#1 seed Jenny Payne.
In womens' doubles, the combinations of Doan and Kemp,
Johansen and Chen, and Goodin
and Ani Hsieh '99 all won their
first round of play.
Swarthmore dominated the
semi-finals as both the Johansensee BAD, page 8

such a high note. We have a wonderful
team, and I'll really miss them all next
year," she said.
Several other players on Swat's team
entered the record books this year: English set a single-season school record
with 36 threes. Marandola's 321 points
this season places her in ninth place for
most points in a season, and Quinn's 247
rebounds were good for fourth-best in a
season.

Wrestler Stall Wins
Medal in Regional
Competition
by Kate Vivalo
Swarthmore Wrestlers ended theirseason last weekend with regional competition at Ursinus. Alec Stall
'9B was Swarthmore's lone medalist, finishing in sixth
place. Stall lost his first match 6-3 to Gettysburg. He
then defeated the nationally ranked eighth wrestler
from Ursinus 7-3.
He went on to defeat Messiah's fourth ranked wrestler in a 5-3 thriller. Stall was down 3-1 with fifteen
seconds remaining. He was able to get a reversal scoring two points to tie it and then was awarded two near
fall points for the 5-3 victory. In an exhausting match
Stall then lost to the third ranked wrestler from Kings.
He lost his final match to the numbersix ranked wrestler and Centennial conference champion from Western Maryland College 8-4.
Stall has made quite a comeback after being out the
first half of the season with a back injury. He has
been nominated to be a member of the Academic All
American Wrestling Team, but there has been some
debate concerning the number of matches wrestled.
Pete Balvanz '9B, one of Swarthmore's top wrestlers, started the tournament with a strong win. He
defeated Albright 12-0 in the first round. About twenty
seconds into the second round against Messiah he suffered a 2nd degree MCL tear. Balvanz attempted to
finish his match but was forced to use up his injury
time and then to concede the match. "It is the only
injury that has ever kept me out of wrestling, extremely
disappointing that it had to be my last one, and the
national qualifier at that," commented Balvanz.
Despite the disappointing end to the season, Balvanz
leaves only praise to the team. "I really enjoyed the
season and was honored to have a team of which I
was proud to be a member... I encourage people to go
watch these guys next year."

Basketball Team Triumphs
Men Beat Out Haverford at Home in Final
Game of the Season, 66-49
by Pat Donaghy
You can throw out the records whenever

Swarthmore faces Haverford in a basketball game, as the Garnet Tide proved in
their thrilling 66-49 victory over the visiting Fords last Saturday.
Swarthmore dominated the game from
beginning to end in a total team effort to
finally secure its first win of the season
while continuing its dominance over
archrival Haverford. The Garnet Tidelit up
the scoreboard right from the opening tip
with a barrage of
',
three-pointers.

Swarthmore
jumped out to a 15-

beginning of the second half, helped extend the lead to 42-25. Ben Kennedy
scored back-to-back baskets during the run.
Minutes later, Schofield connected on another of his four threes on the night for
Swat's biggest lead of the night at 45-27.
But Haverford refused to quit. The Fords
went on an 15-8 run, closing the gap to
55-44 with just under six minutes to go.
After a missed Haverford three, Swarthmore turned to its scoring leader, and
Schofield did not disappoint. Schofield
scored the next seven points of the game,
and
sealed
Swarthmore's first
win of the season.
"I was really
happy for the players because they
worked so hard all
season. It was fij nally nice to see everyone happy in the
locker room about the game, and especially
about the way they played" said Coach
Hoffman, who rejoiced in his first coaching victory. What made the victory better
was that "Everybody contributed to the
victory. Different people stepped up at
critical times" said Schofield.
Looking towards next year, "We are really going to miss the seniors. Honestly,
they did such a goodjob all season as leaders. They are the hardest working group
of people I've been around, "said coach
Hoffman, whose been around Swat basketball for many years. "They all had a

"The energy of the
Haverford game was
so high and it really
made a difference."

6 lead on threes by
Cassidy Westbrook
'OO, Tim Schofield
'99 and John
Delatush'9B. With '
Haverford climbing
back, J.J. Purdy '99 matched the challenge
as he connected on one ofhis own to give
the Tide a 20-12 advantage. "Our shooting, especially in the beginning of the
game, was great. Guys really stepped it
up. That was the main difference between
this game and the previous games," commented coach Brad Hoffman '93.
With the score at 27-21 and momentum
swinging towards the Fords, Westbrook
caught fire and scored Swat's next eight
points on two threes and a layup to give
Swat a 35-23 lead going into the locker
room. The seniors, all on the floor at the

big game against Haverford. B.K.
[Kennedy] went five for five from the field,
John [Delatush] had career highs in points
and rebounds, and so many things that
Doug Rouse does are not represented by
statistics. Doug does all the stuff that the
coach really realizes. All three have meant
so much for this team, and I'm glad their
last game worked out great," reflected
Hoffman on the team's senior leadership.
Looking towards next year, "I'm glad that
we snapped the losing streak so we won't
have that hanging over our heads for next
year" commented Schofield. Swat will
return all ofits starters, with many reserves
gaining much needed experience for next
year. "Everyone has a lot of off-season
work to do, even the best guys can improve" said coach Hoffman. There were
individual accomplishments for the players on the team. As a testament to his hard
work, Tim Schofield was named to the second team All-Conference after averaging
16.5 points per game. Joe Culley 'OO, who
did not get his first start until two weeks
ago, led the team in rebounding four of the
last five games as a guard. Westbrook finished among the league leaders in steals
and three pointers.
On a final note, coach Hoffman wanted
to thank the fans. "There was a lot of fan
support throughout the season from everybody. It really helped out the guys. People
kept coming out to the games. The energy
of the Haverford game was so high and it
really made a difference."
