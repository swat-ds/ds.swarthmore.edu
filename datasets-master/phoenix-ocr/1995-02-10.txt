Parrish Fire
Awakens Many,

By David Sobel, Sam SchulhoferWohl, and Jonathan Seitz
A fire in the basement of Parrish

beds at 1:30this morning, but caused
little damage. The fire started in the
old College bookstore, behind the
phonathonroom in Parrishbasement.
The Delaware County Criminal
Investigative Division sent inspectors to check for signs of arson, but at
press time, the cause of the fire was
not known.

The extent of other damage was not

Parrish residents were advised to
find alternative sleeping arrangements. Tired, bored students waited
in Tarble, singing, playing guitar,
doing homework, complaining, and
shivering. "I think I learned my lesson,"Margaret Pierce '95 said."From
now on I'll leave home with my hat

Some students expressed surprise

New Building Named in
Honor of Kohlberg's Gift
By Melissa L. Jacobs

The new 47,000 square-foot academic building at the center of the
north campus will be named Kohlberg
Hall, President Al Bloom announced
this week. The name honors Jerome
Kohlberg, Jr. '46, who contributed
$8 million to the construction project.
Kohlberg, a general partner of the
New York management firm
Kohlberg and Co., has given generously to the college in the past. His
contributions include a $6.2 million
dollar scholarship fund created in
memory of Philip Evans '4B, support
for the 1990 renovation of Beardsley
Hall, and a long-time commitment to
athletics at Swarthmore.

Yesterday, Bloom said that he is
"thrilled" that Mr. Kohlberg agreed
to have the building named after
him. 'The College asked Jerry if we
could name the new academic building in his honor, because ofhis longterm devotion to the College, his
wonderful gift and his deep sense of
caring about Swarthmore students
and their ability to reach their highest potential," said Bloom.
Cost estimates for the north campus projectrun to approximately $25
million dollars.This cost covers the
construction of Kohlberg Hall, the
renovation ofTrotter Hall, efforts to
improve walkways, roads, and landscaping, as well as an endowment to
provide for operating costs.

Construction of Kohlberg Hall is
well underway and the blue-tarped
skeleton of a future academic building is already dominating the land-

scape.
Kohlberg announced his contribution to the project last spring. At the
time, Bloom praised him, describing
how "[in] his 17 years on theBoard
of Managers, JerryKohlberg has been
unstinting in his commitment of energy to this institution. His insight
and experience have consistently
helped the College to act on its deepest values. His recognition of the
crucial significance of this project
for our academic program [is] reflected in this remarkable leadership
gift."

Lee, Dash: Film
Industry Driven by
Money, not Racism
By Jonathan Seitz

After a bit of initial confusion,
last night's panel discussion on the
stateofthe image ofAfrican-Americans in American film developed
into much more than the expected
exploration of filmmaking. AfricanAmericanfilmmakers JulieDash and
Spike Lee were asked about their
views onfilm, television, music, and,
of course, what advice they would
give to aspiring filmmakers.
Judylyn Ryan, a professor of English at Rutgers University, moderated the discussion.
Julie Dash is an independentfilmmaker who produced the award-winning short film Illusions in 1983.
Her 1992 full-length theatrical release, Daughters of the Dust, was
the first ever by an African-American woman.
Spike Lee, a director, writer, producer, and actor, completed the
panel. His credits include Malcolm

X, She's Gotta Have It and Do the
Right Thing, which garnered two
Oscar nominations.
Ryan opened the session with a
lengthy question on the role history
plays in the films ofboth artists.The
question confused the capacity audience, and had the speakers stymied as well.
However, the discussion soon
moved on to the question of the
goals that the filmmakers wish to
achieve. Julie Dash said she aims to
examine "how we [African-Americans] define ourselves." Spike Lee
was more reserved, saying that he
simply wanted "to tell a story."
The two were asked what they
thought about Hollywood's attitude

At last night's discussion of "The Contemporary Image of Blacks In Film," panelists Spike Lee and Julie Dash

Theatre.

toward African-American filmmakers. They agreed that it was content,
rather than the race of a director or
producer, that determines which
films get made. Hollywood's goal,

they said, is to make money. Dash
asserted that the industry's commercial concerns of are behind the trend

offilms about African-Americans that
frequently portray the urban struggle
against gangs and drugs. Films interested mainly in the "titillation" of
viewers, as Lee put it, sell well.
However, "for us, there is a lot
more involved," said Dash. She commentedthatshe could have made more
films after Daughters oftheDust, but
simply chose not to.
Lee and Dash characterized television shows portraying African-Americans in much the same manner as they
had characterized movies. Commercialism, not a desire to subvert the
work offilmmakerslike Lee and Dash,
is the driving force in television, they
said. Even so, Lee characterized most
programs as "miserable." Dash said
she finds the characterizations of African-American women on television
"painful to watch."
Lee was also critical of "gangsta
rap," saying much of it is "decadent."
If, in a song, the artists "kill a couple
of people andrape a couple of women,
[they] go triple platinum," he said.
Audience reaction was mixed. Associate Dean Bob Gross was impressed with the balance that the two
speakers struck between their personal experiences and their views on
the issues. Matt Trebelhorn '96 was
more critical. He was more impressed
with Dash than Lee, commenting that
he thought Lee did not properly address the more important issues. He
found Lee "rhetorically efficient but
intellectually unstimulating."
Both Dash and Lee closed the discussion with advice for students, encouraging exploration before getting
caught up in the "real world." Dash
urged the audience to "experiment."
'Take things to the edge," she said.
"Only by pushing things to the edge
are new things found."

Garnet Patrol To Hit Pavement Monday SubstanceFree Halls
Students Attempt To Improve Campus Security
Might Get
the Axe
By Amy Albert

After two muggings at the beginning of the fall semester, senior
Maggie Gold decided that shehad to
do something about public safety on
campus. She by began thinking of
ways to improve the Safewalk program and create greater awareness of
safety issues on this campus. The
result was the Garnet Patrol.
The Garnet Patrol is a group of 27
students who will soon spend hourlong shifts patrolling campus walkways which are inaccessible to Public Safety vans. Sporting Garnet Patrol uniforms and carrying two-way
radios, the students will be available
to walk with students at night.
To request a safewalk from the
Garnet Patrol, students will call a
new telephone number that will ring
at the Parrish information desk. The
desksitter will then dispatch a Garnet
Patrol worker.
"Because it is so beautiful and serene here, people here have a false
sense of security," said Gold. She
thinks that, in addition to enhancing
campus security, a visible student
safety patrol will remind students to
be concerned about safety on campus
and to stay alert while walking alone.

The GarnetPatrol will work alongside the Safewalk program, whose
services have been expanded in conjunction with the start of the Garnet
Patrol program, The patrollers will
follow routes designated on maps
posted in every dorm. GarnetPatrollers will work outside, while
safewalkers will still wait for students in designated buildings.
Gold also worked with Eric
Ellingson "96, who heads the Safewalk
program, to increase the accessibility of Safewalkers. For example,
safewalkers will no longer be allowed
toread books while on duty. Students
will be able to feel comfortable ask-

ing for a safewalk without "feeling
guilty,"as Gold put it.Safewalkhours
have also been extended to 2:30 in
Beardsley to accommodate the last
students leaving the building.
Garnet Patrol is designed to increase safety on the walkways of campus as well as provide safewalks. The
patrollers, who will begin their patrols on Monday, were trained by
Officer Fred Martino of the Department ofPublic Safety who runs training seminars for neighborhood
watches. In the training, held last
Tuesday and Wednesday nights, patrollers learned to what to look for
when searching for suspicious people,

when to call public safety, and what
do in the meantime.
The Guard will be important as a
visible safety presence. As Gold
states, "in order to commit a crime
there has to be opportunity," and the
knowledge that mere is such a guard
may deter would-be violators.
Gold said that the Garnet Patrol is
important as a student group because
it gives students "a sense of responsibility" about campus safety, and also
provides a familiar face on the dark
walkways of campus. She also sees it
as an opportunity for work-study
students inparticular, as allbut seven
of the Patrollers are on work-study.

At Tuesday's CAX-sponsored open forum, Dan Wells '95 explains why he opposes anti-immigrant measures like
California's Proposition 187. The forum was an attempt by CAX to extend their coalition topeople from the
community surrounding the College. Speakers questionedwhy the group present was much more racially
homogenous than the group which marched in Philadelphia in December. They also were split on whether to
encourage civil disobedience againstPropositi'n 187 and similar measures. Several speakers pointed out that it
is much easier for students to violate these laws than educators and other workers who could lose their jobs.

Political Groups Plan Debates

College Democrats, Conservative Union see need to be more vocal
By Erik Huneke

Political organizations on campus
are gearing up for an active Spring
semester. Both the College Democrats and the Swarthmore Conservative Union (SCU) plan on promoting
political debateamong students.
In the wake of what they perceive
to be increasing conservative influence, both on the national political
stage and on campus, the College
Democrats have decided to become
more politically active than they have
been in the past.
Members of SCU intend to match
their recent record of activism in
smaller projects, since they are no
longer receiving funding from the
Young America's Foundation, a national group designed to foster conservative groups on college campuses.

Force in a general effort to encourage
activism. Although they wish to continue such activities, they also intend
to adopt a more partisan stance with
regard to current political issues.
Matt Schenk '95, a member of the
SCU, looks forward to the College
Democrats' increased activism. He
hopes that it will lead to "some real
debate" so that students may "challenge themselves and open themselves up to what the other side is
saying"instead of simply exchanging slogans and oversimplified versions of positions with which they
disagree.
Justin Herring '97, another SCU
member, feels that it is also important for SCU to remain active, since,
in his view, "people at Swarthmore

students to hear more informed opinions than they might have themselves.
To this end, he hopes to invite a

libertarian from the Cato Institute
and a labor economics professor from
Swarthmore or elsewhere to participate.

Both Lin and Schenk are considering the possibility of hosting other
debates about the Contract with
America. Lin cites the Contract's
positions on welfare reform, education, and the domestic community
service group AmeriCorps as topics
which the College Democrats would
be eager to discuss. Ariane Liazos
'9B, a member of the College Democrats,

believes thatsuch events would

"help not only in the exchange of
diverse political views on campus,
but also in increasing the general

understanding of issues which will
affect all our lives in the future."

The Housing Committee has convened twice in the past two weeks to
discuss improvements inresidential
life and the housing selection process at S warthmore. The committee,
composed of sixteen students and
four faculty members, has requested
student feedback on three issues:
substance free halls, R A roommates,
and block housing.
The committee discussed substance free halls during its January
30 meeting and plans to evaluate
feedback at a meeting this Monday.
Members of the committee recommended that first semester freshmen
not be placed on substance free halls
because, according to a press release, they feel that"first years need
their first semester to get used to
college life and decide on their
lifestyle here based on the college
atmosphere."

Student response was negative.
Jodi Sherman '97 wondered, "What
if someone were a recovering alcoholic? Students are given the option
to live on single sex halls and smokefree halls. Why shouldn't they be
able to choose a substancefree hall?"
Michelle Marafi '97 also feels that
substance free halls should remain
an option; she said that "the availability of alcohol at a college can be
overwhelming and intimidating. The
adjustment to college is big enough
without having to deal with the pressures of alcohol. A substance free
hall would be a haven from that

adjustment."
At the February 6 meeting, the
committee discussed the unofficial
policy of allowing RAs to have a
support person on their hall. Some
members feel that this extra person
can be a good source of support for
RAs and can improve the atmosphere
on the hall, while others argue that
the policy detracts from thephilosophy of the RA system.

Andrew Mong '95, an RA in
Mertz, said, "It's a complicated issue. Even RAs need support, but
there's a real potential for RAs to
pull their best friend onto the hall
just because the friend has a bad
roomdraw number. This isn't fair to
others on the hall and might create

controversy."

The controversial block housing
policy was also discussed at this
week's meeting. Last year's block
housing fiasco is still talked about
with passion; sophomores say they
"got smart" and juniors and seniors
say they were "screwed over" before last spring's block housing arrangements were revoked. The committee recommended that block
housing be reinstated but that the
number of blocks be reduced to 50,
with certain class and gender restrictions in effect. A subcommittee
was formed to look more closing at
block housing issues. Allen Dupree
'96, Jason Adler '96, Susan Rivera
'96, and Matt Sosland '97 were appointed to this subcommittee.
ErikThoen '95 commented, "The
merits of block housing can certainly outweigh the disadvantages,
but the implementation is...important. Careful planning on the part of
the Housing Committee and informing the student body of changes in
policy seem necessary given the
problems encountered last year."
The Housing Committee will discuss all three topics at its meeting
next Monday. The committee welcomes suggestions, which may be
addressed to Director of Residential

Life Myrt Westphal or any member
of the Housing Committee.

Phi Psi, Deep in Debt,
Could Lose House
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

The College will evict Phi Psi from
its lodge at the end of this semester
unless the fraternity pays utility and
maintenance bills totaling $17,000,
according to fraternity officers and
College administrators.
The charge reflects the costs of
heating and upkeep this year, as well
as debt accumulated from past years.
At one point, Phi Psi owed nearly
$25,000, but it raised more than
$7,000 throughphonathons and mailings to alumni. The groupis planning
more phonathons this spring to tackle
the daunting task of obtaining the
remaining funds.
As part of an administration effort
to aid Phi Psi, the Development Office helped the fraternity contact
alumni who were members while at
Swarthmore.
"I was hoping very much that Phi
Psi would be able to resolve its continuing financial problems. The College offeredits assistance, including
askingPhi Psi alumsfor gifts," President AlBloom explained. "However!

as I understand it, the financial situation is very problematic and is presently being reviewed."
"I'mrelatively optimistic about our
chances," said Jude O'Reilley '95,
president of Phi Psi. "We've demonstrated our ability to make...our operating costs. We've shown to the
college that we can rally a significant
level of alumni support."
The fraternity had lost touch with
many of its alumni after separating
from its national parent organization—Phi Kappa Psi—in 1963 because the national group would not
let the Swarthmore chapter admit
black men.
"It's part of the potential for lack
of continuity you get with being an
independent fraternity, that alumni
relations are more difficult,"
O'Reilley explained.
Low membership—Phi Psi has just
fourteen members, and only one
freshman pledged this year—has
compounded the fraternity's financial troubles, but vice-president AndrewPlace '96 said thesituationcould
be worse. "At one point in the '7os

Phi Psi may lose its hat house at the end of this year if it cannotpay off roughly $17,000 in debts to the College.

I don't remember exactly when—there was only one brother in the
house," Place explained.
Phi Psi has considered letting
women join thegroup, but sees going
coed as a last resort because, according to president emeritusBrian Roche
'95, "thatwould mean a fundamental
change in the organization." Roche
added that admitting women to the
fraternity would likely alienatemany
alumni.
O'Reilley saidhe cares more about
the all-male atmosphere at Phi Psi

than about the parties for which outsiders know his fraternity. "I would
hate to think that people only think of
Phi Psi for its parties, because if it
was justparties, I wouldn't be in. To
anon-drinking brother...it's this aspect of having a time to discuss among
men. It's a kind of space. It allows
men to talk freely, sometimes objectionably, but to talk."
Phi Psi plans to continue meeting
even if the College takes its house,
but O'Reilley admitted that losing
the building would be "a significant

blow" to the group.
*The house is a mental centering
point, not just a geographic location.
The alumni would find it really hard
to contend with. They don't come
back to see a roomful of guys—the
house is full of tradition."
Ngina Lythcott, Dean of the College, argued that there is no reason
why Phi Psi can't survive without its
own building. She said, "There are
more than 100 student organizations
that are quite successful without any
assigned space."

SCF "Why Jesus?" Week Ends on Personal Note
By Kathleen Lawton

"Why Jesus?" week concludes this
evening as four Swarthmore students
share theirpersonal testimonies with
indents and others at a gathering in
Bond Hall.
The intimate, discussion-oriented
format of tonight's program is typical of the spirit with which the

Swarthmore Christian Fellowship
organized the entire week. Members
of the campus community were given
daily opportunities to share their reactions to the week at tables in Parrish
Parlors, in Room Five of Sharpies,
and at evening Dorm Discussions.
Theresponses, saidcurrentSCFpresident Marah Fortson '97, have been
largely positive.
"For so long, Christianity has been

something you have to dance around
because [people] don't want to offend us, or ask the wrong questions,

or thereIsn't an appropriate time to
bring it up," she said. "This week,
we've had an open forum for discussion, and there has been a lot of
respect on both ends. People have
been trying to give feedback and exchange ideas."
Tara Robbins '95, who organized
the reaction times, agreed. "People
have been really respectful on the
whole," she said, "and that's a really
great thing to see."
Other activities of the week in-

cluded two speakers, Pastor Arie
Mangrum of the Cornerstone Church
on racialreconciliation from a Christian perspective, and Gary Thomas
ofCareNet (a women's crisis center)
on Jesus Christ's relationship to
women.

Ram Lee '95, who is in charge of
the week, said that both talks were
well-attended, and that Thomas' talk
inspired many questions from non-

Christian members of the audience.
According toLee, questions centered
around the issue of the Christian
Church's historical attitudes towards
women and the way that it differs
from what Jesus said about women.
While some members of the campus community have reacted negatively, said Lee, "People have responded negatively to the ideas, but

not to the project."

The SCF's "Why Jesus?" signs
were 'supplemented' by quotes and
written comments early this week, as
well as signs reading "Why ask
Why?"
Robbins said that the group welcomed reactions in any form, and
said she felt that the writtenresponses
were "a very respectful way of re-

sponding, and a thought-provoking
one," and added that "the reason to
ask why is that it could change your
life."
Reaction tables will continue
through next week, and the SCF will
host a "Seeker Service" on Sunday,
February 19, to provide an opportunity for students seeking spirituality
to discuss the Christian

faith.

"Boy, 5, Takes Gun to P.G."
The above headlineappeared on the frontpage of the
February 4thissue of The Washington Post. The accompanying story reports that the child was "taken into
police custody yesterday after he took a fully loaded
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun to his elementary
school in Prince George's county... [He] was showing
it to two other boys in the back of the classroom about
9:30 a.m. when a teacher walked up and asked them
what they were doing." The gun
belonged to the boys parents. He
apparently took it from its storage
place in the parents' night stand,
thinking it was a toy.
On the same note, the January 28
issue of The New York Times reported that "two 18-year-olds have
been charged with murder in the
shooting death... of a 16-year-old
boy who made a sweeping gesture
with his arms to get a girl's attention
The gunman
apparently mistook the... youth's motion as a challenge
that in street parlance meant, 'take your best shot.'"
Children are carrying guns, and children are being
murdered.
Today's lenient gun laws make assault weapons
available to virtually anyone, including children. In the
name of the arcane "Right toBear Arms," these weapons threaten innocent people everywhere, all the time.
Recent developments indicate that the threat is increasing. On January 27, The New York Times reported

of assault weapons and copycat models.
Freedom to own a gun assumes a degree ofresponsibility on the part of the owner. It assumes that the
person in possession understands the severity of the
situation, perceives his or her surroundings correctly, and can control the weapon. According to these
reports, though, that child had no
control, and that 18-year-oldhad no
perception. They had a gun,that was
all.
When the Bill of Rights was written, the provision was intended for
theformation ofprivate militias during a time of social upheaval, and
for the self-protection ofindividuals

have no war at home, and the stability of our democratic government has proven that there is no danger

Ever take a look at the January

Coalition Against Xenophobia

look closely? Last week, freshfrom a
semester on leave from Swarthmore
and its politics, I did. The inspection
revealed some disturbing thingsabout
the level of dialogue on this.campus.
The showcase, which was assembled in early January and taken
down Monday, was not officially
sanctionedby the decentralizedCAX.
But Alex Volin '96, who assembled

students what last semester's activism has led to. It has led to January's
Showcase, which irked and disappointed me enough to write this.
Since the exhibit is now defunct, I
will begin by describing its three
major components. The first is a series of books, available at the Bookstore, on immigration topics. Interspersed with the books was documentation of xenophobic historical

There is a more important moral
difference. Denying entitlements to
indigents based on citizenship status
may be cruel and maybe bad public
policy. Itis not, however, tantamount
to deliberate government oppression
based on ethnicity. Nevertheless, the
juxtaposition in the display implied
that punishing illegal aliens is morally equivalent to witch-hunting and
impounding citizens. This was quite
misleading. Itwas also a shame, since
such distorted associations only undermine a very worthwhile anti-187
cause.

than Charry's 66.7% estimate.
Disputing results from our simplistic statistical methods, however,
detracts from a larger point. Charry's
article, from the clich6d title to the
overwrought conclusion, is tired. The
canon "debate" has not "lately come

are being accepted into this transforming, growing Canon. Over several decades, the term "Western" may
be discarded as the Canon emerges
and the meanings of "Western" and
"non-Western" become contested.
Indeed, the imminent danger to
"our" history is not the Canon's recentmoment of disfavor. The greater
and more banal threat is our failure,
as students, to do the reading and the
thinking for our classes.

Creative Writing at Swat Should be More Open
By Tara Zahra

I realize that as a first year student,
it is not necessarily in my best interests to pick fights with departments
to which I maybe applying as a major
or minor at this time next year. I
realize that by saying my piece I'm
going to sound an awful lot like a
whining, sore loser. However, it
seems to me that there are a few too
many unnecessarily sore, or at least
mildly aching, losers on this campus
each year because of the issue I'm
about to raise.
I applied for, and was rejected from,
one of the college's two introductory
creative writing workshops at the end

oflast semester. While I'm not about
to question the judgment that was
made on the quality of my writing, I
do find the English department's
policy of selecting students for these
two workshops on the basis of a portfolio to be objectionable on several
levels. First, it is at odds with what I
see as some of the college's core
values, and second, it is counter-productive in terms of developing creative writers and thinkers.
To begin, I'd like to borrow a noiso radical premise from the DeadPoet''s-Society school of thought.

Creative writing can be ofbenefit to
everyone andanyone on this campus.
While I didn't say it nearly as poetically or dramatically as Robin Williams, I believe it's a reasonable statement on which to base my argument.
I'd further assert that the study of
creative writing achieves some of the

discovery first-hand, or at least to
recreate theefforts ofprevious scholars, whether or not that science major

tives and Principles" you'll find these
words: "S warthmore seeks to help its
students realize their fullest intellectual and personal potential."
Let's start with the intellectualpart.
Say student A, an English major, is
enrolled in a creative writing class.
His writing rivals that of the average
second grader in terms of quality,
style, and originality. Does he still

are just a few of the benefits that
come to mind. While most Swarthmore students clearly have a solid
grasp of these skills already, applying them takes them to a somewhat
deeper level when writing is as highly
personal as a short story or poem
written in the late hours of the night.

Administration Tells Almost All
VP Schall responds to student complaints
By Neat Potischman
In an article two weeks ago, I bemoaned the lack of communication
between Swarthmore College's administration and the student body. I
hope that this issue does not die just
yet, because I think the matter has

and asked if I would be willing to
meet with him. I want to share the

results of that meeting with the student body as a whole and provide
answers to the four questions Iposed
in my last article.
In response to the question of a fall
reading week, I was informed that
the College has been attempting to
schedule one for some time now, and
that the issue has been discussed in
internal administration committees.
Although no formal plan to include a
fall reading week has yet been
adopted, students should know that

the matter is under consideration.
In response to the question ofparking availability, I was informed that
the number of spots on campus is
held to a similar number each year,
and that the majority of student spots
were transferred to the new
Fieldhouse "C" lot for this academic
year. Why are Cunningham and the
side of the fieldhouse off limits? As
to the fieldhouse, guests and staffhad
noted a lack of parking in thepast and
so the College attempted to move
students to the "C" lot to make room
for these two groups.
As to the Cunningham lot (which
sits next to Worth and The Lodges),
Mr. Schall informed me that the lot is
in fact underused this year but will
likely befilled by faculty and staff in
coming years whenthe Rose Garden
is closed for renovations.
The College decided that opening
the lot to students for one year only to
close off the option in the following
year would create the appearance of
a decline in the availability of student

prepared in advance.

In response to the issue of the problems with the College's registration
procedure, Mr. Schall said that the
matter was beyond his purview, but
that theissue hasbeen discussed both
by administration members and by
the faculty at large.
Apparently thestudents are not the
only ones who have asked to see
changes in the registration process.
I have now answered the four specific questions which I raised in my
last article. Considering that it took
me about one hour to meet with Mr.
Schall and a few additional hours to
write this article, I calculate that it
took me fewer than five hours to
answer four questions which I have
heard discussed at Swarthmore al-

With more students wanting to take
writing classes then can possibly be
accommodated, the English department clearly faces a problem. There
may be ways of dealing with this
problem withoutshafting exceptional
writers or beginners. To state the
obvious, why not lottery spots randomly, or at least by seniority, as all
other departments do? Perhaps a half
credit writing attachment could be
offered in conjunction with regular
poetry and prose classes. Another
option might be to make the workshops a little larger, with more emphasis on small group work. Especially experienced or talented writers
could simultaneously compete for
spots in the advanced workshops.
After all, there are times when we are
all judged, selected, or rejected on
thebasis of our work. At times, we all
have to compete with our peers to
reach our goals. Is it really necessary
to make registration for a creative
writing class another one of those

competitive occasions?
In light of the spirit of the college,
and because I believe strongly that
.the arts should not simply be the
domain of the chosen, I'd have to
answer that question with an emphatic "No."

"Violence Alumnus Opens Local Karate Dojo

Throughout history, people have fought each
other. This has inevitably led to the development of the word "war." But the development
of war has had an impact on far more than just
linguistics. For example, its impact can be seen
in fields as diverse as literature, painting, millions of deaths, and sculpture.
Most people who still have both halves of the
brain argue that war is wrong. Yet, in spite of
this, war keeps showing its figuratively personified ugly head, so to speak.
Why does this occur? Is it an evolutionary
trait that was developed in cavemen? Why does
nobody ever use the word "caveperson"? Were
there any cavewomen? If not, how did the men
reproduce? Did they reproduce by fission?
These are all valid questions, in the sense that
each contains a question mark and a verb.
Many people argue that violence exists simply because it prevails over all else except more
violence. Violence is effective.
This is best illustrated by looking at an
Egyptian pyramid and forcing an analogy.
Suppose each brick in thepyramidrepresented a
way to resolve an argument. The higher
the brick, the more effective
the method of resolving the
argument. The top brick represents violence. This leads to
he obvious question: "How

did the Egyptians build the pyramids?" This is
a valid question ("?", "build"). The answer is:
with bricks.
But bricks are not the only weapons.
Throughout history, sticks, stones, and even
names have resulted in the breaking of bones
and, surprisingly, the hurting of people. There
may be alternatives to violence. There is a
famous saying that says that the pen is mightier
than the sword. The saying goes like this: "The
pen is mightier than the sword". There is another famous saying, "might makes right.", which
says that might makes right. Combining these,
we see that there is an implicit famous saying
that says: "The pen makes more right than the
sword."
Seeing how this saying is not even
grammatically correct, it is difficult to understand how it ever became famous. Nonetheless,
it is worth noting.
Websters defines violence as "A violent act
or proceeding." I hate dictionaries. RandomHouse also makes dictionaries. Now there's an
interesting company: Random House. Quite the
image, isn't it? I want to live there when I grow
up. People will ask me where I live. I'll say
"Wherever."
If one stays focused, however, one comes
back to the issue of violence. Its presence continues tenaciously and perniciously. Adverbs
alone cannot fully describe just how much its
presence continues. Its presence continues a lot.
Why? This is not a valid question*, so we need
not answer it.
There are specific steps we can take to make
the world a less violent place. On the local
scale, we can build more boxing gyms and
hockey rinks, showing kids that fighting doesn't have to bereal to be fun.
On the global scale, we can develop the technology to send people to other planets, reducing
the overall amount of violence on earth.
Philosophers have argued for centuries about
violence, though not the same philosophers.
Nobody lives for two centuries. The point isthat
the issue of war is one that is not easily understood. This is why so many people appear to
ramble on about it without really saying anything.

Why not?

by Dave Sobel
At 5'9" and 143 pounds, Justin Giacoletti
doesn't seem to be the toughest customer
around. But that hasn't bothered Justin for the
twelve years he has been a student of Uechi
Ryu karate. After teaching karate at
Swarthmore during his stay as a student,
Justin Giacoletti '94 has now opened his own
karate dojo in Swarthmore.
Giacoletti rents space from Stretch and
Tone with Roz, a local health center. He
teaches two classes a week, Monday and
Wednesday at 8:00pm. Students in these
classes are of all different levels of experience, from a novice white belt to an intermediate green belt. Giacoletti himself holds a
second degree nidan black belt in Uechi Ryu,
a rank he has held five years.
"I want [my students] to learn a martial art,
not a fighting sport," said Giacoletti. "[Uechi
Ryu] builds confidence, self-awareness, and a
sense of balance, and not so much a competitive nature like some other styles."
Giacoletti is also quick to point out that he
"has a very particular teaching style. It is
attractive to a certain kind of student. If you
make a mistake, I will be quick to point it out.
When I deal with my students, I am blunt." He
sees that bluntness as part of the sense of confidence and balance that Uechi Ryu brings.
"Karate has been something I've done for
more than half my life. It is part of me."
But this hasn't always been so for Justin.
"The way dad tells this story is that when I
was ten, I would come over and do nothing all
day but read. Dad thought that little boys
should do more active things, and he wanted
to do something youthful, so he decided that
starting karate lessons would be a wonderful
father-son activity."
Justin studied with his father, who also
holds a nidan in Uechi Ryu, in Largo, near
their St. Petersburg, Florida home. Both been

studying under master Ric Martin, who holds
a sixth degree black belt in the style.
While at Swarthmore, Giacoletti, a physics
major, taught a karate class through the PhysEd department. "I worked out an arrangement

Swarthmore because I was determined to
continue my training. I got a group of interested students together and we started working
out. I then went to the PE department and was
hired as a student worker to teach a class. That
class continued from semester to semester."
Giacoletti taught for three years while at
Swarthmore
for all of his junior and senior
year, as well as one semester in each of his
first two years.
Giacoletti opened the dojo because, he says,
"I wanted to put karate on more of a sound
footing now that I have made a commitment to
living in the area." Giacoletti's fiancee, Kathy
Davis '94, works in a law office in

As far as karate goes, "I want to continue

Spacey's performance is
often bitter without being

The Ref s saving grace is Judy Davis, who
manages as always to be hilariously distraught

the film worth seeing. The melodramatic resolutions are unsatisfying, and a subplot

dates from 1987—and "dates" is the word. I
know I'm going to take a lot of flak from
Mary Stuart Masterson fans, but isn't her
character just a crossed-dressed version of Jon
Cryer in Pretty in Pink? For the uninitiated,
Masterson plays Watts, a drum-playing
tomboy punkette in love with her best friend
Keith (Eric Stoltz). But Keith has eyes only
for Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), the
most popular and prettiest girl in school
(remember, this is 1987, so "prettiest" means
rat's nest hair and much, much makeup).
People at school keep mistaking Watts for a
lesbian (having seen Fried Green Tomatoes),
but she knows she'll get him someday. In the
meantime, there's always her drums.
While there's no denying that Stoltz and
Masterson are both button-cute, Wonderful is
mosdy a tedious rehash, from Keith's troubles
fitting in at school (read: wrong side of the
tracks) to his bratty, precocious younger sister
(aka sitcom girl). Still, those in the mood for a
movie to make fun of need look no further.
Particularly funny is the filmmakers's conception of "punk" circa 1987, which involves the
Go Go's and red leather gloves with no fingers and an eight-inch fringe. And how exactly does Keith get such good grades with only
one textbook?

Barnes Collection Makes Historical

If ever something called you to venture forth
from the quaint borough of Swarthmore and
into the big city of
Philadelphia, that

Picasso (wait there's more), Braque, Gauguin,

Toulouse-Lautrec... are the artists whose works
are displayed in this stunning exhibition of
GreatFrench Paintings From theBarnes Foundation.
This is the first and only time in history that
these paintings have been shown outside of The
Barnes Foundation in nearby Merion, PA. None
of the works of art in the foundation have ever
even been reproduced in color. In fact, it required a court dispute to bypass, for one time
only, the written stipulation of Dr. Barnes that
none of his art leave the

Foundation.
The P.M.A. is the final stop on its world tour.
Record crowds of 1.5 million visitors in fourteen weeks came out in Paris to see the masterpieces of Dr. Barnes' collection. It was the
largest turnout for an exhibition in history! In
Tokyo 1.1 million visitors came out in ten
weeks.

Standing before the entrance of the exhibition, be sure to pause and look down the long
corridor of the first gallery. Your gaze will fall
upon Cezanne's 'Nudes in a Landscape.' Now
turn yourself 180° and if you peer down the
hallw ay of theP.M.A.' s collection oflate-19thCentury art you will find 'The Large Bathers.'
(It's a neat trick— I did it a few times.) These
are two of three monumental compositions completed by Cezanne at the end of his life. The
third is in the National Gallery in London.
Anyone who has visited theBarnes Foundation will notice the marked contrast from their
cramped, unconventional arrangement in their
Merion home. Matisse once praised the Merion
arrangement as being of "a spirit beneficial for
the formation of American artists." In contrast,
the exhibition's eighty-three paintings and
twenty statues are spread out through seven

galleries. As presented by the museum, each
painting hangs, carefully lit, and distinctly
spaced from its neighbors. You have a rare

In conjunction with the collection of
Foundation's Twentieth Century French
paintings, the exhibitionis augmented by the
inclusionofnineteenAfrican sculptures from
among the works collected by Dr. Barnes.
Barnes was keenly interested in the great
influence ofAfrican sculpture on many avant
garde artists, including Picasso, Braque, and
Modigliani. The exhibition invites its visitors to make their own juxtapositions. The

Ivory Coast.
It is indeed ironic that the works of art of
the Foundation are now hanging on the walls
of the P.M.A, which Barnes despised and
once called, "a house of intellectual and
artistic prostitution."
Barnes, a notorious curmudgeon, made
his fortune developing Agrygol, an antiseptic, and went on to amass an impressive art
collection. By the time of his death in 1951,
he had assembled a collection of over 2500
objects including 180 works by Renoir, 69 by
Cezanne, and 60 by Matisse. Over the years
he developed elaborate theories about how
people should view art. He believed that all
people could appreciate art, from the novice

connoisseur.
He established the Foundation both "to
promote the advancement of education and
appreciation of the fine arts," as well as to
keep his collection from the hands of the elite
of the art world. The Foundation's trustees
are nominatedby Lincoln University' s Board
of Trustees. Lincoln University is a historically African-American university in Chester
County. The exhibition, according to Richard H. Glanton, president of the BarnesFoundation, was undertaken in order "to secure
the funds required to preserve Dr. Barnes'
magnificent collection for future generato the

Folksy God Street Wine Lacks Originality

By Dominic Sagolla
Instead of spending my Saturday night roaming around the ice-cold wasteland that is Swat, I scored a
last-minute ticket to the God Street Wine show at the TLA in Philly last weekend. I had heard them
before, but hadn't really listened. I figured ten bucks gets me two hours of good live music— a bargain

these days.

And they are an entertaining bunch. The band is your typical combination of electric instruments, with two lead
guitarists, a keyboard, and a six-string bass. In my opinion, if you're going to have six strings on a bass, you should
USE them. All of them sang, although some of them shouldn't have. The result of this clichecl collection is a very
familiar sound, almost entirely unoriginal. The best way to describe them would be as a clean, Phish-era, countryjazz fusion band with a twist of Allman. I don't want to give them too much credit though.
As I observed the completely and comfortably white crowd popping ry thmically left and right, I contemplated the
inane lyrics of God Street Wine. I found them to be utterly themeless ("Sometimes I wonder why it comes crashing
down") and mindless ("So come on in, show your friends, put down your money, and be like us"). Although most
of the members of GSW are highly technically skilled, they lack the soulful drive that has catapulted bands like
Widespread Panic and Dave Matthews Band over their heads.
The highlight of the show was the first song of the encore: a cute version of the timeless, can't-go-wrong "Love
Me Tender." Their huge set included many clever segues and GSW in-jokes, but this gumshoe, frat-party rock has
a long way to go before I would consider seeing them in concert again.

Grant Lee Buffalo Opens R.E.M Concerts
By Dan Sachar
I often have often heard the question, "It seems as if nothing good has been released recently, isn't there
any valuable new music out there?" To answer this, I would point directly to the "G" section of the store
and tell you to buy the two albums by Grant Lee Buffalo, perhaps the best new group of the mid-19905.
Recently, this trio out of L.A. has been stirring up the music scene with its honest, folk/grunge rock and its
lead singer's sumptuous, soaring vocals. They are now opening for R.E.M. on the Australia/New Zealar
segment of their tour.
You'll probably wantto start with GrantLee Buffalo's second album, "Mighty Joe Moon" (Slash), which is ci ck
full of terrific songs and beautiful melodies, particularly, "Honey, Don't Think," "Mockingbirds," and the title song,
all of which were written by the singer/guitarist Grant Lee Phillips. But you can't afford to miss the group's debut
effort, "Fuzzy," (Slash) which has some of the most gorgeous and haunting tunes I've ever heard, particularly 'The
Hook."The songs on both albums veer between acoustic folk, and grunge-like feedback, with the group's members
switching effortlessly from guitar, bass, and drums to dobros, mandolins, and tumbuks. The end results are two
exquisite records. Also, if you can ever catch the group live, it's well worth the price of admission.
If you have yet to hear Grant Lee Buffalo, believe me, you're missing something wonderous.

When I first heard that Michael Crichton's book, Disclosure, was being
adapted for the silver screen and that it was going to star Michael Douglas,
I thought, "Great. Another installment in the trilogy that began with Fatal
Attraction andBasic Instinct ." I had no desire to watch Douglas, who really
is a skank, play another role as the end-all, be-all of sexy men. Especially in
a film that addressed the issue of sexual harassment, albeit a woman
harassing a man.
The story is thatDouglas gets passed over for a promotion at his computer
company in favor of his old flame, a beautiful, sexually aggressive woman
played by Demi Moore. The first thing she does in her new position is invite
Douglas up for some wine and a chance to go over the files on their current
project, a virtualreality databasecalled The Corridor. He arrives at her office
for the fateful harassment sequence. To say the least, it's debatable whether
or not it's sexual harassment It's more like watching a married man weaken
in the face of a beautiful woman and begin to forget his vows. Granted he
does keep saying, "No" (notice there's no exclamation point there) as she
performs fellatio on him and while he rips her blouse open. Duh... He
eventually comes to his senses and leaves her, while she yells after him, 'To
finish what he started" and "You're dead."Okay, okay, so that is definitely
sexual harassment The next day hefinds out thatshe filed forcharges against
him for harassment, so he goes out and finds a sensationalist lawyer to help
him press charges. He eventually wins, and then has to save his job again
when he's being set up as a scapegoat fro problems with the Malaysian
production plant where the database chips are coming from. Yup, it's a
convoluted Crichton plot.
It's a shame that one of the first movies to deal with the harassment issue
does itfrom a lopsided viewpoint andbotches it so badly. Ifthis were all there
were to the film, it would have been a disaster. The movie does come alive
when it deals with the technological sneakery of the virtual reality CD-ROM
as Douglas tries to find a way to clearhis name. In addition, the special effects
in The Corridor are spectacular. The movie finishes with a typical Crichton
race-against-time-on-the-edge-of your-seat feeling. No one in the cast really stands out, except maybe for the actress playing Douglas' lawyer.

2-0 in two conference matches
this week. Tuesday night the women
dominated a second half to bring
themselves a 70-50 victory over Bryn
Mawr. The first half brought Swat
some trouble as many turnovers led
to only a 30-24 lead at half. However, the women came out with strong
defense in the second half and
outscored Bryn Mawr 40-26.
Michelle Walsh '9B led the team in

Saturday night, though, when
Swarthmore traveled to Haverford.
S wat had previously beaten the Black

the Seven Sisters' Tournament and
again at home. So, these women
knew Haverford would be up, and
Swarthmore just had to be more
psyched. The game went back and
forth throughout the first half leaving Swat trailing by 2 at the half.
A confident Swarthmore team

A Sexual and Emotional Manipulation...

Eighty Feet of Vertical Water Ice in New Hampshire
By Kylian Robinson

Climbing near the Kane (RT 112,
New Hampshire)
"to practice the precise and sublime art of mountain climbing..."
We arrive late in the afternoon,
having three hours previously abandoned another climb due to the perceived improbability of successfully
completing a river crossing in darkness on descent. Even from a distance, the view is extraordinary,
where an eighty foot cascade of water stands unmoving, pearl white and
textured lightly. To touch it we must
walk, lightly, across an expanse of
ice which cracks lightly with each
step. I wander through the ice in one
place, catch myself, watching water

Swat Swims Past Washington to Clinch Second Place
By Matt Cohen
Wednesdaynight was time to show off down
at Ware pool. Conference arch-rival Washington College rolled into town for the final dual
meet of the season and fled from the roar of
elated Swat swimmers cheering endlessly for
every great swim of the day. It was a day of
inspirational swimming, loud cheering, emotional victories and flaming red hair.
The win was particularly sweet for
Swarthmore's men. The victory came after a
tough loss to Hamilton College over the weekend, and a season devoid of much-deserved

"Psyching up" procedures
prior to the meet included
roses, flying Garnet hair
and a pep-talk from a
renowned swimming

psychologist.
respect. Though the Washington College coach
had refused to acknowledge threat Quicker
Quaker men's threat to Washington's second
place bid in the Conference, she was, quite
literally, left quaking in her boots by the

Swarthmore men's performance. The women
also posed a convincing challenge to second
place at the Conference meet. The two wins
propelled the men's team to 5-1 in the Centennial Conference and 9-4 overall. The women

moved to 6-1 in the Conference and 11-3 overall. The meet was touted by Coach Sue Davis as
the most interesting meet of the year in the
Centennial Conference. Her words proved to be
true.

From thebeginning, Swarthmorelookedlike
a team ready to fly. In a brief ceremony preceding the meetto honor the Seniors, Matt Cohen,

Greg Hamilton, Rob Howell, Ben Lyons,
Karsten Scherer-Nadal, Tricia Duncan, Christina Richards and Khris Schaffner accepted

roses and thanks from the coaches with Garnet

hair a-flying. The ceremony was just one factor
in thepsyching up prior to the meet. The evening
before, renowned swimming psychologist Alan
Goldberg came to talk to the team about focus
and mental preparation. His inspirational attitude and insightful tips for swimming mentally
were displayed at the meet.
From thefirstcheer through arockin' "Who's
Yer Daddy," the Swat swimmers looked ready
to rock. The fans did not leave disappointed.
The women'smedley relay was incredibly close.
It was with some dismay that Swat watched the
Washington Sho'women touched out Kris
Robertson '9B. Kris swam an incredible meet
racking up threepersonal bests. Her 100 yd free
time was a drop of a second and a half. In the
women's medley, Christina Richardson '95,
had a lifetime best in the 100 yd backstroke.
She swam a tough race in the 200yd back later
in the meet, achieving another lifetime best.
The men's medley relay was just as exciting,
including the bonus of a Swat victory. It was
less than a second off the college record, and
Andy Robbins '9B, Kendrew Witt '96, Justin
Herring '97 and Carl Sanders '9B looked incredibly strong. The 1000 yd happened as
planned for the women with Molly Marino'9B
cruising to an easy victory and Sarah
Wemeck'96 placing second. In the men's race
Mark Friedberg'9B won easily. The 200 yd
freestyle was another great race for Swat. Alice
Unger'9B, returning from several sick days,
won in a race that has truly become her signature. The men's race was thrilling as Sanders
reeled in the Sho'men swimmer with a 50 to go

Rachel Kidman '9B swam this extremelytough
race in fine form. The men's race was time for
Jaime Raich '97 to show off his short-axis
swimming and his revised value system in the
water. His swim displayed "the way to swim
fly" according to Davis. According to the rest
of us, it was an incredible swim, as he tracked
down and left the Washington swimmer behind, finishing in an astounding 2:13. That race
was Swat's turn to reply to the 50 1-2-3 with a
1-2-3 of their own. Herring, Jason Devlin '9B
and Raich quieted the vast collectionof Washington parents that came to the meet.
In the 100, Unger once again pulled out a
convincing win. In the men's race Sanders won
once again for the men, showing offhis wicked
kick on a come from behind victory in the last
50. The 200 yd back saw Marino once again fly,
followed closely by Duncan and Hanan Hussein
'97. Hamilton and Ross Dickson '97 dropped
considerable time to set inemselves up to crush
their lifetime bests in a week. Hamilton, despite
his mellowness, was even heard to whoop a
little with his time of 2:07. Dickson got within
a second of his best ever, and promised to make

finals or win consoles at the Conference meet.
The 500 yd saw season best swims from
Cohen and Lartigue, despite the Sho 'men swimmers toying with thema little. Friedberg, swimming sore, was touched out by the Washington
swimmer but has sworn revenge for a week
from now.
The 200 yd breast was a show to watch. Skye
Fulkerson '96 and Kendrew Witt, last year's
national qualifiers, dropped considerable time.
Skye was only a second off her best ever, and
Kendrew's swim helped clinched the meet.
Kim Killeen '97, in her first competitive swim
season, was a conference qualifier with her
showing in the 200 yd breast, and came dramatically close to breaking the minute barrier
in the 100 yd free.
So it was with great performances that the
men and women ended the dual meet season.
All competitive energy will now be focused on
next week's Conference meet. It will be a three
day saga at Ware pool, which will act as the
center for a baldness study. Come check it out.

and pulled away.

The 50 yd, a traditionally difficult event for
both teams was the one glimmer of hope for the

Washington swimmers as they took 1-2-3. In
the 200 yd IM, Marino showed once again why
opponents had better have a lead on her going
into the free leg, because she took the last 50
straight to the wall and won. By this point the
women, through fine swimming, had returned
themselves to the agenda of points laid out by
Davis to win the meet.

Swat Overwhelms Haverford and Struggles Past
Hopkins to Move Closer to Eastern Division Title
By David Lischer
Extending their current winning streak to
five games with victories over Haverford and
Johns Hopkins this week, the Swarthmore
men's basketball team (12-9, 8-2) has thensights on the East Division title and their first

winning season since 1990-91.
The Swarthmore Garnet started the week
strong with dominating victory over the Red
Wave of Haverford 73-61. The game was
packed with fans from both schools and followed a thrilling overtime victory by the Garnet women. Emotions were high the entire

game but despite the ruckus in the stands, it was
all-business on the court.
The lead seesawed for the first ten minutes
until the Garnet made a run from which
Haverford never recovered. Leading 18-17 after Colin Convey *97 fed fellow guard Craig
Rodner '96 for a lay-up, center Sam Voolich
'96 (14 points) showed his outside touch by
draining a three-pointer. After a Haverford
turnover, Rodner was fouled on the transition
and sunk both free throws. Then Mark Pletcher
'96 and Jim Foley '95 each hit on shots to give
the Garnet a 27-17 lead.
Unlike in the Muhlenberg game, the Garnet
bench made important contributions. Pletcher,
Foley, and Chad Tarr '95 each scored four
points and contributed an assist. The Red Wave
shooting improved near the end of the first half
and helped them narrow the Garnet lead to 3629 at halftime.
The Red Wave carved into the Garnet lead
after a couple early Garnetturnovers.But "Deja"
Voolich soon turned the tide, sinking lay-ups
on two consecutive inbound plays under the
Haverford basket and then draining a threepointer. This started a thirteen point Garnetrun
from which the Red Wave were never to recover. Kirk Daulerio '95 (20 points) hit two
consecutive three-pointers and Rodner sunk
two free throws to complete the run and give
the Garnet an insurmountable 53-34 lead with
just under ten minutes remaining.
While the GarnetcouldnotkeepHaverford's
star guards Chris Guiton (22 pts.) and Jamal
Elliot (15 pts.) off the scoreboard, they did
force them into a number of poor shots. Elliot
"airballed" two shots in the first halfand missed
a number of others, finishing 7-19 from the
field. Guitonniton only five ofhis 15 shots but
sunk 9-10 free throws. GabeO'Malley was the
only other Ford to have a solid night scoring 13

points and grabbing 11 rebounds.
Where the Red Wave lacked depth, the
Garnet have nine players who have seen action in nearly every game. In addition to the
bench support from Pletcher, Foley, and Tarr,
guards Convey and Rodner had their usual
steady contribution of eight and ten points.
Ben Schall '97 grabbed a team-high ten rebounds in addition to his nine points.
Yet on Wednesday, the usually steady Garnet nearly handed Johns Hopkins their fourth
win of the season. Both teams shot miserably
from the field, 32% for the Garnet and 36%
for the Bluejays. The Garnet prevailed despite only five points fromDaulerio.
Schall scored 14 and grabbed ninerebounds
to lead the Garnet to a 52-44victory. Voolich
and Convey also had solid games, contributing 11 and nine points respectively. The of-

fense

was not pretty and would not have
beaten many other conference teams but the

Bluejays could not take advantage of the
Garnet's subpar performance.
One positive note was the defense. For the
second consecutive game, the Garnet held an
opponent to under 40% field goal shooting. "I
thought we played tremendously well defensively. We did some things I wanted to do.We
held them to single digit offensive rebounds.
In the last couple games, we had had some
lapses inblocking out," saidCoach Wimberly.
The Garnet need a win at Ursinus on Saturday to clinch at least a co-championship.
With wins in two of their last three games,
they will clinch the undisputed conference
title. Ironically, in their remaining three games,
the Garnet face in order the first three victims
in their current winning streak: Ursinus, Washington, and Muhlenberg. Saturday night is
senior night as Swarthmore takes on Ursinus
in the last regular-season home game.

Breakthrough Season for Men
By David Lischer

Swarthmore's men's basketballprogram has
made an incredible turn-around in Coach Lee
Wimberly's nine year tenure. In 1986, there
was no "program" remotely comparable to
what exists today. There was no recruiting.
There was no winning. There were no illusions.
It took Wimberly merely five seasons to put
together a playoff team. After four losing seasons, the Garnet emerged as the MAC Southeast champions in 1990-91. As seniors,
Wimberly's first recruiting class had made it to
the playoffs. This is an amazing feat since
Wimberly's previous experience had been in
California. He had few East Coast connections
and literally had to build the program from the
bottom up, a job made even more complicated
by Swarthmore's tough admissions standards.
Yet Wimberly has devoted himself to building a competitive program without compromising Swarthmore's academic values. A quick
scan of the roster shows a diversity of aca-

demic interests with majors ranging from engineering to psychobiology. In addition, two
of this year's five freshman were class valedictorians another won the scholar-athleteaward.
Perhaps his roots on the West Coast were a
benefit. Wimberly recruits nationwide. If you
have the academic credentials, theinterest in a
small-school environment, and Wimberly can
find you, you'll get a letter from Swarthmore.
The 1994-95 Garnet have representatives from
12 states, including Texas, California, Minnesota, and Oregon.
;

Today, Wimberly hands over much of his
recruiting to his two assistant coaches, Ed
Behrman (in his eighth year), and Brad
Hofmann (second year). Hofmann, a 1993
Swarthmore graduate, was a sophomore guard
on the 1990-91 playoff team and a three-sport
athlete for the Garnet.
"They do a fabulous job with the recruiting
and allow me to do most of the scouting.
[Scouting] is an area thatI pretty much reserve
for myself. Not because I don't have confidence in my assistants but because I [just

always have]," said Wimberly.
Wimberly takes every available chance to

conference opponents and has a library
of videotapes to consult in the preparation of
the scouting report. He prepares a 6-8 page
report for each game detailing the opponents
strengths and weaknesses and the Garnet's
scout

game plan.
"It definitely is a big help, we know all their
players inside and out, what they can do, and
how to play them. There are no surprises," said
Kirk Daulerio '95.
Yet no team since has been able toreach the
same level of success of the 1990-91 team.
This season the Garnet (12-9) have a realistic
shot at only their fifth winning season since
1951 and their first appearance in a Centennial
Conference postseason.
The season is even more remarkable since
Swarthmore was picked to finish second to
last in the conference by the coaches in the
preseason poll. Last year's team finished dead
last in every defensive category while this year
they are in the top two in every category.

Cochran-Bond scored 19 points and
pulled down 7 rebounds in the Garnet's
rout of Bryn Mawr and then exploded
for 34 points and 10 rebounds as Swat
defeated Haverford for the third time
this season. Yet it was the way CochranBond scored her last five points against
Haverford in OT that earned her a rare
repeat as Athlete of the Week. With two
seconds on the clock and Swat down by
two, Lisl drained a three pointer from
well behind the three point line to win
the game. She then hit two free throws

after a Haverford technical foul to complete her night. One fan commented that
her shot "was the most exciting play I
have seen in college basketball all year."
