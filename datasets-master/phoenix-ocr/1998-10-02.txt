College leaves

After repeated disputes
over anti-police chalkings on
campus, Joshua Kramer 'OO
and the College administration
continue to disagree on the
administration's role of censorship at the College.
Kramer's chalkings, written on the night of the 25th in
front of Parrish, contained
both anti-police remarks and
statements emphasizing the
importance of free speech.
"Swarthmore College and the
Police are stifling my right to
free expression," one chalking

This weekend, Swarth-

more will face an influx of ap-

proximately 200 visiting students engaged in intense com-

stated.

Another message, which

repeated one that had been
previously erased by the Col-

lege, listed insults to police.
Yet another chalking encouraged students to fight censorship, declaring "All speech is
good. Don't let them erase you
too."
Kramer's
Although
chalkings did contain some of
the anti-police content of previously erased chalkings, his
statements were not erased by
the College.
Dean Tedd Goundie said
Kramer's chalkings were not
erased because "The context in
which Josh presented his
views were different that the
previous chalkings." Goundie
also noted that Kramer signed
his name and phone number
on the chalkings, and was willing to defend his views. The
authors of the previous
chalkings had not signed their
names, Goundie continued,
characterizing the author(s) as
"someone anonymous resorting to name-calling."
Kramer, however, objected to the College leaving
his chalkings on the pavement.
He stated that he would rather
have had his chalkings erased,
because that would have
"demonstrated that the Administration had a consistent censorship policy." He continued
that by not erasing his
chalkings, the College revealed that "it will only erase
what it feels comfortable eras-

ing."

The college handbook

(1998-99 edition) states that

"Anonymous offensive expres-

sion is generally inexcusable,
but the risk of harm in making
all adjudicable forms of offensive expression... would seriously endanger academic freedom. Even when individuals
(or groups) admit authorship,
however, they act irresponsibly if they are unwilling to engage in a defense of their view,
especially with those targeted."

The handbook further
states, "It needs stressing
again that the College will in
no way formally discourage
any argument, provided it does
not include threats of violence,
though what is said may be deplorable and very possible
more diatribe than argument."
Kramer's
Following
chalking, additional chalkings
appeared near his supporting
the right for free speech. One
statement, signed "Anon," read
"All cops are pigs." At the
time ofthis printing, the chalking has not been erased.
If that's the way [the authors of the erased chalkings
are] going to air their grievances," he said, "then I don't
feel they're getting their
money's worth out of their

education."
Goundie continued that
there were "other avenues to
voice complaints," suggesting
that students with a complaint
concerning Public Safety
should go directly to them.

Student Council overturns BC
decision to cut Olde Club funding
by Nate Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer
Overturning a Budget
Committee decision, Student
Council restored full funding
of over $9OOO per semester
to the management of Olde
Club last Thursday.
Committee
Budget
halved this year's funding for
Olde Club when its representatives failed to show up for
spring budgeting last year.
"Spring budgeting is
very important for us to
know where we stand," said
Josh Bess 'OO, Budget Committee Treasurer. According
to Bess, planning is essential
because BC still does not
know the total amount of
money the committee has
available this year. BC uses
the threat of cutting groups'
funding in half as incentive
for groups to meet with them
for spring budgeting.
"It's an unwritten rule,"
Bess explains, adding that
"you almost have to try to get
your budget halved. If
groups meet BC halfway,

their funding will not be cut."
According to Bess, BC
publicizes spring budgeting
and tries to schedule appointments that are convenient for
organizations' members.
However, it is ultimately the
organizations' treasurers that
are responsible for the actual
meeting. "It's their job to
know what's going on."
Olde Club manager Andy
Smith 'Ol argued that this
year's Olde Club staff, hired
after spring budgeting, is not
responsible for the budgeting
fiasco or the inattention of
last year's staff. "Olde Club
was under completely different management [last semester]," Smith said. "It was negligence on their part."
Olde Club director Kate
Bernstein '99 said that $4500
a semester is not enough to
maintain the number and
quality of Olde Club events.
She argued that Olde Club
serves the entire student body
and therefore is unlike most
other activities. "We felt it
was unfair that the whole
campus was being punished

because of one person," she
said.
The new Olde Club staff
appealed the funding cut before Budget Committee on
September 20, but BC unanimously upheld its earlier decision.
Olde Club then appealed
to Student Council on September 24, when SC voted 70 with three abstentions to
fund Olde Club fully. BC cut
Olde Club's budget for outside performers to $4500 per
semester and then SC restored it to a full $9OOO.
According to Bess, Olde
Club has separate funds for
refreshments, which brings
the group's total budget to
nearly 11,000 dollars a semester.
Bernstein maintained
that Olde Club should have
been given this budget all
along. "For them to keep the
money just sitting there instead of providing entertainment is just ludicrous," said
Bernstein. Bess admitted
"the real ramifications of this
are political."

The budgets of Film Society, Student Art Association, SQU and SOCA have
also been trimmed in half.
Those of Catholic Student
Community and the a capella
group Oscar and Emily will
also be cut if those groups
fail to meet with BC.
Horatiu Stefan 'Ol, budget committee liaison to SC,
predicts that other groups
with halved budgets will
probably also appeal, and
that this will force Student
Council to make tough decisions.
"Either they reverse the
decision for everyone or they
will set up a hierarchy of
what they judge to be important groups and what are not
important groups," he said.
Smith said he thinks it is
unlikely that other groups
will try to appeal their funding cuts just because Olde
Club won its appeal.
"The purpose of Budget
Committee is not to set precedents but to make decisions based on clubs' requests," he stated.

Mary Lyon Cancels Halloween Party

petition. They will not be the
standard, gym-bag-toting athletes Swarthmore typically
witnesses during major tournaments. Rather, this weekend
will present a far different
competitor. These will be far
better dressed than their athletic brethren, though they will
undoubtedly be somewhat
scrawnier. This weekend, both
the College Bowl and Debate
teams will be kicking off their
respective seasons by hosting
novice tournaments.
Beginning late Friday afternoon, the debate team expects to host 40 teams, coming from a variety of different
schools such as Princeton,
University ofVirginia, George
Washington University, and
Bucknell. Following the conclusion of the Friday rounds,
the club has planned a party,
after which debaters from
other schools will retire to
their sleeping bags in dorms
around campus. Competition
will close by late afternoon on
Saturday. All debaters will be
novices, meaning that they
have never debated before on
the college level. "This is the
first year that we are holding
a novice tournament, and
we're doing it because we feel
that novice retention is very
important to the ongoing
health of the league and the society," said club president
Damon Taaffe '99. "It can be
frustrating for novice debaters
to face the top teams in the
nation straight off, so the purpose is to acclimate them to
the style's nuances before
competing with some of the
best debaters in the world."
The debate club has high
hopes for the coming year. In addition to veterans Taaffe, Wendy
Lawrence '99, Ed Cohn '99,
Alecia Magnifico 'OO, Darius
Ornston 'OO, Jeff Levine 'OO, and
John Dolan 'Ol, the club boasts a
large rookie class led by Andy
Wong 'O2 and Sonal Bhatia 'Ol,
the winners of the club's inner
novice tournament. "I think this
year's rookie class is one of the
most talented in Swarthmore history and certainly is among the
top in the league," said Taaffe. "If
they compete frequently, I see no
reason why we couldn't have five
or six debaters in contention for
the league's Novice of the Year
award."
Not to be outdone, the College Bowl is also holding a tournament this weekend for freshmen and sophomores. "Several
junior birds, or tournaments for
freshmen and sophomores, are
held every year," said team copresident Ed Cohn '99. "Our tournament will be one of the largest." The team expects 18 fourmember competitors from ten
schools, among which are Yale
University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Delaware,
and University of Maryland.
Last year, the College Bowl
Team was highly successful, finishing 11th in the nation at the
National Championships and
winning the prestigious NAQT
undergraduate championship,
which goes to the top school with
no graduate students. Following
last year's success, the team has
high expectations for the coming
year. "We have three members
of last year's A-team coming
back: Josh Miller 'OO, myself, and
Jessica Harbour '99," said Cohn.
"In addition, it looks like we have
the most impressive crop of new
players in years."

Contributing Writer
The irony of ironies may be that, in reviewing such a hilarious film, I must give
some sober advice:
See The Impostors, for your own wellbeing.
Writer/ Director/Actor Stanley Tucci
follows up his successful, warmhearted
"Big Night" with The Impostors, a farcical, lollygagging, and ultimately delightful
work. Its central message—that we just
think we're screwed up in the head until we
see everyone else—is a comical childhood
lesson with underlying truth, one of which
we all need to be reminded.
Tucci presents this truth with the most
inane plot since "Dumb and Dumber". Set
in the 19305, it involves two unemployed
stage actors, Maurice (Oliver Piatt) and
Arthur (Tucci), who impose their dramatic
skills on unknowing Manhattan pedestrians.
Accused ofassaulting theirtheatrical nemesis Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina) and
hounded by the police, the two seek refuge
in a shipping crate, which is loaded onto a
luxury liner.
So "The Impostors" is set into motion.
The bulk of the film, which takes place on
the ship, follows the two outlaw stowaways.
Along the way, they encounter both passengers and crew, including (but not limited to):
Meistrich, the Germanfascist head steward;
Sparks, the masculine
Scottish homosexual tennis champion; Jeremy
Burtom, the aforementioned loathsome theatrical nemesis of Maurice
and Arthur; and Happy
c .
Franks, the morose and suicidal baritone.
In comparison to these humorously insane characters, some of whom have nefarious agendas, the two unemployed actors suddenly look and feel benign. Once
weirdos, Maurice and Arthur are now the
jolly protagonists who go to no end (and
leave no prank unturned) to save themselves
and everyone else from the evil plans of
both passengers and crew, including (but
once again not limited to): theft, murder and
terrorism.
The plotalone is certainly enough to drive
away most viewers. But imagine where Austin Powers would be today had everyone read
a plot summary before watching the film. The
Impostors is not about the plot, which rolls
on with such illogical impetus you can't help
but laugh; it's about gags, pranks, slaps,
bruises, sex, and freaks.
This is not to say that The Impostors
will attain the frenzied success of "Austin
Powers". Though it still has that 90s sophomoric humor we've all come to love and
quote, it is largely a backward-looking film.
It draws eagerly from Chaplin, Laurel and
Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and the Marx
Brothers. The opening scene, a silent and
choppy staged fight between Maurice and

Isabella Rossellini (above) and Steve Busceni (below) star in Stanley Tucci's
The Impostors, photos courtesy Fox Searchlight Pictures.
Arthur, is unmistakably a tribute to the classic film comedians.
Give Tucci credit for creating a convincing backward-looking work with modern
appeal. The acting really is superb, and, as
Tucci himself noted, any one of the actors
could have played any of the roles just as
convincingly. Of the 19 or so principal actors, most are thespians at heart, and their
stage presence shows, making "The Impostors" all the more theatrical.
Music and set also
give "The Impostors" that
1930s panache. The music, which cuts in and out
at the tap of a finger, is
consummately vaudevillian, and you'll certainly
find yourself humming
along after the 50th or so
time you hear the same
tune. The set, too, has a
vaudevillian fakeness to it. With the exterior of the ship and the blue sea beyond so
pitifully plastic, you can't help but feel
they're mocking "Titanic".
I'll admit, though, I was at first very
skeptical of the film. It slaps you in the face
with a new and completely insipid world.
But as the film went on, the set, the characters and the mood grew on me, and about
halfway through I found myself rollicking
along with the other audience members.
Yet for all its good qualities, "The Impostors" doesn't have the recipe to match
"Duck Soup". Its 90s sensibility carries baggage, and its emulation of earlier works is
flawed in key ways. The dialogue fill-ins
from the silent era appear here, but only as
distractions, and the musical direction
grated after a while.
Most importantly though, the direction
and the writing lacks the superhuman briskness of the early era, where the movie was
always one step ahead of your brain. Here,
the gags don't follow quickly enough and
funny scenes are often cut short without
their full potential used, leaving the viewer
with a few good jokes but without a stomach-rupturing frenzy of laughter.
Luckily, "The Impostors" isn't the sum

of its flaws but the sum of its vision and execution. In getting the awesome opportunity
to participate in a Q & A with Tucci and two
actors after the screening, I got a real sense
for the film. Both Billy Connolly, (teacher
from "Head of the Class",) who plays the
Scottish tennis star, and Hope Davis, who
plays a morbid, death-obsessed teenager,
harped on how fun it was making this film. I
gather that shooting the film, from the actors'
tales of fart machines and golden hams, was
apparently just as fun as watching it.
That sense of fun shines in every scene
of "The Impostors". It swept me off my feet
and carried me to a preposterous world of
cross-dressers, perverted Nazis, and guys
named Happy Franks. It was a refreshing
change from Swarthmore and allowed me a
glimpse into a wacky and senseless world
which I sometimes wish existed. Swatties
need that. And it also reminded me that, despite what my professors, parents, and neurosurgeon may say, I'm still a normal Joe.
Swatties need that, too. Don't worry though:
even if these profundities aren't slapping you
in the face like Tucci intended, you'll still get
a few laughs. And that, after all, is the point
of any comedy.
Pretty ironic, isn't it?

beneficiaries ofthe boom are now

second-rate universities.
For the time being, the
people's taxes are used to subsidize higher education for the rich.

In addition to the muchpublicized and popularized
Chinese New Year, this fall sees
the arrival of another special
day for Chinese around the
world. The Mid-Autumn festival falls on the fifteenth day of
the lunar calendar, usually
sometime between late September and early October on
the Western calendar.
The festival, commonly
known as the "Mooncake festival" to many Westerners, is
not just about mooncakes, as
tasty as they are. While nowadays the celebration does revolve around a hearty family
meal and mooncakes for dessert afterwards, a rich mythology underlies this ancient tradition.
The "Titanic" of Mid-Autumn features the story of
Chang Er, a young servant of
the Jade Emperor in heaven
who was banished to earth after breaking a valuable porcelain. On Earth she befriends
Hou Yi, an expert archer. And
Hou is no average Joe Schmoe.
He saves the day by shooting

down nine
suns that
emerged alongside the regular
one, instantly rising to hero status. He soon becomes king and
marries Chang.
But power soon corrupts
Hou. He exhausts the country's
funds trying to develop a elixir
that will make him immortal.
Yet Chang, who spots the pill
which contained the elixir before its completion, swallows it
on the spur of the moment, perhaps also out of desperation and
a desire to spite Hou. An enraged Hou hunts Chang down,
and during her escape, after
jumping out of the window, instead of falling, she floats towards the moon.
Hou tries to shoot Chang
down from the moon to no avail.
As punishment, Chang is reduced to a three-legged toad by
the Queen Mother during her
tenure on the moon.
In the meantime, King Hou
relocates to the sun. Hence visa-vis Chang on the moon, they
also come to represent the "Yin"
and the "Yang," or in laymen
terms, the subdued, withdrawn
side versus the bustling and energetic. And in honor of this
symbolism, in ancient times

come the full moon, the
women of the household would

make offerings of incense,
fruit, flowers and of course
mooncakes at the altar.
While the festival arises
from a rich legend, the
mooncake boasts much more
utilitarian origins. Believe it or
not, it started out as a revolutionary tool. At the turn of the
ancient Yuan dynasty
ruled
revolutionby the Mongols
ary Liu Futong stuffed small
pieces of paper printed with the
starting date and time of his
campaign to overthrow the
Mongols in the cakes before
passed them along to friends in
the guise of honoring the longevity of the Mongolian emperor.
And this coming Monday, courtesy of PRO, you
will have the opportunity to
revel in the colorful festivities as well as revolutionary
spirit that have come to define the Mid-Autumn festival. Sharpies will be serving
mooncakes over dinner; also
keep an eye out for the unique
decor used, the centerpiece of
which is the multi-faceted

Shudder to Think has been
taking a break from their strict
regimen of ascetic art rock recently to write a couple movie
soundtracks. This offering, recorded for the movie "First
Love, Last Rites," should be
quite a surprise to their longtime
fans; it's all unfettered classic
pop. This is not to say there are
any covers here, but it's all music you'd expect on a jukebox
in a nostalgia diner. The album
is uniformly well done, with
excellent production by Nathan
Larson. Most tracks carry guest
vocalists; Jeff Buckley, Liz
Phair, Billy Corgan, and John
Doe, among others, appear on
the album. My favorite track on
this one is the thirteenth, "Just
Really Wanna See You," where
Mimi Parker and Alan
Spearhawk carry on a swingin'
teen lovers' conversation,
backed by big Beach Boy drums
and beginning with a dramatic
reading from the diary of a besotted girl. Spearhawk's lusty
vocals remind me at times of
"(I've Had) The Time of My
Life" from Dirty Dancing, in a
good way. The members of
Shudder to Think are really very
accomplished musically (my
roommate from last year has
spent a good many hours making sure I'm aware of this). On
this album they allow themselves to unfurl the full glory of
their pop abilities, instead of repeatedly denying them in the
name of art, as they are prone to
do in most of their work.

Slow River

He's so Cash! This is an introspective set of low-down
country songs from a goodlooking scrawny man. I like it
because he doesn't like himself
very much, but he doesn't seem
too angry at anyone else. His
opening song, "Confidence," is
about his continual defeat, and
in "Doris Days," he looks upon
his past with regret and some
clever wordplay, revolving
around punning on a movie star.
He backs up his low, gritty echo
of a voice with some simple
guitar and other sparse
instrumentals. His is a very indoors sound, which echoes the
comfort one feels in a ski lodge
after a hearty day of snow play,
or maybe more accurately, duck
hunting. This is warming-up
music, and it's clear that the
singer himself has spent his allotted time outdoors. At least
that's .the feeling one gets until
one looks at a picture of the
man. He really is scrawny and
coffeehouse, but I suppose that
makes it all the more amazing
that he's able to project a smokesmelling John Wayne figure.

This CD is a gem in a really
cheap package. No stylish cardboard case for this new-wavish
popster (Science Park is one guy
from Boston). He doesn't even
get a multi-page CD booklet.
The album comes with a single
black-and-white insert. I have
friends who have put out betterlooking CDs from their basements. This is why it's so surprising to find full, lush music
of incredible beauty within.
Myke Weiskopf, the one guy,
pulls every string there is, and
very effectively. The music is
full of driving drum machine
work that underlies sweet, fun
keyboarding, reminding one of
New Order or the Future Bible
Heroes. The lyrics don't really
stand out, but the music itself is
excellent synthpop. Something
that distinguishes Science Park
from a lot of other such bands
is that there's a certain dark element to the nature of the pop
here. It may be rich, sweet and
full, but it's also weighted down
with bass, twisted tones and a
general melancholy. One of the
most questionable things on the
album is a Stephen Merritt cover,
"Lonely Highway." It's a great
song, and performed very well,
only Weiskopf's style is already
very much like Merrit's. What's
the use of doing a cover ifyou're
just going to make a carbon copy
ofthe original? Well, anyway, the
album is a good listen even if the
philosophy behind some of it is a
bit off.

After President Clinton's
support last week of a $l5 billion increase for the military by
2000, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
testified to the Senate Armed
Forces Committee Tuesday of a
history of irresponsible military
spending by the government.
Gen. Henry Shelton, Chiefs
chairman, argued for new weapons, the closing of unnecessary
bases to increase military readiness, and the need to put the military above domestic politics. The
Committeeresponded that readiness had not been a fear in February testimony and that serious
problems such as pilot shortages
and training cuts, had been sugarcoated then by the Chiefs. Sen.
John McCain(R), who had suggested in Feb. that combat readiness was wearing thin, criticized
Shelton's reversals as bureaucratic and irresponsible.
Government documents on
the Kennedy assassination were
released to the public Wednesday, to conclude a six-year investigation by a citizen commission.
The commission, created in
1992, was given free access to
Government records, to dispel
rumors of government conspiracy created by the film J.F.K.
Documents include notes from
Oswald's F.8.1, interrogation, as
well as F. 8.1, and CI.A. files on
him, but nothing likely to refute
the Warren Commission's decision of Oswald's lone guilt. The
commission, including three university history professors, concluded that the government itself
had contributed most to conspiracy theory by keeping documents from the public.

A group of Chinese dissidents signed and posted on the
Net two antigovernment manifestos this week (http://
www.dfn.org.) The first condemned Communist Party rule
as both against the will of the
people and using a legal system ruled by elite interest. The
second manifesto attacked the
theft of market economy benefits, by corrupt officials and
powerholders, from workers.
All signers, including Jiang

son was murdered in the

they did not sweep the competition, Swat men and women both
had first place finishes and made
an otherwise outstanding showing. The men ran an excellent 8K

22-37, tying Allentown 28-28,
and only losing to Lebanon Valley 34-23. Missing three oftheir

Depression strikes millions- indiscriminately. Depression is simply a suppression
of brain activity that makes life unbearable. And even though depression is
readily treatable, only 1 in 5 ever seeks treatment. Why do so many just drag
themselves along or eventually seek relief through suicide? First, there's the lack
of awareness of depression- as an illness and as the threat that it is to each and
every one of us. Second, there's the unwarranted negative stigma attached to it.

Field hockey slams opponents in tourney
by Jean Quinn
Sports Editor
Swat faced a challenging
week of competition and came
out on top with a slew of fine
performances. The Garnet took
NCAA final-four caliber Lebanon-Valley to double overtime
and defeated Elms and
Haverford en route to an overtime victory over Wellesley to
capture the Seven Sisters Championship. Swat is now 7-2 overall, 2-1 in the Centennial Con-

ference.

Coming off the loss to
Gettysburg, the Garnet encountered the second ranked team in
the Southeast Region. LebanonValley jumped out to a 2-0 lead
and were coasting towards an
easy victory with six minutes
remaining. Holly Baker '99
took charge and found the inside
of the cage twice to tie the game
and force overtime. She tallied
her second goal with less than
30 seconds left in regulation.
The hard-fought contest came to
an end with just over a minute
left in the second overtime when
Leb-Val broke the tie.
Kristen English 'Ol commented, "The Leb Valley game
was one of those experiences
that epitomizes our reasons for
enduring a tough pre-season,
hard practices, and long bus
rides. It was such a thrilling
experience, and I'm so proud of
all of us. Watching them score
that game winning goal was
crushing, but we played our
hearts out and knew it. We left

everything on the field and went
home satisfied."
The Garnet traveled to Boston Massachusetts the next day
to defend their title in the Seven
Sisters Tournament. The top
seed, the Garnet overpowered
their first round opponent Elms,
11-0. Baker knocked two goals
in to the cage in the first seven
minutes of play. Lurah Hess '99
and Becca Stites 'OO each
notched 2 goals and a pair of
assists, and Alison Gaffney 'O2
scored her first two collegiate
goals. Jen Hagan '99, Katie Tarr
'O2, and Erika Williams 'Ol also
scored goals. In addition, English, Julie Finnegan 'OO,
Natania Kremer 'Ol, Krista
Hollis 'Ol and Donna Griffin
'99 all earned assists in the out-

ing.

"I think it boosted our coneven more to know we
still had the power to dominate
an entire game," Williams said.
Indeed, Swat controlled the
match from the beginning,
outshooting Elms 24-1.
The Garnet faced their perennial foe, the Haverford Fords,
in the second round. A scoreless first half was shocking for
some.
Hess commented,
"Haverford had several fast forwards and played with the usual
extra intensity every Haverford
team finds when they play Swarthmore." Baker came through
again for the squad, scoring the
game's only two goals in the
second period. Hess and Hagan
assisted the goals.
The team rated their own

fidence

performance in this match as
less than stellar. "We were not
aggressive enough in our advances toward the ball. Our play
against Haverford was pretty
frantic," noted English. "I think
we were worrying too much
about the consequences of the
game, rather than focusing on
the specific task at hand."
Coach Karen Borbee added,
"We played well but wasted
many opportunities. We outshot
them 27-2 and only scored
twice. We have to improve in
this area to be successful down
the stretch."
The contest propelled Swat
back into the title bout, where
they would face the home team,
the regionally ranked Wellesley,
who has been the runner-up in
the tournament to Swarthmore
for the past two years. English
scored the first goal of the final
contest to give her team the lead
and the momentum. "Kristen's
goal was great because it was a
put back off arebound from the
Wellesley goalie. She was at the
right place at the right time and
definitely made the most of her

Wellesley battled back though to
tie the match and to force overtime.

faked out the keeper, who fell

her time and assure that her shot

With that slow-motion finale, the Garnet captured their
fourth Seven Sisters title in the
past five years. Griffin was
named the Tournament's Most
Valuable Player. "Donna works

the All-Tournament team as
well. Hess said of her teammate, "Holly just has a way of
stepping in and doing what
needs to be done in a game (and
she always finishes it with a
smile)." English summed it up
best, "Donna and Holly were
terrific as always. Holly pursues
the ball with so much tenacity
and always seems to come up
with it. Donna just amazes me
and plays with the heart of no
other. She deserved exactly
what she got and so much
more."

A tale of two halves. That's the best
way to describe the Garnet Tide's 2028 loss to the Bullets of Gettysburg
College. Throughout the first half, it appeared Gettysburg would trounce the
Tide. With four minutes remaining in
the first quarter, the Bullets scored
twice on methodically engineered
drives. Gettysburg had stuffed the
Tide's first two possessions, forcing
early punts and taking advantage of
field position. Although the young
Swarthmore defense contained the
Bullets, Gettysburg added a third score
early in the second quarter. It appeared
the Garnet Tide had not yet learned
from the previous week's loss.
This is not last year's Garnet Tide,
however, as the Bullets soon discov-

Alvanos ripped into his ineffective offense. Emotionally charged, the offense
took the field and began to move the
football. Swarthmore began to use
multiple receiver formations to stretch
the Bullet defense across the field. Finally, the Tide began to successfully run
the ball. While the offense enjoyed
modest success, the Garnet defense
rested. As the half came to a close, it
was clear that Swarthmore was gaining momentum.
The Garnet Tide emerged from the
locker room trailing 21-0, but feeling
more confident. The Swarthmore defense became more aggressive as Tony
Skiadas '99 stuffed the once potent
Bullet running attack. As Gettysburg
faced long yardage situations, Charlie
Parlapanides '99 and Brian Byrnes 'O2
tormented the Bullet passer into a 5 for
18 performance. Tony Hillery 'Ol led
all defenders with 13 tackles while Jon
Banner 'O2 added 10 of his own. The
defense was sparked by a 50 yard interception returned for a touchdown by
Rob Castellucci 'Ol. (Castellucci was
named to the Conference honor roll for
his interception and six tackles.)

Just as the Swarthmore defense
gained strength, the offense took on
new life. Behind the left side ofthe line,
Carlo Fitti 'OOand Doug Kneeland 'O2,
running backs Joe Aleffi 'OO and
Donovan Goodly 'O2 enjoyed success.
Aleffi, who earned recognition from the
conference for his 4.5 yards-per-carry
effort, capped off his day by scoring
on a one yard dive. To compliment
Aleffi, Goodly used his deceptive speed
to gain 103 yards on the ground including a 37 yard scamper to set up Aleffi's
score. As the Gettysburg defense tightened to stop the run, quarterback Scott
Murray 'Ol adeptly carved the opponent. Murray threw for 95 yards to five
different receivers including a 15 yard
scoring strike to Brian Bell '99.
While the Garnet Tide prepares for
this week's homecoming opponent,
Ursinus, the team cannot help but feel
some enthusiasm. The young team has
learned important lessons, including
that they cannot afford to wait until the
second half to play. More importantly
the team is learning to believe in itself.
Armed with this new sense ofresiliency
and confidence, the team looks to capture its first win in more than two seasons this Saturday at home.

"Donna always plays aggressively, gets her body and

scores lone goal
in shutout victory
against Widener

On Saturday, September 26, the
Garnet played host to Western Maryland in a Centennial Conference game.
Western Maryland then proceeded to
demolish them, handing Swarthmore a
5-1 loss.
On Sept. 29, the Garnet snapped
an eight game losing streak with a 1-0
victory over Widener University in
Chester. Scott "Speed Racer" Samels
'99 scored the lone tally of the game
off a pass from Tirian "The Tank" Mink
'9B in the 17th minute of play. Andrew
"the Amazing" Kramer 'O2 turned

away eight Pioneer shots for the shutout.

"We showed up big. We got one
early goal and never gave up the lead.
Usually we go down one goal early and
enter into a downward spiral," said
Tirian Mink. "But I liked doing it this
way better- its much more fun to win."
"I really thought we played a nice
game as a team, especially in the first
half. Our team play/short passing/
movement as a team up the field allowed us to be dangerous," added
Samels. "We were able to knock the
ball around and gain possession which
ultimately enabled us to put the ball in
the back of their net."
"We reconsidered what we'd been
doing for the past eight games, and
when we came to the field, we were
like caged panthers ready to burst free."
Kramer recalled.
