"We have been doing our best to

said. "All of the fasters have been
encouraged to tell their parents, tell
their relatives, tell their friends at
home, tell their environmental groups
from their high schools, and really just

Many students who expressed interest in raising awareness for the

to fast or are unable to due to dietary
reasons are participating in alternative
ways, such as giving up meat. A roster

The Climate Justice Fast is an international organization consisting of
activists from over 22 countries fasting
for the time leading up to the

SFAP voices concerns about financial aid cuts
BY DANTE FUOCO
dfuocol@swarthmore. edu

Earlier this week, members from the
Student Advisory Panel drafted a letter to
the Ad Hoc Financial Planning Group and
the Board of Managers that voiced students' concerns over proposed budget cuts,
namely to financial aid.
Board members are meeting tomorrow
and Saturday to review the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group's proposed $6.85
million in budget cuts for the 2010-2011
school year.

SFAP members will present the recommendations outlined in their letter at the
planning group's final meeting today and at
the board's meeting tomorrow. The letter
was sent to both the planning group and the
board before their respective meetings.
"We wanted the letter to be sent to Board
members in advance so that they would be
aware of students' concerns and positions
on the budget cuts and future decision-making processes," Student Council President

and SFAP member Rachel Bell 'lO said in
an e-mail. "We're excited to be given the
opportunity; normally a student statement
is not sent out with the other preparation
materials in advance of the meeting."
Financial Policy Representative and
SFAP member Dan Symonds 'll echoed
BeU.
"[The letter] outlines tenets that we feel
are important to keep," Symonds said. "I
think we do a pretty good job of bringing up
concerns that [the board members] might

not have been aware of because of their
proximity to student life."
The letter states SFAP members' opinion on what should be preserved within the
such as faculty and staff health
college
benefits, fair compensation and the honors
program
but focuses most particularly
on students' concern over proposed
changes to financial aid.
"[The letter] attempts to lay out the student position on how financial aid is an
integral part of the Swarthmore campus
and student body, and how its effects are
wide-ranging," said Will Glovinsky 'l2, who

is a member of the Student Advisory
Committee to the Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid. "We're basically saying as

students we disagree with cuts to financial
aid."
Glovinsky added that the letter aims to
register the "student side on this debate,
which is something that hasn't happened."
"There was just a general concern that
students were being cut out of the process,
which is a legitimate concern because we
were not on the ad-hoc committee,"
Glovinsky said, referring to the fact that
there are no students on the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group, which created
the $6.85 budget cut proposal as a response
to the college's weakened endowment.
Though Glovinsky is neither a member
of SFAP nor a signatory on the letter, he
said that he helped draft an early version of
the letter and was consulted on the part
that focuses on financial aid.
Nate Erskine 'lO, Student Council Vice
President and SFAP member, stressed the
importance of focusing on financial aid.
"In all honesty, I think that's where the
dialogue should be focused," Erksine said.
that are going to
"[T]hese are the things
have the greatest impact on the lives of students here."
There is a proposed $457,000 cut or 21
percent reduction
to financial aid in the
Ad Hoc Financial Planning Group's preliminary budget recommendations, which
were released last month.
Though there is this proposed cut to
financial aid, Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Jim Bock
who is a mem...

THE PHOENIX

ber of the financial planning group
stressed that the college's "policy" on financial aid would not change under this proposal. If the board were to approve this proposal, the college would maintain needblind admissions and meet all of students'

"demonstrated need."
While the budget cut to financial aid is
the smallest percentage-wise reduction of
all of the proposed budget cuts, the letter
nevertheless states: "Such cuts begin to
compromise the college experience of students on financial aid and the student body

as a whole."
When making its recommendations, the
Ad Hoc Financial Planning Group aimed to
make sure that the cuts would be a shared
sacrifice or shared burden across the college, meaning that "no group would be
unfairly targeted," Erskine said.
In response to this idea, the letter states:
"Although we respect the concept of 'shared
burden' established by the Ad Hoc Group,
we fear that balancing our budget deficit by
restructuring financial aid will unevenly
impact aided students."
The Ad Hoc Financial Planning Group
has presented three options that the college

could take in restructuring financial aid:
increasing expected campus job hours from

approximately 7.5 hours per week to 10
hours per week, increasing expected summer earning, or reintroducing federal

loans.
SFAP's letter goes on the state "how
these proposed changes, if implemented,
would profoundly alter the basic experiences of aided students."
The letter claims that the expected
weekly work of 7-8 hours for aided students,
which hasn't changed in decades, "has been
understood as the maximum amount a
Swarthmore student can afford to work
while balancing a full course schedule."
If this expectation were to increase to 10
hours, students would be less able to dedicate time for things such as "class preparation, course and major selection, lecture
attendance, unpaid club, committee and
student council positions, internships and
volunteer tutoring."
"The proposed increase in weekly work
hours will present more stressful challenges for many of our aided students. It is
in the college's best interest to ensure that
these students can thrive here," SFAP
members state in the letter.
They add that finding more hours will
be more difficult for students than in the
past because "student jobs have been and
will be cut from facilities, the Deans Office,
academic departments and libraries."
The letter also mentions that increased
summertime work requirements could
stand "in the way of students' ability to pursue unpaid internships and volunteer work
in areas of interest," which "help build students' resumes and serve as crucial experiences and skill-building opportunities."
As students often rely on college
research and Lang Center grants to get
their summer earnings, the letter adds: "As
hiring slows and paid internships become
volunteer positions, more students will be
applying for fewer Swarthmore grants in
an increasingly competitive job market."
Lastly, the letter says that some students

"[The administration] cares about the
same things. It's just that we obviously
have a different perspective because we're
students," Glovinsky said, pointing out that

the proposed cut to financial aid is, indeed,
the smallest cut by percentage for the col-

lege.

At a town-hall discussion with Bock and

Acting Dean of Students Garikai Campbell
before Thanksgiving Break, Director of

Financial Aid Laura Talbot distributed a
sheet to attendants that listed both pros and
cons to increasing expected summer earning contribution or increasing expected
campus job hours.
She noted in an interview that while
these two components are included on students' financial aid packages, they aren't
required. Some students may choose to
work more during the semester and less in
the summer, or may even choose to not
work at all and take out loans. "It's a student decision what he does," she said.
She added that a quarter of aided students don't work at air and a quarter work
more than seven or eight hours per week.
Talbot and Bock noted, too, that spending on financial aid has gone up 30 percent
in the past two years. For this year, the college is spending $23.8 million for need-

based scholarship. Both stressed that families' need is expected to go up for the
upcoming academic year.
Bock said that, with the $457,000 of proposed cuts to financial aid, the college is
"slowing the growth" of this spending
"without much harm to the students."
"I'm comfortable with [financial aid]
being on the table, but still being the small-

est piece," he said.
Bock conceded, however, that all proposed budget cuts are "painful decisions."
Increased student involvement now and

beyond

The last part of the letter both commends the administration for its cooperation and stresses the necessity of continuing this kind of dialogue between students

and administrators.

"Initially, Swarthmore students were
dissatisfied with the lack of student representation on the Ad Hoc Financial
Planning Group. We greatly appreciate the
administration's willingness to work with

how this would be executed.
Symonds and Glovinsky noted that the
letter in no way is meant to attack the
administration.

include, among others, the Deans' Office,
academic departments and the financial aid
department. The letter mentions that, in
the spring, StuCo plans to "mobilize relevant student committees" with its own
members as well as other interested students.
Secondly, the letter expresses an interest

in students' involvement for the expected
$ll5 million that is still undetermined: "We
do not want students to lose the opportunity that we have had this semester to participate in the dialogue surrounding momentous alterations to the budget of the college,
particularly as it becomes more and more
difficult to identify non-essential portions
of the budget."
Finally, the letter states that students
would like to be involved in the "strategic
direction-setting process starting in the
2010-2011 academic year."
SFAP was formed earlier in the year to
form a bridge between students and the college during the planned budget adjustment.
The panel has worked with StuCo and
administrators to organize events over the
past weeks, such as a presentation of the
budget proposal and a town-hall discussion
with Bock and Campbell. The group has
also met with administrators over the
semester to discuss the budget.
Campbell, a member of the planning
group, expressed his appreciation for students' involvement. "This group of students
has been, as expected, ... really dedicated,
really conscientious about thinking
through things very thoroughly from the
student perspective and providing key
insights into how students think of some of
the things that we're proposing," he said.
Bock echoed Campbell. "SFAP and
StuCo have been really good at fostering a
feedback loop in a short amount of time,"
he said. "I'm glad that they were able to
voice their opinion on the proposal."

have seen the reintroduction of loans as

potentially problematic not only because
the college just went loan-free but also
because "job opportunities after college are
becoming rarer, and repaying a loan may
become a burden on some students." If
loans were to be introduced, the letter asks
that students would be more involved in

SFAP, and have found our meetings very
productive," SFAP members said in the letter. "We would like to continue with this
spirit of cooperation and opennness as the
budget discussions move forward in three
ways."

Journalist, filmmaker evaluates social networking
BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Ahmadinejad
Mahmoud
over Mir Hossein
Mousavi in June, violence poured
through the streets of Iran. But as the
government began suppressing lines of
communication often used in social
uprisings, Iranians turned to a new
medium: Facebook and Twitter.
Kouross Esmaeli,
an
IranianAmerican journalist and filmmaker,
gave a multimedia presentation earlier
this week entitled, "Tweeting in Tehran:
How to Win or Lose a Revolution in the
21st Century." The event was held on
Tuesday afternoon in the Scheuer Room.
Esmaeli reminded the audience that
the past 100 years of Iranian history have
been marked by many revolutions and
strikes. The 2009 presidential election
was "not transparent at all. There were
many irregularities
many mobile
polling places were without poll watchers," he said.
Most suspiciously, while it was
expected to take three days to tally the
votes, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
was declared the winner only three
hours after the polls closed, Esmaeli
added.
His opponent, Mir Hossein Mousavi,
was far more liberal-minded, advocating
social justice and a relaxation of the
strict social laws currently in place in
Iran. His supporters were horrified by
his defeat, especially Under such questionable circumstances, but their efforts
to protest led to violence with the government's paramilitary groups and
attempts to silence the protesters.
"For three days after election, the
Iranian government shut down as much
communication as possible," Esmaeli

said. Text messaging was shut down withthe help of private companies like Nokia.
except
Most Internet connections
landlines
were cut down. Members of
the foreign media had their visas cancelled and were forced to leave the country.

While the citizens ofIran were able to
successfully boycott Nokia, eventually
regain texting, and use the slower landlines, they were not able to bring in global reporters. Instead, they filled the void
themselves, uploading cell phone footage

of the demonstrations and clashes with
the military and sending out messages
through Twitter and Facebook.
"The people used cell phone footage to
tell the world, 'Everything is not okay,'"
Esmaeli said.
Esmaeli said that the Iranian regime
blamed the riots on a small number of
Westerners seeking to create chaos,
remembering a CIA-led coup d'etat in
1953. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians
contradicted this statement by participating in a silent protest in the streets on
the fourth day after the election.
The situation only grew worse as
Supreme Leader Ayatolla Khamenei, an
extremely popular figure who Esmaeli
called "an arbiter between left and right,"
aligned himself with Ahmadinejad. This
gave the paramilitary units free reign to
attack the crowds, which led to the
deaths of somewhere between 10 and 50
people, including Neda, a university student. She became an icon of the conflict
when her demise was captured on video
and uploaded to the Internet.
The media coverage of tweeting from
Iran came to a halt on June 25, when
Michael Jackson died, and "the world
stopped paying attention to Iran in favor
of the King of Pop," Esmaeli said. Over
time, the government restored texting

and internet to the people, and the conflict "became a political struggle rather
than a confrontational one," he said.
Now the government is developing a
web presence of its own, with blogs,
Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts
for officials like the Ayatollah.
Furthermore, the various ministries
communicate through the Internet,
which is why it could not be entirely
removed at the height of the problems.
Esmaeli said that this incident shows
that the appearance of "democracy and
an electoral system is not enough to
ensure a fair and legitimate reality." He
said the lesson the world can take from
the conflict is that it is up to the people to
•

stand up to a government that takes too
much power.
Ashley Banks 'l3, who attended the
lecture for her Peace and Conflict
Studies class, said that she found the
video clips particularly fascinating and
informative, noting that many "citizens
help[ed] to protect the crowd control officers.
"It really stuck with me that for the
most part
the crowds kept in mind
that these individuals were human as
well, and just doing their jobs."
Clara Gordon 'll said, "I remembered
it from the news, but I didn't really
understand it then. It was really interesting to get an insider's perspective."

Alum wins Mitchell Scholarship for Ireland study
BY LINDA HOU
rhoul@swarthmore.edu
Calling through a 12-hour

time
zone difference
in
Vietnam, recent George J.
Mitchell Scholarship winner
Yongjun Heo 'O9 explained how
thankful he is for Swarthmore.

"I can't express clearly
enough how grateful I am for
the support I received from not
only my professors and faculty
but also my fellow Swarthmore
students,"
Heo
said.
"Throughout [my first year and
a half at Swarthmore], I was
really able to learn an incredible amount and to become disciplined in a way where I was
able to translate effort into performance."
The Mitchell Scholarship,
named after U.S. Senator
George Mitchell, is sponsored
by the US-Ireland Alliance.
According to the US-Ireland
Alliance website, 12 candidates
are chosen each year from the
U.S. to study in Ireland or
Northern Ireland based on
their "academic excellence,
leadership and community
service."
The scholarship is meant to
promote
the relationship
between the United States and

6

Ireland. Other students chosen
this year include a Purple
Heart recipient and a top collegiate
cyclist.
The
last
Swarthmore student to receive
the scholarship was Elizabeth
Anderson 'O5.
"Ireland appealed to me
because in the future, I want to
study medicine and focus on
preventative medicine," Heo
said. "With the healthcare
reform going on in the U.S.
now, I thought, 'lt'll be interesting to go somewhere where
there is universal healthcare.'"
Next fall, Heo will study
public health at the University
College Dublin.
After this, he plans on
obtaining a medical degree.
Until then, Heo will be in
Vietnam as a Luce scholar. He
is currently working with the
Institute of Population and
Development Studies, a governmental agency and an NGO
focusing on medical care for
migrant workers.
a
While
student
at
Swarthmore, Heo participated
in many activities, such as
serving as Student Council
President. He founded Pemon
Health Inc., a nonprofit organization aimed at bringing students and healthcare workers

to the village of Uriman in

Venezuela for internships.
"He was an excellent student
while he was at Swarthmore,
he was a campus leader, includthe
ing
holding
Student
Council President. He started
his own group, which is now an

independent
organization,"
Fellowships and Prizes Advisor

Melissa Mandos said. "When
you meet him, he comes [off] as
a good ambassador, someone
who can build bridges between
different cultures."
Despite his successes, Heo
pointed out that it was not
always easy for him. Heo said
that he had trouble balancing
the college's academic rigor
and his extracurricular activities during his first year and a
half at Swarthmore.
"For the first year, I played
catch-up," he said. "I got so little sleep. We're all straight-A
coming
into
students
Swarthmore, and it's really a
struggle coming in."
He said, however, that the
discipline he has learned during his time at Swarthmore is
something that is invaluable to
him.
During his sophomore year,
Heo was able to transform his
hard work into results. He was
December 3, 2009

awarded the Lang Opportunity
Scholarship to work at a medical office in rural Venezuela
during that summer.
Heo offered advice to current students who have had to
face similar difficulties: "I
think there are students who
are in that position who really
get discouraged. No matter
what, it's up to you to overcome
that, but it's certainly a possibility for you to succeed and to
do incredibly well in spite of
your struggle."

Upon
returning
from
Veneuzela, Heo formed Pemon
Health Inc., now a nonprofit
organization whose members
include
students
from
Swarthmore,
Haverford,
Bowdoin College, California
Technology,
Institute
of
University
of Pittsburgh,
University
Illinois,
of
University of Notre Dame, and
Indiana University.
In his senior year, Heo
received the Luce Scholarship,
designed
which
is
for
American college graduates to
spend a year working in Asia.
The scholarship is given to
between 15 and 18 students per
year.

The
selection
process
includes a nominationfrom the

eligible colleges and a decision
by a group of selectors. Heo

was one of the three nominated

by Swarthmore. Heo originally
asked
placement
for
in
Vietnam or Indonesia to work.
"I wanted to be in a developing nation with health prob-

lems," he said. "What I did in
Venezuela was in a rural area,
and I wanted to work in an
urban area in a developing
country. I asked to be placed in
Vietnam or Indonesia, and they
found two placements for me
here [in Vietnam]."
Currently, Heo works mainly on the planning stage of projects for both groups. As he
overcomes the language barrier, he hopes to participate in
the implementation of the projects that includes more direct
work with the people.
Heo said that he believes
that Swarthmore was very
helpful in his winning both
scholarships.
"For example, I was able to
have practice interviews for all
of those scholarships, and
that's unbelievable for people
from other colleges," Heo said.
"What we have at Swarthmore
that we do take for granted is
the amount of resources made
to each person."

Program supports Asian American high school students
swarthmorephoenix.com

High School Conversations is funded
by a Swarthmore Foundation grant,
probably for the last time.
The Swarthmore Foundation, created over 20 years ago, awards grants to
students, faculty and staff active in the
field of community service. The focus of
its mission is
"direct service that
addresses the causes and/or consequences of poverty." The endowments
hail from a variety of sources, both from
individuals and other foundations.
The Lang Center of Civic and Social
Responsibility, along with a campus
committee, are the institutions in
charge of the Foundation's manage-

ment.

The grants are to be "seed funds" for
new initiatives. Because the High
School Conversations program has been
running for two years, the organizers
are brainstorming ideas for new
sources of funding, which will be necessary next year.
Layne reapplied for the grant this

High School Conversations brought 40 high school students from Philadelphia to Swarthmore for College Day.

Students from Swarthmore Asian
Organization, in cooperation with
Deshi and Han, brought 40 high school
students from low-income Philadelphia
families to Swarthmore two weeks ago
for College Day, an event designed to
broaden high school students' knowledge about higher education and to
spark a discussion about AsianAmerican issues.
College Day is the first of two components of High School Conversations, a
project initiated by Arthur Chyan 'lO
last year. In the spring, Swarthmore
students will return the visit by conducting workshops and facilitate discussions at the student's school.
Gina Hart 'Ol, an English teacher and
adviser to Bodine's Asian Club, accompanied students from all four grades atboth Bodine and Central High School in

Philadelphia.
"I want the students to see themselves in a place like this, to think: '.I

could go here,'" Hart said.
Even though a few seniors from
Bodine apply to Swarthmore, the program's aim is not to convince them to do
so.
"Swat is an example of a 'high
achieving' liberal arts institution. It is
reflective of other institutions," Chyan
said.
Both Chyan and Vivienne Layne 'll,
who serves as a liaison between SAO
and the high schools, come from public
high schools. They said that there isn't
enough college counseling, especially
when it comes to providing students

with information about selective liberal
arts institutions.
"I think it is important to have intraAsian efforts to help low-income kids
access higher education," Layne said.
Faculty support on the part of the college was offered by former college history professor Sonia Lee and Debra
Kordon-Brown of the Lang Center.
The biggest shock to the organizers
of High School Conversations was that
the majority of the students had never

heard of need-based financial aid, a
topic introduced to them by Director of
Financial Aid Laura Talbot during the
financial aid talk.

"Coming from low-income families,
financial aid is what is the most important for us," said Charimar Valentine,
one of the three seniors applying to
Swarthmore this year. Valentine attended the program.

"We wanted to start off with a safe
topic which everyone can discuss,"
Chyan said.
After starting the conversations,
which developed relationships with
the students, SAO wants to venture on
to discuss Asian-American issues.
While they wanted to create an
identity program, Layne said that the
Lang Center had some objections.
"Identity work requires training," she
said.

They will, however, conduct workshops and sessions for the students
concerning Asian-American history,

racial interactions, discrimination
and representation in the media.
"The students are very curious
about the role of race every day. We
picked up on that last year," Chyan
said.
This interest was reflected in the
discussion at the Diversity Panel
which the students attended, when
they asked questions such as "How
are awkward racial situations in class
are dealt with?"
"We want to create safe and supportive space," Chyan said.
He said that he wants the high
school students to have the possibility
to interact with people who share
their interest and have some insight
and knowledge about Asian American
problems, an opportunity he wished
he would've had in high school.
"APIA [Asian and Pacific Islander
American] student[s] lack Asian
American role models, Asian teachers," said Victoria Pang 'l3, who will
be in charge of the project next semes-

ter.

FROM THE BI-CO NEWS H

Lifelong Haverfordian Kannerstein dies at age 67
BY MICHAEL NOVINSON
BICONEWS.COM, NOV. 25,

2009

Greg Kannerstein '63 died
Tuesday of complications from

mesothelioma, a form of cancer
almost always caused by exposure to asbestos. He was 67.
Kannerstein spent 37 of his
41 years at Haverford as a
dean, 23 years as Athletic
Director and 15 years as head
baseball coach.
He came to Haverford in
1968 as Assistant Dean of
Students, assembled the Class
of 2009 as Acting Dean of
Admissions and served as
Dean of the College from July
2006 to July 2009.
Kannerstein began working
in July as a Special Advisor to

Institutional Advancement and
Lecturer in General Programs
when health issues forced him
to take a medical leave last
month. His illness was diagnosed only weeks ago.
President Dr. Stephen G.
Emerson '74 notified students
and alumni of Kannerstein's
death through an e-mail sent at
10:30 a.m. Wednesday.
"When I saw an email from
'Greg
Haverford
titled
Kannerstein,' my heart sank,"
Jonathan Schwartz '9O wrote in
memory
the
book
on
Kannerstein's memorial webpage,

http://memorialweb-

stein.
announcement
The
of
Kannerstein's death surprised
most students, administrators
and alumni.
"I am in total shock after
reading the e-mail I received,"
Jen Suarez 'O9 wrote in the
memory book. "[Kannerstein]
was a great man and mentor
who was willing to do anything
and everything for us students
at Haverford; even if it meant
taking a pie to the face for a
school event."
Generations of Haverford
students and staff have interacted with Kannerstein, dating
back to Kannerstein's own
days as a student.
"We were roommates in the
'armpit' of Barclay from the
time
we
both
entered
Haverford in fall 1959," Ben
Stavis wrote. "I can't begin to
recount memories, and would
be too embarrassed for both of
us if I tried."
Loren Ghiglione '63 is the
former dean of Northwestern
University's Medill School of
Journalism and worked with
Kannerstein on the editorial
board of The Haverford News.
"It is extremely difficult for
me to accept that Greg is dead,"

humility and never took himself too seriously."
graduating
After
from
Haverford in 1963, Kannerstein
worked briefly as a sportswriter and "rewriteman" at the
Philadelphia Bulletin. He then

returned to the classroom,
earning a master's degree from
Penn in English and folklore
and a doctorate from Harvard
University's Graduate School
of Education, where he wrote
his thesis on the desegregation
of black and white colleges in
several cities. Kannerstein
taught numerous classes at
Haverford throughout his
career.
Current Haverford students
know Kannerstein as the for-

mer Dean of the College, occasional course instructor, and
supporter of everything from
athletic teams to Honor
Council to student journalism
to Quaker life.
"Greg was one of the first
people I met as a freshman,"
Sam Gerstin 'lO wrote. "[He]
called me into his office and
introduced me to a sophomore
cricket player, who convinced
me to come out for the team.
For three-plus years, I would
walking
see [Kannerstein]
around campus, and he would
always notice me and give me a
shout."

Virtually everybody who
has
communicated
with
Kannerstein over the past sev-

eral decades appreciates his
passion for the institution and

all of its students.
"Greg Kannerstein exemplified all that's good about
Segal
Haverford,"
Misha
wrote. "He will willing to suffer fools to see the potential
in streams of knucklehead 1821 year-old student-athletes
like me, despite evidence
(some strong) that would argue
otherwise."
Kannerstein is survived by
his wife Elissa, stepdaughter
Sara Slkaroff Carey, son-in-law
Keven Carey and granddaughter Edie.
There will be no funeral
service. A campus memorial
service is being planned.

Waiting in the 'Swine line'
BY ELIZABETH HELD
BICONEWS.COM, NOV. 24
"They should give us food
when we're in line," joked
Elizabeth Bingham 'lO while
waiting in line for her HINI
vaccine.
Bingham was one of approximately 260 Bryn Mawr students to receive the vaccine at
last Monday's three-hour clinic.
Most students spent about
an hour in the "swine line,"
which began outside Bryn
Mawr's Health Center and
looped out and around outside.
Three nurses administered the
vaccine and volunteers from
the athletic department were
on hand to assist with crowd
control.
According to Dr. Kay Kerr,
the Health Center's Medical
Director, it was necessary to
close the health center for nonemergencies for about an hour
in order "to handle the volume
of students," but it didn't create any serious problems.
Overall,
Health Center
employees were pleased with
the clinic's results.
Jackie Ramsey, Director of
Nursing, described the clinic
(and its long lines) as the "only
way to do mass immuniza-

8

tions."

Mid-way through the clinic
Ramsey said things were going

great.
"It may not be perfect but
it's the best way to get it done."
Kerr too was happy with
how the clinic went.
"The weather cooperated,"
said Kerr in an email interview. "The students were very
good-natured and made things
flow smoothly by bringing the
completed paperwork with
them."
Alyssa Gagne 'll got the
HINI shot because as an asthmatic, she is at high risk for
the flu.
"My mom told me I should
[get the flu shot] because she
doesn't want me to die," said
Gagne.

Clare Mullaney 'll said she
feels getting the vaccine is
worth the risk of much-publicized side effects.
"Most people don't have
adverse
reactions,"
said
Mullaney. "I'd rather have the
shot than the flu."
Other students like Sarah
Jane Allen 'l2 were afraid to
get it because of various fears
about the future.
"I'm paranoid that vaccines
will help cause autism," she
said.

Cami's top film picks Seasonal shopping: Gift
for the winter holidays ideas for family & friends
BY CAMILA RYDER

cryderl@swarthmore.eclu

This holiday movie season features the
usual animated movies,

the feel-good

Christmas tales and a slew of Oscar-worthy films. While there are many movies
that are worth seeing, this is only a short
guide to a few that stand out.
An Education
Sixteen-year-old Jenny (played beautifully by Carey Mulligan), bound for
Oxford, meets the suave and older David
(Peter Sarsgard). Her world of studying,
straight As and playing the cello is now

filled with beautiful clothes, clubs and
trips to Paris. "An Education" is well done
and Mulligan is garnering buzz about
Oscar nods for her performance. Now
playing.

Precious
Based

on the novel "Push" by
Sapphire,. "Precious" follows a teenager,
the title character played by Gabourey
Sidibe, before the birth of her second
child. Precious lives with her abusive
mother (Mo'Nique) but attends an alternative school where her teacher (Paula
Patton) encourages her to read. "Precious"
received awards at Sundance and the
Toronto International Film Festival and
Sidibe, Mo'Nique and Mariah Carey (who
plays Precious' social worker) are receiving rave reviews. Now playing.
The Princess and the Frog

This film features Disney's first black
princess, With the New Orleans Jazz Age
backdrop promising wonderful music
from Randy Newman. The talentedAnika
Noni Rose voices Princess Tiana, who
kisses a frog. Instead of a prince appearing, she herself turns into a frog. Though
geared toward children, this movie has
many elements that would entertain an
adult crowd. Now playing.
The Twilight Saga: New Moon
I would not normally include this, but
since it's a "phenomenon" among certain
girls and their mothers, I decided to put it
on here. See it if you want bad writing, a
sparkly Robert Pattinson and a constantly
constipated-looking Kristen Stewart. Or

see it if you've read the books and IOvE
them! Now playing.

With
finals

The Lovely Bones
After being murdered by her neighbor,
Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) must watch
from heaven as her family and detectives
back home search for her killer.
Grappling with her desire for justice
against her killer and for her family to.
heal, Susie learns to become an adult in
an unfamiliar place. Based on Alice
Sebold's 2002 novel, this film adaptation is
directed by Peter Jackson (of the "Lord of
the Rings" trilogy). Opening December 18.

Avatar

Wheelchair-bound former marine Jake
Sully (Sam Worthington) travels to the
human station in the alien world,

Pandora. A mineral that lies at the center

of Pandora is essential to ending Earth's
energy crisis and the U.S. Army hopes to
overthrow the alien population for the
energy source. With an epic battle
between human and alien, Cameron's
live-action film will entertain action-hungry moviegoers. Opening December 25.
Nine

Inspired by Federico Fellini's "8 Yz,"
"Nine" features a powerhouse of a cast,
including Daniel-Day Lewis, Nicole
Kidman, Marion CotiUard, Kate Hudson
and Sophia Loren. This musical is about
Italian film director Guido Contini (DayLewis), who is trying to put together his
latest movie while dealing with the many
women in his life. Directed by Rob
Marshall, the king of musicals, "Nine"
includes songs from the 1982 play, and
Fergie's version of "Be Italian" in the
trailer is a wonderful preview of the
soundtrack. Opening December 25.

Sherlock Holmes
Directed by Guy Ritchie, "Sherlock
Holmes" stars Robert Downey Jr. as
Holmes, Jude Law as Watson, and Rachel
McAdams as Irene Adler. The story is set
in 1891 and follows Holmes and Watson as
they try to thwart a conspiracy to destroy
England. From the trailer, "Sherlock
Holmes" promises to be fun and visually
exciting, as Ritchie films often are.

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Kevin Kim
Class Year: 2011
From: Los Angeles, CA
Current Residence: Parrish

What He's Wearing:
"A vintage golf cardigan, a shirt from Faconnable, and

S-001 jeans from Uniqlo," Kim said. He is also wearing
Jack Purcell sneakers.
Kim's outfit picks up on the 1950s man's casual look of
the formal cardigan paired with slacks. Though the outfit
is simple, the cardigan is reminiscent of the traditional
collegiate jackets worn in the 40s and 50s. Ralph Lauren,
the epitome of the classic American styles, started the

Rugby collection in 1994. According to the website, Rugby
is where "casual campus style meets downtown prep," and
its selection of men's letterman sweaters and rugby shirts
with personalized patches and embroidery have the same
collegiate aesthetic that Kim's outfit does. His look incorporates the 50s men's style with the up-to-date aspects of
the grey jeans and sneakers.
How He Describes His Style:
"Modern with hints of contemporary," Kim said, clarifying that his interpretation of modern is in reference to
"the period in design and fashion that favored clean lines
and minimalist aesthetics." Kim mixes simple pieces that
combine the American look with chic European style.
This includes creating outfits from American designers
like Ralph Lauren or Brooks Brothers with the European
designs of Burberry, Lacoste and Hugo Boss.
Kim also describes his style as "nouveau fifties collegiate" and adds that he likes to incorporate a new piece to
each outfit. "It may be paring an American Apparel v-neck
with one of my father's old college cardigans or my
turquoise Timex watch with a navy blazer."
Fashion Influences and Inspirations:
"A lot of my stylistic influences have stemmed from my

research into masculinity of the 19505," Kim
said, citing magazines, books and period
movies as providing him with "a sense of the
mid-century modern aesthetic."
Though his focus on the 50s businessman
look may draw comparisons to "Mad Men,"
Kim is more interested in pop culture and
incorporating "aspects of dress attached to certain celebrities." He cites Rock Hudson's way of
wearing his cardigan or Cary Grant's folding of
his pocket squares as inspiring him to "take a
little bit from every leading man of the 50s stage
and compile them into one."
j&[
Where He Shops: .
With a flair for mixing the old with the new,
Kim enjoys shopping at consignment stores in
Philadelphia for vintage designer clothing. "One of
my favorites is Greene Street Consignments on
South Street," he said. "It's not vintage specific, but
if you look hard enough you can find some great
period pieces." For basics, Kim hits up Uniqlo and
American Apparel. "For the small, but necessary
luxuries
I go to Barneys or Neiman-Marcus."
...

Wardrobe Staples:
"A navy blazer and black loafers are timeless and
can be dressed up or down," Kim said. With a penchant
for vintage cardigans, he also likes the combination of
his "perfect, crisp white dress shirt from Calvin Klein"
and his many sweaters.
While clothes are one aspect ofhis style, Kim enjoys
colognes and describes himself as being picky, yet eclectic in his scents. "I try to carefully source my scents to
include those that are unusual... that you can't just pick
up anywhere," Kim said. His old-meets-new style permeates into his cologne choices that include Number Six by
Caswell-Massey, a favorite of George Washington and the
contemporary 2 Man by Comme des Garcons.

his loopy

mono-

logues,
hysterical, tangential interviews (if you

haven't seen his interview with his former bandmate Peter Capaldi, YouTube it
immediately, because it is sublime), and
occasional painful honesty. Today, I
want to talk about something much less
cheerful: the way that the network executives at NBC are doing theirbest to shit
all over their glorious late-night legacy.
I do not object to Conan O'Brien's
takeover of that hallowed institution
The Tonight Show; I have loved Conan
since the days of In The Year 3000 and
the Walker Texas Ranger lever. What I
object to is the way that NBC dangled
The Tonight Show in front ofhis nose for
five years, announcing in 2004 that
O'Brien would be succeeding Jay Leno
as host, then trapped him in the same
spot he had been in, playing backup to
Leno, who now hosts a talk show at 10
p.m. every weeknight. Let me repeat
that. Every. Fucking. Week. Night.

THE PHOENIX

It's not that I object to Leno as a talk
show host (although, for the record,
Newsweek just included him on a list of
"Comedians Who "Aren't Funny"), and
his new show is just a warmed-over
rehash of all the unfunny observational
pabulum that he trafficked in during his
tenure at The Tonight Show. But that's
just my opinion. And the opinion of
almost every respected television critic
in the country. The major problems with
Leno's move to 10 are that poor Conan
(who is infinitely funnier than Jay
watch the sketch where he goes apple
picking with Mr. T if you need proof),
despite the fact that he has inherited
what is arguably the most venerable
institution in the history of television, is
still stuck following Leno; and that Jay's
move has stripped the network of a full
third of its primefime slots, which drastically lowers the chances that new,
quality scripted programming will make
an appearance on the peacock network.
The truly painful thing about this loss
of primetime hours is that some of the
most beloved television of the last 30
years aired in the slot that is now home
to Jay's unfunny rehashing of the day's
news. "E.R." and "Homicide: Life on the
Street," two game-changing shows, aired
at 10 p.m. on NBC, as did that most
beloved and long-running program,
"Law & Order," not to mention its various spinoffs. I don't think it's a coincidence that L&O ratings have drastically
decreased this year, since Jay took over
the series' former time slot.
NBC's insistence on cost cutting has
also cut short the runs of several prom-

ising new series. The critically beloved
police drama "Southland" was axed earlier this year without airing a single
episode of its second season. One of my
personal favorite shows, "Kings," was
cancelled unceremoniously last spring
and left to burn off its remaining
episodes over the summer. It could have
stood a chance to gain a following on the
strength of the writing and acting had
NBC not ousted it for under-performing.

NBC made a great deal of the fact that
Leno's show would be much cheaper to
produce than any scripted drama, which
is true. Leno's move was a perfectly logical step for a network which had long
begun to value money over creativity.
Much was made of the fact that, to break
even, Leno would only have to pull a rating of 15 on the Nielsen charts, much
less than what would be considered even
a modest audience for any scripted show.
The show has been averaging slightly
less than that (around a L 4, according to
CBS News) and advertising prices have
been falling accordlingly; Entertainment
Weekly reported that Leno's thirty-second spot goes for between $40,000 and
$60,000, less than a third of the ad rate for
ABC's "FlashForward" and about half of
the $lOB,OOO commanded by "Heroes," a
show that hasn't been largely watched
since itsfirst season. If NBC is still turning a profit on "The Jay Leno Show," it's
not a large one.
These depressing ratings have led
NBC to seriously rethink their position
on Leno, and industry buzz suggests that
the network may. be considering ending
their brief, failed experiment in prime-

December 3, 2009

time talk shows. There are several ways

they could go about this. The network
could buy Jay's contract and send him
packing. But a much more disturbing
rumor (and one that has been mentioned
by Jay himself) is that NBC will move
Leno back to The Tonight Show, ousting
poor Conan and sending him
well,
Godknows where. It seems unlikely that
Conan would return to Late Night, and
pushing him back to his former time slot
would also break Jimmy Fallon's contract. It's even less likely that Conan
would move to rival network CBS; "The
...

Late Show with David Letterman" is
flush with good ratings as a result of
Dave's recent extortion scandal, and
Craig Ferguson is commanding the best
ratings of his show's history, routinely
beating Jimmy Fallon in the Nielsen
charts. Not to mention that it would be
an unbelievable dick move to deprive
the superior O'Brien of the show that he
had been promised five years before.
If NBC doesn't want to become the
first casualty of the cable revolution
(which seems possible, as Comcast is on
the brink of purchasing NBC Universal),
they need to get their act together and go
back to the strategy that made them
great in the first place: producing strong
scripted television that had the entire
country talking about it the next day. In
short, the NBC suits have to start valuing creativity and intelligence over profit. Without that, NBC will surely come to
embody the description of television as
"a vast wasteland."

Working past Parkinson's to create dizzying art

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ALEX RODRIGUEZ
arodril@swarthmore.edu

If one were to set foot inside the List Gallery on a
chilly afternoon, he or she would leave with the
impression of having embarked upon an abstracted,
ambulatory visual journey through a living, breathing organism
in Technicolor.
From now until Dec, 13, the List Gallery (located on
the first floor of LPAC) is the current home for "Darra
Keeton: 1991-2001, Paintings and Works on Paper."
"Darra Keeton's work has been exhibited throughout the United States, as well as in Germany, England,
and Austria. In the mid 1970s she studied art in New
York and Paris, later receiving an M.F.A. from Queens
College, CUNY, NY."
This information at the gallery entrance provides a
brief yet illuminating back-story for the exhibition.
Keeton, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease
in 2001, uses her art as a means of probing something
beyond her own experience. Her art has gained an
acute sense of insistence, and of movement since her
diagnosis. However, her fascination for representations of various living things manifested itself in her
artwork before she was diagnosed with the disease,
often by illustrating wildly vivid biological functions
and interconnecting cellular systems.
Moving towards the left side of the exhibit, one
comes across an arresting collection of works, all of
them gouache on paper. Gouache is similar to watercolor but more highly pigmented and opaque. This
makes each piece of artwork appear radiant from the
smooth glow of gallery lights casted back from their

surface.
Keeton's particular artistic form uses many deliberate, three-dimensional brushstrokes. Many of the
amorphous shapes featured in Keeton's works maintain their structure through a complex labyrinth of
movement, like a quivering grid. The effect is wonderful and almost dizzying.
Tenuous, undulating lines possess certain stamina,
moving like jellyfish across the surface. Most of these
seem rooted in biology, specifically microscopic
organisms, but the enigmatic shapes are liberating for

Upon exiting the gallery, one should not overlook a

seemed like a "fringe practice"
in the 19505, 60s and 70s, it has
now become part of mainstream
culture.
"Conspiracy has become an
open secret, something people

make movies about and money
off of," Rehak said. Citing political theorist Frederic Jameson,
he added, "any conspiracy you
know about is a bad conspiracy.

A good conspiracy is completely
unknown.”
For the conspiracy wall project, students formed teams and
“prepare[d] for public display a
conspiracy wall that documents
in visual form a conspiracy of
[their] choosing.” They are
given a 40 by 80 inch white canvas to fill with any materials
they see fit
photographs,
newspaper clippings,
ticket
stubs and of course, yarns and
pins to connect the different elements.
—

The students can select a con-

spiracy theory that piques their

interest or come up with a new
theory themselves.
Rehak explained that the idea
for this project came to him even
before the idea for the course. He
recalled a scene in the movie
“The Line of Fire,” with Clint
Eastwood and John Malkovich,
in which the secret service goes
into Malkovich’s apartment and
finds a wall that seems like a
shrine to the JFK assassination.
Since then, Rehak noticed similar happenings in other movies.
“Conspiracy walls are a kind
of trope. They are Hollywood
shorthand for paranoia.” Rehak
sees these conspiracy walls as
conceptually significant because
they provide a picture of a conspirator’s thought process and

put together.
"What I like about [a conspiracy wall] is that it's a way to
visualize people's mind, to show
a person's obsession. It's a psychological collage," Rehak said.
Students took a variety of
approaches to this project. For
example, Noah Lang 'lO and
Justin Hughes 'lO devised their
own conspiracy. According to
them, their project "involves

her more freedom to explore and
express ideas. "This class has
allowed me to take logical liberties. [Here] it's okay that my
explanatory devices are a little
off kilter, because a conspiracy
is in many ways an individual's
cognitive map."
Lang further expressed the
view that the course helped him

view others' theories more charitably. "This class allows you a
unique perspective into a pervasive and infinitely interesting
culture that the majority of culture is quick to dismiss," he
said.

On the
other hand, Lauren Mcßride 'lO
relied largely on pre-existing
conspiracy theories. "My conspiracy wall is mainly concerned with American imperialism and the possibility of brainwashing having a role in the
process," she said.
The students seemed to enjoy
this project and the course as a

Thinking outside the box and into the box office
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY ANNE COLEMAN

acolemal@swarthmore. edu

When it comes to finding the right gifts, it helps to think
outside the box. Every metropolitan area has at least one
theater company and the gift of theater tickets is bound to
surprise any recipient. There's nothing quite like an
evening at the theater to make a person feel sophisticated
and very few gifts are capable of entertaining the giver just
as much as they do the recipient. A little careful research
is all you need to hit the mark.
Ann Arbor, Ml

The Ann Arbor Civic Theater will be presenting the
musical "Nine," the basis for the star-studded film of the
same name which opens on Christmas Day. "Nine" is the
story of a man experiencing a mid-life crisis in the presence of far too many women. Check it out on stage and
decide for yourself if the film translation does it justice.
Boston, MA

The American Repertory Theatre (ART), a heavy-hitter
in the theater world, is staging "Gatz," a re-examination of
the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel "The Great Gatsby." "Gatz" is
not an adapted script, although it is certainly a play: the
script is the complete text of the novel, divided into two
parts to keep performance times down. Chances are that
you know at least- one person who loves "The Great
Gatsby," and the play was exceptionally well received in
New York.
Cleveland, OH
The perfect introduction to musical theatre, "Chicago"
hits the Playhouse Square stage this January, promising to
bring a little flare to your holiday. Fans of Kurt on "Glee"
will get the chance to see the song "Mr. Cellophane" in its
original context and the timeless "All that Jazz" as it was
meant to be done, in the violent, sexy world of the roaring

'2os.
Houston, TX
Houston's Alley Theatre has a world premiere planned
for this January, a musical from the composer behind
"Jekyll and Hyde," titled "Wonderland." It's a revamped
version ofLewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland," in which
Alice is a children's book writer afflicted with writer's
block. This quirky production is intended for all audiences,
so it's a good bet for a family outing.

Los Angeles, CA
The exceptionally unusual "An Oak Tree," produced by
the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, is the sort of show that
keeps people talking for years. Every night,, a different
actor stars across from Tim Crouch, who also wrote the
play. That guest actor shows up never having read the
script, and inevitably ends up telling the same story, the
story of two men who meet by chance and are linked by
tragedy.

New York City, NY
The Signature Theatre Company's 2009-2010 season is
composed of a single, three-part repertory play, Horton
Foote's "The Orphans' Cycle." Segments of the play have
been presented in various formats, but this is the first time
that they have been presented as a whole. New York Times
chief theater critic Ben Brantley '77, notoriously harsh in
his critiques, raved about part one of the cycle, and part
two will open in December. Imagine the excitement of getting-in to see part three when it opens in January, before
the buzz even has time to spread.
New York always has a plethora of shows available, but
two other productions to note are the Atlantic Theater
Company's "Ages of the Moon," a Sam Shepard play starring Irish theater superstars Sean McGinley and Stephen
Rea, and The Roundabout Theatre Company's "Present
Laughter," a Noel Coward crowd pleaser starring Victor
Garber, who once played the role in a well-received performance at Boston's Huntington Theatre.

Philadelphia, PA

Just a few.miles from Swarthmore, the Arden Theatre
is staging "Blue Door," an exploration of one man's relationship with his ancestry and the man- he has become.
This play is a good fit for the Arden's aesthetic and celebrated director Walter Dallas, who will certainly bring a lot
to the work. For a solid, polished taste of local theater,
"Blue Door" is your best bet.

THE PHOENIX

San Francisco, CA
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre is a reliable one at the
cutting edge in the theater world, and those in the know are
more likely to be impressed by the name of the theater than
by the title of the play or playwright. Following a remarkably celebrated production of a Green Day (yes, the band)
musical, Berkeley Rep is offering "Aurelia's Oratorio," a
circus-inspired piece, after which they will present a version of Athol Fugard's "Coming Home." The Wilma
Theatre in Philadelphia staged "Coming Home" earlier this
year, but the production was less than impressive
something which is rarely a problem at Berkeley Rep. In the
heart of San Francisco, the American Conservatory
Theater is presenting a new translation of Jean Racine's
"Phedre." Seana McKenna stars as the ancient Greek
woman caught between herhusband and her illicitlove for
her stepson. "Phedre" is a powerful drama and few actresses are up to the challenge, but McKenna is one of the few
who seems to have the mettle to meet the challenge.
Seattle, WA
The Seattle Shakespeare Company is presenting
"Electra," the tragedy of the daughter of Agamemnon and
Clytemnestra, a character who appears in Aeschylus'
"Oresteia," (to be produced by the Swarthmore Theatre

Department this spring as the directing thesis of Louis
Jargow 10) in addition to serving the eponymous character
in plays by Euripides, Sophocles and many more. If you
enjoy a good classic, "Electra" is an excellent option.
Washington D.C.
Earlier this semester, Drama Board produced "Outrage,"
a play by up-and-comer Itamar Moses. Washington's Theater
J is presenting another Moses play this winter—"The Four

of Us."
Moses has a very distinctive narrative structure and
style of speech, so if you enjoyed "Outrage," "TheFour ofUs"
will be a good match for you and the recipient of your gift.
Philadelphia-based director Aaron Posner will be working
for the Folger Elizabethan Theatre in his llfh time directing
for them, this time on "Orestes, A Tragic Romp." Greek
myths seem to be popular this holiday season, but this modernization is certain to overturn your expectations for the
genre.
If your city or state didn't make the list, look for your
local theater alliance. Most metropolitan areas have some
sort of non-profit organization that supports the local theater
community. Those organizations can tip you off to theaters
in your area that you may not know and oftenhave a sched-

ule of current area productions online.

In 1999, Chris Baty, a San Francisco
Bay Area journalist, thought it might
be fun to write a novel in a month. He
called his project NaNoWriMo
(National Novel Writing Month), and 21
people participated, each writing his or
her own novel. The next year, the number of participants grew, and the year
after that it grew again, and soon, due
in part to bloggers and internet communities, NaNoWriMo became a phe-

nomenon.
This year, NaNoWriMo had over
170,000 participants, some of whom are
students at Swarthmore. One such
writer was Jean Dahlquist 11, who
wrote 25,000 words in November 2008,
'&t great sacrifice to my academics."
This year, Dahlquist wrote a sequel,
which she said was about "post-apocalyptic police people with cyborgs and
motorcycles."
Dahlquist

is a member of
Swarthmore's Writing Club, which
meets for four hours every Saturday i
nthe Kohlberg Coffee Bar. All but two of
the Writing Club members at least
attempted NaNoWriMo.
"I've never actually done it," Lucas
Hinojosa 'l2, another Writing Club
member, said. "I came the closest this
year. I actually started a story."
Hinojosa said that there wasn't a point
at which he gave up on NaNoWriMo,
Rather, he decided he would just write
for fun, "which is what it is anyway,"
he said. The project served mainly as a
challenge and a motivator, and
Hinojosa will continue to write his
novel even though NaNoWriMo is over.
"[I like to think that] I just accidentally
hit the deadline without completing it,"
he said, laughing.
Self-described as "thirty days and

thirty nights of literary abandon," the
goal of NaNoWriMo is to write 50,000
words (think "The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy" or "The Great Gatsby:"
slender, but substantial) during the
"to more fully
month of November
take advantage of the miserable weather," according to its creator, Baty.
Of course, with time being so short,

no one expects much of these novels in
terms of quality, but that isn't the point.
Writing a novel is so daunting that it is
often difficult to act on one's vague
desire, and so the point of NaNoWriMo
is to force participants to actually take
the plunge.
According to the NaNoWriMo website, "The kamikaze approach forces
you to lower your expectations [and]
take risks." By silencing one's inner
critic, one is able to pour all one's energy into creation.
When one is allowed to make mistakes, the process of writing a novel
becomes entirely driven by the joy of
writing. And, of course, the 50,000-word
mark. No prizes are given out and no
one besides the writer needs to see the
novel. Anyone who writes 50,000 words
by midnight on November 30th is
declared a winner.
NaNoWriMo allows its participants
to register on its website, create a profile, and post in the forums. These
forums are extremely active, ensuring
a sense of community. After all, the
point of doing this during November,
specifically, is that lots of other people
will do it with you.
However, this month might not be
ideal for Swarthmore students who are
already in the thick of preparing for
finals. Dahlquist called the choice of
month "God-awful. Who came up with
that?" November, she asserted, was
impossible. "I don't have that kind of
time."

Staff Editorial

Students take charge and reverse retro-activism
Starting tomorrow, the Board of Managers will be
meeting for two days to decide whether to adopt the budget cuts proposed by the Ad Hoc Financial Planning Group
on Nov. 13. Yet another unfortunate byproduct of the economic downturn, the proposal details $6.85 million in cuts
for the 2010-2011 school year, with an emphasis on "shared
sacrifice" across all departments.
As mentioned whenthe original news story ran in The
Phoenix on Nov. 19, however, there are students who
express reservations over the nature of this shared sacrifice. Of primary concern is the recommended 21 percent
reduction ($457,000) to financial aid. There are worries
that the college may need to temper that reputation by
increasing expected weekly hours for campus jobs,
increasing expected summer earnings, or reintroducing

loans.
There is no denying that economic realities do require
difficult decisions. Nevertheless, for many in the student
body, there is something inherently distressing about the
honors programs evading shared sacrifice while financial
aid, the key to many students' Swarthmore experience,
will likely be cut.
These are legitimate concerns, and they are ones that
every student, whether on financial aid or not, has the
right to voice.

It is impossible to overlook the efforts Student Council
has made to engage the student body in the shaping of the
budget cuts. The Student Financial Advisory Panel, or
SFAP, was created to liaise between the ad-hoc committee
and the student body, and StuCo have hosted a number of
events both jointly and separately to allow students to
voice their concerns. This openness represents unprecedented community input into the budget process.
In fact, the level of enthusiasm displayed by the student body at large in making our voices heard during this
decision process seems to buck a trend of what can only
be called "retro-activism": the well-chronicled tendency of
student movements to be reactive rather than proactive.
It is an undeniably positive sign that, at least with
regards to the budget cuts, students have felt sufficiently
motivated enough to try and affect policy direction—with
good reason, of course. StuCo and SFAP deserve commendation for their strenuous efforts to engage the student body with town-hall meetings and panels.
The election process for StuCo itself, too, seems to be
reserving retro-activism this semester. Unlike last semester, almost every position is a contested one.
Last semester, of course, bore witness to the failed
NOTA campaign, where certain factions of the student
body were dissatisfied with their StuCo candidates and

pushed for voters to select the None of the Above option
on the ballot. The campaign was retro-activism at its
finest: activists choosing to act only when a blatantly
available opportunity has passed them by (in this case,
the so-called activists apparently forgot that StuCo positions are open to the entire student body).
Observant readers will note that, this semester, a large
proportion of the candidates are from the IC/BCC community. This is hardly a coincidence. This is the byproduct of the various IC/BCC groups doing what should
absolutely happen more often: taking the initiative to
ensure their representation.
Sustainability of initiatives, of course, is always something to be wary about. The truth is that we as a student
body find it easy to ignore StuCo's attempts to engage us,
and we find it even easier to raise our heads and voices
only when we see something we do not like. But that is not
sustainable activism. That is retro-activism at its worst,
and it is something we are all very good at.
It is also something that, in light of the developments
of the budget discussion and StuCo elections, we appear to
be reversing.
Power, after all, is not finding the means to respond
after the fact. Power is finding the means to confront an
issue, in a way that is both sustainable and thoughtful.

societies achieve success. The surest way
for any society to raise the living standards
for all is with capitalism and an appropriately limited government.
Then, within an equal capitalist society,
success comes to those who are diligent,
honorable and rational. Individuals find
their buying power in their own ability to
produce; their supplying power. So the
value of the money workers earn is then
deeply rooted within their experience of
earning it.
Studying at Swarthmore isn't so different. We succeed by working hard with
integrity and maintaining some sense of
rationality. Most of the time, good grades
don't wander onto our transcripts unless
we workhard. And within the good grades
we receive lives our experience of earning
them. But this finals period, like any other,
will be tough. It seems that until we've

professors should commend our achievements. In the words ofLuke 6:38, "Give and

those in Europe, seem to resist capitalism.
Why?
Lucky for us, there's a bunch of economics literature on this topic. (Don't
worry, this time, I promise not to "misuse
the discipline of economics.") Consider the
characteristics of European economies. In
Europe, taxes are higher, governments are
bigger, and labor unions are much more
active. In essence, Europeans want a government that serves as a sort of insurance
policy against risks that invariably arise in
a dynamic global economy.
But after Europeans had their little
laugh about the perils of an "unregulated"
American economy, they observed the
even greater risks of maintaining a mostly
static economy in an ever-changing world.
Economists at ÜBS recently reported in the
Wall Street Journal that productivity is
expected to fall L 4 percent in Europe while
it should expand by 2.3 percent in the U.S.
The European Central Bank is also worried. It seems Europaeans didn't read the
fine print on their insurance policy.
On the other hand, labor regulations
and government unemployment benefits
keep workers optimistic. For example,
German mechanic Alfred Butt lost his job
in the recession, but unemployment benefits left him and his wife feeling financially

according the Wall Street Journal.
Beyond anecdotes, however, Germany's efforts to
maintain labor supply will
prove effective only if the

sure many unemployed Americans are
heading off to the Florida Keys this year.
So the question is, why did countries in
Europe become large welfare states when
the U.S. became a mostly free-market economy?
In a 2001 Brookings Paper, Alesina,

Glaeser & Sacerdote offer an answer. The
economists contend that it is social perceptions of luck that make all the difference.
Does luck determine success? Fifty-four
percent of Europeans think so, while only
30 percent of Americans do. Ask 100
Americans if they think the poor are lazy,
and 60 will say yes. Only 23 out of 100
Europeans say yes.
The economists suggest that these
results could imply real underlying trends.
For example, in the United States there is a
strong positive correlation between earnings and the number of hours worked.
People who work more, make more. This is
true for full-time workers as well. These
trends don't hold in Europe, though. In
fact, in Switzerland and Italy, rich people
actually work less than poor people!
Alesina et al. then summarize their
findings showing the relationship between
social attitudes about luck and social
spending (welfare, unemployment benefits,
etc.) as a percent of GDP. Indeed, countries
whose citizens believe luck determines
income spend lots on social programs. But

in countries whose citizens believe, laziness causes poverty, the welfare state is
small. It turns out that America doesn't
have Europe's welfare state because
Americans believe that industriousness,
not luck, brings success.
So while our friends at Oxford may
"bop" at the bars and our amigos in Spain
drink wine in the afternoons, at
Swarthmore College, it's a bit more serious. Working hard just works. Although it
may be tense, Calculus students, serious

success so great it cannot be spanned by a

Help each other out. Remember that
what's good for our classmates is generally
us. As David Hume puts it in "Of Jealousy
and Trade," "I shall therefore venture to
acknowledge, that, not only as a man, but
as a British subject, I pray for the flourishing commerce of Germany, Spain, Italy and
even France itself. I am at least certain that
all nations would flourish more [with] such
enlarged and benevolent sympathies
toward each other." Indeed, there exist a
mutuality of gains. When our classmates
learn more, we generally learn more too.
And with the power of the Bible, I end

Student Council Platforms

MEET the

can didates

Below are the platforms for the spring 2010 Student Council elections. The open positions are: vice president, campus life representative, student events advisor, appointments chair and secretary.

Voting will take place Friday, Dec. 4 through Monday, Dec. 7.

For campus life representative:
Ariel Finegold 'l3
My name is Ariel Finegold and I am very interested in becoming your Campus Life
Representative. I have boundless energy, a strong need to communicate with people and I have not
yet had an outlet to apply my skills. I feel very strongly about positive social change on
Swarthmore's campus through the democratic process by representing the voice of all Swatties. I
want to become committed to helping any and all members of our student body to actualize their
vision for relevant changes that will benefit the entire Swat community.
I have had experience in working with individuals and communities to accomplish goals and satisfy needs. Currently, I am working as assistant to the Education Program Coordinator at the Scott
Arboretum where one of my duties is communicating event information to volunteers. For two summers before entering Swarthmore, I interned in Pennsylvania State Representative Michael
Gerber's constituents' service office where I interacted with constituents from the community who
came to the office for help. I assisted a low-income mother fde the necessary forms to open a day
care, personally contacted elderly World War n veterans or their surviving spouses to assure they
received awards of recognitions for their service to their country and provided constituents with
information ranging from college funding to consumer protection.
In addition to dedicating my efforts to reaching out to Swatties to ascertain their concerns and
inspirations to improve the student life on campus, I also want to contribute my own ideas to a
dynamic, collaborative coalition that is Student Council. I would like to set up an official online system to input complaints and recommendations from students so that Student Council can review
and determine which proposals are most feasible to execute. As a student council member, I will be
willing to not only set up this system, but also collate the feedback comments and present them at
meetings.

I am eager to serve my Swat peers by being an outstanding listener to the pulse of public opinion
within our community and acting on your needs with my full conviction.
Respectfully,
Ariel Finegold

Watufani Mtafuta-Ukweli Poe 'l3
Hey Swarthmore Student Body!
My name is Watufani Mtafuta-Ukweli Poe, and I would like to represent you on Student Council as your Campus Life Representative. Let
me start by saying I love the Swarthmore Community. If I've already
had the pleasure to meet you, you know that I greet you all with a beaming smile and rambunctious laughter. One thing that strikes me about
the Swarthmore community is that we're concerned about the issues
on campus. You and I care about our fellow Swatties, and their wellbeing. Iwant to be able to act as a liaison between all student communities on campus and the administration and want the community to
tell me the issues they are concerned about, so that I can take it to
Student Council and we can make change together.
In today's dismal economy, I am especially worried about how budget cuts will impact student life on campus. Being a student heavily dependent on financial aid, I
know how much is at stake if things like financial aid are cut from the budget. I believe in the importance of financial aid for keeping a diverse student body
which contributes to the academic culture and rigor of the institution and the strong student, culture on campus. Diversity is integral to
the Swarthmore Experience, which is why we are one of the most diverse liberal arts colleges in the
country. I understand the grave importance in keeping Swarthmore diverse and keeping our financial aid program strong, despite any budget cuts.
Another issue that's important to me is campus safety. With the recent trashing of the
Swarthmore Queer Union room in the beginning of the semester, I know that protecting our student
body and our student cultural groups is more important than ever. I am a huge fan of our campus
being open to the outside community, and our cultural buildings like the IC and BCC being open at
most all times, but safety and security of our campus must be secure if that is the case.
As Campus Life Representative I would brainstorm new ways of hearing, representing and maintaining Swarthmore. I would work towards making a drop box where students can submit comments about Student Council, the administration and events on campus can be heard and reviewed
by Student Council. Currently there are teacher and course evaluations that allow students to
express their opinions about their academic life; however, I would also like to see our advisors and
deans more accountable to students. As Campus Life Representative I would like to have evaluations
for academic advisors, administrators and institutional programs, like Worth Health Center, Dining
Services, CAPS and Career Services.
Finally, I believe that students often have creative solutions to major issues on campus, I like to
host open forums where students can respond to and collectively brainstorm about solutionsto campus issues.
All Swatties, whether we have met yet or not, know that you have a friend in me. If you elect me
I will do my best to serve as your link to our Student Council.
Smiling Brightly,
Watufani Mtafuta-Ukweli Poe

For student events advisor:

Luis Penate 'l3
My name is Luis Penate and I am running to represent you in
Student Council as the Student Events Advisor. Student Events Advisor
is a position that takes a lot initiative, planning events that represent
the interests of the student body—this means that I must be in touch
with the needs and desires of a diverse student population. I have a
relentless commitment to have everyone's voice heard, no matter how
arduous and long the process may take. By no means does that make me
indecisive; rather, it makes me a fair decision maker. Moreover, as a
member of various groups that have hosted events on campus, I have an
excellent idea of how things work here at Swat; I've successfully applied
for and received funding from SAC and know how to plan and advertise
a well-attended event. Both my commitment to representing student
needs and my experience as a member of various campus groups makes
me excited to run for Student Events Advisor.
As the Student Events Advisor, I would like to bring Student
Council's voice into the planning of campus-wide events such as Class
Awareness month, APIA month, Black History month—and Women's
History Month—which at Swarthmore is often not planned or celebrated. I believe that these major campus-wide events need the support of
student council to promote attendance and funding. I would also like to
create a stronger connection between StuCo and various groups on campus, so that StuCo can play a more active supporting role in the events
those groups choose to hold. I will also try to increase student attendance to each event, which is especially important this year given
Swarthmore's limited budget. In that same vein, I think it would be
helpful to create a position or have a student liaison to strengthen the
relationship between the academic departments and the student body,
so that departmental events can be well-attended, and more student
events can have support from departments. I also believe that the best
way for StuCo to cater to the needs of the student body is to host multiple events to respond to incidents that happen on campus, such as the
vandalism of the SQU room and concerns and debates that happened
around issues of safety on campus last year that happened earlier this
year.
Another issue that is very important to me is to increase the amount
of students who try to host events, as this will create a greater diversity of events that can help to educate and increase the amount of FUN on
campus. Another one of my projects would be to increase the amount of
advertisement for tri-co events so that Swarthmore students can utilize
the resources of the other schools in our consortium. I also want to
make sure that money is not cut so that students keep the same amount
and frequency of events.
As a member of StuCo, I would like to push for a more active student
role in budget cuts so that these cuts don't affect students' financial aid,
along with other programs that benefit student experiences. As stated
before, I would also like Student Council as a whole to have a student
response to events that happen on campus, keeping the student body
better informed.
Sincerely,

Luis Penate

For secretary:
Daniel Pak 'l2
Hi fellow Swatties,
I'm Daniel Pak 'l2, and I am running for
Secretary on the Student Council. In addition to being known as a very diligent and
organized student among friends, peers
and professors (just look at my organic
chemistry notecards and Post-Its), I believe
that my involvement in student organizations and scientific research in the past
one and a half years at Swarthmore also
makes me qualified to be StuCo secretary.
Last year, I was treasurer of Global
Neighbors, a student organization that works towards eliminating discrimination against communities with physical and mental disabilities.
As treasurer, I gained experience with SBC's operations and created
and presented a budget for Global Neighbors at Spring Budgeting. In
addition, as staff Director of Development of Global Health Forum, I
researched and examined the advantages and disadvantages of gaining
nonprofit status for a college organization. As Director of Development
of GHF and treasurer of GN, I have gained much experience and knowledge in how a Board of an organization can effectively function.

For secretary, continued:
DANIEL PAK, continued from p. 18
I was also a Dare2Soar Tutor and attended several leadership conferences, including the GROW:
Grassroots Organizing Weekend and the 2nd Annual
Student
Service Leaders
Conference
in
Philadelphia. I also have much experience with the
music department and music organizations. I have
received piano lessons through Music 48, participated in chamber music and chorus, and have taken
several music courses. I mention these experiences
in music, because I realize the importance of music
in the lives of many Swatties and want to start
Council initiatives that would allow students to
enjoy a better musical experience (such as tuning
the pianos).
And lastly, this past summer at the University of
Washington, because I am a prospective biology/biochemistry major, I created and conducted a research
project that involved introducing mutations to the
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus. This internship required me to be extremely organized in
designing experiments and protocols and in troubleshooting when I did not get the desired results.
My experience with research and my involvement
in student organizations and activities have given
me valuable skills to not simply be a secretary that
takes minutes but to be an “active” secretary.
The Swarthmore student body deserves to be
more aware of the workings, ideas, and initiatives of
Student Council, campus groups and the administration. Instead of being a typical secretary who
types meeting minutes and posts them online, I will
be an “active” secretary. By this, I mean a secretary
who not only takes notes at the Council meetings but
presents the ideas and suggestions of the student
body to the Council and the administration to
improve the Swarthmore experience. The secretary
also has the responsibility of being an advocate and
spokesperson for Council initiatives. As secretary, I
will meet with the Board of at least one student
group or organization a week to share and discuss
Council initiatives and propositions and bring back
student ideas, comments, and opinions to Council
meetings. Although this proposal may overlap with
other responsibilities of members on Student
Council, I believe that the more people on the
Council interacting with groups on campus, the better. I want to do away with the note-taking secretary
Hilary Pomerantz 'l2
My name is Hilary
Pomerantz and I am
running for Student
Secretary.
Council
Serving in this position, I will not only
take weekly meeting

minutes and post them
on the Student Council
blog in a timely manner, but I will also
work to make Student
Council more accountable to the campus at large. As
Secretary, I will advocate that the group act as a
mediating body between Swarthmore's administration, student-run organizations, and the larger student population. When incidents happen on campus
that affect student safety or student groups, I will fulfill my duties of publicity and outreach by informing
the student body. I believe that in many cases there
is no neutralposition to take, and that Swatties have
much to gain from Council's ready access to the
administration. I would also push student-run
organizations, such as SAC and SBC, as well as committees to have more accountability on campus, by
encouraging them to publish their own minutes and
inform the student body of their decisions.
My inspiration for running comes from taking
part in Student Councils' recent efforts to reach out
to students about the college's budget cuts. Having
taken part in the recent budget cut talks that Student
Council has sponsored, I have witnessed the opportunity that Student Council can offer the student
voice in decisions that affect our lives and experiences at Swarthmore. As Student Council Secretary,
I will push to make sure that students continue to
have a say in the coming Budget Cut decisions, by

For appointments chair:
and expand my responsibilities to be a connection
and communicator between the Student Council and
the Swarthmore student body.
As secretary, I will work diligently towards the

following goals:
1) Meet with at least one student group or organization a week to express and advocate student council ideas and initiatives and gain feedback.
2) Communicate with
the Swarthmore
Webmaster to introduce a Student Council "box" on

the Student Dashboard. This StuCo box would contain links to meeting notes for the past month and
StuCo announcements, much like the Sharpies box
on the Dashboard. Because many students have the
Dashboard as their homepage or use it on a daily
basis, advertising minutes and StuCo initiatives on
the Dashboard would be a great way to help students
be aware quickly.
3) Continue the idea of a secretary blog (started
by current secretary Stephen Lefebvre) to provide a
more complete picture ofStuCo minutes and initiatives and have a link available to it in the StuCo box
on the Student Dashboard
4) Print meeting minutes weekly or bimonthly
and have them available to be picked up by students
at Shane Lounge, Kohlberg and the Science Center
commons, where the New York Times and the
Phoenix are placed. When students pick up the New
York Times on the way to class, dorm, Sharpies, anywhere, they can also pick up a copy of the week's
StuCo minutes!
5) Advocate putting the StuCo webpage as a
shortcut/bookmark on student browsers (for example, during Freshman Orientation) and communicate with ITS to place a shortcut/bookmark on all
public browsers on campus.
6) Place a permanent link to StuCo minutes on
the Reserved Students Digest
I present these ideas with the goal of getting the
Swarthmore student body more connected with the
ideas and initiatives of Student Council and the
administration. These ideas may be a bit "in your
face," but I believe that they can be the start to creating a Swarthmore that is more aware and proactive in contributing its opinions and ideas. Please
give me the opportunity to be more than just a notetaking secretary. Feel free to contact me at
dpak2@swarthmore.edu if you have any questions
about my proposals. Thank you!
encouraging and helping Student Council to host
more open discussions and panels with members of
the administration and reaching out to students to
get them involved in this decision making process.
Students have repeatedly expressed that they do not
want budget cuts to affect financial aid and I will
push fellow Council members to put the full weight
of the group behind this issue. Additionally, I will
continuously seek input from the Swarthmore community so I can act on and express students' concerns during Student Council meetings and to the

administration.
In my past year and a half at Swarthmore, I have
had lots of experience taking meeting minutes and
keeping institutional memory for groups such as
Swarthmore's IC/BCC Coalition. In addition to serving as the minute taker at Student Council's meetings, the Student Council Secretary also submits
Budget Proposals to SBC for Student Council.
Through my work as Treasurer for Class Awareness
Month, as a planning member of Swarthmore's
Sager Symposium and Coming Out Week, and as a
member of the Swarthmore Queer Union (SQJJ), I
have had extensive experience with submitting proposals for funding and working with SBC.
Additionally as a part of these groups, I have
planned and run many events on campus such as
this year's Coming Out Week: "Coming Out Live"
spoken word and hip hop event, last year's Sager
Symposium: "Intersections of Queer: CoalitionBuilding Across Our Communities," and this year I
facilitated the Class Awareness Month student panel
"Class Experiences at Swarthmore." From these
experiences, I have gained lots of useful information
about running groups and events on campus that
will inform my work on Student Council and I will
use my position as Secretary to pass on useful information to students and student groups.

Philmoii Haile 'l3
Hey, I am running for Appointments Chair, if I were to be
elected I would try to bring more connection between our
council with the neighboring community. One of my passions is education, so I would try incorporating more underrepresented cultures in on campus events. As appointments
chair, I will try to hard to advertise committees to people
who are underrepresented on Swat committees. I would do
this by posting fliers and hold info events in the BCC and
ICC so students of color, who historically have been underrepresented on committees, will have the opportunity to
learn more about the committees and how to serve on one.
Some things that I personally support are using funding to
create programs where we could expand more into the
neighboring community and teach not only the college but
also neighboring community about important issues. Some
ideas that I had were we could have more students from
Swat go into Chester and mentor underprivileged students
ofcolor (students traditionally not applying to college) helping them to apply to college, and get them more involved in
the greater community.
I not only have ideas, but I also have experience with
working on student council. In high school I was treasurer
of the African-American Scholars club, with that I learned
many skills of handling the budget of a club, coordinating
meeting, and working well with faculty. Also over this last
summer I volunteered as a Mandarin Chinese teacher for
underprivileged students ofcolor at Seattle University. This
helped me greatly in improving my communication skills
and also having to lead a class improved my leadership abilities. I also have another year of experience in a leadership
role, when I was in House congressional page program (a
program where I lived in DC and worked on the house floor
with my congressman). In my first semester, I was elected
the chair of the Volunteer Committee while in DC. My roles
included finding and organizing volunteer trips for the
entire page class to attend. This gave me insight into what
it took to chair a committee, and improved my listening and
communication skills. In the second semester, I was elected
treasurer and chair of the finance committee. My responsibilities were conducting the finance committee meetings,
running the student store (handling the budget also), managing funds for class T-shirts and prom. From this I learned
a lot how to be an effective leader within group, and how to
organize large projects.
I now currently serve on the Student Advisory
Committee to the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid.
This position has really given insight how into how admissions and financial aid works at Swat. Additionally, applying to be on Student Advisory Committee to the Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid has given insight in to the

committee member selection process, form the candidate's

point of view. This experience will help me in making better

decisions.
Other campus positions are I am now the treasurer of
ABLLE (an African-American/ Latino leadership group); I
and the other treasurer in the group represent this group at
SBC meetings and help to manage funds allocated to the
group. I am also the Public Relations intern for Global
Neighbors (social action/volunteer group on campus), my
roles are organizing and publicizing campus events. I also
talk to the member of the greater community about our
group. All these experiences and a long history of employment have taught me responsibility and time management.
I have two main goals. One is self-growth; I hope to grow
more as a leader and a responsible student. The other is to
serve Swarthmore by providing education about global
awareness and more cultures.
I also have spent two years away from home, and one was
aboard studying in China and went to school in Chinese.
This experience away from home helped build my sense of
independence and maturity. I can speak two foreign languages fluently, Mandarin Chinese and Tigrinya (an East
African language), these skills can help the student council
to branch out to other communities and help us to be more
impactful in the community.
As a member of student council I will make sure that the
decisions being made by the council are not closed dialogues, I will listen to ideas of my classmates to ensure that
every decision made by the council is conversation between
the students of Swat and the council. You can count on me
to be dedicated, hard working, and give 100 percent to the
Swat.
Thank you for reading my platform I really appreciate
your consideration. (I know this was a little long; if you
have any questions please email me at phaileL)
Thank you,
Philmon Haile

Appointments chair, continued:
Sonja Nicole Spoo 'l3
Hello, my name is Sonja Nicole Spoo and I am running to be the
Student Council Appointments Chair. In my short time at
Swarthmore, I have been inspired by the passion, heart and true
love of life and learning displayed by all of you students here.
Everyone at Swarthmore has a say and a vote in what goes on in
the school. Student government plays an integral part in presenting
and advocating that voice to the administration and to the student
body as a whole. While Student Council has done an excellent job
so far in representing the student body, there's still room for
improvement.

Position Duties:
The main job of the chair is to fill committee seats and organize
new committees. Thus, the chair must be in contact with the committee heads and deans on a constant basis. The chair also interviews candidates for positions, reads applications, and updates the
website during appointments time. Last but not least, the chair is a
liaison between the student council and the committees.

Qualifications:

Through my past experience with leadership in high school and
my community, I have acquired many of the essential skills necessary for the position and am the ideal candidate for the position. In
high school, I served on the Mayor's Youth Advisory Commission
in my city. I was in charge of producing and anchoring the city's
teen news program as well as being a voice between the Mayor of
my city and the youth. On the news program, I had to be able to
multitask and organize well in orderfor the show to function properly. This included scheduling interviews, setting up the studio and
prepping the other hosts. One important aspect of my job was interviewing teens, government officialsand everyday citizens on issues
pertinent to the community. The skills I learned from these interviews will be of particular use for the Appointments Chair since
interviewing potential committee candidates is a large part of the
position. I also served on student council at my school and was the
president of several clubs and organizations including National
Honor Society, Mock Trial, and Speech and Debate.
At Swarthmore, I serve on the Admissions and Financial Aid
Committee. Being on this committee has given me real insight to
the inner-workings of admissions and the school itself.
Additionally, it has given me the experience of the committee selection process from a candidates prospective which I think is a crucial perspective to have as Appointments Chair.
Proposals:
*The issues discussed in committees are important and affect
the whole student body. However, there is currently no outlet for
this information or an interplay between the committtees and the
student body. As Appointments Chair, I would work to see thatthis
changes immediately. One way to do this would be to increase the

interaction between Student Counciland the committees outside of
appointments time. Each committee would have a secretary to
record the minutes of the meetings and the important points on
budgeting, etc. While many students know of committees such as
DAC or Admissions, they are unaware of the nature and extent of
their work or of the decison making progress. I propose creating a
section of the student council website dedicated to the committees
and their minutes and decisions. In this way students can know
what, for example, exactly DAC is considering. The Gazette covers
some of the committee meetings, but overall, the committees are in
the background of student life. I would like to help change this.
*While committees are an important and powerful part of campus life, they are not well publicized and many people do not know
how or what the committees do, or how to get on a committee. To
fix this problem, I propose that as Appointments Chair, I would
work in tandem with the Campus Life Representative to get out the
word on the committees and vacancies. This could include posting
fliers, holding forums, sending emails, chalking etc. My goal is to
make the committee selection process more open and competitive
so that way everyone can be fully and equally represented if they so
choose.
*As Appointments Chair, I would be sure to post the new committee members in the Gazette, Phoenix and on the Student Council
website. Students would be able to contact the committee members
with their concerns,comments and suggestions.
If elected to be Appointments Chair, I will work to the fullest of
my abilities to see that these goals are accomplished. As with all
things, I will need the student body's help and support. When these
proposals go into action, it will be the students responsibility to be
interactive with the committees. I will work to make sure students
have all the resources and knowledge they need to make inform
decisions and take firm stances.
Although I am a freshman, I understand the great responsibility
that comes with this position. The great thing about Swarthmore is
that no matter what class you are, you are able to have a voice and
be involved. Not only will I advocate for freshmen, but for upperclassmen as well. If elected, I will make Student Council and the
committees more interactive with each other and the student body.
I hope to have the pleasure of serving our wonderful community. Thank you for your timeand consideration!

For vice president:
Ambar Mariela La

Forgia 'll

Dear
Fellow
Students,
For the past year I
have had the wonderful experience of being
one of your Campus
Life Representatives.
In this position I have
been able to help with
Student Council outreach and transparency, as well as my
favorite, publicity! Over the course of my term, the
members of StuCo became very close, leading to
excellent teamwork and making StuCo an integral
part of my Swarthmore experience.
I have decided to run for Vice President because I
have the experience and the passion for Student
Council necessary for this position.
Unlike other StuCo positions, the President and
Vice President have much more demanding responsibilities such as attending regular meetings with the
Dean ofStudents and Presidentof the College, as well
as the privilege of being an observer at the Board of
Managers' meetings. The Vice President is also the
constitutional expert and in charge of the elections
process.
I feel I am uniquely qualified to meet these
demands.
I have worked closely with the current VP Nate
Erskine for the past year, so I have first handknowledge of what the job will be like. As an RA and exSAM I am very comfortable communicating with the

administration. I have put a lot of effort into publicizing the elections and would love to be in charge of
the process! And though I'm no constitutional expert

Deivid Rojas 'll
My name is Deivid
Rojas and I want to be
your
next Student
Council Vice-President.
As you are probably
aware, our college is
going through a critical
time period. No budget
cut, whether big or
small, is an easy experience. As such, our voices cannot be silent, but
rather loud enough for the administration to hear. As
students we will be affected directly and indirectly by
the proposed budget cuts. We are in charge of ensuring
that Swarthmore, as a responsible academic institution, makes decisions which engender sustainability
in levels offinancial aid, that will allow for all current
Swatties and future Swatties to equally enjoy and
access Swarthmore. As your Vice-President I plan to
facilitate and expand this discussion process, so that
your ideas and opinions are integral factors to the
decisions made by the administration.
Efforts have been made recently to do just that,
opening the possibility for a new wave of student participation. And so, it will be the charge of this student
council to take the next step forward and embody the
movement as its main source of power. As VicePresident, for example, I will call upon the leaders of
student groups, to incorporate the budget cuts into
their agenda and develop a consensus of ideas regarding where and how the cuts should be made. These
conversations will develop into an agreement between
the students and the administration as to which budgets must be conserved and how the groups can be
more fiscally responsible. Ultimately, I would like to
enable a consensual effort in which communication
flows freely between all bodies and that all decisions
are understood before they are made.
This plan necessitates a more activist stance on the
issues, an effort already initiated by the current
Council. This is apparent for instance by their involvement in creating the Student Financial Advisory
Committee, which the Vice-President is part of. As
Vice-President I will continue to take this approach
and even take it a step further by promoting an
increase in student participation. Student Council is
December 3, 2009

yet, my meticulous scheduling and planning skills
will have me knowledgeable in no time.
Besides meeting my administrative responsibilities, if elected Vice President, these are the goals I
wish to accomplish:
I promise to initiate regular meetings between
Student Council and student group leaders. As elected representatives, I feel it is our responsibility to get
input from the leaders of the ICC/BCC communities,
religious groups, environmental groups and any
other interested group in order to maintain StuCo as
informed as possible on the needs and concerns of
Swarthmore students.
I promise to make Student Council a more active
student voice. StuCo is criticized for being too neutral on controversial topics, and though we do need
to maintain some neutrality as we represent all the
student body, it is also our responsibility to actively
support or oppose administrative decisions.
I promise to continue my work on publicity by
helping to popularize StuCo's Facebook page as well
as our website. I want to make sure we are able to
communicate our goals and accomplishments as
they are happening, without spamming of course.
On a more specific note, I really want to improve
life for students with food allergies and diabetes. I
will collaborate with Dining Services to bring sugarfree options, always have non-fried alternatives, and
have more gluten-free options. Also, I will work with
athletics to allow students who cannot work out in a
scheduled time frame to get PE credit from going to
the gym regularly on their own hours.
Ultimately, I am passionate about Student
Council and the differences I can make. After a year
on StuCo, I feel I am absolutely ready to be your next
Vice President.
Sincerely,

Ambar Mariela La Forgia
an influential force on campus that can have a serious
impact on the daily lives of the Swarthmore
Community; it cannot afford to take a step back at this
point in time.
In order to do this though, the student body needs
a Vice-President with an array of leadership and
activist experiences. During my last two years at
Swarthmore I have served as Tri-Co Peace Week CoAssistant Coordinator, Enlace President and
Secretary, Club Despertar Coordinator and Diversity
Workshop Facilitator. I have also been involved in
clubs such as SLAP (Swarthmore Labor Action
Project) and Colors. During my summers I have participated in community action projects, one in Bosnia
where I worked with an NGO working with children
who were affected by the Bosnian genocide. And most
recently, with the help of three other Swarthmore students, I founded a program for children from displaced
families in my hometown of Bogota, Colombia.
This is all to say that through my involvement I
have fundraised, facilitated meetings, coordinated
events, written grants, proposed to committees,
planned parties, etc. I have also worked with administrators, faculty, and professors at different levels in
order to accomplish these goals. These experiences
have taught me how to effectively navigate bureaucracy as well as the importance of an active persistency over a submissive complacency.
Ultimately, I promise that I will listen to your needs
and work hard with the rest of student council to continue improving the quality of life for every one at
Swarthmore. Though I have focused this platform
principally on the current budget cuts I promise to
continue to work withefforts to improve other aspects
of campus life, such as security, Sharpies and SBC
oversight. Ultimately, I plan to make my position in
Student Council a top priority.
For the last two years, Swarthmore has provided
me the space to grow as a person, an opportunity available for me because of past decisions made by the
administration. My experiences here have been some
of the most precious and formative of my life. I want to
ensure that this continues to be an opportunity for me
and for other Swarthmore students and prospective
students.
Though I am currently abroad, please do not hesitate to contact me via e-mail to drojasl I look forward
to being able to represent you if given the opportunity!

Gottlieb's basketball remarks alarmingly out of touch
A fan finds ESPN analyst Doug Gottlieb's critique of Duke basketball team unfounded and inaccurate
BY TAYLOR DOHERTY

DUKECHRONICLE.COM
During the halftime show of the
Duke-Arizona State game Wednesday,
after ESPN analyst Doug Gottlieb called
the Blue Devils "alarmingly unathletic"
at certain positions, I was perplexed.
I by no means think that Duke is one
of the most athletic teams in the country, but is he aware that freshman
Mason Plumlee was the runner-up in
the McDonald's Ail-American dunk
contest? Could Kyle Singler, a preseason All-American, play at his level
without athleticism? And has he taken
a close look at junior Nolan Smith's
moves in transition?

It's not something that is often overtly stated, but the perception that Duke
needs to recruit big, black players is
real—try checking Blue Devil message
boards or taking a close listen on campus, where the idea is often uncomfort-

ably expressed in jokes. And it's a view
that should disappear.
"There's been this perception that
Duke's team is too white, and that's not
what it is," Jones said. "The problem is
that the players haven't been good
enough. Contrary to popular belief, that
is not the same thing."

All this isn't to say that Gottlieb is
some sort of undercover racist, and I
am aware that as a Jewish athlete, he
was the subject of some gruesome and
unfair treatment on the part of insulting fans during his own playing days.
But I do think that Gottlieb should
address these claims and explain what
makes the Blue Devils "alarmingly
unathletic."
For one, "unathletic" isn't even a
real word: Try looking it up in
Merriam-Webster's online dictionary.
("The word you've entered isn't in the
dictionary. Click on a spelling suggestion below or try again using the search
bar above.") And for another, an alarming lack of athleticism is just not evident when you look at the Blue Devils
play.
Duke doesn't have the most athletic
team in the country, but Gottlieb's
assertion was incorrect and in my mind
improperly founded.

The sorry states of Woods, Weis and Ohio football

THELANTERN.COM, NOV. 29
Drive into the Woods
After blowing off authorities for two consecutive days,
Tiger Woods again avoided
speaking publicly on Sunday.
But the world's No. 1-ranked
golfer did release a statement
on his Web site, claiming
blame for his "accident."
Woods allegedly backed his
Cadillac SUV into a fire
hydrant and then a tree. Then,
his Swedish model wife supposedly bashed in the rear window with a golf club to rescue
him.
Sounds like an authentic
fairy tale, right?
Until the truth comes out, if
it ever does (or if it differs from
what little information has
been leaked thus far), rumors
will continue to swirl, dragging down Woods' seemingly
untarnishable reputation.
Whether a cheating Woods
was escaping the wrath of his
wife or whether the worldly
father was simply heading to
Wal-Mart to pick up diapers at
2:30 a.m., damaging rumors
will persist until Woods delivers an explanation.

When one thinks of Notre

The Fighting Irish lost to

Saturday, as Notre Dame fell to

For the Browns to replicate

must use those final contests to

this?"
"It was the other team. We couldn't
play our game, because they were just

playing dirty."

And when all else fails, there is

always one scapegoat you can turn to:
the referee. In all sports, at all levels,
from peewee football to the NHL, refer-

ees are hassled for every bad call and
missed play. But is this harassment well
placed?

There are plenty of infamous gaffes
that make a case for referees deserving
their negative image. Anyone who has
seen the 1986 World Cup quarterfinal
match between the Argentinean and
English soccer teams and witnessed
Diego Maradona literally punching the
ball into the net, an incident that has
come to be known as "the hand of God,"

has to question whether the officials for
the game were blind or just not paying
attention.
But there are just as many incidents
where referees have been blamed for
making the right call. Pittsburg Steelers
fans were outraged during the 1998
Thanksgiving Day game against the
Detroit Lions when it appeared thereferee awarded the overtime coin toss to the
wrong team. However, Jerome Bettis,
who was calling the toss for the Steelers,
seems to have changed his mind halfway
through from heads to tails. By NFL
rules, thereferee was required to use his
first choice and give the ball to the other
team. Thus it would appear that Steelers
fans have been blaming the wrong person for losing the game for all these
years (not that the coin toss was thereal
reason they lost anyway).
Whether they make good or bad calls,
or no calls at all, officials are apart of the
game on sports. Therefore, like every
other aspect of the game, they are studied with painstaking detail. Studies have
been done on such wide-ranging topics
as the relationship between fitness tests
and the match performance of Italian
soccer referees, the effects of prior
knowledge on officials, and the influence
of crowd noise on the calling of fouls in
soccer.
However, one 2005 study, recently
publicized by the New York Times, might
give fans more substantial proof thatref-

erees are to blame for their teams' losses.
In a study published in the "Journal of
Sports Science," Kyle J. Anderson and
David A. Pierce found that referees
attempted to make the number of fouls
committed by each team in a match the
same. Using games from the 2004-2005
NCAA
men's basketball season,
Anderson and Pierce's results suggest
that referees give preferential treatment
to the more aggressive teams, since no
matter how many fouls they commit, the
refs are going to try to make it even by
giving the same number to the opposing
team.

Anderson and Pierce also found evidence of referees giving preferential
treatment to the home team. These
results corroborate an earlier study published in "Psychology of Sport and
Exercise," which suggested that it was
the crowd that caused this preferential
treatment. In the study, Alan Nevill,
Nigel Balmer and Mark Williams found
that referees awarded significantly
fewer fouls against the home team when
shown videos of fouls with crowd noise
than when they were shown the videos
in silence.
Beyond helping the argument that
there are significant problems with refereeing, these studies seem to show that
referees are human and therefore subject to the same psychological pressures
as everyone else and prone to make mistakes like everyone else. Yet sports

would not be possible without them.
They certainly are not paid enough to
make it worthwhile to take so much grief
from fans (is there any amount of money
that would make it worth losing three
teeth and requiring numerous stitches
after being assaulted while refereeing a
sixth-grade boys’ basketball game?), so
you have to think that they referee for
the same reason athletes play: for the
love of the game. Maybe this should give
fans and athletes pause the next time
they curse out a referee for making a bad
call.
If it does not, then maybe the financial motivation will. Referees seem to be
fighting-back against the trash-talk they
have to endure from players. After his
game against the Detroit Pistons last
month, the Orlando Magic’s Dwight
Howard complained of what he viewed
as questionable calls by the referee on an
online blog. To his surprise, the NBA
fined him $15,000 for doing so. While paying this fine probably is not too hard for
an NBA player, it shows that referees do
not have to stand by idly as they are
abused, either verbally or physically,
from fans and players. This is just one
more reason why, if you find yourself
taken over by the urge to throw your
beer at a referee, it might be time to
become less involved in whatever sport
you are watching.

"To be competitive in the

our focus and intensity in practice to better simulate game situations. Individuals will need

Though the Garnet turned
in strong defensive outings
against their first three opponents, the defense struggled
against the Greyhounds, allowing Moravian to shoot 40.6 percent from the floor and giving
up 17 offensive rebounds.
"As a team, we need to get
tougher physically and mentally and play defense with
pride. Players simply need to
regularly play to their potential, and we will be very competitive. We need to develop a
killer instinct,". added Lacy,
who
finished with

Head coach Lee Wimberly,
who is in his 23rd year at
Swarthmore, was also frustrated by the team's defense. "I
thought that our defensive
effort against Moravian was
the worst it's been over the
first four games. For the most
part, it had been pretty good
for the first three games, and
that's really a concern."
The Garnet will also need to
shoot better in order to compete against the high-powered
Centennial Conference teams.
The Garnet is shooting just 33
percent from the field while
allowing opponents to shoot
nearly 43 percent on average.
From three, the Garnet has
shot at 23.5 percent.
"We haven't shot the ball

added. "The guys shoot the ball

The Life of Greeny

Balboa.
While his

Ivan Drago

was preparing in a typical boxing
gym, Rocky was in the unforgiving tundra
running miles carrying tree trunks on his
back and doing sit ups in abandoned
barns in the middle of nowhere.
Or maybe it's Chicago Bull's forward
Luol Deng, who digs his hands into a giant
bag of rice, performing the tedious repetitive motions to increase forearm strength.
No, wait. It has to be New York Yankees
catcher Jorge Posada who urinates on his
hands to prevent callouses. High five, anyone?
But why stop with your hands? Mixed
martial artist Lyota Machida drinks his
own urine every day. Why? He claims it
helps filter his body and that people have
been engaging in the odd behavior for centuries. Real benefits: unproven and
unknown.
On a side note, if you ever get a chance,
check out any interview with Machida.
When asked about his urine devouring
habit, his attempts to come up with a reasonable answer tip-toe the line between
funny and pathetic. He looks more lost
than Mark Madsen on a dance floor. I'd
feel bad for the guy, but he could probably
break me.
Translation: Athletes will do almost
anything if they think it's going to help
them be better.
Because athletes are the way they are,
at some point, things become normal,
things become widely accepted as beneficial, and everyone starts doing them in
fear of falling behind. NBA players are
already taking the hint. Baron Davis, Dirk
Nowitzki, Andre Iguodala, Leßron James,
Antawn Jamison and Chauncey Billups
are all yogis, just to name a few.
But why do yoga? Yoga has reached a
certain point of familiarity among athletes, but what's the point? If I were to tell
an athlete that hundreds of professionals
are doing a certain weight training program, we'd be in the weight room the next
day trying some of the stuff out, but
there's this strange resistance when it
comes to doing yoga.
The thing that makes yoga so beneficial is the same thing that will always condemn it to the "untraditional" and "alternate" label: There are zero measurable
results.
But there are results. "Yoga is somewhat hard to quantify in terms of benefits
because you see them in all the injuries
you don't get," Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who
has been doing yoga since 1976, told USA

Today
Given its main benefit of longevity and
sustained health, its no surprise that yoga
has caught on with the pros. "If you can
get through to a player that you could
extend your career even by a year by staying healthy and reducing injury, that one
year could make $5 million for you," said
NBA yoga coach Kent Katich, currently
employed by the Los Angeles Clippers. If
an athlete can stretch his career by even a
THE PHOENIX

couple of seasons, he can earn himself

some serious money.
According to a survey conducted by
the NBA, in 2008-2009, the average amount
of experience was only 4.71 seasons. It can
be a revolving door league.
The longevity comes from listening to
the body and developing an increased
awareness. Katich makes his players verbalize how they're feeling in every aspect
of their life. From how their diet is, to how
much sleep they are getting, to what body
parts feel tight to how much sex they're
having. "Once they verbalize, they
become more aware of it, and it all applies
to their stress level," Katich said.
It sounds like a tired age-old adage, but
it rings true especially in professional athletics: Your body is your vehicle. Athletes
can only go as far as their bodies can take
them.
But it's not entirely true, because the
mind is a muscle too. Yoga is largely about
developing the mind and becoming strong
mentally.
Yoga resides under the radar, in the

realm of the unseen. It lives in the "90 percent mental" that Yogi Berra was talking
about when he proudly proclaimed,
"Baseball is 90 percent mental; the other
half is physical."
"Yoga helps with controlling your
thoughts and developing concentration,"
Katich has said. Right, but how? .
Well, contorting your body into some of
these poses is no easy task. Putting yourself into these difficult positions requires
discipline. You must be aware of every
part of your body to ensure the pose is
absolutely impeccable. Combine that
focus with an intense concentration on
taking deep, slow, and controlled breaths
for an hour. What you get is a surprisingly involved workout for both the body and
mind.
I can't explain it exactly, but by the end
of the workout you feel centered. Things
seem clearer, stress melts away and life is
just better.
Controlling your thoughts is a big part

of that. I don't think I'm alone when I say
that thinking too much has gotten me into
trouble as an athlete. I start with one negative thought then it spirals into complete
self-doubt, and my confidence is shot. It's
a slippery slope. Yoga can reverse that
process. Control your body, control your
breath, and control your thoughts. It's all
one and the same. Yoga shows you that.
Yoga is an opportunity to break the
mental mold that athletes get stuck in.
We've been trained to ignore our bodies.
Push yourself to the point of exhaustion
then push yourself some more. Showing
fatigue is showing weakness right? We've
been told to keep going forever. But yoga
isn't about that. Yoga invites you to stop
and slow down.
I've found it pretty cool actually listening to my body for once. It's allowed
me to be more honest with myself as to
when I can push and when I should relax.
It's given me a mental escape an area
where I can forget about the stresses of
school and of the season.
I invite you to try it out, but for those
members of GreenyNation not feeling too
adventurous, you're actually in luck. You
can still get into the yoga world!
There's so much on yoga that I haven't
even mentioned. There's a whole world
out there of athletes taking on the new
challenge of yoga, and I'm diving in headfirst with a new blog.

To the Swarthmore Community,
Unfortunately, a couple of weeks
ago our season came to an end, but
in the mean time, each one of us has
had the opportunity to sit back and
reflect on what is behind us.
During this time, it has not been
hard to see this past season as a success.
Every year the bar seems to be
raised higher and we become less
satisfied with our previous successes.
We know that a national championship is something that is realistically within reach at this point and
it is because of everything put into
this program and the support from
the community.
Every August we come back to
Swarthmore ready to put forth nothing less than 100 percent.
Through reflection, however, it
has become obvious that it takes
more than just effort to achieve the
level of success that we have already
obtained and the level of success we

strive for in the future.
We realize the extra piece in the
equation has been and will continue
to be the tremendous support we
receive from you and the rest of the
Swarthmore community.
We would therefore like to use
this column to show our appreciation and gratitude to all Of the loyal
fans, parents, Adam Hertz, Christyn
Chambers, Ray and Larry, the trainers (especially Alison and Jared), all
of the other members in the field
house, faculty, the Sharpies staff
(especially Pat and Donny), and the
Swarthmore community at large for
helping us to have another successful season.
Thank you for encouraging us to
raise the bar each year and making
our jobs easy. Seriously, there was a
reason that we went undefeated at
home this year!
Thank you.

it was right

at the end of the first half and Dylan was playing with so much passion and he dribbled to the
goal line and took a shot, and I don't even know
how it happened
but the ball was in the net. In
that moment, seeing how driven and filled with
passion he was, he just couldn't be stopped."
Dylan's desire to succeed on the field was truly
contagious, as the Garnet posted a remarkable 5913-10 record over the past four years, including a
37-7-4 record at Clothier Field.

Omari Faakye didn't have a point until this,
his senior season, in which he tallied a goal and
two assists. But the impact that Faakye had on

On Nov. 20, for the third straight 2009 NCAA
Tournament game, the Swarthmore Garnet men's
soccer team found itself down 1-0. For the third
straight game, the Garnet rallied to tie the game
1-1. Although it had defeated the Merchant
Marines and Hobart by 2-1 scores at Clothier
Field the week before, the Garnet was unable to
score again against a strong Transylvania (Ky.)
defense. In penalty kicks, the Garnet fell 4-1, ending its tournament-run in the Sweet 16 for the second straight year.
The Transylvania Pioneers kept the Garnet
offense at bay all afternoon. But as the clock
ticked down, Gage Newman 'll, who also scored
the game-tying goal in the Garnet's first round
win over Merchant Marine, took a pass from
Morgan Langley 'll and buried a shot in the back
of the goal, tying the game at 1-L
Though the Garnet outshot the Pioneers 20-9
and led in corners by an 11-3 margin, the match

The final four teams in the

Division 111 draw, who will play in San Antonio
this weekend, are Messiah (Pa.), Williams
(Mass.), Dominican (111.) and Calvin.
"I've never seen a group of guys battle so completely
we've seen outstanding efforts before,
and teams put everything they have into a match,
but some of these guys went beyond what I
thought was physically capable," said coach Eric
Wagner, who led the Garnet to a 16-2-3 record this
year.
The Garnet will return the core of their squad
for the 2010 campaign, but the two seniors, Dylan
Langley 'lO and Omari Faakye 10, will be sorely
missed.
Dylan Langley 'lO scored in his first career
game, an 8-1 victory over Delaware Valley on
Sept. 2, 2006, and he never stopped. He ends his
career with 17 goals and 12 assists tied for ninth
all-time in Swarthmore's scoring history, but he
was much more to the Garnet over the past four
years than just a scorer. Langley served as a captain for the past two seasons and consistently led
by example with an incredible work ethic both in
practice and in matches.
"Not having Dylan [will be] huge. He's been a
part of this program for four years now, and he's
been such a big part of it
as a two-year captain
and as a four-year starter. Dylan will graduate as
the w.inningest soccer player in the history of our
program. No individual soccer player has won
more games in a Swarthmore uniform than
Dylan. And that's remarkable in and of itself,"
Wagner said.
Wagner added that "It really shows

the quality

of the teams that he led. When he was a freshman
and a sophomore, he was a leader in terms of his
and as he became a
productivity on the field
junior and a senior, the team got better and better
around him, [and] he stood out more in ways of
leadership, in terms of leadership and competitive fire. I've never worked with someone who
...

was as competitive as Dylan."
Fellow senior Omari Faakye feels privileged to
have played with Langley throughout their college careers. "We are the only two players in the
class of 2010, and I really realized the connection
that I had with him primarily this past year. We
both had that common ground, being able to lead
the team."
Faakye is impressed by Dylan's incredible

Tournament last year, the Garnet faced off
against the Dickinson Red Devils. When asked
about one moment involving Dylan on the field
that stands out, Faakye recalled Langley's game-

winning goal over Swarthmore's Centennial

Conference rivals.
"One moment that sticks out with Dylan was

his leaping above the entire crowd of defenders
and attackers in the Dickinson game last year,

field.

Ceylan Bodur looks for an opening against Dickinson on Nov.
Bodur scored a career-high 30 points in the 94-85 loss.
For the second year in a row,
the Swarthmore women's basketball team (2-2,1-1 CC) scored a basket in the final seconds to over-

come Centennial Conference rival
McDaniel in an early season meeting.

"I'm going to miss Omari's smilefirst and foremost," Wagner said. "I'm going to miss his enthusiasm, his energy, his spirit. Omari... learned so
much about the game and the American game
and about what it took for him to be successful."
Langley is likewise honored to have had the
opportunity to play with his classmate for the
past several years. "It's been a pleasure playing
with Omari and being able to share the experience with him. There were a number of great
guys who came out my freshman year, but after
four years, we were the only ones left. It's been a
great four years," he-said.
"Omari is a different spirit, a spirit that this
team thrived on, and hopefully the people he's
touched in his four years here will carry that forward as well because it was invaluable to our success," Wagner added.
Wagner's most vivid memory of Omari on the
field was not that first career goal. Wagner told
the story of Faakye entering last year's
Centennial Conference Championship game at
Clothier Field against rival Johns Hopkins.
"There was an enormous crowd, the game was
incredibly tight, and we put Omari in. And the
crowd went bananas because they love Omari
everyone loves Omari. And when he went on, the
crowd got even louder, which I didn't think was
even possible."
Wagner said that "thirty seconds after he got
onto the field, Omari [slide]-tackled a kid right in
front of our bench
and the crowd went
bananas, and the team went bananas, and it just
lifted the intensity of our team so much."
"[Being a part of the soccer team] has definiteI learned so
ly defined my life at Swarthmore
much about soccer and about my life in general.
It has taught me so many things about teamwork,
how to relate to people, and about having the
same dream as 25 other guys and working with
them to achieve the same goal. I've become very
passionate about soccer, and I've learned how to
achieve what I want and to follow my passions,"

The Garnet defeated the Green
Terror Tuesday by a score of 51-49
at
McDaniel's
Gill Center
Gymnasium thanks in part to a
Kathryn Stockbower 'll basket
with 0:04 remaining.
The victory is the Garnet's
first conference win of the season,
McDaniel reached the semifinals
of the Centennial Conference
Championship tournament last
winter, having secured a berth as
one of five teams tied for second
place in the conference with a
record of 11-7.
Swarthmore was left on the
outside looking at 10-8, despite
having its first winning season
since 2005.

The 2-2 start this year has set
the tone for more improvement
the Garnet went 0-3 at the beginning of last season.
Stockbower,
the reigning"
Centennial Conference Player of
the Year, scored 30 points against
McDaniel
her second 30+ outing
in a row after scoring 32 against
Dickinson (3-1,1-1 CC) on Nov. 24.
Stockbower was joined in the
over-30 club against the Red
Devils by Ceylan Bodur 'll, who
scored 30 points of her own. The
offensive effort fell short of the
potent Dickinson offense, howev-

er, as the Red Devils scored four
players in double digits to come
out on top by a score of 94-85 in the
high-scoring affair.

Swarthmore will travel to 2009
runner-up Johns Hopkins (3-2, 1-1
