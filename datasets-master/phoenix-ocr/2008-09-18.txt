Corrections
Last week’s article on Jennifer Magee joining
the Lang Center as Associate Director of Student
Programs and Training incorrectly stated that
she was a Assistant Professor when she was actually Visiting Assistant Professor in the Peace and
Conflict Studies department. She also coached
women’s rowing at Washington College in
Maryland, not the University of Washington.
Additionally, she spoke to Lang executive director Joy Charlton about community-based learning, not Sarah Wille.

The article on the new Beardsley Media Center
incorrectly claimed that SCCS resources can only
be used when a staff member is on site. SCCS is
open from 8 a.m. until 2 a.m. daily, during which
time any student can use the facility’s equipment.
Last week’s article on RIAA’s efforts to reign in
file-sharing implied that DC++ is entirely safe and
legal. The DC++ software itself is legal, but using
DC++ to share copyrighted files is not.

In Elena Smith’s column, Colleen Toledano’s

Students mobilize support for Democrats
Grassroots canvassing operation could be decisive factor in competitive races this fall
BY MARY PRAGER

mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

On Aug. 28, Swarthmore residents, local politicians
and a handful of students from the college squeezed into
the small office of Bryan Lentz, the State House
Representative from Pennsylvania's 161st Legislative
District, to celebrate Barack Obama's nomination as the
Democratic Party candidate and watch his televised
acceptance speech. Just across the train tracks from the
SEPTA station, the party marked just the beginning of
what is to many Swarthmore students, and will continue
to be until November, a fusion of local politics, national
politics and grassroots volunteerism.
In 2006, Bryan Lentz, a first-time candidate, defeated
28-year Republican incumbent Tom Gannon for a seat in
the Pennsylvania State House by fewer votes than the student population of the college. By a mere 860 ballots, the
native Pennsylvanian secured a two-year term in which
he established a progressive position on issues as varied
as environmentalism, school violence and airport congestion. Two years later, Lentz, the State House
Representative from Pennsylvania's 161st Legislative
District, is up for re-election in a campaign temporally
and politically tied to a historical presidential election.
Dan Leigh 'O9, executive director of the College
Democrats, volunteered for Lentz in 2006 and contributed
to a grassroots campaign that, in his words, won Lentz
the seat. During the spring of his first year, Leigh was
approached by Rick Stabinski, head of the Democratic
Party in the borough of Swarthmore, to be a precinct committee member. Through that connection he became
involved with Lentz's campaign. He started to work with
the campaign in April and continued during the summer
and over fall break of his sophomore year, helping primarily with running the field campaign. "For a first-time
candidate with not-so-much money, the field campaign is
how you get your name out there," Leigh said.
This year, the outcome of Lentz's race against
Republican challenger Joseph Hackett will determine
whether the Democratic Party will retain its present
majority in the Pennsylvania State House. "The
Pennsylvania House is controlled by one seat, a one-seat
Democratic majority. Brian Lentz literally is the
Democratic majority in the Pennsylvania State House,"
Leigh said. He believes that this local election hinges on
what he calls "the power of volunteerism" and the impact
that a single volunteer, let alone ten or twenty, can have
on an election. A committed volunteer can talk to more
than 860 voters in two weeks, according to Leigh. "We are
the margin of victory. We were in 'O6, and it's very, very
probable we will be again in 'OB, and not just for Brian
Lentz but possibly for Obama, in terms of winning
Pennsylvania." Leigh said. "This year especially,
Democrats are going to rise and fall together."
Indicative of that collaborative spirit, Brian Lentz's
campaign has mobilized to support other Democratic candidates. "The Lentz campaign and the Obama campaign
are working fairly well together. Brian has been hosting
Obama phone banks from his office," Leigh said. "He
[Lentz] has been incredibly supportive of other campaigns in the area," Molly Weston 'lO, president of the
College Democrats, said. The presence of other local
politicians in Lentz's office on the day of Obama's acceptance speech, along with a photograph hanging in the
office of Lentz with Obama, reflect the campaign's commitment to fostering unity among Democratic candidates
across the board for this year's local and national elections.
"Pennsylvania is the state without which Obama cannot win
Philly is going Democratic, Pittsburg is going
Democrat, the section in between... is not going
Democrat. So what it comes down to is the Philadelphia
suburbs, which we are ground zero in Obama can't win
without winning the Philadelphia suburbs," Leigh said.
Now that Barack Obama is the official nominee of the
Democratic Party, the College Democrats have channeled
their energy into supporting both Obama and Lentz. This
has required some structural changes within the organization. Last year, Swarthmore Students for Obama, a

group focused exclusively on supporting Obama in the
primaries, functioned independently of the College
Democrats, who chose not to endorse a candidate. During
the first two weeks of this academic year, "Swatties for
Obama was brought into the loving embrace of the
College Democrats," Weston said.
Out of the remnants of Swarthmore Students for
Obama emerged Obama Action Team, or OAT. "Because
we were working so closely with the Democrats and they
provided a lot of valuable resources it made more sense to
not have a distinct separate group, so OAT was born," Jon
Erwin Frank 'll, vice president of College Democrats,

ringing someone's doorbell and having a political debate
with them would be really scary," Spielvogel said.
While canvassing, novice volunteers are paired with
more senior members of the College Democrats or OAT.
Together, they visit houses by street according to a list
they receive from the regional coordinator, Spielvogel
said. She estimated that each trip, a volunteer visits fifty
houses but only makes contact with a fourth of the residents. "We did a specifically Bryan Lentz one last weekend," Spielvogel said. "People don't really know about
their local politicians a lot of the time so all you have to
do is mention his name and say a few good things about

leadership.
Working closely with Field Coordinator of the Obama
Campaign Josh Kaserman and the Lentz campaign, the
College Democrats and OAT have hosted phone banks and
canvassing trips. The first phone bank took place last
Friday, and future phone banks will occur weekly on
Thursdays from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. in Lentz's office. The
Democrats have organized a shuttle service on Saturdays
and Sundays to dispatch canvassers to the Philadelphian
suburbs and to Lentz's district, where they have been
talking to residents about the candidates and distributing
campaign literature. Students can canvass on behalf of a
specific candidate or for a group ofDemocrats. This weekend, the volunteers will be canvassing for Congressman
Joe Sestak, Representative of the 7th District of
Pennsylvania.
Erwin Frank estimated that ten to twelve volunteers,
not necessarily affiliated with the College Democrats or
OAT, came out to canvass the first Sunday. Frank placed
the second weekend's turnout at fifteen to twenty volunteers. Roughly seven students volunteered at the first
phone bank. "I definitely feel that more people should get
involved and I think that more people will as we get a little closer to the election and as they get more settled at
Swarthmore, but we've already had a lot of enthusiasm
from freshmen and upperclassmen," Frank said.
One such first-year was Julie Spielvogel 'l2. In the past
few weeks, Spielvogel has canvassed three times and participated in the phone bank and intends to continue supporting Obama and local politicians until the election. "I
was really nervous about canvassing because I wouldn't
consider myself a confrontational person and I thought

didate."

Obama member said. Although the College Democrats is
a permanent organization at the college, OAT will exist
only until the election in November. Until then, the
groups will work closely together and share some of its

him."
Under-education regarding politics in general can
often work against local politicians. "People think that
the presidential election is the only election going on, so
there's an undervote. A lot of people come out and only
vote for Obama and not for Congress, Joe Sestak and
Bryan Lentz," Leigh said. "There are so many important
functions of government that go on at the state level that
people don't really think of," he said. The best example,
he said, is funding for education, most of which comes
from the state. One of the volunteers' objectives is to
inspire voters who are going to vote for Obama to vote for
local politicians as well.
Academic research stands behind the argument that
door-to-door interaction and interpersonal contact
through phone banking is perhaps the most effective
method for turning out the vote. In a series of studies on
voter turnout, professors Alan Gerber and Donald Green
of Yale University found that the simple act of knocking
on a voter's door and talking to him or her about the candidate and issues, or speaking to voters over the phone,
increases voter turnout substantially. "Not many people
realize their power in a democracy and the power of their
work, because there's this perception that campaigns are
won from television or through mailings or paid canvassing, but actually...somebody knocking on your door with
a smile and actually talking to you is the most effective
type of canvassing," Leigh said, citing the study.
.
For students whose passions lie in campaign organizing and politics, volunteering for local candidates is an
opportunity to learn about the grassroots mechanics of a
campaign. Charlie Decker 'O9, who has been working
with Lentz since June 2008. said, "I just think that the
local campaigns are exciting because you get actual
access to the candidates. You get to do higher up work
and more complicated work, and you get to know the can-

Students attend, volunteer at Biden rally

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY MARTHA MARRAZZA
mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

Amidst bales of hay and pumpkin patches, Swatties
turned out in droves on Tuesday to hear Vice
Presidential candidate Joe Biden speak to supporters at
Linvilla Orchards in Media. The College Democrats coordinated transportation to and from the event, and a few
Swarthmore students arrived early to set up for the rally.
The rally featured an invocation by Swarthmore's
Protestant Advisor and Interfaith Coordinator, Reverend
Joyce Tompkins, who led the crowd in a Quaker moment
of silence. Philadelphia school teacher Nancy Bowlus led
the Pledge of Allegiance, and different members of
Obama's .Delaware County campaign team spoke about
the importance of volunteering and local get-out-the-vote
efforts before the political speeches began.
Tompkins said the opportunity to give the invocation
fell into her lap unexpectedly. "My husband is a priest in
Ridley Park, and a member of his parish is active in the
Democratic Party in Delaware County and asked my husband originally to do it," Tompkins said. "He was out of
town yesterday, so he asked me, and I jumped at the
chance. I felt like it was a great opportunity to support
Biden and Obama and speak for my faith."
According to Tomkins, some observers were surprised
by her appearance at a partisan venue and strong
endorsement of the Democratic candidates. "I think that
some people were surprised I was willing to speak at a
political event as an official religious person, but I feel as
a person of faith it's so important to deal with issues
about real people, like climate change and the economy,"
Tompkins said. "It's a time when people of faith really
have to speak out, and this is how I felt called to do it."
Josh Kaserman, the Obama campaign field supervisor
for the area of Swarthmore, said that the campaign is
acutely aware of its rapidly closing window for mobilization and outreach efforts before voters cast their ballots
on Nov. 4. "We only have 49 days until the presidential
election. We only have 49 days to change the world."
Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell made an appearance before Joe and Jill Biden took the stage. "Before the
Denver convention, McCain's campaign manager was
quoted as saying this campaign is not about issues,"
Rendell said. "This race is not about issues? This race is
all about issues. Joe Biden is a terrific person, and he
cares deeply about people and issues."
After a slight delay, Joe and Jill Biden emerged from
their multi-car caravan with their granddaughter in tow.

A group of Swarthmore students pose outside Tuesday's rally for Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Jill spoke about the process her husband went through to
become Obama's running mate and then handed the
microphone off to Joe.
Joe Biden talked about his ties to Delaware and
Pennsylvania and said that he and his family had fond
memories of trips to Linville Orchards. Biden touched on
economic themes before laying out problems with the
McCain campaign and touting reasons to vote for Obama.
"We've been dug into a deep hole over the last eight
years. There is not a time in American history that we've
been as isolated internationally as we are today," Biden
said. "John's a decent, honorable man and he deserves
our respect, but America deserves more than a brave soldier. America needs a wise leader."
Besides members of the press and Obama's volunteers,
over 1,000 people came out to hear the event, with around
40 Swarthmore students in attendance. Supporters purchased snacks ranging from apple cider to hot dogs, and
most people sat on benches or hay trucks during the rally.
Andrew Greenblatt 'l2 was one of many first-years and
first-time voters to attend the event. "I came because it's

the first time that I've had the opportunity to go to a real
.political rally and I'm really excited to be here," he said.
Maggie Pinder, a volunteer from the Obama headquarters in Chester, said that the event was really an
attempt to energize Obama supporters in the area. "I
think the point of today is just to campaign for Obama
and get people to register to vote," Pinder said. "We want

to make sure we don't have four more years of what we've

had. With the way the economy is going, we need a

change."
Dan Leigh 'O9, an Executive Director of the College
Democrats, said that the Pennsylvania suburbs will likely be an important battleground in the upcoming election.

"Pennsylvania is the swing state without which
Obama cannot win, and the Philadelphia suburbs are
really ground zero in terms of winning PA," Leigh said.
"The number of Swatties who showed up today to hear
Joe Biden really demonstrated to me that Swarthmore
students are willing to step up and be a decisive force in
Obama winning Pennsylvania."

Caltech delegation visits college to observe student life, dorms
BY AMELIA POSSANZA

apossanl@swarthmore.edu

Eleven students from the California
Institute of Technology filled the Parrish
parlors with suitcases, duffel bags and unfamiliar faces last Wednesday. These students
spent two days talking with Swarthmore
students and administrators to evaluate the
college's social and academic atmosphere.
The
Caltech students' visit to
Swarthmore was part of a two week
"Student Experience Trip."
The program materialized after Caltech
student Craig Montuori submitted a proposal for funding from the MooreHu f stedler Fund, which provides resources
to improve the quality of student life at
Caltech.
Montuori's vision was realized this
September, when the student delegation traversed the country to gather information
about eight east coast schools that Caltech
considers peer institutions: Olin College of
Engineering, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Williams, MIT, Swarthmore and Haverford.
According to a website dedicated to the
program, "The Student Experience Trip is
designed to examine the culture and atmosphere of other colleges and universities,
study specific aspects of student life and the
student experience and produce a studentauthored report." The participants were
particularly interested in collecting infor-

4

mation from the host institutions that
might guide the construction of a new campus center and the rebuilding of some residential houses at Caltech. They also examined more general issues pertaining to student life, such as student activities, housing

policies and athletics.

"At all our stops we had scheduled meetings with deans and people in charge of academic affairs. We also talked to student
body presidents and campus leaders. There
was a lot of unplanned stuff because there's
a lot of stuff that it doesn't make sense to
have a sit down meeting about," Caltech
student Anthony Chong said.
At Swarthmore, the delegation of
Caltech students met with Associate Dean
of Student Life Myrt Westphal, Dean of

Students Jim Larimore and Associate Dean
of Academic Affairs Garikai Campbell.
They also sat down with Vice President
Maurice Eldridge '6L
Before leaving Caltech, the students had
done a considerable amount of research and
came prepared with specific questions.
"The conversations ranged from all kinds of
things. One was about our housing situation because people switch housing every
year [at Swarthmore] while [Caltech has] a
house system where you join a house and
stay with that group. So that was really
very different," said Westphal.
In conversations with the deans, the delegation noted other differences between the

two institutions, including the college's
alcohol policy, the role of RAs and social
integration between students of different
class years.
Members of the Caltech delegation also
discussed their observations
with
Swarthmore students.
"They appreciated so many small
things," Student Council Vice President
Sven David Udekwu 'O9 said.
The delegate he hosted, Edward Chen,
was intrigued by academic opportunities
such as the honors program and directed

readings.

After completing their visit to Haverford
and Swarthmore, the delegation returned to
Caltech on Sept. 13. They have not yet decided whether their observations at peer institutions will manifest in policy changes at
their own school.
"We have a lot we still want to reflect on.
I think there is definitely a lot of stuff we
want to talk about, but it's too early to say
what exactly will work," said Chong. Not
only does the delegation need to identify the
policies it would like to see replicated at
Caltech, but it must also assess the feasibility of implementing these changes.
Chong said he was confident that
Caltech's administration will be receptive
to the delegation's suggestions. "We do have
power through our influence. The administration from the president down knows
what we set out to do, so it's about letting

September 18, 2008

people know what we want to do," Chong
said.

Also, stories from past trips give Chong
reason to believe that the delegation can
effect change. Chong said that in the 1930s
three students took a quarter off to visit
schools on the east coast and in England.
These students recommended the housing
system that is now currently in place. A
similar type of trip happened in the 70s.
The returning delegation suggested that the
school admit girls. Shortly thereafter, girls
were allowed to enroll at Caltech.
Not only did this year's delegation get
ideas about suggestions for change back at
Caltech, but it also gave Swarthmore a
chance to examine itself. Students and
administrators had to answer a barrage of
questions
about what makes up
Swarthmore's culture and atmosphere.
They also had to test their hospitality. "It
was a good experience hearing them talk
about how much they really liked our
school and how the people were so friendly.
It's nice to know that we are a very open
campus with new people," Udekwu said.
When asked if Swarthmore would ever
consider doing something like this,
Westphal said, "I don't think we wouldn't
do it. I don't think we have the sense that
life at Swarthmore needs a total revamping
and so we might take small trips. We're
very unique. One size doesn't fit all in our
case."

Dukakis returns to pinpoint the stakes of the election
Wednesday marked Constitution Day,
during which all publicly funded schools
must hold activities dealing with the history
of the United States Constitution. Roughly a
year ago, Vice President for College and
Community Relations Maurice Eldridge '6l
was in the midst of communicating withfor-

mer Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis '55 when he realized that next
year's constitution day would be a great way
to get Dukakis to speak again on campus.
Dukakis is an alumnus who exerted his radical views to push change in the college. As

a Swarthmore student, he opened an
impromptu barber shop for Nigerians when
no one else would cut their hair and petitioned against fraternities on campus. But
this was all decades before the Constitution
Day spot was booked and the seats began to
fill in LPAC cinema in preparation for the
Dukakis's speech entitled "Presidential
Election 2008: What's at stake?"
"It's too often the case that quite terrific
things happen here and they get small audiences because things compete with each
other," said Eldridge. "When we can pull
things off that pull a big audience and creates a shared experience for the community,

I'm happy."

Eldridge introduced Dukakis to a crowd
that certainly gave him reason to be happy.
The speech encouraged students to involve
themselves in the public service field
whether that be an elected office or simply
by campaigning for those one believes in. He
also commented on the ability of Barack
Obama to win the presidential race and the
vicious rifts that exist today between the
Democratic and Republican parties. Prior to
the talk, Assistant Opinions Editor Jeff
Davidson interviewed the former governor.
The following is excerpted from what the
governor had to say about the politics of his
time, the politics of the current era and the
entire Swarthmore experience.

JeffDavidson: Talking in terms of the gen-

eral Democratic Party's ideas and ideals, in
what ways do you believe the party differs
now from what it used to be? Are they headed

in a positive direction?
Michael Dukakis: Just to go back, in the
50's when I was around here, there's no
question that the new deal, fair deal,
Roosevelt, Truman had begun to define the
Democratic party. But you got to understand
that in the congress for example, you had liberal
Democrats,
and
conservative

Democrats. You had these southern racist
white Democrats, so called, who controlled
the congress because of seniority. But they
were anti civil rights, they were very conservative in economic terms, many of them
opposed a lot of the stuff Harry Truman
wanted to do.
At the same time you had liberal
Republicans along with conservative
Republicans. One of the things that's happened is that the parties are much more ideologically cohesive today then they were
back then. Now some people say that's terrible because it leads to a lot of partisanship,
but at least you know what the Democrats
and the Republicans for the most part stand
for, which in those days was all kind of a

blur.
What I said to these folks is "What's the
difference between Democrats and
Republicans?" and I think Republicans
would agree with this definition. Generally
speaking, Democrats are more willing to use

government to achieve important social and
economic goals than Republicans are. And I
think it's probably a pretty good definition.
But like all definitions, I think these days
when it comes to national security
Republicans tend to be much more of interventionists.
I mean, I think the invasion of Iraq will
go down as one of the dumbest decisions in
American foreign policy. There is nothing
conservative about invading Iraq. It was a
radical step, and a dumb step in my opinion
and I think the opinion ofthe overwhelming majority of Americans today. I don't
think there's any question when it comes to
international: if you look at McCain and you
look at Obama today, Obama says look
you've got to talk to these people and
McCain says you don't talk to them. Bush
says you don't talk to them, 'axis of evil" and
that kind of stuff. In the international front,
Democrats are much more willing to reach

out and talk to people, even people they don't
like.
This is a very clear difference between
the parties. In this campaign, as in every
campaign including my own, republicans
are doing their best to try to get people to forget what the issues are by waging the culture wars again. I don't think they're going
to succeed, I think Obama's very clearly

undesrstands this. The economy now has
become such a dominant issue, that it's
going to be very difficult to persuade the
majority of the American people that some

presidential nominee in 1988.
of these so-called cultural issues are more
important then fundamental strength of the
American economy and what's happened
internationally. But they're trying, they're
trying. Palin said "We're serious about
national security, they want to read them
their rights?" What's that mean? She doesn't
believe in the constitution
or what? I
think that's typical of this type of thing and
they did it to me and I did a terrible job of
dealing with it. And they did it to Kerry, this
genuine war hero who suddenly ends up
being soft on national security running
against a guy who was reading magazines in
Alabama with a running mate who is the
most notorious draft pusher in the United
States and they managed to pull it off. So
that's the way they run their campaigns and
we have to be forewarned.
The Obama campaign isn't under any
illusions they know they have to hit back
and they have to hit back hard. McCain, particularity in the last ten days, has really
been making some serious mistakes and
been telling America false things.
JD: Is Barack Obama's current campaign
effective enough to make him the new president?And what does he need to step up on?
MD: I would say two things, and remember to consider the source
if I was so
smart I would have got myself elected. I
think he has to continue pounding away
with the economy and continue connecting
with people in their every day fives. And
give them a very clear sense ofWhat he will
do to straighten out this mess just like
Clinton did in 1992. You could take a page
right of the Clinton playbook in 1992. And I
think he's got to be very tough when they
keep coming at him. Now he's doing that
he and his campaign are doing that. But I
think the economic issues are now so dominant that he's got an opportunity to bring
this right down to the level of average
Americans who, as Clinton used to say, are
getting the shaft and have been for the past
eight years. It's tax cuts for the rich and
crumbs for the rest of us, that's what the
Republican philosophy is all about. And he's
saying that; he's got to keep saying it.
JD: During your time at Swarthmore you
were very actively against the fraternities.
Although today the number has gone down
fromfive houses to two, they still do exist. The
college justifies this by making them non-residential and less discriminatory. If you were a
Swarthmore student today, would you still
sign that petition and work to put an end to
thefraternities?
MD: Oh yeah, I kind of led the fight to get

"Social life is unnecessarily divided by fraternities and the
competition of attractions in the neighboring vicinities.
Centralization of events should be brought about by the
expansion of college social activities as all-college affairs,
and not merely as social plugs to fill the vacuum of nonfraternity social life. Naturally, this would entail a larger
budget and facilities possibly a Student Union, built by
the students as has been the case at other schools thus
reducing construction costs tremendously and making it
an all-college cooperative project."

them out. By the way, the guy who led the
pro-fraternity campaign and won (we lost it),
was a big supporter of mine in California.
He's a very successful high-tech entrepreneur. He always said I'm with Dukakis, but
I'm one guy who beat him in an election
campaign. And it was the campaign to get
rid offraternities. The case for getting rid of

them was
it wasn't because the
Swarthmore fraternities supported these
discriminatory clauses, they wanted to get
rid of them as well my argument was that,
well, if you can't get rid of them, then you
need to get out of national fraternities. In a
campus this size I see no need to have them.
There were sororities here too, but they got
rid of them. Maybe in a very large university there's a case to be made for this kind of
thing, but I don't see it in a place like this.
JD: In terms ofpublic transportation,, you
got the mass transit system back on track in
Boston and even rode the subway to work
every day, which means the system must have
been working pretty well. A step towards cutting back global warming is keeping up and
building upon our public transportation.
What does the country need to do to get back
on track with creating an infrastructure that
is safe, reliable, and inexpensive that can
match Europe's?
MD: I'm a big, big supporter of rail passenger system I was on the Amtrak board.
By the way, John McCain was chairman of
the Commerce and Transportation committee. McCain is just a guy who just doesn't get
it, he has no conception of why it's important to this country. I don't see how you can
look at the world ahead, at the energy situation, at global warming, and not conclude
that this country has got to invest in a first
class national rail passenger system, and
excellent metropolitan transit systems in
every major metropolitan area in the country. When it comes to this, there's just a huge
difference between the candidates in this

presidential campaign. One of the things,
apart from the fundament mistake of invad-

is that that thing will cost us well
over a trillion dollars. Our infrastructure is
falling apart, and we're spending billions on
this foolish thing. It isn't that we don't have
the resources for this, but our public infrastructure is falling apart while we're all over
there fighting this dumb war.
JD: Should Obama be returning the
attacking ads that he is getting right now?
MD: Oh they're doing it. I don't know
what you see, but there's not a single
McCain ad these days that's being shown
that isn't immediately replied to.

New businesses poised to revitalize Ville
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

Recent revitalization efforts and real estate reshuffling in
the Ville are bringing new businesses to the town center.
After previously being slated for the old site of Da Vinci's

Cafe, the new BYOB restaurant Rudi's on Park will be located at 112 Park Avenue across from Borough Hall, Town
Center Coordinator Marty Spiegel said. "[ll2 Park Avenue]
is the largest space, and it will provide a lot more seating
accommodations," Spiegel said. "The new space is set up
really well for having private parties and events, and it will
have a tremendous outdoor seating availability."
Last spring after the abrupt closure of Da Vinci's Cafe,
Rudi's on Park initially planned to move into the space at 1
Park Avenue. However, Jack Cavanaugh, Vice President on
the Board of Directors of Swarthmore's Town Center, said
the new venue at 112 Park Avenue will allow for more extensive seating.
"The space will have four separate dining rooms on two
floors as well as a beautiful space for outdoor dining, weather permitting," Cavanaugh said in an email. "We will be able
to seat 90 patrons at one sitting inside."
Spiegel said that Rudi's on Park would likely open in midto late-December. "We were hoping to do something closer to
the start of school opening, or maybe before Thanksgiving,
but I don't think that will be terribly feasible," Spiegel said.
The status of the space previously occupied by Da Vinci's
Cafe is not finalized at this point, Spiegel said. "I just noticed
that the 'For Rent' signs are gone. I did speak to someone a
few weeks ago who had been looking at that space as another food venue, but I don't really know if that's been finalized," Spiegel said. "I think there's a good likelihood that
there will be another food venue in that space, but I don't
know what the time frame is. I would hope that probably in
the next two months another food venue would arise in that
spot."

The closure of another Ville staple, the Village
Restaurant, has opened up more real estate in the town center. Spiegel said that the expansive restaurant space has
been subdivided into two spaces for future use.
"Part of the old Village Restaurant has been rented out
and it will be a professional office," Spiegel said. "The other
part of the space is still available, as far as I know. Again, it
would be nice to think another food venue would come in,
but it's hard to open things that have such high operating
and construction costs involved."
Vivaan Nehru 'O9 said students would support some of
the new offerings in the Ville. "If there were more restaurants in the Ville, I would definitely go in more," he said. "I
am always happy when new stuff happens in the Ville
because it's so convenient. If something interesting opens,

especially a BYOB restaurant or something with a chill coffee shop environment, I think that people will definitely use
it. There's usually a hunger for new stuff," Nehru said.
Besides the new restaurants that are cropping up around
the Ville, businesses such as the Creative Living Room are
increasing traffic to the town center. The Creative Living
Room, a new creative and educational arts space, recently
opened at 15 Chester Road. Run by four women, the new
space will have classes, workshops and performances in
music, dance, theaterand the arts, Spiegel said.
"The Creative Living Room will cater largely to children,
but it's for all ages," Spiegel said. "It has everything from
yoga to acting to drawing to dance, so it's going to be a very
active learning space as well as a performance space. I
expect it to be a real boom for the downtown area," he said.
Lynn Falk, Director of the Dance Program and a cofounder of the Creative Living Room, said she and the other
three founders represent different disciplines but have come
together to collaborate in this shared space. "The Creative
Living Room is a hub of activity, and it's been very well

received so far," she said. "We had our open house ofclasses
last week, and almost all of the classes are full."
Falk said that the Creative Living Room does not only
cater to children, but will actually feature a number of teen
and adult classes and even an adults-only entertainment
series.
"The Creative Living room is not mainly for children;
that's one of the misconceptions around town. Most of the
classes are for children, but there are a lot for teens and
adults," Falk said. "There will be a First Friday series that
will be entertainmentfor adults only. We also have a family
performance series, and you can also rent out the space for
parties."

Falk also said that Swarthmore students should take

advantage of the Creative Living Room's offerings. "You can
drop in for a yoga class, singing class or acting lesson and
pay the student rate," she said.

Heritage Month celebrates cultural legacy of Latin America
JONATHAN EMONT

jemontl@swarthmore.edu
Latino Heritage Month, America's annual celebration of Hispanic culture, is in full
swing on the Swarthmore campus.
Sponsored by the Intercultural Center and
ENLACE (Engaging Latino Communities
for Education), and with funding from many
quarters here on campus, theLatino-focused
events of the month are designed to showcase the varied and vibrant cultures of the
people of Latin America, and to celebrate
Latinos' achievements in American society.

"It's going to be a great
month; things are
well-organized."
Luis Rodriguez
Intercultural Center intern
The month began on September 11th, and
seven days in there have already been a
number of events on campus, with many
more planned for the rest of the month. This
coming week alone will feature a perform-

6

ance by Raquel Riviera, the hip-hop singer
cum professor, the celebrating of an
ENLACE-sponsored barbeque, and a movie
screening of "Machuca" in the Lang
Performing Arts Center.
Planned for later on in the month are two
more movie nights, with showings of "My
American Girls" and "XXY." There will also
be a political panel on the impact of Latinos
in the upcoming election, and a performance
by Hu Aye, a Puerto Rican band with roots
in Latin American and African percussion.
Co-president ofENLACE Deivid Rojas 'll
said, "Our goal is that this year's celebration
will be interesting for a broader range of
people." He said the diverse nature of the
events on campus will signal to people that
there "is more to being Latino than throwing dances."
This underscores the dual nature of the
event, which, it is hoped by ENLACE members, will both broadcast Latino culture to
the campus at large as well as provide an
opportunity for students of Latino origin to
bond over their shared heritages.
Raymond Zuniga, also co-president of
ENLACE, said that these events, as well as
the organizations that sponsor them, provide support for Latino students.
"Especially those from New York City, demographics are a lot different than back home,"

Zuniga said. It was for this reason that the
Latino-oriented Tri-Co formal, "La Gala,"
will be thrown. Representing the climax of
the month, the formal will be attended by
Latino students from all three schools, with
an after-party open to all students.
Formal celebration will conclude on
October 9, with an ENLACE-sponsored
potluck dinner. The potluck dinner will be
an open meeting, and everyone who participates in the month is invited to attend.
One of the most anticipated events of the
month occurred this last Monday. Vicky
Ruiz, Professor of History and Latino
Studies at the University of California,
Irvine, spoke to a packed audience about the
need to "Re-imagine United States History
with Latinos as central actors," discussing
the comparatively low rates of LatinoAmericans with college degrees.
Rafael Zapata, Assistant Dean and
Director of the Intercultural Center, hoped
thatthis month would help demonstrate the
'fconsiderable diversity within the Latino
community in the United States." He
stressed, however, that the ongoing celebration, while a great way to "kick-off the year,"
should not mark the peak of Latino presence
on campus, but should, instead "set the
tone"
This is the third year thatdie college has

September 18,2008

made a concerted effort to organize events
around this month. The sponsors focused
this year on providing a variety of different
events and discussing the impact ofLatinos
in America from both a cultural and political perspective.
The upcoming political panel is set to discuss Latino-Americans' growing power in
Already having taken place this month is a
Latino faculty-student luncheon, a performance by the musical group Yerbabuena, and
a panel on reproductive justice.
Much of the organization for this event
comes courtesy of the Intercultural Center's
intern, Luis Rodriguez. Responsible for
inviting guests and coordinating events,
Rodriguez has been working to raise money
from a number of funds on campus, including, but hardly limited to, the President's
Office and the Office of Multicultural
Affairs. On raising the $9OOO, he said, "We've
pretty much hit that goal. It's going to be a
great month; things are well-organized.
We're really excited for the campus."
Additional funding for the month comes
from the campus' History, Latin American
Studies, Gender and Sexuality, and
Sociology and Anthropology Departments,
as well as from the Forum for Free Speech.
"So far things have been going great,"
Zunigasaid.

Saxon conducts research at CERN lab
BY ALEXANDER

ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edii

This fall, Jamie Saxon 'O9 has taken
leave of Swarthmore to work at the
European Center for Nuclear Research, or
CERN, a world-leading laboratory for particle physics located in Geneva,
Switzerland. Currently, Saxon is working
on the ATLAS project, one of the detectors'
associated with the Large Hadron Collider
the centerpiece of CERN's research.
In the summer after his sophomore
year in high school, Saxon worked at the
High Energy Physics lab at the University
of Pennsylvania. This was one of the few
labs that responded to his e-mails requesting that they take a high school student.
For the next three summers, Saxon
worked at the lab, "making prototype electronics or cables and learning about the
project," Saxon wrote in an e-mail interview. The third summer, Saxon, who was
by then a Swarthmore student, continued
to work on the project in Geneva, "doing
somewhat more technical/cerebral work."
His role at the lab has varied from year
to year, and has included "monitoring the
temperatures of our detector and help[ing]
test cables in the experimental pattern,
[working on] the installation of the patch
...

panels (intermediary piece of the readout
system) in the cavern, and work[ing] on
timing configuration programs."

"This summer, I started with database
programming, and now I am working on
learning more about the data acquisition
for the detector, and writing additional
programs for this. Basically, my work for
the last two years is largely encompassed
by the installation and 'timing' of the
detector," Saxon said.

"Basically, my work for the
last two years is largely
encompassed by the
installation and timing' of
the [particle] detector."
Jamie Saxon 'O9
On Sept. 10, at 10:28 a.m., a beam in the
Large Hadron Collider traveled the entire
27 kilometers of the most powerful particle
accelerator ever built. "Starting up a
major new particle accelerator takes much
more than flipping a switch," read a CERN
press release marking the occasion.
"Thousands of individual elements have to
work in harmony, timings have to be synchronized to under a billionth of a second,
and beams finer than a human hair have
to be brought into head-on collision."

Tributes from scientists around the
world have been pouring into the
European laboratory, which is comprised
of 20 member states. The U.S. is one of
eight entities that have "observer status."
Frank Moscatelli, a former professor of
Saxon's, said that while he doesn't know
exactly what kind of role Saxon has at
CERN, "they keep inviting him back so
they must like him."
While the research that Saxon is doing
is not directly related to Swarthmore or
any of the professors here, there are plenty of opportunities for research in physics
and other departments that can be had
without leaving campus. If majoring in
physics, for example, a student is "close to
being guaranteed a summer research spot,
if they want it," Moscatelli said. "The vast
majority of faculty do scholarly research
with students, and students have the
opportunity to do it for credit or over the
summer
supported by the college or by
the professor's own research funding.
Many professors have a lot of outside fund...

ing."
According to Saxon, the most famous
objective of the research now being undertaken at the Large Hadron Collider is a
search for the Higgs boson, a search which
will hopefully reveal new information that
could lead to the "completion or reformulation" of the Standard Model for Physics.
Saxon compared the Standard Model to the

Periodic Table of the Elements: "It
describes the building blocks and the
forces that constitute the universe in a relatively concise and largely encompassing
you can build nearly everymanner
thing in the universe mathematically out
...

of this model." The model isn't perfect,

however. The most obvious problem is that
it cannot explain why anything in the universe has mass. A proposed solution to this
gap in the model is the Higgs Boson, which
is the only Standard Model particle that
hasn't been proven to exist, as it has never
been observed.
"The LHC [Large Hadron Collider] will
serve to recreate energies (in an extremely
small space) that may mirror the interactions that we saw back at the very beginning, immediately after the Big Bang, giving us clues to the origins of forces and
particles as we see them today," Saxon
said.
Brig Williams, the Coordinator of Front
End Electronics, ATLAS Experiment and a
at
University
professor
the
of
Pennsylvania said of Saxon: "He's fairly
unusual. Jamie is particularly talented
and broad in his interests. He's made it
easy for us to give him a wide range of
responsibilities."

Saxon spent his junior year at St.
Edmund Hall, Oxford. In addition to the
physics and math he's studied, he's an
honors major in political science.

Former NPR producer joins War News Radio staff
BY ASHIA TROIANO
atroianl@swarthmore.edu

With former War News Radio Director Ayub Nuri's
return to Iraq this year, a new journalist-in-residence,
Abdulla Mizead, has joined the weekly broadcast program. Covering the untold and ignored stories of the Iraq
War is nothing new to Mizead, who is joining the
Swarthmore community after a four year stint at National
Public Radio's Baghdad Bureau since 2003. Prior to that,
Mizead attended the University of Baghdad.
As a citizen and resident of Iraq, Mizead constantly
observed the effects of the war. However, Mizead said that
the mainstream media has been desensitized to the gravity of war. "Stories about the war are six and seven pages
after the headlines in the newspapers. It's not a concern
anymore."

Mizead, who is a self-proclaimed "street guy," said he
takes an approach to journalism that is not typically seen
on the 10 o'clock news. "Working at NPR, features mattered most to me. My main goal is to get people's stories
out there
not just facts and numbers. I would travel
alone and do stories in the actual neighborhoods [and]
find out about agriculture, education, women's issues."
And for the members of WNR, this approach allowed
them to learn new skills and build on what they have
already established. "He's been incredibly helpful finding interviews, editing, just talking with him about his
experiences," Emily Hager 'lO said. Jessica Engebretson
'O9 said that Mizead has been instrumental in developing
the program's content. "He's great at helping us throw
around ideas and think about what we want to put in our
show. He sees stories we wouldn't have noticed,"
Engebretson said.
In fact, Mizead provided much inspiration for WNR's
most recent broadcasts. The group covered the handover
of the Anbar province to Iraqi forces, the celebration of
Ramadan, the outbreak of cholera and a special segment

on the soldiers. "The Words from the Troops segment was
his idea. We never had a piece just for troops [and] it came
together really well," Engebretson said.
Mizead admits to falling into journalism, so to
speak. "In 2003, journalism was nothing I was thinking
of." While walking through the al-Mutanabi Street Book
Market in Baghdad, Mizead saw two NPR journalists,
Deborah Amos and Tom Bullock, interviewing Iraqi citizens about their sentiments towards Iraq's then-recent
fall to America. While most of the responses were positive, Mizead's was not. "I went over to them and said that
this sucked. We were going to be bombarded by parties
promising democracy, but America doesn't have a clue as
to what they're doing. Saddam was bad, but what's coming is worse," Mizead said at the time. And with that fateful meeting, Mizead was offered a job opportunity with
NPR, first as a translator in 2003 and then as a producer
in 2004.
Though he is originally from Iraq, Mizead grew up
internationally. His father's work as a diplomat took the
family to places around the world including the United
Kingdom, Africa, countries in the Middle East and the
United States. When asked if his childhood fed into his
work now, Mizead responded that it has enabled him to
"look at it from multiple perspectives and think of the
other side, which helps you to be as objective as you possibly can."
WNR members said that Mizead offers a perspective
that is missing from the mainstream media. "His depth
and insight about Iraq is something you won't get from
the media," Kristin Caspar 'O9 said.
The members of WNR have found Mizead extremely
valuable to the group in other ways as well. "For one, he
speaks Arabic, which makes a huge difference. None of
the other WNR members speak Arabic, and it really limits our pool to talk to only English-speakers," Engebretson
said.
According to Hansi Lo Wang 'O9, Mizead was referred

Elisa Lopez Phoenix Staff

Abdulla Mizead, who previously worked for NPR, joined
the staff of War News Radio as its journalist-in-residence.
to the job with WNR by Charlie Mayer '9B, who is the
Director of News Operations at NPR. "There were so
many recommendations from NPR saying 'if you don't
hire him, you're crazy,'" Lo Wang said.
Mizead's vision highlights what WNR has started to
develop since its conception in 2005. "One, I want the students to connect with something outside their circle and
two, to keep the story alive
what the people have gone
through. The conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan has a huge
impact on the entire Middle East."

StuCo's anti-oppression workshop encourages communication
BY HAE-IN PARK

hpark6@swarthmore.edu

Student Council hosted its second
annual anti-oppression workshop entitled, "Training for Change" last Saturday,
Sept. 13. The workshop was designed to
facilitate
communication
between
Student Council representatives and
numerous cultural groups around campus. Student Council hosted the workshop, which was also attended by representatives of the Social Affairs Committee
(SAC) and the Student Budget Committee
(SBC).

Representatives from the Intercultural
Center (IC) and the Black Cultural Center
(BCC) were also present at the workshop
to express their concerns over Student
Council's current relationship with cultural groups on campus and to suggest
ways of improving dialogue between

make sure that we're as open as we can
be, and making sure all the students have
access to the StuCo and same amount of
knowledge of different processes that go
on inside it," Educational Policy
Representative of the Student Council
Ayanna Johnson 'O9 said.

"It's problematic to link the
IC/BCC communities
together as some
monolithic group. Similar to
white students, we have a

them.

The first "Training for Change" workshop was organized in Fall 2007, as a
result of the Spring 2007 Student Council
election, during which cultural groups
reacted negatively to a slate of candidates
that they claimed was not representative
of Swarthmore's diverse student body.
After the first workshop was deemed a
success, Student Council decided to make
it an annual tradition. "During the
Student Council election period, the presidential candidates for the student council were deemed as insensitive and not in
touch with IC/BCC groups," co-director of
the Social Affairs Committee Jessica
Hamilton 'O9 said. "This program was
implemented last fall as a way to bridge
the gap." In the past, Student Council has
been criticized for its alleged indifference
to the concerns of IC/BCC groups as well
as the lack of transparency in its decisionmaking mechanisms. "We're trying to

The workshop began with an introduc-

tion to the topic, followed by a skill-building session that focused on strategies for
facilitating inclusive dialogue. "It taught
me that I really need to be proactive and
go to their group meetings and communi-

cate with them for constructive criticism,
so I have already contacted some of the
group meetings so that I can bring their

constructive criticism back to my committee. I really felt that I needed to go out
there rather than just sit here and let
them bring their concerns to us," Student
Budget Committee Manager Fletcher
Coleman 'O9 said.
Cecilia Marquez 'll, the only IC representative who attended the workshop,
explained in an e-mail response that she,
as an individual, could not adequately
represent the collective concerns of the
IC/BCC groups. "Of course, I don't think
that I could ever begin to represent the

huge range of diversity in the IC/BCC
communities. I'm only one person who

has learned so much from everyone in
those communities," Marquez said, also
expressing
concern
over
Student
Council's tendency to conflate the IC and
BCC as a single entity. "I think it's problematic to link the IC/BCC communities
together as some monolithic group.
Similar to white students, we have a large
diversity of opinions and politics, we are
not all the same just because we identify
as of color," Marquez said.
During the workshop, the Student
Council also enumerated the achievements of last year's workshop and outlined its plans for the rest of the year. "We
[the Student Council] agreed with what
Cecilia has said," Johnson said. "We
haven't even talked to all of the 17 IC
groups. We had a meeting the next day
[and] invited the Swarthmore Womyn of
Color Collective (SWOCC) along with
some IC/BCC group members." They discussed various ways of making Student
Council more accessible, including updating its Web site and possibly publishing a
newsletter.
Council representatives said that they
are also considering ways of reaching out
to student organizations who may have
been hesitant to approach them in the
past. "Instead of asking students to come
to our meeting, we also decided to actually make an effort for each member to go
out to meetings of four or five student
organizations," Johnson said.
Johnson said she was confident that
many of Student Council's current members have acquired valuable experience
through their personal involvement with
various cultural groups on campus.
Johnson, who served as outreach coordinator for the Executive Board of the
Swarthmore African-American Student

September IS, 2008

Society (SASS), said that this experience
has helped her related to the concerns of

IC/BCC

groups.

"For SAC, too, going out to the workshop and hearing [IC/BCC groups']
expressions of concern was very helpful.
Since our specific aim is the improvement
of social life on campus, it was really
important to bring all of us into a room.
We will strongly try not to show bias
against any groups and really want to

reach out. For instance, Fletcher and I
will go out to the other groups' meetings,"
Hamilton said.
Coleman agreed with Hamilton's statement, adding that SBC would strive to
make its funding decisions more transparent. "We learned how to understand
these marginal groups having needs outside of the needs of the mainstream
groups, and I felt I should have more personal interaction as well to understand
them, for example, attending their meetings by myself," Coleman said. "I can't
guarantee that I'm going to meet everyone's need, but I can guarantee that I'm
going to make as many changes, as best I
can," he said.
Student Council Vice President Sven
David Udekwu said in an e-mail that
Student Council representatives can
enhance the quality of dialogue on campus by approaching the IC/BCC groups
directly, rather than waiting for these
groups to bring their grievances to the
Council.
"Taking the risk of approaching people
on their own ground, basically wherever
they feel most comfortable, is something
that I think each person here should try
at least once. If welcomed, a person can
gain new insights and relationships that

Panel pursues discussion on reproductive justice
BY ARIEL MARTINO

amartinl@swarthmore.edu

The Reproductive Justice Panel this past Tuesday
drew eighty-five Swatties to a discussion by three panelists on the sexism, racism and classism that pervade
reproductive rights organizations to this day.
The panel featured three speakers: Mia Mingus, one of
the co-executive directors of SPARK Reproductive
Justice Now in Atlanta, Georgia; Kierra Johnson, the
executive director of Choice USA; and Aimee ThorneThomsen, the executive director of the Pro-Choice Public
Education Project.
The discussion centered on the work that the panelists have done in the field of reproductive justice and
ways that students can get involved. All three of the panelists emphasized the breadth of the movement and the
integral role young people play in it. "Reproductive justice is big. It's not a message, or a sound byte or something you put on a poster. It's about people having
power, all the power they need to lead healthy lives,"
Thorne-Thomsen said.
The reproductive rights movement has taken a stance
on reproductive issues, ensuring that women have the
ability to make informed, healthy choices about their
bodies.
However, this stance is somewhat exclusionary in
that it does not address the socioeconomic issues that
prevent minorities, queer people, and people below the
poverty line from making choices in the same way. The
reproductive justice movement combines issues of race,
class, gender, and sexuality to promote equal access to
reproductive rights. "Reproductive justice is a push back
to the reproductive health movement. It's looking at

these issues through a racial lens and a class lens and
how that impacts our strategies," Johnson said.
More than just making sure that reproductive rights
choices exist, the movement focuses on making sure that
the choice is realistic for everyone, Mingus said. She
raised an example of a woman unable to take time off
from work to visit a free clinic. "The choice is there, but
is it just?" Mingus said.

"Reproductive justice is looking at
these issues through a racial lens
and a class lens and how that
impacts our strategies."
Kierra Johnson, executive director

of Choice USA
After the panel, Sable Mensah 11, the moderator of
the event and a board member of the Swarthmore
Womyn of Color Collective, was quick to remind guests,
"this is just step one for understanding the movement."
Claire Galpern 'lO, a member of White Women
Confronting Racism, was one of the driving forces
behind finding the women on the panel. She had gained

some experience in the movement over the summer in
Pittsburgh. "I leaned that the reproductive justice movement looked at reproductive rights in different ways
than traditional reproductive rights movements,"

Galpern said. She also discovered that several reproductive justice leaders would be meeting at a conference
near Swarthmore and had begun to assemble a panel of
"committed, passionate, and dynamic women."
In the future, the sponsoring and co-sponsoring
organizations hope to further the discussion about reproductive justice on campus.
Cecilia Marquez 'll mentioned plans for a panel on
"Queering Reproductive Justice" and the possibility of a
panel about the intersections between Environmental
Justice and Reproductive Justice. "We want to move past
dated views of social justice and talk more critically now
about how past movements have not succeeded and what
our new movements can do to be as inclusive and intersectional as possible," Marquez said.
The organizers were encouraged by the high turnout
at the panel.
"Lots ofexcitement and energy came out of the panel.
People should definitely get in touch with us if they want
to learn more," Galpern said. "I think that the high attendance was students saying these are the types of events
we want on this campus and these are the kinds of conversations we are looking for," Marquez said in an e-mail

after the event.
The event was sponsored by the Swarthmore Womyn
of Color Collective, a new organization on campus, and
co-sponsored by White Women Confronting Racism,
ENLACE, Feminist Majority, Deshi, Class Activists,
VOX, and Swarthmore Asian Organization with help
from the Forum for Free Speech, the President's Office,
the Intercultural Center, the Black Cultural Center,
Black Studies, Peace and Conflict Studies, Gender and
Sexuality Studies, and the Sociology/Anthropology
Department.

Change in RIAA policy cracks down on file sharing
In the Reserved Students Digest for
Friday, Sept. 12, there was a notice
about a change to the policy for what to
do to students who were caught illegally sharing files through the Internet.
The new policy states that students
caught in the act of illegal file sharing
may have their personal computers
blocked from the college network for a
minimum of seven days.
Representatives of Information
Technology Services, the Dean's Office,

I

student focus groups and Student
Council have unanimously decided on
a policy that they believe will enforce
the idea that illegal file sharing is both
risky and dangerous without causing
considerable unease among the student
body. Previously, when a student was
caught engaged in illegal file sharing,
he/she was notified by the college to
take down the .illegal files and was
given ten days to do so.
Now, the student must notify the
Chief Information Technology Officer
of an error or file a Fair Use claim within three days. The student will not be
able to access the network on that student's computer for a minimum of one
week, if no mistake has been reported
and no Fair Use claim has been filed.
However, the student will still be
able to access the Internet and tools
such as Blackboard and Swatmail on
public computers.
According to Gayle Barton, "The
recent change is due to a new law
passed by Congress that requires colleges to do more to prevent illegal file
sharing. Our old procedures .were not
very effective and they did not meet the
spirit orrequirements of the new law."
This may be an inconvenience to
many students on campus who are
caught and are accustomed to using

L

their own computers. Nevertheless, the
new policy was not set forth in order to
make the lives of students harder, ITS
dorm consultant manager Robert
Matthews 'O9 said. "We don't want to be
nannies," he said.
And although the new policy may be
a pain for students, it is also a pain for
ITS. Myrt Westphal, the Associate Dean
for Student Life, mentioned the inefficiency of the routine ITS goes through
to handle the situation. It is a pain, she
said, to have to spend time looking up
the student who committed the violation, contact the student, and then have
to wait for up to three days to receive
notice.
But perhaps it's not so bad compared to the policies of some other colleges and universities. "Some schools
are taking stronger measures such as
imposing fines, limiting bandwidth for
file sharing, or blocking certain protocols," Barton said. And if it will help to
prevent illegal file sharing, then all the
better. Since the beginning of this
school year, Swarthmore has already
received three complaints about illegal,
file sharing from different associations.
Westphal finds the issue to be agebased. "Many young people think [file
sharing is] perfectly acceptable," she
said. Perhaps this has to do with the
ease in which it can be done. In the
past, copying media illegally took more
time and energy. One could, for example, take a cassette tape, record it, and
distribute it covertly. Now, she said,
illegal file sharing can be done instant-

Within the past few months, Brooklyn-based
garage-punk band Vivian Girls has sold out the entire
first pressing of their self-titled debut LP, signed to In
the Red and opened for Sonic Youth. I got a chance to
catch up with Cassie, Katy and Ali before they opened
up for O’Death at Olde Club last Friday; here’s what
they had to say.
Anna Zalokostas: So, how’s In the Red?
Cassie: In the Red is awesome! Larry’s the best
dude, he’s like a surfer
sort of.
Katy: He sounds like a surfer on the phone, I talked
to him last night.
Cassie: This band went to his house at noon one
day and they said he was wearing a robe and drinking
a martini and smoking a cigar. No, wait, he wasn’t
wearing a robe, he was wearing sunglasses
inside
of his house, at noon, drinking a martini.
AZ: He sounds very cool. Could you guys talk a little bit about the process of writing the record?
Cassie: We wrote it continuously over the first
eight months we were a band. We wrote a few songs a
month, more or less and the LP was basically just a
compilation of every song we wrote because we just
had no other songs.
AZ: Well, the songs work really well together. I
mean, I at least feel like they make up a pretty cohesive
whole.
Cassie: Well, thanks. The way that we organized
the LP was that we kind of made the first side songs
about being in love and stuff and the second side were
songs about being depressed.
AZ: What have you guys been listening to lately?

Katy: Cassie and her boyfriend got me ShangriLa’s record for my birthday the other day.
Ali: I just downloaded the MP3s from the Times
New Viking record on my iPod.
Cassie: I’ve been listening to a lot of Nirvana and
Kate Bush and Hall and Oats.
AZ: I listened to so much Nirvana over the summer.
Cassie: We listen to “Nevermind” on tour every-

hoping someone will walk in. So, what are you guys
doing next?
Cassie: We recorded

a seven inch and we’re going

to limit it to 1,000 and we’re going to send out packages
with like, a seven inch, a t-shirt, two postcards and a
button. We’re going to silkscreen everything ourselves. So we’re going to probably release that around
December on the Internet; it’s going to be cool!

day.
Ali: I wrote a love song about Kurt Cobain the
other day. It rules. About how we would be totally in
love if he weren’t dead.
Cassie: Dude, I know, I think about that so much.
AZ: So how was playing the last pool party ever?
Katy; Amazing!

Cassie: The best ever. After the show we were all
hanging out backstage and Lee Ranaldo came up to
me and he was like, “Your band is really good” and I
was like, “Your band is really good” and then I gave

him my business card. And then this photographer
walked by, and Lee Ranaldo was like, “Hey, take my
picture with Cassie.” And I felt so cool.
Ali; It was one of the best shows of my life.
Cassie: Thurston Moore called me over and was
like, “Hey Cassie, tell me about your tattoos!”
Anna: Oh yeah, let’s talk about tattoos!
Katy: Well, Cassie and I have a milkshake and a
burger for New Jersey diners.
Ali: And I have coffee cups for New Jersey diners.
AZ: I love New Jersey diners, I worked at New
Jersey diner over the summer.
Cassie: I was a waitress at a New Jersey Diner for
like, one night, and it was really boring.
AZ: Yeah, no one really comes in at night, there are
just long extended periods of like, glancing at the door

was absolutely raucous, which came
as a direct result of O’Death’s unique,
rousing style of music. It is very likely
that you’ve never heard anything like
them before: their music is a hodgepodge of old-timey country, fierce
punk and dreamy folk.
“The show was better than my

“Olde Club was jam packed, people

were actually dancing and crowd surfing and the band broke half their shit.

O'Death headlined the first Olde Club

This past weekend, Olde Club came
alive with the jangling of banjos, the
pounding of bass, the clashing of
drums and the wailing of a very bearded man, compliments of O’Death, the
headliner of the first Olde Club show
of the Fall 2008 semester. The show

of college gigs and they usually suck,”
vocalist Greg Jamie said. “College
shows tend to be very dry and unenergetic, but this show was great."
As intimidating and morose as
their name may sound, O’Death is
actually a tremendously kind and
interesting group of guys out to make
meaningful music. “I think that young
people are afraid to listen to us,”
Jamie said, “because it sounds like
we’re a bunch of old dudes doing boring things, but we’re not really. We’re
a bunch of old dudes, but we’re not
boring.” So where did the angrysounding name come from? “The
name has been used mostly in songs...
it’s public domain,” Pycior explained.

September 18, 2006

“It’s been used in blues songs, it’s been
used in old country songs, old gospel,
literature it’s just kind of the idea of

death.”
So this is a band of often shirtless
and primarily bearded “old dudes,” a

personalizing

band that makes music that completely transcends genre. One might won-

der who their influences are and
what is playing on their iPods.
The list is as varied and eclectic as
O’Death’s instrumental line-up: Hall &
Oats, electronica band Stardust, “certain David Bowie” (i.e., Ziggy
Stardust), Motown, the album “Dirt”
by Alice in Chains, Os Mutantes, Bob
Dylan, Tom Waits, The Eisley
Brothers and the Pixies.
When it
comes to performing their own music,
Pycior and Jamie said that newer
songs are the most exciting to play but
that “Fire On Peshtigo” from their
“Broken Hymns, Limbs and Skin” EP
is one of their favorites to perform
live. “Every time we play it I’m like,
this is a great song!” Jamie said.
Even if you missed the concert, listening to O’Death could be a worthwhile endeavor, especially for those
disenchanted with the current indie
music scene
their sound is both
haunting and familiar and will pull
you right in, so don’t be afraid to check
out their latest album, “Lowtide,” in
stores October 28 and see for yourself
exactly what “Appalachian-folk-rockgypsy-punk” sounds like.

onto the gallery wall. Leaving his works in this
unguarded state, the artist implies his trust in his

audience. He welcomes and encourages the view-

ELENA SMITH

Arts in the Area
Walking into a gallery or museum can often
feel like entering a sacred space. Like reverential
objects, works of art are enshrined behind beams
of heavenly light and protected from
sacrilege/damage by the shield of frames. A clear
hierarchy is established
viewers must show
respect to art, obeying the demands of conservation.
A gentler, more intimate spirituality permeates “Nakazora: space between earth and sky,” a
site-specific installation of photographs on view
at the Print Center. Masao Yamamoto, a Japanese
artist, avoids the holier-than-thou attitude of
much creative expression and encourages a closer bond between viewer and art in two ways.
First, the small size of Masao’s black-andwhite landscapes, nudes, and still lifes requests
intimate physical relationships. The photos average 2 x 3 to 3 x 5 inches, but one was as small as
3/4 x 1 inch. At this miniature scale, viewers are
forced to walk very close to the images, sometimes hovering just fractions of an inch away to
discern discrete details.
Secondly, Masao eliminates the glass frame as
a barrier, electing to paste his images directly

THE PHOENIX

er's approach.
Without frames, artwork is subject to damage
from elements in the air and oil marks of gesturing fingers. While some artists seek to immortalize their creations through modern conservation
techniques, the process of aging and wear is central to Masao's creative process.
Masao dyes black-and-white photographs with
tea, yellowing images for an antiquated feel. He
subjects images to tears and folds, usually relegated to the perimeter. He carries photos in his
pockets to create "natural" demarcations of wear.
In previous exhibitions, Masao even allowed
viewers to directly handle his photographs,
accepting the physical consequences of this deci-

sion.
Untitled #955 is typical of Masao's technique.
The 4x4 inch gelatin silver print, originally
printed in black-and-white, is yellowed from the
stains of tea leaves. A discrete tear begins at the
bottom of the photograph and continues up the
left arm. Slightly out of focus, the blurred photo
speaks of distant memory.
Photographs may be inanimate objects, but
Masao's aging techniques remind us that art has
a life of its own. Though Untitled #955 may not
breathe like its subjects, a human and a bird, it
endures trials and ages just like organic beings.
The distressed condition bears the index of
Masao. After the moment of conception (the second when Masao snaps the image), the artist exercises his control. Masao develops the negatives
and expedites the aging process. He also bestows
new life to his photographs through new juxtapositions, arranging the photos differently in each
gallery space.

"Nakazora" is an ongoing series that began
eight to nine years ago. It contains about six
thousand images, two-thirds of which are spread
out all over the world in art institutions and collectors' homes. About 50 images are displayed at

the Print Center.
Masao prepares for each showing of
"Nakazora" in a unique way. Upon learning the
size of a gallery space, he creates a mock-up of the

September 18, 2005

room with a thin Japanese paper. He spontaneously selects photos and composes the arrangement on the paper, often noticing connections
between individual works after the process is
completed.
After finishing this exercise, Masao cuts holes
where each image rests. He rolls up his papers,
takes them to the gallery, and lays the sheets
down on the gallery walls. Using his template as
a guide, he recreates his studio installation exactly as envisioned previously.
At the Print Center, Masao divides his photos
into seven groupings. Some are small, containing
only two or three pictures, while others include

as many as twenty.

His compositions defy dominant trends in
gallery installation. His photos do not parade
across the wall at eye level. Instead, Masao takes
advantage of the entire wall space, placing images
from the ceiling all the way down to the floor.
The exhibition demands physical interaction
from the viewer, requiring that one bend down or
stand on tippy-toes.
Through Masao's installation method, the

white-washed walls become a part of the exhibition rather than a backdrop. Photographs communicate with one another across the wall space.
An elegant image of a cascading waterfall, for
example, sits directly two feet above a photo of a
fire with rising smoke. The downward-moving
water can be imagined to meet the mounting
smoke halfway, intersecting on the white wall.
The elements collide; the water will extinguish
the fire.
"Nakazora" promises not to disappoint.
Masao creates a new experience for the seasoned
gallery visitor through His unique installation
method. During the opening reception, Masao
noted that he hopes each visitor will walk away
with a different interpretation of the exhibition.
Through the intriguing composition of his
beautiful photographs, Masao has accomplished
his goal.
"Nakazora: space between earth and sky" will
be on display through Nov. 26. at the Print Center,
1614 Latimer St., Philadelphia.

bearing on reality at this point in time. The
lack of online releases is largely due to the
current policies of the global major label
music industry. Clinging to a ship that is

record companies such as Sony and Warner

In the fall of 2007, Radiohead released its
"In Rainbows" amidst a
maelstrom ofmedia coverage. The majority
of the press was not interested so much in
the quality of the album but rather in the
band's choice to release it digitally and
without a set price. Fans could simply go
online, download "In Rainbows" in MP3 format and pay any (or no) amount for ten
tracks.
Although Radiohead's stunt was lauded
as revolutionary progress for the music
industry, it is ultimately unclear what the
motivationbehind the Internet release was.
Lead singer Thorn Yorke spoke poetically
about the value of music and a returned

emphasis on the personal exchange
between artist and listener. The band had,
however, just ended its contract with EMI,
an aged music industry giant forever
immortalized in the words of the Sex
Pistols: "Blind acceptance is a sign / of stupid fools who stand in line / like EMI."

Radiohead had little choice but to strike out
on its own while framing the release in the
positive light of independence.
Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame
slammed the group for employing a cheap
marketing trick to drive up the CD sales of
"In Rainbows," which was released in a
physical format a few months later. Reznor
then proceeded to offer two Nine Inch Nails
albums digitally in a variety of download
formats and for a variety of prices.
But, in the long run, none of this back
story really matters. Yorke's musical philosophy and Reznor's quibbling do not matter. What is important is the silence that followed and the fact that no other relatively
mainstream (yes, Radiohead and Nine Inch
Nails are mainstream) artist chose to put an
album up for sale on the Internet at a negotiable price. Okay, Michael Jackson may
have released a digital album without major
label backing but I am not sure if anything

youth. Indeed, it appears that he has an
entire process planned for wooing students

e-mail evely Swarthmore student received
at the beginning of the semester?) as
opposed to finding viable alternatives.
Allowing listeners to name their own price
for albums takes a considerable amount of
economic power away from record companies and may ultimately make theirrole as
an intermediary between artists and consumers obsolete.
In my opinion, it is not fair to blame only
the music industry for the lack of cheap,
easily accessible and legal online music. In
many ways I think that we as listeners are
not entirely ready for digital music to
become the norm. On the one hand, there is

the ever-present whisper of nostalgia and
tradition in our ears. Although many people
use services such as iTunes or download
music illegally via P2P networks, I am
unsure if the act of downloading can yet
replace the feeling of going to the record
store and buying a new album. Can clicking
a button be as satisfying as tearing violently at a CD's impossible shrink wrap in anticipation of the musical happiness to come?
On the other hand, there is the job market to consider. Perhaps nobody but me and

economics majors think about these things,
but what happens to those who work for
major labels at various levels to put out
music in the physical form of a CD? I imagine that if the music industry shifts its focus
to the Internet, there will be a massive
upheaval in terms of jobs as new skills are
needed to market music to the world.
Still, those are my own simplified and
slightly muddled concerns about the future
of the record industry. I will also share with
you two equally simplified and muddled
benefits that we stand to gain if releasing
albums online and perhaps at negotiable
prices becomes standard practice for mainstream artists. First, our environmental
smugness will greatly increase. If the physical CD ceases to dominate the music market, the need for the production of plastic
jewel cases, paper inserts and the übiquitous shrink wrap will decrease significantly. It's hard to argue with lowering our
dependency on paper and mass-produced
synthetic materials. Second, online distribution has the potential to make music
more accessible to listeners and to expose
artists to a broader base. Imagine being able
to find the albums you want whenever you
want without the RIAA hovering over your
shoulder and threatening you, a hapless
Swarthmore student, with lawsuits; now
that's a future I can believe in.

JOEL SWANSON
They're Watching
There are probably few more loathsome
literary archetypes than the lonely, alienat-

ed heterosexual male chauvinist who
views women not as actual humans with
their own desires, but as mere objects on
which to project his own unrealized longings and desires. This figure, seen in works
everywhere
to
Hemingway
from
Bukowski, is rarely able to find any real
contentment or companionship in life and
is generally left searching for an elusive
happiness thatis perpetually beyond grasp.
"Elegy," a recent film by Spanish director
Isabel Coixet,, considers the pitfalls of such
a character, but despite strong performances from the actors and actresses, the film
ultimately proves too problematic to leave
a positive lasting impression.
"Elegy," based upon the Philip Roth
novella "The Dying Animal," tells the story
of David Kepesh, an aging professor of literature and sometime public intellectual,
played with appropriate ennui by Ben
Kingsley. Kepesh is unable to maintain any
lasting relationships with the women to
whom he is attracted and instead spends
his life moving hedonistically from one
object of desire to the next, not stopping to
form any real emotional attachment to any
of them. We learn that he was married
once, during the 19605, but that he abandoned his wife and young son to pursue
fleeting relationships with other women;
he later claims to his son that this was the
only honest option he had available at the
time. When the film opens up, he is in a
fairly long-term romantic rendezvous with
a mistress whom he met under shady circumstances, but there is no evidence that
their relationship consists of anything
deeper thansimply meeting once every few
weeks for sex.
Kepesh's world changes with the arrival
of Consuela Castillo (Penelope Cruz), a student in one ofhis literature classes. At first,
he seems to view her as nothing more than

September 18, 2008

in his classes after their grades have been
handed in, as a means of socializing with
students in whom he has taken a prurient
interest. He is not shy about why he is
doing this; he tells the viewers through narration that he is merely speaking to
Castillo at this party because he wants to
have sex with her. Soon after, the two
develop a sort ofromantic relationship, but
for most of the time, he seems to view her
as nothing more than a statue for him to
admire and use: When she shows any signs
of having desires of her own, he becomes
intensely jealous and tries to follow her
around to make sure she is not having any
outside relationships
all the while maintaining his liaison with his longtime mistress. Such jealousy and disregard
inevitably leads to the breakup of their
relationship, but by the end of the movie,
Kepesh has begun to show signs that for the
first time in his life, he has learned to genuinely have feelings for someone as a

unique individual.
The problem with all of this is that we
are supposed to feel sympathy for Kepesh
as someone who is desperately clinging to
his lost youth and is unable to come to
terms with his rapidly encroaching mortality. His attempts to form such connection
with others, even if purely carnal in
nature, are supposed to be if not laudable at
least understandable. But it is difficult to
feel much sympathy for a man who has
obviously tossed aside any such chances
for genuine human connection in favor of a
chauvinistic, phallocentric view of interpersonal relations. We know very little
about his relationship with his former

wife, but his selfish, disdainful interactions
with his son seem to indicate little desire to
work for any meaningful familial relationships. His interactions with women are
marked by a complete lack of any regard
for their needs and desires. It is his own
selfishness and inability to consider
Castillo's needs and wants that dooms his
relationship with her. I found myself
spending much of the movie wishing she
would leave him sooner.
Thus, in the end, "Elegy" is a film that is
easy to admire but difficult to connect with
or enjoy. We spend nearly two hours watching the protagonist sabotage any efforts we
might make to extend him any understanding. Ultimately, Kepesh is simply a pitiful
man, too blinded by his own sexism to ever
attain happiness in this life and too selfish
to ever assume the responsibilities necessary to grow up and maintain adult relationships. Beneath every male chauvinist
is a sniveling, overgrown shell of a boy.

Calling it “Parrish Beach” is kind of cruel, isn’t it? It’s a
nice stretch of lawn, but calling it a beach has certain
implications; the smell offresh ocean salt, the sand and the
cigarette butts between one’s toes. And the beautiful people. Their bodies are lean and muscular, tight red spandex
restraining the wobbly parts. Their skin is golden brown
and just slightly crispy, like a perfectly roasted marshmallow.
A comparison might be made, incidentally, between the
marshmallow and the physique of the average Swarthmore

absence of conventionally attractive people at Swarthmore.
I think our supposed ugliness is partially exaggerated and
partially a self-fulfilling prophecy and that anyways each of
us is on the inside a beautiful and compelling snowflake or
something and that’s what’s really important. But slowly
over the course of a semester a startling metamorphosis
takes place, like a butterfly’s wings wilting into its back
before it collapses into a caterpillar. Acne and eczema
spread like crimson plastic soldiers in a particularly onesided game of Risk. Our skin takes on cadaverous hues and
any muscular residue breaks down. Our hair achieves the
texture and consistency of an Alaskan wildlife refugee after
eight years of conservative administration. The cumulative effect is not unlike watching a slideshow ofhuman evolution in reverse, with the modem human degenerating
back into an unshaven, lice-ridden ape and then into some
kind of amphibious squirrel. Swarthmore is the picture of
Dorian Gray of American education; we wither and rot
away in someone’s attic while the studentsof other schools
thrive, their sins never disrupting their eternal hotness.
Some blame must also be placed, unfortunately, on the

THE PHOENIX

college itself. Although the fitness requirements are wellintentioned, 15 minutes of treading water followed by four
semesters of Sino-Indian yoga-chorus folk circle-dancing is
not enough to ensure perpetual wellness. One must also
consider the meal plan, apparently designed to prevent students from ever actually consuming food, encouraging us
to hoard every available calorie like a precious gem.
However, conscientious students can find healthy alternatives; the famous Phoenix breakfast sandwiches, for example, contain only 45 percent of the daily recommended
value for saturated fats and only two percent of the same
for flesh-eating bacteria. Ultimately it is the student who
fails and neglects exercise and the student who must carry
this burden on stringy, poorly-developed deltoids.
The Mullan Tennis Center, presumably named for its
controversial policies with regards to cross-dressing and
Hun invaders, is the last and best hope in their pursuit of
total jacked-ness. Unfortunately it is a bewildering and terrifying place, bristling with Rube Goldbergesque exercise
contraptions. They look like the offspring of lawnmowers
and hamster aquariums; they are like the sensitive modern versions of medieval torture devices. Entering the
gym, one is overwhelmed by the premonition that these
infernal machines might at any moment reconfigure their

component parts, sprout bladed laser mandibles and
attempt to murder Shia Lebouf. Don't be fooled by the
ample red-leather padding and the clear, friendly diagrams
of stick figures having their arms broken. These machines
exist for one reason and for one reason only; to cause you
pain. Pain in the most extraordinary quantities. Pain in a

horrible rainbow offlavors and collectible colors, and all of
the colors are the color of death.
You will leave the gym in agony, your body contorted
and twisted like a one-person Kama Sutra. But over the
course of hundreds of hours of meaningless suffering you
will achieve something remarkable. You will be healthy,
slim, your bodily fluids permanently tainted with strains of
granular artificial protein (protein that will nurture and
nourish you; protein like mother's milk, like ambrosia, at
only $49.99 a barrel). And, most importantly, you will be
totally the new hotness. You will be crowded with
Swarthmore admirers of several genders, orientations and
species; they will clutch at you with horny fingers, teeth
bared like those of a supplicant orangutan, in a fervor so
great that they would tear the flesh from your body and lick
at your bones with sandpaper tongues.
I am unsure if that last sentence was intended to be erotic or carnivorous. At this point I wonder if there is any
meaningful difference between the two.
I conclude that I myself am unworthy of such a program; although those of you who choose to follow that
noble path, to achieve excruciating pain and to win the
affections of cannibalistic Smeagols, are welcome to do so.
As for myself, I will continue my rigorous fitness regimen
of Wii tennis, vodkalunches and insomnia. Should I perish
as a result of this, felled by muscular atrophy or terminal
carpal tunnel syndrome, perhaps that is as God intends.

summer?
Well, the answer is not all that surprising. They were
lots of it. Last semester, just as Wren
recording music
Elhai ’OB put the finishing touches on Studio B, WSRN’s
adjunct recording studio, an overflow of talent came in to
record. Now equipped with a computer, professional software, microphones and even pop filters, the studio can
accommodate almost any type of set-up. Ben Bradlow ’OB,
Sergio Rivas 10, Pat Kolodgy ’O9, a cappella group Sixteen
Feet and even yours truly ventured up to the fourth floor
of Parrish to record. Though Studio B’s musical renaissance began last semester, it only flowered over the summer.
I should not play totally ignorant; I had heard Woody
Jiang ’O9 was recording over the summer. In fact, he
received a grant through the music department to finish
working on a rock album. And with the help of some
friends who were also on campus, he was able to record
most of that album. While Woody handled guitar, drum
samples and vocals, Dan Perelstein ’O9 played the bass.
According to Woody, “I am going for a polished radio
rock/pop sound
just short of glossy.” “Not the One,” a
single from the album, lives up to that promise. It’s a pensive rocker that incorporates Eno-like atmospherics as
well as a smoking solo that Woody amazingly said was still
being revised. The summer had given him some serious
timeto contemplate the rock “I lived in Parrish, the only
thing I had to do was cook for myself’
but the album is
still unfinished and will probably not come out until next
year. One song, yet to be released, was a collaboration with
Charles Inniss ’O9, another regular at Studio B.
I met Charles after a long day casting for his new musical, “Written in the Stars.” Though he seemed drained, he
was strong enough to last a few minutes for a short interview. Through aother music department grant, Charles
was also able to record a solo album this summer. He wrote
and produced four tracks as part of a nine-song EP.
Adamantly opposed to a full-length album (“one single for
seventeen tracks”), he appreciates this older model.
Unfortunately, “the downside is people don’t buy EPs.”
As I spoke to Charles I realized how this EP was indicative of an appreciation for all things classic; he mentions
Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as influences, for example. He expects the album to be “summery.” One of the
songs will be a “FAME Theme,” obviously inspired by his
old band, The Funky Ass Mother Fuckers. In fact, much of
the old band is part ofhis new album, including Perelstein
on bass and Harrison Russin ’O9 on keyboards. While
recording this album, he also worked on “Written in the
Stars,” which he wrote and is now directing. His work on
the album will continue after the musical wraps this
autumn. The very prolific Charles Inniss plans to release
the album by the summer of 2009.
When I visited the studio, Patrick Kolodgy ‘O9, general
manager of WSRN, gave me an overview of the project’s
progress, “The space is here. It is definitely done to the
extent that you can do pretty sophisticated stuff in here.”
Now the only concern is “framing enough engineers to
handle requests for sessions.”
Patrick himself is also working on an album “Ronk ng
Rool,” much of which he created here at the studio.
Influenced by punk and 10-fi music, Patrick’s band
Handglops creates noisy pop. He played me “Teenagers in
the Weekend,” which sounded a bit like Half Japanese with
an indelibly noisy edge. The album will come out on an
independent label sometime before year’s end, but the
details are not yet settled.
As summer turns to winter and the station at the top of
Parrish cools from its 100 degree average, more musicians
will come to record. Already, Olde Club opener Vivian
Girls recorded a set in Studio B and believe it or not, they
sounded pretty good. In fact, most musicians who record
up there are sounding pretty good. Call it luck or call it
magic, but the studiohas the power to be something bigger
than big as the secret gets out and the sessions start to pile
up this year.

Instability in Pakistan poses problems for America
While speaking at Bryn Mawr College last March, former
Secretary of State Madeline Albright identified one country
as the probable nexus of coming international instability:
Pakistan. In the months since her speech, Ms. Albright's prediction has come to seem more and more like the tragic reality of the region. Pakistan's economy has collapsed and it
remains a breeding ground for Islamist militants. Its neighbor and cohort in calamity, Afghanistan, has regressed from
an optimistic postwar democratic bonanza circa 2002 into a
sectarian free-for-all. It has come to seem increasingly likely
that both countries will not escape from the Foreign Policy
index offailed states.
Yet, in the face of impending disaster, the government of
the United States has approached the issue from precisely
the wrong angle. We have relied exclusively on brandishing
the stick of American military might at a fragile regime, in
the hopes of convincing it to hand over the al-Qaida agents it
is supposedly harboring.
This strategy is doomed to failure for several reasons.
First, destabilizing the already precarious presidency of
Asif Zardari can only lead to more problems. Mr. Zardari is
presently juggling a cornucopia of problems: a distrustful
military, volatile public opinion and an impatient America,
just to name a few. If one of these parties turns its back on
Zardari's administration, it stands little chance of recovering. As has been Pakistan's habit, the collapse of a democratically elected regime results in the rise to power of a cataclysmic military autocracy. Years of Pervez Musharraf
have taught the world that this is an unacceptable option.
Second, unilateral American action brings its own set of
negative consequences, not only for Pakistanbut alsofor the
United States. While it is difficult to criticize the result of the
Jul. 30 bombing of a compound close to the Afghan border in
Pakistan, which led to the death of Midhat Mursi As-Sayid
Umar, an Al Qaeda chemical weapons expert, it would be
shortsighted to peg it as an all-out success.

For one, the United States claims to have already killed
Abu Khabab, as Sayid Umar is known, once in January of
2006. But more problematically, unilateral action is leading
to fear, rather than relief, on the part of Pakistanis. The
Pakistani press flew off the handle in light of the American
bombing, claiming that American incursions into Pakistan
without Pakistani permission will contribute to more antiAmerican sentiment, the expansion of militant groups, and,
as seems to be the case with every action one might take in
the region, the collapse of Mr. Zardari's government.
Privately, a senior government official told The New York
Times that continued American strikes would lead to
"chaos."

Unilateral American action brings
its own set of negative
consequences, not only for
Pakistan but also for
the United States.
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, who
has largely been given a free pass on the "warmongering"
charge, is on precisely the wrong side of this issue. Speaking
in Afghanistan in July, Mr. Obama remarked that if the
United States possesses "actionable intelligence against
high-value Al Qaeda targets, and the Pakistani government
was unwilling to go after those targets," the United States
military should take action on its own. Senator Obama's
tough talk in regards to Pakistan, which has been echoed by
the considerably more hawkish John McCain, has done little but frighten the already skittish Pakistani population.

The answer, instead, is to look to what the real causes of
Pakistan's ills are and how the United States might act to
solve them. Without question, the problem at the top of the
list is Pakistan's economy. While Americans are loathe to
hear about the financial woes of a far removed country in
light of this week's stock market washout, the bankruptcy of
investment bank Lehman Brothers is insignificant in comparison to last month's 24 percent inflation rate in Pakistan.
The financial reserves of the Pakistani government are slated to last another two months before petering out, taking
with them the country's supply of imported food and fuel.
And however significant the slides in the American stock
market might be, the Karachi Stock Exchange, which has
lost approximately 40 percent of its value in the last three
months, is doing worse.
While Americans are rightfully hesitant to throw money
at international problems, there may be no better option in
the case of Pakistan. Mr. Zardari's lenders of choice, the
Asian Development Bank and World Bank, have withheld
much-needed bailouts until Zardari's government proves
itself to be reliable. But Pakistan, and in a broader sense, the
region, may not have enough time to wait. Oil and food need
to keep flowing into Pakistan and its government needs to
remain solvent. The only way that is going to happen is with
American aid.
For better or worse, the government of Asif Zardari is
Pakistan's best hope for a return to normalcy. And more significantly, he represents the world's best hope for a successful fight against Al Qaeda. Instead of attacking suspected terrorists in Pakistan itself, stretching our already overextended military even further and raising the ire ofPakistani citizens, the United States needs to persuade Mr. Zardari's government to step up to its obligation to regional security. The
Pakistani military is the best equipped force to rout out terrorists within its own borders. The only question now is how
to persuade it to do its job.

Faltering American economy needs more than bureaucracy

Fits of Rage
$407 billion. That, according to a recent article

in the
is the

Washington Post written by Lori Montgomery,
expected federal budget deficit for the end of this budget
year. Said deficit will comprise an astounding 3 percent
of the GDP of the United States. Given' that the next
administration will inherit an even larger deficit, the
nation finds itself at a crossroads.
The state of the economy is bleak, and increasingly
looks poised for a recession due to the languishing of
Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, the bailouts of
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Bear Stearns, a still cooling housing market, and the slowing of global growth.
The nation cannot afford to stand by idly as economic

growth grinds to a halt, and the lack of Congressional and
Executive leadership has set the nation on a course of
failure. Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have
done enough to promote fiscal responsibility at a time
when the nation needs it most. Ineptness by Congress to
in controlling the purse strings of our nation has led us
into this mess.
The reauthorization of runaway spending habits on
foreign conflicts, the nationalizationof failing firms, and
tax breaks for the people who need them the least have all
contributed to this dismal economic situation.
Furthermore, the stimulus packages passed by
Congress are only a quick fix for larger problems within
our economy. Such ploys lure Americans into a false
sense of monetary security and redirect attention away
from the real problems that our economy faces.
But bait and switch legislative measures are not
enough, now or ever. The smoke and mirrors game that
Congress has played with American tax dollars will only
perpetuate the damages done to our federal checkbook
because the nation cannot spend responsibly without
knowing its assets. We must demand that Congress and
the Executive Branch once again align their spending
habits with the reality of our budget.
The same demands must also be placed on the candidates for the presidency, who have both had the audacity
to promise economic schemes of grandeur without clearly defining sources of funding for their proposals.
One has promised to make permanent the tax cuts put
in place by the Bush administration, thus ensuring the
continued growth of the wealth gap and relying on trickle-down policies to cover any budgetary shortfalls for
already ailing government institutions. The other has
promised to increase taxes on the top income brackets,
yet has announced plans for the expansion of government

You pause,
burrito in hands and bite. It isn't Chipotle, but it does force
you into one of the running debates on American excess
and emissions. What have you done? Your acquaintance,
however impolite, has done his homework. In 2006, two
University of Chicago professors conducted a study on the
greenhouse gasses emitted to support different diets.
Vegetarianism not surprisingly came in first, with the
smallest carbon footprint required to feed one person. A
diet including poultry was next, and then the "mean
American diet," a little of everything (think food pyramid),
and virtually tied for last were fish diets and red meatheavy diets. The geophysicists who conducted the survey
compared eating red meat frequently to driving an SUV.
The basic science behind these findings lay in the transfer of energy from one level of the food chain to the next.

At the bottom are autotrophic producers, like plants,
which combine inorganic resources with an energy source
(the sun). Herbivores like cows eat these producers, and
carnivores eat, among many other things, beef burritos.
Generally, only about ten percent of one trophic level's
energy is passed on to the next. The rest is used for homeostasis, becomes poop, or goes toward body parts undesirable to carnivorous Americans. Also worth mentioning is

16

the refrigeration required to transport and keep most types
of meat. Therefore, to consume the most energy efficient
diet humans would have to relinquish their cherished
perch at the top of the food chain and eat exclusively primary producers.
Before you guiltily put the burrito down and offer a mea
culpa, however, you should place the issue in context. One

consideration is that raising livestock can play an integral

part in an ecologically conscious farm. After all, we have
so many wholesome veggies only because cows so charitably donate the manure required to provide crops with lots

of nitrogen. This does not offset the undeniable inefficiency of energy transfer, but it's something to think about.
More importantly, you might argue with renewed conviction that livestock has become something of a whipping
boy, in the race to make America more "green." The
adverse impact on global warming is only the most recent
addition to the slew of reasons
it's cruel, it's unhealthy,
it makes you smell bad for which we are told we should
not eat meat. Is your acquaintance simply rehashing his
old frustration with your eating habits? •
The key here is that livestock remains just one piece in
the puzzle (but one that has an already contentious mantle). What if you had sat down at Sharpies, introduced
yourself as a native of suburban DC, and were promptly
berated for your presumed excessive driving? Ifa vegetarian can tell a beefeater off, shouldpedestrian urbanites be
able to attack car owners with impunity? (You don't have
to live in the suburbs...) Or should the student recently
back from study abroad find herself accosted over her
emissions-heavy air travel?
Yes, the science supports the vegetarians. But the
UnitedStates is a rich country, and therefore we have a lot
of ecologically unfriendly luxuries. We drive cars, use air
conditioners, eat what we want, travel frequently and to
distant places, and our homes are big and at times superfluous. We are all guilty of polluting the planet, so let's not
claim righteousness because we abstain from one such
inculpating practice (although kudos if you do).
If you choose to be ecologically conscious, as we all
should be, then you can do it in your own way. Don't eat
meat? Great! If you do, maybe cut it back a little, remember to turn your fan offwhen you leave the room, and simply forgo all dubious looking burritos.

services through the formation of several new bureaucracies.
Practically speaking, the cold, hard facts about the
budget will hit either candidate upon entering office on
January 20, 2009 and their plans will prudently be scaled
back. But the fact that they are making of empty economic promises right now, without any substantial consideration of the actual fiscal conditions and effects of
such plans on average Americans, shows an astonishingly dangerous lack of economic foresight for the nation.
The creative accounting required for either candidate's
plans is not much different than that employed by Arthur
Anderson for Enron. With the candidates praying that
borrowed money from other sections of the government
will be enough, both plans will exacerbate our monetary
woes beyond any level yet attained by our current administration
What the nation needs from its next commander-inchief is thoughtful leadership, preceded by a reevaluation
of American priorities. Such leadership has been hard to
come by in the past eight years, but whoever leads for the
next four.years must commit to making tough, unpopular, and economically realistic decisions. By choosing to
undo many of the mistakes of the current administration,
the next administration can help to improve conditions
domestically and internationally, and might even bring
the United States back to the forefront in the international economic and political arenas.
Failure by the current and future administrations to
adequately respond to the dire circumstances will doom
the United States to a lasting recession and severely hamper the flexibility of the United States to respond to deteriorating social conditions in our society.

Body image problems also affect men
To the Editor:
I applaud Tamar Lerer's piece "Something to Chew
On,"' published on September 11th. Lerer's column
addresses a subject that has been grossly neglected by the
Swarthmore community. Almost no one on campus openly discusses body image and eating disorders, which
serves to further push the subject into the shadows and
stigmatize those who deserve the help and support they
need to eat healthily and accept their bodies.
My one concern with Lerer's piece is that it serves to
further the myth that eating disorders and body image
exclusively affect self-identified women. By writing that
"college-aged females" are concerned with body image,
Lerer neglects to appreciate that many men struggle with
this issue as well. By most estimates, as many as 10% of
anorexics and 15% of bulimics are male, and the numbers
may in fact be higher, since there is tremendous stigma
against men who admit to having an eating disorder.
Although standards of beauty are far different for men
and women (and this should be taken into account), any
discussion of eating disorders at Swarthmore should
include men as well as women. Nevertheless, Lerer makes
an important point about an issue that has been ignored
for far too long at this school. We as a community need to
talk more about body image.

"Villerat" seen as a pejorative term
To the Editor:

This is written in regards to the August 26, 2008 article
on "Swat Lingo 101" that was brought to my attention by a
member of the Swarthmore community.

The Phoenix is read by students as well as those in the
and referring to the Swarthmore residents as "Villerats", or "rampaging Mongol-like spawnlings" cannot be interpreted as anything other than
surrounding areas,

derogatory.
I understand that this is considered to be sarcasm, but
deriding the vejcy community that we ourselves are just
fleeting and transient guests of cannot be considered to be
journalism in any respect.

JUAN VICTOR FAJARDO
supporters
Evo
of
Cam-bur-pin-ton B
Morales'
government
and members of the
opposition. The issue at hand is a set of constitutional
changes that President Evo Morales hopes to present by way
of a referendum on Dec. 7. Much like the constitutional
changes that Chavez proposed last December in Venezuela,
Morales' proposal promises a radicalization of the revolutionary process currently under way in Bolivia. More specifically, Morales has suggested the revamping of land reform
policies and a change in current distribution of Bolivia's gas
revenues, among other things.
Needless to say, the proposed changes have sparked a
wave of protests from leaders of the opposition who have
recently gained prominence in the Bolivian political world.
About one month ago, Bolivian citizens were asked to vote
on whether or not nine high government officials should
remain in office. One of these nine officials was President
Morales himself. The governor of Bolivia's richest gas-producing state, who happens to be one of the fiercest members

of the opposition, was also one of the officials whose job was
on the line. The results of the referendum show thatMorales
still has the popular support of the Bolivian electorate. They
also demonstrate, however, that some of the strongest opposition leaders also have with a significant base of support in
their respective regions. The referendum was meant to unite
Bolivia under prominent leaders but it did just the opposite.
Bolivia is now geographically divided between the opposition in the gas-producing east and the central government.

It is safe to say, at this point,
that Chavez envisions his

revolution as a continuation
of the Cuban Revolution.

v

It was precisely these two opposing groups that confronted each other on the streets of the Pando region this past
week. The opposition believes that the changes threaten the
political autonomy of their region. As of Sunday, Sept. 14, the
skirmishes, which have involved armed individuals on both
sides, have left a total of 30 reported casualties. President
Morales accused the governor of the Pando region of having
hired professional killers from Brazil and Peru to massacre
the pro-government protestors. An order for his capture is
currently in place.
In the midst of what seems to be a small-scale civil war in
northern Bolivia, Morales ordered the expulsion of the
American ambassador to La Paz on the claim that the US
representative is in support- of the opposition groups.
Although the Bush administration has been clear in stating
that the reasons behind the removal or the ambassador are
unfounded, whether or not this is true remains unclear.
In solidarity with the Bolivian revolutionary government, President Chavez also asked the US ambassador to
Caracas to leave the country. Chavez's move is especially

controversial for several reasons. The first is that it is yet
another indication of Chavez's tendency to exert his political
influence in the region and get involved in conflicts that do
not impact Venezuela directly. It seems rather ironic that
while Chavez criticizes the government of the US for being
an intruder in domesticLatin American issues, it is he who
most actively gets involved in issues facing other Latin
American countries. Furthermore, the recent militaristic
developments in Venezuela make the expulsion of the
American ambassador to Caracas even more serious. The
Venezuelan government recently invited the presence of two
Russian bomber planes to conduct "test flights" in the
Atlantic. Although the Russian bomber planes have the
capacity to carry nuclear weapons, they arrived in Caracas
without them. The presence of Russian bomber planes in
Venezuela is a political move in retaliation to the recent activation of the American naval fleet in the Caribbean.
Nonetheless, the Venezuelan government claims that the
"test flights" have no ulterior motive other than to "strengthen the friendly ties" between Russia and Venezuela.
Prominent political analysts in Venezuela have written
at length about the parallels between what is happening
today in Venezuela and what happened in Cuba during the
19605. The Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela is a revolutionary project inspired the 26 of July Movement led by
Fidel Castro during the Cold War. It is safe to say, at this
point, that Chavez envisions his revolution as a continuation ofthe Cuban Revolution. In other words, he sees himself
as the inheritor of the Cuban project. Although Chavez sustains that one of the main goals of his revolution is to challenge the influence ofthe United States inLatin America, his
most recent alliances with Russia, China and Iran are worrisome.
Does Chavez think that we still live in a Cold War world?
When will he stop playing the geopolitical game and start
providing solutions for the problems that really impact
Venezuelans? When will the crime rate in Venezuela's
biggest cities become a priority?

'Graduate' as a film is neither black nor white
(not that "The Graduate" adheres to any
strict notion of realism). It is precisely this
film's cynicism and ambiguity that make it
so appealing. That being said, it is that very

"pathology" that Mr. Swanson condemns

ways. He is not a reflection of our aspirations but rather a harrowing reminder of
who we are: frightened, impulsive, and terribly alone.

will attempt to do in this week's column.
And unlike Mr. Swanson, I feel that the

Mr. Swanson's first objection is that

is the protagonist of the first half of the film.
The '6os may have been a time of liberation,
but for many women, that liberation came
too late. Think of Mrs. Robinson as a sort of
super posh '6os everywoman. The product of
a shotgun marriage, boredom, and alcoholism, her tragic yet controversial attempt
to free herself from the chains of domesticity is allegorical for a larger social malaise
that continues to this day. ("Desperate
Housewives," anyone?)
Formally, "The Graduate" has a lot more
to offer visually than it does via the oh-solauded Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack. I
mean really, how many times can one possibly listen to "Scarborough Fair?"
Seriously... Perhaps it is Simon and
Garfunkers "Sound of Silence" that draws
the viewer into the film's beginning, but it is

the image chain that transports the viewer
into the cold, apathetic world of "The
Graduate." As Benjamin moves through the
airport, during an early sequence, a close
tracking shot ofhis detached and weary face
follows his every move in one long take. He
glides through a labyrinth of moving walks
and elevators, the camera glued to his lonely figure. Bodies whiz by in the background
like phantoms navigating an unfriendly

landscape.

I mean really, how
many times can one
possibly listen to
"Scarborough Fair?"
The camera then cuts to Benjamin's face,
still in close-up, in front of an aquarium in a
space assumed to be his room. His parents
call him from off-screen to come downstairs
for his coming home party. And in one of the
most stunning yet simple scenes in the
whole movie, Benjamin's father walks into
the room, the back of his head between
Benjamin and the camera. This unconventional shot provides layers of depth, penetrating the flatness of the screen. It not only
metaphorically represents the father's dominance but places Benjamin in a solitary
void, trapped between the shimmering and
reflecting pallet of the fish tank and his
father's constantly moving, constantly talking head. But more importantly, the scene
cuts the viewer off from the protagonist, a
blatant denial ofaudience fulfillment, which
not only alludes to the viewer's own solitude

September IS, 2008

but mirrors one of the major themes of the
film: the elusive quest for satisfaction.
Much of "The Graduate" occupies a
world of shadows and darkness. From
Benjamin's first bar-side encounter with
Mrs. Robinson to his first liaison at the
hotel, darkness provides a cover, a shield
preventing any kind of genuine intimacy.
Darkness with all its signifiers of sex,
illicit activity, and escapism also symbolizes within "The Graduate" the silence
and apathy of what is now referred to as
"hook-up culture." Much of this is made
painfully obvious during Benjamin's first
and only attempted meaningful conversation with Mrs. Robinson. He wants to talk;
she simply wants to get it on. And the
light that Benjamin keeps flipping on to
the dismay of his companion not only
thwarts sex, but also exposes Mrs.
Robinson's vulnerability and discontent
as she, rendered tightly in a close-up,
unwittingly reveals her motivation for the
affair.
Not only does "The Graduate" have
"merit as a movie," it presents in a compelling manner a nuanced and highly
entertaining (if darkly so) portrait of the
pitfalls of human interaction. Not that it is
completely unproblematic. Mr. Swanson
does bring up an interesting point: How
can a movie portray negative behaviors

As the 2008 base-

signed Barry Bonds.

Bonds is a lot of bad
things. He is a jerk
and narcissist. He's a bad fielder and he's a media circus waiting
to happen. But, man, can he hit.
In 2007, at age 42, amid talk of his horribly declining skills, he
led Major League Baseball in on-base percentage and was 12th in
slugging percentage (among players with at least 400 plate appearances). He brings a lot of baggage with him, but there are a lot of
teams on the outside of the playoff picture looking in who had
nothing to lose by signing him, and a lot of teams on the inside
looking at the playoffs who could still use him. As everything
swirled around him, he would have created runs for any team.
But Bonds has been branded. MLB and its pawns, the sportswriters, have successfully pinned the Steroid Era on him. Last
year, on August 7, he hit the 756th home run ofhis career, setting
the all-time record. The game was on national television, and the
national audience got to see Bonds round the bases. The previously hostile fans in San Diego gave him a standing ovation. All but
one.
ESPN showed MLB Commissioner Bud Selig as Bonds made
his victory lap. Selig sat in his seat frowning. Only when someone
repeatedly urged him did he stand up awkwardly, still refusing to
clap. The message was clear: Bonds and his steroid-fueledassault
on the record books are a disease to the game. He is the villain of
the Steroid Era.
But this story just doesn't hold. No account has him using
steroids before 2000. What was he doing before then? He was being
an ass, yes, but he was also being one of the best players in the
game, and doing it clean. What was Bud Selig doing? He was
counting the money the sport was raking in because of the homer
boom. More to the point, he was ignoring the steroid problem.
Bonds watched steroids become a bigger and bigger part of the
game, and he saw the users get praised. In 1999, he hurt his knee,
and began using to recover. The rest is well known: he kept using
and became the best hitter since Babe Ruth.
Clearly, Bonds was not the problem. Selig and the rest of the
team owners were the only people who could have done anything
to stop the proliferation of steroids. Instead, they counted their
revenue.
The owners of the game have at least partially sidestepped the
brunt of the blame, and they did so by pinning it on Bonds. He was
an easy target because he's been such a jerk for so long. No one
had any qualms about booing him and harassing him with insulting signs. Forget that steroid use was rife in the game and that the
people truly capitalizing were the owners. People were happy to
boo Bonds and move on from the ugliness, and so the anti-Bonds
angle was gobbled up.
He broke the record, his contract ran out, and now the owners
have decided that he can't be let back into the game. Of course,
that's off the record, because it's extremely illegal, but there's
clearly an agreement that the game does not need any more Barry
Bonds.
You'll hear arguments from talking heads on ESPN and in
sports page columns that no team wants the home run king
because of his selfish attitude and the media swarm he would create. This just can't be true. Too many teams had too much to gain
and too little to lose by signing him for this to be the case.
Bonds is not playing due to some sort of collusive agreement
among the teams, and when we accept the party line, that Bonds
is unemployed because no team could afford the baggage of signing the poster boy of a tainted era, we are in fact letting the true
culprits of that era off the hook.
MLB owners have colluded before. But what's at stake this
time is not money, it's blame for one of the game's dark moments.
With Bonds out of sight, they hope to keep steroids out of people's
minds. So, Barry sits at home, while teams look for offense elsewhere.

Frisbee competes in Jersey tournaments
BY DENNIS FAN

dfanl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore Men's and Women's Frisbee Teams

opened their fall seasons well, finishing in the top
halves of their respective tournaments this past weekend. An outing full of success stories, the Earthworms
(Men) placed fifth out of twelve teams at the Founders
Open Sectionals in Freehold, NJ while the Warmothers
(Women) took third place out of nine teams at the
Founders Women's Sectionals in Mercer County, NJ.
Both teams finished with 4-3 overall records.
During the tournaments, the teams had to fight the
heat and humidity (not to be understated, as Frisbee
games can often last an hour and a half) as well as tough
opponents in pool play on Saturday to qualify for singleelimination Frisbee in the Championship Bracket on
Sunday. While the men would drop out in the first
round, the women forged ahead until falling, 10-8, to
Jersey College, the team that would eventually win the
tournament.

Jen Yi 'O9 commented that she 'didn't expect the
team to do particularly well" going into the tournament.
For parts of the tournament, the team had only ten players including four first-years. However, the
Warmother's strong performance spoke for itself. On
Saturday, the team pulled off a major upset, defeating
the University of Pennsylvania team 11-8. The firstyears were crucial in the Warmothers' performance. A
few had played Frisbee in high school, and others had
played soccer, giving them a good 'field sense' for a
game like Frisbee. Yi added that thefreshmen were not
frightened of playing in their first tournament, but were
enthusiastic about going out and competing. "We have
a lot of talent on the team," agreed Bryn Lindblad 'O9.
The Earthworms showed tremendous improvement
over the course of their tournament. Though the team
lost to Villanova, 5-15, they learned from their mistakes

and defeated Villanova, 13-11, in bracket play. Travis
Rothbloom 10 commented that Keith Torrey 'O9 produced spectacular results on offense and that Jimmy
Jin 10 played tight defense to push the team deep into
tournament play, Danny Riser-Espinoza 'O9 was also
complimented for his 'defensive rampage" on Saturday.
Obtaining outstanding results can only come from practice. A usual Frisbee practice starts with about ten minutes of warming-up throws, a jog, and stretching. The
players then run drills and scrimmage at the end of
practice to apply what they have learned.
Practicing and playing with each other brings teammates closer together. The teams even have regularly
scheduled social activities outside of practice. "There is
a nice balance of competition and fun," states Lindblad,
who also commented that there is a much different culture in Frisbee than many sports. Even at highly competitive tournaments, players on both sides of the field
are supportive of each other and the end of the game
they usually end up friends, regardless of the score. The
congenial spirit of Frisbee is reinforced by the policy of
self-refereeing, or the honor code. For example, if players are aware that they have stepped out of bounds, they
determine the call themselves.
Andrew Crispin 'O9 embodied the balance of competition and fun in describing his team's play this weekend. "We performed like a champ
like Mike
Tyson...[or] like George Foreman after he retired from
boxing and decided to sell an ingenious fat-reducing
grilling machine," Crispin said.
Lindblad commented that the Warmothers are
'always enthusiastic about accepting new players" as it
not only adds depth to the team, which is important during long weekend tournaments, but new players also
make the social events much more enjoyable. The teams
practice on Mertz Field Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Fridays, and take newcomers as well as experienced
...

players.

players around him better. Consider this: if Peyton
Manning orLaDanian Tomlinson were to go down with
injuries, their respective teams could still win games.
Though, in light of the present situation, the Patriots
may not go undefeated, because of their on-field talent
and superb coaching staff, they still can have an excellent season. It takes more than one player to win a
game, and because of Brady's past performances, Matt
Cassel (who took his first snap as a starter since high
school this past Sunday) will have plenty of playmakers
to pick up the slack for him. There is no doubt that this

For example, can the 5-man backfield put up large
numbers on the ground, which would largely take pressure off Cassel to make third-and-ten conversions? Can
the offensive line hold their pass blocks for a few seconds longer to adapt to a quarterback without a lighting
quick release like Brady? Of course in a situation like
this the defense must step its game up also. Let us
never forget the old adage: defense wins championships.

I also urge not just those of you who hate on the
Patriots, but those of you who root for teams with lackluster starts, not to lose confidence. In the NFL a large
part of any team's success is the strength of its coaching staff. Even with a traumatic injury like of Brady's,
the Patriots still have a good chance to go deep this year
simply because Bill Belichick is a superior coach.
I have the utmost confidence that such a meticulous
coaching staff like the one the Patriots have can be
enough to overcome obstacles and create successful
game-plans that reflect the strengths of the now Bradyless team.
For this reason, I urge fans of, say, the Jacksonville
Jaguars to not give up faith after an 0-2 start. Coach
Jack del Rio is an excellent play-caller, and as a former
linebacker himself, knows how to successfully manage
a fearsome defense. There is no need to give up on any
team just because of the first few weeks of the season.
That being said, I must choose my words carefully or
bad karma may result in a 2-14 season for the Patriots.
Some of you may recall that the Pats were in a similar situation not even a full decade ago when longtime
quarterback Drew Bledsoe went down with a lifethreatening injury and thus the fate of the franchisefell
to an untested sixth-round draft pick, Tom Brady. Lo
and behold, the world works in mysterious ways, especially the football world, which can be turned upside
down each and every week. Bottom line out there for
those of you grieving over a slow start for your team:
don't fret about the first two weeks; the season is still
young. And for those of you laughing at the Patriots and
myself, don't feel too bad when Matt Cassel takes this
team to the postseason, because every football fan
knows that he has the tools around him to do it.

Women's field hockey falls to Eastern Eagles
In a close game, the team lost its second game of the season after beginning the second half with a 1-0 advantage
BY NOLAN GEAR
ngearl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Women's Field Hockey team lost its second match of the season to the visiting Eastern Eagles this
Saturday at noon. Although they started the second half
with a 1-0 advantage, the team could not maintain its lead,
culminating in a loss with a final score of 2-1
In what was ultimately a very close game, the Eastern
Eagles, cheered on by an accordion-accompanied fight song,
were able to gain the upper hand in the second half, scoring
two goals on goalie Gina Grubb and revamping their defense
to prevent a repetition of the first half s Garnet dominance.
The match remained scoreless until 11 minutes into the
first half, when Swarthmore forward Abbe Muller 10 scored
with an assist from Natalie Stone 'O9. The Garnet continued
to dominate the first half, relentlessly pushing against
Eastern's defenses and shooting at the goal twelve times.

"We've got a great group of girls.
They make changes; they're very

coachable."
Lauren Fuchs
Field Hockey coach
Eagles senior goalie Kelly Hermann proved to be a force
to be reckoned with, blocking 11 of the 12 shots and cutting
the Garnet's offensive advantage short. The Swartnmore
defense also played a strong first half, with ten saved shots
by Gina Grubb 10.

Yet the accordion music from Eastern's side of the stands
became more enthusiastic as the Garnet's endurance slowly
waned in the second half. Within the first three minutes,
Eastern senior Kimberly Campbell scored the Eagles' first
goal of the match. The Garnet continued to tire, and the
defense became decidedly weaker.
Eastern sophomore Sarah Garber scored the Eagles' second goal with less than ten minutes remaining in the second
half. The Garnet offense attacked relentlessly in the last five

minutes, putting constant pressure on Eastern goalie Laura
Ressler 11 Despite the effort, Swarthmore was unable to
score the tying goal.
Head Coach Lauren Fuchs was disappointed withthe end
result, which marked Swarthmore's second loss of the sea-

son. According to Fuchs, the team wasted a golden opportunity. "We played a great game in the first half; we dominated," Fuchs said. "But when you have an opportunity in the
first half like we did, you need to score more goals."
Nevertheless, Fuchs remains optimistic about the team's
chances for the rest of the season.
"We've got a great group of girls," said Fuchs. "They
make changes, they're very coachable." Becoming instantly
pragmatic, however, Fuchs asserted that the Achilles' heel
that the team will have to tackle is endurance. "We need to
pick up the fitness level so these girls can follow through.
Then, we should pick up a lot more wins," Fuchs said.

"We got tired. But we played a great
first half. If we play like we did in the
first half, we'll have a great season."
Gina Grubb 'lO
Fuchs' assertion was corroborated by goalie Grubb. "We
got tired," Grubb said after Saturday's match. "But we
played a great first half. If we play like we did in the first
half, we'll have a great season." According to Grubb, however, the Swarthmore team has one great advantage over the
competition: unity.

"We're very, very close," Grubb said. "We spend a lot of
time together outside of practice. We're pretty much the
same team as last year, with one new addition. The new
addition is first-year defender Lara Hasychak, who does not
feel like a newcomer at all: "They don't treat me any differently; I really feel like an important part of the team," said
Hasychak.

Swarthmore is now 1-2 in its early season, with a win
against the Roanoke Maroons on Aug. 30 and a loss against
the Cabrini Cavaliers on Aug 3L
The team faces Elizabethtown on Tuesday. Fuchs and her
team remain confident that they can move forward to a victory against Elizabethtown and ultimately to a successful
