Six Phi Psi pledges, all first-years, were arrested last week during a fraternity-sponsored scavenger hunt on the Haverford campus
that may have been a hazing ritual, officials said. Charges against
the six include criminal trespass, institutional vandalism, theft,
burglary and other crimes.
Freshmen Timothy Chryssikos, Paul Chung, Keith Hernandez,
Brendan J. Moriarty, Terence Rooney and Troy Smith allegedly
broke into several campus buildings late at night on Tuesday, Nov.
27, and were apprehended by Haverford public safety, according to
affidavits.
Police allegedly discovered a three-page list containing several
items also found in the pledges' possession. Among these were a

"After a time there are so many

that, and it just gets harder and

The new HIV/AIDS group
organized the 24-hour commemoration. "December 1
officially marks World AIDS Day," Amy Meek 'O2, a
member of the group, said. "Other college campuses
are reading names as well."
The 24-hour reading period was divided up into 15minute sections. Students, faculty and administrators
were asked to volunteer to read names throughout
the period. It was estimated that between 30,000 and
40,000 names were read aloud during the 24 hours.
"This is only around point-one percent of the number who have actually died," Stefanie Fox 'O4 said. "It
would take at least 1,000 days to read all the names
that are documented."
The names read throughout the day came from a
published booklet compiled by the Names Memorial
AIDS Project, which originated from the production
of the AIDS Quilt. "The list read was the most recent
update of all the panels on the quilt," Fox said.

moment of silence after the reading of the final name

Hernandez and Rooney, both underage, were charged with consumption of alcohol after officers observed them to be "manifestly
under the influence" and administered breathalyzer tests, according to affidavits. In addition, Moriarty was charged with a drug violation after police allegedly found a "small amount" of marijuana
and a pipe in his left pants pocket.
Haverford Township police officers took the six into custody
after the college's security officers discovered the pledges trespassing and called the police. They were arrested, arraigned and
released after Phi Psi president Josh Farber 'O2 and vice president
Chris Loeffler 'O4 used fraternity funds to pay 10 percent of each
pledge's $5,000 bail, a total sum of $3,000. Preliminary hearings have
been set for Thursday, Dec. 20, though Farber said Phi Psi was working to have the charges reduced, if not dropped. "We'd prefer to stop

it before it reaches that level," he said.

A typical' prank
Phi Psi members dropped off the six first-years at Haverford at
around 9:30 p.m, Farber said. In his words, the members gave no
encouragement to the pledges as to whether they should get the
items on the list. They were told only to figure out a way to return
to Swarthmore on their own.
Chung and Chryssikos were first caught by Haverford public
safety. Allegedly, public safety found a green duffel bag containing
the items from the trophy case and broken glass in Chung's possession. Police soon caught up with the other four outside of Leeds
Hall. A wallet and six videotapes that belonged to various dorm residences were allegedly found in their possession at that time, in

addition to

the other items.

i

Phi Psi officially apologized in a letter to the Haverford commupity, offering sympathy for those "inconvenienced by our delin-

quency."

"The understanding is that it was. basically part of a goodmatured rivalry that went a little awry," Farber said. "The two institutions understand that it was meant to be a typical intercollegiate
Prank between two schools."
Farber also said he believed the criminal charges against

On the campaign trail

Multicultural candidates describe vision
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

Three applicants for the position of Dean of
Multicultural Affairs
one from within the college,
two from without
visited the campus in the last two
weeks. At open meetings with students, the candidates
gave their perspectives on problems such as curriculum growth, prejudice reduction and affirmative action
as well as how multiculturalism and diversity differ.
Tim Sams, the college's current director of the
Black Cultural Center and an assistant dean, met
with students on Monday. He first explained that multiculturalism involves promoting not just diversity
but also "the work of social justice around issues of

diversity."
Sams, who said he supports
affirmative action because it
"is necessary to rectify injustices," said he was interested
in curriculum changes but
would not have the authority
as dean of multicultural
affairs to tell professors what
to teach. He did say, however,
that he knows many faculty
members who are enthusiastic
about incorporating multiculturalism into their classes and

"She talked about working in the White House, being Hillary
Clinton's campaign manager, going to Yale law school and
being the vice chancellor of the New York City public school
system," Sonal Bhatia 'O2, a member of Deshi, said.
"I thought the lecture was structured in such a way that she
left it open to the students to set the agenda for the evening,"
said Deshi member Chirag Chotalia 'O2. Bhatia pointed out that
Tanden spoke about her own life for 25 minutes, then let students participate in an hour-long question-and-answer session.
"The questions ranged from asking whether she thought
Hillary Clinton was going to run for president in 2004 to what
Tanden thought of a certain public school in New York,"
Chotalia said. "She was a broad appeal speaker."
Tanden's talk was sponsored by Deshi, CIVIC, the
Intercultural Center and the College Democrats. Chirag said
representatives from Deshi had met her at an award ceremony in Philadelphia honoring prominent South Asians. "She
was just really down-to-earth," he said.

Smaw, who described himself as a "male feminist," said he was "accustomed to dealing with students who have a mind, who have a voice and who
are comfortable articulating their opinions without

apology."
"My work takes its focus by listening to the students," Smaw said. "You can't talk about a pluralistic
community without ensuring that all have a voice." He

should be included in that voice,

"I am accustomed to

Darryl Smaw

is "eager to work with them."
Sams also expressed interest
in starting an introductory
class on multiculturalism, along with a few
advanced courses on the subject.
One of the elements of multiculturalism that
Swarthmore lacks, Sams said, is a collective definition of the term. "Multiculturalism on this campus
seems to be individually defined," he said. "We confuse diversity with multiculturalism. That bothers
me, because what we're suggesting to people is that
'they've got it.'
Swarthmore does not, in truth,
have a multicultural perspective because it does not
challenge itself to take responsibility for social justice in terms of diversity.
Before his tenure at Swarthmore, Sams directed
the multicultural center at Williams, which included 15 cultural student organizations. He also worked
in minority student services at the College of Saint
Rose in Albany, N.Y. and at the Sage Junior College
"

Neera Tanden, deputy campaign manager for Hillary
Clinton's 2000 New York senate run, spoke on campus last

as associate chaplain at Brown, facilitating discussions on race and giving guest lectures in addition to
conducting religious services in the black church
tradition.
The Harvard Graduate School of Education currently employs Smaw as the associate dean for pro-

of Albany.

Darryl Smaw visited last Tuesday and said his
experience in multiculturalism began "in the back
seat of a car." As a student in Anchorage, Alaska, he
said, he was one of four black students at his high
school and one night found himself asked the difficult question of what it was like to be black. But in
the car with four white friends of his, he said, began

a discussion of race relations that would last far into
the night, at a time when such conversations were

generally taboo.
Since then, Smaw has worked with multiculturalism in higher education in various formats. A
graduate of divinity school, where he studied religious education and counseling, he spent

Karlene Burrell-Mcßae,
who came to the college last
Monday, Nov. 26, is the current

associate director of the intercultural
center
at
the
University of Pennsylvania.
Her experiences at Penn have
included creating an alliance
between black and Jewish student groups and overseeing awareness workshops in
which students are expected to acknowledge their
own cultural biases. She has also organized a program addressing homophobia in ethnic minority
communities and is currently overseeing the creation of a new black cultural center. The reporter
was unable to attend her open meeting with students, where she explained what she would want to
accomplish if hired for the position.
"She is extremely approachable," Anna Morgan '0
said. "Student services is definitelyher strong point.
I feel she would be able to work with the students t
help make multiculturalism appeal to all students, no
just minorities." Morgan is a member of the searc
committee for the dean of multiculturalaffairs.
Burrell-Mcßae received a bachelor's degree i
anthropology from Colby College and a master's i
social work, administration and planning as well a
in intercultural communication and science in edu
cation from Penn.

Members of the college community who heard
the candidates are encouraged to contact the

For Johnstone, one of the people who
discovered the teeth, it was an eerie portal
to the past. The teeth are the forgotten
remains of the world-famous St. Louis
Baby Tooth Survey, which took place from
1958 to 1970.
At the height of the Cold War, the
United States set off over 200 atmospheric nuclear tests at their Nevada Test
Site. The Baby Tooth Survey was developed in order to determine the effect of
nuclear fallout on humans, specifically

children.

scientific analysis of Harold Rosenthal,
biochemist for WU's former School of
Dentistry, and the funding of the U.S.
Public Health Service and Leukemia
Society of Missouri and Illinois, the survey materialized and received an incredible response. By its end, the project had
collected almost 300,000 baby teeth mostly
from the St. Louis area.
The project's purpose was to measure

radioactive iodine.
Rosenthal found that the amount of
Strontium 90 in the children's teeth was
directly related to the amount of nuclear
testing in the year of their birth. This discovery significantly contributed to the
public appeal for a moratorium on nuclear
tests and led to the Limited Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty that President Kennedy signed

remaining teeth were shipped to the Tyson
Center for long-term storage, where they
remained for over three decades until they were
unearthed in May.
The administrators found "piles and piles" of
cardboard boxes full of manila envelopes containing the teeth. Johnstone said that the teeth
did not smell bad, but he was unable to comment
on the presence of cavities: "I didn't look too
closely at them."
Johnstone rejected the prospect that other
body parts could be in the bunker as well, (i.e.,
fingernails or eyelashes). Instead, the other contents of the bunker were uninteresting, mostly
old chairs and broken pieces of equipment.
Johnstone described the storage facility as a
one-way street, in that most objects that are sent
to the bunker never return. The baby teeth, however, are an exception.
Knowing he had stumbled onto something
significant, Johnstone contacted professor of
biology Daniel Kohl on whether or not to throw
the teeth away. Kohl urged him not to do this,
because he believed that the teeth were "an
immensely valuable resource." Kohl contacted
Barry Commoner, the mastermind behind the
Baby Tooth Study, and together they decided to

donate the teeth to the Radiation and Public
Health Project in New York.
The original baby tooth study determined the

presence of radioactive materials. What it did
not do, however, was link the presence of
radioactive material in teeth to health problems.
The Radiation and Public Health Project
hopes to rectify that. The project plans to conduct a follow-up study on the effect of absorption
of radioactive materials in the body. They hope
to contact the owners of the teeth to determine
whether there is a high correlation between the
amount of Strontium 90 in the tooth and the
owner's health.
So far, the project has received 1,500 e-mails
from participants of the original study, willing
to participate again. Project director Jay Gould
said he can't wait to get started.
"There's so much we don't know," said
Gould, referring to the health effects of radioactive substances. He said he believes that
increased occurrences of breast cancer in
women and earlier appearance of prostate cancer in men are results of the exposure.
Gould admitted that someone currently of
college age likely had Strontium 90 present in
his or her baby teeth as a result of the nuclear
reactors.
Many people are very excited about the possibilities this study holds. "It could turn out to
be a monumental study," said Kohl.
However, the investigation is not without its
downside. In the process of testing for radioactivity, the teeth will be destroyed. Undoubtedly,
the tooth fairy would not approve.

Some pretty big shoes to fill

Michael Pasahow Phoenix Staff

Ward Churchill, author of "A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and
Denial in the Americas," spoke last Friday in LPAC. He defined what he
called "the g-word" just as the Polish writer who created it in 1944 did:
"any policy undertaken with the intent to bring about the dissolution or
disappearance of an identified group as such." Such a policy, Churchill
said, is not limited to mass murder. Physical and psychological harm,
policies that allow for such harm, prevention of births, and the transfer
of children also constitute genocide, and Churchill proved in his talk that
Indians were victim to each of the components. He sharply criticized the
United States for refusing to integrate international restrictions on genocide into its own laws. "When you say 'genocide,' people automatically
and instantly think of things having to do with, quote, The Holocaust,'
Churchill said. "The problem is the response ends right there."

SWARTHMORE AND THE WAR
College staff member organizes
aid program for Afghanistan

Students concerned
over privacy issues

BY JAR ED LENOW

BY MARA HVISTENDAHL

Sharpies employee Jamie Layton still has to choke
back tears when she talks about growing up in war-

As the FBI prepares to interview 5,000 Middle Eastern and
Muslim men on student and tourist visas, Swarthmore administrators say they will try to protect the privacy of student records,
but are uncertain how much authority they have.
The interview plans, revealed last week by the Department of
Justice, are the latest
and perhaps the most extensive yet
governmental attempt to obtain evidence surrounding the Sept.
11 attacks. All men from certain Middle Eastern and African
countries ages 18 to 33 who entered the United States on temporary visas in the last two years will be questioned.
The Justice Department directive, combined with October's
U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act, which requires the release of college
records when requested by the U.S. Attorney General's office,
has left administrators concerned about their responsibilities to
comply with the government. U.S.A.-PATRIOT is an acronym
that stands for "Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct

torn Vietnam.
"I saw many things happen when I was young; old,
too," she said. "I never forgot it all; it stays in the cor-

ner somewhere."

Layton emigrated from South Vietnam to the
United States in 1969, after she was almost killed in a
supermarket bombing during the eighth month ofher
pregnancy.
"I don't know why I didn't get hurt," she said. "I
[was] just lucky I guess. I couldn't sleep for a long
time. There was a whole bunch of nightmares."
When Layton first learned of the terrorist attacks
of Sept. 11, the memories of her youth came flooding
back. "I couldn't work on that day," she said.
"My boss sent me home. Watching television, it
reminded me of everything that happened to me when
I was young. I didn't know what I could do, or who I
could go to."
A caterer by trade, Layton came up with the idea of
raising money for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks

MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR SEPT. 11 TO BE HELD TUESDAY
Three months later, the memories still make
some students cringe. To address this, several
students have decided on a memorial for Sept.
11 "after a series of group meetings for students
from [the New York and Northern Virginia areas]
decided they were still grieving and not yet over
the shock of what happened," organizer
Susannah Volpe 'O5 wrote in an e-mail.
The event, which will take place next Tuesday
at 7:30 p.m. in the Lang Concert Hall, is "to allow
others on the campus with similar feelings to
take part in a mourning ceremony," Volpe wrote.
The date, Dec. H, will mark the three-month
anniversary of the terrorist attacks.

About 200 colleges and universities around the nation have
allowed the government access to student records under the
U.S.A.-PATRIOT Act, according to the American Civil Liberties
Union Web site. Swarthmore has not been approached, but
Registrar Martin Warner said he would do all he could to protect
students. "I'm going to be just as concerned about the privacy of
student records as ever," he said.
Just how much control Warner has is uncertain, however.
President Al Bloom said that the college is unsure about its legal
role with regard to government questioning.
And the recent Justice Department project seems to circumvent college administrators entirely. Excerpts of a Justice
Department memo to U.S. attorneys published in the Nov. 27 edition of The New York Times explicitly discussed the questioning
of men on student visas. "If the individual is here to attend
school," the memo reads, "you should learn what you can about
his studies and future plans." The memo also directed government
attorneys to ask each interviewed man "if he noticed anybody
who reacted in a surprising or inappropriate way to the news of
the Sept. 11 attacks" and "how he felt when he heard the news."
The directive has come under attack from civil liberties
groups, who have labeled it racial profiling. In defense of the
move, President Bush's legal forces have prepared an analysis
citing the Supreme Court cases upholding the internment of
Japanese-Americans as precedent for the broad actions of
today's government, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
Dann Naseemullah 'O2, a British citizen and U.S. permanent
resident who lived his entire life in Pakistan before he came to
Swarthmore, fears being swept up in the FBl's far-reaching net
of investigation. Naseemullah said he has publicly held stances
that are "against U.S. foreign policy" and attended a protest of
the current war in Washington, D.C.
"I'm concerned because I know that the FBI is a completely
fallible organization and that a lot of what I've done, though completely legal, might be construed as anti-American," he said. "I
don't see it as too much for the FBI to look at people based on
where they're from as opposed to their citizenship."
The Justice Department directive applies to natives of these
countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt,
Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya.
Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab
Emirates and Yemen.
The National Lawyers' Guild has issued an instructive manual informing visa-holders of their rights in the event of questioning. The manual is available online at www.nlg.org.

O UNDERSTANDING ISLAM G
Jew and Muslim propose making concessions to Palestine
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
In a controversial presentation Tuesday,

Marc Ellis and Ghazala Anwar presented
their ideas for building community and
establishing a peace movement supporting
Palestinian arguments for land in Israel. By
the end of their presentation, many of the
audience members were thankful for the
chance to hear these issues, but most of the
openly Jewish students in the audience
were outraged by the speakers' ideas.
Rachel Kobrin, the Jewish adviser,
called the discussion "simplistic and
manipulative" arid said she did not sponsor it because she was familiar with Marc
Ellis and "suspected that it would be a onesided presentation of opinions." She
attended the event anyway, she said, in
order to "support students with many different perspective and beliefs."
The talk was sponsored by the

Swarthmore

Progressive

Action

Committee, the Forum for Free Speech, the
president's office, the dean's office, the
political science department, the religion
department and the program in peace and

conflict studies.

Somayyah Siddiqi 'O2 introduced the
speakers. "Both Ellis and Anwar recognize
that dialogue and cooperation between student religious and peace groups are crucial
to engendering an environment of peace,
co-existence and mutual understanding
between wider social groups that currently
are perceived as enemies," she said. Siddiqi
introduced Anwar as a lecturer in Islamic
studies at the University of Canterbury in
Christchurch, New Zealand. Anwar is an
inter-religious peace activist with extreme
interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Ellis, who is the director of American and

Jewish Studies at Baylor University in

Waco, Texas, was described by Siddiqi as a
Jewish man hoping to achieve a means of
organizing peace in the Middle East.
"There is a need for an understanding
between people of different faiths," she
said, "and these two people are trying to
work toward that understanding."
Anwar began the presentation by introducing her position in the dialogue. "I have
encountered people fromall walks oflife and
have felt hostility from Jewish families," she
said. "These feelings have always stayed
with me, and they play a big part in why I'm
interested in having these dialogues."
Ellis then explained his position in
these dialogues. "As I grew up, I learned
what it meant to be Jewish after the
Holocaust," he said. "I was told that as a
Jew, I had a significance that was deeper
than that of just being an American."
He decided to support the dialogues as a
way of promoting a variety of opinions. "I
felt that I needed to go other places in the
world where Jews were not welcome and to
the places where they were welcomed with
open arms," he said. "I want to show that we
could expand the terrain of that embrace."
In support of Ellis' ideas, Anwar decided to travel with him to various parts of the
world. "I knew that because of his proPalestinian position, he would be one of
those few people welcome within the
Muslim communities," she said.
Ellis then moved on to present his main
point, what he called the "ecumenical deal."
The "deal," according to Ellis, is an unspoken pact between Jews and Christians.
Jews say to Christians that they can repent
for past grievances against Jews such as
the Holocaust and the Inquisitions by
accepting Israel as a Jewish state.
"Israel is the vehicle for Christian
repentance. With this model, Christians

and other Jews are not allowed to criticize
Israel, Palestinians are invisible and
Muslims are all terrorists," he said. "Based
on these guidelines, this group contains
many 'self-hating' Jews. However, many
people who are not self-hating Jews have
dissenting opinions from the ecumenical
deal. I am one of them."
The dialogue then moved on to deal with
issues, images and ideas with the intent of
creating what Anwar called "a venture for
justice and compassion." Anwar called for
people everywhere to create a "theology of
hospitality where the context of the movement determines the outcome."
Ellis went on to explain how he has lost
faith in the historical traditions of the Jews.
"As a Jew, I have been mourning the end of
our ethical traditions," he said. "Over the
last few years, the helicopter gunships that
have been used to suppress Palestinian freedom have come to symbolize Jewish ethics."
Anwar then put this idea into context
with recent events. "We have always had to
deal with the media image of Muslims as
terrorists. With the events of Sept. 11, the
challenges facing Muslims have been staggering," she said.
Ellis ended his side of the dialogue with
a staggering proposition. "What we have
been doing to the Palestinian people is
wrong," he said. "I claim that the Jews who
feel the same way that I feel are the ones
carrying the future of the Jewish traditions and the Jewish-Muslim relationship."
Once the floor was opened to responses
from the audience members, Ellis received
the opportunity to expand on some of his
more radical ideas. "In Israel, the ideal of a
vibrant Jewish life is realized," said Louisa
Boiman 'O3. "I don't see how you can be
Jewish and not want that place to exist."
Cynthia

issue of educating people about the current
situation in Israel. She questioned Ellis on
ways to present these problems to Jewish
people.
In response, Ellis was very critical of
leaders of the Jewish community. He said
that rabbis had to present a public face of
supporting Israeli actions because that is
what their congregations want to hear.
"Those rabbis," Ellis alleged, "are almost
completely ignorant of what goes on every
day in Israel."
Ellis went on to say that this debate
focuses squarely on religious issues. He
believes that there is a divide between
observant Jews and secular Jews.
According to Ellis, in general only secular
Jews have pro-Palestinian views.
Student reactions to the dialogue were
mixed. "I was pleased with the presentation," said Siddiqi. "There was much more
discussion on Jewish policy, but I feel that
was needed in this community."
"I very much enjoyed the discussion
tonight," said Akbar Nasser. "Things were
said before that I've never heard said publicly, and I feel as though they really needed to be said."
Reactions within Swarthmore's Jewish
community, however, were much more critical of Ellis and his beliefs. Malika Krasik 1
Geiger 'O4 disagreed with Ellis's opinions. "I
think he was underestimating the fact that
there are a lot of people who are Jewish ritually and culturally who feel like they have
to chose between being observant Jews and
finding a just peace in Israel," she said.
"I think the key to answering the questions is that people can find Jewish law as
a way to back up that position," she said.

Professor uses Islam as basis for pacifism
BY IVAN

BOOTHE

Irfan Oman believes Islam should be seen as an

"imperative to practice nonviolence." In a lecture last
week, the College of New Jersey professor summarized
the arguments of Muslim theologian Maulana
Wahiduddin Khan, who argues that "Islam is a movement
of and for peace."
Khan, Oman said, believes that "Islam is a complete
and perfect religion," yet "on many issues that many people would expect agreement, he has taken a radical path."
One of these issues, Oman said, was nonviolence.
Khan, born in 1925, has been publishing the journal Al
Risala since 1970. The magazine, printed in English, Urdu
and Hindi and available online at www.alrisala.org, promotes Khan's vision of Muslim non-violence.
Oman said Khan "wants Muslims to take an active part
in promoting peace
as a basis of practicing Islam."
...

Oman said Khan drew his pacifist beliefs directly from the
Qur'an, but that Al Risala uses sacred writings from many
religious faiths to support its philosophy.
"Islam must spring from the heart," Oman said. Thus,
the adherence to strict rules is antithetical to Khan's

beliefs. Because of this, Khan objects to strict religious
states like Iran and, formerly, Afghanistan. "A tree can...

not be said to be composed of things
one cannot construct the thing by collecting its parts," Oman said. Khan
uses this analogy to explain why state imposition of religion does not fulfill the Islamic mission. He also believes
that Islamic focus on the necessity of Muslims to be officially recognized in the organization is misguided. "To
Khan," Oman said, "only the essence to him, faith, and
the submission to God is required."

Oman pointed out that in the Qur'an, one of the names
given for God is Salaam, or Peace. Similarly, paradise is
referred to as the "home of the peaceful."
"Islam should be seen as an imperative to practice nonviolence," Oman said. In addition, Oman said Khan cautioned that "non-violence should lead to active promotion

of peace; it should never be confused with inactiveness."
One of Khan's spiritual heroes, Oman said, was
Mohandas Gandhi, the leader of the Indian independence
movement. Khan believes Gandhi's actions show that nonviolence "is more powerful and effective than violent
activism."
However, Oman said, Khan takes issue with Gandhi's
political activism. Khan "is against public protests
even
if they are non-violent," Oman said. "To him, the non-violent struggle implies accepting the status quo."
Khan believes that once resistance to laws, however
oppressive, has been inculcated, it cannot be gotten rid of.
"Islamic movements have thus continued to reflect a general resistance to law and order," Oman said.
Oman then moved into the meaning of "jihad," commonly translated in English as "holy war." Oman said that
even among Muslims, there was great debate over the
essence of the word. Khan, however, believes that the
usual meaning given is a corruption of it, and that "the ideology of jihad has been separated from its spiritual under...

standing."
Early military successes among Muslim rulers were
interpreted as being divinely inspired. Oman said. This
eventually grew into the "ideology" of jihad, which perpetuated the idea of it as an armed struggle.
However, he said, this interpretation could not really be
drawn from the Qur'an. Warfare is referred to using a dif-

ferent word, meaning "fighting," not jihad. Most of the
time, Oman said, jihad was used to describe only a struggle
and warfare is only one subset of this.
The Qur'an, Oman said, describes the "greater jihad" as
the inner struggle toward holiness. "Lesser jihad" includes
warfare but also encompasses service for others and political activism.
"Khan says that jihad has never been used in the
Qur'an to mean war," Oman said. He pointed out that the
prophet Mohammed only spent one and a half days in a
jihad, and this was a defensive armed struggle. The
Qur'an, Oman said, clearly does not advocate beginning a
war in the name of jihad. Its recommendation "is always to
avoid fighting, not to insist on it," he added. "Violence is
only an exception to the rule."
The Qur'an also "does not give the impression that war
is to be used for political expression," Oman said. Even
when a lesser, defensive, armed jihad is necessary, it "can
only be called on, in these specific instances, by an authority or a ruler," Oman said. "Osama bin Laden does not fit
that description," he added. Oman emphasized that most of
the Muslim world thinks of bin Laden and al Qaeda, the
terrorist network he leads, as radical extremists and as
inconsistent with Islam.
Oman said Khan believes that, in the modern age, Islam
should never advocate violence. "Since we are in the age of
freedom, there cannot be any reason for even a defensive

war," he said. "All forms of violence must be put aside,
especially those associated with Islam and jihad."
The lecture was part of the series on "Muslims in the
Contemporary World," which will conclude today with a
talk on "Islam and Feminism" at 8 p.m. in the Scheuer
Room.

USC professor criticizes
Bush v. Gore decision
Calls Supreme Court's November 2000 decision 'partisan' and 'inconsistent'
BY BETH REDDEN

Howard Gillman, author of the recent book "The
Votes That Counted: How the Court Decided the 2000
Presidential Election," said he had no idea that his
topic of interest would recede from the public spotlight so fast. "Honestly, how could I have known that
it would become a distant memory so quickly?"
Gillman asked.

Southern California, Gillman visited Swarthmore a week ago to

nothing could be done to remedy

Palm Beach County's butterfly ballot situation.
But in Gore v. Harris the Florida Supreme Court
ruled four to three in favor of Gore, ordering a
statewide recount of the "undervotes." It also, however, rejected Gore's challenge to discarding the
disputed absentee ballots in Gore v. Canvassing
County.

Thus Gillman believes the rulings delivered by
the Florida Supreme Court were not biased and were
instead born of a long-standing theme of Florida
election law: to count as many votes as possible
rather than adhere to legal technicalities that would
restrict this counting.
Billy Schwarz 'O5 was especially surprised to
learn that the decisions of the lower courts did not
seem to be based on partisan values. "Since the election was so complicated, it seemed as if the entire
election was partisan," Schwarz said.
Gillman believes, however, that the record of
good faith judgments ended with the U.S. Supreme
Court. "The main lesson of the 2000 election is that
the courts did an exceptional job at maintaining fairness," he said, "except for the highest court in the

land; the one that decided the election

Court."

It is inconsistent with precedent that the conservative justices would use the equal protection
amendment in order to halt all hand recounts in the
Court's Bush v. Gore decision, Gillman said. "It's not
probable to think that the Republicans in [the]
Rehnquist Court really think that ballots should be
treated the same way in every state," he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court's decision halting all
hand recounts and virtually handing the election to
Bush "was consistent with their partisan views,
inconsistent with precedent," Gillman said. He
believes that this is partially a function of the
Supreme Court's determination to prevent a constitutional crisis and to provide a sense of relief and
finality to the nation.
"The problem," Gillman said, "is that it is not the
Supreme Court's job to provide a sense of relief."

Gillman believes that even the Democratic
Florida Supreme Court, considered by many to have

its rulings. Of the five cases that

Lecture, sponsored by the political science department. His lecture, titled "Judicial Politics and
the Rule of Law in Election 2000,"
attracted a crowd that virtually
filled the Scheuer room
"I think it might be safe to say
that we all long for the day when
the most engaging thing to debate
about was Bush v. Gore," he said.
Gillman began his lecture by describing the decisions of the lower courts before moving on to the
more famous ones made by both the Florida and the
United States Supreme Court.
Peter Davidson 'O4, who described the lecture as
informative and interesting, said it as provided a
"clear, concise outline of the Supreme Court and the
lower courts' decisions."
Gillman explained that the 2000 presidential election was a situation in which "the nation's troubles
became a teacher's dream come true." Throwing out
the syllabus of his political science class, Gillman
and his students instead began their discussion of
the election fallout with the now infamous Palm
Beach butterfly ballot. Yet Gillman said that his
class's discussions concerning the legality of the ballot "quickly rescinded into memory as other issues
began floating around."
The issues Gillman found most intriguing were
those concerning the role of the courts, both of the
Supreme Court and the lower circuit courts, in
determining the results of the election. In the course
of his lecture, Gillman presented his argument that,
although the Supreme Court exercised bias in its
decisions, the other lower courts deciding cases that
affected the election's outcome, including the
Florida Supreme Court, exercised fairness and
objectivity in their rulings.
"We usually expect judges, even if we're hardheaded political scientists, to offer sincere judgment," Gillman said. This judgment, he conceded, is
of course affected by the political and ideological
beliefs the various judges hold. Despite this, Gillman
said that what people generally expect is that "on
November 8, the judges would rule the same way
about deadlines and recounts as they would have"
on Nov. 6, the day before the election.
It is Gillman's contention that all of the lower
courts acted in an objective manner in a situation
"where the pressures for partisanship were high, but
so were the expectations for good faith judgments."
In the Florida circuit courts, Gillman cited the exam8

pie of a Democratic-appointed judge, Nicki Clark,
who voted in favor of George W. Bush's plea to count
the disputed absentee ballots, as an example of one of
many lower-court judges who exercised good faith
judgments. "If you want to look at the judiciary as an
institution, when you get below the Supreme Court,
there's reason to feel pretty good," he said.

Athletics debate
affects everyone
ah, the busy last days
It was a year ago this week
of classes awash in papers, exams looming just over the
horizon when the long debate about athletics and academics boiled over. The Board of Managers' decision to
eliminate the varsity football, badminton and wrestling
programs came as a shock to most students, as well as
parents and alumni; the reaction was fast and strong.
When the Athletic Review Committee (ARC) was
formed two years ago, it seemed as though for the first
time in years the administration was making an effort
to respond to the growing feelings of resentment and
neglect from the athletic community. When what many
see as a rushed decision to cut programs was recommended, it seemed as though they might have failed mis-

erably in their task.
A year later, a completely new ARC seems to be
responding to and learning from the mistakes made in
the past. They are addressing the small yet crucial issue
of scheduling conflicts between coursework and athletic
events. Another step in the right direction was tackling
the larger project of renovating facilities.

Consciously or subconsciously we
were all asking, what is it about
my identity that makes
me worthy?
They plan to take up tensions in campus culture
next, which will be by far one of the most difficult tasks.
As everyone knows, attitudes usually don't change
overnight.
On Tuesday, "CBS Sunday Morning" came to the college as part of its story about college athletics. "We
wanted to raise the question of the place of athletics in
an academic setting," Jon Frankel, the CBS correspondent working the story, said.
In a group interview with Frankel, former football
player Randy Keim 'O2 said he wouldn't send any athletes from his high school to Swarthmore. "I don't think
that they'll be respected as athletes here," he said.
It is these feelings that, through the ARC, the college
must work to resolve.
It is apparent that now, a year after long-buried conflicts erupted into angry confrontations between administrators and students, parents and alumni, emotions
still run deep not only among those directly and indirectly affected by the cuts but also anyone who has ever
wondered about their place at this school. With thousands of qualified applicants vying for only a few hundred chances to attend this school, it's no wonder that
almost everyone here feels at least momentarily inse-

cure.

When those in power
yes, the opinion of the adults
here still have the teacher's influence over us
decide
that a segment of this population is involved in a program they no longer wish to support, it makes each and
every one of us question our place here. Indeed, many
students who were in no way affected by the cuts were
up in arms on both sides of the debate. And consciously
or subconsciously we were all asking, what is it about
my identity that makes me worthy?
These worries inevitably bring us back to the speech
that all of us hear from Dean of the College Bob Gross
when we arrive at Swarthmore. But the "no one is an
admissions mistake" mantra becomes less comforting
when it becomes clear that even the college's vision of
what this student body should look like is in flux.
No one has the perfect formula for balancing academics and athletics. But the search must still continue for
the best way to heal from the events of last year and
address the problems still being identified. With the
memory of the first week in December 2000 in mind, we
hope that the ARC will stand with the support of the college until all of these issues have been resolved.

LETTER TO THE lETTOTI

A resource commitment, but not enough
Dear Editor:
In February 2001, President Al Bloom acknowledged to
members of the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign
that when a pattern of injustice characterizes the society
around us, choosing to base our own practices solely on
that prevailing pattern is problematic. The Staff
Compensation Review Steering Committee (CRSC) has
addressed this issue by articulating a compensation philosophy that recognizes the college's special responsibility
to its lowest-paid staff. While commending this philosophical shift, the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign is
concerned that the committee's initial recommendations
will not fulfill the stated philosophical intentions.
The most expensive of the recommendations is one that
gives less attention, not more, to lower-paid staff. While
increasing the college's retirement contribution by 2.5 percent of income would provide a tangible benefit to all, we
question the distribution of that benefit. Because it is
based on a percentage of income, a disproportionate
amount of the roughly $450,000 needed to implement this
recommendation for staff will go to the higher-paid; implementation for faculty will require another $400,000. So this
recommendation represents a commitment of about
$850,000 toward a benefit which in dollar terms does not
mitigate societal disparities but perpetuates them.
The proposal of a $9 Swarthmore minimum wage seeks
to remedy the problem of disparities in compensation but
falls short as it affects only 30-40 workers. Even with a $9
minimum, many staffmembers will receive wages below
the 2001 standards for family self-sufficiency wages in this
area published by the Women's Association for Women's
Alternatives. These standards range from $12.32 an hour
for each parent in a family offour to $16.09 for a single parent with one child. We estimate this recommendation will

require less than $lOO,OOO to implement. Why, if a major
prong of the philosophy emphasizes the college's responsibility to its lowest-paid staff, should only $lOO,OOO go to
such an effort, while $850,000 contributes to a recommendation that perpetuates societal disparities? The college's
willingness to commit substantial resources to compensation priorities is encouraging; we maintain that this com-

mitment can and should be channeled more directly
toward fulfilling the stated philosophy of responsibility to
its lowest-paid staff. We hope the committee, the administration, and the board will work to make the final recommendations fully embody their stated philosophy.

Just call him John
'civil liberties' Ashcroft
Apparently, renaming the Justice Department after
Bobby Kennedy wasn't enough to silence critics of the Bush
administration's growing civil liberties problem. On the
day of the ceremony, Kennedy's daughter Kerry gave a
speech on Capitol Hill in which she told her daughter,
"Cara, if anyone tries to tell you this is the type of justice
your grandpa would embrace, don't you believe it."
You know, it's at times like this that I am grateful for my
close connections to the Bush administration. Concerned
about recent signs that the new attorney general
John
"We Have No King But Jesus" Ashcroft
is not a big
defender of civil liberties, I called up Uncle Dick at his
undisclosed telephone number and asked him what was
going on. Of course, he was very reassuring.
Turns out that at least one of the United States attorney's
offices responsible for interviewing 5,000 Middle Eastern
men in America on temporary visas has decided to "invite"
them for questioning rather than drag them into their head-

quarters whether they wanted to come or not. How kind.
I've been told this idea came from the top down. The terer, Middle Eastern guests shall be greeted kindrorists
ly when they walk in the door, Ashcroft has ruled. They
shaU be offered coffee and donuts, hummus and tabouleh,
baba ganoosh. Provide them with reading material: Time,
the Qu'ran or a copy of the popular germ warfare cookbook,
"Scientific Principles of Improvised Warfare and Home
Defense Volume 61: Advanced Biological Weapons Design
and Manufacture." Make sure they can watch some television if they're bored, tune in to the Al-Jazeera television
network. Make them feel at home. Racial profiling will not
be tolerated here at the Department of Justice.
The local investigators may not care much for the
Constitution, I've been told, but John Ashcroft is out there
protecting it every day. He wants to make sure our Middle
Eastern guests are offered lawyers before they can say
"Allah." And not just any old lawyers: ACLU lawyers! Alan
Dershowitz! Clarence Darrow himself! Yes, Miranda warnings will be provided in English, Arabic and Satanic.
As for why Ashcroft has refused to release the names of
over 1,000 individuals, mostly Middle Eastern men, who
have already been detained, without criminal charges, that
also lies in his deep concern for civil liberties. "I'm not
going to develop some sort of blacklist," he declared, citing
the privacy rights of the detainees.
You can bet that these noble principles will drive the
Justice Department's prosecution of non-citizens before
secret military tribunals that President Bush has just
authorized. After all, the reputation of anyone tried and executed for terrorism would be tarnished if it were broadcast
on Court TV. Hence this convenient system of relaxed rules
of evidence, two-thirds vote for execution, and no chance to
appeal: the quicker things go, the less time to violate rights.
As for the new FBI plan to spy on religious and political
groups to make sure they're not harboring terrorists, I have
been assured that John Ashcroft will see to it that the
United States is a country of equal opportunity surveillance. Palestinians, mosques and the Nation of Islam will
have as great an opportunity to be wiretapped now as
Martin Luther King and the Black Panthers had in the
19605. We can call him J. "Edgar Hoover" Ashcroft.
Finally, Uncle Dick has given me his word that these
minor alterations to the rules of justice here in the homeland are temporary war measures. Things will go back to
normal as soon as this "war on terrorism" is over with.
Because, you know, he'll be around that long. I guess
these chats with Uncle Dick haven't been working out so
well after all. Maybe I should be looking elsewhere. I should
give Ariel a call, see what he's up to these days.

Israel: My beloved country
Jewish state—a state with egalitarianism as its benchmark.
It began with a bunch of Russians,
mostly under 20, who thought the
Jewish operation was an opportunity
to create a new society. Believing that
everyone should participate in
labor— not by exploiting one another

BYYEHONATHAN BRODSKI
I go to Israel at least once a year
and every time the plane lands,
everyone onboard begins to cheer. I
can't explain what it is that comes
over me, why I do too. It's not just the

tortuous plane flight. Stepping off the

plane, I feel like the reaction is palpa-

ble, as though the warm humid air
welcomes me, makes me forget that I
ever left.
I've tried to make sense of the gut
reaction I have once I leave the
plane—the urge to kneel to the
ground like a Muslim arriving in
Mecca. Every time, I want to rush
down the escalator, put my knees to
the floor and my lips to the earth. I
can't explain it in words, the magnetic attraction of this place.
I can't brag about peace in my
country, because the week's paper
proves that the situation is desperate.
Like its history, Israel's present is no
fairy-tale. But there are stories to this
country, some even strangely uplifting especially in times of discouragement. There's one story in particular
that keeps me up a lot these days, a
story about a time before me, when
Jews were more united in their
ideals. Unlike today's torn and bleeding Israel that struggles to carry on,
the Jewish community of yesteryear
was determined to find a harmony
within itself.
The story is one of the kibbutz,
Israel's communal farm, and it's a
subject that interests me because it
inspires me to think about what people can achieve when they consolidate their efforts. The first kibbutz
started at the turn of the century with
volunteers who saw communal-living
as the most efficient way to develop a

•

but by doing the work themselves—these Marxists confronted a wild,
largely barren land. The women
protested against work in the kitchen
and demanded the right to help break
rocks into gravel. Traditionally
deprived a connection to the land in
Europe, the young men who had left
their bourgeouis parents' homes surrendered themselves to the fields.
The kibbutz was a revolution in
that it tied Jews to the land, but it was
the country's breadbasket in more
ways than just agriculturally. Israel's
fourth prime minister, Golda Meir
was a tough cookie, widely known as
"the only Man in a parliament of
men." But I suspect that her tough-

ness came from an education that didn't distinguish between men and
women, or even between members,
of work performed.
regardless
Equality on the kibbutz came voluntarily: your children were my children, and your work became mine
too—the early pioneers even shared
clothes, and many kibbutzim had
cash boxes in the dining area for anybody wanting spare change. In effect,
the kibbutz became the Israeli family,
one that shared profits and losses,
friends and enemies.
I think of the kibbutz whenever I
feel alienated at school, because it too
was an international community that
assimilated people from all over, Jews
with little in common except for these
unifying ideas. But maybe the prereq-

uisite for that cohesion is a determination that comes from the self. Israel

as a whole never became one big kibbutz either, but I would like to think
that its success as a state owes itself
to the investment people made in one
another. Israelis are not amongst the
best mannered people
but their
rudeness is simply evidence that like
brothers, they don'trequire manners.
I've learned to see their frankness as
a key to that suffering family.
Today, the 2.5 percent of the country living on kibbutzim produce a

third of Israel's agricultural output.
But the kibbutz's main contribution
to the country was made long ago. It
was an ideology, one that emphasized
trust, not fighting between factions or
religions. I make no accusations, but
perhaps the lessons of history offer
hope for the future.
I remember thinking about this
last April on a bus to Jerusalem. I had
little room, but on my lap was a book
about the first Prime Minister of
Israel, Ben Gurion. The page was
turned to a picture of him in the fields
with a subtitle: "I don't have bread,
but I have a dream!" Just then, I realized the head of an uzi machine gun
touching my ear, a frequent interaction when buses are full in Israel.
"Excuse me," I said in Hebrew.
"Oh, I'm sorry," the soldier with
the olive suit replied. I realized then
that the most important ingredient in
the relationship between Arab and
Israeli is far more scarce than the

already precious land most people
think will solve the problem. I'm not
even sure that the ingredient comes
from the land. The secret ingredient
is a deep trust in human beings, a
trust that requires great personal

resolve.

LETTER TO THE EDITIOR

Inuit plight important too
Dear Editor:
I will not attempt to rebut anything Jennifer Holzer 'O5 wrote
about the aesthetics of the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve
("Arctic drilling not necessary," Nov. 29). After all, one man's
desolate plain that gets no sunlight for 58 consecutive days every
winter and which, in the spring, melts into a sea of mud and puddles where mosquitoes make the air thick is another man's Eden.
If the ANWR were the size of the entire Swarthmore campus, an
area four times the drilling area could fit on the infield of the
baseball field. But if it's Holzer's moral judgement that we should
not use for oil drilling any fraction of our "collectively owned"
land, I will not attempt to dissuade her.
While Holzer's concern for the plight of the Gwitch'in is
touching, she would be more compassionate if she considered the
opinions of more than one Native American community. The portion of ANWR proposed for drilling falls is on the tribal land of
the Inuit, who favor drilling by a margin of eight to one in some
polls. The former mayor of the largest Inuit community there,
George Tagarook, has noted that a decade ago, the Gwitch'in
invited oil companies to explore on their land. No oil was found,
leading the Inuit to believe that protests by the Gwitch'in are
sour grapes. How curious it is that they would have allowed
drilling nearby, but object to it 300 miles away.
The Inuit want this oil badly, as would the Gwitch'in if they
could get their hands on it. They are not poor because they
choose to live off the land; they are poor because they have no
other options. If you have a heart attack in the poorest section of
New York, you go to a state-of-the-art hospital. If you have a heart
attack in ANWR, you die. No social program will help the Inuit
in the way that oil can. It is time for those who will never visit
ANWR and whose only interaction with it is to romanticize it as
an untouched wilderness to step aside and let those who have
lived there for centuries decide what is done with it. Swatties
have long been sensitive to the plight of Native Americans. The

Inuit deserve no less.

Haverford incident
was supposed to be
fun, not malicious
Dear Editor:
Phi Psi Fraternity wishes to express our sincere apologies for the disruptions we caused the
Tri-Co Community last week. We assure you
that this was intended, albeit foolishly, as part
of the good-natured rivalry that exists between
our schools. Unfortunately a few of the involved
parties were a little overexcited and things got
a bit out of hand. We wish to emphasize that
their excitement was not spawned from a
hatred for Haverford nor any other form of
angst but merely reflected the nature of the
evening.
Being a local fraternity and having all polit-

ical decisions made within the house frees us
from the necessity of the cruel hazing infamous
in typical Greek systems. We approach the
pledge process with the goals of unifying the
pledge class and introducing them into the
brotherhood. Phi Psi strives to serve as a haven
for social interaction for the entire Swarthmore
student body. Our doors are always open to any
interested parties and we plan to continue this
tradition for many years to come. We apologize
for any degradation of the good name of
Swarthmore. We look forward to seeing all our
old friends in the house and invite everyone
else to give us a try.

lOPINIONSI
DAVID ELLIS
Big Man on Campus

Money talks,
Swat walks
At last year's graduation, Al Bloom bemoaned
President's George W. Bush's speech at the Yale graduation a week earlier. Bloom claimed that Bush's address
embodied an anti-intellectual sentiment that is coming
to dominate the national stage.
I was at Yale that day. I watched Bush walk up to
speak as half the audience stood up and yelled at him,
holding up signs claiming Bush was destroying the
environment and ending a women's right to choose. The
president deftly deflated the universally critical crowd
the only way he could through self mockery. He lauded both the student leaders and the "C students." He
claimed that he and a friend had an agreement when
they were at Yale's library
his friend agreed not to
read aloud, while Bush agreed not to snore too loud. He
thanked the professor who taught "The History and
Practice of American Oratory" for teaching him everything he knew about the spoken word. Laughter bellowed throughout the campus Bush had won over the
-

crowd through the liberal value of self deprecation that
the modern upper class holds above all others.
But Bloom lambasted this speech for apparently not
being intellectual enough. I can only imagine how the
crowd would have reacted had Bush begun a discourse
on positive versus negative liberties. But essentially
what Bloom was asserting is that he wished the country's culture was a lot more like Swarthmore's.
Moreover, his line of thought implicitly suggests that
intellectuals should run the country over other types of
people, and that the intellectual's methodology in determining action and solutions is superior to others (such
as the business person's).
To be fair to President Bloom, I am putting words in
his mouth. In reality he was defending the relevancy of
the liberal arts education in the modern age. And he was
absolutely right in the sense that a Swarthmore education has prepared us excellently to succeed in all modes
of life, both as professionals and as moral citizens. But
how much of a role should intellectualism have in our
national life? We've had one intellectual president
Woodrow Wilson. Wilsonian foreign policy has been the
bane of America's existence ever since it was conceived
90 years ago. Wilson's high-minded ideals led to a preposterous worldwide policing mechanism that failed
dismally. The League of Nations symbolizes much of
intellectual thought it's interesting to talk about, but
it simply doesn't work in practice. Even today we must
absurdly justify acting in our national interest with the
Wilsonian ideals of legalism and abstract moral ideals.
Contrast this with America's greatest president,
Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln ran his presidency and made
his decisions based on a legal thought process. His rhetoric and his decision-making were impeccably reasoned, and for the most part his decisions turned out
brilliantly. Bush is bringing a business model to the
White House. He delegates responsibility and decisively
takes action when he concludes it is the right thing to
do. This thankfully contrasts with Bill Clinton, who
could brilliantly talk anyone into thinking that he was
actually on both sides of the issue.
Perhaps the best representative of what Swarthmore
intellectualism represents in the real world is Michael
Dukakis. Dukakis is a great man who served
Massachusetts well as its governor. But one anecdote
about him sums up Swarthmore intellectualism. While
he was governor he and his wife agreed to alternate
nights where they cooked dinner. Sounds great, right?
The only problem was that Dukakis had to work late so
much that the family would often eat at midnight. His
ideas sounded great, but in practice simply didn't work.
This is why I favor the business person's ethos over
the intellectual's. I love the Swarthmore education, and
like most everyone here, I have an unquenchable
curiosity for knowledge. But perish the thought ofintellectuals actually implementing their grand and impractical ideals.

Patriot questions domestic restrictions
BY RYAN BUDISH
At the end of fall break, when checking in at the airport
to return to Swarthmore, the attendant at the counter handed me my ticket and said, "Oh, by the way, my computer has
told me that you are targeted for a search." Sure enough, on
my ticket was a big red "S." First, security officials handsearched my luggage. Then, before boarding, I was searched
again. This time they hand-searched my carry-on items, and
then gave my shoulders and legs a pat-down. The amazing
thing is that no one, not even the couple ahead of me who
had been searched four times in one day, complained.
I think most of us are willing to make these kinds of sacrifices for our safety. We'll wait a little bit longer, endure a
little bit more and do it willingly. Many everyday events in
our lives are a part of our balancing act between our freedom
and our safety. Every time you get in a car and obey a stop
sign, or drive at the speed limit, you are accepting limitations on how you live your life in exchange for security. The
problem is that everything can be pushed too far.
While many of us at Swarthmore have been arguing
about the merits of the actions in Afghanistan, we've been
oblivious to the actions taking place within our country.
New laws, such as the far-reaching U.S.A. Patriot Act,
designed to protect us are increasing law enforcement powers. Just like stop signs or airport searches, they require sacrifices on our part. In addition, legislatures, including the
Pennsylvania House, are passing laws that deal with patriotism. Both the laws dealing with security and those dealing
with patriotism are being written with the best of intents,
but they will require the sacrifices of civil liberties, and we
must understand before we accept them.
In the Pennsylvania House, our legislators passed bill 592,
which requires students in public, private and parochial
schools to say the pledge of allegiance or the national
anthem every day. The only way to be exempted from this is

with a note from a parent. The bill also calls for a "brief period of silentprayer or meditation with the participation of all
the pupils" every morning. It passed with only one vote
against it, and while I believe its ideals are noble, the bill
goes too far.
As someone who loves his country and is a firm supporter of the war in Afghanistan, one of the most moving images
for me was the sight of the men in Kabul removing their
state-mandated beards and the women removing their face
coverings. That these people will now have some of the same
freedoms that we have, and will hopefully soon have the
right to vote, is an amazing thing. But with that image in
mind, how can we say that we are defending our freedom by
attacking Afghanistan if we are going to mandate that students must pray or meditate and say the pledge of allegiance
every day? We should encourage students to say the pledge
of allegiance, but they should say it because they are proud,
not because we force them to.
I believe prayer can be quite powerful. Just as it would be
wrong to deny students the right to pray, it is equally wrong
to force a moment of prayer on all students. The act of introducing a time for prayer in school raises serious questions
as to how it will be implemented. These decisions are best
left to local school boards. If a community decides that they
believe in a moment of prayer or meditation, or if they

decide that every child should say the pledge, that is their
right, but the state has gone too far with this bill.
We live in a great nation, but too often on this campus we
discuss the problems with America. Right now we need to
pay attention to what makes America great: our freedoms.
And as we defend freedom abroad, we cannot afford to be
apathetic to our freedoms here. The College Democrats want
to encourage everyone to take a moment to learn what our
leaders are doing, and if you think the sacrifices of civil liberty are too great, exercise that freedom of speech that is so

valuable.

Self interest rightly understood
DANN NASEEMULLAH
In Search of Values
The semester is almost over, bringing to a close one of the
most scary and hellish periods of anyone's life. I remember
being woken up at 9:00 a.m. nearly three months ago to see
two planes flying into the World Trade Center, and I hope I
never forget what I felt that day, what all of us felt that day:
a mixture of pain, grief, loss, fear and anger. What has happened since that tragic day is what we dispute, what we
argue over constantly, what we get angry about now. I don't
know whether there is a way to bridge the gap between those
who advocate the war and those who oppose it. We all live
under a veil of ignorance and therefore have to make moral
decisions in the face of imperfect information, and I certainly don'tbelieve the line that we must trust the U.S. government in its "expert" assessments of the situation.
One of the first questions is: was the United States justified in feeling that it needed to strike out against the perpetrators of the attacks? The answer: of course it was. There
really is no question about that, even in the minds of most
people in the Middle East. However, the start of the war
against Afghanistan was seen by most people in the Islamic
world as the United States needing to find a country to bomb
in a traditional manner, as opposed to using Interpol-like
measures to chase international terrorists all over the globe.
I understand the rhetoric about the Taliban being closely
linked to Osama bin Laden and that therefore refusing to
give him up was tantamount to 'aiding and abetting." Yet
that argument puts a simplistic sheen on what is a very complicated relationship. Any willingness that certain moderate
factions of the Taliban might have had to give him up was
hampered by logistical and internal political problems. The
United States demands of "capitulation or death" didn't help
because they prevented any third way in which Afghanistan
could've given up the al Qaeda leadership without losing dignity and integrity. An honest publication of the evidence
would not have hurt, of course.
Instead, it is the view of most in the rest of the world that
America mounted it's gigantic bombing campaign primarily
to serve as an example to any country that defies the United
States, and secondarily to destroy whatever al Qaeda presence there is in Afghanistan. This is a view that is vindicat-

Ed by the administration: a show of force was thought of as
necessary. No one with any knowledge of pre-1998 Afghan
history could say that the warlords of the Northern Alliance
are somehow more legitimate or humane than the Taliban.
What is the problem with the United States acting unilaterally in responding to an attack on its soil? This is fairly
simple: it is not attacking the "terrorists" in a vacuum.
American military force has had to trample many, many
people to achieve its objectives (whatever those may be) and
will probably have to trample over many more.
Since Sept. 11, the American nation has rediscovered its
national dignity, its national honor. This is a good thing to
the extent that it might create a sense of solidarity with positive spillover effects in addressing fundamental societal
problems such as institutionalized inequality and the lack of
welfare provision. However, American national dignity is a
major problem if it does not allow any other nation or people
to retain its dignity. The lack of "statutes of limitation" and
clear definitions in this war makes countries really nervous:
the "either you are with us or you're against us" rhetoric
does not allow countries to form their own independent sovereign opinions about what's going on.
If Arabs or Muslims feel they have no way to hold their
heads up high without toadying to U.S. values and institutions, they will turn to extremism, and that is the real problem here: extremism creates terrorism of the kind that the
suicide pilots at the WTC and suicide bombers at Ben
Yehuda Street share. Extremism touches every country it
is not just an American problem. Here is the key to the policy recommendations that Josh Galun 'O2 can't get a good
night's sleep without. If the United States truly cooperated
with other countries in a coalition against political extremism, there would be significant support. Certain policy sacrifices (a strategic retreat from the region) that would have
to be made, as the unequal and unfair application of power
is usually what creates extremism in the first place. A
newly-empowered Interpol would be happy to devote
resources to breaking up al Qaeda and bringing its members
to justice: there would be dignity in that.
I'm not saying that the United States is to blame for all of
this. Far from it. However, I will say that at this point, certain actions
such as a strategic reexamination of next
steps in a more multilateral framework
would be more
likely than others
say carpet-bombing countries like Iraq
in
that really have nothing to do with the current mess
making America and the world a safer place. While people
like Galun would call it politically impossible, I think I call
it "self-interest rightly understood."

the Board of Managers voted to eliminate

its recruitment and slotting policies with a
reinforcement of attitudes toward football
players as a partying, unqualified group that
lowers the curve. "It's the little things. When
I got back this year, a professor said, 'Well,
I'm surprised to see you here,' said Melick.
"A friend of mine said, 'Anyone who decides

We all deserve to be here. We're students like

Many of the former players who have
opted to transfer to other schools where they
can play football feel that in leaving
Swarthmore they are judged with perceptions
of academic inferiority. But at schools which
emphasize sports more than Swarthmore,
these students have not found that they are
dogged with the same stereotypes. Mathew
Rapoza, who for his junior year transferred to
Washington and Lee, a school which draws an
average of 4,000 spectators for football games,
contrasted his experience of student apathy
and derision with his current college experience. "Some people were pretty cool about
football at Swat, but there were also many
people that looked down at the football program," he said. "I can remember one girl

Time off
Brian

Byrnes 'O2, who opted to play football at Pomona College this fall, said, "I'm a
student-athlete. I go to school and I play football. This is what I'm used to, this is what I
love. I can't imagine a school year without
football, and vice versa. I am 100 percent sure
that I would have been miserable had I decided to stay at Swarthmore this semester, knowing that I had one year of eligibility left."
Taking advantage of that one remaining
year of eligibility has enabled Byrnes to
develop some perspective on the discrepancy
between how different schools integrate athletics into their philosophies, and the assumptions directed toward athletes in different
schools. Explaining how all varsity sports,
including football, are awarded a quarter of

Pomona, "athletics are seen as a vital part of
campus life. I certainly have not felt like anyone thinks less of me [at Pomona] because I
play football, which is something I cannot say
about Swarthmore."
Similar sentiments are echoed by the significant fraction of former football players
who opted to study abroad rather than return
to campus this semester. Doug Kneeland 'O2
explains his rationale for traveling to Rome
on a classics program this fall as twofold. "I
simply could not spend the fall in
Swarthmore and not play football," he said.
Additionally, Kneeland cites his dissatisfaction with what he perceives as a lack of
respect toward scholar-athletes on the part of
the Board of Managers as a motivating factor
in his decision to participate in a foreign
study program this semester. "Although my
absence gives in to the Board's wishes, I did
not want to spend more time than necessary
at a place which had shown such disdain for
my work and enthusiasm, whether on the
field or in the classroom."
Claiming that fellow students as well as
faculty members continually resurrect stereotypes of jocks from their high school days,
those who have chosen to remain here equate
a canceling of the football program based on

"

An opportunity lost
But it isn't just frustration at how they are
perceived on campus that serves as a lingering reminder of their former on-the-field
activities. Bitterness also stems from the lost
opportunity to continue to improve a team
that accumulated a 4-5 overall record in its
final season.
"Football was a viable program and the
guys were enjoying it. If they were going to
cut it, they should have done the numbers
out and done it in '9B" before the decision to
revitalize the team, said Ted Chan 'O2, who
played football during his freshman year, and
was also a part of another team cut, wrestling.
"In the long run, numbers-wise, it probably is theright decision for the college. But we
live in the real world, not an abstract, statistical one. There were real people involved,
and that's why the way things happened was

the college's attempts to move forward in its
plans for athletics revitalization.

the future
By Elizabeth Wright and Nicole Brunda
Two years ago this month, the Board of Managers created the
Athletic Review Committee (ARC), entrusting the high-profile group

to analyze the state ofathletics at Swarthmore.
The completion of the first part of the ARC’S task, proposing
changes that would improve athletics in a manner aligned with
Swarthmore’s academic focus, led to one of the most controversial
changes at the college in recent memory. One year ago this week, the
board eliminated varsity football, wrestling and women’s badminton.
After weathering the storm that the decision unleashed, the committee has spent the past year largely out of the spotlight. An almost
entirely new collection of faculty, students and members of the administration have been actively pursuing the second phase of the committee’s mandate addressing aspects of campus culture that continue to make the role of athletics a contentious issue.
Moving on from last year, the ARC has adopted an altered focus
and a new agenda. Essentially, the college is trying to “freshen up the

face of athletics,” ARC student member Katie Cloonan ‘O3 said.
Whether or not the ARC remains in a position to provide forceful guidance as the college attempts to navigate the challenges of revitalizing
athletics remains to be seen.
While the demise of three teams dominated debate last year, cuts
were not the only specific recommendations from the ARC that the
board approved. Two of last year’s recommendations have already
been implemented, such as the hiring of an assistant athletic director
and the creation of a student athletics committee. Other changes are
currently in the works, including hiring full-time coaches for every
varsity sport, devoting a substantial amount of money to athletics
facilities improvements and seeking to resolve longstanding conflicts
between academic and athletic schedules.
This last issue has been the focus of the committee’s efforts this
semester. In mid-November the ARC submitted a report to the
Curriculum Committee (CC) presenting specific issues which were
identified as likely to bring academic and athletic schedules into conflict. “The Curriculum Committee is a very important committee on
this campus, and the fact that they took it on is a big deal,” ARC student memberKatie Tarr ‘O2 said. The thrust of the effort is to “take the
student out of the middle” when athletics and academics events overlap, she explained.

The report intended to find a way to “develop cooperation so that

so messed up."
Echoing the need to examine both the potential of the team at
the time of football's dismissal and the emotional impact it had on
the players involved, Byrnes said, "I lost a chance to win a
Centennial Conference championship, and to bring Swat its first
winning record in a number of years. We put so much work into

building that program, through off-season lifting, running,
Wednesday morning workouts, recruiting and of course our inseason practices, that when we achieved success it was a remarkable feeling."
It is precisely this remarkable feeling that former football
players understand they will never again be able to experience at
Swat. In addition to their personal dissatisfaction at not being
able to compete, members of the last year's team also emphasize
the communal loss that the end of football spells. Framing football
in terms of the diversity its players lent to the school, Melick
explains how Swat's athletic program has been negatively affected by the presence of teammates who participated in other sports.
"I'm chasing down my own shotput because I'm the only
thrower [on the track team]. So I'm wondering if recommitment
to athletics is really worth it. The more strenuous exercise
machines are gathering dust because there are only three of us
who know how to use them," he said. In the eyes of those who
played, such is the effect of cutting football as observed a year

hence.

Yet it still hasn't sunk in. Not just yet. Even with the great
exodus of transfers precipitated by the abolition of the team,
even with the end to early morning practice, even with a rethinking of recruiting strategies among fraternities, the loss of football
hasn't quite set in. There are other things to think about. There
are the reasons players chose to stay: academics, social life,
friends. But, for the athletes that played, the athletes who
remember, there are certain things that just can't be replaced,
certain things for which bitterness can be justified by players.

year ago, in a meeting in Tarble
gym the day after the college cut football, you could see the anger on the
face of Robert Clark '7L You could see it as
he pointed his finger in blame at President
Al Bloom. You could hear it in his voice as
he snatched the microphone and raged
against an administration that had promised his son, Ken Clark 'O3, four years of
football at Swarthmore. "I was shocked,"
says Clark, remembering that day, but
"shocked" is an understatement. Robert
Clark was angry, and his anger delved to the

bottom ofhis heart.
Today, Robert Clark's anger lives on.
One year after the college eliminated
three varsity teams, alumni and parents
like Robert Clark continue to oppose the
decision in ways large and small. While
Robert Clark's anger may run unusually
deep, many still feel betrayed, frustrated or
disappointed. Whether it be cutting off
donations to the college, resigning from
alumni positions or discouraging others
from applying to
Swarthmore,
an
entrenched group of parents and alumni
have found ways to express their discontent

long after last December.

The emotions of those who still oppose
the decision vary strongly. Many parents of
former football players feel betrayed by the
college even today, and their anger still borders on rage. Many alumni worry about the
college's Quaker values in the wake of a
divisive decision made without consensus.
And even within these groups, the reactions
are unique for each individual.
For parents,
the emotions seem
strongest. "There hasn't been a day that has
gone by," says Robert Clark, "where I
haven't thought about this decision and felt
awful about it. Not a day." He has tried to
sever all ties with the college, but can't
avoid mass mailings. "It makes us sick," he
says, "to get mailings or the alumni bulletin." Robert Clark's son, Ken, who was the
team's starting running back last year,
transferred to Williams.
Nathan Bartner, father of Jon Bartner
'O2, says the anger and sense of betrayal has
only deepened over the last year. "There
was the decision, but then there were nine,
ten more months before another football
season came." Now, after that season would
have ended, his optimism has faded. Like

said, the pain of unrealized aspirations
has not lost its sting. The success of
last year has made it sharper. The lack
of control has made it linger.
"When I talk with the guys on the
phone, we ask each other what would
we be doing today," Alvanos said.
"Could we have given Western
Maryland a run for its money? Would
we have made a run at the conference
title? We talk about it all the time."
The small things drive home the
sense of wasted promise. "Not to see
the goalposts on Clothier Field ..." he
said, breaking off the sentence. "The
last time I drove by the stadium, I just
wanted to break down." Though the
healing process has begun, Alvanos
said he doesn't "know if it will ever be

completed."

The first step was moving on. This
year Alvanos took the head coach job at
Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and
has rehashed part of his Swarthmore

Robert Clark, he stays in touch with other
parents. The anger among parents, he says,
is widespread.
Robert Clark was captain of the
Swarthmore team in 1970, so his anger is
only doubled by what he sees as an invalidation of his experience here. "It's an
attempt to make your experiences non-legitimate," he says of the cuts.
Bill Robinson '6O, who also played football, decided to do something about what he
saw as a corrupt decision-making process.
After starting the Web site www.saveswatsports.com in December 2000, Robinson
helped found the organization Mind the
Light in March of this year. Today he serves
as president and maintains the group's Web
page and discussion group (www.mindthe-

light.org).
Among the many objectives of the group,
it seeks "to have Swarthmore's process of
leadership return to the inclusive, participatory and reflective system that made the
college a distinguished institution," accord-

ing to the group's Web site. Many in the
group see the college taking a dangerous
step away from its roots.
"They have basically been moving away
from the Quaker heritage," says Robinson.
He is still disturbed by the nature of last
December's decision. "The official position
was there was consensus not to have con-

that's ridiculous."
Robinson says that he has personally

utive board and "a lot of wealthy alumni"
who contribute, says Robinson. They are

currently spending $20,000 for a mailing to
the alumni community, and plan to spend
more in the future. Neil Austrian '6l, one of

the most prominent alumni at the college,
resigned from the board after last year's

decision and now serves as the chair of the

group. Austrian notes that the college has
cut off all communication with him since
his resignation.

and like at Swarthmore, more in sea-

sons to come.
But healing isn't so easy. Though
Alvanos is confident he has the full support of Hamilton's administration, president and Board of Trustees, the
wounds from Swarthmore still itch. "I
know this isn't going to be Swarthmore,
but a part of me has trouble trusting
that," he said. "It sits there, always in
my subconscious. The support here is a
breath of fresh air, but I still feel
scarred." The sense of confusion that
lurks around the decision is salt in
Alvanos's wounds. "Maybe there could
have been more solutions and more
time," he said.
The confusion, the pain, the simple
inexplicability of it all hits home when
he thinks of his family. His wife and
three children have had to move from

Rethinking badminton
By Mara Hvistendahl
As members of the badminton team lobbed birdies over
nets in the field house Monday afternoon, they focused on the
upcoming conference season. The team took first place in last
season's conference with an 8-0 record and hopes for a
repeat performance this season.
A year ago, however, they just wanted to survive.
The Dec. 2, 2000 Athletic Review Committee recommendations that eliminated football and wrestling also determined
that badminton would be demoted from a varsity to a club
sport. As word of the Board of Managers' decision to implement the recommendations leaked to the student body, the
team was left reeling, unsure how to interpret the decision.
As a club sport, the team would lose priority for athletics
facilities and be funded by the Student Budget Committee
rather than the Athletic Department.
The justification given for the cut was that the board decision changed varsity status so that it only applied to teams
with full-time coaches and recruiting slots, captain Wuryati
Morris 'O4 said this week. The badminton team shares coach
Dan Sears with the women's tennis team, and it does not
actively recruit, relying instead on students to self-select.
Swarthmore is one of three NCAA schools that offer badminton as a varsity sport, according to the NCAA Web site,
which defines badminton as an "emerging sport."
Almost a year ago to the day, badminton players defended
the varsity status of their sport in the Friends Meetinghouse,
which was packed with students who had gathered to discuss
the board decision. They brought up various concerns about
seeing badminton become a club sport
low priority for athletics facilities, tenuous funding, lost recruiting ability but
above all they emphasized the lack of justification for cutting
the sport.
Their lot improved when, in response to their statements,
President Al Bloom said the administration was willing to
reconsider the status of the team. Bloom met with five players
and Sears shortly after, and at the meeting it was decided
that the team would enjoy varsity status until all of last year's

players graduated.
The team will remain varsity until the 2004-2005 academic
year, at which point administrators will reconsider its status.
"Badminton does not put pressure on recruiting, so there is
not the same motivation for discontinuing it," Bloom said,
explaining the decision to "grandfather" the sport. He
acknowledged the importance of the increased visibility that
varsity status brings the team.
The badminton players contend, however, that they were
never formally informed of the decision to let the team remain
varsity until 2004. After the ARC decision, all mention of the
team was removed from the athletic department Web site.
Viewbooks and brochures printed last year also eliminated references to the team. The players got these omissions
reversed, but they still lament what they see as a lack of com-

munication with the administration.
"Even in December it was all about football," Morris said.
"Pretty much all communication has been initiated by us."
As for the future, Sears said he suspects the administration is uncertain about what the sport's status will beafter
2004. Whatever the ultimate decision, he said the team
would "continue to operate and be funded indefinitely."

THE PHOENIX

HIVING
The holiday shopping season has
begun and the cold weather has hardly
settled in, but one thing remains almost
certain: you're gonna need lip balm sooner or later. Ah, the bringer of relief to dry,

cracked lips. When you think about it, lip
balm isn't just a plain old consumer item.
Who knew such a simple thing could be

so complex? Ratings are on a scale of 1
(worst) to 5 (best).

Blistex (stick)

As of the moment, I'm using Blistex (the variety is
Berry). As far as lip balms go, the balm is okay but it
smells so, I dunno, medicinal berry-like, if such a thing as
that can exist. I bet all those active ingredients are the
cause of this odd odor. Even the name is kind of strange
Blistex. It sounds as if it's a protector of blisters or sores
creepy. No wait, it's probably a protection against sores
heh, now I get it.
...

Rating: 2

Chapstick (stick)
The last Chapstick varieties I've had were Strawberry
and Cherry. One characteristic about this lip balm is that
the scent is fairly aromatic. I remember not too long ago
(okay it was last semester), I had just put some on in the
library when a girl asked me, "Hmm, something smells
good. What is it?" And although I was pleased with receiving the compliment, I felt embarrassed when I replied,
"Oh, it's nothing special, no bath spray, perfume or candy.
It's my lip balm." Chapstick isn't as tingly on your lips as
Blistex is, but at least it doesn't have such an odd chemical
smell. It's name however, is a different story. A chapped
stick? Shouldn't it be called a chapped-lip prevention
stick? I'm glad I'm not in advertising.

for lip balm. It's kind of a cross between a toothpaste tube

ONE

As a lifelong vegetarian and the
product of hippie parents, I've never

quite shaken the notion that meat is
gross. That goes for pork, beef, chicken, fish, whatever. No desire to taste it,
(though I have before, by accident and
cruel pranks, and was unimpressed),
no feeling that I'm missing anything.
As far as a food source goes, meat can
live its happy little life, however it
chooses, away from me.

But that doesn't mean it doesn't
hold my interest now and then. I see
meat the way we saw way cool giant
bugs when we were little. Alien, kind
of gross, fun to play with and utterly
fascinating. People eat pig's bellies.
Think about that for a while. No, wait,
don't. But one thing is clear; my
curiosity must be satisfied. And what
better place to start than our own
Sharpies? Armed with nothing more
than determination, boredom, the scientific method and a perverse willingness to utterly gross myself out, I set
out on a quest: to determine the most
useful, strongest and best of the
Sharpies lunch meats.
The players in my game of science
were the seven meats available today:

Healthy Choice turkey, roast turkey,
Healthy Choice roast beef, ham, hot
ham, pepper ham and salami. Ah,
salami. I loaded a plate high with
meats, and slipped out the back door.
My first impulse was to see if any of
them bounced. Laugh all you want,
but I've never handled this much meat
before in my life. I want to know these
things. Sadly, no bounceage was to be
found. This is probably, all things considered, for the best. The turkey and
pepper ham did crumble on my floor
when I tried to ball them up, though.
Ewwww.
For further physical-property testing, I borrowed some "supplies" from
my hallmates and headed outdoors,
where utter disaster was marginally
less likely. Things were about to get

I'll never forget the numerous times I left one of these in
my pocket for some amount of time only to find it warmed
up like Alberto VO5 hair treatment and the Vaseline inside
was all melty and runny. As far as lip protection goes, this
stuff is pretty good; with a name like Vaseline, you can't go
wrong.

Rating: 3
Carmex (pot)
What is it with lip balms and the ending -ex? This lip
balm is definitely hard-core
it really makes your lips
tingle (I wonder how many active ingredients this has ...).
But then again, it is made for dry lips and cold sores.
Would you believe that Carmex has the most medicinal
smell even surpassing (gasp!) Blistex? This balm ain't your
simple balm. It is meant to be used and boy, does it work.
Although it's yellow-colored and densely textured, I would
describe this balm as Antartic/Artic/Himalaya/Andes

equipment. Mush!

Rating: 4

Soft Lips (long thin stick)
This must be one of the most elegant lip balms on the
market. It's a long, thin stick with an "invisible" twist-bottom. With such varieties as Cool Cherry and French

Vanilla, you know you're paying mo' money for the fancy
product packaging than for the actual product (there
seems to be less of it in this container compared to others,
in my humble opinion). The balm works very nicely

though, gliding on smooth and with a formula that has just
enough tingle to let you know it's working.

Rating: 4
Sweet Breath (pot)
Back in high school I made a "splurge" by purchasing a
tempting three-pot package of this lip balm. While the varieties enticed me, the package I had contained Rocky Road,
Banana Split and Mandarin Orange, and after tearing out
my hair to decide which one to use first, I opened one up
and found that the balms really did smell remarkably like
the variety they claimed to be. However, they appeared to
be like Vaseline, with only a faint trace of flavor. Oh well,
at least three pots of nice smelling lip balm.

Rating: 3

Candy Kisses (swanky flat metal pot)
The name says it all. I bought my watermelon variety at
home as an impulse buy. Boy, was I surprised. The consistency is like that of Vaseline, with a bit more stickiness,
and as for the variety that I had, it added a tinge of pink to
your lips and tasted like watermelon heaven. Candy Kisses
are made from all natural ingredients and they aren't tested on animals. I'm still convinced they managed to put a
good pound of sugar or so into one of these tins along with
the flavor variety ingredients. The fragrance from this lip

The best thing to happen to me all
year: this story. I never thought in a
million years that The Phoenix would
be willing to let me do a story on
local bars. Never. So, when my editor Suzanne e-mailed me saying that

LOCAL BARS

could not only do the story, but I
could also get reimbursed for
expenses paid, I had to re-read her
e-mail four or five times to believe it.
"I am the luckiest kid on the face of

But, hey, it's harder than you think to come up with
a bar. And after four or five
rounds, any old place starts to feel like home (but they really don't like it when you start pretending that the bar is
your bed and you pass out on it). There's a lot of hard work
that went into my analysis.
I judged 5 local favorites (John Harvard's Brew House,
Timothy's, Pappou's, Friendly Cafe and Tom N' Jerry's
Sports Pub) based on the following criteria on a scale of 110 with a letter grade reflecting overall performance:
1: price and selection of beer;
2: price and quality of food;
3: music;
4: service;
5: television use (whether they had the Packers-Jaguars
game on, or whether they had crap on; there's really very
little in between) and visibility of televisions;
6: bar games;
7: the space; and
8: student friendliness.
With these categories in mind, I set off with a crew of
three experienced bar-goers to make our way through the
jungle of suburban-Pennsylvania watering holes.
objective criteria to judge

John Harvard's (1001 Baltimore Pike)
The first thing to note about this place is that it is the
only brewery in the area and all of the beers are brewed on
the premises.

Beer Price and Selection 9: This place has 8 original
beers on tap. Almost all of them are very good, but they
are a bit pricey. The three that we liked the most were
the John Harvard's Pale Ale ($3.50 for a pint, $10.95 for a
pitcher), the Insomniac IPA ($3.75 for a pint, $1195 for a
pitcher; do not try it if you are a novice drinker) and the
Oatmeal Stout ($3.75 for a pint, SIL9S for a pitcher; the
dark beer lover's dark beer). The only beer that we suggest staying away from was the Scottish Ale, which tasted
like a flat, watered-down Guinness.
Price and Quality of Food 8: The Black Bean nachos
are some of the best nachos I've ever had. They have
black beans, cheddar and pepper jack cheeses (real
cheese is a rarity in bar food), guacamole, sour cream,
olives, jalapenos and salsa, all for $6.95. Their "Hotter
Than Hell" Buffalo Chicken Strips live up to their name
and can be purchased for $6.50. Basically the only drawback to the food was the price, and when you have had a
sufficient amount ofbeer you can't tell the difference
between these nachos and nacho bar at Sharpies.
Music N/A: They weren't playing music.
Service 10: Beth, the bartender, was very nice
Television Use and Visibility 5: They had three televisions, all placed at strange angles to the bar so that if
you weren't sitting at a table you had to crane your neck
to see the game. However, they did have the Green BayJacksonville game on every television.
Bar Games 1: They didn't have any, which is unac-

us, but the prices are certainly not student-friendly. They
do, however, have happy hour from 5-7 p.m. when pints
are $2 and there is an accompanying food special which
-

is also $2.
Overall Grade: B

Timothy's (204 Baltimore Pike)
First positive thing to note is that there are two bars at
Timothy's.

Beer Price and Selection 5: This place only has four
beers on tap (Bass, Budweiser, Coors Light and
Yuengling), and a pitcher of Yuengling costs $B.
Price and Quality of Food 8: Typical bar food, like
their ultimate nachos, which cost $5.95. They have a great
Buffalo wings special where you can get 50 wings for
$20.95, and Pablo Montagnes 'O2 claims that they're pretty
hot.
Music 4: Oh, cheesy, Top-40 pop, how do I hate thee?
Let me count the ways.
Service 7: On an un-crowded Monday night, the bartender, Tess, was pretty nice. But I have experienced
favoritism when customers that look like they have more
money than I do are given better service.
Television Use and Visibility 9: Out of 8 televisions, 5
are big screens, which is definitely a good thing. Most of
the televisions broadcasted the game, but several showed
the National Cheerleading Competition. (Pablo was too

feels impersonal. There's nothing really distinctive about

Space 8: It's pretty big inside and the space is well

Pappou's (415 Baltimore Pike)
First off, they sell 40s and six-packs until midnight (a
very good thing).
Beer Price and Selection 8: They have 10 beers on
tap, and a pitcher of Yuengling is $8.25.
Price and Quality of Food 8: Their pizza is delicious,
they have food specials every weekday, the Buffalo wings
are really hot (12 for $4.50) and supreme nachos are $5.50.
There's really nothing to complain about here.

Service 6: When Vick is there, he's always nice to
everyone. The weekend waitress is terrible, really terrible.
Television Use and Visibility 6: There are only two
televisions, which is not entirely their fault for not having 5 big screens because Pappou's is a really small bar.
However, they do always have a game on.
Bar Games 7: They have a whole bunch of video
games if you're into that.

Oh yeah, and his favorite is the roast beef, which is
kind of touching considering how much it sucked ass at
both durability and stickiness. What really matters
with meat, apparently, is not physical properties, but
what's in its heart. Or rather, what it tastes like.
So a skeptic might ask (though anyone who did
probably isn't reading this anymore): What's the point
of the rest of the test, if all that matters is what the meat
actually tastes like? Well, duh. Because I wanted to
know. And also because I wanted to hit meat with a
hammer. And burn it. And stick it to things. Think of
the gross bugs you dared your friends to eat in grade

1: The owner hates

Swarthmore students and claims that we are irresponsible and arrogant. He apparently had some bad experiences while delivering pizza to the campus three years
ago. However, that does not give him the right to treat
every student poorly because of it. I used to be a huge

me to set foot inside.
Overall Grade: C+

Friendly Cafe (800 Milmont Ave.)
Don't be fooled by the name, it's really a friendly pub.
This is the place I have turned to since Pappou's fell out of
my favor.

Beer Price and Selection 9: 6 beers on tap, a pitcher
of Yuengling is only $5.75 (!), and the bartender fills your
cups and then fills the pitcher (giving you even more
-

beer!). I love this place.
Price and Quality of Food 9: They have the most
extensive bar menu out of all of these places, the food is
good (try their nachos supreme-they're big, they're good
and they only cost $5.25; they also have a bucket of tacos,
individual pizzas, 40 Buffalo wings for $7 and daily food
specials), and it is all inexpensive.

Service 8: The bartenders are nice and they are psyched to see Swarthmore College students.
Television Use and Visibility 7: They only have two
televisions as well, but they also have the game on both
of them.
Bar Games 10: This place can't be beat. They have a
whole separate room for bar games that includes pool,
darts, shuffle board, basketball (the arcade game where
you're just shooting for points), bowling (another arcade
game) and videogames. They win.
Space 9: They have three separate spaces: one for

you your food).

Tom N' Jerry's Sports Pub (1006 MacDade Blvd.)
For a sports bar, this place is the best. First thing to
note: two bars and so many television screens.
Beer Price and Selection 9: 8 beers on tap (everything from Budweiser to Laßatts).
Price and Quality of Food-N/A: At this point we were
too hammered and full of nachos and wings to eat any-

thing more.

Music 10: Good classic rock. So rare nowadays.
Service
10: The bartender, Jack (a.k.a. Jackson, or
Jaxon), was great to us and gave us a free round. He
hung out with the customers, which is a great thing that
you don't see bartenders do very often. The waitresses
were wearing skimpy referee's outfits, which didn't bother me because they were also very nice.
Television Use and Visibility 10: This place is unbelievable! They have 12 televisions, three of which are big
screens, and you can see at least one from anywhere in
the bar. They also made good use of them by broadcasting the game on some and Sumo wrestling (!!!) on the others.
Bar Games 8: 2 pool tables
Space 9: As big as Timothy's inside, but sectionedoff better. Nothing obscured the view of the televisions,
and the two open bars directed traffic to opposite ends of
the room, leaving the middle less crowded.
Student Friendliness 10: Again, the bartender, Jack,
was the highlight of this bar.

Pro: Beautiful and quiet. Yay for nature!
Con: Far away, and can be frightening at night without a flashlight.
Privacy Factor: 2 (as private as you want it to be).
Balcony of Upper Tarbie
Walk up the stairs to Upper Tarbie, toward the windows, and out the balcony
door. It's largely unfrequented, but its emptiness is a little more unsettling than
calming (especially when set next to the action on Parrish Beach). You feel in
control, but you get the sense that the experience is a little too voyeuristic to feel
comfortable. The plastic chairs are sticky and wet, and candy wrappers litter the
ground. There's potential here, but the current state just doesn't quite cut it. The
worst part is that you're continually being interrupted by your friends who point
at you and shout, "Howja' get up there?" The best part is when you smirk and
say, "I flew."

Pro: Let's face it those on the balcony are keepin' it real.
Con: It's kind of gross.
Privacy factor: 7 (everyone can see you).

Whisper Bench
This is my personal favorite. Al Bloom's back yard right off Cedar Lane
boasts a pretty little bench with unique acoustics (whisper into it and you'll
understand). It's romantic and secluded. The only passers-by are professors who
walk their dogs (which, admittedly, can be a little distracting, whether you like
dogs or not). In fact, this place is so romantic and secluded, that it doubles as one
of the best make-out spots on campus (study breaks were never more enjoyable).
Pro: The Whisper Bench isn't a place, it's an experience.
Con: Big dogs that bite.
Privacy factor: 1 (great for snogging and beyond).

Sanctions against
fraternity possible
From ARRESTS, pg. 3
the students would lessen. In addition, he said he thinks the trespassing charge will be dropped, since Haverford, as a Tri-Co member,
is always open to Swarthmore students.
Sergeant Jack Walsh of the Haverford Township police department agreed with Farber that the charges would most likely be
reduced. "I'm sure their lawyers will argue that this was a college fraternity prank and they aren't real criminals," he said. "But the fact
remains that they're facing serious charges."
All six face two counts of burglary in the first degree, which could
result in up to 20 years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine. Walsh said
this was an unlikely sentence for the students.
He refused, however, to speculate on what their actual sentence
would be. "There's too many variables involved," he said. "But I
expect that this case would go to common pleas court," where the six
students will face some, if not all, of the charges.

'There's blame to be shared'
Dean of the College Bob Gross said he also anticipated that the official charges would be lessened, but that Phi Psi and the six students
should also expect punishment from the college. Though expulsion is
not under consideration, Gross did say that all six had been placed on
academic probation for an indefinite period of time and that further
action could be taken, particularly against Rooney, Hernandez and

Moriarty.

As for punishment against Phi Psi itself, "We're still wrestling
with what we're going to do," Gross said.
"One extreme would be the suspension of their lease and terminating them as a fraternity," he said. Other possible action includes
sanctions on future Phi Psi activities and possibly holding all the fraternity's brothers responsible for the crimes and subjecting each to
punishment.
According to Gross, every fraternity member is "just as culpable"
as the six arrested. "There's blame to be shared," he said.
"It's unfortunate that people want to belong so badly that they're
willing to suspend their good judgment and do stupid things," he
added. "It was my sense it would go without saying that hazing of this
kind would be unacceptable. But clearly now it has to be said."

The dean, however, doubted that Haverford would request drastic action against the pledges or Phi Psi. "My sense is that they're
not out for blood, that they see this as a longstanding and friendly
rivalry between the two schools, and occasionally some students
cross a line they shouldn't," he said. "I think they're seeing this in
context." He recalled a similar situation several years ago, when a
Haverford fraternity left a burning "H" on Swarthmore's athletic
field. No drastic action was taken against the guilty Haverford fra-

ternity.

Gross added that he would have expected Swarthmore's public
safety to behave in the same way as did Haverford's. "In a confusing
situation like this, they might not have known what they were dealing with and needed backup," he said. "It does not seem to me like an
unreasonable call."

and said, 'Here are laws I think we're breaking,' one could really have
a dialogue coming out of this perspective."

Many students were hesitant in going on the record with their
views. However, Rachel Kobrin, adviser for Jewish life, summed up
the reactions by many of the Jewish students. "I do not believe that
was a dialogue," she said. "We saw two people who have very similar and very strong opinions speaking from one perspective. There
was a complete absence of historical consideration of past injustices
against Jews. I wholeheartedly support Jewish-Muslim dialogue, but
this was not dialogue."
Kobrin did not feel that Ellis had presented both sides of the
issues. "I found it to be very interesting that Ellis cited a need for
Jews to apologize for what Israelis have done but did not once ask for
apologies for what Arabs and Palestinians have done," she said.
"These include many numerous anti-Semitic actions in the past and
numerous actions that continue to happen today, such as blowing
themselves up in order to kill 26 Jews just a few days ago in
Jerusalem and Haifa."
In response to this presentation, Kobrin led a group of Jewish students in a dinner discussion last night to talk about reactions to the
ideas presented Tuesday.

Women's basketball wins

Women's basketball
player of the week

BY BRENDAN KARCH

Name: Katie Robinson 'O4
Position: Guard
Hometown:Medfield, PA
Robinson earned her second consecutive
Player of the Week accolade with outstanding
back-to-back performances in the Seven
Sisters Tournament. The sophomore guard
had a career best 29 point performance. In
the championship round on Sunday,
Robinson had a career best-double double,
tying her career best 29 points and tearing
down a career-high 18 rebounds. She was
named Outstanding Defensive Player of the tournament and earned AllTournament honors, averaging 25.3 ppg in three outings.

Ali Furman 'O3 shattered the school's record
for career 3-pointers as women's basketball beat
Washington College last night, 87-63.
Furman went 6-for-7 from behind the arc for 18
points, bringing her career totalfor 3-point goals
to 106 and topping the previous record of 101 shots.
"It was in my mind," Furman said of the
record. Because the Washington played zone
defense, she expected to get open looks. "I knew I
was going to get a lot of shots tonight."
The Garnet shot a season-high 56 percent from
the field, getting 18-point contributions from
Furman, Katie Robinson 'O4, and Kristen Lee 'O5.
Lee, who played 18 minutes, went 8-for-ll from the
field and 2-for-3 from 3-point range.
Swarthmore started the game with a 17-2 run
and never relinquished its double-digit lead.

Washington's weak half-court offense gave up
nine turnovers in the first six minutes, including
five steals by the Tide.
Washington capitalized briefly upon a series of
Garnet fouls and turnovers, closing the lead to 11
points, but Swarthmore entered the second half
up 14 points, 45-3
L
Swarthmore edged the Shorewomen 35-26 in
total rebounds, with the two forwards Robinson
and Heather Kile 'O2 each grabbing seven boards.
Kile played only 24 minutes last night, but still
managed 14 points thanks to a perfect 8-for-8 free
throw shooting. The Garnet shot 87.5 percent from
the penalty stripe, going 14-for-16.
Jerusha Rodgers 'O4, recovering from a torn
ACL, contributed eight minutes and two points in
one ofher first appearances since the injury. With
the win, the Garnet improve to 8-2 on the season
and 3-0 in the conference.

Another incredible display by Robinson was
predicted by an omen that morning: as she was
walking toward the field house a swarm of birds
made their mark by releasing a delightful stream
of defecation toward her shoulder.
Lesson of the week: getting pooped on is good

luck.

Despite the tired legs that were the obvious
result of two consecutive days of play, the ladies of
the Tide were on a mission to avenge "The Curse
of the Seven Sisters" and break the tragic losing
streak that had plagued the team.
There were no painted chests among the fans
in the stands, nor was coach Shibles wearing her
lucky garnet footwear, but there was no need for
such visual stimulation, as the Garnettes were
coming out with a full head of steam in front of
their home crowd.
They came out running against the Vassar
team and established a firm lead that they would
not relinquish at any point in the game. The
Garnet played a smart game against the opponent,
working the shabby Vassar defense until they
could get off a good shot.

Player of the week: Katie Robinson, golden
child. Robinson helped lift the Tide to a 63-51 victory with another show-stopping performance of
29 points and 18 rebounds.
While several members of the team assisted
significantly in the point tally, Kile was the next
high scorer with nine points, 10 rebounds and
four assists.
In addition to capturing a long-desired trophy
for the showcase, the Tide managed to post two
players on the All-Tournament team. Special accolades went to Robinson, who received an award
for "Outstanding Defensive Player" and Kile, who
was named the MVP of the tournament.
This win was a special one for the Tide who
were finally able to prove their merit to the rest of

and packing it in in the middle to prevent the

Shoremen washed up by high Tide
Co-captain Lewis injured in third minute, rushed to hospital; Garnet rally to victory
BY DERRICK WU

When co-captain Kyle Lewis 'O2 collapsed to the floor
three minutes into the game after being hit in the face by
an opponent, the men's basketball team looked like it was
in for a long night against the Washington Shoremen.
"It always hurts when you lose one of your players,"
head coach Lee Wimberly said. "You don't know how your
team will react."
However, the Garnet Tide stepped up its play to seal a
71-66 "must-win" victory over the Shoremen, with a strong
final push from Chris Loeffler 'O4 and Bayne Heersink 'O5
in the waning seconds of the game.
"Everyone decided to pick up on his energy," Joey
Armstead 'O3 said of Lewis. "We all pushed extra hard for
him."
Before Lewis' devastating injury and even the opening
tip-off, Tarble Pavilion was filled with excitement on Dec.
4. Based on Swarthmore's 109-107 double overtime victory
last season and a CBS camera crew on hand at the game,
fans and players knew that this game would be filled with
excitement. "We had a lot of confidence stemming from
last year's double overtime victory," Chris Loeffler said.
"We needed to win, and we knew that we could win."
David Pearce 'O3, who was one of four Swat players to
score in double digits, got the team going early in the first
half. Three minutes into the game, Pearce helped the team
jump off to an early 3-2 start by driving the baseline, hitting a reverse layup and draining the extra point after the
foul.
With 11:39 remaining in the first half, the team ran up
the score 16-8, Chris Loeffler came from the weak side and
blocked a shot by the Shormen's Aaron Goode, then hustled down for the pay-off layup on the other end of the
.

court.

"Our intensity was high, and we were pressuring the
ball," Eran Ganot 'O3 said. He rushed off to see his teammate Lewis in the hospital after the game.
Despite intense play and a great offensive start, the
team led the 1-5 Shoremen only 35-30 at the end of the first
half. "We played well, but we couldn't expand on our lead,"
the team's floor leader and point guard, Jacob Letendre 'O4
said. "We haven't had that many wins in the past [few
weeks], so we weren't used to building up a lead."
Aware of second half letdowns in their recent fourgame losing streak, the Tide came out with defensive
intensity in the second half of the game. When Pearce finished an off-balanced one-handed shot to go up 59-47 with
seven minutes to play, the 159 fans in attendance at Tarble
Pavilion stood up and cheered. However, missed free
throws and a Shoremen comeback built up the drama in

the waning minuand kept the game close.
"We need to start making our free throws," Wimberly
said. "At one point, we missed six in a row." Swarthmore
finished the game shooting 67% (22-33) from the line,

whereas Washington put in 88% (21-24).
In the final moments of the game, Chris Loeffler calmly nailed shot after shot to finish off the Shoremen. With
three minutes to play, Washington cut Swarthmore's lead
to three points, 62-59. After a stalled offense, Heersink got
the Tide back on track with a strong move to the basket.
He connected on one of his two free throws to inch the
lead back up to four points.
"Bayne Heersink was terrific. He made free throws and
critical rebounds," Wimberly said. Heersink finished the
game with 11 points and nine rebounds in just 17 minutes

of play.

However, Shoremen's senior guard Don Brandenberg
responded with a NBA-length three pointer to bring
Washington back within one point, 63-62.
On the other end of the court, Chris Loeffler picked up
the slack and nailed two critical free throws to inch the
lead back up to 65-62; seconds later, Brandenberg responded with another jump shot to narrow the lead to 65-64.
The next play, Chris Loeffler connected with Heersink
for the lay up to draw the lead back up to three. "Chris was
really clutch, and Bayne stepped it up for us," Letendre
saod.
The Shoremen responded once more to draw the game
within one once again. Finally, with 34 seconds left to

play, Chris Loeffler added another two points to bring the
lead back to three. "Chris Loeffler was good down the
stretch," Wimberly said.
"I got open shots," Chris Loeffler said about finishing
with a team-high 16 points. "It just happened that I started hitting them."
On the ensuing play, Heersink hauled down a critical
rebound with 5 seconds left on the clock; Chris Loeffler

was fouled for the third timewithin a minute, and iced the
game with two more from the charity stripe to shut the
door on the Washington Shoremen.
"The team played really well," Matt Gustafson 'O5 said.
"It's good to get a Centennial Conference win,"
Armstead said. "Our goal is to get to the playoffs, and we
learned we have the ability to win and respond to anything
that's thrown at us."
One thing going for the Garnet is the expected quick
recovery time of Lewis. After being rushed to the emergency room during the game, Lewis was diagnosed with a
retinal tear in the eye that was hit. It was a tense evening
for the co-captain, as he couldn't see out of the damaged
eye for about 45 minutes. "I spent most of [Wednesday]

morning and afternoon at the hospital," Lewis said. "They
ran some tests to see if the tear would lead to retinal
detachment." A retinal detachment would have required
surgery, something that would threaten most of Lewis'
senior season. "Luckily it's a small tear, and they sent me
home with some medication and told me to wear goggles,"
said Lewis. He expects to be back practicing with the team
once he gets some goggles.

Smooth waters for Garnet at Kutztown
BY TARA TROUT
The Garnet Tide traveled to Kutztown
University to compete in the Golden Bear

Invitational on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1.
Swarthmore was the only Division 111 team
among the nine teams represented at the
invitational, yet the Garnet women managed to capture the meet, beating out sec-

ond place East Stroudsburg University
with a score of 503-47L5. The men's team
also placed well, garnering second place
out of the seven teams present.
After a brutal week of practice, the Tide
went into the invitational tired and sick;
many players were injured. Despite all of
these factors, they still managed to have a
strong showing against teams that were
rested and whose practicees tapered down
in preparation for the meet.
The women's swim team was merciless
as Natalie Briones 'O3 and rookie
Katherine Reid 'O5 won three individual
events each. Briones easily finished first in
the 200 individual medley, managed to win
the 100 yard breaststroke and finished her
meet with a win in the 100 freestyle. Reid
won the 500 yard freestyle with an out-

standing in-season time, while blowing
away the competition in the 200 yard
freestyle. She had a amazing performance
in the 1650 yard freestyle, the longest competitive race, winning by over 14 seconds.
Other top performers included Davita
Burkhead-Weiner 'O3, who placed sixth in
the 500 freestyle. Rookie Melanie Johncilla
'O5 also helped the Garnet by placing fifth
in the 200 individual medley and sixth in
the 200 yard backstroke. Katie Stauffer 'O5
placed fifth for the Tide in the 50 yard
freestyle.
In a show of Swarthmore's overall
strength and versatility, Meredith Leigh
'O4, Tara Trout 'O4 and Amy Auerbach 'O2
accomplished the only 1-2-3 sweep of the
meet in the 400 yard individual medley.
Leigh also scored big for the Tide with a
second in the 200 yard breaststroke. Trout
tallied some points with her fifth place finish in the 200 yard butterfly. Laura Fox 'O3
earned points in both the 100 and 200 yard
breaststroke events, taking sixth place in
both. Erin Dwyer-Frazier 'O5 had an outstanding performance in the 200 backstroke that placed her fourth.
The women's team relays were also suc-

cessful, winning the 200 yard freestyle
relay with a leg each from Stauffer,

Briones, Johncilla and Burkhead-Weiner.
The 400 medley relay team of Christie
Tomm 'O5, Briones, Trout and Johncilla
placed second. Swarthmore scored a first
with the 800 yard freestyle team of
Johncilla, Briones, Auerbach and Reid.
The Garnet Tide repeated the relay endeavor by placing first in the final relay, the 400
freestyle relay, due to the efforts of
Briones, Johncilla, Reid and Auerbach.
The men's team had some outstanding
performances as well. David Whitehead 'O3
and John Lillvis 'O3 added two wins each
for the team. Whitehead won the 50 yard
freestyle and the 100 yard butterfly, while
placing second in the 100 yard freestyle.
Lillvis won the 200 yard individual medley
in a hotly contested race, and he also won
the longer race, the 400 individual medley.
Rookie Michael Auerbach 'O5 placed
high for the Tide in the 100 butterfly, earning third place, and also placed sixth in the
200 individual medley. Ben Morgan 'O5 had
a good showing in the 400 individual medley, placing second, with Eric Shang 'O4
placed fifth in that race. Morgan also

placed fifth in the 200 yard backstroke.
Jake Ross 'O5 was the only member of the
Tide to place in the 200 freestyle; he came
in fifth. He placed sixth in the 200 yard
backstroke as well. Captain Mike Dudley
'O3 placed second after a close race in the
100 yard breaststroke, and tied for second
place in the 200 yard breaststroke. Aaron
Modic 'O4 had a great race in the 200 yard
butterfly, placing sixth for the Garnet.
The men's 200 yard medley relay, consisting of Whitehead, Dudley, Auerbach
and Lillvis proved successful as well and
placed fourth. These four teamed up again
to place third in the 400 freestyle relay.
Ross, Dudley, Whitehead and Lillvis made
up the 400 yard medley relay which placed
third. The 800 freestyle relay finished second with strong performances by
Auerbach, Whitehead, Lillvis and Chris
Bussard 'O3. The 200 yard freestyle relay of
Dudley, Whitehead, Auerbach and firstyear Darshan Patel 'O5 placed fourth.
After great performances by both the
women's and the men's teams, the Garnet
Tide is looking to keep its momentum
going into the meet against New York
University on Dec. 8.

Teddy Ballgame
'"*

Approximately two years ago, my roommate and I
embarked on an almost impossible mission. Together, we
set out to bring some color (both figuratively and literally)
to The Phoenix sports pages. For a while there, I'd venture
to say we were successful, if only in the literal sense. Alas,
every good (or mediocre) thing must come to an end. So
today, for what is likely to be my last Phoenix column, I
decided to sit down with my old partner in crime, Ted
"Teddy Ballgame" Chan, for a peek into his depraved
mind.

First, let me give you a quick bio of the Asian Wonder.
In his first year, Ted extended his storied high school football career a whopping two weeks into college before finally hanging up the shoulder pads in favor of fantasy football
and sexiling his poor celibate roommate. By the end of
sophomore year, Ted became the first man ever to comprise 100 percent of the Swarthmore wrestling team. He

Ted was thrown for a loop last
year when the ARC made their
infamous announcement, "For the
improvement of the athletic program as whole, we have decided
to cut football, badminton and
Ted Chan."
was thrown for a loop last year when the ARC made their
infamous announcement, "For the improvement of the athletic program as whole, we have decided to cut football,
badminton, and Ted Chan." Undaunted, Ted turned his
sights back to his first love, baseball, a game he had neglected since his pre-pubescent years. In his fourth and final
year, Ted is now (not) participating in his fourth sport,
rugby. His initiation was made official as his puny Asian
virility could be seen swinging to and fro through Parrish
at last month's Dash for Cash.
Scott Kushner: Ted, you have-established yourself as
a man of many meaningless talents. Please share your
proudest moment as a Swarthmore athlete.
Ted Chan: Wow, that's tough. I was really touched
when my teammates voted me "Not the Absolute Worst
Baseball Player Ever to Walk the Face of the Earth." But
my true crowning achievement was when Coach Frank
Agovino told me I was, "the quintessential team player"
after I loaned my cleats to Lane "I Got It, You Take It"
Oatey 'O3 for our game at Ursinus.
SK: What's been your greatest challenge as an athlete?
TC: Let's see...there was the one time I was shootfighting in Willets against a 7'2" 330 lb. (read: 6' 5" 2201b.)
Brazilian Jiujitsu master (read: he had watched a video of
Ultimate Fighting Championships). Of course, there was
also the time where I wrestled pre-season Ail-American
Mat Rapoza 'O3 at baseball practice. Although he is 4 times
my size, I was able to use my leverage to launch him into
an inverted side suplex. But honestly, I'd have to say my at
bat against Haverford last year was my toughest challenge.
I sat the bench for 24 consecutive games without so much
as a practice cut in the on deck circle. I was convinced
Coach had forgotten I was actually on the team. Then, in
the last game of the season, coach put me in as a pinch hitter. I was so shocked, I hardly noticed when I struck out on
three pitches.
SK: As the baseball team's starting scorekeeper last
year, how did you prepare for a big game?
TC: The key for me is to stay well rested the night
before. No video games, no typing papers, and no intense
masturbation. The day of the game, I make sure to stop by
Tarble to pick up two bags of sunflower seeds and then to
the bookstore for a freshly sharpened pencil. You never

THE PHOENIX

Guard Ali Furman looks past Mt. Holyoke's Sara Belding. Furman is chasing Swarthmore's career 3-point record,
and needed just two more going into last night's game to surpass alum Kristen English's 101 career record.

how it's done, Kile named MVP
BY EMILY GRAY AND CAITLIN RYLAND
This past weekend, Swarthmore's own lady hoopsters
played host to the annual Seven Sisters Basketball
Tournament. The tourney's annual attendees included

local adversaries Bryn Mawr and Haverford, and from
the north, Mount Holyoke, Wellesley, Vassar and Smith.
Guest St. Joseph's College (CT) rounded out the field of
eight. Competition was stiff and the stakes were high, but
at the sound of the opening buzzer, the oh-so-sweet hostesses refused to hand anything out on a silver platter.
The Garnet Tide, for the first time in the history of the
tournament, earned those elusive Seven Sisters
Championship bragging rights and a really pretty trophy.
The Garnet Tide tipped off the weekend on Friday
with a sound defeat of the Mount Holyoke Lyons, 74-46.
The Swarthmore squad's unrelenting defense forced the
Lyons to connect on only 3L9 percent from the floor.
Offensively, the Tide cashed in on the other side of the
floor hitting 47.5 percent of their shots. Heather Kile 'O2
lead all scorers with 23 points and muscled down 14
boards. Katie Robinson 'O4 and Ali Furman 'O3 also put

up big numbers for the Tide with 18 and 13 points, respectively. All 12 Garnet players contributed on the court to
the opening game routing of the Lyons.
Saturday, Swarthmore suited up to face their next
opponent, long-time Seven Sisters rival Wellesley, with
dogged determination and pulled out the win 57-53.
Hating them right down to the sissy bows they wear in
their hair, the team had more than enough incentive to
want to trounce the team that has always treated them
like a pesky little sister. Well, this little sister is all grown
up, and came back from a half time deficit to show everyone who's boss with quite the defensive display. The
Garnettes got things started by turning up the intensity
in their zone defense, and forcing the Wellesley team to a
poor shot selection which resulted in a lower field goal
percentage in the second half. A concerted effort on the
defensive boards was another key to the Garnet victory.
Setting the winning pace for the Garnet was the contribution of second-year standout Katie Robinson 'O4 with a
career-best 29 points, nine rebounds, four assists, five
