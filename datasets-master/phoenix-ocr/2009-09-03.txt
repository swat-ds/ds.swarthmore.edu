New greenhouse wins award for eco-friendliness
ing," Project Manager Jan Semler said.
The Green Building of America award

BY KATHERINE ERNST
kernstl@swarthmore.edu
Real Estate and Construction Review
recently named the Scott Arboretum's
nearly finished Wister Education Center
and Greenhouse a Green Building of
America, solidifying its place on the cutting edge of eco-friendliness and putting
them one step closer to silver Leadership
in Energy and Environmental Design, or
LEED, certification.
The new 5,200 square-foot building,
which broke ground in November 2008,
will provide a space for a trained group of
approximately 120 arboretum assistant
volunteers, as well as for educational
activities, displays and other events.
Wister will replace an older, much smaller greenhouse, which failed to adequately
provide these spaces, according to the
arboretum's website.
"When we started the project, it was
obvious the old greenhouse needed to be
replaced; it was literally falling apart,"
Scott Arboretum Director Claire Sawyers
said. "We also realized that our programs
had grown substantially since the old
greenhouse was built. We had 20 volunteers then, now we have five times that
many involved. So if the Scott Arboretum
as an organization was to sustain existing
programs and to grow, we needed a building that would support our current program as well."
Most work on the building will be completed by the end of September as originally planned. Some features may take
longer to complete, however.
"We changed vendors for the greenhouse control system, which may impact
the completion date for computer programming for the window shades, heating
and cooling systems and remote monitor-

winner, selected from a 2,500-submission
applicant pool, was chosen as having the
criteria of using advanced new technologies and building something other architects should use as an example. In 2010 the
greenhouse will be featured in "Real
Estate and Construction ReviewNortheast Green Success Stories," the
arboretum website said.
The new Wister greenhouse will not
simply be an improvement in terms of
space and usability
it also will gain status as an environmentally friendly piece
of land. The Scott Arboretum is working
with six accredited professionals to earn a
silver LEED certification.
LEED's certification includes simply
"certified," "silver," "gold" and "platinum." The system rates buildings in six
major categories: "sustainable sites,"
which considers attributes such as storm
water control and public transportation
access; "water efficiency," such as innovative wastewater technologies and water
use reduction; "energy and atmosphere,"
such as green power, which optimizes
energy performance; "materials and
resources," like storage and collection of
recyclables and certified wood; indoor
environmental quality, like low-emitting
materials and lighting; and "LEED innovation credits," which rates the innovation of the design process and performance.
The only other LEED certified building on campus right now is the Science
Center.
The construction of the Wister
Education Center and Greenhouse
required approximately 8,050 lbs of concrete. Roughly 250 lbs of that, however,
was not actually concrete but fly ash. Fly

ash, a byproduct churned out by the ton
from power plants across theUS, has been
taking up large volumes of space in landfills. By mixing fly ash into cement, the
byproduct is diverted away from our
landfills and toward a less wasteful purpose.

Additional environmentally friendly
features of particular note are the 7,000
gallon cistern being constructed behind
the new greenhouse to capture rainwater
for irrigation
much like a large rain
barrel
and job-site recycling for all of
the demolition and building material

waste.

So far, almost 110 tons of material have
been recycled and thereby effectively
diverted from landfills. Furthermore, the
greenhouse will have a "green roof' covered with soil and vegetation and will be
lighted by energy-efficient bulbs and natural light.
"The college's facilities group came up
with an innovative idea that our mechan-

ical engineers designed around," said Dan
Russoniello, an LEED accredited professional from Archer & Buchanan
Architecture, Ltd. who is working with
the college to design and construct the
Wister building. "It involves using the
chilled water that serves the McCabe
Library's cooling system as a heat sink or
heat source, depending on the season, to
heat and cool the Wister Center.' This
design benefits both the library and the
Wister Center in that it reduces the
amount of energy needed to heat and cool
both buildings."
In planning for the center, the Scott
Arboretum raised $2.5 million for the
project on its own. The remaining SL3
million necessary for the project was
secured from the college. Although construction of the Wister Education Center
and Greenhouse is due to be completed
sometime in September of this year, the
Scott Arboretum has until 2014 to pay
Swarthmore back.

Alum launches campus info app for iPhone use
BY VISHAAL CHHABRIA
vchhabrl@swarthmore.edu

iSwat, the convenient new
iPhone application designed for
Swarthmore students, puts useful campus information in
users' pockets.
Matthew Thomas 'O9 created
the app to give back to the college. "I thought it would be a
useful tool for students, and I
would have enjoyed having it
when I was a student," Thomas
said.
The app provides students
with a suite of convenient tools
and provides visitors to the college with frequently requested
information. For students, iSwat
features a faculty directory, a
campus events guide, an interactive map that gives the user's
location, emergency information, the dashboard's Tripsaver,
the Sharpies' menu, job listings
and a listing of local restaurants. For visitors, iSwat provides tour times, admissions statistics and a link to application
information. The application is
available for free from the app
store.

Thomas,

who took

months to design iSwat, said
that he invites students to give
him suggestions so he can make
the app more helpful. Though
the app has detailed information
about the college, it is not officially
affiliated
with
Technology
Information
Services or the college.
Although the app originally
cost $9.99, Thomas said that he
made the app free to help out the
students and the college.
"Students shouldn't have to pay
for the app when they're already
paying gobs of money for
tuition," he said. He added that
he can make this design financially feasible by creating similar apps for universities across
the country.
Student reactions have been
positive. iSwat downloader
Jamie Birney 'lO called it a
"super dashboard on your
phone." He said that the app
could have helped him his freshman year.
"The restaurant listing is
amazing because it has the
restaurant phone numbers on it,
so [students] no longer need to
look them up," he said.
Birney said that he thinks

first-years, visitors and new college members such as Rebecca
Chopp will use it most.
According to ITS, 14 percent
of campus registered an iPhone
or an iTouch last year. Incoming
first-years and new purchases
could increase this figure. As

BoCoSoft, a mobile software
development company created
by Thomas, grows, he hopes that
iSwat will also be downloadable
for the Blackberry.
Since the app was released a
week ago, roughly 200 users
from 25 different countries have
downloaded it. Seven users gave
it the average rating of four out
of five stars.
In the future, Thomas hopes
that iSwat will feature student
club information with meeting
times, a Phoenix portal, a
library search tool and a student
directory. Moreover, he would
like iSwat to have a calendar
import feature, where students
will be able to transfer events
from the college's calendar and
their personal schedules to their
iPhone calendars.
While Thomas claims that
iSwat is his best work so far,
BoCoSoft has produced a few

these apps allow people to send

for free via Gmail. Other apps
include iUnitedStates, a database of fun facts about every
U.S. State, and World News, a
constantly updated database of

Though iSwat is certainly a
novel tool for Swarthmore students, the idea of a college specific iPhone app is not a new
one.
Other colleges such as Duke,
Stanford, Texas A&M and
University of California San
Diego also have their own apps.

begin discussing next year's budget
today in an effort both to seek financial sustainability and preserve the
college's values.
The Ad Hoc Financial Planning
Group, composed of board members,
administrators, faculty and staff, is
having its first meeting today since
last school year, during which it met
four times. On Sept. 26, the Financial
Planning Group will inform the Board
of Managers about its discussions.
Last February, the Board created this
group as a way to annually develop a
sustainable budget in light of a declining endowment and looming recession
in the next five years.
"[We ask], what are our priorities?
What do we look to maintain moving
forward?" said Dean of Admissions
Jim Bock '9O, who is a member of the
group. "And that includes everything
programming,
financial aid.
Everything."
No decision has been made yet
about next year's budget. Bock said
that while he can't say anything about
the class of2014, the college was able to
maintain all of the its policies for the
class of 2013 amidst a recession. Such
policies include need-blind admissions
and loan-free financial aid, which
promises to meet a family's demonstrated need.
From the end of June 2008 to the end
of June 2009, the endowment dropped
from $l4 billion to $l.l billion. As a
response to the declining endowment,
the college set this year's current
budget at $107.0 million, which is a 71
percent decrease from last year's $115.2
million.
According to a budget report last
May by Suzanne Welsh in the Finance
and Treasurer's Office, "Budget decisions were made in phases
in order
to have as much information as possible about the economy and its impact."
While in February the Board approved
the tuition, financial aid, enrollment
decisions and a reduction in facilities
capital projects, Welsh said that all
other decisions were deferred to the
May meeting. This was the first time
that such decisions have been pushed
back to the May meeting.
Last year, the Board of Managers
gave the planning group a- set of
assumptions that it should accept,
Welsh said.
One was that families' financial
need would increase. Another was that
the college should prepare to deal with
a smaller-sized endowment predicted
to decrease by about 30 percent last

March, but that since then there have
been "very good returns." Still, the
planning group members need "to
evaluate how confident [they] are" for
the future.
To name a few changes, the college
has decided for this school year to
freeze faculty, staff and student
salaries, increase student charges by
3.76 percent, start to have an additional 16 enrolled students, and reduce
spending in facilities capital projects
for the next three years. The reductions can be viewed on
the
Swarthmore Finance and Investment
Offices website.
At the same time, however, Welsh
said that this year's increase in student charges was the smallest in ten
years, citing both inflation and the college's consideration for families' dwindling incomes as reasons. Moreover,
Welsh's May report said that in the
2009-2010 budget there wouldn't be any
employee layoffs or changes in the
financial aid program.
Welsh claimed that the college was
financially stable going into the-economic downturn. The Board of
Managers published a report supporting this last December and updated it
in March. The report said, for example,
that the college had "a balanced budget" and a "low endowment spending
rate."
"[The college's] decline is going to
look relatively better than other
endowments'," Welsh said.

Group is open to feedback on the

Artist Daley plumbs connection between earth and body
BY ALEX HO

ahol@swarthmore.edu

"William Daley, Vesica Explorations," the first exhib-

it of the season in the List Gallery, plumbs themes and
ideas in pottery making as monolithic as its artist's own
accomplished six-decade career in ceramics. Opening
this Friday, Sept. 4 and showing through Oct. 31 with a
lecture on Thursday, Sept. 10 at 4:30 p.m., the exhibit will
feature the past decade of work from preeminent ceramicist and former University of the Arts teacher William

Daley.

It's the duality of the practical and spiritual applications of the vesica that makes the geometrical form akin
to Daley's inborn craft of pottery Stuart Kestenbaum,
the director of the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts
where Daley has taught, describes Daley's work as a pot-

ter as about far more than just function and use, as about
connecting with an art of making vessels and containers
as old as humanity. In an essay that accompanies the
exhibit, Kestenbaum wrote, "The pots remind us ofhow
we are connected to our past and to the earth and to our

own bodies."

of Daley's

Walking amongst the pieces (unglazed stoneware carrying the earthy hue of fire clay) is almost like visiting a
site of ancient ruins. Carpenter, who specializes in
ceramics, said, "The first thing that comes across is of
course the monumentality, the architectonic feeling that
come off of these objects. There's a mass that's just so
overwhelming in the pieces."
At the same time, none of the pieces seem to emulate
any particular time or place. The closer you look at the
pieces, the more complicated and inscrutable they
become. Many of them possess sharp angles where you'd
expect smooth curves, and skewed forms rather than
neat symmetry. Carpenter was also struck by the subtle
complexity of Daley's pieces. "I think the thing that's
most distinctive about the work is the consistency of the

out human history from the ships of the Vikings to the
tops of gothic stained-glass windows to the helmets of
conquistadors of the New World.

change that you see in the surfaces," Carpenter said.
"He's working with the play on light. He's working on
the textural capacity of the clay. He's working with
grinding and removing and polishing, so there's a richness in his surfaces that is just really, really rewarding
if you look. What appears to be an overall singular color

The pieces of pottery that compose the exhibit have
been drawn from collections from all over the world.
Bringing Daley's work to the List has been an interest of
List Gallery Director Andrea Packard and Syd
Carpenter, the chair of the studio art department. Both
found the timing of the exhibit especially fitting because
own familial tie to the college; his granddaughter, Sarah Daley 10, is an art history major here at
Swarthmore.
Although the pieces in the exhibit span a large variety of forms, they all originate from something much
more elemental Daley's interest in the simple geometry of the vesica. The vesica is created by inscribing two
identical circles through the centers of one another. The
result is an eye-like shape that, much like the pentagonal, octagonal and other geometrical shapes that Daley
has explored in prior work, sees iterations all through-

Aside from its functional manifestations, the vesica
has also had sacred significance through the ages, not
least in the Christian symbol known colloquially as the
"Jesus Fish." For Daley, the almost alchemical transfor-

mation of two circles into a single vesica is at the root of
why the vesica is often seen as a sacred symbol. "There's
a whole field of sacred geometry," Daley said, describing
similar transformations of inscribing stars within pentagons, for instance. "Each one of the forms makes
another form inside itself."
Still, Daley's works aren't merely a dry study of
ancient symbolism, but a meditation on connections
between the past and future, as well as on the natural
and mystical. "I came to be interested in it when I found
out about it as a form historically

use of the material and the level of nuance and subtle

is filled with variations."
To complement the pottery, Daley also has several
drawings of his works on display. Each drawing shows
multiple overlapping variations of a pot, making the pot
look as though it were a wild overgrown plant. Daley
explained, "I drawall the time. I draw things that I think
about, but that doesn't mean I can make them. I can't
make them until they're in the material." The pots
rarely look anything like the original drawing.
"He lets the pot suggest the next move," Packard
said. "In other words, it's a dance between a preconceived idea of the form and a response to the form as it
evolves It's not like he comes up with a drawing and
just illustrates it."
. "When I'm working with [the material] I'm hot trying to solve a problem," Daley said. "I'm trying to find

developed such essential skills as cooking or efficiently packing a suitcase.
For a long while, I tried to placate myself with the
thought that these are common concerns amongst
Swarthmore students. We are all, I told myself,
afraid of leaving the bubble of 500 College Avenue,
because the bubble is so damn comfortable. But last
semester, as summer drew closer and I started talking to friends about their plans, I came to realize
that I was dead wrong. Everyone, it seemed, was
>^

going to be staking out on their own, and no one
seemed all that worried. As one friend (who shall
remain nameless) told me about her goal to spend as
much of her Lang Center grant money as possible on

alcohol and subsist on rice and beans in DC all summer, all I could think was: Jesus Christ, I don't even
know how to cook beans. I am so fucked.
Which is why the concept of leaving the country
for a year and living without a meal plan, an iPhone,
or free coffee at 10:00 pm in the library was completely appalling to me. But, after a few weeks of
anxious researching, I found out that there's a
Starbucks right down the road from Wadham College
in Oxford, that I can use my iPhone in England, and
that I should look at the various other day-to-day
struggles of living on my own as an opportunity to
become very slightly less helpless, rather than as a
death sentence.
Which is how I came onto the rather unlikely title
of this column, "Chautauqua". A chautauqua, I
learned while reading "Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance" in 11th grade, is a semispiritual artsy-fartsy new age "adult education"
quest that people with too much time or not enough
employment can undertake to try to find themselves,
or some bullshit like that. (It's also a budget airline
that I think has only one route
between
Indianapolis and the Burning Man Festival. But
that's beside the point.)
While I'm still not clear on what finding one's self
actually entails, I figure that studying abroad will,
by necessity, become my personal quest for selfimprovement. After being dumped into the wilds of
Oxford, England and left to my own devices for a
year, I will return to Swarthmore as a Changed Man.

But first I need to not starve, which brings me
back around to the actual subject of this week's column: cooking.
M
When I expressed to my mother my fears about
being unable to cook, she nodded and promised to
teach me how to prepare some simple meals. Two
months and zero meals cooked later, my mother left
to go on a two-week vacation to Costa Rica. One
week after that, the food she left for me ran out,
prompting me to bite the bullet and prepare my first
meal flying solo.
I read somewhere that cooking is the act of transforming the sum of a number of ingredients into
more than just their combination. My first meal
a salad prepared with the limited ingredients that
were left after a week of not buying groceries
failed colossally in this regard. It tasted exactly like
its constituent parts: a pile of wilted spring mix, half
a clumsily sliced avocado, and a vinaigrette with too
much vinegar. Washing the remains of my salad
into the garbage disposal, I don't know what was
stronger: my urge to order take-out and eat like a
human being, or my shame at having failed at even
the easiest conceivable culinary task.
My second attempt at cooking on my own
roastwas slightly less catastrophic. And,
ed vegetables
a few days later, my family returned from their
sojourn to Costa Rica, relieving me of the need to be
responsible for my own sustenance. But, having
experienced first-hand the misery that comes with
being an incompetent cook, my worries re: England
were far from assuaged. And while I've been promised cooking lessons by my mother and an arsenal of
foolproof recipes by my sister, I suspect that until
I'm actually thrown headfirst into the experience of
living in another country and cooking for myself, I
won't have the faintest idea what to do.
Because if necessity is the mother of learning how
to do just about anything, there's another month to
go before I actually get around to learning how to
cook. When that happens, I'll keep you posted on the
results. Until then, I'm going to do my best not to
panic, and also be just a little more thankful for
Sharpies. You really don't know a not-so-terrible
thing until it's gone.

Panel highlights work of celebrated theater alum
participants

BY IVANA NG

ingl@swarthmore.edu

Since graduating from Swarthmore with a double

major in theater and political science, Michael Zadara '99

received numerous accolades for his professional productions in theater. "Zadara is one of more than a half-dozen
successful professional directors that have come out of the
college since 1990," theater department chair Allen
Kuharski said. "He works in ways very distinct from
other [alumni]." Louis Jargow 'lO, an honors theater
major, described Zadara as "a very philosophical director
[whose aesthetic] incorporates an tepic' or bold acting
style."

Gombrowicz, Witold
include Rita
Gombrowicz's widow and literary executor; Thomas
Sellar, editor of THEATER magazine; and finally
Kuharski, as moderator.
The panel will introduce the work of Witold
Gombrowicz (1904-1969), author of "Operetta" and one of
the foremost figures in Polish theater. Kuharski said that
it will also discuss how Zadara's career has "developed
since his first studies of theater and directing at
Swarthmore, and how his work is representative of larger
movements in contemporary world theater."
The panel will also coincide with the debut of Zadara's
2009 production of "Operetta" at the Philadelphia Live
Arts Festival. "This production will be the largest ever
in the 13 year history of the [festival]," Kuharski said. A
group of students and faculty from the Theater department will attend the premiere of "Operetta" on Thursday,
Sept. 10. "[lt] is one ofZadara's most delightful and popular productions," Jargow said. "It is both funny and totally entertaining, and full ofrich political undertones."
For Kuharski, the play is especially resonant in light of
the current economic situation. "The play is about two
failed revolutions. The beginning of the play is set in conthe play is 40 years old, but
temporary late capitalism
these themes appear very much alive again," he said. This
relationship between theatrical productions and political
discourse is especially a key topic in the panel on Monday.
Besides leading the panel discussion, Zadara will conduct acting workshops on Sept. 12 and 13 with Barbara
...

In addition to his professional and artistic success,
Zadara has also worked closely with Swarthmore students
in the theater department's semester abroad in Poland
program. Jargow himself studied there last fall and
worked closely with Zadara, who is an up-and-coming
Polish director. Jargow is one of the four Swarthmore students with whom Zadara has worked thus far. "Starting in
2004, when Zadara was still in drama school, he made himself available to Swarthmore students in Poland,"

Kuharski said.
To reach out to Swatties on campus also interested in
theater, Zadara will be returning to his alma mater on
Monday, Sept. 7, to participate in a panel discussion sponsored by the theater department and the William J.
Cooper Foundation. Kuharski hopes that the panel will
increase "awareness of the breadth ofartistic accomplishment of Swarthmore's theater department alumni." Panel

Zadara's "Operetta" swings high at Philly Fringe 'O9

Philly Fringe shines spotlight on Tri-Co students
BY ANNE COLEMAN

acolemal@swarthmore.edu

The Philadelphia Live Arts Festival
and Philly Fringe was a five-day event
organized in 1997 to meet the demands of
the expanding experimental arts scene in
the region. Spanning 16 days and with 204
productions currently scheduled, this
year's event remains as fresh and innovative as it was at its inception, as evidenced
by the number of new artists expected to
perform.
For Swarthmore students and grads
alike, the Philly Fringe provides an ideal
setting to generate interest in their artistic
endeavors. Pig Iron Theatre Company,
founded and for the most part run by
Swarthmore alumnae, performed in the
very first festival. Pig Iron's production
this year, "Welcome to Yuba City," directed

by

Swarthmore's

Visiting

Associate

Professor Quinn Bauriedel '94, is one of the

most eagerly anticipated offerings at the

festival.

For the five members of the class of 'O9
who make up the newly formed Matchbox
Theater Company (along with current student Emma Ferguson 10), Sept. 4 will be
the group's first public appearance as an
ensemble. The Matchbox Theater
Company will be staging "Preparations for
Departure" in the Philly Fringe this year.
The same team that brought Swarthmore
"Macbeth" last Spring in Crumhenge,
Matchbox promises "euphoria, bike
wheels, music for dancing, silence, an
adventure (and) bodies," among other
things, to anyone who cares to join them at
233 North Bread Street from Sept. 4 to the
8.
Also stepping into the spotlight this fall
is the sketch comedy group This Thing of
Ours. Composed of Boy Meets Tractor
alums Jesse Gottschalk, Alex Friedman,
and Fletcher Wortmann (all members of
the class of 'O9), as well as current members Marina Tempelsman 10 and Nicco
Morretti 10, This Thing of Ours will be
presenting a series of vignettes titled

"Where Do We Go From Here?" about "the
uncertainty handed to us alongside our
diplomas." Still almost as unsure of their
futures as its characters promise to be, the
team will perform the show four times
(two performances on Sept. 4 and two on
Sept. 5).

Their undertakings are an ideal example of the real beauty of the Philly Fringe,
the opportunity to take a risk and have
your voice heard by the public. Without
the Philly Fringe in our figurative backyard, these ensembles would have gone
their separate ways, but for just a few days,
it provides us with a glimpse of the sheer
quantity of talent out there.
The Festival also provides aspiring
actors and artists with a wider range of
audition and performance opportunities
than are usually available. Emily Letts, HC
1L plays Anita Prowler in New Paradise
Laboratories' Live Arts Festival offering,
"FATEBOOK: Avoiding Catastrophe One
Party at a Time." A highly experimental
combination of online and live perform-

ance, "FATEBOOK" has been gathering a
lot ofpress attention and has even made its
presence felt on several social networking
sites. For Letts and the other Tri-Co students who have the chance to perform with
already established companies in the Live
Arts Festival, these two weeks represent a
chance to get their foot in the door with a
wide range of regional theaters.
The more time you spend looking for
connections to Swarthmore, the more surprising the results. Michael Zadara, the
man behind the appearance of Teatr
Muzyczny Capitol in Wroclaw, Poland, in
the festival, is a member of the class of '99,
and the Philly-based director Adrienne
Mackey, collaborating on a piece titled
"Purr, Pull, Reign: A Litigious Fantasy in
D," is an 'O4 graduate. For those who are
interested in the Philadelphia arts scene or
just want to do something different, check
out the festival website (www.liveartsyou'll be surfringe.org) or ask around
prised by how many people are linked in to
the theater scene.

ITS responds impressively to budget cuts
In tough economic times, the decision to remove public dorm computers confirms our faith in Swarthmore's ITS staff
As the Swarthmore College
community starts yet another
new school year, the global
recession is still very much a
sobering reality. One of its latest effects on campus has
appeared in the form of a
reduction in dorm computers.
Even between the twin hassles
of moving in and starting
class, returning students have
been quick to notice that,
regardless of size, dorms now
house only one public computer each, with the exception of
Mary Lyon and Parrish Hall.
Although many realize that
every department must make
significant budget cuts in this
economy,
and
that
Technology
Information
Service is no exception, there
are still mild rumblings about
the inconvenience of these disappearing acts. Recession or
not, some question whether
the cuts need to affect students
so directly, as the removal of
dorm computers unfortunately has.
Before plunging into the
potential

complaints against

ITS's decision, though, consider some facts. Gayle Barton,
the
Chief
Information
Technology Officer, said that
ITS received a mandate from
administration to cut $120,000
in this fiscal year, which
began on July 1. The most efficient way of achieving that
goal was to reduce operating
costs by removing a number of
public computers from the
dorms.
"Since most people have
laptops, it makes the [removing of dorm computers] less of
a burden on students," Barton
said. Cuts were also made in
the areas of travel expenses
for ITS staff to technology conferences and other similar
events. "We have also moved
from a three-year replacement
plan to a four-year replacement plan for computers
across campus," Barton said.
"This will save a quarter of
what we would spend [in a

fewer available computers
and, further down the line,
computers that are perhaps
older than is optimal given the
switch to a four-year replace-

ment plan.

Since we are Swarthmore
students, we cannot help but
why should ITS's
wonder
costs be pushed onto we who
already must pay our high
tuition fees? Why does Willets,
with its occupancy of 213 students, have just one computer
in the dorm, a number equal
to Dana and Hallowell and
each of the PPR dorms, all of
which have occupancies of
less than 100?
These are all valid questions. But in our view, ITS has
eminently more valid responses to our concerns. As it turns
out, the people who support all
of Swarthmore's technology
needs do in fact know what
they are doing. According to
ITS Software Specialist Mark
Davis, they have been working
to track campus computer
usage. "We have been using [a
technology called] LabStats
since last year," Davis said.
LabStats has shown that students are largely using the
public dorm computers for
very short periods of time,
which leads to the logical conclusion that the computers are

primarily

used to print
papers. The five-minute sessions on dorm computers are
in stark contrast to, for example, the hours that students
spend on McCabe library computers, according to Davis'
LabStats information.
To address the necessity of
cutting costs while keeping
student inconvenience at a
minimum,

Davis
said,
"we
consider e d

since

the same point in time last
year.

That the decision to reduce
the number of computers in
dorms was not arbitrarily
made is abundantly clear.

Thus, a quick trip to either
venue will show that their resident computers safely remain
where they were in May.
Furthermore, Willets will
soon be home to a PC as well
as a Mac, reflecting ITS' recognition of different dorms'
needs.
These are, after all, hard
times. All across the globe, the
current financial crisis is
making day-to-day life a strug-

even at other small liberal arts
colleges like Williams College,
computers are being completely eliminated from dorms, and
printing is markedly not free

like it is for Swarthmore students.
Consider the many alternatives
that
could
have
occurred: ITS could have easily raised service and repair
costs, or

started charging for printing.
The fact of the matter is that
we are, to use Davis' words,
"far, far better off than [people

We encourage students to

To the Editor:
Soren Larson makes a humorous comparison, but in the process
misses an essential difference between the college environment and
the capitalist system. College is a cooperative experience where professors and students work together to enhance the understanding and
quality of work produced by all. Everyone strives for excellence in
their work, and no one's success comes at the expense ofanother. The
capital markets are a zero-sum game. Financial instruments produce
profit from costs paid by others. Every dollar a trader extracts from

the market was contributed by someone else. In such an environment, brutal, exploitative competition is the rule, and regulation is an
answer to that environment.
Larson does a disservice to our understanding of both markets
and college by confusing the two. Freshmen need to learn that we are
in a cooperative endeavor, not a competitive one, and the sooner they
learn this lesson, the more productive and less painful their time at
Swarthmore will be.

Campus Progress is a project of the

Veterans Bangs and Bond bolster volleyball hopes

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

Entering the 2009 season and
coming off a disappointing 6-19
last
campaign
the
year,
Swarthmore volleyball team
looks to rebound in 2009 and con-

tend for a Centennial Conference

playoff birth.

coach Harleigh
Chwastyk begins her eighth season at the helm of the program,
expectations are higher than they
have been in several years. In the
58th season in program history,
the Garnet will look to match the
successes of the early 2000s.
Under Chwastyk, Swarthmore
has won two tournament titles
and appeared in the 2005

onships.

Even though the Garnet will
be without Jen Wang 'O9, the alltime kills leader at Swarthmore
(with U7l), the young team looks
to be in a position to contend,
combining star veterans Kierney
Bangs 'lO and Johanna Bond 'lO
with a strong group of first-years.
"We only have two seniors and
a junior, and eight underclassmen...The sophomores and fresh-

men are very talented and come
in with a lot of volleyball skills
and experience," Chwastyk said.
"This is one of the first years I've
had where there are at least two
people challenging for every spot
on the floor."
Sarah Lambert 'll and her
teammates believe that the team
has the talent and chemistry to
overcome the loss of Wang and
fellow graduate Erin Heaney.

"It was their time to graduate
and move on. There is no need to
dwell on the contributions that
they made. We have to work on
what we have now, and what we
have now is great," Lambert said.
As the 2009 season begins,
Haverford College is the runaway
favorite to repeat as Centennial
Conference champions. Ranked
24th in the National Division in
poll conducted by the American
Volleyball Coaches Association,
the Fords appear ready to run
through
the
Centennial
Conference, though Gettysburg,
2008 Centennial Conference runner-up, and Johns Hopkins, predicted to finish third in the conference this year, will remain tough
contenders. Swarthmore is picked
to finish ninth in the 11-team
Centennial Conference field.
In the annual preseason
Spikefest hosted last weekend in
the Tarble Pavilion, Swarthmore
did battle with Johns Hopkins,
Eastern, Gwynedd Mercy and
Neumann. The teamwork and
communication continued to
improve throughout the day. "We
have four new freshmen, [including] two who will be starting,"
Chwastyk said.
"The first three weeks of our
season are non-conference play,
which is scheduled intentionally
so that we can prepare for conference, so I think the biggest thing is
building team chemistry and
trust," Chwastyk said.
In the Spikefest, Swarthmore
was able to split sets against Johns
Hopkins and take a set against
Eastern, a team with two AilAmericans on its roster. And on

Tuesday, the Garnet stole an early
set in an out-of-conference match
against Moravian before losing the
contest by a score of 3-L
The Garnet will need to find
help up front in the form of a hitter
alongside Genny Pezzola 'l2.
Pezzola, second on the team in kills
last year (304 behind Wang's 360),

was also one of the team's best
defenders last year, leading the
way with 402 digs
over four per
set. She also was the team leader
in blocks. Bangs, who averaged
over seven assists per game, and
Hillary Santana 'l2 will both be
key parts for the Swarthmore
squad as well.
Adding a new dimension to the
Garnet in 2009 is Kat Montemurro
'l3, the starting middle front. The
team did not have a true middle
last year, and Montemurro is in a
position to make major contributions at that spot.
Swarthmore opens Centennial
Conference play at Tri-Co rival
Bryn Mawr on Sept. 4 and will play
on the road in November against
the top two conference teams,
Gettysburg.
Haverford
and
Centennial Conference home
matches to be played this season
include contests against Johns
Hopkins, Franklin & Marshall and
Dickinson.
Lambert and her teammates
are confident that they can compete in the conference. "We can
definitely finish higher than
[ninth]. In our scrimmage this
past weekend we finished overtop
of Bryn Mawr and split sets with
Johns Hopkins both Conference
teams. Our goal is to finish topfive."

Being a senior means I'm excited to take
advantage of things I have neglected for
the past three years both here at
Swarthmore and in the sports world in
general. Some of you may remember my
columns from last year profiling various
sports that I was becoming involved in,
and my first new experience of the year
takes the form of Fantasy Football.
I would consider myself a pretty diligent football fan for the past several
years, yet for some reason, I had never
engaged myself in the world of Fantasy
Football. For some reason, whenever
someone asked me to join their Fantasy
league, I always declined on the basis that
there was too much difference between

tive players in The League to be worth my
while following it all. However, this year,
a good friend of mine (and a Swarthmore
alum) convinced me that maybe I should
take the plunge to Fantasy Football. To set
the record straight, I've never really been
a great game predictor as illustrated by
my debacles in March Madness brackets,
so naturally I was a little tentative to join.
My Achilles' heel of the sports world is
that I often attach myself to players and
teams that I like to the point that I eschew
fundamentally sound predictions in favor
of those teams and players that I like.
When the time for my pre-assigned
Fantasy draft came, I parked myself in
front of my computer and, in real time
with the other ten members of the league,
began to draft players.
Again, since I don't consider myself a
real Fantasy Football aficionado, I didn't
really look at any major sports outlets
about who the top Fantasy players were.
Instead, I fell into my trap of drafting
guys I was partial toward.
Interestingly enough, I feel as though I
may have actually made some pretty solid
choices. Clearly everyone gets a few studs
right out of the gate, so I used my first two
picks to take LaDanian Tomlinson and, of
course, Tom Brady.
Even though both picks could be considered relatively risky (let's remember
Brady missed all of last season, and LT
has been down the past two seasons or
so), I felt that the marginal benefit of their

having great seasons much outweighed
the potential bust.
This was the point, in which I started to
really get into the draft. I started to make
guys who were
some educated picks
poised for big seasons (Ray Rice and
Darren McFadden) and guys who could
potentially fill big voids (Roy E. Williams,
Jason Whitten and Domenik Hixon).
Without a doubt, I had to take fellow
Needham High School Lacrosse alum
Steve Haushcka (a kicker for the
Baltimore Ravens). Adding guys who
could explode big if they really hit their
strides (DeSean Jackson, Devin Hester
and Lee Evens) gave me the confidence
-

that, when all was said and done after the
draft, I may actually have a powerhouse
team. Of course, with only nine other
teams in my league, it appears that everyone has a pretty stacked lineup, but being
the optimistic Fantasy rookie, I unsurprisingly thought that my team is ready
to take anyone on.
After the draft was finished, and I was
nosing around the protocols of the league,
my heart dropped. The Yahoo! Sports
interface peppers each team owner with
news updates of how the players from
their teams are faring and recommendations about whom to play. I instantly realized that I was in much too far over my
head. Certainly my league-mates would
have played Fantasy Football before and
know to check all sorts of factors each
week (opponents, injuries, etc.) to deter-

mine the best starting lineup to demolish
me with. How does anyone, especially
alumni with regular 9-5 jobs, have the
time to inform themselves with the rapidly changing world of Fantasy sports of the
best way to approach each week? Thank
God I at least chose to get involved with
Fantasy Football since I like to think I
know much more about the NFL than,
say, the MLB.
Let's be at least a little bit honest for a
moment. At the end of the day, how much
does skill really factor in while picking
players in Fantasy Football? I think that
luck has a lot more to do with who ends
up winning than does skill. For example,
coming into last season, the owner who
had drafted Tom Brady probably thought
he was going to do a lot of damage. Yet, as
history dictated, Brady blew out his knee
in the first game and missed the entire
year. In reality, Fantasy Football seems to
be more of a guessing game than anything
else: guessing who will have big years,
gambling on who won't be injured, hoping that players on your team explode for
big games on a weekly basis. At this
point, all I can do is sit and wait and hope
that when the NFL season starts soon, I
made some good decisions that draft
night. I hope Fantasy Football won't take
over my life too much, and none of you
will see me frantically checking updates
each Sunday.

AROUND COLLEGIATE SPORTS JOURNAUSM

Amicable mascots soften collegiate athletic programs

KANSAN.COM, AUG. 31 2009

The Kansas Jay hawk is too nice.
Seriously. Look at him (her?). Tell me
he's (she's?) not going to wink at me any
second now. And winking in sports (and
in general really) is rarely as effective as
Moonlight Graham would lead you to
believe in "Field of Dreams." (If you
haven't seen it, rent it, watch it and thank
me later.)
But aside- from my personal beliefs
about winking and my fondness for 'Bos

explanation.
The University of Kansas is a school
that prides itself on tradition. Just watch

Evaluating the contributions of student-athletes
BY LAURA KUBITZ, KYLE
MAISTRI AND MIKE MCCALL

ALLiGATOR.COM, AUG. 25, 2009

Editor's Note: This is the first

of a

four-part alligator Sports

series in which we examine
whether college athletes deserve to
be paid for their athletic efforts.
When Tim Tebow left Ponte
Vedra Nease High School for the
University of Florida, his coach
kept his helmet.
Craig Howard didn't want it
as a memento to remind him of
the quarterback he helped mold
into an eventual Heisman
Trophy winner, and he wasn't
looking to make a quick buck by
selling it.
Howard stowed it away at
Nease for the opposite reason: to
keep someone else from selling
it.
That's also why Howard
who now coaches at Lake City
Columbia High
didn't sell jerseys bearing Tebow's No. 5, a
venture that surely would have
raised lots of money for the
Panthers' program.
"I thought about it, but I
thought it would be too much
commercialism," Howard said.
"We could have made money off
of it, but guys like that come
along only a few times.
"I was always very protective
of Timmy's stuff."
Though Howard has certainly
gained from coaching Tebow
he wona state title and coached a
game televised on ESPN
he is
one of the few people who hasn't
taken advantage of a chance to
make money off him.
Sometime between an athlete's final prep contest and his
arrival on a college campus, that
line is broken. From one amateur,
student-athlete-driven
sports association to another, it
becomes commonplace for people to make large profits off of
players.

And
since arriving in
Gainesville, Tebow has become a
cash cow.
The UF Bookstore, located on
campus, sold around 2,000 of

THE PHOENIX

Tebow's No. 15 jerseys last year.
That's a rate of 166 per month,

ranging in price from $75 to $l5O.
A search on eßay.com for
"Tim Tebow" nets 393 results,
ranging from 99-cent football
cards to an autographed jersey
up for $51515.
At The Perfect Gift, a shop
located in Haile Village, a painting titled "Lord of The Swamp"
that featured Tebow running
through the Oklahoma defense
with Bible verses placed all over

him was on the market for
$6,500. At the Haile Village Art
Fair outside the store last
spring, more paintings, sketches and even jewelry bearing
Tebow's likeness or jersey number were for sale.
His image has sold maga-

zines, newspapers, highlight
videos and T-shirts. His play on
the field has sold tickets and
earned UF millions for playing in
high-profile bowl games.
And as Howard points out, a
10-year-old
family
Tebow
Christmas card went for $5O
online last fall.
"It's
almost disgusting,"
Howard said. "So many people
make money off of athletes and
off ofsports, and a lot of times the
athletes don't get any financial
reward from it."
Due to NCAA rules, Tebow is
prevented from benefiting financially as a result of his status as
an athlete. He even has to jump
through hoops just to do charity
work.
In the week leading up to UF's
spring football game, Tebow participated in charity events that
raised around $300,000 for the
children's hospital at Shands at
UF and an orphanage in the
Philippines.

Tebow was only allowed to
help after months of dialogue
with the NCAA to ensure that
Tebow, his family and his
father's ministry, the Bob Tebow
Evangelistic Association, would
not benefit.
"I don't really care about getting paid, but sometimes I do
wish I could do more charity

work and help out with stufflike
that," Tebow said.
It seems everyone is making
money off Tim Tebow except for
Tim Tebow, but some believe he
has the ability to change the college system.
After the 2007 Heisman

Trophy presentation, professor

Rick Karcher, who heads the
Center for Law and Sports at the
Florida Coastal School of Law,
sent Tebow a letter congratulating him on the win.
The letter also urged Tebow to
sue the commercial entities profiting from his identity, which
would not cause a loss of eligibility. If Tebow were to be awarded
damages, Karcher wrote, it
would be too late for the NCAA
to punish him.
"But by the time you receive
that judgment, you will have
already exhausted your eligibility," Karcher wrote in the letter,
which he later published on the
Internet. "Your lawsuit could be
the impetus for the NCAA to
begin negotiating with its
licensees for an annual royalty to
be held in trust for the benefit of
collegiate athletes in the future,
without destroying their eligibility."

Karcher's idea was that
Tebow could do for college sports
what Curt Flood did for free
agency in baseball. But the
debate about paying student-athletes is long and twisted, with
legal issues, gender equality, economics and the spirit of amateurism all playing a role.
The Football Machine

Because there is no fair sys-

tem to pay college athletes, and
doing so under current rules
would remove their eligibility,
Tebow and his teammates are
not able to cash in on their work.
According
to
the U.S.
Department of Education, the UF
football program generated more
than $66 million in 2007-08, while

the men's basketball program

brought in $9.9 million. After
expenses, those teams made $47.2

million and $2l million, respecSeptember 3, 2009

tively, while all other UF sports
recorded a net loss of $13.5 million.
It's clear that the gridiron
Gators are the framework holding the athletics program together.
"The ability of our football
program to generate significant
dollars is the key component to
our financial stability," the UAA
stated in its 2008-2009 budget
summary.
The numbers will be much
larger for the 2008 season.
The UAA projected to make
$8.6 million in Southeastern
Conference revenue from bowl
games, television contracts and
championships, $2l million from
advertising and $29.9 million in
donationsfrom boosters.
Also, since Tebow's jersey hit
the shelves, licensing revenues
have almost doubled to a projected $4 million, a number that will
likely be surpassed in the wake
of the Gators' recent national
title.
Those numbers, especially
from the football team, have convinced many that the athletes
doing the work on the field
deserve a cut.
"Honestly, I think we should
get a little something," cornerback Joe Haden said. "When you
look at all the money coming in
for the games and everything,
[the university gets] all the
money. It wouldn't hurt for us to
just get a little something."
Of the Gators' 122 players, 85
are on athletic scholarships,
ranging in value from $12,300 for
in-state students to $29150 for
non-Floridians. The scholarships
cover tuition, housing, a meal
plan and books, and there are
other benefits that come with
being a student-athlete, such as
trainers, tutors and special
advisers to help with scheduling.
"There's a lot of other things
they do for us," wide receiver
David Nelson said. "If there's an
emergency and we have to go
home, they'll pay for our flight.
They do a great job of taking care
of us, and they provide us with

meal plans and housing, so there
really isn't that much else that
we need."
The bases are covered, Haden
said, but in the shadow of coach
Urban Meyer's $4 million-peryear contract and the program's
sky-high revenues and success,
the players should get a little
more.
"We have a meal plan at the
dining hall, and not to be talking
down about it, but it's the same
food all the time, and sometimes
you don't want to go there,"
Haden said. "You might want to
take your girl out to eat or something."
Big-time players are sure to
cash in on their careers eventually. Tebow will likely have
endorsements and a pro contract
waiting for him this spring, and
he took out an insurance policy
to guard against an injury derailing his plans.

But for those without a future
in athletics, earning a degree is

everything.
According to the U.S. Census
Bureau, adults with a college
degree earn four times more
than those with less than a high
school diploma. A high school
dropout, on average, earned
about $20,873 in 2006 while a
person with an advanced col-

earned

about

Those benefits aren't lost on

safety Major Wright, who plans
to use his communications
degree to pursue a broadcasting

career after football. But he still
believes he should be compensated with a stipend.
"The majority of our time as
a student-athlete is either studying or on the field," Wright said.
"I feel like we should be paid
because we're here 24/7. We're
here during the breaks when
other people go home, and even
though our team is like a family,
we can't get to be with our
immediate family much. Taking
that away can push some people
down sometimes."

Women's soccer annuls Crusaders in home opener
BY DANNY FRIEL
dfriell@swarthmore.edu
After keeping pace with a topranked opponent in a scrimmage
Saturday,
on
the Garnet
women's soccer team opened the
2009 campaign with a 2-1 victory

at home on Tuesday against
Alvernia College.

The visitors jumped ahead
early with a header from sophomore Kate Wimberg, but the
Garnet didn't panic.
After a series of shots on goal
in the first half, Julia Luongo 'lO
tied the score just before halftime with the help of an assist by
Hannah Deming 'l2.

The Garnet offense continued
to enjoy almost interrupted control for much of the second half.
Hannah Purkey 'll found classmate Kelsey Cline with a cross in
the 82nd minute to finally break
through the resilient Crusader
defense in what turned out to be

the game-winner.

As is often the case, the score
of Tuesday's match provides little insight into the course of the
game.

Despite dominating offensive
play for the majority of the
evening, the Garnet spent a large
chunk of first half trailing the
visitors.
"We've been in situations like
that before," Cline said of the

frustration of being unable to
convert plentiful opportunities.
"Experience has a lot to do with
it. [Alvernia] put a lot of players
behind the ball, but wcremained
calm and were able to capital-

ize."

Indeed, with so much activity
on the Garnet offense, goalkeeper Marie Mutryn 'l2 was tested
with only three saves in the victory. Mutryn. returned to the
field against Alvernia after suffering a leg injury in a knee-toknee collision in a scrimmage
against #1 Messiah College on
Saturday.

Mutryn's attempts to return
to the net were quelled by the

conservative
tactics
of
Anckaitis, who said that the
team was "not going to risk the
season" by playing an injured
Mutryn during a scrimmage.
With no trained goalies waiting
in the wings, putting Mutryn at
unnecessary risk would have

been a bold decision.
Mutryn returned to the field
healthy on Tuesday, helping the
Garnet to the season-opening
win.
"I was definitely 100 percent
better," Mutryn said. "[My leg
is] still a little bruised and stiff,
but it was really the impact that
hurt the most."
Meanwhile, Mutryn enjoys
first-hand coaching from one of
Swarthmore's finest.
Former
goalkeeper Lauren Walker 'O9,
who was named the Most
Valuable Player in the 2008
Region
ECAC
South
Championship tournament, has
returned to Swarthmore as an
assistant coach, working to
develop Mutryn's skills in goal.
And even with Mutryn on the
bench on Saturday, the Garnet
remained competitive with the

September 3, 2009

standout Falcons despite dropping the scrimmage by a score of
2-0.
It's not a bad loss, considering
that Messiah won the 2008 NCAA
Division 111 Championship Final
against Wheaton by a score of 5-0
and now enters the 2009 season
ranked #1 by the National Soccer

another run at the tournament.
Twenty-five strong, the roster
boasts eight first-years plus one
transfer. And despite the gradua-

very physical and aggressive,

pre-season poll.
The Garnet held its own
against the Falcons, who sent
nine of 11 starters from the 2008

but the new group is very technical," Anckaitis said of his current back line, which boasts
returners Eileen Earl 'lO, Laura

squad to the
Clothier Field scrimmage.
"It was the best team we've
played to date," Anckaitis said of
the Messiah squad. Anckaitis
went on to judge the 2009 schedchampionship

ule for the Garnet to be the most
difficult since he took the helm
five years ago.
The Garnet focuses each year
on competing regularly with topranked teams. Last year, the
Garnet faced six teams that ultimately earned a berth in the

NCAA tournament. They beat
of them, including the
then-top-ranked College of New
three

Jersey.
Yet
the
NCAA
when
announced the list of 61 teams
invited to the national tournament, Swarthmore College was
not among them.
"We felt we should have
shown ourselves [in the NCAA

tournament]," Anckaitis said.
"We've been knocking on the
door for the past couple of

years."
On paper, this year's squad
looks to be prepared to make yet

tion of a stellar defensive crew in

May, there are no holes in the
line-up.
"Alexa [Bensimhon 'o9] and

Cait [Mullarkey 'o9] would be

Bolger 'll and Purkey, whose

technical prowess warranted a
move to outside back from her
old stomping grounds in the outside midfield.
Anckaitis sees a promising
future for the newcomers as
well. He tabbed Isabel Newlin 'l3
in particular, predicting impressive performances once she "gets
comfortable with the speed of the
game [at the collegiate level]."
Still, Anckaitis noted that a
number of the fresh faces have

already made valuable contributions. "They stepped out with
confidence," he said. "They didn't play like freshmen."

The Garnet will host the
Swarthmore Classic tournament
this weekend. Swarthmore will
take on Baptist Bible
on
Saturday at 2:30 p.m. before facing Albright on Sunday at noon.
The Garnet will face Eastern on
the road on Wednesday at 4 p.m.
