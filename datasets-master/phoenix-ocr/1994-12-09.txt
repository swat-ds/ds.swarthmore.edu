Provost Approves New Journalism Class
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl
A student-run course in journalism will be among enrollment options at registration tomorrow, Provost JennieKeith announced Thursday.
The half-credit class, to be supervised by part-time assistant English
professor Emilie Passow, will cover
both practical journalism skills and
theoreticaltopics such as journalistic
ethics. At the end of the semester,
students will write papers analyzing
materialfrom the class's reading list.
All Swarthmore students, whether
they work on a college publication or
not, are eligible to take the course.
"I'm excited. I'm hoping a lot of
people will take this class and get
something out ofit," said DavidSobel
'95, one of the students who organized the course.
Ben Stern '96, Co-Editor-in-Chief
of The Phoenix, believes that although
the course is neither mandatory for
nor limited to newspaper staff members, it will strengthen the publication."John [Freeman '96, Stern's coeditor] and I found that in the beginning people had various levels of
experience and training. Hopefully,
the class will lessen this."

Keith's decision to approve the
journalism course ends a nearly yearlong debate over compensation for
student writers. Phoenix editors shut
down thepaper for halfof last semester, saying they wanted payment for

their work. Neither Andrew Perrin
'94 nor Jonathan Seitz '96, the Editors-in-Chief at the time who initiated the strike, was available to comment on the new course.
Stem said he, for one, doesn't want
to be paid. "Student Council could
not pay me enough to be the Editorin-ChiefofThePhoenix "he declared.
"The payment idea is ridiculous to
me; there is no way that money can
be a motivation."
While Freeman believes that
"Phoenix editors could benefit from
either [academic] credit or payment,
seeing how itis about a 20 to 25 hour
a week commitment" He worries
that such compensation "would be
unfair to the host of other publications who spend a great deal of time
putting together student writing."
Almost from the beginning of the
strike, though, there were indications
that the College would never pay the
Phoenix staff. Sobel felt that as coEditor-in-Chiefof Perspective magazine, he could help arrange a compromise. Seitz, AdamPreset '96, and
DarinFriess '95, RohitMalhotra '95,
Mike Pan '97, Lyndsley Wilkerson
'97, and Frank Yu '97 of Student
Council together spent 50 hours in
order to produce a series of plans to
give academic creditfor work on The
Phoenix.
"We [originally] wanted the administration to hire a faculty member
who had journalism experience to
teach a journalism course in the En-

glish Department," Sobel said. "But
that wasn't feasible at this time.The
course [that was ultimately established] is not an ideal solution. It's
not exactly what we wanted.My hope
is that we can show the administration that we're serious and that journalism is a real field."
But some members of the College
administration argue that however
"real" journalismmay be, the subject
is too applied to form part of
Swarthmore's permanent academic
program. "It's a pre-professional
course," Registrar Jane Mullins explained. "Swarthmore does not have
an English department, it has an EnglishLiterature department, and that's
a differentball game. A small liberal
arts college cannot do everything,
and it's silly to try to, in my opinion.
I think a Student-run course is the
solution to the problem."
Craig Williamson, chairmanof the
department of English Literature,
emphasized that the course will examine substantive theoretical issues
and is not merely intended to give
academic credit to student writers.
"We see this as a subject worthy of
study in this way. But the situation
are definitely not getting into is
one where students could, semester
after semester, get creditfor the work
they do on The Phoenix" he stated.
Keith noted that her approval of
the course was for one semester only
and that the class would not automatically be offered in future years.

Residence Councils Open New
Horizons for Dormitory Life
By Erik Huneke

As part of an effort to enhance
dormitory life at Swarthmore, current RA's were encouraged during
their training to form Residence
Councils. Although not installed in
all dorms, those Councils have used
Residential Life funds in order to
finance dorm-wide projects and activities.
The Residence Councils program
was initiated with a pilot project in
Willets during the Spring 1994 semester. As conceptualized by Myrt

Westphal, Director of Residential
Life, a Residence Council is a group
ofRA's and other students who organize activities designed to foster better relations among people throughout a dormitory. In Mertz, the Council consists of "all six RA's and one
student from each hall," according to
RA Michele Hacker '95. Westphal
saidthat the Council could also con-

The Holiday Spirit Is Alive and Well at Swarthmore
By Ben Salter
You may have wondered what the small,
decorated Christmas trees that have recently
appeared aroundcampus are for, and whowould
receive the gifts listed on the glitter-covered
paper ornaments. The trees are part of a project
called 'The Gathering and The Giving," an
annual event for the past three years that was
conceived by a group of faculty members who
hope to enhancetheCollege community' s holiday spirit and provide gifts for needy families
and individuals.
The event consists of two distinct parts, run
by separate volunteer committees of faculty
and staff. The Gathering is a holiday party for
the entire College faculty and staff that will
take place in Sharpies. The College provides
beverages for the party, and guests are asked to
bring baked goods. The party is held in the
morning, so as not to conflict withother departmental parties in the afternoon.It is intended to

Cultural Groups Offer Opportunities for
Increased Community Among Students
Swarthmore College is home to
several student-run groupsthatfunction to raise awareness ofother cultures and support students from various cultural backgrounds. The following is an overview of five of
these organizations, and the opportunities they create for social involvement and political action at
Swarthmore.
Hispanic Organization for
Latin American Awareness
HOLA, one of three groups in the
Intercultural Center (located in the
Cloisters of Clothier Hall), "sponsors a variety of programs, activities, and events that contribute to the
understanding of the Hispanic/
Latino experience at Swarthmore
College and beyond," according to
the 1994-1995 Guide toStudentLife.
Currently, group members are reevaluating the specific direction and
purpose of their organization. At
this point, its primary function is to
provide support to Hispanic and
Latino students through its weekly
Monday night meetings. The meetings alternate between business and
support. Members have discussed
opening one meeting a month to all
students regardless of background,
in an attempt to incorporate the
greater Swarthmore community.
HOLA members presently participate in activities ranging from
sleepovers at the I.C. to intramural

soccer on the Latin-Lovers team, to
trips to Philadelphia for cultural immersion.
According to Chris Marin '96, copresident of HOLA with Andrew
Marino '96, the group does not primarily consider itself a political
group, though many of its members
are involved in political action with
other organizations.
The group also hosts weekly Latin
Dancing classes, a Salsa Dinner every semester, a lecture series on issues pertinent to the Latino community, a Spanish table Mondays at lunch
in Sharpies, and a twice-yearly allcampus party, which took place on
Saturday, Dec. 3.
Swarthmore Asian Organization
SAO hosts meetings and activities
for Swarthmore students of Asian
descent. Its goals for this year include unifying Asian-American students on campus, sharing experiences
and building a strong community
within SAO, raising cultural awareness in the Swarthmore community
about issues affecting Asians and
Asian American students, and reaching out to Asian communities offcampus.
The group regularly sponsors pot
lucks, speakers, movies, and workshops, and has hosted an AsianAmerican Awareness Month thepast
two years. According to co-coordinator Debbie l,ee '95, at least onethird of the events and activities
planned for next semester will be

insulator. Everbach describes it as
"like a giant thermos bottle," warm
in the winter, cool in the summer.
The bales used here are packed more
densely than typical ones.
The biggest challenge facing the
project is the dampness of the coming winter. If it gets wet, the straw
willrot, and the structure will weaken.
The tarps are intended to protect
against this. Before it gets cold, an
outer layer of stucco must be applied
to the bales, and the roof must be
attached securely. Until the stucco is
on, the bales are more vulnerable to
fire, though Everbach insists that the
dense bales and the stucco make the
flammability of the House "comparableto that of [structures made with]
conventional building materials."
The project, according toEverbach,
has proceeded more slowly and with
fewer people than originally anticipated. "I had hoped theroof wouldbe
up before Thanksgiving. I'll be happy
if it's up before Valentine's Day,"
Everbach said. Despite his dedica-

tion, the project may fail if the building goes up too slowly and is damaged by the elements.
The House is not intended as a
permanent structure. Larry Schall,
Associate Vice President of Facilities and Services, says the spot "is not
a good site for a permanent home for
this structure." The project has been
given use of the site until August.
Students taking the course are also
concerned with the fate of the house.
Ultimately, the seminar members
would like to analyze the house as a
four-person, low environmental impact home. The Coalition at
Swarthmore, which was established
to enhance a sense of student community, would hope to use the house
as a meeting space for activities. It
would also be a museum of sustainable living with displays on solar
energy and wastewater treatment.
In addition to working on the construction, members of the seminar
are working on specific areas to build
a more realistic living space. Brian
Roche '95, for example, is working

Business meetings are held every

meetings are scheduled weekly for
more informal social interaction
among the 15 or so active members.
Membership numbers about 30 to
40 students.
In response to arecent fire-bombing of a Vietnamese family's house
inPhiladelphia, SAO has organized
students to attend meetings ofPhiladelphia organizations to discuss
potential political action and response.
Women of Color
The fifty or so self-identified
members of Women of Color, including students, faculty, and administrators, attend discussion meetings and business dinners to share
experiences and plan activities in
what the members consider a safe,
supportive environment.
The group also functions as "a
locus for political and social networking,"memberLaura Kozek '97
said, with focus on shared experiences "as ambitious...women of
color in a society where we are the
minority and [still] the ice-breakers' in many fields."
The group sponsors lectures,
movies, and other cultural events,

for composting.
The project was funded by a grant
from the Educational Foundation of
America, as well as funds remaining
from "Swarthmore and the Biosphere," a class taught by Everbach
during the Spring 1993 semester.
Further funding is being sought as
money supplies dwindle. Members
of the group express appreciation for
the four volunteers from outside the
immediateSwarthmoreCollegecommunity, who have participated.
Given the challenges of time and
weather, members of the project may
never see thehouse completed. However, Matt Cohen '95 emphasizes that
while some might see project members as "hopeless idealists," their
work has proven "educationally viable," and the project has already
enabled them "to gather valuable information about sustainable living as
a reality."

they recruit students, they
provide inspiration and advice for
students, and they advise us in the
scheduling. We couldn't do it without them."
In addition to raising funds, students make special contact with the
alumni. "People think it's just asking
for money, but it's much more than
that," says Waki. The phone calls
often provide opportunities for the
students to learn about life after
Swarthmore, and for
alumni to hear College
news directly from someone who's here. This is
especially helpful for
"many of the alumni
[who] have been out 20,
30,40 years, and have no
way of learning what's
going on here besides the
Alumni magazine. The
phonathons give them the
chance to hear about it
from a particular student,”
Wotherspoon said. Alumni give advice and share stories about their experiences during and after
Swarthmore. Last fall, one student
was even offered an internship by an
alumnus she called.
“Although we measure it in dollars,” said Doug Hasbrouck, Director of Annual Funds, “the communication is also important, even if we
don’t get thepledge. The alumni like
it. There’s a sense of community
among everyone involved with
Swarthmore, both now and in the
past. Everyone shares this common
experience, and they are often pleased
to talk with the students.”
“I think the phonathons have a bad
rep,” saidWald. Many may thinkthat
asking for money is difficultfor students, and giving it difficult for the
alumni, but this is often not the case.
Although some are unwilling to give,
“many alumni feel very warmly toward the school, andrealize that when
they were here, they benefited from
alumni gifts. They are therefore often willing
to give,” said
Wotherspoon.
In terms of student enjoyment, “a
lot of people make interesting contacts, both good and bad,” said
Klosterman. In general, though, it
proves to be a positive experience.
“There’s something important about
having contact with alumni,” says
Waki; “People think the phonathons
are stressful, but they have a pretty
erators,

Over the course of this semester,
student volunteersparticipated in the
Fall phonathons to solicit donations
for the AnnualFund.The phonathons,
which will continue on a paid basis in
the Spring, raise money that supplements tuition in almost every sector
of Swarthmore's budget.
According to Stella Wotherspoon,
Assistant Director of Annual Funds,
about 97 students,
mostly first-years and
sophomores, volunteeredthis semester. Before the last phonathon
onNovember 14, theFall
fund drive had raised
$77,771, from 984
alumni. The average gift
size was s79.o4.Last
year, volunteersraised a
total of $2,148,777 during fund drives throughout the entire year.
The money raised is essential in
maintaining the College. Because the
cost of educating eachstudent is about
$40,000, Wotherspoon said, and the
fee charged to students for this year
was $24,782, there is a gap that must
be filled from sources other than tuition.The Annual Fund, which comes
primarily from alumni, parents, and
friends of the College, provides the
bulk of this supplement.
The Annual Fund is "an unrestricted, unearmarked pool of
money," according to Wotherspoon.
Most of it goes to financial aid, faculty salaries, library purchases, and
other expenditures. "It's very important," she said, since "it covers everything you can think of in the
normal College budget.
Special projects not supported by
the Annual Fund, like the current
construction work, are instead supported through special gifts solicited
by the Development office. The Annual Fund is also not used for student
activities, which are supported
through the Student Activities Fee
charged to all students. These fees
are not figured into the College budget, but rather go directly to student
council, which distributes the money
to student organizations. Facilities
used by student groups, however, are
supported by Annual Fund dollars.
The two student interns, Ri6 Waki
'95 and Amy Klosterman '97, are
central in the phonathon process, said
Wotherspoon. "They're the idea-gen-

Opinions
From the Newsroom to the Classroom
All most there...stay on target.
These words have sustained us
all semester. Before we all scatter
to various comers of the earth, we
wanted to use our forum to rise
above the daily operations of the
newspaper and look to something
higher; something dare we say enduring?.

Typical Swarthmore students
that we are, we did some research.
While looking throughback issues,
we found the original statement of
purpose for "The Phoenix." Although these words were originally
meant for a beginning (they were
written in one of the first issues of
the newspaper), we thinkthem fitting for our ending. Throughout
the years, the newspaper has remained committed to its original
goal that our colleagues succinctly
described in 1881,"wefondly hope
to see "ThePhoenix" what we wish
it to be—a paper devoted to the

best interests of our college, of our
fellow-students, and an advocate of
truth and independence." This semester we have tried to live up to this
challenge. It is for you to decide
whether we succeeded or failed.
The proposal for a journalismclass
next semester also works toward these
goals, albeit indirectly. Most of administrationattention has been spent
on how a journalism class could start
a trend of pre-prof essionalism in academic departments; although a valid
concern it seems an act of Utopian
naivete to disallow journalism when
we have classes like Accounting that
are quite clearly career directed. With
the above statement in mind, it is a
fallacy to assume thatthisclass would
only be a benefit to a few hard-elbowed nut reporters.

Indeed it reaps benefits to all the

can the paper's staff be committed

The administration ought to make
a lasting commitment to a journalism course, as it has with so many
other experimental courses during
periods of interest A small paper
such as "The Phoenix" has thebenefit of drawing directly from the
community it serves: it is an open
forum. Tentative approval of this

step, but many more must follow if

Brits Threaten Civil Rights, Raves
By Krister Olsson

A few weeks ago, the Queen of

England gave Royal Assent to anumber of the clauses

in Public Order
section of the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Bill. The newly-signed
Act has received little press outside
of the United Kingdom, but it is in
such patent violation of civil rights
that its implications cannot be ignored.
The section of the Act which has
received the most press (including a
couple brief articles in theNew York
Times) is that which takes away the
right to silence. InEngland whatyou
do not say at the time of arrest may
now be used against you in court. If
you do not present a piece of evidence to prove your innocence at the
timeof your arrest, it is possible that
the court may not consider that evidence if presented at alater time.The
justification for this section is that
given enough time, many criminals
have the means to fabricate a defense. This is, of course, a possibility, but now that the bill has become
an act there is a greater possibility
that one who has just been arrested,
and is in a justifiedstate ofemotional
turmoil, may leave out a key piece of
informationfor his defense.
If this violation were not enough,
the Act also makes a deliberate stab
at putting the rave and new age cultures to a swift death. A section of
the Act explicitly states that if police
find a group of people guilty of damaging land or introducing harmful
substances into it, using threatening
insulting words to the owner of
the land, or in possession of six or
more vehicles on that land, regardor

less of whether or not those people
have the landowner's consent, those
people may receive up to three
months in prison, a fine of up to
£lOOO, and mav not trespass on that

land for another three months. In
addition, the police have the right to
seize the guilty party's property and
even dispose of it (i.e., destroy) at the
party's expense. Obviously if a group
is making threats to a landowner, the
landowner probably does not want
the group on his property, and the
police actions may be justified to
some extent. However, it is completely unjustified for the police to
make arrests based on an arbitrary

EP).

number of of vehicles present on a
piece of land if the landowner gives
his consent to those vehicles and
owners being there. In addition, it is
never made explicitly clear whatkind

While these are some of the more
important threats to civil liberties
presented in the Act, there are a large
number of other clauses which take
away what we as Americans believe
to be our fundamental rights. With

during the semester, except

during examination

This week we have an unusual
recipe for you. Follow these instructions and see what you get. Find a
group of college students and convince them that they have more work
to do than anyone else in the world.
Pick a day when you know they will
have lots of work to do, and wake
them up early so they are grumpy.
Have them stand outside in the cold
for a while and then pack them into a
crowded, foul smelling place and incite a free-for-allpushing and shouting match. The winners get to work
their butts off learning about things
thatinterest them, the losers will have
to work their butts off learning about
whatever
the hell is
left.

It's registraat
tion
Swarthmore
College.
There are a
number of reasons why there has just
got to be a better way to register.
First, there is the timing.Many find it
horrifying that there is no reading
period between classes and finals.
Regardless, it is horrifying that on
the first day of the ordinary two day
weekend that we have to prepare for
finals, we have to register for our
classes for next semester. Registration should either be during an actual
reading period if we are going to
have one, ora few weeks earlier when
we are less stressed, or a couple of
days before the beginning of classes
for next semester.
However, the timing of registration wouldn't matter nearly as much
if the event itself wasn't such a harrowing experience. The first problem is that there are many important
decisions made on a first-come, firstserved basis. If you are too late, you
may not be able to get into the one
section of the class that fits into your
schedule. There may only be spots
left in the section with the professor
who is unspeakably bad, or who has
a grudge againstyou. There are countless other registration disasters that
can strike people simply because they

got there a little too late. This is a
large part of what turns registration
into the battle zone that it is.

People wake up early, already quite

stressed out because ofthe approach-

ing finals, and wait outside lest their
carefully crafted schedules be shattered into useless remnants. After
long minutes in the mid-December
chill, the by-now miserable Swatties
have every incentive to rush down
the stairs and careen about like lunatics pushing and shouting to get the
attention of the professors behind the
table. After all, they need to relieve
their stress somehow, and if they
don' t push and shove and scream and
shout, all of the hard time they spent
waiting outside may be wasted.
Registrationneeds to
be designed
so that all of
this waiting
outside and
pushing and
screaming is
unnecessary. Nothing should
be done on a
first-come, first-served basis. This
may require an entirely computerized registration process as is common at many big schools. Ifthis can't
be accomplished, a more comprehensive set of lotteries may be necessary.

In addition, there should be some
rules thatthe departments are required
to follow. First, alllotteries shouldbe
held before registration day, so that
studentsknow when they sign up for
courses on the actual day of registration that they an get into them. Second, departments which are in the
habitof withholding informationfrom
the students as to which professors
are teaching which sections should
not be allowed to do so. This is important information, and there is no
reason why we can't be told.
It is clearly too late for this year's
registration. I considered recommending that everyone just wake up
a little later, walk a little slower once
they get inside Sharpies, and act civilized in line at theregistration tables.
Unfortunately, we allknow that's not
going to happen. Good luck in this

the world moves apace with its unprecedented
marryings, spilled oil on sea's skin and fowl's wing,
butane flame on human flesh,

by chemists, all the sufferings inflicted
on the animal world, a fly's head joined to an additional
one, a human gene closed to swine's
for leaner meat, how we will meet
such intertwinings in the years to come
when I am joined to dust and my daughter's clarinet
mingles with an orchestra beyond my ever hearing,
let us pray for faith in some singularities,
the beauty one daffodil spreads on a stalk,

some unitary goodness of the human spirit
in every one of us that must surely
engender more goodness when made two.

Lindsay Plaid Invades the Campus
When I was little and my mom
had bought me and my sisters some
new clothes, we would immediately
rush home and put on a fashion
show for my dad. My sisters and
myself would stroll down the hall
(our catwalk) and into the kitchen
where my father would be sitting
and reading the newspaper. When
we entered, he would
look up from the
paper, smile at us, turn
a page, and begin
reading again. We
would stand there for
a few minutes, tapping
our feet until one of
us got fed up and
shouted, "Dad! What
do you think of our
!"
new
He
would then look up at
us as if seeing us for
the first time and say,
"Oh, so you got a new
! You look very
nice! But will it keep you warm?"
It didn't matter that we live in
Texas where scraping the frost off
the windshield of your car is a perfectly acceptable reason to cancel
school. It didn't matter that the new
article of clothing was, say, a pink
sequined evening gown designed to
attract pre-pubescent boys at the sth
grade dance, and not merely to keep
me well-insulated.
You see, fashion has specific and
limited purposes in the eyes of my
father: thermal regulation. No matter the clothes, no matter the situation, he always asks the same thing:
"But will it keep you warm?"
So after years and years of participating in this ritual, it is not surprising that my father's attitudes on
clothing have wormed their way

into my fashion philosophy.
Although I'm not quite as radical as
dear old dad, I don't think you could
really say that my days are consumed by my quest for high fashion,
either. Seconds are more like it. I'd
say thirty-two or thirty-three seconds a day of my life are consumed
by fashion...and most of thatis spent
finding two matching
socks.
So, now that
know

topic that pervades
my every waking

observation I have
made concerning the
latest Swat fashion
trend even more significant. Of course,
you know what I'm
talking about, right? I
mean, you can't have missed it.
C'mon, you know. The flannel
shirt. No, I don't mean any old flannel shirt. I mean THE flannel shirt.
You know the one. Everyone has it.
It's red and green. It's plaid. It's
flannel.
After exhaustive and extensive
research (namely, snatching at the
collar of my roommate and reading
the label inside her flannel shirt) I
have determined the origins of this
shirt. Carbon dating and DNA
analysis have shown that the shirt
dates back to the Christmas Catalog
season of the L.L. Bean dynasty
during the latter half of the 20th century. Interpretations of ancient
scratchings in one of these catalogs
of antiquity indicate the natives of

Maine on maps found from this period) where the shirt was manufactured called that particular design
woven into the fabric of the garment
"Lindsay plaid." One can only
hypothesize as to the meaning of this
obscure labeling.
But really folks, the prevalence of
this one particular shirt on campus
truly perplexes me. Don't get me
wrong, it's a very nice shirt But
there is a lot of very nice stuff in the
L.L. Bean catalog. The Gore-Tex
Scottish Tweed Rain Hats in either
brown or gray, for example, are
quite lovely, but I haven't seen even
one Swattie running around with one
on their heads.
So the only explanation I can reasonably accept to rationalize the proliferation of Lindsay plaid L.L. Bean
flannel shirts is that the whole thing
is part of some kind of alien subterfuge movement to take over the
world. The people you see wearing
these shirts are not people at all.
They are, in fact, alien creatures
from outer space whose humanoid
disguises are so authentic that even
they can not identify their own
brethren from actual humans. Their
only means of recognizing each
other is by wearing this plaid shirt.
Of course, some real human
beings did end up buying the
Lindsay plaid flannel shirt too. The
only true way to tell if you are dealing with one of these aliens or not is
to unbutton their flannel shirts and
check to see if they have belly buttons.

The aliens' one flaw, you see, is
they don't have belly buttons.
Now I know that its not always
easy to get in a position in which you
can do a quick navel check, but it
obviously must be done. After all, if
the individual puts up that much of a
fight while you're try to undress
them, you've got to wonder what
they're hiding.

But be sure to rebutton their shirts
after you've performed your examination. Even aliens need to be warm.

Halloween. As you
might imagine, there is
an abundance of vampires, witches, and
assorted creepy-crawlies—all of which
look just slightly different than you might
expect As the film begins, it's
Halloween, and things are going just as
horribly as they ever have (that's good).
Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, plucking off heads and throwing
spiders at each other, but two of
Halloween Town's inhabitants aren't
having such a great time. Jack
Skellington, aka the Pumpkin King, is the

architect of each year's Halloween festivities, the master of fright, and yet he's Just
Not Happy. He needs a change, you
know. Joining him in his misery is Sally,

under-conceived female characters in
Tim Burton films. Stitched together from
old doll parts, she's sort of a Cabbage
PatchBride ofFrankenstein.
Eventually, Jack finds his way into
ChristmasTown. Smitten with the possibilities offered by this new holiday, he
arranges a hostile takeover. Santa is kidnapped, and Jack decides to do Christmas
his way, which means that people get
shrunken heads instead of fire trucks, car-

nivorous snakes instead ofrocking horses. Of course, Santa is freed and everything is all right in the end; holiday cheer
wins again.
In the interim, Sally gets to say things
like "You really shouldn't do that," and
"Look out, Jade!"and Jack sings a seemingly endless number of suspiciously
similar songs about how unhappy he is.
Although Nightmare is visually interesting, the voicing of die main characters is
uniformly dull, manifesting none of the

Nightmare lacks the directorial intelligence needed to pull the whole thing
together and make it coherent, and so it
occasionally comes off as gimmicky.

Swat Swimming Dominates F&M in Conference Meet
By Matt Cohen

The most recent meet for Swarthmore's
swimmers, which as it began promised to be a
close one, was against Franklin & Marshall.
After losing last year, the Swarthmore team
was pretty pumped to beat F&M, and that is
exactly what they did.Because of a mini-taper
and some serious psyching up, Swarthmore
not only beat them, they crushed F&M.
The men won 127-78, a margin indicating
the level ofmastery they demonstrated. It started
in the 1000, with Mark Friedberg '9B winning
a race he was slotted to get third in.
The 1000 was Swat's best distance outing of
the year, with times falling dramatically for
Matt Cohen '95 and Julien Lartigue '97. After
the 1000,the team moved on to the200, which
is owned by undefeated Carl Sanders '9B.
Once again, he dominated, with Jaime Raich
'97 and Jason Devlin '9B following in third and
fourth with season best times. The heat finished all together, but when the clockrevealed
the winner, F&M had taken 1-2. The race was
not a loss, though, withKarsten Scherer-Nadal
'95 and Doug McCrath '97 making theCentennial cut.
The 200IM showed off the talents of freshman phenomenon Andy Robbins, who won in
2:07,theconference's best time.Kendrew Witt
'96 swam a season best, swimming a startlingly fast 50 free at the end of the race. Greg
Hamilton '95 and Lartigue followed with season best. Justin Herring '97 instilled some fear
in the conference competition in the 200 fly
with his 2:03. Devlin toyed with an F&M
swimmerfor 150before devastating him in the
last 50. The race also saw the initiation ofMatt

Lillvis '9B to the eight-lap-hell they call the 200
fly. His performance was admirable, coming
close to the conference qualifying cut.
The 200 back was the best race of the day.
The F&M swimmer hung with Robbins the
entire way, pushing him to an astounding 2:04.
The last 25 yards had Robbins show the guts
that make him a Swat swimmer. Hamilton
dropped 3 seconds offhis previous best for the
season, and generally looked smooth. The 500
free was again a forumfor MarkFriedberg '9B,
who blew away the F&M rivals with a 5:08.
Once again. Swat distance free was a force to be
reckoned with. In the breaststroke, captain Ben
Lyons '95 dropped 6 seconds to a 2:24. Unfortunately, he was in the wake of the current
fastest breaststroker in the conference. The
conference champion in the event, Kendrew
Witt '96, lagged behind, stinging from knee
problems and a general lack of dual meet season beasdiness. The 400 free relay was domi-

nated by Swat, winning in a speedy time of
3:25.
It was a fitting conclusion to a meet swum
fabulously by all. The number of season best
times, and the scope of the carnage after the
battle, will be sending some warning messages
to the conference rivals that Swat is ready to
bust out.
The women swam a fantastic meet against
an F&M team that was not worthy of being in
the same pool. The 1000 saw senior captain,
Khris Schaffher, going head to head with the
fastest woman in the thousand this year. She
hung in there for 700 yards and finished with a
season besttime.The 200 free saw Alice Unger
'9B repeat her winning ways, followed by Kris
Robertson '9B in second.
The 50 free was won by departing Liz
Hallworth '96 with a staggering time of 26.3.
Losing Hallworth to the charms of Australia
will hurt the women. Also leaving are Anne
Byrd '96 who turned in speedy performances
in theIM and the 100 breast, and JessicaKeith

'96. Keith has held down the distance swimming fort in the absence of JenLyders '96, who
is away for the year. However, on the roster
next semester will be sorely missed butterflier
Maria Kaufman '96, Sarah Werneck '96, and
Marcie Pullman '96.
After the 50, in which Fulkerson took second, it was onto the IM, whereSchaffner turned
in a superbperformance. She touchedtheF&M
woman out at the end, showing that senior
experience counts when the finish is at hand.
In the 100 free, Hallworthonce again showed
thepowerful last 25 that has become her trademark. Coming from a body length down, she
powered in to take Ist In the 200 back, Tricia
Duncan '95, returned from a two year sabbatical and showed her awesome backstroke to the
competition. Unfortunately, those in the water
missed the show because she motored to a
substantial lead that she never relinquished.
The S watwomen dominated thatrace like none
other, going 1-2-3 on the strong legs of Hanan
Hussein '97 and Amber Halsey '9B, who dug
deep for a decisivefinal fifty. The 500 free was
dominatedby Marino, and saw the initiation of
Unger to the event
The 100breast was apreview of what will be
a tight rivalry at Centennial Championships.
Fulkerson looked tough in the water, but still
succumbed to an F&M woman. The final relay
was a blur, with the Swat women already far
ahead.
This win took theirrecord to an impressive
6-1, whilethe men improved to 4-2. Next up for
the team is theFlorida training trip, where the
coaching staff attempts to make a pleasant
holiday area into a scene from Hell Raiser 111

In a seesaw battle, the Swarthmore Garnet
defeated the archrival Haverford Fords 77-66
in one of the most emotional games of the year.
Last year the teams split their two games, each
winning close games on theroad. On Wednesday night, neitherteam held a lead of more than
six points until the Garnet pulled away with
justover two minutes remaining. The win was
the Garnet's second in the Centennial Conference and kept the Fords winless and in the
division cellar with an 0-7 record.
Coming off of a disappointing weekend in
St. Louis, Missouri at the Lopata Classic, the
Garnet regrouped nicely from losses to Washington University and Colorado College. The
Garnet starting lineup saw significant changes.
Colin Convey'97, MarkPletcher '96, and Sam
Voolich '96 earnedtheir first starts of the year,
and each responded with strong performances.
Forwards Kirk Daulerio '95 and Ben Schall
'97 retained their starting positions.
"I felt that some of our guys had their confidence shaken by [the losses in the Lopata
Classic]," said Coach Lee Wimberly. "Colin
and Sam had played consistently well through
the first seven games off the bench... I think
Colinhas been very solid and mentally tough.
He's been playing with a lot of confidence."
The Garnet kept the Fords off-balance with
an attack thatfeatured five players who scored
in double figures. Convey led with 17 points
and four assists. He scored two baskets in the
waning minutes of the first half that helped the
Garnetpull within two at half-time, 34-32. He
opened the scoring in the second half on a
beautiful drive downthe lane to tie the game at
34. Later, with just over five minutes remaining, hehit a three-pointer which pulled Swat to
within one, 59-58. Schall was then fouled and
tied the game at 59-59 by hitting one ofhis two
free-throws. Convey led the Garnet upcourt
and again drove down the lane, dishing off a
beautiful pass to Voolichwho gave the Garnet
a 61-59 lead which they would never relinquish.

After Voolich showed off his shooting repertoire on the next possession by sinking a
hook shot, the Fords countered with a runner
down the lane to stay within two. Pletcher was
fouled on the Garnet counterattack and sunk

both free-throws. Then Schall intercepted a
poor Ford pass, drove down the court, and
scored despite being fouled. He hit his freethrow to complete the three point play and give
Swat a 68-61 lead with 2:43 remaining.
The Garnet defense remained tough and

prevented the Fords from scoring on consecutive possessions while burning more than a

minute off the clock. The Garnet hit their freethrows down the stretch and the Fords were
unable to overcome the deficit. The Garnet
effectively shut down theFord's inside attack,
but showed some vulnerability on the outside.
In addition to Convey, starters Pletcher,
Schall, and Voolich, whose strong performances
have boosted the Garnet the last two games,
each scored in double figures. Pletcher led the
Garnet with 18 points, hitting on seven of his
eight shots, and grabbed eight rebounds in the
108-77 loss to Colorado College. Against
Haverford, he added 14 more points and four
rebounds. Schall continued his strong sophomore campaign contributing 15 points, five
rebounds and two steals against Haverford. He
had scored 15points and grabbed five rebounds
against Colorado.
"[Voolich] has workedvery hard from where
he was as a freshman. He's definitely our most
improved player. [His play] has been very
consistent. He really hasn't had a bad game,"
said Coach Wimberly. Voolich scored 15 and
had fiverebounds against Colorado and added
10points, six rebounds, and two blocked shots
against Haverford.
"One of the pluses [of the victory over
Haverford] was how well Craig Rodner ['96]
played coming off the bench," said Coach
Wimberly. Rodner, who started the Garnet's
first seven games at point guard, was the fifth
Garnet player to score in double figures. In
addition to his 10 points, he grabbed three
rebounds, had three steals, and dished out an
assist.
The Haverford game marked the end of the
first third of the season for the Garnet who enter
the holidays with a3-5 record (2-1 conference).
They play next on January 7 in a tournament
hosted by defending Division 111 champions
Lebanon Valley. Then after hosting Moravian,
they travel to Connecticut to take on Division
I's Yale University.
Before the CentennialConference kicks into
high gear near the end of January and through
February, the Garnet look to improve on their
defense. "I think we need to be much more
consistent on defense, the shooting percentages against us are too high," said Coach
Wimberly. After Winter Break, the Garnet's
ranks will swell as two injured players and one
who is studying abroad will return. Forwards
A.J. Shanley '97 and Jeff Greeson '97 should
be recovered from their respective knee and
ACL injuries. Travis Elliott '96 will rejoin the
team after his semester in Australia.

Women's Basketball Jumps
To .500 Record After 3-0 Week
Swarthmore Places Fourth In Seven Sisters'
Tournament and Dominates Haverford 60-50
By Pia Houseal
Women'sBasketball proved what they were
made of in a 3-1 week. They end their fall
semester season with a 4-4 record and a three
game winning streak.
Swat began their week with the Seven Sisters Tournament at
Vassar College in
Poughkeepsie, NY. The
first evening brought a
tough loss to Smith, 4244. Play was back and
forth the entire game
andSwat was unable to
pull ahead at the end.
Tri-captain Nancy
Rosenbaum '96 led the
team in points with 16
while Pia Houseal '97
ledrebounding with 16.
So, Swat was again
faced with a position in
thelosers bracket, or the
non-winners bracket as
the case maybe. All the
teams that had lost in the first round would
compete in this bracket. Ironically, Swat was
set to face Haverford in Saturday's game.
Swat came out strong and Haverford managed tokeep up with theirfast paced gameuntil
the last four minutes of the game. Then the
excitementbegan.
With four minutes left, Swat was down by
ten and they knew it was do or die. Swat began
a fouling frenzy and capitalized upon

for the rest of the half
The final score was 6355, another victory for
Swat. Leslie Hermsdorf
'97 stepped up her play
to help lead the victorious team. Tri-captain
Emily Walker '96 also added some key baskets.
These women returned home with a fourth
place seed in the tournament. This is the first
time in a few years that Swat has actually
pushed their way into the winners bracket by
winning two games. This means that Swat will
also be ranked for next year's tournament,
allowing them for the first time in years not to
face the strongest teams in the first round. In
addition, Rosenbaum was named to the AllTournament team. She is the first Swarthmore

Swarthmore returned to their house to meet
a visiting Haverford team. Although Swat had
beaten the 'Fords just that past weekend, they
were not taking this game lightly. Swat knew
they had not played their best on Saturday and
were determined to do so on Wednesday.
Swat did more than just play their game is
just what these women did. At half the score
read 27-20. But Swat had just begun.
The second half was the fast-paced basketball that Swarthmore knew they could domi-

nate.

With fifteen minutes left, the Garnet

pulled ahead and never looked back. All 12

team members saw playing time and Swat won
60-50. Sophomore roommates, Lisl CochranBond and Houseal led the team with 12 and 15

points, respectively.
"We were pretty psyched after beating them
[Haverford] in the Seven Sisters' Tournament.
On Wednesday we came out confident but
faced a tough stretch in the first half. The
second half started with a strong run and our
superior skill and intensity carried us to victory. We squashed the bug," added CochranBond.
