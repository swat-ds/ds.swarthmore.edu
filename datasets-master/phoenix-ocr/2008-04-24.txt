Mary Prager: When did you find out
that you were going to receive this fellowship?
Jeremy Freeman: Well, I got an e-mail
from [them]
it's like this weird thing,
they don't tell you right away, it gets post...

ed on this website before
so one of the
grad schools that I applied to, one of the
professors
that I had been in contact
with, e-mailed me and was like, "congratulations on the NSF." and then I was officially informed later that night.
MP: When did you apply for it?
JF: Back in November.
MP: And was it a pretty complicated

application?

JF: It was fairly complicated. You had
to write a series of essays ... there was a
personal statement, a science-oriented
personal statement and a description of
proposed activities.
MP: So what was your proposed
activity?
JF: I'm very interested in how the

You can use this technique to figure
out,.based on patterns of neural activity,
whether the brain is looking at the vertical bars or horizontal bars. So it's very
neat, very different.
Normally we measure activity in
someone's brain while the person is looking at something, and then try to look at
what stimulus evokes what kind of
response. With this new technique, we
can study a given response and decode
what the brain is looking at.
MP: Is this something you want to
pursue in grad school?
JF: It's one of many things I want to
pursue in grad school. Fundamentally,
I'm interested vision, which works like
this: light hits the retina and then the
first layer of visual neurons decodes very
simple information based on simply oriented bars.
After that, a lot of magic happens and
then, we see. Basically, I want to know
how that magic happens.
There's this unbelievably complicated computation that takes the elementary feature information consisting of
edges and motions
and enables us to
see it as coherent objects.
Obviously we don't see a jumble of
colors and edges, we see coherent things:
chairs and faces and letters. So, I'm fun-

damentally interested in understanding

how the brain puts all that information
together to compute the identity of what
we're looking at. I would say it's currently the most difficult and interesting

information,
specifically object information and a lot
of my work has been on the specific case of
letters, and how the brain represents the
identity of the letter.
So my proposed research was applying
a fairly novel FMI imaging data analysis
technique to further our understanding of

always been a science person?

NSF grant, you wrote up a research proposal, correct? What was your proposal,
and what do you plan to do with it?
Lydia The: How you could find more

because understanding how totipotency
works, which is the ability that stem cells
and germ-line cells (germ line cells being
sperm and egg cells) have to become any
type of cell the body has, has magnificent
potential for generating organs for particular diseases and extending fertility of older
eggs, because right now, the older the eggs
get, their ability to generate normal whole
organisms deteriorates, to figure that out.

move, and so to understand how the
cytoskeleton works would be really great,

because if you knew how it worked you
could hinder it and potentially hinder cancer cells from metastasizing and knit their
potency.
MP: How do you feel about receiving
the NSF grant?
LT: Well, it's a really big deal. It's 121,500
over three years for your stipend for three
years and for your tuition. It doesn't cover
everything but it covers a lot. It's also it's
more than the money, the money is nice but
it doesn't make that much of a difference in
my life, but the prestige really will make a
difference, and it's really encouraging, just
level, to know that a panel of
scientist looked at my application and said,
"Yeah, she's a promising scientist. We're
going to give her money." And it's also just,
in terms of my career, it's the first huge
achievement that I've made and it will help
me forward when I'm searching for further
grants, and push my career forward.
MP: Where does your interest in the

sciences come from?

LT: I participated in
a program the
New York Academy of Sciences had which

was called the Summer Research Training
Program, just for high schoolers. The first
time I did that, I was sixteen, and it was really, I think my interest in science was inner-

Lopez

Phoenix Staff

ent, and I think interest in science is just
inherent in most people. When you look at
kids they're just really interested in figuring out things, and so really it's not so much
that some people get interested in science
and they go ahead and pursue it.
I think it's that some people get mentored and their interest in science gets nurtured into something that they then want to
pursue and feel that they can pursue, and
having that kind of mentorship and support
at such a young age of sixteen and throughout college has made it possible for me to
realize that, yeah, I like science, but I can
actually do science.

And I think there aren't that many great
role models for women of color in science, so
having people actually mentor me and support me and show me that they really
thought that I had potential and was worth
investing time and energy allowed me to
nurture that inherent interest in science.
MP: What do you plan do after grad
school?
LT: Well, I plan to, or I hope to, run a lab
and do lots of cool science, and become
famous! But I also think that ifI really want
to have this impact on science, yeah, I can
do some great science myself and that's
going to have its own value, but I think the
greatest value I can have is to mentor people. Your ability to do research and discover cool things is limited, but if you mentor
the next generation, then they can go and
pursue that, and that would be even
greater.

Chelsea Clinton stumps at Swat, speaks on behalf of mother
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu
Chelsea Clinton spoke on campus last Thursday to
rally support for her mother's candidacy. After delivering a speech entitled, "It's Your Future; It's Bright," she
fielded students' questions on Senator Clinton's policy
agenda.
"[Chelsea Clinton] doesn't come with anything prepared, she just wants to get us to support her mother,"
said Romane Paul 'lO, an organizer of the event. "What I
like is that she had such an in-depth knowledge of her
mother's policies, in and out, numbers and everything."

"Having [a candidate] would have
been much more of a challenge. The
Secret Service would have amplified
everything, not to mention the
parking, the crowds, and the media."
Maurice Eldridge '6l

Vice President
Paul estimates that around 350 students were present,
some of whom were prospective students visiting campus for the college's annual Ride the Tide weekend. "I
knew that there would be a big turnout, but I didn't
expect that much," Paul said, especially given that the
event was organized on short notice.
According to Paul, the leaders of Students for Hillary
Clinton were contacted about the possibility of Chelsea
visiting only two nights before the event would take
place. "I had e-mailed Chelsea's scheduler and asked if
she could bring Chelsea here," Paul said. "I said that
Election Day was approaching and there are tons of
undecided voters here on campus, so it would be a good
thing to bring her, and she contacted us a week later."
Members of Students for Hillary Clinton met the next
day with Maurice Eldridge and representatives from
Publie Safety, facilities and others charged with the task
of setting up the event. "I called together the people who
would have to manage the logistical needs of the events
to see if we could actually pull it off," Vice President

Maurice Eldridge '6l said. "The issues turned out to be
relatively few."
Once it was determined that the event was possible,
attendees of the meeting walked around campus to
choose a site. Although the Amphitheater was considered, the group chose Parrish Beach West to hold the
event. "[Ms. Clinton's representatives] like putting her
someplace where people can wander to the event and
relax, lay down, walk away if they want to," Paul said.
"The weather was great, and all together it made for a
nice venue."
The event was only advertised to TriCo students and
the college provided all the necessary security. "The
event was not going to be known much outside of TriCo,
which simplified things," said Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave. "It usually makes for a smaller crowd.
So after hearing the plans, I walked out of the meeting
feeling like this was an event we could handle," he said.
Public Safety had five officers at the event, some uniformed and others plain-clothed, but this was minimal
compared to the security that would have been necessary
to control the crowds if one of the presidential candidates had come. "It would have been much more of a

challenge," Redgrave said. "The Secret Service would
have amplified everything, not to mention the parking,

the crowds and the media."
Eldridge emphasized that the college's decision to host
Ms. Clinton after denying the Obama campaign's request
for a speaking venue was not a political maneuver. "If we
can handle an event without disrupting the primary function of the college
which is to educate
and if the
event will add to that education, we can do these things,"
Eldridge said. As a nonprofit institution, the college must
be even handed in deciding which events to host.
"Whatever my political leanings are, the institution has
to be neutral, and I try to be the guardian of that neutrality," Eldridge said.
Many students who attended the event were impressed
with Ms. Clinton not only for her extensive knowledge of
her mother's policies and capability to fully answer questions, but also for her ability as a speaker. "She spoke so
well and was so articulate," Katy Feniello 'OB said. "And
she spoke to us as peers. She kept saying 'we' because she
was speaking as part of our generation."
Other students were less impressed with Ms. Clinton
as a speaker. "It was obvious she really knew [Hillary
Clinton] but it seemed like she was not very passionate,"
said Summer Miller-Walfish 'll

During the event, Chelsea Clinton answered questions
on such issues as animal rights and free trade.
Whether supportive of Hillary Clinton or not, students were glad to have the opportunity to see such a distinguished public figure on campus.
"I was just so thrilled she could come to campus,"
Feniello said. "It's great to see such a big name come
here."

BRIEF

Student health advisory council seeks to give feedback, ideas to Worth
In order to give students more input into the
health services offered at Swarthmore, Worth Health
Center Director Beth Kotarski has recently formed a
student advisory committee, the Student Health
Advisory Council. Kotarski is optimistic that this
committee, coupled with an increase in student
input, will help make Worth Health Center more
accessible to all students.
"Too often college health centers are viewed only
in terms of the negative stories that come out of
them," Kotarski said, citing anecdotes about misdiagnoses and long wait times as deterrents that keep
students away from Worth.
SHAC will act as a channel of communication
between students and the health center. "It is meant
to be an avenue for students concerns and can then
discuss those concerns with me or other staff members, and we work together trying for a solution,"
Kotarski said.
According to SHAC member Dina Kopansky 'IX
one major concern that SHAC hopes to address in the
coming year is the issue of privacy. "It's awkward to
discuss a host of different concerns at that open, public front area. Privacy should be one of Worth's top
priorities," she said.
Kotarski discussed several measures that will be
implemented as early as next fall to increase privacy
in Worth. One such measure is the use of "private
slips," where students can write their conditions on
a slip that will be read by Worth personnel and then
be referred to the correct facility for treatment.
Another proposed precaution is a "one at a time"
policy at the front desk, which would give students
April 24, 2008

more privacy while signing in. Aside from the privacy issue, the members of SHAC have several other

initiatives to help them gather student feedback on
how to optimize campus health services.
Kopansky hopes to develop an anonymous survey
that allows students to evaluate the quality of health
services- She hopes that this input will encourage
improvements.

"Students are our main priority, we take their
needs very seriously," Kotarski said. "That is the
main reason for SHAC, so that students are aware
and involved in what goes on," Kotarski said.
On Tuesday, SHAC hosted its first health and wellness fair in Sharpies from 5 -7 p.m. Many healthrelated groups were represented including CAPS,
EMTs, Global Health Forum, the WRC and the
Student Health and Wellness Committee.
The goal was to raise awareness about health
services on campus. "Health services has a vast
amount of resources that students may not even
know exist, so I hope that this wiE get the word out,"
Kopansky said.
Kate Goertzen 'O9, a current member of SHAC,
said that the event just one ofmany health servicesponsored events on campus
was wellreceived by
students.
Kotarski said she is looking forward to developing
future student-oriented initiatives. "It's the beginning of a whole host of wellness initiatives for students that we hope to develop in the coming years,"
she said. "As the years go by, I hope it evolves both in
size and tradition."

Orientation considers changes
BY YINGJIA WANG

ywangl@swarthmore.edu

Members of the class of 2012 will get a
new introduction to the college when
they arrive on campus in the fall of 2008.
The Deans Office and the Orientation
Committee are currently hard at work
planning Orientation 2008, and they note
that there will be significant differences
from previous orientations. At the
moment, many possible changes are
being discussed.
According to OC member Brendan
Work 'lO, the committee is trying to further incorporate the orientation's theme
into the event itself.

"Because we can't make
[the backpacking trip] an
opportunity available to
everybody, we decided to
cancel it."
Myrt Westphal
Associate Dean for
Student Life
"We want the theme to be incorporat-

ed a lot more effectively. If you asked
freshman last year what their theme was,
they probably couldn't tell you. Not that
we want to make it too cheesy, but we
want to have an overall theme that will
bring all events together," Work said.
While the theme has already been
chosen, it has yet to be revealed. The OC
will be hosting a mixer on May 4 for all

past, or may be based on a student's residential location.
"The development of CA groups will
try to be as random as possible but we'll

be using identifiers like dorm location
and gender as a secondary strategy,"
Flowers said in an e-mail.
Westphal, however, stated that CA
groups will be drawn from students
from two different dorms. Halfthe group
will be from one dorm while the other
half will be from another dorm.
"We want to do this so that when you
leave your CA group, you know a bunch
of people from the same dorm and from
another dorm. You can get a comfort
level in different dorm and know a variety of people," Westphal said. "The hope
is that CA group connections will last

longer."

Work said that ultimately, the creation of the CA groups is still up in the
air. This upcoming Orientation will also
include a pre-Orientation component for
freshmen athletes, who arrive on campus before the rest of their class.
"We are working on a mini-orientation for the athletes because when the
freshmen come, they are in a dorm, and
hardly anyone is there. Yes, they have
their team and practice, but they don't
have a lot of people to interact with

when they're not with the team in practice. We wanted to do welcoming activities and give safety tips," Westphal said.
"Sometimes an RA would arrive on a
hall six hours later than an athlete
would. Who is supposed to guide them
around? We will get a list and know
who's coming in so that we know to
greet them and check on them. They will
have people to show them the ropes,"
Westphal

said.

the Campus Advisors where the theme

will be announced.
A change already known to many
current students is the cancellation of
the pre-orientation backpacking trip.
According to Associate Dean for Student
Life Myrt Westphal, the trip was
dropped due to its exclusivity.
"Because we can't make that trip an
opportunity available to everybody, we
decided to cancel it. As we were thinking about orientation, we asked ourselves, 'ls that somewhere we want to
put our time, energy, and resources
into? Something that is not available to
everyone?'... We thought that it was
important not to privilege
some,"

Westphal said.

"We want new students
to have opportunities
from the very beginning
to gain mind-body-spirit

health."
Paury Flowers
Assistant Coordinator of
Student Events
In addition, the OC, which is primastudents and led by

rily composed of

Assistant Coordinator of Student Events
Paury Flowers, will now be in charge of
creating CA groups. According to Work,
that duty was formerly left to the Deans
Office.
The groups may continue to be made
randomly as has been the case in years

cle in a tuck away corner of campus. We
want new students to have opportunities
from the very beginning to gain mindbody-spirit health so that they can be the
best students they can be," Flowers said
in an e-mail.
While the OC and the Deans Office
have yet to finalize all the details surrounding next year's Orientation, many

ideas have been tossed around and are
being considered.
In the future, events more significant
to acclimating the students to academic
Swarthmore,
and social life at
Orientation 2008 will have more emphasis on wellness than past orientations.
According to Westphal, possible activities centered on wellness include yoga
or tai chi on Parrish Beach, opportunities to sample physical education classes
and activities with healthy snacks and

cooking.
"I think that thinking about orientation is an ongoing process, so we're making some smaller changes now, but I
think that fairly soon, we will probably
think, 'Do we want to do things radically
different? What are we trying to achieve,
and what's the best way to achieve it?'"
Westphal

said.

Phoenix Reporter Matt Bleiman 'll recently sat down with

Professor ofPhysics Michael Brown to talk about his recent
award from the American Physical Society
the 2008 Prize
for a Faculty Member for Research in an Undergraduate
Institution. According to the APS, the award was given to
him, "for his outstanding contributions to plasma physics
madepossible by his development of a world-class spheromak
laboratory at Swarthmore College, andfor his energetic mentoring of undergraduate students."

Matt Bleiman: You recently won the American
Physical Society's 2008 Prize for a Faculty Member for
Research in an Undergraduate Institution. What kind of
research did you do to win this prize?
Michael Brown: The research I do is generally called
plasma physics
the physics of hot ionized gases
and
what I tell folks is that I have two intellectual streams or
ideas that I pursue. One is funded by the Department of
Energy, and that is to do ideas in magnetic confinement
fusion, to try to make the gas very very hot and confined and
dense so that maybe it could be a fusion reactor. The second
stream has to do with more basic physics ideas and that is
supported by the National Science Foundation. That is to
study laboratory astrophysics and the idea is to create conditions in the laboratory that are similar to what is found in
an astrophysical environment, say near the surface of the
sun or maybe near a black hole.
Matt Bleiman: What is the Swarthmore Spheromak
Experiment (SSX)?
Michael Brown: Well, spheromak is the word that scientists have for this spherical, magnetized ball of plasma. So
we make two spheromaks, kind of like a ring with a magnetic field that goes the long way around as well as the short
way around and makes a spherical packet. We make two of
these packets and smash them together to simulate processes that might happen on the surface of the sun.
Matt Bleiman: What kind of equipment do you use
for the experiments?
Michael Brown: The machine has several components.
The main components are two plasma guns on the end of the
machine that make these plasma rings, spheromaks. The
way we are able to get these intense conditions is that we use
very high voltages and high energies. The power supplies
operate at 10,000 volts and 100,000 amps so that is a gigawatt
of power for a short time. So we put a gigawatt of power into
each spheromak and drive them together so we can get temperatures that are astrophysical
a million degrees or so

for a short time. The densities and the magnetic field
strengths are also what you would find on the surface of the
sun.
Matt Bleiman: How did you get into plasma physics?
MichaelBrown: Well that was the other intellectual idea
when I was in high school and even college. I was interested
in fusion energy as a means to save the world and address
the world's energy needs. The idea offusion energy is that it
is the process that runs the sun and the stars and if we can
figure out how to do that on earth it would save the world.
Matt Bleiman: You won your award for "research at
an undergraduate institution." Do you think it is harder to do research at a smaller school like Swarthmore?
Michael Brown: I guess so. I think Swarthmore is
unique among small colleges in the support that we get for
doing our scholarship and our research. We have our own

laboratories and there is a research ethic at the college that
the students are interested and enthusiastic about helping
with research. There is also a great leave policy that the
administration has so we can take a year off every four so we
can take some time off every four years for sabbatical. So
that said, I think it has been a really unique experience
being at Swarthmore. It is true that we do not have graduate
students and we have a higher teaching load than a professor at a research university would have, but that is why I'm
here. The progress goes more slowly but I hope that it is of
the same quality that a professor would have at Stanford or
Harvard.
Matt Bleiman: So then how do you get students
involved with your research?
Michael Brown: That is really the key and that is really
the main thing I want to say. It really would not have happened without the help of Swarthmore undergraduates. In
particular there have been sixteen honors senior thesis proj-

ects on the machine so that is sixteen students that focused
enough time to write a thesis and go through the external

examination process.
In addition to those students there were another twenty
or so that helped out in various ways but not in the honors
program, say in their freshman or sophomore year. I have
also taught a plasma class a couple of times so I have had a
lot of good interaction with students. That is the key for this
award and that is really what the prize is about is working
with undergraduates and it could not have happened without them.
Matt Bleiman: What are you going to do with the
stipend for the award?
Michael Brown: There are two pieces to the award.
$5,000 goes to the physics departmental fund so that will fund
student stipends and travel funds for students. $5,000 also
went to me and I will probably use that for traveling to meetings that I would normally not go to or other kinds of academic things.
Matt Bleiman: Do you have any plans for the future
oftheSSX?
Michael Brown: Well we have a grant cycle so every
three years I have to come up with new ideas and we are
right in the middle of a grant cycle. So actually the machine
is in a very different form than it was for much of the work
that was done for the award. Fundamentally we will be
doing the same kinds of things using these interesting spheromak loops to study plasma physics and looking at them by
themselves or merging them together, but we will be doing
the same kind of high energy, high temperature, short pulse
plasma physics work.
A new thing that we are just beginning is computer modeling and that is something that I am not an expert in at all
but I am starting to get some contacts from computer scientists that are experts in modeling these kind of phenomena.
No one here does this exact thing but I am looking at collaborations at other universities to do that and that would certainly involve students here.

Harvard student brews own education
BY LAURA C. MCKIERNAN
HARVARD CRIMSON (HARVARD)
When the Cambridge Queen's Head Pub
(U-WIRE)
opened last spring, it included an unmarked tap among the
more recognizable beer names. Patrons had to know to ask
for the honey lager, which had been brewed by several
enterprising undergraduates with a keen interest in beer.
This limited edition beer was only the latest step by
Philip "Beamer" R. Eisele 'OB, one of the keg's two undergraduate brewers, on his path to opening his own brewery.
Eisele's life, both in and out of the classroom, has
revolved around his interest in beer and his future career
aspirations. During his junior and senior year, he developed two independent study courses at Harvard and pursued an internship at Harpoon Brewery, a Boston-based

craft brewery.

Although a government concentrator, Eisele has
brought his passion for beer to the classroom and molded
a plan of study over the past four years that has enabled
him to explore a subject not traditionally taught at

Harvard.
Writing the Recipe

Eisele says his love for beer dates back to his very first
taste.
"My first beer was a Budweiser from my grandpa's
fridge when I was cutting the grass," he says. "I think I was
13. It made me feel really cool. It made me feel more like my
dad."
Eisele grew up in a German family in the hometown of
the Anheuser-Busch companies in St. Louis, MO.
He says his first taste of "good beer"— a Harpoon IPA
did not come until college. He further developed an appreciation for the beverage during his sophomore year abroad
in Australia.
As an injured football recruit to Harvard, Eisele considers his time in Australia a turning point.
"It was there that I decidedthere's not enough good beer
in the U.S., or at least I hadn't been introduced to it yet,"
says Eisele, who says he cannot decide on a favorite beer.
Foregoing a return to the football field, Eisele instead
turned his attention to crafting his new-found interest:
beer.
Fermenting Desires
After returning from Australia at the beginning of his
junior year, Eisele approached his House master in Cabot
House about crafting independent study courses on the
beer industry. First focusing on the chemistry ofbeer-making, Eisele developed a syllabus for an independent study
course on the mechanics of brewing and the metabolic
aspects of yeast activity.

NEWS

Under the tutelage of Senior Lecturer on Chemistry
Gregory Tucci, Eisele began his first independent study
course in the spring of his junior year, while also pursuing
an unpaid internship at Harpoon Brewery.
Eisele's mother, Anne Eisele, says she was supportive
yet surprised by her son's academic pursuit. "At first I
thought he was joking," she says. "I didn't even realize
that Harvard had an independent study program."
During his internship at Harpoon, Eisele worked three
times a week for 10 hours each day while rotating through
several different departments, including brewing and
quality control.
It was during his internship that Eisele, along with
friend Christopher J. Benway 'OB, crafted the recipe for the
Pub's week-long special brew last spring.
Harpoon's Quality Control Manager Jaime Schier
instructed Eisele on ingredient selection and brewing
methods.

"Beer has been under the radar in
the culinary front in the past... Not a
lot of people in the U.S. would
picture beer as being the perfect
complement to a meal."
Philip "Beamer Eisele
Undergraduate brewer
"I spent several days talking to him about what sort of
things to look for, how different brewing techniques would
influence the final character of the beer [and] ways you
could tweak things to make the beer taste one way or

another," Shier says.

Impressed by Eisele's enthusiasm and attention to
detail, Shier notes Eisele was never without notebook in-

hand.
"When I worked with him, he whipped it out at least 20
times to scribble something in it," Shier says. "He kept you
on your toes because he is inquisitive about basically
everything."

As Eisele's thirst for beer had yet to be quenched, he
pursued a second independent study course the fall of his
senior year.

Craving a biological rather than chemical approach to
beer, Eisele was directed to Lecturer on Organismic and
Evolutionary Biology Andrew Berry to develop a reading
list on food and taste pairings. Berry added a detailed

IN

review of the neurobiology of taste to Eisele's sommelier
literature on wine.
"Beer has been under the radar in the culinary front in
the past," Eisele says. "Not a lot of people in theU.S. would
picture beer as being the perfect complement to a meal."
The course focused on the physiological response when
food is introduced into the mouth.
"As an Englishman," Berry says, "I'm partial to my
beer."
Calling the course a "joint exploration," Berry says he
found the material fascinating, particularly as this was
his first experience with the independent study program.
The independent study program reminded Berry of
his undergraduate experience at Oxford under the oneon-one tutorial system for its personal approach. He says
it surprised him because it required "a massively disproportionate amount ofeffort in terms of the number of students benefiting."
Upon reflection, Eisele says he wishes he had considered applying for a special concentration to better tailor
his academic work to his interests.
Yet Eisele says he realizes that such intensive independent pursuits require a "creative mind."
"You have to have something completely out of the
box that you want to take into an academic area," Eisele
says.

What's on Tap

Pulling from his experiences as bar operations manager and bartender at the Pub, Eisele says he hopes to
work in restaurant management for several years after
a restaugraduation before opening his own brewpub
rant that brews its own beer on-site.
"Opening a brewery like the Harpoon Brewery today
would be nearly impossible, but when you start with
your own microbrewery or brewpub it's a lot easier to

transition from small-scale brewing to industrial brewing," he says.
Eisele says he plans to open his first brewpub with his
longtime friend and business partner Nick Jenkerson, a
junior at St. Louis University.
"We were sitting out on the porch figuring out what
we were going to do with our lives, and we came to the
conclusion that we wanted to create a product that we
enjoyed," Jenkerson says. "There is not really anything
better than opening up a restaurant or bar."
Eisele's father notes that their family has a long history of entrepreneurship, and Eisele's latest endeavor
will fit right in.
After tasting her son's homemade brew, Eisele's mother says she was "surprised at how good it was."
"I hope I can come and work for him one day," she
adds. "Maybe I'll be the dishwasher."

BRIEF

Redesigned News and Information website uses videos, podcasts and photos to bring press releases to life

Launched about two weeks ago, the
newly revamped Swarthmore News Web
site incorporates podcasts, videos, blogs
and Blickr photos to make the college Web
2.0 compatible and to reach out to parents,
alumni and current and prospective students.

"We wanted to capture the energy and
vitality of student life
in particular
through videos and podcasts," Director of
Communications Nancy Nicely said. The
Web site also contains links to blogs offaculty, students and staff, including Ms. Ts
blog, an admissions office {staff member's
online journal]." Those visiting the Web
site can also. access lectures from faculty
experts and recent college headlines.
...

A collaborative effort amongst students,
staff and, in particular, Nicely and
News and Information Associate Director
Aiisa Giardenelli, the Web site began as an
idea last fail and has developed into a multimedia display of student and college life.
Nicely and Giardenelli along with Web
faculty,

designer Steve Lin and "podcast expert"
Nate Stazewski of Alumni Relations,
Media Services technicians David Neal
and Mike Bednarz, Media Services director Michael Patterson and Web developer
Marc Lewis worked to generate content
and to design the Web site itself.
The Web site team also looked to other
university News Web sites for inspiration.
"We did extensive benchmarking. What
we learned was that it has taken everyone
a long time to catch up to Web 2.0. We
weren't as far behind as we would have
imagined," Nicely said. Nicely and
Giardenellihave had to become technologically adept quickly thanks to the hightech nature of the new Web site. "It's an
ongoing process," Giardenelli said of the
technology she has had to pick up.
"I am blessed with a staff that is technologically savvy," Nicely said. According
to Nicely, the team had "Web-inars," or
professional development seminars, to
become conversant in the necessary tech-

nology and to learn about the best prac-

tices.

Nicely expects that the new Web site
will be utilized by alumni, staff, faculty,
matriculating students, parents and future
Swarthmore students. "There is a real
hunger for ways to connect to what happens on campus," Nicely said, also noting
that sometimes mere words cannot wholly
convey, as videos can, the college experience. Giardenellialso mentioned that she
received feedback from an alumnus from
the class of 1957, who commented on a
video of the Phoenix mascot tryouts.
The goal is to have video updates occurring weekly and podcast updates monthly.
Additionally, videos will be put on
YouTube and all of the podcasts will eventually be available on iTunes. Nicely
expects thatall of this will beachieved during this coming summer. A boost in viewership has already been noted, as Nicely
stated that within the first week of unveiling the site there has a four-fold increase

April 24, 2008

from last year's Web site traffic, notedduring the same time period. According to
Nicely, visits to the Web site will be tallied
once a month from now on.

"We wanted to capture
the energy and vitality of

student life."
Nancy Nicely
Director of
Communications
According to Nicely, the Web site is a
project that will be continually changed
and improved. "We really welcomestudent
feedback. We're very open to revision,"
Nicely said.

These are issues that affect

Johnston, who appeared via Skype and described herself as ambitious/motivated, cited her previous experience on student government as evidence of her preparedness to facilitate dialog with members of the
IC/BCC community. "[On Student Council] I set up meetings with leaders of the IC/BCC

This week, a political frenzy consumed the campus as
students prepared to participate in not one, but two elections. Last Friday, the Student Council presidential candidates held a second debate in the Intercultural Center
to continue to answer students' questions about important issues in the run-up to the Student Council election,
which coincided with the contentious Pennsylvania primary election on Tuesday.
This year's presidential candidates, Paul Apollo 'O9,
Yongjun Heo 'O9 and Randall Johnston 'O9 took turns
addressing specific questions in a debate moderated by
current Student Council Financial Aid Policy
Representative Sarah Roberts 'OB.
The candidates were asked to introduce themselves

two minutes each.
Roberts opened the debate by asking the candidates
about what they hoped students would get out of the
debate.

The candidates expressed the general expectation that
students should feel free to raise questions or concerns
pertaining to the candidates' platforms as well as share
their aspirations for the college's future, in light of the
2020 long-term planning campaign.

Concerns about issues such as diversity, difference
and the role of the IC/BCC community surfaced in several questions posed by students over the course of the
debate.
Attendees asked the candidates to elaborate on their
suitability for the role of representative liaison between
the student body and the administration, and some students also raised issues of accountability.
Romane Paul 'lO asked what each candidate would do
to cultivate a strong, working relationship between
Student Council and the IC/BCC community, as well as
which concerns of the IC/BCC community they would
prioritize as most urgent.
Most candidates agreed that the concerns of the
IC/BCC community were representative of the greater
student body's concerns and expressed the need to
address their interests in the execution of the 2020 campaign.
"I would say the IC/BCC concerns are whether they
are going to be heard for 2020," Heo, who described himADVERTISEMENT

issue of class and how candidates would ensure that the

spoke about the recent "No Loans" policy adopted by the
college and raised his concern that the initiative may not
be equally advantageous for all students, nor was the
proposal sufficiently publicized to the student body prior

"Student Council this semester and last semester had
meetings for IC/BCC leaders, but no one showed up,"
Apollo said.
"I think the reason is because Student Council hasn't
worked enough to earn the trust of the IC/BCC. Why
should they come? I think Student Council needs to show
that we're willing to listen to those demands and to
change things as soon as possible," he said.
The candidates equally stressed the importance of
maintaining an open and communicative relationship
with the IC/BCC community by holding meetings with
leaders of these communities to ensure that their
demands are being attended to.
Both Johnston and Heo suggested faculty and the
administration presence at these meetings, while both
Apollo and Heo believed that Student Council members
should work more effectively as both separate and conjoined units and that individuals' duties should not be
limited to their job descriptions.
"Student Council needs to have a few goals in mind,
needs to be in charge, needs to have deadlines," Heo said.
"They should aspire towards one specific goal as a body
They need to work together to get one thing done
while individual members get more things done that are
specific to the individual job requirements."
Another student who attended the event, Fletcher

All three candidates affirmed the importance of supporting initiatives such as need-blind admissions
for international students and ensuring that orientation workshops and campus events more directly

address current class issues.

However, candidates diverged on the issue of the
work-study component.
Johnston's objections to the work-study requirement are informed by her personal experience with
financial aid, as she is obligated to continue to pay
this portion of her tuition while studying abroad in
Spain.
"I can relate to this because I can't work while
I'm in Spain, but I still have to pay the work-study
component. I think that it's unreasonable," she
said. "Right now, my concrete goal is eliminating
the work-study component for students who are
abroad and can't work."

April 24, 2008

Although Heo believed that campus jobs can and
should continue to exist for students who want and need
them, he supported the possibility of replacing the workstudy component with scholarships instead. Heo spoke
of the need to alleviate the burden on students who are
forced to compromise their academic performance by
juggling multiple jobs.
"I worked three jobs my freshman year, and still do,
while I knew that... another friend was doing his organic chemistry," he said. "There's a difference between an
A- and a B+. This is something that affects lower income
families."

Apollo addressed the question from his own workingclass background experience. He believed that what students of similar backgrounds did not want was for work-

study to be eliminated, as they enjoyed knowing that
they were at least partially paying and earning their education.

"I am actually considered wealthy where I come from,

[but I am] from a poor background and definitely understand the needs of poor students at Swarthmore," he said.
"I can say that almost universally people of poor back-

grounds want to feel that they've worked for what they
I'm for decreasing the work component but certainly not eliminating it."
Additional questions were raised asked about the status of last year's proposal for a three-day Thanksgiving
break equivalent in the spring, an initiative that receded
from the council's agenda due to concerns about its practicality.
Some students expressed concern that this and other
initiatives have either dropped off of the council's radar
or are no longer being aired in a public forum. "A lot of
the initiatives proposed by Student Council have not
died or are still being worked on or are just not public
anymore," Apollo said. "Sometime it has been discerned
that there was no student support for a specific initiative

"I can say that almost universally
people of poor backgrounds want to

Students also asked the candidates to elaborate on the
possibility of extending Student Council meeting times if
current Student Council meeting times were felt to be

insufficient.
"At least when I was on StuCo, we didn't just meet
once a week," Johnston said. "You also have to include
all of the 10-15 hours of other meetings that we have
Formally, I would just stick with the one hour and hold
ad hoc meetings."
A few of the students who attended the event felt that
the candidates' answers were formulated well and that
they could learn a little more about the candidates' agendas through some of the more anecdotal and candid
answers that were given in response to their questions.
"I thought that a lot of important issues were brought
up in this debate for the IC/BCC community," Coleman.
"While each candidate had their own unique perspectives, they all addressed the questions pretty well and
had pretty clear ideas about ways in which they would
help out the cultural groups and would be able to deal
...

with issues of class," he said.
"I appreciated [the] question that asked the candidates to address a time in their lives, in both an organized setting and in a personal setting, when they've experienced difference and diversity," Brianne Gallagher 'OB,
another student who attended the debate, said. "I
thought the candidates' responses gave me an idea of the
varying degrees to which the candidates exert mental
and emotional energy thinking about issues of difference, marginalization, and oppression," she said.
Although online voting has already passed, the option
for paper voting is still taking place today in Sharpies.

ALEX HO
Critical Mass Media
Hi, my name is Alex, and I am a
YouTuber.
And just when you thought that
this column couldn't fall any lower
into the depths of low culture,
("Bring it On"? Seriously?) I am
devoting my last column entirely
to the home of the viral video, the
Time Person of 2006 (if I wasn't
mistaken) and what has recently
overtaken much of the time that I
would traditionally reserve for
watching movies. Yes, YouTube is
an absolutely bottomless well of
largely crappy videos and yes, a
part of me is slightly ashamed to
confess my You Tubing ways. Still,
another part of me (the ADD infantile part) breathlessly heralds the
coming of a new age of media consumption where tons ofarchival
footage of, say Marilyn Monroe,
can be endlessly repeated and
reexamined by anyone, where
record labels now look to the
Internet to broadcast promotional
videos, where any Joe Schmoe can
look into their webcams and
become a self-entitled diva. If these
thoughts seem completely prosaic
and obvious, it's only evidence of
YouTube's utter usefulness to our
media demands that in the three
years since YouTube's inception,
the language of Internet videography has become so omnipresent.
Much as I love uncovering old
films and TV shows (Is "Batman:
The Animated Series" not the best
ever?), some of the most interesting videos on YouTube aren't
media relics, but creations by people with little to no connection to
the entertainment industry. First,
there's "littleloca," a video journal
by a Hispanic teenager named
Cynthia from East LA. who introduces herself as "yourTiomegirl."
Then, there's "DaxFlame," the
video log of a maladjusted 14-year
old boy who throws tantrums at
his unseen mother.
If you haven't already guessed,
these two "vlogs" are fake. The
first, performed by a white actress
named Stevie Ryan, throws its
viewers for a loop. One's immediate reaction might be, isn't this
reprehensible? Should a white
actress be performing a race?
Should we be watching a white
actress performing a race? At the
same time, Ryan plays her character so resolutely that it's a creation
to be contended, not dismissed.
Cynthia is a loud, annoying character to be sure, but Ryan gives
Cynthia so much conviction and
self-respect that she at least makes
us consider how stereotyping and

Kylie Minogue's "Come into My

that his work has always had a
kinship with "uglier" video formats, Gondry's foray into YouTube
hardly seems to be a stretch.
There's a video of Gondry solving

Boy Meets Tractor wins comedy prize
BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu
Most Swarthmore students think that sketch

comedy group Boy Meets Tractor is pretty damn
or at least the greater
funny. The world
seems to agree. Last week,
Philadelphia area
BMT contended against various sketch comedy
groups from nearby colleges at Helium Comedy
Club's College Comedy Competition. With their
unique blend of slapstick and esoteric humor, BMT
wowed the judges and ultimately took first place in
the sketch portion of the competition.
Helium's College Comedy
Competition,
designed to showcase young talent, was divided
into two categories: standup and sketch comedy.
BMT opted out of participating in the standup portion, saving up their energy to rock the sketch half
of the competition. BMT battled with three other
sketch comedy groups from Drexel, UPenn and
Haverford's Lighted Fools. According to BMT

member Alex Friedman 'O9, the groups were

judged by the comedy troupe the Secret Pants,
which had devised a "fairly complicated" judging
rubric. Specific attributes such as "originality,
crowd reaction, je ne sais quois, [and] stage presence""were seen as particularly important.
Since each group had only ten minutes to prove
itself to the judges, BMT decided to perform its
"Action Figure" sketch, which debuted recently at
BMT's joint show with Vertigo-go and the Lighted
Fools. The sketch features a boy and his sister
playing with their action figures, while other
troupe members recreate the action scenes that
are taking place. "We knew that it got a really good
reception at Swarthmore," Friedman said.
BMT had rehearsed the sketch roughly eight
times before the competition and the real difficulty lay in "making sure the costumes [stayed]
together," Daniel Jamison 'OB said. The group also
faced the challenge of having to perform on a stage

that was

markedly

April 24, 2008

smaller than the one it was

used to. "We did have some problems with the
logistics but it worked out fine," Jamison said.
Technical difficulties aside, the judges reacted
well to BMT's sketch, declaring the group the competition's victors. BMT was rewarded with a
chance to participate in the Philly Sketch Fest this
June in addition to tickets to shows at the Helium
Comedy Club and t-shirts. For Friedman, ""the
best part [of winning] was that for the first time it
felt like we had objective proof that we are
funny.""
It takes a lot of hard work to become the best
college sketch comedy group in the greater
Philadelphia area. "Last weekend we killed a man
and, during the week, we all took turns wearing
his skin
that's why we knew we could win
at
the sketch comedy competition," Jamison said.
Joking aside, BMT works in an incredibly meticulous manner to put together each and every sketch.
While some sketches are initially written by
only one person, most usually come to fruition as a
result of group deliberation and editing. "We'll
start the semester by throwing out ideas,"
Friedman said. BMT members then split up and
focus on a single sketch, going almost line-by-line
to refine the plot arc. In the end, all sketches are
very much a collaborative effort and, according to
Jamison, "it is unclear who worked on exactly
what sketch." In the case of the "Action Figure"
sketch, Jamison notes that there was a core group
who wrote the scene fairly quickly and then enlisted the help of the rest of BMT for the editing
process.
Through its painstaking dedication to the creation of sketches and its penchant for wacky comedy, BMT has shown that it is a comedic force to be
reckoned with. With its upcoming performance at
the Philly Sketch Fest, the group will have a
chance to showcase its talent to an even broader
audience. We can only hope that BMT members
will not have to kill any more men as they prepare
for bigger and better things.

two days before I took the exam
that would determine my entire

But there was one Saturday
when I wasn't in class and she wasn't going on any walking tours, so
we decided we should team up and
I should put my expert knowledge
of my adopted homeland to the
test. Making an executive decision
that was in no way colored by my
enjoyment of wine, I chose to take

This column is

terribly

chal-

lenging to write. It's my last of the
semester and, what with my brutal
rejection from Lonely Planet
(What gives? Don't they think I'm

qualified to write about Eastern
Europe after living there for four
and a half months in conjunction
with a study abroad program? Do
they not think I've published
enough already? I wrote for the
Swarthmore College Phoenix! For
an entire semester! I demand to be
reconsidered), this might be the
last ever. EVER.
Actually, this close to the end of
school it's hard not to think of
everything in Apocalyptic terms.
I'm graduating in five weeks and
my future is one mega neon question mark with a cherry on top. I
had one job interview and was subsequently rejected. This made me

understand why thirty three point
three three repeating percent of
my friends are charging directly to
grad school without passing Go or
collecting two hundred dollars. At
this point, academia is about the
only thing I feel qualified for, professional Snood and/or math trivia
excluded. Not that a travel column
is an appropriate place to vent my
anxiety, but since I'm not trying to
impress anyone anymore (damn
you, Lonely Planet! I don't even

use your lame-o travel guides!)

(This is like being the bitter,
spurned ex except worse, because I
don't have their address so I can't
do late-night drive-bys), I figured I
might as well go ahead and share.
Leaving Hungary felt similarly
Apocalyptic, if not to quite the
same degree (one point to me for a
tenuous segue). It was at least
three weeks of worrying whether
or not each late-night bus ride or
gyro would be my last, three weeks
where I couldn't have any real fun
because I had to spend all my time
doing all the things that I was pretty sure I couldn't live without once
I left the country and even the
times when I was supposed to be
having fun, I was never sure I was
having as much fun as I should be
having.

Prague or some other far-off outpost

She was largely self-sufficient,
which was good because, for the
record, I am a terrible host (I am

Like most of Hungary's other
excitements, Eger is not nearly so
nice in winter as it is in late
August. Nonetheless, we soldiered
on: first to a tacky restaurant decorated entirely with taxadermied
animals (my personal favorite
being a hare standing upright,
dressed like a leprechaun and
bearing a shotgun), where we ate
scrumptious game. I hope our dinners were not part of the decor, but
I can't be sure. Next we proceeded
on to the Valley of Beautiful

Women.
We really had every intention
of moving from the Valley to the

center of town in an hour or two,
and we were on-track until we
made the mistake of bypassing the

more commercial and impersonal
wine cellars for one that was literally a hole in the wall with an open
door. It had all the markers of gritty authenticity: damp, moldy
walls, no decoration to speak of
apart from the casks themselves
and no customers other than a

handful of middle-aged
men.

Making an executive
decision that was in
no way colored by my
enjoyment of wine, I
chose to [go] to Eger.
To make a long story short,
what was originally a 20-minute
visit stretched into four or five
hours of extended conversations
consisting of two-syllable words
and mime and countless glasses of

wine pipetted directly out of a
cask. I learned how wine is made
and I sampled raw horse radish

from the pile of root vegetables
conveniently stacked next to some
casks. You never know when you'll
be hungry, I guess. At the end of
the evening, one of the two gentlemen still left offered us a ride back
to the station so that we might
catch the last train back to
Budapest. I remember him slowly
meandering through the suburbs
that night, giggling at me and apologizing with the explanation,
"Kicsit alcohol." Driving in a car
with anybody after four months of
public transportation was surreal,
but even more than that was the
sense that I had come back to
where I had started from.
Goodnight, Hungary.

Getting under a 'Second Skin'
BY ALEX HO

finds online role-playing to be a means of expres-

To put today's world of mass entertainment
into perspective, here are some numbers: The
world's fastest selling computer game, "Burning
Crusade," an expansion pack to "World of
Warcraft" made $9B million dollars in its first
day, while the biggest one-day gross for a film was
$6O million dollars.
These statistics .provided by the documentary
"Second Skin," which the Film and Media Studies
Department screened on Wednesday April 16th,

ultimately seems to be outweighed by the bad.
The antisocial behavior of gamers is on full display, even if the filmmakers are unwilling to note
it. We meet the pregnant wife of a hardcore gamer
in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who jokes about becoming a "gamer widow."
Far more harrowing is the story of Dan
Brunkard, whose gaming habits drive him to con-

ahol@swarthmore.edu

give a sense of the truly phenomenal enormity of
these games (clumsily termed massively multiplayer online role playing games or MMORPGs).
The documentary, which was co-written by alum-

nus Victor Pineiro 'OO, follows the lives of several
gamers, painting an ambivalent picture of avatar
culture.

Much of the film's intent is to show how online
role-playing has enhanced the lives of many and
is a complex culture to be appreciated. We meet

countless gamers from all walks of life, all of
whom have
a common enthusiasm for
MMORPGs. "We ended up feeling really overwhelmingly positive about the whole thing,"
Pineiro said in a phone interview.
Pineiro takes care to note that although the
movie does focus on one "severely addicted"
gamer, "the truth is, for those one or two addicted stories that we found, we found hundreds of
other stories where the games were used to really
let people communicate and meet hundreds of
people whom they wouldn't have met otherwise."

The film also notes how creating an avatar is a
means of escape for many in dead-end jobs. It's
only telling that, as the film states, 45 percent of
online gamers are between the age of 23 and 35.
Still, the joy that online gaming brings to the
subjects of the documentary is more explicitly
stated than felt, as the film all too airily breezes
through the talking points of how gaming allows
everyday people to transcend their socioeconomic settings. The documentary also unfortunately
spends only a brief time with one of its subjects,
Andrew, who is disabled and cannot speak, and
April 24, 2008

sion.
What the film finds to be good about gaming

template suicide. More joyous than any other
story in the documentary is how Brunkard overcomes his gaming addiction and takes control of

his life with a newfound conviction.
While "Second Skin" apes an endorsement of
online gaming, it's much more successful and fascinating as an intimate look at the psychology of

online role-playing.
When the film uses scenes from computer
games, they are less effective in communicating
the thrill of gaming than they are in communicating how addictive gaming can be. When
Brunkard describes how his gaming habits led to
hallucinations, the film hauntingly shows a regular walkway in a park transform into a computer
game.

Equally interesting is how online gaming
brings about serious relationships. The film
skims through a montage of multitudes of couples, who met through online RPGs. We intimately get to know a new couple, Kevin and Heather,
and the oddity of beginning a relationship with
someone whom you've never met in person.
Another fascinating anecdote that gets too little screen time is the story of a company in China
that "farms gold" to assist American players in
online games, giving a sense of what a lucrative
market online gaming is.
"Second Skin" is a one-of-a-kind look at online
gaming culture, especially for someone completely alien to it. It is a testament to the filmmakers'
exhaustive research that we are exposed to so
many facets of MMORPGs in such a short period
of time. But, after having watched the documentary, I'm afraid you won't catch me anywhere

near World of Warcraft.

I turned in a sample column, which has thankfully never
been published, whose thesis was, to quote, "If someone

of Ben Bradlow (hey, did you know he was Jewish? How
could he never have mentioned this before?), worthier
candidates were denied the lucrative job opportunity and
the only entry in the "Activities" section of my resume
began.
In seriousness, from my first column on Paces (which
stands up surprisingly well despite the fact that it's a Bill

Honestly, we've been at this school for about twenty
percent of our lives and it's hard to try to sum it up in any
meaningful way, so lets suffice to say that the generous
editors of the Living section who have somehow had to
deal with 24 desperate extension requests (including this
one!), the staff at large, Meghan Downie's artwork, all the
emails and those wonderful moments when someone
introduces themselves to me, says I love your column and
then watches as I try to hide my newly massive ego have

Dan Deacon and Videohippos transform Olde Club into Wham City
BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS
azalokol@swarthmore.edu

This is what ultimate reality feels like:
synthesized crescendos of childhood noise,
pixie stick sugar highs, strangers' sweat,
rubber cheese pizza, neon clothes, exclamation marks, Saturday morning cartoon
music, newly bruised knees and stepped on
feet, looped distortion and birthday party
dance games. Bringing kiddie overstimulation to Olde Club last Friday night, Dan
Deacon and fellow Wham City collective
band Videohippos gave a performance that
transcended expectations and stood out as
the best yet this semester.
Descending the stairs of Olde Club before
Videohippos opened up the show, I barely
recognized anyone in the basement
no
usual crowd by the couch, no circle of people
in the corner, just one single group of freshman lurking at the bottom of the staircase

and a few familiar faces darting past, but
mostly lots of tightly pants-ed, American
Apparel-clad Haverford kids. That was the
first sign that this show was going to be a bit
different than the rest. The second came
when I went back upstairs to see
Videohippos play only to find a room full of
people excitedly murmuring, impatiently
waiting to see an opening band who was set

in front of the stage, with a
white sheet draped behind their set up.
Who would have guessed that those people were waiting up there with good reason?
(I would have
oh wait, I did, actually).
Playing for an already filled Olde Club,
Videohippos pounded out electro-dance toylike synfh as technicolor videos criticizing

modern-day media-saturated society were
projected behind them. The combination of
pop art video projections, hypnotic beats

My

series
whose
fourth season is

on the SciFi

I
have never, in
Pencils Down, Pass the Remote fact, seen a single episode. The
only thing that I
know about the show is that it is set in space and the characters say "frak" instead of "fuck." Therefore, I will not be
writing about the show, no matter how much Annie wants
me to.
Or maybe I will. Annie's wish for me to write about "a
show that I've [meaning Annie] actually seen" got me thinking about the nature of cult TV. Why is it that some shows
attract a rabid following (sometimes of just a few thousand
people, sometimes of millions) who not only tune in every
week but analyze every episode on message boards, pepper
their everyday speech with references to their show of

choice, attend conventions and write endless fan fiction,
while other shows are only stopped at because there's nothing else on or simply passed over altogether?
I've already shared my near-religious obsession with a
certain complex, confusing show set on a tropical island in a

and will now turn to the cult favorites who
count amongst their foliowings some ofmy nearest and dearest. I've already mentioned Battlestar Galactica, a show that
commands an impressive cult following, particularly considering that it's on a channel that nobody watches and often
has year-long breaks between seasons. Another of my
friends (who shall remain nameless, because
the nature of what I'm about to divulge
is so shameful) refuses to answer
his phone Monday nights because
he's watching Heroes, that infeprevious column,

Cult favorite shows, however, do not always contain complex mythological elements. Another of my friends owns the
entire series of Judd Apatow's series Freaks and Geeks on

watch these DVDs the moment she meets you. In fact, I'm
pretty sure that she carries them around with her wherever she goes on the off-chance that someone unwittingly agrees to view an episode or two.) The
show speaks to her and the other loyal fans out
there because, as I conjecture, it portrays
the high school experience in a way that is

awkward and painful enough to ring true

Vocalists Arcuni and Clapp collaborate in Junior Recital
BY ANAGHA KRISHNAN
akrishnl@swarthmore.edu
Last semester, Cara Arcuni 'O9 and

'O9 contemplated the possibility of doing a Junior Recital together.
Henry Clapp

Both alums of the Florence Voice Seminar
and recipients of the Garrigues Music
Scholarship, Arcuni and Clapp felt that it
was time to showcase the vocal progress
they had made.
"We decided last semester that we were
at that point, as singers who could perform at a high level. The summer at
Florence really taught us to perform, and
it was great to have something to work
towards," Clapp said.
They also received

encouragement

from their instructors, Julian Rodescu
and Debra Scurto-Davis. The rehearsal
was part of Arcuni and Clapp's work for
Music 48, through which they also
received vocal coaching from ScurtoDavis, who served as their accompanist.
As the pair began to prepare for their
recital, they underwent extensive training
in vocal production, diction and interpretation from Rodescu and Scurto-Davis.
The pair had private as well as dual coaching sessions and practiced independently
for several hours a week. As the recital
neared, they each upped their practice
times dramatically.
"I went from practicing an hour a day
to 2 to 3 hours a day," Arcuni said, "Let's
just say that during the weeks leading up
to our recital, the time I spent practicing
did not balance with the time I spent on
academics."
Clapp also had to forgo a few rehearsals
with his a capella group, Sixteen Feet,
who, he states, were very understanding
about his new time constraints. Apart
from their own bodies of work, Arcuni
THE PHOENIX

and Clapp also decided to perform two
duets from "Don Giovanni" and "Annie
Get Your Gun." Between academics and
other activities, scheduling practice sessions for their duets was challenging.
"There was a time that we had to meet
at like, 11 p.m. on a Saturday night. But of
course, it was for the sake of art..." Clapp
said.
Arcuni and Clapp compiled a wide-

ranging repertoire between them, from
Italian arias to German pieces, Emily

Dickinson, Sherlock Holmes and even
some musical theater.
Having worked on certain Bellini songs
during her tenure at Florence, Arcuni
decided to expand upon that body of work.
During her research, she also came across
Aaron Copland's work with Emily

which

he felt were a

lot of fun.

"Interacting with someone on stage is a
great fun. Cara is a great singer and a
great actress and it was good to work on
the whole acting side of things," Clapp

said.
"Arias test vocal capability, but duets
test full operatic ability. You have to blend
with the [co-performer] and you have to
act with that person. It's a perfect blend of
acting and singing, and to be able to deliver both is really important," Arcuni said.
For Arcuni, this distinction between
singing and acting was also part of the
challenge. "I had been trained in the musical theater technique, which was very different from the classical one. I had to un-

taken in high school. He picked a piece by
Robert Schumann, whose works he had
enjoyed and performed previously. The
other songs in Clapp's repertoire were recommendations from his various instruc-

learn some stuff," Arcuni said.
Arcuni added that, because she had
been performing musical theater since she
was eight years old, focusing exclusively
on music without the acting was a unique
experience. This was also why she enjoyed
the duets which incorporated acting into
the performance, for instance, in
"Anything you can do, I can do better,"
where she played a feisty woman.
Clapp felt that the sheer volume of
work they had to perform was a challenge.
Not only did they have to memorize the
various pieces, but they had to work up
the stamina to sing all the songs at once.

tors.

Arcuni's personal favorite was the
Emily Dickinson poem "I felt a funeral in
my brain." "It was spooky and a good rep-

resentation of her poetry. Also, the instrumentation was really dissonant and
great," Arcuni said.
Clapp enjoyed all his pieces equally,

Dickinson's poetry. On deciding to perform the three Copland-Dickinson pieces,
"I felt a funeral in my brain," "Heart, we
will forget him" and "Why do they shut
me out of heaven," Arcuni said, "Emily
Dickinson is a love-hate poetess. I personally love her poetry. The combination of
her poetry and Copland being a musical

genius was why it was a good idea."
Clapp, on the other hand, was more

Neither had performed in an individual
recital previously, and this resulted in
some nervousness.
The week before the performance was
also not without its surprises. For Arcuni,
this meant the cancellation of one of her
songs. The piece was not coming together
technically, so it was replaced with
Puccini's "O mio babbino caro," which
was perfectly within Arcuni's range. It
was a song from a daughter to her father.
I sang it to my dad, who was in the
audience. Although I didn't tell him it was
for him, he definitelyknew," Arcuni said,
laughing. "He came up to me after the performance and said 'Thanks, Cara' and
then my mom teased me about not saying

As the recital neared, the two focused
on preparing themselves mentally as well
as physically.

"I actually fasted for months, so that I
could look good in my suit," Clapp joked.
All the sacrifices paid off however, as
Arcuni and Clapp shone in their performances and were met with enthusiastic
applause. They reflected on the whole
experience with a mixture of content and
relief.
"It was awesome. Performing is such a
rush, and a lot of my friends were in the
audience. It was a great opportunity to
show them how much I had accomplished," Clapp said.
Arcuni described the entire experience
as "Exhilarating. There's nothing quite
like a performance for me. Getting feedback from an audience is like a healthy
drug! Although it is kind of habit forming," Arcuni said.
"Awesome" and "exhilarating" are the
perfect words to describe the entire
recital, in which Arcuni and Clapp showcased their musical talents magnificently.

BEN VAN ZEE

The Price of Ignorance
I've been writing this column on conspiracy theories all semester and have
had excellent results. The conspiracies
I've addressed have ranged from the

9/11

conspiracy to theories that were rejected
from publication because they "seemed
too unrealistic." You might be wondering
what prompted me to write this column
and or why anyone should give a damn
about conspiracies in general.
I am a firm believer in not so much
conspiring, but what I like to call constructive skepticism. Skepticism is an
essential part of what makes us human

beings; by denying skeptical notions we
only set ourselves up to be deceived.
Some may argue that in regard to government, society and religion, skepticism
does more harm than good.
I personally would completely disagree with this statement, but I can
understand why people subscribe to it.
Some people would just prefer to turn a
blind eye than to have to deal with the
truth. And why do people prefer to
believe than doubt? I would say largely
because it is more comfortable to believe
one knows the Truth than to consider the
possibility that what we think the Truth
is is really fallacious.
Skepticism is really considering the
possibility that we don't really know, or

THE PHOENIX

possibility that we aren't? And that is
really why I wanted to write this column.
I wanted to turn people on to the world of
conspiracies. But even the world of conspiracy theories can be dangerous.
Conspiracy theorists are almost always
declared "crazy" by the mainstream
media and political figures, and in some
cases they should be.
The major problem with conspiracy
theories today is that the illegitimate,
unfounded conspiracies have perverted
society's opinion of conspiracies so much
that real conspiracy theories are grouped
and dismissed with the illegitimate ones.
So why should you pay heed to a conspiracy when it may be bogus?
It is true that many conspiracy theories are indeed bogus, but what about the
ones that are not? Conspiracy theories
should be read as conspiracy theories,
meaning that the reader should keep an
open mind and logically analyze the idea
until they have either sufficiently decided
that it is cannot be true, or is probably
true, or that they cannot be sure that it
isn't true. Then one must accept the possibility that it could be true.
But what good could come out of this?
The Truth. And not only the Truth, but
consider this: What if the events that took
place on 9/11 really didn't happen the way
we've been told they happened? What if
our doubts led us to further investigation
that revealed what did really happen?
Justice could be sought.
But whether you choose to subscribe
to conspiracy theories or you choose to
send me more hate mail, the next time
you're confronted with a conspiracy theory, don't jump to any conclusions, take a
moment and think, "I suppose that could
be a possibility." And my mission will be
accomplished.
Thank you all for reading my conspiracy column and be thinking of me in
seven years when I won't be able to get a
job.

The recent official report released by
the Venezuelan Scientific Police indicates
14 percent
a
P|Tjn|» increase in the number of

IhIIhJI

homicides
reported
(emphasis on the word
"reported") in Caracas during the first

three months of this year. The households that bear the emotional weight of
this depressing reality reside in the vast
and impenetrable barriadas, or shantytowns, that surround the nation's capital.
The months of January, February and
March in the year 2007 left a balance of
621 homicides. This year's somber figures
show an additional 89 homicides, bringing the total to 710. In other words, on
average, eight people are murdered per
day in Caracas alone. The numbers seem
to predict that a total of 2,920 Caraquenos
will perish at the hands of urban crime
by the end of this year. That is a little
more than 0.07 percent of the city's popu-

lation.
For perspective, if Americans died at
the hands of crime at this rate, it would
equal around 212,723 people per year.
According to the U.S. Census, the current
homicide rate in the United States is
about 0.000057.
In case these numbers are not alarming enough to the reader, perhaps the
horrific reality of Caracas' morgues will
put them into context. The Chavez
administration's pathetic management of
public hospitals and health centers in
general has lead, among other things, to
the collapse of the most important
morgues in the city. Vultures circle
relentlessly above the morgues, indisputably proving the extent of the
macabre situation that our country faces.
Anonymous sources from the morgue
have declared that, due to a dysfunctional ventilation system, the stench of
decomposing bodies that filters into the
pipelines of neighboring buildings and
houses have attracted the scavenging
birds.

April 24, 2008

As Maria Isoliett Iglesias reports in El
Universal, there have been days where
up to 84 cadavers reside in the 14 functioning freezers of the morgue in Bello
Monte. Each freezer is designed to hold
up to two corpses. In the past months the
vehicles allocated to transporting cadavers have consistently broken down. Due
to a lack of resources, the forensic doctors have taken to repairing the vehicles
themselves, and employ a cargo truck to
transport bodies from the morgue to "La
Peste" in the southern cemetery. What
Caraquenos refer to as "La Peste" is nothing other than a mass grave.
Meanwhile, the headlines of the
national press proclaim the fact that
Venezuela is currently the number one
military spender in Latin America. As
Chavez prepares the country for a future,
hypothetical, and illusory invasion from
the "empire" (i.e. the USA), there is not a
single mention in his prophetic discourse
of the fact that Venezuelans are killing
each other at an unprecedented rate.
I have chosen to write about this horrific and depressing subject because this
type of information does not seem to
reach the international community. In

fact, it seldom reaches Venezuelans,

since politics and corruption scandals
take up the front pages of our newspapers. The socialist maxim that Chavez
utters at every public event, "jPatria,

Socialismo o Muerte!" (Motherland,
Socialism, or Death!) is, ironically,
extremely relevant to the subject at hand.
Whether by choice or not, Venezuelans
have apparently opted for the third
option.

When will we hear our president glorify life, democracy and freedom? When
will Chavez act as a humanitarianleader
without associating himself with a terrorist guerilla group in the jungles of
Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador? When
will he call for social reconciliation
between the politically polarized sectors
of our population? Too many questions of
this nature remain chronically unanswered. What a beautiful and glorious revolution is underway in the Motherland!

probably be mistaken for his dad.
Sure, we still have the George Clooney-Brad Pitt
alliance to meet nation-wide demand for urbane men to
fantasize about, but there is also an undeniable trend in
the opposite direction. You can see it with the popularity
of Seth Cohen, the video game-playing, self-conscious hottie of the now-defunct phenomenon, "The 0.C." Jim, hero
of "The Office," is cute, disheveled and goofy. There's also

Even some of our mainstream movie stars, like Tobey
Maguire, have an undeniable edge of awkwardness. Some,
like Hugh Grant, make a living by playing the same bumblingly awkward British guy over and over again. Why
has awkwardness in the male sex become so attractive?
I blame the creation of the Internet. Why? First,
because the Internet (and the entire complement of technology that has vastly increased the speed and volume of
communication and information exchange) has changed
what it takes to become successful in society. Second,
because, on a populational level, women invariably prefer
men who are successful in society. As a result of changes
brought on by the information age, awkwardness has
become an honest indicator of future success, and that is
why it has become a popular characteristic in men.

Sure, we still have the George
Clooney-Brad Pitt alliance to meet
nationwide demand for urbane men
to fantasize about, but there is also
an undeniable trend in the opposite
direction.
In the past, businesses typically achieved power
through increases in size. But the internet has made it
possible to move away from the "big, structured, does
everything in one place and under its own roof model
(that's the technical term, by the way) to a model that
instead emphasizes intelligence, innovation and quickness to adapt and change. The Internet has lowered transaction costs so that it makes sense to have a smaller company that doesn't do much of what it produces, but instead
interacts with the rest of the world to create value.

Necessarily, the primary characteristics of successful
business people have changed from someone who thrives
in a company characterized by hierarchy, structure and
power through size to someone who thrives in a company
built on the ability to be emergently creative and original,
a firm that can dart to the front and stay there through
sheer brainpower. I'm not saying that there aren't successful big companies (very demonstratably untrue), but
that the approach has changed, even for those large firms.
The key driver for most businesses is now not size, but
innovation. And to be innovative, I argue, requires a certain goofiness to your personality, something that lets you
think outside the box and be original. And that trait, that
weirdness, can often manifest itself as awkwardness in
everyday life.
Innovation also goes hand-in-hand with increased education as a sought-after characteristic. Education has
become increasingly important as America becomes more
of a service economy and it becomes harder to make a liv-

ing without a college education. Of course, those who
excel in an academic environment are often nerdy and by
extension, awkward.
So now we have two drivers: the increased selective
pressure for innovative people and the increased selective
pressure for people who can excel in academic environments. Both of those characteristics have a tendency to be
associated with awkwardness. Look at Bill Gates, the
model businessman and philanthropist of our era. Huge
geek. Quite awkward.
So, accordingly, women's tastes have shifted to make
room for this group of nerdy, innovative elites. Happiness,
true love and all that stuff aside, women are attracted to
characteristics in men that will lead to the best conditions
for themselves and their offspring, be it good genes, financial stability or high status in society. Awkward is in for
a reason, and that reason is the information age.

African Union fails in response to Zimbabwe
In recent weeks, The Phoenix, like many other publications and, most notably, the American government,
has been silent on the subject of the saga of Zimbabwe's
elections. The reasons have been myriad: African leaders, such as South African president Thabo Mbeki have
demanded African autonomy in dealing with Zimbabwe;
the legal process in Zimbabwe seemed to be resolving the
issue on its own; and most crucially, not enough was

known about what was actually happening in Zimbabwe
to form an educated position on the issue. In light of
post-electoral violence on the part of the ruling Zanu-PF
party (led by catastrophic president Robert Mugabe), and
particularly with the looming threat of a massive sale of
arms to Zimbabwe by the Chinese government, the time
to end that silence has come.
Most immediately, the United States needs to take an
active role in addressing what is arguably the most
pressing issue to security in southern Africa: the
impending sale of Chinese weapons to the Zanu-PF-led
government of Zimbabwe.
Carrying three million
rounds of live ammunition, 1,500 rocket-propelled
grenades and 2,500 mortar rounds, the contents of the
ship An Yue Jiang are an arsenal for what Zimbabwean
church leaders have called "a potential genocide similar
to that experienced in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and elsewhere." With the State Department offering nothing
more than "discouragement" in regards to the Chinese
sale of arms, a crisis of massive proportions is idling off
the coast of South Africa, waiting to dock. While the

Zanu-PF-affiliated Zimbabwe justice minister Patrick
Chinamasa claims that he doesn't "understand all this
hullabaloo about a lone ship," Genocide Watch, Amnesty
International and opposition party leaders in Zimbabwe
are unanimous in their disagreement. The behavior of

the Chinese government is reckless and immoral, but the
United States' failure to condemn their actions has made
a bad situation even worse.
Second, the world needs to accept that the reality that
allowing the African Union and Mr. Mbeki to handle this
issue independently has failed. No one can deny that
centuries of European imperial domination of Africa has
been unimaginably detrimental. None but the most bel>

Union is unable to create it autonomously.

stance should the ideal of democratic autonomy take
precedence over the fundamental sanctity of human life.
The problem in Zimbabwe is that the de facto African
Union delegate supervising the country's elections,
Thabo Mbeki, is deluded about the actual state of affairs
in the region. After meeting with Robert Mugabe last
Saturday, he remarked that there is "no crisis" in
Zimbabwe. With unconfirmed reports of 3,000 individuals displaced, 500 injured and at least 10 dead as a result
of post-election violence, there is little room for international disagreement: Mr. Mbeki is flat-out wrong.
What, then, is the solution? First, the call of
Zimbabwean opposition party leader Morgan Tsvangirai
for Mr. Mbeki to be "relieved of his duties" as mediator
needs to be heeded. In his stead, Zambian president Levy
Mwanawasa should be appointed by the AU to oversee
the contentious recount currently taking place.
Second, the "orgy of violence" which human rights
groups claim has been unleashed by Mr. Mugabe and his
political party needs to be stemmed by any means possible. In the short term, the United States needs to lead the
charge in the United Nations to send peacekeeping

The European rape of Africa was
unequivocally wrong. But under no
circumstance should the ideal of
democratic autonomy take precedence over the fundamental sanctity
of human life.
Mr. Tsvangirai, ostensibly the Zimbabwean presidentelect (but denied this title by the autocratic Mugabe), has
demanded a United Nations crimes court, similar to

those in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of
Congo. The world cannot let Mr. Tsvangirai's requests
fall on deaf ears. The time of Western domination in
Africa is over. But so, too, is the time for Western apathy.

The Garnet women also had a strong field
contingent, with Nathalie De Gaiffier 'O9 competing in both the long and triple jumps, setting
a PR distance of 8.71 meters in the latter. That
jump was good enough to land her a spot at the
Centennial Conference Championships.
Heather Hightower 'O9 also competed in
multiple events, throwing the discus 2L25
meters on Friday afternoon before rocketing
the shot 8.60 meters on Saturday.

As she approached the finish line en route to
personal record in the steeplechase, Rebecca

Woo 11 couldn't believe her eyes. Could it be, a
beautiful oasis spanning the horizon before
her?
Alright, so maybe it was just the water pit
and maybe the heat wasn't so bad that the
Garnet women suffered hallucinations at this
past weekend's Widener Invitational, but it was
pretty oppressive. Despite the sweltering temperatures, however, the ladies displayed some
impressive performances and even managed to
set a couple of personal records and season-best
times.
Action kicked off on Friday with the 5000
meters. Nyika Corbett 10 ran a strategically
sound race, pacing herself to a third-place finish in a time of 18:27.25. She was followed in by
Emma Stanley 'O9 (19:1173) and Faith Pampel
'O9 (19:57.52), with all three performances dipping under the Conference Championship standard of 20:48.47 Additionally, Bettina Tarn 10
made her season debut, pacing herself to a time
of 22:54.50.
The Garnet women were also well represented in the middle distance events. Lauren
Deluca 10 set her second consecutive PR (she
PR'd in the 800 last week), completing the 1500
meters in 5:04.73. In commenting on her progression, Deluca said, "I'm happy to be having

a good season. My teammates are inspiring me
with their balls-to-the-wallness. Everyone else
is going balls-to-the-wall why can't I? I'm just
so freaking excited!"
Deluca was joined by Melina Healey 'OB who
completed the race in 5:16.06. In the 800 meters,
Cait Mullarkey 'O9 set a season-best time of
2:17.37, good for a third-place finish (the race
was won by a former Canadian Olympian).
Cait Russell 11 also competed in the two-lapper,
finishing in 2:38.57. All four marks met the
respective Conference standards of 5:19.58 and
-

2:39.37.

As alluded to earlier, Woo made her steeplechase debut, clearing numerous barriers and
water pits on the way to her Conference qualifying performance of 12:58.49. The time also
lands her in third place on the Swarthmore alltime list.
In describing her first steeplechase, Woo
said, "I thought it was really exciting; I've
never run a race with barriers before.
Something about jumping over barriers just
makes you happy, at least for the first few laps.
It starts to get tiring though, accelerating into

"It was a hot day, so times weren't
the best, but the fiery passion of the
athletes rivaled the intensity of the
heat," said Andrew Vanßuren 10 of the
performances on the track at the
Widener Invite this past weekend.
The competition began on Friday
with a bit of distance and discus action.
Ross Weller 'OB led the 5k men with a
Conference qualifying time of 15:31
despite the dehydrating effects of the
high temperatures on the track. Fellow
seniors Jonathan Shoop and Mickey
Katz also ran a couple of beautiful
races, starting out conservatively and

winning the 5000 meters at the Connecticut
College Silfen Invitational. Ritter's time of
19:02.67 was a season-best performance and a
Conference qualifying mark by a wide margin.
The performance also marked Ritter's first collegiate win.
Perhaps just as exciting at the women's performances at the meet, however, is the anticipation that the team feels for the upcoming
Penn Relays. Mullarkey and men's team compatriot Ross Weller 'OB will both be representing Swat in the steeplechase on Thursday night
(Distance Night, which also happens to be free
to the public). Mullarkey and Weller both
missed NCAA provisional marks (11:13 and 9:23
respectively) by small margins in their last
steeple races, something they hope to rectify at
the elite meet.
As Coach Peter Carroll
explained, "It's not easy to find a deep, quality
steeple, and Penn allows for this."
Competing in the Penn Relays is also deeply
entrenched in the Swarthmore tradition in
fact, recent grad Paul Thibodeau 'O6 worked as

picking people off.

Throwers Neel Prakash .'O9, Nick
Willet-Jeffries 'lO and Tommy Huang
10 all threw both Friday and Saturday
and were joined by Jake Baskin 10 for
the shot put on Saturday.
Although they collectively voiced
disappointment in their weekend performances, many of which just missed
Conference qualifying standards, they
were also proud of their coach Tom
Reynolds. Reynolds posted top ten
marks in all of the throws events,
which include the discus, shot put,
javelin and hammer. Willet-Jefferies
explained that this coming weekend,
the last meet before conferences, is an

important one for the throwers. "TCNJ

is a big meet for us. Neel is on the verge
of qualifying in the javelin, and a bunch
of us are right near the line in various
events," he said.
Tramane Hall 11 made his season
debut in the long jump, posting a distance of 5.52m. Field Athletes Brendan
McVeigh 11 and Huang both no heighted in the pole vault. As first-year
McVeigh described college competi-

peted in the 10,000meters last year.
Additionally, the Relay Carnival is organized by Swat grad and McCabe Mile (won over
Ride-the-Tide by Woo for the women and
Mickey Katz 'OB for the men) founder Dave

Johnson '73. Coach Carroll elaborated on the
role of Penn Relays in the Swarthmore season,
as he stated, "There isn't another meet in the
country that has the tradition Penn does. It's
been hosted 115 years consecutively now. The
fact that we represent every year is important
to the program; it helps our recruiting and it
gives us profile. It's just good to be part of it
year after year."
The Garnet will next be in action on
Thursday, April 24 at the Penn Relays and on
Saturday, April 26 at the College of New Jersey
Lions Invitational.

tion: "It's challenging trying to adjust
to this level of vaulting it's like being
a high school freshman all over again.
I'm looking forward to improving over
the next couple of years."
On the track Yongjun Heo 'O9 and
Hall rocked it in the sprints. Dan Kurz
11 posted a season best of 54.05 in the
400 while teammate Chris MayerBacon 11 dropped a 57.85. Having
already qualified for Conferences in the
800, Kurz said that at this point in the

ing running."
The 800 was a particularly exciting
event this past weekend, as it marked
the season debut of Jaymes Fairfax-

Columbo 'lO on the track, Connor

Darby's first 800 of the season, as well
as a stunning performance by
Vanßuren.
After the race FairfaxColumbo discussed his feelings, saying,
"Although I was disappointed with the
result, it was good to race again. All in
all the boys did really well this weekend. Vanßuren had a heart breaker
missing the conference qualifier by .01,
but I have full confidence that he'll get
it this coming weekend."
Vanßuren also shared his thoughts
after the 800, saying that, "Darby had a
solid race. I was pretty upset that he
didn't throw up some number l's when
he finished, but he was pretty tired."
Continuing with season bests, Alex
Breslow 11 dropped his 1500 time to 4:44
this past Saturday. Rounding out the

individual races was Mayer-Bacon's
1:03 in the 400 hurdles. The Swat men
also competed in both the 4xloo and
4x4oometer relays, posting times of 48.2

and 3:40 respectively.
Tonight, Weller will be competing in
the steeplechase at the prestigious
Perm Relays. The team is ecstatic to
cheer their leader on as he braveq the
barriers, water pits and fatigue for the
ultimate glory of surviving and dominating the steeplechase. "I've been
training all season, working on my
cheering skills, in order to cheer on
Ross at the Penn Relays," says teammate Katz.
Dan Hodson added, "Although I
enjoy watching Ross and his silkysmooth six pack abs run, if you sit by
the water pit during a steeple chase, it's
almost as if he's flying, and I'm very
excited to see that this Thursday at
Penn."
While Weller gives it his all at Penn,
the rest of the Swarthmore men's track
team will be preparing for their final
pre-Conference track meet of the season, the Lion's Invite which will be held
at TCNJ this Saturday.

m^mmm^mmmmm^^^^^mm financial trouble I ask
myself, how did they do
it? What can a person
whose annual salary could give me the high life at
Swarthmore for years possibly waste that kind of dough on?
If there has ever been an athlete to fritter away a fortune,
it is Mike Tyson. Tyson was once the most prolific boxer in
the world and still remains the youngest person to ever win
a heavyweight title. Now, however, Tyson is involved in
THE PHOENIX

numerous rehab programs and has been arrested twice in
the last two years for DUIs and felony drug possession.
To put it bluntly, Tyson has fallen from the top. Over the
course of his boxing career Tyson amassed a net worth of
about $3OO million, and reportedly was even paid a purse of
$3O million dollars for a number of his professional bouts
alone. Yet, in August of 2003 Tyson filed for bankruptcy,
essentially making public the fact that his not-so-small-fortune had evaporated. In all honesty, if I had that kind of
money the first thing I would do would be skeet-shooting
iPhones out of the back of a Ferrari driven by a white Bengal
tiger while wearing a coat with a diamond mosaic of myself
high-fiving Hulk Hogan.
Tyson may not have done what I would have, nor did he
have his face carved into Mount Rushmore, Maori tattoo
and all, but he did manage to lose his money. At the time of
his bankruptcy, Tyson was in debt for $27 million, probably
enough money to build a workingreplica of Space Mountain
in his back yard. Speaking ofhis house that is, the one in
Farmington, Connecticut it was bought by superstar rapper 50 Cent. The less-than-incognito house apparently has
over 50 rooms and includes a movie theater and one Jacuzzi
for every finger on your hand. Doesn't really sound like a
bad place to live in my opinion.

Certainly Tyson didn't have anyone around him that
advised him in sensible ways to use his money, and he was
unfortunately surrounded by a large group of gold-diggers
who attempted to leech his fortune in any way possible.
That is not to say that Tyson did not actively pursue
poverty. One time while in Las Vegas, Tyson dropped over
200K on a gold and diamondrope, no doubt to accompany the
L 6 million bone watch and bracelet studded with more girls'
best friends than a Facebook profile.
Money does funny things to people, that's no secret. As
easy as it is to say that if any average person were lavished
with inappropriate amounts of money they would respect it,
in reality who knows if that's the truth? Apparently Latrell
Sprewell needs more than a 3 year, $2l million contract
extension to "feed his family;" that must be some family. It
looks like his family was indeed that hard to feed considering last year his yacht was repossessed by the government
because of about $l4 million he owed.
Seems like it's not easy financially being a pro athlete
these days. Who would have thought that the mighty superstars that pretty much make our world go round have trouble paying their bills? I guess it is true, stars are just like us!

Women's Rugby in midst of successful spring season
BY MELINDA PETRE
mpetrel@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore women's rugby is in the midst of another
high-energy and fulfilling season this spring. The team
began its second season of the year on a high note with an
impromptu scrimmage against the Bryn Mawr-Haverford
team, followed shortly by another against the Unionville
High School team in March. While the latter was a great
■* practice game (and victory) for Swat,
it was a learning
experience for the high school team. The game served to
"show [the young players] what college rugby was all
about and sort of encourage them to continue playing,"
Co-Captain Karen Minyety 'OB said.
In another unorthodox scrimmage, Swat continued
their preseason by teaming up with Lebanon Valley
College to scrimmage against the Harrisburg Harlots, a
women's club team from Harrisburg, Pa. "This was a 'fun
match' where we mixed things up and learned a lot from
them," Lauren Kluz-Wisniewski 'OB said.
__■

The games kicked off with a tri-match

against
Muhlenberg College and Lehigh University, where Swat

handily defeated the Mules yet lost a close contest to
Lehigh. "Lehigh was a tough loss, because we were pretty evenly matched although in my opinion, we were the
better team.
Unfortunately, we had already played
Muhlenberg so our fatigue from the first game came
through in the second game. Regardless of this, we
worked well as a team, there was lots of communication
on the field, we were rucking well, winning our lineouts
and contesting the scrums. I couldn't ask more of our
team," Minyety said.
Rugby has been fortunate this spring because, as it is
the team's non-league season, it has a considerable
amount of flexibility in choosing the teams it plays. As a
result, they were able to take on Rutgers University, a
Division I team, fresh off its victory over Princeton
University, a former Division I Champion.
Although this was a loss for the Garnet, the team took
pride in their performance: "The best moment of this
~

season [so far] was playing Rutgers. We played a great
game against a really tough team and the girls really
stepped it up and gave it their all," Co-Captain Maria
Mello 'OB said.
"We had to step up our level of play to fend them off
and that was why it was challenging, but also the best
rugby we played," she added.

"I had a fantastic four years with
my rugby team and I have enjoyed
every moment with them
and I love them dearly."
Maria Mello 'OB
"It wasn't an even match, but we played the best we've
played all season," Minyety said.
To Kluz-Wisniewski, another memorable moment of
the season occurred when senior Co-Captain Karen
Minyety got sent off the field with a yellow card. "She's
one of the most mild-mannered people I know, but she
looked ready to kill the referee," she explained.
This past Saturday, Swat took on Millersville
University. While it was a close contest, Swat suffered
from injuries sustained during the game. "We were down
on their try line for most of the second half, really dominating them in scrums, but we just weren't able to capitalize on field possession," Kluz-Wisniewski said.
Rugby has called on their rookies often this season.
"In other years, we've had A side games and B side games
where rookies play the latter to get more acquainted with
the game but our rookies, whether they realize or not,
have held their own against people who have played for
three or four years," Minyety said.
"The rookies have been amazing this whole year. All
of them have really improved and added a lot to the team.

I hope they continue to play rugby because they really
have added a new dynamic to the team," Mello added.
"They take instructions really well, and are always
looking to learn more and improve more," KluzWisniewski said.
Women's rugby faces Ursinus College this weekend for
their traditional "Prom Dress" Rugby game. Instead of
the traditional uniform, the teams will sport former prom
dresses acquired from thrift stores. "We've cultivated a
friendship with Ursinus and couldn't be more excited to
play prom dress rugby with them this weekend," Minyety

said.

Additionally, the alumni return on May 3 for what the
team expects to be a battle. "We always get crushed by
the alumni but it's always fun to see people who we've
played with suddenly become our opposition," Minyety

said.
"The alums that come back are the serious athletes,
the ones who still play on club teams," added KluzWisniewski.
Women's rugby will bid farewell to ten seniors this
year: Karen Minyety, Maria Mello, Lauren KluzWisniewski, Genna Robbins, Dahlia Perez, Anna Kastner,

Jessica Cunningham, Lauren Irizarry, Leah Handel and
Molly Piels. These seniors have contributed on and off
the field and will be greatly missed. "I had a fantastic
four years with my rugby team and I have enjoyed every
moment with them and I love them dearly. Even though

our season seems like it was bad because of all our loses,
we still played a good level of rugby and that makes me
proud of the team I am on," Mello said.
As for next year, "We're losing ten seniors this year,
which means we're going to have a very young team next
year, but we're excited for the challenge, and I'm confident that we can step up our game," Marina Isakowitz 'O9
said.
"There are some great juniors who are going to be
stepping into leadership positions, and hopefully we'll
have a good recruiting season, but it'll definitely be a
semester of building the team," Kluz-Wisniewski said.
