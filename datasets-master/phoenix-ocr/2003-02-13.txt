Why War? raises peace flag at half-staff
After American flag lowers in honor of Columbia deaths, students scale Parrish dome
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu
Early last Thursday morning, several
members of Why War? scaled the roof of
Parrish Hall and hung a peace flag under
the American flag flying at half-staff.
The college had lowered the American
in remembrance of the victims of the
Columbia shuttle disaster, but the student
anti-war organization Why War? had
placed the peace flag, which is still flying a
week later, for a different reason.
"The amount of unnecessary suffering
that that happens in the world on a daily
basis
is so enormous that it is hard for
us to talk about mourning Columbia without talking about the Iraqi kid buried
under a pile of rubble," said Why War?
member Mathew Louis-Rosenberg 'OS, who
did not mount the Parrish dome.
The college administration had lowered
the American flag following a request from
President Bush that institutions make a
national showing of remembrance for the
...

astronauts.
"We follow national guidelines, and
when an official decision is made to lower
the flag, we conform to it," Vice President
of College and Community Affairs Maurice
Eldridge '6l said.
Bush's request was in accordance with
the Federal Flag Code, which states, "By
order of the President, the flag shall be
flown at half-staff upon the death of principal
figures
of the
United
States
Government
as a mark of respect to
their memory." The flag code does not
allow lowering of the American flag for
reasons other than memorializing the
...

dead.

"I don't think it's appropriate," Dean of
the College Bob Gross '62 said of the peace
flag, which he had not yet seen. Individual
members of the college community have
the right to express their views on the war,
he explained, but a flag atop Parrish conveys a message about the entire institution, in which students, faculty and staff
have diverse political views.

Chalked statements accompanied the
peace flag. Messages such as "look up for

Peace" and "half mast for peace" scattered
on the walkways leading to Parrish. The
latter statement caused confusion for some
students, who said were not sure why the
American flag was at half-staff.
In an e-mail statement to The Phoenix,
Why War? made it clear that "half-mast for
peace" referred to the peace flag flying at
half-staff, not the lowered American flag.
"Our peace flag is at half-mast for the people of the northern and southern 'no-fly
zones' in Iraq who have been bombed once
every three days for the last four years,"
the group wrote.
Why War?'s intention, it said, was not
to draw attention from the commemoration of the shuttle disaster but rather to
encourage people to consider other suffering victims.
"While the shuttle explosion is certainly tragic, the loss is dwarfed by the pain
our government has inflicted on Iraq," the
statement said.

The anti-war group had raised the
peace flag in an effort to "reclaim" the
American flag as a symbol of patriotism, a
significance they believe it has lost in
recent years. "In the past year or so, the
American flag has increasingly become a
symbol, not of commitment to democracy
and love for the people of this country, but
rather commitment to the acts of the federal government and its apparent love of
war," the statement said.
The group was disappointed by the lack
of campus dialogue about the peace flag.

"It's just a function of Swarthmore. It's
hard to get people to care about anything
else than they already care about," LouisRosenberg said. "In some ways, it's showing us that it wasn't enough to force the

a lack of respect for the
lowered American flag. Andrew Robinson
'O6 thought the group's actions were
wrong, since the tradition of flying a flag
at half-staff is usually reserved for a
national tragedy or great loss of life. He
felt Why War? was making fun of a solemn
tradition of remembrance. "They have the
right to protest, but I think there could
have been a way to do it without offending
people," he said.

dialogue."

The individuals who hung the peace
flag insisted on remaining anonymous.
"We have chosen to act anonymously in
part because the purpose of the flag is not
to showcase our personal political views,
but rather to force discussion about the
impending war on Iraq and encourage
opposition to it," the statement released to
The Phoenix said.
Some students were upset by what they

But some were glad to see the peace flag
flying. Emily Wistar 'O6, an active member
of the Swarthmore Progressive Action
Committee (SPAC), said the campus
should not look on the action of Why War?
as vandalism or as a lack of respect for the
shuttle tragedy. She sees the whole issue

as quite simple.

"Flying next to the American flag is the
flag for peace. That's the way it should be,"
she said.

Committee selects DJ Shadow for large-scale event

announced on Friday, Feb. 7, that DJ Shadow
would be the large-scale event this year.
The committee chose DJ Shadow from two
proposals. G-Love and Special Sauce was also
up for consideration. DJ Shadow's music is categorized as trip-hop dance music.
Jeff Traczynski 'O4, Student Budget
Committee treasurer, said they had chosen DJ
Shadow because the act would be more costeffective than G-Love and Special Sauce.
With DJ Shadow, Traczynski said, the surplus funds would cover an opening act. The
organizers of Olde Club have also agreed to contribute funds for an opening act for DJ

Traczynski felt that having an opener would
make the performance "more of an event."
Matt Rubin 'O3, who was a part of the group
that developed the winning proposal, said that

"DJ Shadow is a very technically skilled
turn-tablist," Rubin said. "This event gives
interested students a chance to see a master."
In addition, Rubin described DJ Shadow as a
"fun and entertaining performer. He puts projection screens with animations in his perform-

ance."

DJ Shadow is an electronica and hip-hop
musician whose live performances focus mostly

on turn tabling. He has released eight CDs, most
recently "The Private Press" in 2002.

Traczynski was satisfied with the committee's choice but not with the overall process. He
said that next year there would be more of an
effort to involve students.
"We want to work on getting the requests for
submission out earlier," Traczynski said, "so
that we can have time to poll the students."
Traczynski described the two options the
committee is considering for next year. With
the first option, the committee would determine
which events were affordable and then allow
the students to vote. The proposal with the most
votes would be the large-scale event.
In the second option, the students would vote
after the committee had fielded the proposals.
The committee would take the students' preferences into account when choosing an event.
Traczynski stressed that occurrences such
as a change in performer's asking price, which
happened this year with the Flaming Lips,
made the latter option more favorable to the
committee.

Career services helps grad land job at ABC
BY GREG NELSON
gnelsonl@swarthmore.edu

"In a way, I think everybody
wants to be on TV," said Sig Rydquist
'OO, who now works as a production
associate for World News Tonight.
Not everyone gets there.
"I knew I wanted to do something
in television, but I thought that the
Planning

and

said. "They gave me some alumni
names, and that was about it."

They were, however, able to

Nightline, an ABC television news
program. He applied for the fellowship, interviewing with them six
times, but he was not accepted. He
was told that his application would
be "moved along" in the news divipoint

sion of the network.

When it became clear to Rydquist

that Nightline was not going to hire
him, he moved back home to

Cleveland after graduating and began
working at a financial company
where he had worked in the past.
From Cleveland, he began e-mailing people on the short list he had of
Swarthmore alumni who worked at
ABC. Eventually, one sent him back a
list of job openings. He continued calling ABC, requesting that his resume
be considered for these other openings. His persistence finally paid off,
and he was on an airplane to New
York City for yet another interview.
This time, he landed a job "pulling
phones," as he put it, as a desk assistant at ABC News.
Rydquist's ride to ABC was in a
way, similar to many who work there,

he said. "It seems like most people at
ABC got their jobs by knowing somebody. It's like a 'who's who' of Ivy
League schools," he said. "I don't

Eventually, he was promoted to

now. He helps organize the video that
comes in to ABC News, either from
their own production crews or from
footage purchased from other news
organizations. "When someone needs
a certain piece of footage for a story, I
find it," he explained.
Sometimes that footage has
national consequences. Rydquist catalogued ABC's exclusive footage of
pieces of the Columbia shuttle reentering the atmosphere that the network purchased from an amateur
camera man who happened to be filming the early morning sky in Arizona.

Francis said, is how many alumni in variety of professions end up making teaching or training others

"There's variation over time of what people want

have remained the career line of choice for a significant number of graduates over the years. In a 1995

Sig Rydquist is a production

Despite a less-than-booming economy, new
Director of Career Services Nancy Burkett said jobhunting seniors should not be too discouraged.
When she started working in career services in
the early 19905, "it was rough times then too," she
said. She emphasized the value of making professional connections with alumni and seeking out
mentors. "The main thing," she said, "is not to
panic and not to lose sight of the fact that there are
many employers and many options."
She said that from what she's seen so far, many
Swarthmore students follow unconventional paths
after graduation. That's no surprise to Burkett,
since she rarely comes across students who have
known exactly what they want to do since birth.
"Often, that's not the preferred way to approach a
career," she said.
Her own path has taken a few twists and turns.
After taking a survey in high school, Burkett "hit on
this attorney idea," and she began to pursue that
goal at the University of Tennessee. It didn't work
out. After graduation, she taught history at a community college, and then moved on to work in
human resources for a shipbuilding company in
Virginia. After spending time recruiting on various
campuses, she decided she wanted to be on the
other end of the process. "I started wising up to the
career development process a little late in the
game," she said.
So she began working for career centers at colleges, first at the College of William & Mary in
Virginia, then at Wagner College in New York, and
now, as of last Monday, at Swarthmore.

Most stereotypes about Swarthmore graduates
turn out to be true. An overwhelming number do go
on to grad school, though not immediately. Many end
up as academics or teachers, and a relatively small
number go on to careers in business or entrepreneurship. And in terms of the path most graduates
follow, "the unusual is common," said Tom Francis,

find out who the person is that's read-

ing it."
In the ABC newsroom, desk assistants are referred to as "gophers"
because they do whatever anyone
tells them to do, and they have to do it
as quickly as possible. Rydquist's
first assignment was the overnight
shift, answering the main ABC line
that is open to anyone who wants to
call and share a story idea they feel is
newsworthy.
"Let me tell you," he said, "you get
some crazy people calling on that
line. I think you can only get that
phone number if you're crazy. I think
these people call the operator, and the
operator asks if they've been drinking, and if they say 'Yes,' they connect
them and tell them to ask for Sig."
After five months he moved to a
desk assistant at World News Tonight
with Peter Jennings. "Then I was the
gopher for the big boys," he said.
The job offered him a chance to get
more involved with actual production of the show, and an important
opportunity to work normal daytime
hours. "The night shift was driving
me slowly insane," he said. But he

law school in this year's graduating class.
"There clearly is not as much interest in going
into business as at other places, as would be expected," Francis said, though that interest is "not as low
as people like to guess it is."
He thinks students' career decisions are partly
shaped by their time at Swarthmore and partly by
what sort of people they are to begin with.
Another steady trend is that most graduates go on
to pursue advanced degrees.
According to last year's senior survey, a full 90
percent of students intended to go on to graduate

school within five years. The trend over the past 30
years, Francis said, has been for fewer students to go
on to graduate school immediately. Since the late
19705, between 20 and 30 percent of students have
gone on to graduate school immediately following
graduation, according to the most recent alumni sur-

vey. Numbers from older classes
those who graduated in 1979 and 1984
show that many end up do
end up pursuing more education.
Francis said the alumni survey, which the college
conducts about every five years, is one of the better
summaries of how many graduates end up with
advanced degrees and what industries alumni end up

going into.

Francis said that while the survey numbers of
past alumni are interesting, they have no predictive
value.
The generalization he seemed most comfortable
making was that so many Swarthmore graduates
pursue such unexpected and interesting paths that

it's hard for him to remember which stand out. He's
seen "art history majors going on to med school," he
said, and "that's not unexpected."
Historically, Swarthmore has been one of the top
per capita producers of PhDs, Francis said, though he
added that is less likely to be the case now than several decades ago.
In his experience, the students who have the most
difficulty finding their way after graduation are
those who change their minds about what they want
to do with their life in their last year here, particularly those who decide they do not want to continue
in academia and need to prepare for an alternate

career quickly.
"I am certainly struck by the number of people
whose primary interest is in raising a family,"
Francis said. "It's lower than in the population as a
whole or in the college graduate population."

SBC takes over funding for CIVIC service groups
BY CYNTHIA WU

xwu2@swarthmore.edu

The Student Budget Committee's decision to take over funding for certain community service groups has forced the
Cooperative Involvement of Volunteers in
Communities, an umbrella organization
that used to control its own budget, to redefine its role in promoting service at
Swarthmore.
In a dinner meeting on Wednesday, Feb.
5, CIVIC interns, Student Budget Committee
members, students, administrators and the
staff of the Lang Center for Civic and Social
Responsibility discussed how to reinvent
CIVIC, a student-led organization financed
by the Student Activities Fund.
"Our ideal role is to help develop good
and help
leadership within the groups
build better communication between community groups and the student groups," said
Pat James, staff advisor for CIVIC and the
associate director for student programs and
training at the Lang center.
CIVIC's budgeting powers were revoked
...

when the SBC became concerned that some
funds were not directly benefiting the students. SBC regulations stipulate that the
community service budget must be used for
Swarthmore students because it comes from
the Student Activities Fund. Certain groups
were using funds to buy books and zoo
admission tickets for children. To better regulate expenses, SBC decided to take back

control of the financing.
According to James, CIVIC interns do
their best to comply with SBC regulations
and still fulfill the groups' needs. Still,
James said, it is hard to keep everyone

happy.
"Often, CIVIC has received the blame,"
James said, "but the interns are really
caught between a rock and a hard place
when groups come in and ask for funding to

buy books and supplies for children, for
example."

Many coordinators for the individual
CIVIC groups are upset about the restriction
on how to use funds, saying it hinders their
efforts. "Swarthmore has extraordinary
resources, but its duty is not only to serve
its students," said Khadijah White 'O4, a former coordinator of the Dare to Soar pro-

gram.
Matt Shiroma 'O5, a coordinator for
Chester Tutorial, blamed CIVIC for insufficient funding.
"We reach countless children who otherwise might not have the opportunities they
need to succeed. In order to do so, we need
certain funds for supplies, van rentals and,

ideally, semester trips for the children. Due
to the extreme disorganization of not only
CIVIC but its coordinators, we often were
forced to seek outside funding It is entirely possible that I don't understand the entire
happenings with CIVIC, but from what I
have seen and experienced, Chester
[Tutorial] functions in spite of them,"
...

feel that it is irresponsible to those who
spend many hours a week providing essential services to the neediest members of our
community," intern Kai Xu 'O3 said.
The transition offinances between CIVIC
and the SBC has been a smooth one, according to Xu. But it has caused glitches with
van rentals, which frustrated some groups.
"We understand that SBC has a number
of groups it is working with. Unfortunately,
our program is not one that we can simply
put on a hold for a while," said Shiroma,
who was unable to obtain vans this semes-

Shiroma said.
When CIVIC was created about 10 years
ago, it did not control the budgets of its
groups. The service group leaders who had
formed it applied for money from SBC individually. Six years later, SBC requested that
CIVIC groups apply for funds as a single

organization. The result was a new position,
the CIVIC intern, whose job was to organize
and distribute funds, according to James.
The interns acted as liaisons between the

ter.

"Swarthmore has

Since CIVIC will no longer handle transportation and budgeting, it will probably
take on a more advisory role. Chun Mei Lam
'O5, a CIVIC intern, said that now CIVIC
would be able to devote more attention to
strengthening service groups on campus.
"We wanted to help maintain community

but its duty is not only to
serve its students."

service groups and ensure their survival as
leadership changes hands each semester,"
Lam said. "Swarthmore always praises

service groups and SBC.
"At the beginning, the individual groups
really liked it, because coordinators didn't
have to worry about the budget. All they had
to do was turn in receipts," James said.
James said it was unlikely that SBC will
be more flexible or generous than CIVIC in
regulating how the funds are used. In fact,
SBC will no longer reimburse individual
volunteers who used to receive CIVIC
money for travel expenses.
"CIVIC will appeal this decision, as we

itself for being socially conscious and social-

ly active, but it actually isn't any more so
than our neighboring colleges. We just wanted to help change that. Maybe this is the
chance for us to do so."
"We're really just starting the conversation," James said. "Right now, things are not

Ring discussion focuses on affirmative action policy
BY JULIA POMPETTI
jpompetl@swarthmore.edu
Campus debate over affirmative action sparked by an
ongoing Supreme Court case continued at a panel discussion sponsored by The Ring in Mephistos last Thursday
night. About 80 students attended.
Panelist Chela Delgado 'O3 refuted what she considered
affirmative action myths, saying that "cultural exchange is
not what affirmative action is about," nor is it "about
admitting underqualified people."
Panelist Randy Goldstein 'O5 was of the opinion that
there is "no or little discrimination in college admissions
based on race."
In 1997, the Center for Individual Rights sued the
University of Michigan on behalf of two white students
denied admission to the liberal arts

program and filed a separate suit
on behalf of a white student who
was denied access to the law school.
This December, the Supreme Court
agreed to hear the case, re-entering
the debate on the constitutionality
of affirmative action in college
admissions for the first time since
1978.
The Ring discussion featured
Kristie LaSalle 'O6 and Goldstein

privileged people need not be minorities." Quoting Martin

Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, Goldstein said
he wanted to see students' admission to college based "not
on the color of their skin but the content of their character." He supports class-based but not race-based
affirmative action.
Pope argued for affirmative action by discussing
"what a colorblind society"

favor of it.
The Ring's facilitators asked the audience to be open to
the possibility that panelists might change their views

during the dialogue.
LaSalle recognized that affirmative action has "made
major strides in skin equality" but that today the "color of
students' skin shouldn't make them any more appealing
an applicant." She said affirmative action creates a "bias
against whites" and unfair prejudice against minorities,
resulting in comments like "Oh, they got in 'cause they're
black." Instead LaSalle proposed that college admissions
departments should "strive for a diversity in experience."
"This is a white man and he's losing ground. He's now
only 90 percent of Congress!" Delgado said, imitating the

fear she thinks drives attacks on affirmative action.
"Institutional racism is the foundation of why we need
affirmative action," Delgado said. "It lets racist folks know

Alums hope trucking jobs will ease poverty in Kensington

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

The

first

client

in the door at
Kensington Driving Partners was trucker

material.
Just six months before, he'd gotten a
driver's license. He spoke English fluently,
though, like many Kensington residents,
he was born in Puerto Rico. He was young
21 but he looked older. He had no work
experience to speak of, but he was eager to
land a steady job. He had a high school
diploma. His criminal record was clean.
He had read a Spanish-language newspaper article about a pair of recent
Swarthmore graduates who work to start
North Philadelphia residents on careers as
So, like six other
residents so far, he decided to
meet with Josh Hurwitz 'O2 and Phil
Garboden 'O2 to see what they had to offer.
When he walked in the door of the small
office at 2111 N. Front Street early in
commercial drivers.
Kensington

December, it became apparent to Hurwitz
and Garboden that their client fit the trucker profile perfectly.
They were excited because they believe
they are offering an opportunity, if only to
a motivated few. They are convinced that
earning a Class B commercial license
good for driving a school bus or delivery
truck
is the best chance some people in
this struggling neighborhood have for
securing themselves a career, rather than
working low-wage jobs or facing unemployment.

When their client came back for his

next interview, Hurwitz and Garboden
described how they could coach him
through trucking school or help find him a
driving job with free training. As a bus
driver for the Philadelphia school district,
he can make almost triple the minimum
wage of $5.15. Bilingual candidates like him
get an extra boost in hiring. Two months
later, their client is still waiting to hear
back from the district, Hurwitz said.
Another client would like help becoming a commercial trucker. If he earns a
Class A license, he can work as a big rig
trucker and expect to make $37,000 a year.
That's about two and a half times what the
typical Kensington family

earns.

Despite the opportunities, Kensington
Driving Partners can only hope to serve a
small minority here
those with clean
records and a desire to try their hand at a
difficult profession. Felony drug convictions ruled our the four other clients who
have expressed interest in the program.
Garboden and Hurwitz, who are spending a $15,000 Lang grant on their endeavor.
Neither has ever done any commercial
driving. Hurwitz said the point isn't to
teach people to drive trucks but to help
them navigate the system.
A chance meeting with a trucker on a
Greyhound bus two summers ago inspired
Garboden to start Kensington Driving
Partners. As he was sitting in his bus seat,
musing about his future after graduating
from college, another passenger on the bus
started explaining how he was going down

to Tallahassee, Fla., to become a trucker.
"He gave me the whole pitch," Garboden
said.
Peter Murray 'OO, who worked with
Hurwitz and Garboden in the past on a similar venture, has high hopes for the program, praising Hurwitz and Garboden for

on to "a basic opportunity" for
people in the neighborhood. "It's very different than working at a gas station or in
retail. For folks working in the basic services, it's very difficult to make a leap to a
good wage," he said, and it's a way to
catching

6

punch through a "glass ceiling

or skill ceil-

ing." A job that is full time, that provides a

livable wage and basic benefits, is an
"enormous leap forward for many of the
residents in this area."
While U.S. census data pegs the average
household income at $15,300, some of the
mean income statistics for Kensington
drop below $lO,OOO, Murray said, depending
on how the area's borders are defined.
"It's visually the poorest area in
Philadelphia," Garboden said. "It became
the low-income ghetto situation that you
have in many cities nowadays
ghetto not
being the scientific term exactly, but that's
a pretty good way to describe it."
A high rate of drug convictions as well
as the widespread practice of driving but
never getting a license (police don'tbother
to stop drivers for that too often, many said)
bar a number of people in this community
from jobs as commercial drivers.
Drugs ruled out Kensington Driving
Partners' second client, who in all other
ways had a similar background to its first.
He even had a friend who drove trucks so
he knew what he was getting into. But he
had been convicted for dealing drugs, and
they had to show him to the door.
A fifth of Kensington's adult population
is unemployed, according to Michael
Felberbaum, the executive director of the
Empowerment Group, the umbrella organization for Kensington Driving Partners.
Census data show that over 48 percent of
Kensington residents live in households
that are below the poverty line. Even
with a job, a general lack of training and
English skills often means there is no second step on the job ladder.
Garboden and Hurwitz do not pretend

over the past 25 years, all seem to be powerless to solve the problems that have been
plaguing North Philadelphia for several
decades.
For all the changes, when it comes to
how easy it is for people in the neighbor-

hood to get jobs, "I haven't seen anything

different," Borges said.
Out on North Front Street, in the shadow of the subway tracks that run to Center
City, store managers describe the people
who have come to them looking for work.
Some say the situation is getting worse.
Richard Weber, a salesman at Gelfand's
Hardware across the street from the
Empowerment Group's office, judges the
need for jobs in the area by how he often he
fields requests for work, usually for construction work. Usually, he can't help
them. "Most of them are unskilled," he
said. He also noted that for many job seekers, language is another barrier to getting
ahead. More so than in other areas of
North Philadelphia, Kensington has a high
concentration of Latinos
68 percent
and many of them are immigrants.
The store manager, Hector Vicenty, said
there is a lot of talent in the neighborhood,
just not enough education to get a job.
"People are looking for any labor
any-

thinglhey can do."
People are constantly coming in and
asking for work, said Freddy Ghobriel, the
manager of Fine Fare Supermarket a few
blocks lip on the corner of Susquehanna
and Front Street. About half of the job-

seekers come out of halfway houses or
work placement programs. He tries to help
when he can, he said, and has employees
who have been on welfare. But as it is now,
he doesn't have any jobs to fill.
Borges said the majority of people she
deals with at the Norris Square Family

Center do not have a high school diploma.
If they do, she said, it's from a Puerto Rican
high school.
"The only jobs I've been able to link
people on are factory jobs," Borges said.
She has been able to place a number of
people at a factory outside the neighborhood where workers are paid $5.75 an hour
to sew zippers on jackets.

a

difference?

"Training. But realistic training." She said
she was both skeptical and optimistic that
a group like Kensington Driving Partners
would provide that. "The class B thing
sounds good, but most of these people don't
have licenses," she said.
Perhaps some of Borges' skepticism
comes from experience. She knows how
much work is needed to make such very
small steps against such very large problems. She is also dubious of efforts by people who aren't from the community.
Garboden and Hurwitz, dressed in their
dark blue "KDP" polos and sitting in their
shared office at the Empowerment Group,
said they will do their best to see that their
clients succeed. They just hope for more

said.
While Kensington Driving Partners
touts itself as a group that makes opportunity somewhat easier to reach, Maria
Borges has her doubts that such a narrow
effort will make much of a difference.
Borges works at the Norris Square

Family Center where she finds employment for 70 local job-hunters every year.
The center has a small office on Orkney
Street
at the William McKinley
Elementary School, where the school
building is decorated with bright murals,
a stark contrast to the two gutted row
houses right across the street.
Inside, Borges let a child play games

on her computer while she described her
neighborhood, Kensington, where she
has lived for 20 years. "This is not a bad
area. We've just had some bad luck," she
said. "We've been through drugs. A lot of
theft." But despite the continuing problems, she has seen some things get better
over time.
She has seen how the area's decline
spurred service groups to move into the
neighborhood and she watched grassroots efforts spring up within the community. The neighborhood now has a
range of well-developed community
organizations. The Free Library of
Philadelphia lists 19 service groups in
Kensington, and there are many more.
The efforts of these groups renovated

For V-Day,
artists draw to
stop violence
BY SUE CHEN
schenl@swarthmore.edu

The Clothier bells struck the quarter hour in
the Old Tarble art studio as Chloe Le Pichon 'O5
lay down and stretched out on two blankets
placed in the sun. Around her, artists set to work.
Soon, outlines of nude figures emerged on the
pages of their sketchpads. The room was silent,
except for the occasional scratching of charcoal
on paper and the muted sounds of children sledding down Parrish beach.
Saturday's nude modeling session was a fund
raiser for Swarthmore's V-Day Campaign to raise
money for women's groups. Each year around
Valentine's Day, colleges across the country put
on Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues," a play
that catalyzed a movement called V-Day, intended
to increase awareness of violence against women.
The idea for a nude modeling session occurred
to "The Vagina Monologues" director Eliza Cava
'O6, technical director Katie Davenport 'O5 and
stage manager Joanne Jacobson 'O3 as they were
planning this year's V-Day Campaign. Nudity,
Jacobson said, is an important part of the V-Day
message.
"It is 'The Vagina Monologues' and the whole
idea of stripping away secrecy and having this
creative process that mirrors what is going on in

'The Vagina Monologues,' she said. "It's about
making it not this dark hidden territory that
needs to be hushed up. We can say the word Vagina'; we don't have to use euphemisms all the
time."
"

So Jacobson got in touch with Le Pichon, president of the Student Art Association, which also
hosts its own nude modeling sessions for artists.
When Le Pichon, who has been painting for four
"because it's a
years, could not find models
fund raiser, I felt like we shouldn't be paying
she did it herself.
someone to model"
"I think the hardest thing is the first time you
model. You might be a bit scared about it and feel
people are going to judge you. But once you let go
of that and you do it for the art, then it's OK," Le

Pichon said.

Her three hours of posing allowed six artists to
create about 20 drawings, all of which will be sold
after this weekend's production of "The Vagina
Monologues."
Proceeds from the drawings and other parts of
V-Day Campaign will be donated to the
Women's Law Project, a Philadelphia non-profit
group that gives free legal aid and advice to
women dealing with domestic abuse and child

the

custody cases.

Le Pichon invited all those on the art department mailing list to donate their time and art to
V-Day.

"I wasn't sure I wanted to do it at first, knowing that I wouldn't get to hold on to my artwork,"

Jeff Wu 'O2 admitted, but he remembered a friend
who had volunteered for the Women's Law
Project and the work it does. "I hadn't done much
for the community since the summer, so I thought
it was a good time to let go of my selfishness and
help out," he said.
For studio art major Fabien Tepper 'O3, attending the session allowed her to not only practice
her art but also remain part of V-Day. "I take
advantage of modeling sessions whenever I can
and was glad to know that this time my work
could be sold for a cause benefiting women," she
said.
Three years ago, Tepper acted in Swarthmore's
first "Vagina Monologues" production, directed
by Anna Woodiwiss 'O2. "[l] am happy to have a
role in the event this year through my drawings,"
she said.

Fabien Tepper sketches model Chloe Le Pichon. She will sell her drawing to raise funds for an anti-violence group.
"What [the artists] are doing has value because
they're creating art and also has value because
it's part of something that's trying to stop violence against women and raising awareness,"

Jacobson said.
That said, Jacobson is reluctant to put a price
tag on each drawing. "I would like it to really be
driven on what people themselves value the artwork to be," she said. Each piece will be sold at
the buyer's discretion, with a minimum five-dollar donation
"Hopefully, people will feel compelled to
donate a little more than that," Jacobson added.
"This is something that people came and donated
their free time and art and skill to."

Love me don't
BY JONAH GOLD
jgoldl@swarthmore.edu
I know what you're
thinking. Love songs?
Come on. Who gets excited about love songs? It's

been done, dude. Why
not write about pirate
songs, or food songs, or
songs about
sexy female robots?
Well, it is Valentine's

hip-hop

JONAH GOLD
Where Eagles Dare

Day, the most despised
holiday in America and

a time to think about the
warmer, fuzzier things.
And even in high school,
when my comments on
love would have been

short and unprintable, I was still stuck in a damn
world of music obsessed with love. My favorite
songs were songs I couldn't personally relate to,
and I'm pretty sure I secretly wanted to. I lived a
love life vicariously, through rock 'n' roll, and yes,
that was and is every bit as lame as it sounds.
This is the way it works sometimes. There is a
connection between music and the stomach-knot-

ting, brain-smashing thing Barry White calls
"loooove" that is far too strong for its own good. So
now, in recognition of a holiday perpetuated solely
by flower and greeting-card sellers, I'm happy, and
think it's important, to share my favorite songs representing the range of human emotion that falls

under the sphere of "love." Enjoy them, consume
them, deconstruct them, take them as a model to
write your own. I don't care what you do with them,
ultimately; just find them. The hope, I suppose, is
that the song will do the rest.

There is a connection between
music and the stomach-knotting,
brain-smashing thing Barry White
calls "loooove" that is far too
strong for its own good.
Top five embarrassing all-out mushy songs
1. "What a Wonderful World," by Louis
Armstrong. I don't need to sell this song to you just
to remind you that it used to not be something asso-

ciated with commercials and that it deserves its
fame. I hope I have sold it anyway, because this
song rules.

2. "Lovesong," by The Cure. Holds its place on

one of the best, saddest romance
albums ever, as a sweet, simplistic, almost upbeat
ode to some lucky muse of everyone's favorite
chubby, elaborately coiffed genius, Robert Smith.
Also try the Tori Amos version.
3. "She's An Angel," by They Might Be Giants.
This song is nerd love embodied. "We raced up and
down the sidewalk twenty thousand million times"
manages to be the most romantic lyric ever to
include a really big number, and this is somehow
"Disintegration,"

appropriate.
4. "All Is Full of Love," by Bjork. Not directed

toward another person, but a love song nonetheless. I like to pretend "Venus as a Boy" is about me
sometimes. But it isn't. And this song is better anyway.
5. "Into My Arms," by Nick Cave. Honestly, Nick
Cave used to be so much cooler before he found
religion. But he can still write a damn touching
love song, if a little bit on the creepy side. Who else

10

could make "I don't believe in an interventionist
God" the beginning of a paean to his sweety-poo?

Three great songs for lost love, frustration and
other bad things
1. "Louie Louie," by the Kingsmen, as reinterpreted by Black Flag. Whenever I listen to Black
Flag I silently cry at the monstrosity Henry Rollins

has become and marvel at the much cooler monstrosity he used to be. "Who needs love / When
you've got a gun? / Who needs love / To have any
fun?" Um, I can't understand the lyrics of the original either, Henry, but I don't think those were in

there.

2. "Kiss Off," by the Violent Femmes. One of the
most formative songs of my middle school and
early high school life, though I don't know that
that's a good thing. Gordon Gano rips off Lou Reed
better than anyone has for a while, and he brings a
teenaged frustration to everything he does that
grounds it all sublimely. The Femmes' self-titled
debut is a concept album in spite of itself, and this

is one of its centerpieces.
3. "Orange Ball of Hate," by the Mountain Goats.
A more recent obsession than most of these songs,
for me, but so perfect as to necessitate inclusion
nonetheless. John Darnielle manages more badass
rage with an acoustic guitar and a voice than
all the rap-rock bands with misspelled
names put together can manage with four instruments and a DJ.

love in
mix tape form

The gentle art of melodious love
BY AARON WASSERMAN

awasserl@swarthmore.edu

Why does the mix tape get so much criticism? Journalists frequently write that certain songs would make great mix tape fodder to deride their quality; every Dashboard Confessional song
provokes smirks because it usually finds itself in the middle of a
mix tape's side B.
OK, admittedly, the mix tape is the epitome of adolescent
you sheepishly hand over the tape to convey emotions
romance
rather than stating them yourself. But what's so bad about that?
After all, musicians (and poets and novelists) have found a niche
in society because they can capture moments in ways that others
can't. Untalented commoners like myself should be expected to
take advantage of other's artistic merits. It's part of a symbiotic
relationship. And, well, I'm still a teenager.

This is one of the many reasons I love the movie "High
Fidelity" so much: It glorifies
the mix tape. Jack Black

end as if it were taking
a huge leap in their

relationship,
and
then finally comes to
his senses and set-

ties down with the
love of his life by making her
a tape with the stuff he knows she

ces.

"High Fidelity"

understands all that is right with the
mix tape. It gives the composer, usually someone who lacks any
musical talent whatsoever, a chance to feel like an actual musician, meticulously choosing which songs fit best in certain positions to create the perfect aesthetic. Unfortunately for the beginner, not much public information is available on how to compile
the proper mix tape. At the end of "High Fidelity," Cusack tells his
audience he likes to start with a big rocker, take it up one more
notch with the second track and then cool things down with the
third song, so that he doesn't reach the point where he can't top
himself. Thankfully, that's as far as he gets. If he were to outline
his technique in detail, it would nearly ruin the movie, divulging
a secret that's only supposed to be discovered through experience.
It would have spoiled all the fun.
Now, Valentine's Day is upon us, and, as I said before, I'm still
a teenager, so I currently find myself hunched over my CD collection, poring through the possibilities. (For those of you who know
and have seen the collection, that's a lot of possibilities.)
Considering how much I idolize the actor, it's surprising that I'm
not heeding Cusack's advice. I want something that she can sing
along to in the car as she's slightly slumped in her seat, but I still
want her to pretend to be a rock star in front of the mirror, so I'm
letting things develop slowly (you know, to create a mood or something romantic like that). There's a nice, slinky beginning
"Don't Hold your Breath," by Calla
something with a
strummed guitar to follow "Thinking about You," by Radiohead
and then a gradual pickup of the tempo as things progress.
The tape will have a climax in the middle "Dial Up," by Ted
Leo/Pharmacists and then gradually recede just like it entered
before peaking one last time "Ears Ring," by Rainer Maria
"My Valuable Hunting Knife," by
and concluding gracefully
Guided by Voices well, sort of gracefully. Obviously, I'm taking
this very seriously, but the mix tape is a very serious endeavor.

Come spend the night
Kate Duffy of Daring Exploits spends a romantic night
sans

girly screams
BY KATE DUFFY

kduffyl@swarthmore.edu
In recognition of Valentine's Day, Erik Osheim
'O3 and I decided to camp out somewhere quiet and
romantic. Naturally we chose the abandoned
insane asylum in Deptford, NJ.
Lakeland Mental Hospital crumbles away just
off Route 42, about 45 minutes from Swarthmore.
The reason for its abandonment is unclear. Weird
NJ Magazine suggests that one inmate began
killing fellow patients; other rumors include a massive fire, though no burn marks are visible inside
or outside the building. Trespassers have encountered signs of cult activity since its closing, including dissected snakes, ghastly graffiti and pigeons
speared to walls with wooden stakes. An identical,
functioning institution sits across the street,
encouraging the notion that the old one emanated
so much evil they had to shut it down rather than
renovate.
Erik and I located the asylum after dark.
Though most of the windows had been boarded up,
we climbed to a second-story opening and tossed
some blankets inside. Before following our sleeping
gear into the abyss, Erik reminded me of potential
dangers. Police may prosecute us for trespassing.
Pieces of plaster may fall on us. Homicidal bums
often stab college students in their sleep.
"We can still turn back, Kate," he concluded. "If
you're going to panic or emit girly screams, we
should leave now." Ha! This little jab heightened
my determination to spend all night in the asylum,
Nurse Ratched spirits or no. Tremble, ye knifewielding hobos, and despair!
I tumbled through the window to find myself
standing atop a rickety metal desk in some long-forsaken office. Erik crept into the next room, where
we made our first grim discovery. Shrouded by cobwebs and shadows stood an electroshock therapy

THE PHOENIX

chair! Man! Or was it a hair salon seat? Certainly I
never imagined instruments of behavioral modifi-

cation to be upholstered in beige vinyl. Regardless,
the chair gave us quite a shock.
Erik and I had actually visited Lakeland once
before. Last time, we found overturnedfile cabinets
piled with patient papers, used syringes and
padded

rooms labeled "SECLUSION" inside the

asylum. During this more recent trip, however, we
spotted evidence of a cleanup operation: Most doors
and furnishings had been removed, and all the
floors smelled of fresh paint. Someone (or something) had taken a renewed interest in Lakeland's

fate.

Shrouded by cobwebs and
shadows stood an electroshock
therapy chair! Or was it a hair
salon seat?
We strolled whispering through the hallways,
searching for a proper place to set up camp for the
evening. Clocks and exit signs dangled on wires
from the ceiling. Piles of mattresses and broken
pianos impeded our path. Graffiti encouraged us to
kill ourselves: "This is the best place to do it. God
bless." Every creak hinted at dangers crouching
just beyond the range of Erik's flashlight.
Eventually we piled our belongings into an
empty room and barricaded the door until morn-

ing. When at last daylight surged through the window, the asylum seemed less dismal. Quickly and
silently, Erik and I heaved our belongings out the
office window and dashed through the snow to the

car. We had defeated the dank unknown!

Do you believe in love at first sight?
Kat Bridges: No!
Sarah Walsh: I believe in lust at first sight; if that turns
into love, so be it.
KB: Yeah, good for you. I can definitely be attracted to people at first sight, but the people I have felt a serious real personal attraction to, it hasn't generally been like that.
SW: That's why I said lust.

Does size really matter?
SW: My thing is that I think that size has become this huge
societal thing
it's difficult for men because it represents
something more than anything. It teaches guys to feel bad
about themselves. I know many women and guys too who actually prefer smaller penises
it's not the size, it's what you do
with it and what you do with other stuff as well.
KB: Honestly, I've got to be totally honest and say that it's a
combination. It's definitely what you do with it, but from comparative research, I have discovered that to an extent it means
something; it does something good.
WT: I would have to agree with that. I mean, it's definitely
not the be-all and end-all, but it makes a difference, I mean,
even if you're not having anal or vaginal sex, in which I imagine it wouldbe more important, even for oral sex I think it does
make a different it terms of pleasure and the whole feel of it. On
the other hand, I know people who have had wonderful experiences with people who have had three-inchers, or whatever.

SW: Just like all vaginas aren't created the same size,
either.
What are some guidelines for watching porn with your significant other?
KB: The guidelines for me would be, well
Heather: Do it, do it and do it.
KB: For me, that hasn't really played in, because I've
always watched with my significant other and been in the
company of, like, 15 other MLers, and it's been really weird.

SW: I watched my first porn with my significant other. I
think that a lot of girls aren't exposed to porn, and feminists
we're taught that it's so bad, the industry, and I have so many
problems with the industry, but I've had a really good experience with watching porn with significant others. I think it can
be really sexy and really fun if you find the right porn.
WT: I love porn. Bad porn, good porn, gay porn, straight
porn, low-class porn, high-class porn, I love it all. But I think it
really depends on the partners, and some people really do have
issues with porn, and to find out that their partner really wants
to watch porn with them can really ruin the relationship if that
person really feels that strongly about porn

KB: Sex and porn are just not the same to me.

Friends with benefits?

SW: That's how my relationship started. So we were friends
for a long time, then we were friends with benefits, then we
realized we missed each other when we weren't friends with
benefits, so I can't say that I don'tbelieve in it. It can also end
really badly, too, so I'm also not necessarily a supporter, either.
WT: I think that this phenomenon has really prevented me
from having any real gay male friends. Just because there's
always that potential.
KB: There's always this tension, there's always this,
"Should we be fuck buddies?"
WT: Even if they're not attracted to you, you're still personally like, how can I make them attracted to me? Maybe it's
just me, but there's just this weird thing that it's just not even
Possible because of that weird tension.
KB: I don't even think that it's just specific to the gay community or any community. Personally, it's never worked for

me.

Is it possible to be in love with more than one person?
KB: I don't know.
SW: I think yes, but for me, no.
KB: I've tried to convince myself that it could work for me,
before, but it hasn't.
WT: I think love is a social construction, and because of
mat it's tied to monogamy
KB: And commitment.
WT: It's just really hard.
SW: Well, I know some people who have polyamorous rela-

I

KB:
Oh yeah, definitely, there are
people who have fine,
fine poly relationships,
and that's no problem, and
I totally respect that.
WT: I think that they somehow escape that social construc-

What are the ethics of hooking up with your friend's crush
or previous hook-up?
SW: Don't do it! You're a bad person if you do. Don't hook
up. Be a good friend!
WT: It depends on the friendship. If you feel comfortable
talking to them beforehand, talk to them. Say, look, I'm also
into so-and-so, and he's into me. I know this kind of sucks for
you, but...
SW: Yeah, but in that case you have to risk losing your
friendship. If it's worth losing it, and you're OK with that, then

WT: Yeah, and what if that person is really hot and this is
your only chance?
KB: I agree with both of you. I've seen it happen, and it can
be fine. There's a certain dorm I know where people hook up
with each other a lot. And I may or may not live there. It's relationship-swap city. And usually, when people really switch

Vaginas speak out for V-Week
This semester's "The Vagina Monologues" gets men in on the action
BY SYDNEY BEVERIDGE
sbeveril@swarthmore.edu

speaking up without being asked,
about reveling in a joy that you
didn't have to earn from someone

I sneaked into Kohlberg Coffee
Bar for an important discussion
last Saturday, but this was not
your typical study group. We were
going to talk about talking about
vaginas, namely Eva Ensler's "The
Vagina Monologues." "The Vagimonials!" said Technical Director
Katie Davenport 'O5, 'land sometimes just monials." This year's

else because it's there in you
already." The play empowers indi-

production, directed by Eliza Cava

'O6, emphasizes the conversational
elements of the monologues and
even incorporates men. This weekend, Carmen Barron 'O5, Veronica
Betancourt 'O6, Kat Melville 'O4,
Lulu Miller 'O5, Ariana Nash 'O6,
and Stephanie Rogan 'O6 will sit
together in Lang Concert Hall to
make their theatrical debuts talking

about vaginas.

"The Vagina
Monologues"
Performances Friday, Feb.
14, 8 p.m., Saturday, Feb.
15 and Sunday, Feb. 16,
7 p.m. in Lang Concert Hail.
Free admission. Vagina
merchandise available. See
www.vday-swarthmore.org.

Cava describes the small cast as
a group of "storytellers" rather
than actresses, and their stories
are provocative in every sense of
the word. The monologues range

from sexy to poignant to funny,
and all affirm female sexual identity. The play continues Vagina
Monologue conversations of years
past and begins its own. "You can
never have enough vaginas," said

Cava of the ongoing relevance of

the play. This year's production
also includes men through a separate performance after the play.
Smiles, cheers and shifting

stools filled the interview and
rehearsals with excitement and
anticipation. "This is absolutely

the greatest group of cunts I've
ever worked with," Melville said.
"It's about being celebratory, about

viduals and communities and chal-

lenges the mistreatment of women.
For Davenport, the play also
presents a "practical, personal

form of feminism." The monologues cannot "be all things to all
people," Davenport said, because
they come from one author's perspective, but they do offer a "jumping-off point for women's sexuality."
Cava explained that, though the
"vagina is pretty exclusively not
male." This is not male-bashing;

"It's

about

the

women

them-

selves," she said.
"You get to hear about everything from full-out violence against
women to the notion of women
needing the time to truly find and
appreciate themselves," Rogan
said.

This year, men are getting in on
the action, too. Separate male and
female workshop groups responded to Cava's question, "What will

our world be like when violence
women and girls no longer
exists?"
Arthur Chu 'O6 led the men's
workshop. Reflecting on the personal input of his collaborators,
Chu said, "It's heartening beyond
belief to see men coming out, eager
to participate and full of thoughts
and ideas about an issue that
women often think of themselves
as having to deal with alone."
The production's emphasis on
conversation and communal experience readily connects with both
against

the participants and the audience.
Chu said, "Any discussion of vioperpetratlence against women
ed, of course, mostly by men
requires us to explore the world of
men to some extent, try to look
inside ourselves and see the ways
we hurt our mothers, our daugh-

ters, our sisters, our lovers, our
wives and our friends day by day,
and see the ways they hurt us, and
try to learn from it."

Difficulty with lobsters and cashing small checks
Luis Cabalquinto and his daughter Sofiya, a recent graduate, read their verse in the Scheuer Room last week
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

The familial links were clear at last Thursday's poetry
reading. Humorous images of off-color topics, gem-like
descriptions of New York and the Philippine streets, and
candid, witty commentary colored the verses of Luis
Cabalquinto and his daughter Sofiya, a recent graduate, as
they presented their poetry in the Scheuer Room Feb. 6.
English professor Peter Schmidt called Luis's work "simple
language loaded with meaning."
Any subject seemed fair material for a Cabalquinto
poem. Sofiya's helplessness in the face of a lobster's
unbreakable shell and the boy who helped her. Luis's selfdeprecating nostalgia in "Waiting to Cash a Check for
$40.95." A walk through the ogling crowds of envious

Filipina girls

in "Manila Nightlife" and the silent human
beings who speckle the early morning scene of "Crossing
the Park."
In a poem she admitted she had written in high school
but also submitted for Professor Nat Anderson's poetry
workshop, Sofiya, who graduated last June, wove images of
her parents' homeland, the Philippines, "the sunny land of
rope hammocks and roasted pigs." Luis read an entire piece
on a pig-roasting tradition, using the Spanish word as he
described "Eating Lechon with my Brothers and Sisters"
amidst storytelling and wine.
The bubbling volcanoes her father always draws on the
margins of pages were the subject of another Sofiya poem,
and Luis sketched one it looked more like a cloud on stick
legs to me
when he signed the edition of "Bridgeable
Shores" he gave me after the reading. He read exclusively

from that 1969-2001 collection, which he had dedicated to
Sofiya and her mother, Gloria.
A native Filipino who began studying in the United
States 35 years ago, Luis has published three collections of
poetry in the Philippines since 1989 and writes in English,
Tagalog and Bikol. Many American anthologies have featured his work, and he has received prizes from the
Academy of American Poets and New School University. He
lives in New York City and the Philippines.
Sofiya graduated from Swarthmore with a major in
English literature last June. She served as an editor of the
campus literary magazine Small Craft Warnings, won the
John Russell Hayes Prize for poetry and the Morell-Potter
summer stipend for creative writing, and brought numerous poets, including Galway Kinnell, to the college. She currently lives in Brooklyn, NY.

is to be independent, happy with or without a

anything less than Prince(ss) Charming, and,
as Cagen puts it, possessed of "a talent at deconstructing love songs equal only to your vulnerability to them." We are what Utne Reader calls
"a brave breed to resist the tyranny of coupledom in favor of independent self-expression."

of essays published in Cagen's To-Do List and
Utne Reader, just happens to occur on Feb. 14;
yep, the same day as that most cliched and constraining of all holidays.

up everything my friends and I are all about.
But we're actually not that quirky (yeah, keep
telling yourself that, look at where you go to
school) and we're not really alone (ditto). But
according to Sasha Cagen, editor of To-Do List
magazine, being quirky and/or alone is something quite separate from being quirkyalone.
So don't worry. Just because you're
quirkyalone doesn't mean you're not cool.
I was lamenting with a few compatriot
quirkyalones about our status when it hit us:
We needn't be permanently bound to a society

that chains us to the banal progression of
puberty, spin the bottle, first kiss, first dance,
prom, dating, engagement, marriage, June
Cleaver-dom, motherhood, menopause, death.
No! We are Swarthmore students, and that in
itself sets us high above anything that's mainstream. (Right?) We are no longer geeky, nar-

cissistic, socially inept, overachieving freaks.
(Right!) We are independent, self-reflecting, talented, Prada-wearing Sarah Jessica Parkerettes (OK, where's the Prada?) who depend for
sustenance not on their bed buddies but on
their circle of quirkyalone friends!
All of us took the diagnostic quiz, and, well,
all of us passed (definitely passed). We are cardcarrying members of the quirkyalone tribe
founded around the term created by Sasha
Gagen.
So, if you're feeling empowered after reading this article (I do what I can) and see yourself reflected in the testimonials of the preceding infomercial, join the rest of the
quirkyalones around the world on Feb. 14, a day
that just happens to be associated with a less
important holiday, and celebrate our solitarity
in solidarity!

even we asexual academic

time out of our schedules to
celebrate the weird concept

with a guide to dating for cheap Swatties, and by this, we
mean all of you.

take some Tupperware to Sharpies so that you can "make"
her breakfast in bed. Remember that the breakfast is only
a prelude to the romantic lunch for two in the Parrish
Ballroom (e-mail us for tips on how to "open" the door to
the ballroom). Decorate using borrowed flower arrangements from Sharpies. As for dinner, repeat breakfast, but
this time at Tarble. Try to convince your lovebird it's a
Japanese grill. If she accuses you of lying, tell her she's
culturally ignorant for not knowing that chicken finger
wrap is English for sushi. Then head over to Chez
Kohlberg for some fine foreign desserts. End the night
with some chai-induced Kama Sutra time on Parrish
Beach, all the while appreciating how "beautiful" trains

that gives wonderful tours. They leave from this place

3. The Politically Correct Date.
This one is for all you angry salad socialists out there
who just hate Western culture. First, schedule a fireside
chat in Parrish Parlours to discuss the commercialization
of love and human affection via Hallmark in the United
States. If your girlfriend gives you anything, throw it back
at her and remind her that you don't believe in this capitalist bullshit. Then take it back from her to teach her a
lesson. When she starts crying because all the other girls
have flowers, remind her that flowers are living, breathing, sentient beings and that this holiday is far worse than
all the genocides combined, including Thanksgiving. Top
the night off with a dinner for two at Iron Hill, except don't
take your date, and convince her you are at an anti-V-Day

SOME OF MY BROKEN NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS

One of this college's important tasks
more important than any nicety we could wish for
is ensuring
that students committed to helping others have the
means to do so. CIVIC, the umbrella organization for
community service groups that recently had to give its
budgeting rights to Student Budget Committee, has
helped in this role for some time now, assisting groups
with funding for projects and providing support to
group leaders. Most people who work with CIVIC are
confident that, as SBC takes back control of service
groups' finances, groups aren't going to disappear, and
certainly misuse ofSBC funds will decrease.
Service groups are only supposed to spend money

that comes from the Student Activities Fund

which

on projects that directly benefit students here. But certain community service groups were
using funds to buy books and zoo admission tickets for
elementary school children, a clear violation of SBC's

rules. As an SBC member explained last fall, buying
materials for sandwiches for the homeless is fine, since
it benefits students through the time they spend making
the food. Buying underwear for the homeless with SBC
money, however, is not permitted.
We realize the debates over who deserves what piece
of the Student Activities Fund are never-ending. We
know that "if they get more money, we should get more
money" complaints must be the bane of every SBC
member's existence. Still, funding community service
groups, then limiting whom they can spend money on
well, something about that logic leaves us scratching
our heads.

Kudos to Qüb
It is a rare ocassion when a group of Swarthmore
students stop complaining about the college's social
scene and do something to improve it. The group of

students who started Qiib deserve recognition for
their desire to enrich their fellow students' social
lives. The work they have put into Qiib should serve
as an inspiration, showing all of us that we can make
Swarthmore a more fun place to live.

Laptop article contained errors
Dear Editor:
We would like to correct some erroneous information
in last week's article ("McCabe laptop stolen," Feb. 6, pg. 8)
on the laptop theft from McCabe. The author repeatedly
said that we rented laptops. Renting involves an exchange
of money. We loan the laptops as we loan books, videos, etc.
The library provides this service as a convenience to
students. We chose to purchase laptops because we recognized that students might want to use computers in more
flexible ways and spaces than hardwired desktops allow.
When we were deliberating whether or not to purchase
laptops for loan, there were many concerns voiced by various parties on campus. Since the college cannot insure
laptops, the largest concern was theft. However, after considerable research into similar laptop loan programs at
other libraries, we decided that we could do this, if the students had the fiscal responsibility for the laptops which
were on loan to them.
Obviously, that would be an unfair requirement if students could not secure the laptop in their possession. I
wonder how many students who own their own laptop
would think about leaving it lying on a desktop without
locking it and then going off to dinner.
The locking mechanism is not tricky, and any student
who has trouble with it can get assistance from the
McCabe computing consultant or reference librarian.
Alison Masterpasqua is ineligible to borrow a laptop (they
February

13. 2003

are for student use only) and therefore hasn't been shown
how the mechanism works.
The other erroneous information in the article referred
to the absence of someone checking bags in the library
before 9 p.m. There was a time when the library checked
the bags of all those leaving the library, but this was seen
as a violation of patron privacy. We installed the security
system in 1999 and have not had a person checking bags
since that time. Furthermore, we surmise that the perpetrator used one of the fire doors on the ground level to
make his or her escape, since the alarm sounded around
the time of the theft. McCabe does have staff at the circulation desk keeping an eye on things, and we do require
visitors to sign in. Nevertheless, despite our vigilance, it is
still possible for those intent on committing a crime to do
so. In this week alone, Public Safety reported numerous
thefts in Parrish and Kohlberg.
If students did not have financial responsibility for the
laptops in their possession, we would be unable to have
this program. Since its inception, we have loaned the laptops 6,158 times. This is the first incident of its kind. It
would be a shame for all those who have taken advantage
of the program if we could not ask students to sign a binding contract assuming responsibility for the laptop in their
possession.

College fails

bridges

to encourage
real diversity
BY RANDY GOLDSTEIN
rgoldstl@swarthmore.edu
I remember thumbing through Swarthmore's colorful
brochures as I searched for the perfect college. The images
evoked a sense of diversity, with students of all colors
involved in every activity imaginable. In contrast to my
homogeneously Caucasian high school, Swarthmore seemed
like a place where individuals from vastly different back-

grounds could gather for a common purpose of scholarship.
Surely the diversity of the student body would ensure a wellrounded undergraduate experience. Two years later, I ask:
What diversity?
Swarthmore does a fine job of attracting students of varied races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations and
socioeconomic backgrounds. This variety provides vibrant
images with which the college is able to attract those who
value such diversity. Unfortunately, this diversity is superficial at best. While Swatties do indeed represent an assortment of upbringings, they comprise an institution that is
remarkably similar to my high school.
Though varied in color, Swarthmore is
sadly lacking in diversity of ideas.
In an academic environment, dialogue is crucial to the learning process.
Personal and intellectual growth are
found in listening to and debating with
those whose views may differ from our
own. The average Swattie, however,
would be hard-pressed to find such an
Rather than a healthy blend
adversary.
BURSTING THE
of ideologies, the bulk of Swatties subBUBBLE
scribe to a homogeneous and closedminded set of values.
On the rare occasion that a contrary opinion emerges, it
is mocked and quickly suppressed rather than embraced as
a valid view. The result is an environment in which ideological minorities are discriminated against and made to feel
inferior.
As I write this column in Mephistos, a group in the adjacent lounge has spent the past 10 minutes making jokes
about President George W. Bush. These jokes do not criticize
his policies but rather focus on his looks, speech and, God
forbid, his "conservatism." Yet this is wholly indicative of
what most students here deem as acceptable dialogue. I have
on more than one occasion found myself arguing with a fellow student over something as serious as our pending liberation of Iraq, only to be refuted by a reference to the president's inability to pronounce the word "nuclear."
The results of this intolerance of diverse opinions are not
always as light-hearted as wisecracks about public figures. I
recently argued against race-based affirmative action on a
panel hosted by the Ring. One African-American student, in
asking what could have been a productive question, instead
accused me of "oppressing blackie." Yet no one in the 60-plusmember audience objected. Another student, in an analogy
whose meaning is still lost on me, informed me that he
knows my "people were slaughtered and stuff." I am a Jew,
and those who were "slaughtered and stuff were victims of
the Holocaust. Again, no one objected.
Swarthmore is failing its students. They graduate with a
love of what they perceive to be diversity, yet they have no
acceptance for ideas that differ from their own. They do not
merely disagree with conservatism but personally hate conservatives. They refuse to tolerate the diversity from which
they could most benefit. It is shameful that a school as reputable as Swarthmore produces graduates with such narrow
and tainted minds.
The student body is incapable of correcting this most flagrant flaw. Rather, as long as Swatties find nothing wrong
with vandalizing the College Republicans' bulletin board
(twice this year), ripping down signs for conservative speakers, and making personal attacks on those who would disagree with them on a civil basis, there is little about which
to be optimistic. In recruiting and shaping future classes,
perhaps the administration could make even the slightest
effort to acknowledge this. But hell, we have the most colorful admissions brochures on the block.

The ClA's greatest hits
BY VERONICA HERRERA

vherrerl@swarthmore.edu

I don't believe in popularity polls. But if everybody

seems to be motioning that you've got something in
between your teeth, maybe it's time to take a closer look.
Which brings us to words like "evil," anti-Americanism
well, a musical compilation that would sell like
and
hotcakes.
The European edition of Time magazine has been
conducting a poll on its Web site: "Which country poses
the greatest danger to world
...

in 2003?" With 318,000 votes
cast so far, the responses are:
North Korea, 7 percent; Iraq, 8
percent and, what might come as
a shock to many Americans; the
United States, 84 percent! OK,
this might not come as a great
shock to those of us who object to
SOLUZ
the war, but can you believe that
the rest of the world, namely
Europe, is on to us? They're on to us! And it might be
safe to say that they hate us more

than ever. And you know what
that means. Good luck, Swatties
who are going abroad this semester. Have lots of fun! The world is
waiting with open arms!

was revived in the State of the
Union address. "States like these,
and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the
world." OK, that's it. The moralizing has got to stop.
The last 250 years of American imperialism have been
bad enough with their rhetoric of "protecting freedom
and democracy." Now Bush is expecting us to buy that
we're fighting evil like Fox Crimestoppers fight crooks?
I'd like to see a different kind of State of the Union
address. I'd like to see the president get up to the podium
February 13,

2003

and give a brief history of the last 50 years of CIA intervention abroad. He could call it "The ClA's Greatest
Hits." Each track could be a different year, like maybe
one coup per track. 1951: CIA helps overthrow Mossadeq
in Iran and trains the new Shah's security force to have
what in 1976 Amnesty International classifies as "the
worst human rights record on the planet." 1954: CIA
helps overthrow democratically elected Arbenz in
Guatemala. 1963: CIA has South Vietnamese president
Ngo Dinh Diem assassinated for negotiating with the
north. The Vietnam War ensues. 1963: CIA recruits Iraqi
Baath Party (including young Saddam Hussein) to assassinate leader Abdul-Karim Kassem. After the coup, the
Baath is armed and given a long list of commies to hit.
1973: Kissinger and CIA help overthrow leftist President
Allende and install dictator Pinochet who would be
responsible for thousands of civilian murders. Then the
president could end with a few bonus tracks: The 1989
overthrow of CIA-sponsored Panama leader Noriega,
who left a legacy of over 4,000 buried in mass graves, and
the CIA training of bin Laden.
Instead of fighting so much evil, I'd rather see the
president fight anti-Americanism. Rather than terrorizing the world every time our oil
gets under someone else's sand
or training foreign terror
squads, perhaps we could try a
more diplomatic-approach. And
at the very least, now that we're
on Europe's Most Wanted List,
the president could at least stop
rubbing the hypocrisy in by
denouncing "evildoers." He's
only making it tougher to be an
American overseas. It's like being named Wilburt and
getting sent off to the playground with our shirts tucked
into our transformer underwear.
What, George, you think its easy defending U.S. missions to "defend security" abroad? You think we like
being despised by anyone who can put two and two
together? Well, we don't. And, by the way, it's nuclear,
not nucular.

Color alerts
waste money
BY JESSE TAYLOR
jtaylorl@swarthmore.edu
We're on orange alert now. Orange alert means
that all of the TV commentators get to talk in their
big-boy voices about "chatter" and "heightened risk"
and whatnot and that we're supposed to be vigilant in
the face of the terrorist threat. What terrorist threat,
you may ask? Well, the terroristic one.
I'm talking about our Terror Alert System, a fivecolor scale that ostensibly alerts us to the nefarious
dangers we face from al-Qaeda and similar groups on
our own soil. It starts with the ever-benevolent
Green, that solipsistic denial of Terror At Our Very
Borders. Next, the scale is stepped up to Blue, a pragmatically comforting realization of the Terrorist Menace.
In the middle is Yellow, a
waveringly irresolute line in
the ever-shifting sands of
international
terrorism
between Worry and Fear.
There is the homey Orange,
our present state, in which

rorist threat are diluted into a
MEAN THINGS
vague warning that 300 million people should be Very, Very Careful. Then
there's Red, the color that symbolizes all that is great
in America
Covering The Government's Asses.
Notice that nowhere in that rundown of the
Sherwin-Williams Terrorist Prevention Program did
I speak of any useful information passing between
intelligence organizations and the general public.
That's largely because no relevant information about
fears and predictions of terrorist activity could,
would or should ever make its way to the front page
of The Washington Post or CNN. When you attempt to
instill the fear of an action into a body of people, the
majority of whom are likely not being actively targeted, you provoke one of two responses. Either
everyone is going to be scared, in which case people
stay in and don't go to the movies, go shopping or buy
gas, and you've just succeeded in artificially depressing a short-term economy, or else nobody's going to
be scared or pay attention, everyone is going to go on
about their business normally, and you've just completely destroyed any import the alert system might
have had.

Luckily, people appear to have taken the latter
tack rather than the former. It's kind of sad, but the
Department of Homeland Security is the smelly kid of
the federal bureaucracy, the peripherally off-putting
character in the corner who every once in a while
pops up to tell the class about his bug collection or
giggle uncontrollably about the episode of Pokemon
he watched yesterday. It's a department whose clout
largely resides in this useless scale and other public
relations showcases designed to show a skeptica]
public that yes, the government is doing something
what
and yes, somebody is paying attention
they're doing and what they're paying attention to is
still rightfully kept within the national security
apparatus, but there's a massively priced secondary
bureaucracy with a handy litmus test keeping its eye

on things!

So, we're spending an ungodly amount of money
on a department whose purpose is to inform us that
the government thinks terrorism is bad, and so
should we. A noble sentiment, surely, but also one for
which the lantern-jawed former governor 01
Pennsylvania is not needed. A jowly John Ashcroft
mumbling at the screen would serve much the same
purpose, without the manifest silliness of pretending
that anything more is happening than a strategic
instance of playing it safe so that potential incidents
won't come back to bite those in charge.
As a big-government liberal, my salivary glands
are all primed about spending lots and lots of tax dol
lars on huge bureaucracies, but I like my massive
expenditures to have some nominal purpose beyonc
making the government feel better about potentia
screw-ups.

Pain-killers hit the street
BY MORGHAN HOLT

mholtl@swarthmore.edu

Pain-killers are addictive. Their swimmy-headed, sedative, bye-bye-reality effects can be incredibly enticing.
While I hope to never again have all four of my impacted
wisdom teeth sawed and torn from my gums, my post-op
experience, floating high on a misty cloud of soothing
Percocet, was by far one of the nicest disconnections I've
ever had. Pain-killers beg to be abused.
It should come as a surprise to exactly no one, then,
that methadone, an old-school but until recently underused pain-killer that is also useful in negating the unde-

sirables of heroin withdrawal, has
made its way to the street, hustled
into the hands of non-prescription

patients.
Why does this news warrant
center-front-page coverage in The
New York Times (Sunday, Feb. 9,
headlines screaming, "Methadone,
Once the Way Out, Suddenly
Grows as a Killer Drug")? I can see
just two immediate, potentially
RUMINATIONS
arguable justifications wedged
between less logical reasoning in the Times article.
L Methadone is supposed to be a miracle drug, supposed to heal the souls (or at least the aching heads and
churning stomachs) of die-hard heroin addicts. Get a little
methadone in the junkies' systems and anything is possible: People who have spent years fixated on how to steal
the most the fastest to get the best rock the soonest suddenly care about and bother with gainful employment,
neglected families, the colors of the sunset. Methadone
successfully fixes these people; it can't possibly be a bad
thing. Except that the fixing consists of swapping addictions. The reason methadone so triumphantly tramples
heroin addictions is it replaces them. It may be a slightly
more functional addictive phase, but junkies who turn to
methadone to stop shooting up never really stop using.
They take methadone for the rest of their days or risk
unsavory relapse.

2. Methadone is purportedly a slow-release pain-killer,
which is why it works to counteract heroin withdrawal
and why it is thought to be not particularly addictive

there's no quick fix, no sudden, overwhelming high.

There's no way it could have become a street drug, no reason people would find it desirable. When people first start
buying drugs, though, in their naivete, it isn't likely
they're consulting Merck to get a quick precis of the particular drug's effects. Guy says, "Got some good shit, thirty bucks a bag, get you real high," holds up a bag filled
with a hundred times the powder of a thirty-dollar bag of
smack and you're itching for a fix, so it's likely you'll buy
it and try it and, when you don't feel the killer high, you'll
try a little more, little more, trying to fly until you're
crashing on the cement, overdosing, dead. This is what's
happening all over the country, thanks to methadone. The
drug is addictive because it's a serious sedative; it staves
off pain, physical and otherwise. The drug is scary

The reason methadone so

addictions is it replaces them.
because its effects dawdle, and high-seekers, predominantly adolescents who aren't up on their pharmacology and
are hoping for a little quicker kick, do it till they die.
So the FDA's in a bind because it has so adamantly promoted methadone, the miracle dope-fiend cure, and it
turns out to be not only easily abused, but fatally so. And
the government can't yank it from the market, because the
methadone fiends, lacking the pills, would start stealing to
shoot again, and there's no better quick-fix rehab plan for
junkie parasites. And all the Men in Charge have to say is:
"It's kind of a puzzle. People should be somewhat sophisticated about methadone." Seems like the simple solution to
a puzzle now unnecessarily scrambled is to rethink this
ludicrous line of illogic and reevaluate the true nature and
efficacy of our national rehab programs.

BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

When the Columbia exploded over
Texas on Saturday, Feb. 1, the college
joined in tribute with the rest of the
country by lowering its flag to halfstaff. With the flag lowered, some
members of Why War? raised a peace
flag underneath the American flag.
These students chalked the message "Half-mast for peace" across the

campus. Their intentionally vague
messages about their flag portrayed
the college's American flag to be at
half-staff in support of peace.
These actions are disrespectful
toward this memorial, and the justification reveals extreme selfishness on
the part of the students. These students have chosen to hide; they
remain anonymous, and while they
call for tolerance and peace, they
made the cowardly decision not to

reveal themselves to the rest of the
community for which they purport to
speak.
This week, these students defended
their actions. "Because we come from
Quaker roots," they said in an e-mail

to The Phoenix, "an opposition to militarism and commitment to peace in
the world has been and must continue
to be a part of Swarthmore College."
Not only are these actions offensive, but this justification does a disservice to Swarthmore. By citing
Quaker roots, these students portray
their organization's commitment to
peace
as the college's public
February

ket call for peace because the administrators and deans recognize that certainly not every student is in agreement. Some students support war; others do not. The college's choice to
remain neutral is quite admirable; the
actions of the Why War? students are
not.
These activists used their selfish
views to take advantage of the college's kind gesture in mourning the
victims of the Columbia. When a country memorializes those who had the
courage to risk their safety for public
service, the memorial deserves the
full respect of the country's citizens. It
should not become victim to the
whims of cowardly peace groups. To
belittle a memorial for these astronauts is to denigrate an act of
unselfish sacrifice.
Why War? further justified its
actions by proclaiming that the
Action
Swarthmore Progressive
Committee's anti-war resolution repopinions

the
of all
Swarthmore students. They say that
"the community declared" its opposition to the war. This SPAC resolution
represents the opinions of little more
than 400 students who decided to vote.
I hardly see this as representative of
the entire community. The entire community did not vote for peace; the
entire community did not vote to desecrate the memorial of the flag.
To explain why they chose a
national period of mourning, the Why

War? students said that the Columbia
tragedy "is dwarfed by the pain our
government has inflicted on Iraq." So
Why War? uses our fellow Americans'
deaths to exploit their views of dissension toward our government's actions
in Iraq. I do not support unwarranted
actions in Iraq, but I believe that these
students crossed the line in portraying the college as unilaterally supporting peace.

They claim that our American flag
stands for acts of war.
Accordingly, everyone at Swarthmore
must feel the same. Why War? flies its
peace flag to honor dead Iraqis but
ignores the tributes to the dead

Americans. While many students
stand in firm opposition to the Bush
administration, they have not
announced that Iraqis deserve our
sympathy more than our fellow
Americans do. Why War? seems to
advocate that the United States is dead
wrong no matter what; I advocate that
this group is disrespectful to the dead
to
disrespectful
astronauts,
Americans and extremely disrespectful toward other students.
Maybe Saddam Hussein has his
weapons of mass destruction; maybe
he doesn't. Maybe aggressions against

are warranted; maybe they are
not. But these students should not
force their views on the rest of the college. It's true that they deserve a platform, but that does not mean that they
can twist the meaning of symbolic
actions to fit their own very one-sided

Track readies for
V-Day Invitational
BY JIM DALTON

jdaltonl@swarthmore.edu
It could be argued that last weekend's
Grizzly Invitational held at Ursinus
College was merely a tune-up for next
weekend's Valentine's Day Invitational at
Boston University. There's no doubt that
the Garnet indoor team members still gave
it their all and competed at a very high

level, but next weekend's exclusive meet

puts the Tide up against the likes of bona
fide NCAA Division I indoor track and
field athletes. It will surely prove to be a
test of ability and heart as well as a measuring stick to gauge where the Garnet ath-

letes stand heading into the Centennial
Conference Championship.
To prepare for the much-anticipated
Valentine's Day Invitational, some of the
athletes were running events very different from their normal ones. For James
Golden 'O5, who normally runs the 3000meter event, running the 800-meter event
at the Grizzly Invitational served as a
tune-up for his one-mile run at next weekend's meet in Boston.
"Running the 800 will help me with leg
speed, so hopefully the mile pace will feel
relaxed in comparison," Golden said. "I
was definitely more nervous for the 800
because I just had to run much faster than
I've had to in a race all season."
Instead of his usual 3000-meter run,
Garrett Ash 'O5 ran the 1500-meter run at
the Grizzly Invitational, finishing eleventh
with a time of 4:14.42.
"To really perform well in long races
that are 3000 meters or longer, you have to
exert a lot of physical and mental effort,"
Ash explained. "Those efforts can take
awhile to recover from, and you can only
give so many of them in a season. A critical aspect of my training, therefore, is

really counts."
Robert Melick 'O3, who finished in third
place in the shot put with a throw of 12.66
meters at the Grizzly Invitational, is

already looking forward to next weekend's
meet at Boston University. "This meet is
going to be against predominantly
Division I athletes," he said. "My goal for
the meet is to throw my personal best and
try and learn from those individuals who
are paid to throw the shot put in the form
of a scholarship."
The men's 4x400 relay team also performed well at the Grizzly Invitational, finishing fifth with a time of 3:40.58.
For the women's side, Elizabeth
Gardner 'O5 won the 800-meter run with a
time of 2:20.80, while Njideka Akunyili 'O4
placed third in 2:24.45 to lead the Garnet to
a strong showing at the Grizzly
Invitational.
Akunyili is also anticipating a strong
performance in the 400-meter run, which
she ran at last weekend's F&M
Invitational,
at
the
Conference

Championship.
Sarah Hobbs 'O6 placed second in the
1500-meter run with a swift time of 5:06.29,
while the women's 4x400 meter relay squad
also took home silver in a time of 419.04.
Molly Maurer 'O6 rounded out the Garnet
medal winners with a third place showing
in the 3000-meter run. Maurer is also optimistic that her best performance will occur
at the conference championship.
"I would like to have my best race at
the conference meet," Maurer explained.
"Hopefully, I will run a respectable time in
either the 1500-meterrun or the 3000-meter
run. I would like to focus on longer races,
since I feel they are my strength."

Swimmers make splash against Red Devils
BY EMILY CONLON

econlonl@swarthmore.edu

Fans pressed against the metal banisters, teammates shouting from all directions and an intense energy palpable in the
air: to the Swarthmore swim teams, this
was a competition they wanted and wanted
badly.
They got what they wanted. This past
Saturday, both the Garnet men and women

demolished the Dickinson Red Devils 115-89
and 114-91 respectively.
The men started the meet with a convincing win in the 400-yard medley relay
with powerful performances by Jeff
Schneider 'O5, Eric Shang 'O4, tri-captain
David Whitehead 'O3 and Chris Bussard 'O3.
Mike Auerbach 'O5 and tri-captain John
Lillvis 'O3 secured top spots in their individual events to hoist the team into first
place. Auerbach completed a tremendous
meet with first-place marks in the 200-yard
freestyle and the 500-yard freestyle, in addition to a second-place finish in the 200-yard
butterfly. Lillvis's effort earned him backto-back wins in both the 200-yard individual medley (IM) and 200-yard butterfly.

Tri-captain Mike Dudley 'O3, Shang and
Brian Rose 'O6 swept the top three spots in
the 200-yard breaststroke, and the Garnet
men finished off their solid meet with a second-place finish in the 400-yard freestyle
relay. Team members included Lillvis as
well as Ben Morgan 'O5, Darshan Patel 'O5
and Jake Ross 'O5.
The women's team also fared well during Saturday's match. Patricia Funk 'O6
and Tara Trout 'O4 both shone as the team
went on to claim the victory. "Everyone
really wanted to win this meet," Amy Kapit
'O6 said. "We knew it was going to be a
tough win, and we wanted it. Sue told us
before the meet that Dickinson wanted it
badly. We just had to prove we wanted it
more."
And prove it they did. Martyna
Pospieszalska 'O6, Katie Stauffer 'O5,
Melanie Johncilla 'O5 and Trout grabbed
second place in the 400-yard medley relay.
Garnet teammates Christie Thomm 'O5,
Laura Fox 'O3, Krista Gigone 'O4 and Erin
Dwyer-Frazier 'O5 followed right behind,
taking third place away from Dickinson.

win sparked a trend as Funk and Davita

Burkehead-Weiner 'O3 took first and third
place in the 200-yard freestyle.
First-place honors went to Leah Davis
'O4 in the 50-yard freestyle, and teammates
Stauffer and Pospieszalska touched the
wall third and fourth in the event. Funk

repeated her early 200-yard freestyle performance with a win in the 100-yard
freestyle.
In addition to her victory in the 500-yard
freestyle, Trout pulled out a win over
Dickinson's Lisa Mariner by clinching first
place in the 200-yard IM by two-hundredths
of a second. Trout credits the entire team for

the success of both her event as well as the
results of the whole meet in general. "The
team came to the meet with the attitude that
we were going to give it everything we've
got. Everyone had fantastic swims and
swam up in events that we weren't necessarily supposed to win," she said.
Despite illness the night before, talent
and sheer will earned Meredith Leigh 'O4 a
win in the 200-yard breaststroke. The meet
was closed with Swarthmore taking second
place in the 400-yard freestyle relay. The
efforts' of Funk, Johncilla, BurkeheadWeiner and Davis did not go unnoticed.
With the season winding down and conference championships looming ahead, the

teams prepare themselves for the big show.
According to Trout, the team is beginning
to see the fruits of its labor in meets. "It's
starting to come together and all of the
hard work is starting to show," she said.
As the team strives to peak at the right
time, it uses practices to perfect technique.

"There's a lot of focus on ... refining all of
our skills since races can be won in a start,
turn or finish," Kapit agreed. "There are
some really good teams in this conference,
and the win is going to go to whichever
team wants it the most."
The Swarthmore men and women's team
hosted Washington at 6 p.m. on Wednesday
in their final home meet of the season.

this year as in year's past," Robinson said.
The Garnet's current three-game conference win ning
streak started last Wednesday, when they hosted CC East
rival Washington College. Down by three at the break, the
Garnet rallied behind a three-pointer from co-captain Ali
Furman 'O3 just 1:10 into the second half. They went on to
win 77-67. The matchup saw four Garnet players scoring in
double-digits: Furman hit 4-of-12 from behind the arc to
contribute 12 points, while rookie sensation Zoey AdamsDeutsch 'O6 had 18 points, shooting 7-of-8 from the penalty
stripe. Forward Ali Wolff 'O5 contributed 13 points and
seven rebounds. Robinson powered the Garnet's second
half run with her then third consecutive double-doubleof
20 points and 11 rebounds.
Robinson quickly turned her team towards the
Saturday home game against archival Franklin &
Marshall, as she combined with Adams-Deutsch to score
the Garnet's first 10 points. Ahead by just three with 4:49
left in the half, Swarthmore went on a 22-6 run, shooting

22

9-of-10 from the floor and 4-of-4 from the penalty stripe to
bring a 40-21 halftime lead into the locker room.
"We were doing our press and it was working really
well," Robinson said. "It was the best half we've played all

season."
The Diplomats launched a comeback in the second
frame, pulling within five with 4:12 remaining, but the
Garnet sunk 12-of-15 from the line to close out the 70-63
win. Adams-Deutsch had another big scoring game, contributing 24 points and four assists. Outside threat
Furman added 10 points, shooting 50 percent from behind
the arc, and Robinson finished her fourth consecutive
double-double with 29 points and 11 steals. The forward's
impressive number of steals set both the school and conference records for steals in a game.
"I didn't even know I had that many steals. I thought it
was just like any other game," said the modest Robinson.
"I was able to read them pretty well and could tell where
they were going to pass it so I was able to pick them off."
But Robinson was quick to credit the team for their
overall hustle on the court for the victory.
February 13, 2003

"In the first half we came out ready to play right from
the beginning. In the past few games it has taken us a half
to settle down and play the game that we can play. It was
a really big win for us," she said.
The team used Tuesday's 59-38 domination of Bryn
Mawr to seal a playoff spot and give the Garnet bench a
chance on the court. With every player logging at least 11
minutes, consistent contributor Kristen Lee 'O5 had 10
points, while center Jerusha Rogers 'O4 ripped down a
game-high 10 rebounds. Robinson and Furman used the
relaxed atmosphere to edge closer to two milestones:
Robinson now needs just three steals to eclipse Leslie
Ritter's (JHU '00) CC record of 314 career steals. Furman
will be looking for three-pointer number 200, as she has
settled on 198.
The Garnet will be looking to extend their win streak
to magic number four tonight as they host the reigning CC
West leader Johns Hopkins.
"Hopkins is arguably the biggest game of the season,"
Robinson said. "The home fans will be really nice; it'll be
great to have Hop in our home gym."

Diplomats sink Tide with zone defense
BY ERIKA DOYLE
edoylel@swarthmore.edu

Reputation is not everything. It does
not determine who you are or how you
play. Ultimately, victories boil down to
who plays the better game on that particular day. Last Saturday, the Garnet Tide
encountered Franklin & Marshall, the
23rd-ranked team in the nation. "Coming
into the game we knew we would have to
play very well to have a chance to beat
them," co-captain Jacob Letendre 'O4 said.
Although the Garnet fell 62-45, the score
hides how Swat aggressively challenged
this reputable, nationally ranked team.
Matt Gustafson 'OS led Swat with 20
points, while Blair Haxel 'OS chipped in
with 12 points and seven rebounds.
Swarthmore swiftly jumped out to an
exciting 10-4 lead and extended it to 15-6
after seven minutes of play. "Our quick
start in the game was because F&M had
some trouble defending us with their manto-man defense," Letendre said.

nine rebounds, four blocked shots and
four steals.
After the Franklin & Marshall game,
Swarthmore stands in a three-way tie for
second place in the East Division after
Haverford's 62-57 loss to Gettysburg and
Washington's
80-79
victory
over
Dickinson. The teams are now at a standstill with 4-5 conference records.
This Saturday the squad will be hosting a conference matchup against
Ursinus. "Our opponents this week
are
both very good teams who are similar to
F&M in a lot of ways. Hopefully, our guys
will step up to those challenges and shoot
the ball a little better," Wimberly said.
"Clearly, we have a better team this
year, but we just have to figure out a way
to beat the top teams in our conference,"
Letendre said.

Die, Kobe, die
The halfway point of a season always provides a nice brief moment for
reflection. We get to sit back, look at the standings, the statistics and the
highlights, and try to figure out what will happen next. And by we, I
mean anyone who writes a column covering a major league in any sport.
Everyone and their grandmother publishes an article detailing exactly what
they think will transpire in the next hall

of the season and how the whole kit and
kaboodle will turn out. This article is
essentially the same as the one the same
writer published before the season even
started. Only, now, the writer has been
able to edit his earlier predictions and try
and make amends.
All this is great except for one thing.
Trying to predict what will happen in
professional sports is like the first problem on Larry Westphal's micro final. You
only get it right about 15 percent of the
time, and even then, a lot of it is stil
wrong. So, after looking back on my predictions for professional basketball at the
beginning of the year, I have decided not
to make an ass of myself (in writing) a
second time. Instead of making bold predictions that will almost unquestionably

be false, I choose to make bold statements about things I wish would happen. So, journey with me into the sick mind of an individual who watches far too much of the NBA, holds grudges for no reason and is simply a
little bizarre. Welcome to my subconscious.
I hope that Amare Stoudemire has a nice, long sit down with Shawn
Kemp, where the two can talk about the pitfalls of being a major star in
the league. Don't exactly follow me? Well, remember Kemp before the
crippling drug addiction, the crippling child support payments, the crippled knees and the crippling love for all things deep-fried? Oh, yeah. He
was exactly what Amare Stoudemire is today: a fresh-out-of-high-school
stud who dunked with impunity. If there is one thing I love, it is a player
who always wants to posterize some dude. Throw it down, big man! He is
the most exciting player in the game, the reason I tune in to late night
NBA and the only player in the league who serves as a constant reminder
of what Kemp once was and could have been. I am telling you, I pray
every night that Stoudemire a) stays healthy, b) stays off the coke and c)
stays away from the Ho-Hos. He does that, and we are looking at a lot o:
nice SportsCenter clips.
I hope that Tracy McGrady gets some players around him who can
stay healthy. There is no player in the game today as fun to watch as TMac. His handle is sick, his vert is roughly my height, his shot is water
and his teammates are all suffering from injuries. Grant Hill's ankles are
a hop, skip and jump away from Bill Walton's, Mike Miller's hair hurts

or something and the centers on the Orlando Magic just underwent surgery to try to implant some kind of rhythm or soul or whatever it is that
really boring, white players in the NBA lack. I am saying this for the good
of the league. Get T-Mac some healthy surrounding talent, and we might
see him just take over this whole thing.
Which brings me to my final wish. I hope that Shaq stops pretending
to like Kobe and finally just twists his head off. It would be doing a lot o:
us a huge favor. If I have to sit through another night of tongue-wagging
smug-looking, tough-guy-acting Kobe, I might kill someone. If you do not
believe me, come and watch a Lakers game with me sometime. Every
time Kobe does something good, I blurt out the meanest, most ignorant
stuff you've ever heard. "Kill yourself." "Oh, I wish he would just blow
out his ACL!" And that is the stuff that I could print.
I know that Shaq feels the same way. I know that he feels like Kobe
gets too much love, too much hype about the next Jordan garbage. I know
that Shaq secretly wants to kill Kobe and be rid of his smug, charmed
thug life wannabe ass. Or maybe Shaq really doesn't want to kill him. It
doesn't matter. It's my wish. And when it comes to my wish list, plausi
bility takes a back seat, baby. I am not saying these things will happen
I'm only saying I hope they do.
