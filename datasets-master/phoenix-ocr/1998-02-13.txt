thatkids are still going to school."
Lang also increased the amount of his

scholarship in the form of an educational
support system while they were still in high
school.
"I decided I would organize a support program, that would be a year around program,
including summers, that would give them
[the PS 121 Dreamers] academic support,
cultural exposures and recreational experiences and I would continue to do that right
through their school years. That was how
the I Have Dream Program originated. It
was really not the college promise," said
Lang.
In the Dateline segment, one of Lang's

Dreamers also claimed that he was unable
to attend Morehouse College because the
money Lang had promised was only
enough to pay for books. The student never
attended college.
According to the Foundation's letter, before this student was to attend Morehouse,
"Mr. Lang called the college and was able
to arrange for an increase in the Dreamer's
financial aid grant so that Mr. Lang's $ 1,250
grant would satisfactorily complete the
Dreamer's financial aid package."
The student told Dateline that he never
did attend Morehouse. What was not reported to Dateline, however, was that, according to Lang, the student wrote Lang a
letter in December of that same year saying that he had decided he wanted to try to
attend Morehouse again. Lang arranged
with Morehouse College to have the
Dreamer attend the College for the January
13 enrollment. The student never showed
up at Morehouse. Six months later Lang
heard from the Dreamer again, and ibis time
he helped the student with fl'vfe Hundred
dollars to pay for vocational school.
"Before using this Dreamer's account in
the broadcast, NBC never checked his remarks against Mr. Lang's extensive documents on the matter," stated the
Foundation's letter.
"Kids have a right to misunderstand, but
adult reporters do not," said Lang.

According to Lang, since the Dateline
segment aired, a numberof Dreamers have
rallied in support of the program. Last year,
Lang was still in contact with 31 of his
original 54 Dreamers. In addition, some
of the Dreamers have reported to Lang that,
"there was aggressive questioning, and they
[Dateline] tried to make them say things,
or agree to things that were not true."
Lang reports that there has been some
concern about how the Dateline segment
will affect the program. That is one of the
reasons why the I Have a Dream Foundation sent out the internal letter responding

Who may have seen the segment Lang said,
"I hope most of them know me well
enough, either by reputation, or by personal
contact, to know that I keep my word, and
that I would never do anything willingly
to spoil the life or take anything away from
a kid that needed help."

Lang also disagreed with the comparison Dateline drew betw.een Lang's gifts to
PS 121 and Swarthmore.
"It would be quite different ifI were not

Kohlberg has been proactively
seeking to fund and build a tennis

center for some time. According to
SwarthmoreAthletic Director Robert Williams and Head Tennis
Coach Michael Mullan, Kohlberg
has been informally proposing a

In general, majorproject andbuilding proposals originate at the College which then seeks out donors.

will have a health club feel about
it," predicts Schall.
"There will be a noticeable difference in court quality. Even the
recreational tennis player will appreciate a clear difference in quality," says Mullan.
In addition to tennis courts, the
facility will house a new physical
fitness space with room for 44 stations for cardiovascular and resistant weight machines. The glass
walls of the 4,000 square foot fitness room overlook both the tennis
courts

and the football field.

According to Schall, the College
was prepared to spend more than

100,000 on new equipment for the
center, but was able to find a sepa$

new exercise machines. The
equipment will range from aerobic fitness to resistance weight machines like those currently found
in the aging Lamb-Miller
Fieldhouse. Some free-weights
will be located in the new facility,
but most will remain in an expanded free-weight room in the
Fieldhouse.
Both college and athletic administrators hope the new building will
relieve scheduling headaches at the
Fieldhouse, which for years has
suffered from overcrowding of
both people and activities. Athletic
teams currently hold practices as
early as 5 and 6 a.m. to use different courts at the Fieldhouse. "The
new facility will be a tremendous
help in freeing up the Fieldhouse,"
says Williams. "There will be additional time for recreation, intramural sports, and club sports...and
we may be able to offer additional
and more varied Physical Education classes."
Kohlberg's $2.4 million donation
is expected to finance construction
as well as maintenance for the center for 10 years. Schall anticipates
minimal disruption as a result of
the coming construction, which he
describes as relatively standard and

simple. Indoor Courts ofAmerica
will facilitate the construction bidding process which will begin in
the coming months.

Passes Resolution To Increase
Diversity in Tenured Positions
by Emily Shartin
After an hour of deliberationlast Friday, faculty members voted unanimously to pass a resolution intended to increase the number of faculty of
color at the College. The resolution, introduced by the Cultural Diversity
Task Force, reads as amended: "For the sake offurthering Swarthmore
College's community and educational values, the faculty endorses that
all Departments and Programs in the College, with the help of the Administration, take necessary and appropriate steps so that within a decade we may see a significant increase in the racial and ethnic diversity
offaculty hired in tenure-trackpositions well distributed in all three Divisions of the College."
The Cultural Diversity Task Force, chaired by Professor of English Peter
Schmidt and Gender EducationAdvisor Karen Henry, decided last fall to
focus on faculty hiring as an issue. They were particularly motivated by
widespread student concern over departmental hiring practices, formally
expressed in a letter to Provost Jennie Keith last year that criticized the
general lack of focus on the issue of increasing faculty diversity. The
letter was signed by members of the Swarthmore Asian Organization
(SAO), the Hispanic Organization for Latino Awareness (HOLA), the
Swarthmore African American Student Society (SASS), and the Diversity Umbrella.
Members of the task force were also alarmed by statistical information
indicating that of a 158-memberfaculty, there are currently only 20people
ofcolor in tenurable positions, and only 10 of these faculty members are
actually tenured.
Taking their lead from the 1995 Summary Report of the Task Force on
Diversity in the Academic Community
which included the somewhat
ambiguous recommendation that the College "hire more culturally diverse faculty"
this year's Cultural Diversity Task Force stated its specific belief that "one of the best ways to increase the Swarthmore faculty's
'cultural diversity' is to hire more faculty of color."

The yet-to-be-named center is

team, and his esteem for our physical education faculty, he...felt it

life," Bloom says.

Heart of Hate Speech Debate

by Min Lee
Last Friday, a pamphlet entitled "The Holo-

caust Controversy: The Case for Open Debate"
was randomly distributed to select students,

faculty and staff on campus. The pamphlet,
written by Bradley Smith of the Committee for
Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH), asks students to "investigate the Holocaust controversy the same Analysis
way they are encouraged to
investigate every other historical controversy,"
suggesting that widely-accepted beliefs about
what happened during the Holocaust are greatly
overstated. In particular, it questions whether
the Nazis ever carried out a systematic plan to
exterminate the Jewish people.
The stuffing, according the mailroom staff,
was done by an unidentified student in a seemingly random fashion. Not all students received
the pamphlet. In addition to stuffing student
boxes, the pamphlet was distributed to the religious advisors, President Al Bloom, and the
English and Sociology/Anthropology departments. Copies of the pamphlet were also found
on carrels in McCabe Library on Monday night,
and on tables in Parrish Parlors on Tuesday
morning.

The incident provoked a strong response in
the college community. The impact upon the
Jewish community in particular was evident.
t "Lam saddened by the distribution of this sort
of propaganda at Swarthmore College," remarked Cheryl Cook, Director of Hillel, "This
is clearly an assault on the integrity of the entire Swarthmore community."
"I can't believe that someone decided to bring
up such a painful topic by anonymously distributing pamphlets around campus," lamented
Jacob Krich 'OO, Facilitator of Ruach.
The recent occurence strikes at the heart of
the recent debate over the effectiveness of the
College's speech code as well as the national
debate over offensive speech. It also marks the
latest in a series of incidents where anonymous
offensive speech was directed towards a specific section ofthe campus community. Towards
the end of Fall semester, an unidentified student sprayed "Fuck Fag" with shaving cream
on a mirror in a Mertz bathroom.

inherent difference in nature between the two.

"It makes no promises or guarantees, express or
otherwise, that it will undertake efforts to ferret

Most college speech codes are extremely
strictly framed, as is Swarthmore's. The code
does not attempt to qualify hate speech in any
way, simply sweeping it under the broad umbrella of "harassing expression." Under the existing guidelines, even if the perpetrator is identified and the case in concern is deemed
adjudicable, the College Judicial Committee
(CJC) must ascertain that further proceedings
will not endanger free expression before the case
can go forward, letalone if the violatoris anonymous. The code also focuses on face-to-face incidents and urges that both parties exhaust all

LIVING
Crummy Advice
THE BEAR (as told to KATIE MENZER)
Dear Bear,
I am a science-minded type of gal. While most
of my fellow Swatties were conceived out of
the love between their parents, I was constructed out of amino acids in a test tube in my
parents' laboratory. My vocabulary is restricted
to words that rhyme with electrophoresis. My
greatest aspiration is to someday get assimilated by the Borg.
I didn'trealize when I applied to Swarthmore
that the term "liberal-arts" is synonymous with
"pansy-ass." If I had known thatI was going to
have to spend four years of my life reading lyrical verses about violets and teddy bears, you
can bet your sweet haiku I'd be knee deep in
slide rules and pocket protectors at MIT by now.
But it's too late. I'm here and I'm stuck in
this stupid English class. I think it's called
"Contemporary Visualizations of Me, Myself,
and the Other: A Critical Study of the Religious
and Feminist Identity of 14th Century Prussian
Cinema." People keep on throwing around
terms like "onomatopoeia," "intentional fallacy," and "Shakespeare." I have no idea what
they're talking about. I'm afraid I'm going to
fail and never fulfill my dream of becoming a
urologist. What should I do?

Thanks,
Sue Blime
Dear Sue,
I feel for you. Biology, especially the anatomy
of animals of the wooded lands, is my first love,
but I will do my best to help you.
I have not had the opportunity to attend many

English classes, mostly because they tend to
be on the second and third floors of the PAC,
and it is hard for a bear without opposable
thumbs to shimmy up the drain pipe and hang
on the window sills for that long. But luckily, I
do have some insight into your English classes.
You see, the majority of the students I maul
and devour are English students. Unlike the
science students who understand the laws of
nature and the food chain and, therefore, run
away when they see me bounding toward them,
the English students try to "talk" me out of eating them. They want to discuss my childhood
and my motivations and determine what psychological dysfunction could have driven me
to this state of existence. I try to explain to them
that sometimes a bear is just a bear, and I'm a
bear. But they rarely accept it, so I chew off
their heads first to get them to stop talking. Anyway, after eating them, I normally search
through their backpacks for those Otis
Spunkmeyer muffins (the 20 grams offat make
my coat smooth and luxurious and the plastic
wrap, decorated withthe student's highlighters
and some liquid paper, make great hand puppets) and read through their class notes while
I'm snacking.
I've noticed that there are three universal
truths that can be applied in your interpretation
of any work you might be studying for any
English class.
First, If there is an image of something dying, be it animal, vegetable or mineral, it is obviously a reference to Christ.
Second, if the image you are discussing is
longer than it is wide, it is obviously a phallic
symbol.
Third, the monster in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is nothing more than a 9 ft. penis running around Europe.
So, Sue, that's it. You're now as knowledgeable as everyone else in your class. Good luck
in medical school.
Dear Bear,
I'm having problems staying awake while I'm
reading. The minute I open the book I begin to
feel drowsy and invariably end up with my head
on my desk and the book on the floor. I've tried
drinking coffee, "actively reading" by taking
notes and highlighting, and repeatedly thrusting a sharpened pencil deep into my thigh as I
try to work. Nothing seems to be helping. Do
you have any other suggestions?
Yours truly,
Sleeping with the Enemy
Dear Sleeping with the Enemy,
You've simply got to change your study habits. When you fall asleep while reading, make
sure your head is resting securely on your open
book. Then, as you are sleeping, let the wondrous natural process of diffusion take effect.
As the laws of diffusion dictate, things flow
from a greater concentration to a lesser concentration. Knowledge will flow from the book,
which has a greater concentration of knowledge, to your head, which has a tragically lesser
concentration of knowledge. By the time eight
hours roll by, you'll be as smart as the book
you were sleeping on.
If you're still unclear on the concept, you
might want to ask Sue. She's good at this sort
of stuff.

BEBE MILLER:

Dancing for a Better
World, Inside and Out

by Elizabeth Cho
photos by Chris Callis
Half an hour before the doors opened for the Bebe
Miller Company's performance last Saturday, students
and off-campus residents alike were already lining up
in the Lang Performing Arts Center. And not without
reason.
The choice of Bebe Miller Co. as the curtain opener
to FebFest, an annual month-long series of cultural
events, could not be more fitting.
Ms. Miller's extraordinary ability to reconcile dynamism and elegance, the ease with which she juxtaposes
the fluidity as well as the scupltural potential of the body
form, at the same time demonstrating an impressive thematic breadth, is a profound tribute to the all-encompassing spirit of FebFest.
Miller's dancesranged from the anguished to the peacefully spiritual; they explored a widerange of issues such
as war, social assumptions, and the Lord.
The excerpts from "The Jimi Hendrix Project," the first
piece performed, were filled with motions of violence
and grace. It began with the relaxed sounds ofHendrix's
voice talking as a single black man slowly raised his arms.
Then, as the electric tones of Hendrix's version of "The
Star-Spangled Banner" filled the room, other dancers
rushed onto the stage. The dance was filled with both a
sense of desperation and a strange kind of joy
jerky
kicks and punches sliced the air, but when the electric
guitar mellowed into "Izabella," Ms. Miller and a black
male dancer moved in playful, sultry synchronization.
With a return to the anguish, dancers then ran onto the
stage, transforming their bodies into various shapes with
the sounds of Hendrix.
"Going to the Wall," a work in progress, was performed
to the sounds ofrap, silence, and Ms. Miller's voice talking about dancing, living, and language. The piece is theatrical in the way it illustrates emotions and social dynamics
a woman is pushed down, an Asian female
taps the shoulder of a man intent on seducing a white
woman, a man pushes his pelvis against a female who
turns away. In therap, questions like, "why don't we have
White History Month" were asked while a white woman
placed her feet on a black man with herhand on his bowed
head. The choreography was especially powerful when
all the dancers lined up in the front of the stage and the
audience could see their individual human faces. In silence, each dancer contorted his or her body in an ex-^.,»i.^.,iC t«T CT

still interested in making things; I was an art major... At
Earlham, I was studying music, drama, art, history, music
theory so taking that foundation backwards into what
I knew about dance seemed timely. I also went to a master class with Merce Cunningham (an abstract choreographer) and the shock of his vision at that time was...
important for me.
Liz: How does your African-American heritage affect or inform your work?
Bebe: My heritage does not go away. It doesn't mean
I'm only limited to one thing. I think my AfricanAmericaness is very much a part of me and my work.

The last piece of the night, "Blessed," was filled with
uplifted hands and airborne dancers. Performed to the
Australian a capella group, The Caf6 of the Gate of Salvation, the piece was less frenzied than the other two.
Spatial relationships symbolized the dance's spiritual
theme; the sequences where dancers embraced or lifted
each other were reminiscent of how God is often said to
carry people. There were moments of sorrow or confusion in the piece, as shown in the jerky movements of a
dancer that often seemed close to falling. However, she
was always caught by another dancer before she reached
the floor. As a testimony to joy and faith, "Blessed" was
exhilarating to watch.
The night before the performance, I sat down in
Sharpies with Bebe Miller for a short interview. I was
struck by her voice, which reminded me of the way storytellers should sound. Although she had just taught a
ninety minute dance class, she was friendly and thoughtful. When she spoke about dancing, her hands and feet
moved expressively to illustrate her words.

Violinist Chang
Shows Maturity
Beyond Her Years
by Mark Tong
Few violinists in the present day have truly understood the idiom of
vocal bel canto as profoundly as the 17 year-old Sarah Chang. Born in
Philadelphia and raised practically around the world, Chang returned to
the Academy ofMusic lastSaturday to play Max Bruch's Violin Concerto
No. 1 in G minor, with Wolfgang Sawallisch conducting the Philadelphia
Orchestra. For many times and again, she proved that despite taking the
stage with musicians of more than twice her tender age, she was able to
interpret music in not only a graceful but also dominant style.
Her delicate approach to the very first note of the evening charmed the
audience with delight. Subsequently and throughout the first movement
(Vorspiel: Allegro moderato), she examined the piece with more prudence
than flair
a strategy rarely adopted by young prodigies like her. As she
built up the atmosphere, she placed more efforts into the development of
Bruch's lingering theme rather than the flamboyance of each individual

note.

Chang handled the transition to Bruch's second movement (Adagio) with
exceptional clarity, despite the fact that the composer connected the second movement to the last notes of the first without stopping as if it were
an improvisation to the first movement's reprise. Her violin's articulation
was so eloquent as if she was speaking Bruch's words from inside her
soul. As she started phrasing the mellow second movement with a touch
of poetry, she not only took the music to its operatic and lyrical entirety,
but also fulfilled her comprehension of bel canto
the beautiful song.
After a brief pause to end the second movement, she boldly took the
lead in the third (Allegro energico). Her carefully directed crescendos were
accompanied with great attention to details and tone colors. The elevation
to forte more than fulfilled the expectations on dynamics brought about
during her volumerestraints in the first two movements. As sheread through
the rest of the piece, a notable air of virtuosity motioned inside the sell-out
Academy. After a gallant stride to the finale, she was rewarded with five
full rounds of standing ovations.
Her magical exploitation of rubato and efficient phrasing brought back
our memories of Jascha Heifetz, while her relentless techniques reminded
us of Niccold Paganini. Yet, it was her sensibility of sound and her love of
music that created her, and subsequently her music. In short, her performance at the Academy ascertained her position as one of the foremost
musical interpreters of our time. As The Los Angeles Times sangher praises
in 1993:" ...an ear-opening virtuosity, an unfailing and articulate musicality and a natural performer's instincts for unselfconscious showmanship.
At this moment, she is a phenomenon; in time, she could become a treasure."
Miss Chang began to study the violin at the age offour. She made her
Lincoln Center debut with Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic
when she was eight, and has since performed with almost all major orchestras around the world. She can be heard exclusively on EMI Classics.

Replacement

A good many critics
have said The Replacement Killers is a bad
movie, and I don't disagree, but calling it bad
doesn't quite get to the
heart of the matter. More
Altered States accurately, I think that it
Patrick Runkle
misses the mark; it is neiB
ther a fully-realized Hong Kong action movie
nor a competent Hollywood one. It exists in some
kind of never-never land between the two, never taking any chances to develop its own identity. The result is substanceless and disappointing.
Chow Yun-Fat stars as John Lee, an L.A. hitman
who gets into trouble when he refuses to shoot the 7year-old son of a cop who killed the brother of his
mob boss (Kenneth Tsang). Lee tries to flee the country, and goes to Mira Sorvino, who specializes in
forged documents, for help. So, it's your basic hitmanand-helpless-chick-on-the-run-from-innumerablebad-guys flick.
The sad part is that Chow, who in his Hong Kong
films displays tremendous range, is forced to sit around
this entire movie with a gun in his hand acting moody.
His character sucks and is completely undefined, and
apparently most of his dialogue was cut due to his
relative weakness with English. It's like a Dirty Harry
movie where Dirty Harry forgot to show up.
The film's weaknesses could not be clearer than in
an action sequence when Chow and Sorvino are
beseiged in her run-down apartment building by numerous hitmen and must shoot their way out. This
sequence is not appreciably differentfrom the part of
A Better Tomorrow 2 where Ken (Chow) and Lung
(Dean Shek) are trapped in the exact same predicament. But whereas in A Better Tomorrow 2 you know
exactly why and how Chow is passionately busting
his way out and taking down dozens of bad guys, in
The Replacement Killers the sequence (besides being
directed by music video director Antoine Fuqua with
a lot less visual prowess than John Woo) has no heart,
no justification, and no real effect on the rest of the
movie.
The Replacement Killers is a pretty big disappointment, but, if it does one thing, it will hopefully bring
more people to view some of Chow's sterling Hong
Kong work, like Hard-Boiled, Full Contact, City on
Fire, and God Of The Gamblers, as well as the Better
Tomorrow series, which never ceases to amaze me.

New Crime Prevention Law Provokes
Fierce Opposition on Campus
by Wendy Kemp
In February 1997, the Accuracy
in Campus Crime Reporting Act
(ACCRA), or HR 715, was introduced in Congress by Representative Duncan (R-Tennessee) and
former Representative Schumer
(D-New York). This act is intended
to amend the Campus Security Act
(CSA) of 1990, which mandates
complete statistical reports for campus crime. Theaddition ofACCRA
would mandate the release of all
details ofcampus sexual assaults to
the public, including victims'
names.
ACCRA had 63 co-sponsors,
among them Pennsylvanian Representative Curt Weldon, whose district includes Swarthmore. In addition, HR 715 was sponsored by a
campus crime lobbying group, and
supported by various journalist or-

ganizations.

ACCRA contains multiple facets,
many of which would improve and

reinforce the original CSA. However, many feel the negative impacts of disclosing the details of
sexual assaults would outweigh any
potential good.
If ACCRA is passed, crime logs
from the campus police will be
opened to the public within twentyfour hours ofany incident. In addition to the details of the crime, access to the names ofall victims, witnesses, and accused offenders will
be unrestricted. All campus disciplinary hearings will also be open
to both the public and the press. "It
will have a devastating effect on all
colleges and the right to privacy that
all sexual assault victims have,"
says Anya Freiman 'OO, co-President of Swarthmore's Feminist
Majority.
News of HR 715 has provoked a
flurry of reactions on campus.
Brendan Nyhan, co-President of
Swarthmore's College Democrats,
has started a petition. "College
Democrats believe strongly that this

is wrong," states Nyhan. "Victims
of sexual assault deserve privacy in
reporting and adjudicating their
crimes and we hope that our petitions will help change this bill before it reaches the floor of the
House."Detractors worry that making the
details of sexual assaults a matter
of public record might prevent
some instances of assaults from
being reported altogether.
"Assaults are currently under-reported for a variety of reasons,"
says Samira Mehta 'OO, co-Coordinatorfor Swarthmore's Friends of
Survivors, "including feelings of
shame and responsibility for the assault on behalf of the survivor.
Opening the records would severely reduce the number of assaults reported. It is difficult
enough to report an assault to the
authorities, never mind opening it
to public scrutiny."
Mehta adds that stereotypes and
misguided judgments on the part of

the community may accompany
added public scrutiny. "The public
censure that can occur in a society
that tends to blame the victim and
the possible accusations of having
over-reacted," warns Mehta, "are
more than a survivor of sexual assault should be asked to bear in order to report an assault. Fear of that
added burden would significantly
reduce reported cases of assault,
here at Swarthmore and at other
colleges."
While no date has been set for action on HR 715, some discussion
has taken place concerning the incorporation of some of ACCRA'S
provisions into the Higher Education Act.
The Higher Education Act is expected to be introduced in the
House mid-March. Meanwhile, the
petitions continue. "[Although] the
ACCRA is not currently under consideration," Nyhan says, "we are
gathering signatures against it for
when it does come up."

Balancing Act: Hate Speech or Free Speech?
from page Al
have the resources
to pursue this
option. But ironically, it may already be doing much more than a
civil society.
Compared to the law, college
codes pale in comparison. Hate
speech, let alone anonymous hate
speech, is barely adjudicable. In
recent years, the Supreme Court has
taken a very strict interpretation of
the First Amendment. The Court
has relied heavily on the "fighting
words" doctrinewhich arose out of
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
which defines the term as any
again, face-to-face challenge that
qualifies as "an unambiguous invitation to brawl." A driving force
underlying the Court's philosophy
is the fear of discrimination based
on content, or what many First
Amendment absolutist term as
"thought control." The court focuses on the behavioral aspect of
hate speech, often interpreting it as
conduct, avoiding so-called "content-based" regulation at all costs.
The Stanford hate speech code, already narrowly framed, was ruled
unconstitutional because it singled
out speech that is "intended to insult or stigmatize an individual or
small group of individuals on the

basis of their sex, race, color, handicap, religion, sexual orientation, or
national and ethnic origin."
Nonetheless, anonymous o'

concern.
The
recent

even anonymous
hate
speech, mainly
because
the
pamphlet does
not even qualify as
harassing speech
hence adjudication
remains a distant impossibility
yet the effect is no less hurtful.
Pamphlets like Smith's
which are written in a rationaland calm tone
advocating historical revisionism, have always been a headache
for Jewish

prouns

like the Anti-

Defamation League (ADL) because they take advantage of the existing legal "loopholes."
The student who distributed the
pamphlets in the mailroom was not
violating any school rules either,
according to President Bloom.
The latest incident and the subsequent response perfectly illustrates the uneasy tension between
the contradictory desires to preserve free speech and protect the
victims of hate speech.
An over-arching theme emerging
from both the college speech codes
and the law
although at varying
is an extreme sensitivdegrees
ity to the possibility of inhibiting
freedom ofideas and in some cases,
the belief in the marketplace of
ideas
an idea favored by the Supreme Court as well the concept
that in a competitive "market" of
ideas, bad ideas will eventually be
eliminated.
"As disgusting as it may be, I suppose it's their right to do so," said
freshman Steve Farneth in response
to the pamphlet, "although cluttering our mailboxes with the stuff is
probably not the most tasteful procedure."
"A heated and perhaps offensive
exchange is sometimes the only
way to establish one's position, and

mutual, if uneasy understanding," writes David Browne
'9B in his column "In the Right,"
also appearing in this issue of The
Phoenix.
Even RUACH, in a letter sent to
the administration and several campus mediaoutlets refuting the pamphlet, conceded that the student
who distributed the pamphlets was
fully entitled to do so.
On the other hand, the effect of
incidents of this kind is salient.
PresidentBloom, himself Jewish,
issued a forceful statement objecting to the content of the pamphlet.
"I find the questioning presumably
of whether or not the Holocaust
took place a morally reprehensible
line of argument," he said, "for I
think it is unqualifiably proven that
it did, and it was one of the most
tragic and horrendous events in
human history, and to question its
occurrence, in my mind, is to fabricate an argument in order to express personal prejudices and a personal anti-semitic agenda."
The Diversity Umbrella board
resorted to a rather inflammatory
means to get its message across.
Outside of the admissions office, it
posted signs labelled with racist and
homophobic slogans, along with a
explanatory note that reads "Weito come to a

come Prospective Students: Did
you know that a student has to attack you with one of these phrases
twice before the hate speech policy
can be put into effect?"
A solution to the problem is not
imminent. In recent years, a group
of minority legal scholars have
sought to incorporate anti-racist
speech legislation into the law with
limited success. Their analysis, relying heavily on emphasizing the
personal pain suffered by the victims and criticisms of the Supreme
Court's
ahistorical
and
which
decontextual approach
they claim overlooks the disparity
of power between the perpetrator
and the victim
has been effectively stonewalled by First Amendment absolutists.
The College's Diversity Task
Force has vowed to look into the
speech code in the near future. The
administration is still investigating
the recent incident.
The only thing thatremains definite is that, whatever solution does
arise in the end, it will be result of
numerous concessions and compromises on the part of both sides
involved, and even then, the balance
will not be permanent.

GW is an affirmative

nected on only 27% of their shots.
Swat is in fifth place in the East Division, just
one win behind Haverford who is 3-9. While the
team will not advance to the play-offs, they could
play a role in determining which representatives
of the East will. Muhlenberg (8-3, Ist place) and
Ursinus (7-5, 2nd place) still remain on the
Garnet's schedule. With a 6-6 record, the
Shorewomen occupy third place and could stand
to benefit if the Garnet were to upset one of the
top teams.
Swat hosts the Bears from Ursinus Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. in Tarble. Next Thursday at 7
p.m., they take on Immaculata in a non-conference match-up before winding down with
Haverford for a 6pm start of a double-header with
the men.

Women's B-Ball Edges Out Bryn Mawr,
Still has Dismal 2-10 Conference Rank
The Garnet picked up its second conference win
this week, beating Bryn Mawr 58-40. A tight contest with Washington, however, resulted in a defeat. The team is now 6-13 overall, 2-10 in the
Conference.
The Mawrters, perennially at the bottom of the
Centennial Conference's East Division hosted the
Garnet last Saturday in the teams' third meeting
this season. The Mawrters this time had their
feisty point-guard back with them, who was previously out with a dislocated shoulder. Poor
shooting on Swarthmore's end kept Bryn Mawr
in the game for a while: at the break, the score
was 27-23 in the Tide's favor. However, the Garnet quickly pulled away as they found their chemistry and executed their plays. The team succeeded in increasing their defensive intensity and
pressure on the ball, forcing many turnovers and
garnering numerous steals. Jean Quinn '99 led
the' Garnet with a career high 18 points and 11
boards. Heather Marandola 'Ol and Kristen English 'Ol each chipped in 13 points.
Swat traveled to Washington College in an effort to avenge an earlier 68-43 loss at home which
the Shorewomen inflicted in December. The
Garnet jumped out to a 4-0 lead, but fell behind
as they tried to follow Washington's frantic tempo.
Trailing 21 -16 at the half, the Garnet cut the deficit to 2 points with 2 minutes remaining. They
could get no closer though, as Washington's center stepped behind the arc and hit her first three
of the night. The big basket rattled the Garnet
who could not convert on the offensive end and
were forced to foul. The final score was 45-38.
Quinn posted a game-high 16 points and pulled
down 10rebounds to lead Swat. English added
eight points, Marandola 6, and Michelle Walsh
'9B had 6 points and 10 boards.
The Garnet forced 25 turnovers in the contest
and had more steals than WC. No faults could be
found with the team's defense which held the
Shorewomen to 20 points below their average.
The deciding factor was the offense: Swat con-

win, 15-8, 15-6. The third win was posted
by Kemp at second singles. Losing the first
game 8-11, Kemp struck back to win the
second quickly, 11-2. At this point the other
matches were over, and the score was 2-2.
Whoever won the next game would win the
match. The game was the hardest, with rallies lasting minutes and both teams and
spectators watching the match to see which
school would win that coveted third point.
After a long and exhausting match, Kemp
triumphed 11-5. Third singles was played
by Noelle Goodin 'OO, who played extremely well despite the fact that it was her
first foray into the singles arena. Goodin
fought long and hard, but ultimately lost
2-11,8-11.
With a heavy-duty week coming up, the
team is ready to better their 3-1 record.
Both this Saturday and the following Sunday, the team has all-day tournaments.
Tuesday and Thursday will find the badminton women traveling to Bryn Athyn and
Albright to decide who walks away as the
conference champs.

Track Teams Place First,
Second at Own Invite
The Swarthmore Men's and Women's
Indoor Track Teams hosted a five way
meet this weekend, playing host to Mary
Washington College, NYU, Muhlenberg,
Allentown, and Bryn Mawr. Neither
team gave an exceptionally surprising
preformance, but each fulfilled their expectations. The men placed first, while
the women placed a strong second to
Mary Washington. The men have won
this meet for the past three years, and
the women have placed second to Mary
Washington each of those years.
It was a tight race for first for each of
the teams. The men needed victories in
each of the final two relays in order to
guarantee victory, and the women were
knocked off by 16points, 136-120, leaving third place NYU a long way back
with 76 points.
When it came down to the final relays,
which could have propelled Mary Washington to victory, the men's runners
slammed the door with convincing victories in each. The 4x400m team of Mason Tootell '99, GordonRoble '99, Keith
Gilmore'Ol and Dave Brummer '9B won
by a solid five seconds, while the
4xBoom, to add sweetness to the meet
victory, blew away all the competition.
The men also had many strong individual performances. Tootell won the 55
meter hurdles while Swarthmore came
within a foot of sweeping the jumping
events, with Steve Dawson 'OO winning
the high jump and Julian Haffner '9B
placing first in the long jump on the final jump of the day. Dawson placed a
close second in triple jump.
Brummer took first in the 400 meter
dash. After Graham Lucks '9B won the
1500m, Roble and Marc Jeuland 'Ol
placed second in the 800 and 5000,

m

respectively, though there was much confusion in the 5000, as the officials miscounted the laps of several runners.
The women ran a solid meet, but were
without two of their top distance runners,
including captain Danielle Wall '9B.
Swarthmore might have been able to
overcome their Mary Washington jinx
with those two runners and the inevitable
points they would have scored, but it was
moot, since both were out of town.
Danielle Duffy '9B won the 400m,
while CatherineLaine '9B swept the 55m
dash and hurdles with Stephanie Herring
'99 placing second in the hurdles.
Desiree Peterkin 'OO scored a second
place jump in the triple jump. Anne
Baumgartner 'Ol placed second in the
shotput while Sarah Jay 'Ol took second
in the 1500 meter run.
The Swarthmore entry of Duffy, Herring, Sari Altschuler 'Ol, and Vanessa
Agosto 'Ol blew away second-place
NYU in the 4x400m relay, though without their two top distance runners, the
women failed to capture the 4xBoom.
Both track teams have had solid indoor
seasons to date. They kicked off scoring
meets this semester by hosting
Millersville three weeks ago. Swarthmore was overwhelmed by the Division
two program, but showed good promise
for competing against other Division
three schools. Two weeks ago, the team
drove up to Massachusetts to participate
at the Wesleyan Invite, where both teams
claimed fourth place out of 17 teams. In
that meet, Strodtbeck won the 1000
free run and Peterkin won the triple jump.
Friday, Swarthmore hosts another five
way meet, as Widener, Lebanon Valley,
Ursinus, and Gettysburg make the trek
to theLamb-Miller field house. The rare
Friday evening meet starts at 5:00 p.m.
and will run through 10:30 p.m.

Men's B-Ball Breaks School Record for Consecutive Losses
By Pat Donaghy
The men's basketball team eclipsed the school record
for consecutive losses with their 22nd in a row after
dropping two conference games this week. Swarthmore
lost to Ursinus 93-72 Saturday and followed with a
75-55 loss at Washington to bring their record to 0-20
on the year. The Tide were blown out in both games
and have lost by ten points or more 16 out of the 20
games on the season.
The Tide struggled to put points on the board early
against Ursinus. Swarthmore only managed 6 points
in the first 13 minutes of the game en route to a 38-23
halftime deficit. Any hopes for a second half comeback was squashed in the first two minutes of the second half as the Bears scored the first 9 points of the
period to build an insurmountable 47-23 lead. The
game then became a shootout with both teams forgetting about defense as each team scored over 49 second
half points.

One bright spot for the Tide was the unexpected scoring from sixth man Joe Culley 'OO, as he lit the Bears
for a career-high 18 points. Classmate Cassidy
Westbrook chipped in with career highs of 14 points
and 8 assists. Westbrook and Tim Schofield '99 each
hit three three-pointers in the last two minutes to close
out the game.
In an attempt to shake up the starting lineup and hopefully to provide the team with some life which it was
lacking against Ursinus, Josh McKinley 'Ol, John
Delatush '9B, and Culley were handed their first career starts against Washington. Each team was 12 of
27 shooting in the opening half, but fouls initially hurt
the Tide, allowing Washington to go to the line 22 times
in the first half.
On the other hand, the Tide's foul shooting remained
awful as they hit only 1 of 7 shots from the foul line for
the entire game. Washington led 38-26 at the half. The
second half was almost identical to the first 20 minutes as Washington took advantage of foul shots and

cruised to the 20 point victory.
Culley had another superb game, earning a doubledouble with 12 points and 12 rebounds. McKinley and
Delatush gave hopes for an inside game, combining
for 20 points. Through the aid of foul trouble, Washington held Schofield and Greg Holtmeier 'OO to just
two points on the game.
On the year, Tim Schofield continues to rank as one
of the top scorers in the conference, averaging 15.9
points per game. Mike Schall '99 is the leading
rebounder at 5.1 per game. Purdy is second in both
categories with 8.0 points and 4.9 rebounds per game.
With just three games on the schedule, including two
against playoff teams, Swarthmore's best chance of
winning a game will come down to the final contest
against Haverford next Saturday. The Garnet's last
game against Haverford ended in an agonizing onepoint loss. Swat will travel to Dickinson College tomorrow before entertaining Muhlenberg College
Wednesday.

Swat Swimmers Smash Ursinus
byJillßelding
Swarthmore swimmers were on their
feet, fans were standing, and Ware Pool
echoed with applause. Tsong "Bull" Lin
had qualified for the conference meet in
the 100 butterfly. Earlier in the meet,
Kevin O'Neil had madethe cut in the 50
freestyle, while Nik Johnson had swum
fast enough in the 200 freestyle. With
these races, the entire men's team qualified for conferences. The Ursinus meet
was success with the scores as proof. The
men's and women's teams both trampled
their opponent, 126-65 and 124-65 re-

spectively.
Wednesday night's meet against Washington College held the threat of another
close loss for the men and women of
Swarthmore. On paper, the meet was
goirtg to be tense, and that was only if
the coaching staff could guess
Washington's plan of attack. After many
personal and season bests, the meet
turned out in favor of the Garnet, 11688 for the men and 113-92 for the
women.
Swarthmore's women began the meet
with 1-2 punch in the 400 Medley Relay
with the team of Becca Howes-Mischel,
Jenny Harvey, Cathy Polinsky and
Kristen Robertson victorious. Molly
Marino, Erica Rosenthal and Mari
McCran continued to show their strength
in the distance events, letting only one
Washington swimmer sneak into the top
four during the 1000 freestyle.
Swarthmore's sprinters also displayed

As a freshman, Alejandro Montero 'OO spent his
season against the mat. He won less than halfof his
matches. The long string of defeats had taken a significant toll on him. "I was beaten, both physically
and emotionally," said Montero, "I was ready for
the season to be over. Instead of becoming discouraged, however, Montero saw an opportunity to improve.
His painful debut to college wrestling was not the
first time Montero suffered disappointment while
competing. One of the primary reasons for his wrestling at college was to avenge a his own loss at his
high school state championship. His match decided
the team state title.
Driven by a burning desire to redeem his past failures, Montero set out to do something different. After his freshman season, he began training with
heavier wrestlers. Even when the semester came to
a close, he continued training while he was on summer break. From his home state of New Jersey,
Montero drove to Swarthmore to workout with
Coach Ron Tirpak once a week. His commitment
was apparent.
And all the blood, sweat and tears have not gone
to waste. This season his match win-loss percent
has shot over .500. He has become a consistent wrestler for Swarthmore, often competing at higher
weight classes to help the team overall.
A key aspect in his improvement may be his relative newness to the sport. Montero only began wrestling during his junior year of high school when his
gym teacher noticed his potential. Unlike many
wrestlers who began years earlier than him, Montero
is still fresh to the sport. He has yet to reach his full
potential and continues to learn.
Another motivating factor is the tight knit nature
of the team. Montero derives a great deal ofenergy
on the mat from his deep sense of connectedness to
his teammates. "Because the close nature of the
sport," Montero noted, "the social aspect is one of
the most valuable things to me." He wants to perform well for his team, as well as himself. Montero
credits his training partner, Sean Lewis 'OO, and his
captains, Pete Balvanz '9B and Alec Stall '9B for
encouraging him. As quickly as Montero is to praise
his teammates, they are even quicker. "He is inspiration and someone who pushes me bit harder in
every practice," said Balvanz.
Montero looks forward to the future, both this season and next. His hopes center around his team's
performance at the conference meet. Montero believes their chances are good for improving theirrank
in the conference. Montero will be wrestling up a
weight class (177 lbs) and is optimistic about his
showing. He hopes to win his division. Eventually,
his dreams reach farther, to an All-American. Until
then, Montero will continue to wrestle and enjoy the
adrenaline rush he receives from winning.

ARE ACADEMICS TOO IMPORTANT AT SWAT?

Stopping To Smell the Roses
by David King
As I headed toward Sharpies for brunch
one Saturday last semester, I ran into a
friend and struck up a casual conversation
with her. We entered Sharpies together, got
some food, and had a leisurely and enjoyable brunch. As we prepared to leave, I
mentioned in passing that I was heading
up to the plant sale; since she was, too, we
agreed to walk up together. An hour later,
two small house plants in hand, I thanked
her for coming with me and waved good-

Understanding that made me realize
something else, something very scary: I
don't appreciate my friend. Not enough.
Not in the way I should.
That experience hit me like a brick,
prompting me to wonder: do we, as students ofSwarthmore College and all that
comes with that
truly appreciate the
people we interact with every day? Be they
close friends, professors, RA's, Sharpies
checkers, or whoever else... do we take
them— their mere presence, their kind
words, or even their quick greetings— for
granted? More importantly, when we walk

—

they are at our disposal?
The answer to all these questions, I believe, is: not enough.
Two summers ago, when asked whether
he had any words of wisdom for me as I
prepared to head off to college, my cousin
said earnestly, "Don't forget to have fun."
How silly, I thought at the time. How could
I possibly forget to have fun? Isn't thatwhat
college is all about?
Looking back, little did I realize then how
appropriate those words of advice would
seem now, especially at a place like Swarthmore, where a trip to the mall or dinner
out are rarities, and venturing to a movie
theater is almost unheard of. Granted,
there's a reason we bear down on ourselves
academically; we all have a great deal of
work, amounts that at times suffocate us,
and we want to dothe best we can. That is,
arguably, what Swarthmore is all about,
what catapulted us to the top of the socalled rankings and what, for better or
worse, governs our way of life here.
"Here at Swarthmore," they say. "we like
to think we've got it a11... Unfortunately,
we lack one of the most fundamental aspects of a healthy college life: Swarthmore
students have no school spirit."
I agree. And I think it's sad how many of
us— aside from those who merely are apathetic by nature— don't make a concerted
effort to tune into the radio show, go to the
intriguing talk, or simply support our
friends, classmates, and hallmates who
have spent many months preparing for a
concert or production— especially considering the number of us that came in here
with a livelier, more enthusiastic disposition, but let it fade somewhere along the
way.
There's a song lyric from the movie Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory that
goes, "If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it." I wonder how
many of us stop and take the time to do
just that.

My friend, "Deeper," the source for last week's column, discovered that side B of the tape he sent me
was devoid of sex. His tiny voice activated recorder
had on after he head turned over the tape the voices
sounded familiar, but the topic had lost in scandal focus. Still, ifDeeper is to be trusted, here is what was
on the tape, in case the dialogue interests readers of
the Phoenix.

B: Is there any chance we can get to Camp David
this weekend? Can't you take a few briefing books
and some academics and do some policy talk and golf?
Or maybe we could find someone plausible to invite
who will help us raise a million or two for the new
defense fund.
A: I'm trying Hill, but with three dinners this week,
a head of state visit, and trying to read the new CEA

He really got juiced up the last time we had him to

he is in to exploring. Wish we had more social power
on our side than the religious right. You know that
the animals—Elks, Moose, Lions and so on are all
dying? But not the Christian right; Anglicans are dive

nothing we can print anyway. What did Sandy suggest?

Seems he think neo-liberal economics and war are

how he thought he had Hitler figured enough to manipulate him, whileall the time Hitler was setting him
up to be murdered as an excuse for the Anschluss. I
think Saddam is Hitler, he's two steps ahead of your
general staff in dirty strategy. That's what my head
says anyway.
B: OK—maybe he is more than a rat. He's crafty—even a fox. The point is we want to separate him and
all his WMD. If he gets in the way, bye-bye. But we
can't do with US forces. No support at home or
abroad, at least not enough to do the job. I think the
military still do trust me anyway. So, what about
outsourcing the job? There are some new outfits like
Executive Outcomes. For a price, usually rather modest
and remember Hill the market is competitive

Be serious. We are talking about Iraq. It is a dangerous country, heavily armed and with no real internal
opposition to Saddam since his Republican guard attack took out our CIA operation in the North.
B: Right, we couldn't use any little outfit that only
works in poor developing countries. Let the UN do
their outsourcing by hiring such guys. We are a big
power. We can only outsource with competent firms
that will deliver. But there may be one. I'm not sure,
but I was thinking of calling Boris to get his advice.
H: Are you nuts. He just gave a speech echoing
that Saddam loving Primakov. He won't help you—not as long as Russian military weakness is less a problem for him when we are tied in knots over the Iraqi
debacle.

B: No, listen Hill, I think there is angle that Boris
would be willing to listen to, maybe even help. Remember when we were pouring illegal funds into his
election campaign through the IMF? Well, recall how
he got to use those funds for his re-election. Remeber
the IMF and the OECD countries sent the money with
the alleged purpose of assisting in the so-called transition. Remember how he did his laundering?
H: Sure. They were channeled through banks to firms
controlled by ex-KGB mafia, and then filtered back to
his campaign. Everyone kid in College knows that. Are
you thinking of threatening to expose him —create a
"Boris-gate" unless he takes a hard line on Iraq?
B: No. I was wondering if this DOD idea of
outsourcing is a plausible one. Then what we need is a
private sector firm capable enough to do the job. What
I was thinking is that we get Boris to put us into touch
with the serious folks running the Russian mafia. People
who keep their word, never talk, and have access to
loads of excess equipment from the old Red army. We
make than a good offer. A contract. They do the job as
a private firm, and we lament that the UN and outsiders
cannot intervene to protect Iraq because they are a rogue
state. Say we give the Russian mafia 10% up front,
15% when they invade, and the balance when we have
proof that Iraq has been sanitized. Our Black accounts
at DOD/CIA have enough to cover thatright now. Anyway that's the idea the kids at the NSC were kicking
around after hours last night. I don't think Sandy buys
it, I know Madeliene would object, but it is just the sort
of thing I would have done in Arkansas. Remember
when we use public/private ventures back there. In those
days the idea worked better and was less visible than
all this Republican talk now. I almost get sick when I
hear Congress urging public/private partnership. All
that Dick Armey and those greedy bastards really want
is public money for their own industries. It is just a
new way for Congress to help their supporters cozy up
to the public trough. But, here, in international affairs,
we could do an honest public/private venture. One that
would work—or certainly more likely to get the job
done in a quick effective way. And with no public backlash. The more I think about it the more it grows on
me. So, Hill, what do you think?
B: The only thing I can see growing on you at the
moment is not a public part. I think you are off your
rocker. You are the domestic President. Domestic experience does not transfer to the international area. Keep
your mind on medicare and social security and leave
Madeliene to solve the international stuff. She's no lawyer like Warren. She's tough. Let Sandy run the idea
over to Strobe and if he doesn't put into a black burn
box, then let State and DOD play with it. But

Lack of Spirit of Service
Hampers Campus Groups
Take a look at any application of a prospective Swarthmore student,
you will simply be taken aback by the extraordinary amount of talentand
the breathtaking diversity of interests present.
The same rule applies even more so for an accepted Swarthmore student
after all, we are talking about the cream of the crop.
But a very strange phenomenon occurs after these precocious beings
arrive on campus. The stellar credentials don't quite carry over. Granted,
everyonefeels the buzz at the activities fair: ultra-eager, eye-bobbing freshmen fire questions at rapid-fire speed; mailing lists get filled within the
blink of the eye. First meetings usually generate pretty good turnouts. But
then the enthusiasm starts to dwindle steadily. Attendance at meetings
becomes scant; people ask to be taken off the email lists. Except in the
case of athletics, theresimply isn't much of an overlap between high school
and college participatory patterns.
So what exactly happened to all those class presidents, club chairmen
and newspaper editors-in-chief?
Part of this is a natural process. The first semester of college is overwhelming for everyone, not matter how strong your high school background. And as people gradually settle down into a rhythm and adjust to
their new environment, they realize that unlike in high school, one neither
has the time nor energy to do everything. For many, academics are allconsuming enough.
Part of it is due to the lack of incentive. There is no such thing as "graduate school suck"
well, there is: it's spelled G-P-A.
Now that they're facing an immense time and energy crunch, most people
as our friends down in Kohlberg would say
maxiprioritize so as to
mize their level of utility. The focus is on emotional and physical wellbeing. Things that don't contribute significantly to that end are sacrificed.
What one will notice is that as people settle into their own niches, those
activities/interests that remain are usually those that are essential on a
fundamental level, ones that reflect deeply cherished beliefs or passions.
The student pol who also played soccer and edited his high school newspaper will end up only heading the on-campus branch of his preferred
political party. The high school abortion activist who played violin and
volunteered at an elderly home will only become actively involved in ProChoice Task Force.
In other words, they find themselves somewhat hemmed in by their respective spheres of self-interest. And in the process, their sense of service
is watered down. Don't get us wrong—plenty of people are doing community "service." All those people whose personal ideologies are founded
upon grassroots level, hands-on political involvement still put in countless hours working in underprivileged ghettos. So what do we mean by
service here? Service, in the truest sense of the word, means temporarily
suspending one's self-interest for a worthy cause, or rather, to be more
specific, looking beyond what matters to one the most.
And campus life has suffered because of this diminution in the spirit of
service. Smaller and especially groups that are highly political or ideological can manage, but bigger organizations such as student government
and the student newspaper which are less ideological and require the coordination of a broad range of skills and talents take a significant toll.
These also happen to be groups that spend more time under the limelight
and are subject to constant scrutiny. Outsiders often use them as indicators to gauge the quality of the institution as a whole. Hence the very
reputation of the College is at stake here, and yet student involvement in
these very organizations is lagging.
But the solution to the problem is simple. These ailing institutions can
be revitalized if everyone decides to pitch in, if everyone justpushes just a
bit further. The aggregate of a charismatic orator, a good organizer and a
talented policy wonk is an effective student government. The combination
of good writers, editors, artists and layout designers produces a professional paper. And bear in mind, it's not just the College's reputation that's
at stake. YOU are an integral part of the College. YOUR reputation is
commensurate with the College's reputation. Student Council is YOUR
student council. The Phoenix is YOUR student newspaper.
So dig deep within yourself and rekindle that same fervor that made you
want to do everything in the first place. Whip out that campaign speech
that you wanted to give during the senior class president elections but
never did, sweep the cobweb off the drawing pad that's been sitting in the
corner of your room for ages.
Remember, YOU make all the difference.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Guess? Ad Contains Misinformation Winds of Change
Need to Blow
on Sweatshop, Labor Policies
To the Editor.
The full-page ad on the back page of last
week's Phoenix featured inaccurate claims
about Guess? Inc. This advertisement, like others that have run around the country in the past
few years, heralded Guess?'s supposed antisweatshop policies. Although their claim that
initiated a sweatshop monitoring policy is accurate, they have not followed through with the
programs.
Several years ago, Guess? was added to the
"Trendsetter's List" by the Department ofLabor, a list which includes companies taking an
active stand against sweatshop labor. However,
they were taken off of it in 1996 when federal
investigators discovered that they were violating basic labor laws. A representative of the
Department of Labor, Marvin Krislov stated
that their advertisements "impl[y] that the Department of Labor has in some manner certified Guess?'s compliance with the Fair Labor
Standards Act. As you are aware, that is not

the case."
A sweatshop is any workplace in which
one or more of the basic labor laws are broken. These laws include minimum wage,
overtime compensation, child labor laws,
home labor and working conditions. In
1996, Guess? was cited for having sweatshop conditions in several Los Angeles factories. Some of the violations found were
the use of home labor and trying to break
up attempts to unionize. When Guess? was
accused of these things, the company
threatened to send 75% of its manufacturing to Mexico, where labor laws are not as
strictly enforced.
Sweatshops, contrary to popular belief,
are not a thing of the past. Guess? should
not hide behind its false claims and labels.
As consumers, it is important that we do
not buy into their lies.

Add a Little Spice to Your Life
To the Editor.
We are writing to express our shock and disappointment at the extreme lack of discerning
taste demonstrated by your movie critic in his
unenlightened panning of THE film achievement of our century, Spice World. Let us first
state that we hold the unparalled and simply
rockin' musical genius of the Spice Girls to be
self-evident. That being said, we would now
like to demonstrate the many ways in which
"Memo to the Spice Girls:Kiss My Ass" (Living & The Arts, Jan. 30) was nothing more than
cheap slander and viscious libel, obviously a
manifestation ofmale insecurity in the face of
Girl Power.

1) The Spice Girls' tour bus is anything but
"gaudy"; the bold Union Jack motif merely
reveals their noble patriotic fervor. Furthermore, anyone (i.e. Scary, Sporty, Ginger, Posh,
and Baby) who can make a double-deckerbus
appear "twice as big on the inside as it does on
the outside" clearly has an uncanny knack for
interior design.
2) In his sarcastic reference to the "rigorous
daily schedule" of the Spice Girls, your critic
fails to acknowledge that they were cruelly
refused even one morning off. Careful polling (statistics available upon request) indicates
that should the Spice Girls pause for even a
single moment in their mission to spread the
message of Spice, life as we know it would
cease to exist.
3) "Bad outfits"??? Uh, whatever. Last time
we checked, big shoes, tongue piercing, and
lollipops were, like, totally in.
4) Although he admits to "not [being] very
familiar with the Spice Girls," your critic is
nevertheless presumptuous enough to question
their commitment to their music. We challenge
the reader to name another rock sensation that
would race across London with a bomb
strapped under their bus just to avoid disappointing their fans. In terms of commitment,
we'll let the Spice Girls speak for themselves
in quoting, "I'm giving you everything."
5) "Mental lightweights." The Spice Girls?
Did we watch the same movie?

ture, best actress (Scary, of course), best
hair... Spice World has it all." Spice World
is a monumental celebration of pop's
coolest band ever, bursting at the seams
with raucous fun, adventure, and most of
all, Spice. Keep a glass of water nearby.
People everywhere, spice up your life!

Through Sharpies

To the Editor:
It almost goes without saying thatFood Ser-.
vices at Swarthmore is a source of much student grumbling. However, beyond the mostly
unsuccessful crusades of a few individuals,.
complaints have resulted in very little action.
In the hope of changing this situation, a group
of students gathered on Sunday, February 8,
to discuss the problems people have with the .
current system offood services as well as possible solutions. Outof this meeting, our group,
Students United to Reform Food Services
(SURFS), was formed to effect change in the
current situation through concerted group action. While action in the past has mainly been
through the efforts of concerned individuals,
we believe that a visible campaign with popular backing and clearly enunciated goals could
be more successful. At the meeting, we promulgated four simple goals:
•

1) Extend the $3.75 dinner credit in Essie
Mae's beyond 8:00pm.
2) Maintain adequate levels of hot food in
Sharpies until its scheduled closing time
(7:15), not 30 minutes before.
3) Reduce the proportion of fried food on
the menu.
4) Reorganize the Dining Services Committee to resemble the College Planning Committee with senior staff members, faculty, and
students charged to set goals for dining services and hold frequent periodic assesments.
It is our hope and goal that these reforms
will be enacted as they reflect the concerns
of a good portion of the student body.. We
welcome further support in our struggle to
ensure that this is the case. Stay tuned for.

Counterproductive Hate Speech Policy
Infringes on Constitutional Rights
The administration and the Swarthmore
community have recently taken yet another
misguided step toward creating a "better"
campus community in the form of a "harassment" (hate speech) code designed to
protect both individuals and groups from
speech or expression that is taunting, vilifying, or degrading". Such codes in fact do
nothing to address the underlying causes
of hate speech, cause resentment amongst
those that might otherwise express their
"offensive" views, and trample on the Constitutional rights of every person who sets
foot: on this campus.
The U.S. Supreme court recently (1992)
ruled on a case involving just such an act
of "offensive expression." In R.A. V. v. St.
Pant, the court found a statute barring
speech that "arouses anger, alarm, or resentment in others..." to be unconstitutional
on the grounds that it "prohibits speech on
the basis of the subjects the speech addresses." Further, the court found that "[the
existence] of bias-motivated speech does
not justify selectively silencing speech on
the basis of its content." Of course, much
as I hate to admit it, there are some forms
of speech that are and should be regulated.
In fact, the same court ruled that "obscenity, defamation, and fighting words may be
regulated..." so far as there is "no realistic
possibility that regulation ofideas is afoot."
Yelling "fire" in a movie theater or making a credible threat to kill someone might
fall within the legitimate role of such
speech regulation, but for a college that
supposedly valuesintellectual diversity and
free expression to try to regulate speech just
because it might offend or harm someone
mentally is, well, offensive.
Why is it that, in addition to $30,000 a
year, students have to give up so much
when they come to Swarthmore? It seems
clear that at least three of the first ten
amendments are infringed upon or completely violated by college policy alone
(never mind our own government). Although dorms are college property, it seems
a little draconian that any dean may enter
and inspect a student's room ifthey believe
"

that "any College regulation is being or has
been violated." There is no process for establishing probable cause; a dean can theoretically just wake up one morning and
decide that he thinks you may have a halogen lamp and kick your door in. The Fourth
Amendment means nothing here. Hey,
wanna bring a pistol back over Spring
break to go to the local range (which is
perfectly legal under PA law)?Forget it
you can offer to keep the thing in a nuclear
bomb-proof safe at Ben West, and you'll
still (pardon the pun) be shot down. The
Second Amendment means nothing here.
And now, you better watch what you say
about group X or person Z, because they
might be offended, and you'll find yourself subject to "serious sanctions."You may
only exercise yourFirst Amendment rights
insofar as the College says you may. Perhaps the administration should examine
Tinker v. Des Moines in which the Supreme Court ruled (in relation to primary
and secondary schools) that "it can hardly
be argued that either students or teachers
shedtheir Constitutional rights to freedom
of speech or expression at the schoolhouse
gate." A right is no longer a right when it
is followed by a list of exceptions.
Those that support speech codes fail to
see the greater good that is established by
leaving all the rights of students, particularly the right to free expression and
speech, to be exercised at their discretion.
When issues of, say, race, ethnicity, or
sexual orientation are brought up in any
forum, an exchange of ideas that is limited to those that wouldn't "harm the target" is not going to be nearly as revealing
or productive as a discussion that takes
place withoutthe burden of a "hate speech"
code holding back the tongues of thosethat
might otherwise express their true feelings.
A heated and perhaps offensive exchange
is sometimes the only way to establish
one's position, and to come to a mutual, if
uneasy, understanding. Although the
college's code attempts to address this issue, there is far too much subjectivity and
room for interpretation within it to guar-

So, you want stuff done around campus. There are some things that bother you to
no end, and you walk around steaming about them all day. You want to study in
McCabe 'til 2am but can't; you want a double moka latte tall, skim, and
half-flat at 8 p.m. but can't get one; you want a real bowl instead of a paper
one but there are none; you wanted International Politics but didn't get it;
you like the Arboretum's Jungle Fever but not that much; and you can't seem to
find a way to let the powers that be know. Well, we have created a way. This
Questionnaire will be reported directly to the President and his staff. They
will be able to see, in concise terms, some of the things that we want and need
done around here. And the funny thing is they WANT to help! Really! They
told us so just the other day. But they can't help if they don't know what we
want. 50.... Fill it out. Cut it out. Stick it in the envelope. Watch your
world change around you. It's that easy! Brought to you by the new Student
Council.

antee that there will not be problems.
People need to learn on their own how to
exercise their rights responsibly; having it
outlined for them in an incomplete and inconsistent manner is ludicrous and insulting.
In any free society, there will be some
that abuse the rights that (I hope) we all
value so highly. But when people use their
First Amendment rights in ways that some,
or even most, people find offensive, this is
not an excuse to curtail them. It is merely
the small price we pay, as individuals and
a society, for the freedom that so few
people in this world have. Any attempt to
infringe upon this freedom, however
minute, is a slap in the face to every person that values their freedom of expression
and constitutional rights in general. As
Voltaire once said, "I disapprove of what
you say, but will defend to the death your
right to say it." This should hold true here
at Swarthmore more than anywhere else,
and any speech policy is a perfect example
of how NOT to make social progress or
change peoples' ideas.

U.S. Must Act Decisively In Iraq
How did a victory that appeared so decisive in January
1991 turn so sour? There are a
number of ways to think about
this. First, Saddam's stonewalling against weapons inspectors, combined with the
willingness of the global community (or Iraq's apologists)
to believe that he would cooperate at every turn, played a
key role. Second, the splintering of the Gulf War coalition
has also played a strong role.
The French and Russian governments have chosen to back
powerful corporations and individuals in their respective
countries in their bid to capture the economic rents accruing from the sanctions imposed by the United Nations
against Iraq. These rents will
come through lucrative contracts. Third, and perhaps most
importantly, it appears that the
American position has shifted
in favor of a complete military
strikethat would finally solve,
at least militarily, the thorn
Saddam Hussein's government has become. To understand the significance of this
last and vital shift, let's go
back to the Gulf War.
It's 1991, and General Colin
Powell's strategic and philosophical hero, Karl von
Clausewitz, holds intellectual
sway at the Pentagon. The brilliance of Clausewitz's thinking, distilled by military thinkers such as Colonel Harry
Summers (rtd.), and crucial to
the rebuilding of the morale of
the American war machine after Vietnam, is seen in the
maximum force doctrine that
powered the international
community to victory in the
Gulf. Now, pan ahead to fall
1995. General Powell is re-

Global Affairs

Russian President Boris
Yeltsin recently said something
very funny. He claimed that if
America went ahead and led a
military strike against Iraq for
her refusal to comply with
United Nations weapons inspectors, it might trigger World
War HI. Ten years ago, that
might have elicited nervousness in Washington. Today,
with the knowledge that
Russia's army cannot win a war
in Chechnya, that a number of
her generals collaborated to sell
her weapons to the highest bidder (e.g. belligerents in the
Yugoslav war), and that her
troops are underfed, unpaid, of
low morale and on the edge of
a mutiny, Washington can only
laugh.
With each passing day, the
possibility of renewed warfare
against Iraq by the United
States rises. Depending on
whom you ask, reactions to the
looming war vary. When questioned, South Africa's foreign
minister Alfred Nzo declined to
support the U.S. (and United
Nations) position that only a
non-conditional surrender of
access, by Iraq, to its weapons
storage sites would secure
peace. China, France and Russia more or less share South
Africa's position, insisting on
a diplomatic solution.
On the other hand, the British, Canadian, and Spanish
governments back the American position. They have offered
to either provide a platform for
aircraft, or have contributed
troops and weapons systems.
Regardless of the position
taken, one point all parties
agree upon is the need to decisively tackle the seven-year imbroglio the Iraqi question has
turned into.

tired, and a new thinking is
permeating the Pentagon and
the general defence establishment. A group of defence intellectuals, among them Edward Luttwak, are working
hard to change the essential
military doctrine of the United
States. Luttwak, against a
background call for a shift in
focus to soft issues such as environmental and cultural
forces in international relations, began to advocate a shift
towards siege warfare that is
directly opposed to the
Clausewitzian style of warfare
the original Gulf War embodied.
In an influential Foreign Affairs article, Luttwak argued
that because of the changing
demographics of American
society, loss of life would no
longer be tolerated by the
American public.
As New York Times reporter
Eric Schmitt put it, Luttwak
was essentially codifying intellectually the idea that the
military was becoming queasy
about death and dying. In essence, theorists like Luttwak
helped intellectually cripple
Americas military. What
Luttwak and other theorists
advocating is a rethinking of
military doctrine in favor of
prolonged (and questionable)
sanctions regime failed to see
is the linkage between freedom and the bloodshed of
American troops. That, in fall
1997, the United States government was unnerved enough
to vaccinate the military
against anthrax and conduct in
conjunction, with New York
City, exercises to test civilian
response mechanisms to biological warfare, is evidence of
a radical change in political at-

titudes. Finally, recognition
has begun to seep into the
Clinton Administration that
there are still military threats
to global stability, and these
need to be tackled, and decisively so, regardless of the
immediate perceived cost to
America.
At the end of the Cold War,
commentators argued the
time had come for America
and the world to reap the benefits of peace, the so-called
peace dividend.Some went as
far as predicting the end of
conflict, history and ideology.
While intellectually elegant
and admirable, these theorists
have failed to come to terms
with the fact that human nature does not change. Men
will, ifgiven the opportunity,
attempt to take up arms to dispossess others around them.
To prevent that, other men
must find ways of checkmating such regimes, and permanently so. The time has come
to checkmate Saddam
Hussein; the next Gulf War
must cease in downtown
Baghdad, after which international occupation forces will
supervise the reorganization
of the modern Iraqi state,
have oversight over elections,

Iraq will no

ordinary Iraqi citizen has the
inalienable right to live a
good life; the last seven years

America should give that gift
to them by conquering
Saddam Hussein once and for
