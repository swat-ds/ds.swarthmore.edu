Prospective Student Council presidents debate ideas, abilities
BY JACK KEEFE

of 2020. After Apollo referenced financial aid
issues he would like to see addressed in the
2020 campaign (need-blind international

Vying to take the mantle of soon-to-be former Student Council president Peter
Gardner 'OB, Paul Apollo 'O9; Yongjun Heo 'O9;
and, communicating over Skype from Spain,
Randall Johnston 'O9 gathered with students

admissions, lowered summer expected contribution) as part of a financial aid question,
Heo discounted that sentiment to focus on
"immediate" things.

in Kohlberg last evening to discuss their
qualifications and ideas for the presidency.
Apollo and Johnston have both served on
Student Council before (as student groups
advisor and campus life representative,
respectively), whereas Heo is a (potential)
newcomer to student government.
"We're all here to make Swarthmore better. If we disagree in different petty ways,
we're all here for our love of Swarthmore ...
our love for Swarthmore is founded on
things like Quaker ideals and consensus, so I
hope tonight we can get close to something
like that," Johnston said in her opening
speech.
The long-term future of the college played
a continual role in the night's discussions.
Both Apollo and Johnston directly addressed
the possibility of having some version of a
"one card" system in Swarthmore's future (to
get into dorms or rooms, to do laundry, etc.),
which Apollo admitted would be "very
expensive."
However, Apollo stressed that the cards
would be useful not only for reasons of convenience, but for safety as well. "It's more
than being able to see your friends in dorms
what happens if you're being followed?
Wouldn't you like to be able to go into a
dorm?" Apollo said. "I know it sounds like
fearmongering, but it's a very important
point in considering this."
One of Heo's primary platform ideas that
he stressed throughout the night was that the
president should gather a list of specific
requests from each organization on campus
at the beginning of the year and "prioritize"
them for Student Council to address. He
stressed a unity between the organizations at
Swarthmore, wishing for 'all organizational
[every]
leaders to have a group meeting
two or three months."
Candidates frequently invoked the 2020
campaign in their debate rheotirc "Next
year, we're going to be deciding on a capital
campaign, we're going to be deciding on
spending several hundred million dollars,"
Apollo said during his opening speech.
However, the candidates appeared to
have some disagreements as to the relevance
...

...

Later, Heo repeated this opinion.
"Obviously, the bigger goals, the bigger
issues are for the 2020 campaign ... the goals
that I've listed, I think are completely feasible. The only thing stopping me from doing
that is myself," he said.
A question asked by Anson Stewart 10 as
to the greatest difficulties the former council
members had when acclimating to their position touched on sensitive issues of diversity
at the college. "The most difficult part for me
was learning aboutracial issues. I come from
Maine, the whitest state in the union ... my
school had three minority students and they
were all adopted Koreans," Apollo replied.
He referred to valuing the anti-oppression
workshops that student council attended as
being useful, and being frustrated about the
"passive marginalization and racism that I
can't actually detect."
"I think I've done everything I can to
learn about that," he said.
Heo, while expressing positive remarks
as to the anti-oppression workshops, nevertheless believed that they "weren't enough."
"In terms of racial issues
having two
workshops when there [weren't] workshops
before is a step in the right direction, but
these dialogues can't stop and shouldn't stop
when [the workshop] is over," Heo said.
"Two days is not enough to undo 18 years of
...

racism that I've encountered in southern
Indiana. Two days isn't enough."
On a number of points, the candidates'
concerns plainly converged. All three, for

example, expressed that there would need to
be a vocal debate as to the potential commercialization of the Swarthmore Inn project in
response to a question from current student
life representative Alyssa Work 'OB. Johnston
emphasized the idea of keeping the hotel
component "in the family," to not let it be
taken over by a major hotel corporations.
"We're students and socially conscious, so
we don't know what sort of bad business
practices of ungreen business practices that
they may have," Johnston said.
Candidates did seek to differentiate themselves in response to a question from an
unidentified student who asked what made
each candidate different from the other.

Katherine Koch Phoenix Staff

Peter Gardner (second from left) mediates the debate between student council presidnetial candidates Randall Johnston (on screen), Paul Apollo and Yongjun Heo.
Apollo cited his "experience with student
government," "practical skills and the relationships with the administration [useful to]
bring my agenda and through me the agenda
of Student Council to the highest level." In
his answer, Heo referred to Pemon, a health

organization he founded. He cited both his
founding of the organization and his engagement with the IC community (through SAO
and the Tri-Co Institute) as contributing to
his uniqueness as a candidate.
Some tensions emerged in the discussion
when Johnston described her position on
Student Council as 'a little different" from
Paul's due to its inherent "leadership," David
German 'OB asked why Apollo's position was
not one of leadership.
"Please do not allow me to insinuate such
a thing!... To be able to work as a team is the
most important thing," Johnston said in
reply, continuing to describe Apollo's position as having a "very specific role" with
groups and the budget, whereas her position
had a "more broad, less defined role like the
president and vice-president."
Apollo replied to this assertion, saying
that, "On top of [chairing the charter committee], everything that Student Council is
doing I was a part of
people on Student
Council aren't limited to their specific jobs.
While my job was [technical], I was the
leader on a committee and worked intimately with people trying to get charters."
Attendees were also attuned to questions
of candidates' executive skills and styles.
Apollo said that "this semester on student
council I've developed a taste for getting
what I push for," mentioning that he had
...

recently had a meeting with Alumni relations to get $2,000 to help offset the cost of the
Halcyon.
In contrast, Randall identified as a "conciliatory person." "I'm not going to blaze
through the rest of student council's... ideals
to get to my own," she said.
In that same vein, Tom Emmons 'OB asked
whatthe candidateswould do in terms of "filtering student input" and taking into
account the pragmatic value of student sug-

i

gestions,

"I've been on SBC for almost two years, so
I'm very used to having students ask me to
do things that I just can't do
I would compromise, even if I couldn't fulfill their goals,
I would take Swarthmore in the direction of
those goals," Apollo said in response. Heo
said that he would need to work the ideas in
a way so that the "finances wouldn't restrict
[them]" and that he would "work with the
...

community we already

have."

"Every single idealistic comment you get
isn't going to be realized because they're in

different directions we can talk with the
administration about how to realize such
goals on a smaller level or to look at things in
a different way," Johnston said.
For those who missed the forum but are
still interested in hearing the candidates
answer the Swarthmore community's questions, an additional Student Council presidential candidate forum will be held in the
ICC big roomat 6:00 p.m on Friday.
Online voting for the election begins
April 19 and continues to April 22, while
paper voting will take place in Sharpies on
April 23 and 24.

Daily Jolt threat provokes adminstratlve reaction
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu

On Tuesday morning, an unidentified
individual threatened violence against
Swarthmore students on the Daily Jolt, an
online forum, according to Dean of
Students Jim Larimore. A student who saw
the post informed the Department of Public
Safety,
which then informed the
Swarthmore borough police and campus
administrators.

"We take all threats seriously, and this
one was no exception," Larimore said in an
e-mail. "Because the possibility of harm
exists, we do not feel that we can make the
assumption that a threat is not serious."
The Swarthmore police responded to a
911 call that was placed, and in conjunction
with Public Safety, began investigating the
validity of the threat. The Cambridge,
Ma.-based company that runs the Daily

THE PHOENIX

Jolt cooperated with the police

investiga-

tion.

"The College contacted the Daily Jolt
and informed them about the message that
had been posted and our concerns,"
Larimore said. "They shared information
with us that enabled ITS to determine the
registered user of the computer from which
the message had been sent."
The Swarthmore police then stepped in
to assess whether the student was a threat.
"Once we were able to identify the student
involved, we confronted him and determined that there was no immediate
threat," said Swarthmore Borough Police
Chief Brian Craig, who was one of the officers responding to the call. "When I left,
the student was under control and was
being addressed."
The threatening post has since been
removed from the Daily Jolt's Web site, and
the student who posted it is under review

in an investigation that will take at least
two weeks, according to Craig.
The details of the threat and the consequences will not be released until the
investigation is complete. "I'm not at liberty to discuss the sanctions that might apply
to a particular individual due to college
privacy policies and federal law," Larimore
said. "I can say, however, that a student
found responsible for misconduct faces
sanctions that range from warning or probation to suspension or even expulsion."
Students were informed of the threat
through an e-mail Larimore sent Tuesday
afternoon, which explained the threat and
the level of seriousness with which the college was addressing it.
Some students who read the posting
before it was removed didn't agree with the
administration regarding the gravity of the
threat. "There was a lot of freshman bashing going on in the post, and [the threat]

April 17, 2008

just seemed like

that except a little more

exaggerated," said Rachel Bell 'lO, who

read part of the post. "It seems like the
administration's reaction was a little
extreme."

Once the administration was informed
of the threat, however, Larimore said it
had to respond. "The college administration does not monitor the Daily Jolt, so we
become aware of material posted on the
Daily Jolt only when students or others
bring it to our attention," Larimore said.
"We do take threats seriously, so when they
are reported we do follow up the best of our
ability and if warranted that includes
informing the local police of our concerns."
This was the first threat of this sort at
Swarthmore, according to Craig, but it was
handled well. "The college was a big help
as was the people at the Daily Jolt Web
site," Craig said. "The threat is now under
control."

Charity Fun Fair comes to the Ville WEEK
BY MARY PRAGER
mpragerl@swarthmore.edu
The 2008 Swarthmore Charity
Fun Fair will take place on Sunday,
April 20 in the Ville, starting with a
kickoff parade. This year's theme is
Carnivale, and everyone is invited.
Hundreds of groups will be staffing
booths at the fair, including charities, non-profits, merchants and
student groups from the college.

Project
Among
them
is
Shingayi, founded by Chengetai
Mahovma 'll and Ashia Troiano 'll,
which "aims to build low-cost environmentally and socially self-sustainable schools in Africa,"
Mahovma and Troiano said in an email.
"[The Charity Fun Fair] gives
various charities the opportunity
to raise money and raise awareness
for their causes," said Marty
Spiegel, Swarthmore Town Center

Coordinator.

Spiegel, who enjoys the ambience and what the fair brings to the
community, is in charge of overseeing music at the fair.
The Charity Fun Fair is run by
the Swarthmore Rotary Club, and
involves hundreds of people from
seventeen committees. Dozens of
groups will be raising money for
their various charitable causes.
For instance, Lions International
of Swarthmore will be hosting a 5k
Fun Run and Walk through the college and surrounding areas.
Members of the Delaware Valley
Bicycle Association will host a
bicycle tour.

"[The Charity Fun Fair]

Also, musicians will be performthe day on three
stages. Proceeds from the fair go to
support roughly 50 charities, Fun
Fair Host Kenneth Wright said.
Student organizations can participate in the fair for free, while

other organizations pay a $25 fee.
Mahovma and Troiano hope to
raise $BOO dollars at the fair to supplement the $1,200 they have
already raised for Project Shingayi.
Mahovma and Troiano founded
Project Shingayi (Shona, a Bantu
language spoken in Zimbabwe and
Mozambique, for "stay strong

together") early in the semester,
and are working on their first project
starting a self-sustainable
school in Zimbabwe.
The project involves buying ten
eco-sanitary latrines, projected to
cost between $2,000 and $2,500,
depending on inflation. The collapse of the Zimbabwean economy
and the subsequent hyperinflation
have made accessing running toilet
water and purchasing food diffi-

cult.

The eco-sanitary latrines convert human waste into fertilizer, so
students will be able to grow their

own food.
At the Charity Fun Fair, the two
will raise money through a "version of bobbing for apples with an
eco-sanitation twist," Troiano said.

Rather than bob for apples in a
generic container, fair-goers will
dip their heads into a toilet.
Along the same lines, visitors
can toss objects through toilet seats
for stickers and other prizes, pick
up an informational brochure or
donate money.
According to Wright, the organizations participating in the fair
last year, which drew a crowd of
5,000 people, raised a total of

parents and students.

$33,000.

Wright helped found the Charity
Fun Fair in 2002, after an inspiring
experience in England. He and his
wife were wandering in Woodstock,
a town seven miles north of Oxford,
and came across a "delightful fair,"
he said.

Wanting to adopt the fair and
bring it to Swarthmore, he spoke to
the organizers, who suggested that
the most successful fairs are short
no longer than four hours
and
crowded
that is, held not in a
spacious field, but rather right in
the center of the community. They
also suggested that fairs should be
packed with entertainloud
ment, activities, fun games and

music.

The

Fun

Fair

in

Swarthmore is organized based on
these suggestions.

"Everybody enjoys it
the
town enjoys, charities enjoy it,"
Wright said.

Students gather around booths set up for the annual International Fair hosted by the 1-20.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Chelsea Clinton to make speech on Swarthmore's Parrlsh Beach this morning on behalf of her mother's candidacy
Swarthmore Students for Hillary
Clinton will be hosting speaker Chelsea
Clinton Thursday at 11:15 a.m. on Parish
Beach West. Clinton will be giving a talk
entitled "Your Future, it's Bright," which
will address Hillary Clinton's policies,
focusing on areas such as health care and
foreign policy, according to Michael May
11, a leader of Swarthmore Students for
Hillary Clinton and an organizer of the
event.

"She wants to hear about Swarthmore
students and answer their questions

4

about why her mother will make the best
president," May said.
The Hillary campaign contacted May
on Tuesday night, and immediately May
and other Hillary Supporters began
working
with members of the
Swarthmore administration, including
Maurice Eldridge '6l, to work out the
logistics.
"I think it will be great for the college
community," May said. "We stress ethical intelligence, and I think it's good to
have all sides represented and be edu-

cated about politics and I think this
event can contribute to that."
The callfrom the Hillary campaign was
unexpected, according to May. They had
originally tried to get Hillary herself to
come, but as
security and

with Senator Barack Obama,
concerns about space made
fulfilling that request impossible.
"I thinkthat it is important to note that
it's not like they're [the administration]
being selective," May said. "This event is
just a lot smaller and so it's a lot easier to
have Chelsea come."

April 17, 2008

Although the event was not announced
until Wednesday, students on campus are
excited for the opportunity to hear Chelsea
speak.

"I think it's a wonderful opportunity
for Swarthmore college and the community at large to have her speak on campus,"
Leigh Elko 10, a Democrat who has not
chosen to support either candidate, said.
"We are a small school, so it is great that
we can host events with impacts as great
as this one has."

Student support integral for presidential candidates' campaigns
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu

Anne Kolker 'OB can pinpoint the
moment when she regained her faith in the
American political system. It came over
three years ago, when she was a newly
arrived first-year at Swarthmore. After
returning to the U.S. from living abroad for
most of her life, Kolker was searching for a
better understanding of the driving forces of
American politics and hoping for some relief
from the cynicism of the 2004 election. She
found this relief when her father sent her
the link to a speech given at the Democratic
National Convention by Barack Obama,
who was, at the time, a relatively unknown
state senator from Illinois. As Kolker
watched Barack Obama speak on getting
beyond partisan politics and unifying the
country, she was brought to tears.
"This is it; this is what I was waiting for,"
Kolker said. "That speech still makes me cry
wheneverI watch it. It was love at first sight,
I guess."
As Obama's popularity increased and he
received increasing media attention, Kolker,
like many other young supporters, began following his career. When he decided to run
for the presidency, Kolker was eager to help
in any way she could and, when the opportunity presented itself, she became the state
coordinator of Pennsylvania Students for
Barack Obama.
Kolker is just one of many politically
active students at Swarthmore who have
become involved in supporting either
Obama or Senator Hillary Clinton, as the
race for the Democratic presidential nomination comes down to states with late primaries such as Pennsylvania."l didn't
quite realize what I was getting myself into

[as state coordinator], in terms of
Pennsylvania actually mattering in a big
way in the spring of my senior year,"

Kolker said.
Six months ago, few predicted that
Pennsylvania would be viewed as a prize of

great consequence in a protracted race to
the party nomination.
But the state is now center stage in the
battle for the Democratic nomination, and
students on campus are jumping at the
opportunity to help their candidate get the
upper hand. Both Swarthmore Students for

Barack Obama and Swarthmore Students
for Hillary Clinton have.
"We have been doing a lot of visibility
work," said Doug Gilchrist-Scott 'O9, a member of Swarthmore Students for Hillary
Clinton who has been doing a lot of volunteering off campus. "That involves going to
well traveled places and waving signs, handing out material and just reminding people
to vote."
Members of Swarthmore Students for
Hilary Clinton are also canvassing the
campus and the surrounding area to talk
to voters about Clinton's policies and to
distribute literature, according to
Michael May 'll, one of the founders of the
group.

"This is it; this is what I
was waiting for. That
speech still makes me cry
whenever I watch it. It was
love at first sight, I guess."
Anne Kolker 'OB
The group has also brought several

speakers to campaign for Clinton on campus including Harriet Cornell, a New
York legislator and the co-director of
Judy
Surrogates for Hillary, and
Lichtman, the Senior Policy Advisor for
Clinton's campaign. Richard Sestak,
Congressman Joe Sestak's brother, also
made an appearance along with other supporters from the local campaign.

While support among young voters for

Clinton is not as widely publicized as support among young voters for Obama,
there is still a significant group of students on campus who support Clinton's
bid for the nomination.
"Obviously it is a little more difficult to
find support on a college campus for Hillary
than Barack, but we have gotten a lot of
interest," May said. "People are very enthusiastic. We have had about 45 people
involved in some capacity so far."
With the Pennsylvania primary less than
a week away, the pace of campaigning has
increased. "It definitely has ramped up,"
May said. "Not only are people a little more
willing to be active in campaigning, we also
have had a lot more prodding from the campaign office to get them volunteers."
Students for Barack Obama have also
been working on recruiting voters and making sure that students have the information
they need to make their decision."We have
been focusing on getting the word out about
what Obama's policies are, letting his ideas
speak for themselves and just trying to
reach as many people as we can," said
Finlay Logan 'OB, the volunteer coordinator

for Swarthmore Students for Barack Obama.
Along with canvassing and phone banking, Obama supporters have attended campaign events off campus. Obama spoke at
Strath Haven High School two weeks ago,
and his wife, Michelle Obama, spoke at
Haverford on Tuesday.
Swarthmore Students for Obama is also
bringing in other key Obama campaigners
this week, including Betsy Myers, the Chief
Operating Officer of the campaign and the
head of Women for Obama, to talk more
specifically about women's issues, as well as
holding a panel ofSwarthmore professors to
talk about the major issues facing the county, like the economy, health care and the war
in Iraq, according to Logan.
"We think that the more people see of
[Obama's] policies, of his experience and of
his leadership style, the more supporters we

can get here on campus," said Jesse
Gottschalk, the coordinator for Swarthmore
Students for Barack Obama.
These events are primarily aimed at students who are still undecided, but the
Students for Obama are still trying to get
information out to everyone who is voting.
"We have literally gone and knocked on
every door on campus and talked to as many
people as possible," Logan said. "We are
really running an information campaign."
This information campaign has been bolstered by the College Democrats, which
helps any students wanting to volunteerfor
the Democratic Party, regardless of the specific candidate. "We are fortunate to have an
organization for each of the candidates,"
said Molly Weston 'lO, the president of the

College Democrats.
Although many see the division of the
Democratic Party as negative, Weston is
glad that so many students are involved.
"It's just a great time to be a Democrat,
especially in Pennsylvania," Weston said.
"After the primary, some of us will be sad
and some will be happy, but either way we
will have a great candidate."
While the Democrats on campus are
still battling towards the nomination, the
College Republicans are looking ahead to
the general election. "We decided
to try
to be an outlet for conservative political
thought," said Kyle White 'OB, a member of
the College Republicans. "We want to get
people involved, so we want to provide
SBC funds, or vans, if people want to bring'
a speaker onto campus or go see a speaker."
Both the College Democrats and College
Republicans
will be watching the
Pennsylvania primary closely, as both
groups recognize that the primary will be a
key factor in deciding the nominees in the
general election. "It's been a fun ride and
I'm really pumped about there only being
seven days left until the primary, so we can
show what we have accomplished over the
past six months," Kolker said.
...

Fall 2007 anti-malaria campaign raises $7000 towards bednets
In conjunction with Madness Against Malaria and bednet distributor
Project Have Hope, Global Health Forum's Fall 2007 anti-malaria campaign
raised over $7,000, enough to purchase approximately 1,500 bednets for the residents of the Acholi Quarter in Kampala, Uganda. Karen Sparaccio, the
founder of Project Have Hope, coordinated the bednet distribution efforts
with help from Acholi Quarter residents Achiro Santina, Akello Paska, Abalo

Baker wins U.S. national shogi championship, club celebrates
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MATT BLEIMAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

Professor Alan Baker, founder of the Swarthmore shogi
club, recently won the U.S. national shogi championship. He
has been playing shogi for over ten years and has been
spreading word of the game to Swarthmore students.
"I would say broadly it is a more aggressive game than
chess and it is a more complicated game at chess," Baker
said. He explained that computers are not as good at shogi
yet compared to chess because of all the additional possible
moves. The complexities of the game have made it difficult

to master. Baker said, "In high level shogi, like shogi that
gets played in Japan, even professional players make a lot of
mistakes so games are often unpredictable."
There is a small but active shogi community in the
United States made up mainly of Japanese ex-patriates,
according to Baker. In Japan, about 20 million people at least
know the rules of shogi or follow it in some form. There have
been attempts to spread the game from the west but it is still
mostly popular in Japan. "I think the main barrier is that it
looks kind of forbidding. Even now I don't know the meanings of the characters so I just had to memorize them," Baker
said.
Baker said he started learning to play shogi when he
went to Japan in 1995 and picked up a pocket set. He does
not have much opportunity to play in the states and gets
most of his playtime on a Japanese website where he can
play real time against other shogi players. He also occasionally plays in tournaments and started the shogi club at

Swarthmore college.
There is an annual U.S. championship open not just to
U.S. citizens but anyone who wants to play. This year, there
were 32 players in the tournament. Baker said that about
three-fourths of the players were Japanese and most of the
others were former chess players. Baker won the championship this year after being ranked 14th out of the 32 players.
"It was something of an upset. There were no players who
were incredibly stronger than me but I certainly was not the
favorite," said Baker. "Last year I was out of the country but
two years ago I played and came fourth which I was happy
with."
The tournament is a knock-out tournament, and there
are no seeds so there is also a bit of luck involved. The tournament hosted five shogi professionals from the Japanese
shogi organization who offered analysis of games, gave commentary and offered tips.
Baker was initially attracted to the game because he
never heard of the game and it was similar to chess so he got
his first set to see what it was. "I have now gotten to the same
strength at shogi that I am at chess and I think shogi is a better game because you get a broader range of positions in
shogi. I think there is more room for improvisation of the
board, and there is a feeling that you can often get back into
a game by playing some good moves," said Baker. He said
that nearly all chess players who learn shogi prefer shogi to

chess. "There is a feeling among chess players who have
been exposed to shogi that shogi is an objectively better
game," he said.
The club at Swarthmore was started three years ago by
Baker, who used to bring shogi boards to the chess club
when he went. "It has waxed and waned in terms of participations and it also depends on the time of the semester but
we have weekly meetings and an e-mail list," said Baker.
"On a good week we will have ten or 12 and I think since the
club has started 30 or 40 people have learned to play and
about a dozen have done it consistently."
George Yin 'O9 discovered shogi when Professor Baker
brought the game to chess club. He then started the shogi
club with Baker when he was a freshman. Students at
Columbia University are also trying to start a shogi club.
There are hopes that Swarthmore and Columbia can work
together to make a shogi club. "If we can get more people in
the club and maybe get the club chartered, we can actually
become the first inter-collegiate shogi club in the U.S. So we
are trying to work harder this semester to get the club
stronger so this is a possibility," said Yin.
Club participation has been lower this semester because
many of the core members who are juniors have gone
abroad. Still, Yin is optimistic because freshman have begun
to show up. He said that the weekly meeting normally has
four to five people right now. The club is looking for more
members so that next year it can start working with stu-

dents at Columbia and organize a tournament.
Baker will teach new attendees the rules and then begin
to play. The game can be played with a handicap where certain pieces can be removed to level the playing field. "As the
person you are teaching gets stronger, once they win three
games you will add back pieces," said Baker. Because of the
nature of shogi, the handicap does not inhibit the better
player from winning but instead can better even the match.
The handicap system allows players of different skill levels
to play together in the club.
Chess Club President Jonathan Estey 'OB has been attending the shogi club when he can. He said that it is interesting
for him because unlike chess, there are very few draws,
there is no real advantage to a side (black or white in chess),
and there are no specific openings that can be played out by
memory. "I think it is really interesting. I'm still learning
and I am a lot better at chess. You have to learn more pieces
than chess but the written pieces aren't as off-putting as I
expected," said Estey.
He said that the game is hard to learn compared to chess
because of the lack of its presence in our culture. "I think if
you took out the culture part they are just as complicated as
each other," said Estey. "Also, because the pieces are short
ranged, there is a lot more strategic planning so there is a
much more frustrating learning curve."
An aspect that Baker likes about shogi is that there are
fewer people who play shogi so the community is much closer. Because of this, it is easier for players to get exposure at
higher level tournaments. Baker's win at the national tour-

Championship winner professor of philosophy Alan Baker
believes that shogi is a more complex game than chess.

nament has given him the opportunity to travel to Japan to
represent the U.S. team.
Estey sees the lack of shogi players as an impediment to
playing the game. "I plan to learn to be decent at shogi. It's
harder because there are few people to play with. Still, he
does not believe the language is a big barrier to learning
shogi. I would say the biggest barrier is finding people to
play with," Estey said. "You can go to chess tournaments in
the United States, to do anything like that with shogi you
have to go to Japan."

NEWS IN BRIEF
Despite lure of admitted students' programs at competing institutions, Ride the Tide set to draw record crowd
The college's population will swell
this Thursday and Friday, Apr. 17 and
18, as more than 300 prospective students flock to campus for Ride the Tide.
Thus far 325 students have RSVPed to
the event with more last minute reservations trickling in, according to
Associate Dean of Admissions Beth
Anne Gluck. Featuring class visits and
social activities such as the "SOCA
Dancehall Study Break" and "IM Indoor
Soccer with the Deans," Ride the Tide is
designed to give admitted students a feel
for Swarthmore should they decide to
matriculate.
"Our goal is to have wide range of
events planned on campus so [prospective students! get a real sense of what
it's like to be a student here," Gluck
said, citing class visitations, faculty lectures, student events, staying overnight
and eating in Sharpies as some of the
experiences for prospective students
during Ride the Tide. "We are really try-

6

ing to give them a snapshot of what it's
like to be a student here at Swarthmore

for 24 hours," Gluck said.
Dean OfAdmissions Jim Bock '9O said
that while the two days of Ride the Tide
are atypical in that they are much more
action packed than that of a normal day
at Swarthmore, they are also exemplary
of the choices that students at the college have to make on a daily basis.
"I let the admitted students know
that this is not a normal day," Bock said.
"All the activities do take place but
rarely do they take place in a single day.
So part of it is realizing you can't partake in all of it and have to make choices," Bock said.
Admitted student Ivana Ng said that
Swarthmore's reputed intellectual rigor
was one of the first things that came to
mind when she thought of the college. "I
think Swarthmore is known as a very
intense school academically, and I guess
that's the biggest thing," Ng said.

According to Bock, Ride the Tide
emphasizes both the academic and
social offerings of Swarthmore, with the
goal of correcting any misconceptions
that prospective students might have

about jSwarthmore.
"We are not all work and no play," he
said. "We want to support positive allegations such as our intellectual vigor
and intellectual vitality, but we also
want to show them that we have fun,"
Bock said.
As in years past, the 2008 Ride the
Tide was organized with much student
input, especially compared to similar
programs at other institutions, according to Gluck. "[Student input] makes
Ride the Tide an authentic experience
and makes it more about student participation than about an admissions show,"
she said.
According to Gluck, the coEege's faculty has also been invaluable in the
planning process. "I think the faculty

April 17, 2008

has been really responsive," she said.
"We know that it's important to students
to have interactions with faculty and
learn about what their departments
have to offer," Gluck said.
Since most students visit their
prospective colleges in the month of
April, it is common that multiple
schools hold their admitted students
programs on the same dates.
This year, Swarthmore's Ride the
Tide is overlapping with similar programs at a record nine other institutions
with Swarthmore often competes for students. These other colleges include the
University
Chicago,
of
Brown
University,
University,
Princeton
Dartmouth College and Wellesley
College. Despite this overlap, the college
is still seeing a record high number of
students RS VPing to Ride the Tide.
"The overlap doesn't seem to be hurting us," Gluck said.

only reason that atrocities like genocide

Republican challenger aims to unseat Rep. Sestak
BY MARA REVKIN

mrevkinl@swarthmore.edu

Three months ago, Gulf War veteran
W. Craig Williams was nominated by the
Delaware County Republicans to chalincumbent
Democratic
lenge
Congressman Joe Sestak (D-Pa) for his 7th
District seat. Williams, a Gulf War veteran and former federal prosecutor in
Philadelphia, addressed an informal gathering of students and district constituents
on Wednesday evening in the Science
Center.

Sestak, a former Navy vice admiral,
defeated 20-year incumbent Republican

Representative Curt Weldon by a comfortable margin in 2006, despite the 7th district's reputation as a GOP stronghold.
President of the College Republicans
Justin Shaffer 'OB took the initiative to
bring Williams to campus shortly after he
declared his candidacy in January.
"Sestak comes here all the time, and we
thought it would be worthwhile to meet
the Republican candidate. If people like
him and want to work for him as the campaign season gets underway, our organization will certainly support that,"
Shaffer said, adding that he is optimistic
about the prospect of a Republican victory in the congressional election next fall.
"This district has been Republican for a
long time. In a way, Sestak's victory was

a fluke because of the Curt Weldon scandal," Shaffer said, referring to Weldon's
alleged influence-peddling with a Russian
oil company on behalf of his lobbyist
daughter.

Sestak's victory was a disappointment
to many conservatives, who, according to
Williams "have no voice at all in the
United States Congress since we lost this
seat in 2006." Williams said he had not
seriously contemplated a political career
until the county's Republican leadership

approached him this winter. "I never had
any real designs on running for office
until the county leadership asked me to
step up," Williams said. The decision to
enter the race was an easy one for
Williams, who draws a stark contrast
between Sestak's platform and his own.
"I just couldn't accept that I was being
represented by a guy who votes with
Nancy Pelosi 98 percent of the time," said
Williams, who plans to prioritize fiscal
responsibility and national security if

elected.

Reinvigorating the economy is the
top issue on Williams' agenda. "When
it takes 70 dollars to fill up my tank, the
price of groceries is up and mortgage
costs are out of control, people need to

doubling down on a bad bet." Rebutting
criticism, Williams said at
Wednesday's event, "We don't bet with

Sestak's

the lives of American troops. There's
more than hope in Iraq, there's actual
success."
Williams said he believes that the war
in Iraq will be viewed favorably by historians. "We came to Iraq not just as patriots, but as true liberators, and in the
process we freed a nation from tyranny.
That is the story that future generations
will tell," Williams said.

might professors.
According to a February 2007 publication by the American Society for Cell
Biology, almost 27 percent of faculty are
coupled with a fellow faculty member.

While universities nationwide are increasingly focused on gaining a competitive
edge in research, athletics, the arts and
social justice issues, they are also increasingly affected by romantic partnerships
among faculty. "Dual-career academic couples," as they are commonly called, are
populating university campuses in growing numbers.
In line with national trends, the number
of UT faculty members coupled with other
scholars is on the rise. Spouses may have
offices down the hall from one another, as
is the case with communications studies
professors John Daly and Anita Vangelisti.
The two have co-authored a book and more
than 13 articles.

Daly said that couples who choose to
collaborate should also assert their intellectual independence. "It's important to

and spend for every conceivable gov-

ernment program."

Williams said he anticipates strong
partisan opposition to proposed budgetary cuts, but is willing to work across
party lines to engineer a legislative
compromise. "I'm going down [to
Washington, D.C.] to solve problems,
and I will certainly reach across the
aisle to build coalitions if that's what it
takes to get things done," Williams
said.
Williams has also drawn upon his
military background

Marine Corps and former membership

home.
While some professors are married
before coming to UT, others meet on campus. Associate English professor Beth
Hedrick said she met her husband, associate history professor Bruce Hunt, while
she was doing research for a paper. "I was

by ornately embroidered
silk shoes, these pointy crescents were lusted after and
perceived of as another erogenous zone on a woman's
body. But what a man did not see was the foot when a
woman took off her bindings, a foot that was severely
deformed, putrid, broken, rotting. Talk about a hot mess.
While the severity of this dualism exists only in the
history books now, it is easy to draw parallels with the
high heels of today. And this heelless heel just seems like
a step back towards foot binding. Wearing high heels
makes the foot appear smaller, elongates the legs, and
forces the wearer to walk in smaller, delicate steps. Not
unlike a baby deer! With years of wearing them, high
heels can start to deform the foot as well, leading to corns,
bunions, blisters and varicose veins, not to mention damage to tendons in the legs. Foot binding for the rich and
inane.
But all the same, I'm not one to completely reject high
heels. They can confer a great deal of power and authori-

The historian Dorothy Ko's revisionist history
on foot binding suggest that foot binding was a choice
fueled by women's desires as dictated by the fashion system. The same holds true today with high heels. But isn't
it largely men who have developed this fashion system?
In that case, how free is this decision-making? Her
account of foot binding also suggest that people viewed
the body, like the mind, as something that could be disciplined and worked in order to achieve their desired goals.
But should these goals be achieved at such a painful
price?

The historian Dorothy Ko's revisionist
history on foot binding suggest that
foot binding was a choice fueled by
women's desires as dictated by the

I don't know how to go about answering these questions. In the end, I guess it's just one of those contradictions that makes high heels so equally repulsive and
desirable. In the meantime, it's finally getting nice out
and the grass is particularly plush this year. Which
means bare feet as much as possible.

Over the next 40 years, he produced "thousands of books, tablets and letters that form
the core of the sacred scripture of Baha'i

for the reconstruction of human society at
all levels: spiritual, moral, economic, political and philosophical."

believing instead that everyone should
search for the truth independently. Even

According to Baha'i.org, in 1852, a
Persian nobleman named Husayn-Ali
"received a vision of God's will for humanity" while in Tehran's most notorious dungeon. In this way, the Baha'i Faith began.
Adherents to Baha'i see Baha'u'llah (meaning "The Glory of God" in Arabic, what
Baha'is now call Husayn-Ali) as the most
recent messenger of God, the latest in a long
line that includes "Abraham, Krishna,
Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus and
Muhammad."
When Baha'u'llah got out of prison (he

aspect of the religion. I also take to the
Baha'i belief in the equality and unity ofall

human beings.
One of the hallmarks of Baha'i is

Baha'i.org, that "there is only one religion,
the religion of God. This one religion is continually evolving, and each particular religious system represents a stage in the evolution of the whole. All of the great religious

God." And, according to Baha'u'llah, Baha'i
is the most recent manifestation of this
divine plan.
In an introductory pamphlet to the
Baha'i Faith, Candice LaCrosse of
Haverford elaborated on the idea of unity of
religion, saying, "Baha'u'llah also explains
that all the religions teach the same truth.
The only difference is that each has
appeared in a different time in history in

then how are people united under this

one has evolved from the other. However, if
each religion appears according to the

Christianity after that of Islam? Now that
Baha'i is the most evolved religion, shouldn't everyone see the other religions as ves-

I find the unity of religion belief faulty

Finally, isn't the unity of religion belief

a touch narcissistic? Here is a person
who, in 1852, freshly released from the
"Black Pit" dungeon, declared himself not
only to be the messenger of God, but on top
of that, proclaimed that all world religions
for the last 5,500 years have led to him and
those who follow his teachings are participating in the most advanced of world religions.

Even though I take issue with the unity
of religion belief, I think that a lot of
Baha'u'llah's teachings, many of which I
unfortunately did not have room to discuss
in this column, are ones from which

Good Asian Drivers
Good Asian Drivers duo aims to provide a voice for queer Asians through their music and poetry.
BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu
In his next life, transgendered slam poet Kit Yan
wants to be a "baaadass," while folk musician Melissa
Li wants to show-up Mr. Mighty to get the girl. The
duo, called the "Good Asian Drivers," bared their most
personal and embarrassing aspirations during their
show at Olde Club this past Monday night as part of
APIA Month. The gig at Swarthmore was one of the
many stops in their 12-week cross-country tour to colleges, queer youth community centers, Asian cultural
shows and "just community spaces," Yan said.
On skill alone, the "Good Asian Drivers" played a
great show of spoken word and folk music. But the duo
also spent plenty of time poking fun at themselves and
connecting with their intimate audience, all for the
purpose of giving a voice to queer Asians. As Yan says
on their website's promotional video, "Queer Asians
need role models, because I don't think Margaret Cho
is cutting it, or Tila Tequila."
Yan, a champion of numerous slam competitions,
masterfully struck a balance between flowery prose
and stand-up comedy. His poems stretched beyond the
regular rabble-rousing to challenge even conventional
notions of queer identity. One poem criticized restric-

tive gender roles, "Gender is birth certificates for
babies born into gender. Housing applications, checkboxes and even getting an email address
this is gender
But most of the time, gender is, fuck you, mind
your own business," while another poem noted problems in the queer community, "You can still hear
butches treat femmes like second-class citizens. You
space at
can still hear women fighting for voice and
gay pride parades."
...

...

"Queer Asians need role models,
because I don't think Margaret Cho
is cutting it, or Tila Tequila."
Kit Yan
Good Asian Drivers member
There was also plenty of comedy in Yan's act. Yan
sheepishly admitted that he went to B school (which,
he had to explain to the audience, meant business
school) and remembered thinking in class, "If more
people bought sex toys, then the price of sex toys
would go down." He then proceeded to perform a poem,
equal parts activism and hilarity, saying, "I do not
wear a strap-on out of penis envy. I wear it because it's
hot. It's pretty, and I like to have sex with it. And of
course it comforts me at night. It reads me a bedtime
story and then it irons my shirt." In another poem, Yan
described his fantasy of being reborn as a hyper-masculine badass. "In my next life, I wanna eat meat, drive

a pimped-out, rimmed-out black hummer SUV."
Alternating with Yan's acts, Li also had her share of

rallying cries and funny self-effacing one-liners, but

hers took a different form. As she explained in one of

12

her songs, "My little red guitar is my weapon of
choice." Li, a singer and guitarist for nearly a decade,
forsook classical music for folk and at fifteen, met and
was heavily influenced by Ani DiFranco.
One of Li's songs, arguably the biggest hit with the
crowd, was "Such a Nice Guy," dedicated to "the lonely straight guy in the back." The song, which Li
described as "like a lesbian anthem," had Li trying to
make a relationship work with a nice boy, while she
couldn't help getting involved with his ex-girlfriend.
When the refrain, "Men just honestly don't do it for
me," elicited a lot of knowing laughter from the audience, Li cried, "I don't understand why you guys are
It's a really sad song. I'm breaking up with

him!"
...

"The assholes who control this
world have boiled down to two
the white man on the left and the
white man on the right."
Excerpt from a
Good Asian Drivers song
One of the duo's big beefs, media representation,
was tackled head on in one of Li's songs. The song

equally indicted mainstream media, "the assholes who

the
control this world have boiled down to two
white man on the left and the white man on the right,"
and those who complain but don't want to make
change. As Li sang, "It's a sad state of affairs when
nobody cares."
In another song, Li addressed both image issues
among Asians and the importance of not selling out,
singing, "They say I'm pretty enough to be on TV, but
I got a girl by my side and she still wants to be with

me."
Li also works in film and musical theater, two additional talents that had their small place in the show.
During the show, the duo filmed one another for a doc-

umentary that they are making about their tour, snippets of which can be seen on their website, enumerating various misadventures that may indicate that Yan
and Li aren't as good of Asian drivers as they think. Li,
who recently premiered her award-winning musical
"Surviving the Nian," also wrote and composed a cute
number for the night, which she called "Good Asian
Drivers: The Musical."
"You pretend to be an angel in front of my
momma," Li complained, while Yan retorted, "I hate it
when you talk about your lesbian drama." It's too bad
the musical stopped there, especially because Yan
described the third act as "a rap off."
Despite performing on a Monday, "Good Asian
Drivers" managed to draw enthusiasm from the crowd
and thoroughly rocked Olde Club. In a fair world,
these two would be all over TV.

Abramowitz 'lO and Greg Albright 10 suffered an early defeat as their boat, known
as the SS Adderly and composed mostly of
inner tubes, capsized before the race even

Last Sunday dawned grey and clouded.
Underneath the trestle bridge in the Crum,
students lowered themselves and their
homemade boats into the icy creek.
Carefully positioning their bodies atop
their seaworthy contraptions, they prepared to chart a dangerous course down
the not-so-raging Crum rapids. A crowd
comprised of students, parents and administrators watched eagerly from the sandy
banks. This wasn't madness; this was
2008's annual Crum Creek Crum Regatta.
Although the morning was cold and the
creek even colder, the participants in the
regatta were quick to get their crafts into

its chance. That was actually a record [for]
how long we could stay in it," Cruz said.
Fighting furiously behind the Albino
Goldfish and the Mighty Duct were LC-4

and SS Second South. "It didn't take very
long [to make], since our boat was made of
an air mattress, storage containers and
duct tape. I think we spent two nights
working on it," Second South crew member Alexandra Israel 11 said. LC-4 and

Second South had their moment to push

But, in the end, the Mighty Duct untangled

At the end of the race, shivering participants and spectators alike were treated to

hot chocolate as Commodore Warner
announced the prizes. "I am very proud to
be a part of the Crum Regatta, which is the

Warner said. The Mighty Duct took the

students drenched in Crum Creek muck.

"If your life were a movie what would be

Concert etiquette needed by all 'Leatherheads' fumbles

ANNA ZALOKOSTAS

Notes from the Underground
While the nearly successful attempt I
made last week to attend four concerts four
nights in a row may not have done much
for the stack of unopened books sitting on
my desk waiting to be read, it did remind
me, often through the figure of the large,
sweaty, swaggering and rowdy Drexel frat
boy, of the unspoken rules of concert etiquette and of why these rules were nonverbally but communally accepted in the first
place.
Though I don't mean to encroach on The
Etiquette Fairy's territory, I felt compelled
by all of last week's mishaps, the faux pas
and the breaches in proper concert conduct
to dedicate this column to the pierced, polowearing boys with the Yuengling, to the
unattractive couple with the wandering
hands, to the solitary boy with the red
waist-length mane who wouldn't tie his
hair back and to the obnoxiously chatty
girls who made sure everyone around
them heard about their desire for Dirty
Projectors to finish their set. Though most
of these "rules" are very commonsensical,
people, it turns out, often don't think or act
very commonsensically.
Firstly, don't push your way to the front
if you don't really want to see the band. No,
seriously, I mean it. If you're going to be up
front and situate yourself right in front of
other people already standing there (me),
you better be having a damn good time and
I better be able to see it. Don't stand there

motionlessly, whining about the opening
band's set, loudly wondering how much
longer they're going to be playing for and
chattering above the music. If you don't
want to see the band that is currently on,
get out. Go to the side. If you're just going
to talk to your huddle of broskies while you
have some brewskies, remove yourself
from the front where I have to look at you

14

while I'm trying to dance and go somewhere else.
If you are over 5'7", do everyone a courtesy and stand a little to the side rather
than the middle of the very front. People
need to be able to see over you. That close
to the stage, you're only creating a visiOnobscuring shadow over the place bigger
than the dust cloud that killed off the
dinosaurs. We are not all as tall as giraffes,
be sensitive to those of us under 5'4" and
stand somewhere that allows other people
to still see.
If you do have a really compelling need
to be toward the front of the stage, say
"please" as you ask those around you if you
can get through. Stepping on my feet and
passive-aggressively elbowing me to try to
break through the amorphously messy
rows is not going to win me over and instill
in me a desire to let you pass through.
If you've brought your camera with the
intention of taking pictures recreationally,
please don't use your flash. It's annoyingly
distracting to both those in the crowd and
the musicians. If you have some sort of
really compelling reasons as to why you
need to turn on your flash and get perfectly non-grainy pictures, please don't take 50
shots per song. That's highly unnecessary
and makes me think you're here to record
the fact that you're seeing the band rather

than to actually see the band.
Sitting down before or between sets is
not acceptable; it's wimpy. If you're at a
standing show and are going to whine
about being tired, then you clearly need to
toughen up a bit or head over to the back
where you can sit on a banister or some
sort of ledge. Sitting down in the middle of
the floor just makes it difficult for those
around you to navigate the space and is,
plainly, just not a privilege that's been
awarded to you. Everyone has to stand, I
don't care if you're tired, so am I. If you feel
like sitting, do it somewhere that's not the
middle of the floor.
On a similar note, if you can't deal with
sweaty bodies jumping on top of you, people's elbows coming in from all directions
crushing your ribs, being kicked or head
butted or shoved around, or if you just generally can't handle the feeling of being in a
human trash compactor and are going to
complain about needing personal space,
then please stay away from the front of the
room. Personal space does not exist on
crowded dance floors, and if you expect it,
then you've been severely misled. If you're
going to complain about not being able to
breathe, leave and find somewhere you

can.

Maybe it was the plinkety Charlie
Chaplin soundtrack in the background;
maybe it was the way the whole world
onscreen seemed to radiate golden light;
maybe it was George Clooney's cheesy
grimace as he got up close and personal
with another actor's armpit. But as the
opening credits of "Leatherheads" rolled,
I began to suspect that this movie was
trying too hard. When I found out that
the main characters were named Dodge
and Bullet, I knew that this movie was
trying to hard.
There's no particular reason not to see
"Leatherheads," Clooney's apocryphal
tale of the origins of pro football, especially if you're the kind of person who
thinks that you've been touched by the
hand of the Lord whenever Clooney
smirks in your direction. There's plenty
of smirking to go around, so bring a
friend. But woe betide you if that friend is
a fan of Cary Grant, because Clooney is
making a bid to fill those screwball-shoes.
Tug and strain though he might, the fit
just isn't right.
Maybe it's because everything that
was made circa 1940 just seems better, or
maybe it's because Clooney just ain't
Grant, but "Leatherheads" is a pale
reflection of the mid-20th century
Hollywood comedies it so clearly seeks to
both ape and recreate. Part of the problem is that it's trying to do both and ends
up paralyzed somewhere in the middle.
There's too much wink-wink, nudgenudge business for any part of the film to
seem remotely sincere, and yet there's
not enough of it to appreciate the movie
as a sharp satire.
"Leatherheads" is a self-consciously
hokey, halo-infused telling of the professionalization of football. Clooney (who
also directs) is Dodge Connolly, MAP
(Most Attractive Person) of a pro football
team in 1925, back when the league rule
book consisted of only four words: Don't
Kill Each Other. Dodge brings college
phenom and war hero Carter "Bullet"
Rutherford (John Krasinki) on board to
raise flagging ticket sales. As Bullet
starts to do the unspeakable
run plays,
stay sober during the game, win, that sort
Dodge misses the old days of
of thing
"Chasing the Cattail," "Pig and a Poke"
and "Crusty Bobs." (No, I don't know
what those things are, either, but apparently football isn't the same without
them). Renee Zellweger shows up as
intrepid reporter Lexi Littleton (cute nod
to the Superman fans) trying to discredit

17, 2008

Bullet's war record. About every ten minutes there's a bar fight, and the plinkety
piano really gets a workout.
All of this is perfectly cute, but nothing in "Leatherheads" is particularly
compelling, unless you count Clooney's
blindingly and unfailingly white teeth. A
few parts do ring true. Bullet's impact
convinces the league to begin standardization, leading to a charming moment
when the poor referee for the Big Game,
so used to the days of Crusty Bobs, can't
get through the coin toss without consulting his brand-new rule book every time
he wants to breathe. But few other scenes
in "Leatherheads" really capture the feel
everyone
of the time in the same way
is far too busy mugging for the camera.

Nothing In "Leatherheads"
is particularly compelling,
unless you count
Clooney's blindingly and
unfailingly white teeth.
This preoccupation leaves the characters with little timefor conflict, except in
the form of a pedestrian love triangle,
with Dodge and Bullet (har har) competing for the scathingly snappy Lexi's
attention. Maybe it's that Lexi's witty
repartee with Dodge is laid on thicker
than Clooney's hair gel, but Zellweger
strikes up more chemistry with Krasinki,
who at least is less smirky, even if he does
throw words like "gee" and "gosh"
around with reckless abandon. Though
hijinks abound, nothing quite zany
enough happens to give "Leatherheads"
the zing it needs to work its way free from
its distancing self-referentiality.
That ham-handed approach ultimately
prevents "Leatherheads" from making
the leap from pleasant congeniality to
wacky fun. This film would have done
better to go fully in the direction of
"Down with Love," a movie similar in
tone and level of smirk but which takes
its gimmick (a send-up of '6os sex comedies) much further. As it is, the artifice of
the whole thing interferes with the comedy in "Down with Love," but the artifice
itself isn't funny enough to propel
"Leatherheads" along. Grant and his contemporaries walked this line effortlessly.
It's clear that Clooney, especially as a
director, is still struggling to find his balance.

The Etiquette Fairy
Regardless of what you wrote in your
'Why Swarthmore?' essay, going to class,
not the Crum Regatta, is one of the most
important activities that occur at
Swarthmore. Although the most important activity, obviously, is playing misery
poker about what you have to do for said

classes.
But we digress. Classes, shockingly,
are kind of important. They can also be
easily ruined by only one student, commonly known as, "That Guy" or "That
Girl." This week, we want to talk about
how to not be That Person.
Classes are full of pitfalls for the etiquette-unwary, but a good rule of thumb
when
in
is:
doubt,
it's
always ok to
ask. Sure, it's
awkward, but
not as awkward
as guessing and
getting it
can be. If
you're

class-to-class whether this is a direct or
inverse relationship. Regardless of your
reason, if you are late, go to the back. Go
directly to the back. Do not pass the professor, do not collect 200 "I'm late" points.
Don't compound your error by apologizing in front of everyone; wait until the
end of class. Don't make noise as you get
your notebook out and ask your neighbor
if the homework has been handed back

Your classmates deserve the same
respect outside of class that you give in
class. This includes everyone's favorite
educational exercise: group work. Some
Guy We Know at Another Elite Institution

wants us to address what he calls the
'Kantian study group moral imperative,'
which simply calls for reciprocity of
effort and commitment.
You know that person who enthusiastically calls for study groups and wants you
to synthesize everything you learned in
the class into a five-minute, easily remembered and yet subtly impressive spiel, but
then suddenly has a "WA conference"
when it's his or her turn? Take it as a
weird compliment that they want to
access the contents of your superior
mind, but that doesn't make it okay.

We're social animals. When we congregate in classes or study groups, it's often
tempting to share stories. More accurately, DPS (Dumb Personal Stories). DPS is
frustrating (or alternatively, hilarious)
when it's committed by other people, so
there's no reason to think that your story
is more relevant, even when it's about
how your love of gender studies led you to
name your cat Judith Butler, and how
your cat was TOTALLY performing its
gender the other day by playing with a
pink mitten, and

they'll probably notice it), they might

Group discussions are not about the
individual either. If you have a brilliant
idea about how to construct a completely

new paradigm for approaching modern
art, but the class is talking about Ghana's
independence, you'll, have to wait. Maybe
until your next class. That kind of thing is
why professors have office hours, e-mail
addresses and phone numbers, and also
why class tends to be longer than five
minutes. Write that thought down and listen attentively to your classmates,
because what they have to say may be just
as brilliant and twice as relevant.
If you listen, you might find that someone else has made your brilliant comment, and that it didn't sound so brilliant.
Now aren't you glad that someone else
said it? Along the same lines, if you happen to raise your hand only to have someone else called on, you need to put your
hand down and keep it down until they
are done speaking. Keeping it up implies
that what your classmates are saying will
have no impact on what you will say,

which isn't what discussion is about.

Meredith Leich 'OB and Sebastian DuncanPortuondo 'OB were on display until this
Wednesday as part of the Senior Art Show
exhibit at the List Gallery.

Leich's muted watercolor scenes and
Duncan-Portuondo's bold colors and selection of innovative mediums depicted two
very interesting and very different styles.
"Though our work is very different, we
shared an interest in narrative and the fig-

ure and its interactions with nature
and
I think the differences played of each other
well," Leich said.
Watercolor pieces that explored outdoor
scenes and the subtle expressions of faces

made up Leich's portion of the exhibit.
"Watercolor possesses a loyalty to the

human touch... This obvious evidence of
humanity calls me ceaselessly to the medium," Leich said. Indeed, each of her paintings effectively utilizes this form, from capturing the soft shadows on a human face to
tracing the intricate web of branches on a
tree.

As Leich concentrated on this one medium, she returned again and again to scenes
and themes that interested her, most
notably in her series of paintings of the

of this scene are depicted in the four panels
of a folding screen. "My folding screen represents my most heartfelt effort," Leich
said, adding "Since the beginning of last
year, I've wanted to build a screen, based off
of the Japanese landscape screens, which
would depict the field in front of my grandparents' house in Cornwall Bridge,

Connecticut." This landscape creates an
open view of the scene that invites the viewer to experience the serenity of the forest.
Duncan-Portuondo's work also effectively invites the viewer to experience the
artist's vision, but in a very different way.
While Leich maintains a relationship with
one medium, Sebastian uses everything

from mosaic to collage to graphic novel

style paintings to achieve his effect. Where
Leich uses soft, melding colors, Sebastian
prefers stark contrasts and vibrant colors.
But despite his choice to utilize a variety of
mediums in his work, all of Sebastian's
work is nevertheless unified because it is all
"charged with the tensions and intersections between ideas of the private and public," Duncan-Portuondo said.

According to Duncan-Portuondo, his art
"both embraces [his] experience of the
world and imagines situations of liberation
and critiques of reality."
For Duncan-Portuondo, this includes
creating an alternative superhero. "Since
the Nineteenth Century, St. Sebastian has
been adopted as an icon-idol by sexual and
gender deviant communities," DuncanPortuondo said. In this series, he "re-envision[ed] Sebastian's legend as the birthing
of a queer superhero." Through his choice
of contrasting red, black, and white colors

and cartoon-like images, Duncan-Portuondo
effectively captures the graphic novel style,
but his decision to render it though a series
of oil paintings interestingly depicts the
graphic novel as a form of "high art."
Through a pair of doors that the audience is invited to open, one can see the
mosaic scene that forms another of DuncanPortuondos works. Again using the colors
red and black, he depicts a type of forest
scene that invites the viewer in a unique
way. "Ultimately, the viewer must complete
the work, for only upon opening the doors is
the image revealed and only upon the experience of viewing does the true (and always
changing) meaning of the piece become formulated," Duncan-Portuondo said. He further facilitates viewer interaction in another art piece by inviting them to rummage
through the drawers of a dresser.
From forest scenes to graphic novels,
this exhibit presents two very different

'DU play' morally complex Fisher returns on 'frail craft'
BY LIANA KATZ
lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

What would you do if your job was on
the line? Would you lie, cheat, and steal at
the expense of your colleagues? Drama

Board's production of David Mamet's
"Glengarry Glen Ross," opening this
Saturday in Olde Club, explores these questions by delving into the world of a Chicago

real-estate office.
Directed by Dustin Trabert 'lO and produced by Nora Nussbaum 'OB, "Glengarry
Glen Ross" is fraught with tension. Set
against a fairly sparse backdrop, the play
centers around four middle-aged real-estate
salesmen whose abilities to close deals are
flagging. In order to increase sales, their
bosses, who never actually appear on stage,
set up a contest. The top two producers will
be rewarded and the bottom two will be
fired. With their futures at stake, they
"essentially begin trying to sell to customers and to one another in literal and
metaphoric ways," Trabert said.

"Glengarry Glen Ross" is
fraught with tangible
tension.
"Glengarry Glen Ross" spans a wide
range of theatrical genres. According to
Trabert, there are elements of "whodunit"
mystery and comedy, in addition to what
he calls a "morality play." Trabert was
drawn to "Glengarry Glen Ross" precisely
for the complexity of its moral landscape.
"There is a pervasive tone that is more concerned with the decay of culture, of capitalism, of masculinity, of the American
dream." Yet, the play never condemns the
actions of any of its characters. This allows
the audience to experience a variety of
nuanced and perhaps conflicting sympathies.

16

This production of "Glengarry Glen
Ross" has been laughingly dubbed "the DU
play" as six out of seven actors are fraternity brothers. This preexisting bond
between cast members proved to be a great
strength. "We were definitely comfortable
giving feedback to each other. We were able
to be honest with each other," said Brian
Willis 'll, who plays the cocky salesman
Richard Roma. Will Treece 'll, cast as the
office manager John Williamson, had no
difficulty breaking into the already tight
knit cast. "It felt definitely like an ensemble, all working together collaboratively."
Even though the play focuses on the
lives of older businessmen, the cast seemed
to have little difficulty slipping into the
skin of their respective characters. All
seemed to agree that the trick was simply
shifts in posture. "You have to figure out
how to hold yourself differently. A lot if it
is just physicality
the rest follows after
that," said Luke Rampersad 'lO, who plays
the corporate employee Blake and police
detective Baylen. Chris Compton 'O9, in the
role of the aging Shelley Levene, continued,
"You sort of put the weight in your back
and everything starts going slower."
Physical challenges aside, Trabert had
to contend with integrating the play into its
surroundings. "Olde Club is such a bizarre
space. No one is going to walk in here and
think, 'Oh, that's clearly a realistic office.'"
To this end, the production took a strippeddown approach to its set, creating a more
symbolic office and using lighting to com-

Making the Obama 'Leap of Faith'
social change gave way to the long,

BY JEREMY FREEMAN AND DENNIS HOGAN

jfreema2@swarthmore.edu and
dhoganl@swarthmore.edu

After a recent and offensive anonymous threat posted on the Daily Jolt, we could only shake our heads and
say: Get it right, nOOb. This poster grievously transgressed the delicate rules of dialogue
which govern the Daily Jolt. We
admonish with zest that particular
post, and the culture that produced it.
And yet, at this low point in the Jolt's history, we feel
compelled to defend it, and champion the possibilities it
offers for productive use.
At a campus that can often seem suffocatingly small,
the Jolt presents an opportunity to enjoy a longed-for
(though oft-abused) anonymity while reveling in the titillating delight of juicy, "vitriolic" gossip. Delight, not
mindless threat, is the bread and butter of the Jolt.
The Jolt's gossip engenders concrete effects in
Swarthmore's social scene. The Jolt creates characters
who become invisible on-campus celebrities:
NotMattTurner, It's Me, Ginspooper, Real Talk, TMane,
7ate9 and the ineffable Jive Turkey 'O9 (who, for these

writers at least, attends this institution). All weigh in
with their considered opinions.
More importantly, the Jolt has no alternative.
Following the Sager party, or the Wendy Shalit lecture,
where should people turn to voice their opinions? The
Phoenix? Editorials in The Phoenix typically allow only
one or two viewpoints, and they are almost always institutional viewpoints. As such, Phoenix editorials reflect
the stereotypical values of the small liberal arts college:
tolerance, politeness, supportiveness and inclusion.
Students are encouraged to criticize the government and
the administration (two targets admittedly ripe for the
censure), but never to express distaste for one another.
The Phoenix does, however, reserve its distaste for
(surprise!) posters on the Daily Jolt. Writing on Feb. 21st,
2008, the editors of The Phoenix state that "there is a
clear disconnect between the language students use in
their classes, among acquaintances and friends, and the
language they use regularly on anonymous Internet

forums like the Daily Jolt and the Daily Gazette's comments sections. Most of the language used on these
forums, particularly on the Daily Jolt, is reprehensible
hateful, vitriolic and ignorant." Thanks for the input,
The Phoenix!
While The Phoenix's disrespectful comments
towards the Daily Gazette deserve an editorial in themselves, we focus here on The Phoenix's woeful failure to
understand the important role such forums play. The
Phoenix bases its critique on an idealized conception of
a student discourse that in no way reflects reality. The
Phoenix's editors would seem to believe that the ways in
which students feel bound to speak in class or in publications of record represent the only valid form and level
of discourse in which Swarthmore students ought to participate.

On the contrary, values like tolerance, politeness,
supportiveness and inclusion
values which these
go hand in hand with the "reprehenauthors support
sible" language found on the Daily Jolt. These values are
linked to subversive language because they emanate
from a goal of political subversion. The goal of inclusion
is to subvert the relationships of power that aim to
exclude. If, however, we privilege an ideal of inclusion
over and above our commitment to subversion, we run
the risk of uncritically tolerating any and all attitudes
and behaviors. We end up tolerating those very attitudes
which we sought to subvert
attitudes like those
recently espoused on this campus by Wendy Shalit.
A recent Phoenix editorial articulated a student's disgust at our reception of Wendy Shalit. The writer was
"shocked that we could behave in such a disrespectful
and dehumanizing manner." In the opinion of these
writers, anything other than a bold-faced refusal to
accept as legitimate Wendy Shalit's hateful views would
do our institution a disservice far greater than could be
attributed to any rudeness on the part of the students.
And the Daily Jolt
in its uniquely mocking, disdain-

ful, though substantive tone
faced refusal.

YOSHI JOHNSON
My Big Number!
Come April 22nd, I will not be casta ballot for Pennsylvania's
Democratic primary, as I am a registered independent. Fortunately for me,
then, I will not be forced to weigh in
with my vote just yet and will instead
nurse my electoral indecision a few
months longer. That is not to say, however, that I am not fraught with anxiety over this November's election,
since I cannot help but draw parallels
between the contemporary moment
and another moment, the country's
transition into the 19705.
That period saw the country mired
in a hapless, imperialistic war abroad;
the election of a power-driven, probusiness president, and for two consecutive terms (although this time
around, we have not been graced with
a resignation, unfortunately); the precipitous rise of oil prices; and a financial system, already on shaky foundations, showing signs ofbreaking down.
What that time in the early 1970s heralded, we now know, was an era
marked by the tyranny of big business
and an erosion of democratic government's role in a variety of areas.
I do not confuse this short column
for my thesis, but suffice it to say that
the twilight of the previous era of
ing

dark night of a world where expanding the range of human possibility
was abandoned for neoliberalism and
the reckless pursuit of wealth it
enabled. The magnitude of the choice
before us in this election cycle, thus,
has me paralyzed. ("Tyranny of
choice," anyone?)
Plus, I can ill afford to have such a
hefty electoral question weighing
onerous and undecided upon my soul
for so long. I am thus quite anxious to
be done with it all. It was in this spirit
that I attended the rally with Michelle
Obama at Haverford College on
Tuesday. Now, it's no secret to my
friends that I like Michelle a lot more
than I like her husband. Naturally,
then, I was quite excited to see her for
that pleasure alone. More importantly
for the matter at hand, though, I was
eager for Michelle to somehow convince me that the man she thought
was good enough to father her children was also good enough to be my
president. And surprisingly, Michelle
did almost exactly that. (Yes, I refer to
her as Michelle, because in my gut it
feels like the only appropriate
moniker for such a formidable figure,
as if she somehow transcends the belittling 'Mrs. Obama' referential and the
masculine corollary to which it binds
her. Yeah, uh huh she's that bangin'.)
In her speech, there was focused
language, entirely expected, that
emphasized her husband's deep-seated
connections to the blue-collar experience so common in Pennsylvania,
where the issues of "regular folk" are
paramount. Her larger story, however,
I felt transcended a mere campaigntrail stump speech, amounting to an
eloquently conveyed narrative that
recounted how we have all lived the
dark historical epoch I painted in
broad strokes earlier. She spoke of an
ever-shifting bar that made it hard for
regular Americans from all backgrounds to secure a life for themselves

To the editor:

We, the undersigned, as well as 98 other students and
alumni whose names do not fit below, are writing to request
that the college officially reconsider its decision to deny
Assistant Professor of Spanish Horacio Chiong Rivero
tenure. As current and past students, advisees and mentees
of Professor Chiong Rivero, we have had the privilege to
experience first-hand his exceptional teaching and warm,
caring personality. Professor Chiong Rivero stands out to
us as especially invested in his students' well-being and aca-

demic successes. Students recommend his engaging and
one another, and he is well-respected

challenging classes to

the

and their families, and how the cynicism that resulted from this condition
crowded out dreams and left us with
our fears, isolated as individuals and
lost as a country. I don't know how her
husband could ever be thought out of
touch with regular folk with someone
like her by his side.
In any case, she said a great many
things during her hour-long speech,
the entirety of which, I'm sure, can be

found somewhere on the internet.
What struck me, however, was not
anything in particular that she said,
but rather what reverberated in the
air, unspoken and not quite knowable.
There really was that "something in
the air" oft-reported, a "something"
which Michelle partly spoke into existence, yes, but which we also individually carried with us, throughout our
storied lives and into that space; a
"something" made whole by our coming together and our sharing, through
Michelle's story, our own vulnerabilities and aspirations. It can be named
(I think Michelle's husband calls it
hope?) but I prefer instead inciting you
to action, to experience an Obama
rally for yourself, that you might know
this feeling for yourself, without naming it. I haven't had my cathartic "leap
of faith" just yet, but for the skeptical
and the wary, I know this necessary
experience brings us closer to that
moment.
I am not sold on Barack as he's
been billed, at least not quite yet. He
may be a great man, but the creatures
produced by the Washington machine
like Clinton and McCain are foes not
easily dismissed. If Michelle were the
candidate, I'd be sold, but she's not,
and that's probably the greatest testament to her virtue. But it does comfort
me to know that each night, before
Barack can rest easy and, god forbid,
forget about the world he's been elected to save, he has to answer to
Michelle to earn that sweet kiss goodnight.

among the student body. Many of us came to Swarthmore
for professors like Professor Chiong Rivero
professors
who are excellent scholars and who genuinely care about
their students. We believe that losing Professor Chiong
Rivero would be a serious and irreplaceable loss to the
Spanish Department, to current and future students, and to
the entire Swarthmore community. During the appeal

Creating admissions diversity

BENJAMIN BRADLOW

Clothes Line Saga
By the time this article is in print,
prospective students will be arriving
on campus to decide if Swarthmore is
where they will spend their time as
undergraduate students. The college
has one more weapon in its arsenal to
make the pitch to these students:

what Dean of Admissions Jim Bock
'9O calls a "no-loan" policy. The college, part of a group of highly selective and extraordinarily rich educations institutions, will give all grant
money based on its assessment of a
given student's financial need so
that, theoretically, no student will

need to take out any loans to attend
here. I have no doubt that this aids
the college in convincing highly competitive students to decide go to

Swarthmore. Still, what makes for
good headlines may not be the most
significant part of using admissions
as a way of increasing the opportunity for an elite, liberal arts education
like what Swarthmore offers.
Swarthmore is facing not only the
problem of competing for students
comparing the financial aid policies
of similar schools, but also the declining percentages of low-income students attending the school. The average family income for a student
attending Swarthmore rose at a disproportionate rate compared to the
national household mean from 1999 to
2005. On a similar note, it's tough to
overlook the fact that Swarthmore's
"no-loan" policy comes at the same
time as schools like Harvard extend
extensive tuition relief packages to
students from households in higher
and higher income brackets.
The question becomes, then, how
can Swarthmore use its admissions

and financial aid policies to extend
opportunity to the widest range of
students possible, particularly along
class lines. In a previous column, I
mentioned the possibility of opening
up more spots in each class of students to transfers from community
colleges as a way of widening the pool
of potential qualified applicants from
low-income households. After talking

with Bock and student members of
the planning sub-committee on
admissions and financial aid, it is
clear to me that this proposal is one
already under consideration.
According to Bock, the school has,
over the course of his seven-year
tenure, increased the number of spots
open from about two to four students
per class to currently eight to twelve
students per class. This increase

occurred

during

THE PHOENIX

Bock's tenure as

mass" of transfer students to make
the transfer experience even somewhat equivalent to that of a four-year
student. It will take much more than
opening up less than three percent of
a given class to use the transfer pool
as an engine for increasing the economic diversity of the college. Such
an increase may require a reorganization of priorities for the school.
Some may argue that having too
many transfers diminishes the basic
experience
four-year
of
a
Swarthmore student. I have to wonder how much having ten or fifteen
percent of students in a given class as
transfers changes things.
As touchy as the issue may be,
especially under the presidency of Al
Bloom, who already presided over
the contested cuts of the football
team, slotting for athletics may be an
impediment to the goals of social justice driving a more open transfer
process coupled with an emphasis on
community college recruitment. If we
removed some of the slots in each
class allotted to athletic teams we
would open up more possibilities for
using admissions to craft a student
body that offers opportunity to a
wider range of students.
These kinds of proposals are just
some of the ways that we can think
about the current planning process
as a time to push the ways we conceive about institutional operations
like admissions as part of making the
college an effective institution in
advocating for social change. Next
year's student council, which will be
elected in the upcoming days, has the

opportunity to be forceful policy
advocates in this process. The college
will make its pitch to prospective students this weekend who may be
wowed by headline-grabbers like the
"no-loan" policy. As we plan for the
next generation of Swarthmore students, let us reimagine what future
crops of prospective students could
look like.

Campaign 2008: The politics of distraction
If religion, as Karl Marx noted, is the opiate of the masses, modern political practice
comes in a close second. American politics
has become a politic of distraction, wherein
the media, the American people and politicians themselves are complicit in the obfuscation of the vital social issues they ought to
be engaging. Style has, seemingly inevitably,
eclipsed substance, and the electoral process
is suffering as a result.
The democratic freedom underlying the
American political process is indisputable.
Unlike the recent elections in Zimbabwe, no
American politicians have been forced by the
present regime's military police to eat their
own campaign posters. Unlike the tenuous
elections held in February in Pakistan, candidates are not assassinated mere weeks
before their expected electoral victories. The
problem, rather, is that, as a product of the
extensive freedom of American politics, there
is significantpotential for important issues to
get lost in a field of the media's white noise.
Examples of this political distraction are
so übiquitous that they are often mistaken for
actual political discourse. Featured prominently in the New York Times on Wednesday

was a dissection of a scandal resulting from

the posting of plagiarized recipes on the website of Republican presidential candidate
John McCain. Of the twenty-five stories featured by Slate Magazine in their Campaign
2008 coverage this week, thirteen related to
Barack Obama's "bitter" comment. Just
below a headline on the Washington Post's

website stating that political savant Bruce
Springsteen had endorsed Barack Obama
was an article discussing how the dinner
choices of Clinton and Obama reflect their

personalities. Of the fifteen top stories on the
New York Times website Wednesday afternoon, only one analyzed an aspect of a candidate's platform: a "broad" look at McCain's
proposals for the economy.
What, exactly, do recipes, off-the-record
rhetoric and Bruce Springsteen have to do
with selecting the next president of the
United States? Arguably, nothing, except
what the American media and voters choose
to make of them. Given the voting public has
become so accustomed to this lampoon of
what American politics should be, what can
actually be done to resolve these problems in
modern discourse?

April 17, 2008

First, the American media needs to fulfill
its vital social role of providing actual news,
rather than superficial baseline analysis.
Instead of discussing Hillary Clinton's affinity for Kashi products, the Washington Post
ought to be noting that she favors stricter gun
control and improving medical coverage for
veterans of foreign wars. Instead of devoting
four days of news to Barack Obama's "bitter"
gaffe, the New York Times should be pointing
out that he voted against the partial birth
abortion ban while in the Senate and opposes
the plan to store radioactive waste in Yucca
Mountain, Nevada. Second, and more importantly, the American people need to recognize
that they are being distracted and demand
real coverage of the political process.
It is undeniable that the story of John
McCain calling his wife a "cunt" in 1992 is
entertaining, but ultimately, it is irrelevant.

If we truly want to elect the best possible
leader in November, we can, should, and
must do better. It is our lasting obligation to
the legacy left to us by the founding fathers of
this nation, and one which we cannot disgrace by making elections a game of rhetoric,
ad hominemattacks and trivialities.

I am interested in making decisions and pushing
changes that will directly affect you during your time
here. As a freshman student I had no idea what the
timing and processes of applying for a summer internship were.
I think we should have a physical board containing information regarding upperclassmen summer experiences so underclassmen can seek advice, and actually attain
those opportunities (this is one of my many ideas). Although opening up dialogue
across student organizations is a good start, it's simply not good enough if nothing is
done with the dialogue.
As President, I would hold gatherings of student group leaders every few months
in order to engage in conversations regarding current student issues, activities,
requests and moving forward the future direction of the college, together. I would like
Student Council to move beyond just being transparent.
We all know that our student body is amazing. There are many possibilities for the
exchanging of ideas, experiences, insights, and skills. I am serious about acting as a
catalyst for the incredibly important decision-making processes next year, and I will
make sure that present student concerns, including IC and BCC issues, are addressed
immediately rather than set aside for later. If elected, Student Council will be my top

For campus life representative:
Esther Burson 'lO
I think there are many ways to improve campus life. If you
choose me to represent you, I'd want to:
make the deans more accessible through regular office hours
and a published list of whom to contact in specific situations
set up late night dining to make food available on campus
after 11:00pm.
create a campus mini-grocery store where we could buy
cooking supplies and toothpaste with meal plan points.
revamp Tarble into more of a campus center, with nice com-

mon spaces and a series of weekend programs that are alternatives to parties.
reopen the discussion of a Blue Light System.
do a "lighting tour" of the campus with Public Safety to
identify what areas need more light and install new lamps.
help expand the Green Advisor program and institute orientation workshops to teach
about compact fluorescents and what number plastics we can recycle.
advocate for Swarthmore to purchase more wind power and replace old washers with
energy efficient frontloading machines that won't shred our clothing.
Now you know what I want to do, I'd like to tell you about myself. I'm studying psychology, Greek and linguistics; I guide tours, tech at LPAC and vote on the Cooper
Committee. When I decide to do something, I make it happen. Just this year I've created
a Rosh Chodesh Group (through Ruach) and an Equestrian Club to start riding next year.
More importantly, I will listen to you. The point of this position is to get you what you
need, so I commit to asking you your opinions and representing them fully. Thanks for
your time!

Andrew Scott Taylor 'O9
If there's one thing that Swarthmore students know how to do,
it's complain about Swarthmore. From gripes about Sharpies bars
to coin-operated dryers that hardly warrant the name, we all have
something that we'd like to change. Yet we remain at Swarthmore
because we believe in the possibility of progress. As Campus Life
Representative, I would strive to transform discontent into tangible action.
However, the issues facing students in regard to campus life
extend well beyond food and laundry. We can no longer pretend
we live in the Swarthmore portrayed in brochures, and we must
acknowledge that there are serious issues causing frustration
among students. As Campus Life Representative, I would institutionalize a method where
all complaints could be effectively heard and brought to the administration. By dividing
up the number of student groups among all Council members and requiring meeting with
group leaders at least twice a semester, we could ensure that the most pressing issues are
being expressed to the Deans.
As a rising senior and former Council member, I am already well-acquainted with the
administration and the issues affecting the student body. I would like to bring a level of
transparency to this position to assure that issues are not only heard but also that the student body sees the results of their work. My experience and dedication to the student body
in the past has shown that I'm capable and willing to act as an open ear and a voice for
change on this campus.
Chelsea Brett 'll
My name is Chelsea Brett and I am running for campus life representative.
I am a freshman here at Swarthmore and am a member of the varsity cross-country
team and varsity swim team. I have really enjoyed my first year here at Swarthmore
and now I would like to get more involved with the school. I am running in hopes to
represent the students, my friends, my teammates and my classmates in order to make
their time here at Swarthmore an enjoyable one. I want students to have a great experience at Swarthmore and love every minute of their time in college. If I am elected, I
will present the ideas of the students and work towards making those ideas a reality.
College is supposed to be one of the best times of your life so I want to make that happen by meeting your wishes. Just remember, "Vote for me, Chelsea B!" Thanks!

Yongjun Heo 'O9
Next year is crucial for determining the future of
our college. I am running for Student Council
President because my devotion to many different student experiences will help me make well-informed
decisions that represent the wishes of our current
student body and the future students of our commu-

priority.

Paul Apollo 'O9
What should Swarthmore look like in ten years? What

new programs should be introduced? When the
Swarthmore 2020 campaign steering committee wraps up
its work next year, it will have allocated several hundred

million dollars answering that question. There are things
that I feel that money should go towards; turning Film
Studies into a real department, expansion of the Asian
Studies Department to include more South Asian classes,
and need-blind international admissions. As president,
what I would be much more interested to know, however, is
what direction the other 1,484 or so other students that
attend this school want.
Of course, I have short term goals as well: I want to send
all members of SBC, FFS and SAC to the same anti-oppression workshop that StuCo
attends twice a year; I want to have card reading locks put on the dorm doors for safety and security; I want to continue to work with Sharpies on improving their selection
and accessibility. I would be no less passionate about soliciting short-term goals from
students and groups, as well.
So what should be the direction ofSwarthmore? I think it is time for the student body
to unite and assert their presence in deciding the answer to that question. Having
served for a year on Student Council and nearly two years on SBC, I believe that I have
the experience and passion needed to help that body assert itself as a powerful force for
deciding change.

Randall Johnston 'O9
My Daily Gazette platform outlines many of the experi-

ences I feel have prepared me for the Presidency. Aside from
the unyielding love I've nursed for Swarthmore from
abroad, some of these include: my push for greater transparency within Student Council; labeling and vegetarian
options at Sharpies; and closer, more institutionalized ties
with student leaders and administration.
With my experience, I like to think I know Swarthmore
and its avenues well. After all, my previous role as Campus
Life Representative on Student Council was always one of
zealous leadership, and there was more than one occasion
when the rest of StuCo half-jokingly forbade me to do more
for Council in a given week. You can rest assured that my
time as Campus Life Representative will allow me to hit the ground running.
I will surely continue to push for things like increased transparency, the greening of
Swarthmore, the implementation of the "One Card" system, and, yes, better options at
Sharpies, but my method of operation on Student Council has always been to provide
opportunities for students to give feedback, listen and respond accordingly. To this end
I will focus on continuing to table weekly at Sharpies; meeting with student leaders; and
making myself accessible via email, phone, and in person. Though in Spain, I'd love to
hear from you via email at rjohnstl to answer any questions you may have about my
campaign.

With over a hundred student groups at Swarthmore, repre
senting a wide diversity of activities, interests, cultures, an
causes, the Student Group Advisor needs to be familiar wit
them and their needs.
I will bring to the job a year and a half of experience on SBC
Twice during spring budgeting I have listened to every studen
group give explanations of what they do and why it is importan
and with the addition of personal participation I have much expe
rience with what groups want and need, as well as what the co

lege can provide for them.
This semester I have attended every public meeting of Studen
Council and been present when groups have presented their concerns to Council. I have als
made my own contributions when appropriate, and so am already very familiar with th
way Student Council operates (I even read the constitution!).
Next year as Student Groups Advisor, I will continue to work with student groups
Student Council, SBC, and the administration to help student groups achieve their short
term goals. I will also work to realize their long term goals in conjunction with the upcom

Aleman 'O9
you know that the Student Groups Advisor sits in SBC
meetings, chairs the Charter Committee and is a full member o
the Student Council? My best guess is that you didn't. This i
why my first priority as Student Groups Advisor will be t
improve and streamline communication between the studen
groups and the Council.
As former General Intern in the Intercultural Center and cur
rent co-editor of Enie Spanish Literary Magazine, I know how
daunting and frustrating the funding process can be. Thus, I wi
hold regular meetings with group leaders throughout the year t
provide orientation and gather feedback as to how we can
improve the budget and funding processes on campus. My clos
contact with group leaders will also allow me to be a passionat
yet impartial advocate for your interests both in SBC and in the Council. I will also wor
closely with the Council and group leaders to facilitate the creation or renovation of web
pages so that each group has a quality webpage and a blog.
My next priority is to foster the creation of quality new groups on campus. As Chair o
the Charter Committee, I will promote a wise allocation of seed money to prize innovation
and creativity over mediocrity. Finally, I will foster the reformation and expansion of cur
rent groups by holding information sessions on charter changes and outreach opportun

ties.

Groups are at the core of student life at Swat. Don't let them fall in the wrong hands. Vot

Tramane Hall 'll
One of the many reasons for me choosing Swarthmore was th
fervor with which my peers engaged one another with their var
ious values, ideas, and opinions.
Not only did this impress me, but the sheer number of group
available on campus was exciting as well as overwhelming. As

freshman.
I was bombarded with propaganda to join this group or tha
group and like any other clueless, starry-eyed freshman, I signei
up for every mailing list in sight. As the year has progressed,
have culled that list to a diverse set of groups that align with m

ideas and passions.
While I am very satisfied with my experiences with the van
ous groups with which I'm involved, there are many area for improvement. The main issue
that I feel plague student groups here on campus are budgetary constraints, and lack of
central governing body amongst groups. As a candidate for Student Group Advisor, I plan

to work closely with the SBC to implement strategies that will distribute funds in a mor

streamlined and effective manner.
In order to provide a central governing body amongst groups I would push for the ere
ation of an Inter-Group Council or the IGC.
This council would discuss issues within groups on campus and act as a think tank t
implement ways of solving these and other issues. I hope that these ideas appeal to you an
I ask that you will allow me to serve as your Student Groups Advisor.

Bradi Covert 'O9
As Financial Policy Representative, I will not only
work to increase the school's budget and invest the
endowment in a responsible and effective way but I
will also enact policies that will increase communication with the financial representative and increase the
transparency of college spending and investing. I want
to increase the amount of the endowment that is spent
every year (up from 3 percent) allowing for a larger
budget and more money to be spent in crucial areas. I
to continue to invest the endowment in a way
that will be secure and allow it to grow.
I believe it is important that the school use its large
endowment in a socially responsible way. Such a large amount of money is a powerful tool and I will ensure that we invest it in a responsible manner. As a student
council member, increasing communication with the student body will allow me to
more effectively represent your interests. My primary goal is to increase the transparency of college spending.
I want students to have the most information possible about how the school's
money is spent and what the administrators are doing to ensure a quality institution. Next year the 2020 Campaign will be under way and I will make sure the voice
of the student body is represented. This campaign will decide the future of
Swarthmore and the students' voice must be heard.

Xander Warso 'll
Greetings. My name is Xander Warso, and I am running for Financial Policy Representative.
Having sat on FFS, it has become clear to me that, for
many, money on this campus, while bountiful, is still difficult to acquire. My first act would be to offer a workshop for group treasurers at the beginning of each
semester with the various sources of funding represented to explain student acquisition of funding. This proposition is a portion of the larger issue of transparency, a

hot topic in recent semesters. I want to continue the
move towards transparency, continuing previous initiatives such as the fireside chats.
Transparency extends to the college's oversight. Previously there was much contention surrounding the Board of Managers' decision-making process. I believe that
these issues went under-addressed, and a better knowledge of how the Board of
Managers reaches its conclusions would remove some of the negative stigma and
foster student support for initiatives taken by the Board on Swarthmore's behalf.
Lastly, as I would sit on the College Budget Committee, I would move to better
regulate the budgets allotted by the CBC as many funding sources run dry too soon.
Thus I propose granting allocations per semester, making the next semester's budget an emergency fund, in order to provide funding for student initiatives throughout the academic year. If elected to be next year's Financial Policy Representative, I
will work hard in order to bring positive change to this campus. My ears are open,
so come talk to me with any concerns. Thanks all for your time.

For educational policy representative:
Ayanna Johnson 'O9
As Ed. Policy Representative I plan to maintain and
update the Course Syllabi on Blackboard and the Class
RecommendationBook. Both are currently out of date, and it
wouldbe useful for students to have during the advising/registration period. I will also work to expand the availability of
student support programs for non-Natural Science majors
and incoming students who feel under-prepared in Math and
the Sciences.

Additionally, I will advocate for the expansion of
Interdisciplinary Programs to enrich the current course
offerings by providing more diverse course selection. This would include, but is not
limited to Environmental Studies, Ethnic Studies, community-based learning courses and allowing for more flexibility when designing special majors. Furthermore, I
will work with the administration to help turn current minors and concentrations
into majors for interested students.
I will encourage the College to expand seminar offerings and to re-evaluate the
Writing "W" graduation requirement. I will make sure that my voice is reflective of
the student body. Please feel free to contact me with suggestions or comments! Vote

Baseball stumbles in Conference, preps for Haverford

Muhlenberg made more plays. That's baseball."
"Never underestimate your opponent, it was an
important lesson to learn, and something we will
carry with us for the rest of the season," Kevin Kooi
'O9 said.

"I mean, its Haverford. If
you can't get pumped to
play Haverford, you might
as well not play at all."

On Saturday, Swat continued its Centennial
Conference season with a home doubleheader
against the Green Terror from McDaniel College (916, 6-7 CC). The Garnet picked up the loss in both
games, 8-1 and 11-4. Swarthmore led early in the
first game, as they took a 1-0 lead in the forth
inning, when Andy Eisenlohr 'll hit a single to send
Jimmy Gill 'lO home. The Green Terror picked up
four unearned runs in the sixth inning, and held on
in the final inning to secure the victory. Neil Mejia
'll (4-3) picked up the loss.
In game two, Swarthmore fought back to close an 80 gap to 8-4 going into the eighth inning. In the end,

however, McDaniel held onto its lead and closed the
day with two victories. "In both games, McDaniel took
advantage of the opportunities presented. We had a
great effort on the field but we need to take better
advantage of the opportunities that present themselves during each game," Exeter said.

"We lacked the fire in our eyes, a certain grit and
hustle was missing from the team. We didn't have
that never-say-die attitude that you need when
you're down in a close game," Kooi said.
Baseball traveled Tuesday to face its main
Centennial Conference rival, Haverford College (218-1, 9-4 CC), for a much anticipated matchup. "The
feeling is different with Haverford, a rival game,
always a fun atmosphere and each team expects the
other to play at a high level," Exeter said.
Scott Dalane 'OB picked up his 35th hit of season,
as he and Thomas Nakamura 'lO added two hits
apiece to the effort. Unfortunately, the Fords were
able to capitalize more than the Garnet, and
Swarthmore suffered their 11th Conference loss of
the season.
"We weren't consistently throwing strikes, and
hitting-wise, we're getting our pitches to hit, just
not taking advantage of them. We'll work on some
things the next few days and it'll all come together
on Friday," Justin Chen 'OB said.

The Swarthmore-Haverford rematch is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. this Friday at Swarthmore. This
will be the Garnet's senior game, which will honor
four Swarthmore seniors: first baseman Travis
Allen, pitcher Justin Chen, center fielder Scott
Dalane and catcher Ben Mendelson.
"Our style of baseball needs to be executed for us to
be successful, and I feel the team understands that and
therefore could care less about which team [opponent]
shows up on Friday," Thomas Nakamura 10 said.
"Just like we're ready for them, we know they're
ready for us. The question is, who is going to want
it more," Kooi said.
"I mean, its Haverford. If you can't get pumped
to play Haverford, you might as well not play at all,"
Chen said.
On Saturday, the Garnet heads to Gettysburg
College for a doubleheader, beginning at 12:30 p.m.
Tuesday, Swat baseball will travel to Rutgers
University-Camden for a game at the Camden
Riversharks Stadium under the lights starting at 7
p.m.
"Within these next games, there could be upped
intensity and greater stakes, but in the end, baseball is still a very simple game. You throw the ball,
you catch the ball, you hit the ball. Sometimes you
win, sometimes you lose, sometimes it rains,"

Nakamura said.

"Our biggest accomplishment is that we have
improved throughout the season. It has been fun
watching this team develop," Exeter said.

Neil Mejia starts his motion in Swat's loss to McDaniel on Saturday.

Respect your manager, respect the game
The success of football clubs in today's constantly changing world
depends on many factors
apart from the quality of
their players. The communication between different levels of management is essential as even
the slightest slip-up by
I any party could jeopardize the confidence and
S trust between sides.
The manager needs
to be given the utmost
DHEERAJ RAVI
support to create harmony and motivation withRed Card
in the squad. The club's
boardroom needs to be
completely transparent
in its dealings with external factions as well as any concerns/suggestions they have to improve the club.
But the acquisition of players that would strengthen
the club is a matter that needs to be kept confidential as
transgressing this only serves to create bitterness with
other "club mates." I guess part of what I'm referring to
is the way Liverpool's owners have treated their brilliant
manager, Rafael Benitez.
In November, Hicks and Gillett, Liverpool's co-owners,
had quite a spat with Benitez, as they reasoned that they had

22

invested a lot into the club as well as for summer purchases
but their position in the league was quite dismal.
I guess back then one could say the co-owners have a
point. Liverpool had gotten a measly one point from a
possible nine in three Champions League games and
were nowhere near being considered title contenders.
So what did football-ignorant owners do? They contacted Jurgen Klinsmann who was residing in California
after a brilliant run in the previous World Cup. The
media had virtually unanimously reported that
Klinsmann would be Benitez's successor very shortly.
This naturally created a significant amount of tension
throughout the club.
But then Benitez, in these last months, has built the
foundations for a very successful team. A core group
mixed with youth and experience along with a good rotation policy has been one of the reasons for Liverpool's
late season emergence (look at Manchester Utd. and
Chelsea as opposed to Arsenal). Benitez has lead
Liverpool to 4th place in the Premier League (pretty
much) and another semi-final encounter with Chelsea in
the CL.
But we are hearing stories again about how over the
weekend, Hicks and Gillett held clandestine meetings
with Klinsmann, except this time it was about possible
summer targets. Rick Parry, Liverpool's chief executive
and Benitez's 'trusted' ally in the club, was also at the
meeting, all without Benitez knowing.
STOP! I CAN'T TAKE IT! This is straight up bullshit.
Imagine how Benitez must be feeling. He has done noth-

April 17, 2008

ing but toil for this club ever since his arrival a few years
ago. Since then, he has won the Champions League,
European Super Cup, FA Cup, FA Community Shield,
has consistently taken Liverpool to the highest stages of
Europe's premier competition and he has instilled confidence and trust within his diverse squad. This is the
same man who can't go to sleep if he hasn't perfected his
tactics. This is also a father who doesn't let his own son
beat him at video games (I guess that's pretty pathetic ...
but still
dedication and commitment to his work,
right?
haha)!
His confidence must be so undermined after Parry,
his chief ally and confidant within the club, held back
information from him. In fact, he is now seriously considering his future with Liverpool and his real value to
...

...

the club.

Thankfully, Liverpool's off-field affairs haven't affected their on-field performance and let's hope it stays that
way because Benitez deserves to be where he is, considering he is the most hard-working manager in football

today.

Instances like these are very avoidable. The media
obviously doesn't help with its harmful speculation
about managers and players' transfers. But the only
thing that is required is complete transparency between

different levels of the club. The individuals should realize that they are all working for the same goal and cooperation is essential.

Track teams head to TCNJ Invitational
Mullarkey dominates steeple Garnet men set many PRs
BY JAYMES FAIRFAX-COLUMBO
jfairfal@swarthmore.edu

The Garnet women's outdoor track and
field team continued its successful trek
towards the Centennial Conference championships last weekend with a trip to the
College of New Jersey Invitational.
The action was highlighted by the recordsetting performance by Cait Mullarkey 'O9 in
the 3000 meter steeple chase. Mullarkey won
by nearly 45 seconds and chopped a hefty 20
seconds off of the previous college record
(which was held by her). The time was a conference qualifier by almost two and a half
minutes and nearly an NCAA provisional
qualifying mark. Additionally, the time was
the second fastest in the Centennial
Conference this year, bested only by
Dickinson College's Cait Bradley, a former
Ail-American.
Mullarkey's performance wasn't the only

record-setting performance of the meet, however. Lauren Deluca 'lO ran a superb 800
meters to chop two seconds of her previous
800 meter PR. Deluca finished ninth with a
time of 2:23.88, a conference qualifying mark
by a wide margin.
Deluca was followed in by Bess Ritter 'O9,
Faith Pampel 'O9 and Rebecca Woo 'IL all of
whom dipped under the conference standard
of 2:39.37 as well.
Additionally, Cait Russell 'll set a PR,
making her collegiate debut in the 5000
meters. Russell paced herself to a time of

19:12166, well under the conference standard
of 20:48.47. The performance also landed her
a fourth-place finish in the event. In describing her race, Russell stated, "I went out a little fast; I got a little excited but I kept it up
and got a good finish time so I'm happy with
how I did."

Though the event marked Russell's longdistance debut on the track, it wasn't an
unwelcome change, especially during
Parents Weekend. As Russell explained, "My
mom was happy that the 5k was so long; it

gave her twelve-and-a-half laps to watch me
run!"
The 1500 meters was also a key event for
the Garnet. Nyika Corbett 'lO posted a stellar
time of 4:51.04, landing her at ninth on the

Swarthmore all-time list and fourth both in
the race and in the Centennial Conference.
The time also qualified her for the
Centennial Conference Championships.
Corbett was joined by Melina Healey 'OB,
who ran a conference qualifying time of
5:18.25, and Emma Stanley 'O9, who churned
out a strong performance despite being a
more distance-oriented racer.
The Garnet women also got some speed
work in, as they fielded an incredible two 4 x
400 meters squads. As Healey explained, "We
had a record breaking 4 x 4 at the meet. In
my entire Swarthmore career, we have
never fielded two full 4x4 teams, but we did
on Saturday even though everyone was tired
and the day was long and hot."
The field events were also well represented at TCNJ, as Nathalie De Gaiffier 'lO and
Heather Hightower 'O9 led the charge. De
Gaiffier sprinted the 200 meters in addition
to setting a PR in the long jump with a leap
of 4.10 meters.
Hightower was also a multi-event athlete,
tossing the shot 8.35 meters in addition to
flinging the discus 20.28 meters and rocketed
the javelin 13.13 meters.
Alex Breslow 11 witnessed the impressive
acts of the women's team. Breslow imparted
his expert opinion, stating, "Lauren ran
exceedingly well. She broke her PR by two
seconds and that's great. Overall, I think the
girls raced outlandishly well and I look forward to seeing them race more."
Andrew Vanßuren 10 also attested to the
strong performance of the women's team, as
he said, "I was burning up on Saturday. I

don't know if it was the sun or the fire from
the girls' shoes though."
The Garnet women will next be in action
on Friday and Saturday, April 18-19, at
Widener University's Widener Invitational.

The Swarthmore men's track team
traveled to The College of New Jersey
to compete at the TCNJ Invite this
past Saturday. They enjoyed a marvelous day of sunshine, good competition and a number of season PRs. Dan
Hodson 'O9 described the day's efforts,
saying, "It was long and hard, and it
kin da hurt but it was satisfying in
the end."
Four mid-distance men, Connor
Darby 'O9, Andrew Vanßuren 'lO, Dave
Riccardi and Alex Breslow 11, got the
day off to a splendid start with a fourth
place finish in the 4x1500 meter relay.
They impressed spectators with their
time of 18:21 All that teammate Chris
Mayer-Bacon 'll had to say about
Darby's leadoff leg was "God damn it
Darby! You're the man!"
This was followed by a blazing
Conference qualifying time of 4:08 in the
1500 by Ross Weller 'OB, his first of the
season.
After Weller brought the heat to the
track, three more Swarthmore men kept
it sizzling with season PRs in the 800.
Dan Kurz 11 ran a 2:06, followed by Seth
Green 10 running a 2:10 and Alex
Breslow with a time of 2:26.
These men were not the only PRs of
the day. Tramane Hall 11 ran a 24.98 in
the 200 meter dash to keep the records
rolling in. Hall also doubled back to run
a 56.6 in the 400 along with a quick 57.3
...

by Mayer-Bacon.

Hall, who had showed the campus a
bit of what he was made of in the Mr.
Swarthmore competition the night
before, was fairly pleased after the
meet, stating, "Being second runner up

in Mr. Swarthmore and then setting a
PR on the track. Pretty sweet weekend
so far."

Mayer-Bacon
continued
to
improve upon his 400 meter hurdle
time, posting a quick 1:02. Jonathan
Shoop 'OB ran a beautiful 5k to finish
the impressive day of Swat running.
Asked about his race, Shoop said, "It
was hot
and lonely." During the
excruciating middle laps of his sk,
Shoop had to work by himself for the
most part, not quite close enough to
the leaders to pull from them, but too
far in front of the rest of the pack to
get anything from behind.
...

There were mixed results from the
field events. Neel Prakash 'O9 and
Tommy Huang 'lO represented the
throwers in the shot put, discus and
javelin. Prakash expressed his view
of the day's results, saying, "It wasn't
the greatest weekend, but we trained
so you
really hard this past week
can look forward to a little something

special this coming weekend."
Throws coach Tom Reynolds on the
other hand had a thoroughly enjoyable
weekend as the meet was held in his
hometown of Ewing, New Jersey. In
fact, Reynolds may have even had a lifechanging experience. In his own words,
Reynolds said, "I ran into my ex-girlfriend, we're getting back together and
the future never looked brighter." To
top the day off, his parents even came to
show their pride and support Reynolds

as he coached his Swarthmore athletes
to success.
Speaking of parents, Coach Pete
Carroll articulated his happiness
with the weekend saying, "It was
great having about eight or ten parents at the meet, watching their kids.
Some parents came [from] as far as
California." With all of that support,
no wonder the track team kept turning out such fine performances. Swat
track will be in action again this
weekend at the Widener Invite.

Men's rugby having best season in years
BY LAUREN WALKER
lwalkerl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's rugby club team is in the midst of
one of their best seasons yet. Despite their loss to LaSalle
University on Saturday, they have already tallied more wins
this season than their entire previous season, and they still
have a couple games left to play. In addition to LaSalle, this
spring has featured battles against Villanova University,
Ursinus College, Haverford College and Lock Haven
University. The Garnet men were able to defeat rival
Haverford. They also took down Ursinus in a decisive victory and tallied what was perhaps their most exciting win
against Villanova.
The game on Saturday was an exciting match up.
Swarthmore came back from a 17 point deficit, cutting the
lead to only two points. One of the highlights came when
Paul Apollo 'O9 scored his first career try, pushing through a
crowd about five meters out to score.
The team's overall record of 3-2 may not at first seem like

something to write home about, but it is quite impressive
when you consider their size. They have suffered several
injuries and they often play with few or no substitutes available. While most of their opponents have plenty of guys
standing on the sidelines, the most support the Swarthmore
men ever see in uniform on their sideline is two. And even
these two are purely backline subs. "If one of our big guys
goes down, there's not much we can do," said Luke
Rampersad 10.
The team depends on their technical skills to help them

overcome the usual size difference between themselves and
their opponents. "We are frequently up against teams that

THE PHOENIX

are considerably larger than us in terms of membership as
well as the mass of individual members. We make up for it
with what I would call pretty exceptional tackling skills and
technical skills," Apollo said. Due to intense training with a
piece of equipment known as the Predator, described by
Apollo as 'a cross between a football tackling sled and a
steam-roller," they have become very skilled and adept at
moving masses of people, even when they are far outweighed by their opponents. This gives them the edge in
scrums, rucks and mauls.

"It is a great group of guys with
a genuine love for the sport,
and every single one of them
impresses me immensely."
Paul Apollo 'O9
They also rely on their speed and perseverance to bring
them through and beat the odds. "We're faster than most of
our opponents, and we're really scrappy," Rampersad said.
He also commented on how positive and united the team is.
They are a tough group of guys who leave everything they
have on the field at each opportunity. "We give itall untilthe
very end," he said.
Mike Bonesteel 'OB also commented on the team's determination, saying "we overcome our small bodies with our
big hearts."

April 17, 2008

Bonesteel is one of four seniors from the men's varsity soccer team to join the rugby squad this spring. The
other new additions are Brandon Washington, J.P.
Faunes and Brendan Grady. These new players have provided the team with some extra athleticism and strength.
They came in with a good attitude, they've learned a lot
and they have been able to greatly contribute to the
team.

Not only has the team acquired these new players for
the spring, but they also have two new coaches, Coach
Cohn and Assistant Coach Zamunda. According to
Rampersad, there's a lot happening this spring that is
"turning the team around," and these new coaches are a
huge factor. "[Coach Cohn] has done a great job of both
teaching us the necessary skills and keeping us motivated to work on them," Apollo said.
The win against Villanova was one of the highlights of
the season thus far, as the Garnet men were able to
clench a sweet victory against their former coach.
"Coach Larry," affectionately known as "Meats" left
Swarthmore after the fall season to coach the squad at
Villanova, only to be defeated by his former players in a
hard fought game earlier this spring.
The team is happy with its overall performance thus
far, and they look forward to their remaining games,
including the alumni game in a few weeks. They have
had what Rampersad called a "new and good feeling
about this season," and they are excited to finish out the
season together.
"It is a great group of guys with a genuine love for the
sport, and every single one of them impresses me
immensely," Apollo said.

In four days, the Garnet Softball team (19-9, 8-2 CC)
competed against three Centennial Conference opponents, playing six games and winning five of them. The
5-1 record that the team has compiled since Saturday has
solidified their place near the top of the Centennial

With

steady pitching and
defense, Swarthmore
took the first game of the day by the count of 1-0.
In the second game, the Garnet jumped out to a 1-0
lead in the top of the first. Centerfielder Lauren Walker
'O9 led off the game with a single and later advanced
home after a single by third baseman Melissa Emmerson
'IL

The Garnet held onto this slim lead until the bottom
of the sixth, when McDaniel took advantage of a

Swarthmore error to score two runs. Swarthmore could
not catch up in the final inning, and the Terror walked
away with a 2-1 victory. Al Zelaski 'O9 gave up only three
hits and one earned run in the loss for Swat.
The next day, the Garnet returned home to play a dou-

bleheader against defending Centennial champion
Gettysburg College. The two games had been postponed
after a rainout on April 6.
The team thrilled the Parents Weekend crowd by winning both games over the Bullets, thanks to strong hitting from designated hitter Maggie "Diva" Vizcarra 'll
and catcher Michele Perch 'lO.
In the bottom of the sixth inning of the first game, the
Garnet faced a 2-0 deficit to the Bullets. However,
Vizcarra hit a bases-loaded two-run double in this inning
to score Gold and Christine Sendelsky 'O9, tying the game

at two apiece. Up next was Perch, who hit a two-run single, scoring Emmerson and Zoe Hendrickson 'll, who was
pinch running for Vizcarra. The Garnet held on to win
the game 4-2. Getting the win was Riley, who gave up
only five hits over seven innings.
Riley was also named Centennial Conference pitcher
of the week on Monday, her third weekly award from the

conference this season.
The second game against Gettysburg was scoreless
until the bottom of the third inning, when the Garnet
scored four runs. Emmerson led the scoring drive by hitting a single to score Sendelsky. With the bases loaded
and two outs, Perch hit a clutch single to bring home
Emmerson and Gold. Vizcarra capped off the inning by
reaching home on a passed ball.

"If we just keep doing what we've
been doing these past few
games, we should be fine."
Kathryn Riley 'ID
In the bottom of the sixth, Swarthmore struck again.
Walkerfirst scored off a single from Riley, and Vizcarra later
followed with a three-run double that would score Gold,
Riley and Sendelsky, giving the Tide an 8-0 victory. Zelaski
gave up only three hits in five innings to get her fourth victory of the season at the mound. Overall, Perch and Vizcarra
combined for nine of the team's 12 RBIs on the day.

On Tuesday, Swarthmore finished off its tough conference streak by hosting a doubleheader against
Washington College.

After no score in regulation during the first game, the
and spotty defense by
the Shorewomen to seal the win. Walker took the plate
and reached first base after a bad throw. After advancing
to second, Walker took advantage of another Washington
fielding error and made it home to seal a 1-0 victory for
the Garnet. Riley pitched all eight innings, improving
her record on the year to 14-4.
Garnet had to rely on extra innings

"It's good that we got this string
of games out of the way, now
we can have fun and reap the
benefitsof our victories."
Katie Gold 'OB
Swarthmore used the momentum from the extraa fast start in the second

inning victory to get off to

game.

Vizcarra hit Walker home with an RBI single, and Gold
immediately followed her by hitting a two-run home run,
her third of the season. After the quick start, the
Shorewomen could never catch up, and the Garnet cruised

to a 7-2 victory.

"We were never able the make the adjustment to their
pitcher, but a conference win is a conference win, and we
were able to redeem ourselves in the second game," Riley

said.
"We need to start coming out harder in our first
games," Perch said.
The Garnet will put its hot streak on the line during a
home doubleheader against Ursinus College today at 3 p.m.

The game should be exciting, since both teams currently sit
atop the standings with identical records of 8-2.
This coming Saturday, the team will play host to
Franklin & Marshall College for Senior Day. Since Gold
is the lone senior on the team this year, the rest of the
Swat softball team has dubbed Saturday "Katie Gold
Day."

"If we just keep doing what we've been doing these
past few games, we should be fine," Riley said.
