New residents
adjust to life in
Strath Haven
Ethernet, free laundry among new benefits
BY REIKO TESHIBA

rteshibl@swarthmore.edu

Laurel Eckhouse 'O3 was ready to hate her room in Strath Haven
before she even walked into it. The carpet was mauve. It was plush
and faded by the window. In Eckhouse's eyes, her room looked
exactly like what she expected: a converted motel room.
For the first time in three semesters, the college-owned units on
three floors of the Strath Haven Condominium are being used as
student housing this spring. Last fall, a record 94 students, including 12 seniors, were on leave. Only 57 students are away this semester, causing an unexpected housing crunch. Contrary to popular
belief that students were placed there by default, Strath Haven
rooms were placed in the December housing lottery, and students
opted for these rooms.

"People ask me where I live, and when I
answer Strath Haven, their faces fall."
Jenny Lunstead 'O3
This semester, there are 18 students living in Strath Haven, with
Brian Byrnes 'O2 serving as RA.
"I think people generally have a negative feeling about living in
Strath Haven," said Myrt Westphal, dean of residential life.
Students don't like the rules and restrictions in Strath Haven, and
they don't like the distance."
Byrnes lived in Strath Haven two years ago as a sophomore.
Back then, "the computer situation was a disaster and the hall life
wasn't great," he said. As RA, he hopes to use the common lounge
by his room for social events in an effort to improve hall life.
But Strath Haven residents are having fewer and fewer things
about which to complain. Gone are the days when students had to
use a dial-up modem to connect to the network.
During the winter break, Information Technology Services set up
a wireless network from Mary Lyon so that students have the same
Internet access as on-campus dorms. In addition, ITS installed a public computer and printer. In February, Strath Haven residents will be
on the same phone system as the rest of the college. They have new
furniture and keys to ML so they can use the breakfast room.
On top of all that, there's air conditioning and free laundry.
But those who are placed in Strath Haven have pointed out
issues that still need to be addressed. The biggest problem is that
Public Safety does not have their phone numbers, so it is difficult
for people to get in touch with them. In addition, visitors get lost in
Strath Haven because the students are not yet on the intercom system, and the apartment complex is so huge.
"People ask me where I live, and when I answer Strath Haven,
their faces fall," Jenny Lunstead 'O3 said.
Apart from her phone problems and not being able to set up her
voice mail, she is happy about her living situation. "Our room is
pretty, big and well-equipped," she said.
Lunstead, who just returned from living with a host family in
Costa Rica, finds the isolation of Strath Haven "kind of nice" as a
transition back to life at Swarthmore.
Joan Javier 'O3, Lunstead's roommate, who also returned from
Costa Rica, agreed. "I wasn't ready to jump into college campus
life," she said.
So far, there seem to be no problems between Swarthmore students and their neighbors in Strath Haven. In the past, the biggest
complaint has been noise, but as it is early in the semester, potential remains for problems later.
"It's like living in a residential neighborhood, and people need to
take heed of others," English professor Tom Blackburn said. He also
serves as Chairman of the Board of Managers of the Strath Haven
Condominium Association. Strath Haven residents were in general
looking forward to having students live with them when the
announcement was made a week ago, he said.

Groundbreaking on new dorm

set for upcoming November
BY BENJAMIN KABAK

bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

In the fall of 2004, Swarthmore College will face a
crunch as the renovations on Parrish Hall
begin. In order to resolve this conflict before it
becomes a problem, the school will first construct a
new residential hall.
The first new dormitory built on campus since
the early 1980s will be situated on campus just south
of Mertz Hall. "Construction on the new hall is tentatively scheduled for this November, if everything
else goes smoothly," said Larry Schall '75, Vice
President of Facilities. "We have a targeted completion date of Spring 2004, and the dorm will first host
students in the fall of 2004."
The aim of the new dorm will not be to replace
undesirable housing on or off campus. In order to go
through with the Parrish renovations, the school
will simply need to find housing space for the displaced beds.
"Before we can redo Parrish, we need a place
where the students of Parrish can live comfortably,"
Schall said. "This new plan does that and more.
We're going to have 150 new beds. Some of them will
replace beds we're losing in renovations, and some
of them will give us breathing room to avoid a housing crunch and the use of the Strath Haven condominiums."
According to Myrt Westphal, dean of residential
life, with the addition of the new dorm, the school
will be converting the Lodges from student housing
into administrative offices. Additionally, the plans
to renovate Parrish call for the loss of approximately 80 beds. "With the new dorm creating many new
housing

January 24, 2002

beds, we are also considering converting the ML

basement doubles into singles," Westphal said. "This
would go a long way toward increasing the desirability of these rooms."
"Over the next few years, we are going to be retiring a number of dorms rooms in the Lodges and in
Parrish," she said. "We know the Lodges are desirable housing, but it is also very difficult for five people to live together in harmony for a whole year. We
also do not want to have to use the overflow housing
plans for Strath Haven."
The school has been working with William Rawn
Associates, Architects, Inc. since the fall to develop
acceptable plans for the new hall. A committee consisting of Schall, Westphal, five students and
Director of Facilities Management Stu Hain has
come up with a plan to construct a site consisting of
two buildings similar to the idea behind the DanaHallowell Dorms.
The new dorm complex will consist of two separate buildings with a shared courtyard. The North
building has been styled after Kohlberg Hall. There
will be a covered, open-air walkway on the first
floor, and all the rest of the floors will have enclosed
physical connections. The South wing will be an Lshaped building. Both buildings will look out over
Mertz lawn, and according to Westphal, the keys distributed to students will open both of the buildings
in the complex.
"We decided against building one huge building
because we thought it would be too enormous for
[the] space," Claire Phillips-Thoryn 'O2, a student
committee appointee, said. "We feel that building

languages, will direct the new program.
Professors John Boccio, Jerry

Rick Valelly and Rose will teach the
three classes offered this winter. In

order to represent the breadth of the
Swarthmore curriculum, there will be
one course each in the natural sciences, the social sciences and the
humanities.
The courses will be "Aristotle,
Galileo and Einstein: Space-time,
Gravity and Black Holes," "Homeric
Models of Heroism" and "America in
the Aftermath of Sept. 11," according to
the college Web site.

These courses, unlike other
Swarthmore courses, will not offer
"academic credit, nor will they be graded," publicity materials said, describ-

venture in education for its own sake."
The courses will begin the week of
Feb. 11 and end the week of April 8, taking a week off for March break. They
are open to alumni, their spouses, partners, adult children and members of
the local community. Registration is on
a first-come, first-served basis. The registration deadline is Feb. 4.
Like other Swarthmore students,
the adults who take these classes will
need to pay a tuition of $5OO per course
and buy course materials available at
ing the program as

While the six first-year Phi Psi members who were
caught and arrested for burglary and criminal trespass on
the Haverford campus last December look forward to court
dates, the fraternity itself will soon face punishment from
the college administration. The school has decided that the
"scavenger hunt" of last December, which resulted in
stolen items and damaged property, constitutes a hazing
ritual.

The college has punished the students by placing each
on probation for the entire spring semester. In addition,
freshmen Timothy Chryssikos, Paul Chung, Keith
Hernandez, Brendan J. Moriarty, Terence Rooney and
Troy Smith face preliminary hearings on March 14 in
Haverford Court. They will enter pleas to each of the
charges they face.
Originally, each was charged with two counts of burglary in the first degree, which carries with it a maximum
punishment of up to 20 years imprisonment and a $25,000
fine. In addition, vandalism and criminal trespass, including drug possession for Moriarty and underage drinking
for Hernandez and Rooney, were among the initial
charges. Haverford police, however, said they expect these
charges will be reduced and that the six students will not
face jail time.
Dean of the College Bob Gross said the first-year members shouldn't be the only ones punished for the prank.
"There are two issues: One, that from a legal perspective, if it is hazing and thus a violation of state law, we
need to do something," Gross said. "The other thing is, I
think, from a moral perspective. To allow these freshmen
to face both legal and coUege sanctions while allowing the
brothers who designed this to escape sanctions seems
unjust."

Gross also described the actions of Phi Psi as "directly
in the middle" of what Pennsylvania law describes as hazing. According to the state's hazing law, "Any action or situation which recklessly or intentionally endangers the
mental or physical health or safety of a student or which
destroys or removes public or private property for the purpose of initiation or admission into or affiliation with, or
as a condition for continued membership in, any organiza-

tion" at a college is hazing.
"Any person who causes or participates in hazing," the
law states, "commits a misdemeanor of the third degree."
It also declares that all colleges must administer their
own punishment for hazing, which can include "the imposition of fines, the withholding of diplomas or transcripts
suspension or dismissal."
Gross, however, did not comment on what Phi Psi's
punishment would be, adding it would be decided some
time next week.

Early decision process questioned by elite institutions
BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

When Yale University president Richard
Levin said on Dec. 12 that his school's
early decision option should be abandoned,
a prominent issue in the college admissions process was back in the news.
In his statement, Levin requested that
other selective schools join Yale in a united
rejection of the early decision process,
according to The New York Times.
Criticism of the climbing percentage of
early decision applicants in incoming
classes at many selective schools has been
growing, and in September, a comprehensive Atlantic Monthly article described the
many negative results produced by the
early decision process. It questioned colleges' use of early decision for their own
benefit while disregarding the adverse
affect it may have on students.
The article argued that applying early
causes students to consider college earlier
in their high school careers, usually during
junior year. Many students are willing to
endure this added stress because they have
a better chance of being accepted to selective schools if they apply early. But some
educators, like Levin, are concerned that
some students are not mature enough to
handle such an important decision in their
junior year. Also, because some public high
schools in poorer areas never inform their
students that early decision even exists,
often only the wealthy benefit from it.
The Atlantic Monthly article also
argued that students admitted early rank
lower academically than students admitted
regularly, concluding that schools are
interested not in the welfare of the students
but in improving their own rankings
through increasing their yield and selectivC.

Gross,

ity

Dean of Admissions Jim Bock countered
these attacks against early decision.
"I actually support early decision if it's
used in an appropriate way," he said. Bock
refuted criticism that early decision only
attracts wealthier students and said that
this year at Swarthmore the early decision
pool became considerably more diverse.
Bock admitted that, statistically, students applying early have a better chance
of being accepted since there are fewer
applicants. But this does not mean that
those accepted early are less qualified. In
contrast to many other colleges, early decision applicants at Swarthmore are statistically stronger academically than regular
decision applicants. This may be due to the
fact that very few people apply to
Swarthmore on a whim, Bock said.
He agreed that the college benefits from
early decision as well. But Bock denied that
early decision affects the college's rank
much, explaining that selectivity and yield
are each only two percent of the U.S. News
and World Report college rankings score.
Critics have assumed it carries a greater
weight, he said.
In the past few years, there has been an
increase in the number of early decision
applicants. Bock feels that this may have
been an unintentional result of the news
coverage early decision has been getting.
"Most people don't apply early decision,
but if you read the newspapers [it seems
like] everyone applies early decision," he

the Consortium On

Financing

Higher Education (COFHE), which consists
of the most selective universities and colleges, might discuss the issue. He felt that
if changes were going to be made to the
present system, they would require a concerted effort. "It's difficult to see that coming about, frankly, because so many

schools see an advantage in it," he said.
Gross is very aware of the difficulty of
choosing the right college, since he ended

the Yale president are ones

easily."
Bob Gross
up transferring from his first choice. He
doesn't want high school students to be

affected negatively while enduring this difficult process. "The cautionary notes of the
Yale president are ones that you can't dismiss very easily," he said.
Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 understands the
argument that early decision is for the
wealthy
she went to a small public high
school in New England, North Dakota. She
did not apply early to Swarthmore but
noted that "it can be good for some people
if they know what they want, but I think

that a lot of kids don't know what they
want, which can be a problem since some
schools seem to favor early decision applicants."
Most of Gardner's class never even
thought of applying to college early, since
the none of the school's guidance counselors mentioned it.
"I saw the option on an application, and
I had to learn more about it through relatives," she said, adding that this was not a
large problem since most of her classmates
applied to state universities without early
decision. "I think it was unnecessary for
the kids in my class in general, but for me
it was a problem because I didn't realize
how it would help me or hurt me," she said.
Dima Shchelokov 'O2 supports early
decision. He particularly likes the fact that
Swarthmore offers two early due dates,
Nov. 15 and Jan. X since the latter was how
he applied. When he applied, Shchelokov
still needed to take his SATs, since he didn't move to his current residence of
Morristown, New Jersey from his home in
Russia until after his junior year of high
school.

Shchelokov believed applying early
would increase his chances of being admitted, although he was worried it would
decrease the amount of financial aid he
would receive. But his worries ceased
when he received adequate financial aid. "I
definitely think it serves the students as
well, not just the college," he said.

said.

"Right now I support where we are and
can defend it," Bock said. He added that if
other elite colleges decided to abandon
early decision, Swarthmore would be open

Nickel Creek may perform
BY CATHY DANH

cdanhl@swarthmore.edu

Although the Large Scale Events
Committee has opted to bring musical
group Nickel Creek to perform on campus
later this semester, there is a possibility
that a large-scale event will not take place
this year due to scheduling conflicts with
the band and the Lang Performing Arts
Center.
"We are running into issues with dates,"
Student Activities Coordinator Jenny Yim
said. "The LPAC is booked on the dates that
Nickel Creek can come." Initially, Nickel
Creek was set to perform on a Monday
night. But the Large Scale Events
Committee was "hesitant to bring a large
scale event on a Monday night," Yim said.
Yim is currently in close contacts with
Nickel Creek's booking agent so that
Swarthmore may be added as one of their
tour stops.
In recent years, the Large Scale Events
Committee has brought folk singer Dar
Williams and jazz group Medeski Martin
and Wood to campus. The proposal to bring
Nickel Creek was one of two proposals
received by the committee this year.
Another proposal to bring the rock group
Wilco was not approved due to "technical
difficulties" and the issue of affordability,

committee chair Marvin Barron 'O2 said.
The amount of money allotted to the
Large Scale Events Committee varies from
year to year. "It depends on the proposals
received and other budgets. This year it was
extremely tight all around," Barron said.

After accounting for other budgets and the
proposals received, "the range of money
allotted for a large scale event was between
$17,000 and $25,000," he said.
"I chose to bring Nickel Creek to campus
because they are part of the folk genre that
a lot of people listen to on campus," said
Jessica Williams 'O2, author of the proposal.
"Nickel Creek is marketed as country, but I
think that their sound is kind of poppy as
well."
Nickel Creek is composed of three twenty-something musicians: guitarist Sean
Watkins, his violinist sister Sara and mandolinist Chris Thile. Nickel Creek has been

Smaw named dean of

said.

The dean of multicultural affairs is
responsible for issues concerning the staff
and faculty as well as the student body.
"Darryl seems to work well with students
and faculty, so [the appointment] was terrific," committee member Barry Schwartz
said.
Former ADVICE co-chair, SAO member
and search committee member Tanya
Wansom 'O2 felt that Smaw is well-suited
for the position. "I felt I could relate to
him," she said. "He talked about social justice, and I really felt that struck a chord
with Swarthmore."

Several other search committee members agreed that Smaw was highly qualified
for the job. He received his Ed.M. and Ed.D.
from the Harvard University Graduate
School of Education in administration,
planning and social policy, with a concentration in community and urban education.
Smaw has degrees in religious education

and counseling, a master's degree in theology from Colgate Rochester Divinity
School. He also received a BS in music education from Delaware State College.
For the past three years, Smaw was the
associate dean for program development at
the Harvard University Graduate School of

Education. Before holding that position, he
was the assistant dean for student life at

"The commitments were made for the

BY BRENDAN KARCH

bkarchl@swarthmore. edu

When the Board of Managers met Dec. 78, one year after their decision to cut three
sports, the issues at hand were similar, but
the tone was decidedly different.
Athletics was once again the main issue.
But with the decision of last year behind
them, the board focused on issues of facilities renovation and campus culture.
Board members heard reports from the
Athletics Review Committee (ARC) about
scheduling conflicts for athletes, an issue
that is being turned over this semester to
the Curriculum Committee. Facilities renovations include a planned remodeling of the
formerfootball field and track and possible
expansion of fields across Cram Creek.
According to board member and Vice
President of College and Community
Relations Maurice Eldridge '6l, placing athletics fields across the Cram is "far from
being a decision, but the board said it definitely needs to be investigated." He added,
"I think that, at some point, it's inevitable
we will need to go across the Cram" to
maintain adequate field space.

DUONG-LY

The extensive search for a dean of multicultural affairs ended in December with
the appointment of Darryl M. Smaw. He
was chosen from a field of over 150 applicants for the new position which many in
the college community have expressed a
need for during the past decade. Smaw will
begin his duties on Feb. L
In the fall, the student body met the final
candidates for the position during several
evening sessions. The search committee,
which consisted of three students, three
faculty members and four staff members
interviewed candidates over the phone and
discussed students' reactions to the final
candidates. Student groups such as
ADVICE (Advocating Diversity and a
Variety of Ideologies in a College
Environment) also contributed heavily.
The extent of Smaw's experiences
deeply affected search committee members.

Survey: One in four seniors would not return
BY IVAN

BOOTHE
iboothel@swarthmore.edu

Over 25 percent of current seniors would not attend
Swarthmore if they were starting over with the college
application process. This statistic, determined by
Swarthmore's department of institutional research, arose
from the "College Student Experiences Questionnaire," or
CSEQ, administered to all students in the spring of 200 L
However, overall, only five percent of students said they
didn't like the college, yet 18percent said they wouldn'tapply
if starting over with the college application process. Since
only one-quarter of those who said they wouldn't attend also
said they didn't like the college, this "indicates that there are
other reasons not to attend," the summary stated.
"The survey was administered during a time of turmoil
for Swarthmore College," a summary of the results reports.
Students took the opportunity at the end of the survey for
open comments to provide 'either very positive or very negative" comments. "A number of the negative comments concerned the Board [of Managers'] decision regarding athletics, and the administration's responses to safety concerns
on campus," the summary stated.
Robin Shores, the director ofinstitutional research, said
566 students completed the survey, a response rate of about
42 percent. It was "the lowest rate we've seen for any survey
in recent years," she said. The last CSEQ, given to the junior class in 1997, had a 54 percent return rate, as did the
mostrecent annual senior survey; a different type of survey
administered to the entire school in 1999, received a 60 percent response.
The questionnaire was given for the first time in a Web

rather than a paper format, a medium that introduced some
technical concerns on the process. "A handful of
Swarthmore students reported having problems," the summary said. But "it is not known how widespread the problem was." The Consortium on Financing Higher Education,

a group of 31 private colleges and universities to which
Swarthmore responds, wrote the survey, and the Center for
Postsecondary Research and Planning at Indiana
University managed it. Other institutions within the consortium also reported "serious problems" with the Web format. "We wanted to be the most convenient to students,"
Shores said. This year's senior survey will also be administered over the Web, using a different vendor, and the college
will be noting to what extent the response is affected.
Shores pointed out that a 42 percent return would be
"good for most schools." Swarthmore, however, has generally had higher rates. In addition, she said, "response rates
have been going down across the country the last 20 years."
Finally, she pointed out that the eight-page questionnaire
"was a long survey."
Because of the variety of possible reasons for the low
turnout, the administration is unsure how to interpret the
results. "We've always gotten relatively high response
rates," Shores said. "Do we put faith in these responses?"
The summary of the CSEQ also noted that some "subpopulations" like females, whites, and first-year students
were slightly over-represented among the respondents.
Until the consortium releases comparative data between
the institutions, Shores said the administration is waiting
to review specific aspects of the college. But the consortium
"is struggling with how to present the [comparative] data
because of the problems with the survey. It's not a high priority with them," Shores said.
The students who did respond to the survey rated the
college nearly perfect in its ability to 'develop academic,
scholarly, and intellectual qualities," giving it a 6.8 on a
scale of 7. Swarthmore rated lowest on "vocational preparation," at only 31 out of 7.
Students were more likely to enjoy the company of the
professors at the front of a classroom rather than the student sitting next to them. They rated relationships with the
former at 5.9 out of 7 and with the at latter 5.8. Relationships

SWARTHMORE POLICY REPORT
A home on Park Ave. was burglarized between 2:45 and 5:15 p.m. on
Dec. 4. When the homeowner
returned at 5:15 p.m. he discovered
a back door open. He later found a
DVD player, VCR, television and cell
phone missing. No forced entry was
discovered.
Two vehicles parked in a garage
on Dickinson Ave. were spray painted. The vandalism occurred between
8 p.m. on Dec. 6 and 10 a.m. on Dec.
7. A can of silver spray paint was left
in the driveway.
At about 2:25 p.m. on Dec. 6, a
car windshield was damaged at Rte.
320 and S. Chester Rd. The owner
believed the damage was caused by
a rock thrown from a school bus.
Between 9 p.m. on Dec. 27 and
7:30 a.m. on Dec. 28, approximately
$2OO was taken from a vending
machine on S. Chester Road.
An unknown person attempted to
break into a home on Park Ave.
between 3:30 p.m. on Dec. 28 and
7:30 a.m. on Dec. 29. A storm window panel was broken on the side of
the property, and a chair was found
under a window that had been
propped open. No entry was gained
and no property taken. A neighbor
believed she heard glass break at

approximately 8:15 p.m. on Dec. 28.

At 11:36 p.m. on Jan. 10, a resident on Haverford Place answered
the doorbell. Upon opening the door,
the resident discovered someone

step and set it on fire. No one was
observed running from the scene.
On Jan. 12 at 8:43 p.m., Officer
Ann Bardo was on foot patrol in the
business district and observed five or
more individuals running across the
street on Park Avenue. Officer Bardo
approached another group and was
informed they had heard glass break
in the area where the first group had
been. Further investigation revealed
a broken window at one of the businesses. Nothing appeared to be
missing. The property was secured,
and police made attempts to contact
the owner.
On Jan. 17, at approximately 12:30
p.m., a vehicle traveling south on
Rte. 320 was at College Avenue
when it was struck by an egg thrown
from a vehicle going north on Rte.
320. The offending vehicle was
described as a 1999 or later Mercury
Cougar painted red. The victim's
vehicle sustained damage to the
hood and roof area. Officer William

First-year students put the highest "quality of effort"

"Science faculty were particularly concerned with this

Early disaster?
All around the country, a select few high school seniors are
peering anxiously into their mailboxes for "the fat one." No, it's
not spring yet
it's January, the time when early decision applicants to Swarthmore and similar elite colleges and universities
are hearing from that one school they have definitively pro-

claimed as their first choice.
As Swarthmore's first decision letters go out in the mail this
week, the debate over the growing practice of binding early
admissions grows more contentious. A recent article in The
Atlantic Monthly is sharply critical of the process, accusing colleges of exploiting students to improve their rankings. In
December, Yale president Richard Levin announced his desire to
abandon early decision, calling on other elite schools to join him.
Early decision gives the admissions office the opportunity to

dream schools; colleges are guaranteed

fill

Swarthmore with what they see as just the right 'mix' because
they can pick and choose among a qualified group of candidates
who are bound to come here. That means they can ensure a stellar scientist, a violin prodigy and a crackerjack goalie. On the
surface, it sounds like a good idea. College-bound seniors apply to
their dream schools; colleges are guaranteed a few qualified students who are enthusiastic about coming.
But the process is flawed. According to an article from the Yale
Daily Herald, Levin cites early decision programs as a step backward in the progress universities have made since World War II
in increasing campus diversity. This is because many guidance
counselors from rural or inner-city schools don't know about
early decision, putting those students at a greater disadvantage.
The reality is that early applications are soaring, mainly
because the word is out that applying early may improve a stu-

dent's chances of admission. Most admissions officers will admit
they want to admit students they are certain will
it's true
attend. But some high school seniors, sensing that early decision
is not an option but a necessity, wind up bound to a school that
isn't right for them. And students applying for financial aid
might not want to commit themselves to a school that could leave
them without adequate funding.
Of course, there are a number of ED students who will tell you
that applying (and getting in) early was the best idea they ever
had. Once January came and went, they watched, carefree, as
their peers stressed over multiple applications and acceptances
until spring.
That may be just the issue Levin is getting at: the college
application process has gotten out of control, in some cases burning students out before they even get to college. Which, in the
end, is exactly what colleges don't want.

the possibility of life-changing dialogue that the
impressive diversity of religious (I have qualms
about using such a well-worn word) thought on our
campus could allow. An informal survey conducted
at the beginning of the year of incoming first-years
by the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship (SCF)
showed that, out of 71 respondents, every major
world religion and worldview was represented on
campus. In light of this, the lack of conversation and
discussion regarding religious
beliefs at
Swarthmore is surprising.
This silence is not because the differences
between people of dissimilar religious backgrounds
are few. When asked, "In your opinion, who is Jesus
Christ?" answers ranged from complete disbelief
that he ever existed to belief that he is the son of
God. The following are some other responses.
"The person I'd most like to meet."

Swarthmore Christian
Fellowship is planning
a series of co-sponsored
panel discussions enti-

title has many connotations, but perhaps the
most important is engagement and unity. While SCF
hopes that those who participate in the Ring have
the opportunity to discuss and answer questions
about their differences during these discussions as if
they were in an intellectual boxing ring, its ultimate
goal is that students’ ties to each other become
stronger.
In a way, the Ring represents this proposal to the
campus: that SCF will remain faithful to being an
active and beneficial part of Swarthmore by promoting these late night discussions between friends, by
encouraging fresh opinions in our classrooms, and
by reminding us that we do not have to live in a false

state of consensus.
The complete results to the SCF survey will be
posted on the SCF resource board next to the
Registrar’s office.

that India and Pakistan

mutual animosity since their
independence in 1947, and the
Kashmir issue is at the very
heart of that dispute. It is also true that Islamic militants have
been active on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LOC) in
Kashmir, responding to what they consider to be state terror
ism on the part of India in Kashmir. There are a lot of reasons
why Pakistan and India came very close to all-out convention
al war and dangerously close to nuclear war. Many of these
have nothing to do with the United States' war on terrorism
but the United States is definitely not blameless. A very dan
gerous misconception seems to be issuing forth from the pret
zel-choked city in the Beltway: that the United States will be
able to pursue its objectives in its war on terrorism narrow
mindedly without affecting anything else. Understanding the
regional dynamics and context of an international interven
tion is the weakest form of multilateralism and is absolutely
essential if the United States is to work in a way to promote
values of peace, toleration and respect, values for which it
claims it is fighting the war.
In terms of the United States' culpability in the India
Pakistan escalation, the first point is of the broad pronounce
ments of Bush and the administration in the first days follow
ing Sept. 11 and the creation of an entire strategic set based on
these pronouncements. In particular, "we make no distinction
between the terrorists and the countries that support them'
creates a precedent that allows India to attack Pakistan as soon
as tangential evidence is produced linking the December
Parliament attacks to groups with a presence in Pakistan
India quite rightly has said that the United States did not exer
cise restraint or defer to outside legal authority regarding
Afghanistan; why should they do so regarding Pakistan?
Another problem is the pathological inability in the present
United States foreign policy system to differentiate among dif
ferent kinds of terrorists, which sounds like a good thing in
theory, but in practice is more like a disaster. The majority o
the Pakistani population, for better or worse, sees Kashmiri
militants as freedom fighters and India as the source of state
terrorism. The Indians, obviously, have the opposite view, and
the real truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.
Employing the United States' system without the nuances
required will allow for. a very biased interpretation of what are
very complicated and ambiguous situations, such as those in the
Middle East or South Asia. The United States' condemnation of
terrorism in India without a word about Kashmir might be
thought of as avoiding a tricky bilateral situation, but it is, in
reality, revealing a clear bias that is hugely counterproductive.
It would not be fair to the United States to pin the very dan
gerous escalation solely on American rhetoric and action
However, what is needed is a recognition that the world is a
very complicated place and that non-nuanced approaches
toward it will likely do more harm than good. At this crossroads in the war on 'terrorism,' Americans have the opportunity now to decide whether they truly want to contribute to the
system's stability and security or to destruction through the
narrow-minded application of rhetoric. The choice is ours, anc
it needs to be made now.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dash for Cash fuels sexual exploitation
subtle group coercion of incoming members of the two
teams to run, but I don't see how it could be avoided.
Actually, the streakers must feel uncomfortable; otherwise why cover their heads in paper sacks? So to
those who streak, would you be doing this if there

Dear Editor:
I am taking the risk of writing a letter about a phenomenon on campus I have heard about but never
observed. My knowledge, but not my perspective,
comes from students. I won't mind learning that my
factual conclusion about it is wrong. Still, at the very
least, this letter will have served its purpose if it provokes a debate.
The topic is the nude streaking through Parrish by
members of the men's and women's rugby teams
which has become a Swarthmore tradition, advertised
widely on campus and discussed by many student
guides in tours for prospective students. The event is
used to show that Swatties are not just geeks and enjoy
fun. (Maybe the event only proves that there can be
naked geeks.) I only learned last week that the streaking is done for profit.
The event could be labeled as the merchandizing of
nudity for fund raising by exhibitionists unwilling to
do real work to get money. Since the money received is
used for the benefit of the teams, the event is more like
soft-porn than anarchic exhibitionist hedonism. A
close analogy would be a wet tee shirt contest in Paces
to benefit the American Cancer Society. A worthy
event, but using sexuality in this way is at best bad
taste and dubious morality.
The rugby teams are not as socially beneficial as
the American Cancer Society, of course. Streaking for
money is a form of sexual exploitation
even if those
participating in the event enjoy it. I hope there is no

were no monetary reward?
I wonder why, if my analysis is correct, do not the
various feminist and other groups interested in political correctness, the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish
religious student organizations, the administration,
and the faculty urge picketing or a boycott of the
event? Is our pursuit of individual self-expression at
Swarthmore College so limitless that anything is okay
if others are not physically harmed? Are we afraid of
being seen as puritanical or so accustomed to adolescent bad taste that we think enunciating our standards
is futile? Or have we abandoned standards, a kind of
deconstruction of good manners?
So to those who observe, run, and give money (who
are equally responsible for the continuation of this
event), I repeat a question asked of Senator McCarthy
which should be posed to those who exploit male and
female nudity for mercenary motives: have you no
shame?
To prove my cynical interpretation of this event
wrong, all those who streak next year should not
advertise, not raise money, pick a new spot to run, and
stage the happening outdoors in winter.

In praise of fast food:
a remarkable industry

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

This month, the fast food industry lost one of its founding
fathers. Dave Thomas, the owner of Wendy's, died on Jan.
of liver cancer.
Thomas was always my favorite of the fast food pitchmen
He was more human than the surreal Ronald McDonald or
the remote, iconic Colonel Sanders, and certainly more
*

endearing than the Taco Bell dog. However, my goal today is
not to praise this remarkable man. I want to praise the
remarkable industry that he
helped create.
Fast food is one of the mos

underappreciated marvels of the
twentieth century. It's not the
best food in the world, but it's
comfortably predictable. You can
visit a fast food restaurant in
pretty much any major urban

area on earth and get a mea
that's cheap, fast, safe, and iden
tical to what you'd get on the
other side of the globe. Eric

DAVID HAENDLER

Schlosser, the author of "Fast
Food Nation," has said that "the
Golden Arches are now more
widely

recognized

than

the

Christian cross." That's not bad
f°r an organization that has only
existed since the 1950s and has
attained its dominance without the aid of any martyrs, era
sades or Spanish Inquisitions. And if these observations
haven't convinced you that fast food companies are worthy of
respect, I invite you to think for a moment about the various
forces that are opposed to them.
Take the animal rights crowd. Many of the things they say
make a lot of sense. Yes, the way we treat livestock is abom
inable. Yes, there's no reason to inflict pain on living crea
tures if good alternatives are readily available. And yes, meat
farming is a grossly inefficient means of agriculture with a

nasty environmental impact. I accept all of these facts. Yet
every time I see another ham-fisted display on why hot dogs
are murder, I feel the urge to renounce my own vegetarian
ism and noisily devour the nearest quadruped. Given the
long lines for meat that inevitably occur on "Vegan Nite" at
Sharpies, it seems that many others feel likewise. A man can
only hear so many repetitions of the fact that Gandhi was a
vegetarian before he starts craving the taste of blood.
Another notable combatant in the burger wars is the mis
chievous nation of France. In August 1999, French farmer
Jose Bove destroyed a McDonald's near his home anc
promptly became a folk hero in the process. Thousands of
demonstrators showed up for his trial, and President Jacques
Chirac praised his choice of targets, saying "[I too] detest
McDonald's food." Don't they feel just a little bit sheepish
over this? Hasn't anyone thought to themselves, "If our cul
ture is so fragile and weak that it could be overwhelmed by
hamburgers, why are we bothering to protect it?" Oh, well
To borrow a phrase from F. Scott Fitzgerald, the French are
different from you and me.
And then there are the health crusaders. H.L. Mencken
once wrote, "Such fanatics infest every health department in
the land. They assume glibly that the whole aim of civiliza
tion is to cut down the death rate, and to attain that end they
are willing to make a sacrifice of everything else imaginable
including their own sense of humor."
Not much has changed from his day. Although the bulk of
their vitriol is still spent on the demon weed tobacco, now
that the cigarette companies have been sufficiently strong
armed, the crusaders are starting to turn their attention
toward beef. The Journal of the American Medical
Association has called for public officials to combat the fat
"epidemic," and Surgeon General David Satcher, the busy
body-in-chief, has taken up the call, announcing a sweeping
new initiative to fight obesity.
This would be amply justified if the health problems
inherent in a diet of fast food were some sort of a secret men
ace that consumers were unaware of. The proposals put for
ward so far do focus a lot on education and public awareness
programs. But somehow I doubt that the nation will be great
ly shocked by the revelation that eating junk food makes you
fat and being fat is bad for your health.
Dave Thomas may be no more, but I feel confident that the
industry he helped to create is going to outlast all of its
detractors. Good night, sweet entrepreneur, and may a flight
of angels ask you, "Would you like fries with that?"

been attributed to the massive quantities of Demerol,
Percocet and morphine injected into my bloodstream
at the time in question. I know better. My tranquility
was a product of my utter faith in Swarthmore, in the
administration's commitment to the diverse needs of
all members of the campus community.
After hobbling around on crutches for five weeks, I
can testify that in the department of handicapped
accessibility, this commitment is sorely lacking. Many
public restrooms, including the ones in my dorm, have
no handicapped-accessible stalls. None of the showers
come equipped with bars. Several buildings on campus
do not have ramps, and many (including Parrish) do
not have elevators. (Then there is the case of the fickle
Sharpies elevator, which, in the weeks before break,

was out of order more often than not.) Journeying to
the coffeehouse on the second floor of the Women's
Resource Center was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. As far as automatic doors go,
Swarthmore is like a scavenger hunt—you never know
where they might turn up. McCabe and Tarble have
them
on the days they are working
but getting
into most other buildings on campus can be a challenge
if one's upper body is not entirely free for use. I found
that, during my time on crutches, I had to give up
many of my activities simply because their meeting
places were inaccessible. This was not horribly detrimental to my life at Swat, because my disability was
temporary. But for people with permanent physical disabilities, issues of accessibility could pose serious
obstacles to a full and manageable college experience.
These inequalities extend beyond Swarthmore's
physical environment. Though the campus offers a
vast spectrum of activist groups and support groups,
no such group exists for students with disabilities and
their allies. Swarthmore is a haven for workshops, lectures and educational programs, but in this realm as
well, the disabled rights movement has been swept
under the rug. Even at the Tri-College Winter Institute,
which specifically addresses issues of diversity and
discrimination, I was surprised to find no discussion of
the disabled population.
Swarthmore's disabled community is small, but
that is no excuse for limited accessibility and
resources. In fact, Swarthmore's inaccessibility may
discourage disabled students and staff from even
applying here. Without uniformly accessible buildings and a campus-wide commitment to address disabled rights, we are cutting off opportunities for current and potential members of the Swarthmore community.

THE EDITOR

We need more tri-co interaction
Dear Editor:
I recently attended the Tri-Co
Winter Institute at Swarthmore.
The institute was such a great experience. It was a chance to take time
to think about issues that really
matter outside of the stresses of
school. Being with a group of people taking a good look at themselves and their own assumptions

January 24, 2002

while also making plans for action
and future changes was really
inspiring.

This program also impressed
upon me the potential that our tricollege relationships could have.
This is something people should
take advantage of. I hope that our
colleges can work together more,
both to increase a sense of belong-

ing within various cultures and
also to make more bridges among
them. We can really use the experiences of students at the other colleges to better determine what
actions we want to take to change

our environments.

were critical of the very "consensus-building" tradition so recently sought after on this
campus following the athletics cuts last winter.

The

crisis began when the Dean of Admissions Frederick Hardagon admitted only
eight black students in the class of 1972. SASS members indicted Hardagon as the
main culprit in the college's conceived shirking of its responsibility to black students. Although a similar number had enrolled in the two previous years, black enrollment was significantly higher in prior years. When two SASS leaders sent a letter questioning Hardagon's commitment to black education, he replied that he did not want to
"play a numbers game," admitting students solely because of their race when such action
could result in negative consequences for the students.
In the meantime, the Admissions Policy Committee (APC) made a report available
through the library that many SASS members found offensive, citing the publicizing of
statistics on black student performance as a violation of privacy. The report was intended
to make clear the results of a Rockefeller grant, which was designed to increase minority

enrollment, and it included a statistical report at the end.
Although names were not used, SASS Chairman Clinton
A. Etheridge Jr. '69 argued that there was "a countervailing and more compelling right of the black students to privacy from their white peers."
In addition, SASS members questioned the committee's apparent devotion to an "integrationist ethic" and its criticism of
the black student recruiting weekends SASS had previously conducted.
Although SASS had, in one member's
words, recognized the "need for a
black student to retain his identity in
an all-white college," a comment in
the report had described this attitude
as "militant[ly] separatist." SASS students walked out of a meeting with
the admissions committee to protest
its decision to keep the report on
reserve.

their top priority, and used the SASS demands not the

SASS burned Swarthmore in effigy. The action was

Swarthmore to permit a betterfuture.
Several hundred students attended
and heard SASS leaders denounce the
administration and faculty for ignoring the demands they had sent to the

SASS members took over the
admissions office around noon the
next day. As the admissions workers
were closing the office for lunch,
Etheridge walked in through the back
door, let the other SASS members in

remaining admissions personnel to

significantly, they remained at an
impasse with the APC, who had not
committed to reaching beyond the "non-risk" applicant
pool in spite of SASS's recommendations for special
preparatory programs and in-house academic support run
by black students.
But the committee's next report, distributed just before
Christmas vacation, went forward with the recommendation that the admissions office strive to enroll five to ten
"risk" students, as well as at least 20 black students, in
each class. The "risk" quota, though intended to boost the
enrollment of black students, could nonetheless include

and radical caucuses. Gil Stott, a present-day associate
dean but assistant to the president in 1969, emphasized
what he considered a great deal of concurrence between
SASS's demands and the Admissions Policy Committee's

proposal.

On the fourth day, a Sunday, the faculty held a
marathon meeting ending in a 3:30 a.m. decision to act on
all of SASS's demands. SASS outlined in which ways its
expectations differed from the faculty proposals, and even
though classes resumed on Tuesday, the next two days
were spent in negotiations and meetings as SASS and the
faculty attempted to resolve the discrepancies in one
another's expectations.

Philadelphia Bulletin, a spontaneous grouping of several
hundred students gathered on Parrish Beach in silent
mourning.
Ray Hopkins, a present-day political science professor
who was in his second year at Swarthmore in 1969,
described the president in an interview as "very guarded.
He was widely regarded around the country for his leadership at Swarthmore as a president, but he had a very hard
time understanding confrontational politics. It went
against his personality and grain of character.
"I saw him just an hour before he died," Hopkins said,
"and he was just paralyzed, agonized. He couldn't play
politics."
SASS called for a moratorium on the current dialogue

meeting of all students on the first
day voted to endorse SASS's
demands, and the faculty voted to cancel classes for two
days and to push back exams. In the next several days,
they developed a series of proposals that included devel-

Smith's funeral took place, The Swarthmore Phoenix

year, as well as 25 black students in each class for the

adults in the Swarthmore faculty
at the time, there was
only one black professor
and greater efforts to promote
education of black students in nearby high schools.
SASS looked upon the recommendations as inadequate
and labeled them the product of the "white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant liberal mindset." It issued a "clarified" set of
demands to the college president, Courtney Smith, which
included higher quotas for enrollment of black students
and for "risk" students as well as the appointment of an
assistant dean of admissions who would be black. They
insisted that Hardagon be removed from his post in the
admissions office by the next semester if policies on black
admissions did not change. SASS expected a "clean,
unequivocal public acceptance of these non-negotiable
demands" by the second day of the spring semester, or,
they threatened, they would "do whatever is necessary to
obtain acceptance of the same."
President Smith responded with a letter stating he felt
"great sympathy" for SASS's concerns but that the college
must never be "governed by demands or moved by
threats."

Lust and longing in the land of the sun
One fateful spill leads columnist to discovery of new love, trials of southern clime
BY JOEY SPADOLA
jspadoll@swarthmore.edu

The moralist has long known,
even if the scientist has yet to
confirm, the pernicious influence
of the sun's rays upon the human
soul. Whereas the northern
climes, during the winter season,
repose in peaceful, snow-white
purity, the sun-burnt nations of
the South continue to swelter
under Sol's unrelenting beam,
and every species of debauchery
and passion breeds and festers
without check. Hence Byron
says:

What men call gallantry and
gods adultery,

Is much more common where
the climate's sultry.
Now, I am no gallant; and,
being unmarried, am altogether
barred from the latter of the men-

tioned vices. Yet where the heat
has been of sufficient strength
and the sun of sufficient intensity, I have at times felt surge within my bosom such passion as

temperament.
I said "exquisite." But just
now, as I try the word by my ear,
I find it entirely ineffectual to

reproduce the magnificence, the
delicacy, the very perfection of
which, as surely as this globe
whirls about the sun, every facet
of her physical form partook. If

Grecian marble could be reproduced in flesh, what a poor specimen it would be next to this!
I regarded the ad closer. She
was an actress of Argentine
extract, bearing the Christian
name Ivana (an appellation not
without seductiveness), and was
to perform in a play entitled
"Volvio una noche," which was
scheduled for the coming weekend. On attending this my soul
had already staked its being. And
the reader cannot be impressed
with an adequate notion of the
delight with which I was intoxicated upon discovering that the
play was to take place (happy
coincidence!) in the town adja-

moment, I found myself.
The heat was in full vigor, and

nothing else. I knew only that I
must obtain tickets to the show. I
applied myself immediately to
the task. By a phone call, they
were procured. It was then only a
question of waiting the space of
several days for the performance.
Bards and poets have already
so fully expanded upon the symptoms of that infirmity which
humanity, long before the science
of medicine, had designated as
love, that I hardly need be at the
trouble of describing what was
felt in that intervening time.
Sleep, I got none; food, I despised
its very thought; and, if I came to
move a limb at all, it was to wipe
a tear or to suppress a sigh.
But I do not lack resolution.
And I flatter myself that, when
opportunity knocks upon my
door, she does not go unanswered. So that upon the night of
the play, I shook myself from my
daze. I awoke as the Cyclops from
slumber. I donned the most elegant of my clothes. I cast a winning glance at myself in the mirror. And with step steady and
sure, I set out for the theater.
How can I describe the rapture
which I felt
the fluttering
which my heart was compelled to
endure
the heaving to which
my bosom fell subject
when
that divine prima donna first
stepped upon the stage? Candidly,

I cannot. In that first instant, the
lighting was of such a dimness
that the features of her face were
scarcely perceptible; and yet, in
the grace of her movement, in the
aplomb of her carriage, in the
contour of her figure, I recognized immediately the creature
whose image my soul bore
impressed upon it irrevocably.

And when some little illumination alighted upon her counte-

nance, then ut vidi! ut perii!
how I saw! how I perished!
But we must hasten to the conclusion. Although the sun had
already spent its fury and quit
the sky, the heat in the theatre
was maddening and oppressive.
The reader will recall, moreover,
that I had gone without sleep for
some days. Add to this, that my
brain was heated by some (small)
quantity of wine earlier taken
(for even chaste love is not
sober); and that the theatre was
so excessively crowded that,
before the close of the first act,

the place seemed exhausted of its

together, I say, and perhaps you
will not be shocked on hearing
that, when the play came to a
close and the actors were taking
their bows and the crowd stood to
applaud, I (who am no swooner),
upon seeing the visage of our
actress in greater proximity and
with greater clarity than theretofore,
first felt faint, then
swooned, then fell unconscious to
the ground.
Those who supported
me in my fall say I was sin

Royal
Overload
'Tenenbaums' too full of amusing idiosyncrasies
BY MORGHAN HOLT
mholtl@swarthmore.edu
Life, in general, is a tense, sometimes grating tug-of-war between monotony
and idiosyncrasy. Life, at Swarthmore, usually leans a tad to the idiosyncratic
side. Life, in most non-cartoon/comic-book depictions, tends more toward monotony, with just enough idiosyncrasies to keep things exciting. Life, as represented
by Wes Anderson in this winter's psychological comedy "The Royal
Tenenbaums," is fraught with quirks; here, idiosyncrasy is the unabashed, mildly over-stimulating victor.
"The Royal Tenenbaums" is a tale of individual traits, hang-ups and (sometimes conflicting) desires. Unfortunately, it also happens to be a tale of many people, all of whom boast their own individual traits, hang-ups and desires, who
attempt to functionally coexist. In reality, characters are incredibly psychologically complex and, generally, rather eccentric. We get so used to it that, unless we
force ourselves to really stop and think about it, the chaos of one quirk bumping
up against another quirk simply fades into the background of daily interaction.
In real life, it works because we find a way to ignore it, or otherwise functionally
cope. On the silver screen, it is simply overwhelming. It's ironic that real life
should be, in some ways, more complicated and soap opera-esque than Hollywood
can believably portray it.
Gene Hackman's Royal Tenenbaum is the largely absent but also largely
wealthy, and therefore financially supportive, asshole father of three mastermind, creative children. Chas, Richie and Margot are labeled child geniuses and
are destined to go far. But life intervenes, and their combined brilliance only dribbles through small cracks in their individual psychological issues.
The child Chas (Ben Stiller) is an incredibly talented entrepreneur who, at age
nine, invents a species of Dalmatian mice that he then markets to pet stores
worldwide. As an adult, his OCD and mourning for his dead wife swell to such
enormous proportions that he is largely incapacitated in most facets of life, especially single-parenting his two young sons. The child Richie (Luke Wilson) is a
champion tennis player whose career goes awash later in life when he discovers
his younger adopted sister, with whom he is madly in love, has married.
Depression sets in, suicide seduces, and he is in worse shape than his elder brother. The adopted Margot, embodied by the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow with too much
eyeliner and a chronic frown, was an award-winning playwright in high school.
As she grew older, however, she took up secretive smoking, ran away from home
and sacrificed a finger to the discovery of her roots. Between bouts of depression,
she took the role of a nymphomaniac.
Discovering that his wife (Anjelica Huston), from whom he had long been
separated but had never actually divorced, is considering marrying her stereotyped, super-subordinate black accountant
and having been evicted from
the hotel he had occupied since Chas got him disbarred and sued him for most
Royal Tenenbaum attempts to reunite his broken family by
of his fortune
weaving a legend of his impending death. From all corners of the earth, all distinctly absurd walks of life, his children return to live under the same roof,
and the Tenenbaums are again a family, if utterly dysfunctional in their interaction.

"The Royal Tenenbaums" is unquestionably hilarious. The consistent, pervasive satire flows from one absurd encounter to the next. And the perfectly captured psychological state of each well-developed character is amazing. Each character is distinct, well-formed and, surprisingly, believable in his or her psychosis.
As an ensemble, however, they verge on the intolerable.
Realism and psychological complexity aside, the combined idiosyncrasies are
just too much. My friend, at one particularly confusing point in the middle of the
too-many-weird-character overlap, leaned over and whispered if it was all right
for me to write that I didn't know what the hell was going on. I laughed because
it was true. For several bewildering moments during the two-hour movie, I was
lost in the muddle of, say, Owen Wilson's next-door-neighbor-sleeping-withMargot-Richie's-best-friend-mescaline-addicted-novelist-obsessed-with-Native-

Americans-and-the-West character interacting with, say, Etheline (Huston), the
not-divorced-but-considering-remarriage archaeologist mother of three children
whose talents she bolstered but whose problems she ignored. The intricacy and
bombarding detail definitely drowned out some of the finer, funnier aspects of the
movie. But, even struggling to discern what the hell was going on, I still found
"The Royal Tenenbaums" strangely entertaining.
Individually, the characters are astounding in their development and intriguing personalities. They're interesting, but only in isolation from each other.
Together, everything melds chaotically and the plot buckles under the burden of
too many oddball characters, too much intrigue, too much conflict from too many
perspectives. Combined, the fascinating characters make "The Royal
Tenenbaums" little more than one enormous, continuous identity crisis. Which
might just be its most credible quality.

According to Westphal, the school is considering using

the students on dorm committee thought that the positive
aspects of this location outweighed the negative concerns."
Phillips-Thoryn explained the process of choosing the

appropriate site. None of the other spaces, including the
tennis courts near Wharton and the empty lawn space
behind Sharpies, would have worked out," she said.

According to Schall, the buildings will contain both

The administration acknowledges that while the Strath

Kile breaks record in
win over Muhlenberg
From KILE, pg. 20
With 6:27 left to play, Kile tossed in a layup and surcareer scoring record of 1,738 points set by
Michelle Fowler 'B6. Swarthmore called a timeout to celebrate, but the game was still up in the air.
With three minutes to play, the Mules converted a
turnover to bring the score to within four, 52-48. But
Swarthmore responded with a 3-pointer by Furman with
2:15 to play, putting the team up 55-48.
The Swarthmore defense stymied Muhlenberg on its
next two possessions, all but sealing the Garnet's victory.
Muhlenberg's starting center Susan Marchiano, recovering from the previous day's emergency double root canal
to replace her knocked-out front teeth, played only 19 minutes before fouling out, contributing just six points and
five rebounds. The Mules also suffered a setback when
leading scorer Lindsay St. Laurence injured her knee late
in the first half and had to leave the court after scoring
only two points. Despite the injuries, Muhlenberg drew
upon the strength of its deep bench, with Becky Richmond
contributing 15 points and 11 rebounds, her fifth doubledouble of the season.
Yet the Mules shot just 35.9 percent from the floor, missing several close-range shots in the second half. While the
Garnet got off 15 fewer shots, they shot 46.9 percent and
made 17-of-24 free throws.
The win capped a winter break that saw Swarthmore go
5-L the only loss coming at home to No. 4 Bowdoin, 80-65.
The game was the first one back for the Garnet after the
break, and poor play in the first half created an overwhelming 45-26 deficit heading into the locker room.
Coach Shibles suspected the game would have been
closer had the team not been so rusty. "Bowdoin had
another game before they played us," she said.
Swarthmore outscored Bowdoin in the second half, then
won its next four games, including two conference
matchups, before the Muhlenberg win.
The team was unsure about its chances for success this
season, having lost one starter to graduation and another
to studies abroad. "I knew we had challenges that we
would have to face," said Shibles. But with a win-loss
record nearly on pace with last year's record-breaking season, the team has erased most doubt about its performance
this year.
Much of the team's success this year can be attributed
to the improved play of sophomore forward Katie
passed the

Robinson.

"We lost some key players this last year, and I knew I
needed to step up a little," said Robinson.
She has stepped up big. After averaging 9.4 points per
game last season, this year Robinson leads the team and
the conference with 20.4 points per game. She holds an
impressive field-goal percentage for a mid-range shooter at
52.4 percent, and averages 7.9 rebounds and 3.7 steals per
game.
Robinson and Kile have emerged this season as the
dominant scorers. Together, the two players make up 59
percent of the team's scoring and nearly 50 percent of its

rebounding.

"We have the two leading scorers in the conference,"
noted Shibles, "and everybody knows that, and they still
can't stop them." Still, she added, the team wins not

because of its two star players but because of unselfish
team basketball.
Quad-captain Emily Gray 'O2 and rookies Alison Wolf
'O5 and Kristen Lee 'O5 all have proved to be solid off the
bench. Lee is shooting 46 percent from the field and contributed a personal-best 18 points in the Dec. 5 win over
Washington College.
After knocking off Muhlenberg, the Garnet began
receiving more attention from coaches voting in the
D3hoops.com national poll, accumulating 36 points this
week to finish just outside the top 25. The possibility of a
national ranking doesn't faze Shibles, though. "The national rank means little to me," she said. She is just happy with
her team's performance.
Swarthmore closes out the season with eight conference games, including visits to Franklin & Marshall, No. 16
Johns Hopkins and the No. 11 Mules. The toughest and
most intense part of the season is still ahead, but that doesn't worry a team with a 6-0 conference record.
"No one really knew what to expect," said Kile of the
season. Now, she added, "We get better every game."

Akpan makes Nationals

Shooting struggles plague
Tide as playoff hopes fade
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

After the Garnet Tide (4-11, 1-4 Centennial Conference) shot a combined 12-26 at the free throw line against East Division leaders
Muhlenberg and Ursinus over the break, the team took practice off the
court and into their heads.
Before going to bed every night, the players visualized their free
throw shooting and recited a simple mantra to go with their drills on
the court. The extra work paid off the next game at Moravian, as the
Tide went 13-17 at the charity stripe.
Despite the improvement, the team shot only 38 percent from the
field and dropped Monday's game against Moravian, 76-52. With an
outside chance of still making the Centennial Conference playoffs, the
Tide must improve its poor field goal shooting if it plans on catching
up to Muhlenberg (5-1 CC) and Ursinus (3-2 CC). In the conference, the
Tide currently rank ninth in scoring offense with 59.4 points per game
and dead last in field goal percentage.
"We're by far the worst shooting team in the Centennial
Conference," head coach Lee Wimberly said. "We're getting open
shots, we just need to get some confidence."
"Right now, Matt Gustafson is our offense," Chris Loeffler 'O4 said.
Gustafson 'O5 is the only player on the team averaging double figures,
with 131 ppg. He also averages two three pointers a game, good for fifth
in the conference.
With its ongoing shooting woes, the Tide has relied on team defense
to stay in games. "We concentrate on controlling the tempo and playing defense," Evan Gelacek 'O5 said.
"Statistically, our team's defense has improved dramatically,"
Wimberly said. Point guard JacobLetendre 'O4 leads the conference in
steals with 2.36 per game, while Bayne Heersink 'O5 and Loeffler are
both in the top 15 in blocked shots. However, the players know that
they must turn around their shooting if they want to make the playoffs.
If the players improve their field goal shooting the same way they
improved their free throw shooting against Moravian, they just might
have a shot at the postseason. Maybe all they need is a good mantra.

Notes

On Jan. 14, Swarthmore picked up its only win over winter break
with a 55-54 victory over the University of the Sciences in
Philadelphia (USP). Ursinus, who currently holds the second and
final playoff spot in the Eastern Division of the Centennial
Conference, lost to USP 80-60 earlier in the year.
The team arrived back from winter break on Dec. 31 and had practice at 10 a.m. the next day. "We sacrificed New Year's Day," Wheeler
Morgan 'O5 said.
The JV squad has been performing well. Gelacek scored 21 points in
a win over Moravian on Jan. 21 "Everyone gets playing time, and it
boosts morale," Gelacek said.

Indoor track team
strives to reach last

year's standards
BY MARK JANOFF

mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu

Imo Akpan 'O2 felt the Swarthmore work crunch
last semester and did not run in any regularly
scheduled practices or meets. Instead, she devised
her own training schedule to prepare for the
remainder of the indoor track season. She ended up

qualifying for Nationals.
The two-time national qualifier has not had any
difficulty returning to last year's form. At the Yale
Invite on Jan. 12, Akpan provisionally qualified for
a trip to the Division 111 NCAA Nationals in the 55meter dash. At last Saturday's Haverford
Invitational, she placed first in the 55-meter dash
and second in the 200-meter race.
Akpan has high hopes for this year. "I want to
get stronger and faster. I want to break my records
and win a lot of medals," she said. Akpan also wants
to win the 55-meter dash at the Centennial
Conference Championships. She placed second in
that event the past two years and hopes to finish her
indoor career with a gold.
The indoor track and field team faces a similar
challenge to match or exceed last season's pace and
certainly recognizes how difficult that challenge is.
Runners broke many school records last season,
and national qualifiers Sarah Jay 'Ol, Joko
Agunloye 'Ol and Marc Jeuland 'Ol have since grad-

uated.
"Joko and Marc, I don't think we can fill their
shoes any time soon," Akpan said. "We're just working hard and training hard. By conferences we'll be
where we want to be." Newcomers Lang Reynolds
'O5 and James Golden 'O5 have a similar long-term
outlook. "Everybody's pretty much taking [the transition from last year] in stride," Reynolds said.
"We're a really young team, but everyone's having
a good time, and we have big hopes for the future."
The team may realize those hopes sooner rather
than later. At the Haverford Invitational, Golden
finished sixth and Reynolds finished seventh in the
3000-meter, one of Jeuland's old events. Reynolds
does not feel any pressure to fill Jeuland's shoes,

however. "He was only one guy," Reynolds said.
"We have big potential."
The "we" refers not only to Reynolds and Golden,
but also to Dan Keys 'O5, Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 and
Garrett Ash 'O5, who is currently injured. The five
distance runners have proved an immediateboon to
the team and should help it attain long-term success.
Akpan spoke highly of the rookies. "They work
really hard and motivate me," she said. At the same
time, she wants to set an example for her teammates. "I want to do something they can copy, like
train as hard as I can and stay positive at meets,"
Akpan said. "I hope younger people can take some-

thing away from that."
Besides Akpan and the first-years, the team has
a solid core of veterans. Returning members include
Kwaku Ntoso 'O3, Rob Melick 'O3 and Njideka
Akunyili 'O4, who all fared well at the Centennial

Conference Championships last

year.

Garnet swimmers return to conference action
Return of head coach Davis,
Puerto Rico trip prepare
team for fierce competition
BY KATHRYN JANTZ
kjantzl@swarthmore.edu

With approximately 80,000 meters of swimming under
its belt, the Swarthmore men and women's swim team
returned from its training trip in Puerto Rico looking forward to this semester's competition.
The training trip marked the return of head coach Sue
Davis from her semester-long sabbatical. According to
Davis, the switch between interim head coach Dan Dakus
and Davis went smoothly.
For David Whitehead 'O3, Davis' return was not merely
smooth but very positive because she "taught us new
things that she learned during her sabbatical like turn
drills and snapping your hips on butterfly."
Each day, Davis took a small group of swimmers out of
the main workout and focused on teaching them specific
technique work that they needed.
The only real hitch during training trip was the difficulty of mastering the Puerto Rican roads. "We spent more
time going in U-turns than going straight. While in retroTHE

spect it was amusing, it wasn't at the time," Davis said.
"Just surviving the Puerto Rican rules for the road was a
feat in itself. If there are rules for the road, it's that there

are no rules."

Although tanning and bingo were popular activities,
the trip was no walk on the beach athletically. The swimmers had to wake up at 5:30 or 6 a.m. to be ready for morning practice. They swam for a little over two hours, hit the
beach, and then returned to the pool for another strenuous
two-hour workout in the afternoon. Davis was assisted by

"If they swim like they showed me
they could swim on the training
trip, then they will do well."
Head coach Sue Davis

Rob Roche and Claire Arbour in conducting these sessions.
The highlights of the trip included a visit to the training grounds of Jesse Vasallo, former world record holder
in the 400-meter individual medley and Olympic swimmer
for Puerto Rico. After a brief introduction, the former
Olympian accompanied the team on a boat ride to
"Gilligan's Island." Later that evening, Vasallo treated the
team to a historical tour of Ponce.

During the rest of the trip, the team explored Puerto
Rico. They lounged at Luquiio beach and walked around El
Yunque, the only tropical rainforest in the United States.
They also toured the city of San Juan, which is the capital
and the site of El Morro, the first Spanish fort in Puerto
Rico.
Although many on the team are tired from various ailments, they look forward to their first meet of the semester against Drew this Saturday.
"Drew will be a meet that will help us get ready to compete again. With our most difficult meets occurring in the
second semester, we need to ease into competition to prepare for some tough opponents," Tara Trout 'O4 said.
"Drew will let us get the feel of racing again so we will be
sharp for our hotly contested meets."
Both teams will grapple with three of the best teams in
the conference this semester with Gettysburg on Feb. 2,
Dickinson on Feb. 9 and Washington on Feb. 13.
Washington and Dickinson are currently ahead of the
Swarthmore women in the Centennial Conference standings. The men also sit in third place, just behind Dickinson
and Gettysburg. The women look forward to trying to
defend their conference championship and maintain their
unbeaten record.
While a challenging goal, it is not out of reach for the
Tide. According to Davis, "If they swim like they showed
me they could swim on the training trip, then they will do
well."

Garnet knocks off No. 8 Mules
Kile breaks career scoring record;
Robinson named player of the week

When Heather Kile 'O2 broke Swarthmore's career scoring record in
the second half of Saturday's home game against Muhlenberg, she
looked proud but distracted. Kile had more important things on her
mind. The women's basketball team had a game to win.
And win the Garnet did, handing the Mules their first loss of the sea-

son, 66-53. The victory put Swarthmore atop the Eastern Division of the
Centennial Conference and improved their record to 13-3 overall and a
perfect 6-0 in the conference.
The game was perhaps the biggest win of the season for the Garnet.
Muhlenberg, then ranked No. 8 in Division 111 by D3hoops.com, shared
the division lead with Swarthmore going into the game.
"The women came really mentally prepared," said head coach
Adrienne Shibles, who watched her team win its fifth straight to go 5-1
after the break.
The Mules had no answer for the dual threat of forwards Kile and
Katie Robinson 'O3. Robinson scored a career-high 30 points on 12-for-22 shooting and added 13 rebounds and five steals, while Kile grabbed
18 points and 15 boards.
"I was getting a lot of open shots, and my teammates fed me the
ball," said Robinson. The game helped Robinson earn her third
Centennial Conference Player of the Week award this season.
Guards Ali Furman 'O3 and Katie Tarr 'O2 each contributed seven
points, and the four starters combined for all but three of Swarthmore's
total points.
The Garnet fell behind early, 19-13, but a switch to a zone defense
helped stop the Mules' easy low-post scores. Center Caitlin Ryland 'O2
anchored the post defense, forcing the Mules into errant passes and bad
shots. Swarthmore closed the first half on a 16-4 run. But a 29-23 halftime lead was little comfort for the Garnet, as the Mules brought the
game within one point three times in the second half.

Swimmers flying toward conference showdowns

After spending winter break training in Puerto Rico, the men and women's swim team will soon face the heart of its conference schedule. David Whitehead, above, a triple
winner against NYU in a Dec. 8 meet, will be one of the men's keys to success. The undefeated women currently lead the conference, while the men sit in third place.
