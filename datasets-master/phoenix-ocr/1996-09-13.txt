New Class of 2000
Most Diverse Ever
Student Outreach Helps
Swarthmore Finally Meet
Minority Admissions Goals
By

Toki Rehder

The class of 2000 is the most diverse class
in the history of Swarthmore. Nearly 40 percent of students in this year's freshman class
describe themselves as belonging to a minority racial group. Of the 388 United States
citizens and permanent residents, 10.9 percent identify themselves as African-American, 13.5 percent as Latino/a, 9.9 percent as
Asian American and 4.4 percent as biracial or
multiracial. The class of 2000 has record
numbers of African-American students and
Latino/a students.
This increased diversity is the result of
efforts made by both the administration and
the student body. Last year the Admissions
Office took on several new initiatives that
were supported by President Al, Bloom, the
Dean's Office and the Office of Financial
Aid, according to Robin Mamlet, Dean of
Admissions. Swarthmore students spearheaded this effort by visiting high schools
during October break, participating in phone-

a-thons, contacting prospective students
throughout the application process, hosting
students, and coordinating the pre-frosh weekend for students of color.
Tracy Collins Matthews, who coordinates
admissions outreach efforts to students of
color, said, "The main reason why more students of color were accepted this year was
due to the overall strength of the pool of
applicants." Outreach by the members of
Swarthmore African-American Student Society (SASS), Swarthmore Asian Organization (SAO), and Hispanic Organization for
Latin American Awareness (HOLA) last year
contributed to the large number of students of
color accepting Swarthmore's offer of admission. Gustavo Alberelli 'OO said, "The
way in which we were treated is definitely
why many students ofcolor decided to come

this year."
The arrival of a diverse class coincides
with the arrival of new Intercultural Center
Director Anna Cobo. Cobo envisions the IC
as working to further multiculturalism on
campus. By multiculturalism, Cobo means
more than having diverse groups on campus,

but also appreciating different backgrounds
within these groups.
Striving for multiculturalism is an ongoing
effort. We must "continue to build on the
enthusiasm and momentum that we have this
year and use it to continue in our recruitment
and yield of students ofcolor," said Mamlet.
The class of 2000 is bringing tremendous
enthusiasm and energy to multiculturalism
on campus. Ben Maulbeck '99, HOLA member and intern at the Intercultural Center,
thinks "the first years have a lot ofenergy and

will enrich the entire institution." Some firstyears envision SASS, SAO, and HOLA becoming even more inclusive and playing a
central role in educating the campus. Eric
Leive 'OO said, "The ethnic, cultural organizations here tend to exclude all others.. .they
should be open to everyone with who wants
to learn about new cultures."
Maulbeckbelieves cultural groups must be
both "a support group" for members of a
particular ethnic origin as well as a vehicle
for educating the entire campus: "It's a balancing act between the want for community
and support, but not wanting to segregate or
isolate ourselves." SASS, according to coPresident Julian Haffner '9B, tends to invite
only African-American students to meetings
because "it is a time to come together and
speak openly about our concerns and our
direction as African-Americans."
Although meetings are focused mainly towards creating a safe place forAfrican-American, Latino/a, and Asian-American students,
most events planned by SASS, HOLA, and
SAO are open to the entire community. The
Intercultural Center and Black Cultural Center are meant to be not only meetingplaces for
these groups, but also spaces open to anyone
interested in using them.
Although SAO, HOLA, and SASS are
changing in size and composition, all three
maintain an interest in continuing to work
with the Administration to address issues of
diversity. "We need more Asian-American
faculty members and administrators," stated
Paul Wong '97, president emeritus of SAO.
Haffner pointed out that the percentage of
African-Americans at Swarthmore still does
not reflect the percentage of African-Americans in larger American society—l2 percent.
"TheAdministration should not become complacent," he warned.
Amy Albert '9B, co-editor of OurStory, a
journal about issues of race and diversity,
says students and faculty also need to take
responsibility for increasing diversity: "As a
community we need to take a proactive position. We need to look at how courses are
titled, how they are focused, and how people
are treated in the classroom...we need to look
at ways in which we marginalize issues of
racism on campus." In the seminar which
Albert co-teaches with Maurisa Thompson
'9B, "Race, Ethnicity, and the College Experience," students will examine issues of diversity with a focus on Swarthmore.
This year is, according to Maulbeck, "a
critical year not only for HOLA, but also for
Swarthmore...We are confronting [race issues] on a deeper, more real level as opposed
to a theoretical, intellectual level."
Albert thinks this change is a benefit for the
entire community. "When issues of diversity
are talked about openly, it tends to bring
issues of gender, sexuality, and class out into
the open...this dialogue helps us to see each
other as more than students, but as human
beings with unique backgrounds."

Swat Steps Up Public Relations
Bloom and Others Trying
to Bring Liberal Arts
Colleges to the Forefront
By

Min Lee

Swarthmore's recent selection as the best
small liberal arts college by US News &
World Report comes as no surprise to those

who know about its intense academic atmosphere and excellent faculty. But do you
remember the first timeyou toldyour friends
you were going to Swarthmore? You eagerly
anticipated their heartfelt congratulations,
only to be greeted by questions like, "Where
is that?" and "Isn't that a women's school?"
Beyond academic circles, the name
"Swarthmore" may not ring a bell. So, as the
competition between the best colleges for the
best students intensifies, administrators have
begun placing more emphasis on public relations and visibility.
According to Harry Gotwals, Director of
Alumni Affairs and Vice President of the
College, Swarthmore's Board of Directors
has always found itself at odds with the type
of flashy publicity tactics usually employed

by public relations firms. However, the Board
never established a policy against a more
aggressive public relations strategy. "As a
matter of fact," Gotwals recalls, "I remember
reading the minutes ofa board meeting taking
place in the '4os, in which one of the board
members lameried...that Swarthmore was
oftenunknow- m'snot thatthe school didn't
pay any attenu inp the visibility issue, but it
simply gave it a lJVer priority."
The Board started to take
interest
in the realm of public relations under the
leadership of President Al Bloom. An ad hoc
committee on public perception—whose
members included Bloom and Gotwals as
well as late Dean of Admissions Carl
Wartenburg—was formed in December 1993.
The committee made certain that the media
(including college guides) conveyed an accurate picture of Swarthmore to the public.
"We began to realize everyone has a stake
in public relations," Gotwals explains. Tom
Krattenmaker, director of Public Relations,
couldn't agree more. "If we do well, the
Admissions Office gets more and better applicants. If alumni see Swarthmore out in the
news more often, they become more motivated and thus more involved in the development of the College."

In San Diego and Chicago, Students
Across the Political Spectrum Make
Their Way to the Convention Floors

Swarthmore Students
By Erik

Weedman

After the "bounces" and readjustments of the election polls
since the conventions of the two major parties in August, the
candidates are focusing on building the proverbial "bridges" they

promised in their speeches: Bob Dole to an ideal past and Bill
Clinton to the 21st century. Politically, there wasn't anything new
at these conventions but the shimmering confetti. But they were
dramatic, and as the extensive television coverage proved, most
Americans wanted to be a part of them. So did Swatties.
Phil Spector '97, Joe Khan '97, and Franklin Rubinstein '97
found their way to the Democratic Convention in Chicago quite by
accident. While interning at the White House, Khan made contact
with convention planners and secured a job for himself and friends
Spector and Rubinstein at the main Clinton/Gore information

booth.
At the booth, "any question that any office didn'tknow was sent
to us," explained Rubinstein. The "crazy" work, according to
Spector, did have its benefits: he once fielded a call from Hillary
Clinton's mom. Despite working extremely long hours on little
sleep, the trio managed to get to the convention hall on the last two
nights of the event.
Accidentally making their way to the VIP level without the
correct credentials, they disregarded Secret Service personnel and
mingled with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Ted Danson, Dan
Rather, and Kevin Nealon. According to Khan, Rubinstein even
found time to "rekindle an oldrelationship" with Chelsea Clinton,

albeit briefly.
Of the defining speeches of the Convention, Khan said, "I
thought Gore's was the most moving." In addition to outlining the
Democrats' agenda for the next four years, Gore added a heartfelt
personal account of his sister's deathfrom lung cancer. Khan had

seen copies of Gore’s basic speech at the Speechwriting Office
already, but was struck with this personal addition.
Of Clinton’s “Bridge to the 21 st Century” speech the next night,
Rubinstein commented, “He hit all the issues he needed to hit,”
and encouraged voters to “get past the name-calling.” Spector felt
that Clinton redefined himself as the “patrician elder” of the party
who could help the Democrats rise above divisive issues like
welfare reform.
Shaking things up on the other side of the political spectrum,
first-year Hugh Weber attended the Republican Convention in
San Diego as a Youth Delegate. The governor of his home state
of South Dakota invited him to participate in recognition of his
work on state campaigns.

better communication channels with college
counselors, supplying them with more detailed information on the College. The Board
decided to fill the vacant post of Director of
Public Relations with someone experienced
in such matters—namely the current director,
Krattenmaker, who previously worked at
Princeton University.
Krattenmaker has been especially successful in taking advantage ofelectronic opportunities for exposure. To begin with,
Krattenmaker answers dozens of queries a
day regarding the College through Profnet,
an on-line service which enables journalists
to access experts. In order to promote political science professor Ken Sharpe’s new book,
titled Drug War Politics: The Price of Denial, he used Lexis/Nexis, an on-line guide to
media resources, to find out which newspapers had recently covered the drug issue,
subsequently sending them information on
the book.

The Senate also voted against a resolution
extending federal job discrimination criteria
to include sexual orientation by a tally of 50

President Al Bloom noted that the College

extended employment benefits to same-sex

Ethernet Hook-up Expensive for Some

News Briefs

By Christopher

SEPTA Discounts for College Students

DiLeo

This semester, Swarthmore students were greeted with a new form
of computer communication,
Ethernet.
Intended to speed up campus network computing, the conversion to
Ethernet has become a major topic of
discussion amongst computer aficionados and novices alike.
Ethernet is a protocol for computers to communicate with each other.
Prior to this year, students had only
one protocol to choose from,
LocalTalk. By next fall, it is the
College's intention to convert the
entire community to Ethernet. The
result would be a network running
thirty times faster than the one currently in use.
For the students this means faster
Internet surfing, quicker file transfers and networked video games. An
added bonus is that any computer

SEPTA representatives will be distributing free weekendpasses in
Parrish Parlors on Tuesday, September 16. Students will need a
Swarthmore ID in order to claim a free pass, which will enable them
to take the train for $2 on weekends on all five Zone train lines,
excluding the Trenton, NJ stop.

Magazine Recognizes Campus Activism
Swarthmore has gained another accolade from a national magazine. In its September/October issue, Mother Jones named Swarthmore one of the top 20 U.S. activist campuses. The magazine, which
did not rank the top 20 schools, noted student efforts in Chester in
particular: "Swarthmore students have helped residents in poor,
predominantly black Chesterrehabilitate run-down houses and convert vacant lots into playgrounds. Now, students are helping them
fight to keep the state's largest trash incinerator from operating in

their backyard."

Ethernet can connect to the network.
However, many perks students enjoy, such as file sharing and printing,
will still not be available to students
who use PCs.
According to the Computing Center, any computer sold by them "will
either have Ethernet built-in or will
have the ability to add Ethernet easily
in the form of a card." The purchase
of a card can be quite expensive,
though, depending upon your computer. For Macs, those owning a
PowerMac 6100 need a $4O transceiver, while those owning a
Powerbook 145 will need to invest
$286 to get on the net. A full listing of
prices and necessary equipment can
be found at http://www.swarthmore.
edu/ethernet/devices.html. PC owners also need to buy a card for
Ethernet, which can cost between $4O
and $lOO.
Some cards dorequire installation,
which may increase the price or delay
your networking. The Mac products

can be purchased at the Computer
Store; however, price hunting may
yield lower costs.
Once the equipment is in place, the
jack wiring must be changed by a
professional. The Computing Center
is taking applications for conversions
via the World Wide Web at http://

www.swarthmore.edu/ethernet. Students can also obtain guidance and
information by contacting the
Swarthmore Computing Center.
On September 9, the Computing
Center started converting computers.
Once you have purchased a card,
have it successfully installed, and
have completed the conversion, the
network will be ready in about three
days. Aminorchange from LocalTalk
is the location of your computer on
the network. In the past, a computer
located in Dana AT will now appear
in Dana EN. The only other change
will be the speed.

Weber was particularly surprised

In addition to having a "nice conversation with Larry King," he ran into

Isn't Everyone a Bio Major?
By

Lauren Rackow

The number of students majoring
in biology at Swarthmore College
has doubled over the past ten years.
This, combined with the large size of
this year's first-year class, has
stretched departmental resources thin.
The Biology Department currently
has 120 majors. Department Chairperson Rachel Merz believes that a
total of 70 to 92 Biology majors is a
"good target number," because this
number allows the Biology Department to schedule classes easily.
With a crowded Biology Department, many students are unable to
schedule classes required for their
major. "I know many upperclassmen
who havebeen lotteried out ofclasses
that they had written on their sophomore papers," said {Catherine Wu'9B.
Many students complain about the
size of their intermediate and upper
level courses. Wu emphasizes that
"professors cannot devote much attention to their students with classes
consisting of more than thirty students." The large class size intimidates students who might major in
biology. Ashwin Rao '99 believes
that the large class size "takes the
identity away from many potential

biology students who do not want to
be lost in the numbers game."
Rao suspects that the Biology Department uses classes such as Biology 2 as "weed out classes that prevent some students from becoming
biology majors." Lauraßarandes '99
concurs: "Bio 2 was a nightmare."
Merz insists that the Biology Department is "not trying to make it
harder for students to major in biology. Although students sometimes
feel that they do not receive a grade as
high as expected, only one or two
students actually fail." Merz is in the
process of e-mailing first-year students about their interest in the biology department. "Biology is a booming science. Once the department determines the number of future biology majors, we will be able to develop more courses for biology majors."
Many students, including Wu, wonder why the Biology Department does
not hire more full-time faculty members. Merz explains, "The choice to
hire more faculty is not entirely the
department's decision. Each faculty
member receives his own laboratory
for research; thus hiring a new faculty member is very expensive." The

A short-term solution would be to
hire outside professionals to teach
specific courses. While Merz realizes that this situation is not ideal, she
acknowledges that the Biology Department has had success with such
courses in recent years.
In addition to adding courses and
hiring faculty, Merz "tries to coordinate classes, so that students are not
lotteried out of more than one class."
Merz insists that "90 percent ofbiology majors receive their first choice
classes although they worry about
their courses."
Some students are not concerned.

The increased number of students
this year has presented the College
with a number of obstacles and issues, not the least of which is where
to house all of the students. This
problem has been exacerbated by the
theft of chairs, desks, shelves, and
mattresses from dormitories.
Therehave been a number of thefts
throughout the campus; items have
been takenfrom virtually every dorm.
In Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts,
five tables were stolen from the
lounges. One of thetables later turned
up in Dana, but the others are still
missing. Yet there are rooms in
Hallowell which are home to approximately four mattresses.
The phenomenon seems to puzzle

difficult. There "is no way to know"
who did it and "no way to trace it,"
statedBalbierer. Moreover, because
theft has been so widespread, in
"many dorms, reports went...to the

individual supervisors." Enforcement
matters are now being handled by

campus security.
Even if there had been no thefts of
furniture, three or four students were
not going to receive fully furnished
rooms because of the increased size
of the student body. In preparing for
the school year, Balbierer needs to
order the furniture required by the
beginning of October in order to have
the rooms ready to go in the fall.
Because the additional number of
students attending Swarthmore this
year was not anticipated, in addition
to room shortages, there were also
furniture shortages.
Students living in converted living
spaces all received school furniture.
The furniture thefts have upset
some members of the Swarthmore
community. "People should have respect for community space," said
JonahSteinberg '97, a Hallowell RA.
These sentiments were echoed by
AnnalisePaaby '00: "I thinkit's pretty
immature. And I think it is also really
selfish."
Although an attempt was made to
contact those students who have stolen furniture, none were willing to be
interviewed.

Too many students, too little space.
Three years ago, when the Class of 1997 arrived, Swarthmore's enrollment
rose to the then-astonishing level of 1388. That level is no longer so amazing:
according to Registrar Martin Warner, 1437 students have enrolled on
campus this
semester, up
from 1353

there doesn't
appear to be room in the dining hall for everyone on the meal plan, and lines
everywhere are longer than ever.
The College has made space for the extra students—three are living in a
house on Field House Lane, and 14 more in apartments in Strath Haven
Condominiums; administrative offices on Parrish 2ndhave been converted to
dorm rooms. But the new housing is less than ideal: men on Parrish 2nd West
shower in a bathroom used by top College officials, and the students in Strath
Haven must follow a long list of rules more appropriate for an apartment
building for "grown-ups" than for a college dormitory.
There's another problem with the new dorm rooms in Parrish: the administrators who used to work there now have offices in Commons, the large
room on Parrish 2nd formerly known as the Community Resource Center.
That means the student groups once housed in the CRC don't have offices
anymore. The Dean's Office and a student task force are seeking a temporary
replacement, but the College should still find permanent, high-quality space
for student organizations.
Overcrowding in Sharpies Dining Hall is likewise troublesome.Lines have
become unbearably long, and it's hard to find a seat at peak meal times.
Sharpies management should consider creating an extra serving line in one of
the dining rooms at peak hours, or putting out deli food in an upstairs lounge.
And it shouldinstall more seating, perhaps in the upstairs lounges, before cold
weather sets in and the students currently eating outside move to tables
indoors and add to the space crunch. All of these changes could require hiring
additional staff, but that, like the cost of providing rooms in Strath Haven or
of renovating Commons, is part of the unfortunate price of admitting too
many students.
Which brings us to a broader point: the College must do something to ensure
it won't have too many students again next year. While the Admissions Office
did a wonderful job last year ofrecruiting a diverse and talented group offirstyears, it utterly failed to produce the appropriate number. It's certainly
difficult to predict precisely how many people will accept offers of admission—but there are still ways to control the size of the first-year class.
Admissions officials say they intend to accept a significant number of
students from the waiting list next year. We wholeheartedly support this plan.
By admitting fewer people than are needed to end up with the desired class
size, the Admissions Office will reduce the risk of a disastrous spike in
enrollment like the one that happened this year.
There's little danger that the waiting list will yield too few students: there
will always be people who weren't accepted but still want to come. And
S warthmore' s applicant pool is so strong it's unlikely that people accepted off
the waiting list will be of lower caliber than those accepted initially; in fact,
because students who get in from the waiting list give up deposits at other
schools to come here, we can feel confident that they truly want to join this
community.
One question remains: in the long run, what should the College's enrollment be? As the graph above shows, enrollment has been drifting higher for
several years. This slow climb has gradually increased the strain on campus
facilities—for example, the housing lottery was growing more chaotic every
year—even before this fall's sudden jump in enrollment. The College should
either reduce enrollment to a more manageable level, or build the dorms and
facilities that are needed to serve a larger student body. Otherwise, Swarthmore cannot and will not remain the first-rate institution it now is.
..

Little touches make all the

difference.

The big things—the curriculum, the faculty, the facilities, the student
body—make S warthmore thekind of place itis. But small touches matter, too,
and we'd like to express our appreciation for the people and organizations
who do the little things that keep us sane and smiling.
Movie Committee, for instance. For the first movie of the year, The
Birdcage, they provided popcorn and softdrinks—cold softdrinks. On a night
when the temperature in the theater felt like 100 degrees, that was a great
kindness. Now ifonly we could do that for all movies.. .perhaps there's some
money to be made selling concessions?
Another little thing which will add a touch of beauty and grace to the
campus is the recent donation of the ornamental gates that now adorn the Rose
Garden entry. Gifts of Scott Arboretum member Al Muscari, the gates make
the Rose Garden a secluded enclave of loveliness amidst the bustle of North

Campus construction.
When the big issues get us down, when we worry too much the campus
debate of the week, we sometimes forget that even if all the big issues were
resolved, Swarthmore would be a bland and boring place if no one paid
attention to the little details of campus life. Here's to the people who do the
little things that are, despite their apparently mundanecharacter, crucial to the
College's character.

Prudence Demands a Third Party Voice
But Will the Media

By

Vincent Jones

Is it me? Or, is everyone and their
dog's mother advocating the emergence of a third majorpolitical party.
Some argue that the slight differences between the Democratic and
Republican parties preclude the poor,
Blacks, Latinos, and several other
groups from having a true voice in
our political system. Others argue
that more competition would improve
the quality of our political leaders
and make them more responsive to

the needs of theirconstituents. At this
point, I'm not sure where I stand on
the issue. However, I do know that
any group wishing to launch a third

one huge obstacle—the Media.

Both of those efforts deserve much
praise because they offered the

adequate depiction of their party's

Since the Media plays an integral
role in the making or breaking a political candidate or her parties image,
any third party must successfully
navigate the airwaves to gain the status of a major political party. Thus
far, Ross Perot has done the best job
using the Media to challenge the status quo. But, would he have been as
successful if he did not have millions
of dollars in his bank account in stocks
and other assets to further his agenda?
Although major candidates spend
exorbitant amounts of money campaigning, the Media provides them
with a considerable amount of free
advertising through their countless
stories, specials, etc. If every presidential candidate and their respective
party received that same luxury then
maybe it would be possible for a third
party to emerge.
Don't get me wrong, I understand
that the main concern of the Media

tends to be ratings, and the American
viewing public may not be receptive
to extensive coverage ofother political parties. However, I believe that
the wizards of Madison Avenue can
do a great job "manufacturing consent" among the masses. Remember,
no one believed that people would
want to watch music videos all of the
time. Now, MTV is practically a rite
of passage for many young people in
this country.
So, all you budding media executives, journalists, etc., shouldn't be
afraid to venture beyond the typical
election stories because people will
watch, read, and listen. The popularity of Colin Powell and Ross Perot
and his Reform Party illustrates the
degree to which the American people
want something different. Although,
most voters will still vote Democrat
or Republican at the polls, they seem
to want other options to consider and
choose from in an election. Unfortunately, the "liberal" media tacitly
supports the status quo and does not
appear to change anytime soon.

Keep The Coffee
By Katalyn

Vidal

It is said that the Swarthmore campus is one of the most liberal in the
country, so wonderfully liberal that
we have over five student groups
geared toward students of color. To
me, it is no surprise that someone
came up with the great idea of creating an African-American a cappella
group as a way to celebrate the Black
contribution to the musical world in
this country. Black Coffee is a group
whose goal is to share its heritage of
song with the rest of the Swarthmore
community. The group sings the
songs that are a part of who they are.
Unfortunately, there are students
who seem to feel that Black Coffee.is
discriminatory and even racist. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Black Coffee is particular in selecting members who can best perform in
the sound and style of its repertoire.
Black music is a sub-culture in and of
itself and deserves to be performed
by the individuals who know and
love it best; these individuals are more
likely to be people of African descent
than people of other racial or ethnic
backgrounds. Coffee sings black
music and utilizes the power of black
aural tradition to better know itself as
well as letting the rest of the school
know where it's coming from.
The purpose of this group is not to
exclude whites or any other non-African race; racism is not an issue. For
every student who feels threatened
by the "exclusive" existence ofBlack
Coffee, there is another who supports

it. Many black and white students, as
well as all other ethnic groups represented at Swat, do not feel that the
group has some kind ofhidden racist
agenda. First-year student Viviana
Del Prado believes that Black Coffee
is a "good organization that promotes
African American unity,"as well as
providing an outlet for black students
to strengthen their cultural roots.
When asked, many other non-black
students shared the sentiment that
"exclusive" is too harsh a word to use
in describing Black Coffee. These
students understand that the real issue on the line is solidarity and the
sense of unity that comes when one is
among people of similarheritage and
musical inclination.
Although Black Coffee is not a
support group in and ofitself like the
above listed organizations, it is an
organization with similar goals in
mind. It saddens me to think that
some people at Swat feel threatened
by this celebration ofAfrican-American tradition. This Pan-African
(meaning that not all the members
have their African roots in the U.S.,
but also in the Caribbean and Latin
America, like myself) singing group
gives Swarthmore's black students a
chance to sing and to celebrate what
is closest to our hearts: our identity.

Katalyn Vidal is a first-year stu-

dent from Queens, New York who
loves to sing and aspires to become
an English or history major. She
hopes to become a member of Black

Coffee shortly.

It would be, I expect, very difficult

me daily, I still have been slicing
bread at the bread cart every lunch
and dinner. The fact that I have not
contracted any disease that I can unquestionably connect to the bread

withthis action. However, I warn that
there is an evil in Sharpies Dining

When I stroll into Sharpies for lunch
and dinner to wait in the steamy subterranean lines for my food, I always
look forward to what waits for me
outside the confusion of the "Center
Stage" stampede: the bread cart.
Its loaves, predictable and reminiscent ofOld World tradition, lie on
their seemingly immaculate white
cloth as pillars of hearty nourishment. The raisin loaf, the poppyseed
and cumin loaf, whole wheat bread,
and simple white bread are real to the
touch. Their earthy nature transcends
the sometimes overcooked and often
heavily processed food found in
Swarthmore's dining hall. A bean
and rice combinationbecomes a Spanish delicacy when a slice of spiced
bread is added; a bowl of Sharpies
minestrone is transformed into a meal
served on the patio of a historical
Mediterranean villa with theaddition
of a heel of wheat.
However, thereis one negative idea
that passes through my anticipating
mind as I watch the person ahead of
me rip into the oblong lump. How
many people have touched and mishandled the piece I am about to take.?
The loaves sit there so innocently,
inviting hungry souls to cut out a
section, but I believe that they are not
as immaculate as they appear.
Not everyone washes their hands
as they enter Sharpies. If this occurred, lines for the upstairs restrooms
would be as long as those downstairs.
It is quite fine that some may not
deem washing necessary, because
sometimes one's hands are satisfactorily clean to feed oneself. But when
those hands— hands that have just
concluded a muddy game of soccer,
or hands that are fresh out ofchemistry lab, or hands that have recently
contacted other parts of the body in
excretion— come into Sharpies and
envelop the entire loaf to cut off a
piece of bread, I grow suspicious.
How sanitary is my slice?
No one is allowed to stand at the
"Very Vegetarian" counter and delve
into the cauliflower with his fingers.
Even though this would work, the
practice of doing so is deemed unsanitary and downright unappetizing. But studentsdo literally that when
slicing their starch at the bread cart.
They walk up to the loaf on its plastic
board, grasp it as if it were the struggling victim of a gopher hunt, and
slice off its head. Sneeze guards are
installed at all counters, but they do
no good when a person, with no intention of malice, wipes his runny
nose in wait for a drink of pink lemonade and then walks to the bread
cart to slice a piece ofbread with his
freshly infected hand. Next time you
are in Sharpies, lookaround and think
of all the people that you wouldn't
want touching your food. Then look
to see if they have bread.
I have seen this problem of public
bread loaves solved while in Germany. There, during ahotel breakfast
in Dresden, a cloth was placed over
the loaf so as to only expose the end
to be cut. The bread's integrity as
wholesome and unadulterated food
was saved, and all present in the dining room seemed happy with the cir-

Too Many Folks, Too Few Forks
By

Jennifer Klein

You mention the word Sharpies
and just about every person on campus conjures up a different image.
One student thoughtfully ponders the
phenomenon of the french fry bar,
another student remembers last
week's shortage of silverware and
bowls, and yet another agonizes over
the absence of the Belgian waffle
machine at brunch.
Lately, when my thoughts turn to
Sharpies I picture the grill line
wrapped around the salad bar and
ending upoutside of the food serving
area. Every day when I go to lunch
this image fills me with fear and
dread. I take one glance at the chaotic
scene, and I promptly flee to the cereal for refuge.
I find myself rationalizing that if I
just eat one bowl of cereal and a
banana for lunch I will have a whopping extra five minutes to inhale my
food. If, instead, I try to brave the
impossibly long deli line, I will end

up with a fuller stomach, but I will
only have fifteen minutes to try and
consume my precious sandwich.
So, you see my dilemma. It comes
down to what is more important to
me. Do I risk choking on the sandwich, or do I just go hungry until
dinner?
Then after I have eaten and think I
am home free, there is the line to put
my tray on the conveyorbelt. Around
1:10 every student with a 1:15 class
trudges over to the belt to try and
make it to class on time.This requires
a few extra minutes which then shortens my actual eating time even further.
In the end, my Sharpies experience
is pure chaos.
With more students than ever on
this campus, something in Dining
Services needs to give.
Essie Mae's isn't a feasible alternative to the mad rush at Sharpies
since they do not allow students in
until 1 p.m. and even there students
must maneuver through a long line.

positively. The dispute over copyright infringement threatened this,
with President Clinton discussing a
100% tariff on $2 billion in Chinese
exports. China surely would have reciprocated, raising tensions still further and cutting off trade. Democratic ideas and values often accompanyWestern capitalism, but that can
only take place with free access to the
Chinese market.
The possibility for conflict with
China will be great in the coming
years. This year alone, the Chinese
plan to quadruple their power output
by building coal-burning electrical
plants which will pour huge amounts
of pollution into the atmosphere.
Also, as the Chinese economy grows
and industrializes, there will undoubtedly be further exploitation of workers, and even possibly the continued
use of slave labor. Again, although
the U.S. should use its position to try
to sway China on these issues, moral
absolutism must be avoided at all
costs. America must put its concerns
into the proper perspective, for any
real conflict between China and the
U.S. could escalate dangerously, even
to nuclear proportions.
The legacy of Neville Chamberlain must be remembered—appeasement is not a solution—but so too is
rigid moral policy a prescription for

Tolerance in Identity Issues
By

Sutharsan "Sid" Ganesan

Any gathering of great minds and
aspiring personalities creates a medium for romantic, and potentially
Utopian ideals. The Swarthmorean
prototype thrives on the universal
concept of energy. This energy assumes many forms, from political
activism to sports and community
service.
However profound this may appear, I have for a long timeaspired to
visualize an antithesisofSwarthmore:
a society that does not utilize such
energy in so many ways. I may seem
an iconoclast to aspire to what is
essentially an absolute, abstract, homogenous and very uninteresting
society. However, this aspiration
leads to a more comprehensive understanding of 'difference,' and its
contribution to the conservatism of
individuals in our society.
It is a great sensation to identify
oneself with a 'group.' Why? That
group provides many faculties, and
most importantly an established basis from which one may develop.
This is the fundamental social psychology, which is responsible for
everything that constitutes our intellectual and physical being.
As individuals, partaking of the
global society, we inevitably seek to
confirm and recognize our existence
through materials. Such is also accomplished immaterially (by beliefs,
etc.), however ultimately that immaterial accomplishment inevitably
manifests itself in something material.
It is apparent that the process of
'gathering' information from many
sources and experiences is much more
profitable than from one source. In
order to do this, to get information
frommany different sources, one must
strive to be neutral and impartially
absorb information and ideas from
all perspectives.
Furthermore, this person, the impartial one who refrains from judgment until he is well informed, seems
to develop faster and more efficiently
in contrast to the close-minded, quick
to judge and ultimately is more profitable. However, it is very hard to
properly execute this 'gathering'
without yielding to the inherent persuasion tactics inherent in what you
have gathered.
But this is the essence of my ideal:
to stand neutral and contest an inher-

ent human inclination to "take a side."
It is a very difficult task to remain
neutral, after subjecting your intellect to such abuse. It is very easy to
"take a side," and actually it is quite
enjoyable. However, the rewarding
effect upon one's social and political
perspectives is enormous. You will
see Swarthmore in the true light in
which it ought to be perceived. It is
a corroboration of brave minds and
brave personalities, and not that of
vulnerable minds and personalities.

I am a Sri Lankan Tamil by heritage. I was brought up in a predominantly expatriate community in very
cosmopolitan and sophisticated Hong
Kong. I spent the last four years in
two boarding schools, one of which
was a very conservative, elitist and
predominately white Catholic school.
I spent my last year at a much more
diverse and liberal instituition.
Fortunately, as a result, I have
been transformed into a very conscientious individual socially and racially (I think politics is a bunch of
crap). However, unfortunately as it
seems in retrospect, I never accepted
the prospect of being or having been
a racist. I thought it was very easy to
maintain this 'neutrality.' However,
much to my dismay, I realized that at
the end of the summer that there was
nothing between myself and a fulltime racist.
I hated anything and everything

that was British.
This frustration with British social
values had actually been developing
for many years. The most significant
precedent to this transformation
seems simply to be the fact that I
wasn't provided the tools to investigate and voice my frustrations. I was
not given the opportunity to 'gather,'
but rather I was encouraged to find |
true belief in such frustration. Such a
concept is one of the greatest facili- j
ties inherent in American society.
I greatly enjoyed being a self-proclaimed racist. It was great to manifest in words and actions that subconsciousracism that seemingly has been

The Largest Room in Parrish Hall
By

Elisabeth Newcomb

Commons, evening, 1947: stu-

dents congregate with a jukebox, pingpong, cards and conversation.
"We went up every night after dinner to
play bridge," said Associate Dean Bob Gross,
an alumnus of Swarthmore. "There was no
student center."

the college collection hall, with built-in seats
and a balcony at its south end. After Clothier
Hall was finished in 1931, the room was no
longer used for collection. Itremained empty
for two years, while the Board of Managers
decided what to do with the space. Eventually, they "appropriated $3,000 for the remodelling, removing of seats, balcony and
stage and the installation of bookshelves,
closet space, and the fireplace. Hand-made
walnut furniture and copper lamps were
bought for the lounge. The large map of the

sible sites were considered, including Hall
gymnasium and the erection of a new building. But after consultation with the fire underwriters, permission was secured to allow
smoking in Commons and this place was
decided upon."
"It was during the spring semester of 1944
that 'Collection', as it was then called, first
began to take on any real significance in the
social life of the students. Up until then no
smoking had been permitted in this room. At
that time too, the first booths and tables were
installed, as were the juke-box and the
coke-machines. Gradually during the
later war years other facilities were
added: more chairs and tables, the p.a.
system, and finally the store."
The use of the room declined with the
completion of Sharpies in the 19605.
Before Sharpies was built, students ate
their meals in what is now the Admissions Office, which meant that it was
merely a flight of stairs from their dining tables to Commons. However, during the SASS takoverofthe Admissions
office in January of 1969, SASS leaders

Having served as everything from collection hall to the home of CIVIC and its constituent groups, the space underwent its most
recent transformation this summer. The
former Community Resource Center (CRC)
is now administrative offices. The change
was necessary because of the housing crunch
caused by the high enrollment this year. Offices line the outside walls, and the center of
the room has chairs and partitions.
"I don't know what they will do with the
middle of the room," said Dean Gross. "During the working day there are some limitations for its use."
"The administration does not want students to use that space," said Edgar Lee, last
year's CRC coordinator. "It is their meeting

room was
used only
for dances, parties, teas, and other special
occasions for about a decade.
In the 19405, the room became the social
center of the College, known to the students
as "Commons." It was "never empty from
sunrise to well after sunset." On December
12, 1947, The Phoenix explained that "With

it as a center for the council, volunteer organizations, and other groups, for storage and
meeting space," said Dean Gross.
These groups now meet in Bond, Parrish

workplace and storage space," said Lee.
"S warthmore has a definite need for a student
center where people can meet and gather to
share resources and ideas."

the halls of Swarthmore,
the humming and beeping of computers resound, a blue glow illuminates
coundess faces, and printers spit out page
after page. Every office has a computer with
someone busy at work. A walk
through thedorms reveals people
glued to their computers, working on papers due the next day,
fiddling with e-mail or playing
games incessantly.
There are plenty of opportunity on campus to feed this computer habit. According to Mary
Hasbrouck, academic computing
coordinator, Swarthmore College owns 839 computers, all Macintoshes.
Two hundred seventy-five of these computers are used in administrative offices and 190
in faculty offices. There are 121 computers in

department, teaching and research labs, 44 in
computer classrooms and 69 in public areas.
Five more are central servers that everyone
can use.
No one knows exactly how many students
own computers. Hasbrouck estimates that
one-half to three-fourths ofSwarthmore students have their own computers-since there are 1440
students currently on campus, that's between 720 and
1080 additional computers.
She plans to run a survey
this fall to determine exactly how many computers
are in use on campus.
Even if only 720 students
own their own computers,
that's 1559 computers at Swarthmore—more
computers on campus than students. So, if
there are so many computers, how come you
can't get near one around finals?

open their eyes to this new day for the first

they have never seen before. This new day,
the new thoughts and experiences that await
them, are trumpeted into life by the strident
buzz of the clock.

Joseph quickly turns and whacks his clock
silent. He sits up and rubs his eyes. "Ah,

into his notebooks with a pen.
Joseph wanders in wonder from class to

romances of the heart and the world and the
universe that will be unlocked! There is so

Joseph feels himself being tested, really
tested, and is learning so many incredible
thoughts.

Gingko and Squash: Art Faculty Perspectives
By

Gabriel Cumming

&

Members of

Rachel McKnight
On our way to interview Paul King,
visiting instructor of Studio Arts, Rachel
noticed a small tree behind Parrish Hall; it
was labelled in Scott Arboretum fashion
and proved to be a ginkgo, as she had
surmised. A minute later we peered into
Professor King's class; at that exact moment he was drawing the outline of a
ginkgo leaf on the chalkboard.
Paul King certainly appreciates such
moments. In fact, when we asked him
"Where do the ideas for your art come
from?" he immediately responded, "From
the moment."
"I paint exclusively from life," he elaborated, "feeding from what's in front of
me." While painting from the imagination
can turn ideas into cliches, you "can't
beat" real life for "intensity [and] diversity."
So what real life does Paul try to set
down on canvas (or wood-he currently
favors the texture of oil on wood panel)?
"People, still life, landscape"—he's done
it all. In his dashing younger days—not so
long ago—he worked largely outdoors,
"out in the motif," painting the flames
spouting from a refinery in the dead of
night, for example.
More recently Paul has focused on still
life paintings; three are featured in the
Swarthmore Art Department exhibit, open
at the List Gallery from September 4
through September 29. Unlike nature or
people, still life is a "controlled situation,"
and Paul is glad to take control. "The
objects don't arrange themselves" he admitted; each composition is carefully predetermined.
An arrangement thatPaul thinks worked
particularly well resulted in the painting
Squash. He describedthepicture as a simple
composition—a squash alone on a table—incorporating subtle use of spaceand color
but "stripped ofall artifice." Simple, direct
art allows Paul to express himself most
clearly. He doesn't claim to consciously
assert himself in his art, but he makes
himself known through the directness of
his image. An artist's motive, he said,
quoting Robert Motherwell, is to "cut
through the self-deception."
We wondered how Paul managed to cut
through distraction and self-deception to
maintain a time for doing art each day.
"The main plight of all artists," he conceded, is how "to make the time" for their
craft. The necessity of self-discipline, he
said, is the drawback of "self-structured
employment." Employment for Paul has
meant thehectic pursuit ofclasses he wants
to teach, inplaces he wants to work. After
eight years at the University ofthe Arts in
Philadelphia, and four overlapping years
at Moravian College, he has joined the

John Waters has found his niche in unearthing the weirdly grotesque underbelly of
suburbia: everything in his world looks nice
and funny and shiny on top, like an Aqua-net
gloss, but you laugh uneasily, anticipating
the creepy things that might be lying just
below the surface. Still, it would probably be
a shame to go our entire lives without seeing
at least one of his many weird and wonderful

films.
Hairspray is his off-the-wall 1988 attempt.
Set in the early 19605, it stars everybody's
favorite actress cum talk-show host Ricki
Lake as Tracy Turnblad, a hefty high schooler
with gigantic hair who gets her shot at fame
after winning a permanent dance spot on the
American Bandstand-esque Corny Collins
show. But Tracy soon gets a firsthand lesson
in the prejudicial attitudes of her hometown
Baltimore when she realizes that Corny's is

Henson tried hard to make this movie darker
and less happy-smiley than his most famous
creation, the Muppet Show; and so this movie
features deaths and torture scenes, murder
and betrayal.
Luckily, such disturbing themes (muppets
and murder?) are balanced by the whimsical
beauty of the setting, the skills of the puppeteers and voice talent, and the sense of wonder that the movie creates in the viewer.

A Tour of the Exhibit
Our idea of a subtle humble squash turned
out to be completely different from Paul's.
The day after we talked to Paul, we were able
to meet with Andrea Packard, the exhibit

director and a contributing artist. She led us
through the exhibit, showing us the results of
the latest "discoveries and journeys" of the
art department faculty.
"Seeing other people's artwork makes us
sensitive to patterns, colors and relationships
that we would otherwise take for granted or
be blind to," Andrea commented. Such was
the case with King's Squash, which turned
out to be so intensely textured and richly
colored that it was hardly a "still life." With
its unusual angle and demanding background,
Squash certainly portrayed a dramatic "moment" in time.
In contrast to the bold works done by King,

Randall Exon's paintings are a muted version
of a still-complex reality. All of his pictures
are in that sort of day that happens all the
time. His paintings look to be softly familiar
while incorporating abstract shapes and colors. A closer inspection of apainting revealed
a lost shoe melting into the grass, seemingly
extraneous but actually essential to the dynamics of the painting.
"Many people think that art is all about
form and not about color," remarked Andrea.
"Actually, you can see a very distinct palette
for each artist." As an example, she pointed
out how "organic" Syd Carpenter's sculptures are as compared with the other works.
By using acrylics to paint the fired clay, the
resulting patina has a natural, "intrinsic" look.
Andrea explained to us that in order to promote the organic feel of the sculptures instead of an "object on display" feeling, the
display pedestals were painted gray instead
of the usual white.
The importance of presentation is also apparent when looking at the series of paintings
done by Celia Reisman. Andrea explained
that "certain groupings emerge" when she is
trying to figure out how to display the artwork. Reisman's paintings of a suburban
residency are more "intimate" and "quietly
framed," and so they go together in pairs all
on one wall.
Scattered throughout the room we saw the
vibrant sculptures of Brian Meunier. His art
is inspired by folk art and by primitive art,
and it seems to be playfully asking us whether
it has a purpose or not. Meunier places every-

If you had to choose between art and teaching, could you? we asked. Are the two separable? For Paul, teaching art is inseparable
from art itself—he teaches about what he
loves, just like he paints. In the end, though,
he is an artist. A class, after all, requires the
preparation of a lesson plan. To enter his

copper tubes and weathered birdhouses
with the look of new glass jars and carefully carved owls.
As a reflection of herself, Andrea said
that art shows "what I'm drawn to in the
world around me: in finding mystery,
meaning, surprise and beauty."
Her displayed woodcuts reveal the inspiration she finds in nature. Using a precise etching needle, Andrea creates a delicate "atmospheric feeling" by exploring
how individual marks can each be expressive. Her pieces are what she describes as
"elusive," being hard to read all at once
due to the complexity of the way she fills
her space with varying degrees of light and
dark ink.
Andrea sees the purpose of the exhibit
not only as a way to display the strength
and diversity of the art department faculty,
but also as a way for students to learn. The
gallery is a "library of ideas and techniques that students can take inspiration
from," she says. "The creative problems in
art have parallels in poetry, science, music
and dance. We can learn about our own
discipline through others. Art is a learning
process."
A Swarthmore graduate herself ('B5),
Andrea appreciates the value of such diversity in education. "The gallery is a
forum for what can happen through
growth," she explained, a sort of "mutual
dialogue" between students and teachers.

The Dark Crystal is a fairy tale, but not a
whitewashed Disney melodrama. Rather, it
is an epic quest, complete with mystic mentors who must be consulted, an ancient prophesy, a journey into the land of death, a battle

against overwhelming evil. Joseph Campbell
would be proud. Here, the evil is Evil, and
thus scary. The good are Muppets, and thus
funny. You will laugh and you will shudder;
the movie has something for everyone.
Casting the movie entirely with puppets
gives it a story-telling power, linking it with
a centuries-old tradition of puppet theatre.
They give the movie a dreamlike, surreal
quality that makes the funny scenes thatmuch
funnier, and the dark scenes that much darker
and more terrifying. The Dark Crystal takes
what Henson tried to do in Labyrinth and
succeeds.
SWJL will be showing The Dark Crystal

Basquiat Becomes a Legend
By

lan Bricke

Julian Schnabel's Basquiat is a film that
transcends itself. By turns sloppy and inspired, perfunctory and astonishing, it is
unwaveringly passionate and achieves an
emotional effect both stunning and haunting.
The rise and fall of Jean Michel Basquiat—graffiti artist, painter, toast of the 'Bos New
York gallery scene, confidante of Andy
Warhol, drug addict—is a natural. All the
components are here for a good old-fashioned Hollywood rags-to-riches epic. But
Basquiat didn't fit the mold, and neither does
the film which bears his name.
Basquiat (Jeffrey Wright) was thefirst black
artist to be embraced by the lily white New
York art establishment. From his first meeting with art critic and starmaker Rene Ricard
(Michael Wincott), he was a legend in the
making. Almost overnight, his paintings were
selling for many thousands of dollars, his
gallery openings were elbow to elbow with
the beautiful people, and his name was
splashed across every headline in the city.
Along the way, his already fragile world fell
apart. His relationship with Gina Cardinale
(Claire Forlani), the love of his life, succumbed to infidelity and addiction.
The pervasive racism of the art world
patrons and dealers and the journalists who
could look him in the face and ask him how he
felt about being "the pickaninny of the art
world" —assaulted him at every turn. In the
end the film implies that drugs and mental
illness, led him away into a private and perfectly isolated fantasy world in which he died
at the age of 27, victim of a heroin overdose.
Basquiat's life was not necessarily a happy
one, and Basquiat is not a happy film. Jeffrey
Wright's Basquiat seems stoned, detached,
and elsewhere. He is an intensely passive
character, sometimes playfully, sometimes
desperately. Wright, who won a Tony for his
interpretation of Belize in the Broadway production of Angels in America, turns in the
best performance of the year. His face captured in close-up, he finds the depth and
beauty in this man, the tears and the agony, as
well as the painter's almost reflexive joy of
creation.
When Schnabel shows Basquiat painting,
—

you believe it. Wright's performance and
Schnabel's recreations of Basquiat's paintings belong together.
Wright is supported by a wonderful cast of
characters, many of them sly caricatures of
the Manhattan scene of which Basquiat and
Schnabel were fixtures. First among equals is
David Bowie's Andy Warhol, a performance
of wit and genuine, albeit rigorously deadpan, warmth. It is obvious that Warhol sees
much of himself in the young upstart, and
equally obvious that Warhol becomes the
only real friend that Basquiat has. The scenes
in which Basquiat and Warhol take turns
painting over each other's art offer the film
much-needed comic relief.
As the ecstatically flamboyant Rene Ricard,
Michael Wincott leaves behind his image as
decadent Hollywood bad guy (Strange Days
and The Crow) and makes an indelible impression. As usual, Benicio Del Toro (The
Usual Suspects), playing Basquiat's friend,
Benny Dalmau, runs away with his every
scene.
In what are essentially supporting roles,
Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary
Oldman (playing a Schnabel stand-in), and
Courtney Love flesh out sketchily-written
roles with passion and restraint. And Claire
Forlani, although trapped in a few too many
domestic scenes, makes clear the
love that Gina feels for Basquiat, and the pain
of watching his disintegration.
Schnabel, famous (or notorious) painter
and art world celebrity, is a first-time writer
and director. That probably explains why
every third or fourth scene in Basquiat falls
flat under the weight of creaky dialogue and
amateurish staging (the first scenes between
Gina and Basquiat are particularly messy).
The film stumbles, but it never falls. Making brilliant use of mixed-media and video
images, surreal visions of surfers gliding
above the New York skyline, and the colors
and textures of Basquiat's paintings,
Schnabel's direction is poetic, vivid, and exu-

berant.
Carried by the intensity of its performances,
a near-perfect soundtrack, the jazzy poetry of
its images, and the urgency of Schnabel's
memorial to a lost friend, Basquiat triumphs.
It is moving, beautiful, and heartbreaking.

Alumni Meet: Memories of Hoagies & Beer Duzenski:
From NBA
to Swat
By

Nevin Katz and Sarah
McClure

Swarthmore's annual Alumni

Cross Country meet offered a festive
prelude to the upcoming season this
weekend. Careening through a 5K
(3.1 mile) course that wound around
the athletic fields, through the Crum
woods, across Parrish field, and finally onto the track, the teams scrimmaged against Widener, PSPC, and a
number of returning alumni.
The numerous alumni whoreturned
to compete withthe college kids were,
as always, a strong highlight to this
event. Among the more recent graduates were GeneVann '95,Brenn Jones
'96, Tom Fowler '96, John Freeman
'96, Scott Reents '96, Matt Reed '96,
Ingrid Spies '96, Ginger Lewis 'B3,
and Amanda Fine '93. In addition,
several long time veterans made appearances, such as Dave Holland '56,
who competed in his 19th alumni

race.

Some of these alumni came to recapture the memories of cross
country' s teamworkand competition.
Others, such as Fowler, came for "the
hoagies and beer." For the team, it

was not only an opportunity to catch
up with old friends, but it was a great
way for them to jump into a competitive situation under very little pressure, and to get into the mindset of
racing against the clock, against other
runners, and against the terrain.
On the men's side, Wy n Strodtbeck

in sixth at 22:12, Shallini Ayyagari in

For some, the experience was quite
rewarding; it gave the teammates a
sense of where they were abilitywise, what parts of the race they
needed to work on, and what to reach
for in the rest of the season. Women's
captain Danielle Wall '9B was very

excited about the team's "strong
middle pack and healthy attitude."
Marissa Colston 'OO felt it was "a
great way to start the season because
the atmosphere was light hearted and
relaxed, and there was good food."
For others, it was a crash course in
reality. Such was the prophecy of
Vann, claiming that "we may be legendary, but we're not in great shape."

Reents, who had run the 5K six

that "I felt like dog. I gotta cut back

was also a great way for upper
classmen to catch up on where the
alumni were.
Spies plans to begin work at the
Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute in Boston, while Vann, although
"still confused," is working as a lab
tech and coaching runners in North
Carolina. Reents is working with the
Gardener Group,an information technology consulting firm, while Free-

man is working for a publishing company. Reed is student teaching in
Philadelphia, and Fowler was working as a gas attendant in New England while preparing to move to
Boston and get his Engineering degree. There were also whispers of
former captain Steve Laubach '96,
who is conducting biological research
in Costa Rica.
All in all, the meet was a highspirited way to begin the season. This
coming weekend, both men's and
women's cross-country teams will
go down to Lebanon Valley, where
they will receive their first dose of
real intercollegiate competition. Even
at this point in the season, there are
many things to be excited about; the
enthusiasm of Coach Ted Dixon and
new assistant coach Erika Chiavetta,
as well as of captains Wall, Alison
Schirmer '97, Strodtbeck, and Kerry
Boeye '97.
Also, the team unity, which was
helped along this year by the preseason, is stronger than before. Combined with the exceptional experience on the men' s team and the depth
of the women's team, expectations
for the season are high.

Garnet Tide Fails to Capsize
the Newport Shipbuilders

By

Alex Lundry

As the GarnetTide left Swarthmore

last Friday afternoon, the rain was
slowly beginning. Thoughts of horrible playing conditions for the next
day's game against Newport News
Apprentice School in Southern Virginia flew through their heads.
For all they knew, the game could
have been canceled due to Hurricane
Fran. Unfortunately for the Garnet,
Saturday brought about a beautifully
hot day in Virginia and at the same

time a loss of 42-21 for the Tide.
While the Garnet's defenseshowed
hope in the first quarter, they were
continually pounded down by the impressive backfield of the Shipbuilders. On the other side of the ball, the
offense played extremely well. Pat
Straub '97 led the offense with his
passing attack, continually utilizing
receivers Pete Karacki '9B and Brian
Bell '99. Straub finished the game
with 160 yards passing, successfully
finding people thirteen times on
twenty-four attempts.
TheTide began the game with confidence and scored the first points of
the game late in the first quarter.
Straub rolled out to find a wide-open
Karacki for a 67 yard touchdown
pass. Instead of triggering the Garnet, this play succeeded in stirring up
the Shipbuilders to a frenzy. They
quickly returned the favor on the next
drive and scored to tie the game.
On the Shipbuilders successive
drive, they marched down the field
and pounded in another score to take
a 14-7 lead. The Garnet quickly retaliated, and Straub connected on
another touchdown pass, this time to
Bell. However, the Garnet coaching
staff called for a two-point conversion on the try for point, and the
Shipbuilders stopped them. The Gar-

net still trailed 14-13.

At the end ofthe second quarter the
Shipbuilders added another score and
led 21-13 entering halftime.
The second half was not the best
football the Tide had ever played.
The Shipbuilders scored three unanswered touchdowns against a Garnet
defense that was falling apart at the
seams. Finally, on the last drive of the
game, J.P. Harris '99 led adrive from
his quarterback position thatended in
another Garnet touchdown. Harris
connected with Bell in the endzone
for Bell's second touchdown reception of the day.
At this point, the drive was more of
a mental victory for the Tide, because
the clock had nearly expired, and the
Shipbuilders were still up 42-21. With
no hurricane in sight and a beautiful
day on hand, the Tide was simply
overpowered by the imposing offensive and defensive lines of the Shipbuilders coupled with their outstanding backfield and competent receivers.
The Tide now move on to their

challenge: hosting Johns
Hopkins University on September 21.
This gamefollows a bye week for the
Garnet, during which they plan to

Swarming Earthworms Send
Tremors into the Void
By

Dave Lewis

Swarming Earthworm captains
Dave Sacker '97 and Tim Sibley '9B
made an auspicious debut at Lehigh
last Saturday, leading the team to a 40 record that included wins over rivals Haverford and Penn.
Their first opponent were the hosts,
the Lehigh A squad. Swarthmore
began the game with a zone defense
to take advantage of their experience
against the crew of youngsters from
Lehigh. By half, the score was 7-0 in
favor of the Earthworms. Although
the Swarm's defense was far from
flawless, they were helped by numerous unforced errors by the Lehigh

offense.
By the time the game to a merciful
close, the score was 13-0, the first
shutout any of the Swarthmore veterans could rememberand a good omen
as the Earthworms looked at the rest

of the A pool that would fill the rest
of their day: Haverford, Bucknell,
and Penn.
After a second round bye,
Swarthmore was wary of their
friendly rivals from Haverford, with
their long history of defeat pulled
from the jaws of victory. However,
as with the Lehigh game, experience
would help lead the Earthworms to
victory. John Christodouleas '9B and
Ali Momeni '97 led the offense to a
12-4 win at the time cap, with a
combined 12 assists for the game.
The Bucknell game started with a
MudShark score, the first time all
day that the opposing team had entered the endzone before the Earthworms. Keyed by the defense of
Momeni and ex-captain Robin
Mandel '97, Swarthmore stormed
back with seven straight points to a 71 lead at halftime. The trend would

continue through the game's finish,
with the final score 13-3 for the Earthworms.
Carrying a 3-0 record and facing
the possibility of an undefeated day
and a tournament championship, the
team looked to tangle with the Void

just three points short of victory.
Penn's captains were not about to let
the Earthworms run away with the
game, and called a time-out that

Women's
Rugby
By

Jennifer Philpott

The women'srugby team has been
practicing hard for thepast two weeks,
although they do not have a game
until Saturday, September 21. Since
the team has a tough schedule this
season, they got started early in order
to be well prepared for their first
match against Bucknell. In theweeks
following this first match,
Swarthmore will be facing division
rivals University of Pennsylvania,
University of Delaware, Bryn Mawr,
and Princeton, the reigning national
champions.
In the first week of practice the
new players, or the rookies as they
are affectionately called, met the returning players. Rugby is a skillintensive sport, and thefirst weeks of
practice are spent learning the essentials, such as rucking, tackling, posting, passing, running lines, and kicking. The experienced players have
been providing examples and helping to lead the new players in drills
all week.
The team is coached by two student captains, Hanan Hussein '97
and Andrea Barnett '97. Hussein is
the forward captain and will be playing as a flanker, or loose forward, as
she has for the past three seasons.
Hussein is proving that she is not
only a tough rugger and truly deserving of the Human Truck Award which
she won in a past season, but that she
also provides a great deal of support
and leadership on the field.
Her partner, Barnett, is the captain
for the backs and will be playing at
inside center, where she has also
played for several seasons. Barnett
has been busy getting the team started
off well with certain skills like tackling and running lines, two areas in
which she excels.
Barnett commented, "Hanan and I
are very excited about the potential
being shown by the rookies on the
team this season as well as the consistent dedication of our more experienced players."
Although the team is not large in
number this season, they are demonstrating enough enthusiasm to compensate for this lack of players. On
Saturday night, the women's rugby
team will throw a fundraising party
in Olde Club in order to foster team
bonding and raise money.
Additionally, the captains would
like to stress that anyone is welcome
to come give women's rugby a try, if
only for a day. The team practices on
Tuesday and Wednesday at 4:15 and
Friday at 5:00 on Dupont Field.

Sport Information Director (SID)
Mark Duzenski has followed a long
and memorable path to his current
position at Swarthmore College,
where he has impressed many with
his unquestionable dedication and attention to detail.
After graduating from Trenton
State, Duzenski worked as an intern
for NFL Films in New York. During
the 1988 season, he maintained the
tape fileroomand delivered the Monday Night Football highlights package to networks in Manhattan.
Having completed his internship,
Duzenski wentto work forElectronic
Data Systems, a company founded
by billionaireand two-timepresidential candidate Ross Perot. Taking advantage of a generous employee stock
purchase plan, he was able to save a
tidy sum which he used to make one
of his childhood dreams come true.
With a collectionof approximately
one quarter million cards, Duzenski
opened his own baseball card shop.
However, speculation and overexpansion inflated the market and created the potential for a massive crash.
Luckily, he was able to escape before
he lost money.
Returning to school at Arkansas
State University, Duzenski pursued a
degree in communications. With his
eyes set on becoming a radio broadcaster, he saw his dream slip through
his fingers when the rights to broadcast the Arkansas State games were
sold to a statewide station, who had
their own ideas for a broadcaster.
He then moved back home to New
Jersey and joined the Spectrum Events
Staff where he got to meet some industry insiders. He took an internship
with the Philadelphia 76ers in 199394. For the 76ers he organized the
halftime and commercial time
courtside promotionals. In addition,
he spent time in public relations, promotions, marketing, and the ticket

office.
By this point, Duzenski had been
introduced to a wide variety of people,
one of whom was able to get him a job
at Division I Monmouth University

as the women' s SID. But when he got
the opportunity at Swarthmore he
had to take it.
"All I knew was that I would be the
boss and get to run the show the way
I wanted to. It started with the card
shop, which presented me a perfect
opportunity [to be his own boss],"
said Duzenski.
Duzenski is already a fixture at
home events ofall sorts. This year he
plans to make at least one road game
for every sport.
One of Duzenski's major projects
has been to research the records and
statistics for all Swarthmore varsity
programs while incorporating the
records from teams that keep their
own statistics. He hopes to eventually put together media guides for
every team. Currenrly, these guides
are only available for football and
men's and women's basketball.
Lacrosse and field hockey are two
sports which would immediately benefit from such guides. Since many of
the players are local products, they
are often featured in area newspapers. The guides would make it easier
for student-athletes to be featured.
Swimming too would benefit since
both the men's and women's teams
are coming off outstanding seasons
in which they were the subject of
much media attention.
On top of his other responsibilities
Duzenski has agreed to take over as
golf coach in the spring. He seems
happy in Swarthmore's relaxed atmosphere. "I finally found the job
that I love to do. I don't have to wear
a suit and tie every day." It's a good
thing too because he works ten to
twelve hour days, seven days a week.

Volleyball Team
Shows "Flashes of
What They Could Be"
By

David Lischer

Hoping to enact a measure of revenge against an Albright team that
stole a five-set victory from the Garnet last season, the Swarthmore
women's volleyball team took to the
road on Tuesday. Unfortunately, they
spent more time on the road than they
had planned. Bogged down in rushhour traffic, the team arrived more
than thirty minutes late for the match
and were forced to forfeit the first
game.
With no warm-up, the team took
the court, but the rigors of the trip and
the jitters of the first game of the
season combined to undermine the
Garnet's comeback efforts. Albright
swept the match in three games. Under different circumstances, it was a
game that the Garnet could have won.
On the whole, the team did not
show the ballcontrol that CoachLarry
Perry has been emphasizing. In addi-

tion the debut of the Garnet's secret
weapon,Rebeka Ndosi '97, has been
delayed until Friday.
Although it was an inauspicious
beginning, the Garnet carry confidence into Friday's match at
Wilmington and their first home
match of the year against Franklin
and Marshall on Tuesday.
The Garnet did get an opportunity
to work out some of the kinks after
the Albright match. The teams continuedto play after the regular match
to allow the now warmed-up Garnet
some practice time. "We showed
some flashes of what our team could
be," said Heather Stickney '9B.

Field Hockey Defeats Hopkins on Turf
But Elizabethtown
Shuts Out Swat
on Grass
By

Jean Quinn

The field hockey team traveled to
Johns Hopkins University last Saturday for their first conference game.
They returned to Swarthmore victorious, having beaten their opponent
2-1 in an intensely fought match that
went down to the wire. In yesterday's
match against Elizabethtown College, they were not as fortunate and
were shut out, 0-1.
Saturday's win was a major one
for Swarthmore, which suffered a
loss earlier last week against the
College ofNotre Dame of Maryland,
because Hopkins is the only team
that plays on turf. That fact should
have put Hopkins at a big advantage,
but the Swarthmore players had prepared themselves for the faster surface by practicing indoors. Lia Ernst
'97 said that her team's stickwork
was superior to Hopkins'. Sweeper
Jen Hagan '99 made some excellent
stops in the game and said that "we

Against Elizabethtown, the Lady
Garnet controlled the ball for most
of the game. At the end of the first
half, Swarthmore, sparked by the
Duffy's aggressive play, had a flurry
of scoring opportunities. Hagan

blocks and cleared the ball out of
the defensive zone quickly on several occasions.

day.

On Saturday, the team tied
Scranton 1-1 in a double-overtime
game.

"They played a great game against
Scranton. They left their hearts on
the field after that game," said Acting Head Coach Don Norton.
Norton has been an Assistant
Coach of the team for four years. He
is acting as the Head Coach while
Wayne McKinney is out of town on
business.

Norton felt that the team members

displayed exemplary dedication during this game. "Some guys literally
did not leave the field for the entire
120 minutes," Norton said.
One ofthose dedicated players was
Dave "In-the-Fast" Lane '97. Lane,
one of the co-captains of the team,
twisted his ankle and did not play on
Sunday or on Wednesday.
On Sunday, the team lost to Stevens
Tech 3-1, but they are looking forward to a rematch on September 25.
Kyle "House ofStyle" Barnett '97,
another co-captain, attributed the
loss, at least in part, to the team's
numerous injuries. "Our offense on

"return-to-basics" strategy, the Garnet
walked onto Clothier Field with a new
air of confidence after two frustrating
seasons of losing records.
In the opening game on Saturday, the
Garnet defeated Ursinus College 2-0 in
a rather physical match with lenient
officiating. Defender Diana Hunt '99
started the scoring with a goal assisted
by mid-fielder Jen Vander Veer '99,
who delivered a crisp crossing pass in
front of the Ursinus to set up Hunt.
The second goal came from Kirsten
Knox '99, a center midfielder who
pounded the goal off an assist by Betsy
Rosenbaum '9B in the second half.

Ursinus College attempted to score for
the rest of the game,but the Swarthmore
defense led by first-year sweeper
Rebecca, Schmidt 'OO frustrated the
Ursinus front line.
In the championship game on Sunday, the Garnet came out against a
skilled Beaver College team which had
previously defeated Albright College
on Saturday to advance to the championship round. After an evenly matched

Sunday was very unorganized because
we lost some players to injuries," said
Barnett.
Norton believed that another factor
in this loss was the size of the field.
"We've had to play on tiny fields,
which I guess are good for some teams,
but a large field is more for skillful
play. This is what the team is used to,"
he said.
He also felt that the team was somewhat dehydrated from playing in the
hot sun and did not have enough time
to recuperate from the first game in
order to prepare for the second game.
On Wednesday, though, the Garnet
beat Albright 3-1. "We were able to
compensate better for the injuries.
We changed our tactics for the offense," said Barnett, who also
complimented the team's first years,
saying that the new players are beginning to adjust to the Swarthmore style.
"Everyone is doing real well. [The
freshman class] is a real big class and
we really appreciated everyone's enthusiasm and support," said Barnett.
The outstanding players included
Amber "Waves of Grain" Thompson
'97, another co-captain who scored
two goals, and Joel "Always Flirtin'"
Yurdin '99, who scored one goal.
Scott "I Only Smoke Camels" Samels
'9B assisted for two of those goals.
The Garnet's next home game is
Sunday at 2:00 when they'll face a
talented squad from Drew. Next
Wednesday they hit the road to challenge Division II Millersville.

Despite a few disappointing losses,

scored the game's only goal with 28
minutes remaining in the second
half, when Hopkins was out of the
box. Assistant coach Julie Mazer
said that "the team worked really
hard and did not give up," and the
team continued to battle fiercely for
a goal even in the game's final seconds.
She said, "We will definitely learn
from this and will get ready for
Saturday's league game against
Western Maryland."

first half with many quality plays from
Swarthmore, the teams remained scoreless at half-time.
Despite a goal scored by a Beaver
forward in the second half, the
Swarthmore women picked up the level
of play and intensity. Sarah Jacquette
'9B responded with an unassisted goal
with a beautiful shot through the Beaver defense. The teams remained tied
throughout regular playing time.
Despite fatigue,

Swarthmore played

an intense and physical thirty minutes
ofdouble-overtime soccer. No goal was
scored by either team. By NCAA regu-

lations, the match officially ended as
a tie for both of the teams; however,

the teams moved into a shoot-out to
determine who would win the coveted tournament trophy. Five players
from each squad were asked to kick a
penalty shot against the opposing
keeper. At the end of this nerve-racking competition, Swarthmore and
Beaver still remained in a tie. To
break the tie, the shoot-out continued
until a Beaver player delivered an
unstoppable shot which Swarthmore
did not match. Thus, the tournament
trophy was awarded to Beaver College.
"We got off to a great start and
everyone who played contributed to
the [team's] success in the tournament," saidAssistant Coach Pat Gress.
"There was a lot of teamwork and
there were a lot of positive things
happening on the field. The team
should be proud of how they began
the season."
However, the taxing weekend
gamesand class conflicts for key players did take their toll on the
Swarthmore squad, who fell to Widener 6-0 on Tuesday. With a strong
performance, goalkeeper Anne Holland '99 recorded 14 saves in
Tuesday's game.
Led by captain Claire Baxter '9B,
this year's team is a good mix of
rookie talent and experienced returning players. If the effort and play
demonstrated in the past weekend's
tournament is indicative of the upcoming season, then Swarthmore soccer can look forward to a season of
quality soccer with many victories.
This coming Saturday, the team
will travel to Misericordia for an afternoon match and will begin a long
road trip, which ends in a home game
on Saturday, September 28 against
Western Maryland College.

format. This new idea, implemented by
Captains Gabi Kruks-Wisner '99 and
Mandy Hourihan '9B, involves the usual
skill-training and scrimmaging but also
more running. Their goal is to foster
both technique and stamina in the
Warmothers.
While the Warmothers lost a few key
players to study abroad programs and
the soccer season, the preliminary meetings and practices brought an influx of
almost a dozen rookies.
"The new players are picking up the
rules and techniques really quickly. I
am expecting them to be tremendous
contributors to the team on and off the
field. They have a lot of enthusiasm,"
said Emily Rice-Townsend '9B, the
1995 Rookie of the Year.
On offense, the handlers have a lot of
experience and are led by team founders
Courtney Harter '97, returning to the
Warmothers after a semester in Australia, and Katy Harrod '97. Filling in the
other handler spots will be KruksWisner, Cathy Wirth '99, Becca Neff

'97, and Maria Khan '97.
Leading the mids will be Hourihan
and Leslianne Yen '9B. Other contributors will include Rice-Townsend,
Mina Kim '99, and Jill Eaton '99.
The team also anxiously awaits the
return of former captain Lena
Loewenthal '97 from injury. Kate
Walker '9B, TobieBarton *99, Ashley
Flynn '9B, and Corinne Bright '9B
will make the long cuts.
The novice players will be filling in
the cracks as they try out a variety of
positions. "Our offense, with a little
practice, has the potential to a potent
force in the league this year. Now we
need to buckle down and learn some
hardcore defense," said Wirth. The
Warmothers, while tuning their manto-man and zone defenses, will be
developing a third type, the clam.
This strategy combines elements of
zone and man-to-man defenses.
The upcoming season should be an
exciting one for the Warmothers. They
will battle it out at tournaments at
Bucknell and Lehigh and home
matches against Haverford, Penn and
Princeton. The only question that remains is: Who will wear the skirt in
this family?
