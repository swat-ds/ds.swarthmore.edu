VP Bill Spock
Will Retire

What is Fate of
the Public
Policy Program?

By Giridhar Srinivasan
William T. Spock *5l, Vice President of
Business and Finance, will be retiring at the end
of this academic year. Spock became a Vice
President in October, 1989. after serving as the
Secretary of the Board of Managers for eight
years and also serving as Vice Chairman of the
Finance Committee.
Spock has beenassociated with Swarthmore
ever since his enrollment as a student, in 1947.
He graduatedwith Honors in 1951 with a double
major in Math and Physics, and has been associated with the College in one manner or another, including as a parent, ever since.
Spock has many fond memories of his time
here as a student. He believes that the College
has changed over the years and thatit has kept
in tune with changes in society, although he
also believes that it is academically less difficult today than it was when he was a student,
when classes were held six days a week, and
students carried five credits each semester. He
believes, however, that such aspects of the
College as the intensity, intellectual atmosphere,
and the close relationship between the students
and the faculty has remained the same.
He believes that increased support facilities
and the adoption ofinterculturalism have greatly
enhanced campus life. His only regret in looking back at his tenure as Vice President is that
he has not able to interact with students to a
significant extent, but he is still happy to have
been able to work at Swarthmore.
In the last five years, he has helped to bring
several important new facilities to the College,
including the voice mail system and computer
network connections in the dormrooms. He has
been in charge of practically every non-aca-

demic facility on campus, from the management of the College's endowment, to the maintenance of the buildings, to the supervising of
the food service, and the Scott Arboretum. He
has been responsible for hiring Linda Fox,
Personnel Director, Claire Sawyer, Director of
the Scott Arboretum, and Larry Schall, Vice
President for Facilities and Services.
Dean NginaLythcott describes Spock as "an
unusualblendof a man who has all theskills to
do his complex job that provides major support
to all parts of the College, but he has the
intelligence and intellectual curiosity that is
typical of a Swarthmore alum, and a compassion for human beings that lets him better
understand, care about and support all parts of
the college that help to make us who we are."
It is because of what Lythcott describes as
his "extraordinary communication style" with
his colleagues that Schall describes Spock as
having been "a wonderful teacher for me." He
has also "greatly helped the image of the business and finance group within the Swarthmore

community. His integrity and steady common
sense in dealing with all constituents has really
been an asset to all of us," according to Meryle

Rinker, Director of Financial Operations and
Controller.
"It is going to be almost impossible to find
someone to succeed Bill," said Harry Gotwals,
Vice President in charge of Alumni, Development, and PublicRelations. "In fact, that's why
we are reducing the number of responsibilities
that the new person is going to be in charge of."
Spock's successor will no longer be in charge
of either the administrative computing facilities or the buildings and grounds. He/she will
also have differentfunctions with respect to the
planning of long-term financial issues and the
coordination of other types of long-range plan-

ning.
The selection committeeis looking for someone who can fit into the Swarthmore environment very well and can interact with people
from different groups, said Gotwals. He also

alternative funding sources withinthe College
for students, whichinclude grants obtainablein
the natural and social sciences divisions and for
Peace and Conflict studies. However, these
funds are not intended directly for the Public
Policy program.
Provost JennieKeith is chair of the Council
on Educational Policy (CEP), which is comprised of six elected faculty members, one
student, and President Al Bloom. The council
is presently reviewing the role of concentrations in the curriculum and deciding what sort
of resources shouldbe allocated to them. Keith
expressed her concern for the present lack of
Public Policy funds, saying, "Internships and
research positions for students are a high priority forme." As in the currentrenovationprojects
on campus, multiple demands for funding make
these decisions complicated.

entitled "From Harlem to Hip-Hop:
An Evening with Nikki Giovanni,"
she will discuss the black arts movement, the connection between black
arts and revolutionary struggle, and
theposition of a creative artist in the
intellectual academy as outlined in
herlatest book, Racism 101 According to Bradley, "She's not an artist
who has compromised her own message, or conceded to a particular structure or ideology."
Bradley sees Giovanni's visit to
the College as a chance to question
and examine the methods of thinking
adopted by intellectual institutions
such as Swarthmore. "Many black
folks —students, staff, workers, faculty go through Swarthmore feeling an inability to fully express themselves because the College, in many
ways, is fundamentally in opposition

In September of this year, three external
reviewers came to Swarthmore to evaluate the
Public Policy program. The reviewers' reports
are now being processedby an internalreview
committee which hopes to draw up a final
report by the end of this semester. Because the
Public Policy program is currently facing a lack
of funds, thereviewers specifically considered
future support of the program, especially regarding the role the College should play in
providing funds for summer internships.
ThePublic Policy program, initiated in 1977,
is an interdisciplinary concentration requiring
six or more courses, a thesis on a chosen policy
topic, and participation in an internship. Fields
of policy focus include development, education, welfare, environment, and health.
In the past, the program has been funded
through a seriesof outside sources. The money
was non-taxable and the standard amount was
$2OOO for domestic internships and $2BOO for
international internships. Now, themoneyfrom
these grants has almost completely run out.
Political Science Professor Ray Hopkins,
Coordinator of the Public Policy Program, expressed his concern over the lack of funding.
"Since internships are required, we shouldhave

Co-sponsors of the event, which will
take place on Friday, November 4 at
8 pm, include the Black Cultural

The series hosts a collection of
speakers who have not traditionally

withissues and experiences specific
to the African diaspora tradition, but
pertinent to a cross section of
peoples," said Keelyn Bradley '95,

"If people know Nikki they're
going to be expecting her to be brutally honest," said Bradley. "She will
challenge students—all different
types of students—to rethink why
they are part of this institution."
In addition to the lecture, Giovanni
will share her poetry in a reading

"I am a grassroots organizer,"said
Sara Nichols, Congressional candidate in the 7th district, which includes Swarthmore, during an event
last night sponsored by the ProChoice Task Force, the College
Democrats, LBGA, and Earthlust.
Nichols addressed between thirty and
forty college students and a number
of older citizens and was accompanied by her campaign manager,
Swarthmore graduate MaraSenn '92.
The candidate began her talk with
an explanation of the origins of her
political ideology. She spoke of how
shelearned to valuereproductive freedom from her mother and adopted a
conservationist ethicfromherfather.
She went on to speak of her experiences as an advocateand legal expert
for the Clean Air Council and her
role as a volunteer at Planned Parenthood amongotherreproductive health
organizations. She has also served as
a Chester County Public Defender.
Nichols stated her interest in improving the future of the generation
because she is "terrifiedfor your generation." She emphasized the importance of a reworked health care system, work on criminal justice, and

improvement of public education.
When speaking of criminal justice, Nichols suggested that prevention was the answer. Her primary
strategy is to work for the reduction
of teenage pregnancy as 9of 10criminals currently in jail were born to
teenage mothers. As a part ofeducational reform, Nichols emphasized
the need "to put our money whcie

Take a Look at the Groups That Make Up CIVIC
By Emily Willits
Concern for socialaction is a tradition in the Swarthmore community.
The service activities which comprise Cooperative Involvement and
Volunteers in Communities (CIVIC),
Swarthmore's main student service
organization, illustrate this cause.
CIVIC helps to place and train
students in a variety of volunteer settings. Alix Mariko Webb '92, who
co-coordinates CIVIC with Carolyn
Stillwell *92, says CIVIC is, "the
institution umbrella group for service organizations. Our goal is to
provide opportunities, training, and
support for anybody and everybody
involved in community work." All
first-time CIVIC volunteers attend
introductory training sessions at the
beginning of the semester. Webb estimates thatthere are 250 S warthmore
volunteers involved in CIVIC organizations eachyear. The following is
an overview of the community service groupswhich are apart ofCIVIC.

Swarthmore students volunteer for
SHIP on a regular basis.
Chester Tutorial
Each Wednesday evening, twenty
children from six years old to high
school age participate in Chester
Tutorial, a weekly tutoring session

run by Swarthmore volunteers. Each
child is paired up with one of twenty
Swarthmore students who provide
them with homework help. The sessions are heldin Trotter eachWednesday night from 7:00 until 8:30 pm.
Vickie Karkazis '96 coordinates

CORE
Swarthmore students who volunteer for the Cancer Outreach Relief
Effort (CORE) work with youngleukemia patients in the Philadelphia
Children's Hospital. CORE volunteers participate in the hospital' s play/

prompted by last year's Phoenix strike, involvesacademic credit, not monetary compensation. Feldman said that "the students who
came to last year's open meeting on this issue
were very much against paying the Phoenix

MAGIC volunteers work with children at the Chester YWCA one or

ships. According to Hopkins, "We need to
decidehow to better support [them] with preparatory work and oversight during the internship
and then decide: should we give credit for
[them]?" The college would be more inclined
to fund the internships directly if the department were to give credit for them.
Finally, the fourth point raised was, "What
are the boundaries of public policy and how do
we relate to programs such as the Chester
project and the Democracy project? How can
we expand our domainand how is public policy
distinctive with its own academic characteristics?" Because Public Policy courses are embedded in supporting departments and are not
independent, the future of the concentration is
uncertain. Funding is the most pressing issue if
students are to continue to receive support for
their summer internships and if the program
itself is to continue.

her story as being "how an anorexic cradlerobber met the goddess."
Ramirez says that he plans to bring more
events like this to campus, which will "bring
psychological inquiry out of the building and
into the community." He expects the event to
be "stimulating in a 'fun' way. The performance takes some very serious subject matter
and approaches it with the help ofhumor. This
creates the possibility for reflection and dialogue," he says. .
The play is sponsored by Psychological Services, Health Service, Dean's Office, AWOL,

The Phoenix

October 28, 1994

By Laura Gitelson
The most recent news from the
Housing Committee regards the
policy of fining students for damage
that occurs in their residence halls.
This policy states thatthe total costof
damage in common spaces throughout a semester is divided equally
among all of the residents. Along
with protecting theCollege fromhaving to absorb these costs, this policy
is meant to instill a communal and
individual sense of responsibility for
whatever happens in the dorms.
The policy is flexible, however,
and allows for mitigating circumstances. Each incidentis evaluated to
determine whatmighthave happened
and who should assume responsibility for the damage. R.A.'s and residence councils are consulted in making these determinations. If someone
takes responsibility for the damage
or someone else observes a person
causing the damage, then the whole
dorm does not have to pay. In certain
cases itmay be determinedthatblame
for the damage can be placed on no
one—an act of nature, so to speak.
For example, at the beginning of
the semester one of the third-floor
stairwell windows in Hallowell mysteriously crashed to the ground below. College staff spoke to students
who live nearby, and did not see the
breakage, and determined that no one

was inside the part of the building
when the damage occurred. Since it
seemed likely mat something from
the outside had broken the window,
the cost of replacing the window will
not be paid by the residents.
When damage occurs, building
residents are to be notified by their
R. A. 's. If no one accepts responsibility, then the cost of the repair is to be
charged to thebuilding occupants. At
theend of each semester, R.A.'s will
tell residents how much they owe,
and collect payments. If a student
does not pay, the charge and additional administrative costs will be
added to his or her total college bill.
Currently two buildings havebeen
charged under this policy. In Mary

Lyons a laundry room door was damaged and in Willets two fire extinguishers were discharged.
The Director of Residential Life,
Myrt Westphal, also reported on the
fines levied on students for not occupying rooms selected in the spring
room lottery. Two students paid the
$5OO fine for selecting a room and
moving off campus while still enrolled. (These students left behind
roommates.) About half a dozen students were charged $846 (half the
room charge for the semester) for
notifying the Dean's office after August 1 that they were not going to
occupy their room. Whereas some of
these students moved off campus,
some had decided not to return for
fall semester. Some students decided
not to move off campus when they
learned about the fine.
Westphal noted thatafter August 1
itis very difficult to fill empty spaces
since most students have made alternative arrangements for housing by
that time. The 17 sophomores who
had no housing after last year's lottery were allplaced by July 15. While
the $5OO fine was new this year, the
$846 fine has been on the books for
three years. Because so few students
pay this fine, it is not widely known.
Copies of housing rules are posted
on the bulletin board outside the
Dean's office in Parrish. All are encouraged to become familiar with
them, and are invited to ask committee members any questions.

The Housing Committee is also
currently discussing include room restrictions, rules for jointtenancy, and
picking rooms by proxy. One correction of the previous housing article:
the name of James Solodar '97 was
inadvertently omitted from the listof
Housing Committee members.

Looking into the Abyss Beyond
For most of the senior class and
many juniors at Swarthmore, mid
to late fall can be the most crucial
and agonizing of times. As foliage
explodes like muted fireworks,
these poor souls must look into an
ersatz world and find meaning,
purpose, and, for the review of
Watson committees, Brown University, GoldmanSachs, and Mom
and Dad, an identity.
Looking into the inside pages of
a fellowship application can parallel a brush the Twilight Zone. Midway through a Truman Fellowship
application, for example, one finds
the question, "what position inpublic service do see yourself holding,
five to seven years after graduate
school?" I oftenhave troublelooking into the next week; asking my
brain to fathom myselfthirty something gives me a headache. Given
that the average human lives well
into their seventies, it seems less
than rational to assume that people

who have just turned twenty wiUhave
a coherent grasp of theirplans for the
next ten years.
In addition, so much of whatpeople
conventionally call anidentity can be
in flux during college: everything
from sexuality, to political beliefs, to
religious conviction, comes under
scrutination during school. What's
troubling about the image spinning
preparation forpost-graduation is that
itreinforces theperception that school
is the only time this questioning and
exploration can occur. It seems common myth that once we graduate, life
will begin a phase of three year semesters where nothing can be done
pass/fail, and activities cannot be
dropped. While I realize thatthetime
I spent here will foster many rainy
afternoon reveries later in life, I'd
like to think my life can be stimulating and rewarding in new ways. And
I'd also like to think that if I am not
enjoying whatI am doing, I have the
option to try something new.

autonomy on us, so it is reasonable

Caribbean-Sized Hole in Curriculum

Barbadian, and second, a West Indian. Here at Swarthmore, I simply
consider myself confused. You see,
most students here assume that I and
my fellow West Indians are African
or African-Americans. Few have
heard the term "West Indian;" fewer
still know what it means. Those who
dare hazard a guess define a West
Indian as "a person who comes from
the West of India." My definition is:
"the person who I am."

The Caribbean region is very near
the U.S., so American policies affect
it significantly. As times progress,
the old ties with Britain are being
replaced with ties to the U.S. Why
then does the Caribbean go unnoticed in the academic lifeof this College? Why do so few courses focus
on the Caribbean?
There are already few courses on
the Caribbean, but that number will
decline drastically at the end of this
year. Aisha Khan of the Sociology

The Truth about PA Parental Consent Laws

"Whackers of the World, Unite!"

By Josh Lifton

The United States of America is
known far and wide as having the
best military and special operations
in the world. Within our military and
special operations forces there exist
elite groups such as the Navy SEALs
andothercrack commando units, who
are the eliteof the elite, if you will. In
most corners of the world this would
suffice, but in America we demand
the best (take the '77 Ford Station
Wagon, for instance). Indeed, only in
acountry as great as the United States
could there exist an eliteof the eliteof
the elite. I love it.
The ultra-elite of which I speak
interact with us on a daily basis as we
innocently go about ourbusiness, unaware of their presence. The average
citizen knows this secret society only
as the Fire Fighters of Station 14, but
those among us who are intimatewith
thisheroic conglomerate refer to them
by their code name, The Whackers.
That's right, our nation's best are
Fire Fighters. On call 24 hours a day,
7 days a week, they are ready to go on
a moment's notice. However, only
new recruits go through a

after the

year of rigorous training (folding
hoses, attending lectures, and fetching coffee) are the firepants and beeper

which signify a

true

fire fighter be-

stowed upon them.

Maybe you've noticed them. A
whole group of people suddenly drop
their trays and sprint out of Sharpies.
They don't like the food? Nope,
they're Whackers. Classmates suddenly sprint out ofSnooze 101 as you
look on enviously. Did they finally
crack? Nope, they're Whackers. A
friend you are talking to runs away
madly. Do you have bad breath? Yep,
get some help.
This year one sophomore and four
first-years have joined the bandwagon.For their own protection, I'll
call them V, W, X, Y, and Z. Their
real names are Rachel, Alex, Sandy,
Rob, and Charlie. Rachel is from
Tennessee and has an accent, Alex is
from Canada and lives in ML, Sandy
lives in Willets basement and has
long black hair, Rob is tall and wears

glasses, and Charlie just looks funny.
When asked what thought first came
to mind when hearing the word
"fire," Charlie fell into a trance and
muttered the immortal phrase,
"Honker."
Meaningful by anyone's standard,
this mystical wordrefers to the pleasant air raid siren, the one which
periodically reminds us we are glad
to be alive as we regain our senses
from theshock it inspires in all of us
and climb back onto our bed/chair/
toilet. For most people, this is as
close as they will actually come to
the world of fire fighting. But a
select few, myself included, are
given the opportunity of having a
Whacker as a roommate.
And what an opportunity it is. I
simply can't imagine living without
the joy of being woken up at four in
the morning as my roommate slams
the door shut on his way to a call, or
learning just how a humat valve
operates, or being shown how to tie
a bowlin knot behind the back with
only the left hand. Would my life
ever be complete without these high
points? I think not. You should be
asking yourself the very same question. Canyou actually look yourself
in the mirror knowing you haven't
had the Whacker experience? That
is why, friends, I am offering to

lease
on
a monthly basis. Those interested
can reach me at jliftonl.
In order to save myself from being lynched,I better throw in a bit of
praise for the Whackers of Fire Station 14. This couldbe tough. Ummm,
they look really neat in their uniforms? Okay, okay, I'll say it—these
people deserve our respect, they are
the ones who will be there no matter
what to save our lives while risking
their own. We should all appreciate
their service to the community—not only for those instances in which
they are there for us, but also for all
the time and effort they put into
preparation for those hopefully rare
instances. Hats off to you, Whackers.
Besides, I feel I can go on living
now that I know how a humat valve

my roommate,

works.

Pennsylvania's Parental Consent
Law has a long history of being
distorted and confused. Unfortunately, Marybeth Lenkevich's article on "Mandatory Consent Laws
Restrict a Woman's Fundamental
Right to Choose" continues this
trend. Her article contained inaccuracies and critical omissions, which
prevent understanding the nature,
extent, and purpose of parental consent laws.
The parental consent law of PA
attempts to ensure that minors facing a pregnancy decision are making a decision thatis in keeping with
their best interests: "In deciding
whether to grant
such consent, a
pregnant
woman's parent

or guardian shall
consider only
their child's or
ward's best inter-

ests." Legal parents or guardians

from school authoritieswithout consent of an adult. The parental consent law does not deny young women
the possibility of having an abortion—it only requires them to make
the decisionwith the help of an older,
more mature person, usually a parent. Certainly young women should
be required to exercise more caution
when choosing whether to abort than
when piercing their ears!
The contradiction in Lenkevich's
argument is apparent. On one hand
we should respect the rights of girls
as young as 12-years old to make
decisions independently concerning
their pregnancy. But at the same
time we should also oppose legislation that requires these girls to at

difficult decision, overestimate how

person...shall be sufficient." As you
see, the law makes several provi-

sions for young

women who are
unwilling or unable to obtain parental consent.
Contrary to Lenkevich's statement, parental consent laws do not

directly discriminate against poor
women. In fact, there are no filing
fees associated with the court procedure of judicial by-pass as stated in
section Title 18 Section 3206 part
(hj) and, as stated in section (e), "the
court shall...upon her request, pro-

vide her with... counsel."
Parental consentlaws are designed
to protect young women because
they are minors and often are not
mature enough to make such critical
decisions alone. Socially, it is accepted that minors are not mature
enough to make certain decisions, or
act in some instances without supervision. Minorsunder 16cannotvote,
drive, smoke or consume alcohol,
but they are also not able to get their
ears pierced or receive medication

and then returns them to their violent

family situation withadded emotional
or physical burden. The more effective response in such a situationwould
be to provide the opportunity for these
young women to leave their domestic situation and receive the medical
and psychological help they deserve.
Under parental

abort also carries with it greater
emotional and physical risks which

she mustknow to make an informed
decision. According to the study
"Differential Impact of Abortion on
Adolescents and Adults" in the journal Adolescence (vol. 27, no. 105
Spring 1992), the adolescent and
adult reactions to abortion differed

dramatically. "Adolescents were sig-

nificantly more likely to be dissatisfied with the choice of abortion
than were the older subjects. [Ado-

lescents were more likely] to feel
forced by circumstances to have the
abortion, toreport being misinformed
at the time of abortion and to report
greater severity of psychological
stress." Increased physical complications are associated with adolescent abortion, because "adolescent
abortioncandidates differfrom their
physically mature counterparts"
since the cervix of a teenager is invariably tighter and likely to be damaged during the process of dilation.
Contrary to the statistic Lenkevich
quoted, 08-GYN News (vol 15,
no. 10 1980) reports that "The overall incidence of pregnancy complications among adolescents 16 years
and younger is similar to that reported for older women."

Picture this: it is last week, you're
home for fall break no wait, first I
want to give you a little background
here, so that you can fully understand
my shock in events of one morning
over fall break.
My parents used to be hippies.
They made beer in bath tubs, they did
drugs, my father avoided the draft,
and my mother told her parents that
she was dropping out of Stanford to
move to Hait-Ashbury to become a
prostitute. And yes, there are plenty
of embarrassing pictures of me naked
as a baby with these two very young,
long-haired people whom I can only
assume to be my parents.
But they've come a long way,
baby. My father puts on a suit and tie
every morning, gets into his littlered
car, and drives off to his white collar
upper-management job. My mother?
Well, every morning, she puts on a
suit which costs three times as much
as his and goes off to her job at the
helm of one of America's major magazines, where she makes three times
as much as he does.
That isn't to say that they've been
completely whitewashed. I didn't

ing and I have just dragged myself
into the kitchen for breakfast—well,
okay, I guess since it is 1:30 in the
afternoon it would be called lunch.
Anyway, I am in the kitchen making
myself breakfast and my mother
walks in. No big deal right? Life as
usual. Wrong.
My mother starts a perfectly normal conversation about school and
my friends. Then it happens. She
turns to me and asks, "I was just wondering, umm...do you think that you
could do something for me?"
And I, being the ideal child that I
am, reply dutifully, "Sure, what can I
do for you?"
Looking me straight in the eye as if
it were a perfectly innocent question,
asks, "Do you think you could buy me
some pot when you get back to
school?"
Excuse me? And she explains
something about how she can't really
do it herself because she can't get
caught, her job and all, you know.
Excuse me? She'd give me the
money and stuff and it wouldn't be a
big deal or anything.
Excuse me? Of course if I didn't
feel comfortable doing it she would
certainly understand and wouldn't
hold it against me.
Now I knew that my parents had
done drugs—it had become a family
legend. It doesn't even surprise me
that they've hit their 40's and want to
try to relive their youth. But they had
just failed to explain to me that the

A Drug Problem at Swarthmore?
By Julia Kernochan
College campuses, especially small
liberal arts schools like Swarthmore,
are often labeled as hotbeds of illegal
drug use. However, Swarthmore is
also a serious intellectual environ#ment, one where students are notoriously dedicated to their work. An
excess of drug use would seemingly
hinder thatdedication.To what extent
does the stereotype of drug use hold
true on this campus? In my opinion,
the level of illegal drug use on any
campus is relative. A perception of
its seriousness depends on a stud<

the first time. College becomes
the corrupting influence so often
feared by parents. But rarely is it the
case that first-year students are "typical" in their contact with illegal drugs
and alcohol. Most students are
exposed to these substances long
before their arrival at college.
Swarthmore students are no exception.
Despite parents' fears regarding the
college social scene, the damage may
have already been done. Many students, like myself, went to large public high schools in major cities. At
my high school, attended by nearly

evenings. Still others chose not to be
involved in these activities. Peer
pressure remains minimal, and the
accepting atmosphere of Swat students applies to drug use as well.
Yet even if alcohol and illegal subare not required for social
acceptance, they are readily available
and the use of them is far from
uncommon. Drinking is the focal
point of parties which occur at least
three nights a week, and illegal drug
use occurs on a regular basis. For
some first-year students, this

under the influence of ecstasy, and
this drug appeared at school-sponsored proms and grad nights as well.
Yet, despite the presence of illegal
drug activity, my high school was a
safe place, not some crime-ridden war
zone.
From this perspective, substance
use and abuse on the Swarthmore
campus seems rather innocuous.
Here, it seems, drug use is generally
limited to marijuana and hallucinogens such as mushrooms or LSD.

INHALE

Yet considering
my background, it is easy to
understand my perception of
Swarthmore as a haven of purity. Added to the dramatically
lowered intensity of drug use, a
vciy different attitude prevails. On
the whole, students here are responsible and intelligent in their choices
regarding illegal substances. And
while parents may fuss, the fact
remains that this campus is a relatively safe environment in which to
experiment.
Some new students may find the
transition from a sheltered high
school to college's permissive atmosphere a bit jarring. However there are
also those of us who see Swarthmore
as a calmer environment then the high
schools we went to and who welcome
the common sense that seems to prevail here.

Wes Craven's New Nightmare
Remember back in grade school when we all knew somebody who went as Freddy Kruger
Halloween? Well, those old striped sweaters and clawed gloves may be coming back this
All-Hallow's Eve. That's right, the newest installment, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, is out
in theaters now.
Here's the scoop: Freddy turns out to be an ancient beastie of evil that manifests itself in
stories. When a story becomes known by everyone or when it's forgotten, thisbeastie can stalk
and kill innocents. Well, the Nightmare series hasn't had an installment in several years (and
it's the tenth anniversary of the original) so the beastie can come out to play. It decides that it
likes Freddy's form and the late twentieth century so it attempts to enter our world. It stalks
Heather Lillenkamp, the woman who played Nancy in the first movie. She beat him then, so
she serves as the gatekeeper now. Freddy needs to enter our
world by the death of an innocent, so he goes after Heather's
young son, Dylan. Wes Craven plays himself as the crazed
writer who is having nightmares about this new Freddy.
Whatever he writes comes true.
Sound confusing?It is a little. But, it's still worth seeing if
you have two hours and $4.50 to blow. The acting sucks,
across the board. Wes Craven and thereal-life producers at
New Line Cinema prove why they normally stay behind the
camera. Even Robert Englund doesn't play himself very convincingly; he's much more
comfortable as Freddy. The only really cool thing to watch for is the spooky littlekid who plays
Dylan. He shows us why kids are so much scarier than adults in horror settings—because they
personify innocence, yet become truly terrifying when they 're evil or possessed. Check it out—

Good, Crude Fun at the Movies Katie Pulls A]l-Nsiter
Tired of trying to figure out the narrative complexities of Four Weddings and a Funeral? Looking for
something a little more, shall we say, light? Well, my
friend, you are in luck, because this weekend we've
got not one but two movies full of things blowing up,
things smashing into other things, and people killing
other people with tire irons—strictly no thinking

First up is Speed, which you may recall as "that
movie about a bus that goes really fast." And
that's about it In case you weren't paying
attention the first time it came out, here's
the recap. There's this bus. There's a bomb
on it. If the bus goes too slow, the bomb
blows up. So our hero's job is to make sure
the bus doesn't go too slow and blow up.
If the filmmakers had just left it at that,
Speed might have been a blissfully empty,
adrenaline-fueled masterpiece, but someone in Hollywood seems to be under the
impression that people go to action
movies for character development
(Not movies withKeanu Reeves they
don't.) So we end up with an incredibly sodden first third wasted on plot
set-up and the introduction of Jack's
partner (Jeff Daniels) —who, having
given the traditional "you've got to let up or this'll kill
you" speech, goes the way of all partners. Daniels
always has that teddy-bear look in his eyes, and he's
so dull and colorless you spend most of the picture
begging for him to get offed. Keanu, as always, brings
new meaning to the word "wooden", although this picture has the oddity of having a character that's actually written that way.
Stepping in to save the day is Sandra Bullock, who
plays a civilian with the dubious honor of having to
drive the bus once the driver is shot. She brings a

vivacity and intelligence to her scenes, filling up the
dead space around Keanu's head. Jan de Bont, like
most cinematographers-turned-director, zips the camera around a lot to no visible purpose, but he knows
how to keep the action moving, and in a movie like
this that's all you need. Dennis Hopper does his usual
thing as a crazed ex-cop, but he was better in those
Nike commercials.

The SwatWomen's Cross Country Amazons have conquered wind, dirt, and pain to
triumph in yet another race. This past Friday, the fearless Garnet harriers traveled to

picturesque Lehigh Valley to compete
in an open meet on the NCAA Division HI
course at Lehigh University. Despite the
high level of competition and the absence of
lead runner Alison Schirmer '97, the Swat
women prevailed, as usual. Shoshannah

We can now look past the dreary

I urge you now to indulge in the

The Tide begins to widen their
play, stretching the field lengthwise,
until they become a pillar of intensity and pride. They push the ball
towards that net that stands alone to
quench their savage thirst with the
waters of its cool spring. The team
is in a rhythm; they work the ball
back and forth to the wings, sliding
it through the middle of the field

the ball, knocking shot after shot at
the defenseless goal tender. Though
they cannot quite score, they know
that they are close, and the ball gains
momentum on their feet, as if all their
energy were building up inside that
ball, ready to be exploded in just one
final kick, one last surge.
Then the moment comes. The ball
floats forebodingly, almost in slow
motion towards the middle, where it
is met in a devastating collision by
the head of the oncoming striker. In
a flash of pure magnificence, the ball
rockets off his head and streams
through the back of the net As if in
a wave of jubilation, gratification,
and release, the entire team rushes up
the field after the goal scorer, meeting him in a second burst of energy
equal to the scoring of the goal.
With this image in mind, I urge
you to come to their final game on
Saturday against Haverford, as the
men's soccer team hopes to finish
this season with a bang.

Rachel McKaig, a senior tri-captain
on the Women's Volleyball team, has ended her
Swarthmore career with a powerful couple of
weeks. McKaig was named to Centennial Conference Honor Roll this past week because of
her 45 kills, 21 digs, and 14 aces in a week when
Swat went 2-2. She also led a high hitting week
the team which had a team high 36.8% over
Princeton.
Said a teammate of McKaig, "Shehas a great
deal of control while hitting and serving. She
has been key in recent victories over Albright,
Ursinus, Moravian, and Princeton." Added another teammate, "She's been a strong leader.
Her serves are very difficult to return and that
has pushed us forward recently."

the Football team. Hunt had a great game with
15 tackles last weekend in a loss to a nationally

Hunt made the Centennial Conference Honor
Roll. Middle-linebackeris one of the most physical positions and is the center of the defense.
Hunt is in charge of stopping the offensive run
while also preventing passes.
Said a teammate of Hunt, "He has a lot of
intensity and enthusiasm. He is the best middlelinebackerI've played with here." Another teammate added, "Jim is one of the mainreasons why
the defense has greatly improved this year."

Swat Women's Volleyball Ends Season With Success
Before the Women's Volleyball
season, Coach Larry Perry placed
much hope for success on the experi-

enced shouldersof co-captain Rachel
McKaig '95 and on the inexperienced
Jordan Hay '9B. Hay had a brilliant
season and provided consistency as
the team's sole setter. She ended the
year among the top five setters in
assists per game in both conference
and overall matches. McKaig led the
team to an 11 -6 record for the second
half of the season (Fall Break and
beyond) and was named to the conference Honor Roll twice, including
this past week. She turned what was
a mediocre season into a successful
one.

Swat finished 15-12, 4-6 in the
Centennial Conference, an improvement over last year's 15-14record. In
addition, they won the Cabrini Tournament and nearly beat Centennial
Conference champion and nationally
ranked Franklin and Marshall in a
tough five set marathon.
McKaig was named to this week's
Honor Rollafter racking up 45 kills,
14 aces, and 21 digs in the week's
matches. Her strong second half put
her among the conference's top ten
hitters in both kills per game, 2.81,
and hitting percentage, .271.
Swat finished its season on a roll
going 4-1 in its final week, defeating
Princeton's JV, 16-14, 15-13,
Moravian, 3-15, 15-12, 15-10, conference rival Ursinus, 15-2,2-15, 615, 15-10, 15-6, and Albright, 3-2.
Swat's only loss was in a five set
marathon against Johns Hopkins 1517,14-16, 15-4,15-4,15-10.
Swat played many of its tougher
matches early in the year when it
struggled with consistency. Yet,
weaker competition was not the explanation for Swat's improved secondhalf. "We were playing well as a
team and were able to recover and
win games in which we had made
some errors," explained Nancy
Rosenbaum '96.
What's been most surprising about
the team is itsoffense. Swat averaged
3.44 aces per game, 268 overall, the
highest average for any conference
team. This in an incredible statistic
because for a match that goes to four
games, Swat would win 14 "free"
points off aces. Yvonne Lui '95 led
the entire conference in overall aces
per game averaging 0.95 and a total
of 72. The team also led the conference in hitting percentage at .247.
How could they lose a match with
such on offense?
As usual, statistics do not tell the
whole story. Hitting percentage loses
some of its importance if the passes
do notreach the hitters, andSwat was
often inconsistent in its passing. In
addition, one of the drawbacks of
serving for aces is often an increase
in missed serves.
Nevertheless, at one point in the
season, Swat was ranked in the top 20
of the nation in each statistic. This is
a remarkable accomplishment for a
team whose serving was less than
dominant last year. Coach Perry

stressed serving frompre-season on
and allocated a lot of practice time to
its improvement.
With the graduation of four of the
team's top five hitters, Swat will be
hard pressed to match this year's conference-leading hitting percentage.
As McKaig, Lui, Mary Beiler '95,
and Chi Yun '95 move on, only
Rosenbaum remains of the experienced hitters. DianaBieber '96 made

an impressive transition from setter
to hitter this season and will have a
major impact next year. However,
next season Swat will need a new

middle hitter, formerly Lui, and weakside hitter, formerly Yun. Lisl
Cochran-Bond '97 saw duty as a
middle hitterthis year but she will be
studying abroad in the fall of 1995.
Laura Pitman '96 will anchor the
back line.

Consistent setting is the most important skill for a team that's trying to

develop its hitting skills. With Hay
firmly in the setting position for the
next three years, the developing players will have one less thing to worry
about.

Although the seniors' abilities will
be sorely missed, their spirit and fierce
intensity will be most missed. "They
had a lot to do with the social aspect

of the team... they've always been so
close and have had a lot to do with
defining the team," said Rosenbaum.
CORRECTION: Chi Yun '95 was
inadvertently omitted from the list of
six seniorswho are graduating in last
week's article. The six seniors are
Yun, Mary Beiler, Nicki Levine,
Rachel McKaig, Suzannaßrauer, and
Yvonne Lui. The author apologizes
for the oversight.
