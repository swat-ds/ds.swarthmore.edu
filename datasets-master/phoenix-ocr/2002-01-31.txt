the feasibility of discounted transportation to Philadelphia and compiling a course evaluation booklet are both on the list of long-term initiatives Student Council intends to address this semester.

�

Headed by a duo of new leaders, the council met
Monday night at a new location: the Campus Resource
Center, or CRC, up one floor from the former Parrish
Parlours meeting spot.
"We're starting off new," Student Council CoPresident Liane Rice 'O3 said. Co-President Matt Rubin
'O3 said the new council members appeared to be a very
energetic group and one that he thought could look forward to "taking a stance and working in a more substantive manner" than previous councils.
Rice said that one of her personal goals in spearheading this year's council was to set up a structure
that would prevent projects from dying when the
council membership changes, as has often happened
in the past.

"I think people who say council

She hoped this semester's group would "give
Student Council a vision for where it's going" and set a
precedent for dealing with continuing issues. These

issues might be irresolvable for one council in the

administrations over several semesters or years, SC

may eventually produce enduring change.

When seniors graduate in May, they can expect a job
market as much as 13 percent smaller than last year,
according to a recent report from Michigan State
University. Because of the shrinking number of jobs
available to recent undergraduates, more students
across the country are applying to graduate and professional schools in order to delay their entry into the working world and gain training and experience in the meantime.
Yet during downturns in the economy, students with
liberal arts degrees may have the advantage in landing a
job.

As a result of the increased interest in graduate
degrees, applications to universities have gone through
the roof. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on Monday
that applications to Drexel's health sciences program had
risen 28 percent in the last year, and the University of
Pennsylvania's law school had seen 40 percent more applications.

Wharton business school at the University ,of
Pennsylvania "is experiencing an increase in number and
quality of applications to the MBA program this year, as

are many other business schools," Rosemaria Martinelli,
the director of admissions, wrote in an e-mail.
Similar trends are showing up across the country. The
New York Times reported on Jan. 24 that applications had
risen 57 percent to the Yale law school, 80 percent to the
Emory business school, and 100 percent to the University
of Chicago business school.
"Oftentimes, when the economy slows down, applications to graduate programs rise," Martinelli said.
This fact has led some Swarthmore students to re-think

their plans following graduation.
"I was planning on not going to graduate school, but
now it's changed," Carolynn Laurenza 'O3 said. "I'm actually considering it now."

Jon Bartner 'O2, who hopes to become a professional in
the business world, said the weakened economy had
caused him to reconsider entering the workforce, but in
the end wasn't enough to change his mind. "The slow job
market has made me look at a lot of different options," he
said, "but ultimately, I decided that I want to work for a
few years before I go to graduate school."
Tom Francis, director of Career Services, said that he
hadn't noticed any strong trends toward graduate school,
and he attributed this to the atmosphere of Swarthmore.

Council secretary resigns
BY KRISNA DUONG-LY
kduongll@swarthmore.edu

Half an hour before .the first meeting of the new student council last
Saturday morning, recently elected
Student Council Secretary Liz
Singreen 'O4 resigned from her
position.
"I felt like my presence wasn't
really wanted or needed there and
that my time could be spent on other
activities," Singreen said.
"She was both wanted and need-

ed," council co-president Matt Rubin
'O3 said, "wanted in the sense that
we valued her as a member at large,
and needed insofar as she had official duties which council is now
overseeing. I am surprised that she
felt that way, since the new council

January 31, 2002

had not yet begun its business.
Council values each student's, elected or otherwise, input, just as it does
Liz's."
Singreen said she wanted to pursue service to the college through
alternate routes. "Anyone could be
secretary," she said. "I would still
like to accomplish all the things on
my platform but not as a regular
member of Student Council. I didn't
think that SC would be the best plan
for me."
In her platform last fall, Singreen
cited her experience with several
campus organizations, including
Earthlust, Empty the Shelters, the
Ultimate Frisbee team and Rotaract.
The secretary-elect stated that as a
member of the council she had
planned to represent these groups, as

well as support the purchase of wind
power for some campus buildings.
She also said that aside from performing her duties as secretary, her
primary goal was to be open to the
viewpoints of the students.
A special election will be held
Feb. 12 to 14 in Sharpies to fill the
position. Interested candidates must
declare their intent to run by Feb. 5.
The secretary's official duties
include recording and posting all
minutes of the meetings, archiving

important documentation concerning the council and serving as treas-

urer.

Medical transportation woes not likely to be solved

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

College does not provide adequate transportation to off-campus medical services, students report
BY REIKO TESHIBA

rteshibl@swarthmore.edu

Inadequate campus transportation that sometimes
leaves sick or injured students unable to get to medical
appointments or stranded at the Crozer-Chester Medical
Center, six miles away, has been sensed on campus for

years.
The college does not provide transportation between
the campus and medical centers. If students are in lifethreatening emergencies, Worth Health Center calls an
ambulance, which can cost as much as $7OO.
Sometimes Public Safety provides transportation to
students who cannot take either the public buses or a
SEPTA train. However, this is a viable option only if
another officer is around to stay on campus. If Public
Safety is unavailable, students have to come up with
alternative transportation, which means asking acquaintances who have cars for a ride or using public transportation. Especially for underclassmen, this often poses

a daunting problem.

The parking permit factor
According to Linda Echols, director of Worth Health
Center, about 100 incidences of sickness and injuries
requiring off-campus medical care occur during the academic year. This number includes routine check-up visits
to doctors for which transportation is the students'
responsibility.
Terri Narkin, administrative assistant for Public
Safety, said students are asked to transport students for
doctor's appointments and medical tests in the parking
permit application, but only if they are available during
certain times of the day.
There is a clause in the current parking permit application that requires students with parking permits to
make two medical transports for Worth Health Center, for
which students are compensated $5 per trip. If they do not
meet this requirement, the permit can be revoked.
However, students are not asked to drive ill or injured
students because of liability issues.

But there is little evidence that students are aware of
this rule. Echols pointed out that Worth often does not
know who has cars on campus. There have been times

"There's no other way for the
freshmen to get to the hospital. I'd
say it's a substantial problem."

when Echols has lent her car to students so they could get
to the hospital. But driving students back and forth is not
a part of the staffs job description and can leave the
health center understaffed.
Echols has been pushing for a better campus transportation system since 1998. She feels the lack of transportation between the campus and hospitals is part of a
bigger problem of campus transportation.
"We need a system, not a stab at measures," Echols
said. One of her solutions to the transportation problem
is to hire retirees as part-time drivers who could use their
own cars. She estimated the cost of the position at around

ing them from leaving campus. According to Owen
Redgrave, director of Public Safety, the rotation of officers is complicated. Since it is a round-the-clock cycle,
the system usually means one officer is on duty on the
first shift, two are on duty on the second and two on the
third. Most of the time, there are two vehicles that are up
and running.
"We try to make a decision based on what's best for
the campus," Redgrave said. If a medical situation occurs,
the Public Safety supervisors judge what is going on [on]
campus and what resources are available.
Redgrave said Public Safety has become more serviceand have
oriented in the last few years. They will
transported injured students from their dorms to classes
and Sharpies. When it comes to leaving the campus,
Public Safety will try to help, but its number one priority

is to protect the community.
Redgrave said Public Safety is not a free taxi service
for every student going to a doctor's appointment. He
believes this to be out of the scope of Public Safety's
responsibilities.

'lt's not an uncommon situation'
Last semester, Anna Stratton 'O4 fractured two ribs
when she fell off a ladder. Public Safety rushed her to
Crozer-Chester Medical Center. After getting X-rayed and
examined, she was discharged at 11 a.m. the next day.
Stratton called Worth and Public Safety numerous times
to see if anyone could pick her up, but she waited for four
hours, frustrated in an unpleasant hospital room until
Public Safety came. Stratton finally returned to campus

cited financial reasons for not being able to implement
the kind of driver system that Echols proposes. Of a $7B
million annual budget, most of which disappears in the
form of faculty and staff salaries, physical plant costs and
supplies, only a few hundred thousand dollars are left for
new projects and services.
"Adding a driver is something that is competing with
everyone else's wish list," Gross said.
The blame for inadequate transportation often falls
upon Public Safety, but there are many logistics prevent-

at 4 p.m.
"Knowing that someone's there to pick you up takes
the whole weight off your shoulders," said Stratton. As an
Ultimate Frisbee player, she's also had her share of sports
injuries, which frequently require treatment at the
Springfield Diagnostic Center on Route 320. Getting to the
diagnostic sometimes proves difficult for Stratton.
"It's not an uncommon situation," she said. "I definitely think there should be a full-time service."
Lauren Appel 'O4, one of Stratton's roommates, also
had difficulty getting to orthopedic appointments in Bala
Cynwyd. It was too inconvenient to use public transportation, and she was not made aware that Public Safety
might be able to locate students with cars who could
drive her to her appointments. In the end, Appel borrowed a car from an acquaintance so she could get to her

"It's an imperfect system," Dean of the College Bob
Gross '62 said. "But it's not a frequent enough problem
that it's risen to the top of the list."
He said most students manage to work it out somehow
so that those with parking permits are able to drive
injured students when it is convenient for them. Gross

appointments herself.
Similarly, Marie Becker 'O4 had problems getting to
appointments for a chronic pain condition in her freshman year. Worth gave her a list of students with cars to
call. One time, Becker had arranged for a ride, but ten
minutes before they were supposed to leave, the driver
backed out. She was forced to canel her appointment.
"I think Worth should have more information about
public transportation," Becker said. "It's important to
keep that in mind when referring students to places."
Emily Zackin 'O2, an RA in Mertz, has had to shuttle
her hallmates, especially first-years, back and forth
between the college and the hospital five times in the past
semester.
"There's no other way for the freshmen to get to the
hospital," Zackin said. "I'd say it's a substantial
problem."
On the other hand, the current policy has been successful in some cases. In her freshman year, Suma Balu
'O2 tipped her chair and fell hard on her roommate's plastic storage cases. She was transported to Crozer-Chester
Medical Center by an ambulance, but Public Safety
brought her back to campus without having to wait very
long.
Similarly, Claire Phillips-Thoryn 'O2 accompanied a
student to Crozer-Chester Medical Center last semester.
"Public Safety was totally willing to drive us," she said.
What can be done?
The chance of Swarthmore developing a transportation system to bring students from campus to hospitals
seems slim given financial constraints. Injured or sick
students are left to get by as they always have
relying
on other students with cars if they are available, or public transportation for those who are more mobile.
But one thing that can help make the current system
run smoother would be better communication between
Worth and students with parking permits who are expect-

ed to make medical runs.
"The rule that students with parking permits are supposed to drive should be enforced," Kathryn Jantz 'O5
said.
Jantz was referred to one doctor after another until
she found one who could perform the shoulder surgery

she needed.
"Worth should have a list of people and what blocks of
time during the week that they can drive," she said.

EPA: Four area watersheds among worst
Local creeks four of dirtiest in nation;
Crum watershed is cleaner, study says
BY MATTHEW FITTING

mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

Though the Crum Creek watershed
fiat supplies the college and surrounding
area was not among them, four of the
Philadelphia region's 12 watersheds are
among the most polluted in the country,
to a recent study by the

according

Environmental Protection Agency.
The Crum watershed received a rating
of four on a scale of one to six, with six
being the worst. Of the 2,200 watersheds
in America, only 28 received a score of
six, including four in the Greater
Philadelphia area. Most watersheds
received a score of either three or four.

"I don't take anything in
that study to show
everyone should go out
and buy a Brita filter."
Arthur McGarity

i

[

But engineering professor Arthur
McGarity said the findings shouldn't
cause a wave of panic over drinking water
safety. "I don't take anything in that study
«to show everyone should go and buy a
\>ita filter," said McGarity, who has studied the Crum Creek since the early 1990s
with his students. "The watersheds in this
region are stressed, though, and being
more stressed because of urban sprawl."
Besides possible contamination of

drinking water, the study raises other
concerns. It costs more to treat contaminated water to make it safe for drinking,
and animals who live in the water could
become sick or die from the contamination. Also, people who eat the fish from
the water, along with those who go swimming or boating in it, run a higher risk.
McGarity described the study as "very
coarse" and not as exact as many environmentalists desire because it was run by
the EPA, a national government agency.
"One area was in one color that denoted a very low quality while it was just one
or two hotspots" in that area that were
very contaminated, he said.
Then again, "there are hotspots on our
watershed that [are] worse than indicated." In other words, though the Crum
watershed scored a four overall, some
smaller areas in the creek might rate a
five or six.

Storm water runoff is the main culprit
of contamination, according to McGarity.
"Most people probably don't realize we
use our pure water streams as storm
sewers," he said.
"Another threat to our system is the
sanitary sewer system, which often overflows and allows unsafe pollutants to get
into the streams," he added, also faulting
urban sprawl with lowering the quality.
Olga Rostapshova 'O2, a member of
Earthlust who has done various work
with the Crum Creek Monitoring Project,
said the main problem is that the contamination doesn't start at just one source.
"The problem is that it comes from a million different sources, and there's no way
to control all of them," she said. "It is a

very small waterway, so we are subject to
what comes to us downstream."
The college tries to limit its contribution to the contamination as much as possible, Director of Facilities Management
Stuart Hain said. "We try real hard to

limit the amount of salt in the water during snow," which is a major contributor to

contamination.
But, he said, "whatever gets picked up
from the storm runoff is what goes into
the water."

Conference to focus on accomplishments of Jane Addams
BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Scholars will come to Swarthmore this weekend to participate in a conference focusing on the life and achievements of one of America's most prominent social activists.
Jane Addams was a woman at the forefront on the progressive movement at the turn of the twentieth century,

famous

for her work with the concerns of immigrants,
urban residents, and women and for her advocacy of peace.
Swarthmore awarded Addams an honorary degree in
the 1932, and the college's library houses a substantial collection of Addams documents. This weekend's conference,
entitled "Rediscovering Jane Addams," will take place in
Lang Music Hall Friday and in the Scheuer Room Saturday.
The conference is free and open to the public. It will
begin on Friday at 7:30 p.m. with a keynote address by
Jean Bethke Elshtain, a renowned author and political
philosopher. The conference will continue Saturday from 9
a.m to 4:30 p.m., with four different sessions. Each session
will feature aspects of present studies on Addams and the
impact her life has on domestic and international policies
today.

Political science professor Carol Nackenoff, one of
organizers of this event, will be speaking at the conference.
She explained that the topic of the conference is a popular

one, as there has recently been a great deal of new research

done on Addams.
Nackenoff feels that Addams's message could have a
positive effect in today's society, just as it did
in Addams'
n,
vn time. "I think Jane Addams' ideas had great potential
w transform the way Americans thought about their inter-

dependence and their interrelationships, and their obligations. She was a critic of individualism, and she encour-

aged a vision of a state that cared about social welfare,"

Nackenoff said.
It is her hope that these visions will be preserved and
given greater emphasis. "Jane Addams demands a place in
the first rank of American political thinkers," she said. "I
hope that those who attend will consider the force of her
vision for America."
Nackenoffalso explained that Swarthmore was an excellent location for this conference, since it is a repository of
Addams's papers, found in the Peace Collection housed in
McCabe.
Peace Collection Curator Wendy Chmielewski, another
conference organizer, explained that the collection began
with a selection of Addams's papers and a variety of documents from the Women's International League for Peace
and Freedom. Addams was the first president of the league
and she was happy to have a place for their documents as
well as her own writings. Chmielewski said the collection
January 31, 2002

now includes much of Addams's personal and professional
writing, correspondence, manuscripts, articles, biographical material, family papers, photographs, films and even
the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 193
L
Chmielewski will show a film of the honorary degree
ceremony at the conference. Additionally, she will speak
about the many resources available on Addams's life and
accomplishments.

Chmielewski believes Addams' ideas have a place in
today's society. She explained that "was very well aware of
people as individuals and as groups. She was also well
aware there is often conflict between groups. I think that
one of her aims was to help the world achieve resolution of
conflict in other ways than war."
She also noted that "the conference itself is a unique
opportunity to hear some scholars that you would not be
able to hear otherwise. Any number of them are nationally
known."
One of these renowned scholars is Kathryn Sklar, a professor of history at the State University of New York at
Binghamton. Sklar is excited about the possible benefits of
the conference. "Jane Addams was the single most important agent of change in peace movements and international movements," Sklar said. "There is a resurgence of scholarship on Jane Addams in the United States that this conference is going to draw together."
According to Sklar, there is much argument over
Addams's views, and there should be some interesting
debate at the conference. With all of these scholars finding
this kind of meaning in Addams, Sklar feels that the conference is a place where they can communicate their own
beliefs about her importance to today's society.

Seniors weigh options after graduation
From RECESSION, pg. 3
"It doesn't feel dramatically different,"
he said. "What somebody might write
about in The New York Times applies less
to Swarthmore. We tend to focus more on
the individual, and less on external fac-

tors."

Francis doesn't see much connection
between the Swarthmore graduate applicants and the economy. "Swarthmore
doesn't correlate with economic cycles,"
he said.
According to the report from Michigan
State, done by the Collegiate Employment
Research Institute, there might be a good
reason for this: liberal arts students have
less to worry about.
"For those companies who expressed
an interest in liberal arts and science
majors, hiring levels will be higher this
year than last," the report stated. "The
biggest losers in the market are engineers, computer science [majors], and
business graduates. These groups will
still have opportunities, but they should
not expect the multiple offers of previous

years."

Francis pointed out that attendance at
the Law School Aptitude Test, or LSAT,
this year was "in line with previous
years." In contrast, the Law School
Admission Council, which conducts the
test, said on their Web site that in the

"December 2001 administrations of the

LSAT saw the largest increase in over a
decade." There was a twenty six percent

increase over the previous December,

Despite terrorist threat, no added security
for Punxsutawney Phil on Groundhog Day
BY MIKE WALBERT

DAILY COLLEGIAN

As eager
Americans glance toward Feb. 2, awaiting the news of
seasonal change from the most adored rodent forecaster

in history, an anxious question arises
Punxsutawney Phil the target of terrorists?
"The probability of there being an attack is very
remote," said Stuart Bremer, professor of political science at Pennsylvania State University.
Bremer believes the Statue of Liberty and other historically rich monuments to be at a greater risk than
Phil and the accompanying festivities of Groundhog Day.
"As beloved as he might be, it wouldn't be a strike at
the heart of America," Bremer added.
Pennsylvania State Trooper Jamie LeVier, head of
security for the yearly event that takes place atop
Gobbler's Knob, feels the fuss over increased security for

Phil has been misplaced.
"A lot of stuff has been blown out of proportion by the

6

media," LeVier said. "We're not increasing security
because of what happened on Sept. 1L"
LeVier explained that the increase in security for the
festivity is merely in response to the gradual yearly
growth of the influx of people attending the spectacle as

LeVier emphasized the focus of the patrollers would
heavily concentrate on the detection of alcoholic beverages
on Gobbler's Knob, the headquarters for the celebration.

Any items deemed illegal by security will be immediately confiscated, LeVier said. "Our number one priority
is to ensure everyone's safety."
Due to the firm security measures, LeVier expects to
encounter very few problems from the crowd. "It's hard
to project any problems. It's been real good the last few
years," LeVier said.
State College Police Sgt. John Wilson was unsure as to
how he would handle the task of providing security for
Groundhog Day attendees if placed in that position, but
made it clear he agrees with LeVier's precautions.

'Independent' Philly paper
Group hopes to create 'new kind of civic culture'
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu

Matt Schwartz 'Ol believes Philadelphia sufk fers. To ease what he considers a lack of journalistic coverage of the everyday occurrences of
Vhe city and the vastness of its history, he and
three other Swarthmore graduates have started
a new monthly newspaper, The Philadelphia
Independent.

Schwartz, Benjamin Tiven 'Ol, Mark Lotto 'OO
and Jonathan Shainin 'OO are the creative forces
behind The Independent. Their goal, Schwartz
said, is to "create a new kind of civic culture

British and early American newspapers, the editors said. The main goal of the paper is accessibility to all Philadelphians, not a targeted audience of readers.
"Newspapers, as a rule, presume to be leading authorities: here's what's happening, here's
what's true, here's what's false. Their job is to
know better," Lotto said. "We try to take the
opposite approach: we don't know anything, but
we're curious about everything."
The first issue of The Independent hit newsstands two weeks ago after four months of planning. Schwartz explained the history of the
paper. After graduating in May, he went to work
for The Indianapolis Star through the Pulliam
Fellowship, but he was not happy there.

Equal access
should be a

top priority

It's easy to forget those endless flights of stairs
when all there is to complain about is how winded
you get when you run them.
But for students with disabilities or temporary
injuries, consistently running into difficulties getting around on this campus has become a way of
life for too long. It hit home here atop Parrish this
year, when two of our staffers struggled to stay

productive, bravely crawling up and down five
flights of stairs in an effort to maintain the active
campus lives they had known before becoming less
mobile. In fact, our friends' problems highlighted
for us the fact that a student confined to a wheelchair would probably not be able to sustain a long
amount of time being on our staff or D Jing for

WSRN.

And besides on-campus access issues, many students have considerable trouble getting to medical
appointments outside the college (see story, page

4).

A committee of faculty, students and staff put
together to review disabilities services and physical accessibility is in the works for this semester
since Student Council took the matter up last
November. It is our hope that this will remain a
top priority for this ambitious council this spring.
The college can't afford to limp along with small
improvements here and there
this committee
should take a good hard look at what the college is
capable of, and what standards of accessibility and
services it wants to provide. Of course, providing
things like handicapped access bathrooms or
transportation for injured students is expensive.
"Everyone has a wish list," as Dean of the College

„

Bob Gross '62 said in an interview this week (see
page 4). But ensuring equality of physical access is
just more important than, say, nicer signs direct-

ing visitors around campus.
For example, we as a community treat equality
of access to technology with a great deal of importance. Everyone should be able to have a computer
to use if they weren't able to bring one to college
it's imperative to have easy access to e-mail and
word processing to survive at Swarthmore. The
importance of this is obvious for everyone here to
grasp: we all have to use computers every day. But
unlike technology trouble, most of us do not have
to struggle daily with things as simple as just getting to class or taking a shower.
And if students who are temporarily immobile
are finding it impossible to do much more than get
to class and McCabe, imagine, for a moment what
it would be like to attend Swarthmore wheelchairbound. In fact, imagine taking a tour of the campus as a prospective student in a wheelchair
you might not even be able to accompany your
guide to see what is usually the highlight of the
tour, the "typcial student room."

Student survey results misrepresented
Dear Editor:
I was very pleased that The Phoenix reported on the
results of last spring's College Student Experiences
Questionnaire. Unfortunately, a few of the findings reported in the "Survey Says ..." box were misleading, and I
would like to clarify the results.
The percentages of students who responded with exactly a six on the seven-point scale in rating a number of college offices were reported. (The highest score, a seven, was
anchored with the adjectives "approachable, helpful,
understanding, encouraging, respectful.") The problem is
that just a "6" rating by itself doesn't tell you much. For
example, if 10 percent responded with a six, anywhere
between zero percent and 90 percent might have responded with a seven, the highest rating. So the 10 percent by

itself tells you little about whether or not students
responded favorably.
A more meaningful way to characterize the ratings
would have been to report either the proportion responding with the highest score, a "7" or with a "6 OR a 7." More
importantly, the percentages reported were based on all
students, including those who indicated that they were
not able to rate the office. Therefore, the article gave the
impression that few students rated the Public Safety or
financial aid offices very highly, when in fact over a third
of the students who rated the Public Safety office and
nearly half of those who rated the financial aid office gave
them the highest possible ratings (a 6 or 7).

Dash for Cash a harmless, much-needed rugby fundraiser
Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to Professor J. William
Frost's uninformed criticism of a tradition that spans
decades of Swarthmore history. The Dash For Cash is
one of the primary sources of funding for teams that
receive no financial support from the athletic department. We buy much of our own equipment and travel to
away matches in our own vehicles. Costs are inevitably
incurred that cannot be satisfied by our limited budget
as a campus organization.
Frost claims that he learned only two weeks ago that
the rugby teams' streaking through Parrish is for profit.
I find it hard to believe that a man as educated as Frost
was unable to infer that the Dash for CASH is for profit.
Each year we receive money willingly from students,
staff and a number of faculty.
There is no "subtle group coercion of incoming members of the two teams to run," as Frost suggests. From a
roster of well over twenty male ruggers, only five participated in last semester's Dash. Some of the others
attended as spectators, and others chose not to attend at
all. The choice was left entirely to individual members.
We who choose to run do not feel uncomfortable with
our actions. Contrary to what Frost may believe, participants in the Dash have not covered their heads with
paper sacks in many years. Even when it was an option,
few ruggers actually chose to conceal their identities.

And as for Frost's inquiry about whether we would
streak without a monetary reward, I suggest that he pay
a little more attention to campus happenings, for the tradition of rugby streaking far exceeds the Dash For Cash.
Why aren't religious groups, administration and faculty picketing or boycotting the Dash? Perhaps because
many of them are too busy watching it. In fact, rugby is
one of the most diverse and least exclusive groups on
campus, enjoying the company of players of multiple
races, ethnicities, religions and sexual orientations.
Frost believes that the college allows the Dash
because it causes no physical harm to others. Does he

imply that it causes some other, perhaps psychological,
form of harm? The event is well advertised, and those
who do not wish to view thirty seconds of nudity are
able to avoid Parrish for that period of time.
In closing, Frost asks if we have no shame. If he is
asking if we have no shame in our nudity, then the
answer is no. No one who streaks is ashamed of his or
her actions. On the contrary, we are proud of our bodies
and have no qualms about exhibiting them. If you would
like us to do as you suggest and streak in an outdoor
location in the winter without advertising or raising
money, please let us know your home address and we'd
be more than happy to oblige.

Dash fosters confidence, pride for female ruggers
Dear Editor:
As members of the women's rugby team we would
like to respond to Professor J. William Frost's letter,
"Dash for Cash fuels sexual exploitation."
As women, we were offended by Frost's attack on
our team and the morality of each player. Likening the
Dash for Cash to a "wet t-shirt contest" suggests that
the women, in particular, are the ones who are volunteering their bodies for exploitation. Frost makes this
comparison oblivious to its sexist undertones.
We also challenge his assumption that the nudity
displayed in the Dash must be equated with sexual
obscenity. Anyone who has participated in or observed
this event would not describe the chaotic sprint
through Parrish as erotic. The Dash is recognized for
its fun absurdity and unique tradition.
Players are not made to feel less a part of the team
if they do not run. For those who do, the experience is
positive and liberating. The physical nature of rugby

requires players of many different body types, and it
encourages women to use their bodies in ways not commonly deemed appropriate. Rugby gives us pride in
our bodies. The Dash is not an objectification of our
bodies but rather an extension of this pride. It is also
one of the many fundraising activities that we organize
in order to maintain an active club sport.
Frost depicts the Dash for Cash as "soft porn" and
"bad taste." We would expect a less judgmental and
more thoughtful analysis from a scholar of religion.
Lastly, in an atmosphere as intense and consuming as
Swarthmore, a little harmless fun can be refreshing.
Does it merit such severe scrutiny?

productive impulses
I made $3BO over winterbreak. I never had to work a minute,
and I won't ever have to pay any taxes. I made my money by
gambling and becoming the resident pool shark in my basement. Although we have had a table for a few years, my family
has never really been big on billiards. Then my brother and I
started betting, the stakes went up, and we started to play pool
nonstop. A few days after finishing the last of my end-of-thesemester papers from home, I
was goofing around with my
younger brothers in the basement. On a whim, I asked my
brother Michael, a sophomore in
college, if he wanted to play a
game of eight ball with 20 bucks
on the line. Unable to turn down
a challenge, he accepted.
We played a bunch of games
that night. He'd win one, go up
twenty, then I'd win two and go

up twenty. Up twenty, down
twenty. Back and forth, back and
forth. That's the way it stayed for
the first few nights. We'd shoot
FRANK MARTINEZ
pool for at least one hour and
usually two, playing each other
Street
evenly until we went to bed.
But the cream always rises to
the top. I pulled away from
Michael, game by game, twenty bucks at a time. I remember the
first time I went up 100 dollars, a huge milestone that took me
days to reach. Through my smarter and more consistent play, I
slowly increased my lead. With each additional twenty dollars
that Michael owed me, his insistence that he was truly the better player intensified, as did the scowl on his face. At times,

The pool tables in Tarble should be
the campus hot spot, and you should
have to wait to get a table. Isn't that
what college is all about?
Michael was so angry that it wasn't even fun anymore. He had
become addicted to gambling, and all he wanted to do was to bet
some more to get back to even. But his debt just increased.
I was having a great time, though. With my triple-digit cushion, I was playing with the house's money, and the low stress
level allowed my game to be natural and smooth. All of my wins
gave me the opportunity to develop a victory dance that
involved a winning shot on the eight ball through my legs, followed by a period of "riding the horse" that took me all the way
around the table while straddling the cue stick. The dance finished by yelling "blackjack"
the name of my stick
in his
face. Until Michael went back to school in January, this was
what I did. My break was built more upon taking pleasure in
mundane things like pool than on doing something really exciting. I think it was exactly that absence of urgency in what I was
doing that made my time at home enjoyable.
I'm no workaholic, but, like many Swarthmore students, I
carry in the back of my mind a need to be productive. We could
benefit from forgetting about that every once in a while. The
pool tables in Tarble should be the campus hot spot, and you
should have to wait to get a table. Isn't that what college is all
about? Sitting back, chewing the fat, shooting some pool or dealing some cards. We need more poker nights. More hall dartboards. Let's show everyone that we really are smart and get
some chess going. Connect Four can be a blast, whether you
have a Sam Adams in your hand or a Dr. Pepper.
We could even start gambling to make it interesting, though
as Michael would warn you, debt can be very frustrating. He
hasn't paid me yet, and I might be merciful and let it slide. The
money I'll never see didn't make it fun. It was the informal and
ultimately meaningless competition that was oddly fulfilling.
I brought my stick back with me, and I am eager to start
patrolling Tarble looking for victims. I noticed that there
already is a group of about ten people who play pool regularly. I
hope to become one of them soon.

The era of big government is back!
Well, sorta. This year President Bush is asking Congress
for the largest proportional increase in the federal budget
about 10 percent
in decades. But most of it, $4B billion, is
new defense spending. After all, $3OO billion a year just isn't
enough to blow up Somalia, the Philippines, Iraq and what's
left of Afghanistan (a.k.a. the "Evil Ones").
Bush says he also wants an economic stimulus bill (read:
another tax cut), but it kind of seems like pumping a hundred
billion dollars directly into the economy will be something of
a stimulus all on its own. Plus, by the time more tax cuts take
effect, the economy will probably be back on track already

nobody on the other side of the

and the Democrats are the deficit hawks.
The problem is that the "fiscal discipline" argument has
never been a winner. Americans care about a lot of things
you can spend money on, but they're not big on balancing the
checkbook. That's why Bush was able to give a lackluster
State of the Union speech Tuesday night but still come off
looking strong.
All the opposition could say was "balance the budget."

the end. The Democrats have followed President Bush to the
Capitol for the State of the Union, but now they have
nowhere to go.
NBC was kind enough to provide a PowerPoint presentation during Bush's speech on Tuesday, so those of us who will
one day work for corporations don't need any help deciphering it. As for the rest of you, how can you live without

PowerPoint?

Bullet-point crises notwithstanding, here is a run-down
The president has widened his vision to "three great goals'
for America: victory in war, homeland security and economic recovery. For the war, Bush promised more gun-slinging
action against ;an axis of evil." Homeland security has four

sub-categories: bio-terrorism, emergency response, airports

and intelligence.
As for economic recovery

well, somehow the bipartisan

education bill and'ANWR made it into this part of the speech
Bush conceded that the budget would run deficits for the
next few years, but he blamed Congress (ahead of time) for
making things any worse than they already are.
This third prong is obviously what the Democrats want to
seize on for the mid-term elections this year. They will al
support the war but blame the G.O.P for being too slow on
economic recovery.
How well will this work? Gephardt suggested that the two
parties put partisanship aside and work together in this time
of national unity. But national unity won't bring too many
victories for the party out of power. I do hope there is more
to the Dems' strategy. There must be.

Pretzels? Probably not.
Enron? More plausible.
? Yes!

Draft bill carries dangerous implications
BY CHRIS SEGAL
In another worrisome government action, United
States Congressman Nick Smith has introduced to the
House of Representatives a new draft bill, H.R. 3598,
the "Universal Military Training and Service Act of
200L" The bill's full title is "To require the induction
into the Armed Forces of young men registered under
the Military Selective Service Act, and to authorize
young women to volunteer, to receive basic military
training and education for a period of up to one year."
Curt Weldon, whose district includes Swarthmore, has

cosponsored the bill.

The immediate reaction of

most Swatties, I expect, is likely
to be a simple shrug. It is easy
to see why this would be, as the

All COs,

would be subject to giving up to a year of their lives to
the military. Finally, in its current form, the bill would
allow the draft to continue for an unlimited period of
time.
The absence of full exemptions for COs and of any
exemptions at all for students is deeply troubling. The
effect of this would be to create a more militaristic society than we have previously known. Israel comes to
mind as a nation where all young men train in the mil-

itary.

This is not to say that our nation would be transformed into a country constantly at war, or even that
the option to enlist the full populace would ever be used.
What is frightening and dangerous is simply that, if the
bill is passed, the armed forces
will hold the power, in perpeincluding
tuity (aside from another act
of Congress), to take steps in
that direction at any time,
without further input from the
Congress or the people.

'Stoner movies' through the ages
Stupidity tends to be
unpopular among us bright
college types. Not that this is
usually a bad thing. I'm all for
being a little bit elitist, if by
"elitist" you mean admitting
there are better rappers than
Puffy or that "Operation
Enduring Freedom" sounds
like a seventies superhero
comic storyline. But there's
good stupidity and there's bad
stupidity. And sometimes we
throw out the baby with the
JONAH GOLD
bathwater, in the process
missing out on some of life's
Where Eagles Dare greater things. Like the poetic
sight of a large, unshaven and
drug-addled Jack Black, prehistorically lumbering about in his briefs in Jake
Kasden's newish film "Orange County." Or, more compellingly, its hundreds of historical antecedents, from
Cheech and Chong to Bill and Ted to Beavis and Butthead
to the ineffable "Dude, Where's My Car?"
For lack of a better term, I'm going to give the vaguely
defined region of cinematic wonderfulness of which we
speak the not-exactly-right-but-close-enough title of
"Stoner Comedy." Before we proceed, a few clarifications:
There is no rule that says the Stoner Comedy has to
involve marijuana; indeed, many of the best don't.
Neither, unlike, say, "The Wall," do you have to be a drug
enthusiast yourself to like them: I don't smoke weed. No,
seriously, I don't, and I've seen "Wayne's World" more
times than I can count. The important thing is that it can
be funny, and funny in a certain way. Not subtle, no, but
not too loud. Not "American Pie" or "There's Something
About Mary" loud. It has to mumble, rather than scream,
whoa, dude. Yeah, man.
its message to the world: "Dude
...

Cool."
The so-called Stoner Comedy, as poorly defined above,
has a history longer than I am qualified to go into. I'm
sure Laurel and Hardy, the Three Stooges, and the like,
regardless of whether they were actually allowed to make
weed jokes in a pre-"Reefer Madness" era, was an influence on anyone who has ever hit their man-friend on the
head with a frying pan. They're probably funny. But I
haven't seen them, so in my world they don't exist. We

THE

PHOENIX

concern ourselves only with the last three decades, starting in the '7os with the founders of the modern stonermovie: Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong.

'7os and Early 'Bos
Cheech and Chong started it all. In 1978, "Cheech and
Chong's Up in Smoke" was released, and moron teenagers
and guys who lived in their parents' basements nationwide rejoiced. The eponymous characters are a Mexicanand a Chinese-American, respectively. They are, in the
grand tradition of these movies or possibly starting it, an
inseparable duo. Oh, yeah, and they smoke a lot of pot.
And tend to "accidentally" get animals, cops and other
authority figures stoned. This is, of course, funny. But
while their motifs have remained ingrained on the genre
throughout its history, more has followed.
The Late

The 'Bos
This was when interbreeding occurred. The teen comedy, a la "Porky's," and the whole goddamn John Hughes
pre-"Home Alone" oeuvre adopted some of our beloved
genre's conventions, and vice versa. Anthony Michael
Hall's nerd got stoned off Judd Nelson's stash in "The
Breakfast Club," and Ferris Bueller borrowed some of his
slackerness from Cheech and Chong without any overt
drug references.
Then, in the late 'Bos, came Bill and Ted. With them
came rock 'n' roll, time travel, the best acting Keanu
Reeves has ever done, and an excess of total non-non-nonheinousness. Add to that a total absence of drugs, a
badass soundtrack and Napoleon eating ice cream cake,
and the Stoner Comedy is again redefined. The sequel,
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey," also kicked ass. Dude.
They played Twister with death.

The '9os

Early on, we had "Wayne's World," still the only good
movie besides "Blues Brothers" to come out of an SNL
skit. Pre-Austin Powers Mike Myers and pre-disappearing-off-the-face-of-the-earth Dana Carvey have long hair,
ripped jeans, and a public access cable show. They proceed to introduce more catch phrases into American
slang than any movie since, well, "Bill and Ted." Vast

success followed.

Druggie-style stupidity proceeded to spread throughout American pop culture, spawning "Beavis and
Butthead," "Airheads," Tom Green (sorry, America), and
January 3% 2002

too many others to name. Occasionally, the drugs themselves came back into it, as in "Half-Baked," but let's face
it, there are only so many times seeing a dog get stoned is
funny. Stoner movies aren't funny because of the drugs.
Like Soylent Green, it's the people.
Marginally artier movies like "The Big Lebowski" also
showed the enduring appeal of stoners, while Kevin
Smith took the Stoner Comedy esthetic first indie 'n'
angsty (with "Clerks"), then slapstick ("Mallrats"),
romantic ("Chasing Amy") and all-encompassing
("Dogma," where Alanis Morissette plays a mildly stonedseeming God).
The nineties were good times. High times, you might

even say, if you were a dork.

The 21st Century
This decade, thus far, has been a pretty good time to be
a wacky slacker. We got "Dude, Where's my Car?," a far
funnier movie than we deserved, with an unprecedented
amount of sexual innuendo between the leads and such
it's a llama!" and "This is an
immortal lines as "Dude
...

A break-dancing stripper emergency!" "Jay
and Silent Bob Strike Back" struck us hard and fast, the
third-funniest, most-stoned-seeming Kevin Smith film.
And there's "How High," starring Method Man and
Redman. After being traumatized as a child by Vanilla Ice
in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II," I still don't quite
believe rappers can act, so I haven't seen this one yet. Let
me know if it's any good. And, finally, "Orange County,"
which is probably open at a theater near you right now. It
has the dean of admissions of Stanford taking ecstasy
instead of eating pot brownies like he would have fifteen
years ago. As my man Wayne would say, my, how things
have changed
NOT!
All in all, the future looks bright in our culture for all
stupidity, the good and the bad. So while we're stuck with
*NSYNC, John Ashcroft, and "Pearl Harbor," we can at
least revel in the comedic genius that is semi-naked
passed-out Jack Black. And that
almost makes it all
worthwhile. A sequel to "Dude, Where's my Car?" would
make almost anything worth it. This won't happen, but
I'm still holding onto the hope. And, failing that, I'm praying for the future depicted by the prophets Bill and Ted in
their most excellent adventure. A groovy Utopia of futuristic types, united under these mottos: BE EXCELLENT
TO EACH OTHER and PARTY ON, DUDE. Like, sounds
good to me, man.

'I Am Sam': tear-jerker, but worth it
BY MORGHAN HOLT

mholtl@swarthmore.edu

Let's be real: I'm not one to cry at the movies. I'm usually more inclined to vomit than shed a sympathetic tear
for Hollywood's false, forced sentimentality. I don't waste
my time with tear-jerkers because they only piss me off.
This one, though, was so touching, so moving, so utterly
realistic in its painful portrayal of man and daughter torn
apart, that, in spite of myself, I was swallowing throat
lumps throughout. Jessie Nelson's new release, "I Am
Sam," got to me the way no movie has.
Sean Penn convincingly plays Sam Dawson, a mentally
retarded, menial Starbucks employee. After a brief fling
with a homeless woman who used him for the sheltering
roof of his apartment and the warmth of his bed, Sam
finds himselfabandoned with a child in his arms. Waiting
for the bus with his new, unnamed baby, he listens to the
Beatles singing in his head. Lucy, he calls her, Lucy in the
Sky with Diamonds.
With a little help from his college-educated neighbor,
Sam manages to feed, clothe and bathe his baby, who blossoms incredibly in the warmth of his unbounded love.
Still unaware of how utterly different her father and his
group of shamelessly hilarious disabled friends are, Lucy
relishes her life, the repeated readings of the same Dr.
Seuss stories, the
cramped
one-room
apartment, and her
father's childish, innocent guffaw.
By the time Lucy is
seven, though, her
adoring naivete has

peared.

She understands her dad is difand,

ferent,

often,

She surpasses

his

reading ability, his
common sense and, for the most part, his intellectual
capacity. She tells her best friend she was adopted, and,
when her school contacts family services about Sam's

parental limitations and the bigwigs come to take Lucy
away from her own birthday party, she doesn't seem to
mind it terribly.
It's only when she doesn't see her father, when she
doesn't hear the loud, uncontrolled laughter that embarrassed her so much, when she doesn't have the option of
hating his presence in her life, that she realizes how
important he is to her.
But it doesn't take Sam that long. Though he's a far cry
from being a genius, Sam's emotional insight is impressive. He knows he loves his daughter. He knows no

"Fosters" could love her as much or as well as he does.
And he's determined to get her back.
Flipping through the yellow pages, Sam's friend selects
lawyer Rita Harrison on the basis of her bold, flashy ad.
Her

self-proclaimed

title, "The Lawyer
Who Never Loses," is
embodied in a wellgroomed, power-suit-

ed Michelle Pfieffer.
She's the lawyer who
never loses, but she's
also the lawyer who
never cared about
anything but herself.
Sam, obviously, is
incapable of paying
her high fees; he
mopes persistently about her office, appalling her paying
clients, and driving her out of her mind. Rita wants nothing to do with him or his unintelligible speech. In fact,
she does everything she can to evade him until her own

boasting gets her stuck taking his case, pro bono.
In the process of arguing Sam's case, proving to the
court that a disabled man can love his daughter and, ultimately, do right by her despite his obvious intellectual
shortcomings, Rita is forced to reassess her own life. Rich
beyond belief, she gives her son whatever he wants, but
then screams at him to leave her alone as she frantically

stuffs her face with marshmallows and frets about her
husband's poorly disguised affair. She's miserable, but
pretends she's not. It takes Sam's unexpected insight to
finally show her the light.

The court's questioning of Sam's competence as a parent, juxtaposed with clips of Sam sprawled out across
beanbag chairs and singing songs with Lucy, is wrenching. When he loses, it's almost unbearable. For the duration of the trial, Rita is a miserable, callous bitch, and
Sam falls to pieces under the duress of the prosecution. He
can't convince the court, or even his own attorney, that
"all you need is love."
As Sam's sad story unfolded and the

plot kept thickening, I got sick to my stomach. Something had to go right

for the schmoe, something had to redeem the movie, something had to warm my heart. But for nearly two hours,

Sam kept getting knocked down, he kept running into the
bureaucratic walls, he kept arguing his flawless heart to
rooms full of people who were interested only in his defec-

tive mind.
Still, it wasn't until the very end that I got utterly fed
up with the sentimentality. Sean Penn is incredibly effective as Sam. The character and his plight are believable,
the social structure that intends to "look out for Lucy's
well-being" while blindly demolishing her whole world
and everything good about it is also, unfortunately, caustically realistic. As things finally start looking up, though,
the compensation is a bit much.
Critics called "I Am Sam" a sob story. They were right,
but it's a good one. It's the sob story of a man ostracized for
being born. It's the sob story of a man loving his daughter
more than most parents manage to love their kids and having his commitment,
perseverance
and
affection
ceaseless

always overshadowed
by the fact that he's just
not smart. It's the sob
story of a daughter who
finally appreciates her

different dad. It's the
sob story of a society
that puts much too
much stock in intellect
and not nearly enough
in pure, unbridled emotion. It's a sob story
that needs to be heard.

Photography exhibit emphasizes simplicity of nature
BY MARA

HVISTENDAHL
mhvistel@swarthmore.edu

When it comes down to it, nature is just a collection of geometric shapes.
We knew this back in grade school, when a
tree was a triangle resting on a rectangle and a
cloud was a collection of interlocking circles.
Since then, most of us have come to regard
nature as a wild, disorderly space. (Not coincidentally, we've also largely given up playing in
it.) If we find beauty in untouched land, it is a
danger-tinged, threatening beauty; the land
humbles and commands us, and we feel small.
Leave it to photographers Richard Kagan,
Harry Kalish and Brian Peterson to restore the
inviting simplicity and ordered aesthetic of natural landscape. The artists' works, on display at
the List Gallery through Feb. 24, share an
emphasis on line and geometric form.
List Gallery Curator Andrea Packard combined the photographers for the show because
all three demonstrate to the viewer that "you
can discover these moments of clarity and calm
in the most chaotic of landscapes," she said.
This conversion of clutter into coherence is
perhaps best illustrated by a photo of Crum
Creek taken by Kalish, who volunteers for the
arboretum. The creek, coveied with leaves, is
shot head-on, so that it is framed on both sides
by a receding "V" of trees. Kalish gives us a
sweeping view of the creek while still drawing
our eyes to small details: a triangle formed by
two trees over the water, a shadowy bush marking the vanishing point of the creek's banks, a
pair of darkened trees flanking the creek and

12

framing the shot. Other works are more
a close-up of swirls of leaves vertically cut by trees reveals its content only
after the viewer sifts through playful layers
of light.
Kagan's images are simpler to begin
with, but they share Kalish's unrelenting
focus. "Lacrimosa" is a shot of a lone tree
trunk. The detail is so precise that the eye is
drawn to a small pencil-thin shadow (a
branch?) cutting behind and perpendicular
to the tree. There is a pleasing balance to
the photo; the slightly off-center placement
of the tree is juxtaposed with a vertical mirroring of light as the image fades into darkness at both the top and bottom. Other shots
of Kagan's resemble pointillist paintings in
their grainy simplicity; Packard rightly
compared him to Georges Seurat. And triangle-shaped trees do make an appearance
one surreal photo Kalish
in the exhibit
shot in Tuscany, Italy features a square of
tall trees isolated among hilly fields. It's
proof that reality can resemble a Magritte
painting.
Peterson's photos are less spatial than
those of either Kalish or Kagan. The exhibit
includes three series by Peterson that are
water, earth
each studies of one element
and light. The drooping, straggly forms of
"Earth Music Series #7" could be gnome
dwellings. A high-contrast photo of a rocky
creek makes water look like oil, and an outof-focus shot of overlapping leaves appears
as a polka-dotted magical forest.
Nature never looked so inviting.

EP showcases
band's strengths

Multiple allusions make
for little orginality

bands need flashy guitar solos, funky effects
symphonic song writing, a $lO,OOO Ondes
Martenot and photogenic smiles just to put out a single.
But according to the Natural History, the best recipe for
a serious rock EP is a guitar, a bass and drums.
The Natural History start off the album with "You
Should Know." Following four measures of a syncopated
drum beat, a distorted but not overbearing guitar is
introduced. Playing at first what seems like the usual
two chords, guitarist and vocalist Max Tepper strums a
single minor second chord a la Hitchcock's "Psycho"
shower scene. One would generally think that such a
chord wouldn't be all that rewarding, but the dissonance
stings to put a creepy twist on what seemed at first to be
a regular home-cooked rock song. Max's deep voice
which recalls a mix between Nick Cave and Franklin
Bruno (from Nothing Painted Blue)
enters a few bars
later to drive on the song. After the band gets bored with
the same two chords, it shifts into a more melodically
and harmonically interesting chorus and bridge.
Drummer Derek Vockins throws in a few nice rhythm
change-ups, while Julian Tepper's bassline comes to the
fore as an independent musical voice.
The second track, "Estimations," maintains the tone
set in the first track but goes in a slightly different direction. The song is composed of seventh chords, so the
verse and chorus's progression resembles at times some
standard jazz progressions. For better or for worse, it
probably wouldn't take much to convert this into a ska
classic; but the Natural History keep rocking by way of
the distorted electric and energetic drum kit.
If you didn't take these guys seriously after hearing
the first two tracks, you definitely will after listening to
the third and final track, "The Enemy." This is a rockpunk hybrid that easily reminds people of what the
Pixies sounded like when they started out: tough, high
energy, 10-fi and raw. Replete with cymbal crashes, anxious lyrics and reverb, this song is toe-tappingly dance-

The first sound on "manic expressive" by her space holiday (note self-deprecating use of lower case) is a computerized voice "welcoming" you to the album, rather similar to
the one on the first Add N to [X] record.

Some

pedals,

able. What more could you want?
Max Tepper called this EP "something that got the ball
rolling." Whether they know it or not, they've produced
something that goes beyond that (it was recorded, by the
way, after only two weeks of rehearsal). Of course, like all
beginning bands, there are times when the group falls
apart, and there are times when it comes together. But
the Natural History have enormous talent, potential and
room to grow. Their name may place them explicitly in
the past, but make no mistake: powerful things will come
from the Natural History in the future.

JOEL BLECHER

Rather than whirrs and burbles and the sound of accelhowever, this rather tired trick is followed
by the comparably innovative sounds of an orchestra tuning up, interrupted by a few taps of the conductor's baton (a
device that may have been lying fallow since R.E.M.'s
"Nightswimming"). A solo violin launches into a lovely little melody, soon joined by the rest of the orchestra in a lush,
erating concrete,

politely brooding instrumental track. This soon subsides
into an atmospheric hum, which leads into the album's first
proper song, a mournful ballad that sets up some of the
album's lyrical themes self-doubt and the sadder aspects
set against loping IDM (Intelligent Dance
of love affairs
Music) beats and glitches. The marriage of symphonic textures with slowed-down Aphex Twin-style blip-hop and
pseudo-jungle, which is essentially her space holiday's m.o.
here, recalls some of the more sophisticated mid-90s trip-

hop releases, such as Mono's "Formica Blues" and
Everything But The Girl's "Walking Wounded."
But this is plainly singer/songwriter territory, albeit fancily got-up, and would never be mistaken for 'techno' (as
those albums were). And instead of a bleary-eyed European
chanteuse, these tunes are crooned with an appropriate mix
of pathos and heartfelt disinterest by hsh's central (only?)
member Mark Bianchi, and occasionally doubled by his
girlfriend Keely.
If this barrage of comparisons and references seems
excessive, it's frankly because not much that Bianchi does
here is strikingly original. At its high points, such as "the
ringing in my ears," "manic expressive" is truly enjoyable,
but elsewhere, in the inexplicable interview track "spectator sport" and the wallowing "perfect on paper" ("I don't
hate myself/just the things I do"), which plays like a despondent, pessimistic cousin to the Flaming Lips' "The Spark
That Bled," it just seems self-indulgent.
I have one more comparison to make, and in order to be
perfectly banal I'll make it as cliched as possible: her space
holiday's most immediate touchstone seems to be
Radiohead. Not that this sounds particularly like
Radiohead, any more than anything released in the last five
years, although the funky, electric-piano driven "keystroke"
wouldn't have sounded out of place on Radiohead's last two
discs. But it's hard to imagine a record like this in a pre"Kid A" universe, from its cover art (created by Shynola,
who also did the art for "Kid A" and "Amnesiac") to the

mechanical/emotional confluence that informs the music
and some of the lyrics. As much as it tries to create some-

thing original, and despite the not insignificant pleasures it
has to offer, "manic expressive" serves mostly as a reminder
that it's not the only one or the best of its kind
and there's

nothing wrong with that.

Cheer up, Mark.

Even Jay-Z realizes the irony of his statement, beginning the disc with a hilarious, maudlin welcome to JayZ's poetry reading."
While critics and even some loyal fans will complain
that "Unplugged" is too much a rehashing of songs
released earlier this year on Jay-Z's chart-topping "The
Blueprint," the songs take on whole new meanings in
their new versions. Right from the start, the live band
turns the Jackson 5 sample on "H to the Izzo (H.0.V.A.)"
from its cold, listless studio version to the live, lushly
gorgeous R&B groove that it is. Even Jay-Z himself seems
surprised when he says, "You gotta love that, man."
Other highlights are the powerful full orchestra digging into the hook on "Big Pimpin' and the complicated
percussion of The Roots' ?uestlove and his little brother,
Baby?uest. On Jigga What" and "It's a HardKnock Life,"
Jay-Z shows what makes him great, leading the audience
in timelessly catchy refrains. And while the band gets a
little stale late in the disc, the entire second half is
redeemed by the downright moving "Song Cry."
On amazon.com, you can buy "Unplugged" and
"Stillmatic" as one discount package. Don't. You would be
buying into the lyrical war contrived by Nas to revive his
stagnant career. Go with the art, buy "Unplugged," and
pick up Nas' 1994 classic "Illmatic" used, to keep the royalties out of that sellout's hands.

With Nas' new release "Stillmatic" currently outselling
Jay-Z's "MTV Unplugged," you might think Jay-Z's new
offering is a bit weak. After all, these two rappers have
been in a feud for years, and on his new offering Nas definitely takes the upper hand in the lyrical battle with his
brutal song "Ether." However, the real winner is Jay-Z,
for releasing the year's sleeper rap classic.
On "Unplugged," Jigga takes rap back to its poetic and
R&B core. With hip-hop scenesters The Roots serving as
his band and accompanying vocals from stars like
Jaguar, whose big voice explodes on "Ain't No Love," the
pop star pulls off an artistic coup few would have expected.

The phrase "experimental pop" doesn't

with a bright snare rat-tat-tat and a cheery

seven songs here range in style from the
lilting vibes-and-piano waltz of the title
track to the stomping, chunky guitar rock

pop music is its lack of variety (and even

of "Therefore, I Am."
And then there's the ingenious closer,

"Life Goes Off," of which the lyrics politely
detail the accoutrements of some rather
questionable goings-on ("You used to be
quite content with your shower cap/I guess

now I know you feel more at home/with a
case of handi-wrap") and pause to muse ("If
I were to die with these things on, you

might want to try another size"). A final
curveball comes the last two minutes, as
drum rolls and high-pitched hums subsume the song and lurch ahead into a strutting, epic crescendo of joyful noise.
It's worth noting that, though this
album is only a scant seven tunes long, it
reaches a fairly respectable 38 minutes,
meaning that the songs average about five
and a half minutes
which is saying
something, considering that most of them
call to mind tunes I could imagine someone
disparaging as "three-minute pop songs."
Jim and crew take those extra two and a
half minutes to create something truly
meaningful. O'Rourke gently nudges the
pop song in new directions, while allowing
all of its best qualities to shine in their full
glory.

"Ghost World," directed by the same and
based on Daniel Clowes's comic. Two recent high
school graduates, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca

to normal folks. Whilst attempting to evade a cookie-cutter strip

at 7:30 and 10 p.m. on Saturday in LPAC.

A dedicated fan of Swat's women's basketball team, Mike Loeb takes pride in his
school spirit. The Rochester, N.Y., native can be seen in both the lab and in the stands.

Through the missed shots and the three-point plays, in good times and in bad, one
member of the Swarthmore community is making his presence known not only in our
own Tarble Pavilion but also in Centennial Conference gyms far and wide. Front row
and center, spurring on the Swarthmore women's basketball team, Mike Loeb 'O3 stands
(or flails) tall and proud. This man is no fair-weather fan; he's a Super Fan. History can
testify that when Mike brings his A-game, the Ladies O' the Tide bring theirs.
Mike's fascination with the game of basketball has had a relatively short life span
thus far. Growing up in Rochester, N.Y., he was far from a basketball court. It wasn't
until he arrived at Swarthmore that he started to become interested in the game, playing "pick-up" when he could and studying the college's basketball teams. Contrary to
the beliefs of the women he watches, Super Fan doesn't frequent the games because of
some twisted divine calling that led him to forever traipse the earth in pursuit of
women's basketball contests. His desire to become a student of the game has resulted
in Mike's continued presence in the stands.
In fact, Mike credits himself for having initiated a following of the women's team.
"At the first women's game I attended, the stands were sparsely populated
just a
few fans and moms. I really enjoy the smart, fundamental basketball that the team displays, and I learn a great deal from sitting in the stands. I also liked that I could sit in
the front row and be heard."
Not just another pretty face in the crowd, Mike uses his vocal talents to badger the
referees, which he claims is serving the purpose of increasing the favor of the zebras
towards Swarthmore's behalf.
"I find the most effective way to voice disapproval of a call is to catch the referee
during the foul shot around half court while there is a lull in the action. My pet peeve
is the late-deciding whistler. How can you blow the whistle and then decide the call?"
Poor rhetorical Mike, causing nightmares for referees everywhere who dare to be
indecisive.

*%%*&
<&

As any "prime time playa" would, Mike has his own pre-game rituals and perhaps
even a lucky pair of panties. He refrains from trimming his luscious locks when the
team is on a winning streak "and I also have my own warm-up play list in my room
your standard ESPN Sportscenter theme, a little Queen "We Will Rock You" or "We Are
the Champions," and sometimes a little "Pump Up the Jam." I always make a conscious
effort to hydrate before each game."
Because you can't yell at the refs if you are suffering from a case of cottonmouth.
Scary fact number 1: Every time Loeb is late for a game, the team falls prey to the
opposition. For the love of God, Mike, walk briskly from ML!
Scary fact number 2: Mike was once referred to as an "animal" by a professor's
young daughter, a fact he is proud of.
In case any of you out there were wondering why Mike will sit with you in lab but
not at the game, he likes to sit by himself during the games so he can jump up and down
without hurting anyone.
Every bit a student of the game, possessing his own convictions on topics surrounding the team, Mike believes that there are certain keys the women need to focus
on in order to put themselves in position to defend their conference title.
"I think that the team needs to attack the basket more and not settle for jump shots
on the perimeter. The contest at Muhlenberg [next week] will be a huge game. I will be

early."

Mike also has strong feelings on what coach Adrienne Shibles' soon-to-be first child
should be named. "I think that either Shaniqua or Derrell would be good. The kid
would definitely be a bailer with one of those names."
And while we are sure that Mike has a favorite player on the team, mum was the
word, and he simply replied, "I think that Katie Tarr 'O2 would beat me up ifI didn't
say that it was her!"
In other matters, in a basketball-based celebrity death match between Bob Gross '62
and Martin Warner, Mike claims to have a tough time figuring who the winner would
be. "You definitely have to give Gross the advantage on the boards. When it comes to
sheer knowledge of the game, I would give it to Warner hands down, any day of the
week." For the record, we wouldn't be opposed to such an exhibition game if the
women's basketball team were allowed to pocket the profits. Ahh, another pipe dream
to be squashed by Quaker regulated monitory ideals.
From ML to the physics lab to the basketball court, Mike Loeb is a rare Swattie
indeed. Just the fact that there is such diversity in the places he haunts makes him special. He is true to his many passions in the enthusiasm he devotes to them. Mike isn't
just that faceless guy in your lab section, he is also that guy who happens to be the basketball team's most devout fan.
Mike's message to the world: "You don't have to be a Super Fan to show up to games.
Support Swat athletics!" Amen, Mike.

Garnet trounce Washington, close to playoff berth
From WOMEN, pg. 20

The tempo picked up in the second half of Saturday's
game, with both teams improving their shooting.
Swarthmore pulled ahead in the first part of the period,
but Gettysburg maintained a five-point plus cushion down
the stretch.
But with 43.7 seconds remaining, Swarthmore brought
the game to within two points on two free throws by Katie
Tarr 'O2. Tarr was fouled after grabbing an offensive
rebound off Robinson's missed jump shot.
The Garnet defense then forced Bullets guard Keriann
Van Nostrand into a tough baseline shot. She missed, and
Swarthmore grabbed the rebound with 15.2 seconds left
and the score 51-49.
Coming off a timeout, Ali Furman 'O3 brought the ball
up and dished it to Kile near the top of the key. Kile drove
right but couldn't get open and was forced to take a shortrange shot with her defender still guarding her closely.
The shot rimmed out, and Gettysburg grabbed the rebound
with five seconds left.
Gettysburg shot 38 percent from the field but still bested Swarthmore's 30.4 percent shooting. The Garnet also
missed 12 of its 25 free throws.
"Deep down, they know that we're a great shooting
team and that every team just has an off shooting night,"
Shibles said. "And we talked about it in the locker room
afterwards."
Shibles also attributed the loss to a great game plan by
Gettysburg. The team did a lot switching defensively,
which put pressure on Kile and forced the outside shooters
to make shots when they had open looks. Unfortunately, no
one stepped up offensively.

team got the ball to Wolff. She finished the night with 12
points, thanks to several inside looks.
Wolff came up big for the Garnet, playing 14 minutes
and contributing six of the team's points during the 12-1
run. Wolff, along with Kristen Lee 'O5 and Katie Morrison
'O5, have quickly become indispensable backup players.
Wolff also stayed in the Gettysburg game down the stretch,
playing nine minutes and grabbing two rebounds.
Wolff, who is 5'9", has played guard most of her career
but is quickly learning to play in the post position. The
**

transition has proved a welcome challenge for her.
"I'm a smaller post player," Wolff said. "I need to find
ways to defend them other than being big."
Shibles likes the rebounding presence Wolff brings to
the court and her ball handling skills. "She is strong physically as far as rebounding, and I think sometimes we have
a hard time with that," Shibles said. In full-court press situations, Wolffs presence makes it easier to break the
press, Shibles added. But her most valuable trait is her on-

court instinct.

"There are players who have instinct and there are
players who don't," Shibles said. "And she has it."
Swarthmore found its shooting touch again after a dismal performance against Gettysburg. In the first half
against the Bullets, the team shot 18.5 percent from the field
on 5-for-27 shooting and just 38.5 percent from the free
->

throw line. The team made just one field goal in the first
seven minutes of the game and entered the half down 20-15.
"I think we came in a little flat," Shibles said. Luckily,
she added, the women's defense kept the score close'.

Shibles

expected to

see more defensive switching

against Washington and hoped the Gettysburg loss would
prepare the players. However, Washington played more

aggressive man-to-man defense, but Swarthmore stepped
up by getting backdoor looks and by hitting its outside
shots anyway.
The Garnet, who currently sit atop the East Division of
the conference, play a struggling Bryn Mawr (3-14,- 1-9)
squad at home tonight at 7 p.m. before two tough road
games against Franklin & Marshall Saturday and West
Division leader Johns Hopkins Wednesday. A win over the
Mawrters would all but clinch a playoff berth for the Tide,
and it's a strong possibility that Swarthmore will face one
or both of the West Division teams in the conference play-

offs.

"It's important that we build momentum going into the
Franklin & Marshall game," Shibles said. Part of that, she
added, was bouncing back with two wins after the
Gettysburg loss. With the win at Washington Tuesday and
the almost-sure win against Bryn Mawr tonight, it looks
like mission accomplished.
Notes
Robinson's seven steals against Washington tied her season high. She leads the Centennial Conference in steals
with 4.67 per game.
Swarthmore's 15-point performance against Gettysburg
in the first half was the lowest for the Garnet in either half
this season.
While the team is known for its excellent shooting, its
defense in conference play this year has excelled: The team
is second in the conference in points allowed with 52
points per game.

determining lineups and ordering suits
in preparation for the Centennial
Conference championships. Both a
strong freshman class and a successful
season add to the potential of this year's
final meet.
"I am very excited about the end of the
season, because the team has showed
great potential in the first half and has
been constantly improving," said Natalie
Briones 'O3. "We look sharp and well prepared for the upcoming conference meet."
Last weekend, the team faced unexcompetition
Drew

against
University. Although Briones and Erin
Dwyer-Frazier 'O5 were out of the pool
due to illness, both teams rose to the challenge and had an excellent meet. The
women downed the Rangers 134-71 while
the men scored 114 points to Drew's 9L
Two of the most exciting swims of the
meet came from Stephanie Tonnesen 'O3
and David Whitehead 'O3. Tonnesen
dropped an incredible 34 seconds off her
previous time in the 1,000-yard freestyle.
In the final relay of the meet, Whitehead
swam his best college 100-yard freestyle
with a time of 47.66 seconds.
The time drops were particularly
amazing because Whitehead and the rest
of the team have not yet tapered or
shaven. Tapering is the practice of gradually shortening practices so swimmers
have more stamina at meets. Briones, a
national qualifier, says that tapering is
essential because it allows a swimmers'

muscles to recover from the beating that
they suffer during the first portion of the

season.
Swimmers shave their arms and legs
in order to reduce drag and to psychologically prepare for serious competition.
"After a season of wearing drag suits
in practice and unshaven legs, tight suits
and smooth skin make the water feel different, easier to move through," Melanie
Johncilla 'O5 said. "This effortlessness
makes us swim like stars."
With just four meets left, the end-ofseason shaving and tapering are looming.
While the Drew meet was not as challenging with respect to the competition, it
proved to be a testing ground for the
Tide's training. The meet saw five triplewinners for the Tide, three for the women
and two for the men. A staggering 21
swimmers swam season best times
against the Rangers.
This week the team is laboring
through some of the hardest practices of
the year in preparation for a meet against
Gettysburg this Saturday, Feb. 2, according to Mike Auerbach 'O5. The meet is the
last home meet for the Tide and should be
one of the toughest of the season.

"Hopefully, our swims this weekend
are a more promising omen for our
upcoming meet with them," said
Meredith Leigh 'O4. "It will also help
since that will be a home meet. We're trying to get lots of people to come by the
pool at 2 p.m. so that they can see a good

Letendre looks to lead Garnet comeback
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

At first glance, Garnet Tide point guard
Jacob Letendre 'O4 seems to be an unassuming leader. The 5'11" veteran is the first
to admit that he doesn't have the dominant
inside presence of Heather Kile 'O2 or the
sweet shooting touch of Katie Robinson 'O4.
He doesn't even lead his own team in two
important statistical categories, scoring
and rebounding.
But probably more than any other player on a Swarthmore team, Letendre embodies the identity of his Garnet Tide team.
For better or worse, his game reflects the
persona of a basketball team that relies on
possession, defense and old-fashioned hustle to make up for its lack of talent, size and

experience.

Possession: "Pass the ball to Jacob,
or don't pass the ball at all."
How much trust do coaches and teammates place in Letendre's hands? During
the second half of Monday's 60-57 heartbreaking loss to the Drew Rangers (8-10),
rookie center Blair Haxel 'O5 hauled down
a defensive rebound. Instead of passing the
ball to Letendre, he attempted to pass the
and
ball to one of his other teammates
the pass was stolen. Head coach Lee
Wimberly yelled at Haxel in frustration,
"Pass the ball to Jacob or don't pass the
ball at all!"

Earlier in the first half, the Tide established a seemingly comfortable 10-po'int
lead. Wimberly gave Letendre a rare break,
taking him out of the game for a breather
while the Garnet had the game under control. After two quick turnovers, the Garnet
Tide saw its lead rapidly dwindle to two
points. Before he could even finish his
drink, Letendre was brought back onto the
court. Although the team wasn't able to
regain its double-digit lead, it regained its
handle on the ball and ended the Rangers'
8-0 run. By halftime, the Tide led the game
by one point, 31-30.

The defender: "I put a lot of pride in
defense."
With 15:39 remaining in the second half,
Letendre helped the team retake its onepoint lead by nailing an open three-pointer.
The very next play, he tied up a Drew player on the defensive end to force a jump ball.
The fans at Tarble Pavilion erupted in a
rare show of approval, chanting, "DEfense, DE-fense."
The team continued to feed off
Letendre's play, with Kyle Lewis 'O2 and
Matt Gustafson 'O5 working hard on the
offensive glass and scoring on second and
third chances.
With 12 minutes remaining, Letendre
made a key block that ignited the crowd.
Moments later, Josh Loeffler 'O3 hit a threepointer for a 42-38 lead, and the frustrated
Drew head coach called for a time out.
The energizer: "I play off the crowd."
With 20 seconds left in the game and the
Garnet trailing 58-57, Chris Loeffler 'O3
intentionally fouled Drew forward Peter
Boyer. Before Boyer's first free throw,
Letendre waved to the crowd to make some

noise; the crowd responded accordingly,
and the forward hit just one of two free
throws to push Drew's lead to 59-57. On the
ensuing possession, Letendre drove the
length of the court and penetrated Drew's
defense. As the crowd held its collective
breath, Letendre got off a left-handed shot
in the paint. Unfortunately, the ball failed

to find the bottom of the basket. After
another intentional foul and a free throw
by a Drew guard to inch the lead to 60-57,
Kyle Lewis missed a last-ditch three-pointer to tie the game in the final seconds of
the second half.
Despite Letendre's efforts, the team still

had difficulty finding the bottom of the net.
After shooting a respectable 43 percent
from the field in the first half, the Tide finished shooting just 36 percent. Letendre,
who averages just 34 percent from the field,
realizes that shooting is one of his, and the
team's weaknesses. "I concentrate on get-

ting guys an open shot," he said. When
Letendre is left open, though, he'll take the
open jumper. One observer noted that
Letendre makes his shots through "sheer
will."
The future: "We're moving in the
right direction."
After two losing seasons, Letendre is
optimistic about turning the men's basketball program around. "We want to get to

the level of the women's basketball team,"
he said. With a group of promising freshmen, Letendre believes that the current
group of players can make the Centennial
Conference playoffs in the upcoming years.
With Letendre at the helm, the Garnet's
goal seems closer than ever. Through
strength of will and dogged determination
game in and game out, Letendre is making
his mark on a growing team.

Haverford win gives badminton momentum for PAIAW tourney

The third former tri-captain, Karen Lange 'O2, spent last
semester abroad and considers herself somewhat rusty. "I
didn't train as much last semester as I really would have
liked," Lange said. She is also making the transition to singles play from doubles play, in which she won the
Philadelphia Area Intercollegiate Association for Women
(PAIAW) conference championship with Carty last season.
Lange showed no signs of rust or discomfort on Thursday
as she soundly defeated her opponent 11-2,11-6.
Despite the loss of Ng and Carty, the team as a whole is
poised to repeat the success of last year, when they won the
PAIAW conference championship. "[Ng and Carty] will be
missed a lot," Liz Leininger 'O4 said, "but we have a lot of

Leininger is among the players who have stepped up

In addition to its solid core of veterans, which also
includes Olga Rostapshova 'O2, Laurel Beesemyer 'O4, and
Eve Gilman 'O2, the Garnet has several promising firstyears who have "been coming regularly and working really hard," Leininger said.
The team's tradition of excellence and smooth transition from last year is due, in part, to the contributions of a
group of men who practice with the team. The men may not
partake in intercollegiate competition officially because
the college does not recognize a men's team. However, the
men practice with the women's team both to "continue personal cultivation" and to "provide good competition" for
the women, according to Brendan Karch 'O2, who has been
playing badminton for six years. Lange speaks highly of
Karch and the other men. "The guys are definitely a huge
asset to the team," Lange said. "They always come and
challenge us a lot. They are very competitive."
Yesterday's match with Bryn Athyn was cancelled. The
Tide will resume play this Saturday, Feb. 2, in the PAIAW

about entering the tournament having played only one
match, however. "I think it should be all right," Leininger
said. "We had strong finish at conferences last year."

Tide bounces back
from first CC loss
Garnet regains offensive touch against
Washington College after cold shooting
led to close loss to Gettysburg Saturday
BY BRENDAN KARCH

bkarchl@swarthmore.edu
Losses are always tough, especially
conference games, and especially at
home.

But when women's basketball head
coach Adrienne Shibles said that
Saturday's conference loss at home
against Gettysburg, 53-49, "might be
the best thing that could happen to us,"

she had her reasons. The Garnet, she
said, is a team that learns from its mistakes.

Swarthmore did learn from its mis-

takes, bouncing back from Saturday's
loss by clobbering Washington College,
73-56, in an away game Tuesday. The
win gives the team a record of 15-4 (8-1
Centennial Conference) and provides
some much needed momentum going
into the last two weeks of the season.
The game against Washington was a
tale of two halves. Swarthmore took an
early lead, but the Shorewomen went
on a 12-0 run before the Garnet countered with its own 11-5 run, tying the
game at 35 at the half. But Swarthmore
pulled away in the middle of the second
period, coasting to a season sweep over

Washington.
"We just executed our game plan a
little better in the second half," forward
Heather Kile 'O2 said. Kile led all scor-

ers with 22 points, added nine rebounds
and went 14-for-17 from the free throw
line.

"They called the game a little tighter
tonight," Kile said, "and I think that
worked to my advantage."

For comprehensive statistics and
standings for women's basketball
and other teams, see pg. 17.
Katie Robinson 'O4 contributed 19
points on 9-for-16 shopting and grabbed
eight boards and seven steals.
Kile was double-teamed throughout
the night but was able to kick the ball
out to shooters. "I think that that was
probably their game plan, not to give
me any easy shots," Kile said. She and

Ali Wolff 'O5 scored all of Swarthmore's

points on a 12-1 run in the second half.

The plan was simple: when Wolffs
