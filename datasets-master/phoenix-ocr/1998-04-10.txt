Gross Speaks as Dean
Search Enters Final Stages
by Ruth Shoemaker
On Monday, April 6, Acting Dean of the
College Bob Gross made his campus
"visit" as a finalist in the search for a new
dean, addressing students in Kohlberg
lounge as two other candidates did before
him. Gross began the discussion by speaking about the time he has spent at Swarthmore as a student, a faculty member, and a
dean, and the diverse perspectives he has
acquired as a result of his campus roles.
Gross praised the College by saying, "I
am always impressed when I leave campus to realize what a distinctive place this
is." He discussed his attendance at a conference for deans of small colleges and universities and explained that he brought back
three realizations about Swarthmore that
make him proud to be a part of the community: Swarthmore students are very
motivated, think more deeply about political issues, and drink far less than students
at other institutions. Gross addressed the
question of what keeps him at Swarthmore
by citing the quality ofhis colleagues and
the students and the role he sees himself
playing in improving life on campus: "I
think this place should be fun," Gross explained. "I believe in my work I make this
a better experience for a lot of students."
Accomplishments achieved as a dean of
which Gross is most proud include his work
with individual students and his establishment of the Student Academic Mentoring
(SAMs) program, which "fits well with the
culture of Swarthmore." However, the advising program, which Gross believes
needs to be altered in order to work as it is
intended to, is an area he feels he could
have done a better job coordinating.
When asked to explain his feelings about
alcohol on campus, Gross explained that
the College would have an easier time if
the drinking age were 18 and efforts could

be focused on controlling consumption. He
discussed the importance of party permits
and PAs, saying that in most cases they
were effective.
Gross also spoke briefly about safety on
campus, explaining the "illusion of invulnerability" that exists at Swarthmore and
the challenge this presents to achieving a
truly safe campus.
When asked by Vincent Jones '9B to outline his "vision statement," Gross explained
that the goals of Swarthmore College are
"academic excellence, social justice, and
social responsibility and commitment"and
stated, "My goals are to work with the faculty and students to meet these goals." He
went on to explain that he envisions the
future dean's staff working more closely
with faculty to improve the academic experience, and working to improve the advising system and the academic support
system which he described as "fragmented."He expressed ideas about improving Tarble, as well as improving the Intercultural and Interfaith Centers, which he
believes are underserved in terms of space
and resources. Gross also expressed concern about student stress levels at Swarthmore and vowed to work with faculty to
create a healthier balance in students' lives.
Gross spoke about what he has learned
from addressing various incidents on campus by explaining that once a problem is
solved, it does not stay solved. He also explained that as committed to social justice
as the Swarthmore community is, the problem of racism has not been solved. He
expressed a need to work constantly
through conversations, meetings, and action to address this issue and explained, "It
takes only one person with a piece of chalk
to create enormous tension for a community." Gross addressed concerns about improving the experience of students of color
on campus by discussing the disconnect-

David Henry Hwang,
Playwright, to Speak
by Kathryn Tong
To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the
Swarthmore Asian Organization (SAO), playwright David Henry Hwang will be speaking this
Friday, April 10th at 1:00 p.m. in the Lang Performing Arts Center. Hwang is renowned for his
Broadway play, M. Butterfly, which won the
Tony Award in 1988. His collection this Friday
is entitled "The Myths of Asian Authenticity"
and will address the issue of the representation
of Asian Americans.
According to SAO representative JenLee '9B,
the organization chose Hwang last year because
theyi wanted a visible Asian American Cooper
speaker. His role as the only well-known, Asian
playwright has forced Hwang to bear the burden of representing much of the Asian community. Hwang has been criticized by some as being an unauthentic Asian voice. Others, including Lee, disagree and believe that his plays have
an important role in the Asian community, raising pertinent issues concerning gender and sexuality, previously consideredtaboo. Lee also feels
that Hwang has been able to recognize Asian stereotypes of the Asian female and incorporate
them in his work, something that other male
Asian writers have not been able to do successfully.
Lee said that convincing Hwang to come to
Swarthmore was relatively easy because of the
College's reputation and the Cooper grant, which
paid for his honorarium. She says that he has
frequently visited other colleges in the past to
speak about Asian American identity. A question and answer session will follow Hwang's
collection and interested parties should contact
Professor Ken Saragosa of the English Department for additional information.

edness of faculty and the admissions office. He assured the audience that he is
engaged in regular conversations about the
minority experience at Swarthmore with
Provost Jennie Keith and Assistant Deans
Tim Sams and Anna Maria Cobo.
Gross explained the responsibility he has
to the community serving as an example:
"We can't make you treat each other the
way we want you to be treated. We need
to set the tone from the top
from me,
from the faculty
about what values we
stand for. We need to create experiences
for you to work together, to learn from each
other."
If not selected by the search committee,
Gross could return to his former position
as Dean ofAcademic Affairs. Gross, however, says he is unsure what he will do in
such an event. "Whether that is fair to the
new person [the new Dean of the College]
or fair to me is something I'd have to give
a lot of thought to. I'm certainly not eager
to leave Swarthmore, but it possibly could
be a difficult situation." Professor Joy
Charlton is the Interim Associate Dean for
Academic Affairs in Gross' absence.
The final candidate for Dean of the College, Dr. Alma Clayton-Pederson from
Vanderbilt University, is set to meet with
students tonight in Kohlberg Coffee Bar
from 7-8:30 p.m.
The Dean Search Committee, which
comprises three students, three faculty
members, and three staff members, will
submit a recommendation to Al Bloom and
an offer will be made to one of the candidates by the end ofApril. Hugh Weber 'OO,
a student committee member called the
process "refreshing," explaining that the
student voice accounts for one-third of the
final decision of which candidate is selected. "We've been told [by Bloom] that
our [the committee's] decision will be the
final decision," Weber explained.

Lang Committee Awards
Opportunity Grants
by Tamara Onwuegbuzia
The 1997-98 Lang Committee recently
awarded Lang Opportunity Grants to two
pairs of Swarthmore students. The purpose of the grants is to fund student-initiated projects that will address an important social issue, as well as benefit a specific community affected by that issue. The
grants, which consist of up to $lO,OOO per
project, are awarded after an open competition.
The winners for this year are David Zipper 'OO and Peter Murray 'OO, who proposed to start a painting company in the
American Street Empowerment Zone in
North Philadelphia; and Alma Ortiz 'OO
who will implement an English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) mentoring program
that will connect Swarthmore students with
students from the Mexican immigrant community in nearby Kennett Square. Ortiz
will initiate the project with a fellow classmate who preferred not to be named in this
article.
Zipper explained that his and Murray's
painting firm will hire unemployed workers and high school students from the North
Philadelphia area and train them in marketing, painting, and business ownership.
They plan to begin the project next spring
and continue working on it until their
graduation. "Peter and I have dreamed of
initiating such a project ever since we took
Urban Economics last semester," said Zipper. "The Empowerment Zone is in dire
need of jobs and we wanted to provide
some. The Zone, which was initially designed to attract small businesses, has not
been that successful so far. Hopefully Peter and I can prove that students from educational institutions like Swarthmore can
further the success of stores in such areas."
The ESL mentoring program will deal
specifically with young Mexican students
who are at risk of either not performing

well in school or not completing school at
all. "The objective is to motivate these students academically while at the same time
instilling in them an understanding and appreciation for Mexican culture," explained
the anonymous grant recipient.
According to Lang Coordinator Verna
Cole, "the committee was really impressed
with the high quality of applications. The
hard work and time investment ofall of the
applications was evident." This year's
committee consists of Acting Dean ofCollege Bob Gross, Dean of ResidentialLife
Myrt Westphal, Lang Coordinator Verna
Cole and select members of Swarthmore
faculty and alumni.
The Lang Opportunity program consists
of two types of grants. The first is a "feasibility fund" of up to $l,OOO, which simply
allows a scholar to further develop a project
proposal. The second involves a completed,
detailed, fully-developed proposal that is
ready for submission to the final competition for funding up to $lO,OOO. This year's
winners applied for the second type of
grant.
In order to become eligible for a Lang
Opportunity Grant, students must convince
the grant committee that there is a well
thought out plan behind their proposal. Student applicants are asked submit a proposal
providing evidence that they will be able
to successfully create the proposed organization or facility, that their project can
realistically be carried out within the proposed location, and that there are measur.able means for evaluating the success of
the project.
Student applicants are also asked to demonstrate that there is interest and support
for the project they propose. They must finally show that their organization or facility is needed and will be supported by the
community, and that the facility or agency
will survive after the their direct involvement ceases.

Good Housing for All
The frenzy has already begun. Along the path, in Sharpies, in the mailroom,
upperclassmen recite their horror stories about the process and dispense
patronizing advice to guileless freshmen. And the latter, wary of the prospect of dungeondom next year hastily seek to form alliances (aka blocks)
with the former. The hottest topic of conversation suddenly switches from
"Who stole the bagel cart?" to on campus real estate.
Yes, yes, t'is housing season again. Which means the stress level amongst
students edges up another notch or two.
as if it isn't high enough already.
But must it be such a painful experience for all? Once an upperclassmen
painted the following grim picture of the housing process: "this is when
you find out who your real friends are."
Which encapsulates an underlying problem behind housing at Swarthmore. When do people become ruthless? What is the ultimate source of
conflict? As our friends down in Kohlberg would reply reflexively: scarcity
of resources. What then is the appropriate antidote to competition? The
answer naturally follows: equal access to the same
more specifically the
same quality of resources.
While we don't claim to be the last bastion of communism on campus, we
do feel that the concept of social equity and fairness should play a very
important role in the housing process.
What is the resource in question here? Not simply any housing, but rather
good housing.
Putting aside personal preferences and fetishes, students do evaluate their
housing options by certain objective standards. The fact that a hierarchy of
dorms
with Wharton and Parrish topping the charts and Willets trailing
exists in the consciousness of the student population is concrete
last
testimony to this phenomenon. In other words, there is a common understanding as to what qualifies as a good dorm and what is considered a bad
dorm. And those criteria can be easily identified: noise level, room sizes,
composition, size of total population, quality of amenities, location etc.
Granted, it is unrealistic to expect to achieve parity on all these counts,
but we feel that the College has yet to give its best shot. Why is Willets so
much more noisier than other dorms? Why is there only one kitchen in
Wharton and several in Parrish? Why did Danawell residents have to trek
all the way to the trailer just to watch TV?
We also realize of course the need to maintain a diversity of housing
options, as well as the sheer complexity of the task of trying to provide
generally satisfactory living conditions there are way too many variables
involved that it is simply impossible to monitor every single one of them so
as to please every single student. Nonetheless, we also feel that these practical considerations do not and should not in any way hinder the strive for
equality. The aforementioned qualifications can indeed be controlled to a
very large extent in every single dorm on campus, except for some of the
more inherent factors like location. Another way of maintaining parity would
be to counterbalance intrinsic disadvantages for example, since ML is so
far away, why not add a couple of more lounges or install more TVs, even
make the rooms nicer to give it redeeming value?

The bottom line is that no-one

The new lottery insurance was a step in the right direction to promote
fairness within the housing system. Here's the chance to take that campaign

We're Mad as Hell, and We're Not
Gonna Take It Anymore
A dark day has finally come to pass for America's institutions of higher
learning: Next year, the tuition for every Ivy League school will pass the
$30,000 mark.
We have all heard tirades about how higher education
and Swarthmore in particular
is too expensive, and we've also heard endless answers to that charge. But the decision of almost every top-tier private school
in America to cross into the $30,000 abyss is more than just another sad
statistic; it's a disheartening reminder that class warfare is on its way in
America, and the people who should be trying to stop it are not.
By insisting on repeatedly raising tuitionabove the rate of inflation, schools
are thumbing their noses both at public opinion and their commitments to
students. Sure, financial aid has increased along with the rise in tuition, but
that's by necessity. The final goal is obvious: Take as much money as
possible from the students who can pay, no matter if taking $30,000 from
even families that can pay still hurts them dramatically.
We have a better idea: Instead of jacking up tuition as high as possible
and increasing financial aid just to the point where students won't revolt,
why not lower tuition to a point where most people can actually begin to
afford it without loans, grants, state aid, and other bullshit?
Swarthmore loves pretending to be an incredibly forward-looking institution, and I think this is one area where the rubber meets the road, so to
speak. Numerous options are available: This school is so rich that it could
afford to lower tuition drastically perhaps even to $0 for a trial period,
at least, to bring attention to the plight of higher education funding. But
Swat doesn't even have to go that far. A year with absolutely no tuition
increase would be a good start. We want to see Swat do whatever it takes to
put higher education within thereach ofevery potential student. We haven't
seen that so far.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

PC Support Decision Made
Without Proper Student Input
To the Editor.
I am writing to express my concern over the
way that the Computing Services Committee
(and the student body generally) was circumvented in the decision to offer PC support beginning in summer 1998.
The Committee had no effective role in this
important and costly decision, although the official Computing Center (CC) statement on the
issue implies that it did, citing "8 months of intensive study and discussions with faculty, staff
and students (on the Computing Services and
College Budget Committees)" that supposedly
took place before the decision was made.
In fact, the Computing Services Committee
has met only three times over the course of the
year to discuss the proposal to offer PC support. I was appointed after the first meeting in
September.,At the second meeting in November, which I attended, the committee heard an
explanation of the PC support proposal being
developed by the CC. We (the few faculty and
studentmembers of the committee) offered limited thoughts but we were given no real mandate to act meaningfully on the issue by Tom
Stephenson, Associate Provost for Information
Services and the chair of the Committee.
Stephenson then asked us to approve further
consideration of the idea of PC support, never
making clear that it would be completely out of
our hands after this brief meeting.
At the next (and last) meeting in February, the
Committee was told that, during the threemonth
break between meetings, senior staff had approved the proposal and that PC support would
be offered beginning in the summer. The rest of
the meeting was spent discussing PC support
implementation.
There was no point to complaining; the issue
was announced as closed. Basically, the committee were entirely out of the loop and seemingly only called as a formality to legitimize
decisions made by the CC or Stephenson or
someone else (the impetus behind PC support
seems to simply exist without actually having
any outright proponents).
In his initial email to new Committee members, Stephenson said that "the major role of
the CSC is to advise the Computing Center director on policies and long-term directions for
the CC that affect faculty, students and staff."
However, the Student Council email soliciting
applications for the position states that Com-

puting Services "develops computer policy for
the college. Also advises the computing center
on the future needs of the campus." That is a
very different definition. Ultimately, College
committees may not have total decision-making power, but they should have some real involvement in important decisions in their field.
I think it is clear that the Committee was an
afterthought in a process in which it should have
been integrally involved. This seems to be the
most important computing decision at Swarthmore in several years and it was not dealt with
fairly, leaving me unable to represent the student body as I was appointed to do. The way in
whichthe issue was dealt with also seems symptomatic of a general problem with College Committees, who seem to lack any real involvement
in decisions in their fields.
More generally, no real student influence was
allowed in the process, which was confidential
until it was announced as final. In The Daily
Gazette, Melissa Binde, the Dorm Consultant
Manager, said that "I'm not aware of substantial student input, no. In my capacity as Dorm
Consultant Manager I helped to influence how
the support forPCs will be carried out but never
had input on whether we would do so or not."
Her experience seems to be similar to that of
most CC student employees, who were not involved in the process either.
To me, it looks like top-down decision-making at its worst and least accountable. Everyone
knew that there could be significant opposition
to the plan and no one ever took responsibility
for including students and faculty in the process. As aresult, the student body had no part in
a decision that could have a significant impact
on computing services at Swarthmore. I am not
concerned with whether or not PC support
should be offered; the way in which the decision was handled is what troubles me.
It just goes to show how important issues here
are often handled behind the scenes and then
announced as final decisions in order to preclude
any real student (or faculty) opposition. I would
have hoped that we would be given more respect, but apparently this is not the case. Hopefully, however, the administration, Student
Council and the Student GovernmentSubgroup
of the College Planning Committee will all work
to ensure that future decisions are not made in
this fashion.

Phoenix Mishandles
SUCK Acronym
To The Editor.
As one of the co-founders of the student
group to install cable for the dorm lounge
TVs, and as the creator of our acronym;: I
would like to point out a slight error in last
week's article on our campaign. Our name
is Swarthmore United for Cable
Konsumption, not "Consumption" as the
article stated. That is why our acronym is
SUCK.
Also, while the article stated that both we
and the Housing Committee agreed that
cable would necessarily have to be buried,
"raising the initial costs of campus installation," we would like to note that we are actively pursuing DirecTV and other possibilities that would not involve the initial expense
and disruption of burying cable on campus.

Respectful, Civilized
Discourse Needed
To the Campus Community:
We would like to offer our reflections on
the manner in which the campus responded
to the events which followed the distribution
of Holocaust denial literature. Specifically,
we are concerned with the series ofreactions
which played out in the form ofpersonal and
collective attack in both public and private
fora. Swarthmore as an institution encourages intellectual discourse on many topics,
yet sometimes the manner in which the discussions occur can be unproductive and damaging to both individuals and the campus
community.
It is important that in our increasingly diverse campus setting students from a wide
variety of racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds feel supported and valued. We are
pleased that different groups on campus are
taking steps toward creating a more responsive environment. We hope that these efforts
will continue, and that the College will add
to its agenda efforts which create a climate
of civility and mutual respect forall students
and the entire campus community. Swarthmore should be a place where all studehts
feel comfortable and honored.

Defining a
Swattie

An Ode to
Swarthmore

Just as the admissions office sent out the
last of its letters to applicants for the Class
of 2002, many students started to grumble.
Not about Swarthmore's newfound prestige. The much-discussed nineteen-percent
acceptance rate, the lowest in our history,
gave Swarthmore a place in the elite under-twenty club. Not about the quality of
the class. The newest members of the Swarthmore community boast record-high test
scores and qualifications. However, amid
&11 the euphoria, doubts have begun to
pmerge about the characterof our most recent brethren.
j Are many people now simply selecting
Swarthmore simply at the top-ranked
school in the country in the suspect US
News and World Report rankings? Has
Swarthmore merely become a stepping
stone to the career ladder rather than a path
to be trod thoughtfully? Will new highly
career-conscious students destroy our identity as a student body?
I doubt these assertions, but their points
of origin concerns me. First of all, while
both a particular "Swattie" stereotype and
people who fill it certainly exist here, the
members of the student body here fit into
no particular description nor should they. I
refer not to the concept of diversity, but
rather to the idea that people should not
expect everyone to mirror their actual or
desired selves.
Second, those who claim that we are increasingly attracting the career-conscious

leftist stereotypes by the difficulty of work
here. Swatties should also remember that
Swarthmore is no household name. Living
and associating on campus we tend to forget this, but everyone who replies "Where's
that?" when I mention I go here, proves
.this point. Students who can get in here
by in large can get into "bigger name
schools," given both our higher average
SAT scores, and the universities over which
many of us chose this institution. People
who choose Swarthmore not only choose
(his college itself, but also a liberal arts education. This has both the advantages of nurturing one's abilities to think, but also
means a less directed path. In short, it is
preposterous to suggest that someone who
chose to attend Swarthmore finds absolutely no redeeming value in it except for
. the name and prestige; other very important considerations come into play as well.
In addition, the Swarthmore studentbody,
like any other institution, undergoes
change, and Swarthmore impacts its students as well. The character of Swarthmore
is constantly in flux. Although a strong
activist tradition still exists, Swarthmore is
a far cry from the hotbed of radical politics during the late 60s. Since we pride
ourselves in shaping minds, Swatties
should recognize as well that people enter
as rocks, some formed slightly, not statues. I am not saying that people who enter
here clad in polo shirts and khakis will
emerge resembling revelers at Woodstock
(the first one), but college does change
people.
More importantly, I find it extremely conceited and morally wrong to suggest that
simply because people hold different views
from my own or view life in a different
manner that they do not deserve the opportunity to come here. I, for one highly
dislike both socialism and the idea of legislated morality, but I do not think those
who support these ideas have any less right
to attend this college than I do. In fact, as
the Editor-in-Chiefof a liberal paper, I have
learned a great deal from talking to conservatives here. For all our discussion of
diversity and tolerance, "Swats" (as I propose calling students, not stereotypes)

Swarthmore is a respected name forany of
us. After attending a high school filled with

hardly imagined myself defending the career-conscious. I do not defend insincere
Machiavellians ready to accept any job or

resume, rather those with a clear view of
what they want to accomplish. If attending
Swarthmore is a part of that and they have
the qualifications to be here, so be it. I do
not wish to invoke the laughable idea of
intellectualrelativism, but neither do I have
the arrogance to believe that those who do
not think about their future as I consider
mine deserve fewer opportunities. The les!son of this discussion above all, is for
"Swats" to be more realistic and less conceited. We may imagine ourselves in a
realm of pure thought akin to Salvador
Dalf's early, pre-commercial works, but at
the same time, we must locate ourselves
square within reality, like his fellow
Catalan Surrealist Joan Mir6's giant-footed
peasant. Swarthmore is part of a world,
but not a world unto itself.

The original intention of the Founders
in creating the Second Amendment is no
longer applicable in today's society. The
Founders intended to allow for the possibility that the citizens of the United States
would be able to mount an effective revolution against the federal government of
their country, in the event that the government became tyrannical or lost touch with
the masses. In that era, weapons which
could be effective against the nation's
army in a military action (rather than a
police action, as at Waco or Ruby Ridge,
where the government continues to regard
those revolting against it as citizens and
is unwilling to risk either the lives of its
law enforcement officers or the lives of
the would-be separatists) were commonly
available at a cost which most landowners could afford. More powerful weapons,
such as cannons and shipboard guns, were
available but not common, and a war could
be for the most part fought without the
purchase of many of these weapons.
With the change of the meaning of war,
the meaning of the Second Amendment
has also changed. Weapons which could
mount a frontal attack on the army of the
nation are not only unavailable to citizens
due to their price, but the sale of these
weapons must also be authorized by the
government even when the cash could be
obtained. One of the computer CEOs, for
instance, has run into problems with the
US government through his attempts to
purchase a Russian warplane; he wants the
plane's weaponry intact, but the government refuses to allow the purchase to go
through without theremoval of the plane's
weaponry systems.
The new meaning of theSecond Amendment has become, by necessity, terrorism.
The easily available weapons of this era
are, for the most part, homemade bombs
which are deployed against what we
would tend to describe as nonmilitary targets. Limiting destruction to military targets by penetrating security or creating
weapons which are sophisticated enough
to stand up to a frontal military attack requires a level of expertise and funding
which is not "commonly available."
This change in meaning of the Second
Amendment from militia to terrorism is
not something which the United States has
the moral standing to criticize. The government differentiates between military
and nonmilitary targets in a very different
way when those targets are not located in
our country. In Vietnam and Cambodia
military targets were designated by zones
of country believed to be controlled by the

Irish poet and Nobel laureate Seamus

out, enables us to visualize and reach the

As the search for a new vision forAmerican society and its place in the global community picks upits pace, across the nation,

a more humanistic world.
Albeit at a steep cost. Some may ask, is
it worth the $29,000 stickerprice? For quite
a few families that amount far exceeds their
annual income. As someone who has spent
many semesters extractingknowledge from
multiple sources ranging from the Federalist Papers to the Uncertainty Principle, I
think it is safe to answer yes. But isn't it
possible to obtain the same intellectual
experience, acquire the same knowledge at
a less costly university. Yes and no. Certainly, the same textbooks may be recommended and read, but there is something
more fundamental about the liberal arts
education.
Aside from its theological insistence that
students be competent in all areas of intellectual achievement, it teaches each, and
everyone of its adherents how to create

the
very naked intellectual pursuit, no strings

to not merely think about what is, but rather
what ought to be. Itis an approach to learning heavily steeped in a tradition of ethical

On the domestic front and globally, we
are witnessing radical changes in how we
organize society, produce goods, develop
and share knowledge, among other things.
Few are well prepared to deal with thepressures of rapid changes. What Swarthmore
is doing is to locate herself to help shape
that process in a fashion that does not neglect to remember that at heart we are all
good people.
The aforementioned scholar-workers can
be found today teaching in public and private schools, on factory floors, in investment banks, in the US State Department,

are found everywhere in America, and increasingly around the world. Who are they?
They are your sons, daughters, and relatives who are making a difference in many
peoples lives by bringing to bear their ability to envision a miraculous world, and
devoting themselves to ensuring that a seachange that carries us to the other shore
does in fact materialize.
They are fearless because they know history is on their side, and that it is their responsibility to renew America, and ensure
that once again, Swatties become the visionaries of a sunrise whose rays gently lift
all hearts to the silver lining in the sky.
To the next generation of compassionate,

I salute you! Thank you for keeping the

THE ARTS

Cruising Down The Crum In Style
Crummy Advice
The Bear (as told to Katie Menzer)
Dear Bear,
We've been tired and grumpy all week, and
it's all because of those darn farmers and their
Daylight Saving Time. We don't care about
farmers or the hours they keep. We don't even
care about their crops. We would rather suck
on an Olestra soaked potato-like chip grown
on an agar plate in a darkened incubator in Iceland than let something that's been sitting
around in a pile of dirt for months pass our
lips, anyway.
We're tired of being a tool of the farmer. They
take away an hour of our lives every April and
keep it for over half the year and give us nothing in return. If timeis money, as they say, then
those agriculturists owe us some big bucks, and
we ain't talkin' no lima beans here.
Well, we're sick of it. We're sick of it all.
And we're not going to take it anymore. We
will no longer succumb to the farmers' pastoral whims. Time belongs to no man, especially
not some glorified gardener. We want to reclaim our destinies. We want to take back the
morning. The revolution is coming and it as
all beginning with us.
Unfortunately, while we do have the drive
and the determination, we don't yet have a
"plan" in the conventional sense of the word.
That's where you come in, furry friend. With
your brains and our...uhh...je ne c'est qua, we
can wrestle the clocks back from the farmers.
So, are you behind us?

Affectionately yours,
The Time Bandits
Dear Time Bandits,
Sure, buddies. I'm behind you. I'm just very,
very, very far behind you. But I'm sure the
farmers' backhoes and threshers will be no
match for your je ne c'est qua.
Bears, you must remember, don't have wrists.
Therefore, we don't wear watches. We don't
really suffer underthe same timerestraints that
you wristed primates endure. Daylight Saving
Time means little to me. And, in fact, I support
any proposal that has groggy undergrads stumbling to their classes in the darkened hours of
the morning. Instant breakfast, if you catch my
drift.
But the bear understands yourrage, no matter how displaced it might be. Daylight Saving Time isn't really an evil ploy of the farmers to disrupt you body clock. It was first put
in place here in the U.S. during WWI to conserve energy that was being wasted on lighting in the evenings. So, if you think of it that
way, DST is really sort of a good idea.
But the bear has never been a big proponent
of good ideas for humanity. I'm sure you guys
thought the bear trap was just a brilliant idea.
And the next time I have to gnaw off my own
leg to get out of one, I'll be sure to growl your
praises.
As for DST, the bear has given this some
thought and come up with two alternatives.
First, everyone thinks the big problem with
Daylight Saving Time is the springing forward,
not the falling back. If we just fell back all year
round, people would be quite contented. So,
that's what I propose. Let's completely disregard the setting ofclocks forward and just set
clocks back. We would set clocks back one
hour in the fall and then do it again in the
spring. That would be a net gain of two hours
of sleep each year, and who could really complain about that?
But since adding two hours onto each year
would wreak havoc upon the calender, we've
got to find a place to remove that added time.
The obvious conclusion is to delete a full day
every twelve years, preferably a Monday because nobody like Mondays, anyway.
Now, I know what you clever humans are
thinking. The aforementioned plan doesn'treally address the issues that DST has been invoked to correct. And, in fact, this plan could
create new problems when, in six years or so,
we will all be getting up in the middle of the
night and going to bed just as the rooster begins to crow.
That's why I have come up with plan #2 for
the more discriminating taste. We set back the
clocks as normal each fall. In the spring, we
all agree to set back are clocks, again. But this
time, however, we set our clocks back a full
23 hours instead of just a measly 60 minutes.
We would all regain a day. And since we traditionally set the clocks back at 2 a.m. on Sunday, we would, in fact, receive a second Saturday! A whole new day to frolic and the woods
and lick yourself.
Since adding a new day each year to the calendar might, again, create some problems in
100 years or so, every four years we must delete three days from the year. I would suggest
removing a Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
from some miserably cold month, like January, or from some miserably hot one, like August.
Remember, the solution to this world's ills
is not revolution but unscrupulous manipulation.

Swat Shipwrights Set Sail In Regatta
by Patrick Boe
Early on Sunday morning, six unusual
watercraft were more or less launched
into the freezing waters of the Crum. The
annual Crum Creek Regatta, started in
1972 by then-seniors Ron Miller and
John Lubar, was off to an exciting start.
The six teams, which had spent anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks
planning and building their makeshift
boats, rafts, pontoons, and floating pods,
scurried to attain the lead. For five hundred tension-filled meters, the teams
jockeyed and jostled each other, dividing their energies between pushing ahead
and warding off hypothermia. The boats
covered the whole distance in less than
five minutes, and there was high drama
throughout.
Unfortuantely, even before the starting
trumpet flourish, one boat's crew was
forced to concede defeat.The S.S. Bobby,
a colorful and sturdy-looking boat
named after a goldfish that was in turn
named after Hollywood chessmaster
Bobby Fischer, buckled and took on water as soon as the first of threecrew members placed her weight on it. After several attempts to salvage the craft, the disconsolate team headed back to shore and
shivered as the rest of the boats awaited
the call to begin.

Remaining were five boats. The Society of Women Engineers' SWEet Boat
took an early lead. Pieced together from
large, squarish slabs of styrofoam, the
boat didn't look either sturdy or aerodynamic, but it sure did speed across the
water, powered by an energetic cadre of
pulling and pushing women. Close behind was Kenny, a contraption which
looked to be made of two sleds tied together with rope, one trailing the other
and each filled with empty plastic bottles
and encapsulated in cellophane. It was
really sleek and stylish looking, considering its mundane components. In third
were Helen's Angels with a boat made of
a rough-hewn bucketand a tarp. The most
interesting boats were, of course, last.
Behind Helen's Angels was The Drunken
Stupor. Someone had to make a boat
made of beer kegs. Trailing all the rest
was Big Brunhilda the Breakfast Boat. It
was weighed down not only by its enormous name, but also a whole frame and
mattress from an extra-long twin bed. The
team, pajama-clad, quickly dispensed of
the mattress and floated solely on the recycling containers on the bottom of the
Breakfast Boat.
All the teams pushed hard, and the fiftyor-so spectators sometimes had to run
along the bank to keep at the fore. The
SWEet Boat lost ground to the boats be-

hind it, and for most of the race, the first
three boats seemed equally likely to win
the day. After a long struggle, Kenny beat
the others to the finish line, with Helen's
Angels and their tarp boat in second, and
the Society ofWomen Engineers boat close
behind. After a bit of a wait, The Drunken
Stupor made its way to the end, and after a
much longer wait, the waterlogged Breakfast Bed was pushed, pulled, and prodded
to the finish.
Kenny won theLeif Erickson award, "be-

won the Special Captain's Prize for las.t

THEATER REVIEW

Night of Scenes Evokes Diverse Emotions

by Gabe dimming
In fourth grade, Talia Weiner acted the role of a She-Beaver in a school play. Yes, that's right, a She-Beaver. In her
fourth grade year, Sarah Scheckter made her acting debut
as Spring (the season). As early as third grade Corey DatzGreenburg was performing the role of White Blood Cell.
What destinies awaited these three young thespians, each
of whom had burst into the theater world with such auspicious debuts? As fate would have it, She-Beaver, Spring,
and White Blood Cell (who are still known to the general
public by these stage names) are each directing a scene in
the Drama Board's Spring '9B Night of Scenes.
The challenge of directing and performing a one-act is
that the subject matter needs to be simple, yet interesting.
The short, truncated quality of the medium makes it necessary to perform a piece that stands on its own, both in terms
of comprehensibility and entertainment value. In this sense,
She-Beaver's play is the best suited for the purpose. SheBeaver directs English Made Simple, by David Ives. The
scene consists initially of a very mundane interchange between two people
played by Matt Richey and Cathy
Muller
who encounter one another at a party. This interchange then gets repeated and manipulated under the direction ofThe Announcer, played by the offstage voice of Will

Quale.
The Announcer dissects the conversation linguistically,
providing us with the true subtext of each superficial comment. He then, like a laboratory scientist, alters some variable of the scene, and makes the actors perform it again
under changed circumstances. The results are hilarious and
often absurd. In one scenario, the mild interchange is revealed to be a mask for violent hatred between the two individuals; in another, the two party-goers theorize the very
meaninglessness of their conversation while they are having it. The humor of the piece derives partly from its familwe've all been engaged in superfluous social iniarity
teraction, and seeing it parodied is funny. Such familiarity,
however, also lends the scene a touch of meaningful poignancy. Richey, Muller, and Quale provide what is possibly the evening's best acting, each delivering a crisp, ap-

proachable performance.
While English Made Simple is effective and self-sufficient as a one-act, it is admittedly something of a trifle.
The two scenes that follow delve into material with
greater complexity; consequently, both their emotional
impact and the difficulties they face are greater. Mournful fiddle music signals the stark transitionbetween the
frolicsome English Made Simple and Bent, written by
Martin Sherman and directed by White Blood Cell. Bent
is set in a concentration camp during the Holocaust, and
concerns the interactions between two homosexual men.
Perhaps "interactions" is too strong a term. In the dehumanizing environment of the camp, the two carry on
conversations without being able to approach or even
physically acknowledge each other. Though the two men
care for each other, their feelings are muffled and crushed
under the weight of the torture they endure and their
resulting inner conflicts. Obviously, this is a deeply sad
piece, and convincingly portraying sadness is much more
difficult than being funny. For the most part, however,
actors Sean Brennan and Yura Shubin effectively convey sadness, and as a result the scene has a particularly
haunting resonance. Brennan plays Horst, a victim of
his own powerful, conflicting tendencies: self-sufficiency versus dependence, and toward love versus hostility. Shubin's Max is the most heart-wrenching character, however; his own inability to express his emotions prevents him from acknowledging his feelings until
it is too late. The dialogue takes place while the two are
carrying heavy rocks back and forth between two piles.
The futility and rigor of this exercise underlines the
struggle faced by the characters. Bent works best when
thecharacters are addressing their powerful internal conflicts; it drags a bit when they discuss events beyond
the scope of the scene itself.
English Made Simple was light and happy; Bent was
heavy and sad. The third scene The Ping Pong Players, written by William Saroyan and directed by Spring
—

doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be happy
or sad; in this way, it's the most complex of the three.
"Fun? Are we having fun?" asks George (played by
Cameron McGlothlin), and the question seems to apply to the scene as a whole. The scene consists of'a
convolutedconversation between a well-dressed man;
George, and his wife, Anne (played by Mary Jean
with a brief and rather confusing appearChun)
ance by Anne's mother, Mildred (played by Amy.
Rhodes). Confusion continues to reign as George and
Anne get in a fight

Will Mackintosh said, "There was unity between the
scenes.... It was all about relationships and communicating." According to Spring, Cell, and She-Beaver, with whom I spoke after the show, the directing
experience is also all about the challenges of communication. Directing, said Cell, is finding "ways of motivating people.... [You have to] design a system not
for making people do it, but to get them to do it for
themselves." In other words, the director's job is to
make it possible for the actors to slip into their character roles. Cell terms it "the creation of psychology."
When it works, said Spring, the feeling is wonderful:
"Wow! I helped these people create these characters
which became real to them for a time!"
She-Beaver, Cell, and Spring have succeeded; the
characters do seem to be real for the actors, and promise to be real for the audience as well. And if that's
not enough, The Ping-Pong Players features a rowdy
ping-pong-ball fight, and as Mackintosh notes, "it's
really fucking fun to throw ping-pong balls!"

perch as box office leader. If it is remembered as anything other than that, I'll be
concerned, because Lost In Space is a
glitzy, over-hyped turd.
The year is 2058, and Earth's resources
are getting hopelessly depleted, so the
Robinson family (William Hurt, Mimi
Rodgers, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert,
and Jack Johnson) are sent into deep space
in search of an acceptable planet for human habitation. They're accompanied by
a pilot (Matt Leßlanc) and an evil stowaway, played by Gary Oldman. During
their adventure, of course, they encounter
various alien creatures and faraway worlds.
Lost In Space is based on the '6os TV
show ofthe same name. I think the attempt
was" for something like Batman
a dark
update on a cheesy TV show. But whereas
Tim Burton's Batman is unique in look and
feel; Lost In Space is a rip-off of every notable sci-fi movie ofthe past 20 years, and
the rip-offs are artless and obvious. Plus,
not many people remember Lost In Space,
and not many of those who do remember
it remember it fondly.
The only thing that impressed me about
Lost In Space was the sheer enormity of
the production. Every set, designed by production design master Norman Garwood,
is immense and convincingly futuristic.
The costumes look good, and the producers did a tremendous job of spending lots
of money to create a world.
Unfortunately, they filled that world with
two.things I can't stand: Terrible writing
and bad special effects.
Lost In Space was written by Akiva
Goldsman, who is responsible for Batman
& Robin, which is quite simply one ofthe
worst movies ever. Goldsman's dialogue
is unmistakable; it's filled with substanceless one-liners that interrupt the flow and
tone ofthe movie. Also, the plot is overly
complicated and derivative, and his writing relegates the characters to stupid caricatures; I felt sorry watching William Hurt
and Gary Oldman be pushed around by a

lousy script.
Moreover, almost every frame ofLost In
Space contains a special effect. About 25%
of them are effective, and the rest of them
are astonishingly sub-par. I've heard that
the.budget on this movie was something
like $9O million, and I'm amazed that that
much money couldn't buy better effects.
In particular, the spaceship effects lack
definition and look like video games, and
the creature effects, all done by computer,
are patently fake. It's easy to tell that the
actors are reacting to nothing.
Part of the function ofLost In Space, it
seems, is to pave the way for a sequel. If
this movie continues to be successful, I'm
sure that the second big-screen adventure
for the Robinsons is on its way. I would
love to hold out hope that it will be better
than this, but I have a feeling it will be even
more Lost than its predecessor.

Frito-Lay Study: Olestra Causes "Anal Oil Leakage"
CSPI Press Release
In documents marked "Confidential
and Proprietary," Frito-Lay admits that
olestra caused "anal oil leakage" in a
study commissioned by the company.
Olestra is the controversial fat substitute marketed by Procter & Gamble.
Last April, Frito-Lay became the first
company to market olestra-containing
chips. It sold a line of "Max" potato
chips and corn chips in three test markets. The Olestra snack chips are now
available everywhere, marketed as fatfree snack chips.
The Frito-Lay report states: "The anal
oil leakage symptoms were observed in
this study (3 to 9% incidence range
above background), as well as other
changes in elimination.... Underwear
spotting was statistically significant in
one of two low level consumer groups
at a 5% incidence above background."
Despite those problems, the authors of

Hurd, (804) 296-0023
or (909) 659-2770.

the report concluded that olestra-containing snacks "should have a high potential
for acceptance in the marketplace."
The Frito-Lay
documents were
obtained by the
Center for Science in the Public
Interest (CSPI), a
nonprofit organization that has
opposed the apAnal Leakage.
proval and use of
olestra. In addition to the "elimination
changes," Frito-Lay reported that people
who consume 12ounces ormore ofolestra
chips a week "may experience a greater
variety of gastrointestinal changes (up to
a 7% incidence)."
Twelve ounces is equivalent to six average 2-ounce servings of chips, according
to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
Those higher-level consumers experienced
diarrhea, cramps, loose stools, nausea,

underwear spotting, and other symptoms.
All ofthose symptoms have been reported
by numerous consumers in the four test
markets for Frito-Lay's and Procter &
Gamble's olestra snacks. People who ate
less olestra experienced certain symptoms, but at lower rates.
A confidential Frito-Lay memo dated
August 4, 1995, expressed concern that
people would be particularly aware of
digestive problems thefirst few times they
ate olestra snacks. "There is a potential
for this phenomena to affect general product acceptance." An August 12, 1995,,
confidential memo reported that the company had developed a "risk management
plan.... to manage public perception of
[olestra-jrelated digestion issues, and to
effectively handle any real issues that
might emerge through the [olestra] market introduction."
The Frito-Lay report is significant because Procter & Gamble has argued
strenuously that the additive does not

cause "anal leakage." The Food and Drug
Administration agreed even though CSPI
had provided statistical analyses indicating that anal leakage occurred in Procter
& Gamble's own controlled studies.
In a letter to CSPI executive director
Michael F. Jacobson earlier this year,
Frito-Lay vice president Philip J. Pifer
said that his company had not submitted
the results of its study to the FDA because
major shortcomings in it "made it impossible to reach any valid conclusions or
judgments."
Pifer refused to provide CSPI with any
details about the research, including additional data. The Frito-Lay report does
not acknowledge that the study had any
shortcomings. Jacobson wrote yesterday
to FDA commissioner David Kessler that,
"We suspect that if the shortcomings were
so serious the company would not have
devoted more than a year to preparing a
report and would have described the shortcomings in the report."

Pardus' Advice Corner: Lonely, Lovelorn at Swat
Dear Pardus,
I'm a freshman from New York. My high school was
pretty huge and I never really had a good time. I chose to
come to Swarthmore because I thought it was a small
school so I would easily make friends and be able to have
fun. However, that hasn't happened so far. Sad to say,
I've been totally disillusioned since my arrival on campus. I still don't have a friend that I can hang out with and
people aren't friendly when I try to talk to them. In fact
some people walk away from me. I'm very frustrated
what should I do?
Dear Freshman from New York,
I sympathize with you, but worry and frustration will
get you nowhere. Here is what I think you can do: Set
yourself small goals in socializing. Swat is an intense
place where people can get so stressed out that they become unfriendly at times. Say "hi" to the next student
you see who does not appear to be in a hurry to go somewhere. The next time you see that person, say hello again,
and ask how he/she is. Taking a risk like that is not going

and share dinner with him/her. Don't be too friendly with
the person since you do not really know him /her. That is
a turn off! Also, think about how you approach people.
Are you really loud in greeting? Do you try to walk too
close? (Ouch, sorry for that, but it had to be said). If you
do such things, try to change a little bit. I am not offering
you an automatic solution, but if you try out my suggestions, maybe you'll make a new friend.
Dear Pardus,
I'm a sophomore who's caught in a relationship with
two people at once. The main problem is that I don't how
to choose between them. I'm in love with both girls, but
for different reasons. The first girl goes to Bryn Mawr,
and she's interested in the same things as me, like jazz
and drama. She's also fun to talk to, but I hardly ever see
her because she doesn't come to Swarthmore very often.
The second girl is a Swattie. She doesn't share most of
my interests, but she's still really great to talk to, and she

I told her now that I was already dating someone. Please
help!
Dear Caught Between a Martyr and a Swattie,
I am sure that you realize now that you goofed when
you told the Swattie about your feelings when you are
still hung on the Bryn Mawr lady. The way things stand
now, you might lose both ladies if you do not play your
cards right. I believe long-distance relationships are difficult but not impossible to maintain.
In this case, however, you seem to want a partner you
can hang out with all the time and that is not fair to the
Bryn Mawr girl. Tell her about your difficulty with the
distance separation in a tactful way and explain to her why
you think that the two of you probably shouldn't continue
dating. Tell the Swattie about your naughty behavior too.
Since she dropped someone for you she might forgive you.
Good luck.

Defense Still Needs Work

Softball, Team
hangs on for
2-4 Week

By Noam Unger

By Jean Quinn
The softball team had a full
schedule, packing six important
games into a four day span. The
Garnet dropped two games to Conference for Dickinson (4-5, 0-20)
before splitting doubleheaders with
(8-11,
11-10) and
Drew

Muhlenberg (1-3, 4-3). This
week's contests brings the team's
record to 5-15 overall, 1-7 in the

Centennial conference.
The team suffered a horrible blow
the day before the flurry of games
began when back-up catcher and
key designated hitter Maureen
Vernon 'Ol broke her ankle, sliding into third base at practice.
Vernon's injury, exactly one week
after Amy White 'OO broke her
ankle on the same drill, left the team
with only 11 players.
The team refused to buckle under the trying circumstances, and
nearly won its first game against the
Red Devils from Dickinson before
a one run lead slipped away in the
bottom of the seventh inning.
Heather Marandola 'Ol paced the
squad with 3 hits, including 2
doubles, and 2 RBIs while Portia
Kelly 'Ol added two singles. In the
second game, the Devils jumped on
pitcher Kate Fama 'Ol and the Garnet could not find the bats to retaliate: Kelly singled and Jean Quinn
'99 doubled in the shut-out.
The next day's contests against
Drew both went into extra innings
with the International Tie-breaker
rule in effect in the eighth: each
team started with a runner on second base. Drew put together some
key bunts and hits to knock in 3
runs, while Swat was unable to
push more runs across the plate.
Kelly, Lurah Hess '99, Deirdre
Downey 'Ol, and Michelle Walsh
'9B anchored the offense with multiple hits.
In the second game, the team rebounded from a 7-0 deficit. Hess,
Quinn, Walsh, Mary Beth Alvarez
'9B, and Dana Lehman '9B all had
multiple hits. Lehman, who picked
up the win and drove in the winning run, said, "The team really
came together and worked as a unit.
When someone didn't come up
with a hit or a play, the next person
picked them up. We were due for a
victory and we definitely earned
this one."
In the first game of the
Muhlenberg
double-header,
Lehman gave up only 5 hits. All
three of the Mules' runs were unearned. Marandolaand Quinn each
got on base twice in the outing, and
Alvarez accounted for the team's
only run. The second game was a
great display of the team'sstrength,
character, and skills. Walsh,
Marandola, and Alvarez were hot
from behind the plate picking up
multiple hits. A perfectly executed
delayed-steal on Marandola's part
in the middle of the game exemplified the heart and spirit of the whole
team.

"Dana has been pitching very
well, and our defense is starting to
rise to the challenge. Everybody is
contributing in each game, whether
it be with a timely hit or a sacrifice
bunt. We're finally starting to get
the job done," commented Walsh.

Coach Cheri Goetcheus said,
"The Drew series was a turning
point in our season as the team really came together. We know we
can play withthe best of teams and
we can now dig deep enough to
win. We know as a group that we
need to pull together and play all
out, especially after losing two key
players to injuries. Lehman and
Alvarez are a tough battery to hit
off, and the line-up can light it up
offensively all the way through!"
Swat returns to action Saturday
with a double-header against
Franklin and Marshall at 1 p.m. and
takes the field Tuesday at 3 p.m. for
a series with the Bears from
Ursinus.

Baseball Strikes Out
Garnet Suffers Three Losses in a Row,
Demolished by Hopkins 20-0
by Patricia Barrientos
Past the midpoint of the season,
the Swarthmore baseball find themselves in the bottom halfof the conference standings. There are no
hopes of winning the conference,
but that does not mean that the
games should be handed over to the
opponent without a fight. The Garnet still has talent and when they
play as a team, they can win games.
The 1998 team is still a young
group learning college baseball and
once they come together to make
plays, they can put pressure on the
other team. They can look toward
next season but there are 12 games
left. The Garnet can still turn
around their game and show
glimpses of good baseball.
Last weekend, the Garnet
matched up against the conference
leader, Johns Hopkins. With the
rotation set for the season, the Garnet sent Josh Roth '99 and Jay

Schembs 'Ol to the mound. The
first game of the doubleheader was
all Roth. He provided strong pitching, the major hits in the game, two
triples, and scored both Swarthmore runs. Roth allowed 4 runs on
8 hits with 4 strikeouts and 2 walks.
Dan Johnston '9B, Carlo Fitti 'OO,
Josh Lindsey 'Ol, and Brian Lopez
'OO also had hits in the game. The
Garnet looked like a team that
could play on the same level as any
other team in the conference. They
were playing the best team and
fought to not to justhand over a win
to Hopkins finishing with a 2-4
loss.
Somehow the momentum of the
previous game did not carry over
into the second game. In the first
inning Johns Hopkins scored 5
runs. The bleeding did not stop as
the Garnet faced another defeat.
Not only did Johns Hopkins continued to build their lead, but they
were also not giving up any runs.

The Garnet did have opportunities. They had the bases loaded
with one out in the third inning
yet they did not score. In fact the
offense was limited to two hits as
Johns Hopkins went on to win 200. Schembs pitched 3 1/3 innings.
He did not have control of his
pitches and was hurt by the various walks and wild pitches. Dave
Giles '9B pitched the final innings.
The Garnet lost Franklin and
Marshall on Tuesday 4-1. They
got a strong pitching performance
from Steve Farneth 'OO, who gave
up 4 runs on 7 hits. Unfortunately,
he did not receive much run support as the Garnet only managed
to score once. Rob Castellucci
'Ol provided much of the offense
with 3 hits and knocked in the
lone run in the sth inning.
Johnston, Andrew Lund '99, and
Jose Villavicencio '99 also had
hits. The Garnetface Franklin and
Marshall again this Friday.

The Earthworms traveled to Penn
State this past weekend to play in
one of the largest spring college
tournaments in the country. Most
of the men's team traveled to PSU
on Friday evening to get a good
night's rest before the 30-team
men's tournament began early Saturday morning. Sophomores
Benson Wilder and Noam Unger,
who stayed at Swarthmore Friday
evening to perform in a 60 Improv
Comedy show, joined the team Saturday morning in time for the beginning of tournament play.
Ranked second in their pool, the
Earthworms came out strong against
fourth seed SUNY Albany. With
remarkable offense, the men beat
their first opponent in a 9-6 decision.
Next they played Drew, the last
ranked team in the pool, and despite
a faltering defense, the Earthworms
garnered a 13-6 win against the fun
Drew squad. Since their appetites
were increasing as much as their
sunburns, the earthworms snacked
on sandwiches before facing third
ranked Syracuse. In a hard fought
game, Syracuse edged the Earthworms out for the 13-10 win. Although Swarthmore's defense improved when it switched from man
to zone, it could not hold off the
Syracuse Scooby Doom. In their final game of the day, Swarthmore
faced first seeded U. Mass and lost
13-4, despite the vigorous spirit
shown by Vinnie "Mad Dog"
Pallaver 'OO and Robin "I'm losing
my voice" Mandel '97.
After the men cheered on the
Warmother's play during their last
round bye, the whole Swarthmore
crew scrubbed off the dirt, blood,
and sweat of the day. Then all attended the dinner/party for the fifty
teams at the tournament. Having
downed piles oflasagna and guzzled
troughs of birch beer, the team re-

turned leaving only Capt. Dave
Sacker '97, Bob Yang '97, Aaron
Hoffman '9B, and Noam Unger '99
to enjoy the wonderful funk band
playing into the night.
Losing an hour of sleep and faking up ridiculously early on Sunday, the Earthwormsreturned to the
fields to discover that they thad
gained a first round bye. After
watching halfof the women's game
against Penn State's Isis, the men
warmed up to play Salisbury State.
Having thoroughly beaten the
Salisbury Buzz only two weegame
with a lax attitude which allowed
their opponent to secure a lead. Despite increasing intensity, the
women's support, and beautifully
flowing offense as the game progressed, Swarthmore's team could
not stop Salisbury's long-range offense. The game left Capt. Sasha
Clayton '9B wondering, "What do
these guys eat, and where can I get
some?" Their 13-10 loss to
Salisbury ended the Earthworm's
share of tournament play.
All twelve men at the tournament
played very well. Sacker and
Clayton played with their usual
captainly finesse and ego-shattering cuts. Mickey Morton '97 and
Mandel also handled on offense,
and each had a number of defensive blocks and interceptions.
Pallaver continued to astound the
more experienced players with his
natural skill and determination
coupled with his ever-so-pleasing
wit. Senior Dave Lewis pulled his
by-now common trick of scoring
many... many times. Yang,
Hoffman, Sibley, Unger, Wilder,
and Roger Bock '99 all played
tough offense, providing the handlers with open cuts to throw to in
the middle of the field as well as
the end zone. With it's liquid offense and soon to be improved defense, the Earthworms are definitely a team to watch.

Women's Rugby Leaves Warmothers Shut Out Penn
Opponents Scoreless State, Ranked 20th Nationally
by Amber Halsey,
Danielle Thomas,
and Rhiana Swartz
Ruggerfest '9B

The Swat

team, excited to catch the sunrise
over the Washington Monument,
left campus at 5:00 a.m. with a
glimmer in their eyes and a spring
in their steps. The team practically
cried with joy as the rain began to

pour down five minutes before they
took the field against Eno River, a
club team from North Carolina.
The bad news is that they tied; the
good news is, the score was 0-0.
It was wet, it was scary, it went
into overtime. Although the Swat
team maintained possession of the
ball for the majority of the game,
they were still not able to muster
the strength needed to make it to the
tryzone. At the end of regulation,
the score was still 0-0. Although
Swarthmore was inches from scoring at the whistle, they were forced
to give up possession and scurry
back to the fifty yard line for a kick
off. After 10minutes of overtime, it
was still wet and scary, and still 0-0,
so the ref called for a penalty kick
off. Although the game was recorded as a tie, the kick off was
awarded to Eno River, and they advanced over Swarthmore.
The Swarthmore Women ruggers
played again thatafternoon against
Boston College. It was obvious that
Swarthmore felt a lot better about
this game when the ref blew the
whistle and the score was 34-0
(they think). Erica Anderson 'Ol,
in her a-side debut, scored the first
try of the game in the first 5 minutes of play. That began the chain
reaction of tries which character-

ized the rest of the game. Anderson
managed to pick up another try later
in the game with the same energy
and hutzpah as the first. Charity
Miller '9B, got jiggy wit' it in the
tryzone with a pass from captain Sarah Cross '99 after she left Boston
College in the mud. Danielle Thomas '99 outsmarted her opponents,
scoring two consecutive tries, the
first of which being her first A-side
try. Bringing up the end of the alphabet was Beth Wiles '9B, who not
only successfully kicked two conversions, but plowed through the
feeble Boston team to score her first
A-side try as well.
Sunday's game number three was
nothing short of beautiful. Swarthmore took the field against George
Washington University with something to prove, and prove they did.
The final score was 18-0. No, the
stellar Swarthmore squad still has
not been scored upon. Although
tired and worn out from the prior
long day, Swat managed to dominate GW absolutely. The back line
gained yardage continuously, and
the forwards rolled over their opponents. The first try of the game was
won by Cristina Costas-Russell '99
in an act of pure aggression. Swat
continued to turn it on in the second half. A penalty kick was kicked
by Rhiana Swartz 'OO for 3 and
Amber Halsey '9B hooked Swartz
up with an impeccable and now infamous "1" for Swat's second try.
In the last minutes of play, Danielle
Thomas '99 swept the rest of the
pitch with GW as she touched the
ball down for Swat's final 5.
Come watch Swat's seniors this
Saturday, as they take on Bryn
Mawr/Haverford at 1:00.

by Lindsay Goldsmith
and Mandy Hourihan
The Warmothers have returned
from a successful weekend of playing at Penn State's Spring Phling
tournament. The games were dominated by both zone offense and defense. Despite our small numbers
(only 2 subs on Saturday and 1 on
Sunday) the Warmoms came out
strong on Saturday with yet another
shutout against Penn State (13-0).
Highlights of this game included
Annie Bacon's '99 amazing popper
cuts that ripped up the defense's
cup. Our second game was against
the nationally renowned team Calamity Jane from Indiana University. Despite a valiant attempt, we
lost 13-10. We ended the day by rebounding to beatRochester University (103). The catch of the game

was an outstanding endzone grab by
Anna Sugden-Newbery '99. We
ranked fourth of 13 teams to start
Sunday's elimination rounds. Two
powerful connections developed on
the field on Saturday. Firstly, our terrific trio, Carrie Bader '99, Leslianne
Yen '9B and Jenny Hoedeman 'Ol
tore through all of our opponents
zones with fantastic upfield flow.
Endzone play was dominated by a hot
connection from Lindsay Goldsmith
'Ol to Mandy Hourihan '9B that accounted for about half of the total
points we scored all weekend.
After disabling our fourth vehicle
of the semester and thereby making a
grand exit from the party, the
Warmothers returned for Sunday's
eliminationrounds. Our opening win
against Columbia University (9-6)
warmed us up for our toughest game,
the semifinals against Yale (ranked

fourth nationally). With an elating
score, upwind first point, we letYale
know that it would be no easy game.
Yale's strong skills kept up on our
toes and really made our zone work.
Excellent defense by Gabi KruksWisner '99 kept our zone together
and saved us many fast breaks. Offensively, Mina Kim's '9B mid cuts
kept the flow moving downfield, essential against a team ofYale's caliber. Despite the 15-8 loss, the
Warmother's were pleased with
play. This weekend theWarmother's
proved both to ourselves and to rival
teams that our national ranking is
well deserved. Rising to the 20th slot
as of Tuesday's rankings, the
Warmothers now only place behind
big universities with the exception
of Carleton, the only school in the
country at which Ultimate is a varsity sport.

Women's Tennis Falls to F&M, Beats
Out Bryn Mawr; Men Lose to Williams
By Laurie Smith
The women's tennis team made
up for their loss to Franklin and
Marshall on Friday when they won
against Bryn Mawr 7-2 yesterday.
The singles players from #1 to #6
were Jennifer Pao 'Ol (6-1, 6-0),
Rani Shankar '9B (7-5,6-1), Krista
Hollis 'Ol (6-3,6-4), Wendy Kemp
'99 (2-6,6-2,6-0), Laura Brown 'OO
(6-1,6-2) and JamieFlather 'OO (46, 6-4, 6-0). Flather went to three
sets in the longest match and played
hard even though her opponent
won.
In doubles, the teams were Pao
and Hollis (8-2), Shankar and
Brown (8-4), and Kemp and Elena
Rosenbaum '9B (4-8). Overall the

Mawrters were a good match and
another win for the team to add to
their list of victories.
The team, though, struggled against
Franklin and Marshall, losing 1-8.
The singles consisted of players Pao,
Shankar, Brown, Flather, and Stacey
Wagaman 'Ol. The doubles teams
were Pao and Hollis, Brown and
Shankar, andFlather and Michaelade
Soucey. Even many difficultmatches
ensued, the only win of the day came
from #1 singles player Pao.
The men's team played Williams
College, the preseason number one
in Division 111 and undefeated going into this match. Both #1 and #2
singles went to tiebreakers, but in to
end Williams came out on top. #2
Nick Slimack 'OO went to three sets;

John Leary 'OO injured his shoulder early on in the match but continued playing and lost in straight
sets.

Greg Emkey '99 also went to three
sets and was down 5-2 in the third
set, but was able to fight his way back
and win. Temin won in straight sets
while Peter Schilla 'Ol lost in the
third set. The final score was 5-2,
but the contest could easily have been
reversed with nearly all of the
matches so close.
Saturday the women will face
Dickinson at home, while the men
will travel to Massachusetts to play
MIT and Amherst. As Schilla 'Ol
says, "A win over one or both teams
should guarantee us a place at
regionals." Regionals will be
