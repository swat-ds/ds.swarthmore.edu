Council-led sit-in at the Board of Managers meeting. Protesters later
moved to a classroom (above), where President Al Bloom and Board
Chairman Nell Austrian announced that the Board had accepted a
Student Council petition demanding more student Involvement In
Swarthmore's decision-making processes. The dialogue continued

Seminar Credit An Issue
Patrick Runkle

Why are science seminars worth
only one credit when all others are
worth two? Students are wondering
why work in different departments
that seems equivalent is not awarded
the same amount of credit.
Robert Pasternack, professor of
chemistry and chair of the Division

ofNatural Sciences and Engineering,
said that there is no official policy
that all science seminars be only one
credit; "it's on a department-by-department basis."
Thomas Stephenson, associate professor and chair of the Chemistry
Department, said, "It's basically a
breadth versus depth issue." The Biology and Physics Department heads
agreed that one-credit seminars satisfy students' desire to take more
courses in their majors while still
being able to take enough courses in

other disciplines.
Rachel Merz, associate professor
and chair of the Biology Department,
suspects that the single-credit seminars arose from "a historical accident." She explained further: "In part
it is connected with the notion that
science is considered to be a more
vertical progression of information
than some other areas. So that for a
student to take a seminar in physiological ecology, that student would
have to have the correct specific back-

ground in physiology, usually by taking a physiology course, and to take
physiology they would have had to
take the appropriate introductory
courses, Bio 1 and Bio 2 So, the
practice used to be that an intermediate level course (e.g. Physiology) was
linked with a particular science seminar (e.g. Physiological Ecology) and
that the pair of them was one Honors
prep equaling two credits. This is in
contrast to some other fields where
capable students could theoretically
enter a seminar after only having had
an introductory course or two." Merz

also noted that there are several
double-credit seminars offeredby the
Biology Department.
Peter Collings, professor and chair
ofthe Physics Department, said, "The
subject matter for the last two years
of die undergraduate physics major
falls more naturally into six to eight
areas rather than three to four areas.
While we did pair them under the old
Honors System to create two-credit
preparations, in some cases these
pairings were pretty artificial. Under
the new system we don't have to do
this, since five seminars and a thesis
are the single preparation for the honors exams."
Merz also thought that the Honors
Program might be an important factor. She said, "Anotherissue is that as
there were fewer honors students in
the sciences, some faculty found it
cumbersome to have a whole seminar required to take the Honors exam
even though there were no Honors
students in the seminar. A way around
this problem was to make it a onecredit seminar that was not obliged to
take part in the Honors exam system."

Stephenson said that while the
Honors system may have had some
bearing on the decision in the past,
this no longer applies with the new
Honors system in place.
Stephenson gave a historical perspective, saying that chemistry seminars 20 years ago were double-credit
courses with eight hours of lab and
four hours of seminar a week. These
seminars were often duplications of
other chemistry classes. The move to
single-credit seminars without lab
components was intended to give seniors the chance to pursue advanced
topics not addressed by other courses.
Departmental policies might be
subject to change. Merz noted, "It
might be interesting for this to be a
topic of consideration during the
College's long-term planning process."

The Board of Managers last weekend approved the parameters for the
College's 1996-97budget which were
recommended by the College Budget
Committee and announced three
weeks ago, President Al Bloom said.
At the meeting, the President affirmed and the Board reaffirmed the
College's commitment to need-blind
admissions and to meeting the full
demonstrated need of each student.
According to Bloom, discussion also
focused on the College'sresponsibility to provide for adequate continuing renovation of its facilities, while
sustaining the excellence of its academic program and meeting student
financial need.
The College long-term planning
process will begin by addressing the
academic program laterthis semester
and extend to broader institutional
issues starting next fall, according to
Bloom. It will last approximately
two years and involve extensive community participation throughout.
A presentation by a subcommittee
on land utilization attempted to show
that, at this point, the College does
not need to acquire more land to
accommodate any new facilities that
might be recommended by the plan-

process.
Bloom said he also told the Board
about the success ofSwarthmore seniors last year in admissions to medical school, the high number of
Swarthmore faculty who received
funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the very
positive results to date of theCollege' s
intense effort to reach a larger and
more diverse constituency in the admissions process.
In addition, President Bloomheld
an open meeting in Parrish Parlors
on Monday evening where students
could air their concerns about financial aid, student participation, and
other issues.
In response to the meeting, Bloom
said, "I deeply appreciated the opportunity for informal, open and constructive discussion with students
over their concerns for better communication and for strengthened student participation in the College's
committee processes.
"As a first step towards enhanced
communication, I hope we can have
meetings of that sort on a regular,
perhaps monthly, basis; and I look
forward to working with the students
to refine and implement several of
the very fine, specific suggestions
that emerged."

About 45 students met with members of the administration on Monday night, at an open meeting facilitated by Student Council. The meeting served as a follow-up to the sit-in
at the recent Board of Managers meeting and the petition, which were also
organized by SC.
"It was a very productive meeting," said Nancy Benson-Nicol '9B,
co-coordinator of SC. "Some solid
plans and suggestions were put forth."
Benson-Nicol opened the meeting
by emphasizing that students do not
want to "overtake the College in student upheaval." She characterizedthe
main goal of the discussion as an
attempt to "increase the lines of
communication...and to learn from
the administration."
President Al Bloom then spoke,
saying, "A lot can be accomplished.
Student representatives have had a
much smaller voice looking at agendas in committees [than faculty
representatives]...and they feel uncomfortable speaking out in meet-

ings."
He went on to say that the relationship between the student representatives and the rest of the student body
needs to be examined, especially in
terms of what information from the
meetings can be shared withthe other
students.
He also brought up two other is-

sues, concerned that they might be
"confounded withthe process issue."
The first was financial aid: he reaffirmed the College's commitment
need-blind admissions. He also
promised to keep up the level ofaid to
meet all demonstrated need.
The second issue was that of minority recruitment. "We need students from a broad spectrum ofsociety," he said, "and all of us at the
College are completely committed to
[bringing them here]. We had extremely goodapplicants ofcolor come
here [to visit] and then decide they
want to go to the Ivies. We need that
extra something to show [them] that
to

they can thrive here."
Jude Uzonwanne '9B, SC member
and Board ofManagers observer, then
mentioned the proposals outlined by
SC: that there be 25% student repre-

sentation on committees, and that
there be "atimely release ofinformation to preserve the spirit of community and the College."
President Bloom responded by
agreeing that more information
should be madeavailable to the community. He cautioned that the issue
of student involvement was a little
more complicated. SC would need to
work with the administration on this
issue on a committee-by-committee
basis, as "we cannot generalize and
pick one number for all the committees." For instance, there is no need
for there to be increased student involvement on the committee that
grants tenure to faculty, but there is a
need for greater student input on the
College Planning Committee.
Seth Harvey '97 brought up the
"four-four-four"proposition that had
been previously rejected by the College; it called for equal representation on all committees among students, faculty members, and administrators. He wondered why consideration was being given to the current
proposal when he believed that there
had been no favorable response for
the previous one. Dean Ngina
Lythcott responded that "this is a
new proposal being heard tonight,"
one that is "more reasonable."

students consider, according to him,
are the visibility of the college, the
quality of the academic facilities, the
breadth of the academic program,
and the size of the community. He
also mentioned the various problems
that arise from using financial aid
packages as a lure for minority applicants: do we offer more money to
students of color than to white students? Do we offer them money even
if they do not need it to ensure that

they matriculate?
President Bloom reiterated the
College'scommitment to enroll more
students of color. The College has
hired Mark Edwards (whose company focuses on how to promote images of institutions) to analyze the
situation and propose new methods
to attract more students of color to

Swarthmore.
William Nessly '99 then turned the
discussion back onto the issue of student involvement. He said that while
increased student participation and
training will allow for more effective
representation, the community as a
whole still needs to be better informed.
GiridharSrinivasan '9B suggested that
any information presented to SC also
be presented to the general community (for instance, approved minutes
from committee meetings).

Gerardo Aquino' 96 then suggested

President Bloom statedthat he had

that student representatives on committees receive some sort of training
so that they would understand the
terms and concepts being used and
discussed at meetings. "I had no clue
what was going on sometimes," he
said of the College Budget Committee, to which he belonged last year.
Another student suggested that the
College set up an internship program
over the summer to give students the
training they need to be more in-

no resistance to the idea, but that it is
a question of finding someone with
the time and energy to organize the
operation. He agreed that it would be
a good idea, for instance, to have the
CBC come to the community early in
the process to present the goals and
plans under consideration.
Justin Hall '97 then suggested that
all this information be placed on the
Internet, where it would be readily
accessible to anyone who wished to
examine it. "It's the best way to make

Brenda Ayers '97 changed the direction ofthe discussion byreturning

this possible," he said.
Robert Harris '96 returned to the
subject of minority enrollment, say-

enrollment and financial aid. She felt
thatthe changes in financial aid policy
would prevent more minorities from
enrolling at the College.
President B loom disagreed, saying

ing that he hoped that "the sudden
interest [in the enrollment of students
of color] is genuine and sincere." SC

purpose by bringing this issue up, he

colleges and universities had just
about given up on inner-city public
schools and their applicants. President Bloom replied that Swarthmore
has not done so, and introduced admissions officer Jim Bock, who
helped answer the question.
Bock explained thatthe admissions
staff has visited more schools this
year than ever before, and that it is
trying to visit more inner-city schools
with high minority populations, such
as those in Detroit and Washington,
D.C.
Vincent Jones '9B agreed that admissions has done a good job of encouraging more students of color to
apply. President Bloom said, "We
accepted them, and they didn't
We need to figure out what
the problem is."
Claudia Munoz '99 then brought
up the relationship between financial
aid and international students. President Bloom said that when it comes
to international students, financial aid
is limited (only 10% of the financial
aid budget is allotted to non-U.S.
nationals).
Thus, international students are
accepted on a need-conscious basis,

meaning that financial need is taken
into consideration. The reason is that
the College feels that it is not where
it would like to be in terms of fully
representing the American population. Until it accomplishes that goal,
it will focus on the needs of American students over those of international students.
The meeting ended with President
Bloom calling on SC to work on three
ofthe goals set: first, to set up a series
of similar meetings on a regular basis, perhaps having the agenda decided by the campus through a poll.
SC is also to work with the administration to decide how student representation on various committees will
be increased.
Finally, SC is to develop a way of
communicating information from the

different committees to the student
body.
"It was a productive meeting," said
Srinivasan. "I hope that Council and
the administration honor the commitments they' ve made to the student
body, the Board of Managers, the
faculty and the whole community."

"Where Is The Juice?"
Erich Carr Everbach
By Tony

Sturm

The recent absence ofbottled juices
at Essie Mae's has struck a chord
with many students. According to

Marie Dalton, cash operations manager, the distributors are the ones at
fault for the absence of many popular
flavors.
An inventory of the drinks available last week revealed an impressive variety of drinks, which unfortunately were not too impressive from
a health standpoint. There were six
types of iced tea, three types of lemonade, six types of fruit "drinks" or
"cocktails," and fifteen types ofsoda.
Aside from Diet Snapple and the diet
sodas, every one of these drinks had
"high fructose corn syrup" or "fructose" listed above all other ingredients except water. Thus studentshave
been missing out on more than just
the famous quotes and useless facts
(including "Did you know that Nantucket is the only place in the United
states that has the same name for a
city, a county, and an island?") imprinted on the bottle caps of Nantucket Nectars Wood Pressed Apple
Juice (not from concentrate) or a bottle
of Elliott's Amazing juices.

Ridge's
Orange
Passionfruit., the beverage with the
highest percentage of juice found on
that particular day was only 20%
juice, a far cry from the pure grape,
apple, orange, grapefruit, and mixed
juices previously available.
So what happened to the juices?
L and M, the distributor for Nantucket Nectars, lost the contract to
distribute that product, so there is
currently no local distributor for such
favorites as Savannah Tea, Orange
Mango and Wood-pressed Apple
Juice. "They just lost Nantucket, and
[Nantucket Nectars] hasn't found
someone else to distribute their product," said Dalton.
Elliott's Amazing products can still
be found, but it is a rare occasion
when 100% juice is present. BEI Dis-

tributors, also responsible for such
drinks as Diet Rite, Stewart's Sodas,
and Glacier Ridge, has had trouble
obtaining the more popular varieties
of Elliott's juices.
"I ordered the Elliott's apple and
orange juice that came in on Monday
three weeks ago," Dalton noted. The
demand at Elliott's bottling plant is
apparently too high for the drink
maker to keep up. It has been difficult
for Essie Mae's to obtain the popular
juices. "We are trying," said Dalton.
"One of our biggest problems here
is space," she added. There is not
enough room to store large quantities
of drinks, and that makes it difficult
to maintain a consistent selection,
because when a supplier comes on
Monday, its product must be moved
by Wednesday to make room for that
day's shipment.
"We have 550kids coming through
here at breakfast, and they all grab a
soda," said Dalton. She noted that the
coolers are stocked four times daily,
but the supplies rapidly diminish.
There are options for those who
dislike Mango Madness and
Melonberry and want something with
natural coloring. Juices are available
in the juice dispenser. Orange juice,
Pass-O-Guava, grape juice,and cranberry juice can be purchased. One
benefit of the dispenser juices is that
when they are accidentally kicked
over in lecture, they don't make the
loud clanking noises that Snapple
bottles do.
Other drinks available at Tarble
include the dispenser sodas, dispenser
milk and cartons of milk. There is
also the Flying Fruit Fantasy, a concoction of many fruit-like flavors
which was has been described as "a
cross between a slushie and a
milkshake with an overwhelming
banana taste."
It remains to be seen whetherNantucket Nectars will find a new distributor in the area and whether
Elliott's will once again be able to
fulfill Swatties' beverage cravings.

ment. Dean Hargadon sent letters to several SASS members

implying that he wished they had never been admitted.
On December 23, SASS sent President Smith a list of
demands, stating that unless they were publicly accepted by
Tuesday, January 7, "the black students and SASS will be
forced to do whatever is necessary to obtain acceptance of
same." These demands were that the college accept and enroll
10-20 "risk" black students during the next year and provide
support programs for them.
The list also included a commitment to an enrollmont of
100 black students withinthree years and 150 in six years, the
appointment of a black Assistant Dean of Admissions and a
black administrator, and Hargadon's replacement unless
admissions policies changed.
On January 7, the demands had not been accepted. However, Smith called a special faculty meeting, and announced
that faculty meetings would be held weekly until the issue had
been decided.
Faculty members announced that they saw no great differences between these demands and the recommendations of
the Admissions Committee, but that they would use the SASS
demands as a framework for these meetings.
The following day, SASS members burned the College in
effigy on Sharpies Patio, "symbolizing the destruction ofpart
of the old Swarthmore to enable the future to be built on a
better foundation," denouncing the failure of faculty and
administration to accept their demands.
At 12:15 p.m. on Thursday January 9, members of SASS
occupied the Admissions Office. They taped black paper to
the windows, locked the doors, and asked the admissions
officials to leave. At 2:15, they called a press conference in
the College Commons (now the CRC). They presented their
earlier demand, adding the demands that blacks be included
and that no disciplinary action be taken against them.
Several hundred students met in a session in Clothier Hall
that evening. They endorsed the SASS demands, and asked
the faculty to postpone all academics for two days.
About 100 students walked out of the meeting to plan more
radical action, agreeing to endorse the SASS takeover of the
Admissions Office. The faculty met in an emergency meeting
in Martin, postponing all classes until Monday, and inviting
SASS representatives to meet with them.
Student and faculty meetings continued throughout Friday
and the weekend, while SASS members issued statements
about the philosophy of education at Swarthmore, and its
relation to the needs of the outside world.
The faculty met until 3:30 a.m., passing resolutions about

In

January of 1969, a group of students
took over the admissions office, sparking
a week ofcanceled classes, lengthy dailymeetings of the
faculty and student body, hunger strikes, and daily Phoenix
supplements—all culminating in the death of a college president.
With the recent talk on campus of sit-ins, student protest,
and students' role in the decision making process on campus,
it seems appropriate to look back on this time.
The Fall of 1968 began with College President Courtney
Smith's announcement that he would leave Swarthmore at
the end of the year. Phoenix issues from that era are full of the
concerns of the era: reports from that summer's Democratic
Convention in Chicago; debate over naval recruisters on
campus; a report on SPAC's picketing of the local Acme
Supermarket; "the sex rule" (it was prohibited); SAC's rulings on pets in College dorm rooms; and whether the admissions office should continue to bar students with beards from
becoming tour guides.
But the admissions office was in the midst of greater
controversy. A working paper about recruiting and enrolling
black students had been released to the College community.
Among other recommendations, the paper suggested admitting a few "risk" students each year to boost the number of
black students on campus, and it included an appendix of
statistics about the current black students.
In October, SASS staged a walk-out of the Admissions
Policy Committee, urging that the report be rewritten. Its
members argued that they should have been involved in the
writing of the report, that releasing the data attached to the
report was a violation of their right to privacy, and that the
such as the phrase "military separatist inclinations"—which
were being treated as fact.
That November, Student Council endorsed four demands
made by SASS: that the report be removed from circulation
in McCabe, that a Black Interest Committee be formed to
increase campus sensitivity, that a black Assistant Dean of
Admissions be hired, and that the SASS Recruitment Committee work with the College Admissions Committee on the
issue of recruiting and enrolling black students.
Tensions only increased as the semester continued. Clinton
Eldridge, chair ofSASS, said that the lack ofstudent input and
any black administrators, the scarcity of black teachers, and
the lack of a Black Studies Program made some students
question the College's commitment to black student recruit-

the hiring of a black admissions officer and black counselor,
how the College might help gifted black high school students
to become qualified for acceptance to-Swarfhmore, and the
implementation of a Committee on Black Admissions.
Meanwhile, student meetings dealt mostly with the relationship of the current crisis to the larger issue of student

"Sucking on the Teat of Nature:" Remembering Spring Break

Breaks were a great time to discover new
things about friends —the way they slouch
into the driver seat with one hand caressing
the bottom of the wheel, their particular driving music, the stories that slip out when they
get hypnotized by the white line blipping
beneath the car. Some people, it seems, never
fully emerge from themselves until they're
behind the wheel heading home.
And then there were the details of my
friends' homes I might never had known
without visiting: how Sader dinner was celebrated, whatsmells waftup from the kitchen
after restorative nights of sleep, what kind of
toothpaste is bought, or whatbooks are on the
shelves. One summer morning during a weekend visit to a friend's I awoke to the sound of
Dutch being spoken in the kitchen.
Sad but true, Swarthmore campus life sacrifices privacy and individuality in creating
the sense of community so treasured. We all

Next week, many Swarthmore students

they pull out of campus sighing, smiling, and
forgetting about what was just turned out, and
choosing to forget about what's due after
break.

OPINIONS
The Phoenix

Who we are, and what we're trying to do.
Most of the time, we're students. But for a few moments each week—make
that 30 or more hours for some of us—we're journalists.
And when we're journalists, we try hard to be more than students. We'd be
doing a disservice to our readers —including faculty, staff, alumni, parents
and Board members as well as students—if we only presented the "student
point of view." And because the back volumes ofthis newspaper are among
the most thorough, albeit inadequate, historical records Swarthmore has, our
responsibility to the future is to provide an accurate record of events. To do
that, we try to understand the perspectives of everyone in the community.
Unfortunately, as students, it is often hard for us to be unbiased journalists.
Several members of our staff attended Saturday's sit-in outside the Board of
Managers meeting, some as reporters and some as students. Those reporting
felt strong urges to participate in or to condemn the sit-in, while those
participating wanted desperately to write about it. But the reporters couldn't
participate or condemn, and the participants couldn't write, because a participant in an event can rarely give an objective account of it.
The conflicting desires to act and to watch challenge all journalists. It's
especially hard, however, to remain neutral in this community, which values
involvement and participation so highly.
Fortunately, this newspaper—the only publication that reaches everyone
on this campus—does offer some opportunities for participation. We write
editorials, not only to offer our opinions on controversies begun by others, but
also to initiate discussion.
In choosing which stories to write, we seek to produce an image of the
community that is accurate and that will appeal to our readers, but we also
consider the effects our stories will have. Will they unify the College by
giving readers something in common or by allowing them insight into other
people's lives? Or will our articles only interest a few, and merely serve to
fragment the campus?
We try throughout to do what is right for the College as a whole. Our
editorials, for instance, argue not for what students want, but for what we
believe the entire community should want.
Though our lives as students affect what we write, we seek to remain
unbiased and to represent Swarthmore as accurately as possible. It's a high
standard; please hold us to it.

It's time to take security phones campus-wide.
The road to a more secure campus appears full of unexpected turns. Until
recently, Willets and ML were the only dorms equipped with security phones;
in response to student requests, though, Physical Plant has installed phones
outside Palmer, Pittenger and Roberts. Myrt Westphal, directorof residential
life, Ijas approved security phones for Dana, Hallowell, and Mertz as well, a
sign that the College is making greater efforts to provide adequate security on
campus. We applaud the trend.
But the slow pace of change makes us wonder what is keeping the College
from putting in phones campus-wide. Larry Schall, associate vice president
for facilities and services, said installation at PPR followed requests from
residents there. Shouldn't phones be installed even without directrequests?
PPR is locked twenty-four hours a day. But even at on-campus dorms,
which, with the exception ofWillets, are only locked late at night, there would
be clear benefits to installing security phones.
If guests could call theirhosts from outdoors, dormresidents wouldn'tneed
to worry about stranding visitors outside to bang plaintively on locked doors,
and could stop propping doors open with soda cans and similar objects. With
doors held open, both the good- and ill-intentioned can wander into dorms
easily. But since, generally, those with legitimate visiting purposes will have
in mind a specific person whom they can call (knowledge of the number
failing, the Parrish desk will connect them), there seems little potential for
major inconvenience to anyone other than criminals and sundry miscreants.
Moreover, if students outside find themselves in danger, having a means of
alerting campus security quickly (via an emergency button) could be crucial.
There are potential drawbacks, yes, but they fall mostly into the category
of less-than-complete efficiency. Students will prop doors anyway—since it
is easier to leave a door open than to come down to the first floor to open it
when visitors or pizza men arrive—and there are, in theory, times when
student might need to get into dorms even if their potential hosts are not there.
Those situations seem incidental to the larger purpose, though: the stillexisting possibility of theft should not mask the benefits of the reduction of
that possibility—and, clearly, installing phones throughout campus would
accomplish thatend. The potential for less-than-complete success should not
be an excuse for not trying.
While there are problems with the phone plan, superior systems may one
day be incorporated into Swarthmore's security plans. A card system, under
which the same ID cards that now provide access to Sharpies and checkout
privileges at the libraries could regulate entry to College buildings, would be
the ultimate goal; unfortunately, according to Schall, the infrastructure
needed to support this system is just beginning to be installed. While we
support the idea of moving toward that level of security, campus safety is not
an issue that can be put off until the best technology is available.
Granted, security phones cost money; granted, the College has lately been
beset by plenty of demands on its financial resources. But ensuring student
safety should remain among the administration's highest priorities, and when
a logical step that can be taken is relatively simple, it seems more prudent to
ask students not to prop doors than to abandon the idea entirely.

A day at the beach.
Yesterday didn't start off very well. A persistent drizzle turned much of the
campus, especially the as-yet-unlandscaped grounds around Kohlberg Hall,
into mud. Most students had exams to take, or papers to hand in—and relief
wasn't even in sight yet, with more work due today and tomorrow. Lunch in
Sharpies was a daunting prospect, too: visions of long lines and unidentifiable
food danced in our sleep-deprived heads.
When we first heardBob Marley tunes resonating in the dining hall at lunch,
we thought we were hallucinating. Funnel cake and soft pretzels and ice cream
sandwiches—not to mention watermelon and popsicles—seemed too good to
be true. And although we knew that "Treasures of the Sea" was nothing but
Seafood Bar all over again, we didn't mind. We just wanted to sit down in
those big, comfy beach chairs and take a long snooze in the sun.
Thanks, Sharpies. Some students found it slightly hokey, but even so,
Beach Day made our day.

Pondering The Financial Aid Sit-In: Were You There?
By

Aisha Hobbs

Were you there?
Probably not. It was snowy and
wet when I woke up, and even I
almost decided to go back to sleep
after hitting the snooze button at least
a half a dozen times. But I had said I
would be there, so I got up, got dressed
and walked with afriend to theFriends
Meeting House at 9:40 a.m., a rare
occurrence on a Saturday morning
for a stay-abed such as myself.
In my estimation, there were only
about 75 people there, give or take a
few. Bundled in our hats and scarves
and disgruntledness, we sat and
waited for the Board of Managers
meeting to break. We sat in silence.

Some of us made signs, some did
readings for class, and others, like
myself, dozed.
I had read the petition and been
bombarded by signs proclaiming the
importance of diversity. I signed the
petition. I went to the sit-in because
this, however significantly or insignificantly, affects me. Alterations in
financial aid policies make me nervous. They also make me angry.
It is my understanding that this
year our school .made an unprecedented amount of money. It has also
been proposed this year that the proportion of work study and loans be
increased in aid packages. I don't
understand why. I believe that the
Board of Managers should re-evalu-

ate its method of appropriating funds.
In hard times, using only a small
percentage of the yearly returns on
investments made sense to ensure the
future stability ofSwarthmore. However, sitting on a golden egg in time
of plenty is senseless and selfish. The
school has more than enough money
for buildings, financial aid, potato
bars, and art glass. Diversity need not
be compromised if we use the funds
at our disposal, if we make a larger
part of those funds disposable.
I went to the sit-in to show my
support for student action. I went to
make a statement to the board and to
myself. I went because the attitude of
many of the people I talked to about
the sit-in and petition sounded like

this: "I really don'tknow much about
it and don't feel comfortable, supporting something I don't understand." I wanted my existence on this
campus as a recipient offinancial aid
recognized and protected.
I left the sit-in when we were
shepherded into another room during
the break for dialogue. It was organized as a silent sit-in. The power was
in our presence, not our conversation. I left when we let ourselves be
effectively "handled."
This is not to say that our gathering
was in vain. The very existence of the
sit-in meant something. Its ultimate
impact may be ambiguous and uncertain, but the reality of our presence
alone was significant. We were there.

How Should Congress Change The Welfare System?
Improve living conditions; don't punish the poor.

Matthew Howard

and

The Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Act of 1995 was
one of the crown jewels of the Republican "Contract With America."
welfare reform. President Clinton
vetoed it, but his veto has not halted
the attack on public assistance.
While Democrats and Republicans
agree that the American welfare system should be reformed, the shortsighted Republican reform initiatives
will worsen the problems they purport to solve. For example, the Republican plan wouldend Aid to Families With Dependant Children, taking away the right to federal aid. The
dangers of this idea are self-evident.
Therestriction or abolition ofMedicaid, child care and nutrition services
programs would put millions of
single-parent families in need. What
is the justification for this? The Republicans seem to feel that they
can force parents to work by driving
them and their children out of the
welfare program. The principal problem with this plan is that the jobs that
are available to welfare recipients do
not pay enough to support a family.
There is a big gap between minimum
wageand what President Clinton has
called "living wage."This problem is
exacerbated by the fact that many
welfare recipients are single mothers. These mothers must both care for
children and earn enough to support
them. Day care, essentially the only
solution for a single mother who
works, is too expensive for most minimum-wage earners, and leaving the
kids at home unsupervised can get
single mothers jailed for neglect.
So how can we reform the welfare
system in a way that puts people to
work without putting them and their

children in danger? First, we must
realize that most people on welfare
want to work. The average person on
public assistance will tell you that
being on welfare is not a badge of
pride, and that they would love to be
able to support their families without
it. They also realize, though, that if
they got jobs,they and their children
would be worse off than if they remained on welfare.
So it seems that it is not welfare
recipients themselves that need to
change, but the conditions under
which we expect them to work. Instead of cutting people off welfare,
Republicans should be raising the
national minimum wage to a "living
wage." They should be allotting funding for government-sponsored day
care programs, so that single working parents would have free child
care. Perhaps most importantly, getting a job should not necessarily mean
the end ofpublic assistance. If we cut
off people's access to healthcare,
decent food, housing and the other
necessities to living and raising a
family when they go to work, we
send the message that working for a
living is counterproductive. If we
want people to go to work, we must
be willing to support them and their
families so that holding a job becomes an asset, not a liability.
Pulling the rug of welfare out from
under people, and forcing them into
low-wage jobs, is simply expanding
the underclass, not creating responsibleworkers and citizens. What kind
of family values will prevail if we
allow our children to go hungry and
without medical care? And what values will children learn when they see
that their parents work sixty- and
eighty-hour weeks, and are still forced
to make the choice between paying
rent and putting food on the table?

who live on welfare because they
would not involve harsher living standards than
those provided by welfare. They
blame those all around them for their
problems; itis just another excuse for
laziness. The choices that people
make in life are reflected by their
position. I don't feel that we, as taxpayers, should have to take care of
people who do not takeresponsibility
for their own actions.
Our present welfare policy plainly
is wasteful and full of loopholes.
There should be a time limit on eligibility for benefits. If individuals are
between jobs, they should be given a
set amount of time to find a new one.
Also, public welfare should be available only to those who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Our
public money should not be used to
support immigrants who have just
decided to reside in our country. After all, our government cannot support the whole world's poor. Unwed
welfare mothers should live withtheir
parents, should be given welfare for
only a certain period of time, and
should not receive any more money if
they have additional children while
on welfare. Perhaps by streamlining,
we can eventually make the system
more cost-efficient.
As we are the most powerful country in the world, it is shameful that we
have homeless people in our nation's
capital and other big cities. But how
can we take care of people who cannot take care of themselves? It is a
futile endeavor. We have to wean
people off the system and attempt to
stop adding more people for bad reasons. Then our country can take pride
in the fact that even its poorest crtizens attempt to help themselves and
that they do not helplessly depend on
the government.
cannot find a job that

Our great country certainly should
be a welfare state. When people are
genuinely between jobs, there should
be some form ofpublic security which
is guaranteed by the government.
However, our welfare system has
turned into an enormous charity pot
that supports too many people for the
wrong reasons.
When people ask me, "How doyou
feel when you see a homeless man on
the street?" my response is, "He
should be working." (The only exceptions to thatreaction are the veterans who are crippled and hardly have
any hope.) I always get a response
like, "But there are no jobs."I tend to
disagree that there are absolutely no
jobs around; it is highly unlikely. I
never give any money to homeless
people because they usually have
cigarettes in theirhand whenbegging
for money. Ifthey had enough money
to buy cigarettes, why are they asking
for handouts? It seems that they are
too lazy even to look for a job.I don't
feel that the taxpayer dollars of hardworking Americans should be used
to support these sorts of indigents on
the street.
An unwedmother should be forced
to stay with her parents. We shouldn't
be paying for her to have more children (which often happens) merely
because she doesn't want to face her
family. She may not realize that the
cost of having another child exceeds
the increase in her welfare check. It
also disturbs me that some people
claim to have been on welfare for
years and years and almost seem
proud of themselves. Liberals say
that no one can be happy or proud to
live on welfare, but I believe that
there are those who are proud to cheat
the system. There are other people

Dealing with Feeling Disturbed During Survivors Week
By

Ben Maulbeck

Some people were disturbed by
Survivors Week.
That's understandable. Sexual assault is a disturbing subject. It' s especially disturbing when it comes at
you in a barrage, as it did last week.
It's not fun to be constantly reminded
for a week of something as dismal
and downbeat as sexual assault.
Some people were much more critical than saying it wasn't fun. Some
people said it was too much—that
there's no point to dwelling on something like sexual assault; it serves no
purpose, after all.
Well, Survivors Week wasn't fun
for me, either. It was draining, emotional, and upsetting. But what is the
alternative? Should we pretend that
sexual assault doesn't exist? Back in
my wonderful suburban hometown,
that was the solution to every problem: ignore it, and it'll go away. But
it never did. And it never will.
Sexual assault is a painful subject.
But if we don't discuss it, if we don't
hold events like Survivors Week, then
it only augments the pain. If we say
nothing„then we leave survivors of
sexual assault to suffer in silence.
And we leave those who may be
assaulted in the future in ignorance.
I guess I have little sympathy for
the people who don't want to deal
with the burden of Survivors Week
and survivors' issues in general. I
know that it's upsetting to have to
think about people who are survivors
ofrape and sexual assault —but I also
know that it's infinitely more painful
to be a survivor of rape or sexual
assault. And it is for theirsake that we
have Survivors Week. Because,
somehow, having people listen to your
pain helps to alleviate it.
But then people comment, "I still
don't see the point. I don'tknow any
survivors." Sure. And you probably
don'tknow any gay people either.

Let's try a little exercise. Think of

four women who are dear to you.
Mother, sister, friend, significant
other, or whatever. Now imagine that
one of them has been sexually assaulted. It's not a pleasant thought.
It's not a pleasant game. Unfortunately, it's not a game. I wish it were.
But it's reality: one in every four
women have been sexually assaulted
by the time they are 18 years old. For
men, it's only one in seven. "Only."
As if that were good.
I'm afraid survivors don't wear
name tags saying, "I was raped when
I was 13." And they usually don't
make a formal announcement about
it. It's just not a great conversation
starter: "Hi, I'm John and I'm a survivor of sexual assault. How are you?"
But that doesn't mean they don't
exist. That was the purpose of the
signs—so that people could see that
survivors are everywhere, that they're
the people who go to class with you,
who eat with you, who live with you.
The signs—like all of Survivors
Week—were supposed to make survivors more visible and break the
insidious silence surrounding rape
and sexual assault.
Some people didn't like having
that silence broken. I think a lot of
people liked the silence—and were
terribly frightened by thethreat to the
silence that Survivors Week posed.
What am I talking about? On several of the signs that said, "I'm a
survivor and..." a second message
was added in different handwriting.
One addition was, "I'm a survivor
and I like Melissa Etheridge." Another was, "I'm an engineer and I
have scars." A third was, "I'm a survivor and I take big shits."
There were others, too—all equally
clever. And where I did I find most of
these clever quips? In men's bathrooms. I suppose the men who wrote
them thought that other men would
be amused. I suppose it didn't occur

to them that a man might be a survivor, too—or even that another man
might actually be sensitive to survi-

vors' issues.
This made me angry. It made me
angry that whoever wrote these messages could laugh at rape and sexual
assault. Tt made me angry that they
thought other people would laugh,
too. It made me angry that some of
them were so cowardly that they could
only do this in the men's bathroom
where they thought they'd be safe
from the scary feminists. It made me
angry that people have could have so
little respect and compassion for
other human beings.
I don't understand why anyone
would write those messages. I don't
understand how anyone could find it
amusing that people are still hurting
because they've been raped or sexually assaulted.

The only explanation I can think of
is that they're afraid. I suppose lean
understand that. This is a scary thing.
It's scary that four of my closest
friends from home are survivors. It's
scary that two people in my family
are survivors. It's scary that five of
my friends here are survivors. It's
scary that I'm a survivor. It's scary
that Swarthmore students have been
raped at Swarthmore. It's scary that
there are Swarthmore students who
are rapists.
I guess it's even scarier that people
are confronting these things and dealing with them. It's scary that people
are breaking the comfortable silence
about rape and sexual assault. It's
scary when people acknowledge how
painful and scarring sexual assault is
and yet then move on and cope with
it.
It's scary when people are brave.

Club Volleyball Drops
Close Game to Rutgers
game 16-14.
The Garnet continued to play consistently, and their setting and hitting
climbed to another level of excellence. Co-captain Dylan Humphrey
'9B collected 15 assists in the game.
The team was able to combat the
strong hitting of Rutgers with some
hitting of its own. The hitting was so
strong that the Rutgers team actually
asked for a new ball because the
game ball became slightly flat. The
Garnet took the game 15-11.
Game four wasn't as positive even
though George Matula '9B scored
two points in one of the basketball
hoops when his kill deflected off one
of the Rutgers players into thebasket.
Poor serving resurfaced. Despite having a match point for them, poor
serving prevented the Garnet from
winning the game. They ended up
losing the game 16-14 despite consistency in other areas.
The ominous rally scoring was used
in the fifth game. This means that
every rally ends in a point scored no
matter which team is serving.
Swarthmore College men's volleyball has a history of losing five set
matches. It turns out that the curse of
the fifth set has not been lifted as
Rutgers dominated the final set, winning it 15-11.
Humphrey stated, "We need to be
more consistent at serving to be able
to pull out theseclose matches." The
Garnet look forward to their next
match against Eastern on March 27.

the start because Rutgers had an athletic 6'6" middle blocker and an outside hitter who crushed the ball during warm-ups. Most of the burden
was placed on Benjamin Heuston '96
and George Matula '9B, the Garnet's
two middle blockers, for they needed
to be able to put a block up against
every hit.
Consistent passing highlighted a
well-played first game for the Garnet. Passing has been a problem for
the team in the past. They played well
in all areas except in their serving.
The team missed four serves in the
first game alone. Despite playing well,
Swarthmore lost the first game 15-9.
However, in the second game the
team began to concentrate on their
serves. The team missed only one
serve the entire game, and Dave
O'Brien '96 had two aces. However,
despite the Garnet's new found consistency, Rutgers hung close on the
strength of their outstanding hitting.
The score remained close throughout
the set. Finally, at 15-14, co-captain
Paul Hsu '9B had a monstrous kill
down the line to give Swat the serve.
Swarthmore ended up winning the

The Hood Trophy has been located
and now stands in a Swarthmore trophy case just outside the athletic offices in Tarble Pavillion. The Trophy, arguably the most famous of
Swarthmore's trophies, should have
been in Swarthmore's possession
since last year. However, the trophy
had been missing for "a year or so,"
according to Athletic Director Bob
Williams.
Williams noted
that the trophy, donated by Albert
Wood Jr. way back
in 1942 and given
annually to the
school thatwins the
most games in headto-head competition
in varsity sports,
was not even discovered missing until a Phoenix photographer came
looking for it in
early February. The
department then
went in search ofthe
bowl, but did not have to look far.
"We asked Haver-ford about the trophy. They knew about its whereabouts," he said.
The trophy was brought over by a
Haverford dean before the epic
Swarthmore-Haverford basketball
battles on Feburary 17. It then sat in
Williams' office for several weeks
before finally being returned to a
trophy case outside the Athletic Department offices on Monday.
The same day that Swarthmore
physically came into possession of
the trophy, they almost lost it again.
On Feburary 17, "a group of students
came in to steal it at the game, but a
Haverford dean was there to defend

it," said Williams. He said that the
dean, who was alone in the offices,
did not know if the students were
from Haverford or Swarthmore.
The trophy itself is nothing extravagant. It is a simple silver bowl,
about a foot and a half in diameter,
with few engravings or eye-catching
features. It is not the biggest, oldest
or the most prestigious trophy in the
cases, but has the most renown on
campus.
"We probhave
ably
some more

prestigious trophies, but this
is the trophy
which usually
promotes the
most interest,"

said Williams.
The bowl has
been passed
back and forth
between the
two schools for

over 50 years
and has become a valued
tradition by
many.
It and the Seven Sisters trophy are
the only two travelling trophies in
Swarthmore sports.
The future of the trophy is still up
in the air. Swarthmore tied up the
race for the Hood at 4.5 points apiece
with its pair of victories in basketball
last month. That leaves it up to the
spring athletic contests to determine
where the trophy will be located nex
year.
Sports remaining to be played ar
baseball, men's and women's la
crosse, softball, men's and women'
tennis, and men's and women's track
Whichever school wins more of thes
games will own the trophy for an
other year.

it's time for Spring Break, then the
Swarthmore Ultimate Frisbee teams
must be making their annual pilgrimage to the sunny Mecca of Florida.
This year there has been an explosion
of true believers, with over 35 pilgrims signed up for the trip.
Under the steady leadership ofcaptains Erika Baumgartner '9B, Robin
Mandel '97, Lena Loewenthal '97,
and Dave Lewis '97, however, the
organizational headache has been
restrained to a dull pounding. The
trek begins with a fun-filled all-night
all-day drive to Gainesville, Florida.
Transportation czar Dave Sacker '97
will lead the three-van party which
departs the frosty locale of
Swarthmore on Thursday night. Then,
after a goodnight's sleep and a hearty
breakfast under the auspices of food
tyrant Kate Walker '97, the
Frostbreaker tournament begins Friday night.
The men will be facing the likes of
Harvard, Brown, and the University
of Pennsylvania, as well as several
club (non-collegiate) teams. The
women will play some of the best
women's teams in the land at both the

college and club level.
After an exhilarating weekend of
sun-drenched Ultimate, the team will
visit the sun-drenched beaches! Our
heroes/pilgrims/Swatties will grace
the sandy expanses of Sarasota, surviving Spring Break the way God/
Allah/Jehovah (all of' em!) intended.
But for some schools, Spring Break
is part of the curriculum, and to experience such heresy our steadfast
Swatties will travel to Tallahassee
and the company of the Florida State
Ultimate team. Lodging in Tallahassee is being graciously provided by
the parents ofSarah Wise '96, a timehonored and much-appreciated tradition.
Fully indoctrinated in the essential
skills ofSpring Breaking, the 'Worms
and 'Mothers will pack up their collective arses and head to Columbia,
South Carolina. There they'll culminate their week with the St. Patrick's
Day tournament. Tents and sleeping
bags will again shelter to our intrepid
athletes, who will be enjoying the
organizational skill of gear czar Mac
Funk '99.
Tired, poor, unwashed, and victorious, these Ultimate players will return to Swarthmore at the end of the
week. They'll be easy to spot: lobster
red and full of stories somewhere
between true and false.

Though the Swarthmore women's
tennis team will feel the loss ofits top
four starters from last season, the
depth of this year's team casts a favorable outlook on the season as the
women plan their spring break training trip to a warmer climate.
The season opener against powerhouse Mary Washington will set the
tone for the team's week in Hilton
Head, South Carolina, while the remainder of the week will include less
daunting matches against the University of Wisconsin (Eau Claire),
Methodist, and Valparaiso.
Upon theirreturn from Hilton Head,
the women expect to fill the Wharton
stands with fans-as they challenge
their first home competitor, Washington College, on Tuesday, March
26. Returning to the team this season
are co-captains Hilary Gehlbach '96
and Michelle Martinez '97, Valerie
Threlfall '96, Nga Lai '97, Rani

emphasis on consistency and skilled

they look to defend their conference
championship title.

The beginning of a new era in men' s
lacrosse looked like a continuation of
the last, as the Garnet fell to West
Chester University 18-3yesterday in
a game played on a sloppy field.
Throughout the day, the rain poured
down, creating precarious footing
problems for all players and especially the goalies. In the first quarter,
this created scoring problems forboth
teams, ending with a low score of 10 in favor of the Rams. After the
Garnet tied the game, however, the
Rams then dominated all aspects of
the contest and ran away with an easy
win, ruining coach Pat Gress' debut
as head coach at Swarthmore.
The Garnet were outmanned,
outsized, and then outplayed by the
Division II Rams. Defensively, the
Garnet could not even slow the Ram
attack once it got going. Goalie Elijah
Porter '99, starting in his first game,
didn't stand a chance as shots were
being fired in all directions. Offensively, the Garnet could not control
the ball, turning the ball over numerous times. This breakdown both defensively and offensively paved
the way for the 18-3 defeat.

The return of starters and fall soccer players Ricky Phillips '96 and
Alec Stall '9B will give the team a
seasoned back line. In fact, some fall
starters may find themselves playing
B-side because the back line is so

deep.
"This is the strongest back line I
have ever had. We should go undefeated this season, and that is saying
a lot because our schedule is very
tough," said Dougal.

Team Florida-Bound for Spring Break

Come Saturday morning at 10:00
a.m., the women's softball team will
embark on the spring break experience of a lifetime.After midterms are
finished and papers turned in, the
worries of school will melt away, to
be replaced by the sound of the snap
of the ball in the glove and the smells
of clay and sweat.
After a brief stop in Orlando, the
team will settle into the Days Inn at
Ft. Pierce for a week of grueling
softball led by Vinnie, Tommy and
the Swarthmore Softball coaching
staff.Fourdoubleheaders in five days
could quite possibly spell pain for
Swat, but the lucky 13 will persevere.
Led by team captains Vanessa Motto
'96 and Dana Lehman '9B, they hope
to show the women from Husson,
Rippon, Rutgers, and Concordia how
the game is played.
The infield is young this year, with
Jen Vander Veer '99 at shortstop,
Lurah Hess '99 at second base, Jean
Quinn '99 playing first, Melissa
Morrell '99 pitching and Apryl Dunning '99 alternating between catcher
and pitcher. The outfield is shaping
up nicely with Nettie Witgert '97 and
Alejandra Gonzalez '96 as the backbone and Mollie Davis '96 and Mary
Elizabeth Alvarez '9B rotating in from
behind the plate as catchers. Laura

The men's rugby team is making
its seasonal debut tomorrow in an
away game against Drexel. After
making the playoffs for the first time
in team history in the fall, the Evil
Buzzards are expecting to return with
a strong spring season. "I would say
that this is probably the best team
I've played on in three years," said
co-captain Jason Dougal '96.
What makes the team so optimistic
is that they were very successful last
season despite being depleted by injuries and the absence of many key
players. The Buzzards typically have
a stronger team in the spring, and this
season is no exception. Dave Plastino
'97 returns to fill the prop position
thathe vacated in the fall while spending a semester abroad in Russia. Last
season there were problems in the
forward pack because of a lack of
players. With Plastino at prop, the
pack should be much stronger.
Although two starters from last
season are abroad and one is playing
lacrosse, their absence should not
adversely affect the team. There is

tage of a short, sick defender and
went airborne to tie the score. The
momentum swing lasted as long as
the next face off, as the Rams scored
just seconds afterwards. Three more
quick goals later, and the Garnethopes
were becoming crushed. But midway
through the quarter, Andy Place '96
rifled a goal from a feed by Ben
Seigel '96, who had beaten his man.
A couple more Ram goals later
brought the halftime score to 7-2.
The second half, however, turned
into a complete disaster, as West
Chester scored at will. The only goal
by the Garnet was Donaghy' s second
of the game on a feed by Erik Griffin
'96 on a man-up situation. The manup offense played well, but were offered only two chances. There was
some fine defensive play at times, but
when a goal is let up, the entire defense is at fault.
The Garnet will have a tougher
team to face Saturday afternoon at
home against Division I Drexel. The
Dragons beat Swarthmore 16-11 last
year in a tough battle. The Garnet will
have to improve dramatically to have
any chance of beating Drexel.

Lehman has shown impressive
improvement on the mound fromher
noble, yet novice debut performance
during spring training last year. Using her new pitching weapons and
their fast and furious freshmen on the
