Coming Out Week asserts gay rights
by Toki Rehder
Contributing Writer
"Straight But Not Narrow
Minded," "I Support the Gay
Agenda," and "Live and Let
Love" were some of the stickers on students' jackets and
backpacks during Coming
Out Week. This week, organized by members of SQU
and QSA, continues the campaign to increase the visibility of queer students and raise
awareness about queer issues.
In light of the recent murder
of Matthew Shepard, a victim
of homophobic violence, the
week particularly addressed
queer students' concerns
about safety from violence
and freedom from fear.
The semester, SQU's major goal has been to create a
supportive environment for
queer students. Not only is
SQU a place where "people
feel safe and supported," saidSQU cocoordinator Ben
Maulbeck '99, but another
aspect of support is being
very visible." Several recent
homophobic instances have
"made queer people feel unsafe on campus. Our job is
to make people feel safer
this is part of support," said
Maulbeck.
Coming Out Week continues the goals CQW (Campus
Queer Watch) campaign
which began before break.
According to Maulbeck, this
campaign was "very successful because it emphasized the
fact that there are so many
queer-friendly people here.
CQW reclaimed the safety
that had been taken by the homophobic incidents." Tim
Stewart-Winter 'Ol commented that a distinctive element of queer activism on
campus this semester is that
"queer-friendly people are
visible."
To kick off the week, on
Tuesday, a number of students
participated in the Day of Silence in honor of those who
cannot speak because of fear
or threats. That evening,
more than 100 people attended the Candlelight Vigil
for Matthew Shepard and all
victims of homophobic violence. "It was the most in"

â€”

tense public mourning experience that I ever had," said
Talia Young'ol. Corey DatzGreenberg 'OO, SQU co-so-

cial/outreach coordinator,

emphasized that Matthew
Shepard is "only the tip of the
iceberg, and that there are
about 28 reported, and many
more unreported, cases of
homophobic murder every
year." "It was a really extraordinary moment for a lot
of queer students to talk out
loud about how we feel about
homophobia in a safe space
not limited to ourselves" said
Stewart-Winter, who coordinated the vigil.
Following the Candlelight
Vigil, there was a SAO discussion about Asian/Queer
Identity. Young, who co-facilitated the discussion, said
that it "made people think and
made them aware that queer
issues pertained to everyone."
On Wednesday night, there
was an open SQU meeting
where students discussed
sexual identity and what it
means to them.
On Thursday, the IC
hosted a lecture by Jaime
Washington, Director of Student Life at the University of
Maryland. His lecture provided a framework for "Creating a Supportive Community for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered
Students." He emphasized the
need for participation by all
parts of the college community: faculty, administration,
and students. Effective education on queer issues needs
to address the following questions: How does it feel to be
queer?, What misinformation
about sexuality to we have?,
and What action can we take?
Washington also met with the
deans to discuss support for
queer students at Swat.
According Julie Russo
'OO, SQU co-coordinator, the
administration has been very
supportive throughout and
"willing to talk to us and give
us anything we need. Public
Safety has also been helpful
with reporting hate speech incidents and Owen Redgrave
invited Public Safety staff to

seeks Crura
masturbator
by Kathryn Tong
Staff Writer

A man was seen masturbating by Crum Creek on Oct.
16 by a Wallingford resident,
according to Public Safety.
The female resident described the man as a 35 to 40
year old Caucasian male,
thinly built and wearing dark
clothing. She saw the man fondling himself while walking
her dog in Crum Meadow at
10 a.m. The man made no attempt to converse with or approach her.
The victim did not report
the incident until last Tuesday
afternoon, after she saw him
again near the same location.
He was not indecently exposed
this second time.
After she reported the
sighting to Public Safety, police and Public Safety officers
searched the area where the
incident occurred.
"We are keeping an added
eye on the area, but since the
victim waited so long to report
the incident, the probability of
the man being apprehended is
low," said the Swarthmore Police Department's new chief
Brian Craig.
If the man is found again
committing the same crime, he
faces a maximum sentence of
two years in prison for this
second degree misdemeanor,
he said.
Over the last 20 years,
Swarthmore has had an average of two or three indecent
exposure incidents a year, and
the majority of them occur in
the Crum, said Owen
Redgrave, Director of Public
Safety.
"We've caught some

a variety of reasons, such as
reciprocity norms, which
Kraut described as the common sentiment that "we feel
guilty not returning e-mails."
Another explanation is partial
reinforcement, which Kraut
defined as similar to the lab rat
repeatedly pressing the bar for
pleasurable electronic shocks,
meaning that we look forward
and anticipate others' responses to our e-mails.
Kraut went on to explain
that the more socially involved
we are, the more resistant we
are to daily life stresses that lead
to depression. Thus, assuming
that the internet increases social
involvement by means of connecting people, it would be logical to conclude that the internet
would lead to more social sup-

port, less depression, and a
weaker relationship between
stress and health. However, being on-line actually reduces the
commitment and enjoyment of
real friendships. Studying certain combinations of variables,
Kraut observed an increase in
loneliness and depression with
the increase of internet use as a
means of communication.
There were even fewer minutes

members of the households
with a heavier internet use.

SCCS installs new
campus server "Merlin"
by Josh Miller
News Editor
On Friday, October 16,
SCCS (Swarthmore College
Computing Society) installed a
new server to replace Condor,
the server that was irreparably
damaged in a power outage last
June.
The new server, Merlin,
has 384 megabytes ofRAM, operates at 400 megahertz, and
uses a Pentium 2 processor.
After Condor crashed, the
SCCS had transferred essential
services such as email and fde
editing to Kestrel, its web server.
Kestrel's user partition was nearly
filled to capacity, so SCCS had
urged users not to retrieve nonessential files from Condor.
On Monday, however, SCCS

transferred its users' email accounts to Merlin, allowing users
space to save non-essential email
and files.
"We now have much more
free space than we did on Kestrel,
soyou should all feel free to transfer old Kestrel orCondor mail directories over to Merlin," said an
SCCS email to users.
SCCS installed the new computer on the fifth floor of Parrish
in its new office. SCCS intends
to hold meetings and house its library in the new Parrish space and
also plans to hold office hours for
users.

Users may retrieve any Condor files until after Thanksgiving
break. Anyone who is having
problems recovering any of their
files should email support
@ sccs.swarthmore.edu

School of the Americas
should be closed
by Ben Schweigert
Contributing Writer
The School of the Americas is a military training institution in Fort Benning, Ga.,
whose purpose is to train military personnel from Latin
America in counter-insurgency tactics.
recently-released
In
manuals from the school, these
tactics were revealed to include torture,
extortion, assassination,
and blackmailing. The
Defense Department has
admitted that
these techniques were
in fact used at
the school.
Since its
inception in
1946,
the
School of the
Americas has
graduated soldiers
who
went on to become many of
Latin America's worst human
rights abusers, including such
infamous people as Manuel
Noriega, the assassins of Archbishop Oscar Romero and the
soldiers responsible for the massacre of six Jesuits and two of
theirco-workers in El Salvador.
The school must be closed.
The supposed purpose of
the school is to support the
growth of democracy in Latin
America. Over the last fifty
years, however, the school has
trained soldiers from some of
Latin America's most repressive
regimes.
It has been used as a tool to
prevent the development of
democratic movements and institutions and to provide the
training and expertise necessary
for the widespread and systematic abuse of human rights.
It has become a symbol in

Kathie Lee, Wal-Mart fail to deliver
by Mark Charette

Staff Writer
You might remember the scene. Television show host Kathie Lee Gifford is crying under the hot lights ofa New York City
television studio.
It is May 1996. In the past month, media exposes have uncovered Dickensian
working conditions in the factories that produce the clothing line Gifford endorses.
In Honduran and New York sweatshops, young women and girls are found
toiling up to 13 hours per day for minimum
and sub-minimum wages to manufacture
the garments that bear Gifford's name in
Wal-Mart's aisles. Gifford's initial response
is to interpret the findings as character defamation.
"You can say I'm ugly," Gifford tells
her television audience. "You can say I'm
not talented, but when you say I don't care
about children...How can you!?"
For someone who donates 10% of the
profits from her clothing line to children's
charities, this response seems particularly
misguided. Ms. Gifford's husband, Frank
Gifford, adds to the melee by visiting the
New York sweatshop that produces the her
brand name, where he stuffs envelopes
filled with three $lOO bills into workers'
hands.
Following intense public scrutiny, Ms.
Gifford has a fit of conscience and bares
her soul before a national audience, expressing pain and frustration that her attempt to create a charitable fashion line
could go so badly awry. Early in the summer of 1996, Gifford takes her frustration
a step further, promising that the 28 plants
that manufacture her name brand will be
subject to independent monitoring by human rights organizations.
In an interview with "Time" magazine,
she promises, "If I find that I can't effect

change in relation to this problem, then I
will consider leaving the clothing industry."
Gifford sets off a spark in the fashion
and garment industries, culminating in an
event held at New York's Fashion Cafe,
where supermodels and industry leaders
promise better working conditions for the
people who make their clothes.
Had Wal-Mart followed through on
Kathie Lee Gifford's promise of independent monitoring, the company would have
become an industry leader. Whether
Gifford's call for better working conditions
in Wal-Mart's factories were genuine or
pure damage control would have become
unimportant. Gifford and Wal-Mart would
have become benchmarks against which the
rest of the mass-produced clothing industry would have to measure itself.
Instead, Gifford's call for better labor
conditions faded from the spotlight and
Wal-Mart sat comfortably behind claims it
had already established a system of independent monitoring. The company pointed
to its 1992 Code of Conduct â€”a document
which is superficially a great leap forward
in corporate ethics.
Without such a code, companies have
little incentive to consider labor conditions
when deciding where to manufacture their
products. Ideally, the Code of Conduct
would create a framework guiding WalMart away from contractors that abuse and
underpay employees. It would ensure consumers mat when we buy from Wal-Mart,
we aren't supporting the exploitation of
young workers throughout the world.
Behind the Code of Conduct's glossy
cover lurks a set of loose regulations, including an allowance for 14- and 15-yearold workers in factories producing goods
sold in its stores. The code stipulates a series of "independent" inspections of company factories, but Wal-Mart officials themselves have admitted that company buyers

often perform these inspections.
These lax rules help explain why WalMart has not taken any substantial steps to
change the conditions that brought Kathie
Lee Gifford so much negative attention in
May 1996. In its report "Made In China,"
the National Labor Committee (NLC) reveals that workers in the Liang Shi Handbag Factory in Dongguan City, Guangdong,
earn as little as 12 cents an hour for 60- to
70-hour weeks producing Kathie Lee
Gifford handbags.
Even after this wage is adjusted to the
local cost of living, it is barely enough to
cover basic necessities. Worse, the factory
has no fire exits and workers' wages are
deducted for housing in cramped dormitories provided by the factory's owners.
The NLC was only able to find out
about the Liang Shi factory after its investigators followed a series of leads. The
Committee suspects that there are at least
10 factories of this kind producing Kathie
Lee Gifford handbags in China. Without
truly independent monitoring, we will never
know where the rest of these factories are
located or the conditions under which
people work in these factories.
Wal-Mart is the world's largest retailer,
with annual sales of $llB billion in 1997,
larger than the combined GDP of the
world's 155 poorest countries (there are
only 192 nations in the world). Paying a
non-governmental human rights organization to monitor the factories that manufacture its products would be a microscopic
dropfrom the company's vast pool ofprofit.
But like Nike, Disney and the host of
other companies whose poor labor practices
have been exposed, Wal-Mart leaves us to
wonder what bad news we will find out
next. Until a thorough system of independent monitoring is established, our ability
to make informed choices as consumers and
investors is seriously limited.

Swatties urged to become engaged

appropriate balance between being responsible to the Swarthmore Asian and
Asian-American community and the
Swarthmore College community as a
whole.
I had decided to bear the burden of
supporting an entire racial/ethnic community, but it bothered me that I did not
feel like I was necessarily supporting the
larger Swarthmore community. I did not
want to accept that SAO is perceived by
most as having no part in enhancing the
larger Swarthmore community and is
even viewed by many to be harmful to
the betterment of the community..
Though I have never publicly articulated this concern, this issue hasremained
in the back of my mind. I have not been
able to reconcile this tension, until how.
Perhaps this is why I am writing a
"call-to-arms," so to speak, for Swatties
to get involved: I am confident now that
my work in a "closed" support group is
in fact contributing to and enhancing the
larger Swarthmore community and I am
even confident enough to ask others to

do the same.
I have realized that I am doing my
part. The two responsibilities of serving the Asian/Asian American community and supporting the larger Swarthmore community are not mutually exclusive. My responsibility to the larger
Swarthmore community has come in
the form of my responsibility of supporting SAO.
Encouraging members of the Asian/
Asian American community to beactive
in SAO and to be active in other activities contributes back into the civic and
social life of the larger Swarthmore community.

When I started my term last semester, I wondered how I could strike the

I will even offer a political science
theory for why this is true: the theory
of "social capital." This theory, made
popular by Swarthmore alum and
Harvard political science professor
Robert Putnam, says that "social capital" is the participation of citizens in
civic and social activities and organizations.
This is particularly important because such active citizens are happier
people and are more "in touch" with
others and themselves. Such citizens
can make more informed and effective
decisions when engaging in processes
that govern and, thus, support the larger
community.
When people are more civic and
social, greater "social capital" is accumulated and the larger community is
better for it. So my little piece of work
in SAO is in fact my part in supporting
and accumulating the positive "social
capital" for the betterment of the larger
Swarthmore College community.
I warn that you should not read this
article as a public confession of my
"guilt" about the possibility that supporting SAO was not supporting the
larger community. Rather, it is a
roundabout explanation for why I think
you should become more active in organizations and why you should support other students' activismâ€”despite
the often-times stifling academic focus
of our college.
I have actually come to accept that
my life will be driven by my never-ending search for a sense of "real" community through working with organizations. This is because I truly believe
that it is beneficial to you and your
community when you are an active,
engaged, and supportive citizen.

Abortion destroys

decreased perspective on the world, but
an increase in violence. Empathetic

people would naturally be more reluctant to kill others because they would be
able to see them as similar to themselves.
A lack of empathy for certain
groups allows others to kill them without remorse. In an ideal world people
would feel empathy for all living
things, and there would be no killing.
But people have to eat, so they separate plants and animals from their empathy for the sake of survival.
People get along by weighing the
benefits of eliminating groups from empathy against the harmful effects of decreased emotional connection. For instance, plants and animals are frequently
killed for food, but people feel bad when
they kill them for comfort or pleasure.
Children are also killed to make
people's lives more comfortable and
pleasurable. However, although mothers' lives may improve immediately, they
lose one of the strongest connections that
can exist between two individuals.
Not surprisingly, many abortions
leave lasting scars on the women who
receive them because these women felt
a sense of empathy for theirchild, which
they lose forever.The way to stop the pain
caused by abortion is to increase it.
People need emotional connections, and
that is gained not by killing children but
by raising and loving them.
The fact that unborn children are
identical physically and spiritually to
legally recognized citizens is unmistakable. All that stands in the way of
anti-abortion laws is the emotional rejection of unborn children.
Some day society will realize that
it is slowly bleeding itself spiritually
and will outlaw abortions. Hopefully
that day will come soon. While society can afford to wait, millions of unborn children cannot.

As Robin Williams said in "Dead
Poets Society:" "excrement."
"Hey dumbass," the two people
who read this column on a regular basis are thinking right now, "you use
those terms all the time." True enough,
although I try to use them less than the
average entertainment journalist, but
it's pretty much inevitable when you're
trying to write about this field. That's
because, with a few exceptions, most
entertainment stories such as those you
find in the arts section of your paper or
in any random magazine with a celebrity on the cover (which is most every
mag these days) really don't have any
story. It's all about increasing readership for the publication and viewership
for the filmfTV show, and it's the curious convergence of the two in an otherwise "serious" medium that, at least
to me, makes entertainment journalism
so damned entertaining.
Consider
the
Hollywood
wunderkinds Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck if you want the best example
of how the symbiotic cycle of press
coverage and Hollywood press spin
works. A year ago, practically nobody
knew who these dudes were. They were
just two out of the thousands of good
looking guys in their twenties
acheiving only marginal success in
Hollywood. Then, as you all know,
came "Good Will Hunting," a heartbreaking movie that displayed the
gifted acting and writing talents of
these two prodigies and turned them
into not only heartthrobs, but Oscarwinning screenwriters and Hollywood
superstars. As magazines and TV
shows chronicled, these poor guys had
previously been broke, struggling actors who, tired ofthe lack of goodroles,
wrote their own script that was so good
it got a top director and top star (Gus
Van Sant and Robin Williams) involved
and quickly catapulted the boys to the
top.
Excrement.
Not that any of the above is necessarily falseâ€”although rumors abound
over whether Ben and Matt actually
wrote the script as filmed (the original
draft Castle Rock bought from them
had Will Hunting involved in a CIA
conspiracy). The Hollywood account
assumes an objective media that is simply telling a compelling story. The truth
is, in fact, that the whole "best friends"
and "starving actors" angle which
drove most of the coverage of Affleck
and Damon was spoon-fed to the media by Miramax, the studio that distributed "Good Will Hunting." Each time
Matt or Ben's face was on the cover of
a magazine, an impression more effective than any advertisement was made
on the public, because not only were
they seeing that smiling face, but they
were not thinking of it as an advertisement and so were much less likely to
think they were being manipulated.
The Affleck and Damon story had such
a great angle, and such attractive faces
that Miramax barely needed to run any
ads. The studio big shots could just sit
back and let the media do the job for
them.
It is not, of course, as though the
studios have to get on their knees and
beg for journalists to write about their
films. Otherwise respectable magazines such as Vanity Fairand GQ don't
put a celebrity with an upcoming film
on their cover most every month because a fluff interview is the best thing
they have in the issue. They do it, obviously, to increase sales. So as much
as Hollywood benefits from the stories
it plants in the media, the media benefits from the gorgeous faces and "fascinating insights" Hollywood allows it
to make journalism from. Bio. majors

ample, his found poetry is all assembled from chronological sections of
discarded card catalogues, which have
probably been apathetically riffled
through thousands of times by people
seeking a specific book. What seem to
be obvious themes in his work, such as
The Doors in Los Angeles and The
Beatles in Liverpool, is on closer examination more complicated and less
direct. "Even Bunn's poem Yesterday,
writes essayist lan Hunt, "which is
drawn from titles including one book
about the Beatles, forbids one to hear
the song itself and contextualises it with
a glut of other yesterdays: the autobi"

Bunn, who has already assembled
seven books just from the Los Angeles card catalogue, says the work is
"becoming more and more enriching."
He has recently been given the card

I met with David Bunn
in the List Gallery, an artist
and poet who works with the
defunct Los Angeles Central
and Liverpool libraries' card
catalogs. He took off his angular black glasses as we
began our conversation, and
I found him easy to talk to
and friendly. Speaking
thoughtfully in a resonant,
deep voice, he discussed his
education, obsessions with
the Beatles and card catalogs, and the process and
themes of his work.
Liz: What did the
Beatles mean to you?
David: I was fourteen
when the Beatles came to the
States, so I was a prime target to be a pop fan. I think
the Beatles were a symbol of
something powerfully modern for my generationâ€”transgressive, sort of
naughty, but not so far out
that we couldn't embrace it.
People talked a lot at the
time about a kind of battle
between the Beatles and
Elvis Presley, and I was
never interested in Elvis
Presley. He was just a little
too country or something,
whereas the Beatles had this
amazingly modern and sort
of exotic sensibility. I think
the Beatles represented a
sense of going from adolescence from young adulthood.
Liz: What was it like

Liverpool stacks?
David: I saw Liverpool
through the eyes of a fourteen year old, so I saw it as
being the home of the
Beatlesâ€”and a legacy of that
pop music phenomenon colored everything I saw while
I was there. I wasn't sure that
I would make work specifically about the Beatles, but I
thought about them almost

all the time I was there, so
the idea of the Beatles was a
theme in the work that certainly developed. Also, I
knew Liverpool as a site for
immigration from Europe to
the United States. The part
that was really interesting
was that it was also part of
the slave triangle where
money and goods from England went to Africa and
were traded for slaves, and
the slaves were sold in
America, and the monev was
brought back to England.

simplicity and straightforwardness about making decisions as an artist. I'm interested in how few decisions I can make on my own
and how manv decisions are

with the invasion ofAmerica

Liz: Did you see your
work as a kind of found poetry?
David: Oh, yes. What I
wanted to emphasize in the
presentation of the work is
the very simple relationship
that exists between the typed
poem and the series of cards
that the poem is drawn from.
On the one hand, if you look
at it, it's just a list of the

were creating it, why did you

David: The frames are
document frames; I wanted
something that was very
simple and very literal. I let
the length of the frames be
determined by the number of
cards whose titles began
with a certain word or series
of words that made up a
poem. The different links [of

do has given them a reputation
throughout the city. Yet, I will
often find myself with friends
who will say the most homophobic things.
Early in my stay, I had an
awesome Thai teacher who was
liberal on almost every issue
except homosexuality. One day
one of our new vocabulary
words was hate. The example he
gave was "I hate gays, I hate
more sexuals (his word for bisexual)".
Superficially, Thailand is
extremely accepting of queer
people. While at Swarthmore
even cross dressing has caused
quite a stir, at Chiang Mai University you will see katoeys
(transsexuals and transvestites)
throughout the cafeteria. Last
week at the memorial of the brutal military crackdown on student democracy protests, one of
the main stage events were two
groups of high school boys in
drag doing 80s style choreographed dancing. The crowd of
course was thoroughly into it,
although many of the same
people would utter homophobic
sentiments in private.
My friend Thorn believes
that a major fault with Thai culture is the tendency to sweep
things under the rug. The problem is that the implicit assumption is that the people who suffer the brunt of the problems
will just stay passive. While
Moslem Achmed with his dark
skin is likely to remain a punching bag, people who are members of larger groups like
women, queers, and the poor,
are increasingly going to make
their mark and demand fair and
humane treatment.

soft of music meter.

Liz: What made you decide you wanted the L.A. catalog?
David: I kind of stumbled
over the card catalog. I didn't
expect in 1990 to find that a
library would discard its card
catalog and put everything on
the computer. It was a shock
to see the catalog all boxed up
in .514 boxes and realize what
an incredible object this was.
If we see the library as a place
that tries to collect everything,
they represent the total of human knowledge, or they would
like to. I began to think about
letting that be the map for an
ongoing series of works,
maybe for the rest of my life
even. The L.A. card catalog, if
I take it literally that it represents all the world's knowledgeâ€”all the world's objects,
let's say â€”[then,] it also represents the territory for an ongoing work of art that encompasses everything. I love the
idea that it represents this par-

ticular moment that we're in,
which is a moment of change
from an object-way of knowing the world to a virtual
wayâ€”that something so public and so important could be
discarded and picked up by an
individual. There's a lot of
things about the card catalog
that I've become really in love
with and really obsessed by. I
love the fact that I can browse
through the catalog in a way I
never could on the computer
the sort of thumb-and-forefinger method of going through
things and skipping around,
and I can notice the relationship of the physical in the
cards that I could never find
in the virtual. For instance, in
the poem that's made from
cards with the words "a job
for," it's interesting to see how
weathered and touched the
corners of the cards are. It's a
way of showing how many
people have looked for a job
through the card catalog [and]
how many people have
touched those cards. When I

"I finally had sex," says Andrew Tobias, summing up his
experience of coming out.
Needless to say this has not
been the most strongly emphasized theme of coming out week
here at Swarthmore, and rightly
so, in a world in which gay men,
at least, are often portrayed as
obsessed with getting some.
Public portrayals of coming out
are often, in the "Ellen" paradigm, designed to appeal to a
mainstream audience assumed
to be relatively unaware of "gay
issues."
Tobias's reading, on the
Thursday evening just before
break, was different, in that the
audience was made up mostly
of gay men. (I detected them
with my gaydar.) Tobias read
from and discussed his book,
"The Best Little Boy in the
World," first published twentyfive years ago, and its newlypublished sequel, The Best
Little Boy in the World Grows
Up." The reading took place at

bookstore at the corner of 12th
and Pine, in the center of
Philadelphia's largest gay
neighborhood.
"The Best Little Boy in the
World," which is one of the
best-selling coming-out stories
of all time, was written under
the pseudonym of John Reid.
This year, the book has been rereleased in a spiffy Modern Library edition with Tobias' real
name on the cover, which shows
how much progress queer folk
have made in the last quartercentury toward visibility and
pride. "The Best Little Boy in
the World Grows Up" is a kind
of coming-out story, too, in that
the author finally reveals his real
name and real life. Andrew
Tobias, interestingly enough,
has become a highly successful
businessman whose popular,
books include "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever
Need."
His first book is a memoir of
the trials of a boy who struggles
through adolescence and young
adulthood feeling out ofplaceand
not knowing why. It traces his life
from a comfortable childhood in
upper-middle-class New York in
which Tobias fought mightily to
preserve, in the eyes of his parents, peers, and teachers, his status as (you guessed it) the best
littleboy in the world. As the book
progresses and JohnReid goes off
to Yale (Tobias actually went to
Harvard), we see him facing
greater and greater pressure to
conform to the norms of heterosexual life. Tobias is terrified; he
still doesn't know what's wrong.
Coming out back then was
much different from today.
Tobias only knew of one other
gay person on his campus, and
he didn't seem like the best guy
to come out to. For instance, instead of helping questioning
people sort things through confidentially, this fellow made a
habit of announcing which of
his classmates he thought were
closet cases, and sneering at
them. He was a creature of a
hostile environment, reaching

for any kind of power he could
obtain. There were no gay role
models, no gay professors, and
no gay TV characters.
"The Best Little Boy in the
World Grows Up" is really
aimed at gay men who probably
read the earlier book just when
they were coming out. Tobias
described it as a thank-you letter for all the progress that's
been made in the last twentyfive years. Indeed, Tobias's first
book was published in the year
before the American Psychological Association removed
homosexuality from its official
manual of mental illnesses. Today, we have gay actors, gay
sports stars, gay professors, gay
brochures in the admissions office. Tobias told the crowd at
Giovanni's Room a very funny
story of joining Ed Rendell, the
mayor of Philadelphia, on a trip
to Woody's, the gay club in center city. To the young man we
meet in the first book, such a
thing is unimaginable.
"The Best Little Boy in the
World" is extremely friendly,
which I think is why it's such a
helpful book for gay kidsâ€”boys, anywayâ€”who are just beginning to put a name to their
feelings, and are trying to find
out everything they possibly can
about being gay. Although it's
certainly a period piece in some
respects, and that's a good thing,
it also honestly describes feelings that are pretty much universal among queer people, that
most of us keep secret, sometimes for many years. Tobias's
(or Reid's) book can be helpful
because it describes the process
from the inside out, but also
from the perspective of someone with a sense of humor who
lived to tell the tale.
My reactions to "The Best
Little Boy in the World Grows
Up" are a little more complicated.
I do think that we've made a lot
of progress, but as I've argued in
this week's opinion section*thebaic
real dangers to a version of gay history that hinges on the idea of steady,
inevitable progress. And thekind of
progress that Tobias talks about is
pretty specific. He seems very focused on the idea that gay people
can be just as successful in the public sphere as straight people. He
doesn't want homosexuality to interfere with anyone's trajectory up
the corporate ladder. I feel like his
view that the world has reached
some kind of pinnacle of queerfriendliness, for which he is now
writing a "thank-you letter,"isafeeling brought about by his own career success.
In a funny way, it's as if
Tobias is still caught up with the
notion that being gay shouldn't
interfere with anyone's being the
best in the worldâ€”therichest, the
smartest, the most beautiful, and
the most famous. There's no question that fame and visibility are
important; I'm looking forward to
the first America's queer president, too. But until then, for me,
gay liberation is part of a broader
struggle for peace and justice.
Sexuality isjust one among many
dimensions of oppression. Like
everyone else, I want to be "the
best in the world" at what I do.
But I want to live in the best possible world, too.

I don't at all mean to dis all
entertainment journalism, because I think there are plenty of
insightful and interesting stories
being written (although I have
yet to see any on TV shows like
"Entertainment Tonight" or the
fluff that makes up "E!") Also,
I enjoy fluffpieces just as much
as (okay, probably more) than
the next person. It can be fun to
read about a star's life or the
Oscar race sometimes. It's always good to remember, however, just what it is that you're
getting when you read about
Oprah's struggle to bring "Beloved" to the screen: an ad. If,
like me, you even want to pretend that there's something substantive and worthwhile about
the world of entertainment,
you'd best keep your wits about
you, lest you confirm
Hollywood's belief about what
your head is filled with:
Do I really need to say it?

Tideâ€™s strong effort fails to overcome slump
by J.P. Harris

Staff Writer
It

happens

inevitably

around this time every year. The

Garnet Tide takes the field not
only facing that given week's
opponent, but also facing a week
of sleepless nights and midterms. Muhlenberg, 0-3 in the
Centennial Conference, represented an opponent Swarthmore
could challenge. The Mules ultimately wore down the Tide to
the final score of 41-6.
Despite the drizzling rain,
Swarthmore jumped out to an
early lead over the Mules. Start-

ing on their own 21 yard line,
the Tide marched to the
Muhlenberg 4. Donovan
Goodly 'O2 finished things off,
bowling over two Mules to cross
the goal line. After that touchdown, however, the Tide's offense was impotent. Goodly
found little running room and
finished the day with 62 yards
on 19 carries. Quarterback Scott
Murray 'Ol completed 16 of 28
passes for 155 yards, but the offense turned the ball over six
times. Senior widereceiver Mason Tootell sparked the offense
with six catches for 49 yards.
With the offense surrender-

ing the ball six times, the defense faced a difficult task in
stopping the Mules. The defense kept the Mules to two
scores in the first half, allowing
the Tide to enter the locker room
trailing merely 14-6. But the
persistent Muhlenberg ground
game wore on the defense. Despite the adverse conditions,
Tony Hillery 'Ol captured 14
tackles to lead the Tide. Once
again, Tony Skiadas '99 caused
problems for the opposing offense, and freshman Jon Bartner
tormented opposing ball carriers.
The Tide enjoyed a bye
week during break, and the team

used the time to prepare for its
next opponent, the Red Devils
of Dickinson. Just as history
suggests that the team will come
out flat during midterms, history
may also suggest a good showing against the Red Devils. In
1995, the Tide rebounded after
a miserable loss to Hobart during midterms to defeat
Dickinson the following week.
With a week and a half to prepare for the Devils, the Tide
looks to relive its last Centennial Conference win and gain
some momentum as it faces the
cream of the Conference in the
next few weeks.

15-1, 15-4, 15-7.

Under first-year coach Shawn Ferris, the

bettered last year's record by a game or two.
Ferris graduated from West Chester University with a B.A. in History and is hoping to pursue his Masters in the fall at either West Chester
in Sports Administration or Drexel University in
History.
Ferris brings a strong background in coaching, having coached soccer at Valley Forge Military Academy, a local junior college. In addition, he coaches some of the best kids in the country on the club level out of Downingtown/Delco.
Currently, he is working in Wilmington as a
juvenile probation officer in addition to his duties as head women's soccer coach. Ferris continues to play soccer regularly, though certainly
not as often as he would like. He competes in
men's leagues to stay in touch with the game as
a player.
Stressing the basics with his team, Ferris allows the players to get a feel for the how the
game of soccer should be played. He also emphasizes the fun in the sport. His positive attitude and past experience have helped the Swat
team grow into a more organized, cohesive unit
on the field.
About this team, Ferris said, "They are the
nicest group ofplayers. Each ofthem has worked
hard and has a great attitude."
As the team's improved record demonstrates,
Shawn Ferris has proved a successful and welcome addition to the Swarthmore women's soccer program.

dropped two key matchups

against the ranked teams of
Ithaca and Messiah in the last
two weeks.
The Garnet now has an
overall record of 9-4 and a 41 record in the Centennial
Conference and anticipates
postseason play.
The Garnet traveled to
Ithaca, N.Y., at the beginning
of break but failed to come
away with a win against
Ithaca. In fact, the team failed
to record a goal, the squad's
first shut-out since their firstround loss to Messiah two
years ago in the NCAA tournament.
The Garnet had hoped to
move up a slot in the regional
ranking with a victory. As of
October 19, Ithaca claims the
second spot in the North Atlantic region while the Garnet
rank fifth in the South Atlantic region.
This year, a change in
NCAA rules has occurred
which guarantees the top four
teams in each region a berth
in the national postseason
championship, giving Swarthmore a solid chance of making the playoffs.
The team was also overpowered 3-2 in overtime by
the Messiah Falcons, who are
ranked second in the South Atlantic region. The Falcons
were up 2-0 at the break, but
Lurah Hess '99 found the inside of the cage twice to tie it
up and to force an extra period.
Messiah scored off a penalty
stroke thirty seconds into OT
to earn the victory.
Although playing on turf,
the team was not out of its element for long.
"We had two intense practices on the turf at St. Joe's
which really prepared us," said

captain Holly Baker '99. "The
surface is difficult to adjust to
because the pace of the ball is
so different. We really worked
hard and with the exception of
some first half jitters, made the
transition very well."
The team experienced a
coach change over Fall Break
as Julie Mazer assumed head
coach responsibilities while
Karen Borbee is out on maternity leave.
"Julie has been in a strong
position of authority all season
and will continue to lead this
team," commented Baker.
"The team holds both Julie and
assistant coach Lisa Rubin [in]
high respect as individuals and
as coaches. Karen would be
very happy and proud of the
way Julie and Lisa conduct the
team."
The Garnet's hopes are
still alive for post-season activity. They have yet to face
the top-ranked regional team,

Rowan.

A win in that contest could

help boost their ranking. All
of the team's losses this year

have been against ranked
teams.

"The team is excited and
motivated about the remainder
of the season," said Baker.
"We see that our goal of making the NCAA playoffs is still
in reach, but we just have to
give that extra effort to get
there. Even if that goal is not
reached, this team has accomplished a lot this season and
we are very proud of our play
thus far."
The Garnet face the Johns
Hopkins Blue Jays in a crucial
match Saturday afternoon.
Swarthmore and Johns
Hopkins are tied for second
place in the conference behind
first-place Gettysburg.
The squad will close out
its regular season schedule
next week against Bryn Mawr
and Haverford.
