Krich wins award
for physics thesis
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

Jacob Krich 'OO was
awarded the Leroy Apker
Award for the best thesis at a
strictly-imdergi aduate college
by the American Physical So-

ciety earlier this month. The
prestigious award is offered
each year to two undergraduate students.
"I am honored and somewhat stunned to receive this
prize," said Krich, who is also

a Rhodes Scholar and is now
working towards a B.A. in
mathematics at Oxford University.

Of the two awards given
each year, one goes to a student
from a Ph.D.-granting institution and one goes to a student
from an institution which does
not grant Ph.D.s.
The awards are given to the
student with the best undergraduate physics thesis in each
category.
The Leroy Apker Award
aims to "recognize outstanding

achievements in physics by undergraduate students, and
thereby provide encouragement to young physicists who

have demonstrated great potentialfor future scientific accomplishment."
It was first awarded in 1978
in memory of physicist Leroy
Apker.

Krich's thesis, which was
completed during his time at
Swarthmore with the help of

Jacob Krich

physics department chair Peter Collings, was entitled "Correlation Length and Chirality
of Isotropic Short-Range Order

in Nematic and ChiralNematic

Liquid Crystals."
According to Collings,

"Jacob's research involved optical measurements of a phase
transition in a liquid crystal."
Collings added that such work
had never been done before.
"Jacob's thesis demonstrated superb mastery of not
just the experiments and the
methods of analysis but also
the underlying theory," he
said. "I was therefore not surprised thatthe judges were impressed."

Krich's award will consist
of $5OOO and an all-expensespaid trip to the meeting of the
American Physical Society in

March 2001, where he will be
awarded with a certificate honoring his work.
The Swarthmore Department of Physics and Astronomy will also receive $5OOO
to support undergraduate research.
Krich's achievement marks
the second time a Swarthmore
College student has received
the honor. Cameron Geddes '97
won the award in 1997.
According to Collings, this
places Swarthmore with
Harvard, Princeton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
California Institute of Technology and Stanford as the only
colleges in the country to have
produced more than one Leroy
Apker Award recipient.
Krich commented that it
was partially Geddes' prize that
inspired him to work towards
his thesis. "When I was a sophomore, I heard about Cameron
Geddes' winning, and it awed
me. It seemed like an amazing
prize, and I am glad to have
brought
it
back
to
Swarthmore," he said.
After completing his studies
in England, Krich plans to
work towards a Ph.D. in physics at Harvard.
Heather J. Lynch from
Princeton University and
Steven J. Oliver from the University of California at Berkeley, shared the award for students from a Ph.D.-granting institution.

Higher drink prices take effect
BY GERRIT HALL
The 25-cent price raise on canned and bottled
drinks in Essie Mae's snack bar has only been
in effect for three days, but some students are
already complaining about it.
"I think it sucks. A lot of people have budgeted their meals for the year, and it's going to
be hard for them because they didn'tknow about
this price change when they made their plans,"
said Roban Kramer 'O3.
Others expressed concern that the changes
have not been adequately publicized. Demetra
Ray 'Ol said that she was "shocked" when her
purchase from Essie Mae's required more points
than she was expecting. "I'm upset they raised
the price without letting us know," she said.
"They have to find a better way of informing
the student body," she added.
Soenda Howell 'Ol agreed. "I paid SL2S for
that? I didn't realize I was paying extra," she
said. A can of soda now costs an even dollar, and
bottled drinks are SL2S.
As ofTuesday evening, the price changes had
not been posted on the menu inside Essie Mae's.
They had been independently publicized in a
Phoenix article the week before and on The
Daily Jolt Web site. Marie Dalton, the manager
ofEssie Mae's, felt that this exposure was suffi-

cient and that it would not be immediately necessary to change the menu.
According to Linda McDougall, director of
Dining Services, prices were raised to counter
rising distribution prices for food. Over the summer, she said, she looked for a cheaper food vendor but found that the current distributor already offered the fairest prices.
"We were significantly over our budgeted
amount and we assessed that this had to do with
beverages as well as other packaged items," said
McDougall.

As meal credit equivalency was raised by 25
cents per meal earlier this year, with the price
increase students buying only one drink in Essie
Mae's on meal credit can still purchase the same
amount as last year.
But those who use meal credits or points to
buy several drinks at once to save for later are
hit much harder by the change.
"When I decided not to eat dinner, I'd grab

three or four cans of soda," said Ester Bloom
'O4. "It's f—ing annoying," she said of the change.
Other students wonder if the prices for a can
and bottle are reasonable.
"A dollar is pretty expensive. At the

The plan of Jared Solomon, right, and Horatiu Stefan to use the gameroom
space as a convenience store was one of three ideas approved by SC Monday.

Three gameroom
plans gain approval
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX
After postponing judgment on the
feasibility of gameroom proposals at an
earlier meeting, Monday night Student
Council approved all three plans for a
student referendum on the issue. Eight

ofnine council members in attendance
voted to approve the proposals, while
one member abstained.
At the council's last meeting before
break, several proposals for the space
in the basement of Tarble were voted
down because their advocates had misunderstood the need for a "rough estimate of the cost." As a result, some
groups created carefully itemized budgets, while others included only a skeleton budget. In the spirit of fairness,
the council gave the groups until after
fall break to revise and specify their
budget plans.

The Swarthmore College Computer
Society, the only group that won a
workability approval from the council
two weeks ago, made few changes to its
proposed budget, altering the cost of
some furniture items and recommending the purchase of a new projector.
The SCCS would use the gameroom
space for a Sun computer lab. This
would make it possible for students
who do not necessarily study computer
science to acquaint themselves with
and use the Unix operating system, said

SCCS member Steve Salter 'O2.
Tom Stepleton 'O2 spoke on behalf
of the SCCS at the meeting, pleading
with members of the council to take the
future ofhis group into serious consideration when deciding what to do with
the gameroom space. "We have our future riding on this space," he said. "The
campus has pretty much accommodated everyone else." The only other

chance for the SCCS lab to take up
shop, he said, would be if it were to
acquire space in Wharton.
Dave Thomas 'O2 presented the proposal for the Center for Activism and
Public Service. "Political activism is
a huge part of life at Swarthmore," he
said. "Lack of a common space for the
groups on campus ranges from shameful to disgraceful."
If the activist center were to take
over the gameroom, it would offer students a political library, a projects and
planning room, a political media center, and office space with security and
network jacks. The resources would be
available to all activist and service
groups on campus.
The third proposal, which envisions a convenience store in the old
gameroom space, was presented by
JaredSolomon 'Ol This would provide
students with a viable late-night dining option, which Student Councilhas
been pushing for in some form for several years.
Solomon suggested that the space
be split into a store, which would run
between the hours of 6 p.m. and 2 a.m.,
and a student lounge, which would be
open at all hours.
The convenience store would be
student-staffed and would offer premade sandwiches, pizza, drinks, frozen foods, toiletries, paper goods and
a selection of periodicals not available
elsewhere on campus.
Later during Monday's meeting,
however, SC discussed a proposal
made by Linda McDougall, director of
dining services, that Essie Mae's snack
bar remain open from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.
every night of the week. This would
essentially provide the same service as
the proposed convenience store.

MAN IN
BLUE

name: Joseph McGinnis
job: police officer
car number: 95
years on the force: 17

BY IVAN BOOTHE

dents "have been more frequent," he

He could be anyone out for a drive
on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The weather
is pleasant, the birds are singing, and the
streets are quiet. The difference, of
course, is that most drivers in
Swarthmore don't carry loaded guns.

"Swarthraore used to be a vacation
resort," he says. "And this house here,"
he says, pointing to a small cottage on
the corner, "used to be the water tower.
It was the highest point in the county."
"We used to hear pheasants cackling
up here," he says. "One year we saw a
fox, and by the next year, you didn't hear
the pheasants anymore." McGinnis also
describes how a tract of heavily wooded
land along Michigan Avenue is slated to
soon be cleared and developed. "They're
going to tear it all out and put in 45
homes," he says.
The best part of his job, he says, is
when he comes upon someone who is
hurt, and is able to help them. "I can
make them feel better, a little more at
ease untilthe emergency vehicles come,"
he says.
The car passes a man walking down

says.

As Officer Joseph McGinnis pulls his
police cruiser, car number 95, out of the
Swarthmore borough police station,
there is a slight breeze blowing, and the
leaves are swirling around the moving
car. A perfect day for a patrol.

McGinnis has been an officer with

the Swarthmore department since 1984.

"I'm from a long line of policemen," he
says. His father, grandfather, sister, and
two cousins have all been police officers.

He says that he "more or less grew
up here." He knows many of the residents of the town closely. "I might not
have been in 20 homes," he says.

Photos by Claire Weiss

McGinnis, who grew up in the Swarthmore area, comes from a family of
police officers and has been with the Borough police since 1984.

THE VERY FIRST CAR COMES ALONG AT A
SLOW PACE, THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY, QUITE
A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF THE STOP SIGN,
WHEN THE DRIVER SEES MCGINNIS. HE
CHUCKLES. "YOU CAN SEE THE NOSE OF
THEIR CAR DIP WHEN THEY SEE THE
POLICE CAR," HE SAYS.

The daily activities of a Swarthmore
police officer may not be as exciting as
NYPD Blue, but McGinnis is happy with
it. "Mostly," he says, "we sit back and
watch." Whether that is actively patrolling or sitting in a parking lot looking
for suspicious activity, McGinnis seems
to enjoy it all.
"You get to know who belongs
where," McGinnis says.
The police department answers 911
calls from many of the local boroughs,
including Swarthmore, Rutledge and
Morton, as well as assisting several surrounding communities with their calls.
During the day, officers frequently respond to home alarms and medical ambulance calls.
The department is also responsible
for a number of community programs,
such as an effort to improve home safety,
a program for senior citizens addressing
telephone scams, and Drug Awareness
and Resistance Education and "Good
Touch/Bad Touch" programs in the elementary schools.
The police department consists of the
chief, plus eight other officers, including two sergeants. McGinnis says that
despite its sleepy-village appearance,

Swarthmore does have its share of
crime. "We've had shootings
stabbings. It's just not as often. But it hap...

pens."

Excitement certainly factors into
McGinnis' love for the job. "There's
nothing like that feeling
apprehending a criminal. You get a real adrenaline
rush," he explains.
But in the 17 years he's been an officer, McGinnis has only had to fire his
gun once. "It was at a rabid raccoon,"
he says.
...

Around town

After pulling over a traffic violator, McGinnis returns to his cruiser to write
a citation.

"This town is where you come to retire," McGinnis says. The past few years,
however, have seen some changes. Inci-

the street, and McGinnis waves. "That
man there, I brought him back," he says.
He points to the man's house, describing how he helped the man recover after a heart attack.
At times, McGinnis is unsure if this
dedication is appreciated by the town.
"You feel like you're doing this job without being thanked," he says. A moment

later, however, he passes by a house
where he helped deliver a baby 10 years
ago.

His job is not always a joy. "Once I
came upon an infant that had died of
SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome],
about four months old. All I could think
about was that I delivered a baby into
this world... now I'm seeing one go out,"
he says.
On the college
On college security, McGinnis is
clear. "The college has their own security," he says. "We do have the authority and power," he says, but the police
department does not generally need to
exercise it. The infrequent occasions
when they do, he says, were in cases of
"serious criminal incidents," such as
the time that he was sent to campus
when a person committed suicide by
jumping in front of a train. Officers are
also periodically called in about theft
reports, and "when there's an assault,
[Public Safety] calls us right away," he
says.
Though he feels that Public Safety

can handle it, McGinnis is worried about
security on the college campus. Every
year, he says, the department gets calls
from students who had things stolen out
of their rooms. "When we talk to them,"
he says, "the door was left open and they
walked away. This is not home."
As for more serious crimes, he says,
"If you see something, you need to call
us right away." McGinnis says that in
the past, some people have come forward
days afterward to report a crime.

McGinnis' first line of communication is the police radio in his cruiser.

McGinnis records license information from a traffic violator
He passes a set of white lines painted on the road and points to them.
"Any time you see those, there's probably a police car with a stopwatch
nearby," he says. Radar guns are used only by state police, he says, and
even then only occasionally.
As a demonstration, he parks his police car facing out of the north
parking lot of the train station, in front of a pair of the white lines. As
each car drives by, he hits the stopwatch when their front wheels pass
the first line, and then again as they pass the second. Several cars go by
at various speeds, all over the posted 35 mile per hour speed limit. "Usually we give them at least 15 miles over," he says.
A woman in a station wagon drives by, her ear clamped to a cellular
phone. "Now see, she was doing 47," McGinnis says. "Was she paying
attention or what? She didn't even see me."
Usually, the criminals that McGinnis deals with are from outside the
community. Every once in a while, however, "you get a smart aleck who

thinks he can get away with a lot of stuff," McGinnis says, because the
criminalknows the neighborhood.
Swinging around the overpass next to the train station, he nearly hits
two women crossing the road. "That's it, ladies," he mutters. "Don't use
the crosswalk."
"You know," he says, "you feel at ease [in Swarthmore], but you still
have to have awareness."
He passes near the Mary Lyons dorm and waves at some Swarthmore
residents walking by. "You know," he says, "some people look at you like
they're really miserable."
Cop in action

McGinnis addresses some of the problems Swarthmore has had over
the years, such as a group of Neo-Nazis that came onto the college campus in the mid-80's. After a brief altercation, he says, the group never
returned. "If you leave well enough alone," he says, "sometimes it'll go
away."

He describes some of the issues he's had with town youth. "Their
thinking is sometimes—" he trails off. "They're pretty normal," he finishes. He says he does sometimes question their respect, however. "Do I
look like I eat doughnuts?" he jokes.
McGinnis' discussion moves into alcohol use in town and at the college. "If you're a first-time offender, and you get caught, you can be recommended for a task force," he says, referring to a program that underage drinkers with no previous violations can opt into. "Otherwise," he
says, "you can lose your license. And Pennsylvania is reciprocal with
most other states, so if you're arrested here, guess what? You lose your
license where you live ... Mom and Dad are still here riding around in
these police cars."
As we pass an imposing stone house on the right, McGinnis says, "in
the middle of the night, we do property checks every once in a while.
Especially the expensive ones. Some of the insides of these places are
incredible." Protection, of course, is his first priority. "We check to see if
anybody's rooting through it," he says.
The woman on the police radio comes on with a message for him to
call someone, "My girlfriend," he says. "She's a dispatcher in Spring-

field."
He pulls up to the stone edifice labeled "Swarthmore Hills" and
watches a four-way stop intersection. The very first car comes along at a
slow pace, then stops abruptly, quite a few feet in front of the stop sign,
when the driver sees McGinnis. He chuckles. "You can see the nose of
their car dip when they see the police car," he says.

The next
few cars stop, although a few of
them are more of a

rolling

stop.

MCGINNIS HAS ONLY HAD
TO FIRE HIS GUN ONCE.
"IT WAS AT A RABID
RACCOON/' HE SAYS.

McGinnis is incredulous at what he calls the
"California" stops. "Even
when I'm here," he says.
"I'm giving them a whole
half of a car to see me."
McGinnis, however, seems
to want some action. "I'll just
back up here," he says, pulling behind a large tree. In underfive seconds, a red Suburban runs straight
through the stop sign, without slowing down. "Oh, that's one," he says.
"We're going after him."
He darts out onto the main road, and
the police cruiser is peaking at 60 miles per
hour as it charges after the truck. McGinnis
turns on his lights and pulses his siren a few
times. Just in front of a railroad crossing, the
Suburban stops.
McGinnis gets out of the police car and walks
up to the driver's window. Returning to the car a
few moments later, he calls the man's license information in on the radio.
A train rumbles past behind us, and McGinnis sits
down to write out the citation. "These things, they take
forever to write," he says. The man receives a fine of over

ninety dollars.
The dispatcher callsback the information on the radio: the
man is clear. McGinnis gets out of the police car again to give
the ticket to the man.
Usually, he says, he's willing to give people a little leeway. "If I
find myself doing it sometimes," he says, "I'll just give them a warning." However, "this was such a blatant thing."

I

Uniform humor
"Sometimes, I'll pull people over that I haven't seen in years. I'll use
my arms when I'm talking, so it looks like I'm yelling," McGinnis says.
"People passing look and they say, 'Wow, he's really giving them hell.'"
As we sit an intersection, a truck with a camper on it passes by, with
words written in large block letters covering the back of it. "Why protect a
sadist?" it asks. "Does your police department have the credibility of a ghetto
pimp? Your tax dollars at work." McGinnis pulls out of the intersection to follow
the vehicle.
"I'm just glad your truck is up to date, there, Buckwheat," McGinnis says. "Now,
if I pulled him over, he'd sue for harassment."
As we go under the train station for a third and final time, McGinnis mentions two
serious accidents on Chester Road, one involving a woman who had a heart attack in her
car, the other a driver who drove up the side of the embankment and slammed into the side
of the underpass.
Coupled with the message on the back of the truck, this could be saying something. Perhaps the sleepy village of Swarthmore may not be able to shut out the rest of the world forever

When homework is a week on the beach
BY JONATHAN EHRENFELD

Ask many of the students ofProfessor Rachel Merz's marine biology
class what they did over break and
you won't get the typical "I went
home and slept" reply. The class
spent a week on a lush island refuge largely uninhabitedby humans.
On the first Saturday ofOctober
break, much of the class flew down
to Florida and then traveled to Cedar Key, an island off the coast of
Florida in the northern part of the
Gulf of Mexico, to experience first-

hand the habitats and organisms
discussed in class.
The trip was funded by alumni

donations and facilitated by the
University of Florida, which owns
the only two structures on Cedar
Key
a laboratory for the
university's marine biology studies
and a lighthouse which doubles as
a residence. The students slept on
bunks in the 149-year-old lighthouse.
According to Merz and participant Hunter Wells 'O2, the majority
of the time in Florida was spent outside, observing a variety of marine
habitats.

On one side of the key was a

seagrass meadow featuring hundreds of species of floral and faunal
marine life.

On another side of the island was
a mangrove swamp, which the
group explored in canoes. Mangroves are one of the few trees
adapted to living in saltwater conditions and are not found north of

the key, according to Merz.
In addition to being a shelter for
marine life, Cedar Key is also a national wildlife refuge and a haven
for myriad sea and land bird species.
According to Wells, the water held

sharks, dolphins, urchins and

a vast

array of fish, while the trees were
home to thousands of birds.

Two students take advantage of
the week-long field trip to relax.

Because the trip was optional,
the entire class did not go to Florida.
Most did, however, and the response
to the trip was overwhelmingly positive.
"In general, everyone was
thrilled," Wells said. Only the "rustic" living conditions and biting flies
on the beach elicited any grumbling,
he added.
There was no set schedule or
plan of activitiesfor the majority of

a trip that was at once informative

CJC rules on plagiarism cases
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

Earlier this month, the College
Judiciary Committee considered
three cases ofacademic dishonesty
in courses taken last school year.
The student in thefirst case was
found guilty of plagiarism on a final project and on another assignment. The committee suspended the
student, whohad copied workfrom
other students, for next semester
and recommended the student receive no credit for the course.
The second case involved two
studentswhosetake-home portions
of a final exam were similar. According to testimony in the case, the
professor had instructed students
not to communicate about the exam,
yet because one student had left

campus without his exam, he called

another student who had already
turned in the exam to find out what
the questions were. The committee
felt that more information passed
between the students than was appropriate and found both students
guilty of academic misconduct, recommending that they have theirfinal course grades lowered by one
full letter and that the student who
solicited informationreceive a zero
on his final exam.
In the third case, a student was
found guilty ofplagiarism in a final
paper for a seminar. The paper contained verbatim passages not put in
quotation marks and improper citations ofparaphrases. The committee recommended that the student
receive no credit for the seminar.

Solomon proposes
honor code
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

Student Council discussed the possibility of implementing an academic honor code at Swarthmore during Monday night's meeting, resolving to take the issue to the student body.
Jared Solomon 'Ol put forward the idea for a code,
asserting that "academics at Swarthmore are of primary importance, yet there is no understanding about
issues of academic integrity."
He claimed that most students are simply told by
the faculty during the first week of their first year,
albeit forcefully, not to plagiarize or cheat. Solomon's
proposal stated that, with the passage of an honor code,
"academic honesty would take a place of greater importance on Swarthmore's campus."
His vision of an academic honor code includes self-

proctored exams taken over two weeks and a spring
term thatwould consequently be shortened by the same
amount of time. Administration would be enacted by
the College Judiciary Committee, which would hold
trials for students accused of violating the code.
All students would consent to uphold the standards
of the code upon matriculation at the college. Students
would be "urged but not obligated to report breaches
of the code," according to the proposal.
Unlike the honor code at Haverford, the

Swarthmore code would take on no social aspect and
would not be as "invasive," in Solomon's words, as
Haverford's code. For example, students would not be
required to cite peers who assisted them on homework
assignments.

such as this one is important for students who have been studying biology for a while. "I think that, for a
lot of biologists, trips like these re
ally cement their sense of wanting
to be a biologist," she said.
In the past, Merz has arranged
trips to Puerto Rico, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Woods Hole,
Mass. "I very much enjoy going in
the field with students," she said.

Student Council supported consideration of the
honor code but decided that "it might have to be put
up to referendum because it is bigger than ourselves
as a body," said co-chair JordanBrackett 'Ol. The Council plans to follow up on Solomon's proposal by sponsoring a fireside chat on the subject.

VOTER GUIDE
novation
What's all this referendum business? Over the summer, pool tables were moved from the former gameroom space in
the basement of Tarble into the lounge on the first floor. Now, that part of the building's basement is empty and is
awaiting renovation by the college into more student space. Students submitted to Student Council three proposals for
potential uses of the space. The council will hold a campuswide referendum on Nov. 1-3, to let students choose between
the proposals. Here, to help you vote, are summaries of each plan, each published exactly as written by its backers.

An activist space
Although student activism has been an important part
of Swarthmore since its founding, and although it
continues to be vibrant and growing force at the school,
there is currently no space on campus for activists to call
their own. Having this kind of space has proved
invaluable for the various student groups housed in the
BCC, IC, WRC, Bond, Fraternities, Parrish, and Tarble. For
years, the many different Swarthmore activist groups
have wanted rooms for themselves. This proposal
provides for all of these groups' (and potential future
groups') needs in a single, efficiently organized, space.
Picture it: Activists from the left, right, and in between
toting and quoting the gospel according to Matthew, Karl,
Che, Bill, Newt, and Ayn all in Tarble basement!
This unlikely coalition wants to renovate the former
gameroom to provide:
■ Common space for inter-group coordination,
meeting, organizing, researching, and sharing information
both among ourselves and with the larger student body.
■ Long-term institutional memory and organizational
support through an office complete with file cabinets,
computers (with printer), desks, and telephones.
■ An information resource center/publications library
housing activist and political publications from across the
country & world and from across the political spectrum.
■ A refurbished media center with more comfortable
seating for TV and video screenings by both activists and
the larger campus community.
■ An additional space open to the entire Swarthmore

community.
This proposal will serve the needs of the many campus
activist groups such as: College Democrats, College
Republicans, Swarthmore Progressive Action Coalition,

Just Cause, Earthlust, ADVICE, Swarthmore Conservative
Union, Amnesty International, Animal Rights Coalition,
SPEEC, Empty the Shelters, Feminist Majority, Conscious
Consumers, Swarthmore Students Advocating Life,
Swarthmore Pro-Choice Task Force, and Swarthmore
Objectivist Society. It will also serve individual students
interested in activism, but unaffiliated with any particular
group.

S.Wa-Wa: store,
late-night food
The Problem:
Everyone knows that finding late night food on
campus is a problem: Scrounging for food in the vending
machines, waiting for cold pizza, or begging friends or
strangers for a morsel. Some of us even gnaw on our
chairs.
The Solution:
Our proposal, S.Wa-Wa, targets the average
Swarthmore student's late night needs. For headaches,
hunger, or hangovers, S.Wa-Wa is the key.
The Details:
We propose to transform the game-room area into a
lounge and convenience store, providing a variety of
food items and sundries (which are currently not
available to students) as well as a small space to read,
relax, and have a cup of coffee. Our initial ideas include:
snacks, hot and cold beverages, ice cream, packaged
sandwiches, cereals, soft pretzels, fruit, hot dogs, frozen
foods, pizza, milk, toiletries, periodicals, and other
necessities. To determine what goods will be provided,
we intend to survey students.
Our hope is to have this operation student run,
therefore adding more work study options. Preliminary
hours of operation are 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 am.
The Bottom Line:

Vote S.Wa-Wa for food, living essentials, and so much
more.

SCCS: State-of-art
'media lounge'
The SCCS has a plan for Tarble Basement. We call it
the Media Lounge.

Don't be fooled by our name. The Media Lounge is no
nerd bunker. We're not going to make just another place
for writing papers or surfing the web. We're not here to
promote e-this or cyber-that. The Media Lounge is
something that doesn't exist in any college in the nation
a powerful 'creative lens' that gives you or your group the
tools and expertise to do some of the things you've only
dreamed of doing. It's also a place for some serious fun.
Here is the recipe:
■ Start with a conference table and whiteboard in the
main part of the game room to create a great space for all
students and student groups to meet, study, and hang
out.

■ Put nine computer workstations in the windowed
space next door, one with advanced video editing
technology.
■ Add two workgroup-class printers, one monochrome,
one color, and a quality color scanner.
■ Place a video projector and screen in the small
theatre room for multimedia viewing and immersive video

games.
■ Rescue the SCCS servers from their dilapidated
housing on Parrish sth and place them in the room next

door.

■ Add special hardware you can borrow for your
projects, including a high-quality digital camera and a
digital camcorder.
■ Add the security systems necessary to keep the
space open as late as Public Safety will allow.
■ Sprinkle fun gadgets and nifty brainy toys around
the space to taste.
■ Finally, add the most vital ingredient: a staff eager,
nay, exuberant about helping you use all this stuff to
achieve things you only dreamed of doing.
Ever thought about using video to get your message
out? Filming a part of your college experience (e.g. a play,
a demonstration, an event) you want to share with the
world? We have the equipment to do this (on a Swattie's
schedule, even!) but no place to put it. Ever thought about
publishing an organizational newspaper or magazine with
color photos and fancy layout? Thousands of dollars of
SBC funding has bought the gear to get you started, but
right now it's out of reach. Want to document yourself,
your projects, or your group online? We've got cameras,
scanners, and references to help you out now under
lock and key. Ever imagined playing Play Station 2 games
on a six foot screen? With the Media Lounge, barring a
supply shortage from Japan, you won't be dreaming. Just
want to chill and study in a place that's not your room?
You can do that too. There's so much we could do if only
we had the space.
The SCCS Media Lab isn't a computer lab. It's not a
space for the SCCS to house its stuff or develop its own
agenda. It's a place for you to create and nurture ideas, to
turn dreaming into doing, to get the resources to help you
(in the words of Steve Jobs) "make a dent in the
Universe." Please, with your vote, help us give
Swarthmore students, groups, faculty and staff a unique
and powerful tool unavailable at any college in the nation.

EDITORIAL

Alcohol and the SAF
Let's not fool ourselves: alcohol is a fact of college life.
Wait scratch that. Let's try something a little more
specific: Free alcohol at free SAC-funded parties is a fact
ofSwarthmore life.
There. We said it. That's right a little bit of the
Student Activities Fee (SAF) each year goes toward
buying alcohol for Swarthmore students, most of whom
are underage. You know what? It's an excellent system.
For those who don'tknow how the system works,
here's an explanation. The college has decided to treat
students as responsible adults and allow them to make
decisions about drinking for themselves. Students took
advantage of this freedom and created a socioeconomicaUy equitable way for people to have fun free parties,
funded by the SocialAffairs Committee (SAC). And
college parties have alcohol.
This admittedly lax policy is a good thing. Students
have a safe, open drinking environment on campus,
avoiding dangerous driving situations and the perils of
drinking alone. Party organizers can cut off the alcohol
supply to individuals who have had enough to drink.
Most importantly, the alcohol policy creates a culture of
enjoyment rather than the culture ofabuse found on
most college campuses
Swarthmore has far fewer
alcohol problems than most stricter colleges.
Unfortunately, this system is illegal in the state of
Pennsylvania. By using money collected by the college
(the SAF) to pay for alcohol consumed by underage

students, students make the college liable for what
happens at SAC-funded parties. If a student injures or
kills himself, the college risks a lawsuit.
In the past the college turned a blind eye to the
system. The administration didn't "know" SAF funds
were used to buy alcohol. But when the deans became
aware of the receipt forgery that kept the system under
the table, they couldn't ignore the situation.
Nobody student or administrator wants to
change the drinking culture here. And despite the
changes proposed by the Deans' Advisory Council,
nobody likely will. The current system is too good, too
roundly appreciated by the students not to evolve. If it
isn't forging receipts, it will be something else
students here are too smart not to skirt token rules to
get what they want.
Is there any good solution to this dilemma? Not
really. Part of the Swarthmore alcohol policy will always
be the silly but intricate dance between students and
administrators both trying to preserve our culture, at
least until Pennsylvania lowers the drinking age to 18.
And that will happen, well, as soon as Swarthmore
doesn't have alcohol at parties.

Zero-sum gameroom
About this time a year ago, Student Council was planning therenovation ofSharpies m. The building near Olde
Club and the fraternities was in pretty sorry shape at the
time, but thanks to cooperation between the council and
administrators notably Vice President for Facilities and
Services Larry Schall students had the opportunity to
vote on proposals to improve it. Voting was close; the suggestion for a student art gallery received only about 80 more
votes than the SCCS's proposal for a computer lab.
In a week, students will beasked to choose among three
excellent proposals forrenovation of the former gameroom
space in the basement of Tarble. The SCCS is submitting a
"media lounge" proposal similar to its suggestion from last
year; the other two ideas are to create a space for campus
activist groups or to establish a student-run convenience
store open until 2 a.m.
But if last year's referendum is any indication, it may
be a difficult task to choose among the proposals. They are
all serious proposals, unlike the idea last year for a "men's
resource center," so it's a shame that only one group can
win the coveted scarce space. Therefore, while we thank
the administration andStudent Council for doing what they
can with what we have now, we again express our hope for
the sakeofSwat students years in thefuture that there will
be much more student space created as part ofthe campus's
long-term plans, such as the upcoming renovation ofParrish.

LETTER

Lives of the homeless no weekend vacation
Dear Editor:
A group of students on my hall spent
two nights in Philadelphia over break,
sleeping on the streets, in a worthless
attempt to understand the plight of the
city's homeless. Upon their return, my
other hallmates gushed, running to them
to hear of their experience, to enrich
themselves with the newfound wisdom.
They said it was respectable because
it forced the Swatties involved to come
out of themselves enough to appreciate
the situations of the less fortunate. I say
there's nothing respectable about making a blatant mockery of a group of
people who have lost their lives to the
streets, who have spent their lives struggling to stay alive.
First and foremost, the students' ex-

periment was a total waste of time. The
two nights they spent sleeping on the
streets of Philadelphia brought them no
closer to understanding the position of

the homeless than the students had previously been. They couldn't have.
After all, they knew that they'd eventually have a warm place to which they'd
return. They knew that, if things got really bad, they could whip out their credit

cards and feed themselves, or, better,
pack up and take SEPTA home.

keep herself warm, thinking about
the children she turned over to the
state because she knew they'd at least

wasn't permanent directly negated anything they may have learned about the
homeless experience because theirs
didn't approximate the homeless experience because, well, they're neither
homeless nor struggling and no amount
of pretend play could ever produce a
genuine understanding of a true, life-affecting experience.
For this very reason, the experiment
was not only worthless, but also downright offensive. These students, probably
without realizing it, made a complete
mockery of the homeless folks they
joined on the streets for those two nights.
It's not recreation, guys; it's life. It's
not a fun Friday night activity, and it
sure isn't something you gather a group
of your friends and decide to do. It's a
lousy way to spend your life, and certainly not a conscious decision.
I wonder if the students realized, lying in their North Face sleeping bags on
the streets, how it must have felt to be
the woman next to them, huddled over
the sidewalk grate, desperately trying to

be fed.
I wonder if they considered the re-

That the kids knew that the situation

action ofthe men, veterans ofthe street,
who'd spent half their lives there with
nothing but a few scars and bad cases
of anemia to show for it. I wonder if
they thought at all about how it would
feel to be homeless, to deal day in and
day out with the shit thrown them by
the government, society, and life, only
to find yourself lying in the gutter next
to a group of giggling college kids who
think it'llbe great fun to entertain and
educate themselves with a world opposite Swat.
In essence, what this group of students did is degrading, to themselves,
to the very people they were trying
to better understand, to the
Swarthmore community at large. It
was a shallow and thoughtless move
that I'd expect from curious high
schoolers, but certainly not from a

supposedly educated, socially sensi-

tive group like us.

IN
PUBLIC
When Jimmy Carter debated Ronald Reagan in 1980, 80
million people watched. When Al Gore and George W. Bush
confronted each other three times over the last month, they
were only once lucky enough to get half as many people
tuning in.
So it wouldn't surprise me if a few of you missed the
recent political showdowns. It certainly wouldn't surprise
me if a few of you are glad you missed them. The New York
Times' Maureen Dowd called the Oct. 5 battle the debate
between the Insufferable and the Insufficient. (You can
match the candidate to his nickname on your own.)
Here, then, is an overview of the 2000 presidential debate scene.

Debate No. 1: Oct. 3, 2000
Al Gore confidently strolls on stage with an 11-point lead
over Bush in the polls. This debate is podium-style with
Jim Lehrer as moderator, and Bush has said he prefers sitdown "discussions" with moderators more like Larry King.
He's had trouble in the past few weeks with such fundamental basics as, say, pronouncing words. Maybe this is
what he means by the "soft bigotry of low expectations."
The debate begins. Questions focus on tax cuts, Social
Security, Medicare. Jim Lehrer tries a question about
Serbia, but Bush mispronounces "Milosevic" and Gore pedantically informs us that Yugoslavia is what "they call
Serbia plus Montenegro."
The candidates repeat themselves. The candidates repeat themselves.

Bush accuses Gore of using "fuzzy math" on four separate occasions. He says the word "Washington" 11 times;
Gore says it once.
The Gore-bot promises to put Social Security in a "lock
box." Seven times. At one point he even promises it will be
an "ironclad lock box." He is so eager to beat up on his
feeble opponent that in the "Saturday Night Live" skit that
weekend mocking the debate, Gore asks if he can give two

Debate roundup (or, please
pass the remote control)
closing statements. Gore's aides make him watch it in preparation for the second debate.
When George Bush speaks, Al Gore sighs audibly. Very
audibly. "Under the debate rules, we were told there was going to be no coverage of our reactions when the other guy was
talking," he snaps during an interview later.
The next day, Gore's lead in the polls evaporates. By the
end of the week, Bush is ahead by 7 points.

[BUSH HAS] HAD SOME TROUBLE THE PAST

FEW WEEKS WITH SUCH FUNDAMENTAL
BASICS AS, SAY, PRONOUNCING WORDS.
MAYBE THIS IS WHAT HE MEANS BY THE
"SOFT BIGOTRY OF LOW EXPECTATIONS."
Debate No. 2: Oct. IX 2000
More along the lines of W.'s Larry King dream-debate, this
venue has the candidates sitting next to each other at a table
with the omnipresent JimLehrer tossing questions.
The word on the street (read: focus groups, talking heads)
is that Al "I want to sigh for you" Gore lost the first debate by
being too aggressive and showing off all his knowledge. Sort
oflike the impatient first-grader who doesn't have any friends
because he raises his hand in class too much.
So at this debate, Gore looks drugged. He says he agrees
with Bush, even when Bush is incoherent. He even apologizes
for his story in the last debate about the little girl who had to
stand in an overcrowded classroom (turns out she was only
standing for a day).
Bush shifts uneasily when the issue of hate crimes legislation comes up. He did not support hate crimes legislation in
Texas, even after a high-profile racially motivated murder of
a black man. "The three men who murdered James Byrd,
guess what's going to happen to them?" Bush says defensively,

getting all excited. "They're going to be put to death!"
Gore says politely that the Unites States is the "natu-

ral" leader ofthe world. And, he adds later, he doesn't think
that it is an exaggeration to say that all the other countries
in the world want to be just like us. He wants to list all the
other countries, but the second dose of tranquilizers are
kicking in for Al and for the rest of the country.
Debate No. 3: Oct. 17, 2000

Gore's polling numbers remain abysmally low; he is now
trailing by 10 points or more. The pundits say he was too
mean in the first debate and too nice in the second. Bush's
advisers say they are looking forward to the final debate,
but they aren't sure which Al Gore will be showing up.
Aggressive Al shows up, though he leaves his sighs behind. Instead, he anxiously blurts "My turn!" when W. stops
talking, and it's town-hall, walk-around-the-stage format
this time he makes a feeble attempt at relegating Bush
to a far corner of the stage withhis choreographed, robotic
walking patterns.
Bush winks a lot and tries to impress us all by using the
word "peroration." Jim Lehrer laughs at him. Then Bush
accuses Gore of using "an old high school debating trick."
Gore retaliates: "This election isn't about high school
debating tricks, it's about your future." What he means, of
course, is that it is about old high school debating tricks.
By this point the TV networks have become obsessed
with assembling "focus groups" after each debate to see
what "real people" think. The only problem is that each
focus group consists entirely of voters from a swing state

who are "undecided" between Gore and Bush.
Said one: "Al Gore's tedious. He makes me twitch."
Folks, "undecided" at this point is quickly converging
with "unintelligent." If you don't decide soon, we may all
end up twitching, and with a very long peroration. And
when the debate comes on for the next election, I'll be watching "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."

LEŢER

Students need to be aware of online copyright policy
Dear Editor:
I write to inform you of the College's
obligations under the U.S. Digital
Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) to act
against alleged copyright infringements

by community members using our elec-

tronic network. This has become a realtime issue, because in the last month the
Recording Industry Association of
America, Inc. (RIAA) has made such allegations against two Swarthmore students,
and we have had to take action.
The DMCA was enacted in 1998, in part
to deal with a situation everyone is aware
of: the Internet makes it very easy to violate copyright; you just need a networked
computer, not a publishing or recording
house. Of course, not everyone regards
this situation as a problem; the internet
is also an opportunity to enhance the free
flow of information. The fact is, however,
that some sorts of information are protected by copyright; the internet does not
change this right but does make it harder
to protect. Swarthmore College is committed to upholding the laws of the land,
whether or not it likes them.
Since it is very hard for copyright holders to sue thousands of individual computer users, there is a temptation to sue
the online service providers (OSPs), such
as colleges or AOL. DMCA provides some
protection to OSPs from such suits, but
in turn it requires them to take certain
actions on behalf of copyright holders who
allege infringements.
Below is a rough summary of the steps

IN SUMMARY, WHEN WE
RECEIVE A COMPLAINT IN A
CERTAIN PRESCRIBED FORM
ABOUT A SITE ON OUR
NETWORK, WE MUST INFORM
THE PERSON RUNNING THAT
SITE OF THE COMPLAINT, AND
ASK THIS PERSON TO TAKE
OFF THE OFFENDING MATERIAL
OR MAKE CLAIM WITHIN
THREE DAYS THAT S/HE IS NOT
VIOLATING COPYRIGHT.
we will take when infringements are alleged.
Please refer to the official document
"Swarthmore College Copyright Policies" for
the exact procedure, available at http://
www.swarthmore.edu/Library/
campuspolicies/copyright.html, where the
DMCA policy is in the last section. In summary, when we receive a complaint in a certain prescribed form about a site on our network, we must inform the person running
that site of the complaint, and ask this person to take off the offending material or make
claim within three days that s/he is not violating copyright. Absent such removal or
claim, the college has 10 days to remove or
block the offending material. If a claim of fair
use is made, but the copyright holder is not

convinced, the copyright holder then may

sue the claimant, but not the college. The penalties for false claims are extremely severe.
Note that the DMCA does not require the
college to police the Internet activities of its
faculty, staff or students. It only requires that
the college respond in specified ways when
evidence of infringing activity is brought to
its attention. However, the DMCA does allow
a copyright holder to be aggressive in bringing information to our attention, and clearly
the RIAA has chosen to be aggressive. It will
save Swarthmore College members a lot of
grief if they inspect their sites and remove
materials which they see to be in violation
of copyrights.
A word about the Swarthmore College
Copyright Policies at the URL given above:
this is the official college copyright protection policy. It is primarily about what constitutes fair use of copyrighted material in
teaching, research and projects. For instance,

it has been fair use to photocopy an article for a class or to show an art slide to
a class, but is it fair use today for a faculty member or a student to put these
things on an unpassworded course Web
site, where everyone in the world can look
at it? We urge all members of the community to at least skimthe entire document.
The document refers to a college "designated agent" to whom all complaints under DMCA are to be addressed. That officer is Judy Downing, Director of Information Technology Services (ITS, formerly the Computing Center). The college
officer in charge of copyright questions
generally is Peggy Seiden, the College

in one sitting (sorry, Ilya)?
■ Do you want to spend ten minutes trying to kill
a bug of unknown species with your left slipper, which
you're afraid to do because of the distinct possibility
that the bug may be composed of a substance so hard
that it a) will not be crushed by the plastic sole and
b) will likely eat said plastic sole?
■ Are you ready to pine?
■ Are you ready to have conversations that consist entirely in lines from Ron Howard movies and
Conan O'Brien-era "Simpsons" episodes?
■ Are you ready to embrace more doublespeak
than George Orwell, in his most violent nightmare,
thought capable?
■ Can you satisfy yourself with old books, young
girls, tired professors, long nights, endless readings,
maddening discussions that make you long to ask how
many angels fit on the head of a pin, and hanging onto
it all your own talisman?

Then college is for you. Look at this tangle of thorns.

Missile defense a poor
choice in shrinking world
The American government's proposed Strategic
Defense Initiative may leave the rest of the
world hurt and standing out in the cold
BY DANN NASEEMULLAH
I like America, or else I wouldn't be
here. I like the friends that I've made, I
like the beauty ofmulticolored autumn
in the northeastern United States, and
I frankly like the values and ideals that
American society holds proud. I do not,
however, like U.S. foreign policy, as the

almighty "best and brightest" at the
State Department usually have no clue
what they are doing messing around
with the rest of the world.
OK, so maybe that's a little harsh.
Recent policies, however, make me
wonder, especially the proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).
Missile defense, in theory, would
not be such a bad idea. In theory. However, much as I like political theory
(read: escapism), the real outcomes
from this policy are dire enough to
make implementation a very bad idea.
Yet the State Department and the
Pentagon are laying layer upon layer
upon layer of stupidity in trying to justify a fundamentally flawed policy. Allow me to illustrate.
I have it on good authority from respectable Swarthmore engineering
sources that missile defense simply
will not work, given our current level
of technology. The technical dynamics
of the system are mind-boggling.
An incredibly complex radar-based
surveillance system needs to be able to
notice and recognize a hostile ballistic
missile from effectively anywhere on
Earth, and then shoot a counter missile to hit it directly and blow it out of
the skies. The probability of two objects, both moving faster thanthe speed
of sound, hitting each other is not overwhelmingly high.
Giventhe extraordinary uncertainties that make even the most rigorous
mathematical modeling hit or miss,
missile defense is not likely to produce
great results. This has been nicely
proven by the Pentagon's well-publicized yet dismal track record at even
the most elementary tests, which do not
even take into account any counter-

measures.
Missile defense, however, would be
an incredibly stupid idea even if it were
technologically flawless; there are actually other countries in the world that
have opinions on this.
First, the countries against
which this missile defense system
isaimed are not faceless bogeymen
that scare your children but are
actually real countries with real
problems. North Korea is a country slowly starving to death, and
upon belatedly recognizing this

fact, it has made remarkable
diplomatic overtures to its
southern adversary. Wouldn't
American foreign policy be
better served by cultivating
this relationship towards a
true peace than by further
alienating North Korea?
Iran is currently in a

huge internal struggle between a reformist modernizing president,
Muhammad Khatami, and the immense power of radical Islamist clerics, led by the Ayatollah Khameni. The
best policy in dealing with this may
just be the good old laissez-faire, handsoff means of interaction that lets the
country deal with its own issues. I suspect jamming "rogue-state" status
down their throats is not a great idea.
And then, of course, there's Iraq.
Another starving nation (because of
U.S.-imposed sanctions that are currently maintaining the present "demonic" regime while killing off its

population slowly), Iraq could really
benefit from an end to its pariah status. Do we really need to add insult to
injury?
There is a last point that needs to
be made here, possibly so obvious that
it is overlooked. "Rogue states" like
Iran, Iraq and North Korea may or may
not be in possession of some elements
or primordial forms of chemical, biological and nuclear (CBN) weapons, but
they sure as hell don't have a significant ballistic missile system, capable
of delivering payloads to the continen-

tal United States.
If CBN weapons (other than American-made ones, of course) ever makeit

to the United States, it'll be in a suitcase carried by an international contract terrorist through Dulles, O'Hare

or LaGuardia International.This could
mean tighter border controls or steps
to make the United States less hated
than it is in the world scene, like by
moving U.S. troops away from the Muslim holy land, for example.
This leads to another issue, though.
There are countries with ballistic missile systems that are fully functional,
namely Russia and China. The U.S.
didn't create their missile defense
shield to guard against these countries,
and yet Russia and China are forcefully
opposed to the policy.
To understand why, one needs to
know a little bit of Cold War geo-politics. There was a time in which the balance of the world order relied on a
scary concept called mutually assured
destruction (MAD). No one country
would start a nuclear attack, as it could
be assured of full retaliation.
It is in this context that defensive
systems were seen as just another type
of offensive weapon; if the United States
is protected by a missile shield, what
prevents it from launching an offensive
nuclear attack without the fear of retaliation? The old "Americans are the
good guys" explanation doesn't cut it;
just check out "Dr. Strangelove" from
McCabe.
The fact is that Cold War nuclear
politics will not go away until the
nuclear weapons themselves are disarmed, and the United States has no
intention of significantly decreasing its
gigantic stockpile, even while pressuring all the rest of the powers to do so. Is
it any wonder that China and Russia
are scared of U.S. nuclear hegemony?
A successful follow-through of the
Strategic Defense Initiative might initiate a nuclear arms race, speeding the
world toward another cold war. I have
heard arguments that this won't happen because of Russian and Chinese
economic dependence on the United
States. This is a shallow and narrowminded view of these two sleeping giants and their issues of keeping dignity
and ideology in a fast-changing world.
In short, neither looks kindly upon
their skewed economic relationship
with the United States, and neither will
hesitate in making their national security decisions independent of their economic situation.
The main point is that the United
States needs to realize that it is one
country of many in a world growing increasingly smaller and more intimate.
This means that the older mindset of
building a high wall around the United
States, its troops, its allies and its interests (a wall that would crisscross the
globe, leaving some in and others out)
will cause more danger than it can prevent.
A foreign policy that involves
real engagement

with some benefit and some sacrifice as a true
partner is the only thing now that
will safeguard the United States
of America. It is only then that
the world will start standing
with the US, and not against it:
as a global partner, and not a
selfish global bully.

How much do HPHOENIX
you love us? We love you back.

Life, like knitting, doesn't have
to be perfect to be appreciated
BY MARY CAMPBELL
Many moons ago, in the far-away kingdom ofKansas, in a castle that someone else now owns, obnoxious and imperious eight-year-old princess Mary's
benevolent aunt taught her how to crochet. Mary
sat for hours on end, pulling on unraveling strands
of acrylic yarn, awkwardly looping and knotting
scarves and potholders into some semblance of
shape: the potholders roughly square, the scarves
long and pennant-shaped. But she was happy. And
life was good.
Then princess Mary grew up into a socially-awkward 19-year-old Swattie. One summer, Mary went
to Germany, and it was cold, and she was lonely.
And she felt creatively desiccated. So, she took up
crocheting once again. She worked furiously on a
scarfof earth brown and deep forest green. Day and
night she crocheted, till she could crochet no more,
pulling out every line handiwork in which a stitch
was dropped, crocheting toward perfection. Her
hands ached, but she dreamed of the day when she
could strut around, a perfectly-crocheted scarf of
wool warmth caressing her neck, protecting her
from Jack Frost's frisky love nips.
Alas, the summer ended, and princess Mary returned home to her kingdom, her dream of hand-

made woolen warmth unrealized. Because she had
spent the summer doing and then re-doing, creating
and thenpulling out, stitching and then cutting, the
scarf was a mere one foot long. And who, my children, could keep Jack Frost at bay with a one-foot
scarf?

But there is something for us to take from this
tragic story of "Princess Mary and the Scarf." Many
of us Swatties waste so much breath voicing concerns, use so much ink demanding changes, expend
so much energy seeking out error, that we lose track
of what is right around us. We forget to celebrate
the beauty of a product, even if its beauty is not
perfection. Of course, I am not advocating complacency or mediocrity, but I am saying that if we pull
out every dropped-stitch-containing line of our crocheted handiwork, we will never be able to make

scarves.
So, here is Mary, crocheting a scarf:
■ I like that the administration is generally receptive to student concerns.
■ I like that the RAs don't act as parental author-

ity figures.
■ I like that the girl across the hall will take an
hour out her insane schedule to teach me about linguistics.
■ I like that most of my professors provide students with their home phone numbers.
■ I like the way the woman at Tarble never fails
to smile at 8 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday when
I pass her my teeth-mark-pocked ID card.
■ I like that cultural events, like the San Francisco Mime Troupe performance, are entirely free
to the student body.
■ I like that I can complain about other people's
complaints and not feel like a hypocrite.
So let us all join hands in an attempt to crochet
our own communal scarf. Maybe some of us could
even take up knitting.

Nader vote not necessarily
a throwaway for liberals
BY S. KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN
The Daily Princetonian (Princeton U.)
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. This is not a good
time to be a liberal Democrat. Al Gore has been
"talking the talk" of populism, arguing that he
stands for the millions of working Americans who
have been leftbehind in this age of prosperity. And
at the same time, Joseph Lieberman and the rest
of the Democratic Leadership Council have been
moving the party in a conservative direction for
more than a decade. It was these conservatives
who participated in the dismantling of the social
safety net in 1996 and who continue to believe that
minimum-wage work without child support is better than welfare.
-

Conservative Democratic leaders also support

such as the
socially conservative measures
and engage in moral crusades
death penalty
against the "cultural pollution" of liberal academia
and the entertainment industry. Finally, it is this
conservative leadership that joined Republicans
in their attacks on immigrants in 1996, raised no
objections to the witch hunt against nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee this year and continues to place
undue scrutiny on the campaign contributions of

Asian-American citizens.
What's a liberal to do? Stay at home? Vote for
Ralph Nader? According to the party faithful, voting for Nader is not an option. They argue that we
liberals lost our chance when Bill Bradley failed
to capture the party's nomination. Following
Gore's dictum, we should simply "put up or shut
up."
Bradley was our last chance to put up; now we
must shut up and lend our support to the
president's heir-apparent. Forget the fact that
"shutting up" is what made liberals marginal to
the Democratic Party in the first place. When there
are Supreme Court justices that hang in the balance,

we should forget our differences and unite

for the fight in November.
Democrats are correct in pointing out that voting for Nader can be dangerous in a close presidential race. There are indeed some serious negative consequences to a potential Bush-Cheney administration. At the same time, the advice of "putting up or shutting up" should not serve as a blanket prescription. Liberals should think strategically when making their choice for president. Instead of focusing on national polling data that
show an extremely close race, we should look instead to state polling data that show the election
as it will really be decided through the electoral

college.
In states where the race is close, we should certainly resist the temptation to vote for Nader. In
the majority of states, however, the race is a foregone conclusion. Websites like hotlinescoop.com
document the latest polling numbers from each
state. In Texas, for example, Gore trails Bush by
more than 28 percentage points and has no realistic shot of winning the state's 32 electoral votes.
The same is true for "safe-Bush" states like Utah,
Virginia, South Carolina and Indiana. In other
states like Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey, Gore leads Bush by more than 15 percentage
points. In such states, we liberals can safely choose
to vote our conscience instead of choosing the path
of political expediency.
So, the Democratic leadership is indeed right
when it argues that liberals are courting political
suicide if their Nader votes lead to a Bush victory.
At the same time, we risk continuing our marginal
position within the Democratic Party if we blindly
follow the advice of "putting up or shutting up."
Instead, we liberals should be strategic voters and
make our decisions based on the contours of the
electoral college. Only then can we ensure a Bush
loss, while at the same time reversing the conservative drift in the Democratic Party for future elections.

ARTS

NO WHITE MAKEUP.
NO GLASS BOXES.

THIS IS MIME.
(AND

YES, THEY DO TALK.)

The Phoenix's Jonah Gold sat down with the San Francisco Mime
Troupe's principal director Dan Chumley to find out what mime really
means, how a theater collective works and why all art is political.
The San Francisco Mime Troupe has been creating great political theater since before
you were born. Since its birth, in 1959, the troupe has been bringing its relevant, wildly
creative brand of theater to all manner of venues, from festivals and free shows in public
parks (they beat the San Francisco parks in a famed 1969 court case) to "real" theaters and
colleges like Swarthmore.
They have survived the cultural turmoil of the sixties and seventies and the questionable fashion decisions of the eighties. No, they don't wear white makeup. They are very
rarely trapped inside a big glass box. And yes, they talk. I found this out firsthand, speaking with Dan Chumley, who has been the troupe's principal director (as a collective, they
have no traditional "artistic director") since 1975.
The Phoenix: Can you tell me a little bit about your troupe's collective artistic process?
Dan Chumley: Well, the mime troupe is a collective with a collective process, but has
gone from a director's company, where the director decided everything, when it was founded
in '59, to becoming a collective. And then, inside of that collectivity, backed away from the
idea that everyone should do everything. We have some people to direct, some people to
write, some people to design. Now people, as they develop their skills, are encouraged to
take on other things, but we do have... talent-based division.
TP: How do you deal with the interaction between artistic expression and the political
messages in your shows?
DC: We follow this dictum that Brecht has, that all art is political. So you have to look
at what you're saying all the time, and what you're not saying— he says an unopposed
bad idea is endorsed by that work in some way... so content becomes very important.
Form is the key in terms of your target audience. How do you want to reach them? So the
form of the play has to have a clear understanding of the audience, status-wise. Are you
going to try to alienate them with absurd stuff? Are you going to try to get them to engage
on an intellectual level where they have to ferret out your meaning? Or are you going to
try to choose a form that is... more popular— that engages them directly in a way? The
mime troupe has come down on the side of popular forms, like melodrama, or commedia,
or adapted forms that have the essence of either of those. If you can get them to laugh,
then you know they're following you. Not at a pratfall, but at a character situation... that
means that they've engaged the play intellectually, they understand what the character's
going through— and... they laugh for that reason. Not because it's a—you know— "bahdoom boom." A popular form doesn't have to be low. It can be a high style form, but it
still has to offer the audience a space in... That's the way popular theater works. It's like
preaching, where you're like "can I get an Amen?" — when you expect something back
from the audience.
TP: Does the collective process, and your works' political nature, ever cause conflicting
ideologies in what you're trying to express?
DC: That's what the whole thing is about. We bring in scholars. We bring in books. We
sit and we argue until we have agreement. It's very difficult to do a work that has a political drive to it if we don't believe it. So how do you get to believe it? That's the real thing.
And... we sit there and argue, and argue, and argue, until we have consensus. So we say,
actually, our theater is a theater of argument. It's forged in that kind of argument, and it
comes to the audience as an argument. An argument that they have to come down on one
side or the other of.
TP: And your job, as performers, is to try to sway them to the side that you're on?
DC: Obviously. What keeps it short of being flag-waving propaganda is that we say "give
all characters their best argument." Even the ones that we disagree with. Use their best
argument. Use their own words. Use their own vision. And put it in there, extend it to its
logical extreme, so that you have the context that it's in, but you give that argument a
space. Then counter it with your best.
TP: So, you've got all this
it's basically like a lot of this type of theater ideology-wise.
But what I'm wondering is
why mime?
DC: You misunderstand the word. And that's not your fault. Marcel Marceau has so
perverted people's understanding of the word "mime" that they only see it as white face,
black tights. We don't do that
we never did really. [Troupe founder] Ronnie [Davis]'s
...

...

definitionof "mime" preceded the popular understanding of the word. And that word, as it
was defined by Webster's... was "broad, farcical, tending towards slapstick A script for
such performances
drawn from the ancient Greek and Roman forms." There are British
mimes which are musical and totally verbose. They do talk. The mime troupe mimics... it
doesn't do pantomime, which is the easiest use of the distinctionbetween mime and pantomime. We say we capture daily life in story and song. We do do "broad, farcical, tending
towards slapstick." When a lady went to the better business bureau in Texas and said she
had bought a ticket for a mime show and not gotten it we sent her this definition and, uh,
she set aside her suit, but didn't really change her mind. Because she understood mime
correctly and we didn't. She wanted somebody in a glass box.
TP: What sort of training and experience do your mimes have?

Ben (Amos Glick, left), a real-estate developer in Coast City, plays political hardball with
the mayor (Velina Brown) and her pollster (Luis Oropeza) after the mayor enacted a ban
on loft apartments in Tuesday night's production of "City for Sale" at LPAC.
DC: Our mimes are actors. And they come from a wide range of different training. But
you learn by doing. This is much more like a medieval formula. We've had the great good
fortune to have people stay in the company long enough so that average life span in the
company is something like seven to ten or twelve years. So somebody comes in on their
first show. They maybe have a small part in that, but they watch other actors. In the park,
you actually have to be muscular in your delivery. It's not like movies, it's not traditional
theater, where they come to you... they learn right away how much energy is required. I
teach workshops all the time, and teach other people how to teach that workshop.
TP: Is there anything else you want to discuss that we didn't touch on?
DC: Well, music is a key element, a composer is one of the key forces in the company...
in the United States, music is actually key, because it's a cultural definition... The place
that the company's at economically... you know, that's something that's happening to all
the arts groups. The major struggle for people to live as artists in this country is a direct
result of the fact that we devalue art
we think of art as a luxury, not a necessity. And in
the rest of the world, art is a necessity. Governments pay for it... Why are Europeans so
much more grounded, in a, you know, big world sense, than Americans? Why are we so
provincial? Well, because are government, basically, fails to provide education, and one
element of education is exposure to art. Even the smallest town in Germany has a theater... why would a government pay for that? Because they don't want their people to be
backsliding troglodytes. They want them to be forward-thinking. They want to have a cultured people. This government... Well, whoever leads the next government is equally dull,
in a certain way. They really don't have anything new that addresses how we become
citizens of the planet. But in Europe
that's the major struggle right now. That's a phenomenal thing, and we're having trouble getting off the dime.

The San Francisco Mime Troupe's show "City for Sale" (which Chumley was not involved with) was performed to a packed house at LPAC Tuesday night. Chumley is currently in residence here at the college, doing a master workshop with theater students.

THE
ROOMMATES
MYRT NEVER MET
BY JOANNA CURTIS

[EDITOR'S NOTE: THE NAMES WITHOUT CLASS YEARS IN THIS STORY
HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO PROTECT THOSE WHO DO OWN PETS.]

I can't decide whether Swatties are goody-goodies, or just
so accustomed to academic drudgery that it doesn't take a
lot to thrill us. Either way, it's exciting that there's a whole
catalog ofresidential deviancies we can get away with (e.g.,
halogen lamps, candles and cohabitation, to name a few).
This year, lots of upperclassmen are pushing the envelope in a different direction. Pets are appearing in more and
more student singles, even though it's hard to dispute the
idea that Swarthmore is a difficult place to be responsible
for anything other than yourself. Hectic schedules and a
tendency to leave campus for weeks at a time (winter break,
paranyone?) aren't sufficient to dissuade some Swatties
ticularly older, more jaded ones—from their desire for furry
friends.
Why the pet boom? It's a little more complex than an insatiable longing to revolt against Dean ofResidential Life Myrt
Westphal. Swatties turn to animals for a host of reasons, not
the least of which is to fill voids in their personal lives.
"I was feeling kind of lonely because my boyfriend was
far away, so I wanted some rabbit lovin'," Swarthmore student Katerina Ivanovna said. Ivanovna spoke poignantly
about the trials and joys her bunny Grushenka brings her
a poster and a book of verse scarred with teeth marks,
dashed hopes of unconditional love and pride in learning
"the proper ways to pleasure her."
Uh-huh. Look, I, too, am tired of The Phoenix being all
about how Swatties don't get enough capital-A-Action, but I
think the inference is unavoidable here. Ivanovna later
added that her eventual plan for the relationship mirrors
the fate of the bunny's namesake, a character in "The Brothers Karamazov."
Veronica Fisher received a Siamese fighting fish as a
birthday present several weeks ago. "I was pleased," she
said. "I thought I could handle the fish, especially since it
came in such a small container. They claim that he likes
small spaces."
Fisher namedthe fish Javier after a recent fling, in hopes
that her new pet would be able to serve a special function in
her psyche. "I wanted his memory to live on. We had a kind
of falling out at the end, so in my way, I'm reconciling our
differences, in the embodiment of Javier the fish," she said.

Not surprisingly, there is a reproduction factor at work
compounding the number of pets on campus. Ben Newman
■'ol, who now lives off-campus, ended up a pet owner when
the rat one of his friends bought to keep in Mary Lyons
turned out to be pregnant.
After growing up with an allergic mother, Newman is
pleased to have fulfilled his desire for mammalian companionship. "I've been wanting to own mammals for a long
time," he said. "I've triedreptiles and fish, but they all died.
I even had a slime mold once. This cute little orange blob in
a petri dish. It was adorable, but you can't pet it or cuddle
with it, and it's gooey."
Like most pet owners, Swatties engage in some fantastic
anthropomorphism, which of course tells us more about
people than pets. Both Fisher and a senior who asked to be
identified as Knute are into psychoanalyzing their pets.
Knute considers his guinea pig Fang somewhat paranoid.
"She has issues," he said. "All guinea pigs, by nature ofbeing one of the larger rodents out there, have issues."

Fisher identifies Javierwith an autistic child she worked
with over the summer. "I was an aid at a day camp for a child
who had some social problems," she recalled. "Even though
he wanted to be around otherkids, he didn't always interact
well with them. I think Javier is a little bit like that. I'm interested in what it is about Siamese fighting fish that make
them so protective and defensive." Biology majors out there?
And like good Swatties, pet owners are eager to wax philosophical about meaning in pet-owning. Ivanovna said, "You
expect [pets] to give you unconditional love, but actually,
you give them unconditional love. They're sort oflike children in that way
the primary responsibility rests with

you."

The final exam in Patterns of Asian Religions offered
Newman a quasi-spiritual encounter with his rats, Chocolate and Vanilla. The only essay question on the exam that
Newman was prepared to answer asked him to imagine that
the conversation of three sages has been overheard by a
white rat and a black rat, and to write about the event from
the perspective of the rats.

"If it hadn't happened, I wouldn'thave had a good essay
to write," Newman said.

Did this event result in him investing the rats with personalities? "They have personalities." Oh.
Most students desiring animal companionship stick to
rodents and fish, but Willa Bandler 'Ol is more daring. At
the beginning of this semester, Bandler brought her 14-yearold, 35-lb. dog to live in Mary Lyons.
"She's really a very mellow dog," she said, "but she gets

depressed when I'm not around." Bandler insisted that the
dog was no problem for anyone, because it was kept in her

room all the time.
But the deans were soon contacted either by students or
housekeepers, and withintwo weeks, Bandler's dog was sent
back home to New Mexico. Myrt Westphal, Assistant Dean
ofResidential Life, says this is an annual occurrence.
Even the traditionaldorm pets can cause community prob-

lems. Valerie Walbek 'Ol recalled her sophomore year living
in Mary Lyons, when hernext-door neighbor knocked on her
door at 2 a.m. to look for a pet chinchilla. "She said, 'Um, our
chinchilla just ran into your room.' I didn't really want a
chinchilla in my room
ifI did, I guess I would own one
so I let her in to search for it."
Walbek said she considers pets to be a bad idea. "I think

[having pets] is an imposition on the hall," she said. "Of
course I have friends for whom pets are an important part
of their lives, but I don't think you have the right to subject
the people you live with to your pet."
I addition to being a potential annoyance to other Swatties,
Westphal pointed out that pet waste is a nuisance to Environmental Services employees. Handling kitty litter and
bunny pellets aren't in housekeepers' job descriptions.
But of course, to everyone but pet owners, pets are inconveniences, nuisances nothing but additional warm bodies
crammed into already-cramped living conditions. But to the
Swatties who lavish attention on their furry, scaly and slimy
pals, these animalsoffer a boundless and sorely-needed source
of companionship and warmth, which is otherwise lacking
in their academically-oriented Swarthmore existence.
And, of course, Myrt Westphal knows the truth; she has
heardthose fishy pet stories swimming around campus. She

Excited, flustered,
=GOOD? aggravated: how the

Love Monkey screws
with your head
BY MORGHAN HOLT

BY JONAH GOLD

My friend peers over my shoulder, his eyes rifling
through my received e-mail messages, scanning the list until he hits it. "Hey," he says, startled, "I got one of those,

Love is good. Though cynics may

sneer at this assertion, it is, among the
general populace, a generally-agreedupon fact. And we all know that there's
nothing cooler than monkeys, with the

too!" He then goes off in great detail with great vehemence
on a rant about how ridiculous they are, these supposedly
informative messages that begin "Someone has a crush on
y0u..." or some rubbish of that nature.
He laughs as he's talking about it, telling me that they're
stupid and a waste of time and that they reveal something
about the characters of the people who send them: they're
too chicken-shit to tell the recipient that they like them. He
thinks it's dumb, that's for sure, and he says he wishes he
hadn't gotten the infamousLove Monkey. Watching him get
all excited and flustered as he discusses it and listening to
him tell me about how it bothers him, I can't help but think
that some part of him is really glad he got it, some part of
him is flattered in knowing that someone likes him, if only
on a high school level, enough to take the time to send it.
In fact, a lot of people feel this way. Whether it's the
Pimpin' Cupid or the Love Monkey who sneaks into their
inboxes, everyone's kind of excited to see him. It provides
them with a sort of affirmation, reminds them that they're
likeable and loveable and tells them someone's recognized
that, maybe not enough to come out and actually tell them,
but enough to sendthem a sideways message. It can change
a person's day, not to mention his/her attitude, his/her self-

possible exception of flying monkeys,
which don't exist. So combine these two
undeniably great things and you get
something even more great, right? Well
maybe. But either way, it could be
here to stay.
The Love Monkey, a feature on
Swat's Daily Jolt website, has existed
since the site's birth at the beginning of
this year. But, for whatever reason,
...

there has been a boom oflate. The amorous simian in question is poking Swat
students left and right these days... and
some of them poke back.
The Daily Jolt is a nationwide network of student-run campus Web sites
born at Amherst a few years ago, and,
according to Swat's own dailyjolt.com
site, it is "intended to make your life just
a little bit more fun." The Love Monkey
feature is the site's answer to similar
online matching services like
TheSpark.com's "Pimpin' Cupid." The
way it works is pretty simple, and quite
subtle for a creature whose sexual antics in zoos frighten small children regularly. You go to the site, registers yourself and list the e-mail addresses of any
number of people for whom one has the
proverbial hots. The Monkey, which the
site assures us is 'actually a monkey,"
and "not just a short man in a monkey
costume," then checks its database for
all the people entered as objects of lust.
If the names entered are those ofregistered users, and any of these "objects
oflust" have the new user on their lists,
both parties are privately notified.If the
names entered aren't thoseof registered
users, the Monkey sends these nonmembers a message telling them everso-invitingly that "Somebody's got a
crush on y0u..." and invites them to register with the service to find out if their
secret admirer is someone whom they,
too, have their eyes on. So all is welland
good, and the chronically shy (of which
there are many around these parts) have
an even chance at finding love, without
the risk of actually embarrassing themselves among other living humanbeings
outside of the cyber world.
At least, that's the theory. In reality,
it's a bit more complicated. First of all,
monkey abuse seems to occur with some
frequency (insert your own dirty joke
here). Though it is hard to verify, rumors
fly about people putting in names ofthose
to whom they are not at all attracted, or
even every single member of the preferred sex that they can think of, trying
to root out their mysterious secret admirer. While this may be a natural response, it causes distrust of the monkey.
"I had a Love Monkey message this
weekend, and at first I was kind ofexcited,
then annoyed that anybody would contact
me in this way, then decided that it must
be a joke," an anonymous freshman said,
explaining her decision to ignore the
Monkey's invitation. Many others have

14

perception.

done likewise. This system's beauty is in
its safety, and the prospect ofconfidential
crush information falling into the wrong
hands scares offmany of those who might
be best served by the monkey.
Meredith Leigh 'O4 has another complaint with the monkey. She did not reply, she said, because "I feel like it is
childishand stupid. We are not in middle
school. If you really like someone, you
should have the guts to approach them
in person or deal with your cowardice

and not do anything."
This is a harsh outlook, to be sure, but
many Swatties feel the same way: this is
not how the relationship game works.
There are no "safe" cheats like the one
provided by the monkey. The numberof
people whoresist the simian on these or
similar grounds is high enough to keep
it from being anything close to the uni-

versally effective tool that it should be.
And it is worth mentioning that we found
not a single successful relationship provoked (or even helped along the way) by
the Love Monkey.
Due to these complaints, there has
been, of late, in the Daily Jolt forums,
talk of "reforming the monkey" in various ways. One possibility that has been

proposed is to allow it to differentiate

between a message from someone who
has signed up to the service oftheir own
initiative, and someone who is merely
responding to another person's "monkeying." While proponents of this pro-

THE PHOENIX

posal think it would remove some paranoia and make it easier to separate the
monkeyings created by true attraction
from the guesswork, Jeremy Schifeling
'O3, one of the creators of the
Swarthmore Daily Jolt site, does not
agree. The official statement from Swat
Web site creators is that they "stand by
the monkey's current format with regards to that feature After all, what
kind of strong relationship can be built
from an unequal foundation?" A change
they would like to see, one which would
...

no doubt encourage further abuse, but
might well be worth it for the personal-

ity it adds, is the possibility ofpersonalized messages on the monkeyings.
In the long run, there seems to be a
future for the monkey. And if a newly-

created service with a track record
pretty close to zero successful matches
can pull in people like the Love Monkey,
more monkeys are definitely on the way.
We may someday look forward to a future in which monkeys, computerized
or tuxedo-wearing, run all aspects of our
lives. The Politics Monkey ("Someone
wants you to be Speaker of the House!"),
the Justice Monkey ("Someone has reported you for second degree criminal
assault!"), the Capitalism Monkey
("Someone wants to buy you out!"). The

possibilities are close to limitless. As a
great philosopher once said, infinite
monkeys equal infinite possibilities.
Welcome to the future.

But it's also aggravating, as Frank Martinez 'O2 so adeptly
pointed out in his letter to the editor regarding the Cupid he
received a few weeks ago. When I spoke to him about his
intitial response to receiving the wretched message, he said
he was "excited, then ashamed about being excited." It's aggravating because, stupid as it is, it eats at you, taunts you
because, well, you want to know who it is. Only, if you try
to find out, you're essentially stepping on your own feet,
because the process involves your sending similar messages
to those people you suppose it could be, which will likely
result in an enormous web of misconstrued messages and
all-out confusion. If you send it to him because you think
that there's some slight possibility that he's the lame-o who
sent it to you, he'll think that you want him, when, really,
all you're trying to do is find out who the hell sent it to you
because it's been gnawing up your insides since you got it.
You really want to know who sent it to you, but at the
same time, you don't. Some part of you enjoys the mystery,
aggravating as it is. It's the old secret-admirer complex, the
origin of May Day and other such nonsense that involves
slipping a note or a present into a loved one's mailbox without revealing your identity. It's exciting and thrilling and
tempting, and it works its wicked magic on us because we
humans like to be teased.
It's funny, the number of people (at the time I was writing this, there were 453 Swarthmore users registered and
active in the Love Monkey circle... so far, a whopping 1203
crushes have been admitted) who've let their curiosity get
the best of them and responded to their Cupids or Monkeys
by sending massive amounts of the same message to ludicrously lengthy lists offriendsand potential lovers. It's funny
to listen to them, as they rant about the proverbial cat killed
by their curiosity. It's funny to hearthem spew vehemently
how the Cupid or Monkey screwed themso they had to ward
off unwanted advances from the people they thought had
sent it to them who got the wrong message. Or, they had to
spend hours explaining to their long-time friends that they
weren't really interested but that they'd somehow gotten
the impression that maybe they were.
Perhaps it's best to stifle the urge to sendresponsive Cupids
or Monkeys to the entire campus in afeeble, pathetic attempt
to find out which Swattie admires you from afar. And Frank,
ignore the gnawing
even though it enrages and frustrates
you, because "if [you] wanted an Internet girlfriend, [you'd]
go to an AOL chatroom." I never wanted to be your girlfriend.
It's just that I wasn't as readily able as you to repress the
gnawing urge, theneed to know that caused me to fanatically
enter the names of each and every guy I know. But I'm not
above becoming your AOL chatroom ho.

BOOK
'Lying Awake' explores faith
BY CATHERINE OSBORNE
Mark Salzman is no novice at
investigating foreign cultures;
his 1987 memoir "Iron and Silk"
deals with his experience of living in rural China. But in his new
novel, Salzman probes the heart
of a society that is probably
stranger to most Americans than
any society that is separated from
us by a mere ocean. "Lying
Awake" is set in contemporary
Los Angeles, in a Carmelite convent, an insulated world where
thorny moral and social issues

BY CLARISSA OLIVEIRA

nevertheless arise.

The Carmelites form a par-

ticularly strict order of Catholic
nuns vowed to stability, silence

and poverty. Salzman's heroine,
the late-middle-aged Sister John
of the Cross, has left the convent
only for medical appointments in
the last 30 years. She and her fellow sisters speak out loud for only
a short time every day and waste
nothing, right down to the
crumbs of bread that fall into
their napkins. Prayer and work
are constant, the foundations on
which the tiny community is
built.
This all may seem like a
throwback, a set ofmedieval practices dumped incongruously and
irrelevantly into a contemporary
setting. But the nuns are not as
isolated as they first appear. And
when mysticism and medicine
meet, they learn from each other

in very valuable ways.
Sister John, whose history we
see in flashbacks, has spent a long
period of time with "her heart
feeling squeezed dry." Salzman
calls this a "period of spiritual
aridity" that is finally broken
when an unexplained series of
migraine headaches suddenly
bursts into glorious visions of
mystical unity with the divine.
For Sister John, these are transcendent episodes.
The headaches that precede
each mystical experience, however, become more and more severe, and finally her prioress insists that she see a medical specialist. When he diagnoses epilepsy, and recommends surgery
to remove a small node in her
brain that is causing the "problem," Sister John is forced to

make a decision.
Salzman uses recent medical
literature that speculates that dis-

eases, like migraine and epilepsy
probably affected celebrated mystics such as Hildegard of Bingen

and St. Teresa of Avila (the
founder of the Carmelite Order).
If these "prophets and poets" had
had access to modern medical
technology, would the church
have accepted their experiences
as true interactions with God?
(Probably not
the contemporary Carmelite Order rejects applicants with a history of epilepsy
because the condition can create
"false" mystical experiences.)
Would they have had their conditions fixed? Should they have?
Sister John, who has to make
that choice, is caught in an excru-

dating doublebind. "Is God asking
me to let go of concerns for my
health, or is he asking me to let go
of my desire for his presence?" she
asks the nuns' priest, seeking in
vain for counsel. Salzman asks

hard questions here about the intersectionofancient faithand modern technology, and it is to his
credit thathe has no easy answers.
Salzman is generally a graceful
writer, though at times a bit sim-

plistic. His evocation of Sister
John, a woman who "had spent the
last twenty-eight years without

television, radios, newspapers,
movies, fashion or men," is sympathetic without being condescending. He takes great care to stress
thatthese women are not only giving up things, they are gaining as
well. Further, Salzman avoids falling into the opposite trap of portraying a cloistered life as one of
total tranquility. The nuns of St.
Joseph have quarrels like any
other group in close quarters.
The titlerefers to, among other
things, the practice of some medieval monastic groups of having
some members always awake and
praying for the souls of the world:
for what if the Second Coming happened and caught all of humanity
asleep? A particularly powerful

theme in the novel is drawn from
this idea of being at all times ready
both to accept God's will for oneself and to lead a life of spiritual
charity towards others.
Salzman refuses to make a
choicebetween religion and medi-

cine. Faith is accepted and celebrated, but Sister John, who has
chosen a medieval lifestyle, recog-

nizes that she and her thoroughly
contemporary doctor have much
in common as healers. Sister John
leaves the hospital: "Facing thelab
coat while in her habit, she felt
like a frontier guard saying goodbye to her counterpart across the
border."
Scenes such s the show that in
"Lying Awake," Salzman has created a novel whose relevance, in a
society struggling with the place
offaith in a technologically-driven
world, is unquestionable.

THE PHOENIX

There have been rumors that SHC doesn't cater
to the college's penis-bearing population. This article,
and the announcement that follows, hope to remedy
that unfortunate reputation.
Although I have fooled you into believing that
rapid (or "premature") ejaculation is an issue that
only affects men, this is usually not the case. Needless to say, a 30-second lovemaking session involves
both the man and his partner, who are both likely to
end up feeling guilty, anxious and/or frustrated.
Therefore, if there is a partner in the picture, the
process of prolonging your hang time will be much
more effective if he or she is actively involved.
But before we move on, let's go back to the basics:
what is rapid ejaculation? Paul Joannides, author of
the acclaimed "Guide to Getting It On," says that "if
you have to think about baseball while barely moving your hips and you still can't last for two minutes," chances are you are afflicted with this problem. It is, however, much more complex than this
and thinking about baseball is definitely not the best
way to treat it.
According to Joannides, premature ejaculation
probably affects 30 to 40 percent of males, mostly because they have not learned to appreciate the full
range of sensations in their bodies (for whatever social, cultural or psychological reasons). A common
myth is that premature ejaculators wouldlast longer
ifonly they triedharder. This is neither true nor fair
to men suffering from this problem, since they would
obviously like to last longer, and so if it were simply
a matter of effort, they would. Another misconception is that these men are ultra-sensitive, when really the problem arises in men who are not in touch
with the full range of sexual feeling.
The solution begins with exercises that make a
man more aware of the sensations in his entire body.
Joannides emphasizes that "rather than trying to
numb or ignore what's going on inside of you, you
want to know it and fully experience it as you never
have before." This begins by focusing on what you
feel inside as you touch each part of your penis and
not what it feels like externally.
Joannides suggests coming up with a "scale of
calibration" from 1 to 10 (where 1 no arousal whatsoever and 10 orgasm) that will help you tune into
a wider range of sexual feeling. "Guys who come too
soon often go from 3 to 9 rather suddenly," he says,
"while other men can stay at 6 or 7 for several minutes." This, then, is a more accurate definition of the
rapid ejaculator's experience. Calibrating the penis
can be done by yourself or with a partner, and
=

=

Joannides reminds us that the latter is much more

rewarding, as it builds a better sexual relationship
for the couple. In what follows, I will assume that
you are including your partner.
Okay, but how exactly do you do this? First of all,
don't think about baseball! Focus is very important,
as are relaxation and the sense of connection to your
body. As you land

on a specific number on the scale

(after a few sessions, it will not be difficult to determine your personal scale), you should communicate
this to your partner.
The partner should then try to keep you on that
number, rather than advancing to the finish line.
At first, it may be hard to stay at a number when
you are used to skipping ahead, but the trick is to
back off each timebefore going higher, the goal being 15 to 30 minutes hovering at a 6, 7 or 8 before
advancing.
Joannidesreminds us that premature ejaculators
"need to learn sexual patience and self awareness,"
so it may indeed be frustrating to take things very
slowly and sensually. While doing these exercises, it
is crucial for both you and your partner to recognize
when you are approaching the point of no return
(around 8.5 or 9 on the scale), where nothing will stop
you from coming. External signs include: a bulging
of the veins in the penis, darkening of the head, testicles tightening into groin and other more verbal
signs of an irrevocable orgasm. The couple should
give themselves a huge pat on the back (but no
yet!) when they have reached the stage in the calibration process where the man is kept close to the
point of no return for several minutes without slipping over the edge.
Some things to remember:
■ Re-think your goals: you want to learn to enjoy
a wider range of sexual pleasure, not just to delay
ejaculation. State of mind is everything.
■ Have patience, because this will take a while
(Joannides suggests a couple of months). Tolerance

sex...

for frustration is also crucial, and some say a sense
of humor is an added bonus.
■ As with any form of exercise, it takes discipline.
■ It is more effective to start with the manual,
master that, move to the oral and only later proceed
to the other orifices. Intercourse may get in the way,
so abstaining from it while you are calibrating is a
very good idea (see previous point).
■ Learning to take deep breaths is important, as
a relaxed body feels a wider range of sensations.
■ Kegel exercises (described in a previous Sexual
Health Counselors column) are not necessary, but
they help you to get in touch with your body, and
will eventually lead to more powerful orgasms.
■ Finally, as with every aspect of a relationship,
if you happen to be in one, communication is crucial. Doing things together is more fun, and you will
never forget the person who helped you through such
a stigmatized affliction.
For more information about this, it is a good idea
to check out Joannides' "Guide to Getting It On." You
also get a lot of other information, as well as great
tips (it has been called the "Boinking Bible"). There
is also an entire book dedicated to overcoming premature ejaculation, Helen Singer Kaplan's "PE: How
to Overcome Premature Ejaculation."
And now the announcement you've all been waiting for: We have recruited male sexual health counselors! Keep your eyes open for the new bathroomstall signs.

HALLOWEEN EVENTS
The time of year when everyone dresses up
as strange and mythical creatures has come
around again. Don't be left out as Swatties join
the Halloween festivities by masquerading as
partygoers and hitting the many events
happening on campus this weekend.
Ghosts, goblins, and spooks will abound from
10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday as they climb onto the
shuttlethat will be hitting Parrish Circle every eight
minutes to whisk them off to the annual bumpin'
ML Halloween. Sure to be a scream, the party will
be fully equipped with an electronica lounge, a
teenybopper breakfast room and plenty of food.
For one night out of the year, pretend you're

something other than a stressed-out Swattie, don
your costume and hit the party, if only to laugh at
your classmates and their ridiculous garb.
Also on Saturday is the 6 Cents annual
Halloween show. Go to Olde Club at 8 p.m. and
get pelted with $lOO worth of candy. Remember
how you caught a Tootsie Roll in the eye last year?
Come get abused again.
Stick around Olde Club after the 6 Cents show
and check out a number ofSwarthmore bands in
full disguise. See if you can guess who's who, as
they, in true Halloween form, will be covering
(music, costume and all) other groups.

UN DEPTHI
IS THE BOTTLE FINALLY EMPTY?
As the college demands a revision
of the alcohol policy, students
question the feasibility of the
changes suggested by the
Deans' Advisory Committee.
BY BRENDAN KARCH
Nearly 18 months after the undercover police raid at Delta Upsilon's
Margaritaville bash, the Dean's Advisory Committee (DAC) has completed a year-long review of the college's alcohol policy and has issued
a clear challenge to Student Council: revise the party funding system
by the end of the semester.
The committee's interest centers on the receipts system used for
party funding. In order for an all-campus party one funded by the
Social Affairs Committee (SAC) to receive funds, the party organizers must submit receipts for every item purchased. The claim, raised
last fall in DAC meetings, is that receipts are commonly forged in order to cover up alcohol purchases.
DAC's final report suggests possible changes to the system to
eliminate fraud, but a committee formed by students to answer the
challenge has found those suggestions mostly inadequate and unfeasible, according to SBC Treasurer and committee member Marvin
Barron 'O2. This committee's proposal to the deans, Barron said, will
likely suggest adhering to the current rules, rather than imposing new
-

-

ones.

According to Barron and Associate Dean for Student Life Tedd Goundie,
the justification for taking no action is that the claimsfor receipt forgery
were overblown in the first place, and that if fraud ever did occur, it didn't
occur often. Increased awareness this semester on the part of SBC and
the student body has supposedly further curtailed receipt fraud.
But, as the Phoenix has learned, receipt fraud does still occur. One
group anonymously admitted submitting false receipts for a party this
semester. In the face of a delicate review of alcohol policy, such an admission raises serious questions about the course of alcohol policy at

Swarthmore.

DISCOVERING MORE THAN EXPECTED
The current review of alcohol policy dates to April 1999, when 18
Swarthmore students were arrested for underage drinking at Delta
Upsilon's annual Margaritaville party. The incident sparked campus debate and led to an open chat. In that meeting, attended by almost 100 students, administrators stated plainly that they saw no need for changes to
the alcohol policy.
When DAC convened last year to review the alcohol policy, few on the
committee expected policy changes, Goundie said. The DAC report stated

that the committee knew about prevalent underage drinking from the
start but saw little way around the state's no-tolerance policy. As the committee discovered from legal counsel, colleges are generally not culpable
for the actions of their students. Looking at the problem from a liability

I

"WE ASK THAT STUDENT COUNCIL CHARGE THE
APPROPRIATE LEADERS... WITH PROPOSING A
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM OF FRAUD/'

perspective, the committee saw little reason for concern unless they were
directly facilitating underage drinking, since that was the only way they
could be held accountable. When the committee learned of a supposed
widespread system of receipt forgery, curtailing that forgery became their
biggest concern. Alarmed by the blatant disregard for the law and concerned about the college's liability, the committee saw no choice but to

resolve the situation.
Nearly a year later, DAC has released its final report on alcohol rev
While the report addresses several issues, including risk reduction and the Party
Associates (PA) system, it is only on the topic of college-funded alcohol that the report
becomes strong in tone, stating, "We ask that Student Council charge the appropriate leadwith proposing a solution to this problem of fraud." A report addressing the issue
ers
from the student committee must be submitted to the deans by December 15.
The report continues, "An effective solution to this problem is absolutely necessary
because using college money to purchase alcoholic beverages for students puts the college
...

in an untenable position."
The DAC report proposed three possible solutions to the problem offraud: opening direct
accounts at stores such as Genuardi's and limiting party purchases to those stores; having a
non-studentreview receipts; and taking inventory of party items to compare againstreceipts.

FRAUD, FORGERY AND FUNDS
In response to the challenge to eliminate fraud, Student Council (SC) has formed a committee that includes
members of SAC, SBC and SC. The committee has yet to
meet, but their course ofaction is already being debated
in informal discussions. They have not yet decided
whether to follow any of the suggestions in the DAC report.

According to SAC co-chair Rodney Morris 'Ol, the third
proposal taking inventory at parties is the most attractive to SAC, because it agrees with their policy of
controlling party funds. Morris added, "All three [suggestions] sound feasible."
Barron, however, thinks that the suggestions in the
DAC report are "intense" and unfeasible. "I don't think
a great change is necessary," he said.
Barron cites two reasons for this: first, that the claims
for fraud had been exaggerated, and second, that "we've
seen students being more responsible as a whole" this
year. Barron and the SBC assistant treasurers said they
have not encountered any fraud this semester.
Goundie agreed that the claims of fraud were likely
overstated, saying "I find it hard to believe that [former
SBC Treasurer] Josh Bess would ignore that."
Because there have been so few SAC-funded parties
this semester, it is hard to determine how prevalent the
practice has been recently. One group that threw a party
this semester admitted to submitting false receipts but
claimed that no SAC money was used to purchase alcohol. The organizer of the party wished both his or her
name and the name of the group to stay anonymous. Another group, Phi Psi, has gone on record to claim innocence. "We did not use SAC money for alcohol," said Phi
Psi member Ben Wiles 'O3. A third group refused to go on
record to claim innocence and also refused to have their

Just how much of a problem is the continued forgery ofreceipts?
SC co-chair Jordan Brackett 'Ol thinks that it's not a serious threat to the current policy. "I

year." He added, speaking of the current policy, "I think we've created it to the extent that
we are minimizing fraud." He was not specific about how this policy was cutting down on
fraud.
However minimal fraud may be, the one known occurrence this semester may be all the
incentive the Deans need to get tough. The DAC report stresses the need for a solution that

will "prevent the use of college funds for the purchase of alcohol." Preventing fraud and

minimizing fraud are two different things. As DAC member
and physics professor Frank Moscatelli noted, "There is some
action requested here."
The initial response from both SBC and SAC seems to be
that further action is unnecessary, unproductive and unfeasible. The reasoning is simple: both groups say they are doing
everything they can. SAC's policy is not to fund alcohol. "We've
never funded alcohol," said SAC member Meg Lippincott 'OL

CHANGE IS
When asked about the supposed "wink-wink" policy, she said,
"We've always been very stringent."
Given the way the party funding system works, there is
seemingly little that SAC can do to prevent fraud. As it stands,
they try to keep tight control over the allocation ofparty funds,
so they know where every dollar is going.
SBC also says they are trying their hardest. Two treasurers Barron and one assistant thoroughly review every party
receipt that comes their way. According to Barron, there is a
strict set of guidelines for the dates and format of receipts
that is intended to curb alcohol purchases.
SBC Assistant Treasurer Christabel Pinto 'O2 said, "I don't
see how we could be doing more than we are now."
Barron went so far as to claim, "I am completely confident
that no one has used SAC money for alcohol this semester."

COMMUNICATING A NEW IMAGE?

With SAC unable to review receipts, and Barron noting
that "it isn't [SBC's] job to be party police," the burden of
meeting DAC's challenge rests on the shoulders of SC, which
oversees both groups. So far, SC has espoused communication more than policy change. Brackett noted, "We're trying to change the students' collective consciousness about
alcohol." He added, "Part of changing it is creating a new
image that we don't tolerate $3OO in cat food receipts any-

more."
Specific measures to increase awareness are not on the
table, however. There is, in short, no tangible mechanism for

changing students' perceptions.
SC's desire to increase communication goes along with a
belief in the ineffectiveness of the DAC's suggested policy
changes. "Whatever corrective mechanism is put in place,
there will still be fraud," Brackett said.
Both Lippincott and Barron seem to agree. Lippincott
noted, "A lot of the solutions the deans have come up with
have the same flaws that the current system has," while
Barron simply called DAC's proposals intense and unfeasible.
Brackett went on to say that requiring PAs to take inventory
at parties would "destroy the PA program" by making it unpopular on campus. Lippincott felt that none of the changes
would eliminate the student perception that it is acceptable

to use SAC funds for alcohol.
While SC's response to the DAC challenge remains largely
unformed, initial trends point toward a course of action that
may not satisfy the deans. "We tacitly condoned fraud in the
past," said Brackett. He went on to imply that SC no longer
does. But if fraud still exists, and the campus knows about
it, are SC, SBC and/or SAC tacitly condoning an illegal alcohol policy that makes the college liable? By December 15,
that is a question the student body and the deans will have
to address.

lan Huntington 'Ol saw it as a reasonable step by Dining Services. "Inflation
happens. You're paying for convenience," said Huntington.
But others shared Ray's opinion that
the concerns of the students weren't well
represented during the decision toraise
food prices.
"I don't know if Student Council
knew about this decision," said Jacob
Hodes 'O3. "Was there even student input? I can't imagine how they would
reach a decision like this if students had
gotten real representation."
Before making the changes, Dining
Services met with four students in Student Council. These four students agreed
to McDougall's decision that drink
prices should be raised.
According to Council Facilities and
Space Coordinator Will Ortman 'O2, one
of the four students consulted, the alternative to raising drink prices was to allow meal equivalencies to be used only
for deli items.
"Rather than completely cutting off
meal equivalencies for grocery items at
Tarble... it would be less damaging to

out of the vending machine for 40
cents," said Clifford Sosin 'O4.
Though not every student has access to beverages sold at wholesale
prices, cheaper soda prices are not
hard to find. The Co-op charges 85
cents for a 20-oz. bottle of soda and 60
cents for a can, and the vending ma-

chine in the basement of Parrish
charges $1 for a 20-oz. bottle of Pepsi.
The discrepancy between bottled
juices at Essie Mae's and at the Coop is not as severe. The Co-op charges
between $1 and SL2S for bottled juices.
McDougall said the small quantity
of soda sold by the college contributes
to the high prices. "The price of a can
of soda may be a little higher than [at]
other stores," she said, "but you have
to keep in mind that they are getting
better pricing since they are purchasing much larger quantities than
Swarthmore College."
McDougall added

that raising
drink prices was "not done with malice" and was not a calculated effort
to take advantage ofthe students. She

absorb the price increase by raising the
[price of] drinks by a quarter," said

Ortman.
Ortman regretted not being able to
consult the student body about this decision. "We wouldhave loved to encourage student input, but in this situation,
when Linda [McDougall] asked to meet,
we had no forewarning."
He feels that the student representatives had the best interest of the students
in mind when they made theirdecision.
"It was something that would be
fairly detrimental to the student body to
cut off equivalencies. You could only use
your meal credit at Tarble for deli items,
not drinks or chips," he said. "That
would be really bad for the freshmen."
As for publicizing the decision,
Ortman said, "I don't think a Tarble
price increase would be something Student Council would send out a reserved[students] e-mail for."
Students withoutpoint plans, including the first-year class, are less affected
by the change and tended to be less critical of it.
"I suppose some people would be annoyed. But, hey, the water fountain is
free," Mac Carlson 'O4 said.

Beer and bowling: America's true pastimes
gaffe immediately had his Budweiser
endorsement revoked; the event got
such public attention and fanfare
that it actually made the front page
of The New York Times, the only
sports-related story to do so beside
the fixing of the 1919 World Series by
Jewish gangsters.
In short, you may as well put in
the damned bumpers, because, as
far as the pros are concerned, it
won't change much.
Then there is the matter of the
perfect game. When a sport can be
so thoroughly mastered that someone, often someone resembling the
popular patriarch of a certain Foxnetwork cartoon sitcom, can produce a performance beyond improvement, then this sport has lost
that awesome and unconquerable
aspect from which it derives its
greatness. After all, the doing of the

According to my findings (which,
it is true, are not always that credible, or likely to be based on anything but the contents of fortune

American participants than any

ones about overweight individuals,
at whom Americans, being overweight, like to laugh, has indeed become a large part of our culture.
But bowling, I must note, is a
game not entirely without its faults.

And let's face it, the gutters cer-

about as effective in daunting the
half-decent player as would be a golf
course with sand traps 1700 yards
from the fairway. When was the last
time a professional bowler actually
threw a gutter ball? According to my
oriental desserts, it happened only
once, during WWII, when the war-

machine's demand for raw materials

required that some bowling balls be
made out of reinforced Styrofoam,
which made the game slightly
trickier. But despite the extenuating

point. Any game in which the participant improves markedly as he or
she consumes alcohol is not, in the
strictest sense, a sport. Just as baby
corn can not really be considered a
vegetable, because of unspoken
veggie size requirements, so there
are basic things which must exclude
certain pastimes from being called
sports. And in view of the state in
which a bowler finds himself most
competent, namely utter inebriation, we must deny bowling itsclaim

Sadly, it is not so with bowling.
When you reach that magical three

there's nothing left but to hang up
those bowling shoes (or, if they're
rentals, return them at the front
desk) and brag about your feat. Instead of pushing the envelope, and
training relentlessly to get to the

member to represent in the band (a cappella groups shall
be considered as falling under this umbrella). Earplugs
will be included in the program. And no, Christmas carols are not appropriate fight songs.
Football team: Winning is always an important part
of Homecoming. If you don't win, it's not that much
fun. In years past, this would have necessitated the
trucking in of the Bristol Bible College's team, but this
year's contest against F&M is not that un-winnable.
F&M is last in the Conference standings, and for once,
we are not. If the Swat team that beat Oberlin and
Gettysburg this year makes it down to Clothier Field,
as opposed to the team that unenthusiastically showed
up for Dickinson last week, we should get another W.
Other athletic teams: Last year, the athletic administration had the bad idea of scheduling away games
for all of the other fall sports teams. This year, you're
in luck. A pre-game show is women's soccer competing against Haverford at noon. And if you tire of the
football game, men's soccer plays at 2 p.m. The soccer
field is just a hop, skip and a jump away from Clothier
Field. And don't worry, they will be broadcasting updates of the Conference Championship game with,
knock on wood, the field hockey team (wink wink).
A final word to Swatties who don't play football:
those who do always seem to make it to your theatre
performances, your a cappella concerts, your Pterodactyl Hunts, Swing Nights, Student Dance Concerts,
Olde Club shows, and many, many meetings. They sit

and live on the same halls. The very least you could do
would be to make it down for part of the game on Sat-

The Garnetnext saw rival Haverford for the last home game
of the regular season. The game began with a ceremony for
the seniors, who have amassed a record of 54-21 over their
four years, including a 1997 season which holds the
Swarthmore record for most wins of any sport. Coach Karen
Borbee described the group, composed of Williams, Hollis and
tri-captains English, Vivalo and Vernon, as "selfless" in their
dedication to the team on and off the field.
Inspired by the emotion of the seniors' last game, the team came
out on fire, beating Haverford 5-2. Cariello scored her team-leading eleventh goal of the season less than three minutes into the
contest, and English converted a penalty stroke at 3:42 to give the
Garnet a quick 2-0 lead. Tarr scored on a penalty corner assisted
by Kaszas and Vivalo at 16:34 to make it 3-0. Haverford got on the
board with less than 10 minutes remaining in the first half, scoring on a penalty corner. Swarthmore countered immediately, however, as Gaffney placed a Hollis feed into the back of the cage.
Hollis later scored the lone Garnet second-half goal from
Williams, and Haverford responded with less than six minutes remaining. The five Swarthmore goals were just too
much, though, for the dominatedHaverford. Goalie Jenn Hart
'O3 played beautifully for the Garnet in the second half, while
Nelson-Lee turned away nine Ford shots in 57 minutes of play.
Vivalo described the Haverford game as "a great example of
why we play hockey, not only for the fun and competition of
the sport but also for the incredible team."
The Garnet is now anticipating the Centennial Conference
play-offs, to be held this weekend at Johns Hopkins University. Although the team has secured the second seed and Johns
Hopkins is seeded first, the remaining two teams have yet to
be determined. The team is preparing for this weekend's turf
games by scrimmaging the University of Pennsylvania on
Wednesday evening. The winner of the tournament receives

to play at its current level, it will be difficult to beat. The
team boasts Carielloand Woodworth, currently ranked seventh and twelfth respectively in scoring in the conference,
as well as goalie Nelson-Lee, ranked fourth in goalkeeping.

Soccer teams go 0-6 over fall break
BY TED CHAN AND ANNA MASILELA

BY TED CHAN AND ANNA MASILELA

The men's soccer team found no luck
in its last three games, dropping all three.
The first was to Alvernia College, a 10 overtime loss. Alvernia scored a golden
goal 10 minutes into overtime.
Next, the team lost on Oct. 13 to conference powerhouse Gettysburg, last
year's league champion. Despite playing
well in the second half after falling behind 2-0 in the first 45 minutes, the men
were unable to put anything on theboard.
The final score was 3-0.
"We played them really tough," said
co-captain Cam MacDearmid 'O3. "[CocaptainRyan] Neiheiser ['ol] hit the post
luck just seems to fall the other way."
Finally, Swarthmore lostanother conference game to the Diplomats from
Franklin & Marshall College. The Garnet
came out flat at the beginning ofthe game,
conceded a lead to F&M early and were
never really in it.
"Despite these disappointing losses, I
still love to play with these guys," said
Neiheiser. "Even when we don't turn out
the results, it's still great to be out there
when everyone is going hard."
The team is 3-9 overall and winless in
six conference games. It has suffered
three defeats in overtime.

Early-season optimism has faded into a struggle for the Garnet women's soccer squad. After starting strongly, the women
have faded to a 4-11 record, with just one win in nine conference
matchups. The last two weeks have not been kind to the team,

-

with four conference losses.
Despite goals from Jackie Kahn 'O4, Sarah Jay 'Ol and E.B.
Fortier 'O3, sloppy defending and a relentless attack from Washington College resulted in a 4-3 loss on Oct. 12.
In a game on Oct. 18, Swarthmore fell to Muhlenberg 2-0. The
Mules scored off a fluky deflected goal early in the game and
then added another nice one 15 minutes in to take a two-goal

advantage. Swarthmore stood its ground, but could not mount
an effective offensive attack.

Swarthmore battled to a 1-1 tie at the half against highlyrated Gettysburg. Kahn scored on a wonderfully-timedrun and
a great pass to her feet as she broke through the defense, after
which she calmly waited for the keeper to commit before slamming the ball home. In the second half, the unseasonably warm
temperatures and lack of depth hurt the Garnet. The gas tank
came up empty as Gettysburg was able to continue its intensity
of attack with fresh legs. Swarthmore was able to net another
goal as the forwards pressured a drop pass to the keeper. Anna
Masilela 'O4 was able to deflect the attempted pass from the
keeper and Heather Marandola 'Ol beat the keeper to the ball,
knocking it in for the Garnet's lone goal in the second half. Unfortunately, the Bullets sandwiched the goal with a seven-goal
barrage on the Garnet's exhausted defenders.
"We have played really well during the three games," said
Drea Figueroa 'O2. "We came out strong, even though we ended

Tide stumbles against Dickinson 30-13
BY JUSTIN KANE
Sometimes two teams can be evenly matched evon the field. That was the case last Saturday,
when Swarthmore took on Dickinson in Carlisle, Pa. It
was on the scoreboard that the difference showed.
Despite accumulating 271 total yards and 22 first
downs, the Garnet Tide had difficulties keeping up
with the scoring pace of the Red Devils, who pulled
out a 30-13 win without ever overwhelming the Tide.
It was a familiar theme for a Swarthmore team that
has had difficulties scoring all year long.
The GarnetTide's losses to Johns Hopkins, Ursinus
and Muhlenberg all saw the offense move the ball with
some success but fail to convert scoring opportunities,
often losing the ball on downs or on a turnover. Against
Dickinson, the Tide feU victim to much of the same,
killing one fourth-quarter drive with an interception
that was returned by linebacker Trent Stambaugh for

October break brought greatly differing results for the men's
and women's cross country teams.
The men traveled to Allentown on Oct. 14, while the women
were idle. On Oct. 21 the women traveled to Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., while the men stayed home. The races were the last tuneups for the Garnet Harriers before this Saturday's Centennial
Conference Championship in Westminster, Md.
Allentown's hilly 8,000-meter course proved to be a killer
for all parties involved. But Swarthmore's top runner, Marc
Jeuland 'O3, came in with a strategy.
"I was going to be patient and not run out too fast," said
Jeuland. "I eventually caught up with the leaders and passed
them on the uphills."
His strategy worked, as he propelled himself to a first-place
finish out of a field of 213 runners with a personal best time of
25:56, which beat his nearest opponent by 20 seconds.
Finishing second for Swarthmore was Sam Evans 'Ol with a
25th-place finish, which earned him a T-shirt, in 27:40.
Next for Swarthmore was Joe Makin 'O3 with a time of
28:44, followed by Keith Gilmore 'Ol who had a personal-best
30:15. Rounding out the team's top five was Ambrose
Dieringer 'Ol with a time of 31:32. Swarthmore's men finished
31th of 29 teams.
A week later, the women traveled to Vassar College to run
the hilly three-mile course of the annual Seven Sisters
Tournament.
Joko Agunloye 'Ol successfully defended her title as Seven
Sisters champion in a time of 18:09. Finishing next for Swat
was co-captain Alissa Parmelee 'Ol in 26th place, followed
closely by Christen Lungren 'O2 in 27th.
Loring Pfeiffer 'O2 and Kate Baker 'O4 finished fourth and
fifth for the team. Pfeiffer also ran a personal-best time of
21:06. The team finished sixth of seven teams overall.
Coach Pete Carroll called the women's results "a great
performance despite it being fall break for the school."
This weekend, both teams will travel to Westminster, Md.,
for the annual Centennial Conference championship. Agunloye
looks to reclaim her title as Centennial Conference Runner of
the Year, an honor given to the race's winner.
On the men's side, Jeuland will be in contention for the
same honor, and Evans will look to make the All-Conference

the Devil's final touchdown of the game.
There were some bright spots for the Garnet Tide,
though. Running back Ken Clark 'O3 turned in what
was arguably his best performance of the season, running for 121 yards and his first two touchdowns of the
season on 29 carries. Wide receiver Blake Atkins 'O2
recorded a season high for receiving yardage, snagging eight passes for 112 yards.
The Swarthmore defense struggled to stop the
Dickinson ground game, giving up 305 yards on 55
rushes. Three different ballcarriers scored for the Red
Devils, who attempted only eight passes.
This Saturday the Tide (2-4 overall, 1-4 Centennial
Conference) returns to Clothier Field at 1 p.m. for
Homecoming and a conference showdown with the
Franklin & Marshall Diplomats (0-7, 0-4). The Diplomats have struggled mightily this season and are
likely the Garnet Tide's best remaining chance for another win this year.

We want your body. But we want
your soul more. The Phoenix.

Recipe for a real
Homecoming
Though perhaps many Swatties did not experience
it, Homecoming is a traditional part of the American
high school experience. Rooted deep in school spirit
and the love of athletics, it provides a time of
bonding for students on the cusp of adulthood. Urn.
Yeah. So, essentially, it's a hyped-up football game
preceded by a lot of craziness, and usually includes
an event of subjectification of women, i.e. the
Homecoming Queen crowning. Whether your high
school Homecoming was a joyous occasion or not,
did you know that the Swarthmore version is
Saturday? Snicker all you want; this should be a big
deal. But it most likely will only be important for a
small part of the community, while the rest of you will
go on with your usual Saturday business, which
doesn't include wandering down to the football field.
But for all of our general discontent with campus
unity, Homecoming should be enjoyable for all of us.
Some thoughts on a proper Swat Homecoming, and
how to make it more palatable for the entire
community:

Cheerleaders: Considering that we haven't had a

cheerleading program since way back in '94, we'll
have to organize a hasty pep squad. A co-ed group of
people who are always happy, even in the height of
exams. Uniform will consist of standard-issue
Swarthmore Athletics shorts, t-shirt, and sweats. A
shiny garnet sash will be added for a bit of color. All
PeHP (permanently happy people) members will be
given a high-range megaphone. After the game, the
PeHPs will embark on their East Coast tour to avoid
attack by enraged Swatties (both the deaf and the
overly-stressed will be highly dangerous).
Mascot: We are still the "Garnet Tide," despite a
few campus-wide referenda for a "real" mascot. But it
is vital to have a costumed mascot to amuse the
crowd and get in fistfights with the Diplomat. To

involve the academic side of campus, the Bio and Art

Departments are ideal designers of a representation
of the "Garnet Tide." The reasoning? Garnet is a
fancy way of saying red, and red tide is a natural
biological phenomenon. Specifically, it is a high
concentration of microscopic algae (Gymnodinium
breve), and can cause fish kills. Bio can research the
subject, and Art can interpret its findings and create
an artistic rendering. Picture red blob-like things
dancing around at halftime. And you didn't want to
have a traditional mascot.
Halftime Show: Because SWIL is so adept at

hosting alternative forms of entertainment such as
the Pterodactyl Hunt and Human Chess, the group
would be an ideal halftime show organizer. Hopefully,
they would be able to reach out to the non-traditional
fan, thus bringing a more diverse fan base. Perhaps
SWIL could coordinate a dance number with the
PeHP squad.
Tailgating/picnicking/general food
consumption: How's this for an idea? Sharpies could
serve lunch out under a tent near the field! Wait; they
tried that last year. Never mind.
Band: It is surprising that we don't already have a
marching band, considering the wide range of

musical talent and groups that we have on campus.
In order to make sure that no groups are excluded
from a musical representation of campus, each
group, no matter how unofficial, shall elect one

A Haverford defender clears the ball away from Swarthmore attacker Krista Hollis Tuesday afternoon. The Garnet
defeated the Fords 5-2 to improve their Centennial Conference record to 7-2 as they enter the semifinals.

Field hockey seeded 2nd in playoffs
BY MAUREEN VERNON
The Garnet field hockey team notched a key win over
Centennial Conference foe Washington College on October
12. The win pushed the Garnet (13-5, 7-2) into second place
in the conference.
Both teams played a tough first half and went into halftime scoreless, but the Garnet came out determined to take
control. They did, scoring two goals down the stretch. Katie
Tarr 'O2 and Kim Cariello 'O2 scored the goals, and goalkeeper
Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3 turned away thirteen Washington College shots, while the solid defense kept Washington scoreless.
After the Washington game, the team began a four-game
stint over fall break with a 7-1 blow-out over non-conference opponent Neumann College. The diverse attack included goals by five different Swarthmore players. Meg
Woodworth 'O3 and Gretchen Heitz 'O4 scored two goals each,
while Erika Williams 'Ol, Alison Gaffney 'O2 and Cariello
scored one apiece. Senior play-maker Krista Hollis recorded
three assists, Williams had two, and Gaffney pitched in with
one. The entire team contributed to the victory, with the
amazingly deep bench dominating Neumann.
The Neumann game was followed by the annual alumni
game. About twenty players returned for the event, which
ended in a 3-0 alum victory. Assistant coach Kelly Wilcox

'97 notched two goals. The event was a great opportunity for
current and past team members to build connections.
On Tuesday, the team won its fifth consecutive game by
beating Conference foe Bryn Mawr 2-0. The team scratched
the victory out despite unfavorable field conditionsand rain.
The teams went into halftime scoreless, but, in the second
half, Cariello came up with two goals, assisted by Amy
Dißenedetto 'O2 and Kristen English 'OL
The team then traveled to second-ranked Rowan University for non-Conference action. The defense held off a potent
Rowan offense to enter halftime tied at 0-0. The Garnet also
managed to create several offensive drives. Rowan scored
twice in the second half, however, making the score 2-0. The
Garnet did not give up, as English answered with an unassisted goal. The team continued pressuring the Rowan defense until the end of the game, but were unable to tie it up.
Up next for the Garnet was non-conference foe Villa Julie.
The team adapted well to a poorly maintained field and a
hostile crowd. The Garnet came out strong, with Woodworth
scoring twice and English converting a penalty stroke. Villa
Julie did not give up, scoring two goals on potent penalty
corners. However, the defense, led by Tarr, Carly Hammond
'O2, Vivalo and Maureen Vernon 'Ol, was able to hold them
off for the win.
