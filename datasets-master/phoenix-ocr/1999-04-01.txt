"We couldn't

say members

by Nick Attanasio
Brigadier General (Ret.)

Delighting readers and
shocking science faculty, Student Council Co-Chair Jared
Solomon 'Ol posed nude in
this semester's edition ofMatrix, the science-oriented student publication.
Pages 20 and 21 of the
glossy magazine feature the
shamelessly naked Solomon
lounging provocatively in one
of the college's trademark
Adirondack chairs, smiling
and clutching an Erlenmeyer
flask in his left hand.
The first one hundred copies
of the magazine were also
autographed by Solomon at a
signing party yesterday in
Parrish Parlours.
"I've gotten a lot from this
school," said Solomon, "and I
felt that it was time to finally
give something back."
"We've received mixed responses from the piece," admitted Bob Griffin '99, editor
of the magazine. "Most students seemed to enjoy it, but
there was a strong backlash
from the science faculty and
from our printer."
Ultimately however, Griffin
said that Solomon's addition
gave the publication "extra
zing" and significantly expanded the base of Matrix's
readership.

Swat Fire Dept. run
by psych professors
by N. Salvatore Attanasio

Tribal Holy Man

Everyone has always suspected that there's something
a little disturbing about student volunteer firefighters.
Yesterday the psychology
department confirmed it by
announcing that for the past
four years, the fire department
has been part of a massive,
clandestine experiment based
on Pavlovian principles.

Each time the "honker" has
gone off, the psychology department has been there, writing in their little books and
looking smug.
"The experiment has been a
great success," said Prof. Barry
Schwartz, "We actually accumulated all the results we
needed two and a half years
ago, but now we all just get such
a big kick out of watching them
run down the hill in bad weather
that we keep the study going."

When informed of the sham
that is the Swat FD, volunteer
Pete Hutchinson 'OO expressed his disappointment.
"Firefighting his been
such a large part of my life
here at Swat," he said, "now
I don't know what I'll do
it was the only marketable
skill I had.
When asked about the
long-term effects ofthe study
on the subjects, department
faculty declined comment.

In an unprecedented show of
love for the environment,
members ofEarthlust had their
way with Mother Earth.
Witnesses said the group appeared intoxicated and coerced
the Earth into accompanying it
for a walk in the Crum.
"We didn'treally plan it out
or anything," said Gabe
Cummings 'OO, "One thing just
sort of led to another, and next
thing we knew, we were face
down in the dirt, getting it on
like nobody's business."
In a morning press conference, Dean Bob Gross condemned the crime.
"I never would have expected this from Earthlust.
There is a thin line between
love and lust, and last night
they crossed that line."
The incident drew a strong
reaction from other quarters of
the Swarthmore community.
Scott Arboretum intern
Alison Necaise promised immediate reprisals in a series of
livid reserved-students emails, saying, "You can kiss
your free plant clinics
goodbye."

Phoenix moves to Scientists discover
bi-annual schedule alternate duck universe
Staff demands
salary increase

by Mimi Hanaoka
Angry Half-Asian
The Phoenix announced yesterday that it will be changing
to a bi-annual schedule and
proposed that staff salary be
quadrupled.
"We need time to work on
our long-term problems, and
we feel that publishing twice a
year is the only way we can do
that," said Editor in Chief Nick
Attanasio 'OO. "This is only a
transitional stage. After a few
years when we've gotten out
four or five issues nobody will
recognize The Phoenix, and
everybody that knew how
crappy the paper was will have
graduated."
In addition, Attanasio revealed that the pysical size of
The Phoenix would actually

decrease, though the number of
pages would increase. "That
way we can evoke more of a
'City Paper' feel and less of a
'New York Times,'" said the
editor, "we have to be realistic
in our goals." In addition,
Attanasio promised such innovations as articles less than
2,000 words and visible photos.
Al Bloom applauded The
Phoenix's proposal and offered
to pay all editors, writers, and
photographers out of his personal discretionary fund. Staff
members assure the campus
community that the end result
will be "well worth" the
$32,000 a semester.
"I think it's great that The
Phoenix is trying to improve. I
give them my full emotional
and financial support," enthused Bloom.
"We are sick of putting out
shit. It is time for a brand new
Phoenix," said Attanasio.

Suprisingly enough, the parallel duck universe posited in

"Howard the Duck" does in
fact exist, say scientists at MIT.
"The 'Duckiverse' as we like
to call it, appears to be completely identical to our universe, except for the fact that
all of the humans are instead

"As near as we can figure,
they speak English, watch TV
and wear clothes identical to
ours," Pym continued, "which
is either an enormous coincidence or a sign that God is
completely fucked up."

Lucas could not be reached
for comment in person, but did
send a tiny, corpulent hologram of himself to answer
Phoenix queries regarding the
findings. Unfortunately, once
Phoenix reporters removed the
restraining bolt, the hologram
disappeared, but not before it
promised further revelations.
"Nearly every George Lucas
movie is based in reality," explained the hologram. "It's just
that some ofthese realities are
quite unusual."
When asked if this justified
"Willow," the hologram refused to comment.
Scientists are now examining other Lucas films for hints

Survey proves midgets funny
by Nick Attanasio
Course English Major

A recent New York Times/CBS poll confirmed that midgets

are funny.

According to pollsters, midgets beat out weasels, monkeys
and the elderly as the funniest minority group in the country by
a wide margin in nearly every category of humorousness.
The poll reveals that midgets are 65% more likely to be included in the punch line of a successful joke and are 72% more
effective as comic relief in movies and television shows. In addition, when dressed as a priest, construction worker or cowboy, midgets are nearly 90% funnier than members of all comparable groups.
"We think these findings are extremely significant," said pollster Bob A. Wankle, "I'm not sure exactly why, but they are
extremely significant. My god, just think of the implications
this could have for the entertainment industry." Entertainment
industry analyst Leonard Malten agrees, "Imagine a midget Star
Trek or Wheel of Fortune, even a midget Jean Claude Van
Damme movie. That's money in the bank baby."
The poll has recieved some criticism from minority groups,
particularly the Washington, DC weasel lobby, which insists that
the report was unfairly biased.
Regardless of such criticism however, nearly all of the major
networks and film studios have begun work on midget-oriented
productions. NBC plans to replace the terminally unpopular
"Homicide: Life on the Street" with an hour-long midget police
drama tentatively titled "Aggravated Assault: Life at Three Feet"
and Fox has alreay scheduled three installments of "When Midgets Attack" for next season.
More controversially, the WB has elected to replace its enormously popular mascot Michigan J. Frog with a frog-suit-clad
Warwick Davis (of "Willow" fame).

Booksource
owner applies
for opium license
Flanigan offers smack to
"spice up" Ville life
by Justin Kane
Killer Robot

Citing a loophole in existing Ville drug statutes,
Booksource owner Pat Flanigan applied yesterday
for an opium den license.
The loophole in Swarthmore Borough law, which
dates back to 1853, permits opium dens so long as
"the number of opium dens in Delaware County is
commensurate with the population."
If the application is approved, Flanigan plans to
rename his store Ye Olde Opium Den and renovate the interior. Renovations would include the
addition of sensual leather lounges, dark mood
lighting, and the replacement of books with
hardcore smack.
When asked to comment, Vice-President of College and Community Relations Maurice Eldridge
said, "Flanigan is doing Swarthmore a service.
Where else can you find imported cheese, fine dining and pure junk?"
Swarthmore's English department has lobbied
the college for an opium den for years, citing the
"enhanced creativity" and "fucking wicked high"
as reasons.

Expert declares Olde Club "shithole" Entire
by Nick Attanasio
Grand Poobah

Swarthmore partygoers and
Bryn Mawr students alike were
disappointed yesterday upon
hearing the announcement
made by Philadelphia contractor Dean R. Krander that popular party venue Olde Club has
been declared a "complete
shithole" by the state of Pennsylvania.

"You might as well have
your parties in Dupont, Phi Psi
or even Old Tarble," said
Krander yesterday. "Olde Club
is just a messy accident waiting to happen."
Krander said that he was first
alerted to Olde Club's structurally problems when "several
sections" of the building "collapsed" last weekend, injuring
unkempt Swatties and underage Ville kids alike.

The problems facing Olde
Club are merely the latest in a

conditions in Dupont and
Parrish to the lack of storage

space in McCabe and the disease-ridden showers in
Danawell.
In response to student concern, President Al Bloom

Council
resigns
"We don't do

says Council
by Justin Kane
Koffee Kake Konnoisseur

Following the lead of the
four Student Council representatives who have resigned this
year, the entire Student Council proffered theirresignations
yesterday, citing "personal reasons."
When asked about the
Council's reasoning behind the
resignations, Co-Chair Jared
Solomon 'Ol refused further
comment.
Co-Chair Cathy Polinsky '99
reassured fears that all student
support would collapse.
"We don't do jack anyway,"
said Polinsky, "so there's no
need to worry about decreased
student services."
So far student response to the
resignations has been limited
to say the least.
"Until yesterday I didn't
even know we had a Student
Council," said Dan Kraut 'OO.
Said Marvin Barron 'O2 "I
honestly couldn't care less
about SC."
The administration is still
debating whether or not to replace the Council in a special
election. However, SWTL, Josh
Kramer 'OO and Mad Wriggles
have already announced their
candidacies for the potential
election.
"If elected, we will make
capes and Star Trek shirts part
of the College dress code,"
promised SWIL representatives.

Lin '00 resigns as
board observer
by Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
News Editor
Tsong Lin 'OO, the inactive Board of Managers observer, resigned from Student Council last week to
avoid facing impeachment.
Lin, who had served as an
observer since last August,
had only one more Board of
Managers meeting left in
his term when he resigned
over a conflict with SC over
the role of the observer position and his job performance.
"I didn't feel like arguing," said Lin, who resigned
before SC voted on his impeachment.

Active Board of Managers observer Trang Pham
had alleged that Lin slept
through a Board of Manag-

ers meeting, leading SC
member and College Budget Committee representative Matt Schwartz 'Ol to
propose a vote of impeachment at SC's March 22
meeting, according to SC's
unofficial minutes.
Lin is the second board
observer to resign this year.

from SC at the end of last

serving as co-chair. Lin's is
the sixth resignation from

In response to frequent disruptive incidents recently during Upper Tarble parties, Student Council and the Social
Affairs Committee formulated
new safety procedures for the allcampus space. The
Deans had demanded recommendations before
Saturday's formal,
the next event in
the space.
Most of the
changes aim at
promoting more Brian Bell
effective monitoring of the parties. They also
place greater responsibility for
security on the party hosts, according to the proposal submitted to the Deans of the College
on behalf of SAC by co-coordinator Brian Bell '99.
First, SC and SAC are seeking to revitalize the Party Associate (PA) system. "The
problem is that there are so few
students willing to work a
PA's," explained Dean of Stu
dent Affairs TeddXjoundie.
Student Budget Committee
has agreed to provide SAC
with extra funding for the as
sociates supervising Uppe
Tarble. Moreover, SAC wil
now require that the party host
find two to four people to
monitor their parties as well a

having the regular PA's in attendance. Names of those
monitors would now have to be
included on party proposals.
"Party hosts must now internalize the inherent responsibilities of throwing an all-campus event. More than that, the
number of people dedicated to
purely monitoring the event
has doubled," explained the
SAC letter to the deans.
The new party
permit proposal is
also designed to
force students to seriously consider
whether they want
to take on the responsibility of using event spaces
and the important
obligations which
come along with
'99
throwing a party,
according to the SAC letter.
Some students, however, feel
that if PA's have not been effective in the past, they will
most likely not be in the future.
"PA's must be like bouncers
in some senses, and when they
are relatively small or do not
have a physically commanding
presence, how are they supposed
to keep rowdy, drunk, boorish
ruffians from coming in to cause
havoc?" said a senior who
wished not to be identified.
The Deans may seek further
changes before allowing the April
3 party to take place, but Bell and
Student Council co-chair Jared
Solomon 'Ol hope thatthe present
reform proposal will be sufficient
to appease fears of future disruptive incidents.

School of Americas protest receives
attention

About 700 students and activists rallied outside the Philadelphia Museum of
Art Sunday to call for the closing of the U.S. Army's School of the Americas in
Fort Benning, GA, an institution that trains Latin American soldiers.
Protesters at the rally, organized by the School of the Americas Watch, accuse
the school of perpetuating human rights atrocities in Central America, such as
the killing of Archbishop Romero in El Salvador in 1980. At the rally, Father
Roy Bourgeois, a Catholic priest who organized the SOA watch, announced a
resolution signed by 100 Catholic bishops that calls for the closing of the school.
The rally included speeches, folk singing, and street theater, with a reenactment of Romero's assassination by Swarthmore students. A congressional measure that would have closed the School of the Americas failed by only a dozen
votes in November.

GOP targeted on abortion stance

Television advertisements from pro-choice groups accusing GOP presidential
front-runners George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole of masking their anti-abortion positions has expanded to California.
The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL)
expanded the TV spots to Los Angeles Monday. They appear during local and
national news on networks and cable.
Dole has declined to discuss abortion in depth since entering the race. Her
spokesman says she is "pro-life." Bush has been attacked from both sides of the
debate since vowing this month to back a constitutional amendment to outlaw
most abortions if voters supported it, while also saying, "America is not ready to
ban abortions."
Leslie Goodman, a GOP consultant and California Bush supporter, said the
ads were a "public-relations stunt" designed to benefit Democrats. NARAL director Kate Michelman said Bush and Mrs. Dole are "trying hard to obscure
their opposition to a woman's right to choose" in order to court religious conservatives without alienating moderates. "Nocandidate is allowed to avoid addressing
this important, fundamental freedom," Michelman said.

Bryn Mawr Plenary faces quorum
problems

Bryn Mawr's Plenary took two hours to reach quorum on Sunday and then

failed to maintain it, preventing consideration ofresolutions to amend the Self
Government Association (SGA) Constitution.
One third of the student body, or 392 students, need to attend Plenary in order
for quorum to be met, but by the starting time of 1:00 p.m, only about 150 students were present in Thomas Great Hall. At the urging ofPlenary Committee,
members of the audience began to go around campus and encourage other students to attend. Quorum was reached shortly before 3:00 p.m., at which point
members of the SGA immediately presented a resolution to reaffirm self-government, which was passed unanimously without any debate.
Following the passage of this resolution, which allows Bryn Mawr students to
continue having privileges such as self-scheduled exams and club funding, students immediately began to file out ofPlenary, and quorum was once again lost.
Students offered several possible reasons for the difficulty in maintaining quorum, ranging from a lack of understanding about the importance of Plenary and
self government, to the multitude of other events which were scheduled that weekend, such as the Seven Sisters Lacrosse tournament and the Pallas Athena dance.

Open meeting over Constitution results
in heated debate

Executive Council and Haverford College President Tom Tritton received harsh
criticism Tuesday night for their decision to delay the acceptance of the new
Students' Council Constitution recently passed at Spring Plenary. Tritton, who
discussed the controversy with a group of approximately 70 students that gathered in the Campus Center, was the target of both praise and outrage over his
March 19 campus-wide letter expressing concern about the content of the new
Constitution and the process by which it was passed.
As the Bi-College News reported last week, the principal concerns expressed
in the letter were that students are unaware of several ofthe substantive changes
made from the previous Constitution and that the voting process at Plenary was
potentially confusing.
Students' Council co-presidents Jesse Ehrenfeld 'OO and Judson Redmond 'Ol
opened the meeting at 10p.m. by reiterating their reasons for concern as outlined in
the letter. Redmond expressed that the uncertainty in the passing of the new Constitution lies in the fact that some of the changes made were listed in the introduction to
the resolution while other potentially serious changes were to be found only in the
full document. Neither he nor Ehrenfeld mentioned those changes specifically.
In the first few minutes, several students expressed their desire to uphold the
collective decision that had been made at Plenary despite confusions. One student said, "I feel that my power of student government is being averted."
President Tritton, responding to pleas that he defend his decision, chose to
remain silent at first. "This is your meeting. I want to follow a policy of listening rather than talking."
The first defense was made instead by Student Activities Coordinator Zack
First. "This issue had been couched in terms of power," he said. Instead of a
struggle, First told the crowd that he thought the constitutional controversy would
be best seen as an educational opportunity, comparing the administration's move
to that of a professor who hands back a paper to be re-written.
Anthony Minko 'Ol responded to the administration by saying, "If this is an
educational process, please guide us. I want to hear your ideas, from your perspective."

INTERNATIONAL
English and Irish politicians push for

accords

BELFAST, March 31 —Prime Minister Tony Blair pressed Northern Ireland
politicians to enact their nearly year-old peace accord.
Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern arrived at Belfast's Stormont Parliamentary Building together Tuesday to persuade local politicians to form a
Protestant-Catholic government, the centerpiece of the Good Friday peace accord in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland politicians spoke of their hope for
progress before Friday, the latest target date set by the British and Irish governments, but they insisted that others must compromise first.
Even most Protestants who support the accord insist that the Irish Republican
Army must start to disarm before the outlawed group's allied Sinn Fein party
can assume two positions in the 12-member government. The IRA has been
observing a cease-fire since July 1997 but has vowed never to surrender its weapons, regardless ofpolitical developments.

Peaceful pilgrimages in tough times

Two annual pilgrimages occurred in the Middle East last week.
The annual hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, drew 1.7 million pilgrims
to the holy city of Mina in Saudi Arabia. Although 180 were killed last year in a
stampede, this year's pilgrimage passed without incident.
Meanwhile, Christian pilgrims hiked on Palm Sunday from the Mount of Olives to the Old City of Jerusalem. The hike, led by Christian Palestinian children, re-enacts the walk of Jesus into Jerusalem before his crucifixion. Thousands ofpilgrims, from Europe, North America, and the Far East, took the journey and at the end wished peace to each other in at least seven different languages.

Budget Committee did not yet
approve the Social Affairs
Committee's budget for next
year's spring semester. SBC also
reduced SAC's total allocation for
the fall semester, but held the
weekly funding for parties at its
current level.
"Budget Committee felt SAC
needed to make some policy
changes," said SBC member
Shelley Laws 'Ol. "[They]
needed to come up with by-laws
or rules of governing because of
the student concern surrounding
SAC this past year."
The SBC action follows controversy over a SAC-funded Halloween party held last semester at the
Delta Upsilon and Phi Psi fraternities. Some students found the
$3OOO expense more frightening
than the decorations that money

bought.
During its annual spring bud-

geting this year, SBC approved
$8,400 of SAC's request of
$ 11,200for
the fall semester's entertainment. On all but one weekend, SAC will still have $BOO to
spend on Friday and Saturday entertainment, but SBC reduced the
number of weekends for which
SAC is budgeted each semester.
"The committee thought it was
strange that SAC was funded for
14 weekends when parties and
events only happen during 11,"
said Budget Committee treasurer
Josh Bess 'OO.
For the fall semester, SBC also

Campus entertainment is not in
great danger of losing SAC funding for the spring semester. "SAC
is not being punished," Bess maintained.
"SBC plans to work with SAC
and Student Council to come up
with concrete policies and rules
governing SAC," said Laws.
Once SAC adopts them, SBC
will approve a spring semester
budget for the committee as well.
"It would not be responsible behavior for SBC to do that now
when the possibility that the same
old problems could creep up still
exists," Bess said.
The hasty nature of planning
and executing campus entertainment creates some ofthose problems. To buy decorations, last semester Brian Bell '99 and thenSAC co-coordinator Tony
Skiadas '99 initially spent more
student money for the Halloween Party than SAC had approved. Coordinator of Student
Activities Davirah TimmDinkins reimbursed the SAC account afterward.
"Anyone can throw a SAC
party," said Bess, "so most people
who come in to get money for parties are not experienced treasurers." Bess wants SAC to create an
authorization system so money is
only distributed to the proper
people.
SBC allocated only $4OO, half
of a typical weekend's funding, for
the weekend of the Fall Formal,
reasoning that SAC would not
sponsor other parties on the same
night as the formal.

Off-campus computers

by Andrew Fefferman
Staff Writer

A proposal to install public

There is no space in PPR
and Woolman for a "secure

who added, "That means behind closed and locked doors."
Student Council Co-Chair
Jared Solomon 'Ol said SC had

considered the possibility of
converting rooms in PPR and
Woolman to computer labs.
However, Solomon stated that
now this would be impossible
due to the size of the student
body next year.
Solomon said that a large
concern is that there is no public computer space available to
students after 2 a.m., regardless of one's residence. He
said that a part of the upcoming renovation ofMcCabe will
be to add a space that would
be open to students 24 hours a

Specs to hit Swat next weekend
by Hilary Rice
Staff Writer

Swarthmore has made its admissions decisions and sent out
the letters, and now the 865
admitted students must make
their decisions. In order to help
the admitted students decide
which college is for them,
Swarthmore will be sponsoring
its annual Pre-Frosh/Spec
Weekend on April 10-11.
Pulled from an applicant
pool of approximately 4,200,
the 865 potential members of
the Class of 2003 have beat out
over 3000 other highly qualified applicants in order to be
offered admission to the College. The Class of 2003 already
includes 132 early-decision

applicants, and the Admissions
Office expects that when the
whole process is over the class
will be about 360 strong.
Several hundred of those students accepted for admission
next year are expected to visit
the College for Spec Weekend.
The purpose ofthis program is
to bring admitted students to
campus for a weekend and give
them the opportunity to talk to
current students, get a feel for
the campus and attend one or
two classes. For some, it will
be their first visit to the campus, and for many the first time
they have stayed overnight in
a Swarthmore dorm.
This year the Admissions
Office has expanded the program to include both Saturday

and Sunday nights. Students
are invited to come for one or
both nights, but they are expected to stay for both.
In order to pull this off, the Admissions Office needs students to
volunteer to host the specs. A full
weekend of activities has been
planned for the prospective students, so the responsibility for entertainment does not fall squarely
on the hosts' shoulders. The Admissions Office requests that students interested in hosting one or
more specs drop by the Admissions Office and fill out a hosting
form.
Of course, for those students
who want nothing to do with a
campus full of specs, now is a
good time to start making
travel plans.

It's unheard of for a rock concert." The group will now be on

Both Haverford and Bryn

"Tri-Co doesn't really do

said Rogers.

that the band would be set up in

SC must propose fullfledged student center
Administrators and students seem to be speaking different
languages when it comes to the vitally important issue of
facilities on this campus. Unsurprisingly, and perhaps understandably, administrators place less of a priority on student
space than do students. The problem, however, is that the
administration seems unaware of student concerns about
facilities, and if they stay so uninformed, the consequences
for student life could be extreme.
It should be the job of Student Council to inform the
administration of these concerns. The most important task of
SC is to improve student life, whether through reexamining
work-study, providing a course review booklet, or addressing
the issue of facilities use. To that end, it is imperative that SC
submits a clear, comprehensive proposal to Al Bloom, and
that they do so now.
There are several ideas floating around about student space on
campus, none of which are acceptable. The facilities planning
subgroup (a long-term planning body composed of administrators, faculty and only one current student, Josh Knox '99)
prioritized four major facilities projects: renovations of DuPont,
Parrish, McCabe and the issue of student space. They determined
that student space had the lowest priority.
Conversely, in a Phoenix poll administered last November
to over 130 students, student space was the first priority
followed by renovating DuPont and Parrish.
Certainly the issues of safety in DuPont and Parrish are
important, yet since students seem so interested in the idea of
improving student space, and since student space obviously
needs an immense amount of improvement, SC should
present student concerns to administrators and keep students
informed of their progress.
Currently, the amorphous plans for student space focus on
moving admissions offices up to the second floor of Parrish
and possibly reorganizing Tarble. This alone is not enough,
especially since there is such confusion surrounding how this
"Parrish option" will actually be executed.
For example, at SC meetings the idea is discussed as one
that will clear out all of Parrish's first floor, leaving offices
open for the many groups in need of space or better facilities
(Student Budget Committee, SC, student publications,
Intercultural Center facilities, etc.). However, at SC's
sparsely-attended collection, Al Bloom suggested that Parrish
first would be "student space" only in the sense that is would
house both student groups and student services, an important
distinction.
In this scheme, Parrish would still house administrative offices
such as the registrar, the deans (quite a stretch) and the CP&P
Even were the college not trying to plan for the long term and
only sought to accommodate existing space demands from
students, such a plan would prove woefully inadequate.
Ultimately, Tarble is too bizarre a space to meet students'
needs, and Parrish is asked to accommodate too many disparate groups already. Unless the college dispenses with the idea
of housing students in Parrish, there will never be enough
space for administrators and student groups.
The solution is easy to see. Swarthmore needs a genuine
student center that can house student groups, accommodate
parties and performances and have a game room that is
accessible and worthwhile.
A completely new building. It's that simple.

Letters
Both calendar change proposals unacceptable
To the Faculty, the Provost and the Editor:
We must not, as a community, make the
mistake of shortening any part of the spring
semester. Neither shortening instructional
time or doing further damage to reading
week(end), are acceptable to the student
body, necessary or in the best interests of this
college as an educational institution.
I do not see why a parallel between the Fall
and Spring semesters "might be a good
thing." If it is, why not consider lengthening
the Fall semester by one week?
I also don't see why our calendar ought to
be compared to Haverford's or Bryn Mawr's,
as these institutions are not analogous to
Swarthmore in regards to the type or intensity
of instruction. Furthermore, I would present
these arguments as to why the calendar
cannot be shortened:
Shortening the calendar pressures financial
aid students even further to meet large workstudy requirements in a given number of
days. By reducing the number of days, the
college will not be able to meet its oncerevised promise that students will only have
to work about eight hours. This figure already
assumes that students work through Spring
Break and exam week. We only just made the
move from "about seven" to "about eight."
Are we now ready to creep up to eight and a

Cutting the calendar puts more pressure on
the annual budget to either reduce work
requirements, or harm our institutional
commitment to be a place where study time is
not a function of [social] class. Either our
endowment or our sense of community will
suffer.
Shortening the calendar will increase stress.
Students will have either less time to study for
exams or less time to cover the same syllabi
and write the same papers. The only alternative is to compromise the quality of instruction and have professors reduce what each
course covers. Personally, I came to
Swarthmore to learn with the idea of doing a
good part of that learning in class. If the time
I can spend at Swarthmore falls by 3.7%, I
expect my tuition to fall by the same amount.
Both options presented to the student body
are unacceptable to me, nearly every student
I've spoken to, and the interests of
Swarthmore. If there are substantive problems that shortening the calendar would solve,
I hope we can reach consensus on a solution
doesn't place the entire burden on one constituency. Doing otherwise would violate the
spirit of decision-making by consensus that
has made Swarthmore the great place it is

Matt Schwartz 'Ol

Diploma should remain unchanged
To the editor:
Our global society reflects many verbal
traditions that have incorporated themselves
into our daily lives and thoughts. While often
based in religion, they eventually take on a
life of their own, and their connections to
their roots become less important than the
ideas that they have come to represent. Such
is the case with "in the year of our Lord" on
Swarthmore's diplomas.
For almost five centuries, our Western
calendars have designated years with "Anno
Domini." In those five centuries, the convention has gained meaning beyond that which
designates the year as being in the Christian
Era. It is just a nice way to say "not 4,000
years ago."
I also would like the committee to consider
the other parts of the diploma (and life at
Swarthmore) that have religious roots. First,
the simple numbering system of our years is
based in Christian history. Should we remove
the numerical designation as well? We could
measure time on the diploma with reference
to when the College was founded, or perhaps
from the founding of the United States. Next,

by changing the wording to "in the month of
June," we are still paying homage to European
traditions, since the exact placement of
months as we know them stem from the Julian
(and later Gregorian) ideas on how to measure
a year. From this perspective, the wording as
it stands, "in the sixth month," is less controversial.
Finally, we should consider the foundations
upon which this institution has been built. The
Quaker tradition from which we draw our
love of peace, our humble attitudes, and the
value we place on personal growth is—gasp—firmly based in Christian theology. It is an
integral part of this wonderful school and its
rich history.
If the wording on the diploma was exclusionary in any way, I would support a change.
It is not exclusionary, however —at least not
more so than, say, the fact that the diploma is
written in lofty English. Yes, it is a religious
reference, but our world is full of those. The
mere fact that on one level it refers to a broad
religious idea is not enough to warrant
removal.

Bringing P-Funk to Swat costly
To the Editor:
Given confusion over the production costs
a show like George Clinton and the P-funk
All-stars would incur, I want to write a few
words from the perspective of someone close
to the project. As Production Intern at the
Lang Performing Arts Center, I was close at
hand when the bidding for production costs
occurred, and I am sure that given the desires
of the presenter, Horatiu Stefan '01 —an
outdoor show on Parrish beach—the show
would have cost significantly more than what
Clinton's Managers claim. Their $30,000
figure includes a $25,000 fee, which I've
heard is somewhat negotiable, and another
$5,000 to $lO,OOO production budget. This,
Clinton claims, would do the show.
After presenting Clinton's technical
specification to two separate production
companies in the area, it was determined that
production costs for the show would shoot
into the range of $25,000 to $30,000. Before
you go into shock and disbelief, I urge you to
consider the costs at hand. Clinton required a
state-of-the-art sound system. He required
two sound consoles, the ticket price of which
is in the $90,000 range each, and whose
rental reflects this for obvious reasons. He
also required microphones.-speakers, cable,

amplifiers, etc. He required a stage to present
his band of almost 20 performers, and a
lighting rig. All of this requires trussing and
remote power (remember, the plan is to be
outdoors powering over one hundred 1000
watt lamps.)
This is not just about rentals. Somehow you
have to set all of this up and strike it too. To
hire a union crew and security for a three-day
gig is another cost to consider, and none of
the bidding my office did even included the
hospitality for the event. Clinton required an
office of his own, a limo, housing for his band
of 20, food, and a personal massage therapist.
None of these requests is unreasonable.
Clinton is an act which draws arena-size
crowds, and most presenters depend on hiked
ticket sales to make their overhead. I agree
that his show would have been fun. I also
agree that large budget spectacular may be
something the College wants to spend its
money on. Our office determined that the
event would have cost the College $50,000 to
$60,000, a figure which is very different from
the figures printed in this paper. What I
disagree with is misleading the student body
as to the reasonable costs such events require.

Liberals and conservatives
should stop pretending to discuss philosophy. Too often disagreements arise—not from any
conflicting ideas on specific issues, but from two different
ideological paths that both aim
for the same goal.
If people continue to search
for a perfect ideological path,
they will never get anywhere.
Perfect ideological paths simply do not occur in this imperfect world, and searching for
one can only lead to gridlock.
Instead, people should be more
accepting of alternative views
and realize that although they
appear different, most people
are actually trying to accomplish the same thing.
The scope of political issues is a result of differing
viewpoints that emerge not
from differing ideas on a certain issue, but conflicts about
larger goals. For instance,
people that support the death
penalty do not value human
life any less than those that
are against it, and voters
against the death penalty do
not believe that violent
crimes are less hurtful than
those that wish criminals to
die for their actions. Both
want equity for both the
criminal and the victims, but
have differing viewpoints on
how to achieve their goals.
There is not an appreciable
difference between liberals
and conservatives other than
the methods with which each
group strives to achieve its
goals.
To slightly confuse the matter, I feel obliged to mention
that the same plan can have

Diploma
does not
need to be
reworded
by Mimi Hanaoka
Managing Editor

I vehemently oppose the proposition that the diploma should be
changed from "... .this first day of the
sixth month of in the year of our lord
one thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine," to "...this first day of
the month of June one thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine."
First, I would like to call to attention that the current phrase is so commonplace that it is now divorced from
its original religious connotations.
Keep in mind that the proposed wording still uses the standards of Anno
Dommini and Before Christ or Before the Common Era: the underlying standards would remain the same.
Second, there are no substantive
harms under the existing system. If
there are no compelling harms that
are inherent to the current wording,
it does not merit a change. Insofar as
no serious and substantive harms
have been presented under the current system, I see no reason to needlessly change the wording of the diploma.
It is imperative that we keep in
mind the nature of a diploma: it is
above all something symbolic of the
diligent effort that it takes to earn a
Swarthmore degree. The diploma
confers an honor upon its recipient
not because of its particular wording
but because it is symbolic ofthis diligent productivity.
There is also a dangerous precedent
being set in changing something as
important as the diploma since doing so implies that something as symbolic as the diploma is subject to constant and possibly annual change.
What if the Class of 2001 decides that
they do not want this amendment to
their diploma and that they want to
revert to the traditional diploma? If
the administration grants and institutes this change to the diploma it effectively establishes the diploma as
something so unremarkable that it is
subject to change according to a particular class year.
Lastly, the proposed change to the
diploma is petty and sends the message that Swarthmore students and
administration are obsessed with semantic changes that have no concrete
impact. If the Swarthmore students
and administration collectively do
something, it should be about serious and consequential issues on
which the entire college community
has a strong opinion.
There is clearly no reason to change
the diploma: not only is the phrase
in question now stripped of its original religious connotations but the alternate phrase which is being proposed still espouses the same standards. No compelling need as to why
the diploma should be changed has
been demonstrated. Both the administration and the students would be
setting a dangerous precedent by implicitly stating that something as
symbolic and as weightily as the diploma should be subject to the subjective views of every class. In addition, this change to the diploma
amounts to no more than a petty semantic change that has no substantive impact.

Kevorkian's popularity has
suffered from publicity stunts.
Last year, he announced a plan
to privately harvest organs
from suicide patients and provide them for transplants, and
in this most recent case, he provided footage of the suicide to
"60 Minutes," which televised
it nationally.
But the primary reason "Dr.
Death" has escaped conviction,
not to mention prosecution, in
the past but could not escape it
last week is that physician-assisted suicide (PAS in legal
circles) is on shaky ground in
the legislatures, the courts and
the Constitution. Acts which
may or may not be criminal,
may or may not be applicable
to specific laws and may or
may not be upheld in appellate
courts are unlikely to lead to
incarceration with any sort of

consistency.

What we need, then, is con-

sistency—judicially, legisla-

tively and medically. And if

have anything
to say on the
matter. Whether PAS is to be
accepted as a permissible practice in any state, as it now is in
Oregon, or it is to be banned,
the state-level courts or state
constitutions need to address
the ambiguity surrounding
which are the laws under
which doctors may be tried for
engaging in PAS or, if it is legal, disobeying regulations.
PAS may be against a PASspecific law, or it may be second-degree murder, but it is
certainly not both.
Michigan has clearly failed
to clarify this distinction, and
the legitimacy of PAS continues to be unclear in that state.
If laws or constitutions explicitly stated which laws are violated by PAS, consistency in
conviction (or acquittal) would
be much smoother.
In the legislative realm,
states have the responsibility to
pass specific laws regulating or
criminalizing PAS. On the surface, regulation may not seem
so complicated, but in fact, it
is. States that choose to legalize PAS must specify PAS eligibility to prevent abuse, an accusation even PAS supporting
Americans fire at Kevorkian.
Legislators must mull over
.

the following questions, to
name but a few: Must a patient
be "terminally ill" to request
PAS, and what life expectancy
does the term "terminal" imply? What if a patient will live
indefinitely but with an exand
tremely
painful
unrelievable condition? Must
the patient be "mentally competent" to request PAS, and
what does mental competence
mean when coupled with terminal illness? How many times
must a patient request PAS,
must there be a witness to the
request, and what sort of waiting periods are appropriate?
And in states where PAS is legal, may non-residents travel
from other states to take advantage of legal PAS?
Finally, ethical and procedural issues must be settled
within the health services profession both independent of
and in conjunction with legal
regulations. Decisions such as
which lethal drugs can be prescribed and which physicians
can prescribe them need to be
made, especially since some
physicians are more qualified
in pain management techniques (clearly a favorable alternative to PAS) than others.
There are arguments for and
against the physician being
present at a patient's death, but
the medical profession should
reach consensus in this matter.
Also of concern is that some
physicians, as conscientious
objectors, may refuse to participate in legal PAS, limiting
patients' access to doctors they
trust.
In short, PAS is a complicated issue, legal or criminal.
Jack Kevorkian does not have
the answers, but neither do
most of us.

Since I don't have time to
write my opinion on the brown
paper bag board in the foyer of
Sharpies,
which may
or may not
still exist, I
shall take
this opportunity to get
a few of my
thoughts on
the subject
out in the open.
I was going to start with the
Karaoke/video/jukebox, but that
seems to have gone by the wayside. But I still have a few questions: Did it have a TV screen
for a reason? Why did it only
play Madonna B-sides?
But on to more pressing matters, such as bowls. Now, I'm
not a big bowl guy in general,
but sometimes I like to have a
salad or some soup. (Side note:
more New England Clam
Chowder. Especially when I
get there late and it's beginning
to condense —the best. However, "Seafood Chowder" isn't
going to cut it. Soup, by its
nature, is sketchy enough.
Don't make it worse by replacing clam with seafood. I know
it's not clam in the first place;
I hesitate to imagine what's in
the seafood.) I wish to dispel
any rumors over the scarcity of
bowls that there often seems to
be. It's not because anyone is
stealing them or wasting them
or anything like that. It's because a solid 70% of them are
perpetually dirty. If you go
through those stacks, you can
only use about one in three, because the rest have a black residue on them or still contain
dish water. In either case, you
can understand our reservations.

It's odd, because the dishes
don't seem to suffer from this
troubling malady. While sometimes wet, I've

at least as important as the Free

don't haveRichard Gere behind
us, we do have the encouraging
fact that we won't have to fight
a communist nuclear power.
I realize that people with
jobs don't keep the same hours
as college students. And I also
realize that there is only a finite amount of food that can
be prepared and served and
that it is inevitable that you are
going to run out of something
sometime. I also understand
(I'm very understanding) that
Sharpies does close at a very
specific time and that you want
to go home.
I say that there should be food
in Sharpies until at least 7 on
weekdays. I'm a little fuzzy on
what the actual hours are, but if
you come in at 6:45, you're in a
pretty big hole. Anything popular (i.e., good) is gone, and there
seems to be very little to replace
it. It's not as if it would go to
waste anyway. We all understand
and appreciate the rotating bar
phenomenon, where dishes migrate until eaten. I'm just saying
some of us can't come earlier

What should constitute graduation requirements?
Swat should make students go abroad
by Vanessa Jan n- Jordan
Staff Writer

Graduating from a campus this sheltered, you can't be considered learned
unless you've had a taste of the world
and all of its peculiarities. The Swarthmore College experience on its own
is a $30,000 per year anomaly that may
help you to think, read and write academically; but it falls short ofinstructing you about the real textures of life.
A semester away from Swarthmore
means fewer opportunities to explore
Swat course material, but living in a
foreign country for several months will
enhance every other aspect of students'
college experience. Instead of having
to fulfill two Primary Distribution requirements and one extra course in
each of the discipline groupings, Swarthmore students should be required to
go abroad. The semester abroad ought
to replace the three non-PDC's and the
language requirement (I've always
firmly believed that it is exceedingly
more appropriate to learn a language
abroad than in the classroom).
Swarthmore students ought not to be
allowed to spend their entire lives without ever having left North America, and
resort vacations do not constitute part
of what travelling is really about. I fear
that if students don't live abroad by the
time they graduate from college, they
never will. It is so depressing to hear
of students who have no desire to find

it is frustrating to hear of students who
desire to go abroad but are unable to
do so due to departmentalrestrictions.
There is no learning like experiential learning; and for library-bound
Swatties in particular, real world life
will contribute immensely to an education. Living abroad is a tremendous
way to get a different perspective on
one's own life and culture, and it adds
new flavor to almost every aspect of
daily existence.
We all need to be exposed to malaria
and dysentery at some time or another.
I'm not joking: the US is so sterile that
we are clueless about what people with
bad sewage and rats in their kitchens
go through. The challenge oftravelling
to "bizarre" places develops character
and initiative, qualities that will be useful to all in the future. We are here to
learn, not just within our comfort zone,
but to get a full exposure to the world
around us.
Let the Indiana Jones in us come out,
and find out what is really going on behind all of those National Geographic
photos. Besides, distance makes the
heart grow fonder, and it is easier to
fully take advantage ofthe Swarthmore
"ivory tower" once you've been to a
far-away place. As T. S. Eliot wrote,
"We shall not cease from exploration,
and the end ofall our exploring will be
to arrive where we started... and know
the place for the first time."

String of Student Council resignations irresponsible, disappointing
In the Spring of 1997, after a most
contentious year that witnessed an
explosive debate over the relationship
between Student Council and Budget
Committee, Council managed to stay
above the fray of controversy, ending
the year on a positive note by electing
two officers, whom they both considered highly competent and enthusiastic,
to the positions of Co-Chair.
But the positive momentum did not
last. After a summer's worth of deliberation, on the first week of classes in
September, Co-Chair-elect Mandara
Meyers '99 announced her decision to
resign as Co-Chair and from Council
altogether. In an interview with The
Phoenix, Meyers claims she had
become disillusioned with Council,
referring to the frequent infighting that
had occurred the previous semester.
She also attributed her decision to a
shift in interests, explaining how "she
could not devote enough time to those
new areas provided she remained on

Like Meyers, Pham too felt that her

were being compropersonal life
mised by her work on Council.
Unfortunately the inauspicious start
was only the beginning. In the Spring
of 1998, Council found itself on the
verge of impeaching Board of Managers Observer Laura Barandes '99 on
charges of overstepping her prescribed
powers. Barandes resigned last minute
to avoid impeachment.
It was a tumultuous year that most
Council members
and indeed many
students
would rather forget.
Last semester when veteran Council
members Hugh Weber 'OO and Ryan
Peterson 'OO were elected as CoChairs, Council observers thought the
nightmare had ended for good. With

quality leadership at the helm and a
brand new lineup, Council seemed to
have finally found its footing.
But the rainbow after the storm has
yet to been found. Whatever rosy
predictions that Council may have
inspired did not stay untarnished for
long.
At the beginning of last semester,
Brian Burnheter 'Ol resigned from his
post as Council Treasurer, citing,
according to a Phoenix report, a "lack
of enthusiasm to continue serving the
Swarthmore community." In late
November, following hot on the heels
of Burnheter, Co-Chair Weber resigned
towards due to personal reasons. Just
last week Appointments Chair Ken
Kim 'Ol also threw in the towel. Kim
did not even bother to
explain his resignation
except for issuing a
brief disclaimer,
stating that his decision "had nothing to
do with school,
politics, or any conflicts within Student
Council."

the members have displayed and the
self-righteous manner in which they

Banning alcohol causes kneejerk reactions on campuses
by Dave Ellis
Contributing Writer
Newsflash: Too much alcohol can have
adverse effects. On occasion, throughout
the nation there are a few alcohol-related
deaths every year. This is a tragedy.
However, I firmly believe that this tragedy will not only not be rectified, but will
be amplified by the administrations of
universities across the nation that have
chosen to make theircampuses dry, from
lowa to M.1.T., with the latest example
being University of Pennsylvania And
this issue is relevant at Swarthmore too.
The recent Swarthmore addendum to
the student survey dealt exclusively
with alcohol-related issues. Does anyone doubt that the administration perceives alcohol as being a campus problem, and is looking for solutions?
No longer can Penn have an undergraduate party with alcohol that is official in any substantial capacity. This essentially means that those students still
wishing to drink have to drink quietly and
unnoticed in their rooms or venture to offcampus watering holes, always a sketchy
proposition at Penn.
Inevitably, college kids are going to
drink prodigious amounts of alcohol. The
only question is where this is going to be
imbibed: in a groupatmosphere with constant monitoring and the ability for central authorities to cut offthe bar, or in private with minimal observance and unlimited access to the pump?
All we have to do is to look at Swarthmore College for an answer to this question. No one ever gets smashed beyond
recognition at official campus functions.

ground.
Indeed, perhaps the fact that candidates let alone officers are a scarcity
these days has contributed to a highly

conception of
responsibility on the part ofresigning
Council members.
A responsible Council member
should serve out his or her term,
regardless of the circumstances.
Resignation should not be an option
unless circumstances make it inevitable. We doubt if any student on this
campus in the right frame of mind
would dispute this assertion.
And a closer inspection will reveal
that many ofthe reasons supplied by
these members
deviate from this
traditional definition
ofresponsibility, and
sometimes appear
downright ludicrous.
Resigning members
who cite "a change in interest" or "a
decline in enthusiasm," if they were
truly responsible, should have anticipated these possibilities before they
decided to run. The fact they did not
shows an utter lack of respect for the
office they held. If they did, but simply
couldn't "deal," so to speak, then that is
simply a reflection of their, for lack of a
better word, "flakiness."
A common argument used by
resigning members, touted by both
Pham and Burnheter, is that because
they are losing interest in their jobs,
they feel like Council and members
"deserve better," as if to suggest that
resigning is a responsible thing to do.
"I firmly believe that the Swarthmore
community deserves much more than a
halfhearted attempt at student leadership and I hope the new [CRC] coordinator will be able to serve that role,"
wrote Pham in her resignation letter.
Pham even seemed to purport that she

was acting in a responsible manner by
delaying her resignation until after the
Co-Chair elections. At that point, she
told The Phoenix, Council, was "stable
enough" to carry on without her
presence.
The least that resigning members can
do, in atonement for either their waning
attentions or downright incompetence,
is to complete their terms. But to act as
if they are doing the morally right thing
by resigning is morally despicable.
Another appalling aspect of the recent
spate ofresignations is the fact that
resigning members did not show one
modicum of shame about their actions.
The picture accompanying the Phoenix
story on Weber's resignation showed a
gleeful Weber, pizza in one hand,
eagerly giving a thumbs-up to the
photographer. Resignation is not a
glorious act. It is shameful. While we do
not expect resigning members to engage
in elaborate rituals ofremorse a la
Japanese cabinet ministers, it is an insult
to us, the campus community, that they
do not indicate at all that their decisions
are at the very least, regrettable.
The credibility of Council has
already suffered tremendously because
of the proliferation ofresignations and
it certainly cannot afford another blow.
Council must make its members
recognize that resignation is irresponsible behavior. One way of achieving
this would be to establish constitutional
countermeasures that render resignation difficult except under extreme
circumstances. Council should also
make clear to prospective candidates
the rigors of serving on Council and if
possible, to verify informally that these
candidates are indeed up to the task.
We, the student body, for our part
should make clear to Council and to
resigning members that their behavior
is unacceptable.
At this crucial juncture what we need
is committed and competent student
leaders, not cowardly cop-outs.

FEATURES
Money, responsible life not incompatible
by Linda Thai
Features Editor

Can you live a socially and
ethically responsible life and
still make money? "Yes, but
with difficulty," said Thompson Bradley, Department Chair
of ModernLanguages and Literature.
On Friday, Mar. 19, students,
faculty, and alumni gathered
together for a panel titled, "Socially Responsible Lives." During the meeting, the panelists
addressed the basic yet challenging issue of how one could
live a socially and ethically responsible life and still make
money while at Swat and after
graduation. It is an especially
pressing question for students
at Swarthmore because many

of them come from backgrounds ofcommunity and social service and the college
promotes Quaker values. In
order to answer that question,
panelists discussed what opportunities were available at
Swarthmore now and what was
planned for the future.
Panelists included Career
Planning and Placement Director Tom Francis, Modern Languages and Literature Department Chair Thompson Bradley, Swarthmore/Chester Coalition representative Neilda
Mott, Alumni Counsel representative Roberta Chicos and
Connection Head for the New
York Alumni connection
Deborah B ranker Harrod.
They discussed opportunities for students to get socially

involved now, like participating in externship programs and
volunteering in community
service projects such as
Swarthmore/Chester
Coalition's Bridges program,
which deals with conflict resolution and increasing literacy.
They also announced some
tentative ideas to increase
awareness ofthese issues, like
having national and regional
on-line discussions to promote
and organize conversations for
specific fields.
In addition, Deborah
Brunker suggested one of the
more popular ideas: the creation of a portfolio in the Career Planning and Placement
office that would highlight socially and ethically responsible
livelihoods. Recalling her own

Finding a summer job made easy

-1) Evaluate yourself. What

experience as a Swarthmore
undergraduate considering her
job options, she remembered
always seeing prominently displayed, slick portfolios for
major corporations like Prudential but having to research
and piece together on her own
information about careers in
education. Many students attending the panel echoed
Brunker's feelings that there
was a lack of emphasis and
available information on socially responsible livelihoods.
The growing problem lies
not with living this way while
at college, but with maintaining that idealism in the world
beyond Swarthmore. One
thing to do is realize that "being in the profit field does not
exclude you from leading so-

daily and ethically responsible
lives," as one alumni emphatically stated. It is not about
choosing between just social
work or making money, but
about balancing priorities.
Many alumni agreed that
doing their job well was very
important to them and that taking on externs and interns
added to that feeling of helping the community. An example given of a balanced job
is working in a corporation's
community and public relations office, thereby balancing
the need to make money with
an idealistic hope of helping
the community.
Overall, there was a consensus that, if one takes the initiative to do so, one can balance
the two.

Career

Planning and Placement
Office is almost a misnomer
for an office that does much
more than career planning, and usually empowers students to locate job
opportunities themselves rather than
placing them with employers. The
CP&P exists as a resource facility
to help students prepare for and locate summer jobs and internships,
explore career paths and plan their
first years after graduation.
The office houses an extensive
collection of informational books,
pamphlets and newsletters detailing
various opportunities. Compiling
notices of job and internship openings as they are issued, as well as
providing a forum for recruiting
companies and organizations to visit
campus, the CP&P ensures that students have current and useful employment information.
In addition to the print resources
and the counseling services available in the office, the CP&P harnesses the vast network of alumni

Six Career Peer Advisors are
available on weekday afternoons
and evenings to assist students with
writing resumes, cover letters and
locating resources.
Any and every student is encouraged to make an appointment to
speak with one of the professional
staff members to help direct a job/
internship search.
Beginning a search can be the
most difficult part of the process.
Visiting the office regularly to
browse the bookshelves, speak with
the staff and read the latest internship and job opportunities can help
familiarize you with your options.
It is always helpful to speak with
people who have done or are doing
what you want to do. The CP&P
keeps a record ofprevious students’
summer experiences and also has
access to an extensive database cataloging the experiences of alumni for
student use.
Getting advice from professors in
your field of interest is also one of
the best ways to begin.

of a slew of events organized by the Alumni Relations Office for Alumni
Weekend March 19-20, the Alumni
Luncheon gave a chance for
Swatties past and present to come
together and network over good
food and conversation in Upper
Tarble.
Every student received an allcampus e-mail inviting them to sign
up for the luncheon. However, only
the first 80 who signed up in the Career Planning & Placement Office
were selected to participate.
Subsequent e-mails informed the
participants of the various subjects
upon which alumni would touch.
From that point on participants in
the luncheon congregated at noon to
sit with alumni who graduated from
as far back as 1937 to as recently as
1998.
The alumni and students discussed
fields of interest ranging from law
to entertainment. Even an “eclectic

alumni. Linda Thai ‘O2 felt that the
conversation was informal —almost

surprisingly so.

She said that she found herself
having “the kind of conversation I
didn’t expect with my peers. We
talked about issues ranging from
how to break into journalism to the
positive contribution of Viagra.”
At Gholston’s table, the conversation also diverged. Alumni from
the classes ’37 and ’3B argued in
favor of finding mates in the
“Quaker Matchbox,” while more
recent graduates of ’93 and ’94 argued against Swatties marrying
Swatties.
Two large constituents of alumni
were lobbied by the school to take
part in the luncheon as representatives: the black alumni and the
Alumni Council, whose aim it is to
connect students with alumni. A
third group, the casually formed
“Philly connection,” served as a
third pool.
In total, about 900 alumni were
contacted by mail and about 70

Board of Managers’ recently instituted Young
Alumni Challenge continues
to be successful in its goal of increasing young alumni giving.
Spearheaded by Chairman of the
Board of Managers Larry Shane
and President A 1 Bloom, the Challenge was developed in response to
the relatively low young alumni
annual giving levels. Alumni giving is often used as an indicator of
institutional strength and alumni
satisfaction.
The Challenge group consists of
3,432 alumni from the classes of
1984-1998 who did not participate
in the 1998 Alumni Fund. The
Board of Managers will match dollar-for-dollar every Alumni Fund
donation this group makes for both
Fiscal Year 1999 and Fiscal Year
2000.
While the Challenge was originally slated to cover only Fiscal
Year 1999 contributions, the An-

nual Giving Office reports that “27
Managers have increased their personal contributions...creating a
matching total more than adequate
to cover the Challenge response for
Fiscal Year 1999 and Fiscal Year
2000.”
The extended Challenge will
match donations from the same
3,432 alumni, regardless of
whether they took part in the Fiscal Year 1999 Challenge. Indeed,
it is hoped that many alumni will
find the extended Challenge an irfcentive to begin giving on an annual basis.
Another new feature of the Fiscal Year 2000 Challenge is the
Class of ’99. With their graduation
this May they join the ranks of
young alumni included under the
guidelines of the Challenge.
As of March 16, 648 members of
the Challenge group (or 18.88 percent) had responded with a gift.
Their total gifts have reacted
$27,378 and continue to grow as the
year progresses. The Challenge
group now makes up nearly four

percent of the total alumni giving
population, which Director of Annual Giving Patricia Laws says is
“nearly twice the participation gain
we anticipated.”
In addition to gains in total
alumni participation, the Annual
Giving Office reports that “a number of classes have realized doubledigit gains as a direct result of the
Challenge.”
The Class of ’97 may provide the
most dramatic example of the success of the Young Alumni Challenge.
Class participation as of Feb. 28,
1998, was only a little over four percent and donations totaled a little
over $3OO.
At the same time this year, and
with the introduction of the Challenge, Class of ’97 participation
levels have skyrocketed to more
than 32 percent and donations now
total well over $3,000.
The Board of Managers has yet yo
decide whether the Young Alumni
Challenge will become an annual
program or be discontinued after Fiscal Year 2000.

pulls it off.
Though "Impossible..." is
undoubtedly the best, there's
no track on this album that
warrants skipping. The stories
are all short and great, marked
by a taste for the exceptional
ordinary. There are a few sung
tracks that break up the prose
of the album, and they are idiosyncratic pop gems. It's really a good thing that David
hasn't totally devoted his time
to B&S, because his talents
that come through on this
record don't get adequate attention in the ensemble's more
popular work.

The best thing about this
new pop record is its totally

quality.
Jumprope's first full-length is
so comically over-affected
and loungy it sounds like
karaoke. The singing is sultry, the instrumentals are
nude and fun, and the band
is exuberant! This is not studied unprofessionality; these
people really don't know how
to make a modern record.
The result, however, is super.
The soft pop is obvious,
and the band's impressive
amateurism makes this album
accessible in a block-party
kind of way. Play this outside
at a barbecue with your
friends, and you'll feel like
you've got four more friends
jamming in the grass for
kicks. Play it while you're
writing your seminar paper
and you'll feel like you're
outside at a barbecue with
your friends, four of whom
are jamming in the grass for
kicks. This is music that
never will be, and never
should be, played on the radio.

The Swarthmore Phoenix

Thursday, April 1, 1999

Well-known actor Bruce Kuhn
came to Swarthmore last week to
present his one-man show "The Gospel of Luke." Dressed in street
clothes and without set, props or
sound effects, Kuhn built the world
of the gospel using only his body and
voice. Kuhn's script was the King
James version of Luke's gospel.
Kuhn prefaced his performance
with a story from his own career and
then slipped straight into Luke's brief
prologue. The transition from his
story to that of Luke was so smooth
and effective that the audience
seemed unaware of the transition for
two or three sentences.
Kuhn's performance was funny and often over-the-top. This sometimes served
him well—his impression of a biblethumping John the Baptist had the audience in hysterics—but overall this tactic

was unsuited for such an intimate perfor-

mance, especially since he was often no
further than a few feet away from most
of the audience.
When Kuhn did tone down his performance it was much more effective.
For example, as the story raced on
with frightening rapidity to its inevitable conclusion, Kuhn became
wilder and wilder until, at the moment of Christ's death, he dropped all
artifice and spoke trie words "and
then he gave up the ghost" with perfect calm and simplicity. The audience was enraptured.
Kuhn's control of his body was impressive, evidenced by the fact that
he portrayed physical deformity with
a simple twist of his wrist and transformed back to health just as easily.
His trained voice slipped easily from
Gabriel's exasperated tenor to Peter's
profound bass. Kuhn brought skills
gained from a career in professional
theater to his performances.

Meiklejohn's 'The Lady's Not
For Burning" works well
by Catherine Osborne
Contributing Writer
Christopher Fry, a modern playwright,
set "The Lady's Not For Burning" in the
14th century and wrote the play in iambic pentameter. Director Mary
Meiklejohn '99 transported the story to a
post-apocalyptic world where Catholicschool uniforms and vinyl boots coexist
more-or-less harmoniously.
The house of Mayor Hebble Tyson
(Wayne Miller '00) generally runs
quite smoothly under the firm hand of
his no-nonsense sister Margaret (Liz
Nickrenz '99). On this particular day,
though, her two sons (Dan Belsky 'O2
and Steve Salter 'O2) are competing
for the hand of lovely Alizon Eliot
(Laura Wolfram 'O2), who in turn has
fallen in love with the Mayor's clerk,
Richard (Sam Blair 'O2). Meanwhile,
a misguided witchhunt has brought the
accused,
Jourdemayne
Jennet
(Meiklejohn), and a discharged soldier, Thomas Mendip (Brantley Bryant
'99) into their lives.
After a long series of twists and turns
Jennet and Thomas.having fallen in love
themselves, depart to make their way in
a new world, while Alizon and Richard
do the same. Tyson's household is left to
recover from the cataclysmic force oflove
which has upset its peaceful life.

As Thomas, the man who is so disenchanted with life that he demands to be
hanged, Bryant was stunning. The
subtlety of his acting was beautiful, especially in the intimate setting of the
Friends Meeting House. Meiklejohn's
Jennet was a more than worthy partner,
moving from grief to joy to anger with
absolute conviction. As the younger pair
of lovers, Blair and Wolfram were idealistic and utterly charming. The quartet of
experienced and skilled actors completely
won over the audience.
As the nebbish Tyson, Miller was
appropriately ineffectual. Dave Urban '99 drifted around the stage as a
violin-toting chaplain. Chris Cutler
'OO, as the Justice Tappercoom, took
control of his colleagues. Nickrenz
rode the waves of her turbulent
household with seraphic calm.
Belsky and Salter were effectively
nasty and brutish. As the drunken
rag-and-bone merchant on whose
true fate the resolution of the plot
depends, Alastair Thompson '99 ran
away with his one brief scene.
Meiklejohn directed with great
delicacy, allowing the faceted beauty
of Fry's script to shine. The balance
of laughter and tears resolved into
perfect harmony in this effective production of a wise, funny, and elegant
play.

Men's Lax gains
first season wins
by Annne Frankenfield

Staff Writer

The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team improved its
record to 2-5 overall, 0-0 in
Centennial Conference, with
wins over Nichols College and
Goucher College, while suffering a loss to Scranton University. The first victory came on
Mar. 20 on home turf over
Nichols College when Mark
Dingfield 'Ol led the team to a
score of 18-6, scoring seven
goals and assisting on five others. Mike Lloyd 'Ol added four
goals and six assists, Blake
Atkins 'O2 tallied six goals and
one assist and Adam Dickinson
'OO contributed with one goal.
The 18 goals were the most
scored by Swarthmore since
1993. Goalies Sig Rydquist 'OO
and Pat Murray 'Ol played
well with five and eight saves
respectively, each in 30 minutes of play. The defensive
team of Ford O'Connell '99,
Tucker Zengerle 'OO, Nimish
Dave '99 and Charles Fischette
'Ol held Nichols to only four
shots and two goals in the first
half. In particular, Jason Choi
'O2 played well at defensive
midfield with five takeaways
and seven ground balls.
The Garnet took its second
win over Goucher College in a
close 12-11 match-up on Mar.
24. Dickinson led the team
with a career best five goals
and two assists, as he continued to improve as a solid offensive threat. Zengerle contributed defensively, holding
Goucher's leading scorer to
one goal, while Darren Wood
'Ol played his best game adding one assist and picking up
five ground balls. Other goals
were scored by Dingfield
(3g,4a), Lloyd (2g,2a) and
Atkins (2g). The extra man offensive unit was successful
scoring three goals. Rydquist
finished the game with 15
saves. Coach Pat Gress commented on the "impressive"
win over Goucher and how it
"shows the team's improvement", citing the Garnet's 131 loss to Goucherlast year in a

The Kenyon and Emory
matches took place two weeks
ago in sunny Adanta. On Saturday March 20th, the team played
against Kenyon in the last match
of its spring trip. John Thomas
'O2 and Dennis Mook 'Ol
started the match offright with
a quick win at #3 doubles, which
was followed up by senior Nick
Slimack and junior John
Temin's victory at #2. Greg
Emkey '99 and Pete Schilla 'Ol
were unable to complete the
doubles sweep, but the doubles
point was already secured.
Emkey and Schilla made up for
their doubles mistakes by scoring straight set wins at #2 and
#3, giving the Garnet a 3-0 lead.
At #1 Slimack faltered, but #6
Mook secured the victory with
a three set win. With both Temin
and Thomas leading in their
matches, play was stopped due
to time constraints.
The next day brought morning rain which forced the cancellation ofthe scheduled match
against DePauw, but the sun
came out in time to give the team
a shot at avenging last year's 43 loss to Emory. Again Thomas
and Mook led the way with a
convincing win at #3 doubles
and Emkey and Schilla picked
a good time to break out oftheir

losing streak to capture the critical doubles point. At #3 singles
Schilla gave the Garnet a 2-0
lead with a straight set win, but
Emory closed the gapwith a win
at #l. With all of the remaining
matches in third sets, either team
could have pulled out the victory. But Emkey came back
from a 6-1, 4-1, 30-0 deficit to
put the team one match away
and then Mook finished off the
Eagles by winning his final set.
Emory won thelast two matches
to make the final score 4-3, but
revenge was already secured.
When Amherst came to town
last weekend the Garnet looked
to avenge not only last year's 43 loss, but also the several excruciatingly close losses from
the last three years. The Emory
victory was a big boost, but
Slimack was forced to sit out due
to an injury and both Temin and
Mook had to play with minor
injuries. Scott Grant 'Ol stepped
into Slimack's place for the
doubles, but the whole singles
lineup had to move up. This time
Emkey and Schilla gave the momentum to the Garnet with an
8-1 win at #l. Thomas and
Mook followed with a win at #3,
giving the team a 1-0 lead going into the singles. Thomas and
Schilla both scored straight set
wins, but neither Grant nor
Temin were able to pull out their
matches. With only one more
match needed to complete the
upset, Emkey and Mook fought
for the glory of clinching the
match. Emkey won the race, but
Mook padded the score with a
7-5 win in the third set.
This Saturday the team is
looking to score another upset
when #2 Williams comes down
to play. Tennis coach Mike
Mullan is optimistic about the
team's chances. "If we continue
to play tough and get that
doubles point, we have a good
chance of winning," he comments.

The Garnet struck early
against Lebanon Valley on

the strong pitching performances of Roth and Carlo

In addition, the Garnet
played a solid defensive
game, which has not been
the case in the past.

25. Although, Swarthmore
was coming off a win, their
offense remained silent and

Women's Lacrosse prepares for tough
season, does well at seven sisters tourney
by Sari Altsculer
Staff Writer
The 1999 women's lacrosse
team has been practicing hard
and learning how to work together. With a few preliminary
scrimmages and games under
their belts, the team and
coaches are optimistic about
the rest ofthe schedule.
The team visited Virginia
and South Carolina over their
spring break road trip.
Swarthmore's first stop was at
a tournament at William and
Mary where they fared well,
playing five twenty-five
minute games against mostly
Division I schools. In South
Carolina the women spent a lot
of time relaxing after the fourhour practice sessions held
most mornings. Two scrimmages against Bucknell and

Bryn Mawr gave the team
more confidence about their
performance under pressure
and in game situations.
Women's lacrosse has had an
exciting start. In their first
game not in the south, the team
played excellently, beating the
College of Notre Dame of
Maryland 24-11. The team
again delivered a strong performance against Washington
College last week, pulling off
a 10-9 win in their first home
match up. The entire team
played well, especially Holly
Baker '99, Alicia Googins 'OO,
Sarah Singleton '99, Jen
Hagan '99, Katie Tarr 'O2 and
goalie Amy Dißenedetto 'O2.
This past weekend, the
Swarthmore women's team
participated in the Seven Sisters tournament at Bryn Mawr
College. Swarthmore domi-

nated the first game, gaining a
comfortable lead over Mount
Holyoke early on that led to a
final score of 17-3. The team
only had an hour and a half to
rest before they began warm
ups for the next game. Unfortunately, the second game of
the day was a close loss to
Haverford, ending with a score
of 12-9. Although the final
score was disappointing, the
Seven Sisters game does not
count toward the Hood trophy
and Swarthmore will have the
opportunity to take on the
Fords again at the end of the
season. In their final Seven Sisters game, Swarthmore beat
Smith College 13-9, claiming
third place overall. Three
Swarthmore team members

were named to the prestigious
All-Tournament Team, attest-

ing to the impressive caliber of
the Garnet squad.
The team hopes to use the next
few weeks to gain more experience and become more comfortable working together. A few
key players, such as Baker,
Googins, and Becca Stites 'OO,
are suffering from injuries and
will with any luck recover in
time to play at full strength for
the remainder of the season.
With a four and one record already, the Swarthmore women
are a tough match for any team
they will face this season.
The JV team, which traditionally has had a losing
record, is also off to a strong
start with wins against Chestnut Hill and Immaculata Colleges. The next varsity home
game is a conference game on
Tuesday, April 6 against
Ursinus College.

Lindsey added "the real difference between our team
this year and the one last year
is that we have so much
strength throughout the order." In addition to some pop
in the lineup, strong pitching
and solid defense like the
Garnet has displayed lately
means that they can play at a
higher, more competitive
level. "At this point," added
Farneth "it's important that
our team get in the habit of
winning."
There will be more baseball home action today as
Swarthmore faces Widener

Men's volleyball starts off Rugby has rough start

From VBALL, pg.2l
strong defense by Martin
Kraft 'Ol and Leslie
Murray 'O2 off the bench
kept Swat in the game despite a tight loss in the third
set 13-15. St. Joe's took an
early lead in the fourth set,
but co-captains Ellis and
Berger rallied the troops
and thanks to some amazing plays, including a save
by Murray which took him
right through the chairs
serving as Swat's bench,
brought Swarthmore a 1715 victory.
The next week brought
Swat men's volleyball out
to Ursinus, whose absent
blocking and weak passing
proved no match for the
consistent power of their
opponents. Imran Posner
'OO returned to his position
as middle blocker after an
absence against St. Joe's
and along with Fritz proved
a virtually unbreakable wall
at the net. Setting, passing,
blocking and serving were
all strong and Swarthmore
easily took the first two sets
15-6 and 15-3. Middle
blocker Dimo Pramatarov
'O2 and outside hitter Marc
Richards 'O2 came in and
kept Swarthmore in a third
set which proved remarkably tight but, thanks to an
amazing serving streak by
Berger, resulted in a 17-15
Swarthmore victory.
Now confident at 3-0,
Swarthmore next went out
to Philadelphia Textile
where they faced a strong
opponent and a virulently
hostile crowd. Despite
strong play when they were
in the game, including particularly strong hitting from
outside hitter Dzevad
Sukilovic '99, our volleyball men couldn't keep their
concentration and lost the
first two sets 2-15 and 7-15.
The large Textile crowd had
downloaded Swat's roster
from the web and personally harassed the visitors,
including choice comments
like "Slap the ball like it's
my ass, Derek!" which
naturally kept the team offbalance. They did manage
to regain focus in the third
game and focused setting by
Nathan along with net
domination by Ellis, Berger,
and Posner gave Swat a 153 victory, but the raucous
crowd and strong play by
Textile handed Swarthmore
it's first loss after they fell
in the fourth set 8-15.
It wasn't long until Swat
men's volleyball got the
anger from that tough loss
out of their system, though,
as the next night brought
them to the court of archrival Haverford. The 'Fords
proved incapable of handling Berger's ace serves or
the consistent hits set up by
setter Nathan and Swat
jumped to a 158 victory in
the first set. Haverford
came back 8-15 in the next
set, but cocaptains Ellis,
Berger and Posner rallied

the troops (with an assist
from the visiting Paul Hsu
'9B) and got the team to exploit their opponent's
weaknesses hitting down
the line and covering
middle hits. Swat roared
back in the next two sets with
overpowering hits by Ellis,
Posner, Sukilovic and Fritz as
well as strong back-court defense from Richards and
Murray which resulted in 1715 and 15-9 victories in set
three and four.
A 4-1 record for a Swarthmore team is impressive
pretty much in and of itself,
but men's volleyball can be
especially proud since they
have been playing without
a coach and with a number
of new players, including

three starters who weren't
on the front line last year.
Much of the credit goes to
Ellis, Berger and Posner,
who have provided leadership both in games and in
practices. Most importantly, though, the team has
proven that mental intensity
and basic skills are what
bring victories on the court.
"I'm already impressed
with the mental toughness,
team spirit, and volleyball
talent that this team possesses," commented Ellis.
Swat men's volleyball's
next two games will be at
home against Lasalle on
Thursday, April Bth at 7 PM
and The College of New
Jersey on Saturday, April
10th at 3 PM.

doubtedly its questionable
scrumming practices and
enormous, prickly, pumpkin
patch-like field had a lot to
do with the final outcome of
the game. With only 19 players for both the a and b side
games, however, the day was
surely a testament to
Swarthmore's heart and endurance.
The game got off to a bad
start when a early penalty allowed Vassar to capitalize on
a place kick, putting them up
by three. Things looked
worse when back captain/
scrum half Meghan Brennan
'OO was forced to leave the
game with a concussion.
Lucky for Swat, however,
Nancy Craig 'Ol was able to
step up as scrum half, allowing the team to maintain their

focus and their forward push.
Indeed, the first half was
played predominately in
Vassar's end of the field as
Swarthmore edged closer and
closer to the try zone. Unfortunately, the team was unable
to capitalize on its momentum before time ran out.
Vassar came out energized in
the second half, and was able
to use its speed to score two
breakaway tries. The final
score was 13-0.
Swarthmore's second sidefared
a lot better then its first, winning
the game 5-0. Again, Laura Blume
scored Swarthmoie's only try, off

make me over!

See why the winner of the third annual spiketeen/Vidal Sassoon/Lockheed Martin
Great American Makeover Contest flipped over his new look, and pick up a few
makeup and fashion tricks for yourself!
"I want to be a model," Josh said,
"but if that falls through, then I
want to be a computer systems
administrator."

When our nationwide search for spiketeen's new
"it" boy was over, we'd seen lots of pretty faces, but
only one star. And that star was Joshua Lewis, 20,
of Wilmington, Delaware.
Josh was searching for a way to spice up his look,
and he was in luck. "My usual routine is pretty bland,"
he admitted. "I'd love to try something sexy and ex-

citing!"
The hair: Josh loved David Boreanaz' spiky 'do on

Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but our spiketeen stylist,
Joe, of Joe's Barber Shop, just gave Josh his $ll
special. Joe trimmed a little off the back, top and
sides before calling it a day.
The face: Using a Wahl beard trimmer and a Gillette
Mach 111 safety razor, Josh shaved off his beard to
create a close-shaven beardless look.
The clothes: Josh wanted a buff new style which
was confident and fresh. Our spiketeen fashion experts hit the hippest outlets to concoct three cool
new looks for any occasion.
Josh's reaction: "My shaggy hair is finally under
control, and my eyes really shine through without a
beard. I see a whole new me—like the old me, but
with shorter hair and a close shave."
It's no secret, he's so fine: girls will be slipping him
their beeper numbers wherever he goes—don't be
the last girl on your block to get a piece of the action.

swinginest, naughtiest episode of Press YourLuckever.
All his buds may be hitting Eat a Pita for afterschool
laughs, but Josh is all set for a night in, sexing up a few
of his favorite bunnies from homeroom. "Call me

may never be the same.

Football specs to be

"I rocked that

In order to advance
Swarthmore College's goal of
creating a winning football
team, athletic director Robert
Williams announced today that
prospective football players
will be housed at nearby
Villanova University. According to Williams, the athletics
department will use a giftfrom
Board of Managers chairman
and NFL president Neil Austrian to pay Villanova students
to pretend their school is
Swarthmore while the specs
are there.
"This gift

head football coach
Peter
Alvanos, who has been pushing to keep football specs away
from Swarthmore since he was
hired last year.
"The lack of hard drinking
in the dorms, the paucity of
raucous parties on weekends,
and the offense-female students
take to the sexual advances of
drunken high school seniors all
make it very difficult to convince my recruits this is the
school for them."
Starting immediately, members of the Delta Xi fraternity
at Villanova will be paid to
house Swarthmore football recruits on several upcoming
weekends. The brothers will

Jared Solomon took it to the

12-year-old paraplegic in an
intense game of one-on-one
basketball, blowing out the
boy 42-3.
The paraplegic challenged Solomon to the
game after Solomon declared during a Student

the athletic ability of a
small boy with polio."
Before the game, the
paraplegic, typing with J

The paraplegic raced

kept in the fraternity house for

College President Al Bloom
praised the iniative, stating
that efforts such as bringing
football specs on weekends
and paying for their meals
privileges non-athletic specs
don't enjoy—weren't doing
enough to overcome students'
disinterest in football and jock
culture.
"This is a wonderful school,"
said Bloom, "but let's face

by Justin Kane
Capt. Crazy
A party in Olde Club last
weekend witnessed the
sexual harassment by
drunken football specs of the
final "pure" woman on campus.
The student, who chose to
remain anonymous, reported
that at approximately 12:45
a.m. an unidentified football
spec, his breath heavy with
liquor and his speech highly
slurred, clumsily approached
her.
After briefly trying to
dance with the girl, the spec,
spilling his beer on the
victim's legs, attempted to
fondle the victim. The girl
then slapped the spec before he
toppled to the ground in a

drunken stupor.
When the victim reported
the attempted assault to Dean
Bob Gross, Gross allegedly
took out a file with the names
of every female on campus,
checked off the name of the
victim and then commented,
"Yup...that's everyone."
The incident is one of over
700 that have occurred since
the unusually high number of
football recruits began visiting Swarthmore.
Upon questioning, football
coach Peter Alvanos said,
"What's wrong with copping
a feel here or there?"
Erin Clark 'O2, who was harassed earlier this year, questioned the administration's response to the incidents.
"I don'treally think that the
athletic department should be
using my breasts to try to attract football players to
Swarthmore. I mean, we are
bad, but are we that bad?"
Alvanos refused to respond
to Clark's comment.
