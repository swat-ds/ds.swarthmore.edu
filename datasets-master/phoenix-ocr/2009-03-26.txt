Three college vehicles vandalized in one week
BY JEFF DAVIDSON
jdavidsl@swarthmore.edu

Jake Mrozewski Phoenix Staff

Two windows on a Media Services golf cart were broken in a string of vandalism.

Between March 15 and March 22, three
incidents of intentional damage to collegeowned vehicles were reported to Public
Safety. The first incident, which was directed at a golf cart found destroyed in the
Crum Meadow and also involved damage
done to a van found on campus, was reported on Sunday, March 15. The two other incidents, reported during the course of the following week, were directed at another golf
cart and another van found on campus.
The most significant of the damages was
to the first golf cart found in the Crum.
According to Motor Pool Foreman Paul
Rowe, the repairs, before the suspension,
labor and cosmetics, will be $3,000. Both
doors were broken off, the windshield
wiper, mirrors and roof were broken, and
an accessory fan inside the cart was ripped
out. Half of the key to the vehicle was found
broken in the ignition.
This incident was more than just a joy
ride through the Crum, though, as the broken parts of the van were not sustained
solely from driving.
"They left golf cart doors on the rocks
and put the [side-view] mirrors on top of
[the cart] and stones on top of [the cart],"
Rowe said. "They scattered things and busted it up."
The cart, which belonged to ITS and was
used for Client Services, was deliberately
torn apart and scattered throughout the
area. According to Director of ITS Gayle
Barton, rather than incurring the expenses
of fixing the vehicle, ITS gave the cart to
facilities.
In the process of stealing the golf cart, a
headlight was broken on a facilities van.
This damage is estimated at $35.
One week later, a golf cart that Media
Services uses daily, incurred significant
damage. This time, something was thrown

through both windows of the golf cart,
which was first noticed near Beardsley at
10 p.m. on Friday, March 20. Since Media
Services, has needed the cart every day this
week, they have not yet had the chance to
take it to the shop and get a repairs estimate, Barton said.
Two days later, on Sunday, March 22, an

side window.
In an e-mail, Director of Public Safety
Owen Redgrave said, "the truck had been
parked near the Service Building for the
weekend. Nothing was reported missing
from the truck's interior."
Rowe estimates that the cost will be $2OO
to replace the broken window.
According to Chief of Police Brian Craig,
the borough police have not yet had much
involvement with the investigation.
"Officer Kline [from the borough police]
received a report of a golf cart stuck in the
mud in the College woods near the train
trestle," Craig said in an e-mail. "Before he
could respond to the call he was notified by
Swarthmore College Public Safety that they
had responded and were handling the incident. Officer Kline did not conduct an
investigation."

At this time, the Borough police are not
involved in any of the investigations and no
other vandalism to vehicles has been
reported in the Borough.
Craig said that the Borough police are
generally not involved with incidents like
these, which are usually handled by Public
Safety, although several years ago a utility
vehicle was stolen and they received a
report.
No witnesses have yet come forward
with information.
Anyone with tips should directly contact
Public Safety. Further coverage will be

Campus-wide collection responds to Iraq War
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE

arollel@swarthmore.edu

On Friday, March 20, Students for a
Democratic Society and the President's
Office hosted a Collection to mark the
passing of the sixth anniversary of the
Iraq war. At 4:00 p.m., 40 to 50 members of
the Swarthmore community, including
students, faculty and administrators,
gathered in Kohlberg Coffee Bar to reflect
on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and
the college's role in the conflicts.
According to Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l, SDS proposed the idea of a
Collection to the President's Office, which
embraced the idea. "They came to talk to
me about it because they thought, rightly,
a collection as a college event is under-utilized so we talked about how we might
make use of it to commemorate this
anniversary of the war," he said.
The Collection was run in the manner
of a Quaker meeting, in which there are
no predetermined speakers and anyone
attending can stand and speak if they are
moved to do so. While different speakers
might respond to each other's statements,
the meeting is supposed to involve sharing ideas and feelings rather than argu...

working together to achieve a common

Given the nature of the event, the number of people in attendance was an important decider of the nature of the conversation. "Had [attendance] been much larger," Eldridge said, "it might not have
drawn the [comments] it got." Reflecting
on past experiences of Quaker meetings
with hundreds of attendees, Eldridge
noted that the feel of these types of gatherings could definitely be affected by the
number of people involved.
Earlier in the college's history,
Collections happened regularly and were
mandatory for all students. When
Eldridge attended Swarthmore "you had
an assigned seat and your absence was
noted," he said.
After mandatory Collections were
abandoned in the 19605, "in the time when
life among students became less regulated," according to Eldridge, they enjoyed a
brief return to popularity in the 1990s but
have, once again, become infrequent.
Some students found that an hour and
a half of quiet reflection had value in
itself. "There is something nice about taking time out of your life to think about
something important," Judson said.

Vegetarianism builds coalitions Bryn Mawr feels
economic pinch

BY SARAH POZGAY
slong6@swarthmore.edu

In a collaborative effort to moti-

vate campus-wide consideration of

the environmental benefits of vegegroups
tarianism,
activist
Earthlust, Environmental Justice,
the Good Food Project and
Swarthmore Labor Action Project
organized a Meatout dinner in
Sharpies on Thursday, March 19. To
promote vegetarianism as a viable
option, these groups worked with
dining services to design a menu of
primarily vegetarian dishesfor one
night. As part of Earthlust's Green
March campaign, the event corresponds to a larger shift within the
Swarthmore activist community
regarding the motivations behind
choosing a vegetarian lifestyle.
"At Swarthmore, it's no longer
just a moral issue or an animal
rights issue. It's an environmental
issue, a carbon issue, it's a sustainable choice," said Co-president of
Earthlust Blaine O'Neill 'IL
Jessica Holler 10, a member of
the Good Food Project who was also
involved in the Meatout, said collaboration between the groups is a
part of promoting a broader perception of vegetarianism, especially on
the Swarthmore campus. "People
tend to view [vegetarianism] as an
independent ethical decision,"
Holler said. "I think events like this
collaborations
between
and
Earthlust, SLAP, Good Food, are
helping people realize that regardless of your reasons, these things
are part of a bigger network and
vegetarianism is [not only] an individual choice but also is a social
movement."
Co-president
of
Earthlust
Camille Rogine 'll echoed this
statement. "I would say every person on this campus is passionate
about some social issue and sustainability is really something that
connects with all those issues," she
said. "Whether you think about
corporate companies who are abusing farmers or abusing people or
really exaggerating class divisions
those are all interconnected with
...

vegetarianism."

Students involved in the
Meatout emphasized the way in
which each group's respective concerns ultimately lead back to maintaining an economic system that is
environmentally sustainable and
socially just.
According to the groups, vegetarianism is one way to do that.

"From an environmental perspective, and even in some ways from a
social justice perspective, a lot of
the steps we can take to build a criticism of the economic system in
which we live are steps that involve
opting out of that system," said
Anna Grant 'lO, the SLAP liaison
for the event.
According to Ladule Lako
LoSarah 'O9, a member of
Environmental Justice and the
chief organizer behind the Meatout,
the meat industry is a prime example of a socially unjust and economically inefficient system. "[Meat]
has become such a part of our culture that the only way we can actually produce this much meat and
have it be accessible to everybody
and have it be cheap is if we farm in
this way," he said.

THE PHOENIX

Speaking about her involvement
with the event on behalf of SLAP,
Grant said, "We really wanted to
take the approach that this is about
the way we produce and consume
and the effect it has on the environment and on human communities,
and whether we can continue to
produce and consume the way we
do." Grant also noted that though
fair labor issues are particularly
pertinent in discussions of the meat
industry, "We [SLAP] could have
done this with any industry at all."
Holler said, however, that she
feels vegetarianism at Swarthmore
is about more than just abstaining.
"Instead of just the negative, the
positive
building a community
around a different sort of relation
to food
is something a lot of people on this campus are interested
in," she said.
Connecting social issues with
vegetarianism, while particularly
motivating in a community like
Swarthmore, is part of a growing
population of vegetarians outside
the college as well. When asked
whether Swarthmore Dining
Services has noticed a trend of
ever-increasing vegetarianism on
campus, Director, of Purchasing
Janet Kassab responded that while
that may be the case, it's important
to note that this is part of a greater
"food trend" that goes beyond the
Swarthmore community.
Lako LoSarah said that he's
noticed progress over the years in
the way Dining Services caters to
the needs of vegetarians and vegans on campus. "When I was a
freshman it was not nearly as good
as it is now," Lako LoSarah said.

"They've dramatically improved,

and I think it's because a lot of students now are much more aware of
the issues involved and they've
been talking to Dining Services and
the administration."
Thursday night's Meatout was a
prime example of this growing
trend in the activism of vegetarianism. In addition to securing a
greater variety of vegetarian and
vegan options for the dinner, those
involved in organizing the Meatout
distributed information about the
ways in which adopting a vegetarian lifestyle can be an act of environmentalism. According to statistics printed on flyers, brochures
and table tents, the single most
powerful action an individual can
take to decrease his or her carbon
footprint is to avoid eating meat. A
2006 U.N. report cited in Earthlust's
campaign materials stated that the
meat industry produces more
greenhouse gases than all the
SUVs, cars, trucks, planes and
ships in the world combined.
Swarthmore's
Good
Food
Project adopted a more hands-on
method, setting up large compost
bins near the trash cans and teaching students about which parts of
their food waste (uncontaminated
vegetable parts only) could be easily composted.
Commenting on the Good Food
Project's connection to environmentalism and vegetarianism,
Toby Altaian 'lO said, "I think part
of what composting is about is
redrawing the line between waste

and resource
A lot of the arguments that tend to connect vegetarian lifestyle with environmental...

-

ism are concerned with what we
think of as a resource and how we
consider resources, how we orient
ourselves towards the things which
are resources."
At the end of the dinner, students were asked to sign "veg-

pledges" promising to go vegetarian for a certain number of days or
meals, or to simply cut back on the
quantity of meat they consume in a
given space of time. "We've had
over 100 pledges," Lako LoSarah
said, adding that there was a wide
range of pledges, with some students deciding to go vegetarian for
the following meal, others for the
following month. The organizers
emphasize that vegetarianism doesn't necessarily entail cutting out
meat entirely. "It doesn'thave to be
a strict choice either; it can be just
thinking about remediation and
cutting back on meat," said Jesse

Marshall 'll, a member of the Good
Food Project. Grant echoed this
statement. "It's not about an
either/or choice between consuming enormous amounts of meat
and never consuming meat at all
That's like saying either you
leave your house with all the
lights on or you study by candlelight," she said.
While the groups organizing
the Meatout hoped the dinner
would be entirely meat-free,
Dining Services objected to a total
Meatout for several reasons.
According to Director of Dining
McDougall,
Services
Linda
Sharpies hosted a similar event a
number of years ago that was met
with backlash from the student
body, specifically from student
athletes. "It was several years ago,
but I don't think I want to take the
chance of doing it again and having
that kind of impact,"
McDougall said.
However, Kassab said that the
decision not to exclude meat at the
dinner was based on more than
this experience. "As you respond
to the allergies and the special
needs, the dietary restrictions,
you just can't obliterate a single
group," she said. "No one would
ask me to serve all meat all day
and never serve a vegetable and
even though I appreciate [the
argument] 'lt's one day, it's one
meal,' it's their day and their
meal. We can't impose on someone
else your choices, whatever those
choices happen to be."
Zein Nakhoda 'l2, a member of
Earthlust who was involved in the
event, said, "Ultimately the most
social value is when people make
the choice themselves." Event
organizers said part of presenting
that choice effectively requires
exploring the multi-faceted nature
of its implications, which is where
collaboration between the student
groups comes in. "It's important to
stress how this event was sort of a
coalition event of these four student groups; I think that's something we're looking to do more in
really look at issues
the future
from all these angles so we can see
all the complexities of an issue,"
Lako LoSarah said.
Rogine agreed, saying, "I would
love to see more collaboration on
campus, and I think that's something Earthlust is always trying to

do."

On Tuesday, March 24, the administration of Bryn Mawr
College hosted an open forum with the community to discuss proposed budget cuts for next year. Due to the economic slump, Bryn Mawr expects that $5.5 million will need to
be shaved from next year's budget. The administration has
already made decisions about the first phase of its reductions, which totaled more than $3.8 million. Still needing to
make SL7 million in cuts, the administration is reaching out
to the entire campus in hopes of minimizing the impact
these changes will have on Bryn Mawr.
At the forum, a handout detailing proposed cost-saving
measures adding up to SL9 million was distributed to the

students. Unless the administration identifies alternative

cost-cutting methods, it is likely that most of the proposals
will be enacted for the next school year. Among the proposals are the closing of Rhodes Dining Hall, one of three dining halls serving Bryn Mawr, and reducing the stock of college computers by 200 machines.
Among the savings from the first phase of budget decisions were $148,000 to "reduce food options in student dining," and $84,809 from the President's Office budget to eliminate a position and "reduce entertainment budget," according to a budget reductions summary issued by the college
earlier this month. In addition, the college reduced faculty
and staffpositions by the equivalent of 23 full time positions,
but because most of these savings came from vacated positions that will not be refilled and reassignments, only four
employees were actually laid off.
Another $26,000 was saved by reducing "peer mentoring
& peer-led instruction programs by 50 percent." These programs, in which older students help younger students with
their schoolwork, are an important part of academics at
Bryn Mawr. "Those sessions are really helpful for students,"
Emily Allen 'l2 said. Ofall the cuts, Allen said, thereduced
budget for peer mentoring programs was the one that would

affect her the most.

As full-time staff start to worry about the possibility of
future layoffs, some students are expressing concerns about
the security of their own campus jobs. Many work at Rhodes
Dining Hall, for example. According to Jerry Berenson,
Chief Administrative Officer, the college hopes to save most
of these jobs by extending the hours of other dining halls.
According to John Griffith, Treasurer and Chief
Financial Officer of the college, Bryn Mawr lost about $l5O
million in the stock market since the recent downturn
began. The still-volatile economy makes the situation even
more difficult, according to Griffith, since no one can be
sure about any institution's financial future.
In order to make budget decisions that spread the burden
of the scale backs as lightly and evenly as possible across the
community, three "budget workshops" are to be held in
April to give students, faculty and staff the opportunity to
weigh in on the proposed cuts. According to Jane McAuliffe,
President of Bryn Mawr College, attendees of these workshops will sit down in small groups and talk about how different proposals would affect their lives.
Allen was optimistic about the effect of the workshops on
the budget. "I think it's helpful because they hear the student's voices." But, she said, she understood that the administration would have considerations the students don't
know about.
"How do you decide the basis on which to make a particular cut or decision?" asked McAuliffe. The answer, she
said, was to "protect the core mission of the college." For
McAuliffe, this mission involves "continuing to attract and
retain the best students," along with attracting and retaining the best faculty. For this reason, McAuliffe emphasized,
Bryn Mawr will not be cutting its financial aid budget next
year; in fact, it aims to increase aid spending in anticipation
of the economy's effect on students' ability to pay.
According to McAuliffe, administrators at Bryn Mawr
and Haverford colleges have begun discussing ways in
which the two schools can save money and improve student
services by collaborating more in some administrative
areas, which could include provinces as diverse as dining
services, facilities management, public safety and the student post office.
As the severity of the economic crisis became apparent
earlier this year, administrators at Bryn Mawr started to
spend an increasing amount of time preparing for the hard
but unavoidable choices to be made. "I think it's fair to say
that we've done not much else but talk budget," McAuliffe
said.

Indigenous symposium explores disappearing culture
thought it would be good as a women's

BY ASHIA TROIANO

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

Today marks the first day of a threeday symposium entitled Pa Kusra Tu
Pit'Athuun: The Sun is Shining Back at
Us, Reflecting a Better Tomorrow, which
will explore the culture of Californian
Native Americans. The Symposium focuses specifically on the roles of race, place,
culture and continuity in the lives of
California natives. A panel discussion featuring several major activist natives will
be held in the Scheuer Room tonight.
The conference is an opportunity for
the panelists to learn from each other,
particularly for the older women to teach
the younger women. "The panelists are
mixed up generationally so that younger
ones are exposed that was an important
part in making the conference," said
Crystal Richardson 'O9, member of the
Karuk Tribe and creator of the
Symposium.
Richardson designed and planned the
Symposium in an attempt to open dialogue about issues in Native American
culture. "I applied for Cooper [funds] for
an indigenous women's symposium to
create a forum through which native
issues can be spoken to," Richardson said.

Susan Burdick, one of Richardson's
teachers from the native community, has
been helping Richardson to organize the
Symposium for the past year and a half. "I

conference because we do a lot for the culture. This is a time to share that with the
students," Burdick said. Burdick, who is
Richardson's basket teacher, will also be a
speaker at a Symposium panel event entitled "Keeping the Home Fires Burning."
Her talk will focus on maintaining a
cultural identity. "All my life, that's what
I've done
shared my culture. I'm teaching the young and old how to preserve our
culture," Burdick said.
Besides Burdick, the other panelists
include L. Frank, Lyn Risling, Teresa
Wright, Verna Reece, Holly Hensher,
Lena Bommelyn and Nancy Steele. These
women represent a host of California
natives, including the Yurak, Hupa,
Shasta, Tongva and Ajachmem.
"It's a women's conference, but it is for
everyone. It's important to acknowledge
the people who are coming from this section of Earth," Richardson said. "All of the
ladies are activists working in culture
through culture. They represent different
elements of tradition, what is important
in their lives."
On Friday, there will be a Sunrise
Service beginning at 6:52 a.m. The focus
of the service will be on prayer and
preparing for the day in a culturally fitting manner.
"We have a custom of prayer so that
it's the first thing you do when you get up
before you eat and it's the last thing you

do at night. We learn from our brothers
and sisters, like the birds
in the morning, they sing, then they find worms,"
Richardson said. "It's appropriate and
necessary to have time for all of us to
reflect. There will be singing, people
speaking in language, getting into the
frame of thought for the day."
The Symposium will end on Saturday
night with a reception featuring traditional native foods. Burdick will be bringing huckleberry, swamp tea, mussels
from the coast, and frozen acorns that she
plans to cook upon her arrival. "[My basket teacher, my aunt, and myself] have
been gathering traditional foods for the
last year and a half, and we've canned it
and shipped it. It's specifically for the
enjoyment of the Swarthmore community
to end [the symposium] in a good way,"
Richardson said.
Both the Native American population and native languages are dwindling, but one ofRichardson's hopes for
the weekend is for people to recognize
that native culture is not dead. "We're
still here; we still exist. This is a celebration as much as [an event for] genocide awareness," she said.
Richardson's
vision
for
the
Symposium has been in the works since
her visit to the college for the annual Ride
the Tide event for accepted first-years.
Richardson recalls attending a panel discussion on genocide, but being disap-

pointed when the speaker only addressed
modern genocide and then went on to
make an inappropriate joke about other

cultures that had been victims of genocide. "I was shocked and appalled. This is
Swarthmore, somebody should have
something to say. I found myself waiting
and waiting and waiting," Richardson
said. "That was not out of the norm for my
Swarthmore experience; we needed an
indigenous activist."
Richardson became that activist for
Native American issues herself, speaking at classes, serving as a panelist, and
co-teaching a course with Professor of
Anthropology Steven Piker. She is currently teaching a course on Native
Anthropology
California
the
in
Department.

Richardson has also taken it upon herself to learn the Karuk language of her
people. Like Burdick, she is preserving
her culture in a time when many languages are becoming extinct. "There are

7,000 spoken languages, the vast majority
of which are disappearing [we are] losing language, losing culture," Theodore
...

Fernald,

Associate

Professor

of

Linguistics, said. "In many ways, we don't
even know what we're losing."
"I hope my being here was not in vain,
that all of our histories count. We're bombarded with English even though we're
on native soil, and little of our languages
are out there," Richardson said.

Auction raises $2,000 for education in Ecuador
BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu

tunity to bid on tangible goods, but also to bid on the talents of students and faculty.

With just a few Christmas lights and a red carpet, the
Village Education Project transformed the Alice Paul
lounge into the site of the first annual "Black Tie" charity
auction last Friday. According to VEP's Executive
Director Katherine Lam 'll, the live auction of student talents, the silent auction of more traditional items and the
donations collected that evening raised just over $2,000.
The VEP, founded by Katie Chamblee 'O7 during her
time at Swarthmore, is a student organization dedicated to
raising money to fund the secondary education of students
in six ofEcuador's rural villages. As the auction's program
reminded attendees, it only takes $2OO to provide a child
with the supplies, uniform and materials necessary to
complete a year of education.
To host the auction, the VEP used money from the
Student Affairs Committee in order to purchase decorations and appetizers, but relied primarily on the community's donations of time, talent and items for auction. "All
of the money was profit, which is really great," said
Director of Development Kendal Rinko 'O9, referring to the
money raised at the auction. "It was nice to see our whole
group come together," she said. "We worked on an event
that wasn't just planning for Ecuador, but bringing something that we really care about to the campus."
This year, the organization decided to try something
new in addition to their usual methods of fundraising.
Inspired by an episode of "The Office" in which a hug is
auctioned off for roughly $l,OOO, Co-Director of
Development Amber Wantman 'lO suggested that VEP host
an auction that not only provided people with the oppor-

unique idea and its ability to draw students to the event.
And their thoughts were right as over a hundred people
attended the auction for various reasons. "We're here to
support friends that are in the auction," Ivana Ng 'l2 said.

Part of the reason that the bids reached such high
value is that tight-budgeted students weren't the only ones
making bids. Assistant Director of Student Life Kelly
Wilcox, Registrar Martin Warner and Associate Professor
of Spanish Luciano Martinez, among others, made an

Other members of the group saw the value of this

appearance.

"It was really nice to see students supporting faculty
and staff and faculty and staff supporting students outside
the classroom," Rinko said.
Rinko, Wantman and Lam hope that the auction
becomes an annual event. "We came here with the purpose
of having an auction to raise money," Lam said. "But to
know that this is something that could happen for years

Hosts Wantman and Rinko introduced each "item" with
an elaborately humorous biography. Then, the individuals
strutted down the red carpet, sometimes demonstrating
their talent in an exaggerated way. To remind attendees of
the cause they came out to support, a video of past volunteers and their work played in the background during the
entire event.
Some of the talents included a "sensual serenade" from
G Patrick 'lO, a member of the dance group Rhythm-NMotion and the a cappella group Sixteen Feet, a homecooked southern dinner for three from Assistant Dean for
Residential Life Rachel Head and a massage from Hoa
Pham 10.
"[They] convinced me to do it for a good cause. And the
cause is plenty worth the embarrassment," Pham said,
explaining her decision to donate her talents to VEP.
Pham's massage went for $45.
The most expensive live auction was the dinner offered
by Rachel Head. After starting the bid at just five dollars,
it quickly rose to $llO. "I'm looking forward to dinner. I'm
from the south so it's dear to me," winner Greg Patton 'lO
said. Other expensive and popular items included a piece
of original artwork by Professor of Studio Art Randy Exon
that sold for $250 and a several-person filet mignon dinner
provided by Executive Chef of Catering Lisa Scolaro for

and years is really cool."
Each summer, the project sends volunteers from col-

leges and universities across the nation to villages outside
of Otavalo, Ecuador to teach students preparing for secondary school. The volunteers execute student-written
curriculums in both math and English. Children who
maintain high enough grades in both portions of this summer school receive sponsorship from VEP to attend secondary school.
In past years, funding for these scholarships has come

from volunteer fees and grants. While VEP also receives
money from other sources, such as Project Pericles, a nonprofit that uses their funds to promote social justice initiatives on college campuses, these funds do not support

student scholarships.

Abortion lecture presents conservative viewpoint
BY MARTHA MARRAZZA
mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu
Christopher
Associate
Professor
Tollefsen from the University of South
Carolina spoke to a crowd of about 35 students, seminarians and others on Monday
night about his philosophical argument
against abortion. Tollefsen presented a
five-pronged argument in a question-andanswer format to explain his pro-life position.
Members of Swarthmore Students
Supporting Life (SSSL) wanted to bring a
speaker to campus, and they selected
Tollefsen for his knowledge and approach
to the topic of abortion. Student organizers
Laura Wolk 'O9 and Christopher Green 'O9
agreed that bringing a speaker who could
discuss the philosophy and ethics of abortion would be most relevant for the
Swarthmore community. Besides teaching
philosophy and specializing in practical
ethics, Tollefsen is the co-author of

"Embryo: A Defense of Human Life" with

Robert George '77.
"We had heard that the co-author of his
book was a Swat alum, and we contacted
both of them after reading some of their
materials. We asked if they would be willing to come, and he [Tollefsen] agreed,"
Green said. "We discussed it a bit, and
what we were looking for was a philosophical argument on abortion. We decided that
for Swarthmore, the philosophy behind the
argument is what would be most interesting and appropriate for the community."
Wolk said Tollefsen's talk and the following question-and-answer session fostered productive and courteous dialogue.
"I was really pleased with the kinds of
questions that were asked, and I was
pleased with the general atmosphere of
respect and calm and thoughtful discussion," she said. "I think that going with the
philosophical approach was such a good
idea. People are so used to hearing this
argument couched in scientific or religious
terms, and this really provided a forum
that didn't exclude anybody."
Tollefsen began his talk by praising an

THE PHOENIX

institution like Swarthmore for hosting
him. "It's an important measure of institutional vitality to have talks like this, where
some pleasant and good-spirited disagreement can be expected," he said.
Before launching into his arguments,
Tollefsen framed the discussion in philosophical terms and explained his reasons
for doing so. "Philosophy works by way of
reasoned argument, using the premises
available for natural reason. Abortion is a

controversial issue on which there are
great stakes. People feel strongly about
abortion and feelings run high," Tollefsen
said. "It's important that a love of truth, a
willingness to inquire freely, trumps other
things when we want to talk about particularly vexing questions. We want to have
love of truth guiding the considerations
that we bring to table."
Tollefsen structured his talk around
five major questions, ranging from the
essence of personhood to the role of the
state in the abortion debate. He argued that
life starts at the point of conception, and
that the fetus is biologically continuous
with the human organism that it becomes.
He also said that all living humans
deserve fundamental moral respect and
explained the consequences of that claim.
"There are various forms of respect for various sorts of statuses or achievements.
When we talk about fundamental moral
respect, it's the sort of moral respect that
shouldn't go hand and hand with status,
but with what we are essentially,"
Tollefsen said. "If you ask which humans
deserve fundamental moral respect, the
answer is all of them, in virtue of being a
human being."
After speaking for about 50 minutes,
Tollefsen opened the discussion up to the
audience. Ariel Horowitz 'lO posed the first
few questions to Tollefsen, including one
inquiry about how long Tollefsen thought
women should be imprisoned for having
an abortion. Tollefsen argued for phasing
out abortion in a way that did not criminalize those involved. "I don't think we
should end abortion by making it a criminal offense, I think we should be legislating

it out of existence in other ways," he said.
"We could make it virtually impossible to
operate as a doctor. We could introduce not
criminal but other types of penalties in a
way that would make abortion not socially

possible."
Following an exchange about the value

of human life, Jen Medeiros 'll asked
Tollefsen if there is a circumstance under
which one can justify war.
"Human life is the basic good for human
beings, without which we can't have other
aspects of our well-being. We can't say that
we won't do anything that won't have negative effects on human life. We have to
specify our moral obligation," he said. "My
principal is no intentional killing. Only a

defensive war is permissible. It's reason-'
able and permissible to use force in
responding to an attacker, but that doesn't
mean it's reasonable to say 'l'm going to
kill this person.'"
Kristin Caspar 'O9 said Tollefsen's talk
served an important purpose, noting that
"Especially in liberal arts colleges, I think
we need more conservative voices to challenge the beliefs that many of us hold."
"I am pro-choice, but I am interested in
hearing what the other side has to say to
test my own bias, my own belief and my
own knowledge," Caspar said. "Because if
you don't do that, your 'open-minded' view
becomes close-minded, and it defeats the
purpose."

Shift in religious tolerance generates greater accord
BY DANTE FUOCO, AMELIA POSSANZA
dfuocol@swarthmore.edu, apossanl@sw-

arthmore.edu

Religion professor Mark Wallace
remembers a time when students on campus closeted their beliefs, keeping their
religious views hidden from their peers.
"Sometimes students would talk about
'coming out' as religious," he said.
Now, however, he thinks that has
changed.

WaUace, who has been at the college for
20 years, is just one of several members of
the Swarthmore community who believes
that the religious landscape is changing.
Though religion has in the past seemed
to clash with the college's liberal and intellectual atmosphere, some say that spiritual
life is actually flourishing and expanding,
aligning itself with other central college
values. Traditional religious labels, however, do not easily define this spirituality,

because it is individualized and multiva-

lent.
"In the five years I've been here it's

changed a

10t... there's been an increase in

interest in spirituality beyond what many
people think of as traditional religion,"
said Joyce Tompkins, Religious Advisor
and Interfaith Coordinator. "Their religious life has oozed out of the confines that
have been put upon it."
Sara Pearlstein-Levy 'IL for example,
calls herself a secular Jew. While at home
with her family she observes Jewish traditions, but their practices do not focus on

their religious origins.
"I guess it's nice to be part of the Jewish
community," she said. "I find it to be a nice
way to have that family time."
But Pearlstein-Levy stressed that she
does not link these positive aspects of her
cultural heritage to a god. "I just don't really buy it," she said. "I can buy that it's a

part of other people's philosophy sort of.
But it's not a part of my own."
Pearlstein-Levy added that she struggles to find labels to identify what she
believes. "For me there's more of an
absence of religion than a presence of atheism," she said.
The Interfaith Center where Tompkins
works tries to facilitate dialogue among
students like Pearlstein-Levy who find
themselves in religious gray and non-traditional areas. "I think there's a lot of people
questioning where they belong," said Jane
Lief Abell 'IL one of this year's two
Interfaith Interns.
Part of their job is to plan Religion and
Spirituality Week in early February. This
year, interns Abell and Dina Emam 'll
hosted a "speak out" session to provide a
safe environment for students to voice
beliefs that do not fit into traditional religious conversations. In the same vein, the
Interfaith Center may host coffeehouse sessions in the future for students to discuss
nontraditionalreligious experiences.
Abell added, "What goes on in terms of
religious life on campus is really divided
into each individual faith
The Interfaith
Center instituted these interns to bridge
these gaps."
Tompkins said that faith groups on campus have grown. Currently in her fifth year
here, she said that she's seen the school go
from having five religious groups to having 12, showing that while an interest in
lesser-known spirituality is increasing, so
is interest in traditional religions. Newly
founded religious groups have formed
around religions such as Hinduism, Islam,
Judaism and Unitarian Universalism.
For those who practice traditional religion on campus, a Scriptural Reasoning
group was created this fall. By discussing
...

8

interpretations of the Bible, the New
Testament and the Qur'an, the group aims
to foster interfaith dialogue in a nonsectarian way.

The Interfaith Center has been receiv-

ing increased funds from the administration, demonstrating the college's support,
Tompkins said.
"But it's more than just the money," she
said. "Whereas at the beginning I felt like

we were kind of tolerated
now the
administration really does see that supporting student spiritual life is good for
students and good for the college."
Tompkins said that Dean of Students
Jim Larimore has "called on [her] a number of times when things have come up on
campus." For example, when Matthew
Baldwin 'lO was declared missing a few
weeks ago, Tompkins said that Larimore
contacted her.
"He didn't tell me, 'Oh, do this, do that.'
He just wanted me to know about it," she
said. "A couple years ago that never would
...

have happened."

With interest from the student body and
from
the administration,
Tompkins said she has high hopes for the
future.
"What we're finding is that there are
ways to support religious life that are
intrinsically
connected
with
the
Swarthmore vision, which is about diversity, it's about ethical intelligence, it's
about values, it's about service to the comsupport

munity," she said.
With his 20 years at the college, WaUace
also has recently noted concrete changes

on campus that he feels never could have
happened earlier in his time here.
Wallace added that the college's
appointment of Rebecca Chopp, who has a
M. Div. from St. Paul School of Theology, as
president is also important. Wallace
stressed that though Chopp obviously will
not be acting as a theologian when she
takes office, "the fact that it's part of her
identity indicates to me that the climate
regarding religious faith and religious
identity has changed I don't know if [her
appointment] would have happened 20, 30,
...

40 years ago."

While Wallace noted that certain things
are getting better, he also said some students still experience problems. "At
Swarthmore in particular I have found
indifference and even sometimes a bit of
hostility [towards] students who are doing
well here but are also coming from a faith
tradition," he said.
Visiting assistant professor of religion
Elliot Ratzman said that, from his experience teaching at both Vassar and
Swarthmore College, he believes students
in elite Northeastern liberal arts colleges
often write offreligion.
"The problem I have with teaching students at Vassar and Swarthmore is that I
often find a demeaning attitude toward
people with religion," he said. "My conscious bias is that I assume that I'm teaching students with liberal sensibilities, and
I want to show the conservative position in
the best light."
Wallace agreed. "Many students and
many faculty feel that religion and intellectuallife can't come together," he said.
"That that's an oxymoron."
Wallace uses the analogy of potentially
having a Marxist student in class to
describe how he thinks strong personal
beliefs can still exist in an academic setting. He said that he aims to foster a conversation within the classroom without
forcing students to reshape their convictions.
"I want that student to bring that
Marxist passion to the classroom, but I also
...

want her to be open-minded to counterpoints to Marx," he said. "I'm not trying to
disabuse her ofher Marxist conviction. I'm
trying to open her up to [a] wider conversation. That's my attitude toward students."

Wallace added that he's had students
whose religious backgrounds ranged from
traditionally religious to non-existent.
Religion major Virginia Tice 'O9 did not
come from a religious background when
she arrived at Swarthmore. Tice admitted
that, before taking any religion classes, she
grew up thinking "people of faith are scary,
mindless and copping out."
But Tice began to rethink her personal
religious beliefs after taking Wallace's
"New Testament and Early Christianity"
and associate religion professor Ellen
Ross's "Jesus in History, Literature and
Theology."
"[Ross' class] was a mind-blowingly
awesome class that completely changed the
despite the fact that it
course of my life
was meant to deconstruct any sort of
notion about Jesus," she said.
...

Tice now describes herself as a nondenominational Christian, a transformation
whose impetus she attributes to her experiences at school. She also served as an
Interfaith Intern.
"Swarthmore has been really good at
facilitating a thoughtful spiritual life," Tice
said. "One thing that I really appreciate
about the religion department is that they
recognize what we're studying is personally relevant to people. And so even though it
they
is definitely an academic class
leave space
for some personal reflection."
Sara Forster 'll, a recently declared religion major, also came to the religion
department without prior exposure to religious texts. Although she shares this with
Tice, Forster said that she still holds her
original non-belief viewpoint.
"I still give my family presents on
Christmas, but not much has changed,"
she said regarding how she responds to
religion, alluding to her identity as a cultural Christian.
Despite her non-belief, Forster said that
she enjoys having students like Tice in the
classroom
students who, as Wallace said
in his analogy, bring some personal conviction or passion to the discussion.
"It's always good to have that voice
because if you didn't you could lose some
perspective," she said.
Last spring Ratzman decided that he
wanted to create dialogue about atheism
and religion through a class called
"Atheism in Theory and Practice." He said
that his efforts were motivated by what he
saw as the resurgence of a "scientistic"
atheism, which haughtily "flattens what
it means to be religious or non-practicing."
While seeing this first on a national
scale with the emergence of writers like
Richard Dawkins, Ratzman also saw this
on campus a few years ago in a letter to
The Phoenix. The student author discredited the study and practice of religion, questioning the necessity of the religion depart...

...

ment.

Ratzman aimed in his class to show that
there are a variety of complex and rich
ways to be critical of religion and still be
engaged or disengaged with it.
"I know for sure that there are a number of people
who think what we do in
the religion department is [preach] a sermon," Ratzman said. "I wanted to respond
to that attitude."
Ratzman's students studied thinkers
like Thomas Paine and leaders of the
women's movement to show that there is a
"rich history of [religious] critique" that

March 26, 2009

...

can be healthy and socially progressive.
Nick Gabinet 11, who came into
Ratzman's class as an atheist, said that he
gained a new perspective on religion and
atheism.
"It helped me develop a context with
which I could look at modern atheism and
modern existential practice and sort of see
what its failures were and see what its
how belief and
strengths were and see
non-belief had interacted with each other,"
he said. "It made me think a lot more critiand I mean that in a sort of hostile
cally
way
at modern atheism."
And though this critical approach hasn't caused Gabinet to turn away from his
own atheism, he thinks that Ratzman's
class made him more informed.
"I don't think that I can stand by a lot of
the criticism [of religion] that I once
voiced," Gabinet said. "[The class] made
me a lot more tolerant of people who have
religious beliefs."
Part of what's wrong with current atheism is that it fails to realize religion is
more than just "bad ideas," said Ratzman.
"Religion is not about 'bad ideas' rattling
around in people's head," he said.
"Religion is about culture, institutions,
social life, practices."
For Emilia Thurber 'll, a Unitarian
Universalist, religion shapes social interaction. Though she doesn't have an active
religious life on campus, she tries to follow
her church's seven broad principles that
guide human interaction. "I feel that I can
still adhere to what I believe without going
to church," Thurber said.
Ratzman echoed Wallace and Tice in
saying that though the religion department
doesn't promote any type of religion or
belief, it always encourages students to
realize their relevance.
"What we do here in a religion department is study all these phenomena, commonsense or nonsense," he said. "But we
don't assume what we're studying is nonsense. We know what we're studying is
crucial for the life of most people on the
...

planet."
Tompkins and Ratzman both said, in
fact, that religious literacy can help lead to
positive social change.
"If you're going to deal with politics,
economics, or world food problems
religion is a component of that," she said.
...

For Wallace, this connection is actually
part of his life and work with the environmental movement. He believes that bringing religious convictions to this global
problem can cause positive change.
"I saw that the environmental crisis
wasn't being addressed in a manner that
was sustainable," he said. "Mass movements for social change often have been
headed by religious prophets. The environmental movement needs prophets."
He cited abolitionism, the civil rights
movement and the suffragist cause as
examples of how religion "can be a liberating, transformative movement for personal change."
He called this

an expression of
"healthy religion" because it is informed
by "love commandments." Religion
becomes "unhealthy" and perpetuates vio-

lence when it moves away from these

tenets.

Frear features a modern retelling of 'Pericles'
BY MAKI SOMOSOT
msomosol@swarthmore.eclu

With a motley crew of pirates, prostitutes, morally questionable royal figures, high priestesses, incestuous
fathers and evil stepmothers all speaking in high-handed Shakespearan dialogue, "Pericles, Prince of Tyre" is a
melodramatic and extravagant quest
through the ancient cities and islands
of a long-lost Mediterranean. A modern

retelling of what is arguably one of
Shakespeare's most ambitious and
expansive
plays,
the
Theater
Department's production of "Pericles"

descends upon the Frear Ensemble
Theatre this weekend.
The play opens in the court of King
Antiochus (Nat S'ufrin '11), who has
offered the hand of his daughter in marriage to anyone who can solve a mysterious riddle; anyone who fails, however, risks immediate de'ath. The young

Ensemble's "Pericles, Prince of Tyre."

prince of Tyre, Pericles (Greg Patton
10) solves the riddle and inadvertently
discovers that Antiochus is engaged in
an incestuous relationship with his
daughter. Pericles cannot reveal this
truth to the royal court; he flees the city
to embark on a grand voyage across the
Mediterranean and endeavors to reconnect with his wife Thaisa (Allison
Morantis, Bryn Mawr '11) and his
daughter (Emily Letts, Haverford '11).
"In typical Shakespearean fashion,
the plot is pretty convoluted," assistant
stage manager Julia Cooper 'l2 said. "I
think [our retelling of Pericles] is more
about exploring the different characters and personas of the Mediterranean
cities and locations in the play. It's
meant to be a rich visual experience."

Aside from the contemporary costume design, the most markedly modern characteristic of this Pericles
retelling is that the setting acts as a
simple framing device. This is not a
visually complex set piece with lots of
detail, but rather a more experimental
black box space in which the performance can unfold naturally. "[The setting] is quite makeshift, giving the
impression that people are just coming
into this open space to tell a story,"
stage manager Harry Apostoleris 'l2
said. "It's sort of like guerrilla theatre,
when actors just show up on the set and
put on a show." The Frear Ensemble
Theatre was chosen for the production
because it is small and intimate, which
helps the audience feel more connected
to the actors and to the overall performance.
The choice to perform with minimal
set design provides an interesting contrast to the sprawling Mediterranean
setting where "Pericles" supposedly

takes place. But, if anything, the set's
sparseness is a testament to the artistic
ability and flexibility of the actors.
"[The actors] physically create the idea
of these different locations
a shipwreck
in the middle of the
Mediterranean, and all the ancient
cities of Tyre, Tarsus, Pentapolis,
Ephesus, Antioch and
Mytilene,"
Cooper said. Even at the production's
first tech rehearsal of the show, dancers
Chloe Noonan 'lO, Sara Bricault 'll, Jen
Crick 'll and Erica Evans 'll were able
to effortlessly summon an atmosphere
of playfulness and frivolity through an
elaborate and somewhat provocative
dance scene at a royal banquet hall,
evoking the spirit of the city of

Pentapolis.

Eva Amesse 'll, who plays the role of
the Marshall, provided a good deal of
the expressive choreography for this
particular scene. "Basically, I announce
the arrival of the knights who are vying
for Thaisa's affections and ensure that
all of the guests are having a good time
by providing the wine and the dance
moves," Amesse said.
"Pericles" is directed by guest artist
Eleanor Holdridge with Christopher
Compton 'O9. It features original music
by Christopher Colucci. Set and costume design is by Laila Swanson and
sound design is by Louis Jargow 'lO.
"Pericles" is the honors lighting design
project of Kim Comer 'O9.

Learning for Life event unites staff and students
BY MICHAEL GLUCK
mglukl@swarthmore.edu

On Monday, March 23, the
campus group Learning for

Life held its annual Take Your

Work
Day.
Partner
Operating under a belief in the
power of shared experiences,
the event sought to "promote
mutual respect and understanding for all members of the
campus community," said one
of the organizers of the event,
Roseanna Sommers 'lO, by
partnering
students with
night-shift members of the
Facilities staff for a midnight
through 1:30 a.m. cleaning of
Parrish.
Learning for Life -is an
organization that pairs students with staff members from
EVS, Dining Services and
Facilities to "work together on
learning projects of their own
design," Sommers 'lO said. The
projects "reflect their interests
and expertise, and often result
in lasting friendships," she
said. This year, unlike in previous years, the event was
open to the entire campus.

met in the Parrish basement
supply rooms at midnight.
They split into groups desig-

nated with the tasks of cleaning the stairwells, offices, hallways and the ever-glamorous
bathrooms. Each of these tasks
is usually tackled by one staff
member.
The organizers of the event
were pleased with the proceedings. "I was very happy with
how last night's event went,"
Sommers said. "The best part
of the night for me was when
we were all hanging out in the
staff lunch room after finishing up Parrish 2nd, and Don
[Bankston, the night shift
leader] started sharing some
stories from his many years of
work here. He told us about
some of the uproarious pranks
students used to pull, and different crazy things he would
find when he came in to work."
Bankston, who was in
charge of planning Take Your

Poor communication between
staff, administration and the
student body abounds in higher education today, and the
recent and widespread staff

striking examples. Take Your

seem to be valuable initiatives
which engender bonds between
staff and students that allow
each to empathize with and

Undoubtedly, the formation of
such personal bonds left students and staff alike a thousand fold recompensed for
their hour and a half of labor.

Bromantic comedy On the culture of grinding
ihanl@swarthmore. edu

For those of us who watch
"Scrubs," the term "bromance" is a
very familiar one. For everyone
else, a "bromance" can be best
described as the close relationship
between two straight males. In
"Scrubs," the relationship between
J.D. (Zach Braff) and Turk (Donald
Faison) is a friendship that veers
humorously towards homoeroticism: these two "brothers" know
more about each other than anybody else could ever hope to. The
idea of the "bromance" has permeated pop culture in recent years
and has culminated in a new film
hailing from the Judd Apatow
school of comedy, the Jon
Hamburg-directed "I Love You,
Man." The film follows a newly
engaged real estate agent, Peter
Klaven (Paul Rudd), who has no
male friend to serve as his best
man and is forced to seek out a
best-man worthy bro.
The humor centers on the way
that Peter's search for a best man is
reminiscent of both the straight
and gay dating scene. His search
for a friend is only several shades
away from dating, as he looks to
his family and online friend-finder
sites to find a male friend. The
nervousness and uncertainty with
which Peter approaches each outing with a new potential friend is
reminiscent of that which accompanies a first date, and when he
finally meets Sydney Fife (Jason
Segel), the two become best friends
by going on a series of "man dates."
The execution of the premise is
impressive, which is largely due to
the writing. The humor of the
movie comes off very subtly; the
jokes are not imposed on the audience like they would be in a Will
Ferrell movie. Rather, the film
charms with funny and engaging
dialogue. A running gag in which
Peter can't quite get the idea of
nicknaming down is a good example of unimposing humor. Every
time the two best friends hang out,
Peter awkwardly tries to give
Sydney nicknames that fail in
entertaining ways, such as by calling him lame names such as Jobin.
The film also manages to make
both barf and farting seem genuinely humorous as opposed to vulgar, a feat of good comedy writing.

12

The film's dialogue is instantly
well written. The
moments in which Peter talks
abouthis relationship with Sydney
are humorously similar to how
guys would talk about a girlfriend.
For example, when Sydney calls
him back for the first time, Peter is
jubilant, dropping everything that
he is doing only to suffer an attack
of nerves when he answers the
phone. After getting his first "man
date," he celebrates with his fiance,
Zooey (Rashida Jones) and her girlfriends. The timing of the jokes is
also flawless. In the same scene
Hailey (Sarah Burns), one of
Zooey's friends, mentions with a
smirk that not only is she still single, but she's the only one in the
room who can't get a man.
Paul Rudd gives a brilliant performance. Peter really comes to life
in the movie, leaving the audience
sympathetic to his plight and character. This sympathy goes a long
way, carrying the jokes and making Peter a relatable human being.
The jokes work because they are
backed with solid acting. It is easy
to fall in love with these characters
and understand the jokes through
their flaws. In one scene,' Sydney
refuses to pick up his dog's poop
and then goes ballistic in order to
scare off a guy who complains
about it. In another scene, Sydney
teaches Peter the value of letting
base emotions take over with the
line, "Society tells us we're civilized but the truth is we are animals. Sometimes we just have to let
it out. Try it." When Peter responds
with a pathetic effort, Sydney
replies "Good. Now gently remove
your tampon and try again." This
sarcastic humor is typical of
Sydney's character and nicely executed by Segel, who makes the
scene a laugh-out-loud moment.
"I Love You, Man" has the
charm of both a classic romantic
comedy and buddy movie. It is yet
another example of the growing
prevalence of "bromance" in pop
culture, perhaps as a response to a
world where platonic relationships
are slowly taking the back seat. In
a world where many are insecure
about finding a soul mate, movies
and TV shows about "bromance"
remind us that there is a great
value to just hanging out with a
good friend who will always be
there for you.

On Tuesday, March 24, famous Chinese novelist Yu Hua (right) came to
Swarthmore to discuss his latest novel "Brothers." Yu is a dentist-turned-novelist,
who rose to fame when Zhang Yimou's film adaptation of his 1992 novel "To Live"
was banned, piquing interest in the book. Yu is currently on a book tour in the U.S.,
of which Swarthmore is one of the stops, promoting the new English translation of
his 2005 "Brothers." The event, held in the McCabe Reading Room, included a
reading of an excerpt of "Brothers" by Alexandria Grant 'O9 and Fletcher Coleman
'O9, satirizing a village's newfound obsession with secondhand Japanese suits.
Afterwards, Yu, translated by Aly Xiang 'lO (left), discussed writing the novel. Chris
Green 'O9 said, "He was a really funny guy. He told a lot of stories about [the reactions] of other people [to the book]." Yu addressed some mild controversy that his
book stirred, commenting that the Chinese government has so many people saying things in support of them that they can afford to have a few people like him.
Yu also added that his comedy of a society run amok applies to human behavior
anywhere in the world and not just to China.

Secrets of an upset Resisting urges for schism
In 2006, while Democrats were scoring
major victories across the country, Virgil

Goode coasted to a sixth term as congressman for Virginia's Fifth district
my home. In 2008, Goode looked poised
for another landslide: an August poll put
him ahead by 34 percent. In November,
Goode was defeated by 35-year-old Tom
Perriello by a margin of 727 votes. It's
been called the biggest congressional
upset of the year, and many pundits have
had trouble figuring out how it happened
giving answers that are oversimpliJesse Gottschalk

I think were extremely important that pose lessons for other
Tip #1: The campaign should be an extension of the candidate; the
candidate's ideals should be embodied in all elements of the campaign.
Perriello's message centered on hard work and a commitment to
service. Rather than leave this message as a set of talking points, as
many campaigns do, Perriello built his campaign around it. He recruited a team including numerous non-profit veterans and college students
from around the district.
The campaign opened an unprecedented number of offices across
even in towns which hadn't had a Democratic office in
the district
it spreads employees and
decades. Adding offices can be tough
resources thin or demands more of them but it fit into the message
of putting in the extra work and engaging with the community.
Finally, Perriello started a program he called the "VolunteerTithing
Initiative." Campaign volunteers were asked to devote ten percent of
their "volunteer hours" to local community service organizations
domestic violence shelters, food banks, Habitat for Humanity, etc.
It was brilliant. It got publicity for the campaign, but it did much
more. It embodiedPerriello's commitment to community service. It put
Perriello in contact with local leaders working to address some of the
district's most important needs something that will hopefully allow
him to better serve their causes from Washington. And let's not forget
well over 1000 hours of community service.

direct impact aside from that one day in November, and help society no
matter who won. You may say I'm a dreamer...
Tip # 2: Hire the right consultants, then be prepared to ignore them.
In the multimillion-dollar elections industry, hiring strong consultants, for better or for worse', is part of the game. They provide access to
technology, informationand vendors which otherwise would prove too
costly. They can provide invaluable expertise and experience. They
have an interest in their candidate winning, and their values may align
with the candidate's.
At the same time, consultants do not have the monopoly on good
advice, and a strong campaign must be willing to ignore them. There
are plenty of reasons to be wary of the advice ofconsultants. They have
less local knowledge than the inhabitants of the district, and attempts
to implement "one size fits all" solutions may ignore key constituent
ability
groups or district needs. Profit motives may interfere with their
to put the candidate's interests first. Sometimes this can get extreme
most notoriously the case of BMW Direct, which once gave a candidate
only $30,000 out of $700,000 raised on his behalf.
Back to Perriello. He wanted to start a program where he would
recruit college-aged people from around the district to open and manage regional offices and become the local faces of the campaign.
Consultants warned him this was a bad move: the money would be better spent on advertising, and experienced professionals would make
better ambassadors than college kids.
Still, the objections quieted when Perriello stood by the program.
They disappeared completely when the Obama campaign announced a
similar program of its own. After the election, Perriello called the program one of the most valuable of his campaign.

I'm not saying candidates should go without consultants
would be disastrous. But in this case, Perriello saw an important opportunity. The program put him in closer touch with the district, and
helped him deal with the diverse and sprawling nature of the district by
having representatives in communities throughout. Recalling my first
tip, Perriello also saw this as a chance to have the campaign embody his
message about young people devoting themselves to their communities.
There are many reasons Perriello won in the Fifth district. Neither
of the points above really upends conventional wisdom but hopefully they shift it just a little. The first is about having a more representative campaign; the second is about being more responsive to the needs
of your district. I know no one who would oppose these goals.

Two weeks ago,
the New York
Times ran an article about a nascent California
separatist movement. Apparently,

break away from
the more liberal
coastal areas in
Will Glovinksy
order to free farmThe Commotion
ers from animal
rights ballot initiatives that originate in less agrarian places like San Francisco
and Los Angeles. The story sounds like a lost collaboration between George Orwell and John
Steinbeck.
But it is real. And though the movement is far
from gaining much political traction, the cultural rifts that have impelled this group of rural
dwellers to push for "downsizing" California are
serious ones that deserve immediate attention.
The main concern of Citizens for Saving
California Farming Industries, the organization
that has launched the campaign, is the imposition of agricultural regulations and taxes popular among liberal city dwellers but abhorred by
many farmers and agricultural industry workers. For the group, the most recent outrage was
the passage of the Standards for Confining
Animals initiative, which mandated minimum
pen requirements for egg-laying hens, veal
calves and pregnant pigs.
According to the group's website, however,
such animal cruelty measures only scratch the
surface of the problem. In a litany of complaints,
the group's website deplores the "radicals" who
are "sympathetic to illegals and criminals" and
the "expenditures on non-citizens, employment
displacement and generational welfare rolls
[that] are leaving a massive, ongoing debt to our
children, grandchildren and their children's
children."
Thus, it becomes clear that the controversy is
bigger even than gratuitously large sow pens.
The underlying preoccupation is a libertarian
impulse that has been aggravated by California's
liberal-leaning majority. At face value, the proposed solution seems reasonable because it

r

allows for better representation of citizens who
wish to limit government's reach into the private realm. Nor is this sort of thing unprecedented in America; West Virginia, Maine and
Kentucky all exist because they seceded from

But the knee-jerk reaction to separate yourself from those with whom you disagree is troubling. Self-determination is guaranteed in the
United States, but democratic government
requires self-determination on a collective level.
There are many good reasons to avoid the
decomposition of states into city-states and

Despite what Obama says, there are a de facto
red America and blue America. The color coding, however, has less to do with election night
maps than the basic differences in values, conventions and attitudes toward government that
cleave America into urban/suburban/rural
modes of thinking. And the fact that we have to
coexist isn't such a curse.
As an example, let's return to the farming
issue. State governments that have representatives from farming communities and non-farming communities benefit from the many viewpoints that must be considered when determining agricultural policy and food regulations.
Dialectic forms, and it can produce more comprehensive policy and inform each side of the
considerations that cause farmers and eaters to
think the way they do.
It is completely in the interest of consumers
to be more aware and involved in the process of
raising livestock, the standards of slaughter and
packing, and the modes of transportation and
refrigeration that ultimately deliver food to grocery stores. Such participation should be especially encouraged in light of food-borne diseases
and obesity concerns. For farmers, the obligation to draw up policy with consumer groups
provides a crucial forum to present their side of
the story: the complexities of agricultural techniques, the cost-effectiveness of various methods, and the gritty realities of livestock production that most farmers have long grown accustomed to but often shock consumers.
Hopefully the impulse for schism will not
trump this necessary dialogue.

Pope

Treating soldiers'
invisible wounds
BY FATHER ED WINHAUS
NEWMAN CHAPLAIN/RELIGIOUS
ADVISER
ewindhal@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore students and faculty gathered in collection organized by SDS and the President's Office
last Friday to mark the sixth anniversary of the U.S.
invasion of Iraq. Some of the questions raised at the
Collection centered around strategies for protesting
the war and assuaging its devastating impact on
Iraqi society. Although a discussion of the war's
legitimacy and the damage it has caused is certainly
valuable, we believe that it is time to shift the discussion at this late stage in the conflict from the
causes and course of the war to its long-term consequences. Of particular concern is the war's impact
on the psychological health of the soldiers who
waged it.
As military personnel are reintegrated into civilian society, it is imperative that Congress honors the
sacrifices they have made by ensuring adequate
funding for the mental health care of veterans.
Although it is hard to imagine anyone seriously
opposing mental health care for U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq, the current mental health treatment
for soldiers is woefully inadequate, and it is unclear
whether or not Obama's Budget for Veterans Affairs,
which is set to come out mid-April, will sufficiently
address the current system's shameful inadequacies.
Testifying in Congress earlier in March, Brigadier
General Loree Sutton, director of the Defense Center
of Excellence for Psychological Health and
Traumatic Brain Injury, said that the Military had
"come a long way since just over a year ago," when
Congress gave her organization $9OO million dollars
to conduct research and implement structural
changes to the military's mental health system.
Sutton's optimism, however, may be a little misplaced. Suicide rates in the military continue to spiral upwards, as 20 percent of soldiers screen positive
for post-traumatic stress disorder before re-deployment and divorce rates among active-duty soldiers
continue to climb.
There is only so much Obama can do. Military culture still places a stigma on mental illness, and
despite a growing chorus of military men and women
who have begun to speak publicly about PTSD, military culture has only begun to adapt. Army
Secretary Pete Geren said, "Stigma [about mental illness] is a challenge. It's certainly a challenge in the
culture of the Army, where we have a premium on
strength, physically, mentally, emotionally." Army
Major General David Blackledge agreed that soldiers
had to be trained to discuss their mental health
issues. "It's part of our profession...nobody wants to
admit that they've got a weakness...We've got to talk
about it," Blackledge said.
They have to talk about it in Congress as well.
Despite doubling the amount of money going to treat
mental illness in the military since 2001, statistics
compiled by the military show that in certain ways,
the military has gotten less effective at treating mental illness in the ranks. The ratio of "behavior health
workers" to troops in Iraq nearly doubled between
the years 2004 to 2007, and a recent report by Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans for America demonstrates that
only one third of Marines who were diagnosed with
PTSD in America had their treatment continue when
they returned to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Because so many soldiers have not received treatment abroad, it is imperative that there is enough
funding to allow them to receive treatment when
they return. The military has drawn up a variety of
strategies that it says will increase its ability to treat
veterans. These strategies include opening a suicide
hotline, hiring thousands of new mental health
workers and screening all veterans who seek treatment at Veteran Hospitals for a range of mental illnesses.
These programs need funding. Obama recently
pledged to expand federal funding to Veterans
Affairs by $25 billion over the next five years.
Student activists should ensure that Obama sticks to
this pledge, and that Obama funnels a higher percentage of this money into programs designed to
ensure our soldiers' psychological well being.

The Phoenix's March 18 editorial on Benedict XXl's in-flight
response
at
an
impromptu
press
question ("The Pope
courts a contracepcontroversy") was fairly

tion
focused and touched upon the
underlying question that is almost
never raised. The use of condoms
as that default against AIDS generally avoids the (newly resurrected) "8001b gorilla in the room":
the whole topic of sex itself.
Responding with counter-studies
that show improvement in AIDS
rates where sex is put into the
context of natural law just produces another "survey debate"
and surrenders the option of suggesting that pure science might
not be the only foundation for
right reasoning in this controversial argument.
It is not news to the Phoenix
that the Church has not come
along for the ride as Western civilization sets sail for a brave new
world where sex has little or nothing in particular to do with love,
marriage or procreation. In handing on the eloquence of Genesis
received from the faith of Israel,
the Church bought
hook, line
and sinker
the evidence of
human biology and psychology
that sexual intimacy has two obvious and inseparable
consequences.

And, because both are essential

the two in one flesh image
and not just in the biological
fact of intercourse, but on a level
that not even science can fully
understand, the bonding of man
and woman in every aspect of
their lives and for the totality of
those lives.
Love is the first consequence.
The second is dependent upon it:
because of the bond of love, the

Darwin is probably right on:
We have evolved as a species to
monogamous mating-for-life for
the sake of species preservation.
So what does a swath of latex
have to do with all of this and how
in the world could an intelligent
(you've got to spot the guy something here) man as Benedict possibly be inclined to see condoms as
the snake in the garden rather
than the guarantor against infection?
My adolescence, in the eighth
century, found us young folk more
concerned about how not to get
pregnant than even getting some
infection or other nothing as deadly, admittedly, as AIDS, but still
quite nasty
then and now.
Condoms were nowhere near the
top of the list of what was deemed
"safe" in that regard. Girls still got
pregnant. And it wasn't just
because the technology was
underdeveloped (that being also a

truism).
The primary cause of pregnancy with premarital sex (always the
nomenclature) was the cocktail of
passion, the temporary insanity of
good old-fashioned lust, and the
general ten- thumb-itis of the
moment. They broke, they slipped
and they couldn't be found in

time.
In the era of "Leave it to
Beaver," the great shame of an
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and the
social and moral judgment of an
action (maybe less so if it was a
lifestyle) were more prophylactic
than anything bought over the
counter. I genuinely feel great
angst and pity for the present generation because of the absolute
innundation of sexuality in the
arts and in advertising you
endure, and the deliberate promulgation of the notion that if you
are not sexually active there is
something wrong with you.
Today's stakes are higher still.
You can die from this. Still it's
freedom. Right? And an obscenely
lucrative industry benefits from
it.

"They can't be responsible about

The Church, certainly not
oblivious to the "real" world,

Crazy, huh?
The artificiality and technology of contraception that was so
novel with "the Pill" when Paul VI

Men's lacrosse finally absolves Red Devils with win
BY MADDIE WILLIAMS

mwillil@swarthmore.edu

For the first time since 2003, Garnet men's lacrosse
scored a victory against the Red Devils of Dickinson.
This Saturday, the Garnet flew past Dickinson in a
10-5 contest at Clothier Field, marking the team's first
Centennial Conference victory of the season. The win
boosts Swarthmore to a record of 2-3 overall and a
record of 1-1 in conference play.
Goalie Kevin Friedenberg 'lO continued to be a powerful and reliable force for Swarthmore. "Nothing got
past him," commented Joe Niagara 'l2. Indeed,
Friedenberg posted a career-high 18 saves, with seven
in the first period alone. Friedenberg also came away
with four ground balls, a team-high for the day.
Not to be outdone, the Garnet offense also did not
disappoint. Shooting precision was key: Out of 23
shots, Swarthmore managed to find the back of the net
ten times.
On the flip side, of 40 shots put up by Dickinson,
only five slipped past Friedenberg.

An assortment of players combined to reach success
on the offensive end. Tyler Bradshaw 'lO led the Garnet
with four goals, a career-high. Max Hubbard 'l2 came
away with two unassisted goals, as did Will Predun 'O9.
Gavin Musynske 'lO also scored two goals, one of
which was assisted by co-captain Ben Young 'O9. Cocaptain David DeSimone 'O9 also recorded an assist,
aiding one of Bradshaw's four tallies.
The impressive performance of the Swarthmore
attacks stood in stark contrast to past struggles. "We
were able to hold on to the ball and win possession
time," Bradshaw said.
He continued that, earlier in the season, "the team
has been plagued by an inability to control the ball in
high-pressure situations."
Much has been said about replenishing the Garnet
roster, which was hit hard by graduation in 2008.
Several new faces have stepped up and made an impact
so far.
Bradshaw cited Hubbard in the attack, along with
John Buckawyn 'l2 in the midfield and MattBowers 'l2
on defense, as important additions to the team.

Players with experience aim to aid the transition to
college lacrosse for the newcomers. "The older guys on
the team ... understand that freshmen make mistakes
and are encouraging when you mess up," Hubbard

said.
Classmate Niagara cited Jake Metzger 'O9 as a key
figure in his development, noting him as someone
"who has developed into a team leader that the younger
guys like myself look up to."
As the middle of the season approaches, the team
has high hopes as they integrate into a cohesive,
revamped Garnet squad.
According to Bradshaw, "this year's team goal is to
win those close conference games that slipped through
our hands last year" and, as always, to make it to the
Centennial Conference championship.
The Garnet will return to Clothier Field on
Saturday, when they will take on conference rival
Muhlenberg (0-2, 0-5 CC) at 2:30 p.m.

Multimedia multiplies viewing options in sports
I usually

use my column
to

complain

Josh Abel
Called Third

about the
sports
media.
This week,
I'd like to
integrate a
little bit of
my amazement with
sports multimedia.
The
ongoing

march of Internet technology is yielding some incredible benefits for sports
fans.
Take, for example, March Madness.
In the days when you could only watch
the tournament on a television, you
were at the mercy of your local CBS
affiliate regarding which games you
would be able to see.
If you lived in the Philadelphia area,
for instance, and Villanova was playing, your only choice was to watch their
game, even if you had no interest in
Villanova and there was a better game
on elsewhere.
Not anymore. Now, you simply go to
www.cbssportsline.com and pick which
game you want to watch. There's a bit
of lag, but the video is extremely high
quality, and you have the luxury of
jumping around and watching only the
tight games or the ones that affect your
bracket most.
On a campus where most students
don't have ready access to a television,
this online option may not just be a
it
great way to follow the tournament
may be the only way.
Oh, and it's free. (And legal.)
Another fantastic sports multimedia
option is MLB.corn's Gameday application. This allows you to keep careful
track of any baseball game even if
someone's hogging the television or if
you need to study. Gameday tracks
every at-bat and every pitch in close-toreal time. It shows who's on base, who's
pitching and who's in the field, in addition to providing an up-to-date box
score.
And when I say it "tracks" every
pitch, I mean it. It doesn't merely tell
you if it was a ball or a strike, nor does

THE PHOENIX

it just show you where the pitch ended
up. It shows you how it got there.
Gameday is hooked up to camera systems that have been installed in every
Major League park that track the ball
from the pitcher's hand to home plate.
You can thus see how fast the pitch was
moving and how much it was curving
at any point during its flight.
This feature makes Gameday a boon
even when you are watching the game
when there's a close pitch,
on TV
rather than depending on the eyeball
judgment of some extremely biased
commentator, you can consult the precise measurements of these cameras.
The last great feature of Gameday is
in-game highlights. While Gameday
does not allow you to actually watch the
game, it posts video of any big hits or
defensive gems minutes after they happen, so you don't even have to wait to
see a highlight reel.
Again, free and legal.
These are just two shining examples
of the great sports multimedia that we
are able to access; highlight reels and
player interviews are mere mouse
clicks away. While all of that is great, it
seems that these fantastic sports multimedia are part of the reason that traditional sports media are now so unsatisfying.

For instance, consider the role of

newspapers' game recaps, which give
an account of key plays and quotes from
key players. These recaps have basically become obsolete, since anyone with

an Internet connection can see all the
highlights (and many interviews) long

before the newspaper is ever delivered.
Why wait until morning to read an
article about a game when you can see
more about it right now than 800 words
and a box score could ever convey?
Even SportsCenter, ESPN's highlight
show, has been pushed to the side,
because these web sites (including
ESPN.com, ironically) allow you to see
highlights whenever you want, not
based around some programming
schedule.
This proliferation of information has
placed a lot more pressure on sports
sections' commentary elements, since
fewer and fewer people are relying on
them for game coverage. And it's this
pressure, I believe, that is responsible
for much of the simplistic columns
filled with false anger that currently

pollute so many sports pages.
Who's going to open up a sports section nowadays if there's no spitting diatribe about Alex Rodriguez or Pacman

Jones?
There's no place for nuance or
sophistication because if your tagline
doesn't draw in readers (or viewers),
they have no other reason to read your
paper (or watch your channel), since
highlights and interviews are available
online and opinions can be found on
dime-a-dozen sports blogs.
This is why ESPN devotes much of
its television schedule to "experts"

yelling at players and each other, and
why sports, columns are filled with
overly harsh criticisms and underdeveloped arguments.

Traditional sports media outlets are

being backed up against the wall, having lost much of their purpose to these
newer, more powerful media.
Their fight for relevance now
depends on their ability to be controversial and polarizing, since their ability to cover sports has been outstripped
by ever-improving multimedia sources.

Cameron and Waterhouse lead baseball against Berks
two innings to seize a 13-7 victo-

BY JARED NOLAN

ry.

jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore baseball opened
Centennial Conference play on
Tuesday at Muhlenberg. The
Mules (7-11-1) won the first game
of the two-game series 4-L
Anthony Montalbano 'l2 scored
the lone Garnet run with a solo
home run in the eighth inning,
while all four of the Mules' runs
were unearned.
The Garnet ended its opening
stretch of non-conference games
by splitting a doubleheader with
Penn State-Berks on Saturday
and dropping a Sunday game
against Misericordia. With a
late-inning outburst of runs, the
Garnet (8-9) easily tookthe morning game 12-4 against Berks (7-71), but in the second match it was
the Nittany Lions who displayed
the late-game heroics, pulling
out an 8-7 eight-inning win (in
doubleheaders, regulation play
consists of seven innings instead
of nine).
Coming off three days of rest,
the Misericordia Cougars (10-7)
outlasted the Garnet on Sunday,
scoring seven runs in the final

Head Coach Stan Exeter
described his players' performance over the weekend as "okay,"
but conceded that the team's
schedule was a tough one to take
on.
He also noted that playing
three games in two days was a
valuable experience because it
mirrors the format of the conference schedule.
The effects of such short rest
showed in the Sunday game, as
the Garnet could not keep up the
intensity against Misericordia.
In the top of the eighth, Exeter
had to send Adam Hardy 'l2 to
the mound, even though the firstyear pitched one and a third
scoreless innings the day before.
Hardy gave up four runs in a
third of an inning that gave the
Cougars a 10-7 lead.
After falling behind, the
Garnet hitters could not respond
and went hitless in the final two
innings. Misericordia went on to
win 13-7 after trailing 7-6 with
seven innings played.
The first game of the weekend against Berks produced bet-

ter results for Swarthmore.
Going into the fifth inning the

Garnet
trailed
4-3,
but Montalbano homered to lead
off the inning and tie the score.
Mike Waterhouse 'l2 singled to
left field and advanced to second
after an error by Berks' pitcher.
Spencer Ross 'l2 followed with a
walk and the two runners ended
up on second and third when the
Berks' pitcher balked. A single
by Michael Cameron 'l2 scored
Waterhouse and Ross and later
in the inning Cameron scored
off a sacrifice fly by Matt Lamb
'l2.
Swarthmore repeated the
four-run effort in the sixth.Lamb
singled to center field to score
Ross and Cameron. Another single by Ben Schneiderman 'll
scored Lamb, and after the next
at-bat a throwing error by the
Berks' third baseman allowed
Jimmy Gill 10 to touch home
plate. The eight run swing put
the Garnet up 11-4 and the team
added one more in the ninth
when Cameron's double drove in
Waterhouse again.
With the non-conference
schedule over, the Garnet has

shifted its focus to the upcoming
match-ups.
conference
Waterhouse, who has been one of
the hot hitters for the Garnet,
hopes to maintain his streak for
the Centennial opponents. "I
know conference play is going to
be harder, but hopefully I can
keep up my hard work," he said.
Waterhouse also explained
the significance of the non-conference games. "While those
games were important, coach
has emphasized we need to learn
from our mistakes," he said. "If
we keep repeating our mistakes
other teams will capitalize on
them and we will suffer more."
Exeter noted another merit to
playing so many out-of-conference opponents. "We were in
every kind of game possible," he
said. "We've won games in every
possible way and we've lost
games in every possible way."
This experience has been particularly valuable to first-year players like Waterhouse.
At this point in the season one
of the main areas of concern for
the Garnet is the pitching rotation. "Right now we have three
definite starters and [Coach] is

looking for a fourth definite

starter,"

Waterhouse

said.

"Everyone's had a good outing,
but I don't think anyone's solidified the position now." And it

does not look like anyone will.
Exeter clarified the situation.
"We're gonna go on a case-by-

case basis," he said. "That's what
you get with a young team."
The team may be young and
lack experience, but it definitely
has talent. First-year first baseman Cameron is evidence of that
fact. After batting .600 in five
games last week with nine runs
and six runs batted in, In addition to being named the Division
111 E.C.A.C. South Region Player
of the Week, Cameron was
named Centennial Conference
Player of the Week, while
Waterhouse got the CC nod two
weeks ago, making this the first
time Swarthmore players have
received the designation in backto-back weeks.
Waterhouse and Cameron
will look to continue their early
success on Friday, when the
Garnet finishes the two-game
series against Muhlenberg at 3:30
p.m. on the Clothier Fields.

Ranked Bullets puncture women's lacrosse defense
BY ANDREW GREENBLATT
agreen3@swarthmore.edu

The

Swarthmore

women's lacrosse team fell
to #6 Gettysburg on
Saturday at Clothier field
by a score of 18-6.
The margin of defeat
says
less about the

Garnet's deficiencies than
it does about Gettysburg's
strengths. Gettysburg is
perennially among the
toughest
Garnet's
matchups of the season.
The loss, which an amateur fan may dismiss as a
non-descript
blowout,
holds promise for this
team's future.
The
Gettysburg
matchup could be indicative of the season to come,
but not because of the
score. "Gettysburg had

control of the game from
start to finish the past five
or six times we've played
them," said Garnet head
coach Karen Borbee. "We
haven't made Gettysburg
compete with us and this
time we did."
Saturday,
On
Gettysburg jumped out to a
quick 2-0 start, a familiar
and ominous beginning.
But
midway
around
through the first half, at
the 22 minute mark, Amy
Vachal 'll put in her 21st
goal of the season to make
the score 2-1, prompting
Gettysburg head coach
Carol Cantele to promptly
"[The
call a timeout.
immediacy of the timeout]
was a great feelingbecause

18

we knew at that point they
were competing with us,"
Borbee said. "On the
whole, we made them
work the entire game."
Despite the 18 goals
allowed this past weekend,
Swarthmore will continue
to rely on a combination of
an experienced defensive
line supported by a young
offensive front. The team's
seven seniors, who have
'all been playing for four
years, established right
from the start a great work
ethic,", noted Borbee.
She continued to praise
the experienced seven,
characterizing them by a
shared philosophy. Borbee
went on to note that the
seniors share "the idea
that you're only going to
get out of it what you put
in," Borbee said.
One of those seniors,
co-captain
Melissa
Grigsby 'O9, ranks third in
the conference with 3.2
ground balls per game and
third in caused turnovers
with 2.0 per game. She and

fellow co-captain Kelsey
Hatzell 'O9 anchor a
defense that had kept all
teams at bay before facing
the powerful Bullets.
Swarthmore ranks second
in the conference in
ground balls per game, a
key hustle statistic which
indicates the presence of a
proficient offense.
The defense's efforts to
keep the ball alive have
allowed for the Garnet
offense to also yield
impressive results thus

far. Co-captain Marissa
Schaffer 'O9 leads the team
of young attackers and
midfielders. Vachal and
Emily Evans 11 rank in
the top ten in the conference in goals per game,
and as a team, the Garnet
rank first in shots on goal
per game, averaging 27.67.

That being said, the
team is aware of its potential this season and is try-

ing to put the pieces together after a "productive" loss.
"We had a good first half
and a not-so-good second

half" Evans said.

"We
need to learn how to play
consistently well."
But overall, this group
seems like they're having a

blast. "It's kind of silly and

focused at the same time.
We're all friends and we
like to goof around a lot,"
Evans said.
Coach Borbee continued: "I'm really enjoying
this group. They're having
a really good time together.
I would definitely credit
the seniors for that."
Borbee also realizes that
there is still work to be
done if the Garnet expects
to make the playoffs.
"That's the bottom line,
she said. "We have to have
a winning record in the
conference. We've got to
win five [conference]

The path to these five
wins continues Saturday,
with a matchup against
McDaniel that has carried
crucial consequences in
recent years. Before a 19-7

loss last season, the Garnet
had beaten McDaniel on
the road in 2006 by a slim
16-15 margin, a pivotal
game that pushed the
Garnet into the postseason
while forcing McDaniel to
watch from home.
In 2007, the Green
Terror avenged their 'O6
loss by handing the Garnet

March 26, 2009

a one-goal defeat at
Clothier Field by a score of

With a 0-1 conference
record and a tough

the

a powerhouse only to be
smoked by another in its
next game.

However, as should be
evident about my feelings
regarding this tournament, what I feel is most
exciting is when a team
that everyone writes off
wins a few games and
shows people that sometimes having a lot of heart
in games can count more
than having a lot of skill.
In this year's tourney,
unlike any others that I
have watched, the teams

that "should win on paper"
are the teams that have
actually been winning. To
me, this is boring; this is
not what March Madness
should be about.
If this year's Final
Four is made up of the
number one seeds from
each bracket, I will be
pretty depressed.
Even though, theoretically, this is how the tournament is supposed to
proceed, I feel like there
is always a strong hope
that some of the underdogs pull off Cinderella
runs.

Softball winds up for looming Centennial season

The Swarthmore Garnet softball team
(9-8) was defeated by #8 SUNY-Cortland on
Saturday but bounced back to sweep Penn
State-Berks on Sunday at Clothier Field
in two days of doubleheader action.
The Garnet had strong hitting from the
quartet of Kristin Caspar 'O9, Kathryn
Riley 'O9, Krista Scheier 'll and Zoe
Hendrickson 'll, but were not able to
effectively stifle the ranked Red Dragons'

stingy offense and lost the contests 8-3 and
6-2, respectively.
On Sunday, Swarthmore emerged victorious against Berks from the first contest
by a score of 7-1, and finished the Nittany
Lions off in five innings, 10-0, in the second.
Strong at-bats from a slew of players
propelled the Garnet to two convincing
victories.
In the first contest, the momentum
took off for the Garnet with a leadoff atbat from Christine Sendelsky 'O9.
Elizabeth Cushing 'l2 added a bunt, and
Sendelsky was able to score off of a hit
from catcher Michelle Perch 'lO.
A single to left field in the fourth
inning from Captain Lauren Walker 'O9
was the catalyst for a five-run inning that
all but clinched the win.

The Garnet also had four stolen bases
in the inning, and Perch smashed a double to right field to bring in Sendelsky for
a 6-1 Garnet lead. Sendelsky earned an
RBI off of a single to right field, increasing the Garnet lead to six.
A solid pitching effort from Alexandra
Zelaski 'O9, who improved to 3-4 and only
allowed one unearned run, completed
what was a well-rounded effort for the

Garnet.

During the second contest of the day,
pitcher Riley shut down the Lions'
offense.

hits

throughout the day, tallying her third
shutout of the season.
Meanwhile, the Swarthmore offense
was at it again with doubles from Riley,
Sendelsky and Walker that pushed the
Garnet to a comfortable eight-run lead.Walker attributed the victories to an
increased amount of confidence among
members of the team. "We have been coming to every game with more and more
confidence. Our hitting has looked good,

and we are looking to come off of these
wins with momentum into our conference
games," she said.
The team also has the addition of three
first-years, who have all been put to good
use. Indeed, the presence of the trio of
shortstop Elizabeth Cushing 'l2, pitcher

Marley Spector 'l2 and outfielder Sasha
Wijeyeratne 'l2 hasn't gone unnoticed.
"The freshmen are a great addition to
our team," Walker said of the newcomers.
"They come out to every game with
enthusiasm and are giving it their best. I
think that they will grow as players
throughout the season and really become
a presence on the team."
Wijeyeratne cites the building of experience as a theme of her time on the squad
thus far. "We are all learning how to play
together as a team," she said.
"Our trip to North Carolina was a good
experience because we got a number of
games under our belt, and we are looking
forward to a strong season," she added. .
On the opposite end of the spectrum,
returning captains Riley, Sendelsky,
Walker and Zelaski look to lead the team
this season as Swarthmore works toward

receiving a fourth consecutive Centennial
Conference playoff bid.
Head coach Renee Clarke has set lofty

goals for this season. One of them is to
win the Conference Championship.
Additionally, she is setting her sights on
securing an NCAA Divison 111 national
tournament bid.
In securing the team a tough early-season schedule, Clarke seeks to prepare the
women for the many strong conference

March 26, 2009

opponents that they will face throughout
the next several weeks.
In 2008, the Garnet earned a berth in
the Centennial Conference playoff tournament by virtue of their fourth-place conference ranking of 10-6.
The fourth seed in the four-team tournament, Swarthmore was elminated after
consecutive losses to top seed Ursinus and
second seed Haverford by scores of 3-4 and
3-7, respectively.
It wasn't over yet, however.
The Garnet went on to receive their
first postseason bid and first postseason
-

victory in the E.C.A.C. Southern Region
championships after the conference tournament last year.
Soon, they will know where they stand
and if they will be in position to build on
their post-season appearances from 2008.
In a final non-conference double header last night, the Garnet split with
Widener in Chester, dropping the first
game by score of 7-2 before regrouping to
shutout the Pride in a 3-0 win in the sec-

ond game.
In the immediate future, Swarthmore
will enter the Centennial Conference fray
when they take on Dickinson (9-7, 0-2 CC),
with whom they split last year, on March
28, and Ursinus, the defending conference
champion, on March 31.
