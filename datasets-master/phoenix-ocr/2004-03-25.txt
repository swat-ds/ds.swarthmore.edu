Grade inflation not a
concern for professors
BY MEGO LIEN
mlienl@swarthmore.edu
"Anywhere else it would've been an A."
Say it enough times, and this catch phrase

evolves into a mantra crucial to the survival of the Swarthmore student's selfesteem. B on your paper? Could've,
should've been an A. Can't pass the swim
test? Go splashing anywhere else.
Swarthmore prides itself on offering
academic rigor in a non-competitive atmosphere. The de-emphasis on grades and
maintenance of high intellectual standards

has allowed Swarthmore to keep its grades

Ville pharmacy closes after three decades
Michael's College Pharmacy, the Ville establishment across from the SEPTA
train station, closed its doors for good Tuesday after 33 years of business.
Jack McDonnell, the owner of the pharmacy, has sold his remaining inventory
to CVS and now plans to rent out the building. He is still looking for renters and
does not know what sort of business will use the building.
Store clerk Doris Donald explained that McDonnell was in his mid-'6os and
tired of the work involved in running a pharmacy. "It's too much to maintain, so
he's moving on," she said.
Emily Remus 'O6 was upset to hear that Michael's would be closing. "I'm very
apprehensive about the future without Michael's Pharmacy, because like many
Swarthmore students I don't have a car with which to drive to CVS," she said. "I
just won't be able to fill my prescriptions in the same efficient manner."
Students with cars on campus seemed less concerned about the absence of
the pharmacy. Valerie Marone 'O5 will gladly make the longer trip to CVS. "I think

"'

Dartmouth's - newspaper
reported.
"Swatties may or may not have more work
than their counterparts at Dartmouth or
Amherst colleges," the article said, "but
they do have lower average grades."
Despite popular belief, however, one
professor's study and the testimonies of
several others reveal that Swarthmore's
grades are on the upswing.
Grade inflation, by definition, involves
a rise in grades without a concurrent rise
in student performance, a study by the
Texas Education Review said. It can occur
over time, across academic departments or
among academic institutions.
Harvard embodies a famous case of
grade inflation. A 2001 Harvard study
reported that 91 percent of Harvard seniors
"graduated with some kind of honor on
their diploma," where honors required a Bminus or better in students' majors.
About half of the undergraduate grades
were A or A-minus. By contrast, only 22
percent of Harvard graduates had A's in
1966, USA Today reported.
In 1993, economics professor Mark
Kuperberg set out to study the state of
grading at Swarthmore.
By comparing grade records over time,
across departments and (confidentially)
among other colleges, Kuperberg found
"significant grade inflation" in all three
areas, he said.

Inflation across departments
Where Harvard professors attributed
the high grades to, as the Harvard study
said, "pressure to grade similarly to colleagues, fear of becoming known as a
'tough grader' and pressure from students
accustomed to higher grades," Kuperberg
suggested two interrelated and more objec-

tive explanations for his findings.
First, he said, grades tend to be lower in
larger classes, which are frequently more
impersonal entry-level courses. When the
college went to PDCs, Kuperberg said,
classes were capped at 25 students, so many
courses shrank in size, resulting in a rise
in grades across time.
Similarly, PDCs and smaller classes

focus more on writing, where grades tend
to be higher due to the subjective nature of
evaluating the work.

Kuperberg said he himself found it difficult to dip lower than C-minus when grading papers.
Professors today experience "less certainty" and "more self-questioning" when
evaluating students' ideas, Kuperberg
said.
But in the English department, where
grades are based heavily on students' writing and ideas, "there [aren't] any great
obstacles to assigning the grade that a
paper deserves," English professor Nora
Johnson said in an e-mail.
The English literature department discussed grading standards and that the faculty tended to agree about what made a
strong paper, according to Johnson.
"Our standards for grading papers are
rigorous, and we're generally satisfied
with those standards," she said.
On the other hand, the department
"takes low grades very seriously," Johnson
said. "We know that when we give them we
are communicating our real sense that the
work needs to improve substantially."

Relating grade inflation to the rise of

PDCs and writing sheds light on the discrepancies between the grades of humanities majors versus natural science

majors, whose classes tend to be larger
and less writing-oriented. Kuperberg's
study confirmed that the natural sciences

graded lower than the social sciences,
which in turn graded lower than the
humanities.
No one had to explain this trend to nat-

ural science majors.

"Coming here, I definitely had a hard
time trying to adjust [to the academics],"
said Wee Chua 'O6, who is on the pre-med
track. "I still have not been able to crack
the A barrier ... [which] is sometimes hard
to accept because of expectations from my
parents or myself."

For second year in a row, appointments chair resigns
BY MARY MINTEL
mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Saed Atshan 'O6 will not be
completing his term as a member
of Student Council. This is the
second time in two years that an

appointments chair has resigned.
Atshan resigned because he
had chosen to study abroad this
fall rather than to complete his
term.
Upon deciding to do a special
major in Middle Eastern studies,
Atshan said he would need to
study elsewhere to find enough
classes that interested him. This

fall he will be

Egypt.

While Atshan is excited about
his foreign study prospects, he
regrets not fulfilling his pledge
to serve the student body.
"I feel really bad not finishing
my full-year term," he said. "I
apologize to those people who

voted for me."
In the fall of 2002, the resignation of Appointments Chair
Chirag Chotalia 'O3 prompted the
council to pass a new bylaw

allowing
appoint

the

co-presidents

to

an interim member, who

must be approved of by two-thirds
of the council. The appointed

member would serve until a special election could be held.
In this case, Student Council is
running a special election to find
a replacement for Atshan rather

than appointing an interim mem-

ber.

Co-President

Emiliano

Rodriguez 'O5 said in an e-mail,
"We are running [the election] a
little bit early so as to have some-

one around while Saed does the
bulk of the work the appointments chair does so that the transition is smooth."

Rodriguez repeatedly stressed

the "ordinary" nature of the election.

Vallianos 'O5 agreed with these
sentiments. "Student Council recognizes that unexpected things

within the confines of our consti-

happen," she said.

"This is completely normal and

tution," he said. "Everything
should run just fine. Saed will finish this semester and be replaced
by someone for a one-semester
term."

Atshan has done nothing wrong.
"His plans change like most
people's plans tend to change,
between their sophomore and junior years and we completely

Student Council will hold a

to fill the appointments position.
The winner will shadow

as an apprentice and will serve as

tistics," Registrar Martin Warner said in an e-mail. "I have
nothing to say about grades except that at Swarthmore
we emphasize learning, not grades."
Johnson wrote that English majors from Swarthmore
"do very well" after college. "It isn't ever easy to compete
for admission to exclusive graduate programs, but we've
been very pleased with the results that our students have
gotten when they apply," she said.
Where they had to, professors have always dealt with
the difference in grades in their recommendations for
Swarthmore students competing for post-college programs
and jobs. "I deal with [grade inflation] personally," math
professor Stephen Maurer '67 said in an e-mail. "When I
write a recommendation for a student
if I mention the
grade a student got from me, I always give the grade distribution for that course."
Recommendations are particularly important for competitive programs where one-tenth of a GPA can influence
a student's chances of acceptance. Nevertheless,
Swarthmore pre-med students have experienced a
"tremendous amount of success" in medical school admissions, Health Sciences Adviser Gigi Simeone said.
Medical schools "know we're a very tough place,"
Simeone said, "so there's a little bit of give in Swarthmore
grades." The average GPA of accepted pre-med students has
typically been lower than the national average, she said.
Grades do not affect employment as much as they do
graduate school admissions, Career Services Director
Nancy Burkett said. However, Sanggee Kim 'O4 said that, in
her experience, employers "do use [GPA] as a filtering system," especially for hiring at highly competitive companies.
Some students become troubled when their comparatively lower GPAs affect their chances for graduate school and
job acceptances. Carolyn Sha 'O4 said GPA had never really
been a matter of stress for her and that the GPA requirements for jobs in business appear to spread over a wide
range. But some of Sha's friends who majored in the natural

Inflation across time
Economics professor Larry Westphal estimated that he
had taught 900 students in 23 years of teaching at Princeton
and then Swarthmore. Intermediate Microeconomics is
notoriously difficult among students, but Westphal said he
had maintained the same rigorous grading standards since
the 'Bos. Students can typically "forget it" if they expect to
ace the course with ease, he said.
By maintaining strict grading standards, Westphal can
accurately compare students' performances, lending credibility to recommendations he writes for his students. "If
you're known and your standards are known, then your
recommendations count for something," he said.
Political science professor Richard Valelly '75 attributed grade inflation to better student performance.
"Professors are not more lenient, but students today are
doing better than we did," Valelly said.

Kuperberg agreed that "the objective qualities of students, on average, are rising," but he said they "work less
hard" than before, causing an evening out in students' per-

formances across time.
Westphal, on the other hand, attributed the rise in
grades in part to a rise in student expectations. "When I
first came [to Swarthmore]," he said, "getting a B was a
good deal. Now, students get B's and think they've failed."
Engineering professor Lynne Molter '79 said that while
she had not observed any change in students' abilities
"Swarthmore students have always been extremely gifted," she said students today do give "more attention to a
broader diversity" of extracurricular activities.

Graduate schools and jobs
Nonetheless, the fact remains that Swarthmore's grades
are generally lower than the grades at competing institutions. "Colleges

Sachin Kale 'O4 has won $22,000 to learn
about the religious part of taking care of

the dying.
With his grant from the Thomas J.
Watson Foundation, Kale said, he plans to
look at the spirtual environment surrounding hospice care "to see how faith
and spirituality help the dying and their
families cope with death and make peace
in their lives."
The religion and biology major, who
will be traveling to India, South Africa and
Thailand, also wants to "explain the religious worldview
of their medical

providers whose job it is to care for the

incurable."
Kale, who is on the pre-medical track,
has had no personal experience with hospice care besides one visit to an AIDS nursing home during an externship. But he
said his quest to learn about palliative care
was bound to memories of the patients he
spoke to then
patients who have since
died.
"My interaction with them was brief,"
Kale said. "It was an hour long, and this is

kind of my way of paying my respects to
them for sharing their stories."
Though many Watson fellows come to
their travel ideas after a lifetime of dreaming
take, for example, Tori HaringSmith '74, who visited the 13 smallest countries in the world in tribute to a childhood
book on the subject
Kale's began with a
book he saw in Cornell Library.
He recognized the name of the author,
Peter A. Selwyn, an AIDS doctor and
Swarthmore alumnus. In "Surviving the
Fall: The Personal Journey of an AIDS
Doctor," Selwyn "writes really passionately
about patients he'd met who had AIDS,"
Kale said. The stories motivated Kale to
seek an externship with the New York doc-

Ultimately, employment is determined much more by
people skills than by grades, many students said. "It's really all about networking," Kim said.
"Maybe it'd be better if people had higher grades,"
Chris Atanasiu 'O5 said. "Maybe you'd feel better about
yourself. But you're either competent or not [for a job], and
that comes through in the interview."

sciences have expressed frustration that Swarthmore grades
"don't reflect our absolute ability," she said.
"That does put us at a disadvantage," she said, since
many less-qualified applicants are getting jobs over
Swarthmore students and "it's an extremely trying and

Final thoughts
In the end, grades up or down, no one at Swarthmore
really seems to care.
Kuperberg's study "didn't cause a big stir," he said.
"The faculty are not paying a lot of attention [to grade
inflation]. They never have."
"I don't feel very informed [on the issue]," history professor Lillian Li said. "Everyone says there is grade inflation. I don't particularly feel there is in the history department, but I don't really know."
Kuperberg himself is "not a big one" on grade inflation.
"Grades are like signals," he said. "They should be informative." His major concern on the matter is grade dispersion. If all grades were equal and rising, then it would be
OK, Kuperberg said. But if "the signal gets corrupted, and
students gravitate towards higher grading departments,"
then he would have cause for concern.
"Swarthmore doesn't need grade inflation," Atanasiu
said.
"I generally try not to care about grades," Alan

McAvinney 'O6 said. When asked about his concerns about
getting into graduate school, he said, "I'll cross that bridge
when I get to it."

"I kind ofbraced myself for the fact that

it would be a really depressing experience," Kale said. But what doctors were
able to do for the patients during their last
days encouraged him instead. "There were
ways to make the patients' lives better,
and that in itself was reason for hope," he

said.
It was after his externship that Kale
began to wonder about the effect of religion on the experience of dying and the
care of incurable patients. Applying for
the Watson seemed to him a golden chance
to try to view that effect firsthand.
In India, English has status as the language of government and commerce. But
only 91 percent of South Africans speak it,
according to the Ethnologue, and it is not
spoken at all in Thailand. Nonetheless,
Kale expects to get by on English. But he
hopes four months in each place will be
enough time to get acquainted with the language.

a way to impart his year abroad anyway.
"I'll come up with some way to share

might want to hear about them," he said.

In London, Schwartz advises Blair government
BY ALEX

KALKSTEIN
akalkstl@swarthmore.edu

Psychology professor Barry Schwartz has received
much media attention for his recent book "The Paradox of
Choice: Why More is Less." The Royal Academy of the Arts
invited him to London to speak about the implications of
his research for choices in welfare and the potentially negative effects of those choices. Schwartz was subsequently
asked to give a presentation to the strategy unit, a think
tank that performs policy analysis for Prime Minister
Tony Blair's office. He sat down with The Phoenix to
answer a few questions about his trip to England and the
future direction of his research.

What role does the strategy unit play in the prime minister's office and other governmental offices?
Their job is to use all the tools that are available in
social science to answer policy questions and then let
other people worry about what the politics might be. But
what the people that I was talking to were interested in
was what's the right attitude to have about the welfare
consequences of giving people choices. They just wanted to
hear me talk about choice and what's good about it and
what's not good about it.
Who on the strategy unit were you speaking to?
I was invited to talk at this group called the Royal
Society for the Arts. But one of the people that works at the
prime minister's strategy unit had heard about my work.
So while I was there I spent an afternoon with this government think tank.
What specifically were they asking you?
I basically summarized the book I just published on the
non-obvious negative consequences of having too many
choices at the level of the individual. Everyone has always

thought, reasonably enough, that since some choice is
good, more choice has to be better. There's now good reason to believe that's not true. I crafted a talk about the
potential public policy implications like various efforts to
privatize services that are now provided publicly in the
name of giving people a variety of options and letting them
choose. I talked about that in connection with health
insurance, a very hot issue in England because there is a

consensus view that the National Health Service is broken
and no consensus about why it's broken or how to fix it.

Other than a trip to England, what else have you been
up to on your current leave of absence?
I am collaborating with [political science professor]
Ken Sharpe on an entirely different project, and the idea
was that I'd get a significant chunk of writing done. That
hasn't happened. We are continuing to shape what will be
a book proposal that I hope by the end of this academic
year will be done.
Do you anticipate advising Tony Blair's government,
other governments and institutions in the future?
I think it was a fluke, but we'll see what happens when
the book is translated into German. I think it was just a
fluke that the guy who works for Blair is a friend of the guy
who invited me to the RSA and they talked to one another.
How would you compare that level of interest or media
attention to the United States?
The United States is a much bigger place and I've gotten
my share of attention. But it doesn't compare. I've done a
whole bunch of radio interviews in the United States, but
there haven't been articles about me. When I published an
op-ed piece in The [New York] Times, it generated more
more than anything
response via personal e-mails to me
I've ever done in my life. Within days I had a couple hundred e-mails from all over the place from people I didn't

Virus attacks on network
put ITS projects on hold
BY CAROLINE GRUBBS

cgrubbsl@swarthmore.edu

Information Technology Services had to
stall many planned projects due to the time
and resources it has committed virus
attacks and security problems.
ITS Manager of Networking and

Systems Mark Dumic said that, because
ITS employees devoted "a third to a half of
our time" to network security, they "really
lost a whole year on projects" that had been
on the agenda.
Among the projects put on hold are
password synchronization for Blackboard,
Swatmail and Eudora, upgrades on operating systems for UNIX servers and enhancement of the mail system to provide encrypted, authenticated mail, according to Dumic.
So far, ITS has spent $90,000 out of its $1.5
million operating budget on anti-virus software and the new registration program,
Campus Manager, ITS Director Judy
Downing said. Similar programs in the past
have only cost about 30 to 50 percent of this
year's figure she said.
She estimated that, in addition, ITS had
spent $150,000 since the beginning of the
year in staff wages for overtime work on
"subjects related to security." This figure is
equal to hiring two full-time ITS employ-

ees, Downing said.
"There is an opportunity cost to consider
as well," Downing said. Time that could
have gone to other projects is now devoted
to researching and eradicating incoming
viruses, she said.
Dumic said ITS planned to pursue the
delayed projects this summer.
Hundreds of different strains of viruses
and worms have plagued the college net-

work this year, according to ITS Client

Services Manager Robin Jacobsen.
When the Blaster worm, Soßig and other
viruses hit the network, ITS spent eight- to

12-hour days cleaning computers, interim
UNIX system administrator Sean Finney 'O3
said. "From August until now, there hasn't
been a time when there hasn't been an incident," he said.
In January, the MyDoom worm infected
the campus network, sparking a second
wave of e-mail attacks.
ITS installed the Campus Manager system, which allowed ITS to monitor and
manage the Swarthmore network by quickly identifying computers infected by viruses»or at risk, Finney said.
Jacobsen pointed out that other schools
face similar problems when it comes to fixing infected networks. "We're certainly not
alone in this," Jacobsen said.
According to Downing, Stanford recently reported a cost of $BOO,OOO to combat e-

on their campus.
Downing said it could take a while to
curtail the escalating expenses -of fighting

mail viruses
viruses.

To help decrease costs, ITS will evaluate
long-term benefits when purchasing antivirus software, she said. ITS is also looking
into hiring a network security employee,
as current staff do not specialize in this
field, she said.
As time progresses, students and staff
will become more knowledgeable about email viruses and how to prevent them,
which will help decrease ITS costs signifi-

cantly, Downing said.
But "it's not that this problem is going
to go away," she added. "We don't see a

Living Wage collection incites controversy
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu
The living wage collection Friday elicited strong reactions from the audience and
caused history professor Allison Dorsey to
storm out of the Lang Performing Arts
Center cinema before the panel was over.
During the question-and-answer period,
Director of Dining Services
Linda

McDougall, a panelist, was asked about a
claim that she sometimes provides extra
food or financial support to employees in

crisis.
When McDougall was asked how often
these requests occur, she replied that they
only occurred a few times a year, and said,
"I prefer to give them food over money,

because I know where the food's going, but
I don't know where the money's going."
Some of the audience audibly gasped.
Dorsey said the comment was "a slur
against the character of people simply
because they're low-wage workers" and

abruptly

walked out of the

cinema.

Audience members clapped and were told
by Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l, the
panel's moderator, to stop.
Panelist and Living Wage and
Democracy Campaign member Mariah

'O4 agreed with the audience
members. "I thought the implication she
Montgomery

was making, that low-wage staff are incapable of handling their own money, was
completely inappropriate and irrelevant to
the conversation, and I was happy that several people in the audience dismissed it as
such," she said.

"I prefer to give [staff] food
over money, because I
know where the food's
going, but I don't know
where the money's going."
Linda McDougall,
Dining Services director
Prior to the question-and-answer session, McDougall expressed opposition to the
living wage proposal, citing quotes from
dining services staff that indicated they did
not want the new wage and saying she provided food or money to staff in extreme
need.
She expressed concern over "qualification creep," or an upsurge in overqualified
applicants and wage compression and also
said that if wages increased, she would be
hesitant to employ mentally disabled peo-

pie who currently work part time because
of the added cost of hiring them.

Other panelists included sociology and
anthropology professor Sarah Willie, Vice
President for Finance Sue Welsh, Vice
President Dan West, mathematics professor Charles Grinstead and administrative
assistant Kae Kalwaic.
Willie, a member of the Ad Hoc
Committee on a Living Wage, spoke of the
importance of focusing on the wage
increase. "It is very clear to me that this
proposal will be difficult to pay for but I
am fully confident in our ability to achieve
these things," she said.
Kalwaic thanked students for their dedication to the project and for stating the
...

campaign's relation to the college's mis-

sion.
Montgomery addressed practical impli-

cations and concerns about the living
wage. She said the best option would be for
entry-level jobs to stay entry level. If qualification creep occurred, she said, the
change would be in experience, not credentials. She also said wage compression was a
problem the college would "have to deal
with," and is "not a reason not to make a

change."

Welsh, West and Grinstead talked about
the financial issues surrounding the implementation of a living wage.

Welsh said that, although there had
been a modest growth in revenue, this
would not be enough to cover new projects.
"The endowment is not currently in a position to provide funds for new things" like
the proposed wage raise, Welsh said,
adding that the college knows it would
have to cut costs to reallocate funds for a
living wage.
West talked about problems in fundraising for the living wage, saying people who
would be "most likely to support are the
least likely to pay," since most of them work

for non-profit organizations and make less
money. "We can raise some amount, but it
won't be millions
it won't be easy and it
won'tbe quick... I believe we shouldn't look
to fund raising," he said.
Grinstead proposed "not raising the
minimum wage at all" and instead provid...

ing means-tested child care and health care
by increasing tuition by half of one percent
and decreasing full professor salary by the
same amount, which wouldraise $lBO,OOO.
Though campaign members liked the
panel, they were concerned about some of
the financial problems panelists mentioned.
"I think it was good to see there was a
range of perspectives on the panel," campaign member Al Bradbury 'O5 said. "I was
a little disappointed about the pessimism of

some of the folks speaking about funding."

Sager to discuss queer families Information science

Prompted by the nationwide
debate on same-sex marriage, the
16th Sager Symposium will focus

"We wanted to reflect upon the

The goal for "Queering the

is to spark discussion about queer

experiences challenging the traditional view of the family institution.
"We want to approach [the
debate] from the ground, probing

Alex takes a mid-semester look at his
prospects of finding a niche on campus
[Disclaimer: Any generalization herein regarding any
Swarthmore club, group or organization represents only complete
and unfounded speculation. Any suggestion of my lack of interest in
your group denotes only some severe character flaw on my part and
is not meant to slander or disrespect your organization in any way.
Really. I mean it.]
Sometimes, you just need to take a step back. Four weeks, yes,
four weeks of searching for that single perfect on-campus activity,
and still, not a lick of success. I've had fun. I've gotten down and boogied with some of the wildest and craziest groups Swarthmore
College has to offer. Those Knit-Wits? Man, they're a party a minute.
I swear to you. But now time is running out. It's not about partying
anymore; it's about finding a home, a family, an activity I can grow
to cherish and love for the rest of my Swarthmorean days. So, this
week, I'm taking a look at the big picture, surveying the whole grand
scope of things. What activities does our great college offer? Which
should I be visiting? And which should I cross off my list?
First out are the singing groups. True, they've got the coolest
names of any clubs on campus. No Swarthmore Singing Society
(SSS) here! Oscar and Emily, Mixed Company, 16 Feet, they all shatter that traditional name-generation paradigm that pervades our
school and sucks the very energy out of club life. Unfortunately,
though, they ask their members to sing. And I don't sing. At all. I just
hum. Sometimes. Badly. So I don't anticipate finding a home there.
Nor are they the only groups that require skills and experience I
don't have. The Mother Puckers? I've never skated before. The
Outsiders?
I've never hiked or camped. The Sexual Health
Counselors? Well, let's not even go there.
Sports are out for similar reasons. My idea of exercise is walking up the hill from PPR to Parrish two or three times a day. A
rugby practice would probably kill me. I figure it's hard to build a
lasting bond with an organization if you're dead after the first
meeting. So no rugby, no ultimate
Frisbee, nothing that would imperil my physical well-being any more
than my current state of lethargy
already does.
Then there are the groups I'm
pre-screened from participating in.
My ethnic background keeps me
out of SAO, and my sexuality forbids me from SQU. SWAP
(Swarthmore Women in Astronomy
and Physics) is a double whammy.
Not only am I a social science
major, but I have a Y-chromosome,
ALEX LEADER-SMITH too! I tell ya, it's tough being a
straight, white male these days. So
The Prodigal Prodigy few groups out there that'll accept
you for who you are.
The Daily Gazette represents a
whole different aspect of exclusion.
There, fears of organizational espionage have led them to issue an
outright ban on my joining! Now, that's only a reasonable precaution, I'm quite sure. Who knows what I'd do with access to their
secret methods for weather-joke creation? And what if I stumbled
upon their (sometimes) prophetic source of Sharpies menus? The
editors were certainly justified in keeping me out. Unless they were
still bitter about me making their beds with duct-tape-and-Phoenix
sheets last April Fools' Day. That's always possible, too. (No, really,
it happened, I swear! It was hilarious.)
Several groups I self-select out offor ideological reasons. I won't
join Swarthmore Students Advocating Life, for instance, because
personally I advocate death. I won't join Ruach because I can't pronounce its name right. And Earthlust just sounds way too kinky for
me. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting its name, but I usually wash dirt
off of my body.
So what does that leave me? More groups than you might think.
There's still student government, several student publications and
an incredible number of open cultural organizations that I have yet
to explore. Obviously, not every club at Swarthmore is right for me,
but I haven't given up hope yet. Besides, as the student activities
Web site says, "If you do not find an organization to suit your interests, you have the opportunity to form a new one." That's still a possibility. Anyone interested in a "Survivor"-watching club?

mphruksl@swarthmore.edu

From last Thursday to Saturday, three camera

crews followed six students in their daily activities
for production of a new publicity video. The video has
sparked debate over the true image of Swarthmore
and who gets to represent it.
"It wasn't that bad or intrusive of a process," Matt
Goldstein 'O4, a participant in the project, said. "The
videographers were very cool guys and very friendly
and very easygoing. They went to classes, to activities, lunches, meetings, baseball practice, dinners,
stuff like that, Screw. I heard they were at Pub Nite. It
was pretty straightforward. They tried to disappear
into the background."
"All in all, I had a good time," Sam Graffeo 'O7 said.
"I'd do it again. It was just kind of weird having someone there all the time. The camera crew was wonderful. They understood when you wanted to shut off the
camera By the end of the first day, I got used to it.
When they shut off the camera, they were really
friendly people, so I felt comfortable around them. I
didn't feel like I was performing."
Neither Graffeo nor Goldstein felt the videographers were trying to capture any predetermined
image of Swarthmore. Goldstein praised the camera
crew for what he felt was an attempt to capture the
variety in Swarthmore students' lives. .
...

"I think their goal in following around six students was to a get a broad spectrum of what students
were doing," Goldstein said. "I think six people don't
give a complete range of what people at Swat are
doing. It can give a fairly reasonable sample. When
they were following me around, the activities I did
were pretty distinct from what the others were doing.
I think they were looking for objective samples
But I think they definitely made conscious choices
about what they were picking and what they're

bringing to the table."

Graffeo noticed that the crew took little footage of
anyone studying. "For the record, I don't think
they're trying to change the image of Swarthmore
completely," she said. "I think maybe they're trying
to lighten the image a little and dispel the idea that all
we do it sit down and study. Putting a face to the students is a good idea. I do [study], but it doesn't take up
all my time."

idea how they chose the people they did. I asked
other Hispanics and none of them got e-mails [but I
did]. That's one of the things that struck me at first."

The student, who ultimately chose not to participate, felt that a "false impression" of the school was
being given. "[The videographers] were in Essie
Mae's the other night. There was this table with
jocks, and they were interviewing them. I feel like
that's very atypical of Swarthmore, and people who
see this video are going to think 'Oh, there's jocks at
this school!' and they'll identify with that. Also,
they were videotaping Screw
they're giving people a visually false impression. They want this
school to look more 'normal' so they can attract 'normal' students. My friends who've never been to
Swat just think it's a bunch of weird people."
Other students voiced concerns over false portrayals of the college. "I just want them to make sure
they don't make us look like a bunch of parthat
tying slackers, because it's good to have a hard-core
academic image after you graduate," Dan Amato 'O7
said. "I think it's chill that people think we are iiberhard-core because we get more props that way. But
on the other hand, you don't want to scare cool peo...

ple away from applying because they think they
won't have enough fun here." Amato added that his
image of Swarthmore was different when he was in
high school. "I had no idea how much alcohol was a
part of the culture. But I like it better the more I get
to know it, though. It's a chill place. The people are
awesome."
Dawn Fraser 'O6 said that Swarthmore needs a
makeover "in that it seems non-existent to anyone
not in academia."
"I really don't think Swat is that intense, but I
know it has been for some people. I guess I'm the
exception," Fraser said. She agreed that the name
"Swarthmore" may have a negative connotation to

prospective students. The impression is "that it's
very study-oriented," she said. "I think Swat's associated with a ridiculous workload and little else, if
it's associated with anything at all. Where I came
from, nobody had even heard of it. So if by changing
their public image the administration means to create one in the first place, I can't see any harm in
that."

Gibson's 'Passion' goes over the edge
the

BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu
If you only learn one thing
from "The Passion of the Christ,"
it's that Mel Gibson is infatuated
with pain. Gibson's film, which
depicts the last 12 hours of the
life of Jesus, is so thoroughly saturated with physical trauma that
by the end it's unclear whether
the movie was meant to create a
religious revival or a desire to
vomit.

Throughout his career, Mel

by street thugs. During

his killing
rampage, Gibson was mauled by
his adversaries so often that his
character barely survived to star
in the movie's equally bloody
sequel.
In 1987, Gibson launched the
"Lethal Weapon" series by taking
the role of the tough cop Martin
Riggs. By the end of the movie,
Riggs had been shot at, beaten
into submission and electrocuted
so many times that he could barly
stand. Along with Bruce Willis'
"Die Hard," released a year later,
"Lethal Weapon" launched the
over-the-top violent action genre
that has become such a pillar of
Hollywood filmmaking for the
last two decades.
The list of Gibson's gratuitously violent movies continues. In

that, when he is brought before
Pontius Pilate (excellently played
by Hristo Naumov Shopov) in the
morning, the Roman governor
admonishes the Jews for having
beaten their prisoner before sen-

the evil ones were the English.
The internal struggles that real
people face were never important
in any of Gibson's earlier movies.

Instead, plot development only
served to bridge the gap between
gruesome, painful encounters
between the doers of good and the

doers of evil.
Since the violence of "Passion"
is so omnipresent, the need for
plot and character development
simply vanishes. Within the first
10 minutes of the movie, Jesus
(James Caviezel) is captured and
delivered to bloodthirsty Jewish
high priests. Immediately, the
beatings begin. Soldiers punch
Jesus in the face. Jews spit on
him. He is so horribly battered

After that, the beatings
become non-stop. The Jews call
for crucifixion, but Pilate doesn't
want to be responsible for the act,
so he has Jesus flogged, in the
hope that a bloody Jesus will satisfy the Jews. By the end of the
scourging, it's tough to tell where
Jesus' innards end and his outers
begin. Still, the Jews are not satisfied, and Pilate reluctantly
agrees to
Jesus' execution.
Carrying his cross, covered in
blood, barely able to walk, Jesus
receives still more beatings until
he is finally crucified. In fact, the
beatings are so severe that a normal human being would have

died several times over before
even reaching the film's painful
finale.
To be fair, Gibson's focus on
the brutal aspects of Jesus' death
was no accident. "He was wound-

ed for our transgressions, and by
his wounds we are healed,"
Gibson said in an interview with
ABC's Diane Sawyer. "That's the
point of the film." But couldn't
Gibson have explored some
other aspect of Jesus' life or his
message in this film alongside

Jesus' suffering? By not doing
so, Gibson lowers Jesus to just
another beaten hero in a Gibson
epic.
Though the over-the-top vio-

lence in "Passion" was objectionable, the real controversy surrounding the movie's release, of
course, was the portrayal of the
Jews and their role in Jesus' crucifixion. So, was the film antiSemitic? Maureen Dowd of The
New York Times summed it up
pretty well: "In 'Braveheart' and
'The Patriot,' his other emotionally

manipulative

historical

epics, you came out wanting to
swing an ax into the skull of the
nearest Englishman. Here, you
want to kick in some Jewish and
Roman teeth. And since the
Romans have melted into history ..." I, too, left "Passion" with a

slight desire to confront some

Jews. And I'm Jewish.
While the Romans are torn
over the torture of Jesus (with

the exception of those actually
partaking in the beatings), the

Jews are never affected by his
suffering. They are cold and
unforgiving. How could anyone
not dislike such a group? Of
course, once you leave the theater, you remember that the
movie took place a couple thousand years ago, in a place far, far
away. The Jews that were complicit in Jesus' crucifixion, were
only a small group of political
elites. Let's just hope that everyone who sees "Passion" remembers that, too.

Don't get us wrong. You need direction,
just not a goal. Most importantly, however,
you will enjoy the sexual experience for
what it was rather than being disappointed
for what it wasn't.
History also tells us that confidence is
an effective way to win accolades. Take
Madonna, for instance. As we see it, the
three ways to garner confidence in bed are

caring at all about your partner or prepa-

People have been having
sex since the dawn of
human existence.
That leaves us advocating preparation.
You need to be able to forget yourself in the
moment. You should feel like a god or goddess or a porn star in bed, depending on
your mood. Whatever the mood, you should
feel undeniably confident and ready. It can
be as simple as picking out lingerie, lighting
or music beforehand, all to signal to your
partner that you want to make love and to
eliminate any issues that might detract
from the sensations between you and your
partner. Black thigh-highs, garter belt and
stilettos for a hot, vigorous fuck; pretty pink
lace for slow, sensual sex and flannel for
cuddling. We don't recommend flannel.
Almost as old as the sexual act itself, is
music's involvement in it. In the words of
D'Angelo, "Music was made for love." It
sets the mood. It sets the rhythm. We
understand that there are those of us with
a very strong internal sense of rhythm.

However, that usually gets guys a quick
finish, which may not always be ideal.
Music will distract the neighbors, add to
the atmosphere, keep the guys off the
straight and narrow path to the promised
land, and maybe even keep you both coor-

dinated.

Next, along the lines of Zen, adequate
foreplay is very important. Certainly,
spontaneity is cool and all. But if the person turns you on, why not take a little
more time to appreciate him or her. At the
least, it'll ensure adequate lubrication or
a firm enough erection. The way we view
it, if sex were only for procreation, evolution would have gotten rid of our erogenous zones millennia ago. So let's take a
moment to show natural selection that we
like what it has done for us. And, like we
say in every column, communicate.
In the end, though, just relax. Sex is fun
smile, laugh, tease, tickle and compliment. It's not that serious. Granted, it's
intimate and vulnerable and should be
done responsibly. But, barring circumstances outside of the necessary precautions that one should take, in the worse
case scenario, you can do it again better.

REVIEW

"Cellar Door," John Vanderslice

(Barsuk Records, 2004)

On his fourth album in five years, indie super-producer
and inveterate nice guy John Vanderslice succeeds by doing
what he's always done, only with less intentionality. His last
two records, as frequently fantastic as they were, often felt
uncomfortably constrained by overly deliberate production,
overarching lyrical conceits (both were loosely narrative
song cycles) and their very albumness. On "Cellar Door," the
focus is unambiguously on the songs themselves, and happily so, as this is his most consistent batch of songs to date.
Each one is fully formed and self-contained, not just a part
subservient to the whole which has a terrifically liberating effect on the whole.
Although there is no overt lyrical concept, the album is
unified by recurring themes of family, memory, isolation
and mortality. Every song is sung in the first person. Each
narrator/protagonist
a prison guard, a ghost-haunted
Vietnam veteran, a
man powerless to

the loss of loved ones to diving accidents, addiction, dissois sketched with a similar
ciation, mistaken identity
detached compassion, captured perceptively hut unobtrusively in Vanderslice's economic verse.
Despite the frank tone and emotional impact, there's
something fundamentally inaccessible about most of these
characters. It's unclear (and essentially irrelevant) how
many, if any, of the songs are autobiographical, but
"Promising Actress" stands out as the most direct. Taken at
face value, it consists simply of John's musings as he tries to
make sense of David Lynch's movie "Mulholland Drive."
Lynch is an interesting, intriguing reference point. He's an
obscurantist, whereas Vanderslice explores and reveals
human emotion at its most raw and exposed, but their work

often shares a sense of abstraction.
For Vanderslice, a consummate recording-equipment
geek, this is most evident in his carefully wrought produc
tion. Reportedly the result of over 400 hours in his Tiny
Telephone studio, "Cellar Door" is characteristically
replete with layers of orchestration, sonic details anc
nuances that reveal themselves through repeated listens
Fortunately, Vanderslice is more successful than ever here
at implementing his studio wizardry to augment the emo
tional power of his songs rather than assert it distractingly
to their potential detriment. Musically, there's a greater
stylistic range here than on previous records, including
more rocking rockers
and a few touchingly
simple ballads. I can't
help but feel that John's
genuine personality is
far more evident in his
facile, winsome music
than in the rather bleak
and depraved view of
humanity conveyed in

his words he comes of
as an almost irrepress
ibly enthusiastic am
good-natured fellow in
person. Although never
snaking light of the emo-

tional content of the lyrics, and in places underscoring
their tension with marvelous effectiveness, the music
offers a reassuringly stable counterpoint to the pathos and
pain of the songs' narrators.
Despite the amount of careful consideration that clear-

ly went into creating this album, "Cellar Door" is an
impressively subtle record: unassuming, if not unaffected.
There's something almost organic in its complexity and
the expansiveness of its artfulness. In terms of art imitating life, in the best sense, this is a wonderfully effective

imitation.

John Vanderslice makes his triumphant third annual
Olde Club appearance this Sunday night. If you miss the
show here, catch him on Monday at the First Unitarian
Church in Philadelphia, where he'll join indiedom's most

Diva disasters: when artists go awry
The music business is a fast-paced, cutthroat
industry in which the age-old cliche is true: "Only the
strong survive." But what happens when those strong
elites are also prone to catastrophe? While there have
been dozens of artists that have escaped the industry
virtually unscathed, the public and media have
emphasized those who have slipped through the
cracks.
My interest in what makes female artists in par-

ticular so susceptible to hitting rock bottom stems
from a publicist's statement last week informing us

that Whitney Houston had entered drug rehabilitation. Some were disturbed by the seemingly sudden
news, while others felt it was a move long overdue in
light of her strange
behavior and talk
of a cocaine addiction.

While
Love made her home in a live-in detoxification facility
last November, it still didn't stop her from giving
David Letterman a table-top striptease and gaining yet
another criminal charge of reckless endangerment
and third-degree assault at a New York concert only a
few days ago. These ladies of music aren't the first and
probably won't be the last females who have had years

of fame and success, only to fall into downward spirals
of disaster.
One reason for these problems is the increasing
amount of pressure that exists between record companies and the artists they represent. Labels are notoriously demanding of their artists, particularly when it
comes to artistic creativity and image. Pop and rock
singer Pink once criticized L.A. Reid and Arista
Records for hindering her musical tastes and expression in her first album, the R&B-filled "Can't Take Me
Home." Jessica Simpson admitted that her record label
Columbia had encouraged her to lose weight (the
singer was 102 lbs. at the time, she told Reuters in
August 2003) and become more fashionable in the
hopes that she would join the superstar ranks offellow

March 25, 2004

young female artists like Christina Aguilera and
Britney Spears, who were racing up the charts.
Simpson's second album, "Irresistible," propelled by
her new sexy look, did just the opposite: it tanked.
Both Pink and Simpson received chances to recommit to their true selves and came out on top. Others
dealing with record company relations aren't so lucky.
R&B singer Kelis recently commented on tension and a
lack of involvement with her record label, the
Neptunes-run Star Trak. As Mariah Carey has shown
so well in the past, all that "Glitters" isn't necessarily
gold. A movie bomb and an ill-fated album to go along
with it were certainly important factors in Virgin
Records' decision to drop Carey from the label. Last
month, Mandy Moore was told her services were no
longer needed at Sony, another example of the precarious position of artists in the industry.
The sheer volume of work needed to become a successful artist is perhaps the greatest pressure on
young female artists. From press junkets to interviews to photo shoots to concert touring, there seems
to be little down time. This is precisely what drove
Carey to the hospital because of severe exhaustion. In

the same vein is the ever-looming fan and media
backlash for the actions you do publicly or in the
comforts of your own "privacy." The Dixie Chicks
and Bush, Janet's Boobgate scandal and Britney's

marriage have all stirred up ample criticism and

controversy.
Then there are the catfights. The music industry is
chock full of shallow and petty rivalries that exist for
no apparent legitimate reason (Christina Aguilera,
I'm talking to you). Sometimes it's not even limited to
individual artists. Vocal groups like Destiny's Child
and TLC have had their share of problems. Musicians
like Sheryl Crow seem to relish criticizing younger
pop counterparts as being too sexualized. Jewel even
created a parody of this issue in her music video for
"Intuition," frolicking around scantily clad in the
rain. Am I the only one who wonders what ever happened to solidarity? There's nothing wrong with
embracing your fellow female artist, even if she has a
drastically different image and audience. The women
who hold off on the criticism could gain new fans in
the process.
Recognizing this side of the business seems good
reason to consider how record industry politics and
their personal implications could render even the

most pristine artist deviant. While the industry as an
entity prides itself on being diverse and open to
change, there is still a strict system of operation in
action. How to change the structure is unbeknownst
to me. But on a campus like Swat where discussing
constructs are the norm, there is sure to be an answer

somewhere.

You're a good musical, Charlie Brown
Drama Board's student-directed Peanuts play to open on LPAC mainstage tonight
BY EMILY GASSER
egasserl@swarthmore.edu
Love. Drama. Fist-fights. Singing, dancing 5-year-olds. A dog with a Walter Mitty
complex. What more could you want in a
musical?
"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown,"
Drama Board's off-the-wall mainstage production, will fulfill all your comic strip
cravings and then some. It's Charles

Schulz's Peanuts, in all its thumb-sucking,
little-brother-slugging, baseball-game-losing, piano-playing glory, and it opens

on
the LPAC mainstage tonight.
"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown"
tries to be a living comic strip, and it succeeds. The action is set against a huge
white screen, which is lit in bright, solid
colors throughout the show, and the set is
limited to a few oversized items, like a 10foot-tall couch and Snoopy's giant doghouse. The lack of scenery forces the actors
to be exaggerated, as well, almost
but not
quite
to the point of being silly.
Cartoonish, you might say.
"There's not enough there, so you have
to amplify everything you're doing to fill
[the space]," Catharine Parnell 'O6, who
plays Lucy, said. "You think you're acting a
certain way, and then you realize it's not

big enough."
The lack of plot also lends the play its
a series of short situations, ranging in length from 10-minute
scenes to one-liners. (In one unforgettable
example of the latter type, Andrew Gregory
'O4 as Linus stares in horror at his thumb
and declares, "I think I've lost my flavor!",
then strides offstage.) These add up to a
comic-strip feel. It is

sort of day-in-the life sketch, though that
"day," as Parnell said, goes "from April
Fools' Day to Valentine's Day and back
again."

Bringing the cartoon to life was a challenge for the actors. "The difficult thing is
striking a balance between the cartoon,
which is in fact dead, and creating your
own living, breathing character," said
Adam Bisno 'O6, who plays Charlie Brown.
"You're being asked to really overplay
certain things and really ham it up," said
Allen Frost 'O4, who plays Schroeder.
Adding to the challenge was the iconic
nature of the Peanuts comics. "Because it
is an icon and it is a cartoon, we decided to
bring out the cartoonish aspects of it,"
director Kathy Liu 'O4 said. All the actors
and designers read books of Peanuts strips
to prepare for their roles, she said. Still, the
actors tried to make the characters their
own, and not just carbon copies of the originals. "You try to bring new life to something that's already predetermined,"
Parnell said. "There's more to Charlie
Brown than just the iconic moments."
Each of the characters comes through
with a strong personality. Bisno's Charlie
Brown is thoroughly endearing as he vacillates between bright-eyed hope and downright depression. Cynicism is his major

character trait, but when things go right,
he has bursts of convincingly 5-year-old
joy.
Gregory makes

an adorable Linus. He

unceasingly sucks his thumb and clings to
his blanket, but he makes sure Linus' surprising intelligence

comes across through

his baby antics. During the Peter Rabbit
book report song, while Lucy composes
sentences like "The other people's name
was MacGregor," Linus' essay reads like a
good Swarthmore English paper: "In this
report, I plan to discuss the sociological
implications of family pressures so great as
to drive an otherwise moral rabbit to perform acts of thievery ..." Acting as Linus is
"invigorating," Gregory said. "Playing a

Snoopy (Evan Buxbaum) pursues the Red Baron from the top of his dog house

cartoon character also gives you an incredible amount of leeway to really release
your inner extrovert."
As Lucy, Parnell is loud, obnoxious and
infuriating, just as she should be. Parnell
described her character as "a 7-year-old
girl with something of a temper and a god
complex. No, it's more of a queen mentality than a god complex." For Parnell, making Lucy so forceful was a challenge. "The
screaming at people and punching them
repeatedly is not part of my character,"
she said. "I'm trying not to fit Lucy inside
the Catharine box." She has succeeded in
taking Lucy past her own comfort level,
and the result isn't always pleasant for the
audience, but that is intentional. "I'm
almost purposely singing off-key," she
said. "It's supposed to sound somewhat
like nails on a chalkboard, and it fits
musically."

Lauren lanuzzi's 'O7 version of Sally, in
her words, is "a total drama queen." She
tried to make her Sally different from the

character in the comic strip. "The physical

contrast between my Sally and Charles
Schulz's Sally, I think, gives me more freedom to add little quirks and idiosyncrasies
to the character," she said. "I tried to make
her into someone I could relate to more.
I'm pretty much a cartoon character in real
life, as well, so it wasn't much of a stretch
to play one on the stage."

Schroeder is one of the characters about
whom the audience has the fewest expectations, which is one of the things Frost liked
about playing the part. He's also the most
sober character on stage. "I'm sort of the
one character who doesn't have a neurosis," Frost said. "I don't suck my thumb all
the time, I'm not crazy like Lucy." Still,
Frost said, "It's really demanding."
The best part of the show is Snoopy,

one is? Buxbaum’s costume is minimal,
just white pants and a white shirt with a

no elaborate

be best to bring out his human aspect.
“Snoopy is really human,” she said. “He

doesn’t speak to anybody else, but they
speak to him, and he understands all of
them.”

“It’s kind of hard to be a dog,”
Buxbaum said. “It’s kind of tough to balance walking around and crouching
down.” The Snoopy he came up with is
believable and entertaining, mixing his
lines and singing with an occasional wellplaced bark or howl. It’s fun to watch him
go back and forth between complete lack of
interest in the humans on stage, to rapture

at the thought of his food, to whipping out

a pair of shades and singing “Suppertime,”
a laid-back, cool jazz song about the joys of
eating.
Just because the show is based on a

strip as G-rated as Peanuts, don’t expect it
to be all sweetness and sunshine. While the
script

does

have

its

slightly

sappy

moments, there’s more to it than that.
“There are touching things about it, there
are funny things about it, there are downright mean, sarcastic things about it,”

Parnell said.
“It’s a very striking

piece of work,”
Bisno said. “This show is liberating, for
cynical people in particular, because we get
to lean into the cliches and come out with
something really out there.”

Inflating woes
Within the Swarthmore community, grade inflation
shouldn't be a problem.
As long as we're learning and being challenged, it
shouldn't matter that the grades one professor uses to
evaluate students' work are on a. higher scale than another professor's, since Swarthmore is supposed to be about
individual learning and not competitive achievement.
But these ideals don't carry over into the outside
world. Unfortunately, our grades do. Grad schools and

employers, not to mention fellowship and scholarship
committees, set high bars based on grade point averages
in order to select the best candidates from increasingly
qualified applicant pools, and it's often difficult for them
to know how to take a high grade that may reflect the
same level of competence as a lower grade from another
school, department or professor.
Schools that consciously decide to index their grades
higher and higher each semester have exacerbated this
problem, leading to scandals such as Harvard's. There,
extreme grade inflation, with 91 percent graduating with
honors, makes comparing grades or honors status across
time almost meaningless and the honors designation
greatly misleading. These policies may temporarily pump
up the rates at which their students get considered for
awards and grad school admissions. But they not only
erode what real value grades actually have for students to
evaluate their achievement, they also unfairly punish
schools that attempt to stabilize their grading practices.
Grad schools struggle to adjust their criteria to
increasing GPAs they see, complicating their evaluation
processes as they create byzantine and inevitably flawed
grade deflation standards. Also, the compression of
grades into the upper levels, forcing A's to compete with
A-minuses rather than B's and C's, reduces professors'
options when making grading decisions. It also makes
students more likely to gravitate toward professors who
are easy graders or classes where it's harder to fail.
Our professors thus face conflicting pressures. If we
play ball and push our average GPAs up just as fast as the
most competitive schools are doing, then we only make
the problem worse. But if we hang back and try to keep
our system stable, we put Swarthmore students at an
unfair disadvantage.
Grade inflation is a symptom and a contributing cause
of the overemphasis on quantitative grading in schools.
As a nationwide problem, responsible educators ought to
oppose it. On an individual school level, there are no easy
choices for how to respond to the unfair standards it creates. We encourage our administrators and faculty to
attempt to strike a balance between remaining competitive with other schools and staying free and fair with our

own standards.

No question that sniper deserves execution

Hart also brings ethnicity into the picture, noting there
was a chance Muhammad might not have received the death
penalty had he not been black. This argument is absolutely
ludicrous. Right up until the moment he and Lee Malvo were
caught, the general consensus was that the sniper was a
white male, and even then, without knowing who was
behind the attacks, everybody wanted to see the killer
caught, tried and executed. If Hart had bothered to look at
death penalty statistics, perhaps he would have known that
the majority of people put to death by our legal system are in
fact white; the racial argument is a poor one.
The death penalty is a necessary end to an unthinkable
evil, and it is used not only as punishment but also as a
deterrent. Though I am pleased Muhammad will be executed, I feel I can speak for many back home when I say that it
is a shame Virginia does not use the firing squad; this would
have ensured that Muhammad is put to death in the same
manner that he killed.

Dear Editor,

Patrick Hart 'O6 was dead wrong last week in writing that
sniper John Allen Muhammad should not receive the death
penalty. While I understand that Hart was making a general
argument against the death penalty, his choice of
Muhammad as the poster boy for his argument was poor
taste. Although I personally believe the death penalty has a
place in our society, the Muhammad case hits close to home.
I live half a mile from the much-publicized Home Depot
shooting where Muhammad murdered FBI agent Linda
Franklin. I get my hair cut 50 yards from the site of the
shooting. My mom and sisters go to Starbucks several times
a week a mere 30 yards from the site. When I saw on the
news that a late-40-something woman was killed at that
shopping center, I briefly panicked until I called home and
heard my mom's voice.
Hart is oblivious to the constant fear that the hundreds of
thousands of people in the Washington, D.C. region experienced during the sniper attacks. Running to and from the
car on the way to work. Ducking or even lying on the ground
while pumping gas. The thought of knowing a brutal killer

Rewards of being EMT overlooked
Dear Editor:
We are writing in response to the article published last
week on the "dearth of EMTs." We very much appreciated
The Phoenix taking notice of this issue. However, as people
who were interviewed and quoted, we felt the article left
out part of the story. There was an overemphasis on how
much time was involved with being an EMT and very little
mention of what a rewarding experience it is. The EMT
class itself is time-consuming, but no more so than participating in something like a sport. Being on call is a lot of
hours on paper, but in practice is not a difficult thing at all.
The station offers places to study, places to sleep, computers, a TV, a kitchen and interesting people. And plenty of EMTs don't spend all their on-call time in the station, but hang out in McCabe or their rooms while they
are on call.
While there is a good deal of time involved, the experience is an overwhelmingly positive one. For starters, the
community that exists at the firehouse is great. The people
become like family, and the friendships made there are
March 25, 2004

often maintained well beyond students' graduation. And,
of course, there is the amazing experience of being an
EMT. It is an experience unlike any other you are going to
have at Swarthmore. It is the excitement of never entirely
knowing what will happen when you get to a call, the
assurance of knowing what to do about the situation
you're presented with, and the satisfaction of seeing that
what you are doing is actually helping someone.
It is also learning and doing something that has immediate practical application, an experience that is refreshingly different in the Swat world of academia. The
combination of doing something in the real world, that the
something is exciting and that it has the possibility of
changing someone's life is indescribable.
Somewhere between the elderly woman who just needed someone to hold her hand and talk to her and riding the
stretcher doing chest compressions, we have managed to
find it worth our while to put in the time to be an EMT.

Digital image databases like Corbis (not to mention the proliferation of digital cameras) make it incredibly easy to find

While it's deplorable that people would use Photoshop to
make a photo they then pass off as real in order to discredit
someone, there's more to this issue than simple ethics. It
brings out a responsibility on the part of us readers to use
skepticism when viewing photographs and on the part of programmers to find a way to prevent this again. The Digimarc
system, a means of watermarking digital image files irrevocably, helps considerably, but a more reliable and powerful
system is now needed.
Meanwhile, however, Photoshop is an extremely cool program, and I urge you to play around with it if you haven't
(since you can get a copy for free off the network). It's a program that's generally useful enough to be worth knowing,
and there are all sorts of neat things that can be done with it

the West Bank and Gaza, tens of
thousands of Palestinians have taken to the streets in
mourning and protest. They mourn the death of a man

whose stated goal was the death of innocent Jews in
Israel and beyond. By participating in these demonstrations, these Palestinians demonstrate support for
continuted violence and reinforce the necessity of
Israel to protect itself with all available means.
The real travesty, however, is that Yasser Arafat
declared that the Palestinian Authority would officially mourn Yassin's death for three days. The pseudo-government with which Israel is expected to negotiate peace has thus made Yassin's de facto martyr status official. Arafat himself condemned "the crime of
assassinating the hero-martyr Ahmed Yassin." Given
this willingness to glorify a man who shamelessly
took innocent civilian lives, Arafat's position as a
leader of the Palestinian people hardly seems reasonable. Specifically, his role as a party to peace cannot
be legitimate if peace is the true goal of the
Palestinians.
In the midst of this
situation, Hamas has not
forgotten
about
the
United States. It has
implicated the United
States in Yassin's assassination and has stated
that it "has to bear the
consequences
of this
crime." It is of great concern that a murderous terrorist group is willing to retaliate against the United
States for the sovereign actions of an American ally.
We may sadly have to wait for a bus bombing in New
York City before we do more than brush aside such
comments as empty threats.
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was a powerful terrorist. He
founded and led an organization that imposed misery
and suffering upon thousands of innocent people.
Though it is unfortunate that Yassin is now a permanent martyr for the Palestinian people, it is for the
greater good that Israel takes the lives of those
responsible for the death of Israeli civilians. In the
end, the world is a better place in Yassin's absence.

Force on Monday.
It is worth noting that
this was not the first Israeli
attempt on Yassin's life. In
September of 2003, an
Israeli F-16 dropped a small
bomb on a building containing Yassin and other
Hamas leaders. The bomb was 250 kilograms, powerful enough only to destroy the upper floor of the building. Had a 1,000-kilogram bomb been used, Yassin's
death would have been guaranteed. This was a conscious decision, however, by the Israeli government to
do all it could to minimize civilian casualties in the

area.

This decision by Israel stands in grave contrast to
Yassin's monstrosities. Israel made an explicit effort
to preserve Palestinian civilian life, whereas Yassin
spent more than 15 years doing all he could to massacre Israeli civilians. One wonders how many innocent lives would have been saved were Yassin successfully eliminated six months earlier.

Top 10 highlights of the winter
BY ALEX RYAN-BOND
aryanbol@swarthmore.edu
As the weather grows warm and Parrish Beach greens,
our spring athletes take to the field to begin conference
play this week. But before saying goodbye to our winter
sport athletes, it's time to recap some memorable performances of the winter. So sit back, throw on the Sportscenter
theme song and pretend I'm Stuart Scott as we count them
down.
10. Swimmers take fourth place at Conferences,
first place fashion contest. Starting the list is the swim
team, which garnered a fourth-place finish at the
Centennial Conference championships this season, with
the men advancing four swimmers to the finals of the 200
breaststroke. Despite its finish, the swim team placed first
in our hearts with their fashion sense, dying their hair
blue and cutting it into mohawks before shaving it all off
before the big weekend. Good luck (and better fashion
sense) next year.
9. Women's

basketball doubles up on hapless
Haverford. Next on the countdown is women's basketball, who earn the number-nine spot by doubling conference rival Haverford's score in their final home game of
the season, demolishing the Fords 84-42. Katie Robinson
'O4 shot the lights out with a season high 31 points against
a Haverford team which was powerless to stop her, and
Radiance Walters 'O6 contributed 10 points of her own to
the Garnet blow out.
8. 2:34 to glory. This spot in our top 10 goes out to
swimmer Wootae Min 'O7 and his chase of the American
dream. In late February the plucky first-year took a dare
from friend Adam Wallwork 'O7 and me that he couldn't
run two laps around Clothier Field in under 2:34, an arbitrary but challenging time. Men's lacrosse, indoor track
and DU watched when Min attempted the feat. He started

16

strong, finishing his first lap in 1:20 before struggling on
his last lap despite the spirited coaching of Ryan "Porno"
Pannorfi 'O4 and Darshan Patel 'O5. The duo helped the
finely tuned athlete across the finish line in 3:15, earning
him a trip to Wallwork's room for some spring cleaning.
Tough luck, buddy.
7. Basketball hits its shots from waaaayyy
Downtown! This moment goes out to two players on
men's basketball, Jacob Letendre 'O4 and Chris Casey 'O7,
who proved half-court shots do happen in real life.

Letendre's bucket came against McDaniel as he tossed a
3/4 court alley-oop to Jeff Maxim 'O7 which found its way
into the hoop in what was this winter's best "I meant to do
that... honestly" moment. Casey's bomb from beyond half
court came against Gettysburg at the tail end of the season,
bringing the team to within two in the final seconds
against the Bullets
but it wasn't enough to push the
team into the playoffs.
6. Men's basketball guts one out in double OT.
Basketball continues its run on our countdown with the
number-six spot for its performance against Washington
College over winter break, pulling a double OT win against
the Shoremen 101-97. Matt Gustafson 'O5 scored a career
high 35 points with 17 rebounds, and Maxim dropped e
career-high 28 with 17 boards to lead the Garnet Tide. To
top it all off, the performance garnered Gustafson Player of

the Week Honors.
5. Badminton sends players to nationals. Kicking
off the top five moments in the winter season is badminton, which surged through the Northeast Region to
send Candice Cherk 'O7 and Anjali Aggarwal 'O6 to nationals. The team surprised everybody by proving that there
even was a national collegiate badminton tournament.
4. Jacob Letendre, stud. The men's basketball co-captain had a record breaking year, earning him the number
four spot in our countdown. Letendre brought his A game

March 25, 2004

all season and in the process rewrote several pages of
Swarthmore's record books. Letendre set Garnet records
for steals with 156 pockets picked, assists (354 dishes) and
also recorded a triple double in the win against
Washington College, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds and
10 assists. Happy trails, Jacob.
3. Garrett Ash 'O5 smokes the record book and the
competition better than Snoop Dogg ever could. The runner was phenomenal this season as he demolished school
records on his way to the Centennial Conference championships. Ash set the school record in the 3,000 with a time
of 8:40.40, as well as earning twin silver medals in the 3,000
and 5,000 at the Centennial Conference Championship
Meet. To summarize: He's fast.
2. Matt Gustafson: Straight ballin' out of control.
Arguably one of the Centennial Conferences best players,
Gustafson was named to the 2004 All-Conference First
team on the strength of his 19.5 ppg average, 48 three-pointers and 77.8 percent shooting from the charity stripe.
Gustafson also tallied 487 points on the season, moving
him to 1,231 on his career, which was good for the sixth
spot on Swarthmore's all-time scoring list.
1. Katie Robinson, best of the best. Nearly everything has been said about this Garnet superstar. Not only
was she named player of the year twice in her career, the
First Team All-Conference selection finishes her
Swarthmore career with an impressive line: 420 steals
(record holder in the Centennial Conference), 86.7 percent from the free-throw line, 281 assists (third all-time),

1,652 points (third all-time), 57 three-pointers (fourth alltime), and 728 rebounds (fifth all-time). Leading her team
to an 80-31 record during her tenure, Robinson, also a
D3Hoops.com first team All-American, is truly a legend.
She will be sorely missed not only for her athletic
contributions but also for her outstanding character and
leadership.

Women's rugby pounds Penn in season opener

The women's rugby team tackled
Division II opponent University of
Pennsylvania on Saturday with a score of

Sachs 'O7 is starting to kick for the team

Swarthmore held Penn scoreless for
the remainder of the game, ending in victory for the Tide.

12-5. Saturday's match opened the spring

season for the team.
Within the first 10 minutes, Penn
jumped ahead, scoring the first try of the
game and earning five points.
"It was a little discouraging, since it
was the first game, and we had played
good defense up until that point. We just
broke down for a second, but we still had
it together. We were definitely playing as

well, if not better, than [Penn]," tri-captain
Emily Rhoades 'O4 said.
With a couple of minutes left before the
end of the first half, Rhoades scored
Swarthmore's first try, evening out the
score 5-5. Anna Leach 'O6 would have
scored a try in the first half had she not
been tripped by a Penn player. The foul
led to a penalty against Penn. Assisted by
Leach and scored by Kristin Davis 'O6, the
second try for Swat put the team ahead of
Penn, 10-5, halfway through the second

half.

Co-captain Kirsten Vannice 'O4 then
converted the kick for two extra points to
set the score at 12-5. Vannice does most of
the kicking for the team, although Jane

"The refs were calling a lot of things

They stepped it up and did a great job with
such adversity," Rhoades said.
"It was a good game, even though the
fields were muddy," Davis said. "It was

A couple ofminor injuries were treated
after both games, although "injuries are

later, Cleaver put in his first goal of the
game to push the lead to 2-0.
Patience on offense was the key for the
Garnet. "We ran the game plan,"
McKenna said. "We went out there and
possessed the ball and kept the offensive
flow."
The Valiants fought back, beating
goalie Steven Isbister 'O4 for the first and
only time in the half just before the nineminute mark of the first quarter. Joe
DiSimone 'O4 responded for the Garnet
with his first goal of the afternoon just
over 30 seconds later. The Tide continued
on to score the final seven goals of the half
to head into the break with a 9-1 advantage.
The onslaught continued after halftime, as the Garnet put four straight
goals in the back of the net to take a 13-1
lead in the third quarter. Tim Chryssikos

day, increasing his total to a team-high 15

Swarthmore. He is the team's leading
scorer with 11 markers on the season.
Cleaver's hat trick improved his season
total to nine goals, while McKenna's
upped his season tally to eight.
Isbister had nine saves in a strong performance in net for the Tide. The
Manhattanville offense did not threaten
often, but when they did, he was up to the
challenge. The defense also played well in
front of him. The Garnet cleared the ball
successfully on 26 out of 29 attempts,
including going a perfect 15-for-15 during
the first half.
"It was a good clearing day on
defense," coach Pat Gress said.
The Garnet's 16 goals were a seasonhigh. Coughlin, Paul Chung 'O5, Jeff
Donlea 'O5, Gavin Nurick 'O7, Matt Perez
'O6 and John Williams 'O6 all tallied goals
to round out the scoring for Swarthmore.
"We played well offensively. We pos-

sessed the ball well and got layup shots.
We also put most of shots on net," coach
Gress said. "The clearing and the shooting accuracy were the two keys."
After a tough start to the season,
including a loss to number-16 Stevens
Institute of Technology, the Garnet have
won two in a row, albeit against softer
competition. "We've been slowly getting
better and better each game," Coughlin
said. "We really wanted to beat Stevens

A timely goodbye
They imploded Veterans Stadium last Sunday morning a
seven o'clock. I didn't watch it. I was asleep. It takes more
than a collapsing stadium to get me up at that hour.
I've only been there twice, and I've never thought much
of it as a stadium. But I have seen some sights there, yes,
have. The two words that come to mind first are "sublime'
and "ridiculous," but I think
they're both woeful under
statements. I think the words
I really want are "sacred'
and "profane."

Luckily for him I took the high road and got the hell out of
there. To this day, that game is the only one I've willingly left
early. I don'tknow why I ever went to see the Phillies again.
But I did. The very next April. I was jonesing for basebal
again, and I saw the Giants were coming to town for the late
weekend in April. I figured I might as well see Barry Bonds
before his head exploded, so my girlfriend and I headed off to
the Sunday afternoon game, in which Kevin Millwood hap
pened to be pitching. This day was sunny and 70s, perfect for
baseball. Once again my cheapness prevailed, and we were
back in the 700s, this time behind home plate. I hadn't known
beforehand, but this game happened to be the 25th birthday
of the Phillie Phanatic, and the entire Delaware Valley mas
cot community had come out to celebrate. The day was a
blast before a pitch had even been thrown.
And then Kevin Millwood went to work. He walked the
first batter and then proceeded to retire the next 11, before
allowing another walk. By the sixth inning people began to
realize that the Giants had yet to record a hit off of Millwood
who was looking stronger with each pitch. An eerie calm
began to fall over the stadium for each pitch, followed by a
roar when the Giant batter would invariably ground to short
or fly out to left. When Marquis Grissom sent one screaming
to deep center to lead off the seventh you could see the horror
on every fan's face, only to then see it all explode into joy as
Phillies' center fielder Ricky Ledee made a sprawling catch
After Barry Bonds struck out to end the top of the seventh, no
fan sat for the rest of the game. When Marquis Grissom came
up again with two outs in the ninth, the Giants still hitless
the air in the stadium was positively electric. Every fan was
absorbed in his or her own world of nervous tension, each
beseeching Kevin Millwood for release. And release came in
the form of a lazy fly ball settling once again into the glove of
Ricky Ledee. And then the crowd went wild.
In the end, I'm kind of glad to see the Vet go. I didn't experience it often, but I don't think I needed to. I don't see how
anything else could live up to what I've already seen there
This way, in my mind, the Vet's gone out in style. Two
games. Sublime and ridiculous. Sacred and profane. Heaven
and hell. I don't think I could have asked for anything else
from it.

during spring break to get a leg up on the competition.
In Jacksonville, the runners took on the wild swamp
trails where days earlier a Fort Wayne University runner was attacked by a wild boar. At the conclusion of the
trip, the Tide participated in the prestigious Florida
A&M relays. Aside from keeping an eye on the boars,
the team benefited from the trip.
"It was a relaxing way to train and get to know each
other," Nicole Oberfoell 'O7 said. "It was a fun way to

bring us together."
At Florida A&M, the team competed against a plethora of schools, mostly consisting of Division I schools
including Florida A&M, Grambling State, Albany State
and Holy Cross. The team posted many individual feats

as well as personal bests.
Matt Williams 'O4 rose up for the competition, tying
his personal best in the 110-meter high hurdles. He nearly reached his personal best in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles, taking seventh place with a time of 57.19 and
beating out two runners from powerhouse Grambling
State. The men's distance medley, consisting of James
Golden 'O5, Keefe Keeley 'O6, Vernon Chaplin 'O7 and
Tyler Lyson 'O6, was very competitive in the meet taking
fourth place."
"Vernon had a very good leg in the distance-medley.
We were sixth or seventh, and his leg really got us back
in the ballgame," coach Peter Carroll said.
Chaplin, whose 800-meter leg of the relay was a personal best 1:57.4, felt that, although the relay finished
better in winter conferences, fourth was a solid finish,

conditions.
Sean Anderson 'O6 had a strong meet, posting a personal best in the 400-meter dash with a time of 59.76.
Alex Elkins 'O6 was also a standout for the men's squad,
as he was forced to fill in on several races he was unaccustomed to.
On the women's side, Njideka Akunyili 'O4 posted a
time of 11:26.78 to finish 12th in her first career 3,000meter run. In the feel-good story of the trip, runnerturned-assistant coach Laura Feeney finished a
remarkable second place in the 3,000-meter run with a
time of 10:39.70, beating out runners from all attending
schools except South Alabama. Oberfoell, running in
her first 1,500-meter run, also had a strong performance. She finished with a time of 5:33.82, coming in at
considering the

10th place.

Many on the team felt the trip was perfect for taking
their minds off the academic pressures of Swarthmore
and focus on running.
"It was great to be around the team and it is a lot easier to motivate yourself over break. We went on some
nice trails. It was a good training environment,"
Chaplin said.
"It was a great mental break, and weather-wise it is
so nice to be able to come off of the indoor season and get
a nice week without having to worry about anything but
getting sunburned," coach Carroll said.
While coach Carroll does not expect to see the full
benefits of the trip for a couple weeks, he expects the
distance runs through the swamps of Florida will help
the team overcome the lingering fatigue from the indoor
track season.
"We did a lot of endurance stuff to recharge the batteries. That way, when we start doing the speed work
again, we won't be stale," coach Carroll said.
The Tide will compete in the Widener Quad Meet
Saturday at 10 a.m.

Softball extends streak
The Softball team extended its winning
streak to three last night with a victory over
the University of the Sciences, 10-4.
Starting pitcher Emily Remus 'O6 and
Marianne Klingaman 'O7 were solid against the
Sciences offense. Although the Garnet was
behind twice during the contest, the team rallied back with hit after hit, slowly taking over
the lead. Val Marpne 'O5 felt the win was a boost
of confidence for the team. She acknowledged
the depth of the squad as a huge factor in the
win.
"Everyone produced in the lineup," she
said. "This is the First year that has been a
strong point for us."
"Coming back from two deficits and
innings, we have a strong enough hitting to
know that we don't have to give up early on in
the game," Marone said. "It'll allow us to take
on more difficult opponents with more confidence."

Up close and personal with Matt Goldstein
BY CARLTON DAVIS

cdavisl@swarthmore.edu

This week we take another in-depth look at one of
Swarthmore's leading athletes, baseball player Matt
Goldstein 'O4. Last year Matt enjoyed fine success on the
field, being named the Conference Player of the Week
and Pitcher of the Week on separate occasions. Arguably
the team's top pitcher with an electric fastball, devastating change-up, and sharp curve, Matt is also one of the
team's top hitters. Though off to a slower start than he
would have liked this year due to recovery from a torn
rotator cuff suffered last season, Goldstein promises to
have another stellar year on the field.
What makes this baseball co-captain tick? The
Phoenix sent columnist Carlton Davis to find out.
However, Goldstein was unable to meet for his scheduled
interview. In his place he sent fellow co-captain Ryan
Pannorfi' 04 with some canned answers.

So, Matt, where are you from?

Well, Carlton, I am from Hillsborough, Calif, and

attended high school at Crystal Springs, where I was a
three-sport varsity athlete. See, most people don't know
that about me. They just think I'm this stud pitcher who
wins all these awards and always has my picture hanging in the field house.
But there is more to me than that. See, I have this
killer outside jump shot and I can run cross country with
the best of them. One time in high school, I dated this girl
who was a hella cross-country runner. You see, hella is a
Cali word and I think more people on the East Coast
should use that. Anyways back to my story. She went to
Notre Dame on some cross-country scholarship, but my
times were always better than hers.
Why did you go from a warm weather climate to this
frigid school?
No one knows where it is. That's my big thing about
Swat. You ever try to pick up a girl and tell her you go to
Swat? She gives you a weird look and asks why you go to
an all girls school. Anyway, so about leaving the tropical
paradise of Cali to come to this state, well, you see, I
always wanted to visit the East Coast. The hardest part
for me leaving was to distance myself from my family.
Me and my sister Sparks are really tight. She's a sophomore in high school and I consider her one of my best
friends. But the academic rigors of Swat are what
intrigued me. Personally, I strive to be the best in everything that I do. And for me, I guess Swat was just the

move for several days. Do you feel any added pressure to be perfect being the new poster boy for
Swarthmore College?
Nah, I'm used to pressure. I've been handling pressure situations my entire life. Sports has really taught
me to remain calm and focused. And I would hardly consider myself the poster boy of Swat. That's really just a
stigma that some of my buddies have placed on me.

You played soccer your first year here. Why did you
give that up?
I decided to quit the team because it was just too much
of a commitment, one that I knew in my heart I could not
make. But I just couldn't make the time commitment to
the soccer team that I felt would be necessary to excel. If
I stayed on the team and didn't give 100 percent, well
then that wouldn't be fair to me or my teammates. But as
for now, I can honestly say that I have no regrets about
hanging up my cleats, recycling my shin guards, and
walking away from soccer. It has given me considerable
time to concentrate on my studies and baseball.
You suffered an injury on the last day of the season
last year. Are you fully recovered, and does the injury

ever cross your mind out on the mound?
Well, the injury I suffered last year was very traumatic. I lost consciousness for a few minutes, but that
was my fault because I forgot to call the ball in the outfield. I collided with my right fielder and broke his jaw, I
should have just let him fly in and make the

diving grab.
When I'm on the mound however, I don't
really think about the injury, although I do
feel the aftermath and side effects considering
that I am pitching with a torn rotator cuff this
season. The injury is nagging but this is my
last year of organized sports. I can't leave anything on the table.

It has been widely rumored that you give
girls a Swarthmore baseball sweatshirt the
morning after. Care to comment on these

What are you studying?
I am an honors biology major with minors in history
and foreign languages. I like to focus on the Romance
languages, such as Italian, French and Portuguese. I plan
on enrolling in a M.D./Ph.D. program.
Recently a professional film crew followed your every

Details. If you don't notice, then they won't either.

What goes through your head right before you pitch?

You've often been unhittable out there on the mound.
What's your secret?
Right before I pitch, I like to recite Rudyard Kipling's
poem "If in my head. I often find myself relating stanza's in the poem to moments in the game.

If you could wish for three things, what would they
be?

Lastly, what are your plans after graduation?
I rely on my looks to get by while I'm at Swat. Why
should I change when I get out?

accusations?

That's just plain phooey. I was dating a certain sweet basketball player last year and I
loaned her my sweatshirt during the winter
months, because that's the kind of guy I am.
And now she won't give me my sweatshirt
back and she always wears it around campus,
and so rumors circulate. I prefer taking the
girl out to a nice breakfast, Java Joe's, perhaps, then bringing them up to the Science
Center so I can sit down and engage her in
conversation. That's crucial to me. I don't
care how attractive, athletic or smart a female
is. If she doesn't engage me in conversation,
then I'm out.
