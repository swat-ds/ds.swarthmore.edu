Hallowell RA BoHeeYoon, left, speaks to Student Council Tuesday night as College Budget Committee representative Marvin Barron
listens. Yoon, selected as a Worth RA for next year, said she is concerned about the racial balance of RAs in Wharton next year.

Student says next year's
Wharton RAs not diverse
By Rachel Labush
Phoenix Staff
The racial profile of Wharton's RAs
for next year is under scrutiny after testimony at the open mic portion of Tuesday night's Student Council meeting
brought the issue to light. Several students called for an immediate reexamination of the selection process and reappointment of some RAs after no students ofcolor were offered RA positions
in Wharton.
At Tuesday's meeting, BoHee Yoon 'Ol
sparked discussion on what Student
Council member Matt Schwartz 'Ol
called "far and away the single biggest
issue" that SC has dealt with this semester: whether the Deans should change
the RA appointments, and what role Student Council should have in the decisionmaking process.
Yoon, currently an RA in Hallowell
and selected as an RA for Worth next
year, came to the meeting armed with
statistics: Wharton has more RAs —nine
than any other dorm, and 20 percent
of all freshmen live there. This year,
each section has one RA of color.
In contrast with Wharton, Willets,
which also houses many freshmen, will
have three RAs of color out of a total of
seven.
Yoon argued that, given that 45 per-

3

percent
increase in fees each year, it could not approve all
of the increase to $257 students had asked for.

Earlier workday
being considered
for cleaning staff

Employees of Environmental Services
may soon have to report as early as 4 a.m.,
as a joint committee of staff and administrators is considering changing the workers' schedules to make their labor more
efficient.
Most Environmental Services employees currently report at 6 a.m. and leave at
2:30 p.m., but Facilities Management administrators are concerned that the presence of faculty and staff in college buildings during much of this time inhibits the
employees' ability to clean effectively.
"The driving issue there is that it's difficult for someone to clean when I'm sitting in my office," said Larry Schall, vice
president for facilities and services.
Director of Facilities Management Stu
Hain added cost as another reason for
change. Although other issues must be
considered, he said, "We do know that we
can be more cost effective cleaning when
buildings are empty."
The ad hoc committee, which was
formed two years ago to address a variety of issues facing Environmental Services and has since been working with an
outside consultant, is comprised of seven
ES employees, the four ES supervisors, ES
Director Sarah Porter and Hain. The committee first considered replacing the current shift with a number of earlier and
later alternatives several weeks ago.
Among the alternative shift options introduced at that meeting were two that would
mean multiple shifts and one that would
move the current universal shift back to
begin at 4 a.m. and end at 12:30 p.m.
Although discussion of change is still in
a very preliminary stage, many employees are alarmed at the unaccomodating
hours of this last prospect and concerned
about the problems that all of the changes
could cause in terms of child care and
transportation. They are meeting independently to consider how to address the possible changes.
"I can't see myself coming out here that
early in the morning," said an ES employee serving on the committee who requested not to be identified
by name.
when asked whether a 4 a.m. report time
would pose problems for other Environmental Services workers, she responded
emphatically, "Yes, [it would be] very
nard. Very hard."
Schall dismissed the probability of the
most controversial option being implemented, however. "I don't know where 4

came from," he said. "There's no

cent of Swarthmore students are nonwhite, the current RA assignments

mean that a large proportion of
Wharton students will not have access
to an RA of color with whom they could
purportedly best identify. "I have a big
problem with that," said Yoon, "and I
think a lot of people have a problem with
that."
Drawing a parallel to the gender distribution of RAs, Yoon pointed out that
college policy requires RAs to be allotted evenly by gender in each dorm, so
that students will always have an RA of
the gender they are most comfortable
with available to address their concerns.
Similarly, she thinks that it is important
for students, especially freshmen, to
have access to an RA of color somewhere in their dorms. "The fact that AB
and EF do not have any RAs of color is
not OK," said Yoon, because the two
wings both house many freshmen.
Student Council members questioned
Yoon on some of the specific aspects of
her complaint. Louisa Whitfield-Smith
'O2 asked why Yoon was not concerned
that Mary Lyon has had no RAs of color
for the past two years. Yoon responded
by saying that freshmen of color are
rarely placed in Mary Lyon because
they would feel isolated from the sup-

SAF increase not as high
as requested by SBC, SC
By Nathan Ashby-Kuhlman
Phoenix Staff
The Student Activities Fee,
which Student Budget Committee and StudentCouncil proposed
be $257 next academic year, will
only be increased to $250. The
College Budget Committee and
the Board of Managers trimmed
$7 from the SAF to avoid an increase in next year's total fees of
more than 4.1 percent relative to
this year's.
Normally, the CBC and BOM
approve in full the increases the
student committee asks for.
"Usually, it's a fairly simple process," said Student Budget Committee treasurer Laura Farra 'Ol.
"We say we want the $6 for inflation and in five minutes it's approved."
But this year the requested increase, because it was so large,
ran up against the upper limit of
4.1 percent specified in Board of
Managers policy, according to
Vice President for Finance and
Planning Paul Aslanian. Even
with the reduction to $250, the
total fees for next year tuition,
room, boardand the SAF —make
an increase of 4.146 percent over
last year's level, just barely
rounding down to within the requirement.
Aslanian said because the College Budget Committee was only
expecting a SAF ofabout $235 for
next year, fees for room and
board had to be reduced slightly
to even raise the SAF to $250.
Aslanian said the change in those
fees was insignificant and would
not impact other aspects of the
college's budget.
Student Budget Committee's
request for a $257 SAF, approved
by Student Council, was an increase of $3l over this year's
level of $226. Most of the requested increase $25 would
have gone toward replenishing
the funding in the Student Budget Committee's capital replacement account. Farra said that
account, depleted through recent
purchases, needs additional income over the next few years to

prepare for when the newly purchased equipment will need repair or replacement.
As a result, the committee approved an increase to the SAF of
$25 plus $6 for inflation for next
year, with an additional increase
of $2O plus inflation the following year. All of that money would
have gone toward the capital replacement account, with no increase other than inflation in
money for student activities.
But with the SAF only at $250
next year, the Student Budget
Committee will lose over $9,000
that wouldhave gone to the capital replacement account, according to Farra. She said the full increase in the SAF could have
been approved by the administration had the student recommendation been made earlier.
That did not happen, she said,
because she was new to the treasurer job and because the much
larger than normal increase necessitated time to gauge student
opinion.
According to Aslanian, it would
have been easier for the college
to accommodate the SAF request
if it had been made before winter break this year.
Farra said that next year she
hopes to have the SAF funding
request made much earlier and
approved in full, which would,
over time, allow the capital replacement account to be replenished to the needed level with
little ill effect.

Ex-gay speaker's visit opens dialogue
By Jessica Sonnenschein
and Mara Hvistendahl
Phoenix Staff
Despite earlier discussion of
protest, the visit of ex-gay minister Richard Yates two weeks
ago became an opportunity for
open dialogue between members
of the queer and Christian communities. Although Yates offended some, the event itself
proved to be conciliatory rather
than antagonistic.
Yates was asked to speak by
the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship as a representative of
Harvest USA, a Christian organization devoted to the conversion of homosexuals and others
who the organization sees as
sexual deviants. SCF President
Ben Park 'O2 invited Yates to an
SCF meeting in order to provide
an outside perspective on homosexuality and the Gospel.
Although Park had not expected the meeting to be widely
attended or publicized, controversy arose when members of
the Queer-Straight Alliance
heard of the event. After debate

over how to respond, members of
SQU and QSA ultimately decided
to attend the meeting and listen
respectfully to Yates' talk.
Yates' talk evoked varying reactions, but members ofboth the
queer and Christian communities
felt that the discussion that followed was a rewarding experience.
"The best part of the discussion, I thought, was the part that
happened after we officially
ended the meeting," said Park.
According to his estimate, 25 to
30 people stayed to engage in
challenging and thought-provoking conversations.
Julie Russo 'Ol, a member of
the Swarthmore Queer Union
who was deeply opposed to Yates'
visit, echoed Park's positive sentiment. Although she found
Yates' presentation emotionally
difficult, she was pleased by the
openness of the dialogue that followed. "Unlike Yates, the Christian students there really wanted
to listen to what I had to say," she
said. "I ended up staying until
almost 1 a.m. having a wonder-

ful, empowering conversation,

and I came away from the event
feeling positive and energized."
Despite the controversy that
surroundedYates' visit, Park believes that the experience was a
valuable one overall because of
the dialogue that resulted. "I was
excited to see people passionate
and willing to discuss things that
this campus often chooses to ignore," Park said.
SQU has made tentative plans
to continue the conversation initiated by Yates' visit at a
Roundtable Discussion at the Intercultural Center on March 22.
The discussion will focus on homosexuality and religion and
SQU has invited all of the campus religious advisors to attend,
though the date has not yet been
formalized.
Russo actively supports this
effort by SQU to keep the avenues of communication open. "I
am still deeply hurt that Yates
was allowed to have an unchallenged voice on this campus," she
said, "but I hope this will be the
beginning of more fruitful connections between SQU/QSA and
SCF."

Black Alumni Weekend scheduled
By Jessica Sonnenschein
Phoenix Staff
Unlike the large-scale alumni

weekend, which is held in early

File photo

Many of the events of Black Alumni Weekend will take place at the Black
Cultural Center, above.The schedule includes discussions and parties.

June on an otherwise empty campus, Black Alumni Weekend will
occur this weekend while classes
and student life continue in full
force.
According to Karen Thompson
'O2, one of the event's coordinators, this timing is a deliberate
choice.
"The reason we have Black
Alumni Weekend during the
school year," she said, "is so that
the black alumni can see how life
at Swat is for current black students, better or worse."
The theme for Black Alumni
Weekend 'OO is "Legacies on the
Horizon," which the publicity in-

formation describes as "a metaphor for retrospection and
progress." This involves a twofold goal that encompasses both
past and future.
The event seeks to honor the
contributions of senior black
alumniand to encourage the participation of younger alumni in
the weekend.
As Thompson explained, this
examination of the past and future of the black community at
Swarthmore will occur in the
context of the present life of
black students. Not only will
alumni have the opportunity to
compare the present to their
memories of Swarthmore, but
students will also have the
chance "to know and talk to
people, similar to them, that have
'made it,'" Thompson said.

The events, which span the entire weekend, include a discussion Saturday evening by history professor Allison Dorseyof
her new book, "To Build Our
Lives Together: Community Formation in Black Atlanta 1875 to
1920."
Sarah Willie of the sociology
department will present an overview of the Black Studies Program.
Events with a less academic
focus include two parties at the
Black Cultural Center on Saturday, HouseQuake in the afternoon and Then-and-Now Jam at
night.
The honors dinner to be new
between the two parties will celebrate those who have made substantial contributions to the blacK
community at Swarthmore.

ences will absolutely be taken

The committee member said
that while she appreciates such
an approach to change, "I don't
think they're going to get too
many volunteers" for early

shifts.

She added that if the administration is forced to assign shifts,
ES employees with children are
worried about finding child care
during unconventional hours.
Nearly all of ES employees are

women.

Schall said thatthe administration is concerned about the difficulties that shift changes may
present to ES employees.
"Whatever we do, we'll try to
do it in a way that works best with
staff and creates options so that
people aren't forced to one particularshift or the other but gives
them options and recognizes how
long they've been here."
It may be a while before a decision is made, however; Hain
emphasized that the process of
change is still very young. "No
decision has been made, just an
examination of the options," he
said.
Ultimately, Hain said, the facilities department will make the
final decision after taking into
account thereactions of ES staff,
the college community and the
President's Office.
Hain shied away from predicting what the outcome would be.

ever, seemed uninformed about
how the process of change works.
"I don't know if they're [facilities
administrators] going to use our
group to decide or if they're going to decide,...but we talk about
it, we have to talk about it in that
group," she said. But regardless
of whether she is ultimately
given a say in the final decision
on shift changes, she appreciates
that her opinion is being taken
into account.
"If they just threw it at us,
there wouldn'tbe [anything] we
could do. We'd have to adjust or
find somewhere else [to work]. I
think they were nice about asking us first, because we don't
have a union."

Future Wharton RA diversity questioned at SC
From WHARTON, pg. 3
port groups on campus. Yoon's
assertion is not supported by official college policy.
Nick Attanasio 'OO raised the
possibility that RAs of color had
simply not requested to be placed
in Wharton. Yoon countered by
telling SC that she and the two
other RAs of color assigned to
Worthfor next yearhad all listed
Wharton as their first choice.
In general, Student Council
supported a reevaluation of the
Wharton RA appointments. Student Council Co-Chair Jordan
Brackett 'Ol said that "it's important at least to know that some
RA of color is accessible," espe-

cially in dorms with freshmen.
Most discussion in the meeting
revolved around what action Student Council should take in addressing the situation. RA appointments are made by an independent committee, and the final
decision about changing those
appointments is left to the deans.
Although next year's RAs have
already been offered appointments on specific floors, some of
those offers may be changed if
the deans decide to appoint some
students of color to Wharton.
Schwartz asserted that it is no
small matter to get the deans to
rescind offers to RAs. Student
Council co-chair Brandon
Silverman 'O2 added that"there's

no easy way to get around" the
students who have already accepted appointments on specific
halls. The original acceptance
deadline for RAs who have been
offered positions is tomorrow,
but it may be changed if the
deans decide to reissue offers.
Neither Yoon nor Student
Council members believe the
dearth of non-white RAs in
Wharton was deliberate. Yoon
said the deans looked at race as
a factor in last year's appointments but they did not this year.
Accidental oversight is not a
convincing excuse for Brackett.
"This is a problem to some extent," he said, "eventhough something was done inadvertently."

Not-so-Super Tuesday

Issue withdrawn
Few students probably remember the brief flurry of
action in early February when Student Council made it
its goal to have the course withdrawal deadline pushed
back until after midterms.
With the deadline March 13 past and midterm
grades now rolling in, undoubtedly students are
wishing they had paid more attention to Student
Council's efforts. The end result of the e-mail campaign was simply to bring the issue to the Curriculum
Committee's attention, but no action was taken.
The proposed change to the withdrawal deadline
would give students a chance to consider midterm
grades, often the first grades students receive in a
class, before making a decision. The change has been
proposed and shot down in the past, apparently
rejected because faculty members thought the change
put too much emphasis on grades.
The change is not, contrary to what professors may
think, too grade-focused. Grades are a fact of life for
most students, and while it would be a shame for a
student to drop an interesting class solely because of
grades, many students who do poorly in a class do so
because of lack of interest. Midterms often confirm or
make apparent this lack of interest for the student.
With students stung by the deadline perhaps now
more willing to speak, we urge Student Council and the
student body to make this an issue again.

EDITOR

College endorses racial stereotypes
To the Editor:
I was delighted to read the recent Phoenix articles
by Karima Wilson ("Facts of life: A biracial encounter," Opinions, Feb. 17) and Jesse Taylor ("The unique
multiracial experience," Opinions, Mar. 2). Perhaps
they will open the door to new approaches to issues
of race, ethnicity and identity at Swarthmore. Hopefully, in Ms. Wilson's words, people there are not "too
content or too scared to voice their true beliefs."
In recent years, the college has by deliberate administrative action incorporated into its rather special environment some of the least attractive policies
and attitudes of the larger society. Students are labeled with racial and ethnic categories used in an entirely different context by the U.S. census (and historically by all varieties of bigots and segregationists), and are encouraged to participate in collegesponsored "exclusive" (read segregated) clubs organized by those categories. College facilities are set
aside for the use of the segregated clubs, euphemistically described as "cultural."
Consider the experiences ofMs. Wilson and Mr. Taylor. Ms. Wilson was put down as a "mutt" by her fellow Swarthmore students because she considers herself of mixed background and doesn't exclusively label herself with one of Swarthmore's officially recognized categories. Mr. Taylor was appalled as being
labeled "black" (as opposed to merely being himself)
because he was on the SASS mailing list.
The reality, of course, is that a substantial number
(perhaps the majority) of "black" Americans are to
some extent "mixed"
just look around. And nearly
all of us, regardless of skin color, share the same
mixedculture: we speak mutually intelligible American English, subscribe to the ethics and frequently
the theology of a few Middle Eastern based monotheistic religions (essentially derivatives of ancient Judaism), frequently drink orange juice and coffee or
tea and go from place to place in automobiles which
we know how to drive. In addition, Swarthmore students share the common and somewhat unique cultural characteristics of high academic achievement
and intense personal ambition.
But given the choices officially available at the college, students are encouraged to identify with one arbitrarily defined ethnic group or another, with one
so-called (I believe miscalled) culture, to the exclu-

sion of all others. For Mr. Taylor, to be on the SASS mailing list means that he is "black" as officially defined
and not something else, not even just himself. For Ms.
Wilson, to be a "mutt" means that she is an outcast, a
person who doesn't fit at all into one of the official categories.
If, however, the college's "cultural" clubs were legitilearned knowledge
mately concerned with "culture"
and behavior —I doubt that Mr. Taylor would be annoyed
at being on the SASS list along with anyone else interested in, say, jazz, Creole cooking, the desegregation
movement and African history He could also be deon the list of an Asian club, a
pending on his interests
Native American club, a Hispanic club, and so on.
And students whochose to denigrate Ms. Wilson's mixed
background would come to realize that all of us, as Americans, are essentially mutts. Again, just look around.
One of the wonderful aspects of the undergraduate years
is that it permits students a period offour years to appreciate and forge their own identities as individuals —;and
their own personal freedom. That is what college policies
shouldbe promoting, not impeding. Instead, by its embrace
of arbitrary labels, Swarthmore is endorsing some of the
worst aspects of our common American culture.
And, as the experiences of Mr. Taylor and Ms. Wilson
demonstrate, the means and the ends are inescapably
intertwined. No ethical analysis can avoid that fundamental rule.
Perhaps someday we shall all be "free at last." Hopefully.

Last week's Super Tuesday was anything but.
It was a day when presidential candidates George W.
Bush and Al Gore won. They won not so much on their
own merits but rather because insurgents John McCain
and Bill Bradley lost, and lost badly enough to withdraw
from the race. It was also a day when the American
people lost and they may withdraw from the race, too.
For several weeks, the parties' primaries actually
seemed competitive. Last July, it was inconceivable that
anyone could challenge Republican George W. Bush's
haul of campaign cash and unbeatable name recognition
and inconceivable that anyone would want to mount a
serious challenge to Vice President Al Gore for the
Democratic nomination.Three weeks ago, it was
happening. Three weeks ago, with Republican primary
turnout reaching record levels, voters were energized.
But not now. There is no reason to be energetic about
voting when the once-presumptive nominees are
picked and are the same as they were a year ago, when
their nominations were presumptive in another sense.
That is a shame, because there is no indication that
the enthusiasm party regulars have for Bush and Gore
extends to the coveted moderates where Bradley but
especially McCain found support. Creating political
excitement among otherwise uninterested and unlikely
voters is what the insurgents were able to do, and it
was the perfect, if temporary, relief from a campaign
system where status in the polls is ever more driven
by status in the bank.
That makes it all the more depressing that McCain
who had promised to change the
and Bradley
failed in their efforts.
campaign finance system
Although Gore has embraced the idea, reform will
probably still be long in coming. The spending on the
1996 campaign will, for sure, be outdone this year as
Bush has foregone federal matching funds and spending limits. And if nothing is done before the 2004 race,
it will be even harder then for insurgents like Bradley
and McCain to challenge the financial front-runners.
The fact that they did so well this year despite their
disadvantage suggests once again that much of the
public is bored with something, whether it is the
system that produces the front-runners, the ideas of
the front-runners, or maybe just the front-runners
themselves. Bush and Gore, if they are counting on
reversing the trend of decreasing voter turnout in
November, would do well to recognize that.

Professor Jain has played a major role
in my Swarthmore experience. He truly
embodies the qualities I think define
Swarthmore. He loves chemistry and
teaching; he is open and friendly and always encouraging. Professor Jain forces
his students to think as ifthey were chemists, rather than students studying chem-

istry.
In spite of Professor Jain's outstanding
teaching and great popularity among the
student body, he will not be teaching next
year. It is a sad day for our college. We
have lost a great professor, mentor, and
researcher. Unfortunately, incoming
freshman scientists will never have the
opportunity to take a chemistry class with
Professor Jain. This is a great loss to the
college and the science community.

Gore distorts his anti-abortion past

To the Editor:
Throughout the course of this presidential primary campaign Vice President Al
Gore has consistently distorted not only
Senator Bill Bradley's record, but his own
as well. Dan Korobkin, in the Mar. 2 edition of The Phoenix, defended Al Gore's
record on abortion, one of the positions
with which VP Gore has taken the most
liberty ("Gore's record on abortion forgivable," Opinions, pg. 9).
Gore claims that he has "always supported a woman's right to choose". This is
not true. Korobkin stated that perhaps
Gore just "used to oppose federal financing for abortions that poor women could
not afford." While this is certainly true,
Gore's anti-abortion views runs much
deeper than just federal financing. In a
1983 letter to a House constituent and
again in a 1986 letter to a Senate constituent Gore wrote, "It is my deep personal
conviction that abortion is wrong." I can
understand how the Vice President could
evolve on his federal financing of abortions position, but how does one change
"a deep personal conviction"? Gore mirrored this moral belief in numerous House

votes.

Perhaps most significant was his 1984

vote in favor of the Siljander amendment.
This amendmentaimed to change the definition of a "person" in the Civil Rights Act
of 1984 to include "unborn children from
the moment of conception" (CQ Vote #242,
June 26, 1984). In 1996, NARAL opposed
Jack Kemp for Vice President. According
to NARAL, Kemp voted to "criminalize
abortion" when he voted for the Siljander
amendment. NARAL said this vote would
have "open[ed] the door to legal attempts
to outlaw abortion." Al Gore voted for this
same amendment. Perhaps this is part of
the reason why the National Right to Life
Committee gave Vice President Gore an

84 percent approval rating.
As a staunch supporter of a woman's
right to choose and as a member of the
Democratic party, I am bothered by Vice
President Gore's waffling on the abortion
issue. If Gore is elected president, I wonder if the American public will be treated
to the conservative Tennessean congressman or the now-evolved Clinton-style
Democrat.

The biker
inside me
I think I speak for the majority when I
say that, unless you are an actress starring in a Western-theme pornographic
movie, you should not wear chaps without pants under them. Apparently, however, bikers especially oldbiker-chicks
must agree to disagree with me on this
point.
Perhaps it would be wise to elaborate.
Due to a happy coincidence, it was "Bike
Week 2000" in central Florida this spring
break, and fortunately the hordes of intoxicated and lecherous co-eds were
duly replaced by scores and scores of
intoxicated and lecherous middle-aged
bikers and their secretaries, or so I assume. It was in this context that I witnessed the wearing of chaps sans pants.
And I say secretaries because, apparently when no one was paying attention,
bikers got really old. They also must
have gotten second jobs because they
ride around on bikes that cost nearly as
much as a year of tuition here. I think
one guy had a CD changer in his bike. I
ask as a matter in all seriousness
whether one can actually listen to the
radio while riding a bike because I can't
even listen to my radio inside my car
when someone is riding a bike within one
nautical mile.
Thus, in sum, there were old bikers and
old biker-chicks but no non-biker-chicks
at Daytona Beach this spring break. Quite
upsetting. However often one is not led
into temptation, it is nevertheless disconcerting.
But back to bikers. I think that bikers
and I would really get along after a while.
They seem to share the same general disregard for traffic laws that most 21-yearold drivers do, as witnessed by 13 biker
casualties during the festivities and the
fact that anywhere people aren't actively
obstructing theirpath is considered roadway
on the beach, the space between
lanes on interstate highways, small children. So I think we could talk about traffic violations for a good hour before they
string me up.
I don't know if I could get into the
double life aspect, though. Sadly, thebikers of "Easy Rider" have been replaced
by Harley Davidson, M.D. Due to the noticeable scent of Old Spice and the omnipresence of daycare receipts, it also
seems the live free or die lifestyle has
withered away even as Jack Nicholson
has learnedthat violence inflictedby golf
clubs is not the solution to all of life's
problems, and, when not cruising the byways of America, most bike aficionados
work as data processors in the greater
Milwaukee area.
But even that I think I could stand. It
would be like the National Guard one
weekend a month, two weeks a year. No,
in the end it comes down to the chaps. I
just don't have that kind of confidence in
my butt. I mean, as attractive as it is, I
don't think I'll be willing to show it off past
my fortieth birthday. And don't you think
it would stick to the seat if it got really
hot?

DANN NASEEMULLAH

Hfr
Common
Senseless
I don'tknow howmany ofyou have read
the latest issue of Common Sense,
Swarthmore's conservative newsletter,
which came out the week before break. I
certainly did, because I was looking forward to a very well thought-out exposition of viewpoints which I did not agree
with but which I could have appreciated.
Common Sense angered me. This was
not because of the fact that Tom Paine was
really a radical proto-socialist artisan in
Philadelphia, far from a paragon of conservative virtue, and probably would be
turning in his grave if described as so. It
was also not the issues or the viewpoints
that the authors presented that angered
me, many of which I had heard and some
of which I have argued against, even in
this very column. It was certainly not a
deep-seated and vicious enmity and distrust for anyone with different opinions
than myself: I am not the Robespierre of
Swarthmore College.
What angered me in Common Sense was
the explicit assumption, discussed in a
number of articles, that conservatives on
this campus are a repressed minority,
smothered by the crushing weight of liberal opinion. This outlook, while quite
false, also paints political discourse in this
college in a light that is misleading and
dangerous: misleading because it restricts
the debate to that essentially between
Republicans and Democrats, dangerous in
that it stops any real discussion of virtue
from occurring.
The real political make-up of
Swarthmore consists of a majority of perhaps slightly left-leaning students who are
not that interested inpolitics, certainly not
enough to write in Common Sense or to
go to rallies to end Iraqi sanctions. And I
know I'm not one of the "liberals" discussed in the paper. As a radical leftist, I
know that not many people on campus will
agree with me on most issues. Yet, I'd
rather spend my time on working towards
what I believe in, on- and off-campus, than
complaining about how Swarthmore culture doesn't let me speak my mind.
With this assumption comes arrogance,
and it is arrogance that annoys me the
most. I did not appreciate the writers of
Common Sense painting all those who act
upon their more leftist convictions as the
unenlightened masses. I was one of Joon
Suk Choi's "sheep" going down to Ft.
Benning, Ga., but I did so because I do not
trust the virtue of third-world military
dictatorships, having lived in one myself.
Does this mean I was misled?
To answer Dave Thomas in his article
"The Other Side," I'm proud to be a
Swarthmore student because all the studying we all do enables us to have a better
understanding of what is wrong with the
world and how to fix it. I am not looking
to make a lot of money or have a lot of
power through Dave's "practical knowledge." I want to be a good and virtuous
person, who has the knowledge and the
ability to do the right thing.
Isn't that "ethical intelligence" what we
all should be aiming for, left and right?

My verdict on the Diallo shooting
By Isiuwa lyahen
For The Phoenix
I had been closely following the Amadou
Diallo case and was shocked by the ruling
that his murderers I really don't care
that his killers have been cleared have
been let off scot free. Please, people are
sent to jail for petty theft, so I can't understand how four armed cops who shot
41 bullets (18 bullets entered Diallo's body
and I can't tell you exactly where the other
bullets went), at an unarmed man could
be let off scot free without even a fine.
For those who have not heard about the
case, I will review it for you. Amadou
Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, was
stopped by the police outside his apartment in the Bronx. They had been looking for a rapist and I guess that any black
man could fit their description. Anyway,
they claim that Diallo apparently took
what they thought to be a gun (I guess a
flat two dimensional wallet looked like a
gun to these trained Giuliani mercenaries), out of his pocket. So to prevent Diallo
from wreaking havoc they shot 41 bullets
at him.
Be aware that I am not an expert on the
American legal system. So you can take
whatever I say with a grain of salt, sugar,
sand, or whatever the hell you put in you
coffee. But I have a few problems with
the way the case was handled. First, the
trial was moved out of New York City to

bullets into people.To all those black men carrying wallets, beware...

even a bazooka.
Albany. I guess a few impartial jurors
could not be found among the millions of
people living in New York City. That says
something about how New Yorkers are
perceived. When the trial was moved to
Albany, I should have known what the outcome of the trial would be right then and
there. But moving 0n... The defense had
only ONE (as in UNO in Spanish, UN in
French) witness who claimed to have
heard one of the cops yell "gun" when
Diallo made to get his wallet out of his
pocket. The judge and jury were so satisfied with the impeccable defense that they
were convinced that these four upstanding cops, true honorable citizens of this
great country, were innocent.
I can understand, but not condone, why
these four cops got so scared of Diallo. We
know how black men are "feared" in this
country. That's why so many of them are
carted off of to prison each year. Maybe
the officers thought he might shoot them
with his wallet.Even I get my doses panic
attacks from time to time, especially during finals or when I get my credit card
bill. I might even believe that they were

truly sorry after they realized Diallo's gun
turned out to be a wallet. But I expected
that if they were not found guilty of outright murder, they certainly would be
sanctioned in some manner. But they
weren't. So I guess cops will be able to
continue eating donuts as they pump bullets into people. To all those black men
carrying wallets, beware... for all they
know you might be unknowingly carrying
a gun, maybe even a bazooka.
In conclusion, the Diallo verdict made
me reflect on why America remains racist
and will remain racist for a long time. You
can have affirmative action left and right
well, actually that seems to be going out
of style. The government can promise from
now till doomsday to be nicer to oppressed
people. We might even see more Clintonlike poverty tours. But there is no way anyone can change personal attitudes. To quote
a professor here at good old Swat, "You
can't legislate peoples attitudes." I pray
that the Diallo family finds some kind of
closure to this whole mess and I hope that
Americans will one day stop being so
scared of one another.

GUEST COLUMN

Gun control not solution to school violence
By Brad R. Sohn
Harvard Crimson (Harvard U.)
(U-WIRE)
Just when we thought we
had moved on from the Columbine High
shootings of last spring, an even more bizarre tragedy has occurred. On Feb. 29, a
six-year old boy in Mount Morris Township, Mich, toted a .32 caliber handgun in
his backpack and emptied a fatal round
into the chest of six-year-old Kayla
Rolland.
The boy was living in a localcrack house
while his father served out a two-year sentence for violating probation on cocaine
and burglary charges and his mother was
AWOL. Michigan prosecutors decided not
to charge the boy with anything—he is so
young he cannot even comprehend his
actions. He received a 90-day suspension
from school and possible expulsion. Authorities are, however, charging a 19-year
old man living in the house where the boy
stayed with involuntary manslaughter. He
allegedly left the gun the boy used lying
around the house.
The entire situation is incredibly
tragic for many reasons. A mother and
father have lost a child. A six-year-old
boy has suffered deep and permanent
psychological trauma. Schools once
again have become places where safety
seems anything but ensured. And politicians are picking up all of these cues:
Now's their time to make themselves
look good by twisting the issue around
to fit an agenda.
On March 9, President Bill "I feel your
pain" Clinton on CNN's "Burden of Proof
suggested this incident was preventable
if Congress could pass the tougher gun
control legislation he wants. The latest
anti-gun bill wouldrequire safety locks on
new guns, ban the import of large-capacity ammunition clips and require a threeday waiting period for background checks
before buying weapons at gun shows.
Makes you feel completely safe, doesn't
it?

While constitutional arguments
against gun control don’t seem
compelling, more gun laws do
seem objectionable on the
grounds of pragmatism.They are
not accomplishing the goals that
prompted more legislation in the
first place. In the long run,
creating more and more federal
mandates isn’t productive.
Eventually people will feel the
effects of their diminishing
freedom.
But in truth, this latest attempt to regulate America is nothing more than feelgood legislation. The boy took the gun
from another resident criminal in his
house. While a safety device might have
been helpful in inhibiting him from ever
getting a shot off, a background check
and three-day waiting period do not appear terribly effective given the acquisition process. And this is the practical
problem with most gun control legislation.
NRA yahoos love to rebut any gun control argument with, “guns don’t kill people.
People kill people.” But despite their at
times over-zealous rhetoric, there is some
truth to this statement. Most who use guns
for violent crimes are smart enough to
acquire them illegally. If someone is going to be running drugs or robbing liquor
stores, they are probably not attending
gun shows at local expo centers or stores
where they must deal with licensing. Instead, they turn to the illegal market for
guns; something only controllable through
tougher crime measures. This market is
what needs regulating.
The use of guns in connection with vio-

lent criminal behavior must be stopped.
But it can be stopped without penalizing
law-abiding citizens. If other parts of the
country follow the lead ofcities like Richmond, Va. whose "Project Exile" began
enforcing existing gun legislation and
putting felons caught with guns in jail for
five-year minimums cut crime numbers
in half, we would not need more regulation.
While constitutional arguments against
gun control don't seem compelling, more
gun laws do seem objectionable on the
grounds of pragmatism. They are not accomplishing the goals that prompted more
legislation in the first place. We need to
use our system's current penalties to show
drug dealers and violent criminals that
their actions will not be tolerated. Instead,
we continue to live in a culture where
people just cry out for more and more federal legislation every time the weather
changes.
In the long run, creating more and
more federal mandates isn't productive.
Eventually people will feel the effects of
their diminishing freedom. Most people
don't hunt or collect guns, and so they
cannot see the restrictiveness of these
laws. Maybe someday people will start
getting in record numbers of car accidents. Should legislators then start making car companies install devices in all
cars that limits speed to 55 mph? Or
rather should we hold people responsible
for their own actions (gasp)? The problem isn't everybody, it's the bad driversMake it tougher to get a license but don't
become Big Brother and hold everyone
back.
We put ourselves at risk everyday when
we allow children to live in crack houses
and are not tough enough on gun-related
crime. But while more gun laws might
help Clinton salvage his presidency or
make some people sleep easier, guns will
continue to thrive on the unregulated
black market until we make attacking that
a national priority.

Late night cynics in the morning edition

sta»ii|4-|£

By Tim Stewart-Winter
and Corey Datz-Greenberg
tor The Phoenix
So it was two in the morning, and we
had to write an op-ed, and we had all these
ideas. But none of them was really important enough to write a whole article about.
So we decided we'd share all of them with
you, briefly. And you know how us liberal
types are always pretending that it's bad
to complain about little stuff when we
have so many luxuries that so many people
in the world don't have... but tonight we
thought we'd splurge.
In the men's rooms in Trotter, there's no
divider between the urinal and the sink,
so that someone can open the door from
the hallway and watch you pee. There's a
lock on the door, which is one way to deal
with the situation, but it feels weird to the
lock the door when you're the only person
in the bathroom and there are two toilets.
I live above the laundry room in Worth,
in whichthere's a generator, which turns
on every Friday at 9:30 a.m. for twenty
minutes. It's really cool, because the designers ofWorth put an exhaust pipe leading out of the generator to the outside,
which is really smart, so that the laundry
room doesn't flood with exhaust. So, the
exhaust goes through the pipe and empties right outside my window. And my
room fills with whateverkind of exhaust
it puts out. The public safety guy told me
it was just the exhaust from natural gas
which is totally harmless... hmm.
It's hard to adjust the radiators in ML
to keep your room at the right temperature. Sometimes I'll get home and my
room will be cold, so I'll turn the radiator
up. But then a few minutes later I have to
turn it off and open the window, because
it's gotten so hot. It's incredibly inefficient.
The library was closed on the Saturday
before break ended. I know that the
Swarthmore powers that be are invested
in Swatties having a social life, so they
sometimes close the library on us at inopportune moments, but this is ridiculous; this was our weekend! Swatties
work all weekend, not because we don't
want to have a social life, but because it's

Scapegoat,
not spy

the only way we can get all our work
done!
You can get The New York Times in the
bookstore on weekdays and Saturdays, but
not on Sundays, which is when you'd really want it anyway.
Whatever happened with that
multicultural dean thing, anyway?
You can't open the windows in some of
the upstairs practice rooms in Lang, so
they get really hot sometimes and there's
nothing you can do.
The water fountains in Trotter and
Kohlberg are really pretty, but it would
be nice to have water that's not luke warm,
doesn't taste like iron and spouts higher

than a bread crumb.
Sharpies actually serves us Taco Bell
burritos... enough said.
I can never use the sports facilities during the day on weekends, for instance to
play basketball, because there are all sorts
of weird sports camps that happen then.
With all the money the college spends on
sports, why don't we at least get to use the
facilities?
Oh, another thing: the inconvenientopen
swimming hours at the pool. It's only open
early in the morning, when I'm not up yet;
at 12:30, when I have class; and late at
night, when it's cold out.
Yep, that's it! Thanks for indulging us.

Pope sets proper tone by asking forgiveness
Staff Editorial
The State News (Michigan State Univ.)
(U-WIRE)

Pope John Paul IPs plea

for forgiveness for sins in the Roman

Catholic Church's past is an appropriate
way to bring the church into the new mil-

lennium.

The popeasked forgiveness for the sins
°f the Catholic Church on Sunday during
a mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. John
Paul did not mention exact sins, but implied mistakes the Catholic Church made
during the Holocaust. "We forgive and we
ask forgiveness," he said.
Cardinals and bishops also expressed a
desire to vindicate wrongdoings. In the
United States, members admitted racism,
anti-Semitism, improper sexual behavior
by priests and addressed how divorced
Catholics and homosexuals have been
treated. Church theologians suspect the
Pope seeks forgiveness for the Inquisition,
the Crusades and other events in which

speech at the Vatican reflects well on the

to propel it into the third millennium.

The pope didn't mention specific incidents the Church seeks penitence for, but
implied the Holocaust and other tragedies.
While it is disappointing he did not go into
detail about certain actions, the step he
has taken is commendable. In the future,
such as his visit to Israel at the end of the
month, he should go into detail about the
position of silence the church took during
the Holocaust.
He vvent on to dedicate a prayer to "confession of sins against the people of Israel." He never precisely mentioned the
Holocaust, but did ask for forgiveness and
said "we commit ourselves to genuine
brotherhood with the people of the Covenant." While this is an important aspect
of his remarks, it would be in his best interest to mention the Holocaust and specific actions and inactions on the part of
the church.
While repentance for past wrongs is
commendable, the speech means absolutely nothing if the Catholic Church does
not enforce the idea. It has been courageous in its quest, but must not be hypocritical with this belief.
It is also important to note the Church

the pope only alluded to those who have
wronged Catholicism and did not become
specific. Being vague during this part of
his speech kept it focused on its true purpose.
Whether the pope's actions signal the
church's desire to update some ofits ideas
remains to be seen. Regardless, hisactions
could make the Catholic Church more approachable in the future, creating a more
welcoming environment for followers.
The next time the Catholic Church asks
forgiveness, it should not wait this long.
It would be more appropriate to seek a pardon swiftly after sins have been committed, if they cannot be avoided altogether.
Although the step may be overdue, admitting its sins is a courageous step for
the Church. Its ability to recognize mistakes in the past will make Catholicism
more welcoming in the future.

If you look up the word "scapegoat" in
the dictionary it should have a fresh new
picture of Dr. Wen Ho Lee.
Dr. Lee, a Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, was arrested for allegedly
committing espionage by revealing
nuclear secrets to China. You remember
this story, don't you? In our popular consciousness, it's already old news. A few
months ago the spy scandal brokeand even
merited a special investigation by Republican Senator Christopher Cox, who published the Cox Report.
But thereal news story here has not been
widely reported. Lee, a naturalizedAmerican citizen, was denied his right to due
process, and was considered guilty before
proven innocent because of a frenzied
modern-day Chinese McCarthyism. Even
Los Alamos security chief Robert
Vrooman, who was central to the investigation, admitted that Lee was deliberately
selected because of his race and was a
scapegoat for the White House in their efforts to flex political muscle against the
threat of Communist China.
For students ofAsian American history,
Lee's case is no surprise. It fits the historical pattern of Asian Americans, amongst
members of other groups, as being "perpetual foreigners" in our land. We cannot
forget when the JapaneseAmericans were
suspected to be the spies during WorldWar
II to the degree that their homes, businesses and civil rights were taken from
them by the American government in the
name of national security. This kind of "racial profiling" is unacceptable.
The facts of Dr. Lee's case should weigh
against such stereotypical suspicions. Contrary to popular media reports, Lee has not
been formally charged with espionage, despite being called a spy. He was not even
charged with disclosing informationrelated
to national security. Lee was the first person ever to be charged for "receiving and
tampering with information relating to national security," a provision of the Atomic
Energy Act. Many non-Chinese American
employees who have handled classified information in the same manner as Lee have
not received the same charges nor have
they been treated with painful mistrust.
Dr. Lee is a naturalized citizen whoseclosest tie to China is his Taiwanese heritage.
Almost any Taiwanese would tell you that
the last thing that they want to do in today's
political climate is advance theaims ofmainland China. However, in some elite public
officials' and mainstream media's political
imagination, China has emerged as the new
dominant superpower that may challenge
U.S. supremacyand throw globalpolitics into
a second bipolar Cold War climate.
Scapegoat, n., one that is made to bear
the blame of others; one that is the object
of irrational hostility.
Wen Ho Lee has been deniedbail during
the pre-trial proceedings and is sitting in
jail, under constant surveillance, because
he has been denied his civil rights and fell
victim to racial stereotyping. Lee's case is
a tragedy that should alarm Asian Americans and put all Americans to shame.

Despite the committee's cautious approval of Empowered Painters, James
admits that there were so many variables in the process that the committee
did not know what they were dealing withuntil they made their decision. In
fact, the Lang Opportunity Fund had previously supported community service developed only by Lang Scholars, who are selected at the time of admission to the college; Empowered Painters was one of the first projects
that wouldreceive a grant from the fund during a three year trial period for
funding non-Lang scholars.
"We [the Lang committee] are all still learning about this," James says.
"So I wouldn't say that we wouldn't support a similar project, but I say we'd
ask a lot better questions the next time around. We got very lucky in terms
of who applied for the project, got it, and is doing it, because they're doing
it."
James confesses that theadvisors to the Lang project have "taken a little
heat over [funding the project], too." But the committee's anxieties toward
the potential risks immediately turned into a strong network of moral support. "Once you decide to support a project, you do it 100 percent," James
says. Indeed, in the summer of 1999, she became one of Empowered Painters' first clients.
From Idea to Reality
Empowered Painters began its transformation from an application proposal into reality in May 1999. During summer vacation, the owners' dedication to their business was total; David returned home for only a week,
while Peter took a mere three days off. Peter and David also invited Kate
Doty 'OO, a classmate and honors history major, to join the project as a temporary field supervisor.
Kate helped find the two-story row house in North Philadelphia that became their home and office for the next three months. The house, which the
group rented for $2OO a month, required more than a simple touchup. The
windows on the first floor had been closed up after someone had tried to
break in. Plumbing problems caused the basement to flood. The lack of an
air-conditioning system caused them to feel the discomfort of the summer
heat wave.
The house was sandwiched between a Filipino couple's residence and a
Christian drug rehabilitation center named Soldiers of theLord. Across the
street, an abusive man made excruciating sounds through the sweltering
heat and open windows. The landlady provided them with a baseball bat for
security. Their surroundings were a constant reminderof the deep-seeded
economic neglect in the Kensington community precisely what Empowered Painters was out to tackle.
"A lot things that are out of whack in our society [result from] implications that aren't thought about," Kate said. "A lot of the laws that are made
and the policies that are imposed really came home to roost in those neighborhoods."
But before moving onto any larger issues, the founders of Empowered
Painters needed to learn how to paint. It was Peter's job to acquire the necessary skills and teach them to David and Kate.
Peter and David hired most of their seven full-time workers for Empowered Painters during the spring. Those hired underwent an intense screening process and were expected to have strong ties to the North Philadelphia
community. Although all of the workers were underemployed or unemployed
prior to their hiring, their backgrounds were diverse. One worker had recently been released from prison for drug charges and was transitioning
out of a halfway house; another was hoping to use her new income to help
her leave public housing; a third was a single parent supporting his three
children, mother and stepmother. Some of the workers were illiterateor not
yet fluent in English. Five of the seven employees were Puerto Rican and
two were African-American.
All workers participated in a three-day training workshop and in supervised on-site training. The wages were (and remain) $8 an hour for painters
and $lO an hour for crew managers.
Several of the workers did not make it through the summer; some were
fired and others simply quit. One worker was sent back to prison for violation of parole, while another stopped showing up to work because of family
issues. Employee turnover is especially sobering in a community like
Kensington, where leaving a job often means returning to poverty and drug
addiction.
Finding summer painting jobs for employees was not a problem, however. Peter and David went door-to-door recruiting clients in Philadelphia
area towns. Several Swarthmore College administrators and faculty, including Pat James, also became customers.
"[The workers] didn't do great but did okay," James says. "Occasional

mistakes were made due to low literacy
skills, but most of them... were very good
at keeping their word in terms of saying
whatever they did wrong will be fixed."
For Peter, David and Kate, the work of
that summer was never done. "You sit
down for dinner and the last thing you
want to do is to talk about business," Kate
says. "But there's just one more thing you
have to discuss and you're like 'Oh man,
just let me eat my pasta.'
As the flock of students returned to
Swarthmore last fall, Peter, David and
Kate were forced to weigh a difficult set
of priorities. Kate left the business completely, and Empowered Painters hired
another field supervisor, Benson Wilder
'99. A good friend of David's, he had just
graduated from Swarthmore College with
a degree in biology. Benson, who initially
introduced David to the Norris Square
Neighborhood Project, also had an established history with the Kensington community. Most importantly, he needed a job
and could work for Empowered Painters
full-time. Benson has a playful, laidback
quality to his character; he came up with
the idea of fire engine red sweatshirts
with an Empowered Painters logo on the
back.
"

On the Job
Peter Murray walks into the Kohlberg
snack bar 30 minutes latefor our 7:30 p.m.
interview. He has paint stains in his hair
and also on his bright red polo shirt. A
black clunky cell phone hangs from a
buckle on his hip.
Peter is returning from a 6 p.m. estimate, which normally marks the end of
his 12-hour work days. He has phone calls
to make, including finding out the weather
forecast, checking on the workers to see
if they can make it to work and making
sure that the crew knows the day's work
site. Some days he must buy supplies for
the business. Peter admits all of this very
reluctantly, as he can anticipate students'
reaction: "No wonder why we hardly see
you on campus."
But Peter's absence from campus seems
to be related more to his character than
anything. "Peter and classes don't really
mesh," laughs David, who has known Peter both as a business partner and as a
former roommate. "They never quite did,
but right now they really don't."
By contrast, David manages to go to
classes and strives to do well in them. "I
take both my academics and the business
very seriously," he says. Peter, however,
states clearly that his "priorities are outside of school."
Looking back on the past year of intense scheduling, neither David nor Peter were prepared for the amount of time
and mental energy that Empowered
Painters would demand. The anxieties
that Pat James had about the business's
impact on the two students' lives were
indeed substantial. Both students have
had to live different lifestyles than their
peers.

A Matter of Policy
Empowered Painters currently employs
four workers, including one crew manager. The owners make it a policy not to
reveal to their workers that they are students.

"We're the same age as most of our
workers' children, or even younger. We
need to make sure that our workers respect us," David explains.
This need for respect from their workers is especially crucial in Kensington,
where the chances of having a steady job
are slim and the ideals of trust and responsibility are difficult to develop and maintain. David and Peter do everything they
can to model a solid work ethic as they
anticipate the time when their workers
will assume ultimate operational control
of Empowered Painters.
So what do the workers know? "They
know that all the profits go to charity and
that they're part of a business." David
says. "Which is true. Empowered Painters is a business and we are their bosses.
That's what's important."
Peter stresses communication within
the company but resents any external interference that may disrupt the concentration of the workers. For instance, he
would not let this reporter talk to any of
his workers. When asked if there will be
an official press release about Empowered Painters, which could expose workers to the media, Peter refuses to give a
definite answer.
"We'll see," he says.
The Future of Empowered Painters
Empowered Painters has achieved financial stability, according to David. The
initial $40,000 in grant money covered
start-up costs, and the business's revenue
has been sufficient to pay for other expenses.
Although the goal of handing over the
management of Empowered Painters to
the workers is not far from being realized,
David is more cautious than Peter when
it comes to predicting the future success
of their enterprise.
"We've been doing this for a while now,
and we both know that we're capable of a
lot," David says. "Peter certainly thinks
it's sustainable. I'm not convinced. There's
a lot more to work out still."
Nevertheless, David says that Empowered Painters has gained the credibility
of the community. Whether or not the business continues under different owners, he
thinks that the project will still have been
worthwhile.
By contrast, Peter says that one of the
ongoing appeals of Empowered Painters
is that it is intended to continue even after his own involvement has ended. Peter
has already started acting on the idea of
empowerment groups, which will attempt
to expand Empowered Painters to other
cities. If all goes as planned, the first expansion will take place in spring of 2001
in New Haven, Conn., with the help of
Peter's brother, Seth Murray '9B.
Another idea in the planning stages is
the construction of a community center
in North Philadelphia for the purpose of
easing racial tension and developing a
stronger sense of community. Peter exudes excitement as he envisions movie
theaters and basketball courts.
Benson is expected to stay at least
through the spring of 2000, and possibly
through the summer. But ultimately, he
says, his future involvement with EmpoweredPainters depends on the development
of further projects.
David has received a Truman Scholarship, which awards $30,000 for graduate

studies to undergraduates who plan on
careers in government or public service.
Now one of 65 undergraduate senior
Truman Scholars, David's postSwarthmore life will be based on the ideology of Empowered Painters, though he
will no longer be involved withthe actual
business.
One day in Kohlberg, Peter sits down
with a copy of "Inc. Magazine." The feature of the magazine is the 100 fastestgrowing inner-city businesses in the nation, and the issue includes an article by
none other than Michael Porter Empowered Painter's initial spark. As he carefully
reads the publication, Pat James walks up
-

to him.

"So, you're still a student?" she jokes.
"Not really," Peter answers.
Empowered Painters remains Peter's
life's work at the moment, and he will continue to seek as well as receive support
from the business.
Myrt Westphal, a member of the Lang
Committee, found that Peter's and David's
partnership ultimately continues to work
because the two have been honest with
each other.
"No one can discuss economic development with me in the way thatDavid does,"
Peter says.
Within a few months, the two will be
going their separate ways.

The Volunteer Painting Project
A number of students are gathered in
Parrish Parlors on a cold Saturday in early
December. They are all waiting to go to
Kensington for a volunteer painting
project organized as a part of an Empowered Painters program. These volunteer
projects were initially organized to enable
Empowered Painters to gain support in the
Swarthmore community. Now the
project's primary aim has shifted to familiarizing students with the economically
depressed communities in North Philadelphia.
It is the fourth and final day of interior
painting at the DeVallie residence. David
shows up a couple minutes late in his startling fire-engine-red EP sweatshirt and
paint stained pants with a box of NutraGrain in his hand to distribute. (Breakfast,
lunch and transportation are provided by
Empowered Painters). As we follow David
to his car, he explains that the painting
business is weather-dependent, and that
today's air is too moist for exterior painting.
As we sit in the driver's seat on our way
to the city and more of the dilapidated
buildings come into sight, I recall David's

history of North Philadelphia. How North
Philadelphia used to be the primary manufacturing area of the city. How
Kensington, beginning in the 19505, was
left vacant after factories moved to areas
where cheap labor could be found. How
the community consequently became
more racially diverse as Hispanics moved
in.
I continue to take in the tragic beauty
of the area's lost glory as we exit the freeway. Turning onto Front St., we see the
two-story row house which continues to
serve as the Empowered Painters headquarters.
When our car pulls up to the DeVallie's
house on Hancock St., Peter is already
there. We quickly start to unload paint
brushes, paint cans, rollers and tarps from
Peter's van. Peter gives clear and succinct
instructions and then leaves us to our work
while the DeVallie's are in the living room
with the television turned on. Despite the
limited amount of space and the number
of volunteers, work progresses productively.

An hour later, Peter returns. Unable to
contain his excitement, he walks straight
over to David to share the information of
a underdeveloped community center he
has just discovered in the neighborhood
while running errands. Peter thinks the
center will provide an ideal base for his
potential community center project.
David, however, is not convinced. He plays
with his goatee as he ponders the logistics involved.
On the way back to Swarthmore, Peter
insists on driving by the community center where his future dream may lie. The
center is about a 10-minute drive from
Norris Square. He stops the car by the
center's parking lot, which is blocked off
by a wide wall.
"First, theplan is to tear down that damn
wall," he says, referring to the need to create a space where racial integration can
take place.
As we get on the freeway, Peter attempts to give a little tour but is soon distracted by a vibrant sunset that looks as
if it were engulfing the horizon. Still thinking about his future projects, some of
which are already starting to solidify in
tangible ways, he turns his head towards
me and playfully squints his intense blue
eyes.
"Ask me what I'd do if I had a million
dollars," he hollers. Then, he immediately
answers his own question: "A million dollars? That's nothing. People could give me
more money and I still wouldn't run out
of ideas."

Small

Feat

Nationally-known a capella
group 16 Feet gears up for
this weekend's "Toe Jam"
concert, first CD release
By Deirdre Conner
Phoenix Staff
16 Feet is always on the move, even
while standing still. They sing to kids waiting in line at Disney World. They sing to
waitresses when they go out to eat. They
sing to themselves, they sing to eachother.
And they sing to people at college campuses and other major venues across the
country.
Few campus organizations are as vigorous as 16Feet, Swarthmore's most popular a capella ensemble. This week is no
more busy than others for this tightly knit
group: they just returned from a spring
break trip to Florida, have an upcoming
CD release and are hosting a concert this
weekend.
"We've developed quite a name for
Swarthmore nationally as a group," Feet
member Hugh Weber 'OO said.
This is evidenced by their spring break
"vacation," during which they performed
in concerts at North Carolina State University and Raleigh University. They also
sang the national anthem at an Atlandta
Braves-New York Mets game.
Despite the national attention, the Feet
remain devoted to their fans here.
"Other groups who come [to Swat] to
perform comment on the large audiences
here," Brandon Rutter 'OO said.
"Yeah," David Ramirez 'Ol added. "They
always say we have such a great audience."
This weekend, ensembles from other
schools will converge on Swarthmore and
again get the opportunity to make such
comments. The Feet's annual "Toe Jam"
concert will include the Xtension Cords
from University of Illinois, the Amalgamates from Tufts University and the Fleet
Street Singers from Stanford University.

showcase to bring other groups to campus," Weber said.
The types of groups brought in for the
concert vary, but are always all-male, like
the Feet. The main criteria, according to

Weber: "The groups we choose have to be
good."
Unlike most typical college a capella
groups, 16 Feet was not born of the glee
clubs of old. The group was started in 1981
by a few men involved in a production of
the musical "Finnegan's Rainbow." Now,
nearly 20 years later, they are looking for-

ward to their first CD release in four
years. The album "L'Effete" features recordings made by current and 1998-99
Feet members, and was the group's focus
all of last semester until it was finished,
just before winter break.
The Feet are excited about the album,
set to come out in four weeks, calling it
"the best release to date from the group."
It is comprised mainly of classics like
"Carolina," "Red, Red Wine" and "No
Woman, No Cry."
Now that "L'Effete" is finished, projects
such as a Christmas album or an alumni
album are on the horizon.
Sound ambitious? What makes it possible is in part the mix of experience and
new talent. This year's Feet has three
freshman members, and, unlike many
other Swat organizations, is divided
equally between the class years. This allows the older members to train the

were looking tanned and rested after their
spring break trip to Florida. They were
already discussing their concert schedule
for the rest of the semester.
DC: Unless my math skills have really

deteriorated, I count 20 feet here.

Evan Gregory: We are now working
with a minimum 16 feet rule; [beacause]
we're contending with people going

DR: We discussed expanding last year
when we ended up having only 7 people
because someone went away, and that
made things really difficult. It was easier
to have a bigger group and teach freshmen early.

"Mommy, mommy," littleJulie squealed
as we sat down to another fine meal of the
best take-out I'd ever made, "tell us again
about comic books you adore, andbe sure
to go off on a completely irrelevant tirade
about your personal life."
"Yeah, mommy. Yeah!" chorused little
Brandon and little Jesse.
I looked wearily at the person I had
married for money. He said nothing.
"Okay, kids," I sighed, "but only if you
promise to go out and buy your mommy a
carton of unfiltereds before you go to
bed."
"Can I have a drag, mommy? Huh, can
I?" the little nippers cried.
"Well, I suppose. So, a long, long time
ago," I began, "Mommy's beautiful yet
single roommate (x 1537) received a comic
book from her friend at RISD and passed
it along to someone who could actually appreciate it."
"Was that you, mommy?" asked Jesse.
"Of course it was," I said, bitch-slapping
the child upside the head. "Now don't interrupt me anymore or Mommy will break
both your little wooden legs."
"Now Suzanne," my money-man said
soothingly, "the youngster didn't mean
anything. And I'm sure you'll feel better
once you learn how to write a real column
about real important things like politics
and Al Gore."

A tribute to

John Wasserman (1939-1979)

I took a drag off a cigarette, hacked and
downed half a whiskey sour. "You're absolutely right. Well anyway, so Mommy sat
by the light of her computer screen one
night and actually read the darn thing. And
guess what?"
"Was it pretentious mommy, was it?"
"Of course it was, cuteheart," I said tousling Brandon's little hair, "an art student
did it."
"Oh goody!" little Julie said.
"Anyway," I continued, "'Genisis: Bearing Fruit' is one of those black-and-white
deals, doneby an angsty, undersexed teenager with an- overabundance of artistic
talent, about a kid who is in love with his
teacher, Miss Evelyn."
"Is it funny?" asked little Brandon.
"Does it combine the pathos of growing
up with a self-mocking take on the hierarchy of high school? Is thereany bare ass?"
"No," I said, "yes, no. But there are a lot
of panels zoomed in on breasts."
"Are they Miss Evelyn's?" asked Julie.
"I find it misogynistic to objectify the
teacher as a sex symbol and trivialize her
role in the education of the student as
merely carnal and superficial."
I looked wearily at my future alimony
provider. He said nothing. I sighed,
"You're missing the point, idiot. The nerdy
kid has a sort of awe-stricken fixation on
this woman way out of his league, which
manifests itself into fantasies and a desire to impress her, which in turn leads to
a sudden hatred when he realizes the distance this creates between himself and the
other students."
"But, but," Jesse protested weakly.
"Hey, don't argue with yourmother and
try to be a feminist or you're going
straight to bed without a whipping," I said.
"Well, does 'Bearing Fruit' tell a story

I smirked and downed the rest of my
drink. You just can't fool kids nowadays.

The 'Next Best Thing' to everything else
By Mark Lotto
Phoenix Staff
Listen, I almost walked out, if that tells you anything.
I'm the dung beetleof moviegoers but I'd be hard-pressed
to find anything redeemable in "The Next Best Thing."
It's a small and intimate failure and has none of the sublime stupidity of a bad comedy that becomes hilarious
through the habit of watching and rewatching. Nor does
it have the glorious transcendental tackiness of a big
blockbuster bomb not like last weekend's "Mission to
Mars," which has earned the kind of blanket condescension from the critics that usually bespeaks bandwagon,
rather than personal, responses. "The Next Best Thing"
is a middle-brow, middle-budget bad movie, which makes
it just bad.
Wesley Morris of the San Francisco Examiner summed
up the plot succinctly when he wrote that "TheNext Best
Thing" is "a semi-autobiographical melodrama about an
L.A. yoga instructor (Madonna) who gets knocked up by
her gay plant-doctor pal (Rupert Everett), has a child
with him, then fights him in court for custody." Not a
bad idea in and of itself, but the film, which teeters
inanely between light comedy and cruel melodrama, is a
merely a hodgepodge ofall the most inspid and contrived
elements from "My Best Friend's Wedding," "Will and
Grace" and "Kramer vs. Kramer." The direction of Oscar winner John Schlesinger ("Midnight Cowboy") has
the mealy consistency of overcooked pot roast; the camera is alternately embarrassed, bored or preening.
Madonna and Everett fail in their roles for exactly the
opposite reasons Everett for sticking too close to type,
Madonna(if she can even be said to have a type) for straying too far from it. We tend to give Rupert Everett a pass
because he embodies the sort of dashing comic wit that
went extinct with Cary Grant. Personally, I would love
to see him shanghai the role of James Bond from the
crown prince of mature blandness, Pierce Brosnan, and
reinvent the whole franchise as a gay fantasia with gadgets and guns and gigolos. But in "The Next Best Thing"
we can already see him starting to atrophy arrogantly
within the cliches of the gay best friend. Word has it that
Everett, a published author and, really, the hunkiest reincarnation of Oscar Wilde we're ever going to get, did

John Wasserman was an entertainment
critic/movie reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle from 1964-1979 and wrote
often on strip clubs. Wasserman killed
himself in a two-car freeway crash while
driving drunk in 1979 and probably would
have thought I was a geek.

an uncredited rewrite of Tom Ropelewski's miserable
script and if so it was a selfish rewrite and a hoarding of
all the best lines. If Everett can be said to steal the show,
he can also be said to have abandoned it, to have just left
it floundering.
And then there's Madonna, who in her metamorphic
makeovers has finally wrung herself dry of anything that
might be called personality. Despite the naturalism of
the Raphaelite
the current Spiritual Girl incarnation
tresses and faux-hippie sundresses
her accent has
taken on a horrible lockjaw affectation and her acting,
at its best, runs toward the unbearably mannered and
precious. Her face seems to be a battleground between
a slightly spiteful make-up artist who wanted to show
her beautiful at her actual age and a slightly tipsy cinematographer who wanted to capture in diaphanous
close-up the lost little girl in her. In the skirmish, her
skin takes on the sheen of plastic-covered furniture. Let
me tell you, it takes a monstrously misguided film to render the freaking saint of 20th-century sexuality both uninteresting and unattractive.
But this is not a misguided film exactly. Nor should
the film's rapid and clumsy tone changes be mistaken
for signs of a more ambitious project that just didn'tpan
out. This is a deeply lazy film. It would rather airlift in
twists and turns than develop these people's lives in any
meaningful or coherent way. It is founded on the belief
that, left to their own devices, one "hot-button" and two
"star-pals" can make a hit. It's the next best thing to, well,
everything else.

When a school in upstate NewYork is snowed in, a group of students hijack a plow to

The story of a group of astronauts and their hurried Mars Recovery mission, this sci-fi/

Women's rugby heads south
for Mardi Gras, 31-0 win
By Cayley Pendergrass
Phoenix Staff
As a graduating senior, I decided at the
beginning of the semester that I'd truly
like to be a graduating senior, and to do so
meant fulfilling my P.E. requirements. So
in an effort to avoid Nautilus class, I enlisted with the rugby team. Besides that
final P.E. credit we all so desperately desire, I earned my spot on a van and on a
hotel room floor for spring break the
spring break training trip of all training
trips, I was headed for Mardi Gras.
Free associate: Mardi Gras... alcohol,
questionable grabbing and fondling of
body parts, and a generally good, if sordid time. Now, freeassociate with rugby...
alcohol, questionable grabbing and fondling of body parts, and a generally good,
if sordid time. It seems we have a match.
Thursday afternoon, after I hurriedly
wrote a few sociology papers and frantically threw a few pairs of underwear into
a suitcase, I boarded one of two vans filled
with female ruggers bound for New Orleans.
The van ride, all 20 hours of it, certainly
brought me closer to my teammates than
I had been. I suppose this is a primary goal
of training trips, and nothing is more effective than a long van ride. After playing middle school sleepover games (which
take on new dimensions when played with
a college rugby team) to keep ourselves
occupied, and then sleeping any way possible in a van, which seats 15, along with
12 others, it's hard to be self-conscious
about grabbing each other's shorts or piling on top of one another during games.
We arrived midday Friday in warm,
sunny New Orleans at the La Quinta Inn,
right next to Denny's. The tournament was
scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, so we
ate, got situated, watched a parade, and
went to bed early. Friday morning our Aside team played Louisiana State University and lost, mostly due to a referee's
negligence, 12-5, with our try scored by
Meghan Brennan 'OO. In the afternoon, the
team shut out Michigan State University
in a landslide victory, 31-0. Scorers were
Rhiana Swartz 'OO, Elizabeth Meehan 'Ol,
Erica Anderson 'Ol, Emily Wilkins 'Ol, and
Meredith Hegg 'OO. Swartz also kicked
three conversions.
LSU was victorious in their other game
-

on Saturday, and, although our point differentials far exceeded theirs, went on to
the playoff round on Sunday.
Those of us ignorant to the rules, let
alone the nuances, of rugby found a team
needing extra players, and jumped in.
Thus we, too, returned adorned with
bruises. We might have felt left out, otherwise... Actually, the rookies playing with
other teams, particularly in the alumni
game, learned as much as could be expected in a tournament. The alumni team,
despite, or perhaps in fact because of,
their age played rugby as it should be
played; instead of tiring efforts at brute
force, they came as close as it seems possible to an elegant game of rugby. Their
opponents, us, therookie college students,
lost miserably, but we unquestionably
gained experience and insight into the
nature of the sport, not to mention our
souvenir beer can holders.
On Sunday, the Swarthmore A-side team
encountered Florida State University in a
game of second place teams in each
bracket. As this was the last game each
team was playing in the tournament, the
referee chose to continue the tied game in
sudden death overtime until there was a
victor. After almost 20 minutes of fiveminute overtime intervals, FSU successfully touched the ball down into the try
zone, winning the game one' try to none.
(On Monday night, when we ran into that
team on Bourbon street, we quickly refused to trade beads. That shows them.)
Swarthmore was the smallest school represented in the tournament and, as was
noted by our referees, played impressively
well against teams drawing players from
a student body 30 times larger than ours.
Upon completion of the tournament, we
were free to hit the town. Thirty loud
women strutting down the streets of the
French quarter turned every head we
passed by, and solicited more than a few
catcalls. However, by the time we got
through the crowds and onto Bourbon
street, the epicenter of the charade, we
were split up into smaller groups, more
efficient for bead acquisition.
In the French quarter during Mardi
Gras, small plastic trinkets become embodied with an entirely new, and immense,
value. At the beginning of the evening,
they're nice, but not worth doing that. By
ten or eleven at night, however, you just

Women's tennis starts slowly
By Laura Brown
For The Phoenix
The women's tennis team trained in
Phoenix over spring break in order to prepare for the upcoming season. Tuesday
afternoon was the first match for the
team, but time restrictions allowed only
the doubles matches to be played. Swat
won all three doubles matches against
Glendale Community College while the
rest of the team practiced their singles
play.

Wednesday, Swarthmore faced a tough
opponent in Providence, a Division I team,
and lost 0-9. The doubles teams of Jamie
Flather 'OO/Katherine Voll 'O3 and Stacey
Wagaman 'Ol/Corrine Brinkley 'O2 both
lost incredibly close matches by 6-8 margins. Lauren Rackow 'OO also had a tight
match falling 4-6, 2-6.
The next day was filled with two
matches, first against Albion College (Division III) in the morning and then
Creighton (Division I) in the afternoon.
Swat won all three flights of doubles.
Unfortunately, the team lost focus and
dropped all the singles matches, result-

ing in a 3-6 loss overall. This did not

diminish the excellent doubles play by
the doubles team of Fran Simonds 'O2
and Tanya Chodibut 'O3, who won their
match 8-3. The team ofNellie Tong 'O3
and Rackow also beat their opponents
8-5.
Because of college match formatting, Kim Tu 'O2 teamed up with a
Creighton opponent to play another
Creighton team to complete the full
line-up. The match was lost 0-9, but
once again tough matches were fought
at every position.
On Friday the last match of the trip
was played against Scottsdale Community College, resulting in the first win
of the season, 8-1. At no. 1 singles, Laura
Swerdlow 'O2 pounded her opponent 62,6-1. At no. 2 doubles Tu 'O2 and Laura
Brown 'OO slammed their opponent 61, 6-2, playing two out of three sets instead of the normal pro-set (first to
eight). This match concluded the training trip, and the team's record for the
outing ended up being 1-3.
Swat will face Washington College
at home on Tuesday.

Women's lacrosse trains in Colorado

KATE NELSON-LEE

By Kate Nelson-Lee
Phoenix Staff

skyßSx
Drinking on break
a matter of respect
Depending on who you talk to, training
trips seem to be a time of both travel and
drunken revelry with a few practices here
and there. After talking with fellow athletes upon our return to campus from the
various trips, something dawned on me:
rather than being the norm, the alcoholfree trip of the women's lacrosse team was
the exception.
While I'm not saying that every other
athlete drank last week while enjoying
their respective exotic locations, there is
a large number of stories (both good and
bad) relating to alcohol consumption while
traveling. And while it's really nothing
new some do drink here at Swat it puts
the idea of a training trip into a new perspective.
The official stance of the Athletic Department, as I understand it, prohibits
drinking unless the coach specifically
states that it is OK. If a coach does so, he
or she assumes all responsibility for any
problems that might arise. This, of course,
is a very rare occurrence. I wouldn't want
to be responsible for 20 underage drinkers if I were in a coach's position. So,
what's the logic behind partying while on
a training trip?
What I think it comes down to is respect
and motivation. I can tell you why the
women's lacrosse team didn't partake. The
coach sat us all down the day before we
left and said, "No alcohol consumption."
The reasoning was twofold. One, we went
to Colorado to play lacrosse, not to party.
Two, it's one week out of our lives, and it's
not that big of a deal to give it up. Now, I
don't know if other teams got similar lectures, but I think what sets us apart from
other teams is our respect for our coaches.
They asked us to follow the rules and we
did. And with the trust between the
coaches and the team came a lot more
freedom. They didn't have to watch over
us the entire trip, and we focused on playing the game rather than socializing every night.
So now that I've given my self-righteous
explanation of our abstinence while in
Colorado, does it really matter if an athlete drinks or not? I'm not entirely sure. I
think there's a difference when the drinking age is 21 and most players are under
the age limit. What if an athlete isarrested
for underage drinking before a game?
When the school has provided an opportunity for a team to travel to California or
Colorado, an athlete has a certain responsibility to the team and the school, and
acting responsibly is one of them.
But what if it's the night before a day
off? What about whenall playing has been
canceled for the next day due to weather?
What if the drinking age is 18? What if it's
part of the local culture to share a pint
after a match?
What it comes down to is responsibility.
While here at Swat, most athletes are serious enough to not drink the night before
a game, and if an athlete is responsible
here, one would hope that their personal
choices would be similarly shaped while
on a trip. So, while I don't think it's a bad
thing to drink, I also did not feel like I
missed anything because we didn't last
week.

Against the backdrop of Pikes Peak and
the surrounding Rocky Mountains, the
Swarthmore women's lacrosse team spent
last week in Colorado Springs fine-tuning
their game. Their hard work and dedication came to life in Tuesday's game against
the local Widener University.
The team arrived in Colorado Springs
late Saturday night to the pleasant accommodations of Alikar Gardens, with complete foldout couches for the lucky fifth
resident in each condo. Although the fitness room and hospitality suite brought
back memories of the 70s, the team happily settled in.
Sunday consisted of a light practice in
the afternoon. Immediately, the team realized exactly how much altitude can play
a role in one's stamina. The juniors provided dinner for the team in the form of
lasagna, which was prepared by the family of Natania Kremer 'Ol.
Monday morning a group headed to the
cliff dwellings only to find that the gift shop
was larger and more spectacular than the
dwellings themselves. After a light lunch,
the team headed back to Bear Creek for a
scrimmage against Alfred University.
The contest was intended to provide
both teams with an opportunity to test
themselves against another team (the
score was not kept). Swarthmore showed
both their youth and their potential. According to senior goalie Jane Kendall,
"The first scrimmage is always filled with
jitters; it gives us a chance to work things
our of our system before the first game."
On Tuesday, the team traveled to Boulder to scrimmage the University of Colorado at Boulder and Rochester University
in a round-robin tournament. Intended as
a fun play day, each team played the others for 30 minutes. Again, no scores were
recorded. Swarthmore showed a marked
improvement from the previous day. Senior attacker Julie Finnegan recalls,
"Each of the teams that we scrimmaged
were high quality teams and provided excellent preparation for the season. That
we played well against teams like those is
a positive indicator of what we have to look
forward to for the rest of our season."
With all competition out of the way in
the early part of the week, Swarthmore
women's lacrosse settled down to focus on
improving strategy and enjoying the local sights. The team spent one afternoon

at the Garden of the Gods, a park with
beautiful natural rock formations. One
brave troupe of players headed out to "The
Well," the closest hot springs to the city.
Upon arrival, the seven met proprietor
Grover, a man with a love for cowboy
boots, hot springs and Civil War reenactment. Although they decidedthat the
pit of mud posing as a hot spring was not
very inviting, the group did enjoy their excursion, which included a stop at a tropical insect museum that was unfortunately
closed. Another group went on a tour of
the Olympic Training Center with tour
guide Margaret. Margaret seemed overly
enthusiastic about the livesof theresident
athletes and made sure the tour got a
lengthy look at the Greco-Roman wrestling room, though the team members expressed no desire to do so.
The trip was determined a success by
all, both in terms of lacrosse and entertainment. Mavis Biss 'O2 said, "I think we
were able to locate our team weaknesses
which is a great thing to do prior to the
season. We know where changes have to
be made and where our focus needs to go."
On Tuesday, Swarthmore faced Widener
University at home. Behind Kendall and

defender Kristen English 'Ol, a 2000
preseason All-American, the defense kept
the blue and gold to a mere two goals in
the first half. Swarthmore outscored
Widner 10-2 in the first half and 6-4 in the
second to pull off the 16-6 win. Kendall
had 12 saves, and freshman goalie Jenn
Hart finished the game with four saves.
Looking at Tuesday's performance, the
sophomore class looks to lead the attack.
Last year's leading scorer for both the
team and the conference, Katie Tarr 'O2
put Swarthmore on the board within the
first four minutes of the game. Tarr finished with five goals. Biss also scored five
to help the Tide with the win. Sophomore
center Mariam Levy had three goals. Tallying one point each were English, Erika
Williams 'Ol and defender Liz Brainard
'O3.
After a day of rest on Wednesday, the
Tide look towards Saturday's home matchup withthe College of Notre Dame (Md.).
The Gators have dropped their first three
games of the season, including one to Centennial Conference member Washington
College. With Tuesday's strong start,
Swarthmore women's lacrosse looks to
continue in similar fashion on Saturday.

Tennis upsets Foothill 5-4 on spring break trip
By Pete Schilla
For The Phoenix
In hopes of finding good weather and
tough matches, the men's tennis team traveled to northern California over spring
break. Despite encountering some rain on
every day of the trip, the team managed to
squeeze in three out of four scheduled
matches. First up was an informal match
with UC Berkeley's JV team. The relaxed
attitudeof the Berkeley players combined
with a bit of jet lag lulled Swat into complacency. The match started with doubles
and Berkeley came out strong to win three
out of four. John Leary 'OO and PeteSchilla
'Ol scored the lone doubles point at the no.
1 position. The team fared slightly better
in singles competition, with John Thomas
'O2, Justin Singer 'O3 and Jayson Yost 'O3
scoring victories at the no. 4,5 and 6 positions. Despite good efforts by Captain Jon
Temin 'OO, Scott Grant 'Ol, and Ben Keys
'Ol at no. 2,7 and 8, the final score was 8-4
in favor of Berkeley.
Swat was scheduled to play Division II
Sonoma State on Sunday, but more clouds

rolled in overnight and persistent rain ruined any chance of playing. The day ofrest
allowed the team to get over the time
change, but frustration with the poor
weather sparked some enthusiasm for the
next day's match against Foothill College,
one of the nation's top junior college
teams. Again, the competition started with
doubles, and with Grant out due to illness,
everyone knew that they would have to
put in an extra effort. At no. 3, Temin and
Singer smoked winner after winner past
their hapless opponents and earned a win,
but Foothill pulled out the other two
doubles matches. All of the singles
matches started out close, butFoothill won
the first two for a daunting 4-1 lead. Knowing that defeat was imminent, theremaining Swat players all raised their level of
intensity. Leary and Yost won their
matches to make the score at 4-3 and then
Temin pulled off a huge victory to even
the match at 4-4. Despite threatening raindrops and increasing darkness, freshman
Justin Singer lit up the court with an impressive display of baseline prowess and
secured the upset with a three-set win at

the no. 5 position. The team's win over
Foothill, which was the first in a decade,

was the high point of the trip and left the
team hungry to play Division 111 leader
UC Santa Cruz.
Unfortunately, more rain dampened the
team's enthusiasm. No one knew if the
match was going to be played, but some
indoor courts at a nearby club were secured at the last minute. Since court time
was limited, the match started with
singles. Everyone played well, but Santa
Cruz was tough all the way down the line.
Yost scored the lone win with a three set
victory at the no. 6 position. Santa Cruz
went on to earn the doubles point with
wins at no. 1 and no. 2, but there was not
enough time for Thomas and Yost to play
their match.
Despite the rain, coach Mike Mullan
called the trip a success. "The win over
Foothill was a nice surprise after last
year's somewhat lopsided defeat and I
think we're on pace to do very well this
season," Mullan said. This weekend the
team will travel to Atlanta to play Kenyon
and fifth ranked Emory.

Men's lacrosse trounces
Allentown and Vassar
By Mike Lloyd

For The Phoenix

The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team
enjoyed a week of hard work and celebrated two wins in Orlando during spring
break. The team easily beat Allentown 154 last Wednesday and then finished the
week on Saturday with an impressive 131 win over Vassar. Team captain Mark
Dingfield 'Ol attributed the wins to everyone playing "unselfish, team-oriented la-

crosse."

On Wednesday night, under the lights
of the Seminole County Athletic fields, the
team put together a well-rounded performance to defeat Allentown. The offense,
led by the attack unit of Dingfield, Than
Court 'O3 and Pat Friel 'O3, jumped out to
a quick lead and then kept the pressure
on with seven different players scoring a
total of 15 goals.The defensive unit, anchored by senior captain Tucker Zengerle
and goalie Sig Rydquist 'OO, allowed Allentown only 20 shots on goal, compared to
the 48 taken by the Garnet Tide.
Not to be outdone, the midfield controlled the play between the restraining
lines by winning all but three face-offs,
picking up loose balls and playing solid
team defense. Freshman midfielder John
Murphy's dodging ability and quick shot
release confounded the Allentown goalie
twice. Murphy's first goal, which turned
out to be the game winner, was a blistering shot that snuck in underneath the
crossbar and right goal post. Defensive
midfielder Jason Choi 'O2 played a solid
game by shutting down any scoring threat
on the Allentown midfield and by picking

up several groundballs.
Vassar's lacrosse squad started their season on a sour note, thanks to the outstanding play of the Garnet Tide on Saturday
night. The Tide controlled every aspect of
the game to defeat Vassar 13-1 and come
home to Swarthmore riding a three game
winning streak. For the second time in a
weekthe whole team contributed to the win
by playing hard for sixty minutes and sticking to the game plan.
The offense was led by the trio of
Dingfield, who pumped in four goals and
picked up a pair of assists; Court, who
scored two goals and four assists; and
Dickinson, who notched three goals and
one assist.
Starting goalkeeper Rydquist played a
perfect game by stopping all of the shots
he faced; he also did an exceptional job
clearing the ball in three quarters of playing time. Backup keeper C.J. Riley 'Ol, in
only his second appearance tending goal,
allowed one goal while stopping Several
tough shots during man-down situations
and finished out the victory for the Tide.
Discussing the team's early success,
Zengerle said, "It feels good to be on a
winning streak for once." Dingfield added,
"The addition of an outstanding freshman
class to an already solid group of upperclassmen provides talent and energy at all
positions."
Coach Pat Gress was pleased with the
team's performance and was especially
encouraged by the players' ability to minimize turnovers by playing a smart and
team-orientated game.
Through three games, Dingfield leads
the team with 17 points, followedby Court

Captain Lindsay Goldsmith 'Ol effusively praised the Warmothers, saying,
"I've never had the privilege of
captaining a team with so much heart
and so much drive before."
Fellow captain Jenny Hoedeman 'Ol
concurred, predicting, "This season is
going to be the best we've ever had," no
small feat for a team that finished seventh in the country last year.

taken to the emergency room bleeding
after blocking what would have a fieldlength huck from five feet away with
her nose and was unable to play for the
rest of the weekend. Murphy turned his
ankle in the Sunday game against
Purdue, while Slezak had to have
stitches after catching a Miami player's
cleats just above the left eye.

Track trains in California,
Peterkin competes at nationals
By Donald Nguyen and Marc
Phoenix Staff

Jeuland

With a squad diminished due to vacation plans other than running, about 17
Swarthmore track athletes flew to Los
Angeles last week with the hope of training in the sunny climate of Southern California. Unfortunately, it rained and rained,
and rained some more, until Friday, when
the sun finally appeared. And then Saturday, at the Ben Brown Invitational in Fullerton, Calif., temperatures soared to the
mid 80's and provided a perfect atmosphere for competition. The good change
in weather, combined with the energy provided by famous Jamba Juice smoothies,
allowed many athletes to perform exceptionally. Matt Steele 'O3, however, after
consuming 64 ounces of protein-enhanced
smoothie, suffered from a drink-induced
stupor, and could only sit on his hotel room
bed in convalescence.
The spring training was quite challenging. Donald Nguyen 'O3, after running two
miles up a mountain for the first time in
his life, could only gasp: "If I did this everyday, I would be the next Prefontaine."
Besides the mountain, there were repeat
quarter-miles, half-miles, 200 meter
sprints, and lifting (courtesy of the
Pomona College facilities). Swarthmore
athletes instantly fell in love with the
weight room, which was stocked with
machines ofall sorts: hip flexor machines,
a special back-extension setup, multiple
places to do lat pull-downs, and matchingcolored weights. Not only were the machines amazing, there was also space to
walk around without knocking into large,

sweaty people, and the free weights were
flawlessly arranged along a wall of mirrors worthy of Versailles.
The meet on Saturday proved to be excellent, both for running and watching. The
100 meter dash was won in slightly over
10.3 seconds, with a former U.S. Olympian
and the nationalrecord holder of El Salvador participating. There were many high
school and collegiate All-Americans, with
brand-sponsored athletes running in the
races as well. Swarthmore athletes still
managed strong performances: Joko
Agunloye 'Ol was sth in the 5000 meter run
(18:22.19), Sarah Jay 'Ol was competitive
in her 800 meter heat (2:31.04) and Christen Lungren 'O2 ran a good time in the 1500
(5:19.01). On the men's side, Ariss
Derhovanessian 'OO ran hisbest race of the
year in the 400 (52.74). In the 1500, Marc
Jeuland 'Ol and Jeff Doyon 'OO each had
personal bests, finishing 3rd and Bth in
their heat (4:05.23 and 4:09.27). Jeuland also
eclipsed his previous best in the 5000 by
15 seconds (7th place, 15:03).
Also of note last weekend, Desiree
Peterkin 'OO competed at the NCAA Division 111 Indoor Nationals for the fourth
time in four years, coming away with a
16th place finish. This milestone capped
a brilliant indoor career. This year especially, Peterkin had to fight off numerous
injuries which hampered her training and
overall finish, but she remains a legend
in jumping at Swarthmore.
The team has next weekend off, and
then a home meet against teams from the
local region. Hopefully, performances will
not suffer now that Jamba Juice and organic foods are far away.

Ultimate snags
wins in spring
break games

Sticking it to'em

By Paul Wulfsberg and AlyssaTimin
For The Phoenix

,

Over spring break the Swarthmore Ultimate Frisbee teams journeyed south for
two tournaments and five days of training. After an 18-hour van ride, the team
arrived in Gainesville for the University
of Florida's "Frostbreaker" tournament.
They played hard Saturday and Sunday,
March 4 and 5, and the Earthworms went
undefeated at 8 and 0, sweeping the tournament, while the Warmothers also did
very well.
The Warmothers competed against several club teams (Ultimate organizations
with older players, not associated with a
college) and two elite college teams, losing 9-4 to University of Georgia, but defeating Michigan 15-6.
The Ultimate men defeated four club
teams and three college teams and finally
narrowly won out over Atlanta's Paideia
High School 9-7, the second-ranked high
school in the country. During the Paideia
contest, sophomore standout Corey Mark
injured his finger in bidding for a disc and
had to reluctantly leave for the emergency
room.
After the end of the Frostbreaker tournament, the 40-plus Ultimate men and
women drove down to the idyllic
beachside community ofPort St. Joe, sixty
miles east of Panama City. In Port St. Joe,
the teams practiced five hours a day and
enjoyed the perfect weather in the upper
70s and lower 80s, with no rain and light
winds.
On the weekendof March 11 and 12, the
Warmothers and Earthworms hit the road
again, traveling to gorgeous Savannah,
Georgia for the First Wave tournament
against many of the best college teams in
the country. The Earthworms struggled in
the opening round, with a disappointing
15-11 loss to Furman, before rebounding
against Eastern Carolina University, one
of the nation's top teams, to lose only 1511 in an exciting seesaw game. In their
third game, the Earthworms beat Purdue
15-7. On Sunday, the tournament's deciding day, the Worms were frustrated to be
placed in the "B" bracket, which they won
handily, beating Purdue again and then
Miami of Ohio 9-6 in a game marred by
poor sportsmanship by the opposition.
The Earthworms were very pleased
with their performance over the weekends. "Effortlessly tearing apart other
teams' defenses was very satisfying," said
Rahul Bhalodia 'O2.
The Warmothers had a fantastic weekend at First Wave, giving heavy playing
time to their rookies in easy wins over
Columbia 13-2, Rochester 13-2, and UVA
13-0. In playing some of the other top college teams in the country, Swat destroyed
U Penn 13-4, edged out Eastern Carolina
13-9, won over Georgia Tech 12-4, and finally lost 15-11 in the finals to a Duke team
of undergraduate and grad students.

Getting a taste
of heaven
Last week, Swarthmore's sports teams
took advantage of the break by abandoning the chilly Philadelphia climate for the
fun and sun (and a little rain) of California, Colorado, and Florida.
While the warmth of the St. Augustine
sunshine helped thaw out my throwing
arm and lift my spirits, I couldn't help
dwelling on the fact that soon I wouldhave
to return to the unfriendly confines of
Swarthmore Stadium. Rather than marinate in misery about the eventual end of
the break, I allowed myself to enjoy my
time in Florida (not that it was too terribly difficult to do).
My job of enjoying spring break was
made even easier once we arrived at the
Flagler College baseball field, where we
played most of our games. Before I even
saw the field itself, I could smell the fresh
hot dogs and hear the stadium speakers
blasting music. Although it was country
music, I still managed to enjoy it and let
the tunes begin to "pump me up." Every
once in a while the DJ would stray from
crappy contemporary country and play a
good songlike "Sweet HomeAlabama" or
"Paradise City," which would really get me
juiced.
Pre-game festivities included taking
batting practice in one of the three
Astroturf batting cages or soft toss nets.
The efficiency of such a setup was astounding. At any given time, every player
on our team was either swinging a bat or
tossing batting practice. The thwack of
wooden bats and the ping of aluminum
bats served as pleasant accompaniment
to the stadium music.
After batting practice, I took my first
long look at the field. The grass was as
green as an emerald, as flat as a table top,
and as smooth as a putting green.
The infield dirt was a freshly dragged
concoction of just the right combination
of a firm clay base with a soft powdery
cover. It was that perfect kind of dirt that
is solid enough to dig your cleats into to
get a good jump off first base and soft
enough to cushion your triumphant slide
into second.
Behind the backstop were stadium style
seats, not uncomfortable bleachers. The
seats were painted in Flagler's red and
gold. At the top of the seats, the press box
included space for the DJ, the scorekeeper
and the public address announcer.
In center field, a fancy scoreboard towered over the 400-foot marker. It showed
the inning by inning scoring, the current
batter, and the team box scores. Flying
above the scoreboard were three flags. On
either end, a red and gold Flagler flag billowed in the wind. Sandwiched between
the two was an enormous American flag.
At game-time, we turned our attention
to the American flag as the announced
starting lineups were followed by the national anthem. The words "and the home
of the brave" opened the floodgates of
adrenaline into my veins. My breath became rushed and my hat, pressed against
my chest, began to quiver with my rapidly beating heart.
The feeling could only be described as
heavenly. My first instinctive thoughts
were, "I finally know what it's like to play
college baseball."
