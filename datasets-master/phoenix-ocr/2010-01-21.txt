Cecily Bumbray sings "Amazing Grace" with piano accompaniment by Darryl Smaw at a gathering held on Monday in Pearson Hall.
HANNA KOZLOWSKA

Even though classes weren't in session

during or directly after the disastrous
earthquake in Haiti, te dean and president's office phones were ringing with
people asking how they could help.
"Students reacted in a typical
Swarthmore fashion they were quick to
organize and respond," said Garikai
Campbell '9O, acting dean of students.

Student Council, Coalition for Free
Haiti and 120 have been planning events to
support the victims of the earthquake. The
Deans' Office, the Black Cultural Center
and the Black Studies Department are
involved in organizing forms of help for
Haiti and the Haitian community on cam-

pus.
"We are all concerned about the devastation," said Darryl Smaw, associate dean
of multicultural affairs. "How do we make
sense of it? How do we, in the Quaker tradition, hold them in the light?"
The earthquake, which hit on Jan. 12 at
4:53 pm with a magnitude of 7.0 on the

Richter scale, devestated Port-au-Prince,
the country's capital. The Red Cross estimates that the earthquake affected three
million Haitians. The death toll has been
estimated to be between 50,000 according
to the Red Cross and 200,000 according to
the Haitian Ministry of Interior.
Campbell said that there weren't any
Swarthmore students injured or killed by
the earthquake. Jennifer Marks-Gold, the
international student advisor, confirmed
that every student has been accounted for.
According to Campbell, it is likely that
no one from Swarthmore was in Haiti at
the time of the quake. Jacqueline Bailey-

Ross 'l2 of the Free Haiti Coalition estimated that there are 10 to 12 students with
a direct connection to Haiti, some of whom
were born in Haiti and others who have
family there. Both Campbell and BaileyRoss said that, as far as they know, families of the college's students are also safe.
"We want to support everyone who

feels a connection with Haiti, not just
Haitian citizens on paper," Campbell said.
The Dean's office has established a website in support of Haiti (www.swarthmore.edu/haiti.xml) as well as a Facebook
group entitled "Swarthmore Supporting
Haiti." Students, staff and faculty are free
to post informationabout events and links
concerning the earthquake and relief
efforts.
The Dean's Office organized "A
Gathering of the Community: Responding
to the Crisis in Haiti" to, as Smaw said,

"hold them in the light." The event took
place last Monday afternoon in Pearson
Hall. A few of the speakers emphasized
how important and fitting it was that the
gathering was on Martin Luther King Jr.
Day. Approximately 150 students and faculty attended the event.
"Now is a time of silence, prayer, reflection," said Joyce Tompkins, Religious
Advisor to the Campus Protestant
Community.

"I invite you into this deep place, a
place where we are all connected, where
we all are one," she added, commencing 15
minutes of silence in Pearson Hall. This
time for reflection closed with Cecily
Bumbray 'l2's rendition of "Amazing
Grace." She was accompanied by Smaw.
French professor Micheline RiceMaximin recited a poem by a poet from
Martinique. Rice-Maximin is a native of
Guadelupe, which she called the "sister

island of Haiti."
Saying that she "found she had no
words for the occasion," Allison Dorsey,
associate professor of history and coordinator of the Black Studies program, chose
to quote Frederick Douglass, who was
ambassador in Port-au-Prince and an
advocate for Haitian independence.
Rice-Maximin and Bailey-Ross were
supposed to attend a conference concerning Haitian literature in Port-au-Prince,
starting on Thursday. "My bags were
almost packed," said Bailey-Ross in her
speech at the Monday gathering.
"What was God's plan for this country,

January 21, 2010

which has suffered so much already?" she

asked.

Bailey-Ross, who has studied Haiti and
the Creole language, wrote a poem about
her reaction to the earthquake. She read it
in Creole to the those assembled, concluding with "Take courage Haiti, take
courage."
President Rebecca Chopp ended her
speech on a similar note: "Things might
get worse before they get better, but it will
get better with the help of the people of the

world and of Swarthmore."
There are many efforts on campus to
support both the victims and the Haitian

community at Swarthmore.
"Now we are trying to offer comfort

and advice, conversation and facilitate
further action," Dean Campbell said.
Faculty that are members of the Black
"Studies program are deliberating what
types of short-term fundraising and longterm support to organize.

Bailey-Ross,

in

cooperation

with

Student Council, is working on a raffle
fundraiser with Philadelphia 76ERS tick-

ets donated by the Samuel Dalambert
Foundation as prizes. The Black Cultural
Center will hold the Haitian Earthquake
Collection this Friday at 5:00 pm in Bond

HaU.
Meanwhile, in her message to the community President Chopp encourages students to donate money to organizations
helping the victims. The Dean's Office, following the recommendations of the State
Department, lists the Red Cross and
Mercy Corps as possible channels to contribute.
Bailey-Ross, on the other hand, said

that she would rather give to smaller
Haitian organizations such as the Haitian
Rescue Fund.

She also emphasized the importance of
educating ourselves about the history of
Haiti.

"Learn about the history of Haiti. It's a
bewildering series of events, purposefully
kept from history books," she said. "Do
whatever you're inspired to do."

"They each have been here for

NYU Abu Dhabi is a combination of a research university and
a liberal arts and science college,

the first of its kind in the Middle
East. According to its website,
the college is expected to draw
students from around the world,
eventually expanding to about
2000 students in five years.
"NYU Abu Dhabi will place

of the difference between NYU
Abu Dhabi and Swarthmore.
Wilcox said that the NYU Abu
Dhabi search committee contacted her about a job. She was interested in the new college due to
her Ph.D. research in higher edu-

cation.
"The search firm that NYU
Abu Dhabi and Jim Larimore
employed reached out to me and

tried to get a feel for my interest
in the position. And since Jim
decided to take it, I was interested in the model that they were

creating
because of the graduate work I was doing at the time,"

she said. "As an individual and
an academic, I'm studying higher education management, so it's
an opportunity to put into practice everything that I've been
learning at a theoretical level."
Wilcox was drawn to the
excitement of both starting a college from the ground up and the

ous individuals," Wilcox said.
As the founder of Drug and
Alcohol Resource Team and the

she has been "working very hard
to make sure that the structure is
absolutely as sound and strong as
possible."
With 17 members on the newly

past five years but was especially
looking for positions in NYU Abu

Bloom and Larimore. He found an
ad for his new position in
September.
He applied then and decided to

Sams will be the Associate Dean
of Students at NYU Abu Dhabi
and work with the "judicial component, education and intercultural affairs" of the college.
Sams also liked the idea of
building a new college from the
ground up.
"I don't know of anyone who's
ever started a new college or university and so that's really exciting," Sams said.
Bloom said in an e-mail that
Sams and Wilcox will bring to
NYU Abu Dhabi important elements of Swarthmore.
"Tim Sams and Kelly Wilcox
will add to the NYU Abu Dhabi
community
the wonderfully
invigorating intellectual challenge and affirming personal support that has meant so much to
Swarthmore," Bloom said.
Sams isalso the 2010 class dean
and the director of the Black

his leaving will affect both of
these groups, Sams said he didn't
know.

"The work that Dean Sams
and Kelly Wilcox have done, the
initiatives that they have brought

they've built with groups of students and individuals, are critical
and of such value to our entire

think about ways to sustain those

said.

First dean candidate visits campus
AMELIA POSSANZA

The Dean's Search Committee held a fireside

chat Tuesday evening in Kohlberg Coffee Bar with
Elizabeth Braun, the first Dean of Students candidate. The position was recently vacated by Jim
Larimore. The 7:30 p.m. session was announced to
the community in a widely circulated e-mail. Braun
is the Associate Dean of the College and Dean of
Students at Mount Holyoke College in Hadley, Mass.
Roughly 20 students attended the meeting, during
which Braun fielded students' questions and discussed her experience at Mount Holyoke. In her
talk, she emphasized a desire to be transparent and
accessible and to get to know community members.
When a student asked how Braun proposed to
cultivate both community and small group support,
Braun conceded that it's hard to keep a balance and
said that she would have to know more about
Swarthmore. She also said that she believes there
should be broader community efforts that cater to
large yet specific groups, such as each class year.
As the discussion moved on to intercultural dialogue, Braun referred to her experiences at Mount
Holyoke, where this happens frequently. She also
expressed her commitment to promoting intercultural dialogue. A student mentionedafterwards that
it could be worth institutionalizing a diversity component into the curriculum that could make stu-

dents learn about other cultures.
The discussion then shifted to students' personal

health. Regarding her experiences counseling students at Mount Holyoke, Braun said she always
aimed to offer "perspective and permission," by

which she means providing students with someone
to talk to outside their immediate peer communities,
and emphasizing that the choices one makes don't
necessarily dictate who one is. She added that at
Mount Holyoke there were designated "no study
zones" to help students to de-stress.
In terms of religion and spirituality, Braun men-

January 21, 2010

tioned the popularity of a weekly interfaith lunch at
Mount Holyoke that brings together faculty members, students and staff members.
When the topic of alcohol was brought up, Braun
said Mount Holyoke approached alcohol problems
from less of a disciplinarian position and more of a

helping position that aimed to counsel students
through bigger problems. She said that she would
like to bring alcohol education workshops to the college.
In response to student concerns about budget
cuts happening behind closed doors, Braun said, "I
try to be as transparent as possible with students."
She added that she was unable to say what types of
cuts she would make at Swarthmore because she
needs to get to know the community better.
Students also brought up accessibility to administrators. Braun explained how she tried to be as
available as possible, holding office hours in the student center and asking students, "What are some
events I should be at?"
With respect to the issue -of campus sexual
assault, Braun said that she would like to not only
talk about this issue as a campus but also hold open
forums to discuss campus safety, whether incidents
occur or not.
"One piece of [preventing campus sexual assault]
is providing more regular mechanisms to talk about
this," she said, adding that Mount Holyoke held a
taboo discussion series that was meant to be proactive rather than reactive.
She concluded the evening by giving students the
floor and asking, "Are there things you're really
looking for in the next dean?" Students listed advocacy, accessibility, stability and promotion of personal health as some of the most important issues on
their minds.

The Lang Center for Civic and Social

December to six sophomores: Adam

Bortner, Rebekah Judson, Tom Liu,
Lizah Masis, Stephanie Rodriguez and
Sarah Scheub. The scholarship will provide the Scholars the opportunity to
engage in a paid summer internship to
jumpstart social activism projects of
their own design and to apply for a
grant of up to $lO,OOO for implementation. Those who complete their project
successfully and wish to further their
studies in graduate school can receive
up to $lO,OOO in additional funding. A
group of mentors in the Swarthmore
community will also be available to
assist and guide the awardees.

their stories through a unique medium

stereotypes of AIDS. To improve access
to the technology in Chester, Bortner
intends to partner with nonprofit
organizations and purchase necessary
equipment, including computers, audio
recording equipment and digital cameras, to follow through with his vision
of developing a digital story center in
Chester accessible to all. The center
will also offer Chester residents living
with HIV/AIDS workshops teaching the
process of creating digital stories.

While Swarthmore students
were enjoying their last week of
winter break, members of the
Swarthmore staff attended the
first annual Staff Development
Week. The three-day program
ran from Jan. 12 to 14 and
brought a series of learning
opportunities to staff members.
"The idea was born out of a
desire for staff to have a good
development opportunity as well
as the idea that it would be great
to learn from one another and
capitalize on the resources we
have in our community," said
Melanie Young, vice president of
human resources and a member
of the SDW Planning Group.
The planning group put out
an open call for proposals for
sessions and got a large and varied response. As a result, members of the Swarthmore community ranging from English professor
Peter Schmidt to

ed a session entitled "I Didn't
Know -I Could Do That In Excel."
"It was really helpful," she said.
"I walked away with quite a bit
of information. I came back and
used it right away."
Staff from all areas of the college attended the sessions.
Young estimated that general
sessions attracted more than 100
participants and several of the
specialized sessions, maxed out
at 40 people, were full.
In addition to offering staff
the chance to learn from one
another, the week also provided
participants with the opportunity to share their passions and
show off their talents with the

a similar one begun five years
ago by the human resources
director at Colgate University,

where

Rebecca Chopp formerly served.
Swarthmore College's human
resources department is a member of a consortium with five
other institutions, including
Colgate. It is through this group
that the idea got passed along to
the college.
"It was a wonderful mixing of
community
members
that
wouldn't normally take place,"
said Sharmaine LaMar, equal
opportunity officer and chair of
the planning group. "We already
have some ideas for next time

The planning group is currently conducting a survey of
attendees and other staff mem-

bers to determine what changes
to make to the program and how
often to run it. Some small
changes,
such as offering
nametags to all participants
instead of just session leaders,
are already apparent.
"It was a typical Swarthmore
staff experience," Young said.
"Whenever we need people to
work on stuff, people volunteer
and they throwtheir weight into
it, and it always goes well."

It looks like Swarthmore is still on top
for the second straight year the college
has been named the "Best Value Private
College" by The Princeton Review and
USA Today. Senior Vice President and
Publisher of the Princeton Review Robert
Franek said that a college's "value" is
determinedfrom student and administration surveys that, unlike some other
Princeton rankings, rate a variety of factors in three areas: academics, cost and
financial aid.
"Swarthmore provides an excellent
education for what we charge and it is
worth every penny. We may also be
affordable for students who might not
consider Swarthmore based on sticker
price alone," said Jim Bock '9O, dean of
admissions and financial aid, of the college's ranking in an e-mail.
This recent ranking is in addition to
Swarthmore being ranked as first for
"Great Financial Aid" last August in The
Princeton Review's "The Best 371

When asked how he would hope that
prospective students would look at the
ranking, Bock said, "Some of the most
expensive schools may be the most affordable in the end. A liberal arts education
has never been more critical and important, and one of the best places to receive

Franek echoed Bock's statement, noting that often a school with a lower "sticker price" may actually end up costing
more than a seemingly more expensive
school like Swarthmore.
Through surveys collected for a
Princeton Review book called "College
Hopes and Desires," Franek found that
families' biggest concern was that a student would get into a first choice school
without being able to afford it. He added

Unicorn Star magazine fills in sci-fi literary niche
literature club, is currently accepting submissions for the magazine Unicorn Star.
While Unicorn Star might be unfamiliar to some Swatties, its publication is a
longstanding Swarthmore tradition. It has
a long and complex history, and some people might still remember it under the
name "Bug-Eyed Magazine." For the past
two years, however, this magazine has

Isaac Asimov, author of "1, Robot", is
widely considered one of the Big Three
science fiction writers and represents
the "hard" sci-fi genre.

Lovers of science fiction and fantasy
have reason to rejoice: Psi Phi, the
Swarthmore science-fiction and fantasy

been published under the name Unicorn
Star, under the leadership of Psi Phi and
other writing clubs. Contributor David
Hinojosa 'l2 said that Unicorn Star was a
variation on the prior name Unicron Star,
"as in the Transformer villain."
Rachael Mansbach 11 and Sarah
Bricault 11 are co-presidents of both the
creative writing and science-fiction clubs.
Although Swarthmore does have a variety
of student literary publications, most of
them seem to focus either on academic
writing or on what Mansbach would call
"modern literary fiction."
"Most literary magazines [here at
Swarthmore] don't do science fiction or
fantasy. It's kind of a niche that needs taking," Mansbach said.
Mansbach noted that many Swatties
who write for leisure seem to prefer writing modern literary fiction but expressed
the view that this trend does not necessarily reflect what students enjoy reading.
According to Mansbach, the notion of
narrative is at the core of "genre fiction"
such as science fiction and fantasy.
"[Whereas] literary fiction tends to be
about writing," Mansbach said, "genre fic-

tion tends to be about the story." These
genres are often associated with recognizable tropes and conventions.
The writers who choose to engage in
them, however, do not feel limited by the
demands and expectations associated with
these genres. Rather, they enjoy rising to
the challenges inherent to genre fiction.
"Conventions are fun because they can
be subverted or fulfilled in unexpected
ways," Mansbach said.
Science fiction and fantasy are often
associated with each other, much to the
dismay of some of their fans who insist
that they are two different genres.
Mansbach suggested that these genres
have a similar appeal to readers in the
way they explore the unknown.
While she contended that "hard sci-fi is
nothing like fantasy," she suggested that
"in soft,sci-fi, science plays almost the
same role as magic does in fantasy."
Mansbach cited the well-known sciencefiction epic "Dune" by Frank Herbert as
an example of "soft sci-fi" where the
author does not go into long scientific

The sense of wonder and
thirst for exploration remain instrumental factors in drawing readers to fiction,
and to science fiction and fantasy specifically. Creative writing club member Jean

of life, and make me enjoy it. The authors

At Swarthmore, reading and writing
such fiction can open windows onto distant worlds, far away from the bubble's
all-encompassing intensity. In this way,
these creative writing genres can provide
students with a refreshing break from
their studies. When asked if fiction should
be about getting away from reality,

What He's Wearing:

dress shoes are from DSW.
While Chung's outfit appears to be simple, overall the
hints of strong colors in the sunglasses, the lining of the
blazer and his belt give the outfit some panache. The J.
Crew belt, with its red and navy stripes, picks up the
color in the pants and breaks up the neutral top and bottom in an interesting way. The pop of bright color within
a neutral outfit is always classic, especially in the winter.
The way Chung has rolled up the blazer's sleeves to show
the dark orange lining is effortless, but shows his understanding that even a small amount of color can make a
simple palette and outfit unique.

How He Describes His Style:
Though he said he has no idea how to describe his
style, he mentioned that it's currently eclectic. "I'm just
trying a lot of new things because I recently started caring again about [personal] style," Chung said. His style
has evolved over the years, ranging from preppy to punk
to dressy work wear. "[lt's] just all over the place." Chung
said he doesn't follow fashion closely, explaining that for
him, "it's more about style." He prefers "super clean [and]
classic lines [colors] like black and silver," saying that
...

these are timeless trends.

Fashion Influences or Inspirations:
"I always look to try and kind of be different from the
people around me," Chung said. He gravitates toward
European style and especially the impeccable fashion
sense of the Italians. "I'm into Milan, Florence and Rome,
and I would definitely say my favorite is Florentine

ted." Chung also cites an array of

blogs as inspiration. He mentioned
The Sartorialist, a blog that has

become a staple for many fashion-forward people (check out Scott
Schuman's book "The Sartorialist," a
great coffee-table book addition). He
browses the pages of Lookbook.nu and
the Jak & Jil blog.

Where He Shops:
"I like to shop anywhere the inspiration strikes me," Chung said. He likes to
visit Philadelphia's many boutiques.
"My favorite is Matthew Izzo boutique as
well as Sugarcube," he said. He also
enjoys walking around Walnut and
Chestnut Streets with their abundance of
shops. Philadelphia boasts a wide array of
great shops, including trendy and chain
stores near Rittenhouse Square as well as
many vintage and consignment shops.

Wardrobe Staples:
"I learned a long time ago that fitted coats
actually keep people warmer than large billowy coats," Chung said. A streamlined and
less bulky coat flatters any body type, man or
woman. Having a tailored coat is a must for
Chung and currently his favorite is the toggle
coat. "Any tailored coat is a really worthwhile
investment in the winter," he said. "It's my
favorite item right now [because] it pulls
together an entire look."

Favorite Time Period in Fashion:
The dim economic situation of the '3os and
'4os resulted in simple, less expensive style in
both men and women's fashion. Chung liked how
'everything had to be a little pared down, a little
bare bones during that time." Men's suits were
classic and lacked the flair of the '2os. "I really dislike
things that can ruin proportions," he said, such as frills,

BY ANNE COLEMAN
acolemal@swarthmore.edu
David Mamet delights in making his audience
nervous. He laces his scripts with gratuitous profanity and coarse language that most of his theatergoers
would be embarrassed to overhear, much less use, in
public. His newest play, "Race," which hit Broadway
in December, is no exception when it comes to language, and his choice of subject is certainly intended
to push his audience. Unfortunately, his script falls
short.
The play concerns a law firm of three lawyers
(James Spader, David Alan Grier and Kerri
Washington), one white and two black, who are
sought out by a wealthy white businessman (Richard
Thomas) accused of raping his African-American mis-

tress.

The performances are, with one exception, very
faithful to the script and powerful to a point. Spader
invests himself entirely in his role, delivering a
simultaneously sympathetic and repulsive performance as a lawyer who is both exceptionally comfortable addressing and articulating racial issues and
inadvertently a victim of his own awareness. Grier,
his partner at the law firm, is similarly devoted but is
shortchanged by the script. So too is Washington as
their underling. Thomas, the fourth member of the
group, is abysmal, and by no fault of the text,
although the part is no gem.
This is not the work of the same Mamet who wrote
"Glenngary Glen Ross" and "Oleanna." While his
choice of topic is certainly a lightning rod, which is to
be expected from him, the execution lacks fire. His
lead role is a typical Mamet man, with all the long
speeches and quick witticisms an actor could dream
up, but he is the only interesting thing in the play.
The clash of wills that Mamet seeks to establish in his
script goes unrealized, and even Spader's striking personal revelations in the second act aren't enough to
make up for the lost opportunities of the earlier
scenes. It would seem Mamet unfortunately fell in
love with his protagonist and gave him a straw-man
adversary instead of developing one of his signature

impasse endings.
The play is both a comedy and a drama, with
Spader's character spewing "truths" that are too blunt
and too accurate to be anything other than funny, but
Mamet so thoroughly fails to integrate the two
attempted genres that the laughs are limited in number and are restricted to some ofhis less brilliant (and
therefore less brutal) quips.
The intended counterpoint to the humor, the dark
drama, reads like an episode of "Law and Order: SVU"
written by a jaded ex-district attorney. The premise is
promising, the plot developments are interesting and
the characters are believable (with the exception of
Richard Thomas's Charles Strickland), but there is
something amateurish in its neglect of Grier and
Washington's characters, who are both ready to surprise us but never get the chance, overshadowed as
they are by Spader's character.

In the past when Mamet has directed his own
plays, they have been hugely successful. Ben
Brantley, when reviewing this past year's production
of "Oleanna," even commented that one of the failings
of the production was that the revival wasn't directed
by Mamet (who directed the original production on
Broadway).

Notwithstanding, "Race" would have fared better
in the hands of one of Broadway's recent luminaries,
such as Matthew Warchus or Bartlett Sher. With distance, which Mamet as the author lacked, those directors would have had the chance to notice what someone as deeply invested as the playwright could not:
that the play was dangerously close to making the
audience feel better about itself, which is the last
thing most Mamet plays should do.
The ultimate failure of the play is evident in the
aftermath of the show. The thought-provoking and
scandalizing tidbits that litter the first act are rendered dull by the end, and the faces in the audience
prove it. They are happy. For them, the moral ambiguities have slipped to the back of their minds, and
the lasting impression is that they've experienced a
daring but intelligent summary of all of the issues
currently facing the nation on the subject of race, par-

lasting meaning or questions to their audience.
ticularly regarding "white guilt."
What had the potential to be a shocking, even scarring, experience became just another talking point for
those who attended the show to prove to themselves
and their peers that they are progressive and enlightened.

What Mamet and "Race" needed was another voice,

someone who knew how to work with "Mamet-speak"
but could also recognize that this wasn't his finest
work. Undoubtedly, revivals of the show will benefit
from the additional perspective, but it is unclear
whether or not revisions will be necessary to really
help the show achieve its potential. They certainly
couldn't hurt.

of upstanding individuals to the sheer
obscenities that pervert my brain.
Actually, I just thought it'd be cool to
change things up a bit. Allow me to
introduce you to the newly formatted,
freshly but not quite fully baked Sex in
the Bubble: this semester the column
will become an interactive exchange
between lovers past and present,
between friends with and without benefits and, maybe least importantly,
between Swarthmore students and their
beloved columnist.
I'd like to kick it off with two anecdotes received last semester. Both
recount the first hookup with a particular person
but that may be all they
have in common. Maybe you will find
these stories universal; maybe you will
find them unique. However you interpret them, at least appreciate them for
their capacity to provide microscopic
insight into the nature of Swattie peron sex:
Dear Amber,
"I ended up picking up a guy at a
Parlor Party, so we were both totally
sober. We had linguistics together, and
he offered to help me with the homework. Unfortunately, it was the best
offer I'd gotten all Saturday night. We
actually did homework, too. For quite a
while. And then he made a terrible
excuse about some movie he thought I'd
like (how would he know?) and we went
back to his room to watch it. We didn't
quite have sex, but I ended up sleeping
there anyway because it was really late.
In the morning, I rolled over and he
said, 'lt's 7:20,' to which I'm pretty sure
I replied 'That's nice,' and fell back
asleep. When I rolled over again he went

THE PHOENIX

'lt's almost 9. You should get out before
someone sees you.' And I did leave, pretty much undetected. However, before he
said that I felt fine about the whole experience, but afterwards I felt kind of
dirty. He didn't look at me the whole
time I was getting my stuff together or
as I was leaving and even though I'd
decided to be there, now I felt like I'd
been used."
Sincerely,

Baffled
Dear Baffled,
First of all, I'm sorry you had to go
through that. No one should ever feel
used after a hookup. Unfortunately,
while I'd like to tell you that this experience is altogether atypical
a mere
fluke of an asshole among a world of
chivalrous knights
that would be
false, kind of like telling an overwhelmed freshman that the first week of
Swarthmore is the hardest. (Relax; it
only gets better from here!) The truth is,
for some of us, sex (sexual acts) is just
something people do on the weekends
a diversion that makes getting from
Monday to Thursday more tolerable.
I'm not saying that this guy is a
sociopath who didn't give a shit about
you as a person, but more likely, that he
probably thought you were cute and
charming and wanted to have fun with
you for a night. This point, however, in
absolutely no way justifies the way he
treated you the next morning. I don't
care if he had lacrosse practice or deathly low blood sugar, kicking you out at
the crack of dawn is tactless. What's
worse, he didn't even make an attempt
to give you any sort of goodbye that
might suggest that he appreciated your
company. Either the guy is just a dick,
or too swawkward to think of a respectful way to say goodbye.
One way to prevent uncomfortable
situations is to find out what your
hookup's intentions are before you go
too far with him/her. Make sure you're
both on the same page. If his or her
intentions are on par with yours, you
probably won't end up the user or the
usee. Just remember: it's all fun and
games until someone wakes up the next
morning.
Unfortunately for men, the assholes

male population. Have a string of
hookups with a few less-than-respectful
guys, and it's easy to start thinking that
all men are dicks. But now read the following Swattie's story and make up
your own mind.
Dear Amber,

"She was the girl. I respected her
intellectually, physically, and emotionally and I was already falling for her
before we were in bed. I'm not used to
truly caring for or respecting people I
usually find myself in bed with, but she
was different. I wanted nothing more
than to please her, to prove my worth as
a sexual partner as well as a friend.
After some intense foreplay and
explaining why I didn't feel comfortable
receiving fellatio, it began
and
promptly ended. I had failed. I hated
myself. I'd prematurely ejaculated. I
cried into her naked breasts and tried
to explain. I felt completely emasculated. I had failed to fulfill the male role of
lover.
Embarrassment wasn't even enough
to describe it. She comforted me, told
me it was ok, but what else are you
going to tell a friend in that position? Of
course you would say that. It wasn't
okay for me, I couldn't perform my role
I felt inadequate and vulnerable. She
wanted sex and I couldn't give it to her,
or let her give it to me... I was useless.
This was a beautiful experience. Our

emotions were beautiful. My misery
was beautiful. My failure to live up to a
pre-determined idea about how to fulfill
the proper role of male lover was beautiful."
Sincerely,
The Failure

With two stories that show such distinct perspectives, it would be foolish to
try to draw some overarching conclusion about the nature of sex at Swat.
Perhaps the only thing we can conclude
with certainty is that our experiences
are diverse. Behind the closed doors of
your Wharton neighbor, or on the other
side of your Willetts wall, the action is
happening. You may not like to think
about it when you're trying to write
your seminar paper, but it's true. Less
than a month ago, I opened my door to
find a man dressed in a Darth Vader
mask and lady's lingerie dashing out of
my neighbor's single. I can only imagine what kinds of episodes are playing
out elsewhere. It's up to you to share
with the world.

CAREERS OVER COFFEE
What would you do if you met the CEO or the president of a company one day
in an elevator? This is just one of the possible scenarios that Swarthmore's
Career Services attempts to address in the Coffee Club, an interactive workshop that serves as an introduction to the world of work and career decisionmaking for professionally-minded Swatties. Members of the Coffee Club will
learn how to explore personal interests, translate these interests into concrete
professional fields, be good professionals with social etiquette, and of course,
try to encapsulate all of these efforts over breakfast and coffee, thanks to the
early morning catering provided by Career Services. Why breakfast and coffee? "We try to get students in before they get wrapped in their day," Jennifer
Harrington, instructor of the Coffee Club, said. Discussions topics range from
"What's the Buzz?" (looking at available careers in the market), "The Daily
Grind" (obtaining professional experience), and "Joining the Brew-ha-ha"
(networking with accomplished professionals and Swarthmore alumni). If you
have any inquiries concerning membership to the Coffee Club or upcoming
Career Services events, please contact Jennifer Barrington at

If I made a New Year's resolution to
exercise this year, what would have
changed between Dec. 31, 2009 and Jan.
1, 2010? Does my making a resolution
suddenly give me the willpower, the
motivation and the time to exercise?
Not really, at least not in my experience.
So, no, I'm not into New Year's resolutions. But I am all about new semester resolutions. New semesters bring
new schedules and usually the wisdom
gained from previous semesters to
make informed changes to routine.
For example, finals period makes
you realize you don't like finishing the
semester as a complete zombie and
sleeping only three hours a night. The
beginning of a new semester allows you
to change sleeping habits now, before
schoolwork makes you think you can't
afford sleep.
Conversations with friends and hallmates at the beginnings of semesters
are usually filled with such resolutions:
this semester I'm going to find a balance between work and play or spend

more time with friends in Sharpies or
and so forth.
go to bed at midnight
With that in mind, I propose considering exercise as a resolution to take up
this semester. The beginning of the
semester offers invaluable flexibility to
tinker with ways to add exercise to
your routine. Not only do you have a
new class schedule, but also the
add/drop period generally affords the
luxury of a less burdensome workload,
since most professors don't want to
hand out large assignments until the
class roster is set and some actual
learning has taken place.
Now would be a good time to identify where you have gaps in your schedule that could be filled by a walk in the
Crum or a trip down to the gym.
Look for mornings when you don't
have class before 10 a.m., or afternoons
when you get out of class and wouldn't
otherwise do anything until going to
dinner. Remember that nights aren't off
limits for exercise and can be the ideal
time for such activities as
going to the pool during
open
swim or

or to change for intense exercise, but it
would be the perfect length of time to
wander through the trails in the Crum
or to take a walk through the Ville.
Larger chunks of free time can be a
great opportunity to go down to the
Mullan Center and explore the variety
of exercise options in the gym.
If you have lots of time but don’t
think you’ll be able to motivate yourself
to schedule exercise regularly, search
out an organized activity. We have
dance classes, club sports, intramural
sports, martial arts clubs, etc., so you
should be able to find some regularly
scheduled activity that will get you
moving.
The hard part about resolutions lies
in keeping them. As the semester
moves forward, you might be tempted
to ditch the exercise part of your routine and fill it with something else.

class might be
too short to get any
substantive work done

But Swarthmore students are all
about multi-tasking, so if you want to
make exercise easier to justify in your
mind, then couple it with something
else that you need or like to do.
I’m a huge fan of getting massive
amounts of reading done while on the
stationary bike
that’s how I plan to
survive the reading load of two literature classes this spring. If you prefer to
use exercise as an escape from schoolwork, try setting up an exercise time
with a friend. That way someone will be
keeping you accountable, and you can
spend the time catching up on life, the
universe and everything while taking a
stroll in the woods or using the elliptical machine in the gym.
You could also purposely use exercise as alone time and spend it thinking. If you’re into meditation, prayer or
just simple reflection, exercise can be a
eood excuse to get away from noise
id distractions.
Try to find something, whatever
four preferences may be, that can
add to your list of reasons for exercising, and that’ll help you stick
with it.
So take advantage of these
next few weeks and experiment.

rity is currently composed of a stack of
procedures that are designed to prevent
a particular terror scenario from unfolding.

Country profiling
Racial profiling is abundant in law
enforcement activity, but the TSA's practices are particularly egregious. While it
is unclear whether the TSA engages in
although anecdotal
racial profiling
evidence certainly suggests this is the
case
it definitely employs country
profiling on a wide scale. Travelers from
countries that are "state sponsors of terrorism" or "countries of interest" are
automatically subject to "intensified
screening". Currently, the countries on
this list are Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
Nigeria, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria,
Afghanistan, Algeria, Lebanon, Libya,
Iraq, Somalia and Yemen.
Such profiling unnecessarily targets
innocent travelers from these countries
and may well increase their feelings of
hostility toward the United States, so the
system
is
counterproductive.
Researchers at the University of Texas
in Austin determined last year that
racial profiling is no more effective at
catching wrongdoers than randomly
checking travelers because under racial
profiling additional resources are spent
screening huge numbers of innocent
people. In effect, many more travelers
are screened with no measurable
increase in security. It is virtually certain that country profiling is just as ineffective. Consider, for instance, the
United Kingdom, which has a significant
Muslim population with extremist elements. It is inconceivable that the TSA
would put the UK on its list of "countries
of interest" because of the many political
ties the country has with the United
States. Country profiling then is also
arbitrary, further decreasing its effectiveness. And how could profiling pro-

tect the U.S. from home-grown terror-

ists?
But any system is only as secure as it
is at the point of minimal security, and
this applies to racial profiling. Just as
forbidding passengers to carry particular items onto airplanes will lead terrorists to hide bombs elsewhere, increasing
security for travelers from particular
nationalities will only increase terrorists' incentives to recruit elsewhere.
What point is there in having various
levels of security when it is easy for
attackers to circumvent the additional
security?

Improving traveler confidence
The federal government owes us a
review of the TSA's security practices
and their relative effectiveness. Rather
than being reactionary out of political
convenience, the TSA must implement
only those security measures that are
effective and that respect the privacy
and other rights of travelers. Ultimately,
the TSA's goal is to make flying safe. The
review that we propose will help the TSA
do this by investigating which measures
work and which do not. Ultimately a

dispel some myths. Despite what one
may expect, dressing athletically is
not enough to make you sweat if you
don't actually play in the game. The
20-minute warm-up period before
basketball games provides a pretty
decent sweat, but sitting down for an
hour or so is good enough for a cooldown, so when post-game shower
time comes around, you're not exactly dirty anymore. At least not stinky
enough that you can't wait till you
get back to Swat and shower in the
privacy and luxury of your own

dorm.

However, showering is a team
bonding experience (if you've spent
any extended period of time with the
basketball team you have a bit of an
idea of what I'm talking about), especially after a win. And though I'm all
about team bonding, showering for
no reason other than being naked
with your friends isn't always my
favorite thing to do (granted it can be
sometimes).
This column comes largely from
the last 45 seconds and post-game
"shower" from our game at Johns
Hopkins on Jan. 12. At Hopkins, I
actually recorded a o+, one of the

more embarrassing statistics in

sports, which you receive when you
get into the game but record less

than a minute of playing time. After
what I considered my greatest
warm-up performance ofall time (to
a super awesome Kidz-Bop-like

warm-up CD created by the Hopkins
players), I proceeded to sit on the
bench for (almost) the entire game. I
went from spraying my wet jumpshot all over the court with extreme
focus while "Every Time We Touch"
by Cascada blared in warm-ups to
intensely watching and mentallypreparing myself to play, sustaining
my focus on the bench all game. I
was pretty much flirting with assistant coach level, making astute
adjustments and even changing

defenses once or twice while coach
wasn't watching.
Or, I was winking at the ridiculously cute girl sitting alone in the
second row on the far side of the gym

Regardless of which storyline

you chose to follow, with two minutes left I found myself still wearing
my warm up. I had seen zero game
action. At this point, I turned to one
of our freshman who also had not
played and said these exact words;
"There is no way I'm showering

after this game..." to which he so

quaintly replied, "Me neither." But
literally a minute later, something
amazing happened... Coach put me
in the game. And literally 30 seconds
later something less amazing happened... the game ended. In all seriousness, I made the most of my 30
seconds, making a no-look pass for

an assist that would have made
"Pistol Pete" Maravich applaud from
his grave; this simultaneously gave
me enough confidence to talk to that
girl (?) and provided Matt Allen (our
senior captain) enough entertainment to call shenanigans on my
pass, claiming that I only made the
frivolously fancy flick just so I could
write about it (again, fill in the
blanks on your own).
But the real story emerges back
in the locker room, where we find
our hero actually in the shower. I
had convinced myself thatthere was
no post-game shower in my future
but it was literally less than a
minute of playing time that had me
end up changing my mind. Aside
from being slimed on Nickelodeon
and grinding in Paces, I can't think
of a single thing that can happen in
30 seconds that would provoke a

shower.
Did I need to shower? No. So
then, why did I shower? Honestly,
I'm still trying to figure that out. All
of the elements of a truly good postgame shower were glaringly absent.
We lost, I pretty much didn't play,
and the shower looked about as
scuzzy as 33 on Hopkins. Still, I felt
compelled. Whether this is a story
about the beauty and meaning of
playing in a game and how every
second is precious or the unique and
mystical lure of the shower, I'm not
really sure, but all I know is that
something drew me to take all my
clothes off and get wet though to my
knowledge, Girls Gone Wild was not
in attendance. "
This leaves me in a precarious
position. The basketball team has
about 10 games to go, and predicting
my playing time is kind oflike going
to a WNBA game. Since it's a competitive sport, you can never rule out
the possibility of something spectacular, but deep down you know what
you're getting yourself into. Since
it's technically required by my
coach that I shower after every
game, I could go that route, but it's
clear that I'm not ready for that. I
have teammates that have showered

even though they haven't played, but
that was reportedly to remove the
pre-wrap from their ankle tape (or to
use the shower's flow to hide their
tears like my buddy at Marist does).
I also have teammates that ditch the
post-game shower after recording
their Do Not Play. Either way, being
in the middle is just plain uncomfortable. I'm open to suggestions.

Without any semblance of a run
game (42 yards total), he maximized the effect of his other

years.

Because their quarterback
has thrown for 9400 yards since

2008, the Saints' rushing offense
doesn't get much attention,
despite ranking sixth-best in the
league this year and featuring
three above-average backs in
Pierre Thomas, Mike Bell and
Reggie Bush.
Today was their coming-out
party as they combined for 171
yards and two touchdowns
while forcing the Cardinals'
defense to divide their focus
between running'and passing
attacks.
It may have just been me,
but the Saints' fumble recovery
in the first quarter, forced following a 28-yard completion by
Arizona, felt like a microcosm
of the entire year of a defense
that ranked 26th in pass defense
but Ist in takeaways. No one is
debating which, unit on the
Saints is more dominant, but
the defense has stood out this
year on its ability to create
turnovers.
Offensive MVP: Bush (84
yards rushing, 4 receptions, 1
punt return TD). It seemed like
this was the first year where
Bush's versatility was duly
appreciated. His tenure in New

Chargers make it easy to say
that San Diego gave the game to
the Jets. This is unfair to New
York, whose defense more than
lived up to its billing as the
league's best by limiting the
receivers' yards after the catch,

consistently pressuring Philip
Rivers, and getting their own
offense on the field (San Diego
was 4 of 13 on third-down plays).
If there was any doubt, that
LaDainian Tomlinson's fantastic career in San Diego is finally coming to an end, Sunday's
performance (12 carries, 24
yards) took care of it. As indebted as the franchise is to L.T., the
Chargers' refusal to involve
Darren Sproles more in favor of
their former superstar burned
them badly and appears to have
confirmed that, whether or not
he retires, Tomlinson will not
be a Charger in 2010.

Rhodes (8 tackles, 1 sack/forced

Men's basketball fails to maintain momentum at Ursinus
BY MARK CHIN

mchin2@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's basketball team tied both their
conference and total win tallies from last year by defeating
Dickinson at home 59-54 last Thursday. The win moved
them to 2-5 in the Centennial Conference and 3-11 overall.
The Garnet hoped to maintain this momentum in
Saturday's match at Ursinus College, but the team was
hampered by inconsistency on both ends of the court, losing to the Bears 75-54.
The team hoped going into the game that it would be
able to repeat its success against Ursinus, who the Garnet
defeated earlier in the season for its first conference victory, and move to 3-5 in Centennial Conference play.
For the first eight minutes of the game, it appeared as
though the Garnet would have a chance at reaching that
third conference victory, leading the Bears 14-13.
But then things began to unravel for the Garnet as the
Bears outscored them 32-10 for the remainder of the first
half and entered the second half With a commanding lead
of 45-24. From then, the Garnet was never able to recover
their initial momentum.
Despite finishing the game with seven fewer turnovers
and four more steals than the Bears, the Garnet had difficulty finding its offensive stroke and was unable to capitalize with the ball. The team tried to mount a comeback
but shot only 25.9 percent from the field and missed all five
three-point attempts in the second half, which allowed the
Bears to maintain a lead that never fell under 17 points for
the remainder of the game.
Will Gates 13, who led the team with 31 points in its
upset of Ursinus on December sth, once again led the
Garnet in points against the Bears, scoring 17 points in 33
minutes ofaction. Like the rest of the team, however, Will

was unable to find his shooting touch behind the threepoint stripe, where he missed all four ofhis attempts.
"The most crucial moment [of the game] was just the
entire first half and our inability to get back in transition
defense, allowing their big guys to get easy baskets," said
team captain Matthew Allen 'O9, who had seven points and
two steals for the Garnet. "We were taken a little off guard
because they defended us in a way we did not expect, but
we definitely did not execute our game plan well especially in the first half- in terms of our goal to limit transition and fast break points for them."
"We need to improve our shooting percentages and
rebounding," said Ryan Carmichael 'll, who scored 10
points for the Garnet. "We rank dead last in the conference
in field goal percentage, three-point field goal percentage,
and rebounding margin."
The loss to Ursinus leaves the Garnet at 2-6 in conference play, tying them with Haverford for Bth place in the
Centennial Conference and leaving them several games out
of playoff contention.
Coach Lee Wimberly, who was upset with the team's
effort on both offense and defense, commented on his plan
of preparation for the upcoming games against Haverford
and Gettysburg in the wake of the loss against Ursinus.
"We'llbe working on man-to-man defense and a little bit
of zone [for the upcoming games]. But it is also a problem
that our offense is getting stopped," Wimberly said.
"[Against Ursinus] we were supposed to cover better defensively and we didn't shoot the ball well the whole game."
The players also recognized the importance of the
upcoming games against Haverford and Gettysburg, both
-

members of the Centennial Conference.
"The Haverford game is a must-win now if we want to
claw our way back into the playoff hunt," Carmichael said.
"I don't think this game necessarily affects those

upcoming games because we would need to win them if we
had won or lost," Allen said. "But hopefully it leaves a bad
taste in our mouths so we can come out against Haverford
with even more of a chip on our shoulders."
After an away game at Haverford and another at home
against Gettysburg, the Swarthmore men's basketball team
will finish January with games at home against McDaniel
and away at Franklin & Marshall, also members of the
Centennial Conference.

.

Despite loss, Garnet ladies hopeful for playoffs
The Garnet women's basketball team
tied the Ursinus Bears on Saturday, giving
the team its third tie this season in on-the-

road Conference play. But after winning in
the final seconds at McDaniel and at
Dickinson earlier in the year on game-win-

ing shots from Katherine Stockbower 'll
and Ceylon Bodur 'll, the Garnet ended the
Saturday game with a loss, dropping to 3-6
in Centennial Conference play and 6-8 for
the year.
The Garnet entered Saturday looking
for its first three-game winning streak of
the season. Trailing by 12 with 4:43 remaining, the Garnet ran off 12 straight points,
tying the game on a Stockbower free throw
with 18 seconds remaining. But the Bears'
Alii Rosati was fouled with three seconds
remaining and hit both free throws as
Ursinus won 66-64.
The loss capped a rollercoaster week
that began withBodur hitting a game-winning layup against the Red Devils on
January 12. But Stockbower believes that
the loss to Ursinus will be strong motivation for the stretch run of the season.
"The loss to Ursinus definitely hit us
hard, but I think that after our initial disappointment we were able to step back
from our emotions and look at it as a learning experience. If anything, it forced us to
examine our weaknesses as a team and
made us even more determined," said
Stockbower, the Centennial Conference's
leading scorer and rebounder at 19.4 points
and 13.6 rebounds per game.
Pam Costello 'lO, a senior guard and captain, added, "Ursinus was a tough loss for
us, but we know that we need to stop
dwelling on Ursinus and really focus on the
upcoming game with all of our energy."
Even after Saturday's loss, the Garnet

16

finds itself just L 5 games out of the fifth spot
in the Centennial Conference standings
(the top five teams in the Conference make
the playoffs), a testament to strong play
since the start of 2010 and a renewed commitment to defense.

Coach Renee DeVarney, in her fifth year
on the bench for the Garnet, has been
extremely impressed by the defensive effort
of her team. "We've been playing much better defense since [the start of the New Year].
We had some good practices right when we
came back [from winter break]
and the
defense has really played a big part for us."
Since the start of the New Year, the
Garnet has allowed just over 54 points per
game while scoring almost 64. The players
recognize the defensive improvements as
well, as both Stockbower and Costello identified defense as the team's biggest area of
improvement since the start of the season.
"We made some major changes second
semester in terms of our team defense and
this improvement has shown in our statistics and records from second semester.
This semester we have held more than one
team to their lowest shooting percentage
and among their lowest scoring games,"
said Captain Costello, who is third on the
team in steals.
Stockbower also said that the team has
become mentally tougher as the season has
progressed. "In the beginning of the season
we consistently came out flat in the second
half, but now we are doing a much better
job of playing the entire 4$ minutes."
This improved toughness has spread
from the seniors all the way to the freshmen, who have made important contributions throughout the season. Madeline
Ross 13 is fourth on the team in scoring
and steals while Eliza Polli 13 scored 14
points in a critical win at home over
Franklin and Marshall. Katie Teleky 13
has been sidelined for injury for much of
...

the year, but the team knows that she will
contribute when she returns.
"All three freshmen have been great

additions to our team. [Ross] adds a spark
of energy every time she steps out on the
floor, Eliza is a consistent contributor, and
we are looking forward to having Katie
back once she is fully recovered..."
Stockbower said.
This increased depth has the Garnet
continuing to believe that they can make a
run at the Centennial Conference playoffs.
"...In the past, we haven't had as much

depth as we would have liked, and the
freshman have [really increased that
depth]. We don't have a weak link on the
team we have all good and solid players
who can play at any time," DeVarney said.
The Garnet, who defeated Haverford 5652 on Wednesday night to move to 7-8 overall and 4-6 in conference play for the season,
returns to action on Saturday, hosting the
Gettysburg Bullets at 2 p.m, at the Tarble
Pavilion. Action will be streamed live
online via the Garnet Sports Network
through athletics.swarthmore.edu.
