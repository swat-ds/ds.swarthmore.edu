Swarthmore College•Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

By Min

President Al Bloom announced yesterday that Eugene
Lang '3B, Chairman emeritus of the Board of Managers,
has decided to create a "Fund for the Future" for the
College with an unprecedented donation of $3O million.
The gift is the largest ever received by the College, and
according to a press release issued prior to the announcement, also one of the largest donations ever given to a
liberal arts college.
Mr. Lang has not designated a specific purpose for the
newly established fund. He hopes that the final applications of the gift will be "creative," mentioning a variety of
possible ways in which the fund could be used. Lang said
that he had some ideas in his mind, but did notreveal any
definite plans. "Thoughts have to germinate...they have
to be thoughtfully considered," he remarked. Lang expressed great enthusiasm towards working with the College in the future to decide the exact use of the donation.
According to Lang, the gift is to be made over an
unspecified time period, although theCollege has already
received over half of the total sum.
In the press release, Lang pointed out the uniqueness of
Swarthmore as well as his hopes and expectations for the
College students. "There is no college which more effectively challenges students intellectually while nurturing
active social conscience," he commented. "I have confidence that this investment in Swarthmore students will
help them become the kind of leaders that our country and
the world most need."
President Bloom welcomed the gift with excitement.
"This magnificent gift will open extraordinary opportunities for the College and for students and faculty," he
remarked.
This is the latest in a long history of donations to the
College by Mr. Lang, culminating in a total of around $5O
million. He had supported the construction of the Lang
Music Building and the Eugene and Theresa Lang Performing Arts Center. Lang has also contributed to numerous professorships and funded faculty research in the
past. The current visiting professorship for social changealso named after him—was endowed by Lang.
In 1980, Lang created the Lang Opportunity Scholarship Program, which aims to seek out students who have
a demonstrated leadership ability in working for social
change. The program, apart from providing complete
financial aid to the accepted students, also funds them to
carry out self-designed social action projects.
Lang's commitment to promoting social awareness
and change has not been limited to his contributions to the

Chorus Tackles Difficult Piece

Last weekend, the Swarthmore College Chorus performed what director John Alston described as "probably the most beautiful piece of music ever written:"
J.S. Bach's Mass in B minor. Directed by Thomas
Whitman and joined by members of the Early Music
Ensemble and other instrumentalists, the chorus sang
for more than two hours, taking the audience on a
journey from the tense, hesitant Kyrie to the peaceful
Dona Nobis Pacem.

On Saturday evening, the concert was deliveredto a
packed house, including more than 200 family members. Visitors were impressed by the energy and enthusiasm of the performance. One parent of a first-year
student was overheard saying, "That was positively
first-rate!"As Alston explained to Sunday's audience
of mostly students, "This was the most difficultpiece
that we have ever attempted and will ever attempt."

Last week, two female students were
assaulted near Wharton dormitory. In
response campus security has been increased, and students have been warned
to take safety precautions.
In a Public Safety Awareness Bulletin
which addressed the second incident,
Terry Narkin described the attacker as a
"Caucasian male, early to mid-twenties,
5' 9" to 5' 10",brown eyes, medium build,
no facial hair." The attacker was wearing
a green long-sleeved sweater or sweat
shirt, blue jeans, and a white UNC baseball cap. The victimreceived attention at
the Worth Health Center.
The second incident occured at approximately 12:45 p.m. on Friday, April

WSRN Elects Board

WSRN board members for next semester have been chosen, and for the first
time in more than five years two women
will hold the two top managerial positions at thestation. Jordan Hay '9B will be
General Manager, and Jessica Howington
'9B will be Program Director and Assistant Station Manager.
Hay is excited about the new board.
It is "amazing that two women will be
in command, because currently, at any
given meeting there are usually only
one or two women, and they are musi-

cal directors."
Also, next semester, the World Music Directors will be the current DJs of
Sabor Latino, Victor Piniero 'OO and
Theo Capriles 'OO, which means that
the "Latin Music Library should get a
lot bigger," said Hay.

Many members of the board will continue in their current capacities, including
Aaron Marsh '9B and Jeff Lockman '9B
as Traffic Directors, Chris DiLeo '99 as
HipHop Director, and Fred Bush '9B as
Non-Music Director.
The position of Classical Director is
contested by Eric vonWettberg '99, Sarah Wamester '9B, and Joanne Lin '9B.
New to the board are Justin Hall '9B
and Wilson Kello '9B who will be Promotions Directors. They have promised to
make WSRN the "soundtrack of
Swarthmore" by planning WSRN parties, assisting DJs with webpages, organizing pledge drives, and creating a jumbo
sized bulletin board in Parrish.
Next semester, Kevin Schlottmann 'OO
will be Jazz Director, Fred Veith '99 and

Engineer.

alone near the rear of Wharton, was
punched in the face by a lone assailant,
who thenthreatened her with more physical harm. The two assaults have instigated a cooperative investigation by Public Safety, the Swarthmore Borough Police, and the county's Criminal Investigation Unit.
Owen Redgrave, Director of Public
Safety, said that although "there have
been some promising leads in the case, to
share these and some of the other measures that are routinely taken would have
a tendency to compromise the investigation and would not serve the best interests of either the victim or the greater
community."
The WRC board and Dean Tedd
Goundie sent out separate e-mails warning of the increased danger to student

safety and asking students to avoid walking alone and to watch out for each other.
Students have been reminded to use
Safewalk, the shuttle, and Public Safety
to avoid the dangers of walking alone.
In addition, Garnet Patrol has been
cleared to fill extra shifts and should be
doing so to the greatest extent possible.
According to Redgrave, "some vacation
plans have been cancelled and we have
asked others to modify their schedules to
give us maximum [safety] coverage possible. In addition, special locking arrangements have been initiated, and police composite sketches of the suspect
has been posted around campus.

After nearly three hours of often circular debating, an
outburst by Budget Committee treasurer Vincent Jones
'9B, and flaring tempers, Student Council voted down the
controversial third amendment to their Constitution last
night, an amendment that would have given Student
Council final jurisdiction over Budget Committee. The
amendment was defeated by a margin offive votes, with
six members abstaining.
The amendment reads, "Nothing in Article IV, Section
I of this Constitution shall be construed to deny the final
jurisdiction of the Student Council over the Student
Activities Fund, nor specifically its its authority to allocate expenditures therefrom, and create specified endowments therein." After hours of debate, the amendment
was finally voted upon, with Josh Kramer 'OO, Chris
Seaman '99, Jeannie Gallego 'OO, Mandara Meyers '99,
and Rachel Henighan '97 voting against the amendment;

andNaiomiMichlin '9B, Alyssaßayman-Read '99,Trang
Pham 'OO, Sarah Schulman '99, Josh Alloy '99, and Sean
Barney '9B abstained from voting. Frank Mote Jr. 'OO was
not present.

The amendment was one of twelve proposed by an ad
hoc committee created by SC, and composed of Alloy,
Michlin, Kramer, and Barney. Ironically, none of the
authors votedfor theamendment. The other elevenamendments passed.
As the meeting crept into its third hour, Council members and observers became visibly agitated. Many observers left after a break two hours into the meeting.
Despite an all-campus e-mail sent to students earlier in
the day, only a handful of student observers were present,
predominantly members of Budget Committee and SAC.
In the meeting, rescheduled from last Sunday because

for the amendment. Barney started off the debate with his
reasons for proposing the amendment. He acknowledged
that "this year's budget experienceplayed a role in it," but
claimed "ithas been on the table for a long time." He also
said that "we felt BC was a very ineffective procedure."
The floor was then opened to non SC members. Jones
emphasized the fact that BC and SC both have some
power over each other. "I think the idea of checks and
balances are a good thing," he said. Healso noted thatfour

Recycling Bin Boat
Wins Crum Regatta
By

Nate Myers

There were more foreign objects than usual floating down
the Crum Creek over the weekend. The annual Crum Regatta took place at 11:00 am last Sunday morning, much to
the delight of a lively crowd gathered in the Crum meadow.
Despite overcast skies and chilly water, six crews completed the seventy-five yard course in a race which lasted
nearly fifteen minutes.
Even though competition was fierce at the beginning—especially near a shallow bottleneck in the creek—the order
of finish was decided only a few minutes into the race.
Taking first place (and theprestigious "LeifErikson Award")
by a wide margin was "The Recycler," a vessel commanded
by Tsong Lin'OO, Jenny Harvey'99, and Paul Dickson'OO.
Constructed out of watertight recycling containers, their
craft finished approximately ten yards ahead of their nearest
challenger: Phil Jones '99 and his entry, the "SS Walid."
Although spectators initially voiced concerns about the
sturdiness of his craft—a neat arrangement of Duct Tape,
Sharpies trays, and plastic bags—Jones managed to wrap up
the "Christopher Columbus Award for Second Place" midway through the race.

Saturday's outage occurred
when one of the cords connecting

out, causing Condor to automatically shut itselfoff. The water did
not reach any of the computers,
but the power cords, stored on the

had dried out before turning Condor back on. Wednesday's outage
also stemmedfrom water damage:
a network connection became waterlogged. It has since been replaced.

Mysterious Virus Identified
According to Linda Echols, Director of Worth Health Center,
three of four student stool samples were positive for a "cousin" of
the Norwalk virus. Researchers at the University ofNorth Carolina refer to this strain as as "Genogroup 2-Norwalk-like viruses."
According to Echols, most of the U.S. outbreaks they have
investigated during the past five years have been caused by this
strain.
Worth sent a total of six stool specimens, two of which were
staff members who tested negative. On Monday, Echols stated
that blood specimens from four additional people will be collected. It is necessary to get a blood specimen from an acute
patient (within a few days of symptoms) and a convalescent (three
to four weeks after symptoms appear).
Researchers at UNC and Duke plan to use the information
about this virus to write a brief paper on "Outbreaks of Norwalklike Viruses at Colleges and Universities."

Fisher '98 Wins Beinecke Scholarship
Jessica Fisher '9B, has won a Beinecke Brothers Memorial
Scholarship. The scholarship, which was awarded to 17students
nationally, provides $2,000 upon completion of an undergraduate program and then a stipend of $ 15,000 for each of two years
in graduate school.
The scholarship was established in 1971 by the Board of
Directors of the Sperry and Hutchinson Company to honor
Edwin, Frederick, and Walter Beinecke. The program seeks to
encourage highly motivated students to take advantage of the
graduate opportunities available to them. This year, 68 colleges
and universities were invited to nominate a qualified student,
which yielded a total of 51 nominations.

College.
Glater first conceptualized the idea
for the video at a Women of Color
meeting in the Spring of 1996. Since
then, she and Hope have worked together to interview over 50 women
from the student body, staff, and faculty. After collecting over 30 hours
of footage, the filmmakers edited their
extensive raw material down to produce the final 23-minute film.
Glater's and Hope's main goals in
making Voices ofColor wt to inspire
discussion and spread awareness in a
non-didactic manner. Although the
film is short, an large number of diverse and sometimes contradictory
opinions are expressed. As the filmmakers explain, "In many ways, the

video raises more questions than it
answers."
Among the issuesaddressed by the
women interviewed for Voices of
Color are identity, relationships with
people who might not share the same
background, political change and activism, and advice for the future. The
validity of the "women of color" rubric is also questioned.
Thursday night's well-attendedand
well-received screening was followed
by a chance for audience members to
discuss various issues the film raised
in smaller groups. Many thought that
Voices of Color did an excellent job
of addressing difficult issues that are
often too quickly overlooked at
Swarthmore. Other audience members felt that the documentary appropriately stressed the importance of
heterogeneity and different approaches to identity within the women
of color community.
Hope and Glater agree thatproducing Voices of Color was a wonderful
learning experience. Hope mentions
seeing her own identity as a Vietnam-

ese woman adopted by a family of
Irish and German descent in a new
light. Along similar lines Glater says,
"Most of us want to know that we
have a 'place,' but we don't want to
be stuck there, and we're especially
resentful whenother people try to put
us there."
Glater and Hope also emphasize
that Voices of Color is intended to be
"a starting point, and not the end."
Both acknowledge that, to a certain

extent, what has been recorded by
the video camera does not represent
the entire truth about race relations
at Swarthmore, and that ultimately

it is only through discussion and
dialogue that real change will be
enacted.
To begin facilitating this, the filmmakers have discussed tentative
plans to put Voices of Color on
reserve at McCabe and to screen it
at orientation activities in the fall.

The flooding was caused by
an act of vandalism, apparently
directed against College employee Don Reynolds, whoseoffice and work area are located
next to, but at a slightly higher
ground level than, the SCCS
room. A towel was placed over
the drain of a sink in Reynolds'
work area and then the faucet
was turned on. Water spilled into
the lower point of the SCCS
room. Ross Dickson '97, President of SCCS, noted the presence of a pump in the room, but
it gave out after several hours,
resulting in the flooding.
This is not the first time SCCS
staff have run into trouble this
year. Earlier in the year, they
ordered a new machine, Kestrel,
to replace Raptor, the original
World Wide Web server.

Kestrel, according to Marsh,
performed erratically over the
course of the year and finally
became "epileptic" over spring
break. SCCS returned Kestrel
to its manufacturer under warranty and received replacement
hardware. Said Dickson, "During these traumatic times,
Aaron Marsh has consistently

donated his time to keep the
machines running."
In response to the recent
problems, some of the people
who use Condor and Kestrel
regularly have mulled over the
idea of putting together an
SCCS-run computer center.
Justin Hall '9B and Evan Dorn
'97, two of SCCS's three
Webmasters, went to speak to
Al Bloom on Wednesday about
moving SCCS computers to a
different location. "We wanted
aplace wherepeople could come
ask UNIX questions, a place
where people could come work
on these computers," said Hall.
"There's cable running all over
the campus. It's just a matter of
finding a room...lt's hard to ask
someone to spend any time [in
the sub-basement], with all that
dustand no ventilation."Bloom
referred them to Larry Schall,
with whom they plan to meet
tomorrow. Dorn has also raised
the possibility ofrenovating the
sub-basement room and installing ventilation.
Currently seven hundred studentshave accounts with SCCS
and three hundred regularly receive e-mail on Condor.

Assaults indicate need for safety awareness
For the first time since many of us have been at Swarthmore, we have
reason to be afraid. Staring us in the face as we leave McCabe are
posted signs with the face of a man who attacked one of us. The most
frightening part of all is that many of us still walk out of the library
alone at midnight, still cross campus by ourselves after a party at Olde
Club to get back to Willets, and still walk under the tunnel to visit
friends late at night in PPR.
We get lulled into a sense of security very easily here at Swarthmore.
We like to feel independent and uninhibited, and it's generally pretty
simple to do so in a place like this where very little happens. But the
problem is that when real scares do happen on campus, many of us
don't take them seriously. We still don't lock our doors at night when
we're asleep or wait until a friend is ready to leave in order to come
home. We still don't listen to each other's stories with the concern that
the recent campus assaults call for. We don't necessarily report what
we might have considered to be a suspicious incident because we
assume we're simply paranoid—nothing happens here.
But it has happened now, and it must serve as a wake-up call to all
of us.
The campus does not make us feel unsafe, and we appreciate this. We
are not asking for 24-hour surveillance or armed guards at the doors to
every dormitory. But we do feel that before students begin thinking
more about safety, basic procedures need to be considered. First of all,
dorm phones are now equipped at the entrance to virtually every dorm
on campus. This means that there is no reason for dorms not to be
locked at least at night and even during the day as an extra precautionary measure. If campus patrol people do not have the time during their
shifts to monitor that these doors stay locked, then perhaps we need a
larger staff at Ben West.
Secondly, we have to question the sensibility of hiring students as
Garnet Patrollers or Safe Walkers to escort other persons to their cars,
dorms, etc. and then asking these students to return to their base
unaccompanied. If the point is that we don't want people walking
alone, then we must find the money to cover paying for two people to
cover each of this shifts so that they can stay in pairs. Perhaps it is an
even better solution forPublic Safety officers to be employed as Garnet
Patrollers or Safe Walkers.
A third way to improve campus safety is to increase the number of
lights on campus. There are several parts on campus, including areas
near Wharton, Beardsley, behind McCabe, and near DuPont that are
very dark at night. Student complaints have been voiced frequently
about this lack oflighting. We see no reason why these concerns should
not be further addressed.
We understand that Swarthmore is a very open campus. We have no
gates or official entrances, which makes it easy for incidents to occur.
In addition, the immense trust between students and desire to live a
more comfortable life here, which includes leaving buildings unlocked, may mean that such incidents will occur. We do not want these
characteristic aspects ofSwarthmore to be sacrificed because of safety
concerns. Atthe same time, we feel there are ways to preserve this open
commmunity and still respond to issues of safety.

Lavishness of Parents Weekend questions
College's motivation

You're hotand thirsty. You've just
finished four hours of Orgo studying
and a Psych attachment, and it's one
in the morning. The obvious solution
is to quench your thirst and resolve
your discomfort and, hey the water
fountain justwon't cut it. So, the next
best choice available to you is to fork
over the two quarters, the dime, and
the nickel to a brightly lit soda-vending machine. You walk down stairs
and find yourself confronted by the
seductively sweet image of red, blue,
and white wavy stripes. But, being
aware of world events, you bypass
the Pepsi machine and keep on searching for something else. Things are
looking good: you showed your support for the people in Burma and
refused to finance a company that
supported their brutal police state's
heinous abuse of human rights. Unfortunately, the swilling red and white
lines of theCoca-Cola machine don't
offer you any solutions or any comfort to your thirst or to the problems
of labor exploitation.
Here's why. Three years ago Nigeria, one of the most populous nations
in West Africa, was in the process of
creating a democratic government.
Despite the efforts of thousands of
people and the public outrage following his illegal actions, the demagogue
of the day, General Sani Abacha,
seized control of the government and
the nation by swinging the hatchet of
the armed forces at the democratic
elements and people in Nigeria. On
June 12, 1993, the military annulled
the results of the democratic elections and within six months, General
Sani Abacha declared himself the de
facto dictator of Nigeria.
During his regime he has nullified
the agency of the regular courts, restricting their ability to question the
actions of the government, while at
the same time corrupting the judicial
process and transforming the courts
into his tools for eliminating opposition. He and his supporters have dissolved the remaining political parties, arrested and imprisoned political dissidents and have muffled any
voice of pro-democracy opposition.
Like any good dictator, he has waged
a continuous and aggressive campaign to silence the alarms of community leaders and activists, trade
unionists, human rights campaigners
and journalists. AND IT DOESN'T
STOP HERE.
Under the guise of covert military
operations and often in clear view of
the public, he and his cohorts have
orchestrated a pervasive and effective means of repression designed to
stave off resistance to the environmental and social damage caused by
transnational oil companies. They
have forced tens of thousands to seek
refuge in other parts of the country
,

ers of Coca-Cola have profited
through General Abacha in the sale
of a valueless, and nutritionless softdrink at the cost of an average-day's
pay to the people of high populated
region where nutritional and financial resources are quickly disappearing from their grasp.
Coca-Cola has not spoken out
against these human rights abuses.
Despite the work of myriad resistance groups within Nigeria and the
declarations of several human rights
and religious organizations, CocaCola refuses to recognize the error of
singing 'Always Coca-cola' in Nigeria. How can we do the same? Swarthmore College has over eight million dollars invested in Coca-Cola.
We are very explicitly profiting from
their ventures in Nigeria and the death
of thousands. Our College, to which
we have given our time, our efforts,
our participation, and our money, is
investing (albeit through numerous
advisors and investment firms) our
gifts and our trust in the exploitations
of Nigerians.
We know that this Quaker institution had moral qualms about investing in South Africa; how can it pretend to not have the same disgust
with regard to its involvement in
Coca-Cola's illegal business practices? Boycotting Coca-Cola is a
start—the soda drink is one of their
many products, including but not limited to Minute Maid Juices and Sprite
Yet, it is the least we can do, and
perhaps the least possible and therefore effective measure for creating
change—given that a majority of
Americans drink more Coca-Cola
than water!
As consumers we must demand
that Coca-Cola divest from Nigeria
until a stable democracy with fully
participatory elections and popular
organizations is instituted. In the
meantime we must also ask and force
Swarthmore to reconsider where it is
investing (and who it is tacitly supporting) and to question the entire
blind investment process which allowed us to fall in line with CocaCola, General Abacha, and murderers as we march to the concession

Most of my information was found
thanks to the Free-Nigeria movement.

while an additional thousand have
been forced to seek protection outside the borders of their native homeland. All these people have been
stripped of their homes and their dignity. This full scale invasion into the
lives of Nigerians by General Abacha
has resulted in the death over three
thousand Ogoni, and the unrelenting
persecution oftheir community leaders and representatives. People are
tried and hanged at the discretion of a
military regime bent on the systematic destruction of Nigerian popular
resistance movements. This group of
thugs has attached a blue-dot special
ticket price on Nigeria, herresources,
and her people.
Companies throughout the world
have flocked to Nigeria, waving
extravalue coupons and voicing their
all-too-willing ability to ignore the
injustice that General Abacha, his
cohortsand these companies are committing. Coca-Cola is one of these
companies. It may not be the biggest
investor in Nigeria, nor is it likely to
be the most vocal or significant supporter of the military regime. However, it is there in Nigeria, showing
the people how Coca-Cola always
benefits from a bad situation. Within
the last three years of GeneralAbacha
reign of Nigeria's political and economic structure, Coca-Cola has enjoyed no less than a two-fold increase
in marketshare. The lucrative nature
of their investment in Nigeria has
increased to such an extent that Nigeria is now the largest market in the
entire continent of Africa. At first
glance, Coca-Cola's involvement
doesn't sound all too bad, and saving
your money from a would-have-been
Coke purchase doesn't sound like it
does the Nigerians a lot of good. In
fact, not buying that soda can doesn't
directly do much for the Nigerian
people. However, by denying CocaCola access to your money and your
support, you deprive the company
and General Abacha of increasing
influence and opportunities for exploitation. Coca-Cola, through its
Nigerian owned franchise holder
sponsors and supports events and
demonstrations organized by the military dictatorship of General Abacha.
In order to invest and conduct business in Nigeria, Coca-Cola must interact and favor the interests of the
military regime. By dealing with
GeneralAbacha and his subordinates
in any fashion, the Coca-Cola company, the world's most recognized
business enterprise, gives legitimacy
to his dictatorship. By investing in
General Abacha's vision of Nigeria,
this company gives him money to
buy more weapons and ammunition
to continue his purge of the Ogoni
people. Coca-cola is engaging itself
in a very blatant political agenda by
wedding its interests with that of a
dictator. The leaders and sharehold-

is rewarding, as I enjoy doing this.
But I doit only if I think I am promoting a value, while people likeClinton
think I should do it because I have a
duty to help others. This altruistic
view implies that my life belongs to
anyone whom I can help. By encouraging states to follow Maryland's
lead, Clinton wants to teach children
that their lives belong to the community, and enforce this ethic by law.
Can the President of the United

States say that it is our duty to serve
others, and sound noble and caring,
while if he said the same to a bunch of
women, he would be quite unpopular? Further, his ideas further ingrain
the sense of entitlement to people in
this country and discourages people
from me responsible for their own
lives.
Clinton insists on calling this community service "volunteer work."
This is inaccurate because mandatory volunteer work is a contradiction in terms. Clinton also insists on
calling his AmeriCorps volunteer
work. Yet, as the Libertarian Party
(http://www.lp.org/) wrote in its press
release:
"Clinton boasted that 50,000 young
people 'served their communities'
through AmeriCorps—neglecting to
add that they were paid a $7,400
annual salary, plus $9,450 worth of
college expenses. That works out to a
$7.27 per hour salary, plus medical
benefits and free child care.
In all, it's been estimated that each
AmeriCorps employee costs taxpayers $30,000 a year, once overhead,
administrative costs, and promotional
advertising are factored in."
Clinton is a master ofDoubleSpeak:
paid volunteer work is not volunteer
work. It's called a job. Clinton's
AmeriCorps is not volunteer work, it
is extortion: First, the government
makes college more expensive for
students in two ways: it takes our
parents' money in taxes, and inflates
the cost of education by increasing its
demand through interest free loans.
So if you want we our money back,
we can follow Clinton's orders and

serve in AmeriCorps. And what
choice to we have, as the S3OK per
year taken from tax payers decimates
the private sector jobscollege graduates can get.
Yes, but what if Americans do not
volunteer? Well, as the Libertarian
Party reports: "According to a 1993
survey, 48% of Americans volunteer
every year—a whopping 80 million
adults. In all, Americans contribute
19.5 billion hours of annual voluntary service." That's a lot more real
volunteers than Clinton's indentured
servants, and more, they do not cost
tax payers anything.
People volunteer to do things because they are promoting their values. For example, Swarthmore students who participate in community
service projects do not do this because it is their moral duty, I hope,
but because they want to simply make
the world a better place. In terms of
responsibility, people who do real
volunteer work are self-responsible:
they are taking responsibility for
achieving their goals. They are serving their own interests and promoting
their own values by helping others. I
appreciate people helping me when I
know they enjoy it, and will not want
people to help me out of some sort of
duty. Members of communities being served, I would think, share my
sentiments.
President Clinton wants to destroy
the benevolence expressed in the
volunteerism like that shownby Swarthmore students—and replace with
indentured servitude. Such a policy
will surely destroy good will among
people.

Prison Labor
Makes Sense
By Bryan

Gobin

Misguided prison advocates are upset about a very sensible policy of
allowing private firms to utilize prison
labor to contribute to society. One

writer mentioned that China banned
the import of jeans manufactured by
American prison labor. Since when
did China become so concerned about
human rights—before or after indiscriminately blasting away peaceful
protesters and sentencing political
activists to hard labor? Is there anything wrong with firms using prison
labor? Let's examine the status quo.
Some estimate that it costs $30,000
per year to keep an inmate behind
bars. Are prisoners really worth that
much? Society would be better off if
prisoners actually acquired some
marketable skills while in prison, especially considering the presentrange
ofinmate activity —networking with
other criminals, bodybuilding to become stronger criminals, and raping
each other. Anything corporate
America can do to defray the cost to
the taxpayer would be better than the
status quo.
Instead of worrying about abstract
rights in a system that rehabilitates
no one, prison advocates would better serve the interests of inmates and
society by developing policies to ensure that taxpayers receive a share of
the benefits, not just shareholders.
Although it wouldmake sense to consider the social welfare gains of skill
building and permanent employment
for inmates, this is probably not a
major concern for the public or
policymakers. Prison is the price for
crime. What is most important is minimizing the price that citizens pay to
exclude criminals from society. Besides, corporate involvement is far
more humane than anything proposed
by China or the state of Alabama.
Chain gains have reappeared along
the Dixie highways.

Student Council's Efforts and Achievements Deserve Credit Even When Controversy Arises

Student Council Supports SQU's Efforts To
Establish Changes to Roommate Questionnaire
To the Editor:
Student Council wishes to express
its support for Swarthmore Queer
Union's efforts in adding a mechanism for queer/queer-friendly identification on the housing questionnaire
for incoming Swarthmore students.
While the form and content of the
question remain under construction,
we feel that the motivation behind
this effort is important in encouraging the acknowledgment of queer
identity as a key component offriendships, living arrangements, and lifestyles.
Because the issues surrounding
sexual orientation are particularly
relevant to the physical and emotional intimacy of sharing a living
space, we believe that the Swarthmore administration should pay attention to this factor in the process of
assigning first-year roommates.

We support SQU's desire that the
administration help prevent queer students from encountering hostile living situations.Student Council hopes
thattheadministration recognizes this
request not as one for a special privilege, but as an expression of
Swarthmore's commitment to providing a non-threatening living environment for all students. Such a com
mitment demands the recognition ol
issues surrounding queer identity
which fundamentally influence the
physical and emotional comfort of
students living together as roommates.

Deans Explain Decision Process and Response to
Issue of Roommate Questionnaire Changes
To the Editor:
(This letter was sent to members of
Student Council)
I have shared your message with
the other deans who, along with me,
make thedecisions that affect student
life. As you know we are not changing the roommate questionnaire this
year. (It has already been sent to firstyears and several have been returned
to my office.) I did add two things to
the cover letter to respond to SQU's
concerns: mention that we are committed to having a diverse community in each residence hall with students from many groups, including
specific mention of studentswith differing sexual preferences, plus a note
that information on the questionnaire
is confidential.
Last week we the deans had a
roundtable discussion with members
of SQU about working to create a
safer environment for all students
including queer and questioning students. At that meeting we affirmed
our intents with a list of actions including addressing queer issues in

the Tri-Co summer program, in Orientation and in RA training. We also
agreed to meet with the same group
next fall to see the impact of the
several measures put in place this
spring to help new queer and questioning students know that they were
important members of this community and that activities take place to
make this a safer environment. Between now and then there will be a
review of what other campuses have
done and a look at various wording
possibilities. We do not want to have
unintended consequences of affirming prejudice, forcing people to come
out before they are ready or promising or raising expectations of things
for students that we cannot deliver.
We agreed to revisit the question next
year after a wider discussion among
various groups on campus.
I believe that all the conversation
brought about by this issue has been
healthy for the Swarthmore community. Thank you for your input.
Myrt Westphal,
Director of Residential Life

To the Editor:
For most of this semester, I have
read and heard many opinions about
Student Council. As a Swarthmore
student, I am very much interested in
my classmates' opinions. Because I
honestly beleive that my peers are
intelligent, mature adults, I take their
comments seriously. Andasacouncil
member whose primary responsibility is the welfare of the student body,
I try to solicit these opinions in a
respectful manner. I want to hear
about students problems so that I can
attempt to improve the situation.
Overall, I have tried to encourage
open dialoge and the distribution of
correct information within our recognizably diverse student body.
However, I am saddenedand frustrated by the controversy regarding a
proposed Amendment 111 to our Constitution. If passed, this amendment
would solidify the "final jurisdiction
of Student Council over the Student
Activities Fund." From the comments I've received this past week
and the discussion at last night's SC
meeting, I feel that several
misperceptions are held by the student body at large concerning Student Council and its role on this campus. I guess I'm writing to address the
view that Council is a slow, if not
stagnant, and quite useless bureaucracy that takes its time collecting,
processing, and distributing information. It is a negative image that
delegitimizes Council's role and denies the contribution of past and
present members to campus life.
Tthis negative image of Council
has basis. As attendantsoflast night's
meeting will attest to, StudentCouncil can be a frustrating organization.
For three hours last night, we deliberated on Amendment 111. During
most of this meeting, we talked about
how SAF funds were allocated in the
past, how it is distributed now, and
what could happen in thefuture pending the passage of this amendment.
Often, both supporters and dissenters
reiterated arguments that those familiar with Council activities already
knew. At the very end of the meeting,
Council voted that it would vote on

Amendment 111. That is, it did so
only after receiving about seven proposals to vote from members who
were supported by several irritated
student observers.
From an outside perspective, and
as so many student observers had
stated that night, Council was being
quite ridiculous. It really did not
need to rehash old arguments. After
long discussions, many people felt
that Council was ready to and should
vote on the passage of Amendment
111. To them, our stalling a vote in
favor offurther discussion was wasting their time. I can understand their
impatience since my time is very
valuable to me. I too wanted to vote
and to go home. However, I agree
with Alyssa Rayman-Read that I
don't see Council meetings as a waste
of my time. Rather, I am giving
valuable time to listen to valid concerns presented by students. Furthermore, I believe thatthe very nature of
Council's job demands that it be a
debating club. Because our policies
and programs affect the entire student body, we must examine these
proposals closely. For us to be effective, we have to value diverse opinions and that requires a lot of time.
I believe that press coverage of
Student Council is incorrect and unfair. Yesterday's Daily Gazette attacked Council for discussing an issue for three hours and then barely
taking action on the issue. As evidence, it showed that six members
abstaining. The Gazette also implied
that council's not taking a definitive
stance shows a lack of respect for
those student observers. I agree that
not being able to come to a concrete
solution is upsetting to those observers who attended but I disagree that
my action showed a lack ofresponsibility towards the student body. I
abstained specifically because I respected the opinions of my fellow
students. These opinions were voiced
by those with a certain view. They
made me see that sometimes what is
best for Council may not be what is
best for the student body. And although I support the spirit of the law,
I cannot support the wording given

thesubstantial concerns it raised. Had
I not respected that, I would have
voted yes to the amendment.
Initially, I raised concerns to the
Phoenix editors regarding their coverage. Naive me, I felt thatthis amendment was not a big deal until the
Swarthmore mediablew it up into the
controversy it became. I saw a problem with the lack of differing opinions quoted from Council members.
While there is a female majority
(seven elected women) on Council,
not a single word was quoted or a
single idea was summarizedthat originated from these seven women. I
argued that it was dismaying for a
responsible newspaper to not even
mention our other Co-Chair, Naomi
Michlin, who incidentally sent the
Phoenix a long letter stating her position and detailing several key arguments. Ironically, the only Council
members who were quoted were four
men with extreme positions. This
created a bipolar view of Council.
Those who were still undecided or
had doubts or stood otherswise on
this amendment were overlooked.
This led readers to the conclusion
that all of Council had taken a firm
stance on the issue one way or another. I was angry because thatwasn't
the case at all. Many members who
came into last night's meeting were
very much undecided.
In all fairness, this is where I bring
in Aarti'sand Kirstin's point of view.
Only after I talked to them did I see
how hard it was from their angle to
solicit anything from Council members. Because we are busy and sometimes hesitate to respond inappropriately, only those who felt strongly on
such an issue would respond.
That made me realize just how wide
the gap is between Council members
and basically everyone else. I do
perceive communication as a problem. The fact that we did not communicate and publicize our activities
well in the past is an enormous obstacle to changing our image. Indeed
our critics only have outdated information on our activities.
Nowhere is that more blatant than
Budget Committee's latest article to

the editor. In their opening paragraph, BC reminded us of Council's
past antics. I do not deny that these
things occurred in the past. But don't
makeit more than that, the past. Most
current council members were not on
when Joe Goodman ran that noncampaign campaign. We have inherited problems from our predecessors
but we did not ourselves create these
problems. I ask that students judge us
by what we are currently doing, not
by whatthe Council of three smesters
ago did. That's just not fair.
This semester, StudentCouncil is
accomplishing much that I am proud
of. We are writing a formal van
policy in response to student complaints. We are exploring shuttle
options to ML and PPR in the morning. We are mending estranged relationships with student groups. We
are researching ways to improve
Tarble and specifically Essie Mae's.
We have reinstated the "Take Your
Prof to Lunch" program. I am coordinating Sharpies 111, the new student organizations center. Among
other things.
I say these things not to point blame
about who started what but rather to
create some dialogue. Our outreach
has played a part in creating this
forum. We are striving to find ways
of informing students of our activities. We now have dorm study breaks
where we can talk to students who
would not normally come to our meetings. And last night's discussion
was, hopefully, a beginning of such
dialogue for Council to incorporate
student opinions into its policies. But
still, we are not reaching everyone.
When I accepted my position as a
Council member, I knew it entailed
open criticism from the entire community. But now, I feel that it is my
turn to respond. I want the student
body to see that I am attempting to
fulfill my duty in a reliable, productive manner. I think that SC's critics
need to be well informed about everything that's happening. I want to
challenge those critics to seek not
only flaws but to help us develop
answers to those flaws.

Fight to Save a City Black Racism Shows Liberalism's Flaws
By Sam Black
The Minnesota Daily
"Come home, Sammy. We're trying to save our city." Those are the
words my mother said to me on the
phone Thursday night.
I knew my hometown of Grand
Forks, North Dakota, was fighting
off the flood of the century, but I
downplayed the chance that anything
exciting (or disastrous) would ever
happen in Grand Forks. After all, I
grew up in that town, and it is routinely dull.
I had been skeptical of the coverage on the television news. The limitations of the cameras and the journalists let us see only the very worst
aspects, not really putting things into
perspective. So when I called home
and found out that the crest prediction was underestimated and that at
52 feet very bad things would happen, I decided I had better get home.
I rode a bus to Fargo on Friday
morning, and together with my girlfriend, Christina, we decided to attempt the75-mile drive north to Grand
Forks. Our drive was lengthened by
about an hour because flooding had
covered portions ofInterstate 29 north
of Fargo. Shortly past Arthur, N.D.,
there was a point where ND National
Guard troops slowed down traffic
and escorted us behind a military
Humvee. No passing. No speeding.
Things were orderly and it was clear
that there was tension in the valley.
When we pulled into town early
Friday night, things were still basically holding together. There were
people, including my brotherand father, tossing sandbags from arm to
arm, reinforcing levees that were protecting the bulk ofthe city. The background noise was constantly filled
with sounds of tractors and pumps.
Television and National Guard helicopters buzzed across the sky frequendy, and once in a whilethe town's
civil defense sirens roared.
My own house is high enough that
it was in no immediate danger, but
Christina's house was on the wrong
side of the secondary, or "contingency," dike. We were warned by the
city that if the primary dike broke,
their basement would be flooded.
Her family and I spent about three
hours hastily emptying the basement
and filling their living room with
furniture, old photographs, toolsfrom

her father's workshop and boxes of
books, childhood toys and clothes.
We would know it was time to stop
trying when their neighborhood was
officially listed in the "Mandatory
Evacuation Zone." That's a phrase I
had never heard before. It kind of
no-fly
sounds like a military term
zone, neutral zone demilitarized zone,
war zone
and if your house was in
it, you had to give up and leave.
It was about 2 a.m. on Saturday
when my girlfriend's house joined
the list. Thoughts were running
through my head like: Why didn' twe
grab this or that? Why didn't we start
packing up earlier? Could we have
saved the dikes if we had been there
to help sandbag?
Christina's parents grabbed the dog
and pre-packed suitcases. They
locked the door, and we got out of
there. The contingency dike went up
behind us, and we spent the night

At this college, there are those who
buy into these preposterous notions
and those who spread them. Vincent
Jones' articles fall into the latter category as his "column" seeks to "inform" us about the evils of the world.
Instead of information, what we get
is the paranoid, delusional, pseudointellectual rantings of a radical who
imagines that the evil juggernaut of
"White America" exists only to cruelly impoverish, marginalize, and
ultimately eradicate Blacks, as stated
in the March 21 article "Black Racism Is a Social Impossibility in
America," and the April 11 article
"America Should Take Swiss as Example."
In what is typical of the one-sided,
misinformed yellow journalism of
the liberal media in this country and
at this school, Vincent Jones' articles
spew forth incoherent thoughts, halftruths, and falsehoods, call them fact,
and expect everyone to fall in line
and believe them.
Among those "claims" is the assertion that "black racism is a social
impossibility in America." Vincent
attempts to "buttress" this claim by
saying that "I personally do not believe thatBlack people can be termed
racist given that White people enjoy
a monopoly of the political and economic power in this country." We
know of no dictionary that, when
defining racism, mentions anything
about power,be iteconomic or political. Racism has more to do with hatred and irrational prejudices than it
does power. Most dictionaries define
racism as a belief in one' s ownrace as
superior to others, usually related to
characteristics of that person's race.

The definition provided in Vincent's
article is simply a copout. A whole
group of people cannot be exonerated from being racist simply because somebody tells them they can't.
But let's assume for a second that
that definition of racism is correct.
Let's consider the KKK and neoNazi/Skinhead groups. There is no
doubt that these groups are racist. But
what power do these groups have?
How many Klansmen are there in
Congress? How many Grand Wizards are governors? How many white
separatists are the deans of prestigious colleges? How many Skinheads
head Fortune 500 companies? The
answers to all of the above is none.
But let's also consider the NAACP,
the Black Congressional Caucus, and
the Nation of Islam. Even though
these groups are composed of Blacks,
they do wield a considerable amount
of economic and political clout, a lot
more than the KKK or any Neo-Nazi/
Skinhead group.
And while we're on the subject of
the Nation of Islam, it should be to
nobody's surprise that Vincent's article maneuvered past the issue of
Louis Farrakhan being a racist. It's
really hard to claim Blacks cannot be
racist when Black America's selfannounced leader is himselfthe embodiment of this ugly blight. It is
obvious to everybody thatFarrakhan
is a racist (specifically anti-Semitic)
demagogue. He doesn'thide his message: it is blatant, strident, and repugnant to not only Jews, but any sensible human being.
Need further proof thatblacks can' t
be racist? How about the Nation of
Islam's Khalid Muhammad and his
disgusting speech at Kean College
where he blamed Jews for the problems of Black America and proclaimed "...If the white man won't
get out of town by sundown, we kill
everything white in South Africa. We
kill women, we kill the children, we
kill the babies...?" (as cited in Dinesh
D'Souza's The End of Racism) How
about Sister Souljah, who asked "If

black people kill black people every
day, why not have a week and kill
white people? (D'Souza) How about
the L.A. rioters who specifically targeted whitesand Koreans? How about
Tawana Brawley? She claimed to
have been beaten and sexually assaulted by three white men in a case
that made national headlines. In fact
Brawley had not been assaulted: some
of the details of the case were fabricated. However, when Susan Smith
pulled a similar stunt when she
claimed that her two young sons had
been abducted by black kidnappers,
she was condemned as a racist.
In last week's installment ofliberal
trash, Vincent's article lambasted our
country for not compensating slaves
or their descendants for the slavery
period in this country. Because the
Swiss government has decided to set
up a $4.7 billion dollar fund to assist
victims of the Holocaust, Vincent
feels that our government should
make similar restitution to the descendants of slaves. In his article,
Vincent writesthat our country should
set up a multi-billion dollar fund to
"underwrite programs and initiatives
aimed at improving education, infrastructure, access to home and business loans, college assistance, etc.
for primarily Blacks and other communities in need."
Don'thold your breath waiting for
this to happen. What you have here is
a case of apples and oranges. There
are many victims of the Holocaust
that are still alive today, many of
whom had money and property expropriated by the Nazis and put into
Swiss bank accounts during the war.
Compensation to them is justified.
However, there are two important
factors that make compensation to
blacks for slavery unrealistic: 1) there
are no Blacks alive today who were
slaves, and 2) there are no Whites
alive today who owned slaves. If
Blacks are to be compensated for
slavery, shouldn't Jews be compensated for 400 years of slavery in
Egypt? Shouldn't Christians be al-

lowed to sue the Italian government
(the successors of Rome) for pain and
suffering from the Ist century AD?
This whole issue of compensation
evolves back to this notion that the
government owes people something.
The only thing the government of this
country owes me or anybody else are
the things it promises to provide in
the Preamble to the Constitution.
Nowhere in that list is compensation
for slavery.
Week in and week out this paper
blindly prints the lies and anti-white
propaganda of Vincent Jones. We
havebeen subjected to gross and irrational generalizations made about
both Whites and Blacks. We have
been able to see into whatever world
Vincent Jones lives in. It is a world
where everything white is rich and
powerful and seeks to thwart every
positive move that the benign, powerless black race attempts.
This is simply not the case. The
lives ofBlack people are not manipulated by the evil white puppet-master. There is such a thing as free will,
and whatever happens in life is a
result of decisions that people make.
To assign blame for the lowly economic status of some blacks, the incarcerationrate ofyoung black males,
etc. on the evil influence of "white
devils" is foolhardy. Arguments like
those put forth in most of Vincent's
articles serve only to exacerbate the
racial problem in this country.
Vincent's articles frequently end with
the words "If you're not part of the
solution, then you' re part of the problem."
Incessant whining and finger-pointing, while at the same time not offering any real solutions to these problems isn't helping matters any. We
think that Vincent should carefully
choose his words when writing about
these topics. We feel thatthis systematic persecution ofWhite America is
very hypocritical, since it reeks of the
very racism that he ardently condemns.

Run For Your Life! It's the Giant
Terrifying Special Effects Snake!
By

Patrick "Silver" Runkle

Anaconda

is a true diamond.in the
rough. This movie, bad in almost
every possible regard, is also one of
the first true movie pleasures of 1997. It has
to be seen to be believed.
This is the movie with the menacing sanke
eyes on its poster. Written in huge letters on
the top is "When you can' t breathe, You can' t
scream!" as if it were some kind ofrevelation.
It stars Jennifer Lopez (Selena) as a director
making a documentary on the People of The
Mist (who?) in the Amazon Rain Forest. Ice
Cube plays her cinematogrpher, and Eric
Stolz is the scientist. Also on the boat are the
announcer and some production assistants,
pretty much coming along for the ride just so
they can be snake food.
Soon after they set off on their trek up river,
they come across Paul Sarone (Jon Voight), a
stranded Peruvian snakehunter, and things go
significantly downhill from there. As I'm
sure you can imagine, some of the people on
the boat don't make a return trip.
Now, Anaconda is not your average movie.
It is bad. Very bad. Most moments are completely laughable. But it has such charm, and
such a desire to be entertaining at all costs,
that it completely transcends normal criticism and turns into something truly special.
First, a word about Jon Voight. The man
deserves an Oscar for this movie. Voight has
made a comeback recently in Heat, Mission:
Impossible, and Rosewood, and so at first I

wondered what he was doing in a cheap
jungle knock-off of Jaws like Anaconda. But
he steals every scene he's in. He walks around
the entire movie with a goofy grimace plas-

tered on his face sounding like Al Pacino as
Tony Montana in Scarface. Virtually every
scene cuts back to his weathered, grimacing
face for no reason, and on two occasions the
camera pans to reveal Voight in the foreground staring right into the screen. He is
outrageously over-the-top, and such a delicious villain; I loved his performance.
Luis "Lucho" Llosa, the director, has shockingly found the right tone for this movie.

Llosa is the same man who inflicted the world
with Sniper and The Specialist, two stinkers
that barely made sense, let alone functioned
as competent action flicks. His movies were
deadpan serious in a misguided attempt to be
meaningful, but the overall lack of depth and
filmmaking skill made those films fall flat on
their faces.
Anaconda, however, knows thatit's campy,
and plays it to the hilt. The title character, the
enormous 40-foot snake which terrorizes the
characters (and occasionally eats them), is
not the kind of special effect spoken of as a
technological advancement. In fact, in most
scenes, it's faker than Jon Voight's Peruvian
accent. We see an obviously rubber snake
head flailing around, smashing through windows, etc. Whenever the more elaborate computer-generated snake graphics are used, the
snake looks completely different. But the
snake is entertaining because it does whatever it can to scare you, including many
things, I'm sure, real snakes would not even
think about attempting.
The snake's first appearance, when it eats
a panther or something, elicited a huge laugh
from the audience, as did most things coming
out of Jon Voight's mouth. It's that kind of
movie; you can go to the bathroom and come
back with the knowledge that you haven't
missed much.
The performances are generally servicable.
Ice Cube is especially good, but Jennifer
Lopez takes everthing a little seriously. What
are you supposed to do, though, in a movie
that feels it necessary to show us a regurgitated Anaconda lunch?
As a critic I feel powerless to do anything
about Anaconda, so I justgive up and join the
fun. So, please, throw your pretentious cinema-going mind out the window and have a
great timesoaking up some real movie magic.

Let's Jacques 'n' Roll
By

Fred Bush

So,

Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and
Living in Paris. Actually, he's not alive
and well. He's been dead for about ten
years. But themusic of the Belgian folksinger
lives on in a musical performance to be put on
in this weekend by director Andrew Bryce
'OO on Friday and Saturday at 8:00 p.m. in the
Intercultural Center. The musical stars Scott
Friesen '97, JulieSuh '97, Stephanie Dyrkacz
'9B, and Tom Stenson 'OO.
Jacques Brel is hard to describe; it's a
collection of 23 of Brel's songs, translated
into English and exuberantly acted out. Subjects vary from swoony love numbers to
rousing drinking songs to songs on the horrors of war, all with a vaguely European air of

coffeehouses, swagger, and romance. The
four principals sing together, in pairs, and
alone; dance upand downthe stage, simulate
a bullfight, and play dead. Plenty of sex, too.
The songs themselves, directed by Alastair
Thompson '99, are wonderful. Friesen's in
Sixteen Feet; Suh' s in Doppler Gang;Stentson
and Dyrkacz sing in the Chorus, with Dykracz
known as an alto soloist. They bring a lot of
singing experience to the musical, and it
comes through in the performance. Piano
accompaniment comes from Cathy Muller
'OO and Thompson.
If you find Jacques appealing, be warned.
The IC is an intimate setting; while it's cozy,
it's limited in seating: only the first 30 will
get seats; the rest will be on the balcony or
standing. Come early!

Swimmers Conquer Regatta
from Regatta, page 1

Sarah Bergstrom 'OO and their ship, "Shamu
with the Rocket Launcher," were waiting,
water pistols bared, forthecrewof the "Queen
of the Nile"—which took fourth place and
garnered the "Queen Elizabeth 111 Award for
Most Artistic Craft." Molly Jacobs '97,
Courtenay Dunn '97, JenniferKoermer '97,
Emily Mott '97, Tom Kornack '9B, and Jane
Ehrenfeld '97 managed to finish with their
elaborate "hammock-boat" upright and intact, despite some last minute difficulties
with the plastic bottles they had used for
flotation.
Finishing fifth was "Poppin," navigated by
Liza Dadone '97, Shithi Kamal '97, Shilpi
Chandra '97 and Eren Pultar '97. The umbrella-and-plywood structure lost nearly all
buoyancy towards the end as two large water
cooler jugs detached from the craft's underside, forcing the crew to carry whatremained

across the finish line.
Trailing the rest of the pack by several
yards was Rebekah Bundang '97 and her
entry, "Life's A (Parrish) Beach." Piloting
the only other self-propelled vessel besides
the "SS Walid," Bundang suffered physical
exhaustionbut retained her composure as the
gentle current carried her stately Adirondack
chair across the finish line.
According to Fred Swan, a College employee in charge of setting up the course and
filming the event, this year's Regatta made
up in quality whatit lacked in quantity. "There
were fewer people than usual," observed
Swan, "but the quality of seamanship was
excellent. The flotation devices were especially ingenious." Swan, who has participated in Regattas past withhis son, also noted
that "the water was cool, and it was down a
little from normal." Those prevailing conditions, Swan remarked, made the event slightly
more challenging than in years past.

Amar's NHL Sweet Sixteen Review
By

Barnaby, Rob Ray, and Brad May.
Despite the loss of Pat LaFontaine,
the Sabres cruised to the Northeastern Division championship.
The Senators earned its first playoff berth, largely on the strength of
Ron Tuggnutt, the NHL player of the
month for April. Alexei Yashin,
Alexander Daigle, and Daniel
Alfredsson spearhead a young team
that should only get better in the
following years.
This series, tied at 2-2, hinges on
the health of Hasek. A sprained knee
may keep Hasek out of the lineup for
the rest of the series, and the Sabres
struggled without him this year. When
the dust settles, expect the Sabres
heart to win out in a seven game war.
Philadelphia (3) vs. Pittsburgh (6):
This series should be called the changing of the guard. Mario Lemieux, the
world's best hockey player of the
past 8 or 9 years, is set to retire.
Health and family concerns have
forced Lemieux to call it quits at 31,
well before his prime. The Flyers
have Eric Lindros, the heir apparent
to Lemieux. Lindros has also had
health problems, but should he stay
healthy, his career should mirror
Lemieux's.
In this matchup of underachievers,
the Flyers hold a commanding 3-1
lead. The Flyers should close things
out on Saturday night, but it will be a
sad day for hockey fans the world

Frank Amar

Last Wednesday, the most intense,
winner-take-all tournament in all of
sports commenced as the NHL began
their annual two month duel to the
death for the Stanley Cup. As the
ESPN commercial implies, it's "16
suspects, 1 shiny motive."
The 16 teams assembled for this
year's blood sport all come in with
dreams of hoisting the most fabled
trophy in all of sports, but only a
precious few have a realistic chance
of sipping the champagne in mid
June.
With this in mind, let's take a look
at the First Round matchups already
in progress, starting with the Eastern

Conference.
New Jersey (1) vs. Montreal (8):
Last year, the Devils went from
champs to chumps. After their surprising Cup run in '95, the Devils
stumbledback to earth and failed to
make the playoffs. After winning their
23rd Stanley Cup in '93, the
Canadiens have failed to advance past
the first round.
These two teams are a study in
contrasts. The close-to-the-vest Devils play a conservative (boring) neutral zone trap. With the late season
acquisition of Doug Gilmour and
Dave Ellett from Toronto, the Devils
look a lot more imposing offensively.
The Canadiens play a free-wheeling
style that is more akin to the Western
Conference.Led by speedy forwards
Saku Koivu, Mark Recchi, and
Vincent Damphousse, the Canadiens
rely on their offensive firepower, leaving Jocelyn Thibault to fend for himself on most nights.
With the Devils up 3-0, look for the
Canadiens to put up token resistance,
bowing out in four games. Let the
housecleaning begin in Montreal.
Buffalo (2) vs. Ottawa (7): This
series features a matchup between
two teams without strong playoff
resumes. Buffalo hasn't won a first
round series since 1983, while Ottawa is making its first playoff appearance after four years of ignobility.
The Sabres have "The Dominator", goalie Dominic Hasek, perhaps
the best in the business. Ted Nolan's
squad, while short on big-name talent, relies on grit and heart, qualities
exemplified by forwards Matthew

over.

Florida (4) vs. New York (5): The
Panthers stunned the hockey world
by trapping their way to the Stanley
Cup Finals, before bowing to the
Colorado Avalanche. The nameless
Panthers are lead by goalie John
Vanbiesbrouck, who has carried this
team for the past four years.
The geriatric Rangers are lead by
Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier,
two veterans ofthe Edmonton Stanley
Cup hey day. Brian Leetch, the probable Norris Trophy winner, anchors
the blue line corps and Mike Richter
is a clutch playoff goalie.
The Rangers have jumped out to a
3-1 lead, also. After splitting 3-0
games in Florida, the Rangers have
ambushed the Panthers at Madison
Square Garden. Look for the Panthers to win Game 5, then get blown
out at the Garden in Game 6.
Western Conference
Colorado (1) vs. Chicago (8): The

defending Stanley Cup champs have
the deepest corps of forwards in the
league, an underrated defense, and
arguably the best goalie of the past
decade, Patrickßoy. The Blackhawks
look to be making one final run before descending into the abyss, much
like the Bruins did this year. Tony
Amonte is their only real offensive
threat, with Chris Chelios chipping
in some offense and a lot of heart
from the blue line.
Surprisingly, this series is tied 2-2,
with the home team winning each
time. These two teams squared off in
the Conference semis last year, with
the Avalanche winning in six. The
Avalanche should win a hard fought
Game 5, then triumph in Chicago.
Dallas (2) vs. Edmonton (7): Dallas, the Central Division champions,
rebounded from a horrible season in
95-96 to post the second best record
in the league. Head coach Ken
Hitchcock has preached defense first,
and has gotten more from this team
than anyone expected. Edmonton re
turns to the playoffs after five years
on the outside looking in. The small
marketOilers are led by Doug Weight
and Jason Arnott, two players that are
hardly mentioned outside of
Edmonton. Curtis Joseph is a quality
goalie, but has struggled in the playoffs throughout his career.
The two teams are knotted at 2-2
apiece, with the all important Game 5
on Thursday night. This series should
be 3-1 Dallas, but the Oilers rallied
from a 3-0 deficit with four minutes
left to defeatthe Stars 4-3 in overtime
on Sunday night. This entertaining
series should go the full seven with
Dallas coming out on top, but don't
look for the Stars to get past the
second round.Detroit (3) vs. St.Louis (6): Last
year, Detroit had the greatest season
inNHL regular season history, establishing league records for wins and
points in a season. The dream was
destroyed when Colorado upset them
in the conference finals. This year,
the Red Wings came back down to
earth, finishing in second place in the
Central Divisionbehind Dallas. While
Detroit's offense is still potent, concerns about their goaltending still linger. Mike Vernon, acquired from
Calgary to get the mover the hump,
hasn't donethe job, and Chris Osgood
has yet to establish himself as a

lomaniac coach/GM/czar Mike
Keenan in favor of Joel Quenneville,
who has won the respect of his players without browbeating them, benching them, or trying to trade them.The
Blues will only go as far as the ageless GrantFuhr will take them. In an
upset, lookfor the Blues to triumph in
seven, and lookfor big changes in the
Motor City.
Anaheim (4) vs. Phoenix (5): I'm
sure when Lord Stanley bought the
trophy that is now the Stanley Cup,
he didn't envision the sport being
played in the frozen wastelands of
Arizona and Southern California.
However, these two cities have embraced their teams with open arms
the Arrowhead Pond and America
West Arena are among the most raucous arenas in the league.
Anaheim barely missed the playoffs last year, and made good on their
vow to improve this year. The Ducks
finished second in the Pacific, a distant second to Colorado. Despite their
lofty rank in the standings, the Ducks
are a one trick pony. Teemu Selanne
and Paul Kariya have to be considered the most lethal one-two threat in
hockey with the impending retirement of Lemieux. However, if they
don't get it done, as witnessed in
Games 3 and 4, theDucks are doomed.
Phoenix, on the other hand.is slightly
deeper than Anaheim. The Coyotes
feature rugged Keith Tkachuk, a 52
goal scorer in the regular season. Providing scoring depth are Jeremy
Roenick, who slumped during the
season, diminutiveCliff Ronning, and
the ancient Mike Gartner. Oleg
Tverdovsky is a rising star on defense, and Teppo Numminen and
Gerald Diduck help to stabilize the
defense.

The difference in this series will be
Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin.
"The Bulin Wall" started 42 consecutive games to end the season, and
when he's on his game, he can be as
dominant as Hasek or Martin Brodeur
of New Jersey. I expect Khabibulin
to steal Game 5 in much the same
way he did in Games 3 and 4, and
then stop the Ducks in front of the
home "whites" (almost the entire
crowd at Phoenix wears white for the
playoffs) in Phoenix.

Tourney Reports
Men's Ultimate

'Worms Dig into Their Own Soil
By

Marco Rietveld

TheSwarming Earthworms played on Sunday the 20th to win their
home tournament against University of Pennsylvania's Void and
Haverford's Seven Deadly Sins. An unusual numberof Swarthmore
team members showed up to play in the eight team tournament,
originally intended to be the CentennialConference Ultimate Cham-

pionships.
Also included in the Tournament were Penn State University,
Johns Hopkins, Drexel, Bucknell, and Eastern College. Dave Lewis,
a senior 'Worm, organized the men's side of Tournament, while the
women's bracket as well as the food was organized by Gabi KruksWisner '99 and Kim Harter '97 of the Haverford/Bryn Mawr
Sneetches.
The first day concluded relatively well with wins agains a spirited
Hopkins, Drexel and Bucknell. However, against the rival Penn
State Spank, the 'Worms lost 13 to 8 although many of the older
better players were there. Michael Morton '97 and Lewis made their
usual stellar appearances, as did the two current captains of the team,
Sasha Clayton '9B and Dave Sacker '97. Acclaimed "Minister of
Defense" Robin Mandel '97 showed that the team was still in safe
hands as did Ali "Magic Hands" Momeni '97, who continued to
show that magic drive. The final scores were Johns Hopkins 2,
Swarthmore 13; Drexel 4, Swarthmore 13; and Bucknell 5, Swarthmore 13; all of which bode well for the upcoming College Sectionals
on April 26th and 27th.
Sunday morning, with some players a wee bit hung over from the
Ultimate party held at ML, play started out slowly against the Void,
who unfortunately lost some better players to the raging Spring Fling
held on U. Penn campus that weekend. In the end, the 'Worms
persevered with a score of 13-8. Thereal game began at 12:30 on the
football field against the 'Worms favorite rivals: the 'Fords. Although Haverford had only three substitute players as opposed to
Swarthmore's Bor 10, their skill and stamina proved to be a tough
challenge up until the end of the game. The good spirit and love of
the game brought up the level of play to one that has not been seen
by this reporter since the game against University of Delaware at
Maryland.
However, after the half-timebreak at 8-7, Swarthmore, the 'Worms
broke away to win 15-10. The win could also be attributed to the
Warmothers' heckling throughout the game.

Women's Ultimate

Warmothers Visit Enemy Territory
By

Erika

Baumgartner

Last Saturday as many of you were enjoying the sumptuous
Sharpies Parent's weekend brunch, the War Mothers were out on the
Featherbed Fields at Haverford roughing it with bagels and oranges
and a little frisbee. The Swarthmore and Haverford ultimate teams
co-hosted men's and women's tournaments last weekend, with the
men playing at Swarthmore and the women at Haverford. The
WarMothers had a successful weekend, coming off of their one day
tourney with a 3-1 record.
The Mothers started out strong against Bucknell. The entire team
played solid defense, contributing to the 11-2 win. Courtney Harter'97
and Lena Loe wenthal' 97 fed the disc timeafter timeto players in the
endzone, splitting 8 assists between the two of them. Leading the
scoring were the sprinting wounded, Katy Harrod '97 and Mandy
Hourihan '9B, who played incredibly well all day despite repeated
injuries. Next came quite possibly the world's longest ultimate
game, fought up and down the field against a savage six woman team
from Penn State. Thanks to hot defense from Gena Merliss '97 and
Gabi Kruks-Wisner '99 (who had a layout d-block in the endzone!)
and the scoring prowess of Anna Sugden-Newbury, the mothers
once again prevailed 9-6.
Next came Drew, who decided to throw a zone in the moderate
wind. Swat ripped it apart, coming up with a 9-4 win. Laura Fanucchi
'OO was a scoring machine, impressing her parents on the sideline.
When another teammate scored after Laura's first three in a row, the
sidelines chided her for interrupting Laura's flow. Profuse apologies
were made and the play resumed. The Mother's Karma-D was hot
and Dclila Leber '9B was all over the ground after discs, including
one successful but not as graceful layout that Merliss called"the face
bid."
The last game was a hard fought battle in the increasing wind.
Despite their towering defensive cup of Sugden-Newbury,
Baumgartner and Merliss and an only slightly slightly shorter one
(made up of the ever-studly Parker, fashion queen Lieber and the
notorious Miss Herzog) the Mothers came up short against UPenn,
losing 4-10. Emily Rice-Townsend '9B played some hard defense,
and Simone Brant '99 was a solid handler against Venus's zone.
Unfortunately, time did not allow for a game against Haverford.
However, the Sneeches showed up at Swarthmore later in the
evening for the tournament party (which Swarthmore won). A fine
time was had by all, and the Mothers are looking forward to
Sectionals this weekend at Princeton, where they are hoping to make
the other teams eat ricotta.

After a ten hour bus ride from
Maine, the members of the outdoor
track and field team from Bates College arrived at Swarthmore on Tuesday afternoon. One by one, each member of the Bates team was matched up
with a member of the Swat track and
field team to spend the night with due
to a low budget. "It was a little strange
becoming friends withthe people we
were going to be competing against
the next day," one team member ex-

plained.
Coach Ted Dixon is a graduate

from Bates College and was extremely enthusiastic about a competition against "his" school. Some
membersof the team wonderedwhich
side Dixon would be on during the
competition, but he made his posi-

tion clear during the team meeting, "I
know I graduated from Bates, but
we've gotto beat them!"Fortunately,
the Swat team lived up to Dixon's
expectations at the meet Wednesday
afternoon where Swatand Bates were
joinedby teams from Bryn Mawr and
Widener. Both the men's and

women's teams won the competition
with the men finishing with 83 points,
24 points ahead of Bates in second
place, and the women obtaining 70.5
points.
Brian Baird '99 won the pole vault
reaching a personal best height of
14'3". Swat led the javelin competition with Will Dulaney '97 finishing
first at 168'3", Eric Walton '97 in
second at 167' 10" and Mason Tootell

Women's Rugby Knocks Down Competition
By Amber Halsey

Philpott

This was a momentous weekend
for Swarthmore women's rugby. The

A-side squad took its record from 50-1 to 10-0-1 and won the championship at the West Chester Tournament. It is remarkable that this team,
which ended its fall season at 0-6
managed to capture a championship
by shutting out all of their opponents

with a cumulative score of 85-0. Even
more astounding is the fact that only

IS points have been scored against
Swarthmore's 157 all season.
The team played a total of five
games in two days, which is an inconceivable amount of rugby in a compressed period of time. Itis important
to note that Swarthmore was the only
uncoached team at the tournament
and was considered the underdog.
The first team failing to score
against the Swat ruggers was
Shippensburg University, who lost
by a score of 15-0. The three tries
were scored by Sarah Cross '99, Beth
Vose '99 and forward captain Hanan
Hussein '97. After warming up with
their first win, Swarthmore played
West Chester University's second
squad and defeated them by an unheard of score of 50-0. Six Swarthmore ruggers plowed into the tryzone
10 separate times in only 40 minutes:
Andrea Barnett '97, back captain,
scored twice; Vose scored twice; Jen
Philpott '97 also scored twice; Amber Halsey '9B, Christina Costas '99,
Bridget Arbour '9B and Meghan
Brennan 'OO, all scored once. By far
the most exciting moment in the game
was the try scored by full back

Brennan as Giovanna Giuliani '97
screamed, "Meghan I want you behind me," and passed her the ball to
score. Even the referee was excited
for Brennan and Giuliani.
The number of points scored on
Saturday determined the seeding for
the next day. Thusly, Swarthmore
was in first place at the beginning of
the Sunday competition. Due to the
fact that the women ruggers were #l,
they were forced to prepare at the
unholy hour of 7:30 for a 9:00 am
game against West Chester's first
team. Given the fact that WestChester
was hosting the tournament, they were
hugely disappointed by their 10-0
defeat against a team that was not so
bright-eyed and bushy tailed. The
first half remained scoreless, and
Swarthmore played an amazing defensive game. Of partlicular importance was Joan Hoffman '9B, with
her towering height, who blocked
many of the opposition's kicks, allowing Swarthmore to keep the ball
away from their try zone. In the second half, after a motivational half
time pep talk by the captains,
Swarthmore's offensive skills kicked
in, taking West Chester completely
by surprise. Philpott, the stupendous
scrum half, aggressively drove the
ball into the try zone two separate
times in 5 minutes, dragging most of
the opposition with her to score the
only points of the game.
This win allowed Swarthmore to
play in the semi-final round against
UNC, Chapel Hill. Although Swarthmore was very nervous, UNC was
vocally very confident about their
ability to crush the Swarthmore
ruggers, as they had the rest of their

opponents. However, Swarthmore
came away victorious yet again with
a score of 5-0.
The only try ofthe game was scored
by Hussein, who received the ball
from Philpott after an amazing
rucking drive by the forward pack.
Swat not only outscored UNC, but
also completely decimated their
scrum, forcing the referee to institute
an uncontested scrum rule for the
safety of the UNC team.
After sealing their berth in the
championship game against long time
rival University of Delaware, Swarthmore had a three hour break in
which the fatigued team tried to relax
and prepare for their toughest match
all weekend. This spirited squad used
the time to cheer for other teams,
including Delaware.
Swat'sruggers not only had to overcome their pain and exhaustion in
orderto mentally prepare for the final
game, but also the fact that they had
not beaten Delaware in at least four
years. Lara Estroff '97, who supported her teammates from the sidelines, offered some words of wisdom, "We have already proven we
are champions because we have
played with more heart than any team
I have seen. No matter who wins this
game, we have shown all the competitors that we are awesome!"
Given that Swarthmore had
watched and cheered for Delaware
all weekend, they knew the threat
posed by Delaware's back line.
Giuliani, outside center, was frantically chanting before the game, "I
can tackle Alison," referring to
Delaware's All Star legend inside
center. Giuliani not only shut down

the Alison powerhouse, but also
proved to be a threat herself to
Delaware's team. Fly half Courtney
Clark '9B, Barnett and Giuliani eliminatedDelaware's back line whilerunning and kicking with great skill.
Vose and Brennan helped to annihilate Delaware's offense by fielding
and running back all of the
opposition's kicks. Rookie Kira
Cochran-Bond 'OO provided the only
five points of the gameby being at the
right place at the right time, so as to
receive the ball from the forwards
and score from her wing position.
This try was particularly impressive
considering the fact that CochranBond was debuting on the A-side
team that Sunday.
Swarthmore's game strategy was
to keep theball away from Delaware's
backs and dominate withtheir potent
forward pack—and they did just that.
Not a single scrum was lost as hooker
Halsey won her own balls and spoiled
many of Delaware's feeds. Swat was
just as impressive in line outs as
Arbour and Pia Houseal '97 won all
of Swat's throws and several of the
opponent's.
There was no doubt that Swarthmore had earned their 5-0 championship win. When the trophy was
awarded to the beaming Swatties,
they were commended for shutting
out all of their opponents.
In addition to this tournament win,
Hanan Hussein was named Most
ValuablePlayer ofthe tournament by
the coaches and referees who commented, "Hanan, you are amazing
and we wish that we could give this
award to your entire forward pack for
their epiphanal performance."

One Tide Broken,
Another Starting
By Frank

Amar

The season is drawing towards a
merciful conclusion for the Garnet
Tide, and not a minute too soon. This
season has been a constant nightmare. For the seniors, it is reminiscent of the 5-28 and 10-27 debacles
of 1994 and 1995. For the youngsters, it hopefully will be a valuable
learning experience, one that they
can leave behind when they go in
search of winning records over the
next few years.
That journey to respectability began last Saturday in Gettysburg, PA.
By all accounts, considering their
dismal play of late, this looked to be
a Gettysburg sweep. Playing in conditions that seemed more appropriate
for Candlestick Park in San Francisco, Steve Farneth 'OO earned his
well-deserved first college win, a
complete game 7-2 gem. Farneth continues to be one of the few bright
spots on the mound for the Garnet
Tide, as he struck out five and walked
none en route to the victory, which
snapped a nine game losing streak.
Also in that game,scrappy rightfielder
Joe Aleffi 'OO was hit by an NCAA
record four pitches, upping his team
leading total to 14 this season. The
GarnetTide returned to familiar territory in Game 2, losing 8-5, despite
two doubles from Pat Straub '97.
That loss started the downward
spiral once again. On Sunday afternoon, Muhlenberg came down from
Allentown to make up Friday' s game
which had been postponed due to

inclement weather. The Mules made
short work of the Garnet Tide, leaving the scene of the crime with an
embarrassingly easy 29-3 victory.
Once again, the Mules had some help
the Garnet Tide committed eight
errors. Straub and Carlo Fitti 'OO provided the lone offensive highlights,
each chipping in with two hits.
The Garnet Tide did battle with
Trenton State and Mother Nature on
Monday afternoon. Emergency starter
Doug Rouse '9B turned in a good
outing, allowing only two earned runs
in 5.1 innings. On this drizzly day,
the defense
six errors accounting
and the
for five unearned runs
offense
two measly hits and three
runs
betrayed Rouse, as the Garnet Tide fell 7-3 in a game shortened
to six innings by rain.
Tuesday afternoon, the defending
conference champion Ursinus Bears
were in town. Jeremy Bonder '97 and
Farneth limited the Bears to only one
earned run over nine innings, but
once again, it was four unearned runs
thatcaused the damage. Aleffi (2-4,1
run) and Straub (3-4) hit well, but
wasn't enough as the Garnet Tide fell
once again, 5-1.
This weekend, the Garnet Tide finishes off their season at Ursinus today before hosting Haverford tomorrow.
For the seniors, it will be one final
chance to play ball and possibly leave
the field a winner. For the younger
guys, it will be a chance to showcase
their talentand make one last impression for next year.

Haverford Beats Women's Tennis Women's Lax Soaring High
By Wendy Kemp

On Wednesday afternoon, the

women's tennis team played their
last game of the season against longtime rival Haverford College. The
match took place at Haverford, where
rain forced the team to play on the
unusually hard and fast gym floor of
the 'Ford fieldhouse, giving the
Swatties a disadvantage from the start.
Despite having theentire team present
including all six regular starters,

Swarthmore fell to Haverford 2-7.
The first win came from the third
doubles combination of Elena
Rosenbaum '9B and Wendy Kemp
'99. Rosenbaum and Kemp were up
7-4 in mid-way, but lost some ground
and were forced into a seven point
tie-breaker at 8-8. After close rallies
and bad line calls, Rosenbaum and
Kemp swatted Haverford 7-4 in the
tie-breaker, 9-8 overall. The second
win ofthe day was posted by Kemp at
sixth singles 6-0 6-2, bringing her
final conference record to 8-2.
Neena Shenai '9B battled hard at
both singles and doubles. With Rani
Shankar '9B, Shenai brought Haverford to a standstill in her first doubles
match before losing by a narrow 5-8.
At second singles, Shenai forced her
opponent into a third set by winning
her second set 6-4 after losing the

first.
The third and final set lasted the
longest; however, Haverford won
with a close 3-6. Nga Lai '97 played
well at fourth singles, winning eight
games against her Haverford opponent.

This weekend, some team mem-

bers will journey to Washington College for the annual Centennial Conference championships. Three singles
players and one doubles team are
allowed to enter.
Overall, the year has not been a

for the team; with a 2-8
conference record, the women look
forward to improving next year. Howgood one

ever, both first and fourth seeds

Michelle Martinez '97 and Lai, will
be graduating in June, leaving the
team two starters short.

Staying in the Fight
By

Jean Quinn

Swat Softball had a long break and
played only one game against Widener this week. The Garnet fell to
their local competitor, 12-4, in the
bottom of the sixth inning, taking
their record to 2-23 overall.
The team had the weekend off and
returned to practice earlier this week
only to be hindered by poor weather

conditions.
A slick field complicated the defensive end, and the heavier, wet balls
were troublesome for the pitching
machine to handle. Nevertheless, the
Garnet persevered and madethe most
of their practice time.
Wednesday's match against Widener was a rainy one. On the mound
for Swat, Dana Lehman '9B gave up
15 hits. Widener found the holes in
the field and forced Swat to play the
ball cleanly. Lacking aggression and
crispness, the Garnet's defense allowed five unearned runs to score.
Coach Cheri Goetcheus commented on a few shining moments in
the field, "Lurah Hess '99 came up

with a key double play in the bottom
of the fifth, by catching a spinning
ball just over first base and then outrunning the base runner, who was
only two steps off 18. Michelle Walsh
'9B had a bullet throw to third base to
nail an advancing runner in the bottom of the fourth to end that inning."
Offensively, Jen VanderVeer '99
nailed a single into left-field, walked,
and recorded one stolen base. Jean
Quinn '99 doubled on a shot into
right-centerfield, drove a run in, and
scored one run.
Lehman picked up an RBI on a
single of her own and also had a
sacrifice bunt. The offense was sporadic, and a number of runners in
scoring position were stranded as the
Garnet were unable to come up with
more hits in clutch situations.
Remaining on the Garnet's schedule are doubleheaders against Centennial Conference foes Franklin and
Marshall and Haverford. Swat softball finish their season on Saturday at
lpm against the squad from Haverford where Senior Nette Witgert will
play her final games.

The women's lacrosse team had a
busy schedule this week playing three
conference rivals. The first gamelast
Saturday was away against Franklin
&
Marshall where the Garnet
pummelled theDiplomats with a score
of 17-6. Besty Rosenbaum '9B led
the Garnet with 4 goals in that game.
Senior tri-captain Kristen Osborne
collected three goals and an assist.
Holly Baker '99 followed the example and garnered a hat-trick and
one assist as well. Goalies Jane
Kendall 'OO and Kate Doty 'OO stood

solid in the cage where combined
ihey made twenty-one saves against
the F&M offense.
Swarthmore continued their scoring flurry in the following game on
Tuesday againstBryn Mawr College.
Alicia Googins 'OO added to her scoring with five goals in addition to the
three she had put in the goal against
F&M. Osborne went on the boards
with four goals and two assists, while
Rosenbaum collected four goals and
one assist.
Baker carried on her scoring streak
with three goals and two assists.
Ch'uya Hornberger '97, Samantha

Peltz '97 and Laura Starita '97 continued their consistent play with one
goal each. Kelly Wilcox, heading the
sturdy defense, talliedsix ground ball
controls. Peltz and Ernst also controlled six ground balls as well. Doty,
playing the entire game, made eleven
saves against the Mawrters, which
maintained the landslide win with a
score of 20-7.
The Garnet next face Washington
College tomorrow on Cunningham
Fields at 1:00 p.m. and will finish
their season playing arch-rival Haverford Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 p.m.
on Cunningham Fields.

Men's Lax Looking for a Win
By Aaron Hultgren

This past week the men's lacrosse
team could not find their first season
win. Due to injuries and illness, the
Garnet were only able to suit up 17

players. On Saturday, they faced
Gettysburg College. Although
Gettysburg hoped to obtain a spot in
the NCAA Division 111 playoffs, the
Garnet jumped out to a 1-0 lead off a
goal from co-captain Pat Donaughy
'9B assisted by Toby Patterson 'OO.
Goalie Ben Henwood '97 and the
Garnet Defense consisting ofco-captain Aaron Hultgren '9B, Tucker
Zengerle 'OO and Nimish Dave '99
were able to hold Gettysburg to one
goal in the first quarter. The Garnet
kept the pressure on Gettysburg and
went into the half down 1 to 5.
Coach Gress remarked that this

was "the best half oflacrosse that has
seen played at Swarthmore in his two
years of coaching". But after four
quarters Gettysburg won 17-1.
However, goalies Hen wood (19
saves in three quarters) and Sig
Rydquist 'OO (6 saves in one quarter)
put impressive statistics and helped
the Garnet earn the respect of their
ranked opponent.
This Wednesday the Garnet faced
a tough Widener team. After having
played two ranked team the past week,
the Garnet wanted to capitalize on a
tough schedule and obtain their first
win of the season. Widener's run and
gun style had continuously run up the
score on its opponents.
The Garnet hoped to rely on a defense that had proven able to play
against the best in country. Unfortunately, Widener took a 3-0 lead in the

first quarter. In the second quarter,
Steve Shin '9B found the goal for the
Garnetand in theprocess put a hole in
the net. Widener took a 4-1 lead at the
end of the first half.
In the second half, the Garnet were
unable to find the net as Widener
slowly began to run away. Widener
was able to come away with a 9-1
victory over the Garnet. Goalies
Henwood (6 saves) and Rydquist (11
saves) along with solid defense from
Alex DeShields' 98 and Zengerlekept
the Garnet close.
With only one game left, time appears to be running out for the Garnet
to get their first win of the season.
However, the Garnet are excited about
their upcoming visit to Haverford,
and the prospect of getting their first
victory at expense of arch-rival
Haverford.
