Student Council tables ammendment to SBC process
BY MATT BLEIMAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

A controversy recently emerged between the Student
Council and the Student Budget Committee over SBC's
process of appealing decisions regarding receipts. Student
Council is considering an amendment to their constitution
to change the way such issues are handled, though they

recently tabled the issue.

Members ofStudent Council were concerned that cases
have been brought up in which students were rejected
reimbursement of large receipts because they bought
small-cost personal items, such as coffee or a sandwich, on
the same receipt that they bought materials refundable by
SBC.
According to the current regulations, SBC can either
accept the appeal for repayment as stated or reject it.
Student Council wants to change the language of the laws
so that there could be partial receipt refunds for purchases
if a student accidentally bought personal items on the same
receipt.

The right to an appeal is already an explicit part of the
SBC bylaws, and those seeking reimbursement from SBC
are reminded of that right. If an individual seeking reimbursement is unhappy with a decision made by any of the
focus funding groups he or she can appeal to SBC and after
that to Student Council.
There are certain receipt issues that are unlikely to be
successfully appealed to SBC, however. For example, if one
disobeys the rules of the Social Affairs Committee, then
SBC is obligated to refuse reimbursement offunds.
Paul Apollo 'O9, who serves on Student Council as
Student Groups Advisor and also on SBC, said that there is
a rule against crossing items off a receipt before handing it

in. "People do that occasionally, not very often, and SBC
says you can't have your money so they appeal that to
Student Council," he said.
According to the Student Council's constitution,
Student Council can either reimburse all of the money or
none of it when they hear an appeal.
This becomes a problem when Student Council mandates that SBC gives back all of the money to one person
and then sets a precedent that others will see and may try
to exploit. Apollo said that in the past students sometimes
manipulated receipts to buy alcohol with SAC money.
Student Council wants to be able to give back a portion
of the money but not all of it in cases where personal items
are on the same receipt as refundable ones, potentially to
find a work-around for the problem of precedent. Council

NEWS

members recently discussed a system where students
would be reimbursed for a portion of their receipt and be
levied a fine, but not lose all the money for a simple mistake.
"Student Council would be able to change the amount
on any funding decision that SBC made because it would
have given Student Council discretionary power over how
much money to give anyone [under the proposed ammendment]," Apollo said. According to Apollo, individuals seeking reimbursement would then be able to ask Student
Council for more money if they were not happy with how
much they received from SBC.

"Since the two-week line is pretty
much an arbitrary line [SBC] has
decided to move to a system whereby
you'll be fined a certain percentage of
the receipt for every week you're late."
Paul Apollo 'O9
Student Groups Advisor
SBC Member
...

The tenor of Student Council's current appeal-granting
power suggests that thisfunction is to ensure that any egregious mistakes by SBC, such as large breaks from precedent and SBC bylaws, can be corrected.
However, SBC wanted to know that Student Council
trusted them to make the right decisions. "We on SBC felt
that we were better stewards and it was our job to make

that kind of decision," Apollo said.
Student Council President Peter Gardner 'OB said that
he agreed with SBC, as SBC exists specifically to deal with
the money issues and it would be "redundant" if Student
Council also served this function.
"From Student Council's point of view, the reason we
didn't go ahead with [the ammendment] is because SBC
made very compelling arguments [and] we don't necessarily want to take on that. There is a reason that we delegated that responsibility," Gardner said.
Furthermore, Gardner worried that this would increase
the time Student Council would have to spend overall on
...

...

appeals.

IN

In addition to Council's worries about having too much
power over SAC money, they also heard SBC's concerns.
SBC sent an open letter to Student Council addressing
their objections to the amendment, which indicated that
the amendment undermined the purpose of SBC. The letter

claimed that SBC is more knowledgeable of the budget and
bylaws and better equipped to render fair judgments.
In the concluding statement, the letter reads, "[The SBC
bylaws] not only act as a 'checks and balances' system for
student government, but also ensure that each specific
decision is made with the utmost knowledge and objective
judgment so that a diverse Swarthmore student life may
flourish." In the letter, SBC encouraged further dialogue

with Student Council.
SBC Manager Giannina Esquivel and other SBC members did not reply to e-mail requests for comment on these
issues.

Student Council Vice President Sven Udekwu 'O9 said,
"The SBC wisely brought up the issue that they are tied by
institutionalrules and policies that set them to be very fair.
We would end up where future councils would be able to
overturn SBC decisions right and left It would remove
...

another check."

Apollo explained that SBC is set up to ensure that they
treat everyone equally, in that they must follow precedents
according to their by-laws. He said that the ability of
Student Council to look at other factors than fairness when
making their decision would not necessarily be as fair.
Instead of going through with an amendment, Student
Council decided to take a different path. They will be meeting with SBC and SAC to discuss the best way to address
the issue.

One of the issues left to deal with is handing in receipts

late. "We can't really give much ground on [crossing things
off receipts] but since the two-week line is pretty much an
arbitrary line as to when to turn in receipts because we
need to pick some time we've decided to move to a system whereby you'll be fined a certain percentage of the
receipt for every week you're late," Apollo said.
...

The change is slated to take effect pending SAC and

Student Council approval. SBC hopes that the revised policy will encourage students to submit receipts in a timely

manner, as students who fail to meet the deadline risk forfeiting theirreimbursements.
"[The amendment] is worth talking about because it's
not dead forever and all of the issues surrounding the
amendment are still around," Apollo said. "Nothing has
really been solved, we've just decided to go about the prob-

lem in a different way."

Kemp hall walkthrough suggests completion by Fall 2008

Members of the construction team (left) have been hard at work to keep the project on track for its scheduled completion in June. A floor plan of the ground level (right) displays
the dimensions of rooms that will be available to student s in the upcoming housing lottery.

mpragerl@swarthmore.edu

David Kemp Hall will be complete and ready to welcome new residents in time for Alumni Weekend in June,
and more importantly, for the upcoming fall semester.
Construction is proceeding on schedule and without
glitches, and The Phoenix took a special tour of the interior.
"We have 90 percent of the underground and the
drainage complete," Project Manager Mike Boyd said as
he took Phoenix news reporter Mary Prager 'll and pho-

tographer Katherine Koch 'OB on a guided tour of the

hall.
In addition, all of the heating, air conditioning, electric, and plumbing utilities have been completed.
Furniture for the dorm rooms will arrive on May 15, and
within the next two weeks, construction workers will
focus on finishing up rooms, landscaping and building a
stone plaza. "So we're well on our way," Boyd said.
Boyd showed The Phoenix a spacious single with natural light flooding in on the second floor. "This might be
an RA's [room]," he said. Electrical wiring, not yet connected to a bulb or other fixture, extended from the wall.
so
The walls were painted white, the floor uncarpeted
that residents and maintenance will not have to deal
with stains, he said. Other rooms were not as far along.
The bottom third of a wall was covered in what appears
to be black paint, but is actually waterproofing. In the
same area a sediment of cement and sedum was visible,
and above that was a material called green board, which
is resistant to mildew and moisture.
Later along the tour, Boyd led the staff to a single with
wide windows overlooking the green roof— his favorite,
he said. Boyd explained that the windows are thermal
double-paired and filled with argon gas. "Probably the
best energy value you can get out of a window," he said.
"We're checking to make sure everything is
[Americans with Disabilities Act] compliant," Boyd said.
He walked the staff around another room. It was still
dusty and not completely tiled, but it was unmistakably
a bathroom. Boyd discussed the water system, a pumped
water loop that circulates hot water near faucets to provide on-demand heat.
According to Boyd, the construction team has managed to avoid any significant problems. "We have a fantastic architect, Rawn Associates," Boyd said. "And the
construction crew is just amazing." Ensuring ADA compliancy is a meticulous task for the crew, because the
regulations prohibit any deviation from the federal standards for handicap accessible design. Regarding the
recent settlement between the college and the
Department of Justice, Boyd discussed plans to hire a

4

consultant firm to work with the college to help identify
problems.
"Overall, the construction's going great," Housing
Coordinator Liz Derickson 'Ol said. On Wednesday,
Derickson is scheduled to take her second tour of the
dorm this year.
As the housing lotteries approach, Derickson and the
Housing Committee have been discussing next year's
housing. Last week, they met to discuss how rooms in the
new hall should be blocked. Projected to house 76 residents in the fall, Kemp is likely to be a popular choice for
next year, although the RA application forms that
Derickson has reviewed so far do not precisely reflect
this. "I wouldn't say [David Kemp HallJ's been wildly
but it also clearly hasn't gone unnoticed,"
popular
...

Derickson says.
David Kemp Hall is structurally related to Alice Paul,

The loudest construction was due to the exterior work,
said Derickson, most of which was done in the fall, and
particularly the masonry. The beeping sound emitted by
vehicles backing up is still noisy, but necessary, and, she
said, the more acute disturbances have stopped.
As residents of Alice Paul in particular have noticed,
rainy weather floods the path that winds around the
stored construction equipment on Mertz lawn. When the
weather clears up, the contractor plans to raise the path
to prevent such flooding.
One of the final steps in the completion of the dorm
will be removing the equipment placed on Mertz lawn,
and opening up that pathway. "To be able to use Mertz
lawns as a storage place was a big help for the construction," Boyd said. The construction workers will reestablish the land as a lawn.

so the aesthetics of the building are not new
future
residents will know what to expect. There are no lofted
doubles, but the dorm has the tall windows and minimalist aesthetic of Alice Paul, said Derickson, who added
that Kemp is designed to function in tandem with Alice
Paul including sharing the red lounge and a courtyard
with a grill!
While the dorm's completion and opening are sure to
be exciting for all, residents of Alice Paul and Mertz will
be particularly relieved once the construction finishes.
Only 35 feet separate Kemp and the closest section of
Mertz, and for Alice Paul, only ten, not nearly enough to
shelter residents from the bangs and clangs of construction.
According to second floor Mertz RA Susannah Gund
'OB, Mike Boyd gave Mertz and Alice Paul RAs a special
tour of the dorm in the fall of 2007. Boyd also sends e-mail
updates to residents regarding the construction.
Like other RAs in Mertz and Alice Paul, Gund has had
to deal with residents' complaints regarding the noise

and other problems. Gund lives on the south side of
Mertz, which is near the construction, but closer to the

center of the dorm. "I've gotten fewer complaints now,
but I think that's because the people who've had major
sound problems or other concerns may have contacted
Mike Boyd or Liz Derickson," she said. A more recent
issue has been the closing off of the driveway behind
Mertz. Gund said that people can no longer pull up their
cars. Regardless, Gund was excited about the new dorm.
A new circular driveway will lead up to the back of
David Kemp Hall, facing Chester Road. "We're eliminating the circle that used to be behind Mertz, leaving a narrow lane for service vehicles," Boyd said.
"Now that it's more interior work, I think there's

been a fundamental shift," Derickson said with regard to
complaints made by residents of Mertz and Alice Paul.

Rigger talks of interrelationship of Taiwan, US
The Friends of Taiwan and the political science department hosted a lecture by Professor Shelley Rigger of
Davidson College on Tuesday in which she spoke about the
recent elections and their effects on future politics in
Taiwan. The lecture, entitled "Taiwan's 2008 Elections:
Breaking New Ground?" concentrated on the 2008 legislative elections as well as the legacy of the current president,

democratic? I think you can. We [the U.S.] have taken
outlawing Islam off the table from our constitution, so I
think that we always restrict ourselves in a democracy.
We say there are certain things we will not decide; we
will not let the majority rule because they are too important. For Taiwan the independence question is one like
that, but it is hard for many people to accept.

the event, considered it a success. "It was a great event,"
Hong said. "Rigger really knows her stuff. She is articulate and engaging, especially ifyou don't know everything
about Taiwan already. It was very informative."Rigger is
a Brown associate professor of East Asian politics at
Davidson College and a leading expert on Taiwanese
affairs, according to Tyrene White, professor of political
science at Swarthmore. She is the author of two books,
including "From Opposition to Power: Taiwan's
Democratic Progressive Party," as well as numerous publications. Phoenix staff writer Hannah Purkey recently sat
down with Rigger to discuss the current political situation

"The U.S. is resolved to help Taiwan
defend itself, but it is sometimes
really complicated when the
Taiwanese don't seem resolved to
help themselves."
Shelley Rigger
Professor, Davidson College

and their effects on Taiwan's future. This was one ofFoT's
first large-scale events since being chartered.
Aleta Hong 'O9, a member ofFoT and an organizer of

of Taiwan:
Hannah Purkey: Why are you interested in studying Taiwan?
Shelley Rigger: There are really two reasons. One
was, when I was an undergraduate, I had a chance to do
a research project in Taiwan the summer after my junior
year. So I went over and just had a fantastic time. So I
was always kind of interested, but I assumed when I
went to graduate school I would work in the Mainland
China field. I was just preparing to do dissertation
research in China on minority politics, Islamic minorities in China, in June of 1989.
But the Tiananmen crisis in June of 1989 made a lot of
Americans think, we're just never going back there
[China]; there was this strong emotional response that
we can't continue to do business as usual with China.
The dissertation I wanted to do was politically risky even
before a big political crackdown in China.
So I had to find another topic and someone suggested
writing about Taiwan. Taiwan is an easy place to work, I
already had some familiarity with the place, and I knew
I could get the research done. Also at that time Taiwan
was a really interesting case in the democrization field,
so there was interest in political science as well as people interested in china in the Taiwan story. So that is
how I ended up getting back in Taiwan again in the early
'9os.

"That is why the idea of a union of
equals is so important. The Chinese
government sometimes says that is
what they want, but they don't really
mean it."
Shelley Rigger
Professor, Davidson College
HP: You spoke about the recent elections, but
exactly how democratic is Taiwan?
SR: It is really democratic at this point. People sometimes complain about vote fraud and things like that but
I think there is actually very little of that kind of thing.
The main problems with Taiwan's political system have
to do with more how well the political system functions
as opposed to whether or not it is democratic.
There is a lot of static between the legislative and
executive branches in Taiwan because the constitution
doesn't make it clear enough whether it is a presidential
system or a parliamentary system. You have problems

like that, but those aren't problems with democracy as
much as they are problems with government. But in
terms of things like freedom of speech, there is almost
too much. But there is this one problem, which is that
there is one issue, and it is a huge and important issue to
everyone, that can't be resolved in a democratic way.
That is the question of what is Taiwan's relationship to
China. That I think is the interesting point.
If we take certain topics off the table, can you still be

THE PHOENIX

HP: What will be the long-term relationship
between China and Taiwan?
SR: The best case scenario, which I think is also the
likeliest scenario, is that things will stabilize as they are
and will go on that way for a couple more decades until
people in Taiwan and China decide that neither one
needs to be somehow under the other, but that maybe
they can be together under a third flag. So something like
the British Commonwealth meets the European Union. I
think that is a very realistic prospect.
What will prevent that from happening is if China
loses patience, there is a crisis or collapse in China and
the Chinese government needs to use Taiwan to prove its
metal to the Chinese people. That is the most likely scenario for military conflict that would make this peaceful
outcome not work.
TP: So there will be integration?
SR: There is already a lot of integration at the economic and cultural level, and we know from the EU that
you can have separate political sovereignties and states
that are very interconnected and think of themselves as
meaningfully joined but are still also meaningfully separate. We do have models for that.
TP: What is the nature of this political resistance of moving closer to
China?
SR: The Chinese government's position
is that Taiwan needs to become part of the
People's Republic of China under the communist party, and that is something very
hard for the Taiwanese to understand, how
they can continue to be democratic in the
way that they are and also be under the
PRC.
That is why this idea of a union of
equals is so important. The Chinese government sometimes says that is what they

want, but they don't really mean it or they
don't say it often enough or firmly enough
for people in Taiwan to believe it.

Hena Choi Phoenix Staff

At a talk co-hosted by Friends of Taiwan and the department of political science, professor Shelley Rigger gave
an overview of the state of presidential politics in Taiwan.
SR: I think the whole issue of arms sales and so on
has become very complicated and politicized. The PRC
has never wanted the U.S. to sell weapons to Taiwan; it
has been a point of contention from the moment Nixon
went to China, and it has never really been resolved.
American policy makers have to manage that issue.
The U.S. is resolved to help Taiwan defend itself, but
it is sometimes really complicated when the Taiwanese
don't seem resolved to help themselves.
I think it is one of those issues that is always with us,
but I don't think it has ever been fatal to any of these
relationships.
All three sides have decided that there are other
things that are more important, so they will fuss at each
other over arms sales, but the basic pattern is pretty set.

TP: How do you think the U.S.'s
investment and dependence on China
effects Taiwan and its future relations

with China?
SR: The funny thing is you might think
that it would be bad for Taiwan and for the
U.S. to have so much investment in China,
but nobody has more investment in China
than Taiwan. The Taiwanese have already
committed their economy to China, so I
think it is actually good for Taiwan if the
U.S. and China have good relations. That
will help Taiwanese business in Taiwan
and China to prosper, and it also creates
some credible opportunities. Americans
trust Taiwanese managers more than PRC
managers, and many Taiwanese managers
have better English skills as well as better
international experience. U.S. investors in
China also rely heavily on the Taiwanese;
it is good for them, too.

$45,700 to $47,804 was "largely due
to inflation and to meet the pressure of other priority needs."

An excerpt from college treasurer Sue Welsh's summary of the
08-09 budget indicates that the

"budget development process
continues to make evident the
limited flexibility within the
College's operating budget."
The approved SIIL9 million
indicates
that
the
budget
approved plan has "virtually no
additional funds" for any new
needs that arise during the year,
and identifies the 2008-2009's student charges as being in the
"middle of a comparison group of
peer institutions."
Furthermore, the excerpt
emphasizes that the budget

reflects the recent shift to replace
all Swarthmore loans within
financial aid packages to equivalent grants. A previous comment
by Welsh in The Phoenix estimated that the plan would cost at
least SL7 million next year.
One board member offered a
matching contribution incentive
to help finance the policy change.
"One thing that will be interesting to students is that one
board member has offered to
match student gifts ten to one for
supporting the no loans decision," Eldridge said.

General consensus has been
reached in following through
with this fundraising initiative,
though the process is still in its
preliminary stages. According to
Student Council Vice
Sven
Udekwu 'O9,

President
Student

Council will work closely with
the campus community to facilitate the implementation of

The old love adage, "opposites

students will soon find out from
their seminar experiment. As part
of biology
professor Sarah
Hierbert Burch's seminar, Helen
Chmura 'O9, Zehra Hussain 'O9,
Aleta Hong 'O9 and Melinda Yang
'O9 have developed a t-shirt
smelling experiment to test the

correlation between levels of hormones and biological attractiveness.
"There are a lot of couples on

campus
and sometimes people
don't think about the biological

shirt wearers to wear a designated
t-shirt over night, with the stipulation of staying away from strong
scents, such as perfumes or
colognes. Also, the t-shirt wearers
will be required to use unscented
soaps to prevent contamination

variables.

reasons or the genetic and hor-

monal basis behind attraction,"
Hussain said. The biology stu-

dents are testing the hypothesis
that people will be attracted to others who are most dissimilar, in
terms of the specific version of a
major histocompatibility complex
gene

an individual possesses.

According to the group's research
proposal, "The [MHC] is a highly
conserved genomic region known
to code for many important
immune functions."
There are two main biological
hypotheses which suggest why
MHC dissimilarity is advantageous. "First, it would help organisms avoid inbreeding, because
related individuals have more
similar MHC genes than non-related individuals. Second, it would
increase heterozygosity of offspring, thus increasing their

immunocompetence against a
wider number of parasites."
According to Hussain, individuals with high testosterone and
high Cortisol levels have scientifically been found to be most attractive to others.
Hong stated that, for the experiment, the group is recruiting 101-

The experiment also requires
50 to 60 t-shirt smellers who will
sniff the previously worn t-shirts

and then rank them based on the
intensity and pleasance of the
odors. According to Hong all participants will provide saliva or
cheek swab samples so that the
group can obtain gene sequencing

and DNA data. Hussain stated that
in order to do so, they must amplify the isolated gene with primers,
and all of the samples will be sent
to an outside lab for sequencing.
With that data, along with basic
information garnered from participant questionnaires, the group
will assess the validity of their

hypothesis.

The group will be examining,
in particular, which version of a
specific gene from the MHC is
present in each participant and
how that gene correlates with an
individual's attraction to others.
Chmura said that their experiment details have been sent to the
Internal Review Board to make
sure that their procedure complies
with ethical standards since her
group is using human subjects. "It
is not approved yet," Chmura said.
"Everything is contingent upon

that." The group hopes to hear a
verdict from the IRB within about
two weeks.
To the best of the group's
knowledge, little to no undergraduate work has been done to
explore the relationship between
hormones and perceived attractiveness. The group cited previous
studies conducted in Finland and
Japan as examples of related past
experiments. Previous experiments have found that "women
associate the odors of men whose
MHC genes are dissimilar from
their own with their current or
former mates more so than the
odors of men with MHC regions
similar to their own," according to
the group's research proposal.
Though past studies have
focused on patterns of heterosexual attraction, this group's study
will consider a spectrum of sexual
orientations, as long as the IRB

permits the collection of such
information from participants.

"Women associate
the odors of men
whose MHC genes are
dissimilar from their
own with... mates."

Flyers frame dialogue, pose questions of identity
BY ROSARIO PAZ

rpazl@swarthmore. edu
Recent events surrounding the claims of
appropriation of language specific to the
LGBT community in the slogans of College
Republican posters have initiated a series of
responses and further dialogue in many
areas of the college.
According to Assistant Dean and
Director of the Black Cultural Center Tim
Sams, at the center of this dialogue lies the
issue of the appropriation of language and
the consequences of outer groups adopting
words, phrases or whole languages that are
specific to the experiences of a certain group
of individuals.
"In a pluralistic society where there is a
lot of exchange of ideas
appropriation is
going to happen. It happens all the time,"
Sams said. "I would say that people of color
create European language and dress and
speech and style, and whites do it in terms of
...

people ofcolor. It does not mean that people
have a full understanding of that which they
are appropriating."
The running dialogue on the claim of
appropriation of language originated
around the time the College Republicans
were advertising for their group during
which they used slogans like "Curious?
Questioning?" and "It's Okay To Come Out"
in order to attract "closeted conservatives"
to their weekly meetings. These individuals
are characterized as apprehensive to reveal
their right-wing views on a predominantly

liberal campus.

"One of the boys [at the
frat] got up and he started
to walk toward us [and
yelled] 'Maul them' at us."
Sebastian
Duncan-Portuondo 'OB
"The Swarthmore College Repubicans
used the terminology 'lt's Ok To Come Out'
to bring forth the reality that stigmas exist
against conservative students on campus,"
College Republicans President Justin
Shaffer 'OB said. "Believe it or not many students at Swarthmore and elsewhere label
themselves as 'closeted conservatives' due to
the social consequences by being outspoken
about a environment as polarizing at
Swarthmore."
Some days later, a group of students came
together to discuss a situation which they

believed to be a misappropriation of language that is particular to the sensitive coming out experience of queer people and an

offensive act that wrongfully parodied the
constant difficulties a queer individual must
go through in his/her lifetime, according to
Tatiana Cozzarelli 'OB.
These group of students then proceeded

to write a letter that was forwarded by
Cozzarelli to the listserves of all the cultural
groups on campus detailing their discontent
with the posters. Since then, the three students have revealed themselves to be

Sebastian Duncan-Portuondo 'OB, Nick
Forrest 'OB and Shane Breitenstein 'OB.
"We had noticed the fliers of the same
campaign the semester before and had
talked to people about it then, and when we
saw it being used again this semester, we

really thought that publicly people should
know the way a portion of the campus feels

about this," Duncan-Portuondo said. "We
don't want to be exclusive by signing, we
didn't want to speak for one specific group.
Also, we chose this public way of addressing

it because we were responding to a public
display. It wasn't specifically about the
College Republicans because that wasn't the
way the posters looked to us. It looked like a
national Republican poster."
"There's a reason why we were anonymous," Breitenstein said. "On the [Daily
Gazette] boards, they specifically attacked
Tatiana. She has a very specifc identity here
on campus and if we had signed, we would
have been personally attacked as Tatiana
was. We felt that our original actions were a
legitimate use of public use and public dis...

speech but our freedom is being silenced."
Furthermore, in the letter, the anony...

mous posters revealed that some of their
original posters had been removed and
replaced with more College Republican
fliers reading "If you believe in freedom of
speech, do not deface or remove our fliers,"
suggesting that in the process of putting up

the response posters, the anonymous posters
were also responsible for removing the original College Republican fliers.
According to the anonymous posters and
Cozzarelli, though two posters were covered
by the anonymous fliers, due to the lack of
available space available on account of the
numerous College Republican fliers, individuals who were responsible for putting up
the fliers were specifically instructed not to
remove any College Republican fliers.
"When I did send an e-mail out to the
SQU Board with the letter that was written,
one of the people that put out the counter
posters explicitly said to tell people not to
take down the College Republican
posters," Cozzarelli said. "The anonymous

"Do professors impose their viewpoints

on students through lecture and classroom
readings? Many students have mentioned
that at Swarthmore they feel the need to
alter their personal views in papers, because
if they espouse conservative viewpoints
they might receive a lower grade. Again, we
ask fellow Swarthmore students: "When was
the last time you allowed a Republican to
defend their views at Sharpies?," Shaffer

said.

According to Cozzarelli, the idea that
Republicans on campus experience discrimination and silencing on campus to the same
extent that individuals in the process of
coming out is a parallel that is essentially
flawed.
"I think that certainly the Republicans
are a minority on campus and no one is say-

ing that they are not. But what we are saying
is that the very painful, difficult, lifelong
experience of coming out is not comparable
to the experience of feeling uncomfortable in
a couple classes at Swarthmore because you
and queer people feel
are Republican
uncomfortable in classes here all the time as
well. I think that's a major difference," she
-

said.

"Last year, my queer safe space sign was
burned off my door," Duncan-Portuondo
said. "Another time, Shane and I were sitting in front of Phi Psi and one of the boys
there got up and he started to walk toward
us [and] yelled 'Maul them' at us. We felt
pretty gay and no matter what it was it felt

like gender variance of nonconformity."
"That's like one of the things that's been
frustrating," Breitenstein said. "People have
accused us of being the PC Police and selfvictimizing ourselves, trying to argue that at

Swarthmore it is pretty much okay to be gay.
It's really naive to think that that's how people live their lives
Whether it exists at
Swat or not, the majority of the dominant
culture is homophobic. I just wish that
Swarthmore students sometimes think out...

side the bubble."
Although their posters may have been
interpreted as examples of injudicious

appropriation of language, Shaffer argued

that the fervor behind the anonymous

posters' reaction seems to be more attributed to an inherent bias towards the College
Republicans and not so much an offense
with the wording of the advertisements
itself.
"It appears the culprit of this flyering

seems to be possibly more motivated
against Republicans in general rather
than the supposed parallels of language,"
Shaffer said. "The Phoenix reported in
November when a generic College
Republican poster was hung in Willets it
was defaced and torn down. Given this, we
wonder whether such actions of defacement and flyer removal were truly about
the Swarthmore College Republicans
appropriating language used by LGBT
groups or simply fellow students resenting
a Republican group on campus."

"There is the issue of freedom of

that we do believe in free speech but we're
not settled on the freedom to hurt others
So, if we find something that does that, we
need to quickly respond that we don't have

...

According to Shaffer, the act of utilizing
the terminology in question was in no way

intended to be an appropriation of language specific to the queer community,

pointing out times in the past in which
they and other groups such as "Geek
Coming Out Week" and SCCS have used
the terminology without any admonishment.
"We had posted the "It's OK to Come
Out" signs to advertise our introductory
event way back in November (The You
Tube Debate Watching Party) and they
were left alone. So our group did not did
expect such a reaction that occurred this
week," he said.
"Further, dozens of College Republican
groups nationwide ranging from schools
such as Brandeis, Wellesley and University
of Michigan have all sponsored
"Conservative Coming Out Days" or
"Conservative Coming Out Weeks" as academia has trended to be increasingly liberal recently and the speech rights of conser-

vative students appear to be impinged
upon," he said.
The argument that Republicans, conservatives and moderates on campus share
the same minority status as other cultural
groups like the LGBT community is the
impetus behind the language that was used
on the College Republican posters in the

first place.

Due to the predominantly liberal status
of the college, many conservative students
feel that they must go "one against all"

Appropriation of language leads to campus-wide tension, debate
From FLYERS, p. 7
"It was specifically about the Republicans using
'Coming Out 1. I don't feel offended with the 'Geek Coming
Out' week. I think it's because those organizations don't
incorporate a homophobic policy," Duncan-Portuondo
said.
"Also, a lot of the Republicans have backed up their
campaign saying that it's part of the 'Conservative
Coming Out' week
Conservative to me in this contemporary discourse very much implies anti-queer sentiment."
...

"We think that we're so accepting
and not homophobic and that we
can joke about it because we're
post-homophobia and I think that
that is not the case."
Tatiana Cozzarelli 'OB
...

Another issue the College Republicans group felt was
unwarranted was the generalization of the group's agenda
to that of the homophobic tendencies of the national

Republican party.
According to Rafael Rivero 'O9, a gay student and a
member of the College Republicans, the group's political
beliefs have not been in conflict with his identity, despite
the belief that the group is representative of the same

issues that the national GOP supports.
"I have been to a few of the College Republican meetings, but I, myself, am a homosexual. I am openly gay at
the College Republican meetings, and I'm friends with
some of them. When I stay around they discuss deficits,

they discuss fiscal policy, they discuss policy that is for
the most part unrelated to social issue," he said.
"The Swarthmore College Republicans takes great
offense by being grouped into 'homophobic organizations.'
In fact, we've had discussions at several meetings and
learned that our membership has little interest in the
social conservative platform of the National GOP," he

said.

Although the College Republicans group has essentially divorced themselves from the homophobic agenda of

the national party, there is still the issue of the denial of

homophobia on campus and whether one feels that homophobia is still a prevalent sentiment among the student
body.
"We weren't accusing individual Republicans on campus of being homophobic," Forrest said. "We wanted to
encourage people to think about the meanings of words
specific to communities
The whole critique of 'to not be
Bravery is such a loaded
anonymous is to be brave'
issue. I'm just generalizing it a lot here You just want to
say something without worrying that your individuality
will be attacked."
"I think it does point to a broader problem at
Swarthmore of appropriating terms and pretending that
homophobia doesn't occur on campus when it does,"
Cozzarelli said. "At Swarthmore, we think that we're so
accepting and not homophobic that we think it's okay for
people to do that... and that we can joke about it because
we're post-homophobia and I think that that is not the
case."
The issue of anonymity and the idea that every individual has a varying level of privilege in terms of whether
or not they have the advantage of being able to link their
identities to their opinions without fear or apprehension
is one that is great to the queer community, according to

the response posters.
By encouraging further

discussion on this

subject,

opportunities for making individuals of these privileged
groups aware of their ability to be unrestrained from the

issue of anonymity and building trust between polarized
groups is a possibility.
"I hope we get to a point on this campus when every
time that homosexuality is in the spotlight, we don't go
through the same exhaustive narrative," Rivero said.
"Queer people and our allies have to be vigilant and reactive to homophobia, but we shouldn't let our conviction let
us get carried away. It's a matter of trust, and, at least on
this campus, we've earned it. Now, let's give some back."
"Going forward, we have a responsibility to have, in
this case, Republicans understand a broader sense of what
that symbol means and why it would be offensive to mem-

bers of our community, both "queer" and straight," Sams
said.

"I hope we get to a point on this

that, will approach it in that spirit and that it
will be a successful campaign," Gardner said.
Eldridge notedthat liberal arts colleges cannot sustain institutional excellence in the
absence of committed donors. "It's always a

good thing, I think, for people to understand
that private higher education is and always
will be dependent on philanthropy to succeed,"
Eldridge said. "There will never be enough
money in tuition and fees to pay for educa-

tion."

Another issue that was discussed included
the increase of the Student Activity fee. To be
initiated next year, the Student Activity fee

will be increased by $l6, raising the total fee
from $320 to $336, and would be responsible for
raising approximately $22,000 more towards
student activity funding. The fee is included in
the yearly charges from the college, alongside
tuition and room and board.
Though the fee has been raised in the past
in order to provide additional funding to the
Student Budget Committee's budget for implementing student activity proposals, the fee has
not been increased in the past few years,

"The Student Council and Student Budget

position of saying no to several groups. The
number of groups has increased greatly over
several years and Student Council keeps on
getting proposals from several groups with

increases in the fee."
"With this increase, it'll give us a chance to

Harvard's "gossip girl"
1

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

BY MAXWELL L. CHILD

(U-WIRE) Harvard University's got its
own "Gossip Girl" and, appropriately
enough, she's a geek. The title character of
the popular TV show claims to be the "one
and only source into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite," and a new website,
"Gossip Geek," is trying to play the same
role for the College's social elite. The blog,
which launched during finals period, is
drawing ire in some student circles and
laughs in others, as Harvard becomes yet
another campus roiled by online innuendo
in recent months.
The authors of the site, who purport to
"blush crimson for the stars," post short
blurbs on what they claim are the exploits
of "campus celebrities," including
Undergraduate
Council
President
Matthew L. Sundquist 'O9 (he "used to
have neon yellow hair," the site explains),
and sex blogger Lena Chen 'O9. The posts
are often accompanied by grainy, practi-

cally inscrutable cell phone photographs,
and most contain information that is provably false, and often wholly ridiculous
for example, a recent post claimed VES
[Visual

and Environmental

Studies] and

Physics concentrator Lewis Z. Liu 'OB
would be trading one of his paintings with

British billionaire Richard Branson for a
ride on Virgin Galactic's first spaceflight.
The authors also like to play fast and
loose with names, final club affiliations,
and other easUy-confirmed facts. While
many ofthe "celebrities" on the site see the
"It's just fun and
postings as innocuous
games at this point," Liu said others are

less pleased.
"I think it is stupid. The Internet has
given writers tremendous freedom about
what they can publish and the number of
people that they can reach," said
Christopher B. Lacaria 'O9, publisher of
the Harvard Salient and a former "celebrity" on the site's "most wanted" list, in an emailed statement. "Some people, it seems,
have used this freedom very irresponsi-

bly."
or
Despite the negative attention
the site's popularperhaps because of it
ity is growing, with over 15,000 hits so far
and between 500 hits and 1000 hits a day,
the authors said in an e-mail.
The numbers appear to indicate, as the
site's authors said, that "there seems to be
quite a large void at Harvard where publications about students should be." Gossip
Geek, they said, is filling that void.
Still, the authors have thus far steadfastly refused to identity themselves.
"Our anonymity is integral to the quality of our craft," they wrote in an e-mail.
"Thus, it is impossible for us to talk to you
via telephone, as we do not have the technology to conceal our voices."
Most of the "celebrities" who appear on
the site take a cavalier attitude toward
their newfound exposure. "They say only
nice things [about me], so at this point,
whoever it is, Ihope I don't say the wrong
thing around them," said Derek M.

Flanzraich 'lO, a former member of the
site's "most wanted" list for being a "sex

seriously is kidding themselves."
UC Representative Andrea R. Flores

being "kinda awesome," said she found
her presence on the site "weird," but was
mostly unconcerned about invasion of her
privacy. "As long as they don't say anything false about me, I'm OK," she said. "I

"We've gotten the entire spectrum [of
feedback], from 'this is retarded' to 'this is
genius,'" they said. "We get lots of great emails, too, from students telling us how
much they look forward to our new posts.
And there's, of course, people who love
the blog because it says nice things about
them." Some "celebrities" are simply apathetic: Sundquist said he had only looked
at it when his roommate showed it to
him, and does not check it regularly.

Cho's humor resonates with college crowd
Although she began her highly acclaimed stand-up

BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu

If Swarthmore were a comedian, it would be Margaret
Cho. Known for her sassy wit and deep commitment to
socio-political activism, Cho reflects the fearlessly outspoken nature (although not necessarily the politics) of
the campus at large. Students responded enthusiastically
to Cho's performance this past Saturday on the LPAC
main stage, applauding and laughing their conscientious
heads off throughout the evening.

Many of Margaret Cho's messages
touched on subjects that
Swarthmore students hold dear,
genitalia included.
Cho was preceded by comedian lan Harvey, who lampooned careless hunters such as Dick Cheney and
extolled the virtues of strap-on dildos. Although the dildo
trope fell a bit flat, beneath the surface of Harvey's performance lurked a deeper discussion of queer and transgender issues. Harvey "came out to [his] parents twice:"
once as a lesbian and a second time as a transgendered
person. After coming to terms with his desire to "to pee
[his] name in the snow," Harvey began taking testosterone. He will soon have chest surgery because, having
measured one of his breasts on a supermarket scale, he

realized that he was carrying "the equivalent of an Olsen
twin
not the fat one."
Cho bounded on stage to Harvey's welcome and an
intense wave of cheers and applause from the audience.

career
over nine years ago with the one woman show, "I'm the
One that I Want," Cho's humor is still sharply insightful.
What makes Cho's comedy so hilariously powerful is
that she is not afraid to work more serious issues into bla-

tantly ridiculous topics. While satirizing Paris Hilton's
jail stint and Britney Spear's appearance at the VMA's,
Cho also commented on female body image. "Britney did
not look fat. She looked beautiful," Cho said.
She later returned to this theme of perceived beauty
on a more personal level. During a radio interview, Cho
was once asked, "If you woke up tomorrow and you were
beautiful, what would you do? If you were, blonde, blueeyed, 5'11", and weighed 100 pounds, what would you do?"
Cho snarkily responded, "Well, I probably wouldn't get
up in that case, because I'd be too weak to stand."
Cho does not rant either. No matter how passionate

she is about the often controversial issues her shows
tackle, Cho never uses the stage as a pulpit. Instead, she

wraps her messages in layers of impressions, funny faces
and copious use of the words "pussy" and "dick."
Many of these messages touched on subjects that
Swarthmore students hold dear, genitalia included. "She
was perfect for the Swarthmore crowd. Everyone around
me was laughing so hard," Jessa Deutsch 'lO said. From
abortion to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," Cho left no
issue uncovered. "I am not bi, I'm T," Cho said when
explaining her queer identity to the audience. Even environmental sustainability had its moment in the sun when
Cho said, "Dick is sustainable!"
Most Swarthmore students took well to Cho's unique
brand of comedy. "I thought that her ability to subvert

the crude language usually used to marginalize minority
communities to craft biting social commentary and satire
was a clever technique that is uniquely suited to her
brand of comedy. Also, she was really funny," Aaron
Brecher 'lO said.

Cho closed her performance with an original ode to
oral sex, lyrically exhorting the audience to "eat me out."

At this point in her sex-saturated show, the musical number pushed things a bit over the top. Although audience
laughed and cheered, not all were fans of Cho's comedy at
the end of the night. "The show was not really my style,"
said Melissa Cruz 'lO, who was working the door.
Even though the performance was not suited to all
tastes, the Cooper Committee deserves many thanks for
bringing a comedian as blunt and flat-out hilarious as
Margaret Cho to Swarthmore.

The Etiquette Fairy

The week before spring break is by far
the second most stressful part of the
Spring semester. Nearly every professor

has assigned a major piece of work that is
due right before we all go on vacation,
which means that just when you most desperately need a quiet place to study,
Cornell, Underhill and McCabe are the
most crowded. So now seemed as good a
time as any to review library etiquette.
Let us briefly review the activities
which, when performed in a library, are
found objectionable. Singing, for example.
Singing is best done where it can be properly appreciated, like a stage. While your
rendition of "99 Red Balloons" might be

gone awry, might cause bodily or mental
harm to standers-by should be avoided.
Once-a-semester performances/interruptions (hello naked rugby players!) we will
overlook.
Singing and dancing are not the only
kinds of performances observed in the
libraries: radio broadcasting also seems
to occur pretty regularly. Sometimes,
when there is something that someone
wants everyone to know, like that they
just got the summer job of their dreams,
or that they aren't at all upset that their
ex-girlfriend is dating a spec, they will
walk around in the library telling everyone with whom they are acquainted the
story in a loud voice. The desire to make

the same table as you should be able to
hear your conversation about what
Jennifer Garner wore to the Oscars. Some
people also try to play misery poker with
everyone in earshot in a similar way: by
keeping a running commentary on how
difficult their work is out loud. Not only
is this obnoxious, it also scares us.
The urge to share YouTube videos and
music with your friends without the benefit of headphones should be studiously
repressed. If Mairin had her way, the
entire world would be introduced to the
joys of last year's Ukrainian entry to the
Eurovision Song Contest. That does not
mean that she is going to make the entire
library listen in on Verka Serdyuchka
shouting "Ems, zwei, drei!" three hundred times, no matter how delightful.

Everyone knows that if they were, you'd
be having them in private. If you don't
want to make the person calling think you
are ignoring them, it is acceptable to
answer, but only to say, "Can I call you

it belongs.
The most common form of broadcasting carries the message, "Hey, look, I have
friends," and consists of having loud conversations with said friends in the
library. We think it's great that you have
friends. Bully for you. But if you continue to speak to them above a whisper,
you'll soon have enemies, too. There is
nothing wrong with talking on the main

back.

If you are worried about losing your
spot, it is acceptable to leave some books
or your coat on the chair. With the rash of
thefts in McCabe, we understand not
wanting to leave anything valuable unattended for any length of time.
At the same time, if you expect your
seat back, you need to leave some indication that you intend to return. An empty
coffee cup and a banana peel are insufficient to establish your right to an entire
table. They could just as easily indicate
that you're irresponsible with your
garbage as that you're going to come

back. Similarly, a single sheet of scrap
paper and a gum wrapper won't cut it. We

need to see some commitment.

Despite occasionally wishing that the

libraries were monastery-like refuges for
the life of the mind (and wishing that the
librarians were given cattle prods to discipline miscreants) we've come around to
accepting that our libraries serve as
social spaces as well, and that there are
times when all bets are off.

Gyil ensemble becomes a course

Bigger Worthstock
BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS

azalokol@swarthmore.edu
Due to the cost of last semester's LSE, the LargeScale Event committee has decided to combine this
semester's event with Worthstock. "Based on the
size of our budget, we thought that it would be the
best use of our resources to combine the rest of our
LSE money with Worthstock. If we combine them,
then we only need to pay for tech costs once, as
opposed to twice," head of the LSE committee Emily
Sun 'O9 said. Though the details are still being
worked out, the combined event is scheduled for
May 3, the day after classes end.
Sun explained that using money that is left in the
LSE budget toward Worthstock would allow the committee to book bands bigger than those that
Worthstock has typically seen in the past for a music
festival similar to Princeton's Spring Weekend or
Haverford's Haverfest.
"Considering that it's pretty hard to book any
good or relevant rock acts on a small budget, getting
a few smaller, but very quality acts to headline
Worthstock seems like a great idea," Olde Clube
booking director Madalyn Baldanzi 'OB said.
"For Olde Club I often get a lot of requests for
bands that are maybe a little too big for Olde Club,
but much too small for an LSE, and this is a great
way to fill that gap," she added. "While I think that
the great diversity of the acts usually present at
Worthstock is a really important niche to fill, I also
think that there is a large demand for slightly more
popular bands, but who are on the indie side of the

is

how "Let the
Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel," the
debut full-length album by Atlas Sound (solo project of
Deerhunter front man Bradford Cox), begins
on a note
that is hauntingly beautiful and eerily poignant, with a
story of resurrection that sets the tone for an album that
largely surfaces out of Cox's struggle and life with
Marfan syndrome
a condition that, at 16, forced him to
spend a summer in a children's hospital, undergoing
multiple surgeries on his chest and back.
Otherworldly and surreal, "Let the Blind Lead Those
Who Can See But Cannot Feel" floats in and out of a
misty haze of consciousness; it drifts through childhood
and adolescence to adulthood, mimicking one long
dream, maybe one that's even nightmarish at times, the
kind in which you're floating above yourself, looking
down at your actions from a distance. It's often hard to
tell when one song has ended and another has begun: the
distinctions between them break down as each track
blends meticulously into the next. This album is one of
hushed sonics and introspection, of secret whispers and
ambient meanderings; Cox, whose gangly physique has
long attracted much attention, finally gives us a stark
look inward. His lyrics are simple and elegant, tender

THE PHOENIX

and ghastly beautiful, and though they were improvised
as the songs were being recorded on their first take, their
power lies in their stark nakedness and honesty.

This album is one of hushed sonics
and introspection, of secret
whispers and ambient meanderings.
Out of the clamoring static of the album's first track,
"Ghost Story," emerges the swirling dissonance and
spacey charm of "Recent Bedroom," where Cox's ethereal voice repeats "I walked outside / I could not cry / I
don't know why" over the melodious cacophony of tangled distortions, misty ambience, and fluttering noise.
"Recent Bedroom," in its nebulous reverie of sleep and
wistfulness, marks one of the highlights of the album,
and is soon followed by "Quarantined," a song whose jittery tinkering, fragmented vocals and quivering vibrations work together to evoke the nervous fear of the
haunted hospitals and transformations of Cox's childhood. In "Quarantined," Cox carefully articulates every
syllable of the line "I am waiting to be changing," in an
almost desperate effort to communicate emotion, as if
constant repetition and desperate begging will more
quickly bring about the change that he has been so
patiently awaiting. "Scraping Past," with its raucous
chiming and fast pace momentarily jolts the dreamer out
of a peaceful sleep, but with "Let the Blind Lead Those

Who Can See But Cannot Feel," the last track of the
album, Cox ends on an ambient note, just as he began,
bringing the album full circle and returning to the precarious world of dreams.
Pretty, ethereal, and dreamlike, "Let the Blind Lead
Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel" can, on first listen,
sometimes feel like one long blur of ambient noise. The
seamless blend of songs, the perfect whole that they create, the lush sounds and hazy fog that they cast over the
album can make the whole thing feel like one long track
rather than a collection of 14 individual, differentiated
songs, a dream that that never really ends but instead

Controversy never looked so good in
hot pink Nike sneakers and a smear of
bright red lipstick.
This past Saturday, the outspoken
comedian Margaret Cho took Swarthmore
by storm in a sold out LPAC show funded
by the Cooper Grant. Cho, a KoreanAmerican queer woman, spent time before
her performance discussing issues of gender, race and sexuality in a Q&A session
attended by students from the Nations and
Migrations and the Introduction to Asian
American Literature classes.
"I'm a stand up comedian, I'm an
author, I'm an activist, I'm a director," Cho
said by way of introduction, "I do so many
things because I don't limit myself. If I
want to do something, I go for it."
This is the same passion that Cho credits for her successful career, despite early
admonishments that "Koreans don't do
that" and the racism, sexism and homophobia she encountered.
Cho said her path was doubly hard as a
minority without "having any role models
to inspire me." She now hopes that "people
look to me as somebody that really paved
the way for them."
Cho began by talking about her writing
process and how her current blogs on her
Web site (www.margaretcho.com), the
Huffington Post and CNN.com, help her
generate ideas for shows. She added halfjoking that "people seek me out to write for
them because then they think, 'Well, if we
get her, we don't have to hire any more
Asians, women or gays."
A passionate political activist who was
campaigning for Barack Obama before her
peformance, Cho expressed excitement at
how topics of gender and race have been
brought to the forefront of the political
arena with the recent election.
Cho explained that her perception of
America as "more sexist than racist"
helped cement her decision to support

cho-sen

Obama as someone who could win. Cho
felt that currently there is a "fear among
white people about being openly racist
about black people" but that Hilary
Clinton continues to endure the media
scrutiny of her emotional state because
sexism is not similarly condemned.
Cho highlighted her frustration with
the media's assumption that women of
color are faced with the dilemma of voting
along race or gender lines.
"I found this idea very insulting,
because straight white men are allowed to
vote on issues. They're not thinking about
their gender or their race. Why don't we
have the luxury of that too?" Cho said.
Influenced by memories of growing up
in San Francisco in the aftermath of the
assassination of openly gay Supervisor of
San Francisco Harvey Milk, Cho was politically active for most of her life but initially hesitated to express her views through
comedy.
"I was surrounded by straight white
guys and I thought they're the people that
should be talking about politics, not me,"
Cho said,

This changed as Cho grew older and
eventually came out as queer. Now she is
known for the often controversial but
always sharp political and cultural commentary that flavors her comedy.
However, Cho still struggles with "the
sting of non-inclusion," such as when her
performance at the 2004 Democratic
National Convention was canceled
because her "voice would invite controversy."
Despite these instances, Cho hopes that
her activism will inspire others, especially
minorities, to find their own political

voice.
"If you're a minority, you have a
responsibility to yourself and to the future
to become an activist," Cho said. "You
can't be just an observer at this point. If we

The Phoenix's Tiffany Liao interviewed Margaret Cho
before she took the LPAC Stage this past Saturday.
Here's what the comedian had to say about everything from
burlesque dancing to being a gay icon.
Tiffany Liao: You have mentioned that things are
changing, that you are seeing more Asian American
faces in the media. Why is this happening, why now?
Margaret Cho: There's a growing consciousness around
race
more of a non-acceptance of the way things happen
and the way that it's been really monochromatic. People are
tired of not hearing their stories represented. It's become
almost trendy to have different perspectives. There's a lot
more gay characters, a lot more people of color out there. It's
exciting, I don't think it's completely better but that it's better over all.
Rfc
TL: You have a very confessional style and you mention a lot of personal topics in your work such as your
substance abuse and your body image issues. Why do
you choose this style and is it difficult to put yourself
out there like that?
MC: I don't have a personal connection to it, my stories
are just my stories. I don't feel like if it's not accepted or if
people don't like it, I don't take it personally, I just kind of
keep going. I've been doing this such a long time so I don't
feel attached to every little instance or story that I tell. I feel
okay about telling a story and just letting them go.
TL: You've mentioned in your shows your struggles
with the idea of beauty and accepting alternative forms
of it. How have you been able to move past this?
MC: As I've gotten older, I've embraced different hobbies
like bellydahee, which is a great art form that helped mt|eel

want to go forward, if we want to truly
experience what it is to be American, we
have to get involved."
Cho also spent time dissecting the less
overt brand of racism that she feels AsianAmericans are more likely to encounter.
This racism, she said, is difficult to identify and therefore difficult to discuss and

move past.

One example she raised was the emphasis the media placed on the race of the
Virginia Tech massacre perpetrator
Seung-Hui Cho, "implying somehow his

race, his Asianness was somehow a contributing factor to his craziness," Cho said.
A week later, Cho felt the backlash
when her comedy special aired on television and people complained that it was
"bad taste to show us any Chos."
Still, leave it to Cho to be able to find
the funnier side of being a minority comedian. Cho declared to roars of laughter that
"I am a member of so many minorities that
I can say what I want and white people
cannot say a thing about it!"
More seriously, she said that being a
minority in Hollywood keeps her grounded and allows her "to speak on issues and
say jokes without having anything,
happen."

one

said, specifically referencing comedians
Carlos Mencia and Sarah Silverman.
Cho herself strikes a balance between
embracing her role as a minority comedian without feeling limited to talking about
these subjects by rejecting the "PC idea
that you have to whitewash everything."
"Why is my experience less valid
because I'm Asian-American? That's bullshit," Cho said, "Sometimes people criticize me when I do my mother's voice in a
very thick Korean accent. They say, how
can you do a stereotype like that? Yeah, but
my mother really talks like that!"
Cho feels that editing her comedy this
way is misrepresentative. "That's not what
real life is, that's not real experience, that's
not art," she said.
Cho wrapped up the session by explaining that while her comedy can get "a little
darker or raunchy or graphic," her main
goal is always making "people feel good
about their experience no matter what."
Judging by the laughter that kept the
theater seats rocking at her show later that
night, Margaret Cho definitely succeeded.
BY TIFFANY LIAO

However, she admitted that
there exists the potential for
comedians to be 'co-opted by the
mainstream audience to get
their message across."

that it's handed down. I like directing but it's really difficult. It's something that I would like to do again but I know
it requires a lot of preparation. I've really been lucky and

Middle Eastern Culture Week
When Neda Daneshvar 'lO and
Christine Ernst 10 met each other at
the 2006 Tri-Co Summer Institute, they
were surprised to find that they were
the only two self-identified Middle
Easterners there. When it came time to
make skits among each of the represented ethnic groups, Daneshvar and
Ernst were instead separated into
other groups. "It made us aware that
Middle Easterners still haven't got a
presence here," Daneshvar said.
Since then, Daneshvar and Ernst
have worked to create a greater Middle
Eastern community and to increase
the visibility ofMiddle Eastern culture
at Swarthmore. Their not-yet-chartered group, the Middle Eastern
Culture Society is holding an impressive number of events over the course
ofMiddle Eastern Culture Week, which
is currently in full swing. The week
/ill culminate in several Middle
Eastern music workshops and performances this Saturday March 1
The week kicked off with the
Tuesday opening of "Window Onto the
Middle East," a photo exhibit in Shane
Lounge that featured pictures taken by
Swarthmore students while in the
Tuesday afternoon, MECS also
invited Christine Hegel-Canterella

from CUNY to lecture on Egyptian law
from an anthropological standpoint in
"Brotherly Love and Property Rights:
Practices ofPrivate Law in Egypt."
Of course, what is a cultural week
without its food? On Wednesday, MECS
ran a takeover of Paces Cafe. The Cafe
was overloaded with food, both catered
from Philly's Aryan's Restaurant and
freshly prepared by MECS members,
from the seasoned greens of tabouleh
and grape leaves, to chickpea staples
like hummus and falafel, to desserts.
The takeover also wouldn't have been
complete
without hookah and
backgammon, two pastimes that have
taken Middle Eastern eateries by
storm.

Middle Eastern Culture Week is

continuing today with a discussion on
Middle Eastern identity at 9 p.m., in
Papazian 324. MECS will be performing

several skits that dramatize the various issues that Middle Eastern
Americans face. Ernst said, "We
thought it might be nice if people saw
something and then were able to discuss it."
On Friday, MECS is showing a
Persian romantic comedy "Pastry
Girl" at 8 p.m. in Kohlberg 116.
Refreshingly not about anything politicized, the movie centers around

instead around the universal problems
surrounding a couple's marriage and
the differences between their two fami-

lies.

"We have this whole
beautiful culture that
no one ever hears
about."
Neda Daneshvar 'lO
Saturday's two musical events are
the centerpiece of the week. At 3:30
p.m., in LPAC's Boyer Dance Studio,
you can try your hand at traditional
Arabic drumming and be instructed on
debkeh, a fast-paced line dance that's a
must at Arabic weddings. For the
workshop, MECS has invited the AlBustan Percussion Ensemble and

Peer to peer

Various counseling groups speak to the different needs and wants of students on campus, but
there has yet to be one that has not been limited to
a specific issue until now. Officially started last
Monday, Speak2Swatties is a new student-run peer
counseling group that aims to cater to all students
on campus. The group is run by co-founders Megan
Jeffreys 'lO and Melissa Cruz 'lO as well as 12 other

peer counselors.

According to Jeffreys, other counseling groups
on campus are very specialized in their focus and
target certain groups, but Speak2Swatties is universal. The group is open to listen to and discuss
anything and everything that goes on in the lives
of Swarthmore students, added Cruz.
Jeffreys and Cruz realized last year that the
campus was missing a group like Speak2Swatties
where students could go to their peers and talk
about anything.

"We're strictly confiential. We're

Megan Jeffreys 'lO
Co-founder of Speak2Swatties

_

"I've been at the college for 14 years and there

have been several times when people have talked
about peer counseling groups. This is the first time
people have actually followed through," said David
Ramirez, director of Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS).
Although Speak2Swatties is completely separate from CAPS, Ramirez was available to guide
Cruz and Jeffreys through the organizational
process and training.
"My main focus was to answer questions,
address any concerns and help them assess what
some of the major challenges might be," Ramirez
said. The group and Ramirez discussed how to handle confidentiality and other issues that are relevant on such a small campus.
"We're strictly confidential. We're not going to
talk about your problems to another peer counselor in any identifying way," Jeffreys said. Sexual
Health Counselor Eric Glickman 'lO, who is not
part of the peer counseling group, helped teach
techniques essential in peer counseling. "I helped
out with teaching peer counseling skills, helped
them create workshops and generally organize the
service," said Glickman, who also was a peer counselor at a community center over the summer.
Cruz said that the counselors are not merely
available to give advice but sometimes just to listen and be objective and neutral. "We're not
intending to pose as professionals," added Cruz.
The counselors have all undergone training
since the beginning of the school year. "I was very
impressed with the group and the thoughtfulness
of the group. The preparation that they were doing
they didn't just rush into this," Ramirez said. He
added that Speak2Swatties would complement the

'Vantage' without a point

then it stops, rewinds and repeats from the point of
view of a different character, until everything comes
together in a glorious orgy of confusion, panic and
things blowing up.
The film's construction can be frustrating, especially as it becomes clear that there are certain characters whose perspectives are, frankly, irrelevant.
Forest Whitaker as an American tourist glued to his
camcorder turns out to be almost entirely superfluous, although he does the kind of job of making concerned, frightened and panicked faces that only an
Oscar-winner can do. Mostly he's there so that
Dennis Quaid's Secret Service agent can look at his
footage and shout, "Oh my God!" and then dash off

maddeningly.
If "Vantage Point" has more than its fair share of
maddening dashing, it is the rare suspense/mystery/action extravaganza that actually earns them
with its ending. Sure, after the second or third
rewinding, a collective sigh went through the theater, and it seemed for a time that the proletariat
might revolt. But then there was a lot of running, a
lot of car chasing, and a lot of pieces falling into
place. Unlike most thrillers with ludicrously complicated plots, it is possible to follow "Vantage Point,"
and it is possible to guess some (but not all) of the
twists; an immensely satisfactory combination.
Director Pete Travis falls into a few familiar pitfalls
he's a little too impressed with the "rewind"
function on the editing machine
but he and
screenwriter Barry Levy are instrumental in keeping this film afloat. Despite the brief interludes of
useless characters, Levy generally knows whom to
follow, and Travis uses the camera to pick out characters who, even for a brief instance, give a little

more of the mystery away. Given that no one person
has more than 30 minutes of screen-time, the fact
that Travis and Levy help you to care for the fate of
some is impressive. The skilled construction of
"Vantage Point" takes the edge off of the repetitive-

tium-reinforced, indestructible consumer car that
survives about five consecutive crashes and keeps

on plugging and the evil mastermind whose
extremely ingenious plot depends utterly on certain

individuals out of his control behaving in very specific, unpredictable ways.
"Vantage Point" also has minor pretensions to
greatness that would really be better left on the cutting room floor. Most of the ten minutes that we
spend with President Ashton showcase him sermonizing about the proper way to fight the War on
Terror, which doesn't include bombing terrorist
camps in western-friendly Morocco, as his advisors
recommend. "We have the world's sympathy right
now," emotes the President. "We have to honor that."
This pointed criticism of George W Bush's post-9/11
policies would indeed be very pointy, if only
"Vantage Point" wasn't a movie about Arab terrorists and their Plot Against America. Suicide
bombers, hostage situations, Middle-Eastern villains
not exactly the kind of radical new look at geopol-

itics that might give a film the moral high ground.

Finally, the film is inconsistent within its own

world. The gimmick holds that the audience must
only see events from the limited point of view of successive individuals. But Travis can't stop himself
from repeatedly cutting away from the perspective
at hand to the same series of boring, omniscient
you see the crowd in Salamanca from the
shots
same shot and square blow up from the same shot
over and over and over again. Some might say that
this is the auteur cleverly calling attention to the
film's own subjective vantage point. I say, this is the
kind of film that thinks that"auteur" is a new kind
ofcoffee at Starbucks; it's sloppy direction.
Still, most of these critiques could be made of
nearly any stock action film, and "Vantage Point" is
less extreme in its problems and more substantive in
its plotting than most. Sure, the cell phone that
transforms from a sniper's telescopic sight into a detonator may be a little ridiculous, but it doesn't nearly approach the level ofridonkadonk of Will Smith's
alien-technology-compatible "Uploading Virus" computer in "Independence Day." If the biggest problem
of "Vantage Point" is that it thinks it's more interesting than it is, its biggest plus is that it's more
interesting than it has any right to be.

Finally, for the all the poets out

Fashion on the streets of London

Meditation clears mind

McQueen, whose first collection in 1992 introduced a low-cut style of pants that he called

"bumsters," which re-imagined cleavage for
those other lady lumps. That same year,
Vivienne Westwood, who brought punk into
the mainstream, went commando in a dress,
which people discovered when she twirled

around in the courtyard of Buckingham
Palace after being knighted by the Queen. It
was an incident that the Queen herself apparently found amusing. Interestingly, Christian
Siriano (fierce y'all) has worked for both
designers while at fashion school in London. I

MEAGAN HU
It's a Scientific Lifestyle
London is a city steeped in history. The
winding, confusing mazes of roads that compose much of the city streets follow the paths
that the Romans first constructed more than
two millennia ago. It is still the residence of a

much-loved monarch, who, while she now has
only ceremonial significance, represents the
oldest form of government in the UK. The
Queen's guards, stone-faced under their
bearskin hats (despite repeated PETA
protests) as they watch over Buckingham
Palace, are physical manifestations of this
unwavering tradition. But perhaps the most
prevalent and relevant persistence of the past
is the deep-seated English penchant for eccentricity and irony. A recent Vanity Fair piece
by Christopher Hitchens documented the
prevalence of this particular brand of wit
among the British upper class, a fitting
reminder if any of the persistence and seeming
anachronism of old English aristocracy in
today's world. The Marquis of Bath, for example, is known as "Loins of Longleat" because of
his 64 mistresses to whom he refers as
"wifelets." And then there is Sir George
Reresby, who according to the article, created
a "miniature revolver for the special purpose

of shooting wasps."

Perhaps it is true, as the article suggests,
that the British upper class can do this

because cultivating eccentricity requires a
certain amount of leisure time. And if it's
leisure we're talking about, then of course we
must look at the fashion. The late aristocratic
fashion icon Isabella Blow, for example, was
famous for the crazy hats she wore, which
were created by the milliner whom she discovered, Philip Treacy. Almost daily, she wore
eccentric sculptural displays atop her head (a
pair of red lips the size of her face, a minireplica of an 18th century French ship, a lobster)
that made her look like a living animation.
She was responsible for discovering and mentoring the controversial designer Alexander

16

hardly think it is coincidental that he is also
one of the top contenders to win Project
Runway.
But this eccentricity and sarcasm is not
just reserved for the upper crust. It exists in all
levels of English society. Indeed, what makes
British fashion so unique and unlike that of
most other cities is the fact that there is less of
a divide between street fashion and high fashion. For example, Gareth Pugh, Christopher
Kane and Henry Holland, all emerging designers who are fast becoming big names in the
fashion world, are all still closely tied to the
youthful London party scene that inspired
them before they made it big. Holland, for
example, got his start when he and model/BFF
Agyness Deyn decided to make t-shirts in his
apartment silk-screened with dirty rhymes
about fashion designers and models: "My Flies
are Undone Lily Donaldson/' "Give us a
Tickle, Richard Nicoll" (Racier slogans can be
found on his website. Mummy reads this, after
all). And just last week he established himself
as a legitimate designer in his first show at
London Fashion Week, in a collection that was
filled with tartan prints that recalled an aristocratic English sensibility interpreted with
street sense.
Who knows how long Henry Holland's
fame will last, but his sudden appearance onto
the fashion scene, coupled with his humorous
designs, are testament to the playful, do-ityourself spirit that make the streets ofLondon
a veritable runway in itself. People thrive on
seeing and being seen in a way that shows the

individualism that makes this a city of creations rather than copies. And perhaps the
most unique aspect of this is that these
changes and this sense of modernity do not
outshine the past, but rather pay tribute to it
and play alongside it. It's a respect for tradition in a whimsical sort of way. After all,
everyone still reveres the Queen of England,
but she's probably likely to get more attention
and respect nowadays for the fact that she
likes playing her grandson's Nintendo Wii
(Sports Bowling, apparently) than for executing her monarchical duties. And for that, I say
long live the Queen.

JULIAN CHENDER
The Spiritual Scene
The great meditation teacher
Chogyam Trungpa told me "the mind
is like a crazy monkey, which leaps
about and never stays in one place. It
is completely restless and constantly
paranoid about its surroundings. The
training, or the meditation practice, is
a way to catch the monkey, to begin
with. That is the starting point."
I began meditating regularly when
I was a junior in high school. I wanted
to catch the monkey, to train my
mind. I found that through meditation, I could work with my mind and
make friends with myself. When I
came to Swarthmore, I wanted to continue my practice, so I was excited to
see that the Student Wellness
Committee had some meditation
events. Rebekah Rosenfeld 'O7, Sunjay
Barton 'O9 and I turned this into the
Swarthmore Sitting Group, which
Sunjay and I now run.
The Swarthmore Sitting Group
brings the teachings of meditation to

the Swarthmore community. One
meditation teacher I spoke to,

Sakyong Mipham, noted that "meditation is a way to make the mind more
stable and clear. From this point of
view, meditation is not purely a
Buddhist practice; it's a practice that
anyone can do
If we want to undo
confusion, we're going to have to be
responsible for learning what our own
mind is and how it works, no matter
what beliefs we hold."
Catching the monkey has no religious affiliation and the Swarthmore
Sitting Group is completely secular.
Meditation is not a religious practice;
it is just a way to work with one's
mind that anyone can do.
The Sanskrit word for meditation,
shamatha, means "peacefully abid-

meets
a
three
times
week
(Wednesdays at 9 p.m., Thursdays at 8
p.m. and Sundays at 4:30 p.m., all in
Kohlberg 226). People attend different
meetings according to their schedules.
In each meeting we briefly review the
meditation technique. We then meditate for ten minutes, after which we
briefly stretch. Then we meditate for
ten minutes more. At this point, we

have a brief discussion about our
experiences with meditation and we
try to answer each other's questions.
In the end, each meeting lasts about
half an hour.
One reason to meditate might be
that we're tired of the crazy monkey
mind. We're fed up with the confusion, stress, and fear.
"Many of us are slaves to our own
minds," writes Mipham in his national bestseller "Turning the Mind into
an Ally," "Our own mind is our worst
enemy. We try to focus, and our mind
wanders off. We try to keep stress at

bay, but anxiety keeps us awake at
night. We try to be good to the people
we love, but then we forget and put
ourselves first
We're left feeling
helpless and discouraged."
Through meditation, however, we
can get in touch with the joy, clarity
and stability that exist beneath the
cloud of bewilderment. In peacefully
abiding, we can train our minds to
rest here, in this natural state. We
...

have a choice between confusion and

clarity, and meditation is a vehicle
through which one fully realizes this.

And

with the
extremely close race for the democratic

nomination between Clinton and
Obama, a growing number of celebrity
and political endorsements continue to
arise. While some endorsements can be
helpful to a campaign by putting a candidate in the spotlight, others might be
damaging if the public allows itself to
be dissuaded by certain endorsers.
Obama's list of endorsers has continued to grow, and now includes
Morrison,
Young
original Willy
Wonka actor Gene Wilder, and even the
Democratic Party Presidential nominee for the 2004 elections Senator John
Kerry. Recently, however, the high-status publicity Obama has received has
been criticized for taking focus away
from the issues relevant to his campaign.
While some prominent political figures such as Madeleine K. Albright, the
first female to be selected as United
States Secretary of State, have
endorsed Clinton, so have many other
less reputable celebrities. According to
Newsweek, Jenna Jameson, who has
won more than 20 adult film awards
and is the author of the New York
Times Best Seller "How to Make Love
Like a Porn Star" endorsed Clinton in
May 2007. According to Jameson, the
adult film industry prospered during
Clinton administration, and she is
pleased to support Hillary.

The Big Guns
On a recent Saturday Night Live
segment, Tina Fey addressed several of
the popular criticisms that have been
made about presidential candidate

Senator Hillary Clinton. Fey suggested
that one reason Hillary's lead has
recently dwindled is because women
feel that feminism has progressed to the
point where they needn't feel obligated
to vote for a woman, and can rather
vote for whomever Oprah Winfrey tells

them to.
I admit that I hate when people tell
me to support Clinton because I'm a
woman, and that not voting for the first
serious female presidential candidate
would be an egregious act against feminism. I also admit in advance that it's a

little hypocritical to write an article
against following the political advice of
celebrities in response to something a
celebrity said.

But I feel that ultimately there was
some truth in what Fey said, and that
we need to recognize how outrageous it
is when celebrities encourage their

fans to vote for a candidate, and they
listen. Shouldn't we primarily be concerned about who is best qualified to
run our country and hesitant to agree
with propaganda with no questions
asked? Surely we have learned something in the past eight years.
Ever since Oprah first vocalized her
support for Senator Barack Obama,
numerous other celebrities have
entered the campaign arena to support
their preferred presidential candidate
with financial endorsements and
opportunities for additional publicity.

Shouldn't we primarily
be concerned about
who is best qualified to
run our country?
While it is hard to determine
whether the opinions of public figures
hr\ n significantly influenced voters to
give further consideration to certain
politicians, it's clear that Hollywood,
government officials and even professional athletes are getting involved.
Mike Huckabee has the support of
Chuck Norris, Ron Paul has John
Mayer and McCain has Arnold

and

Oprah isn't going to pay
your bills or get our

...

While financially the Clinton campaign benefited from the endorsement,
there has also been hostile criticism
from some of Clinton's more conservative supporters. Similarly to the wellknown Oprah endorsement, high-status
supporters can have negative effects,
with critics questioning the candidate's
relation to the endorsers. How deep
does the public's shallowness run? Both

distracted by the Hollywood glitz and

Swarthmore ideals fail to correct the problems of social justice
week,

Last

while conducting
an otherwise routine triage of my

inbox, I happened
upon a most unexpected email from

YOSHI JOHNSON

My Big Number!

Mr. Anthony Jack,
the
recent
Amherst graduate
whose New York
Times story, you
might recall, I referenced repeatedly
in a column last
semester
on

Swarthmore's

financial aid and
admissions
policies. Aside from a congenial expression of camaraderie,
Mr. Jack wrote to establish a rapport with me, interested
particularly in my thoughts on the practices and policies
of our all-too-similar institutions.
His questions about the on-the-ground realities of race
and class at Swarthmore, though, had me at a loss as to
how I might best respond, especially given Swarthmore's

precipitous capitulation on financial aid policies last
semester, a commendable move in many people's eyes.
And how fitting a subject to ponder the truths about
race and socioeconomic status as they play out on Swat's
since tomorrow the sun sets on yet another
campus
Black History Month. This February's commemoration,
of course, is only the latest iteration of an innumerable
many that have come and gone at Swarthmore.
This time around, though, we are graced with one
more 'tomorrow,' a twenty-ninth day of recognition.
Even this additional time for celebration, however, has
not saved the month from its predictable fate of lackluster observance by a campus too indifferent or too preoccupied with itself to reflect meaningfully on blackness

and black

people.
Swarthmore's

ill-conceived approach to honoring

Martin Luther King, Jr., likewise, passed somewhat
under the campus community's radar, and what's more,
it left ambiguous exactly what the College's commitment
to Dr. King's legacy of social justice might be, especially
since the institution's effective stance was one of "observing without observance." (Haverford, Bryn Mawr and

Penn could spare that day; what costs were so great that
we, at the last, could not?)
Still, in the end it is important to note that these
efforts, while in no way commensurate with the causes
and ideals they sought to honor, were commendable ones
right? I mean, why frame my reflections
nonetheless
for Mr. Jack on race and class realities at Swarthmore
with such a dreary assessment when, however inadequate, these attempts are attempts nonetheless at engaging race- and class-related causes of social justice?
For the same reasons that I admonished Swarthmore
and its half-hearted financial aid and admissions mandates do I now fault the institution for its failure to fully
honor noble ideals in these past few weeks. My deepseated love for the institution and its ideals has once
again gotten the best of me. It makes all the more disheartening the letdown of encountering apathy and poorly formed understandings about what these days of
remembrance and commemoration should mean for us.
As I have written before, at Swarthmore there is a
certainly we have the means to do a great deal
way
more than we do but there is no will. The events leading up to last semester's abruptly announced "no-loans"
policy prove as much, particularly since we were told
only weeks before that "the way" (read: the money) just
wasn't there. On the contrary, our "walking the walk"
was not there, and it was merely that such a practice had
suddenly become unfashionable.
...

been a legitimate explanation for why I cannot treat a
topic with the thoroughness it demands.
Suffice it to say, though, that I will report a good many
more things to Mr. Jack, and I will revisit Swarthmore's
historic crisis in 1969 to demonstrate how, then as now, a
singular problem persists, unresolved: the 'good white
liberal' mentality reigns still at Swarthmore. In predictable fashion, a smug sense of self-congratulation prevails at the expense of real struggle, meaningful reflection, and fully realized ideals. What we get instead is a
paltry substitute for justice. As soon as I can, I will make
available an extended version of this column on my blog.

As I have written before, at
Swarthmore there is a way
certainly we have the means to do a
great deal more than we do but
there is no will.
Dr. King, in his 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail,
put into words what I and many others encounter when
wrestling with the status quo and its keepers, not only at
Swarthmore or Amherst, but everywhere. Dr. King, you
see, also confessed his grave disappointment with a certain mindset, that of the "white moderate
who prefers
a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice."
He concludes, "Shallow understanding from people of
good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will," and admonishes those
...

Swarthmore's ill-conceived approach
to honoring Martin Luther King, Jr.,
likewise, passed somewhat under
the campus community's radar.
I could hark back to a commitment the institution
made to its students
and itself forty years ago next
January to better illustrate how these seemingly disparate issues —admissions practices and an apathy
about black people, that is
are all symptoms of the
same problem, but the word limit on this column unfortunately precludes me from such an explication. I have
probably exhausted this excuse at this point, I'll concede,
but with the exception of my last column, it has always

who believe that they can paternalistically set a
timetable for social justice. For Mr. Jack and me, I think,
this problem bears directly on the matter at hand: how
our institutions choose to admit and aid students; how
they treat issues of race and class; and how they honor
causes of social justice more generally.
The way in which Swarthmore's no-loans policy came
to be is representative of this larger problem. You will
forgive me, then, if I wax discontent when, with the
means to an end so obviously within grasp, our dream
remains inexplicably deferred.

to use a term conservative social critic
Shelby Steele used to describe an equivalent group among black activists
argue? Or were their posters mocking and
appropriating the use of queer terminology, as the "fabulously queer" posters
claimed? The College Republicans pulled
out all the petty stops.
A letter by group president Justin

Tatiana Cozzarelli 'OB, a potential lightning rod for criticism on the issue. Too

Clothes Line Saga
It is easy to make too much of nothing
at Swarthmore. The College Republicans
blanket campus with posters urging students to "come out" as Republicans and a
few queer students put up other posters
denouncing the appropriation of queer
terminology.
Judging by the popular comments sec-

tion of the

Daily Gazette on articles about
this issue, many students felt these queer

students were taking things too seriously
in getting up in arms about the original
posters. Some of the critics were queer

THE PHOENIX

Republicans face the same kind of overt
or implicit discrimination that queer students do on campus. In his letter, Shaffer

made the claim that "academia has tended
to be increasingly liberal recently and the
speech rights of conservative students
appear to be impinged upon." He has presented no evidence to back up such an
argument. There is no reason to accept
the notion that Swarthmore is part of a
perceived oppressive liberal academy, as
no one has even tried to put forth this
argument
besides half thought-out
encouragements for Republicans here to
"come out."
The fact is that coming out as queer
says a lot more about one's intrinsic place
in our society than admitting to conserva-

tive views. Sure, some students here may
find the idea that someone could actually

be a Republican shocking. And yes, that
aversion to Republicans does not foster
the friendliest environment for those with

minority political opinions.

It is laughable to suggest
that Republicans face the
same kind of overt or
implicit discrimination that
queer students do
...

But such a quality is mutable, unlike
the permanence of being queer. Distaste
for a political opinion is not such a fundamental judgment about a person as is
one's rejection of a person's sexuality. The
question remains: was this really a fight
about nothing? Maybe it was just a bunch
of posters, all of which were offensive to
varying degrees for different people.

What could be most significant is not
the issue of the posters, but how the
debate transpired. Last week's Phoenix
editorial gave a backhanded compliment
to three queer students (the same students
responsible for the anonymous response
posters) for their signed op-ed on this

February 28, 2008

issue, by arguing that the debate should
not include anonymous voices. Shaffer
first put forward this line of reasoning in
his letter to the Gazette. Such arguments
are calling for all queer students who
want to participate in the debate to come
out. One cannot enter the debate, the
argument goes, unless one is willing to
put one's name and one's identity on the
line. There is a lot to be said for privileging the acceptance of responsibility for
one's words. But it is a lot easier for dominant groups (in this case, non-queers) to
make this claim, when revealing their
identity does not give them a subjugated
identity.
The Republicans' posters stayed up,
anonymously
everyone had their say
and self-identified
and everyone went
home feeling a little more self-righteous
and marginalized. Queer activists will
continue to fight from a position of weakness in a heteronormative
society;
Republicans will continue to fight against
the non-oppressive, vaguely progressive
academy. And at the latter group's meetings, members will claim to be
"Rockefeller Republicans," opposed to the
national party's homophobic social policy. Would we be so cynical as to absolve a
supposed abolitionist Democrat on the
eve of the Civil War sitting by smugly as
his party defended slavery?

We want to hear from you!

SBC budget increase will benefit campus
This week, Student Council denied a request for chartering
a student group, Punk-turn!!!, telling them to return next
semester to ask for funding again. The reason given for the
denial: money. The request is still hotly contested, however,
among the members of the Student Council. Punk-tum!!!'s case
is notable because students were asking for between $ll,OOO and
$16,000 to fund a full color, high gloss art publication unlike
any publication currently produced by students at the college.

We applaud the Board of Managers for
making the decision to increase the
student activity fee, given the need to
maintain funding for other student

groups

...

While many students perceive most entities of the college to
be exceedingly well funded, SBC's budget is limited, and is
being stretched thin by the needs of the student groups it
funds. Each year, the student activities fee, which is paid by
all students at the start of each year and is used to fund SBC,
has typically been increased to keep pace with the monetary
demand from students wishing to form new clubs, literary
magazines and intramural sports. For the past three years,
however, the student activities fee was not increased at all. As
a result, the SBC has found itself in an increasingly difficult
financial situation.

Letters and opinion pieces represent the
views of their writers and not those of the
Phoenix staff. All letters and op-eds must
be signed and have the writer's contact
information.

The students seeking funding for Punk-tum!!! have been told
to request a charter next semester when the SBC's budget will
not be as tightly constrained. Fortunately, $22,000 more has
been allocated for SBC starting next year, funded through an
increase in the student activity fee. This was approved at last
weekend's Board of Managers meeting, as part of the increase
in tuition and fees for the next fiscal year. We applaud the
Board of Managers for making the decision to increase the student activity fee, given the need to maintain funding for other
student groups and the eight new student groups added this
year to the college.
The money raised from student activity fee is not actually
controlled by the administration, but rather overseen and dispersed by the SBC, a committee comprised entirely of students.
The system stands out as one of the few that allows student
oversight of money spent at the college. The money allocated
by the SBC is used entirely to fund the diverse array of student
activities here at Swarthmore, ranging from SQU to Quiz Bowl.
Such diversity of options is a privilege, and we must recognize

would be regrettable for Student Council to be forced to deny
in the future due solely to fiscal constraints. All the while, we hope that the SBC will continue to
spend its money wisely and frequently, as any money not spent
each year gets put into the capital replacement fund and cannot be rolled over for use in the next fiscal year. Ultimately, the
diverse range of groups and events on campus are free for us

the student activity fee of only $l6 per student is worth the benefit to all Swarthmore students.

Women's track excels at Keogh, Princeton
BY JAYMES FAIRFAX-COLUMBO
ifairfal@swarthmore.edu

With just one week left until the Centennial Conference
Championships at Ursinus College, the Swarthmore indoor
track and field women showed why they have a reputation
for being graceful and gritty.
The Garnet swept in numerous season-best and
Conference qualifying performances, taking both the
Greater Philadelphia Area and the state of New Jersey by
storm.

"I'm excited to see what they can do

at Conferences."

Andrew Vanßuren 'ID
The action started fast and furious at the Haverford
College Keogh Invitational, as Nyika Corbett 'lO and Bess
Ritter 'O9 competed in the mile run.
Corbett started in the back of the pack and worked her
way up fluidly through the field, posting a season-best time
of 5:19.36in the process. This time also landed Corbett on the
Swarthmore top ten list again. Corbett also happens to be
Swarthmore's women's indoor mile record holder.
Ritter also recorded a strong performance, dropping
down in distance to place second in her heat in 5:3L49, well
faster than the Conference qualifying standard of 5:59.56.

The rest of the Garnet women were just as impressive.
Lauren Deluca 'lO ran a strong race in the 800 meters, stopping the clock at 2:30.91 well inside the Conference standard
of 2:38.83.
Emma Stanley 'O9 and Faith Pampel 'O9 each had stellar
outings in the 3000 meters, running together for most of the
race to record Conference qualifying times of 11:23.21 and
11:28.31 respectively.

Field athletes Heather Hightower 'O9 and Nathalie
Degaiffier 10 both closed out their regular-season rookie
campaigns with strong performances as well.
Degaiffier sped down the track in the 200 meters and ran
a leg of the 4 x 400 meter relay in addition to long jumping
3.98 meters, a mark that tied her personal best.
Hightower was also in top form, launching the shot put
8.34 meters, a personal record and Conference qualifying
performance. When asked about her Conference mark,
Hightower replied, "It's my first season, so I was kind of surprised about making Conferences. I talked to Coach Carroll,
Coach Noon and Coach Tom and they told me that it was my
first season and so to focus on improvement. But I told them
I'm gonna do it' and I did."
Hightower's performance didn't surprise throws coach
Tom 'Gladiator' Reynolds, however. Of Hightower's mark,
he said, "I'm unbelievably excited. I don't think Heather has
even tapped the beginning of her potential. This is just a
sign of things to come."
While the rest of the Garnet women's team was cruising
through the competition at Haverford, Cait Mullarkey 'O9
had her sights set on some stiff competition at the Princeton
Invitational. Mullarkey competed in the 800 meters, placing

NYU women slip past Garnet

seventh among some tough Division I and 111 competitors.
Mullarkey recorded an indoor best time of 2:19.58. The
race also served as an indicator of what the Centennial
Conference Championships will be like, as Mullarkey's two
closest competitors were in the race
and for those short of
memory, it was Mullarkey leading the charge down the
homestretch last year and to a gold medal.
If this week's performances are an indication of the
future, the Garnet women should be optimistic for
Conferences. According to Andrew Vanßuren 'lO, a member
of the men's team, "The ladies looked sharp on Saturday, but
then again, they always look sharp... I'm excited to see what
they can do at Conferences."

"They told me that it was my first
season and so to focus on

improvement. But I told them 'l'm
gonna do it' and I did."
Heather Hightower 'O9
The Garnet women will close out the indoor season at the
Centennial Conference Championships, beginning at noon
on Satuday at Ursinus College, March 1, and continuing at
10:30 a.m. on Sunday, March 2.

Phoenix but had no role in theproduction of this article.

Men fall to NYU, smash Muhlenberg
The men went 1-2 in doubles play,
with Jonathan Lo "08 and Kevin
Shaughnessy 'O9 winning the first doubles match 8-0, while the Garnet dropped
second and third doubles by 9-7 and 8-6
scores, respectively.
The singles competition was extremely competitive. Shaughnessy won in
three sets (second singles), as did Mark
Greenburg 'O9 (fifth), coming back to win
2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, while J.J. England won a
tough 2-set affair, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7). However,
NYU stood tall at the first, third and
sixth positions, holding on for their 5-4

win.
The team, though disappointed with
the loss, did not hang its head. "I told the
guys after the [NYU] match I was proud
of the fight they had in them and that is
what will have to be the trademark of
this team," said coach Jason Box.
The Garnet rebounded the very next
day, slaughtering Muhlenberg College 90 without so much as dropping a set.
Greenburg and England kept up their

play, combining to win the second doubles match 8-0, then splitting up to dominate their singles matches: England
(third) won 6-4, 6-0 and Greenburg
(fourth) won 6-0, 6-L The team is now 1-0

in the Centennial Conference.
"I told the team I did not want to let
leads get away from us like they did in
the doubles on Saturday," Box said. "The
whole focus of today's match was to put
away the opponent and not let them back
into the match. Our guys were able to
execute this game plan very well."
The men's team will not play again
until spring break, when they will head
to California for a few days of intense
playing.
With the first weekend of competition
under its belt, the prospects look very
bright for the men's tennis team, for as
Box says, "If this team will continue to
work as hard as they have the last few
weeks, we have the chance to do some
good things this season."

and Midyette (fourth),
the Swarthmore women lost 4 out of
the 6 singles matches, leading to a
frustrating 5-4 loss.
Coach Jeremy Loomis thinks it
was a winnable match, but he is optimistic that the close loss will serve as
a building block for the rest of the season. "Lots of team matches this year
could come down to a few games and
which team has a better team atmosphere," he said.
Their next match will be this
Saturday, as they open Centennial
Conference play against McDaniel

There were such high-

The first leg of the knockout stages provided much
entertainment, controversy and discussion for enthusiastic pundits and fans. The usual spats over whether a
red card was deserved (Materazzi's was obviously not),
the penalties not given, the blame placed on referees and
the unfortunate missed opportunities (thank you
Adebayor) set up an enjoyable round of matches next
week.
Now I realize I'm probably being a hypocrite by saying this, as I passionately support Milan, but it is slightly unfair that we see pretty much the same teams making it to the latter stages of the competition. While this
no doubt will increase the number of fans watching the
games as well as the publicity and media attention, it
makes this game a lot more predictable and, hence, less
exciting.

BY SETH GREEN
sgreen3@swarthmore.edu

This past Saturday, men's basketball took a hard-fought Senior Day
game against Haverford College to
overtime, before falling 78-70.
Prior to the game, head coach Lee
Wimberly thanked seniors Chris
Nana-Sinkam 'OB, Noam Fliegelman
'OB, Steve Wolf 'OB, Matt Kurman 'OB
and lan McCormick 'OB for their many
contributions to the program. Kurman
recently scored his I,oooth career
point, while McCormick has been the
recipient of numerous awards this season; he recently broke the Swarthmore
record for career rebounds.
The game, cheered on by an estimated 900 fans (many of whom had
bused over from Haverford), was led
by McCormick, who posted 20 points
and 18 rebounds. Towering over
Haverford's defense, McCormick made
it look easy by sinking shot after shott
from the paint. As long as the team got
him the ball, he seemed capable of
dropping it right in.
Kurman said, "lan McCormick had
arguably the best season ever in our

conference, as he was the first player
in the history of the conference to average 20 points and 10 rebounds. He will

probably go down as the best player to
ever play at Swarthmore."
Kurman, who has a tight passing
routine with Fliegelmann, often passing the ball back and forth multiple
times to confound the defense, scored
17 points of his own, including five
graceful three-pointers.

"I was impressed by
the fact that the team
never gave up...
all year."
Coach Lee Wimbley
The Fords established a 13 point
lead at the 12:43 mark of the second
half. Ryan Carmichael 'll closed the
gap with two three pointers, leaving
the game 58-56 Haverford, part of a
remarkable 23-5 Swarthmore run that
brought the Garnet right back into the
thick of the game.
Though the Garnet, led by Matt
Allen 'lO, established a brief lead,
Haverford proved up to the challenge
and regulation finished with the teams

tied at 63. The Fords established a lead
in overtime and did not relinquish it.

Swarthmore finishes the season

with a 2-16 record in the Centennial
Conference and 6-19 overall.
Afterward, Wimberly lamented the
unimpressive win-loss record the team
compiled for the season. In many
ways, the record does not reflect the

team's level of play. The Garnet lost
six out of its seven overtime games and
suffered many narrow defeats against
Centennial Conference powerhouses.
However, he continued, "I was
impressed by the fact that the team
never gave up in any game all year and
played very hard for 25 games."
Kurman said that the game mirrored their whole season. "We were
ultra-competitive in nearly every
game, yet seemed to find a way to lose

so many of the close games rather than
win." Overall, he said, the season has
been frustrating. "We came in with
high expectations after missing playoffs by one game last year. With the
amount of talent we had, we really
should have won more games."
Still, it's about more than basketball. Though they are sad to end the
season, Kurman said the seniors will
"continue being best friends off the
court."

Milan have remarkably won the cup twice and made
it to the finals three times, semi-finals once and quarterfinals once, all in the last 5 years! Manchester United,
Liverpool, Barcelona and Chelsea usually reach the
quarterfinals stage as well.
While the better teams will probably continue to
reach for Europe's most prized footballing asset, there
can be some changes made to the structure of the
Champions League that can promote involvement
among lower level clubs.
I think much of the problem resides in the initial
qualification set-up. Currently, Italy, Spain and England,
the nations with the best domestic leagues, are allowed
four teams to participate in the tournament, Germany
and France three apiece, while the rest of the countries
have two or one, some even having none.

Michel Platini, currently running to be president of
UEFA, asserts, "Four clubs are too many for the country
itself, the fans and TV rights. Three should be the limit.
There are not enough national champions in the last 32
of the tournament and that cannot be right."
I agree. The Champions League should involve at
least one club from every country in Europe with a
domestic league. The more nations represented, the
more there is a sense of pride and competition associated with winning the Champions League. It would be
much more sensible because smaller clubs would have
the chance to play with bigger fish and their global fan
base would increase.
In addition, it would also add to the intensity of
domestic competitions as teams would be fighting much
harder for the top three places to get the chance to qualify for Europe.
Some of you might argue the Champions League is
only for Europe's elite, which is why there is the less
prestigious UEFA Cup for the lower level clubs.
Unfortunately, the UEFA Cup doesn't bring nearly as
much entertainment due to its lack of global appeal,
hence it isn't as financially profitable as the Champions
League. Isn't it wonderful how money makes our world
go round?
I'm tired of the same teams reaching the same stages.
Remember the time when Porto (or Mourinho?) took
everyone by storm and won the finals? In fact, their
opponents were Monaco, another surprise contender.
That was unpredictable and exciting to watch. But whatever, I guess for next week's deciders I'll revert back to
the hypocrite that I am. Forza Milan!

With 5:22 remaining, Grigsby put back

back hastily, however, regaining the lead
and extending the gap between the teams
to eight points. A last second shot from
Ceylan Bodur 'll cut the margin to five
and regained momentum for the Garnet
going into halftime.
After the half, the action continued as
the two rival squads continued to battle it
out on the court. Haverford again went on
an early run, extending their lead to nine
points. Kristen Traband 'OB cut off the
streak, beating a Haverford defender with
a powerful post move and putting two
points on the board for the Garnet.

however. Two completed foul shots from

Led by Popovics, Swarthmore took
over the overtime play with a vengeance.
Popovics sunk a three with three minutes

Haverford tried to battle back, grabbing a basket of their own, but Popovics
answered back once again with another
three-pointer with less than a minute to
go, and then with five seconds in the
game, she made another three-point play,
tallying a total of ten overtime points and

leading the Garnet women to victory.
The overtime win against Haverford
was a perfect finale for Senior Day. "It
really meant a lot to win the last game of
my athletic career with a win," said
Traband. "The fact that we won in overtime made it that much sweeter," she said.
Captain Karen Berk 'OB agreed, saying
that "clinching the win against Haverford
was the best way to end the season."

has made significant-contributions to the
team in their time at Swarthmore, and they
will be greatly missed in the future.
Coach Renee DeVarney said that all of
the seniors will leave behind powerful
legacies after their graduation in June.
"Traband's spirit and leadership has left
a deep impression on the team. She is an
outstanding example of someone who perseveres daily, with a positive attitude, who
left a very positive impression on the team.
Popovics had the best year of her career.

It was great to see her growth. Berk is

irreplaceable. She had some amazing
games in her career and her records will
stand for a long time in the books. All will
be sorely missed," the coach said.
The Garnet also picked up a win at
Washington College last Wednesday, 68-65.
These two wins bring the Garnet's overall
season record to 8-16 overall (6-13 CC).
These wins provided Swarthmore's
women's basketball team with a solid ending, and something they hope to once
again improve upon next year.

Men's track makes a run at Keogh invite
BY NYIKA CORBETT

Last Friday, the Swarthmore men's Indoor Track
Team traveled to Haverford College to compete in the
Keogh Invitational, their last meet before the Centennial
Conference Championships.

"[l] probably would have gone
faster if I were being chased by a
rabid animal, but Shoopie was
close enough."
Ross Weller 'OB
None of Swarthmore's hefty throwing squad qualified
for conferences, but Max Wilson 'lO remained optimistic
about the next phase of the team's development. "Now
that winter season is over, we can all concentrate on
javelin and discus events that favor the physique of our
guys," he said.
These outdoor events are also ones in which the
throws coach Tom Reynolds, a previous Centennial
Conference Champion, particularly exceeds.

THE PHOENIX

Other notable efforts from the field came with the performance of Brendan McVeigh 'll, who pole vaulted to a
season personal record of ten feet and six inches. This
height earned McVeigh a sixth place finish in the meet
and a very near miss of the conference qualifying standards.
On the track, many of the men had stellar days, with
five runners posting Conferences-qualifying times.
Connor Darby 'O9 ran a 54 second 400 m, clocking the first
qualifying time of the evening.
Teammates Chris Mayer-Bacon 'll and Kwame Osei
11 also gave solid efforts, though not quite running qualifying times.
This race was Osei's debut on the track and an affirmation of his development as a runner. Asked what he
thought about his race, Osei said, "For my first time racing, it was pretty good." Like the throwers, this freshman
from California is looking forward to an exciting outdoor
season.
The next qualifying time came from Andrew
Vanßuren 'lO, who ran a spectacular time of 4:42 in the
mile. Teammate Seth Green 'lO ran a strong 800, posting
a time of 2:10 that missed qualifying by tenths of a second.
To finish the evening, a pack of Swarthmore's lean,
mean, distance machines rocked the 3k, with three of the
men running qualifying times.
They were led by Ross Weller 'OB whose Cheshire-grin
showed just how happy he was to be back on the track

February 28, 2008

after a season plagued with injury and the imminent
threat of life in the working world after Swarthmore.
Pleased with his time of 9:13, Weller commented that
he "probably would have gone faster if I were being
chased by a rabid animal, but Shoopie was close
enough." Jonathan Shoop 'OB and Micah Katz 'OB followed
Weller with times of 9:20 and 9:28, respectively.

"We made some big improvements
The men's team is really coming
together."

...

At the end of the day, Coach John Noon was content
with the team's solid performance. "We made some big
improvements this week, with many of the guys qualifying or barely missing conference qualifying standards.
The men's team is really coming together."
With all of these encouraging performances, the track
team
is readying
itself for
the
Conference
Championships, which are to be held this Saturday and
Sunday, March 1 and 2, at Ursinus College in
Collegeville, Pa.

The men's (6-4, 5-1) and women's (6-5, 43) swim teams concluded an impressive
season with second place finishes at the
Centennial Conference Championships,

held Feb. 22-24. Both teams brought home
24 medals and numerous records, and the
women's team will send two swimmers,
Anne Miller 'lO and Jennie Lewis 'OB, to
the NCAA Division 111 championships.
"Swimming is not a traditional team
sport, but there is no way that we could
have gotten second place without all of the
team there. Every race matters, and I'm
really proud of how the team rose to the
occasion," Doug Gilchrist-Scott 'O9 said. "It

year I finally got it. Also, because it was
the first day, it was great motivation for
the rest of the weekend," he recalled.
Gilchrist-Scott also took bronze in the 100yard freestyle, his second school record.
Satterfield (5 medals) also brought in
big points for the men's team, winning the
silver in the 200-yard breaststroke and the

Distance swimmers Stephen Shymon

to have Doug's schedule. [Nonetheless] I
am really glad with my performance last
weekend. Add to that my love of big, shiny
objects and you have a recipe for a great

time," Frampton added.
The men's team picked up big points
with bronze medal-winning finishes in
four relays, the 200-yard freestyle relay
(Santiago Lombo 'll, Tom Kelleher 'O9,
Michael Ahn 'lO and Gilchrist-Scott), the
200-medley and 400-medley relays (Lombo,
Satterfield, Brian Roth 'O9 and GilchristScott) and the 400 freestyle-relay (Ahn,
Frampton, John Heagy 'OB and GilchristScott).
Additionally, the women's side picked
up silver medals in the 200-yard freestyle
relay (Franny Zhang 'OB, Julia Wrobel 'lO,
Chelsea Brett 'll and JennieLewis '08) and
the 400-yard medley relay (Allie Jordan
'O9, Stephanie Su 'll, Anne Miller 'lO and
Brett). They won the bronze in the 800yard freestyle relay (Allison Bishop 'll
Zhang, Brett, Miller) and the 200-yard medley relay (Jordan, Su, Miller, Lewis).
Miller said that she enjoys the cooperative element of relays, which she described
as her favorite events. "Swimming is
viewed as an individual sport, but the
team comes through [in relays]. To time
your starts so you don't get disqualified,
you really have to know your teammates,"
Miller said. Jordan said that the team's
energy was immediately visible. "From
the start, we were all on fire," she said.
The women's team was led by strong
individual performances from Miller (6
medals, 2 school records, 2 Centennial
Conference Meet records, 1 Centennial
Conference record and 2 NCAA qualifying
times) and Lewis (4 medals, 1 school
