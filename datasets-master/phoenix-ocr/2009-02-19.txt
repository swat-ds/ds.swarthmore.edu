FROM THE FEB. 12, 2009 ISSUE:
The article entitled “Israeli-Palestinian conflict sparks discussion”
incorrectly quotes Jake Rubin as saying that many students who
have ties to Israel found Israel’s actions “horrendous.” Rubin actually meant that many who have ties to Israel “do not agree with all
of Israel’s actions.”
The article entitled “Economy disrupts hiring” incorrectly quotes linguistics professor Theodore Fernald as saying that a full-time position has been canceled. A more accurate characterization of the
situation would be that a position that ordinarily would be full-time

Tasers help prevent crime beyond the Borough
BY SARAH POZGAY
slong6@swarthmore.edu
The Borough of Swarthmore Police
Department hardly elicits images ofcrime
fighting at its most stirring. Nor does the
low-key community demand such force.
Yet Borough police are among the first in
law enforcement to record criminal
encounters through the use of videoequipped Taser guns.
"I'm not aware of any other departments [in Pennsylvania] at this point that
have the cameras," Borough Chief of
Police Brian Craig said. The Tasers, each
of which holds a small video camera in the

base of its handle, cost about $1,500 per

unit, a considerable sum but small in comparison to the $5,000 police car cameras
more commonly used by departments
across the state.
The Borough department's experience
with the stun guns has contributed to support for a Pennsylvania House bill which
would allow the Tasers to record audio in
addition to the video function. As things
stand, the audio function is prohibited
under Pennsylvania's Wiretapping and
Electronic Surveillance Control Act. The
new bill, introduced by Delaware County
Representative Brian Lentz, would create
an exception in the act to allow the use of
the Tasers' audio recording function in
addition to the video.
Craig described an incident in Morton,
Pennsylvania when Swarthmore police
were assisting the local department and a
Taser's camera took footage of a woman
holding a knife in her lap, refusing to
raise her hands. The video alone failed to
capture the context of the situation, in
which officers repeatedly asked the
woman to raise her hands. An audio
recording function, in addition to the
video, would have provided police with
evidence for justification had the use of
force become necessary, according to
Craig
Though the Morton woman was not
Tased, the situation sheds light on the limited effectiveness of video recordings
alone. According to a recent Philadelphia
Daily News article, similar situations
have prompted the Pennsylvania Chiefs of
Police Association, which Craig met with

community members than through the

alone does.
Craig commented on the ease with
which these crimes might be prevented
through practicing a little caution, noting
also that similar advice might be given to
Swarthmore students. "The warnings I
give to people in the Borough would be the
same ones I'd give to the college: keep
your doors locked; be aware of your surroundings; walk around with friends and
not by yourself." Craig added that though
the town and campus are generally very
safe, "it can happen anywhere."
Other offenses in the area have consisted largely of vandalism. This past
Friday in Rutledge all four tires of a car
were slashed, and only this Tuesday, officers noted the results of a series of mailbox and street sign vandalisms throughout Swarthmore.

they should provide tables in
the bathrooms so students could

very much defined by race,"
Eldridge said.
Eldridge gained a broader
view of the world when he
attended a diverse, progressive
boarding school run by two
Swarthmore graduates. With
their guidance, he applied to
Swarthmore as well as Oberlin,
Wesleyan and Tufts. He decided on Swarthmore with high
hopes. "I thought it would be as
progressive as my boarding
school. It wasn't."
During his four years at
Swarthmore, Eldridge spent
several terms as the only black
student on campus. The predominantly

lacked professors of color.
Eldridge only saw people of his
own race cleaning the dormitories and working in the
kitchen.
A student question prompted Eldridge to share the fact
that he took a year off from
school after his sophomore
year, in part due to these tensions.
He spent much of his sophomore spring organizing students to go to a desegregation
march in D.C. This stress, compounded with racial difficulties, including receiving hate
mail, caused his spirits and his
grades to suffer. The deans
decided that he should leave
for a while, one even telling

Religion department announces new staff
On Wednesday, Feb. 18, the religion department announced that
Gwynn Kessler, an assistant profes-

sor of Jewish Studies, Rabbinic
Literature, and Gender Studies at the
University of Florida, Gainsville, has
accepted a tenure-track position in
Jewish Studies at Swarthmore.
Professor Kessler will take up her
new position in the fall of 2009.
According to Department Chair
Steven Hopkins' official announcement, Kessler has a Ph.D. in
Rabbinics with a specialization in
Midrash. In addition, her work has
focused on issues of gender withrelation to Judaism. "Her current
research uses feminist and queer theories to interpret (and critique) rabbinic constructions of gender and the
body," Hopkins said in the announce-

ment.

Her first book, titled "Conceiving
Israel: The Fetus in Rabbinic
Narratives," is due to be published
this year.
Kessler said that she decided to
accept Swarthmore's offer because of
the quality of both the faculty and
students she found here. "During my
on-campus interview, I was very
impressed with the sincerity, intelligence, interest, and warmth of the
students. I was also delighted about
their expressed interests in studying
texts, which is one of the primary
points of my own scholarly and
teaching work," she said in an email.
The decision to offer the post to
Kessler represents the end of a
months-long search. According to
Tariq al-Jamil, an assistant professor
in the religion department, the
search committee conducted prelimi-

THE PHOENIX

nary interviews in November of 2008,

eventually narrowing down the
applicant pool to three finalists, who
each came to Swarthmore and gave
job talks in December and January.

The search committee,- which
included members of the religion
department's faculty, worked with
faculty from other departments as
well, according to al-Jamil. A range
ofother members-ofthe Swarthmore
community were also consulted,
including students.
According to Hopkins, the search
committee chose Kessler from "over
including scholars
150 applicants
doing work in dozens of areas in
Jewish studies." While Kessler had
many outstanding qualities that set
her apart from the rest of the field,
Hopkins emphasized her broad
appeal for the community. "Gwynn
was the students' main choice," he
said.
The search committee was also
excited by Kessler's range of talents
and interests. She is expected to
work with the Gender and Sexuality
Studies Program, as well as with the
religion department. These interests
will also likely affect the course offerings of the religion department.
According to Hopkins, some courses
will probably explore "areas of gender and the body," which he says
"interfaces with what a variety of us
do."
While the dismal economic climate is a factor in almost every
move, at Swarthmore and elsewhere,
it did not affect the hiring decision.
"We hired who we wanted," Hopkins
said.

were posted, ranging
from readers lauding her for being so daring, to others outraged at her carelessness. The drama surrounding this was intensely heightened by the
shoes' $640 price tag. Though she did buy them on
sale, $4OO-plus is still a lot of money for the average
person to spend on shoes, and in today's economy,
her intentionally practical and innocent decision
touched a nerve. Susie Bubble of the blog "Style
Bubble" actually did a similar thing by pouring coral
nail polish on black pumps, but despite her much
larger readership, there was no great debate. No one
made a negative comment, probably because the
shoes were a mere £2.50 at H&M.
Price tag aside, there is a distinction between doit-yourself projects and altering existing clothing.
Although the two often intersect, in most cases D.I.Y.
is seen as an economical way to copy a designer's
piece. Camille's blog features many instances of this,
with homemade Pleasure Principle skull t-shirts,
Raquel Allegra shredded t-shirts, and Miu Miu
inspired puff skirts among them. To make such
shirts, she obviously has to alter already made tshirts, but no one really cares about cutting up
Hanes t-shirts. Marni wedges, however, are seen as a
work of art by the fashion community. To alter them,
especially with something like Sharpie markers, is
equal to splattering paint on the Mona Lisa.
Her reasoning for the decision was economical in
a way. Because the platform of the shoes were nude
colored and most of her closet consists of black,
white and gray, she didn't wear them often.
Although this is fair, it does seem sacrilegious to desecrate the design of the shoes. One does not buy a
pair of $6OO shoes for practical reasons; one buys
them because of the design and workmanship that
goes into them. If she wanted a pair ofblack wedges,
she could 1ve just bought a pair for a fraction of that
price.

Yet, in terms of creativity, shouldn't altering a
design be more praiseworthy than D.I.Y. imitation?
With people so concerned about the exclusiveness of
high fashion, shouldn't the opportunity to co-opt
haute couture be appreciated? Yes, but money is
once again the complicating factor. It's a paradox
that makes the idea of taking fashion back into one's
hands a lot more difficult than it sounds. After paying that much money for clothing, do you really
want to do anything besides wear it? If you were
going to buy such an item, you probably have an
interest in the designer or piece in the first place, so
it doesn't really make sense to alter it. Such a decision seems irrational, and in Camille's case, the fact
that she is only 16 years old caused critics to accuse
her of being too young to appreciate the value of
hard-earned money and making an irresponsible,
not bold, decision.
At the end of the day, none of her readers, myself
included, can control what she, or anyone else, does
with her clothes. Once owned, clothes are personal
possessions, and one can do whatever one wants
with them. In a way, that is the most exciting part of
fashion
the design is perfectly nice, but it's how
one wears it and makes it one's own, perhaps even
through alteration, that makes style truly interesting.

Dance concert showcases faculty talent
BY MAKI SOMOSOT
msomosol@swarthmore.edu

Dance, one of the most versatile
art forms, transforms the body into

an instrument which expresses, communicates, inspires and changes. The
vivacity and flexibility that characterize the art of dance were present in
the Faculty Dance Concert, which
took place on the evening of Feb. 14 at
LPAC, presented by the department
of music and dance. This year's concert featured a varied collection of
dances performed by Pallabi
Chakravorty, Dolores Luis Gmitter,
Isaburoh Hanayagi, Sally Hess, Lisa
Kraus, C. Kemal Nance, R. Jeannine
Osayande, JumatatuPoe and Stephen
Welsh.
The department wanted to educate
the audience about the relationship
between dance and social change.
True to form, the concert incorporated unique, contemporary choreography
that challenged conventional
notions of dance, such as Sally Hess'
"Slow Forward With One Exception,"
a yoga asana piece; Jumatatu Poe's
"Flight Attendants," a theatrical
piece that portrayed commonplace
figures in a sinister light; and R.
Jeannine Osayande's "Justifying
Grace," Osayande's rumination on
her African-American heritage
which honored six generations ofher
family, to name only a few.
challenged
"The performances
the boundaries that I had about dance
by showing me the possibilities that
exist in performance," Lisa Sambat
'lO said. "Dance is more than just

physical movement; it is also a way to
tell a story, express your experiences
and provide social commentary."

The concert also showcased a
diverse representation of dance styles
from countries all over the world,
such as Japan, Africa, India and
Spain. Isaburoh Hanayagi, in traditional Japanese dress, performed a
native Japanese dance called "Kuni(A
iri-Yakko"
Spear
Carrier
Returning to His Home Province), in
which the only prop used was a spear.
The minimalist set-up of"Kuni-iriYakko" accentuated a focus on
Japanese cultural tradition; a spear
signified the yakko's role to clear the
way for the lord's procession from his
home to the capital. "Kathak," a
North Indian classical form of dance
that depicted an unconventionally
lovelorn Krishna longing for Radha,
elicited hoots from the audience.
An equally explosive reaction
from the audience accompanied the

fierce flamenco rhythms that propelled "Solea del Alma Mia," a single
dance uniting three musically related
flamenco works. This traditional yet
rousing flamenco piece was my personal favorite, with Stephen Welsh's
quirky, satirical James Bond-esque
piece "Caught in the Crosshairs"
coming in at a close second. "Caught
in the Crosshairs," a fun, light mockery of James Bond's pop-culture
stature set to slick electronica,
showed the dancer Eng Matthews as
the eponymous British spy, attempting to follow the instructions being
issued by a disembodied voice of

authority.
"I really liked [Poe's] 'Flight
Attendants' piece and the traditional
Japanese dance, but there was some
room for improvement when it came
to the others," Lizah Masis 'l2 said.
Indeed, it is safe to assume that this
tradition will continue to change in
ways that we can only imagine.

Shinn's 'Hedda Gabler': mess or masterpiece?
Irene Fornes, according to his representation at the New
Dramatists Service. Kushner has praised him at length,

BY ANNE COLEMAN

acolemal@swarthmore.edu

In 2008 he was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize, he has an
Obie Award in playwriting and his newest work is currently playing at Broadway's American Airlines Theater
starring Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds"), Peter Stormare
("Fargo," "The Big Lebowski" and many more) and
Broadway heavy-hitter Michael Cerveris. That said, if you
don't see a lot of theater or religiously read New York
Times critic (and Swarthmore alum) Ben Brantley's
reviews, you probably haven't heard the name
Christopher Shinn.
Thirty-three year-old Shinn is an up-and-coming playwright who has studied with some of the greatest playwrights of our time, including Tony Kushner and Maria

saying "Chris Shinn explores politics and ethics without
moralizing and finds justice and beauty in* intimate life,
keenly observed and rendered scrupulously, unapologetically, fearlessly. [His] plays are important and utterly original. I admire his work enormously."
His latest play, an adaptation ofHenrik Ibsen's "Hedda
Gabler," is the tenth of his plays to reach the public eye.
Don't let the limited supply get you down though
Philadelphia's Amaryllis Theatre Company is performing
one of his most critically acclaimed works, "Dying City,"
through Feb. 22. With a mission of accessibility for all
audiences, Amaryllis' tickets will set you back less than
one-sixth the price of the cheapest seats at "Hedda
Gabler," and having seen both, I can assure you that the
Shinn experience is well represented in this unassuming
production. The production is elegant in its simplicity and
actors Pamela Sabaugh and Nathan Emmons authentically and sympathetically portray the weighty troubles of
-

their characters with apparent ease.
The 10 year-old brain child of Mimi Kenney Smith, who
also helped to found the Theatre Alliance of Greater
Philadelphia, Amaryllis' work surpasses any expectations
you may have when confronted with the unornamented,
unmarkedblack door in the wall thatleads to the theater's
lobby. In fact, Ben Brantley might enjoy this down-to-earth
production more than he seemed to enjoy "Hedda Gabler."
Brantley called the new adaptation of "Hedda Gabler"
'bne of the worst revivals I have ever, ever seen," and
announced that he was "flummoxed" that such a creation
could come from Shinn and the rest of the show's creative
team. Though I absolutely disagree, we do see eye-to-eye
on one thing: as Brantley puts it, "Mr. Shinn is one of the
absolute best of a new generation of American play-

As for Brantley's critique of the show, I find myself
flummoxed. I attended a preview of the show on Jan. 7, and

Michael Cerveris and Mary-Louise Parker in the
Broadway production of "Hedda Gabler."

I was delighted to find that Shinn's changes to the text
were right on the mark. He updates the play effectively but
doesn't slip into the trap of making it too psychological,
which would be untrue to the original Norwegian text.
The character of Hedda would certainly be a fascinating
subject to examine, but such a change would be inappropriate and unwelcome. The play was written before the
modern age of psychoanalysis, a fact that Mr. Shinn refer-

enced in one of his interviews with The NewYork Times:
apparently, "Freud learned Norwegian so he could read
Ibsen."
I do not doubt that Brantley views Ibsen's work with
the same high regard that Freud did, but his negative evaluation of the performances was excessive in my opinion.
Parker's performance is not "dead" as Brantley suggests,
but rather a decidedly new approach to the character.
Her Hedda is a more huffy and transparent woman
than most portrayals Tve encountered, but the vague
annoyance I feel with her character for those traits is a
boon, not an obstacle, for the production. In any production that does Ibsen justice, Hedda is a vicious, vindictive,
lazy, profligate, self-obsessed rhymes-with-witch, but the
updates that Parker makes to Hedda make the character
not only horribly fascinating, but also fun to watch. Her
violent disregard for all things good and happy is
enhanced for the audience by the emphasis on her daddy
something that was already very present in the

that result from her inner petulant child.
Shinn is making great work, and his accomplishments
are not diminished by the less than enthusiastic receipt of
his new adaptation, or by Parker's performance in the title
role. His adaptation of "Hedda Gabler" is well worth seeing, and the production of "Dying City" closer to home
should be taken as an invitation to enter the new generation of theater. Let us hope that when Shinn manages to
bring his play, "Now or Later," to the U.S. stage (it opened
at the Royal Court in London), he receives the warm
reception that he deserves.

Kulu Mele presents a diaspora of dance
BY DAISY SCHMITT

dschmitl@swarthmore.edu

Upper Tarble, typically filled with the
sounds of pop music and sneakered feet
doing steps and kicks in aerobics, was
graced with the rhythm and spirit of the
Kulu Mele African Dance & Drum

Ensemble this past Friday evening. Kulu
Mele, which means "voice of our ancestors," was founded in 1969 and is the oldest
African dance company in Philadelphia.
What was most striking about the performance was the hybrid of more modern
dance styles and traditional dances from
the cultures of Brazil, Haiti, Cuba, Nigeria,
Guinea, Ghana and the Senegambia
region. The first dance, for example, was a
traditional dance to celebrate the birth of a
child. The dance itself was joyous, with
many an arm extended upwards and outwards. But the dancers also sang and cried,
adding to the sense of excitement elicited
by their movements. The dancers were
accompanied by various kinds of drums,
and also the percussion of the human
voice. In the middle of this dance, the audience was introduced to the two male
dancers, creating perhaps the most enter-

taining aspect of the show. Their wide
smiles were infectious, and a somewhat
comatose audience (no doubt in shock

from the exuberance exuded by the danc-

ing and drumming) was soon grinning and
clapping along with the rhythm. The male
dancers' style was almost vaudevillian;
they used pantomime and created a ministory within their performance. They

infused aspects of traditional African
dance, as well as hip-hop and acrobatics,

10

into their performance. "The pop-locking
that the two male dancers did was fun and,
somewhat surprisingly to me, it complimented the traditional dances the women
did nicely," Cecily Bumbray 'l2 said.
Another especially entertaining dance
was a courtship dance, which Artistic
and

Director

Choreographer Dorothy

Wilkie said would traditionally take place
under a full moon. This dance was both
sensuous and playful and utilized the comedy of the male dancers well; it featured
quite a bit offlirtation and lust, and a rivalry between the men (which was settled, of

course, via dance-off). In this dance, the
glittering
costumes were breathtaking
yellow creations that, during the climax of
the dance, created a vibrant scene.
While dancing is an incredibly important aspect of Kulu Mele, the stunning per-

According to Wilkie, "If you can count to
four you can do this dance." It proved true
soon everyone's arms were moving and
feet stepping side to side. Things were only
slightly complicated when the concept of a
"break" was introduced: the drummer
plays a distinctive beat, and a new section
of the dance begins. As Swarthmore's registrar, Martin Warner, put it, "Of the many
laudatory things one could say about Kulu
Mele, I particularly enjoy the way it
weaves traditional music and dance with
modern and even humorful elements, and
then includes the educational elements,
both at one's place and up front at the end.

It was brilliant!"
It was apparent that people were enjoying themselves. "Kulu Mele was almost
intoxicating," Emily Leach 'l2 said. "The
combination of music and dance made the
entire audience brim with a kind of euphoria. Dancing with them was incredible."
At the end of the show, the audience
was invited to dance with the performers
on the stage, which, it must be said, only a
few brave souls did. However, the camaraderie between the dancers and the audience was very clear; there was great
enthusiasm for the group. Even Martin
Warner got up on stage and danced along.

cussion and vocal performances merit
equal attention. The chanting and singing
was full of heart, especially during a tribute in song to the prime minister of Ghana,
in which the drummers sang together and
played cowbell-like instruments.
It was strange and almost alienating to
sit in the audience and watch this whirlwind of activity. Foot tapping and clapping
weren't enough; to be in the audience
such a beautiful and intimate performance
felt wrong, almost invasive. As if in antici-

pation of this sensation, the performance
incorporated audience participation.
The audience learned the importance of
the relationship between the drummerand
the dancer when they were invited to
dance along. Dorothy Wilkie invited everyone to stand up (which everyone did) and

abashed couples! Your affection should be
buried, wrapped up and hidden, like the
body of a comatose individual beneath layers and layers of impenetrable bandages.
So: back to the granny-panties at
Kohlberg. Last week I fell victim to the
most grotesque public display of affection I
have yet to witness at Swarthmore. The
encounter started off innocently enough. I
met two good-natured Swatties sitting
opposite me in the ring of couches. They
were friendly. One of them sympathized
with my pained bark-like coughing, and
the other was heaving and hacking herself.
"What good Samaritans!" I thought to
myself, as I figured I had finally found
some compassion at Swarthmore that wasn't directed towards low-wage workers, or
people of color, but rather my own (far
more apparent and tortured) plight.
But just as I was thinking that these
two "friends" would make for a nice addition to my Swattie circle, the female decided it would be a good idea to mount the
male. "I am now officially uncomfortable,"
I thought. Yet the male insisted on achieving the proper "angle" to rid his beaux of
her coughing affliction. As he slapped her
back and coaxed the cough out of his

beloved, the two nuzzled and cooed and
swayed back and forth to their own magical lullaby. I, on the other hand, recoiled
farther into my curled up ball and hacked
my lungs out into the cushion of the Coffee
Bar couch. Writhing in a combination of
pain and disgust, I glanced up only to catch
a flash of the female's baggy white undergarments hanging in the breeze for all to
see. As a shudder passed through my body,
I pondered over the allure of the grannypanties on a grown woman. Perhaps it's a
hipster thing, I thought, a mere ironic
statement of one's hyper-sexuality by
means of dress in prepubescent fashion.
"Pleeaase," I winced, on the verge of
tears, as my coughing spell continued, "Make it stop! Rid her ofher

through our arguments over everything from abortion policy to environmental regulations and, yes, the

Sure, there are some areas where it's pretty obvious to most parties that the federal government plays
a necessary role. Take foreign policy. When Vladimir
Putin rears his ugly head, I don't care how close he is

to deal with it.
But in most domestic policy issues, there is a legitimate debate. Conservatives on one side worry that
the federal government is too inefficient and too
bureaucratic too insufficiently responsive to and too
isolated from local needs and culture.
Liberals, on the other hand, argue that the federal
government is necessary and that no other entity has
the authority or the resources to get things done.
More often than not, they're both right.
President Obama captured the key issue in his
inaugural address when he said, "The question we
ask today is not whether our government is too big or
too small, but whether it works." Figuring out what
works, however, is no easy feat.
There are few policy areas where the debate over
federal versus local control is as difficult to navigate

In crisis, Nutter cuts creatively to balance budget

When Philadelphia elected Michael Nutter to the
post of mayor in November of 2007, the city's two
most pressing issues were crime and corruption. The
most vocal disagreement between the candidates
during the election, however, was whether or not the
city should charge rent on a government building in
use by the Boy Scouts of America. The election had
one of the lowest voter turnouts in the city's history,
and Nutter, a Democrat, easily won the primary and
general elections.
The next election, no doubt, will be better contested. The economic crisis has hit Philadelphia hard,
forcing once prominent issues like crime and corruption into the background. Moreover, the present
financial turmoil has made a seemingly invincible
mayor struggle to maintain the city's support.
The strains on Mayor Nutter's government are
According

"Philadelphia Tax Revenue Update," Philadelphia's
wage tax, transfer tax and sales tax revenues are all
lower than was projected, and business privilege
taxes (BPT) and real estate taxes together will garner
the city $6O million less than was expected. These
and other shortcomings have forced major budget
cuts to help allay the loss of revenue. Even so,
experts predict a budget shortfall of over $l7O million

for the 2010 fiscal year.
But Nutter is bound by law to keep the city's budget balanced. In an interview with NBC in early
November, Nutter declared that at least $lOO million
had to be cut from city spending. His plan called for
the closing of the vast majority of the city's public
pools and eleven public libraries, an end to snow
removal (barring snowfalls of greater than 12 inches)
and a freeze on the city's planned tax reductions.
And the economic climate has only worsened
since November, however, and the city maintains
plans to further reduce the budget. Talk of closing 11
public libraries in November has evolved into talk of
closing 23; talk of decreasing department budgets by
10 percent has evolved into talk of decreasing them
by 30 percent. None of this has been easy for Mayor

Nutter, who was recently told by a judge that he
couldn't close certain municipal buildings (such as
the libraries) without first getting city council support.
This ruling, as well as recent dissent within the
city council, has forced Nutter to take a step back
and reevaluate his initial, somewhat high-handed,
approach to balancing the budget. He has convened a
number of public discussions in Philadelphia and
plans on assembling several more in which "normal"
Philadelphians are given figures about the budget
shortfall and information about the proposed spending cuts and possible tax increases. They are asked
to split into groups to draw up their own plans where
they discuss how many police officers ought to be
cut, how many libraries and swimming pools and
skating rinks ought to be closed, and how much, if at
all, taxes need to be increased.
These public workshops are the perfect forum for
discussing budget issues with Philadelphians. While
it is unlikely that many poorer Philadelphians, who
rely on city services more, will be attending these
discussions, these public workshops are an astute
political move on the part of Nutter.
A recent Pew Poll taken in Philadelphia found
that Nutter's approval rating remained above 70 percent, but that less than 30 percent of the city
approved of his plans to cut city services. Nutter
thus remains a popular man, but it is imperative
that he does a better job of convincing the people
that his budget cuts are necessary.
It is natural that Philadelphians are opposed to
seeing many of their city's services withdrawn. And
certainly we should question the prudence of the law
mandating that Philadelphia's budget remain balanced. Nutter himself, however, has done an excellent job of discovering ways to maintain city services without relying on increased public expenditure.
On Feb. 5, the mayor announced the creation of
the Splash and Summer Fund, an initiative designed
to rescue the city's public pools. According to
Nutter's original plan, 63 of the city's 73 public pools
were scheduled to remain closed this summer. The

Splash and Summer Fund, Nutter hopes, will raise

$1.2 million from local businesses, individuals, and
charities in an effort to keep 30 of the 73 pools open
six days a week.
This initiative is one in a long line of public-private initiatives that have been proposed by the
Mayor. In November, Nutter asked Ed Snider, the
chairman of Comcast-Spectator, a self described
"Sports and Entertainment Firm," to take over the
three ice rinks that the city can no longer afford to
operate. And five of the eleven libraries that Nutter
originally proposed shutting down, will, with the
city council's approval, be kept open by individuals,
charities, and corporations.
Other services, however, will not. Philadelphians
realize that the scale of the economic crises means
that tax cuts will have to be delayed, that taxes will
have to be raised, and that services will have to be
cut. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, for
example, the recent shooting of a Philadelphia police
officer raised "questions about how the administration can consider layoffs to reduce the police budget." And there have been frequent complaints that a
city famou for its libraries is having to close so

many.
It is important, however, that Philadelphians realize how extensive the scale of the cuts will be, and
how judiciously Nutter has chosen which sections of
the budget to cut. For example, the mayor has done
an admirable job of protecting the city's education
budget from being downsized too severely.
It is a testament to the city of Philadelphia that
the same Pew Poll that had 81 percent of
Philadelphians describing the city's current financial situation as "not very good" or "bad", had a plurality saying the city is headed in the right direction,
and a majority saying that Philadelphia is a "good"
or "excellent" place to live.
The spending cuts are painful, but we are confident that as long as the city continues looking for
creative solutions to the crises, Philadelphia will
remain a "good" or "excellent" place to live for a long
while yet.

my curiosity about how

announcement this past
December that the Arena

financial purposes. Now I
don't have a whole lot of
experience with arena
football, but every time I
encountered it on primetime TV, it looked as
though the stadium was
packed and fans were loving every moment of the
game. A friend of mine
who had the luxury of
attending an arena football game once told me
that it was the most fun
game that he had ever
had the pleasure of
attending. Though the
Arena Football League
does have plans to
resume football operations by next season, it's
striking to see how quickly a sport that seemed to

be swept under by the
country's financial standing.

going to take advantage
of this opportunity, and
when we entered the
Wachovia Center midway through the first
quarter, a few things
struck me. The stadium
itself, though not devoid
of life, was certainly far
shorter on attendance
than sporting events I
had attended in recent
years. I was especially
surprised that a team
that had shelled out big
bucks for a star player in

profitable situation for
any sports franchise.
Also, the parquet floor
looked worn and tired

situation), which was not

While
these
matters, I came to the
the
conclusion
that
empty seats could probably be attributed to the
fact that sporting event
tickets are probably just
the kind of luxury good
that goes to the chopping
block when money gets
tight. The disrepair of the
floor I chalked up to the
fact that even though the
playing surface is typically an important part of
any sports team, perhaps
money in the 76ers fran-

chise is just too tight to
spend on things that
aren't absolutely essential to the success of the
team.

What makes this issue

most perplexing is the
way that athletes are still

pulling huge contracts
despite this current situation (read: Yankees offseason). Surely with big
name players still making incredible amounts of
money, some of the less-

er-known or paid athletes
are forced to pay the
piper by losing their jobs.

You certainly have to feel
for these guys who work
their entire lives to make
a dream come true and
don't have the life tools to
otherwise provide for a
family because of the
time spent trying to
become a star. I sincerely
hope that the country can
bounce back from this

The increased publicizing of top
prospects' path to the majors is an
interesting trend to consider. The aver
age MLB payroll in 2008 was about 50
percent larger than in 2000. With the
exception of this offseason, which has
unfolded amidst economic calamity, the
free agent market has jumped up and
up each offseason, with megadeals in
2004 looking modest by 2006. As the
price of free agents has risen, teams

was July, and MLB's trade deadline was
fast approaching. This is the time of
year where contending teams trade
young prospects to lesser teams for
players who can help them in the current season. The idea is that if you are
currently competing for a pennant, you
will be willing to forfeit production in
future seasons for some help in this
one. However, in 2004, the Mets clearly
went overboard. They traded Scott

Men's basketball stuns Gettysburg on Alumni Day
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore men's basketball snapped

an 18-game losing streak

on

Alumni Day

with a 57-53 upset victory over Gettysburg.
The win was the Garnet's first in the
Centennial Conference and moved them to a
record of 2-20 overall (1-15 CC). The Bullets,
who came in at third place in the conference, left Tarble Pavilion with a 14-8 record
(9-7 CC) and fell to fourth in the standings.
In a game with post-season implications
for Gettysburg, Swarthmore never intended
to roll over for the visitors. "We wanted the
game more than they did," swingman Ryan
Carmichael 'll said. "I feel like we willed
the victory." After falling behind by nine
with eight minutes left in the game, the
Garnet certainly did something special to
pull it out.
The back and forth nature of the game
there were ten lead changes
resembled
the mercurial play of Gettysburg over this
season. Halfway through their schedule, the
Bullets won eight straight games to merit a
#22 national ranking. Since then, however,
the team has been in free fall, dropping five
of their last seven games and slipping from
the top spot in the conference standings.
For the first 15 minutes of the contest,

drastically
outplayed
Gettysburg. Over that span, the Garnet built
an 11-point lead by staying patient on the
offensive end of the court and disruptive on
the defensive end. Swarthmore Head Coach
Lee Wimberly knew his team had to slow
the game down to have a chance at winning.
"The only legitimate shot we have at winning is to be patient," he said. "We don't
have the firepower to score 70 points. The
lower the score, the better chance we have
to win."
Co-captain Matt Allen 10 explained how
the Garnet controlled the pace. "We were
passing up good shots early in the shot clock
for great shots later," he said. "We ran the
shot clock down because no defense wants
to play you for 35 seconds every time." This
strategy produced a 28-17 advantage with
five minutes left in the half.

Swarthmore

The Gettysburg offense finally kicked
into gear at that point. Bullets senior guard
Dan Capkin, who had left the game earlier
with a sore knee, re-entered the action and
sank a three-pointer in the middle of a 12-0
run that gave the visitors a 29-28 lead at the
break. Gettysburg continued its improved
play into the second half. Capkin, who
scored a team-high 18 points, and senior
Corey Dorsey, who reached 1,000 career
points on Saturday, hit back-to-back threes
to give the Bullets a nine-point lead with
eight minutes left.
At this point, the game looked like many
others this season where the Garnet stayed
in it for most of the contest but could never
close it out. "When they went up nine it was
really similar to a lot of games in the past,"
Allen said. "I could kind of sense it slipping
away. The difference was people just
stepped up and made shots when they had

to."
Allen himself stepped up and halted the

slippage with a three-pointer. He finished
the game 4-7 behind the arc and led the
Garnet with 18 points and four assists. The
three-pointers vaulted him into eighth place
all-time at Swarthmore with 100 career
triples. Moments later Carmichael added a
three of his own to cut the deficit to three
points. Two free throws from co-captain

Raul Ordonez 'O9 and another Carmichael
three put the Garnet up two with three minutes left.
With 1:20 left in the game, Garnet forward Sam Lacy 'll made a play His coach
deemed "critically important." As the shot
clock expired, Lacy launched a three and
drew a foul on the attempt. He made all
three shots at the line to give Swarthmore a
five-point lead. Capkin cut the lead to two
with a triple, and Dorsey's three-point
attempt with three seconds remaining
would have given Gettysburg the lead, but
Carmichael said "[it] had no chance because
Danny [Walker 10] was covering him like a
blanket." Carmichael grabbed the rebound
and made two foul shots to put the game
away at 57-53.
It worked perfectly against the Bullets'

Andrew Powers, who is second in the conference with 18.3 points per game. Powers
committed two charges against Ordonez
early in the game, however, and foul trouble
forced him to the bench for most of the first
half. He was never able to develop a rhythm
and finished the game with just six points.
Ordonez's three charges on the night gave
him a team-leading 20 on the season, two
behind the Swarthmore's single-season
record of 22.
Another big factor for the Garnet was
the presence of the alumni. "It's really special when you see all the great players of
Swarthmore's past playing, and then they

come out to support us even though our
record is not great," Carmichael said. "I
felt the most pride I've ever felt for
Swarthmore basketball on Saturday." The
victory's satisfaction was augmented
because the Class of 'OB never beat
Gettysburg during its four years at
Swarthmore.

Saturday to watch the Garnet attempt to
build confidence and momentum for next
season and spoil the playoff hopes of the

game is on Saturday, Feb 21 at 3 p.m. at

Givans paces track team at Boston's Valentine Invite

While other Swatties were
busy exchanging chocolates and

roses this weekend, representatives from the Swarthmore men's
and women's indoor track and
field teams journeyed to New
England to compete in the

Valentine Invitational hosted by
Boston University. Teams came
from colleges all over the northeast, Division I and Division 111
alike, to compete in this annual
event.
Despite this bad-timing, the

Swarthmore teams managed to

a first-year with more races to

crack at the record. "I would love

to break that record and run

ued.

17:48.98.
Among the Swarthmore men,
Dan Hodson 'O9 ran a personalbest time in the 3000-meter run,
clocking in at 8:58.25. Erik Saka

time of 8:5517 in the 3000-meter

Additionally, Connor Darby 'O9

teams look ahead to the
Centennial

Championships. The Conference
Championship, hosted this year
by Ursinus College, is a two-day
event that will take place on
Friday, Feb. 27 and Saturday, Feb.
28. Some of the top runners from
other Centennial Conference
teams will compete for the
Conference
Championships.
Carroll said that there is a particular strategy to the Conference

and the men's team's five seniors. "They were very welcoming

commented Givans.
Coach Carroll echoed these
sentiments, saying "lately, many
have performed personal bests,
