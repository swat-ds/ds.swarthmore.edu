CEP Reveals Potential
Future Academic Plan

Appointment
Procedure

Questioned

By
&

It's almost a Swarthmore tradition that
each year brings new controversy. This year
the controversy involves the practices of Student Council's appointments onto some of
the most important committees.
Student Council recently appointed Douglas Berger '9B to the College Planning Committee (CPC). After his appointment, concerns were raised concerning the process by
which he applied. Berger's application was
late, in fact Appointments Committee member GiridharSrinivasan '9B reminded Berger
to apply after the applications deadline due
on September 12 and after the bulk of the
interviews had been held on September 15.
Furthermore, Committee Chair Andrew Lund
'99 concedes that he never read Berger's
application, and that his appointment was
based mostly on his interview.
A memo released by Lund in response to
the allegation stated: "Thefact is that Giridhar
did approach Doug, but only in response to
previously stated interest in CPC on Doug's
part. Giridhar was not present during Doug's
interview, and as such made no statements
for or against his candidacy."
In the Student Council charter, the Appointments Committee is allowed to hold a
second round of applications. However, suspicions were raised because the apparent second round was not publicized. Lund explained that the second day of interviews was
an extension of the first round for people who
had not been able to appear on the first scheduled interview day. Berger was appointed to
the CPC, to the dismay of other applicants—not because Berger was unqualified, but because the system seemed to have beenabused.
Miho Tsujii '9B, an applicant to the CPC,
was concerned with the interview process. "I
felt like I was being tested, that they were
looking to see ifthey would like my opinions,
if I was interested in the same issues," she
said. "Student Council needs diverse perspectives, and new ideas on how to change
the college."
Tsujii also expressed concern about the
seeming lack of diversity in this year's appointments. Out of the six available positions, five were filled by men.
Lund counters, "We were looking for the
best applicants. Because we didn't have the
numberof applications we wanted, we didn't
have the options to ensure diversity." According to him, all three of the applicants to
the CEP (Council on Education Policy) and
four of the five applicants to the CBC (College Budget Committee) were male.
In his memo, Lund stated: "Of the nineteen
positions requiring interviews that have been
appointed to this date, eleven of the nineteen
have been women and eight of the nineteen
have been students of color. While we understand that on the surface some of the numbers
and some of the process has been questionable, under closer inspection, in light of the
facts, we feel confident in saying that appointments committee is proud of our work
and extremely pleased withthe appointments
that have been made."
Either way, Berger himself feels that the
guidelines governing the appointments onto
the most important committees need to be
refined. "After going through the appointments process, I would welcome further
guidelines about this process," Berger said.

Lund disagrees, citing Student Council's
difficulties in the past getting enough applications for the committees. "We want to get
people to come out as much as possible. This
might not be the most ideal application process, but the more applications we have the
more credible we are."

Policy (CEP) conducted a series of workshops and panels on the long-term educational goals of the College, specifically to
determine which areas of the curriculum
should be addressed. As a result of those
discussions, the CEP has now released a
lengthy draft of a report detailing the direction in which academic life at Swarthmore
might go in the coming years.
The first draft of the report, which appears
in its entirety in this week's special Phoenix
supplement, is a joint effort between students, faculty, and administration. The idea
behind the report is that planning should be
done before the College is actually in need of
substantial changes. Associate Provost Barry
Schwartz, one of the overseers of the project,
said, "It often happens that institutions engage in developing a long-range plan when

While Bob Dole was practicing his oneliners at a mock debate at his Washington
campaign headquarters on Tuesday, vicepresidential candidate Jack Kemp was wooing a crowd of 200 women at a Jewish
community center in Tucson, Arizona.
Promoting the Republican plan to reduce
Americans' taxes by 15 percent across the
board, Kemp predicted that the number of
woman-owned businesses would double
under a Dole/Kemp administration. In ad-

dition, he said, such tax breaks would generate enough family income so that mothers, if they wished, could leave the work
force.
This election season, Republican appeals
to women are nothing new. From Con-

things are in a state ofcrisis for one reason or
another. This almost always leads to bad decisions. Swarthmore is wisely thinking about
the future at a time when nothing is broken. If
we make changes, it will not be out ofdesperation."
At this point, CEP and Student Council are
looking for feedback on the draft, asking
whether these truly are the areas which should
be addressed. The report does not "recommend that the size of the College be increased
or that distribution requirements be changed.
What it does do is recommend that these and
other issues be given serious consideration,"
Schwartz said.
While Schwartz noted that "almost all of
our recommendations for future planning were
significantly affected by the student perspective," Seth Harvey '97, a CEP student representative and Student Council member who
was involved with the process last spring, has

Construction on Mertz Lawn is part of the College's efforts to conform to the
Americans with Disabilities Act.

Construction Making
Campus More Accessible
By

Kate

Doty

Swarthmore is currently in the process of
renovating dorms and buildings in an effort
to comply withthe Americans With Disabilities Act. The College is also restructuring the
drainage systems to ameliorate flooding of
the southern parts of campus.
Since September 26, Mertz lawn has been
the sit of the first of three planned "site
access" projects according to Mark Evans,
director ofplanning construction. The aim is
to make Mertz accessible to individuals with
physical disabilities.Construction crews have
been working to improve the grade of the
slope. This requires some soil reconfiguration
and the rebuilding of the paved paths.
Conscious of the possible disruption construction can cause, Evans said there will be
no construction work done on Mertz lawn the
week before October break. Students will be
able to study for and take exams in peace and
quiet. The bulk of the work will take place
over October break. This is when the most
"intense" and "noisy" phases ofconstruction
will occur, according to Evans.
However, according to Meredith Weems
'OO, who lives in Mertz, "It is the most
miserable thing ever. At 8:00 every morning
you can hear a lot of banging outside of our
window and the loud beeping of the truck
reversing." In addition to being able to hear
the construction workers' conversations starting at 8 a.m., "thereis no way we can possibly
study in our rooms because the noise and the
hammering is so awful."
Contingent on good weather conditions,
construction outside of Mertz is scheduled to
end on October 25. The current construction
work on campus is "an ongoing effort to
improve accessibility of our most public facilities," said Evans.
Construction crews are working to reno-

vate several buildings and areas, from the
exterior inwards. Beginning with exterior
paths and moving on through entrances, classrooms, and eventually dorms, the college
hopes to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act, which was passed by
Congress in 1990.
Additional work has been done on the
exterior of Sharpies Dining Hall, Lang Music
Building, the loading dock, Cornell Science
Library, and Martin. Clothier Building will
have access doors installed. In Lang, a lift
will be installed in order to make the elevators accessible to the disabled. The entrance
ofHicks will also be modified to improve the
accessibility of the elevators.
Construction generally starts at 7:30 a.m.
and finishes at 3 p.m. However, in areas
deemed "sensitive," said Evans, construction
hours are 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m..
The Facilities Management Department is
also attempting to remedy the drainage problems which have plagued the South Campus.
Construction began on September 16.
In an all-campus e-mail, Evans described
the two phases of the project, the first of
which is taking place now. Sharpies Dining
Hall and the Pedestrian Tunnel are the two
currently affected areas. "We expect this
project will prevent the frequent flooding of
the Pedestrian Tunnel and Sharpies Dining
Hall," wrote Evans.
The construction is progressing from the
"area nearest the railroad tracks and [will]
workits way up the hill over the period offive
weeks," stated Evans in the e-mail. An effort
is being made to restrict "the active construction areas [to] about 200 feet at a time."
The work by Parrish Lawn should be finished by the end of October. The second
phase, which involves Magill Walk and
Parrish Hall, will not become active until this
summer.

gresswoman Susan Molinari's keynote
speech at the Republican Convention to
Dole's assurances of Republican toleration
of a range of opinions on abortion, the
candidates have been touting the party's
inclusiveness all year.
Absent any substantive appeals to them,
women in 1992 favored Clinton over Bush
by 11 percent, and in the 1994 "Republican
Revolution" elections, actually favored
Democratic candidates by 15 percent. But
this year, Republicans have recognized the
power of the female electorate, and the
"gender gap" has become a householdword.
While Dole and Clinton are almost even
among male voters according to some polls,
they are separated by a 15 percent margin
among female voters, according to a Wall
Street Journal poll from mid-September.

The stakes are high this year, so pundits
and political consultants are doing their
best to explain the gender discrepancy.
They have suggested explanations from
the thoughtfully complex to the inane: that
women prefer Clinton's views on abortion
and social issues; that women don'thave a
sense of Dole as a family man like they
have of Clinton; and that women don't
identify with Kemp as a sports hero like
men do. But the most unfounded explanation for the gap is that women favor Clinton
because they are not concerned with economic issues.

Rachel Henighan wins bid
for CC, despite low voter

turnout, computer problems
By

Josh Kramer

Rachel Henighan '97 won the Student
Council election for a position on the Curriculum Committee in a marginal victory,
receiving 220 (52%) votes in comparison to
Lars Jan 'OO, who received only 173 (41%).
In addition, there were 31 (7%) abstentions.
When asked to comment, Jan said that "The
voting system needs to be overhauled.. .there
is something egregiously wrong when only
thirty percent of the students vote," while
Henighan said that she "would consider paper balloting to see if more people would
vote."
Henighan attributed her victory to a belief
the Swarthmore students are "concerned about
having more women on Student Council,"
though she made it clear that with the erratic
Swarthmore voting trends, it is uncertain

why students voted the way they did.
There were, however, a number of irregularities in this contest. First, the voting system went off at midnight on Tuesday, rather
than midnight of Wednesday, due to a miscommunication between Student Council and
John Speno, UNIX System Manager. In response, the election was extended until 9:00
a.m. Thursday morning. Secondly, on
Wednesday afternoon, a number of paper
ballots were distributed at Sharpies. The ballots, numbering exactly 100, were split 44 for
Jan and 54 for Henighan, consistent with
overall results. The paper ballots were then
hand counted in front of an observer and
cross-checked against the computer voting
by Frank Yue, Network Analyst. No instances
of double voting were noted by Yue.
Alyssa Rayman-Read '99, Student Council Outreach Co-Chair, said "The voting system could be improved if people were sitting
and taking paper ballots more of the time."
She went on to say that she personally saw no
problem with the paperballots —the taking of
ID's at the balloting sites stopped potential
vote fraud in her opinion.

New 14-Meal Option
Receives Mixed Reviews
By Christopher DiLeo

This summer, returning students were invited to sign up for a new meal plan of 14
meals a week plus a $lOO declining credit
balance to be used at either Tarble, Sharpies,
or the Kohlberg coffee bar, instead of the
standard 20 meal a week plan previously
required of all living on campus. 98 students
chose this new option.
Before this year, Swarthmore offered only
one meal plan, which allowed for 20 meals a
week. As a first-year, Joe Goodman '97 felt
he was getting shortchanged by the old meal
plan. Once elected to Student Council,
Goodman worked to change the meal plan. "I
first found out what other schools were doing. The council and I then had some ideas
and we brought them to Larry Schall and
Linda McDougall." The result of these discussions was the new 14-meal plan.
The new plan aliows a student to eat any 14
meals over the course of a week. They may
also spend their $lOO balance if they exceed
the amount of meal credit at Tarble. This
credit can also be used at the Kohlberg coffee
bar. Credit for any meals left by the end of the
week are lost, as are any dollars remaining in
the balance at the end of the semester.

Students who have chosen the option have
had mixed reactions. Casey Smith '99, who
chose the 14-meal plan this year, said, "It
does kind of stink that I am not getting as
much as someone on the 20-meal plan." However, Smith pointed out two of the benefits of
the 14-meal plan: "I can go to Kohlberg and
I can use my credit any time!"
John Rieffel '99, however, saw the option
as a rip-off. "I did the math and I decided it
was better to stick with the 20-meal plan."
The math shows that the new plan leaves
students with less for their money than the
20-meal plan. Swarthmore charges $3,344
for board per year. With the new plan, students are allotted 448 meals and can use their
credit to get about 40 extra meals over the
year. Under the 20-meal plan, students can
eat 640 meals in a year, while those under the
14-meal plan they only get 488.
Goodman pointed out the cause of this
disparity: "Basically, Sharpies has a lot of
fixed costs, mainly staffing and building
maintenance. In order to insure they covered
these costs, we had to design a plan that
would not remove funds from Sharpies."
When the issue was brought up at the plan

Students Lack Interest in Committees

News Briefs

CBC Loosens Confidentiality Standards

Last year, the Student Council petitioned the administration for more
student involvement on various college committees, and their efforts
were successful. However, it is with
great reluctance that thefruits ofthose
labors are tasted, as only a small
number ofSwarthmore studentswish
to get involved this year.
Many organizations have vacant
spots for students this year: the Student Budget Committee allocates the
money from the Student Activities
Fund among the various groups on
campus; the Intercollegiate Exchange
is involved in the process of sending
Swarthmore students abroad to other
colleges, and bringing students here
from other colleges. Positions in Computing Services, helping to oversee

According to Sean Barney '9B, StudentCouncil's representative to
the College Budget Committee, the CBC will soon be loosening its
confidentiality standards, partially due to last year's student protests
over decreases in financial aid. Barney said that there will be open
discussions during two periods—tentatively scheduled for October
31 to November 7, regarding revenue sources and financial aid
expenditures, and from January 17 to February 6, regarding the entire
tentative budget at that point.
Barney is still unsure whether or not exact information will be
released to the public, or if only general answers will be allowed
under the new rules. Barney said it was decided by the committee that
he "[could] go into details with your constituents [during the public
periods]," though he was unsure if he would be allowed to release the
budget to the student body or give out any numerical figures from the
tentative budget.

Raptor Fails and Condor Crashes
then, the Swarthmore College Computing Society (SCCS) has been
working to replace Raptor with a new machine. "[When we] attempted to determine exactly what the problem was," explained
SCCS President Ross Dickson '97, "it was determined that Raptor
was dead and we started planning." The following Sunday evening,
the 29th, SCCS representatives met with Budget Committee and

In the meantime, Web pages have been stored on Condor. Raptor's
original crash also caused Condor to crash, though service was
restored after about eight hours. Condor has crashed twice since
then—once on Sunday morning and once on Sunday evening
because of problems accessing files that were formerly on Raptor.

CEP Issue Report
expressed concern that the report does
not sufficiently reflect all issues pro-

posed by students.
Harvey notes that this draft of the
report represents an improvement
over the first. He applauds the focus
on interculturalism in the curriculum, taking student interest into account when deciding how to expand
the curriculum, reevaluating distribution requirements, and developing
community-based learning.
Provost Jennie Keith echoed
Harvey's enthusiasm about community-based learning, saying "we really need to lmow there are faculty
interested in doing this." The approval
for such courses, once developed, "is
something that could happen quite
quickly," Keith said.
Yet Harvey noted that "the faculty
were generous enough to sanction a
study of their own workload and the
pressures imposed upon their time,"
but placed "a section swiping at student workload" in a portion of the
report devoted to the teacher-scholar.
Harvey believed that "at the very
least, this is an awkward position
which results from the late addition
of this paragraph and lack of a clearly
defined agenda in relation to stress
and student work load."
Harvey also felt that the section
dealing with the size of the College
dealt with concerns about size of the
faculty without considering the effect ofincreased size on other aspects
of the academic program. He said,
"Increasing the size of the College
also invariably affects the way in
which programs are administered to
meet students' needs. Departments
need to increase not just in numbers
of faculty but also in the breadth of

offerings to accommodate more diverse intellectual needs that result
from more students."
Schwartz believed that students'
views were taken into account. "Concern about evaluating and perhaps
reshaping distribution requirements
was in part in response to student
concern that the College make clear
what it is that we think students are
learning. Our concern about improving mechanisms that permit curricular flexibility and innovation was in
direct response to student concern
about these issues. Our worry about
faculty work load was in part areflection of our desire to increase student
opportunities to work closely with
faculty. Our discussion of community-based learning was in part a response to student enthusiasm for that
aspect of our curriculum. Our discussion of possible procedures for review of faculty was prompted by
student concern that current mechanisms for feedback to faculty about
their courses are inadequate."
Schwartz feels the discrepancy over
student involvement arises from the
fact that "students who read the report may not always recognize issues
they raised as addressed directly, because in the course of our discussion,
some of them were transformed a bit,
but they are all in here."
As everything in the report is still
only a recommendation, more serious work lies ahead. The faculty will
begin discussing the report at their
faculty meeting this Friday in order
to determine which issues should
become topics for serious planning.
Student Council and the student
CEP representatives have organized
a meeting to this end which will take
place on Thursday, October 10 at
4:30 p.m. in Parrish Parlors.

The Board of Managers had extra
hurdles to overcome this year with
the increased size of the first-year
class. Every year, the Board meets to
discuss the allocation of College finances. This yearit faced quite a few
complications. The financial aid expenditure increased by $419,000 due
to the larger than expected need of
the class of 2000. In addition to this,
increased demand for foreign study
programs initiated a $68,000 hike
above the original allocated amount.
Despite these challenges, the Board
was able to come up with all additional needed funds. Higher interest
rates yielded an additional $lOO,OOO
to the expected income from the
College's endowment. At the same
time, the stable medical coverage
program employed by the College
paid off and there was a drop in fringe
costs by $50,000. According to President Al Bloom, the College has

and Equal Opportunity Advisory
Committees also have openings.
However, a lack of desire to participate became increasingly evident
as the Wednesday, October 2 deadline of 12:00 a.m. came and went.
Some of this lack of interest can be
attributed to the time requirements
and thecommitment they take, which
tends to scare off possible applicants.
Another reason is the importance stu-

dents attach to each of the respective
committees. "The reason I think that

have so much work to do [for classes]
that they are very cautious in com-

mitting to another...activity," said
Lund. One freshman agreed. "When
I first came here, I wanted to get
involved in so many things," she said.
"And a lot of these committees
sounded like the perfect thing for me.
But once my classes started to pick
up, the idea went right out the win-

never had a problem with their service."
However, some students reported
problems with receipt of e-mail invoices and remittance pages. This
has made it more difficult for affected students to keep track of their
outstanding account balances. STC
Services, which provides billing and
telecommunications help desk services for the College, is supposed to
notify students when their balances
reach 75 percent of the credit limit.
Credit limits have also been simplified with the introduction of a single
$ 100 limit. Students who have a Parents Plus Account, however, should
be aware that this $lOO limit applies
to the balance ofboth accounts. Thus,
for some students with a Parents Plus
Account, the $ 100 limit may in effect
be a 44 percent reduction in credit
limit. Students may establish a higher
balance limit by securing a deposit
with STC Services.
Similar to last year, students may
check their account balances by dialing extension 2035; however, students have noted that the balances
reported at this automated number
are often far from their true balances.
Many students remember the billing
crisis that plagued STC Services last
year and some even refuse to use the
College long distance service at all.
Says Jason Linder '97, "I use Sprint

$500,000 in a contingency fund,
which is built into the budget each
year, so there was "sufficient
money...to cover this extra cost."
52 percent of the current first-year
class is receiving some form offinancial aid, as opposed to 47 percent of
the class of 1999. The average College scholarship for first-years now
is $ 17,061 and the average totalpackage, inclusive of loans and workstudy, is $21,457. This is an increase
from last year, when the average
Swarthmore scholarship for firstyears was $14,505 and the average
total package was $19,359. These
figures clearly show that despite the
increase in the population of the student body the College is continuing
to financially support students who
demonstratedfinancial need. According to the student observer, Josh Alloy '9B, the board seems to be committed to meeting the financial needs
of students and does not want the
question of financial aid to interfere
,

It's cheaper, more convenient, and
they fulfill all of their service obligations."
The College has also increased the
amount of time in which students
may pay their telephone bills. Last
year, payments were due within 14
days of the invoice date, but this year
students have 21 days to pay their
bills. In an effort to increase communication, a representative from STC
will be on campus in Parrish Parlors
once every billing period to help resolve any outstanding billing and
customer service concerns. STC will
be available for questions and discussion in Parrish Parlors this Friday
form 10:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Although it appears STC may be attempting to be more communicative
with students, repeated calls to STC
for comments on billing problems
were not returned in time for inclu-

sion in this article.
On another issue of concern last
semester, Dumic notes that the Col-

lege is now in full compliance with
the Equal Access Regulation imposed
by the FCC. The College now provides access to other long distance
carriers through the use of 10-XXX-0 dialing with the use of a calling
card. Still, said Jason Albright '99,
"S warthmore College is contributing
to a communications monopoly, such
as it is. I think it is highly unethical
and un-American."

with any future expansion plans.
The additional revenue from the
increase in the first-year class size
was also used to fund lounges and
dorm room conversions. At the same
time, the board reserved funds for
when the student enrollment level
falls bellow the expected level.
The Board also discussed future
plans and the role of alumni. Currently, 52 percent of alumni contribute to the College; theBoard hopes to
raise this percentage to 60 percent.
Furthermore, the Board hopes for
increased alumni involvement in
helping graduates find jobs.
A video was shown at the meeting
in which President Al Bloom was
interviewed on future expansion
plans. The President spoke about the
"special qualities of a small liberal
arts education." When asked, Alloy
said that the President's ideas "jive
very well with whatthe students feel.
We would prefer to keep Swarthmore small and a close community."

Election '96: Gender Gap

a hand in the issue. Students have
been disgruntled in the past because
of their lack ofrepresentation in these
groups, and many do not believe that
much of a difference can be made.
"There is often a perception that
many committees are not important,"
said Lund, "in that they don't have
any say inchanging things. This 'say',
or lack thereof, is attributable to the
fact that we've had so few students
on these committees in the past."
Now that the allocated student positions on these committees have increased, it is hoped that participation,
as well as their perceived importance,
will increase. But whether or not it
occurs, one thing is evident to Lund:
"We now have a greater student voice
able to be heard."

Lythcott
Hear
Students
By

Jessica Harbour

On Thursday, members of the
student body at large and Student Council met with PresidentAl Bloom and Dean Ngina
Lythcott in Parrish Parlors for a

question-and-answer session.
The ensuing hour and a half
featured discussion offinancial
aid, the College's size, future
construction and renovation
projects, and changes to the recycling program.
Bloom noted that because of
the need to provide financial
aid, "the likelihood is that...
bringing in more students will
be a financial disadvantage." He
and Lythcott also addressed the
current bulge in student body
population, attributing it to three
factors: the high numberoffirstyear students who accepted the
College's offer of admission,
the low number ofadmitted students who decided not to attend
Swarthmore over the summer,
and the fact that 25 percent fewer
students than usual chose foreign study this semester. "I'm
very conflicted...as to the size
of the College," said Bloom,
"[but] the next plan is to go back

1325 students."
Students came to the meeting
wishing to discuss specific is-

to

sues. Dan Wells '95, on a return
visit, was worried about the current pressure on the Biology
Department: "Even though they
have two more professors than
engineering, they have four
times the number of students."
Bloom responded by explaining that the "in" department
changes from time to time—sometimes biology, sometimes
English or psychology or economics—so no major measures
have been taken to add to the

Biology Department, though at
least one part-time position has
been converted to a full-time

In response to results obtained from
last semester's telecommunications
survey, the College has implemented
several changes to the telephone calling rates and billing policies.
The survey indicated that students
wanted lower long distance rates and
toll-free calling to the Bryn Mawr
and Haverford area, and the College
responded.
According to Mark Dumic, manager of networking and systems, the
time period for the least-expensive
long distance rate has been extended
to begin at 9 p.m. instead of 11 p.m.
and the rate has been dropped from
$0.14 to $0.12 per minute. In addition, calls to Bryn Mawr and Haverford are now free. Local calling within
the 610 and 215 area codes has also
been simplified withthe introduction
of a standard rate that varies only
withtime of day rather than both time
of day and distance called.
Long-distance invoices are now
sent via e-mail, with a paper remittance page that follows through campus mail. Said D6sir6e Joseph '99,

In response, Bloom pointed
out that Kohlberg had been paid
for by donors' money rather than
out of the College's budget, but
he and Lythcott also acknowledged the need for renovations
in Mary Lyon and Worth especially. At the very end of the
meeting, Carl Mas '9B brought
up the issue of the new recycling program and a possible
composting program.

New Meal Plan: Mixed Response
{Continued from page 1}
-ning meetings, Goodman recalls, it was jokingly stated that without a steady source of
income, Sharpies would have to "serve peanut
butter and jelly the last few weeks of school."
Linda McDougal, director of Dining Services, said, "The plan was designed for people
who don't eat breakfast. It was designed to be
an option, hot a bargain. I have only heard
positive feedback, though, and I think the
program will continue."
Goodman also feels there will be more

changes in the future: "Once this [current
meal plan debate] blows over, someone will
realize they don't like the meal plans and
devise a newer one. I feel that, given the
circumstances, we have developed the best
program."
Sunny Lee '99 also has mixed feelings
about the new meal plan, in which she is
enrolled. "I' m not sure it really makes a difference," she said. "I thought it'd be more convenient because I'm not near the eating areas,"

said Lee, who lives in Woolman.
Kim Nelson '9B, also on the new plan, has

no passionate feelings about it. She signed up
for the new plan because "I find it annoying
to be in Tarble and be a quarter over and eat

less because I had no money on me." She
considers herself neither "displeased or
greatly thrilled by" the new meal plan, although she is "glad that they have a choice. I
am not sure that this is a great one."
Those on the 14 meal plan seem undecided
as to whether they will continue with the new
option. "Next year I'm actually wondering if
I am going to do it again because it doesn't
seem to make a difference," says Lee.

CEP report: where to gofrom here
The new draft of the CEP report raises a number ofissues that we feel
should be addressed further.
Many of the changes that the CEP report proposes are more geared
toward faculty and adminstration instead of students, but the CEP must
recognize that certain of its proposals will have powerful impacts on
student life. As long as CEP realizes that these policies should not be
implemented without significant student feedback and dialogue, we see
no problem with them. They will only become a problem if there is no
debate over them and they are merely accepted by CEP as a matter of
course.
This second draft already shows a clear improvement over the first in
terms of acknowledging student priorities. Clearly, the input from
student CEP representatives did already make a difference. In order for
the report to truly reflect the students of the College, their voices must
continue to be heard. And, their voices will be heard more loudly and
more clearly if they are affirmed by a larger percentage of the student
body.
The bottom line is that students need to read and discuss the CEP
report. This document gives us an “official” view of what Swarthmore
should be. If students don’t like it, here’s a chance to say so. You’re
being provided with the means to criticize the way the College is
deciding its future. Use it wisely.

Why we like Myrt
Every year, Myrt Westphal, director of residential life, receives a
number of visits, e-mail messages and phone calls. Unfortunately for
Myrt, who is one of the most important and least acknowledged people
on campus, the majority of the contact she has with students is directly
related to problems—complaints about less than ideal living situations
(Mary Lyon basement rooms, in particular), issues about lottery numbers and room selection, and tirades about the frustration of living with
incompatible roommate(s).
Yet Myrt never hears from the rest of us, most of whom have never
stepped into her office or even spoken to her. This means that she
doesn’t hear about students who opt to stay with their freshman year
roommate for one or two more years. Nor does she hear from first-years
who find their new best friend in their next door neighbor. She doesn’t
hear what an amazing reassurance it is for the majority of first-years to
have a normal, friendly roommate with whom they can actually envision sharing their precious personal space.
Nor is Myrt ever properly thanked by those people whose room
changes she does grant. Myrt turns those dreaded Mary Lyon basement
doubles into on-campus singles, converts Willets closet singles into
full-size singles, and works magic in converting spaceslike the Danawell
lounges into luxurious freshmen doubles with a view of the Crum.
What Myrt does hearabout is those things that are completely out of
her control. Dramatic increases in the size of the student body are not
her doing, but she is the one who is responsible for taking care of the
repercussions. Living situations this yearmay not be perfect, but Myrt
miraculously found housing for everyone.
Since Myrt only hears from us when we are disgruntled, upset, and
potentially homeless, we would like to thank her at this calmer time of
year for all of the neat things she has done. Myrt, we think you’re pretty
cool. Thank you.

clarification of our policies

In case you haven’t noticed, this semester our editorial board is
composed of representatives from the student body as a whole, in
addition to members of our staff. Our goal in creating this board is to
ensure that the editorials in this column reflect the views not only of
Phoenix staff members, but of a broader segment of the community. All
of the editorial board’s members take responsibility for the opinions
expressed in our unsigned editorials.
We’d also like to reiterate our long-standing policies on conflicts of
interest, on anonymous sources and unsigned letters to the editor.
The writers of news articles are not permitted to have any substantial
interest in the story other than the interestany reasonable student would
have. This means, for example, that officers and active members of
campus groups may not write news stories about those groups; that
writers may not profile their roommates; and that individuals who
participated in a campus event may not write about that event. This
policy applies with varying degrees of strictness to sections other than
news. In general, editors of the sports, features, and arts & leisure
sections are required to make a good-faith effort to find disinterested
writers before allowing individuals with a conflict of interest to write
any story. By nature of the section, the opinions section does not have
a conflict of interest policy, but conflicts of interest are always clearly
disclosed in the writer biographies at the bottom of each article.
The Phoenix only uses anonymous sources when the information has
been confirmed by at least two sources, the story is of overwhelming
public importance, and the sources requesting anonymity can expect
severe consequences should their identities become known. The identities ofanonymous sources must be known to the reporter and at least
one editor.
Our policy on unsigned letters to the editor is similar. Ordinarily,
letters to the editor must be signed. Where the interestof the community
is best served by publication of a letter, but the writer can expect severe
consequences should his or her identity become known, we will
consider withholding the writer’s name. However, the writer’s identity
must in all cases be known to the editors, so we can confirm that
anonymity is required and that the letter is not a hoax.
The Phoenix is published weekly, except during examination and vacation periods, by the
students of Swarthmore College. Community submissions are welcome; please contact the
appropriate section editor before submitting anything other than a letter to the editors. The
Phoenix reserves the right to edit all material for length and clarity.
Letters and opinions articles represent the views of their authors, and not necessarily those of
The Phoenix or its staff. Unsigned editorials represent the views of The Phoenix as determined
by its editorial board; they do not necessarily represent the views ofany individual staff member.

Herbivores Decry the Vilification
To the Editor,
We are wondering what provoked
Brian Gobin's editorial "Vegetarian
Elites?" in last week's issue of The
Phoenix. In addition to coming out of
nowhere, the editorial was filled with
misconceptions and displayed the
ignorance on which the author based
his opinions. Gobin directs his editorial at "the many Americans who
made the choice to stop eating meat
in moral protest against the abuses to
animals." The image of vegetarians
as snobby, cappucino-toting, bleeding-heart moralists seems to be the
prime motivation ofhis tirade against
vegetarianism.
The main argument seems to be
that a) vegetarians are vegetarians
only because of moral scruples concerning cows and chickens; b) in place
of meat, vegetarians eat only vegetables; c) these vegetables—"just
about everything in the produce
aisle"—are handpicked, generally by
nonwhite, uneducated workers with
few opportunities; and d) by eating
vegetables, vegetarians are supporting these unfair labor practices. He
laments the conditions of a world in
which dairy cows live in an "idyllic
scene" with plenty of grass and open
space and in which the standard of
living of U.S. citizens, agricultural
workers in particular, seems less important than that of livestock.
First of all, should our society—vegetarians and meat-eaters alike
eliminate consumption of vegetables
to avoid exploitation of crop pickers?
And second of all, what is the source
of this information? Most livestock
in the U.S. is raised not in idyllic
pastures but in large indoor factory
farms. Concerning vegetable production, when one considers that the average farm size has increased from
family farms to industrial farms and
that the rise of technology has resulted in a decrease in human employment in the agriculture industry,
it seems odd that migrant workers
have a veritable monopoly over all of
—

the produce in the grocery store.
Gobin fights not only for the rights
of the migrant -worker, but also for
vegetables: "Who advocates for the
well-being of tomatoes? Vegetables
are really marginalized in this society." Attempts at humor in the form
of statements like this and the assertion that "only three brain cells and a
lot of feathers distinguish a chicken
from an unusually large eggplant"
mask the reasons underlying many
people's choice to become vegetarians. Perhaps it isn'tobvious to Gobin
that the plant and animal kingdoms
differ in more ways than feathers and
brain cells, most notably in terms of
trophic level and growth. Because of
this difference, crop plants yield food
more quickly and with less input of
resources than your average Elsie,
the cow. A vegetarian diet consumes
less energy, water, forest land, and
topsoil than a meat-eater's diet does,
as well as using fewer pesticides. In
fact, approximately one third of the
total amount ofall raw materials used
for all purposes in theU.S. goes to the
production of meat, dairy products,
and eggs.
Though Gobin claims that most
middle-class American vegetarianism is driven by moral reasons and
that "vegetable elites divert attention
from genuine social problems to the
silly fashions of a group with little
else to worry about," consumption of
animal products encourages inefficient distribution of food. Approximately one-third of the world's grain
production is fed to livestock. It takes
about two pounds of grain to produce
a pound of chicken, four pounds to
produce one pound of pork, and eight
pounds to produce one pound of beef.
Approximately 90 percent of the protein, 96 percent of the calories, 100
percent of the fiber, and 100 percent
of the carbohydrates we invest as
feed in our livestock is lost to human
consumption. Lester Brown of the
Overseas Development Council has
estimated that if U.S. citizens would

"Diversity" Includes Respect for Athletes
To the Editors,
This past week, an extremely disturbing article appeared on the pages
of The Phoenix's Opinion page. The
short sidebar entitled "The true value
of intercollegiate sports" is by far one
of the most ignorant opinion pieces
that I have ever witnessed in this
newspaper.
I began reading the article with
such high hopes. Both the title and
the opening paragraph seemed to be
an effort to finally give varsity sports
the recognition that they so desperately deserve. Unfortunately, from
there on out this editorial turned decidedly sour. I sincerely wish that
there was one part of the ensuing
article that I agreed with or even
found to be grounded in some sort of
common sense, but sadly there wasn't.
The author(s) of this editorial obviously show no respect towards
Swarthmore College's student-athletes. It was first stated that while
some believe that "our athletes' choice
to participate is grounded in free will,"
others (such as The Phoenix's editorial board) believe that the issue of
recruitment proves this statement
false. God forbid thatany Swarthmore
student do an extracurricular activity
because we like it. We play these
sports for the pure love and enjoyment of the game.Student athletes in
no way feel "obligated to play." It is
the thrill of competition, the challenge, and yes, even the "cathartic
potential" of sport which drives us to
play intercollegiate athletics, and not
the idea that we must because it is
expected of us.
Another shocking statement located in the very same paragraph is
that during the recruiting period "the
student-athlete's perception of campus life and classes is filtered through
the coach and the athletes he or she
stays with." Is this statement meaning to say that our view of the campus
is not a worthy or significant one? Is
the non-athletic impression of campus the only one? While our perception of campus life and classes may
be different than those Swatties who
do not participate in athletics, it is
still worthwhile one, and we are students at this school as much as any
other. If we were to listen to the
Editorial Board's claims, one would
think that athletes are a subjugated
minority here at Swat whose views
simply do not matter. The claim that
we skew any prospective student's
view of the college is completely

foolish.
Yet the overall theme of this editorial involves a greater issue. In the
editorial board's article, they speak

of positive aspects of Swarthmore
and in it they mention "top-notch
teaching to a diverse student body."
The fact of the matter is that if
Swarthmore College did not attempt
to recruit student-athletes, you would
have a campus which would be anything but diverse. Although this statement cannot be left alone, because
manyS wattiestend to have thewrong
idea of the word diversity.
Where does diversity stop?
Di versity' s definitionis a simple one:
difference, variety. Although here at
Swat, you are led to believe that the
definition is slightly skewed. For
many here, diversity is just a number
which tells us how "multicultural"
the campus is. The problem with this
is that diversity is not just a matter of
ethnic variety, but also of things such
as ideology or sociology. This is all
too often something that is overlooked
at Swarthmore.
The editorial board's suggestion
that recruitment of student-athletes
be limited will severely hurt this diversity which so many cry out for
daily. Also, if someone should question the "unnecessary expenditures"
involved in recruitment, should I not
merely retort that the "outreach" programs of various ethnic groups on
campus should come into question as
well? That, however, would be as
ludicrous as the implication made in
last week's editorial.
In closing, let me address one more
issue which came up in last week's
article. In it, the author(s) state that
because of therecruiting process, athletics is taking precedence over academics. Nothing can be farther from
the truth. It has been my sincere pleasure to play sports alongside some of
the most "socially conscious and academically talented students" on this
campus.
However, the editorial board feels
that Swarthmore's main priority
should be sending "enlightened and
talented individuals into the world."
The article suggests that athletics is
not helping this goal, but hindering it.
To that I must reply that it is because
ofthe presence of dedicated studentathletes that Swarthmore College is
accomplishing the above goal with
ease.
To quote directly from last week's
editorial: "While it is counterproductive to gloat about our number one
ranking, we should remember what
the award signifies." With that it
seems that the editorial board has
summed up my argument precisely.
Think about it. In the meantime, I'll
be at practice.

reduce their meat consumption by 10
percent, it would free over 12million
tons of grainannually for human consumption. It is ironic that the "silly
fashions" of the vegetarian "elites"
could help to lessen the barriers between the elite and the hungry.
Gobin seems to pit vegetarianism
and social conscience against each
other. He proposes that raising domesticated animals in agricultural
warehouses makesit possible for low
income households to consume more
animal products, when it is actually
tax-funded government subsidization
of the agricultural industry which
keeps consumer prices low.
Furthermore, social injustice is, unfortunately, an aspect of almost any
form ofconsumption, including consumption of meat or of vegetables. If
social concerns are on one's list of
priorities, the following tidbits may
be helpful.
First, factory farms oflivestock are
designed to minimize human labor,
resulting in low employment as well
as in the energy-intensive processes
we already touched on. Second, the
use of farm land to grow food for
cattle pushes the price and availability of foods formerly grown in a region beyond the reach ofmany of the
local people.
Third, some native rainforest tribes
are being wiped out completely by
destruction of their habitat for grazing land for livestock. Fourth, the

workers is one of the highest among

Gobindoes not decry a non vegetarian
diet as exploiting unskilled, underprivileged laborers.
No, we are not endorsing vegetarianism as a magical cure-all. We are
simply saying that vegetarians are
not evil and are not all misled. Gobin
objects to the phenomenon in which
"vegetarians mistakenly (emphasis
added) place a lot of moral significance on the lives of really dumb
domesticated animals."
How can one person justifiably
label another person' s morals as mistakes? We are not saying that vegetarians take the high moral road while
meat-eaters burn in hell, but we wonder how an editorial writer is authorized to make blanket statements assigning values to others' morals.
Gobin's narrow assignment of
morals as the force that motivates
most vegetarians ignores the other
aspects of vegetarianism, which we
have briefly laid out in this letter. We
hope that the factual and logical errors in "Vegetarian Elites?" were blatant enough that the article was
laughed at, but if the article was taken
seriously, we hope we have cleared
that confusion.

of Our Ranking,

To the Editors,
Upon reading the editorial in last
week's Phoenix entitled, "The True
Value of Intercollegiate Sports," we
wondered whether the author seriously believed his/her argument or
was simply attempting to generate
discussion. Supposing the latter, such
conversation has indeed been generated among many students. The author stated that "Ideally intercollegiate sports at an academically challenging institution like Swarthmore
provide students a healthy outletfrom
social pressure and the rigors of
study." He/she concluded that at
Swarthmore, athletics are an added
stress because they take up as much
time as a class. The argument continued that recruitment is an unnecessary expenditure and that students
who are recruited feel obligated to
play. The author went on to say that
athletics should not dominate over
academics and suggested that all
sports be intramural in order to prevent this from happening.
We are shocked that such a view
might be held by anyone on this campus and would like to respond. We
believe that intercollegiate athletics
at Swarthmore do provide a healthy
outlet from academic rigors. Intercollegiate sports can be stressful but
it is a different sort of stress, one that
we find energizing rather than draining. Not only are sports fun, but they
also provide valuable life skills. Athletes learn what it means to be a
leader, to set goals and to achieve
them, to work in a group towards a
common end, and how to lead a balanced life. One team contains a variety of personalities and athletes learn
to appreciate and depend on others
who are not like themselves.
We are not sure what experience
the author has had with recruitment
or why he/she feels we are spending
too much money on recruitment, but
clearly Swarthmore is not a big athletic magnet. There is no athlete here
who does not have the academic credentials to be a Swarthmore student.
Furthermore, if Swarthmore were in
financial trouble, thereare many other
budgetary items that could be cut

and Our Pride

without the negative effect that cutting recruitment budgets would cause.
Recruiting at Swarthmore never results in a scholarship or even a binding agreement. Students play intercollegiate sports because they want
to and because they enjoy it, not because they feel forced to' do it.
Intramural sports are fun, but for
many students they dp not provide as
rewarding an experience as varsity
and club sports do. Competition is
healthy, as is intercollegiate rivalry.
Anyone who has been to a
Swarthmore-Haverford basketball
game can attest to the amount of
energy and school spirit in the gym.
Intercollegiate sports provide entertainment for athletes and non-athletes alike. Part of the U.S. News and
World Report ranking considers student satisfaction and extra-curricular
activites. If we had only intramural
sports, Swarthmore would not be
ranked number one.
We would like to take this argument
one step further and claim not only
that sports are not taken "too seriously" at Swat, but that they are not
taken seriously enough. The author
contends that athletics shouldn't take
precedence over academics. This is
clearly not the case at a school where
varsity athletes show up late to practices and games because ofclasses or
labs.
In fact, sports should be taken more
seriously than they currently are.
Swarthmore does not stand for mediocrity in any aspect of campus life
with the exception of athletics. This
is unfair and unjustifiable. We need
to field more winning teams and fill
the stands with more students and
professors.
Overall, student-athletes deserve
more respect. We work as hard in the
classroom as everyone else and then
work hard on the field everyday. By
writing this editorial, you have offended approximately 33% of the student body. This is just another illustration of the lack of respect studentathletes receive on this campus.

Varsity Athletics are Not Detrimental to Swat
To the Editor,
In your disturbing and misinformed
September 27 editorial, "The True
Value of Intercollegiate Sports," you
state two main problems with athletics at Swarthmore. These are undue
pressures placed on students through
recruitment, and financial strain
caused by resources devoted to athletics rather than other areas.
First of all, you imply that the pressures placed on students by coaches
during recruiting and then as studentathletes to continue playing is overwhelming. This is simply not true.
Any athlete can name several players
who were highly recruited but decided not to play once they came
here. Coaches here understand that
academics come first, or they lose
their positions and their players. It is
condescending and arrogant to assume that we, the athletes, cannot
make intelligent and difficult decisions in prioritizing our lives. Should

we eliminate The Phoenix because it
is stressing out the editorial board?
Believe me, we are not concerned
with producing "the next Michel Jordan," or with being number one at all
costs. Perhaps the editors could spend
more time talking with athletes and
less time watching shoe commercials
when forming a basis for their next
article.You imply that Swarthmore is
crumbling under the crushing burden
of recruitment costs, citing postage,
home visits and phone calls. Well,
it's an easy accusation for you to
make given that The Phoenix neglected to cite a single fact in this
article, let alone investigate the athletics budget.
I would be shocked if the total expenditure of the Athletic Department
on mailings and phone calls was more
than a negligible part of the
Swarthmore budget. Furthermore,

you assume that recruiting athletes is
done for the sole purpose of "fielding
successful teams," and then imply
that this takes precedence over recruiting "socially conscious and academically talented individuals."
Again, you are writing about something which you obviously know
nothing about. Athletics does not take
precedence over, or substitutefor academic excellence— the phrase "student-athlete" is not an oxymoron.
A campus with no serious athletes
is a campus lacking in diversity. We
resent the idea that athletics has nothing to offer to Swarthmore, especially given our unusually high participation rate. Division 111 sports
offers a less all-sacrificing yet still
intense experience for athletes of
varying skill levels and backgrounds.
Giving that up would mean sacrificing an essential element in the liberal
arts education.
I will not imply that athletic budgets, or even athletics in general
should be exempt from scrutiny.

Vincent Jones

Now, this will probably make me a
pariah within liberal/progressive activist circles, but I do not believe that
capitalism can be blamed for the
majority of society's problems. In
fact, I happen to think that maybe the
capitalist system largely drives the
movements which attempt to address
the woes of a great many people.
Don't be alarmed, my defense ofcapitalism does not make me a supporter
of laissez-faire or of the free market
being unleashed. Instead, I aim to
direct attention to the true source of
many of our greatest dilemmas—the
political system.
As a history (and economics) major, I tend to study the past to understand the present and postulate about
the future. That oppression, poverty,
gluttony, discrimination, sexism, and
a litany ofother evil phenomena have
manifested themselves in various
forms since the emergence of humankind cannot be denied. However,
modern capitalism developed only
recently. After the demise of feudalism in Europe, a new form of economic organization emerged in the
form of Mercantilism. As time progressed, this system evolved and grew
(largely due to the wealth created by
the toiling of enslaved Africans) into
modern capitalism.

I realize that my summary of the
history of capitalism may be a bit
short and lacking of several important details. However, I do not intend
to discuss the development of capitalism but to illustrate how its existence did little to promote the growth
of racism, sexism, classism and every other "-ism." Instead, I would
argue that the failure of the established and emerging political systems of the world to protect the interests of those not in the elite created
and perpetuated the rigid class structures, racial hierarchy, patriarchal
systems, etc. which we must contend
with today.
By definition, capitalism acts to
maximize utility or meet needs, while
political systems necessarily limit certain freedoms for some greater good.
In the former, the laws of supply and
demand promote existence in a state
of equilibrium in which resources are
not wasted and people's needs and
preferences are fulfilled. On the other
hand, the latter works primarily to
keep, promote and extend the status
quo.
Moreover, capitalism does not preclude changes within the elite strata
(or preferred brands) of a given society. To illustrate this fact, consider
automobiles. At thedawn of the automobile era, big American cars ruled
the roads. Over time, the U.S. car

industry has witnessed a dramatic
decline in market share, partly due to
the popularity of foreign cars which
tend to be more dependable, cost efficient and better designed. In this
instance, market forces have allowed
for a major realignment of the market. To my knowledge, this type of
realignment has happened few times
in history. And whenthese instances
do occur, it generally has resulted
from or precipitates a collapse of the
existing political structures.
Furthermore, political systems enact barriers which inhibit the ability
ofcertain groups to effectively shape
their nation to better meet their needs.
A prime example ofmy thesis can be
found in this great country of ours.
The founding fathers intended for
this country' s political system to protect the interests of white men of
property. The amount of social, economic and political power historically and currently enjoyed by this
group demonstrates the success of
the framers of the Constitution in
establishing a framework to meet their
goals. At the same time, the large
number ofBlacks (designated to constitute the lowest strata of the social
hierarchy in the Constitution) who
are unemployed, undereducated, under-skilled, and deprived of political
and economic power reflect the
system's to maintain the status quo.

Yet the desire to better one's condition through advertising (if you will)
the merits of a movement (such as the
civil rights movement) and the inadequacy of the status quo has resulted
in greater equality in this country
(which still has a long way to go).
Most successful movements can be
likened to a good marketing strategy.
In both cases, an item or an issue is
presented to the masses in a manner
which will hopefully influencepeople
to buy a product or support a particular cause, either through voting or by
cash, check or credit card.
So, if you truly wantto bring about
intrinsic change in the lives of a great
numberof people in this society, then
attack the deficiencies and inequities
in the political system. The failure of
our leaders to address the true problems or to propose adequate solutions hurts someone more than an
abstract concept. To give an analogy,
guns don't kill people, people kill
people.
And on those lines, the laws of
supply and demand, marginal utility,
etc., do not make people poor
people do. The political system consists of people organized in a government and the true face of capitalism
has yet to be identified. Thus far, the
experts have only been able to ascertain the existence of "the invisible
hand."

States Government, enter into agreements to train armies that the US., for
diplomatic reasons, cannot. This was
the case in the Balkans, and MP came
to the rescue. The rest, as they say, is
history.
Fascinating tale, eh? Maybe. The
future of warfare? Most probably.
War, according to German philosopher Von Clausewitz, is the continuation of policy by other means. As
long as nations and governments stick
to a policy direction someone else
dislikes so much that they are willing
to pick up arms to challenge it, war
will be with us.
Now that the direction of war (especially in developing countries) favors private armies, wars may become even more brutal, as the normal
moral leashes are removed, since the
killing has now been contracted out
and people can kill indiscriminately,
saying, "sorry, nothing personal; just
business. The damned stockholders
have been watching the numbers too
closely oflate!" The potential for this
evolution of warfare becomes even
more apparent as we see increasing
evidence that in a number of countries, transnational firms like Shell
Oil have begun to either build their
own armies or contracted private
firms to defend oil installations or
in the case of Nigeria, have worked
closely with government security
forces to mount offensive operations
against groups considered dangerous
to their financial interests.
With these two samples of what
may turnout to be the future of war
safely tucked away in your minds,
please reflect on Oscar Arias's address. Disarmament is ideal, and necessary for global peace, but if it is not
done by all at once, forget it, because
someone (like the proverbial free
rider) will spoil the party. My instincts regarding his radical proposals are these: as long as nations/
peoples/communities continue their
vaunted search for modernity, using
violent means, peace will never be
seen; they will seek out instruments
of coercion to force others to see their
viewpoint. This naturally then im—

plies that all searches for modernity
must be peaceful (a la Gandhi), a
proposal that becomes more difficult
to hold onto. As long as enough folks
feel slighted, the use of weapons is
the sole way they will perceive for
righting wrongs.
Francis Fukuyama once asserted
that the end of the Cold War also
meant the end of History. He was
roundly criticized as being too myopic. In a sense, he was not really
wrong, if one views the search for
modernity as a drive to enshrine and
enforce the principles of the French
Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) in each society. Thus, ifin the
process of seeking to achieve that
goal, one runs up against an obstinate
enemy, how doyou tackle them?Use
violence, or non-violence?That will
depend on something else: how have
people's minds changed? Are their
decision-making reference points still
the same, or has someone demonstrated to them that other avenues
beyond violence exist? That I felt
was an issue Oscar Arias did not
address; how do you change the
public's frame of reference?
It is one thing to stop weapons
sales, and call for demobilization, but
it is another to win the hearts and
minds ofentire nations, changing their
mindset. It is also another thing to go
beyond the mundane, and challenge
societies to attack the basic forces
that drive mankind to warfare: the
lack of participation in the institutions that shape your existence. That
in my mindis one area that should not
be neglected: the people who ultimately will suffer should be the ones
spearheading the work.
It's fine to appeal to American students, but shouldn'tan appeal be made
to average folks in the streets of
Colombo, New Delhi, or Lagos, or
Cotonou, or Mogadishu to take whatever steps are necessary to educate
themselves to force their governments
to stop purchasing weapons? True
peace cannot be found until all
belligerents, armed and potentially
armed, become contractual participants in their community.

To the Editor,
I have learned that anyone who
begins a discussion of athletics with
acknowledgement of the "stress release" provided by participation has
no appreciation for the essence of
athletics, which is competition. As
such the editorial of September 27th
was fundamentally flawed, as the
writers demonstrated at the outset that
they have no knowledge of why Swarthmore athletes play their sports or
what they gain from playing. To be
fairand accurate, a cost/benefit analysis must be based on an
acknowledgement of the benefits.
It is instructive to remember that
intercollegiate athletics in America
are a unique phenomenon. They began in the late 19th Century because
students felt that academics, chapel
and the other activities available on
campus were insufficient. At Swarthmore and other colleges, students desired acompetitive avenue and chafed

Solution to Parking
To the Editor,
"Solutions to Car Crisis" on the

Opinions page (Sept. 20 issue) surprised me greatly in that therewas no
mention of the environmental impact
of the expansion of parking facilities
on "our beautiful campus." Nor was
there any mention of other possible
solutions, such as car pooling and
petitioning for improvement of
SEPTA service. Surely there must be
a more creative and environmentally
friendly solution to parking problems than to pour more concrete on

their life. Beginning with baseball
and football they challenged students
at other schools to contests in which
a score was kept and the object was to
win. Had they merely wanted to "relieve stress" they would not have
chosen these games. Athletes at Swarthmore are like their 19th century
counterparts in that they play for the
love of the game and the challenge of
competition, not for a scholarship or
a chance at a professional athletic
career; they are true amateurs.
The authors criticize the expense
and effort of recruiting student-athletes to Swarthmore. Our coaches
recruit as a necessary means to the
end of providing our players a healthy
competitive experience. Simply put,
a student who wants to play basketball deserves the chance to play with
enough other talented players that
she has a chance to win. Going 1-22
is not as healthy and educational an
experience as going 13-12 or 22-1.
Since all our recruiting is done under
the guidelines set by the Administration and within the spirit of a college

dedicated to academic excellence it
does not nothing to debase the academic or social atmosphere here.
Attacking recruiting is a common
tactic for a critic who disagrees with
the end to which the recruiting aims.
Rush Limbaugh and his kin attack
colleges for recruiting minorities and
utilizing affirmative action because
they disagree with the end goal of a
diverse campus. In discussing athletics at Swarthmore the focus should
be the value of competitive sports to
the athlete. Hundreds ofcurrent Swarthmore students and thousands of
Swarthmore alumni can accurately
testify that, while the core of their
education occurred in the classroom
and the library, they also learned

important lessons about themselves
and about working in a group environment from the fields and courts of
intercollegiate competition. In teaching these lessons, intramural games
and fitness workouts are no substitute for the challenge of intercollegiate athletics.

Freshmen Who
Don't Recognize
Their Place

It's

tough to be a freshman. 8:30 a.m.
classes. Your new roommate snores.
You miss your dog.
Yeah, it's tough.
So I thought that I would dedicate this
week's column to the most importantproblem facing Swarthmore freshmen today:
how not to annoy upperclassmen.
Let me begin by expounding upon the
reasons why you, as a freshman, would
not want to annoy upperclassmen.
First, chances are, the upperclassmen
are much bigger than you. If you annoy
us, we will hurt you. But you're probably
saying, "I might be smaller, but I'm
quicker, and upperclassmen tend to be
weighed down by more and heavierbooks
than mine."
Yeah, sure, you might be quicker, but
you can't hide forever, and you don't
know the terrain as well as we do. Eventually, we will find you and that will be

that.
Second, upperclassmen oftenhave cars.
Yes, even you will someday get sick of
Pasta Bar. One of these days just the
thought of the Warden will reduce you to
tears. You will need to climb out of this
gastronomic pit called Swarthmore College, and one of these upperclassmen
might take you to Nifty Fifties (provided
you pay, of course).
Third, course selection. It's always a
good idea to run your course selection-for
next semester by an upperclassman. They
might just tell you that not only is Education 14 a three-hour class once a week
with substantial amounts of reading, but
you also have to spend a large chunk of
your free time riding a bike in the rain to
nearby elementary schools to watch little
brats give each other, and you, noogies.
Or maybe they'll tell you about the slimy,
bloated sea cucumber lab in Bio 2.
Okay, so now since you cute little guys
know the why, let me tell you the how.
Don't stand outside an upperclassman's
room, or anywhere other than the darkest
depths of the Crum, at 2:30 in the morning
screaming, cackling, or making any sort
ofaudible sound.
We're old and we need our beauty sleep.
You're young and have so much to live
for. Don't provoke us.
Don't set fires.
Loud music is just as good with your
door closed as it is with your door open.
We do not think you're cool just because
you listen to Coolio.
There is a well-documented myth that
all Swarthmore women end up with eight

inches less hair on their heads by the time
they graduate thanwhen they startedSwat.
For some reason, all that hair ends up on
the floor of my shower. Freshmen with
long hair should take their hair with them
when they leave the shower.
Sign up for study breaks on your hall.
Sign up for extra study breaks. We're
hungry and you have nothing to do.
Why don't you spend some of the energy that you had previously been releasing outside upperclassmen' s rooms at 2:30
in the morning and direct it toward the coop? Go explore the Milano cookies (They
come in many varieties now! Dark chocolate! Milk Chocolate! Mint or Double
Chocolate! Wow!) or the frozen cheesecakes. Hey, you could even bake us something.
Don't speak unless spoken to. As with
every rule, there is always an exception.
Some guy named Joe who lives on
Wharton E/F Second told me he wants
frosh to talk to him. I am by no means
endorsing this, and I suggest talking to
him only at your own risk.

Sign up for study breaks
on your hall. Sign up for
extra study breaks. We 're
hungry and you have
nothing to do.
Lord knows, I want to see happy freshmen. But I don't want to see you in my
lounge. All cuddling should take place
within the confines of your own room, or
in one of those conference rooms in
McCabe. The basic rule to remember here
is: don'ttouch me when I'm around, don't
touch each other when I'm around.
Don't complain about the amount of
work you have to do. We don'tcare if you
have three 25-page papers, a lab, an econ
problem set, and fourteen journal entries
all due on the same day you are going to
have your wisdom teethremoved and your
appendix taken out; we don't wantto hear
about it. You're pass/fail and the upperclassmen will never let you forget it.
So I hope, my little fledglings, that I
have been able to impart to you some of
the precious knowledge I have collected
over my numerous years here. Remember, all these suggestions, except for the
one involving Joe, have been kid-tested
and mother-approved.

Jones '9B leaves campus for
Philadelphia every Monday through
Thursday from noon until approximately 6:30 p.m to work on his Lang project.
As a Lang scholar, he receives money and
support from Eugene Lang '3B, to design and
implement large-scale service projects. Jones'
project, which began at the beginning ofthis
school year, is a mentorship program called
GAIN Growth And Initiative Network.
To begin the program, Jones is training
twenty high school seniors at Bartram High
School Communications Academy to mentor
-

seventh graders in their feedermiddle school.

The program is designed to give the seniors
training, resources and pride in their work,
and to provide a useful service to the seventh
graders.

Jones works with the seniors for the last
two periods of their day from Monday to
Thursday. Currently, the students are preparing for their work with the middle school
students. They are undergoing two weeks of
intensive training led by Jones which will be
followed by a weekend retreat at Swarthmore. The training they receive covers everything from resource management and conflict resolution to computer skills and first
aid. When the training is complete they will
begin mentoring twice a week at the middle

school.

In the few weeks that Jones has worked

their attitudes. They have gone from being
apathetic to being very excited about the program.
Jones thinks it is a matter of being proud
and challenged by the work ahead of them.
"Now they have responsibility. What they do
affects someone else." The program "works
better for the mentors than the mentees."
GAIN provides the students with training and
resources, gives them valuable experience
and helps them prepare for college. Above all,
it gives the students an "expanding knowledge of career opportunities" and an idea of
how to attain them.
The idea came to Jones "in stages." The
summer after his first year at Swarthmore he
spoke with other students about the relationship between Swarthmore and Chester. Jones
felt that with many of the Swarthmore-based
community service programs, Chester residents became dependent on the studentsworking with them because the students controlled
everything. He felt that "for any program to
be successful in the long run, it needs to
empower the people."
That summer, he worked with the California Teen Leadership Program in his hometown of Los Angeles. Jones had participated
in the program previously, but was now a
leader, working with teens to provide support
and to look at issues in the community. As a
leader, he found that he got even more out of
the program than he had as a participant. He
began to formulate his idea as a Lang project
during his sophomore year, reading as much
as possible on education and inner cities, and
getting feedback from professors and fellow
students.
During this past summer, Jones began the
first stage of theprocess. He set up contacts at
the high school and middle school, and designed the training curriculum and an evaluation tool that will determine whether GAIN is
working. He is evaluating the program continually so that he will be able to build on the

experience and improve the program next
year. Jones also hopes that his ongoing evaluation will enable others to follow in his
footsteps.
For Jones, one of the most important aspects of the program is that it is sustainable.
Next year he will train someone to take his
place and he will look for additional funding
to keep it going, though the school already
has some resources. The mentors come from
the same area as the mentees, eliminating the
need for outside help.
Jones says that his work "in many ways
keeps my sanity," gives him "a different
perspective on the world,...[and] helps me
appreciate Swarthmore more." It challenges
his paradigms. He feels that more people
need to work on community service projects;
black students, especially, "should work to

GAIN provides the students
with training and resources, gives them valuable experience and helps
them with preparing for
college.
help others" instead of letting white students
comprise the majority of participants in such
programs.
In the future, Jones would like to attend
law school and eventually work for the government, where he wants to focus on urban
education problems. "Students are not being
prepared [for the future]" he said. Students
are given uninteresting "busy work" that
does them no practical good and turns them
away from school. GAIN hopes to give them
interest in their school, challenge them, and
give them pride and interest in their community.

is Woody Allen's raison
d'etre. And as irritating as many of us
may find that, it is difficult to ignore
that his movies still somehow have managed
to be consistently engrossing, not to mention
hilarious, for about three decades. (Okay, so
maybe Shadows and Fog left more than a bit
to be desired, but you get the point.)
Mighty Aphrodite is his latest feature, and
it definitely lives up to the Allen standard.
Lenny (Allen) is a regular uptown
Manhattanite married to Amanda (A Room

a Merchant-Ivory period piece for a change).
They want to have a baby, but with her art
career really taking off, Amanda is not quite
ready to dedicate a year of her life to being
pregnant. So they adopt a bouncing wee lad,
and after much hassle, name him Max.
But Lenny and Amanda's relationship soon
starts to turn sour, as does just about every
marriage in any Woody Allen film. Amanda
starts sleeping with one of her co-workers at
her TrißeCa gallery, and it is at about this
time that Lenny, in the typically Allenesque

obsessed with finding Max's birth mother.

On-Campus Movies

By Emily Shartin
Andy Murray

Phoenix: When did you start playing the
violin and the harp?
Eva Allan: I started when I was three, but
I've only taken lessons for ten years. My
mother made me start the piano before I
began studying the harp when I was twelve.
P: What made you decide to play the harp?
EA: Before I can remember, my mother
played flute and harp duets with an amazing
jazz harpist named Liza Rey. She told my
mother that the piano is very similar to the
harp in that both instruments read the same
clefs, and that until I became big enough to
play the harp, I should take piano lessons.
Therefore, I grudgingly practiced scales on
the piano until I got my first harp six years
ago. I met Liza Rey this summer at the World
Harp Congress.
P: What is the hardest thing about playing
the harp? Which is more difficult, the violin
or the harp?
EA: The violin is more difficult to keep at
a high level—if I don't practice the harp, I
only lose technical skill while if I neglected
the violin, I would lose technical skill, tone,
and everything else. Probably the hardest
thing about the harp is having to concentrate
on the music, the conductor, my fingers, and
my feet at the same time. The pedals operate
rods inside the harp which turn pegs that
shorten or lengthen each string to create
accidentals (sharps and flats). To change key,
a harpist uses her feet—which is why harpists
don't like accidentals in the middle ofa piece.
P: Which instrument do you play in the
Swarthmore Orchestra?
EA: Both the violinand the harp. I have the
most fun of all the musicians in the orchestra—whenever a piece doesn't need a harp, I
escape to the anonymity of the first violin
section. With a piece such as Debussy's "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun," I have a
wonderful time playing very prominent
glissandos, but so many symphonies don't
require a harp and there is always room for
more violins.
P: What are other pieces will the Orchestra
perform at the end of the semester?
EA: It will be an exciting progamme
Tchaikovsky's "Capriccio Italienne,"

terizes this farcical film, as it rightly should.
One can't help thinking that Linda would
in many ways make a better mama to Max
than Amanda, even when she blatantly offers
Lenny pro-bono services after he takes her
out to dinner.
Sorvino is absolutely hysterical in this role,
and many will agree that she deserved the
Oscar she won earlier this year for this performance.
Of course everything is satisfactorily reconciled in the end, but the real delight is
watching the various interactions along the
way. Allen uniquely employs a Greek chorus
led by F. Murray Abraham to interject and
narrate the story at various points, offering
some side laughs. But Sorvino ofcourse is the
trip, the ultimate reason to watch the film, a
mighty force in Woody Allen's most recent
triumph.
Mighty Aphrodite plays Friday in Du Pont
at 7:30 and 10 p.m.
Somewhere in the middle of John Woo's
Broken Arrow, someone gasps, "The nukes
are gone!" The statement won't be half as
surprising to anyone stuck watching the movie
up until this point and the picture really has
little else to add in terms of plot.
The Hong Kong director's recipe for making an American action film seems largely to
have been (1) get big name actors, and, (2) go
crazy with special effects. Yes, it is a dish you
have definitely tasted before.
The film's opening moments find the camera swirling down on Major Vic Deakins
(John Travolta) beating the tar out of his copilot, Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater).
Officially, it's boxing so there is no reason to

call the MP's. Nevertheless there's something not quite right about that John Travolta
character.
Satisfied that they have sufficiently
scrambled their brains, the aviators depart for
a secret test flight of an expensive B-2 bomber.
The B-2 is equipped with all the options:
cruise control, AM/FM radio, auto-door locks
and two nuclear warheads. To absolutely no
one's surprise, Major Deakins attacks Captain Hale again, crashes thebomberand steals
the two missiles.
Obviously, the film winds up being nothing more than another opportunity for the
reborn Travolta to strut. Major Vic Deakins
dons khakis and a black turtlenecks that make
enough of an impression on his fellow outlaws for them to gush,"Deke, you da Man!"
And, clearly, he is. Travolta's grin is all that
Broken Arrow has going for it.
Painfully clumsy scenes of Pentagon and
Army officials trying to respond to the crisis
are enough to make it seem like things would
be safer if the bad guysheld onto the nukes for
a while. Captain Hale enlists the help of a
dimwitted, gun-toting, park ranger (Samantha
Mathis), but she does little to better the image
of government employees. When her rigorous psycho-analysis of Major Deakins leads
her to conclude, "He's insane," audiences
may well defect to the side of the psychos in
hopes that Deke will drop one of the nukes on
her.
As all this happens, Woo takes little notice.
The director seems more interested in crashing helicopters and hurtling bodies across
wide, open spaces. So many people fly out of
planes, trains and Humvees in this movie that
one begins to expect that Woo needs little
excuse to send bodies shooting like bottlerockets.
One might argue that at least the only lazy
arcs in the film are being traced by stunt men
and not by missiles, but neither this argument
nor John Travolta can save Broken Arrow
from being a big—well, why say it?
Broken Arrow plays Saturday in Du Pont at
7:30 and 10 p.m.

Dvorak's "Carnival Overture," and Schubert's
"Unfinished Symphony." It is a unique
programme for me, because I will play harp
in three and violin in only one (the Schubert).
That is very unusual.
P: Have you played in other orchestras
before?
EA: Orchestra has always been my favorite musical venue. For the past three years
I've played both violin and harp in the Portland Youth Philharmonic, which is the oldest
youth orchestra in America. We played the
same world-class repertoire that the Swarthmore College Orchestra plays. During concerts, it was always fun to run back and forth
from the violin section to my harp. My harp
would often be placed on a square platform so
that the audience could hear the harp better.
Once, during the "Blue Danube," I had just
run from the violin section to my elevated
harp, and after playing my little harp entrance, I leaned comfortably back in my chair,
only to topple noisily off the platform! Some
people may thinkthat harpists are more graceful than other performers...
P: Has the Orchestra had a harpist before?
EA: Not for a while, I gather. The College
itself doesn't own a harp. I had to ship mine
from my home in Oregon.
P: Has playing the harp influenced your
personality?
EA: Oh, yes, definitely. I am turning into
the stereotypical harpist—long hair, delicate
manners, formal tastes, I love to wear skirts,
I'm romantic...l love the classics and the
traditions of the past. Harp has traditionally
been a parlor instrument for the upperclasses.
Marie Antoinette played the harp, and it is
historically the one musical instrumentwhich
has been played primarily by women. Mostly,
this is because women have smaller hands
and fingers than men. Earlier this century,
Carlos Salzedo designed a harp with wider
spacing between the strings which is popular
with male harpists.
P: Do you hope to play professionally?
EA: I hope to play in a symphony orchestra
for my entire life; I don't know if I want to
choose between violin and harp, which I
would have to do if I wanted to join the
greatest orchestras. At Swarthmore I hope to
double major in music and either English
literature or art history, and I would love to
get a Ph.D. and teach college someday, too.

Gibson Gets Gritty in

Mad Max, Road Warrior
By

SWIL's

Fred Bush

upcoming movie double fea-

ture, Mad Max and The Road Warrior,
showcases the two films that madeMel
Gibson a star. Post-holocaust action films,

they take the themes from old samurai and
Western films and infuse them with some
Aussie weirdness.
Gibson's character in these films is similar
to the "Man With No Name" so effectively
portrayed by Clint Eastwood in a number of
spaghetti westerns. A cop with a loving wife
in Mad Max, he is eventually dehumanized
and defeated, degenerating into an uncommunicative, violent loner in The Road Warrior. His psychological collapse parallels his
increasing level of violence used in dealing
with the demonic punks that populate postholocaust Australia.
The world in which these movies are set is
eerie, alien, yet disturbingly close to our own.
It's this bleak, Wild-West setting with weird
technological innovations that gives MadMax
and The Road Warrior their narrative power.
Ourreal life is always two weeks from falling
apart: that's when stored supplies offood will
run out in cities. Here, we are presented with
a culture which has died, where people must
survive on the scraps that remain of the previoushigh technology. It's a world where law
and order have fallen apart, where gas is hard
to find, and human life is cheap. It's a world
where the shotgun is a law of its own, and
where driving under gunfire is a necessary
skill. It's a world often ripped off; most
recently, in No Escape and Waterworld.

The demonic punk culture that fills the
margins of Mad Max and The Road Warrior
is another disturbing element that is often
cannibalized for other films. These nightmare creatures have no redeeming virtues:
they're crude, warlike, and given to psychotic violent rages. They rape, pillage and
kill, and wear bizarre clothing. They're not
even smart; just the dregs of human society
that deserve to be wasted.
The violenceis the beauty ofMad Max and
The Road Warrior. Much of the death and
chaos in the movies revolves around neat
toys: bladed boomerangs, double-barreled
sawed-off shotguns, or the übiquitous car
chases. Max drives the last of the V-10 Interceptors: armored police cars, sleek and fast,
ready for battle. There are endless car chases:
adrenaline-pumping, car-ramming, slickmaneuvering duels of artistic destruction.
The final pitched battle in The Road Warrior,
with dozens of cars, outlaw and friendly,
engaged in vehicular manslaughter on a wide
scale, is intense and very exciting.
These are brutal films. People get killed;
there is rape, torture and gratuitous violence.
Even animals suffer. These films are not for
the weak of heart. However, for those others
who watch Westernsand cheer on the heroes,
for those who want to see Gibson's earlier
oeuvre, here's your chance. The bad guys
truly deserve their deaths; no moral ambiguity here. The car chases are stupendous, and
Gibson makes a great psycho loner.
Mad Max and The Road Warrior will be
showing in Kirby on Monday, October 7, at
10 p.m. Admission is free, and all are invited.

Evil Buzzards Earthworms Win Twice, Remain Undefeated
Are Hurting
By

Jerome Bushnell

&

Ashwin Rao

This past weekend, on a dismally gray
Saturday, without a mascot buzzard in sight
in the overcast sky, the Evil Buzzards lost

their first home match of the season against
York by a score of 23-12.
For the past few weeks, the Buzzards have
been plagued by the loss of many of the more
experienced ruggers on account of various
injuries. Despite fielding a team which was
much less cohesive than usual, the
Swarthmore ruggers still managed to hold
their own and play a very competitive game.
Early in the first half, neither team had
gained much of an advantage over the other
until York quickly seized the initiative by
attempting a kick on a penalty called against
Swarthmore on the forty meter line. The kick
was completed to give the York squad the
lead 3-0. Soon after, they followed this up
with a legitimate try, and failed to convert on
the kick, leaving them ahead by eight points.
The Buzzards weren't satisfied and increased theirefforts to get on top. Wanting to
keep the fans coming back for more provided
enough incentive for the Buzzards to increase
theirmomentum. The first score ofthe game
by Swarthmore came in the middle of the first
half when Adam Blescia '97 punted the ball
far down the field, beat all of the apparently
confused Yorkers to it, and downed it in the
try zone for five points. Tony Sturm '99
added two points to this by converting the
kick, leaving Swat only one point down.
Sturm ended the scoring in the first half by
brushing off the protesting York defenders
and out-racing them for a good fifty meters
before finally laying down what ended up
being the Buzzards' last score of the game. At
half-time the Buzzards trailed 12-8.
After this spectacular comeback in the first
half, Swarthmore had trouble maintaining its
intense level of play and couldn't get up the
drive to score again. York took advantage
early in the second half, rucked the Buzzards
downfield, and added a try and conversion to
their score. York kicked the ball straight
through the goalposts on another penalty to
increase their lead to 18-12. York capped the
scoring with a try to seal a 23-12 victory.
The Buzzards lost even more players to
injury in the York game, and the team that
they will field this weekend against the University of Pennsylvania will have an even
more Herculean task than the teams in the
past three weeks. Swarthmore hopes to prove
once and for all that the top liberal arts school
in the country is, at least on the rugby pitch,
better than any Ivy Leaguers.

The Swarthmore women's ultimate team
made their presence known from the start of

Saturday's tournament with amazing flow

against Virginia Tech, theWarmothers dominated and led after the first half 6-0.
In the second half, the Warmothers managed to give up only one score in completing
an 11 -1 romp. LenaLoewenthal' 97 led scorers with three catches and Claire Arbour 'OO
added two. Cathy Wirth '99, captain Mandy
Hourihan '9B, and Jill Eaton '99 each recorded two assists each.
The Warmothers employed a zone defense,
featuring Courtney Harter '97, Arbour, and
Annie Bacon '99 with Loewenthal directing
from the long-long position.
As the day progressed, it became evident
that the zone was instrumental to the
Warmothers' success. "[Arbour] and [Bacon] played in the cup all four games. I don't
know how they did it but they did. Throwing
zone helped us a lot. Our opponents weren't
ready for it," said Wirth.
In the second game, the Warmothers shut

The Swarthmore women's soccer team

faced a grueling schedule this past week with
games on Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday. On Saturday the Swarthmore women
hosted Western Maryland.
The first half was evenly matched as the
Swarthmore women held Western Maryland
to only two goals with a tough defensive
game. However, in the second half, Western
Maryland scored four goals while the Garnet
only scored one. The lone Swarthmore goal
came from Sarah Jaquette '9B in the latter
part of the half to prevent the shutout, 6-1.
Swarthmore traveled to Cabrini on Tuesday for an afternoon match that ended in a 21 loss.The unusually smallsize ofthe Cabrini
soccer field and the fact that many members
of Swarthmore's starting lineup were late
due to class conflicts contributed to the "lack
of cohesiveness" that captain Claire Baxter
'9B felt hurt Swarthmore in the game.
Baxter and Kirstin Knox '99, key players
in the Swarthmore midfield arrived at half
time, after which the team was able to bond
together to create a more effective attack and
defense. Jaquette scored the goal off of a
beautiful assist by rookie Catherine Laine
'9B.

you to work on." Harter, who dished out two
assists and caught five in the end zone, played
magnificently in this game.
The third game of the day posed more of a
challenge to the Warmothers who faced longtime rivals Haverford. The game appeared
fairly evenly matched. Then at the suggestion
ofLoewenthal, the Warmothers adjusted their
zone so that Wirth played man-to-man on
Haverford's captain.
By blanketing her effectively, the
Warmothers were able to extend a nice lead
and won the game, 11-4. Loewenthal, as
expected, made five defense blocks in the
game whileArbour made two. Bacon, Arbour,
and Amy Rhodes 'OO all had multiple scores
in the end zone. Loewenthal and Sarah Wise
'96 made several assists.
The Warmothers ended their day by defeating their hosts, the University of Maryland. Although fatigue had set in, the
Warmothers won 7-3. Wirth and Harter had
multiple assists while Bacon and Eaton each
scored twice. By winning all four games and
the tournament, Swarthmore is sending out a
message to their opponents.
The Warmothers are hoping to capture a
berth for Regionals this weekend when they
travel to Lehigh for Sectionals. "This coming
weekend could be very exciting. We have the
chance to make our best showing at Sectionals
ever," said Harter.

Wombats and Lovers at Play
By Cheri Goetcheus

&

Annie Bacon

Excitement was constant throughout the
weekend on Cunningham Fields as Intramural Soccer picked up right where the Seven
Sisters Field Hockey Tournament left off.
In the early games, the Willets Basement
Wombats were awarded a forfeit win over the
Lambnuts. TheWombats played an ice hockey
game, nonetheless, on fields that were recovering from Saturday night's downpour.
The International squad put together another win with a very physical 3-1 victory
over the Burlap Barbarians. In the nightcaps,
the Latin Lovers officially welcomed the
Cygnet Shoppers to the league with a 31-1
thumping. Once the Cygnet Shoppers, who
have already changed their name twice, find
that team cohesion they should be a force to
reckon with.
On the upper field the Fabulous Faculty/
Stupendous Staff squad pulled out an over-

fense was clicking as their short game propelled them to an 8-7 lead, with the game
hard-capped at nine.
Said co-captain Noam Unger '99, "I really
wish I could list everybody on the team,
especially the frosh,
because everybody
really stepped up
their level of play.
Once we got the jitters out in the
Bucknell first half, we were in every game.
Everyone contributed, which is a great sign
for the rest of the year." Unfortunately, Penn
State was able to pull out a 9-8 victory.
Just like Bucknell before them, Penn State
was scheduled to play Swat A after the B
team. Penn State came out fired up and hungry for victory over the undefeated Earthworms. Although Swat took the half at 7-2,
Penn State just missed several opportunities
in the endzone.

They were unable to fare any better than their alumni

as "the best team in the conference."

"We played really well at Gettysburg, and
they were a really good team. However, we
kept our defense strong and our confidence
up, and, I think, overall, we proved to ourselves that we are a good team that can handle
serious competition. It was a great inspiration
for this weekend's game against Dickinson,"
said Betsy Rosenbaum '9B. With this new
confidence and "cohesiveness," the
Swarthmore women ought to give Dickinson
a tough time on Saturday at Homecoming.

Swarthmore Prepares for Homecoming 1996?
Rachel Gutman

As part of a drive for increased
school spirit and loyalty to our sports
teams, the Social Affairs Committee
will be hosting a Swarthmore Homecoming celebration this weekend. The
plan is that this weekend's program
will increase fan support at athletic
contests and build a more fervent
attitude in the student body.
As Tanisha Little '97, co-director
of SAC, says, "When U.S. News &
World Report ranked Swat # 1, people
were excited; they were doing dances
on Parrish beach. We hope to use
Homecoming weekend as a way to
continue that spirit and enthusiasm."
While this is not the first year there
has been a Homecoming event, this
is the first time in many years that so

many activities have been planned
and so much funding has been allocated to this festival. In fact,
Swarthmore used to have quite extensive homecoming events, but this
tradition died out several decades ago.
In past years there have been Homecoming weekends, but there haven't
been campus wide spirit-raising activities. Instead, Homecoming has
been coupled withParents' Weekend
in past years, and the only real distinguishing feature was that many of our
teams played at home. This year,
Little and the entire SAC boardfelt it
was "time to do something a little
different."
This program, almost solely sponsored by the Social Affairs Committee, is part of a push towards promoting school spirit and loyalty. Little

and Aisha Moss-Koonce '9B ran last
year for co-directors of SAC on a
platform to support different types of
activities, including Homecoming.
Thus, this weekend is a realization
of one oftheir dreams for Swarthmore.
As Little says, "Aisha and I had the
idea to have a weekend celebration
and our committee justkept coming
up with ideas abouthow to do it; it has
really been a group effort."
The Homecoming festival will begin on Friday afternoon and last
through Saturday. In Sharpies on Friday, at 6:15 p.m., there will be a pep
rally andfreepom-poms will be given
out, courtesy ofTarble. According to
Sharpies representatives, there will
be a festive meal complete withdecorations to create "the right kind of
atmosphere" for this event.

SAC is in the process of applying
for a fireworks license. Assuming
this is granted, there will be a lights
display at 7:00 p.m. on Friday
evening, following the Pep Rally.
According to Activities Committee
members, it looks likely that this will
be approved.
The Homecoming party will take
place on Friday night in Tarble from
10:00p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Little reports
there will be "great food and an offcampus, professional DJ."
Preceding the athletic events, there
will be a tailgate party next to the
Field House, also sponsored by the
Social Affairs Committee.
The scheduled athletic events are:
the 1996 Men's Eastern Rolex Small
College Tennis Tournament,
women's field hockey vs. Dickinson,

women's volleyball vs. Moravian,
women's soccer vs. Dickinson, and
men's football vs. Ursinus. All games
begin at 1:00 p.m., except football,
which is at 1:30 p.m.
There is also an alumni flag football gamebetween S wat and Ursinus.
The first half will take place on the
football practice field prior to the
football game, and the second half
will be played at half-time.
While student response to Homecoming seems generally supportive,
there are those who feel this is not the
right way to spend money and that
such a program is not needed or appropriate at Swarthmore. Dan Sachar
'97, expressed his feelings by saying,
"It reminds me of high school. I was
under the impression I had graduated
from high school."

Learning the Hard Lessons CrossRising
of Life on the Playing Field Country
By

As hosts ofthe Seven Sisters Tournament, the Swarthmore field hockey
team (7-4 overall) had an exciting
weekend. Three high energy performances by the Garnet resulted in a
return trip to the finals and a second-

place finish overall. Two Swarthmore
players were named to the All-Tournament Team, and on a different note,
two were sidelined with injuries.
Yesterday's conference win against
Muhlenberg marked the much anticipated return of Lia Ernst '97.
Seeded first in the tournament as
two-time defending champs,
Swarthmore faced Vassar in their
first-round contest, whom they easily dispatched, 4-0. In the first half,
the Garnet got off to a big start.
Danielle Duffy '9B scored on a penalty stroke which she placed into the
lower left cornerof the goal. Samantha
Peltz '97, assisted by Holly Baker
'99, recorded the first of her many
goals this tournament with ten minutes left in the half. The half was
marred only by an injury to the right
knee of defenseman Lynne Steuerle
'99. Sujin Seo '97 played in Steurele's
stead and played well for the rest of

the tournament.
Peltz scored again in the opening
minutes of tfte second half on an
assist by Donna Griffin '99. Peltz got
the rebound off Michelle Walsh's
'9B shot from a corner to get her
second goal of the game. Lurah Hess
'99 scored unassisted with twenty
minutes left in the game off a baseline
corner play. Swat took 32 shots in the
game, compared to Vassar's four.
Coach Karen Borbee was "very
pleased" with the game and noted
that it was "definitely a team effort.
It's the kind of game you love to see,"
she said.
■Swarthmore's second round game
was against fourth-ranked Smith. The
Garnet dominated and outshot their
opponent 36-11 but were unable to
put one past the goalie in regulation.
The first sudden-death overtime
period, in which each team is limited
to six players and the goalie, presented each team with opportunities
to claim victory. Kelly Wilcox '97,
who had a fabulous tournament and

Goalie Wilcox made the initial save
but was not in position to stop the
follow-up shot. Wellesley scored
again off a well-designed corner play
which had a long, hard shot being
taken from a player farther back than
is usual. The Garnet lost Hess in the
first half when her fingertip broke
and split open, upon being pinned by
the ball.
In the second half, Walsh received
a card for talking to the officials and
a Wellesley player was awarded a
penalty stroke following the defensive play of Walsh. Wilcox stopped

Saturday the Swarthmore cross
country team returned to Lebanon
Valley State Park to compete against
Lebanon Valley, Muhlenberg, and
long timerival Allentown. The companions were able to channel their
knowledge of the course into a tidal
wave of aggression.
The race marked a definite turning
point in the season. The strategy departed from elaborate race plans and
controlled pace. From here on out,
the approach is to be as gutsy and as
aggressive as possible.
Swarthmore's top five men broke
into the overall top six, placing first
in the meet. Phil Jones '99 captured
first place with a time of 27:16. Wyn
Strodtbeck '9B flew into third at
27:44, Jeremy Weinstein '97 fourth
at 28:03, Graham Lucks '9B fifth at
28:11, and finally Kerry Boeye '97
sixth at 28:15. Cameron Warner'97
finished at 28:32 and Gordon Roble
'99 at 28:43.
Team spirit played an important
role in the success of the women's
race because it was the first time
where almost all the members of the
women's team competed. Co-captain Danielle Wall '97 encouraged
the women to help one another out
along the course, while Coach Erica
Chiavetta prepared the team for the
race: "Just keep looking at the person
in front ofyou. Focus on their shoulders and let them do the work. Before
you know it you'll be passing them."
Throughout the race, coaches Ted
Dixon and Chiavetta, as well as the
men's team, followed the women
along the course cheering them on.
Although the women were defeated
by Allentown, they finished strong
led by Becky Riskey '9B crossing the
finish line with a time of 20:39 in
second place, and right behind her
Danielle Wall '97 at 20:46 in third.
Amalia Jerison 'OO finished sixth
at 21:01. Amy Klosterman 97 came
in seventh with a time of 21:51. Then
came Alison Schirmer '97 in 14th at
22:24, Debra Junnila '97 in 19th at
23:11, and Karen Lloyd 'OO in 20th
with a time of 23:29 all contributing
to the team score.

Tides

By Alex Lundry

The Swarthmore football team took
the field at Gettysburg College last
Saturday with high hopes to upset the
Bullets in their rainy Homecoming
day game. The Garnet Tide carried a
lead going into halftime, but the Bullets pounded the Tide on both sides of
the ball in the second half. The
scoreboard at the end of the game
read 35-15 in favor ofthe Bullets, but
the real story cannot be told through
these numbers.
The opening kickoff was inauspicious for the Tide, who opened up the
drive on their own one yard line. The
offense, led by Patrick Straub '97,
worked its way into shallow
Gettysburg territory before they were
forced to punt.
After the defense forced a three
and out against the Wing-T offense
of the Bullets, the Tide offense drove
to the Gettysburg one yard. There the
Tide failed to punch the ball in on
their first two attempts before a Bullet defender intercepted one of
Straub's passes.
For the rest of the first quarter the
crowd was treated to quality, but
scoreless, football by both teams. In
the second quarter both teams came
out firing. Only minutes into the new
quarter Straub threaded the needle
between two defenders to find Mason Tootell '99 in the end zone for the
first points of the game.
Gettysburg retaliated soon thereafter to tie the score up 7-7. Then with
little time remaining in the first half,
the Tide put together a stupendous
drive led by receiver Lou Basenese
'OO and running back EddieShin' 97.
With no time remaining in the half
and the ball insidethe Bullet' s twentyyard line, the Tide faked a field goal
and Straub hooked up with a wide
open Tom Forstik 'OO for a touchdown. To add insult to injury, the
Tide faked their point after attempt,
and Straub ran the ball in for the twopoint conversion. At half-time,
Swarthmore went into the locker extremely pumped up with a 15-7 lead
over Gettysburg.
Most of the third quarter was fairly

Erin "Schlumpy" Flather is one of the most consistent field hockey
players in Swarthmore Athletics. Leading the defense and controlling the
flow of the Garnet's play, the two-year captain contributed greatly to the
Garnet's second place finish in the Seven Sisters Tournament. Her silent
leadership on the field during both games and practices inspires her
teammates. Both fellow players and assistant coaches Christine Fillipo
and Julie Mazer complimented Erin on her great stick skills and her solid,
"wall-like" defense. Head Coach Karen Borbee said, "You don't need stats
to know that Erin is doing a great job. She possesses just the right
combination of aggression and calmness on the field."

Eddie Shin, returning from a year's hiatus from football, was named to
the Centennial Conference Honor Roll this week for his superb performance this past Saturday against the Bullets of Gettysburg College.
Eddie, a running back, rushed 125 yards on 17 carries in the game, while
averaging 7.4 yards per carry. Fellow teammate, Alex Lundry' 99 credited
Eddie's "awesome" running insparking the Garnet's offensiveflow in the
first-half. Lundry said, "His running made us look good." Co-captain
Kurk Selverian '97 said, "Eddie has really stepped up this year. After not
playing last year, he has adopted the starting role and has had tremendous
impact on the offense."

uneventful. But with about three minutes remaining, the Bullets pounded
through the Tide's defense into the
endzone. After a successful two-point
conversion, the score was all tied up
going into the final quarter 15-15.
In the fourth quarter all aspects of
the Tide's game collapsed. Battling a
fired up Gettysburg unit and some
extremely questionable calls, the Tide
began to come apart at the seams
under the pressure. Before the Tide
could figure out what had happened,
the Bullets had scored three more
touchdowns though they were stuffed
on two out of the three conversions.
Although the Tide garnered another loss, there are a number of
positives to use as a stepping stone
into this week's game. Straub and
Basenese connected a total of seven
times for a total of 127 yards. Eddie
Shin averaged 7.4 yards per carry on
17carries for a total of 125 yards. The
offense seemed to click this past week
in a way they had in no other game
this season.
If the Tide can combine their focused offense of the Gettysburg game
with the defense's steady play thus
far, the Ursinus Golden Bears need
fear their trip to Swarthmore. The
Bears are undefeated going into this
week's contest, and the Tide are hoping to exploit weaknesses that the
coaches have noticed in the Bear's
game. The potent passing attack of
the Bears may be stunted since their
star quarterback is questionable due
to an injury. Either way, the Tide are
well prepared to show this week's
Homecoming crowd what they are
really about.

After beginning this season with
several disappointing losses, the
Swarthmore men's soccer team can
finally swim in the pool of victory,
sail in the ocean of triumph and sunbathe on the beach of success. The
team won both games it played this
week by a score of 1-0 with one in
overtime.
On Saturday, the team faced Western Maryland in a Centennial Conference game.The overtime goal electrified the home crowd. Joel Yurdin
'99 scored the goal with five minutes
left in the overtime period after cocaptain Dave "In the Fast" Lane '97
flicked Yurdin an Amber Thompson
'97 pass.
"There was nothing pretty about it
it was an ugly goal, but, at the
same time, it was beautiful because it
allowed us to win the game," said
Lane. For Yurdin the goal was particularly meaningful. "It was Joel's
first game winner goal. He was extremely excited and so were we all,"

said Lane.
On Wednesday, the team played
Wesley on an unkempt football field
with more dirt than grass. Asidefrom
justbeing aesthetically displeasing, a
dirty field causes other problems.
"On a field like this, the ball
bounces really high. We have a lotof
trouble controlling the ball on foot.
That caused a lot of unfinished opportunities," said Lane.
The only goal of this game was
scored by a combined effort between
Lane and Kyle "House of Style"
Barnett '97, another co-captain. The
two co-captains were able to perform
a textbook version of a move known
as 'threading the needle.' Their skill
ensured the team' s victory and a beautiful finish to the game.
Lane finds that the players have
now been working together long
enough to feel like a team, which can
only be a sign of future success. The
Garnet are on the road for their next
two contests. Saturday the Garnet
travels to Dickinson, and Wednesday
they are at Eastern.

10 years. We heard substantial Fac-

ulty and student questioning about
whether theserequirements are still
effective for achieving our educational goals in current circumstances. There are specific criticisms of PDC's, as well as broader
concerns about the overall organization of our requirements. Increasing diversity of approaches within
disciplines and departments, as well
as the increasing importance of interdisciplinary approaches that
cross-cut departmental and even
divisional lines, raise questions
about the reasonableness of basing
the rationale for our requirements
primarily in the departmental and
divisional structure. If changes in
the world students will enter after
graduation demand differentpreparation, then our requirements
should reflect those differences.
We suggest that the Faculty give
serious consideration to shifting to
an approach to requirements based
on the ideaof "competencies", such
as written expression, quantitative
analysis, textual analysis, experimental methods, visual analysis,
analysis of the creative arts, foreign language, historical analysis,
inter-cultural perspectives. This approach would identify competencies all students should acquire
and then identify courses, in various departments and often more
than one division, that promote
those competencies. We propose
thatFaculty consideration of acompetency approach to requirements
be undertaken through creation of
a plan that includes definition of a
specific set ofcompetencies, identification of costs (including administrative costs) of implementing this approach, and implications
for student demand in various departments.

In the belief that planning is done
best when an institution is strong
and not facing crisis, the Board of
Managers and President Al Bloom
have initiated a long-range planning effort to sustain into the furare the excellence of the education we offer Swarthmore students.
Because the academic program is
central to our mission as a College
the President asked CEP in the
winter of 1996 to begin identifying
topics that should be central to
planning for Swarthmore.
We saw three fundamental
guides for planning: first, the broad
and long-standing goals of
Swarthmore's educational program, second and third, the current
external circumstances and internal concerns to which our educational program must respond in
order to maintain our ability to
achieve those goals. The broad
goals of a Swarthmore education
have consistently been identified
as intellectual excellence, especially cultivation of the intellectual ability to analyze and respond
creatively to complexity; and social responsibility in the application ofthat intellectual excellence.
The external circumstances most
persuasively invoked in the preliminary discussions are 1) the internationalization of almost every
arena of activity in which students
might eventually participate and
the increasing social and cultural
diversity within most nations; 2)
the veryrapid development oftechnology, especially for the management of information; and 3) the
current questioning ofthe value of
liberal arts education. The internal
concerns we heard most frequently
evoked 1) the effects of increasing
pressure on the role of teacherscholar, 2) the need for mechanisms of innovation in the curriculum, without threat to depth, and 3)
the necessity of adequate linkage
between Swarthmore and the
world, including preparation of students for a wide range of future
career paths.
This report proposes six major
topics that we believe require the
long-range perspective and the focused effort of planning. These
areas were sifted from those raised
in the panel discussions on the
future of the College held last
spring and in recent reports by
several major Committees and
Task Forces. We gave priority to
topics clearly derived from the fundamental issues described above.
Several are connected to more than
one. The topics we propose for
planning are briefly outlined below. Fuller presentation of ourrationale for these choices and our
suggestions for planning strategies
constitutes the remainder of this
document.
In bringing this proposal to the
Faculty now we seek confirmation
and endorsement of the agenda we
present. Does it address those issues Faculty see as having the significance, scope and potential for
future guidance to justify our engagement in long-range planning?

2. Mechanisms for Innovation
in the Curriculum are necessary

disciplines. This approach encourages a kind of "zero-based" look at
the first two years —indeed, at the
whole four years. If we were to
rethink our curriculum with competencies in mind, one list (for
purposes ofillustration only) might
include the following:
1. Written expression
2. Quantitative analysis
3. Textual analysis
4. Experimental methods
5. Visual analysis
6. Analysis of the creative arts
7. Foreign language
8. Historical analysis
9. Inter-cultural perspectives
10. Understanding of some
discipline or interdisciplinary

to include in our planning the possibility of Faculty appointments,
eitherfull or joint, into Concentrations, with the concomitant shift of
certain programs to continuing status. Visiting Committees in Black
Studies, Public Policy and
Women's Studies have all recommended such appointments in the
last three years.
Gaps in the Curriculum need
to be identified and given priorities. An important aspect of this
planning will be assessment of existing Faculty interest and abilities
in proposed areas. A more effective procedure for allocation of
new positions also needs to be
designed.
Community-Based Learnwas
the subject of an extensive
ing
three
years ago. The Report
report
recommended that communitybased teaching strategies already
used at Swarthmore should be
viewed as analogous to laboratories and supported adequately. CEP
believes that our current planning
efforts should specify what support for current programs will be
required in future and also assess
Faculty interest in making additional use of community-based
learning if support is provided. We
see a rationale for encouraging additional opportunities for community-based learning both in the
broad goals of the College and in
current concerns about improved
linkage between Swarthmore and
the world. However additional use
should be planned for only if Faculty interest is strong, because it is
essential to the quality of this form
of learning that it be closely integrated into the curriculum.
Technology in support of the
curriculum we recommend as one
aspect of more comprehensive
planning about technological innovation on campus. Planning
needs to include decisions not only
about specific technology to be
added, and supported, in the near
future, but also about processes of
decision-making to be used about
technology on an ongoing basis.

to be sure the College can be responsive to changes that occur, with
increasing rapidity, in the intellectual world as well as many other
spheres of human experience, and
consequently exert influence on the
needs and the interests of both students and Faculty. However, such
mechanisms must operate without
threatening continued excellence
in existing programs. It is also important to scrutinize innovations to
determine whether they will in the
longer run impede future flexibility and to what extent they exacerbate the burdens on Faculty as
teacher-scholars. Concentrations,
for example, although they are a
very effective means of bringing
new areas into the curriculum, have
raised concerns among some Faculty because their administrative
demands and teaching commitments may actually impede further
innovation and increase the stress
on Faculty. Planning should attempt to define mechanisms that
offer opportunities for flexibility
and innovation in the curriculum
without impeding future flexibility and without exacerbating administrative burdens on Faculty.

believe is necessary for achievement of our broad educational
goals, especially in the context of
the increasing diversity among our
students, as well as the social and
cultural complexity they will encounter after Swarthmore, both internationally and in their home societies. Because issues related to
diversity span the domains of the
College, we recommend that planning for recruitment and retention
of a diverse Faculty be included in
College-wide planning about diversity, guided by the recent recommendations of the Task Force
onDiversity. For the academic area,

"Swarthmore experiences"
emerged from our discussion of
requirements as another related,
but distinct category for planning.
We see these as a kind of experience available at Swarthmore
which, while not required, is sufficiently valuable and distinctive that
opportunities for students to participate should be maximized. Such
"Swarthmore experiences" as close
relations between students and
Faculty in joint research, guided
encounters through which principles learned in the classroom are
tested in the world beyond campus, participation as partners with
fellow students and teachers in
seminars, and participation in the
Honors program itself should have
enough support that in future we
can in good conscience encourage
students to engage in them. Planning should specify the support
needed.
2. Innovation In the Curriculum. While the College must be
sure to continue doing well what it
has always done well, it must also
be sure that it can be responsive to
changes that occur, with increasing rapidity, in the intellectual
world and in the external world.
Planning for change or flexibility
is inherently difficult, because serious planning requires some kind
of structure, and structure is often
the enemy offlexibility. Efforts to
meet the need for innovation may
also have results that complicate
efforts to relieve the pressure on
Faculty as teacher-scholars. What
the College can do is to examine
existing curricular structures to see
whether they impede or enhance
innovation and to consider new
mechanisms that might be effective in ensuring adequate flexibility at minimal cost in administrative burden.
—lnterdisciplinary programs.
Concentrations were created in part
to facilitate the introduction ofnew
areas and approaches into the curriculum, because these so often
cross disciplinary and departmental boundaries. The recent revision
of Concentration status to require
periodic renewal was intended to
encourage the Faculty to consider,
among other queries, whether the
once innovative subject ofthe Concentration might have become so
fully incorporated into other parts
ofthe curriculum that the program' s
task was complete and the Concentration might consequently be laid
down. International Relations is a
recent case in point. This new procedure was intended to reduce the
likelihood that persistence of too
many Concentrations would exacerbate burdens on Faculty and impede further flexibility. Some Faculty have expressed concern that
these risks are still great. Planning
should include exploration of ways
to reduce administrative burden of
Concentrations as well as means of
innovation other than Concentrations. For example, during the preliminary discussions the following
were suggested as ways to achieve
this: defining one course out ofthe
five-course teaching load as a "flex"
course for Faculty to teach a subject of their choice; an "incubator"
category in the curriculum for experimental courses; a rubric for
new courses that do not fit into a
department or program. [We note
that the Study Group format proposed by CEP last year also offered a less burdensome way for
Faculty and students to share interdisciplinary interests.]
Certain Concentrations, on the
other hand, pose questions about
transformation in the opposite direction, that is toward ongoing status, which would in turn permit
Faculty appointments. Visiting
Committees for Black Studies,
Public Policy and Women's Studies have recommended that at least
joint appointments be made into
the programs sponsoring these
Concentrations. Part of our planning agenda must be to propose
specific responses to these recommendations, which will require
careful examination of the issues
surrounding hiring and evaluation
of Faculty who would most probably share appointments between
a Program and a Department.
Curricular gaps and allocation of new positions are additional issues to examine in connection with curricular innovation
and flexibility. Certainly a major
task for planning is to identify
which new areas have priority for
addition to the curriculum. Although we believe that some new
areas can be added using mainly

Faculty resources already available at Swarthmore and in the TriCollege community, some would
require new Faculty positions. As
was pointed out in the report from
the Task Force on Faculty Composition and Work Load, current procedures forallocation of new positions are cumbersome and sluggish, and are entirelyreactive. That
is, there is no institutional mechanism for asking what new areas
(either within or between departments) should be represented. Instead, the Provost and CEP await
proposals from departments and
evaluate them, on what is inevitably a somewhat piecemeal basis.
This enables one to ask, "Is this a
worthwhile proposal," and even
"Is this proposal more worthwhile
than that proposal?" But it does not
allow one to ask, "Is this the most
important thing to support at this
time?" CEP thinks it is important
to find a way to ask that question
regularly and systematically. A
plan that will allow us to achieve
reflective innovation is needed, and
the Task Force proposal for a new
committee on allocation is an excellent place to start.
Community-Based Learning A final potential source of curricular innovation is in the area of
community-based learning. The
report to the faculty by Barry
Schwartz a few years ago summarized community-based programs
that already exist at the College,
and argued that they receive inadequate support. His suggestion was
that community placements be
treated as analogous to laboratories in the natural sciences, and
supported accordingly. That report
also suggested a variety ofpossible
extensions of community-based
initiatives to other areas of the curriculum. One outcome ofthis longrange planning process should be a
decision about whether or not
Swarthmore wants to encourage
the expansion of community-based
learning opportunities or simply
support what it is doing now. Arriving at this decision requires that
we assess faculty interest in making additional use of communitybased learning in the curriculum if
adequate support is made available, and then (assuming for the
sake of argument that such interest
exists) assessing the financial and
human costs associated with doing
community-based learning right.
CEP believes that encouraging
additional opportunities for community-based learning is consistent both with the broadest College
goals and with current external circumstances. It can be argued that
for teaching in many fields, community-based learning offers an
excellent strategy, perhaps the ideal
strategy, for training students to
analyze and respond to complexity. Community-based learning
also offers many opportunities for
teaching about issues of social responsibility in the application of
intellectual skills. However, we
also believe that we should plan
for its additional use only if strong
faculty interest is expressed, because it is essential to the quality of
possible community-based learning opportunities that they be
closely integrated into the curriculum by an enthusiastic faculty. It
should be noted that a large-scale
integration of community-based
learning into the curriculum would
distinguish Swarthmore from virtually all other elite institutions
and thus perhaps set a useful example for other educational institutions.
—Technology: In 1995-96
Tom Stephenson was asked by the
President to prepare a report to the
College Planning Committee on
information technology at
Swarthmore. In his report of February 8,1996, Tom recommended
that a new administrative position
be created to supervise the operations of the Library, computing
Center, Media Services, Language
Learning Center and the technical
support of the Lang Performing
Arts Center. He outlined arguments
for placing this position at either
the Vice Presidential or Associate
Provost level, but did not advocate
one over the other. The second
recommendation in the report was
for creation of a new committee on
Information Services to replace
both the Library and Computing
Services Committees. The thirdand
final recommendation was that concrete means be identified for improving the integration of the activities of the Library, Computing
Center and Media Services—pos—

sibly by bringing them together in
the same space.
The report on technology identifies key issues for planning, but is
not in itself a plan for future action.
The long-range planning we are
about to begin should start with the
Stephenson report and proceed to
choices among the recommendationsand definition of specific next
steps and associated costs.

3. Support for the TeacherScholar. The guiding question for
our thinking about planning related
to Faculty is: how can we best
support teaching and scholarship,
and most important, their mutual
reinforcement?
Improved support for teaching
needs to be provided in response to
several current challenges. Rapidly changing information technology, an increasingly diverse student body and the greater difficulty of linking research and teaching all pose challenges for
Swarthmore Faculty who wish to
be excellent teachers. It is ofcourse
necessary for Faculty to be well
trained in the use of new technologies added to our classrooms and
labs. Morefundamentally, it isalso
imperative that Faculty have the
time, the guidance and the access
to equipment necessary to explore
what instructional technologies are
available and potentially beneficial for Swarthmore classes. They
need to understand the options so
that they can make informed
choices about technology to enhance their teaching.
Diversity of our student body is
an institutional goal that has important implications for the ways
we teach and the support needed to
ensure excellence in teaching. In
recent years both students and Faculty have pointed to tensions that
arise out of social and cultural differences among the participants in
classes and seminars. Faculty need
access toresources that enable them
to recognize such tensions, to understand their sources and to develop successful strategies for defusing their negative effect on an
atmosphere of learning. For two
years a grant from the Hewlett
Foundation funded a half-time person in the Provost's Office to work
with Faculty on this area. Planning
for the future needs to include ways
to follow-up on this initiative.
Attention to the specific challenges created by growing diversity in the student body raised our
awareness of a general need for
better communication between
Faculty and students regarding the
quality ofinstruction and the magnitude of demands made in the
classroom. In preliminary discussions, students voiced the concern
that the quantity of work demanded
may threaten care and quality of
thought and writing. Some Faculty
believe that the perceived stress
results, at least in part, from increased participation in extracurricular activities. Various sources
and remedies for stress are likely
to be an important focus of planning in the StudentLife area, coordinated by theDean. However, we
recommend that our academic
planning include an assessment of
how much work Faculty actually
ask of students, and if necessary,
development of guidelines about
appropriate workloads. We also
believe that creation ofmechanism
for regular feedback from students
to Faculty about instruction should
be given serious consideration.
Such mechanisms have the potential to ease classroom burdens for
students and Faculty alike.
Better distribution of students
across departments would produce
a better balance in Faculty
workload. In the preliminary discussions and in CEP's own deliberations, several pathways were
suggested that appear well worth
exploration. Changes in the current system for assigning Faculty
advisors could introduce students
earlier to fields they do not encounter in secondary school. Current ways ofresponding to overly
enrolled courses also exacerbate
the discrepancies in distribution of
students. It might be possible to
moderate slightly our pattern of
adding class sections in response
to demand in order to encourage
students toward exploration ofless
familiar areas, certainly a strategy
consistent with the goals of liberal
arts education.
The greater difficulty of connecting teaching to research should
be addressed in part by planning
for changes in the leave system

(discussed below). It should also
be included in consideration of
teaching load and of the need for
mechanisms for innovation and
flexibility in the curriculum. The
possibility of bringing research
interests and teaching responsibilities into closer alignment would be
much greater, for example, if a
Faculty member were able to count
on having one course out offive on
a topic of her or his own choosing.
During the planning discussions,
students voiced the wish for more
opportunities for interaction with
Faculty outside the classroom. We
see joint student-faculty research
as the ideal vehicle for this in the
academic domain.Planning should
specify ways to support studentFaculty research, with particular
attention to the needs of the new
Honors program, and to the Division of Humanities where funds to
support such research are not now
available.
Leaves have long been
viewed by Faculty as the most important support for their scholarship, and, indirectly, as very significant support for their ability to
remain vital and effective teachers.
We propose that leaves be a topic
for planning, with the following
questions as a starting point. What
additional funds are needed to provide adequate leave support in a
context of decreased availability
of external funds? Should leaves
become a more direct form of support for teaching, for example
through expansion of the number
of funded leaves available for curricular projects? Would a moreflexible structure for leaves provide
better support for scholarship and
teaching? For example, for some
members of the Faculty an ongoing reduced load might be more
useful than a one semester leave
every four years and others might
benefit more from guaranteed two
semester funding for leaves that
occur less frequently than every
fourth year. Would the transition
into the role of teacher-scholar be
better supported by a guaranteed
two-semester "junior leave" in the
fourth yearforall tenure-track Faculty? Would chairing a department
seem less threatening to scholarship if chairs were guaranteed a
funded second semester after five
years of chairing?
Other questions about leaves derive from the broad concern about
curricular flexibility. For some departments, leave replacement has
been a useful way to bring new
perspectives into their offerings.
In others, however, leave replacements normally teach in the same
areas as the Faculty they replace.
Given the difficulties posed for
students by the constant cycling in
and out of leave replacements, and
the burdens imposed on departments by, in some cases, almost
continuous searches, it willalso be
important to assess the potential
impact on innovation and flexibility in the curriculum of staffing
more departments for leave. Also,
if other ways are found to ensure
the innovation and flexibility
viewed as optimal, then the role of
leave replacement might be correspondingly diminished.
Senior Faculty. The foreshortened focus of institutional attention on Faculty during the first
14 years of their careers at
Swarthmore was pointed out frequently in the discussions about
teaching and scholarship. Once a
Faculty member is promoted to
Professor, there is no further formal mechanism for review of that
person's satisfaction or effectiveness. A format for review and planning meetings with seniorFaculty,
perhaps timed to coincide with
every other leave and therefore
occurring every 8 years, would offer an occasion to discuss possible
interest in "re-tooling" for a shift of
research and/or teaching areas, and
ways institutional support might
be provided; any need to address
problems in teaching and strategies for doing that; and, eventually, plans for retirement, in some
cases including a transitional stage
of teaching part-time. The CEP
believes that such reviews should,
and could be designed to have great
value to both the individual and the
College. For the individual Faculty member they should provide
opportunities to obtain institutional
support for changing interests in
teaching and research and to explore possible new roles in the
College via committees or special
assignments. Such reviews should
also help Faculty members to make
—

thoughtful plans about retirement
well in advance of the time they
choose to retire. For the College,
such review and planning with senior Faculty should bring benefits
reciprocal to those for individuals.
Teaching effectiveness and general Faculty satisfaction should be
enhanced and thoughtful long-term
planning about eventual replacement of retired Faculty would become possible.
Even less institutional attention
has been directed to the question of
how best to define the relationship
between Swarthmore and our
emeriti professors. Planning should
include attention to what resources
should be available to emeriti and
to ways those who wish it can be
more closely integrated into the
College community. Should more
office space by available? Should
retiring Faculty be offered the option of buying the computer on
their desk and a service contract to
maintain it? Some retired Faculty
teach on a course by course basis
and some do special advising work
with students interested in a particular area such as law. Should we
explore additional opportunities for
this kind of engagement of emeriti
with students?
Planning should take a longer,
and fuller, view of the career of a
Faculty member at the College,
including the role of professor
emeritus.

Committee work is described as a major obstacle to effective performance of the role of
teacher-scholar. Beginning with the
reforms proposed in the "Red
Book" in the late 1960'5, Faculty
have taken on an increasing administrative responsibility through
the committee system. CEP recommends that Faculty participation in committees be reviewed
with the goal ofreducing demands
on Faculty while preserving an
adequate Faculty voice in the governance ofthe College. We believe
that the COFP, in cooperation with
staff and students, should conduct
a "zero-based" review of committee structure to identify areas in
which faculty participation is essential and to determine the minimum number of faculty needed,
with appropriate adjustments to
staff and student participation as
well.
Supervision of student
work outside of scheduled
classes is another significant
source of pressure on Faculty. In
all cases except that of the one
Department with a required thesis,
Faculty responsibility for directed
readings, attachments, theses and
independent research is not counted
as part of the teaching load. The
recent revisions of the Honors programhighlighted the value that both
students and Faculty place on independent student work and in our
own discussions we identified this
as a "Swarthmore experience" we
want to encourage. Especially because of the role of independent
work in many Honors programs,
we recommend that a more accurate and equitable system be created to account for supervision of
student work outside of scheduled
classes.

4. Honors. The Curriculum Committee is continuing its work with
departments on the implementation of the new program. Craig
Williamson will coordinate the efforts not only to put in place the
new procedures needed for current
classes, butalso to create a plan for
bringing the costs of the new program, now funded by grants and
donors, into the ongoing College
budget.
5. Diversity: Diversity has been
identified by the College Planning
Committee for several years as a
major topic for planning. In the fall
of 1994 the CPC created a Task
Force on Diversity, which made
six major recommendations in
May, 1995. Four of these directly
concern the academic area: implement training and aid forFaculty re
classroom diversity issues; reinvigorate efforts to hire more culturally diverse Faculty; support the
Tri-College Faculty group
ALANA; and improve academic
support for differently-prepared
students.
The current long-range planning
effort should move forward to define specific steps, and their associated costs, for carrying out these
recommendations.
6. Size of the College: Size of the

College was the focus of reports
produced at the request of President David Fraser by the Strategic
Planning Committee created in
1990. The sub-group of this Committee chaired by Rob Hollister
explored the gains and losses which
mightresult froman increase of 15
to 20% in the size of the student
body. This group concluded that
an increase of 200 students would
be financially feasible, taking into
account theadditional expenditures
that would be needed to provide
the academic program and other
services needed by a larger student
body and assuming a slightincrease
in student-Faculty ratio. [Note: this
has varied between 9.5:1 and 8.5:1
over the last ten years.] At that
time, the Admissions Office also
carried out a study which suggested
that the quality of the student body
could be maintained with a larger
number of students. The Hollister
report made clear that its goal was
to lay out parameters for a discussion of enlarging the student body,
and to indicate that the sub-committee believed that "future Strategic Planning efforts should give
further consideration to this possibility", but not to provide a detailed plan for doing so. It emphasized that very careful planning
would be necessary in particular in
the area of allocation of additional
Faculty positions to balance the
requirements of current programs
that would be faced with additional
students with the benefits ofinnovation in other areas ofthe curriculum.
In 1994-95 the Board ofManagers asked a small group to investigate the possible need for the College to acquire additional land in
order to retain the possibility that
at some point in the future an increase in student body size might
be desired. This group, which included Board members, Faculty
and staff, concluded that the land
now owned by the College could
accommodate a student body of up
to 2000 without compromising
especially significant spaces such
as the Amphitheatre or losing the
green atmosphere of the campus.
These previous efforts support
the feasibility ofincreasing the studentbody from financial and physical points of view. Neither offers a
detailed plan, including transition
costs and specific proposals for
addition ofcurricular programs and
Faculty, which would permit reasoned decisions about the ultimate
positives and negatives of bringing a larger number students to
Swarthmore.
We believe that the current longrange planning requires evaluation
of such a carefully developed proposal for increasing the student
body. The curricular improvements
likely to be proposed elsewhere in
the plan are highly unlikely to be
possible without a larger number
of students, and information needs
to be available to make possible an
evaluation of proposed improvements to our educational program
in the context of the costs and
benefits of a larger number of students.

IV. Organization of
Planning
We see CEP as the Faculty group
appropriately responsible for much
of the planning proposed, specifically the topics that are directly
related to the Curriculum. The topics that concern Faculty workload
and leaves we suggest should be
addressed by the Division Chairs.
Development of a new procedure
for allocation ofFaculty positions
falls in the province of the COFP,
and we believe that a group of
senior Faculty who have previously served on the CPT should
take the lead in creating a format
for review and planning with Faculty in the years after promotion to
Professor. Planning about the
overarching topics of diversity,
technology and the size ofthe College should proceed through Faculty participation in College-wide
planning groups defined by College Planning Committee.
Part of the responsibility of the
CEP should be careful coordination of work on all topics in the
academic area so that the extensive consultation with Faculty required can be done as efficiently as
possible. We also emphasize the
importance of regular communication with members of the Faculty, through channels such as Faculty lunches and Faculty meetings,
as plans develop.
