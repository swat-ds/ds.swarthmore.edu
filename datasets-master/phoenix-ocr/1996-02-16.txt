Chang-Muy to Resign
By Phoenix staff

Effective at the end of this semester, Fernando Chang-Muy has resigned his position as Assistant Dean
and Director of theIntercultural Center to return to immigration law and
other humanitarian work. Fernando
currently has three options for future
work.
He will either go back to working
for the United Nations in Geneva,
work for a non-government organization which helps physicians to con-

tribute their expertise to the service
of human rights, or work with a refugee organization.
"Discussing human rights issues in
my course this semester has made me
recall my former work withrefugees
and has made me miss that work
tremendously. I am appreciative of
the opportunity to work in a great
institution like Swarthmore. I really
do hope that I have beenable to make
a contribution to student life...[and] I
hope that I havebeen able to contribute to the knowledge base on human

commented

Chang-Muy.
Dean Ngina Lythcott commented,
"Fernando's leaving will be a major
loss for S warthmore. Because of his
generosity and willingness to consult
with faculty, staff, and students on
immigration issues it will not be a
surprise to any of us what his real
passion is. Not only will we miss his

significant contributions as Assistant
Dean and Director of the Intercultural Center, but we will also miss his
contributions as coordinator of student activities.
"In both positions, Fernando facilitated important relationships between and among students and between students and staff. He also
brought to Swarthmore a wealth of
cultural programs and created a lasting infrastructure that will continue
to serve us well. Although Fernando
will be greatly missed, I wish him
well in his future endeavors."
President Bloom added, "I am very
disappointed that Fernando is leaving. He has played an important role
in making Swarthmore a finer institution and I know he will have an
impact of significance in whatever
endeavor he undertakes."
Fernando developed an infrastructure in the Intercultural Center and a
full set of interesting programs and
activities both for groups within the
IC and members of College community not within IC. He will be greatly
missed by many students.
Laura Christian, LBGA coordinator, said, "Fernando has done a lot to
make the IC more accessible as a
resource center, to bring in exciting
events and speakers, and to foster
communication among the different
groups housed there. He totally cares

Williamson also hopes that the positive changes to the registration process can be integrated into the new
school computer system that will be
introduced within the next threeyears.
"I think that registration has been
utter hell for the past few years," said
Jodi Furr '97, "and anything they can
do to improve it would be welcome."
"I think that the changes are good,"
said Matt Halpem '9B. "The registration process has gotten a littleabsurd.
People would only preregister for
classes that they thought would be
lotteried, which was pretty disruptive. I'm in favor of more computerization- most major universities have
it, so why shouldn't we?"
There is also an additional provision that has been added for students
who plan to study abroad, and allow
them to have a faculty advisor register as a proxy. This may eventually be
coordinated through the Foreign
Study Office, and Williamson said
that there shouldn't be any problems
as long as the student has some way
of contacting his or her advisor.

youths.
Somehave concerns about the ramifications of the law, such as the cur-

makes providing indecent materials
to minors a crime.

Consider what the act defines as
worthy of possible jail time andfines:

Senator Exon (D-NE) attached an
amendment to the Telecommunications Reform bill, the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which

Some works which fall under this

As the rest of the world accesses

Although Heidi was in high school before
any current Swarthmore students were born,
the saga of her life rings so poignantly true
that many members of the audience were
brought to tears. The emotion in the play
affected even the performers; during Saturday night's show, several of the main characters appeared to be crying, overcome with the
strength of the message. The power of
Wasserstein's story and Fricke's performance
(among others) managed to reach out and
grab the audience so tightly that, during the
last few scenes, the crowd was completely
silent.
Throughout her life, Heidi faces the challenge of determining who she should be as a
woman. At a high school dance in the 1960's
she refuses to carry on the same antics her
friend Susan Johnston, played by Zara
Zimbardo '9B, does in order to attract boys.
Heidi manages to find happiness despite her
refusal to roll up her skirt above her knees
when she meets Peter Patrone, played by
Scott Friesen '96. After a marriage proposal,
Peter and Heidi settle for a life-long friend-

and made it into an excellent production last Friday and Saturday in the Lang
Performing Arts Center.
The Swarthmore drama board's production played three times, two evening performances and one matinee, to nearly full capacity.
Wendy Wasserstein wrote the original
script, whichfollows the main character, Heidi
Holland, played by Anna Fricke '9B, from
high school to middle-age. In particular, the
play examines feminism and how it affects
Heidi's life as she struggles with relationships, success, homosexuality, AIDS and,
above all else, personal happiness and fulfill-

Susan serves as a contrast to Heidi throughout the play. Susan finds herself as an em-

powered feminist lesbian while Heidi permits herself to be trapped in a destructive
relationship with journalist/lawyer/
entreprenuer/scumbag Scoop Rosenbaum,
played by Brantley Bryant '99.
At a 1970's scene at a women's rap session
Heidi becomes empowered by the love that
the other woman offer her; a level of
supporti veness which shehas sought throughout her life. "Either you shave your legs or
you don't," Fran, Susan's significant other,
played by a hilarious Vanessa Carter '99,
tells Heidi.
The feminist that Heidi becomes is the
same feminist that Susan abandons later in
the play. Susan becomes a television producer hired to appeal to the female viewing
audience of her generation and, in the process, marginalize the achievements of feminists. In one scene, she asks Heidi to be a
consultant for a new show about women her
age in art and what they have done wrong as
well as right. Susan describes the idea as,
"three women, turning thirty in a large urban
center...say, a way out painter, an uptight
curator and a dilitante heiress in a loft."
The serious nature of the play is sprinkled
with achingly funny lines like this one, that
not only make you laugh, but also prove a
point. The character of Denise, played by
Andrea Meller '99, serves as one of the major
forms of comic relief.

the release ofher first, self-titled,
album in 1990, Ani Difranco has be
come a cult phenomenon. Her concert
at the Keswick Theater last Saturday was a
gathering of the faithful.
The sold-out audience, predominantly female, whistled and cheered and sang along
with every song, wildly applauding each chorus ofDifranco's feminist anthems, bringing
her back on stage for no less than three
encores. It was a jubilant, ecstatic, sweatdrenched evening. And it was probably the
best concert that I've ever seen.
Backed by the astonishing musicianship of
long-time drummer, Andy Stochansky, and
new bassist, Sarah Lee, Difranco took the
stage, plugged in her acoustic guitar, and tore
into it with clip-on nails.

The result was everything that rock n' roll
is supposed to be, and so rarely is: passionate,
playful, pissed-off, innovative, and, most of
all, loud. Difranco's lyrics—urgently personal, addressing bisexuality and feminism,
abortion and injustice, love and loss—fit into
fairly traditional folk song molds, albeit with
a refreshing punch.
But her music—jagged, propulsive, by turns
delicate and funky, always gripping—kicks
with stunning power. Even her ballads, melodic and contemplative, are a far cry from
wimpiness, certainly not soft (unlike, say,
folk songs written by the Indigo Girls' Emily
Saliers). Every element ofher performance is
suffused with confidence and self-assurance.
In the course of a two-and-a-half hour
concert, Difranco ripped through most of
1994's Out of Range and 1995's Not A Pretty
Girl,playing versions of her songs that were
louder, funkier, and faster than theirrecorded
counterparts.
The anthemic title songs of those two albums rang with clarion force, while more
personal songs, like "Shy" and "Face Up and
Sing," had the audience pogoing in theaisles.

"32 Flavors" was almost excruciatingly beautiful. A song from her new album, set to be
released in May, was stunning in its rage.
Throughout, Difranco's voice, despite a mild
case of laryngitis, was in fine form—swooping, gasping, soaring, handing off the high
notes to the women in the front row. Her
guitar playing was, as expected, muscular
and fierce.
Halfway through the second encore, the
signature "Both Hands," Difranco invited a
woman from the audience up on stage to sing
the song with her. By the last verse, the
woman was singing solo while Difranco retired into the wings with her guitar.
At any other concert, this kind of gesture
would be cheesy, rock star gratuity. But an
Ani Difranco concert is not any other concert,
and the moment was perfect, and perfectly
genuine, a lot like Difranco herself. I've seen
her in concert three times now, and she keeps
getting better. Fiercely independent,
unapologetically opinionated, and utterly
herself, Ani Difranco showsup the packaged,
processed pablum thatpasses for mainstream
rock n' roll. She puts on one hell of a show.

cannot achieve their level of happiness.

Though "Heidi Chronicles" reaches no real
conclusion about feminism and women, there
is a sense of hope at the end of the play. Heidi
has achieved healthierrelationships with both
Scoop andPeter. More importantly, she seems
to have improved her relationship with herself. There is a level of acceptance and selfsatisfaction in the final scene that creates a
feeling of comfort. Heidi has achieved success on her own terms and a sense of trust in
what thefuture will hold for her newly adopted
baby daughter.
If you missed this incredible production, at
least read the script—women and men will
both be greatly rewarded.

3 sons, two in their twenties
andonejn high school. I do as
much as I can to spend as much
time as possible with them.
They're all very different, so
being with all three of them,
you're on your toes all the time.
As for hobbies, I am a big baseball fan and I like ice hockey.
And, of course, reading.

Q: Did you attend college?

A: I did spend one year at St.

Joseph's University, butl never

graduated. I was an English

major.

Q: If you could attend Swarth-

more, would you continue to

major in English?
A: I'd stick with English. Definitely.

Q: How do you view the Swarth-

more College students?
A: The best.. .and lam not saying
that because I work here. Because I see them everyday, I
get to talk to them quite a bit.
I've also spoken with students
from other colleges in the area.
There's no comparison.

Q: How do you feel about the

infamous red carpet?
A: It's supposed to give the appearance of being bright and
cheery, but I don't look at it
that way. I see it as an "eyesore." I don'tparticularly care
for the carpet, but I have no say
in that matter.

Q: What would it take to persuade
you to allow an honors reserve

item you' ve seen insomeone's

bag?
A:The weirdest item ever that I
have seen was melted ice
cream. We had a student, last
year, that bought ice cream on
her lunch hour. About seven
or eight hours later, she had
forgotten the ice cream was
there and when she went to
open her bag, the ice cream
had melted in the bottom of
her bag. All ofher books were
completely covered in melted
ice cream.

Q:Are there any particularly

funny stories that stand out
over your tenure as a bag
checking?
A:You get to know the students
over a period of time. You get
to know the little idiosyncracies that each one of them
has.So what might be funny to
another student,is not funny to
that one. Each student has
something funny about them
whether the other students
understand it or not.
I would also like to bring up
the point of the "faces in the
wall." Yes, they're in thewall.
You may thinkI am going nuts
when I say this, but I am not.
(At this point, Ben got up
from his desk and walked to
the three windows that face
the main entrance. Below the
middle window, on the righthand side, Ben pointed to a
"face in the wall." Sitting at
the desk, the image eventually
was clear to me. There are
"faces in the walls" of
McCabe.)

Q: Any closing comments?

A: I think the administration here
is great. They do a really good
job of selecting the students
who are accepted to Swarthmore. And I commend them
for that. And as for my
job...This job helps you realize that we are all flesh and
blood, people have hearts and
brains. You have to treat
people as people, not as peers
or superiors, but as a person.

"Winning at badminton requires

Chen's drops are the team's "secret weapon," according to her partner, Johansen, whose own smashes
are feared throughout the conference
(and by the teammates who practice
against her). Johansenactually broke
three racquets in three days last week.
Both Chen and Johansen love playing for Swat, and enjoy the camaraderie among teammates.
"We're not playing to get the
glory," explained Chen. "Since badminton is the least acknowledged
sport in Swarthmore's athletic program, the players are definitely playing because they enjoy it." Chen and
Johansen also enjoy the successful
season Swarthmore is experiencing.

Club V-Ball Opens Season

Have you been wondering about
that whole "mascot thing"?
Have you oryourfriends been commenting lately on the fact that nothing seems to have come from that
flurry of voting and discussion about
a mascot last semester?
Well, here is the newest mascot
update, hot off the presses.
The results of the last poll were
ambiguous in that no individual mascot received more votes than the
choice of "no mascot." The committee for selectinga mascot, headed by
Barbara Ryan, associate vice presidentfor external affairs, felt it would
be unwise to accept the results of the
first vote, given this ambiguity.
Because of this, there will be a
second round of mascot voting. This
time, however, theballoting approach
will be more precise.
The first question will be, "Do you
want a mascot for Swarthmore, yes
or no?" Then, "If yes, which would
you prefer, The Garnet Foxes or The
Little Quakers?"
The Foxes and Little Quakers re-

ceived the highest percentage ofvotes
in the last round of voting.
In the last election, the alumni office received over 1,300 votes from
students, faculty, and alumni. Among
those who voted, about one third rejected the idea of a mascot entirely.
Many positive, humorous and sarcastic comments were also returned
to the alumni office.
It seems that the very idea of a
mascot for Swarthmore has generated discussion in addition to quite a
bit ofmedia attention across thecountry—there was even a small article in
a Texas newspaper.

Losses to Dickinson, Muhlenberg quell Garnet playoff hopes

S warthmore's position in the conference was reinforced Tuesday night in
the Tarble Pavilion. Swarthmore
hoped to win at least two rematches
of narrow Saturday losses since they
needed to defeat Albright in order to
reclaim a share of the lead in the
conference championship race.
The match, however, repeated itself
as another 4-1 loss for Swarthmore.
Once again, the lone win was at second doubles, as Gorman and Smith

Hanging onto a thin hope of making the playoffs, the men's basketball
team traveled to Dickinson College
Saturday to try to extend their twogame winning streak. Unfortunately,
they were unable to continue the winning trend as the Devils managed a
three-point victory.
The Garnet trailed 37-34 at halftime despite connecting on 45 percent of their shots, well above their
season average. However, the Devils
proved they were up to the challenge
and responded by shooting a solid 50
percent from the field. Both teams
continued to shoot well throughout
the second half.
It is difficult to pinpoint a breakdown in the Garnet's effort. The team
hit 45 percent of its shots for the
game, out-rebounded the Devils,
matched them in steals, outscored
them off-the-bench, and more than
doubled their assists.
With just 3:34 left in the game, the
Garnetclung to a 63-60 lead. In these
critical threeminutes the Garnet were
unable to score despite numerous
chances. The Devils were only able
to put up six points, but it was enough
to cap a 66-63 victory.

moreexciting matches of the evening.
Rounding out the fearsome threesome was Alec Stall '97, who cut
some weight to make it down to the

Alec pummeled his opponent in the
opening round, but came out flat in

the second round and lost the match.
However, the loss apparently ignited

taking third place.

On Tuesday, the GarnetTide played

came into the game with a 17-6 record.

eight points, 35-27.
The Lady Garnet came out fired up
again in die second half and closed
the deficit to two points. But a few

picked up the tempo and became extremely aggressive. They attacked the
ball and dominated the floor. They
quickly increased their lead and held

score was 80-51.
Again, Rosenbaum and Houseal
led the team in scoring with 14points
each and Rosenbaum also was the top
rebounder with 10boards. This was a
hard loss, but the Swat women were
