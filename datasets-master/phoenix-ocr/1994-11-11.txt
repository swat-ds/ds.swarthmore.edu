Hunger And Homelessness Week
Will Soon Challenge Swarthmore
By Lisa Hibler

Over 600 campuses nationwideare
participating in the Hunger and
Homelessness week activities next
week. The objective of the week is to
raise awareness about therealities of
hunger and homeleessness in America
and to raise funds for those fighting
against these realities.
This is the first year that
Swarthmore has participated in a
week-long discussion of theseissues.
The result is an unprecedented number of events on campus as well as
opportunities to speak with a wide
variety of front-line fighters and organizers in the war against poverty.
The taskforce organizing the events
on campus hopes that the speakers,
movies, displays and service opportunities of next week will provide
students with new ideas as well as
initiatives to take action against the
injustices of poverty. The week is
organized to bring the College community together in discourse around
a common issue. The success of the
week will depend upon the participationand enthusiasmof theentire community.
Week-long events include a clothing drive organized by SHIP (Serving the Homeless In Philadelphia)
and Delta Upsilon, a display in the

Bookstore centered around the hunger/homeless/poverty theme, an information and display board in
Parrish, and Penny Wars among the
classes in Parrish Parlors. SHIP,
CCIP (Chester CommunityImprovement Project) and other campus organizations will have tables with information on how students can become active.
Wednesday is Break the Media
Blackout Day dedicated to breaking
through the blinders in the media to
present the economic, social and
medical realities of poverty. The
most important aspect of thisand the
following two days is the opportunity to speak with people fighting
against poverty who have themselves
experienced being poor, homeless
and hungry.
On Wednesday at 4 pm in Kirby
Lecture Hall, a TAKEOVER documentary will be shownwhich traces
a national effort by homeless organizations to take over vacant federally-owned housing. This will be
followed by a lecture by a member
of the National Union of the Homeless which will trace the growing
motion of the poor to fight for their
own survival and meet their basic
needs. On Wednesday and Thursday, students will have the opportunity to give up a meal at the Sharpies

Dining Hall and donate their meal
credit to Ox-Fam. Already a large
number of students have signed up to
give away one or more of theirmeals.
On Thursday night, there will be a
Sleep-A-Thon on Parrish Beach, organized with the joint objectives of
raising money, experiencing a night
outside, and creating a spectacle that
will raise consciousness on campus.
Johanna Peters-Burton '97, one of the
student coordinators, said that their
goal is not to try and parallel the
experience of homelessness, but instead to bring students together in an
unusual way that will attract attention, create a space and time for dialogue, and raise money. Poor women
from the Kensington Welfare Rights
Union will be coming to speak with
students on the lawn Thursday night
to answer questions and present their
own experiences.
In an effort to bring closure to the
week, an all-campus collection will
be held in the Friends Meeting House
from 4 to 6 pm on Friday. There will
be a panel discussion presenting perspectives from service providers, student leaders fighting against poverty,
and poor people organizing to meet
their own needs. The discussion will
be followed by a question andanswer

Latin America Will Be Examined at Conference
By Amy Albert
On Friday and Saturday of this week, the
Hewlett Tri-College Fund will be sponsoring a
conference entitled "Globalization and Resistance in Latin America."
"The conference has been designed to provide students and faculty with a chance to hear
from people deeply immersed in Latin American realities," said Professor Aurora Camacho
de Schmidt, one of the conference organizers.
Speakers from around the Delaware valley will
attend, including both professors such as
Michael Allen of Bryn Mawr College and activists such as Luisa Maria Rivera Izabal, an
economic development consultant.
The conference will focus on the responses
ofLatin Americannations and grassroots organizations within those nations to post ColdWar
demands for change within government struc-

tares. Participants will also discuss the ideathat

as \
"Whatpossibilities are

"How do popular movements
express the search for autonomy in

Why Only 2

College Considers Improvements in
Program of Employee Child Care

Swatties
Participate
in ROTC

By Elizabeth Weber

By Thanh Hoang and Erik
Huneke
Out of the more than 1300 students
enrolled at Swarthmore, only two,
Derek Johnson '96 and Megan
Hallam '97, participate in the Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC). As in the past, these students must enroll in chapters of the
program at nearby institutions. Registrar Jane Mullins cannot recall any
time in its history that "this College

has ever had an ROTC unit."
According to Johnson, ROTC is a
"training program of the Armed
Forces which gives military training
to cadets while they are attending
college so that they would have the
educational and militarybackground
to be commissioned as SecondLieutenant as soon as they graduate from
college." It serves as an alternative to
going to a military academy.
Director of Financial Aid Laura
Talbot remarked, "In my 17 years at
the College there have been about 10
students who, while full-time students at Swarthmore, completed
ROTC training requirements at Penn,
St. Joseph's or Villanova. Those requirements include military history
as well as rigorous physical training
and weapon experience—all rather
foreign to the Swarthmore curriculum."
Talbotreflected further, "Whyonly
10 students? Perhaps it is the Quaker
heritage or perhaps it is our distance
from the training schools." According to Dean of Admissions Carl
Wartenburg, prospective students
typically do not express interest in
joining the ROTC program.
Swarthmore's comprehensive financial aid program usually makes such
tuition supplements unnecessary,
which Talbot considers to be "the
greatest reason [for not joining
ROTC]." She commented further,
"Since we meet students' financial
needs, they are not dependent on the
ROTC support. Students who attend
other schools where financial aid is
quite limited are likely to find that
ROTC is the only way to make ends
meet." Recent cutbacks in the military budget have further restricted

the funds available for scholarships.
Thus, Swarthmore students who
wish to participate have always done
so in the Air Force chapter at St.

Joseph's University and the Navy
chapter at the University of Pennsylvania, the latterof which will soon be
eliminated. Mullins recalls a female
student in the ROTC program who
transferred here from St. Joseph's
University. Before she could do so,
however, the institutions developed
the Cross-Town Agreement, in which
Swarthmore wouldnot allow the student to transfer her academic credits,
so she graduated with two transcripts
of her college-level education.
Johnson, an electrical engineering
major, first became interested in
ROTC during the Persian Gulf War
at the end of his junior year in high
school. Although his father was in
the Army during the Vietnam War,
Johnson joined the pro?r?rr o f his
own accord. Since the ideaof serving
his country and learning self-discipline and teamwork appealed to him,
he started to investigate the prospect
of joining the military, even though
he "wanted to get a liberal arts education before joining the military."
Johnson discovered that ROTC was
willing to pay the full tuition for his
four years in college in return for his
service once he graduated. He applied to the Air Force ROTC program and was accepted.
Like Johnson, Hallam's interest in
the military was her own, although
all of her father's family was in the
military. She also decided to attend a
liberal arts college instead of a military academy. As a compromise, she

On Wednesday, November 9, the
Day Care Committee brought a proposal for the College to assist its
employees with child care before the
College Planning Committee. Although no decision was reached, the
planning committee will continue to
discuss the proposal, and a survey of
employees' interest in college-sponsored day care will be taken over the
next few weeks.
The proposal involves a jointventure program with Trinity Cooperative Day Nursery, which is located in
but not affiliated with Trinity Episcopal Church, across the street from
Worth dormitory. Many college employees currently enroll their children in day care at Trinity, but the
center is full, with a waiting list for
places. Also, Trinity cannot currently
care for children less than a year old.
The Day Care Committee's pro-

posal involves the construction of a

second building for Trinity,
which would expand the number of

College than the creation of an entirely new day care center.
Although this is not the first time
that the issue of child care has come
before the planning committee, the
proposal is very preliminary. Only if
the planning committee decides to
allocate funds to this joint venture
with Trinity would itchoose a site for
the facility and make detailed plans.
What makes this proposal different from the previous proposals for
the College to sponsor day care for
the children of employees is the idea
that a College day care center would
"enhance community building," explained Vice President Bill Spock, a
member of the Day Care committee.
Subsidizing the cost of child-care to
lower-paid employees would "make

Housing Committee Decides Joint Tenancy, Other Policies
By Laura Gitelson

The Housing Committee met for the last time
this semester on Monday, November 7. Topics
discussed in recent meetings include joint occupancy, picking rooms by proxy, non-smoking and quiet halls, and gender restrictions on
roommates.

The committeere-affirmedits policy of designating non-smoking and quiet halls and recommended that one entire wing of Willets be
made non-smoking to accommodate the large
demand for these rooms by first-year students.
It was decided thathalls which are not initially
restricted are free to vote for smoking and noise
restrictions at their first hall meetings of the
year, but enforcement is less strict in such a
situation.
After some discussion, the committee also
reaffirmed the rule that residents of multiple
occupant rooms and rooms sharing bathrooms
must all be of the

same sex.
The committee also redefined the rules about
joint tenancy for students who are planning to
be away during one semester and choose to
"share" a room with one or more students who
are going to be away the other semester. Joint
tenant agreements help students going on leave
to organize their housing before departing and
permit roommates who are staying behind to
live with roommates of their own choosing.
Joint tenants will select aroom with the lottery

going on leave may form joint tenancy agreements—this is not a way to change rooms at

Swarthmore Station and Swarthmore Avenue.
Itis all part of a $29.5 million project for the
R3 line, which runs from 30th Street Station to
Elwyn and carries about 8000 passengers on an
average weekday, a SEPTA spokeswoman said.
Once the workis complete, the trains will be
able to increase their speeds to 60 m.p.h. from
the current 45 m.p.h., which could shorten
commutes by several minutes, said project
manager John Dixon. The job is nearly 80
percent complete, Dixon said.
At times, buses are operating in place of
trains because of the project..
The train line arrived in Media in the 1850s,

there were 50 trains a day using the track, Lees
said. One track went to West Chester, and

average age of the student body was somewhat
higher because a third ofit consisted of military
veterans. In Mullins' opinion, the school's size
has now nearly reached the limitbefore changes
in "character" will occur. With more students,
class sizes would grow and a higher percentage
of students would have to live off campus,
Mullins asserted.
Mullins' fondest memories of her undergraduate years at Swarthmore include making
close friends and attending concerts and

women's sporting events. As a history major,
Mullins did not enjoy fulfilling science distribution requirements. "I did not like Physics,"
she said. Anothernot-so-fondmemory is of the
food, which she insisted was worse than it is
now because many foods were difficult to obtain right after World War 11.
Whenasked whetherherview ofSwarthmore
is different as an administrator than it was as a
student, she responded, "I'm just grown up."
Mullins thinks the main difference is that as an
"adult" employee, she has responsibilities and
interests outside of the College.
Mullins' parting advice to students is per-

haps an example of her sense of perspective:
she advises them to keep a sense of humor, to be
a bit less earnest, and to stop worrying so much.
As for her colleagues, she said/They'll do
fine." She hopes that the character of the College will not change, andfeels that in any event
such change is unlikely because "people don't
want it to change."
But Mullins' leaving is itself a major change
for Swarthmore. "Change is inevitable in the
lives ofboth individualsand institutions, "Gross
commented; "I am grateful for the legacy Jane
will leave me and all of us." Lythcott added that
"We rely on her skill, her experience, her wisdom, and her ability to pluck out ofher memory
and her files official policies, procedures, protocols, and practices of the College. I don't
know what we'll be without her."

my degree," says Hallam.
Once Johnson and Hallam graduate from either college or grad school,
they will be commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the Air Force.
Within sixty days of graduation, they
are guaranteed a job in their respective field of study. They are expected
to work for at least four years in the
Air Force to repay the military for
paying their college tuition.They will
receive benefits, such as medical inand homelessness in America not only
by those who make policy but by
those who have lived therealities of
it and are fighting against the myth
that they cannot and do not wish to
take action.

the College community. Sponsors include CIVIC, LOVE, Earthlust,
HOLA, the Intercultural Center,
Ruach, the Office of the Deans and
the Forum for Free Speech as well as
the Departments of Economics, English, Political Science, Education,

JPeters-Burton '97 and Kristin Waugh
'97 to coordinate the week.

On November 8, the Department of Public
Safety sent a bulletin to all students reporting
that two women had been arrested the previous
evening in the Lamb MillerFieldhouse. "They
were subsequently charged with a variety of
offenses," said the bulletin, "most stemming
from the use of a stolen credit card which was
used at the King of Prussia Mall. At the time of
the arrest, they were found wandering through
the locker rooms of the facility." Further information on the case shows thatit involves criminal activity.
The two women were
first seen in the locker
room watching students

Director of Public Safety Owen Redgrave
said that Harris was operating technical equipment for the Haunted House when he tripped
and fell approximately ten feet from the platform to the floor. Harris was taken by ambulance to the Chester-Crozier Medical Center,
where he was kept overnight for observation.
According to Redgrave, Harris has not returned
to work yet, but will soon. Redgrave said of
Harris' condition, "Basically, he is just sore."
The annual Haunted House was co-sponsored by Swarthmore Public Safety and the
Parkside Fire Company. It is the only event
held in the Old Tarble building, which is normally used for storage. Redgrave said,

The Salvadoran civil war was one
of the most bloody and divisive conflicts in modern history. Among the
casualties of this twelve year dispute
were six Jesuitpries ts and two women
who were killed at the University of
Central America in San Salvador on
November 16,1989. We commemorate these educators and religious
leaders on the fifth anniversary of
their tragic death.
The civil war in El Salvador grew
out of a political and social structure
controlled by a small group of wealthy
families and a series of repressive
military regimes. Groups calling for
political modernization, civilian government, respect for human rights,
and greater social equality grew increasingly desperate through the Seventies as they realized they wouldnot
be allowed any political voice. In
1980, five offshoots of political parties came together to form the
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front
(FMLN) and chose to combat a system they could not change. Due to
cold war fears of spreading global
communism, the United States immediately took a position supporting
the Government of El Salvador, providing millions of dollars of economic and military aid to defeat the
FMLN and blocking eflocking efforts at negotiating a peaceful resolution.
As early as 1980numerous people,
including the Archbishop ofSan Sal-

The internationalreaction to thisviolent assault on human rights, free
speech, and academic freedom was
one of several factors that led the
United States Congress to severely
question its support of the Salva-

tions, including "disappearances,"
rural massacres and politically-moti-

doran government and to place limitations on aid. With the fighting at a
standstill, leaders from both sides
managed to agree on a series ofU.N.brokered Peace Accords in 1992, fi-

thousands of people, left approximately one million displaced refugees and pitted Salvadorans against

each other-all in a country about the
size of Maryland.
In the midst of this dangerously
polarized social climate the Jesuit
professors of the University of Central America continued their academic
work of researching, writing and
teaching about their visions for a just
and peaceful future for El Salvador.
To their upper-middle class students
they advocated taking the viewpoint
of the poor and applying the concepts
of liberation theology to Sal vador an
reality, demanding social change in
the context of creating a more Christian society on Earth. Their views led
them to criticize many of the policies
of the existing government, by whom
they were perceived to be the spiritual and intellectual leaders of the
revolutioon. On November 16,1989
an elite U.S.- trained Salvadoran military battalion broke into the living
quarters of six priests and shot them.

Joaquin Ldpez y Lopez, Ignacio

and inspiration for academics and
free thinkers around the world-including in seemingly distant
Swarthmore-to do the same. The
attempt to eliminate concepts by destroying those who articulate them
presents a profound attack on all of
us who express our human potential
through our ideas. We invite the entire Swarthmore community to demonstrate our appreciation, respect, and
support of critical social thinking by
commemorating the fifth anniversary
of the deaths of the Jesuits of the
University ofCentral America. This
assassination is an assault on allof us
who seek freedom and peace, and we
come together to recognize the profound loss of not only the lives of
these eight innocent people, but of a
quest for justice.

Hope for Democrats
Wofford: "This was our time to lose"
By Maria Lin

On Tuesday, November 8, Senator Harris Woff ord lost by one percent of the votes to Congressman
Rick Santorvun in the race for the
U.S.Senate seat inPennsylvania. The
Democrats inPennsylvania also suffered losses for the Governor's seat
and House seats. Across the country
Democrats felt the sting of discontented voters as crucial seats were
lost one by one in the largest midterm
election slide in modern political history.

One positive thing that may come
these huge Democratic losses
is that now, as the minority party in
both houses, theDemocrats will need
to stick together. If in the long run
these defeats mean a stronger Democratic party that will work together
better, perhaps Tuesday night was
the beginning of something bigger in
party history.
Thanks to all of you who worked
hard and committed yourselves to
the Wof ford and Nichols campaigns.
Whether it was worth it is up to you
to decide.I think we did a lot of good:
we worked for what we believed in,
and thatmuch we gave to American

politics.
There is still definitely something
we can do. We can watch the Republicans like hawks in Congress. Sara
Nichols has already shown that she
will do this-Curt Weldon will have
to watch his step. And we can monitor Santorum's every move. He is
now answerable to us, his constituents. We will write letters, make
phone calls, do whatever it takes to
make sure he does not misrepresent

us. We will make it difficultfor him
slip anything by. With only 49
percentofthe state behind him, thisis
no large victory for him to work with.
Forty-eight percent of the voters in
Pennsylvania are with us.
Please find the time over the next
semester to be involved in these efforts. College Democrats will have

And to all heartbroken Democrats
like myself, I'll refer to Harris
Wofford's concession speech when
he said with dignity, "For everything
there is a season...there is a time to
win, and a time to lose. This was our
time to lose."
The tide will turn. We can make it

Taking A Closer Look at Swat's Civil Liberties Society
By Tamar Cherry

impromptus to dormitories, forbids

The CivilLiberties Society is currently reviewing the College's policies and practices and proposing revisions based on principles of freedom ofexpression, dueprocess, equal
protection, and privacy.
"We want to assure a continued
respect for civil liberties on campus
by drawing attention to any potentially dangerous areas," said Kevin
Keenan '95, president of the club.
Because "Swarthmore is generally
good about balancing rights with communityneeds," he continued, theCLS
wishes to suggest improvements in
areas which may have been overlooked.The CLS committee oncampus issues has identifiedthree"trouble
spots" which they plan to pursue.
The first area involves the new
alcohol policy and specifically the
new $lO fee for impromptu parties.
Currently, the policy restricts

more than 25 people attending, and
requires two 21 year olds to take
responsibility for any problems that
arise. According to Keenan and the
committee, "The policy is sufficiently
prohibitive without the $lO charge.
Besides, impromptus have not posed
significantpublic safety problems. It
seems ironic, given that our Student
Councilhas concerned itself with enhancing the social life on campus."
In response to this, Assistant Dean
Fernando Chang-Muy supports the
fee as a means by which Student
Council can exert influence over locationand timing of impromptu parties. "The $lO [fee] was not instituted
as a punitive measure," he said, "but
rather as a way to help Student Council coordinate and help make social
activities more of a community and
cooperative venture." In addition,
Assistant Dean Tedd Goundiepointed
out many ways in which the fee has

caused a decrease in the size and
number of parties which in reality
often "Were not truly 'spur of the
moment', as the policy was intended
to address." He also pointed out that

Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave also supports the measure.
He said, "With all the possible serious consequences associated with irresponsible drinking, I believe it is
prudent to pursue a course that minimizes suchrisks for both individuals,
student organizations,
and
Swarthmore College."
The second area the club plans to
investigate is the removal of certain
private informationfrom the Finger
command on Eudora and Raptor. As
it is now, a person can find out when
someone last checked his or her email. On Raptor, itis possible to find
out from where they checked or are
checking. Keenan expressed alarm
that while this is useful for doublechecking e-mail, it enables others to
know when and from where it is
being checked. This is a violation of
privacy, he said.
In response, Mary Hasbrouck,
Manager of Academic Computing,

The completed
report...will address
issues of technological privacy,
search and seizure
of dorm rooms, and
the judicial process.
this money is used to supplement the
pay of the Public Safety employees,
who have to take extra time to register the parties.

said that the Finger command "reflects an atmosphere of open exchange of information on which a
college like Swarthmore is based."
This issue is actually controlled by
the Swarthmore College Computing
Society, which owns Raptor and
makes all policy decisions about it.
Both sides are willing to work together, so that limitations in the
amount of information displayed and
the extent of Finger access may be
enacted.
Finally, on the grounds of equal
treatment, the Civil Liberties Society
has decided to oppose altogether the
prohibition on co-ed rooming.
"Whereas homosexual couples can
and do room together (a right we
support)," said Keenan, "brother and
sister cannot, husband and wife cannot, a 3-year heterosexual couple cannot. Two best friends of the opposite
sex who want to share a two-room
double with double entry cannot. It's
a throwback to 'so's paternalism."
Dean of Housing Myrt Westphal
and the Housing Committee responded that co-ed rooming will not
be allowed. They have considered
this possibility in the past, and identified many points on which such a
policy would be disagreeable. These
include impact on potential students,
parents, and alumni, as well as the
effect upon students living on thehall
with the couple. Furthermore, "since
students may live off campus after
their first year, and since we do not
do room checks about who is visiting
in which rooms we felt that there was
plenty of opportunity for students to
gather in each others' rooms," said
Westphal.
The completed report, which
should be finished by the end of the
semester, will also address issues of
technological privacy, search and
seizure of dorm rooms, and the judicialprocess. Chang-Muy praised this
undertaking, saying, "I greatly admire the hard work of the Civil Liberties Society...and look forward to
their program activities for next semester."

We are writing in response to the
"Agony Aunts" column that appeared
last Friday. While describing the
drug scene at Swarthmore, the authors made the following observation about alcohol: "Women— avoid
booze in all forms, including drunk
and frisky men. Men—don'tbe dicks
when you drink, or we will personally come to your room and beat the
shit out of you." We found this
generalization highly inappropriate.
We would like everyone to understand that we know that "Agony
Aunts" is a tongue-in-cheek column.
It's usually very funny.
However, this quote went too far.
Joking about rape and rapists is not
funny. We think this quote presents
the following stereotype: all men,
when they drink, are rapists. All
women are potential victims.
Clearly, sexual assault while under the influence is a horrible crime.
But generalizing about the issue to
include all men as potential perpetrators is not only untrue but also very
hurtful and counterproductive.

Chili Stew
There is something about
working all day in crumbling earth
that makes you hungry.
There is something about a sky
big enough for tomorrow
that sets dreams into a mad stomping.
There is something about
an adobe house
that makes a white picket fence
look wrong in front of it,
No right angles, I suppose.
"What's a low-rider?, she asked
And I had to laugh.
Not an unreasonable question,
but it's like asking,

Proposition 187
On.Tues. Nov 8, California voters approved Proposition 187. This bill would

deny almost all social services, including public education, to illegal immigrants. It would force social service providers,

including educators, to turn in
suspected illegal immigrants, who would then face the possibility of deportation. Although Canadians constitute a large number of illegal immigrants in
California, we can assume that with current attitudes towardracial minorities
and the inner-city, most of those likely to be affected are Latinos and Asians,
even those who are legal but fail to carry papers.

By Jessica McFarland
Some of Swarthmore's more creative stuseeking alternatives to commercial and

dents

organizational publications have recently

joined the underground world of zines.
Usually comprised of the work of a single
individual or small group, zines are photocopied versions of commercial magazines.
Most zines are student-produced and off-beat,
varying in length (some as short as four
pages), covering a broad range of issues and
utilizing various media.
Jean Chen, a Swarthmore sophomore who
has produced two issues of her zine Big Nurse
in the past year, said, 'Trying to describe zines
is like trying to describe magazines...they are
all different." Chen's Big Nurse was started as
a skateboarding interest zine but, by its second
issue, became devoted to such topics as Spam
and professional wrestling. The benefits of
creating her own publication include not having to worry about censorship or copyright
violations, Chen said. The cover of her second
issue of Big Nurse clearly illustrates these liberties—it features the body of supermodel
Niki Taylor and a photograph of diet guru
Richard Simmons buried in vegetables.
Further, because she funds her own production,
she does not have to worry about finding or
appeasing advertisers to support her publication.
These advantages are not by any means
unknown to the rest of the world. While zines
are decidedly underground publications, the
zines produced by Swarthmore students are
among the more than 20,000 in publication
across the country. Seth Friedman, editor and
publisher of"Factsheet Five," a guide to about
1,500 of these publications, says that the mar-

BIG NURSE

ket for zines is growing by 20 percent every year. He says that zines
are created to explore issues that
can't be found in commercialmagazines. They therefore offer a unique opportunity for communication among individuals
dissatisfied with the current status of mass
media.
The historical roots of zines to some extent
explain the role that the underground publications play in American subculture today.
Zines, according to Friedman, developed from
1930's science-fiction fan magazines, 1940's
and 50's Beat Generation poetry publications,
and 1970's rock band fan magazines. Now,
says Christina Kelly, editor of Sassy magazine, zines come mostly from "small, out-ofthe-way places where young people probably
have fewer outlets for entertainment."
Because zines vary so greatly in origin,
they also vary substantially in form and
purpose. Some zines like The Other Press,
an international topics zine produced at
Gustavus Adolphus College in
■&&
Minnesota, function as alternative news
sources. Others are poetry journals, music
reviews, or feminist literature publications.
However, most zines are fan magazines,
devoted totally to following the lives and
careers of various performers. There is a
zine that honors U2, one that gives a voice
to fans of Fabio, and one that follows
the life and times of Barney the
Dinosaur.

ished college students. To begin a zine, one
only needs a concept, access to a copy
machine, and subscribers. Most zines sell for
between one and two dollars, and some have

even turned profits for their publishers.
Strangely, it is often more difficult to subscribe to a zine than to begin one. Because of
the highly personal and somewhat alternative
nature of the zine trend, the process of tracking
down a publisher whose interests are similar to
yours may be a complicated one. Listed below

Frankenstein
Well, I'm probably about to blow any shred of credibility I have. I loved

Kenneth Branagh's versionof Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. It is huge, I mean
gigantic. Everything is large. The sets are these great dark things that scare the
viewer as much as the horrorof the story does. The outdoor shots are sweeping affairs that cover mountainranges. There are talented actors and actresses
by thehandful And, De Niro is a beast Literally.
Branagh plays the mother/father/scientist, Victor Frankenstein. Blonde
locks flowing, he pursues the creation, and later destruction, of the monster
with the vigor of the crazed. Helena Bonham Carter plays his sister/wife,
Elizabeth. Robert De Niro plays the monster. The other stars worth mentioning are Tom Huke as Henry, Aidan Quinn as Captain Walton, and an unrecognizable John Cleese as Waldman, the professor who first attempted
Frankenstein's experiments.
The story stays very true to Shelley's classic tale of a man who gives birth to a monstrous child. There is one very notable
departure, however, when Branagh reanimates his dead wife. This departure is not
necessary for the film to makes its point
about how monstrous Victor is, but it doesn't detract from the film either. In fact, it is
the most dynamically gruesome scene in the whole film.
De Niro's range certainly was not challenged in this movie, but he still
played the part of the monster beautifully. He gave the beast a quiet dignity that
was balanced against by the violence ofhis physical actions. This dignity is
what allowsFrankenstein to be perceived as human only when De Niro says,
"He was my father"; the rest of the movie, we only see how horrible Branagh's
possessed character is.
Ifyou can deal with freneticcamera movement, lotsa blood, and superb acting, you'll love this flick. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is definitely, "high on

The War
The new Kevin Costner movie is actually an Elijah Wood film.
Unfortunately, even he can't save itIt's called The War, and itfelt like a tour
of duty to sit through it
I wish I had some idea of what it was about, but it meandered through so
many storylines that it was impossible to decide the theme of the movie.
Costner, in a small supporting role, plays a man who has just returned from
Vietnam and is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. His family is poor and
struggling to survive in the poor rural south. Elijah Wood, in a top-billed role,
plays Costner's son who is struggling to enjoy the summer out of the way of
die local bullies, the Lrpnickes, a cruel family that defines poor-white-trash.
I think that the story is about Wood and his sister and all their friends trying
to learn thatthere is something good in all people, even die lipnickes, even the
Viet Cong as long as you try to find it The climax of the movie centers around
a battlefor the gargantuan-sized treehouse Wood built. The lipnickes show up
with an arsenal of firecrackers and Molotov cocktails to take it from them.
Wood and his friends fight back with a wasp's nest and relics of Costner's
from Vietnam. We're supposed to see this war as a reenactment of what
Costner just went through in Vietnam, and here the kids are supposed to learn
the same lessons that Costner did overseas.
The problem with TheWar is thatthere's too much—too many storylines.
We see Costner and the pain ofhis return, Wood and his friends trying to learn
about understanding, equal rights issues, sexism poverty, etc. There's too
much for a coherent film to form. TheWar "just don't dig on swine." (1)

However, this little bit of unsavory
manipulation is nothing
compared to what goes
on in the second half of
the film, in which Alex, imprisoned for
murder, is subjected to a series of gruesome, totalitarian techniques to
"reform" him. But these techniques also
take away his ability to appreciate the
music of "Ludwig Van", the only thing
Alex has ever loved besides cracking
people's skulls.

Football
The Swarthmore Football team lost to
Western Maryland 34-13 on Saturday in a
sloppy,penalty filled game. The loss dropped
the Garnet Tide to 3-4 in the Centennial
Conference and 3-6 overall, dashing any
hopes for a winning season.
The GreenTerrors madeseveralbig plays,
including a blocked punt for a touchdown
early in the game to give them a 28-3 first
quarter lead. The GarnetTide came together
in the second quarter, outplaying Western
Maryland the rest of the way. Unfortunately, they could never mount any real
effort to get back into thegame. Swarthmore
eaded the game with 14 penalties; yellow
flags seemed to stop any Garnet attempt.
The bright spot on offensefor Swarthmore
was running back Dave Reeser '95. Reeser
gained 138 yards on 30 carries to make the
Conference Honor Roleand become the first
Swarthmore back to ever gain more than
2,000 yards in his career. Eric Williams '95
once again turned in a solid defensive effort,
making the Honor Role for his ten tackle,
one fumble recovery performance.
Swarthmore ends the season this Saturday
in a non-league game at home against Washington and Lee.

Women's Rugby
The Women Ruggers finished their seawith an impressive performance against
the University of Delaware in the Eastern
Pennsylvania Rugby Union playoffs. Earlier in the season, Delaware crushed
Swarthmore. In this match-up, however,
Swarthmore gaveDelaware areal fight, scoring twice something very few teams have
done this season. The score was 26-10 at the
end of the match, a large improvement over
the 41-0 of previous game against the University of Delaware. Despite losing the last
game of their season, the team kept a positive attitude. Princeton eventually crushed
Delaware in the final round of playoffs,
going on to finish first in the EPRU this
season. These women ruggers ended their
season with a 3-0 record in conference games.
Although Swarthmore has completed the
regular season, several members of the team
are currently preparing for the annual Sevens Tournament that is held in Central Park
after Thanksgiving. Approximately ten players will travel to New York, along with
several players from the men's team, to
participate in the tournament.

side as the inside center. Inside center is an
important role in the back line; not only
does Barnett have a key role in offensive
plays, she is also expected to make the first
tackle when the opposing offense has the
ball. Barnett scored the first try in the
women's playoff loss to University of
Deleware, 26-10. She has also contributed
two other trys in the previous week which
gave Swat the victory they needed for playoffs.
"Andrea takes every hitand goes out hard

Mike Madden '95, is the Forward Captain of the Men's Rugby Team.
After playing hookerfor thepast three years,
Madden moved to the position of eight man
in the forward pack this season. "The change
allowed me to expand and open up a great
deal. The eight man is not as restictive and
has given me a chance to do whatI do best."
"We compensate for our size with our
intelligence," said Madden. The Buzzard's
are a self-coached team. "We [as captains]
are self-motivated to help motivate the team
and this has led to much success, especially
in the spring season. I've alwaysparticularily

points respectively.
Even though the team lost three starters to
graduation, there is an abundance of talent in
the backcourt and much promise among the
younger frontcourt players. Co-captain Craig
Rodner '96 and Colin Convey '97 will direct
the Swat attack at the guard position. "Craig
and Colin could be the best pair of point guards
we have had in my nine years at Swarthmore,"
saidCoachLee Wimberly. Jay Rose '95, oneof
theteam'smostversatileplayers, and Jim Foley
'95 return at the off-guard position and are

consistent and solid play at both ends of the
floor at the off-guard spot this year if we are to
be successful," said Coach Wimberly.
The frontcourt will rely on the play of cocaptain Kirk Daulerio '95 who was among the
Centennial Conferenceleaders in scoring (15.0
points per game) and rebounding (7.8 ppg).
Also returning at forward is ChadTarr '95 who
played impressively in summer league. Aaron
Bond '97 will likely start at center and looks to
build off his impressive play at the end of last
season when he had "double-doubles" against
conference rivals Muhlenberg and Washington.

Swat still has a very young team and a
juniors and sophomores will be
fighting for playing time in the frontcourt. Ben
Schall '97 and Sam Voolich '96 will contend
for the forward position and Voolich may see
time at center along with John Delatush '9B.
Jeff Greeson '97 and A.J. Shanley '97 are
working hard to recover from knee problems
and were important contributors when they
were healthy last season.

Swarming Spartans Bandits Buzzards Garnet Quakers?

I think I know why so few Swatties

They simply don'tknow how to cheer.
The novelty of yelling "Go Swat!"
wore off years ago, and let's face it,
we'rejust too civilized to hurl insults
at the opposing team. We'd never
pick a fight with our least favorite
Haverford point guard. This is
Swaaaathmore (add your own
haughty New England accent).
One of thereasons we don'tknow
how to cheer is that many teams don't
have mascots. There does not seem
to be a single mascot for Swarthmore
athletic teams, although many are
either Garnet, loosely affiliated with
Garnet, or without one. Of course,
there are those teams who have simply come up with their own mascots
to fit the personalities of their team.
The Evil Buzzard Rugby Cult, aka
'Zards, was formed a decade ago
when the ruggers were scrounging
around New Orleans withlittle money
while on a road trip. The name has
grown on the team who have subsequently named their field the Buzzard Dome. Some even claim buzzard sightings before matches.
"[Rugby is] a violent, crazy sport.

I can picture buzzards circling the
field ready to pick up anyone who's
slow off the pitch," said co-captain
Mike Madden '95. Although fellow
captain Darin Friess '95 feels the
significance of the mascot may be
starting to fade because no one really
knows the real story of its origin, he
feels itis still appropriate: "Buzzards
are sort of nasty animals, [they are]
very, very smelly, kind of hang out in
flocks, and are obnoxious birds..J
think it kind of fits our team."
Maybe you've heard of the Bandits? The name originated with the
1991 Men's Tennis team, the most
recent Swarthmore team to win the
Division HI National Championship.
Though they were obviously a great
team, they were a little on the renegade side. "They would go to banquets where all the other teams wore
jackets, in shorts, tee-shirts, and with
theirWalkmans," saidChris Pearson
'95, who was a freshman on the 1991

known as the Swarming Earthworms,
Swarm or Worms for short, since
about 1980.C0-captainMattßobison
'96 is unsure of the origin of Swarming, but Earthworms is one of the
many anagrams (combinations of the
letters in Swarthmore) that the team
has come up with over the years. The

"We have some rituals centered

we all yell 'swarm' as the disc is in

yet," he added.
The wrestling team has long
been known as the Men of
Sparta and have paintings of
Greek wrestlers on the walls of
their practice room. "Sparta is
more than simply a bad-ass
name. It had a great wrestling
tradition," explained Eric Williams '95.
Williams is an advocate of
individuality. "It's sort of fun.
Our wrestling team in high
school used to have a different
name each week," he said, "it's perfectly fine for different teams to have
different names."
The Garnet is the "mascot" for
many S warthmore teams. But what is

a garnet? It's a common aluminum or
calcium silicate mineral. It's also a
dark to very dark shade of red. In
nautical terms, it's a tackle for hoisting light cargo. How can it be that our
mascot is an inanimate object? Does
this pose a problem?
"I like it [Garnet] because it's not
trite. Swat athletics aren't typical so
it's appropriate and refreshing to have
something unique," said Fernanda
Gonzalez '9B. "A garnet is something precious, valued, and to be
strived for," addedRaven Lipmanson
'9B. However, not everyone is in favor of the Garnet. "You can't really
rally behind a garnet," said Wendy
Williams '97.

"I have to admit that I'm partial to
the football adaptation [Garnet Tide]
because you can make good cheers
like 'Roll Tide, Roll,'" said Jon
Githens-Mazer '97.
It seems unlikely thatS warthmore
will ever return to the mascot of the
past, the Little "Fighting" Quakers.
Why don'twe just call ourselves the
Swarming Spartan Bandit Buzzard
Garnet Quakers? That way we could
cover all the bases. You can't go
wrongrooting for the SwarmingSpartan Bandit Buzzard Garnet Quakers,
no matter which sport you're sup-

porting.
