Community Reacts To
Cavallari's Death

Gabriel James Cavallari (1975-1995)

By Phil Specter
Swarthmore College students, staff and
faculty began trying to pick up the pieces
after the tragic death Wednesday afternoon of Gabriel Cavallari '97. The College came together as a community to

begin coping with the abrupt and devas-

Gabriel Cavallari was found dead of an apparent suicide in the Crum woods late Wednesday afternoon. Cavallari was a person who always had time for
otherpeople and was always ready to take on theirproblems. Those who met him even once would have a hard timeforgetting him. His intense brown
eyes, long hair, beautiful grin, and ever-present smoke, trench coat, and hat made a deep impression upon all who met him. He always made people feel
that he was happy to see them. His demeanor was at once intense, but also very caring, thoughtful, sensitive, and mellow. Dean Ngina Lythcott said in a
letter to the College community, "It seemed obvious that Gabe's friends think of him as the kind ofperson who could be anyone's friend."As a junior
majoring in Biology, Cavallari was particularly interested in unraveling the workings of the human mind; he was also very deeply invested in pondering the
philosophy of the meaning oflife. Cavallari worked as a Safewalker, in McCabe, as a shuttle driver, and called upon his mathematical skills to tutor
children through CIVIC. He was described as the ultimate Safewalker, prepared to walk anybody to any place at any time. Cavallari is survived by his
beloved parents, his two younger brothers Matt and Jamie, and by so many others who cared.

tating loss of Cavallari, only the second
on-campus suicide to occur at Swarthmore in the last 20 years.
The healing process began almost immediately when the administrationorganized a special meeting Wednesday night
at 7:30 PM in the Admissions Office for
students and faculty who wished to talk
about what Gabemeant to them, or simply be withloved ones and fellow mourners in a time of need. In the words of
Dean of the College Ngina Lythcott, the
collection of students was meant to be
"less an information session than a time
when we can hold onto one another. It's
a time when we can be together." Over
200 students, staff, and faculty members
attended the gathering, with members of
theSwarthmore College communityoverflowing into the hallways and Parrish
Parlors to pay theirrespects and to mourn.
Lythcott opened the meeting by providing some details about Gabe's life, as
well as the circumstances surrounding
his death. After a few minutesof silence,
students began rising, and many started
relating theirpersonal memories and recollections of Gabe's life. One student
read from a personal notebook his
thoughts written immediately following
his discovery of Cavallari's death, while
another student told a touching anecdote

of Gabe's life on his farm. The meeting
continued in this manner for more than
two hours, withfriends consoling mourners, and loved ones describing what made
Gabe special and loved by many.
The administration took further steps
Wednesday night to ease the pain of the
College's abrupt loss when Psychological Services sent out an E-mail offering
its help on a "walk-in basis" from 12:30
to 4:30 PM Thursday afternoon for anyone who needed to talk to a counselor,
either individually or in a group setting.
The Health Services Lobby was also offered as an informal meeting place for
those who needed "a place to meet and
talk."
Lythcott also sent an E-mail to faculty
members Wednesday night advising them
that students may need time off from
work to deal with their loss. Because
some students asked Lythcott for "temporary respites" from assignments, she
noted that some of the faculty members
"may wish to postpone tests or extend
due dates of papers." Thursday afternoon, she sent a letter to the college
community discussing the tragedy, and
advising the college community thatPsychological Services, Religious Advisors,
and members of the Dean's Office were
available to those finding themselves in
need of "support... comfort, and understanding."
Relating not only the opinions ofothers, but also her own personal memories
of Gabe, Lythcott noted that"Gabe was a
person who felt and thought very deeply.
As one student said, he was a great guy
who touched us all. We will miss Gabe."

Woolman Incident Highlights Persistent Racism on Swarthmore Campus
By Ben Maulbeck

Therehas been a dialogue among residents of Woolman concerning an incident that occurred earlier this year, in
which campus security was called because a "suspicious black person" was
standing outside the building. The person turned out to be a Swarthmore student waiting for a shuttle.
The student, a senior, had been visiting several friends near Woolman. At
around 1:50 a.m. he went outside to wait
for the 1:55 shuttle. However, before the
shuttle arrived, a Swarthmore campus
security car slowly pulled up beside him
and rolled down die window.
The student toldthe officerhe was just
waiting for theshuttle.The car thenpulled
into the Woolman lot, turnedaround, and
left. Apparently a call had been made to
security saying that a "suspicious black
man" was standing outside Woolman.
The student involvedsaid, "Obviously,
black students around Woolman are
looked upon with great scrutiny...l was
standing there with a book bag on my
shoulders. And what if I was just walking, visiting with my friends? Do I need

to have an ID with me at all times...What
does that say about Swarthmore? I expect that at other places... but at a school

years, I expect better. I have no regrets
whatsoever about coming to Swarthmore—l've enjoyed every minute of
it..But I don't expect to be treated like
some outside criminal. It's dehumanizing to be treated like, 'You're nothing.
Why are you here?'"
The identity of the student who made
the call is unknown, although it is assumed to be a Woolman resident, since
campus security was called instead of the
Swarthmore police.
Rebeccah Bennett '96, a friend of the
questioned student and a Woolman resident, called the problem to the attention
of Woolman RA, Emily Walker '96. In
an effort to deal with the situation,
Bennett, the student involved, and two
others brought the issueup at a Woolman
study break.
Walker said, "When I heard that ithad
happened, I was really upset and frustrated that that could happen here in this
community, and that most likely it had
been somebody from this dorm who had

called security." Walkeralso commented
that the Woolman residents seemed to
show regret for what had happened and
largely seemed to be apologetic.
Bennett, a coordinatorofinformal discussion groups on race issues, said, "I
thought they responded appropriately—they seemed to be shocked, to be concerned, in some ways to be apologetic.
They seemed to show genuine care and
concern. People were a tad bit uncomfortable, but mostly they were surprised
that something like that could happen."
The actual student involved, however,
seemed to feel less positively about the
residents' reactions: "Of course, no one
ever faced up or laid claims to what they
did. But no one said anything. No one
came to apologize."
Bennett commented, "Theirintentions
aren't to be malicious, but the conditioning that we've allhad says thatwhat you
thinkof as suspicious or violentis largely

Gallucci Returns to Swat
By Jason Zengerle
While the demise of the Soviet Union
and the cessation of the Cold War might
have marked an end to the bi-polar international structure and the high-stakes
ideological contest that dominatednearly
half of the twentieth century, Ambassador at Large Robert J. Gallucci, senior
State Department official, maintained in
a lecture at Swarthmore this past Tuesday that the nature of the international
system has remained fundamentally unaltered. Gallucci admitted the increased
difficulty in defining American vital interests, but he argued that those interests,
despite recent unsettling developments
in international politics, have remained
unchanged at the core.
Visiting the College where he taught
for a brief time before entering government service nearly twenty-five years
ago, Gallucci spent his day attending a
political scienceclassand seminar, lunching with students interested in careers in
government, and delivering his lecture
before a modest crowd of faculty members and students assembled in Bond.
In his talk, Gallucci outlined American security interests in Europe, Japan,
the Middle East, and Latin America. He
also stressed the importance of maintaining good relations with Russia and ar-

gued for continued American assistance
in easing the burden of Russia's transition to democracy and a free market.
Gallucci cautioned that the post-Cold
War world still contains many dangers,
including a continued nuclear threat
which has diminished but not disappeared
with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Speaking of the dangers of nuclear proliferation, Galluccirelated his own experience in recent negotiations with North
Korea regarding its nuclear technology
program.
Assessing the international scene,
Gallucci was optimistic that the interdependence and ascendancy of economic
relations, the spread of democracy and
market economies, and thediminutionof
the nation state would allmake the use of
force a less viable currency in international politics.
Nevertheless, Galluccimaintainedthat
force was still an option inforeign policy
calculations, and he set forth the three
differentarguments for the use ofAmerican force in Iraq, Somalia, and Bosnia.
Presenting the Administration's justifications for the use of force in Bosnia,
Galluccinotedthathis day-trip to Swarthmore was a needed respite from the tediousBalkan peace talks taking place in
Dayton, Ohio, to which he planned to
return the next day.

Recently, students walking through
Parrish's hall have noticed a bevy of
posters advertising speakers on one particular topic: thedemand for theretrial or
release ofMumia Abu-Jamal, the Philadelphia journalist convicted of the 1981
murderofPolice Officer DanielFaulkner.
These speakers, for the most part, have
been sponsored by the Swarthmore Civil
Liberties Society (SCLS), whose members view Abu-Jamal's case, as Heather
Frank '9B puts it, "a model for so many
injustices in our judicial system."
According to Matt Van Itallie '9B, the
SCLS first became actively interested in
Abu-Jamal's case when it received nationwide attention this past August. On
June 5, Pennsylvania Governor Thomas
Ridge signed Abu-Jamal's death warrant; his execution was slated for August
17th, but a stay was granted.
Abu-Jamal currently resides on death
row at GreeneState Correctional Institution; his mostrecent request for a retrial
was denied. 'To me, it's not about his
guilt orhis innocence," wrote VanItallie.
"We must allow retrials and appeals in
capital cases if new evidence emerges or
if the initial trial had problems." SCLS
member Amy Dalton '9B added: "For
Mumia activists, what is relevant right
now is keeping [him] from being executed, and the fastest way to do this is to
work for and demand a new trial."
Most of the dispute over Abu-Jamal's
conviction stems from his trial for the
murder ofFaulkner. The presiding judge.
Judge Albert Sabo, had a reputation as a
"hanging judge" who favors the use of
the death penalty; moreover, as VanItallie
pointed out, he was "a prominent supporter of the police fraternal organization."
Since the trial, at least one new witness
has come forward in Abu-Jamal's de-

fense. Therehave also been disputes as to
The SCLS is not the only group interthe actual time and circumstances of the ested in Abu-Jamal' s defense. Numerous
murder and allegations of tampering with groups and celebrities have joined his
witnesses. According to Dalton, "Every cause, including prominent writers Wilwitness that gave a statement the night of liam Styron and E. L. Doctorow and

Since becoming actively involved in themselves in favor of his conviction,
Abu-Jamal's case, the SCLS has worked such as columnist Mike Royko, who wrote
hard to publicize his cause. "So far," said in The Chicago Tribune just beforeAbuMatt Neal '9B, coordinator of SCLS's Jamal's scheduled execution: "Here is

Poverty Awareness Week: An In-Depth Look
Many Organizations
Involved in Poverty
Week Activities
By Erik Huneke
The College has just finished celebrating Poverty Awareness Week in a
variety of events and speeches.
Kristin Waugh '97, an organizer,
described the events scheduled for the
Week as an attempt to "provide a fo-

rum for dialogue and/or action surrounding the issueof poverty." To this
end, she hoped to achieve four goals:
encourage a campus-wide effort, raise
awareness, promote fundraising, and
allow students to become active in combating poverty on a regular basis.
Aviva Arad '99 was responsible for
organizing the OXFAM fast on Tuesday, in whichstudents had the option to
donate their lunch and/or dinner meal
credit to hunger charities. Through this
effort, studentsraised $l2OO.
Amy Albert '9B coordinated a cam-

paign on the part of theFeminist Majority chapter at Swarthmore to raise
awareness about poverty which also
occurred on Tuesday.
Over thirty people attended the
Speak-Out held on Parrish Beach despite inclement weather.Economically
disadvantaged area residents, fellow
students, professors made presentations, complemented by musical and
theatrical performances. Waugh describes it as "an exciting and moving
event."
UriKo '97 of theSwarthmore Chris-

tian Fellowship organized the Penny
Wars in Parrish Parlors, in which members of the differentclasses compete to
put more pennies in their jug than in
those of other classes and more silver
coins (which countfor negativepoints)
in the jugs of other class years.
Food and clothing collected in this
week's drive will go to needy residents in the Philadelphia area according to Waugh. She also expressed her
support for the Students of Caribbean
Ancestry's ongoing drive for hurricane victims.

Swat Students Participate in Sleep-a-Thon
By Ben Fritz

A group of over fifty Swarthmore
students joined students from the University of Pennsylvania, Eastern,
Villanova, Bryn Mawr, and LaSalle to
spend Wednesday night in an abandoned church in North Philadelphia
where the Kensington Welfare Rights
Union (KWRU), an advocacy group
for the poor and homeless, has established a temporary residence. The night
was devoted to education and media
attention to help the homeless people
living in the church.
Students at the Sleep-a-Thon listened to stories from homeless people
living in thechurch abouthow they got
to where they are now and what the
system is doing for them. Currently,
the St. Edwards Church on Bth and
York in Kensington houses forty-five
families and that number increases
steadily. Prior to moving to the church
in September, many of the families
spent two months living in a vacant lot.
KWRU residents talked about how
difficult it is to find housing and how
the current welfare and homeless system does not work. They also pointed
out that there are currently more empty
houses in Philadelphia man there are
homeless people.
William Nessly '99 said he found it
"amazing how easily one can fall into
homelessness" after listening to sto-

ries of the people who live there. He
also felt that "it really makes you question the motivations that you have."
Wednesday was a particularly important day for the KWRU residents
because earlier in the day they were
served with a warrant ordering their
eviction. KWRU director, Cheri
Honkala, said she believes the only
reason they have not been kicked out
yet isbecause the police did not wantto
forcibly evict them with so many students around.
Honkala warned the visiting students
that legally they were all trespassing.
The major problem is that, if evicted,
the residents are not sure where they
would go. Entering shelters would inevitably split up many families.
Wednesday night was also "End the
Media Blackout" day forKWRU.They
invitedlocal stations to cover the events
of the night. Cameras fromChannels 6
and 10 news filmed some of the proceedings, including songs and
storytelling, and interviewed several
residents and students. KWRU hopes
that increasing awareness in the general public will put more pressure on
the city to provide them with decent
housing.
The idea of the Sleep-a-Thon was
conceived by Dan Clowes '97 and organized by Swarthmore's chapter of
"Empty the Shelters" to raise money
for and awareness of the homeless.

camping out at an abandoned church In Kensington Wednesday night.

Kramer said she sees no futureeither
in President Clinton or in the Republicans. "If you're talking about welfare
reform, you've got to be talking about
up and out of poverty now," she said.
"Clinton says that Medicare must be
replaced in the Republican bills. He is
ignoring AFDC. He is ignoring Medicaid. He is ignoring Food Stamps...We
need to flood Clinton with telegrams

"The 'moral majority' is not moral,

said. "California alone can produce

Colin Convey '97 asked where jobs
could be found for those without college degrees. Kramer mentionedChina,
where she recently attended the

China'scleanliness, and said thatmany
people could be put to work here to

Kramer was also asked about how
her movement hopes to reach the"apathetic majority of Americans." She replied that when she was attempting to
register people to vote in Louisiana
during the Civil Rights Movement,
"people didn't even know they had the
right to vote."
She said, "The news doesn't show
this movement happening. We need to
educate people. Everyone in the U .S.is

College Makes Web Rules
Outside Firm to Design Institutional Pages
By Erik Huneke

The College instituted new guidelines
for its presence on theWorld Wide Web.
Tom Krattenmaker, Director of Public
Relations, has worked with Eugene Klotz
Professor of Math and chair of the Com
puting Services Committee, to draftthesi
new guidelines.
The guidelines have several goals:to
ensure that electronic communications
contribute positively to the College's
image; to keep information up-to-date,
accurate, and make sure it is not duplicated; and finally to have print and electronic communications meet the same
editorial and design standards.The guidelines also "emphasize a distinction between 'institutional' pages—those belonging to administrative offices, academic departments, etc.—and 'private'
pages created by individual students, faculty, staff members, or student organizations." Unlikeindividual student and faculty pages, the front page. Admissions

Departmental editors will lead construction and maintain individualpages.
Dominic Sagolla '96 suggested that student workers could be dispatched to departments by the Web Editor to help
these departmental editors.
The guidelines also state, "In the interest of visual coherency, departments
and offices are encouraged to use the
graphic elements employed on the College front page." Users will be able to
access individualpages through thoseof
student organizations and academic departments. If not officially sanctioned by
the College, individual pages are expected not to adopt the design scheme of

SC Debates Women
in the Right Charter
By Wendy Kemp
The Student Council debatedwhether
in according a charter to Women in the Right, a group for
women conservatives, at its Sunday,
November 5 meeting.
The discussion of the Women in the
Right charter sprung from discussion of
whether or to confirm the charterofBlack
Coffee, an all African American a
cappella group. Student Council discussed three primary concerns relating
to Women on the Right
The first issue was whether or not the
function of Women in the Right overlapped with thatof the Swarthmore Conservative Union (SCU).
According to Women in the Right
chairperson Sandra Schrauf '9B, membership in the two organizations often
fluctuates. "Some women are technically
in the SCU, but they go to Women in the
Right," she said. "Some change back and
forth from semester to semester. Some
women are in one, some in both."
Women in the Right came into existence primarily because women constituted a minority in SCU. Women in the
Right focuses on thepower of women—their ideas, ideology and how itrelates to
their lives. They discuss on-campus issues and general viewpoints of conservative women on suchissues as thefeminization of welfare.
Comparing the two groups, Schrauf
said, "They're different. Women in the
Right is for women conservatives. Its
function and purpose is completely differentfrom the SCU.. Jdo not think they
overlap."
A second concern was whetherWomen
in the Right was chartered under improper procedure because of a sentence
in its charter restricting membership to
"conservative women." The group was
it had acted properly

granted acharter at the StudentCouncil' s
last meeting of 1994-1995. As avotehad
been put on hold for many weeks, some
members wanted to give Women in the
Right theirdecision before theend of the
year. "The vote was somewhat rushed,"
Charter Chair Laura Kozek '97 said.
Women in the Right are already working to change the sentence in dispute.
According to Schrauf, itis actually to the
advantage of the organization to do so,
since some women expressed interest in
joining the group even though they were
not out-and-out conservatives. The revised sentence is expected to read thatthe
organization is open to "women who
identify themselves as conservative or as
interested in conservative views."
Finally, therewere concerns of whether
a support groupcan discriminate on ideological grounds even though some support groups discriminate based on gender
or ethnicity. If one organization is allowed to restrict membership to a certain
group of students, then it couldpave the
way for other groups.
This charter could set a precedent for
smaller groups competing for funds
stretched thin by an increasing number of
demands.
Student Council also turned to questions involving the power of Student
Council to change past decisions. "Next
week we will openfor discussionwhether
ideology should be part of the discrimination statement in a groups's charter.
We may ask Woman in the Right ifthey
would consider becoming a subcommittee of the SCU, but we would not force
them," Kozek said.
If the concerns addressed in the meeting are any indication, the workings of
the Student Council may be in for changes.
Meanwhile, Women in the Right are still
fighting a battle. "We are fighting to stay
alive," Schrauf said.

Assistant Professor of Political Science Meta Mendel-Reyes read at Borders Bookstore from her new book, Reclaiming Democracy: TheSixties inPolitics and Memory.
Mendel-Reyes' book is about the national memory of the sixties political
movements, and in particular participation in the civil rights movement.
Mendel-Reyes intends to remind
people that the sixties was a decade in
which, she says, "commitments to political and social justice were greater in
many Americans, an aspect of this period that is often forgotten."
Her book also notes that many of the

"I was excited about a multiracial approachbeing taken to activism. Proposition 187 was one of the first timespeople

said. She hopes that the activism will
continue.
"We can be inspired by thepeople who
stood up against injustice," MendelReyes said. "U.S. history, particularly
the sixties, is filledwith a whole series of
moments in which people have gotten

Housing Committee Holds Open Meeting
By Laura Gitelson
The Student Housing Committee held
its first open meeting to provide members of the college community with an
opportunity to voice concerns and ask
questions about the housing process on
Monday, November 6.
At the meeting, students expressed
concerns about the substance-free housing selection process, the penalties for

breaking block housing, the continued
lack of housing, and concerns about
who would be on the waiting list after
this year's housing lottery.
The Committee also addressed room

changes

at

the time of the December

lottery and continued conversations
about the tight housing situation. The

committee came to a consensus that they
would recommend that the process of
filing room change requests after the

December lottery be kept the same. The
committee felt that filing room change
requests before the December lottery
wouldpenalize returning students by limiting the quality of rooms from which
they were allowed to choose.
Director of Residential Life, Myrt
Westphal, reported that the deans were
currently discussing the issue ofunhoused
students. They are considering a plan to
guarantee housing to all students and

perhaps renting a block of rooms offcampus in which to house the overflow.
None of these plans are definite, however. The committee and the deans will
continue to discuss the issues and to
solicit student opinion on the issue.
The Student Housing Committee will
meet once more this semester to continue
the discussion of unhoused students and
to begin discussion on otherroom-selection issues.

OPINIONS
Phoenix Editorial
College Web Page Policy Shortchanges Students
A few weeks ago, a Swarthmore studentseated
himself behind a public area computer to type a
paper. Upon completion of one pageof thepaper,
this studentdecided to take a study break and surf
the web. He opened Netscape and beforehis eyes
appeared a montage of a large red leaf imposed
over a shot of the leaf-covered McGill walkway
and Parrish. Stunned, the student had no idea that
the college had ever planned such a significant
change. Previously, theSwarthmoreCollege main
home-page had been a simple affair, with very
few graphics. Now web-surfers searching for
Swarthmore College will be greeted by a large
image-map of various leaves and acorns (the
graphic will reportedly change according to seasons).

Interested in the changes to Swarthmore's presence on theWorld Wide Web, we asked around to
find out which web-savvy student had been responsible for the changes. None, it turns out. The
College hired a professional graphics firm to
design the new page. Apparently, the school was
very eager to have a quality site created. Fair
enough, we thought These sentiments were not
those of other students. It did not take long for us
to discover that many in Swarthmore's web-publishing community felt snubbed by the
administration'sdecision to redesign the web site
without consulting the student body, especially a
studentbody so talented in the art of web-publishing. We at ThePhoenix decided that this was an
issue that called for more careful research, since
the idea of the school making an important decision without the students is disconcerting.
Before we proceed, it is important to establish
why this is an important issue at all. It goes
without saying that the World Wide Web is an
important new means of communication. More
and more people around the world are "surfing the
web," and it is quickly becoming the main method
of discovering informationabout various institutions, resources, and, of course, people. How the
college is reflected on the web is a vital issue
because so many new people will now be exposed
to Swarthmore College and will be able to find out
about our community here. The day has come
when many prospective students, in their search
for colleges, use the web for theirresearch. Therefore, how the school isreflected on the web affects
not only how millions around the world view the
college, but also prospective students, many of
whom will decide whether or not to give
Swarthmore a chance based on their impressions
of our web site.
How, why, and whendid Swarthmore decide to
revise their web-presence? It all began near the
end of second semester last year. A few representatives of the college were sentto a conference on
the World Wide Web and education. They came
away with the realization that cyberspace is a
vital, burgeoning medium through which some
important dissemination of information can take
place. Then these representatives surfed the web,
focusing primarily on the web presence of other
colleges and universities. What they saw shocked
them. The findings also shocked President Al
Bloom and other members of the administration
in an important presentation in which these representatives revealed their findings. In this presentation, the web sites of such schools as Yale were
compared with Swarthmore's. The difference in
quality was immediately apparent, and the president and others agreed that it was time for adrastic
change of Swarthmore's web site. A task force
was created, money was alloted, and instructions
were given to overhaul our web presence.
The students we interviewed inpreparation for
this editorial gave no objection to the decision to
change the web site. The enigma to them is why
they were not consulted. Swarthmore's student
web-publishers are numerous, diverse, and ex-

tremely talented. Justin Hall '96, for instance, is
perhaps one of the nation's most famous webpublishers, if his presence in magazines is any
indication. Yet it does not end there. Many
Swarthmore students are doing new and interesting things on the web all the time. Yet, not only
were they not incorporated into the process of
revising the new Swarthmore College web site,
but they were not even consulted for their opinions. One student in particular, Dominic Sagolla
'96, attended a meeting of the task force and
offered some suggestions, yet his presence was
not taken seriously and his suggestions not incorporated fully. After interviewing these students,
we were ready to print an editorial condemning
the school and its refusal to consult the students.
Then, however, we interviewed members of the
administration, and the waters were muddied considerably. Head of Public Relations Tom
Krattenmaker presented us with a somewhat different picture. The task force for revising
Swarthmore's web-page was created as an emergency measure. They were given very specific
instructions to design pages which looked professionaland had extensive links to the "Admissions
Office" all by November 8, in time for the period
directly preceding the early decision application
deadline. It is because of this time constraint that
students were not incorporated into the process.
We responded by suggesting that it betrays the
Swarthmore traditionand spirit not to incorporate
students in an important decision-making process. The administration's response was, essentially, that they wouldn't consult students on a
brochure about Swarthmore so why would they
consult them for this equally important public
relations item?
We raised some other student concerns with the
administration. Prominent among these is the design and structure of the new web page.While the
"front door" has links to "Admissions," "Alumni
and Parents," etc., it has no link to students. This
seems odd in a page designed for luring prospective students. If we were high-schoolers searching
for a college, we would be significantly more
interested in the students than their parents.
So, how does one get to thestudents? One must
click on "Campus Links." This page will pull up
four links, one of which is The Swarthmore College Computer Society, the site where one can
find the list of student homepages. No one except
a savvy member of the Swarthmore community
would realize this since there is no description
about the contentsof the link! The students stressed
that their main complaint with the new site is its
impersonal feel, primarily because of the lack of
links to, and descriptions and graphics of people at
Swarthmore. As Hall put it, "A college web site
should be a lounge where people can come, sit on
a sofa, and talk. Instead, we now have a counter
where people can come, take theirtechnical information, and walk aWay."
We subsequently brought up the issue of the
site's design with the administration. Their responses were also relatively persuasive. As webpublishers will realize, no single page is ever set
in stone.The administration emphasized the capability for change and the importance of student
input in that change. "Fine," we said, "then who
do we contact about making those changes? You
do realize that on all of Swarthmore's main pages
there is no way to contact anybody? Who would a
student talk to?" College web policy guidelines
have recently been released by the Computing
Services Committee.These guidelines call for a
"web editor-in-chief," one who can co-ordinate
and organize web activites among the official
levels of the Swarthmore web presence.
Here is where there are real problems and
where The Phoenix must begin to take issue.

affect some of us by reconnecting us with
the experience of other losses in our
lives.
Sometimes this can happen quite unexpectedly. When it does, it adds to the
emotional charge of the suicide. Another
difficulty that emerges after a suicide is
thatthose who have had thoughts of taking their own life, or who know someone

writing to offer my thoughts on
impact of the recent death on
our community, a death by suicide. Rather
than try to explain suicide I want to
address the issue of what can happen to
those connected to the person who commits suicide.
A suicide death can be a profoundly
disorganizing event for those touched by
it In a small community like ours, one
can be affected without ever having met
the man that died. Initial reactions are
often shock and disbelief. Sometimes
people feel numb. A sense of vulnerability can emerge along with the need to
make contact with others.
Typically we are left with many quesI

tions that cannot be answered. Despite

I knew Gabriel only by the secondhand smoke of his cigarettes, and when
we walked by each other this afternoon,
I did not give much importance to the
event. Later, when a reporter asked me if
I had a picture of the guy who committed
suicide, I did not even know what he was
talking about. It was only when a hall

The death of Gabriel is the closest
death that I have ever known. Both my
grandfathers died whenI was little, and I
did not understand the meaning fully.
Because I did not know Gabriel personally, his death did not make me sorry.
However, the logic, or rather the irrationality of this death baffled me. I could
not, and still cannot, understand why he
had to die.
When I came to the admissions office,
I found that many people had gathered

friend". Keep in mind that many people
have what could be called suicidal
thoughts. Many people go through times
in their lives where they ask "why go on",
"is life worth living", "might I be better

off dead", etc. It is critical to distinguish
the difference between having these
thoughts and acting on these thoughts. At
the point that one loses faith in her/his
ability to inhibit suicidal action, it is time
to seek help. The important thing is to be
talking with someone trusted.
Finally, one of the greatest challenges
after a suicide is the realization and acceptance of the fact that life goes on and
that it goes on in a very meaningful way
for most people. To hold on to one's
feelings for the deceased, whatever they
might be, while respecting one's desire
to experience all of life, is challenging
and important. As a member of this community, I found it helpful to hear the
comments offered in Parrish on Wednesday evening. Talking to family and colleagues has been helpful as well. Now is

Letters to the Editors
Coach Williams responds to field hockey team
To the Editors:

When I agreed to be interviewed by
you I was not clear if you had received
the enclosed statement from the Athletic
Department. I do believe that the enclosed statement will address most of
your questions. If not, please do not
hesitate to contact me.
Thank you for the opportunity to address our coaching situation in field
hockey. My position on this, as well as
that of the Department of Athletics, is
based on the simple proposition that fulltime appointments are better than parttime.
Full-time coaches have an inherent
advantage thatincreases theireducational
value; they are on campus all the time,
available to teach and guide students and
able to understand and interpret the culture of the school.
RichardKentwell workedunder a oneyear contract as a part-time coach. Our
Department currently has two full-time
coaching slots to fill and, to make thebest
use of those vital positions, we have

decided to move Karen Borbee out of
women's basketball into field hockey.
Karen is a full-time faculty member in
our Department.
With the new positions, allof our parttime coaches were advised that changes
would be made as the Department went
through the process of deciding how to
allocate resources. While we appreciate
the efforts and talents of our supporting
group of part-time coaches who make
significant contributions to the athletic
program at Swarthmore, this group always works under the assumption that
their position could be upgraded to fulltime.
Change in any form is difficult. I
appreciate the quality of Richard
Kentwell's coaching these past four seasons and empathize with those field
hockey players who are upset with this
coaching change. Yet I pledge to them
that we are moving in theright direction,
a direction that has the best interests of
field hockey and Swarthmore at heart.

of History 1 is gutless scholarship
To the Editors:
Critique

Having takenHistoricalConstructions
of Identity last fall, I was surprised and
disheartened toread last week's editorial
by the Young America's Foundation. The
blatant maligning of the course as simply
a part of a "PC" agenda of ideological
academic departments results from an
obvious lack of understanding of the
course's purpose. The generalizations
made about the course were outrageous
and, ironically, are a perfect example of
what the editorial seemed to want to

criticize: bad scholarship.
History 1, required of all history majors, provides a basis for understanding
historical concepts and themes. The purpose of the course is not to give history
students a bland survey-like investigation of history. Instead, the course gives
students a way of understanding history
that emerges as people become conscious
of their own constructed place in a historical framework, regardless of time
period or ideology.
The foundations of all forms of identity(including national, ethnic, religious,
and sexual) are constructions that apply
to various historical periods and events.
The course at Swarthmore last fall focused on only three: 1) the emergent
identities from the encounter of the Old
and New Worlds; 2) those of France and
its colonies; and 3) those of sexuality,
especially in the West during the nineteenthand twentieth centuries. The purpose of History 1 in exploring these constructedidentities was not, as the elusive
"students" from Swarthmore claim, to
"belly-ache" about imposed victimhood
status. The purpose of the course was to
in fact look critically at thosevery claims
of victimhood, because of the implica-

tions those claims have in relation to the
identities that have historically defined
"victim groups." These "victim groups"
(the editorial names only gays and feminists), by accepting theirvictimhood status, are accepting a spoon-fed version of
their histories and identities that have
traditionally been constructed for and
about them.
The work of History 1 did not include
"lamenting" by any group or individual
but instead provided a framework ofcritical analysis for the continued study of
history. History 1 hardly brainwashes
students into any "politically correct"
way of thinking; it encourages students
to think critically about what they study
and to understand the implications of
what their studies have on all types of
ideological identities.
For the "students" to miss the entire
point of the course leads me to believe
that those who provided the information
to the Young America'sFoundation never
even took History 1. This type of gutless
scholarship is representative of the conservative movement's attempt to criticize academic courses simply by title and
not by content Failure to recognize the
stated purpose of History 1 on the part of
these students is a real shame, and re-

flects a willingness on the part of the
conservative movement to blindly go
forward in their denouncing of "liberal"
academia, regardless of how ignorant
they actually are to specific course material. If "PC" courses such as Historical
Constructions of Identity do not satisfy
the Young America's Foundation's call
for serious academic pursuit ofhistorical
study, thenperhaps theFoundation should
quit their belly-aching and pursue some
serious study themselves.

Art glass controversy is not worth all the fuss

To The Editors:

After three years at Swat, the lengths
which people will go to expound on
their personal views still never ceases to
amaze me. The so-calledArt Glass Controversy infuriates me because it is so
much a situationof well-meaning efforts
gone wrong.
On a campus characterized by poor
use of public spaces and some buildings
which are barely functional, the fact that
people are up in arms about an aesthetic
choice which has no bearing on the
building's function seems astounding.
to

Why is no one upset that many buildings
on campus are not handicapped accessible? What about the deplorable lack of
common areas for students to convene?
And then there's Sharpies, possibly the
worst design for a Dining Hall ever conceived: terrible acoustics and narrow,
overcrowded passageways meant to
handle high traffic. Certainly if students
and professors want to create an issue
about architecture and design on this
campus, there are more useful things to
focus their efforts on than a few pieces of
colored glass.

cal intimacy with the" Nigerian "regime"

Containment a la George Kennan

It is clear that the United States, the
Commonwealth of Nations, the SADC
led African effort and European Union
(henceforth Coalition), "cannot expect
in the foreseeable future to enjoy politi-

power."

"Balanced against this are the facts
that Nigeria as opposed to the Coalition
in general, is still by far theweaker party,
that Nigerian policy is highly flexible,
and that Abacha's support base comprising greed civilians and military officers
may well contain deficiencies which will
eventually weaken its total potential."
This wouldofitself warrant theCoalition
entering with confidence upon a policy
of firm containment, designed to confront theAbacha regime with unalterable
counterforce at every point where they
show signs of encroaching upon the interests of a peaceful and stable Nigeria."
"But in actuality the possibilities for"
Coalition policy "are by no means limited to holding the line and hoping for the
best. Itis entirely possible for the Coalition to influence by its actions the internal developments in Nigeria." This ability was aptly demonstrated in the past
months when its appears that international pressure forced Abacha's Administration to commute the death sentences
imposed on political opponents. The
Coalition can create among the peoples
of Nigeria generally the impression of a
group which knows what it wants, ....To
the extent that such an impression can be
created and maintained, the aims of
Abacha's National Security State "must
appear sterile and quixotic,. ..."
"By the same token, exhibitions of
indecision, disunity, and internal disintegration within this "Coalition" have an
exhilarating effect on the whole military
regime. At each evidence of these tendencies, a thrill of hope and excitement
goes through the" military junta; a new
jauntiness can be noted in the" Abuja
"tread."
The Coalition "has it in its power to
increase enormously the strains under
which Nigerian policy must operate, to
force upon Aso Rock a far greater degree
of moderation and circumspection that it
has had to observe in recent years, and in
this way to promote tendencies which
eventually will find their outlet in either
the breakup or the gradual mellowing of
military power. For no regime can face
frustration indefinitely withoutadjusting
itself in one way or another to the logic of
that state of affairs."
The salient alternative to immediate
action such as:

Because that's not good comedy. And

here, on Swarthmore's campus, in
Swarthmore's own revamped, renovated,
and generally spruced-up Mephisto's
lounge, the world renowned Six Cents
comedy improv group will be performing this Saturday at 7:30 PM.
They shocked thousands in Heidelberg. They stolethe show in Hong Kong.
Noam and Ben were likened to comic
gods by the nation of France. They got
lost in Rome and asked a fellow if perhaps he could tell them the way back to
the "Hotel Americana"for a few lira. He
smiled affably and gave them a series of
confusing directions in broken English
punctuated with fits of maniacal laughter. They soon found themselves at the
entrance of a great cave. "What's this?"
asked Andrea, and the others just shook
their heads and exchanged confused
glances, for they hadn't seen anything in

the brochure about a cave. A soft wind
could be felt escaping from the gaping
stone mouth, indicating what could be
miles of tunnels and subterranean passageways.
The group was frightened, to be sure,
but intrigued. It was Josh who first set
foot into the gaping granite orifice, and
the rest followed eagerly. What ensued
was a battle between man and nature.
Following a sudden inexplicable wave of
lust (Eric), the seven clambered through
impossible narrows, braved bottomless
pools, and scaled sheer walls glistening
with incandescent lichens. Soon, they
arrived at what they knew must be their
destination. Before them, a great chamber had opened up, leagues below the
surface of the earth. Here, nestled between stalactites aeons old, under the
cover of layers of sedimentary rock, unseen by man, was the lowest level of the
parking deck of the Hotel Americana.
'That rascal!" exclaimed Amita, and the
group enjoyed a hearty laugh.
Theybrought downthe house at Albuquerque, and now they are here, in
Mephistos at 7:30 PM on Saturday the
18th.

Kate: This weekend's Swat cinema
offering is truly the one we've all been
waiting for. I, for one, am barely able to
contain my excitement as I present for
your viewing pleasure... are you sitting
down? The Swarthmore College Kevin
Bacon Film Festival.
Youall think I'mkidding here, but this
event really does bring great joy to my
life. Ever since it was proven on the Jon
StewartShow a few years back thatKevin
Bacon is the center of the universe, my
life has had a whole new meaning, and it
is theKevin Bacon Game. Ifyou haven't
started playing the Bacon Game, allow
me to enlighten you. The idea is that
every motionpicture personality is connected through his or her work to.Kevin
Bacon. Sort of a Six Degrees of Separation type of thing. For an example, I turn
to my friends outside my door and request any random movie star that pops
into their minds. "Cher," I'm told. After
a brief pause, I announce, "Bacon Number of 5. Cher was in Moonstruck with
Nicholas Cage, who was in Honeymoon
In Vegas with Sarah Jessica Parker, who
was inL A. Story with Steve Martin, who
was in Parenthood iJKth Diane Wiest,
who was in Footloose with Kevin Bacon."l'm sure there's amuchmore direct
route, but that was the best I could come
up with on the spot.
A less rigorous version of the game
allows players to use television and theater connections, and my personal favorite is the freeform game, in whicheverything goes. In this version, anyone with a
Ren poster from Footloose can have a
Bacon Number of 1.For those interested,
I personally have a Bacon Number of 2,
even by the strictest of rules, since I was
an extra in Three ofHearts with William
Baldwin, who was in Flatliners with
Kevin Bacon.
But I digress. For those of you who
haven't seen this weekend's first film.
Footloose, you are missing out on a true
icon of Americanculture, not to mention
some serious leverage with the Kevin
Bacon Game, sinceFootloose gives you
Diane Wiest, Jon Lithgow, Lori Singer,
and oh! Sarah Jessica Parker! That
cuts Cher's Bacon Number down to 3! In
Footloose,
Bacon plays Ren
MacCormack, a teenager whose family
moves from the big city to a small town
in lowa that has outlawed dancing. The
local Reverend (Lithgow) leads the opposition to this form of artistic self-expression through movement on the basis
that it encourages immoral behavior on
thepart of the town'syoung people. Ren,
however, has just gotta dance, and leads
the local teens in a movement to revoke
the oppressive no-dancing mandate.
All right, this isn't exactly Bacon's

partment of Sociology and Anthropology for more than thirteen years. As a
young man in Peru, Mufioz was involved
with political protests, labor organizations, and underground newspapers and
radio. In 1968, he was forced to leave the
country by the newly empowered military government of Velaco Alvarado.
Professor Mufioz studied in Europe while
working as literary critic and acting as a
foreign correspondent for a Peruvian
newspaper. Some famous figures he has
interviewedincludeBlack Panther leader

Mufioz is sometimes recognized in
Peru today
his active political
past. However, he saidthat now he thinks
ofhimself more as a scholar than apolitical agitator. Mufioz is still concerned
about human rights abuses in the country, but conditions under Peru's newly
elected democratic government are certainly "better than before."
After immigrating to the United States,
Mufioz studied under Dr. Parcins at the
University ofPermsylvaniafor four years,
and received a Ph.D. in Sociology in
1977.The next year, Mufioz was offered
a position as Professor of Sociology by
Swarthmore, thereby beginning his long
associationwith the college. Before coming to Swarthmore, he taught at the University ofPennsylvania, Temple University, Rutgers University and Philadelphia College of Art.
At Swarthmore, Professor Mufioz
served as the chair of the Social Sciences
Divisionfrom 1986-89, and acting chair
of the Sociology Department from 199091. He has also received numerous honors and awards, including the Mellon
Fellowship and the Brand Blanschard
Faculty Fellowship. During the Fall of
1988, he hosted a half hour radio program on Swarthmore's WSRN called
"Mufioz at Noon" where he interviewed
faculty authors.
Also a prolific writer, Mufioz has produced numerous articles in English and
Spanish on topics of Social Theory, Art
and Society, and Latin America. He hat
published two books: Sons of the Wind:

Weirdest Videos of McCabe!
Leo
EVEN I HAVE MY OWN
PSYCHIC HOTLINE CALL 1-900PAN-DORA! FOR

By Dan Sachar
Haveyou ever seen the McCabe video
list? If you have, no doubtyou've seen a
couple titles which have intrigued you.
Perhaps something which you saw and
thought, "Wow, ifI had thetime I would
take a look at that because it sounds
crazy!" Well, crazy is the right word.
Your faithful Phoenix editor has taken
the time to sit and watch some the wild,
weird, and crazy videos available at
McCabe's video desk. It is stunning the
oddities one can find at our head library.
So, I'm now going to letyouknow about
some of the odder videos you can watch
at McCabe:
Glen or Glenda —ln its effort to represent all, McCabe has acquired perhaps
the worstfilm ever, madeby Holly wood's
worst director, Ed Wood. This one-hour
wannabe movie is about a man who has
to struggle with telling his fiance that he
desires so badly to wear HER clothes! Ed
Wood himself (a real-life transvestite)
stars. This is a must-see piece of junk.
One ofthose "so-bad-it's-good" movies,
this one has collected all of Hollywood's
rejected actors and shows quite clearly
that they were rejected for a good reason
—they can't act. Truly a funny film, this
one manages to use stock footage over
and over again. It is so cheap that the
voice narrating the film actually goes
falsetto rather than having a female say
something. Incredibly awful, incredibly
funny.
/ Spit oh
Your Grave—Firstof all, let
me applaud the marketing genius who
devised this profound title. Bravo! Second of all, let me question what in
heaven's sake is this movie doing at
McCabe?! It is a poorly made, terribly
acted film about a woman who leaves the
city for some solitude in the country.

There, she finds herselfconfronted with
four evil locals, included one who is

mentally-handicapped. They proceed to
brutally rape this lady and leave her for
dead. She does not die, however, she
becomes Wonder Woman and cruelly
and disgustingly exacts her revenge on
the four rapists. A disgusting, X-rated
gore flick, one has to question whatpoor
students were forced to sit through this
horrible two hours as a requirement for
class. McCabe at its lowest.
The Sluts and Sex Goddesses Video

Women's Rugby Ties 0-0 Yet Again
By Jen Philpott

Photo by J«nnl« Houmhol

A Swat swimmer cruises to an easy victory last weekend In Lexington VA. The Swim Team has been breaking
records leftand right as both teams dive Into the season with ta record of2-0. The team has already qualified
two swimmers for Nationals, to be held In late March at Emory University In Atlanta, GA.

Swimmers Dominate
By Kendrew Witt
and Karsten Scherer-Nadal

Upcoming

The women'srugby team finished their
season with a game against their traditional rival, Bryn Mawr. This season can
be described in two words: tie games.
This game was no exception, and the Aside game ended 0-0. Swat's final record
was a disappointing 1-2-3 for the season.
Swarthmore played a tough game
against Bryn Mawr, but was unable to
run theirkind of offense because of Bryn
Mawr's 'Ruck-N-Roll' forward strategy.
Bryn Mawr played a largely forwarddominated game and Swarthmore was
unable to execute as many back line plays
as it would have liked.
Back Captain Rebecca Cole '96 was
able to make some great kicks, both on
penalty plays and during regular play. As
they are usually a kicking-oriented team,
this strategy seemed to take Bryn Mawr
by surprise, as their own tactics were
turned against them.
Despite Cole's success with kicking,
Swat was unable to capitalize on gained
yardage and did not score. Thebacks did

play a strong defensive game and were
able to capitalize on enough opportunities to generate some offense. KT Laird
'96 played a great game and set up many
rucks.
The forwards faced tough opposition
inBryn Mawr and they were worn down
by the many scrums, rolling mauls, kicking, and the overall pace of the game.
Heather Goff '96 said, "We were tired,
but Bryn Mawr was obviously in worse
shape than we were since they kept faking minutes to geta break and some water
from the sidelines."
The referee was unsympathetic to S w at
Forward Captain Kelly Shannon's '96
persistent requests to limit the number of
minutes taken by Bryn Mawr. In fact, the
referee, Bryn Mawr's übiquitous coach
Ed, was oblivious to most of
Swarthmore's questions, particularly
about his calls that were clearly in the
wrong.
Despite the tiring pace of the game,
Swarthmore finished its fall rugby season in style. The forwards and backs
played a more united game than they had

all season and many players showed great
improvement since the first game of the
season.

The B-side game generated more excitement, in terms of scoring, than the A
side game. Swarthmore fielded a B side
that was more than half comprised of
returning A side players. In the first half,
Laird and Andrea Johnson '9B scored on
impressive runs from about 10 and 20
yards out of the try zone respectively.
Johnson broke through several attempted
tackles and almost the entire Bryn Mawr
forward pack in order to touch the ball
down for five points.
Unfortunately, Swarthmore's exhaustion began to show in the second half as

Bryn Mawr returned Swat's 10 points
and added five more of their own. Swat
was unable to score again, and the final
score was 17-10.
After numerous injuries, long road
trips, a great party, many ups and downs,
practices in the rain, games in the rain,
and a lot of hard work. Swat's women
ruggers have called an end to their season.

week for more on Jill).
There was another national

qualifier
this autumn day. Fulkersonraced to a
1:09.44 in the 100 breaststroke and a full
half second under the national cut. Perhaps, it was knowing that there wouldbe
twenty pizzas for the team waiting in the
lobby after the meet that spurred her on.
Whatever it was, it did not take much to
get her to race incredibly fast.
There were several other notable
swims. Ariel Behr '9B, in the 50 fly
during the 200 Medley Relay, dropped a
full second off her previous best time. In
the 200 BreasUtroke, Jenny Harvey '99
approached the national's cut with her
time of a 2:33.10. Andrew Robbins '9B
could beheard during Jenny' s race shouting, "She's AMAZING!"
On the men's side, there were no national qualifiers or brokencollege records.
That's not to say, though, that there were
not some great swims. The first two sub-50 second 100 frees were recorded by
Andrew Robbins '9B and Carl Sanders
'9B during the 400 freestyle relay.
This Friday, Swat Swimming once
again boards "Tha Johnson"for the sevenhourbus ride to Williams for an extended
relay meet which Amherst, Hamilton,
and Springfield University will also attend. These teams represent very strong
competition for our best swimmers and
will push them to swim even faster, perhaps destroying another few college
records and coming up with some national qualifying times.
on

Last Saturday, the swim team boarded
"Tha Johnson" (their bus) bright and
early and traveled to beautiful Vassar
College for a tri-meet with NYU. The
result: absolute victory on both fronts.
Overall, the team performed solidly.
The meet provided the opportunity for
returning swimmers to get back to their
mid-season racing form and the firstyears to gain some more experience. As
Kim Killeen '97 said, "the frosh were
given a taste of the swim team way!"
On this day, several S warthmore swimmers busted out. The meet began with a
college record and a near college record
in the same event. Alanna Roazzi '99 led
off the 200 Medley Relay (comprised of
Roazzi, Skye Fulkerson '96, Cathy
Polinski '99, and Janine Gent '99) with a
college record in the 50-yard backstroke.
The relay's time was only a half-second off the college record that was set
last year at theconference meet.Fulkerson
had an idea. Reflecting on the relay's
performance, she looked ahead and said,
"I'd like to see us drop a couple of seconds and go to Nationals."
Speaking of Nationals, it looks like the
team already has a couple of qualifiers.
In the 200 Butterfly, Jill Belding '99
broke the college record with a time of
2:12.39 and wentunder thenational qualification time standard (see athlete of the

Generals decidedthat they were going to
throw the ball.
On third down out of the shotgun formation, Generals center Stefan
Neumeister snapped the ball into the
endzone. Quarterback Brooks Fischer
alertly kicked the ball out of the back of
the endzone for a safety. This was all the
scoring the Garnet Tide needed on this
wretched day.
It looked as if the Garnet Tide would
tack on another score after a Curtis
Trimble '96 interception return to the
General 16-yard line, but the Generals
defenserose to the occasion and stopped
the Garnet Tide twelve yards short of the
own territory and going into the wind,

The Garnet Tide travelled to
Lexington,Virginia last weekend in
search of a .500 record and a seasonending victory, two feats they hadn't
pulled off since the 1992campaign. From
the time they arose at 9:00 am at Howard
Johnson, it was obvious once again that
for the Garnet Tide to win, they would
have to defeat two opponents—the Generals of Washington & Lee (3-2-1) and
the weather.
Inclement weather has stalked the
Garnet Tide at almost every turn this
season, and Saturday proved to be no
different.The Garnet Tide was caught in
thetorrentialrains thatbattered the entire
Eastern Seaboard. With the middle third
of the field under water and the remainder a mud bog, Wilson Field had been
quickly transformed into a quagmire.
The first half was a story of near misses
and squandered opportunities. Washington & Lee had the better of the first half
chances. After The GarnetTide's initial
possession ended in a punt, the Generals,
blessedwith great fieldposition, marched
to the Garnet Tide 31 -yard line but could
get no further.
The Generals' second possession
started on their own 47-yard line following an 18 yard return of a Pat Straub '97
interception. They penetrated as far as
the 25-yard line, but they were pushed
back to the 32-yard line where they were
forced to punt.
After the Garnet Tide's third possession. Matt Poe '96 was called on once
again to punt. Aftera2l yardpuntreturn,
it appeared that the Generals would finally score, but once again, their drive
failed deep in Garnet Tide territory.
Without thebenefit ofgood field position, the Generals went three-and-out on
their next possession. The Generals' punt
was blocked by Brian Hall '96, giving the
Garnet Tide the ball at the General 33
yard line. The Garnet Tide was unable to
capitalize as Frank Amar '96 was plowed
under by a host of General defenders on
4th down and 2.
The Garnet Tide had one final chance
to score before the half, but Mason Tootel
'99 was unable to corall a Pat Straub (717,58 yards, 1 INT) pass at the goalline.
With therain intensifying and the wind
gusting, the secondhalfbecame a war of
attrition.The passing game was no longer
a viable option: both teams, ifthey wanted
to win, had to play the game in the
trenches.
After a Washington & Lee punt, the
Garnet Tide was able to move the ball
into General territory, but again came

end zone.
For much of the fourth quarter, both
offenses floundered in the mud, making
desperate but woefully inadequate attempts to move the ball. The Generals
had one final chance to win the game in
the final minute, but the besieged Garnet
Tide defense, led by Jim Hunt '96 (10
tackles), stopped Brooks Fischer just short
of a first down, preserving the victory,
securing a .500 record, and gaining the
Garnet Tide's first shutout since 1984.
"It was a defensive battle," said defensive tackleKurk Selverian '97. "A lot of
theseniordefensive players came up big.
We were able to win the field position

The offense's abilty to control the clock

Garnet Tide
were rewarded for their stellar play this
season by earning berths on the AllCentennial Conference Teams.

Lady Amazons Run Wild
By Danielle Wall
This past weekend, the Swat Amazon
Cross Country Women competed in the
Mid-East Regional Championship meet
in Carlisle, PA. With over 35 teams of
eager, fresh runners, the race was to be
everything a cross country championship should be and more. The starting
line stretchedfor miles and the anticipation before the gun went off was almost
tangible.

Crowds flanked the entire course: every parent and family dog east of the
mighty Mississippi turned out to cheer
on the runners. On this day of days anything was possible. The season was about
to end with a big bang, and Swat was
shouting for the stars.
As was expected, Moravian captured
the crown, closely followed by the likes
of Trenton State, Gettysburg, and
Haverford.The Lady Amazons mustered
up enough strength and power to nab
eleventh place.
There were hopes of bettering last
year's sixth place finish. Destiny, however, seemed to think otherwise. With
powerhouse Solai Buchanan '96 on the

choice: can we still pull together and be
a threat?

Boosted by the efforts of their fellow

The team has come a long way over the
course of this season. Thanks are due to
every single woman runner who was
brave enough to join the ranks of the
Amazon Women.
Preparation for a meet like Regionals
starts the first day of practice. The workouts, the camaraderie, and the coaching
build day after day, ultimately shaping
the strength and enthusiasm of the seven
runners chosen to compete at the end of
the season.
The supreme guidance of Coach Ted
and Coach Norma provided a firm and
supportive foundation for a successful
season. Their hardwork and unceasing
inspiration set a standard of excellence
for both the men's and women's teams.
Running is a unique sport, and the
bonds formed between runners are special. So, ladies, remember this time and
hold on to your memories of fartleks,
hills, and puddles of sweat In the dead of
winter, conjure-up images of cross country practice and running eight miles in the
warm sun. Most of all, though, know
what it is to be an Amazon.

The Phoenix

Women's
B-Ball
By Rachel Gutman
The women's basketball team will play
Johns Hopkins University on November
21 inBaltimore. Hopkins has, in thepast,
been one of the strongest teams in the
conference, and promises to be a tough
opponent again this year. With a large
roster and many returning players, they
will once again be a strong team. They
made a good showing at the Centennial
Conference last Monday, which was a
meeting of all the coaches from men's
and women's teams in the conference.
The game will be a challenge, but coming
offof two preseason wins against Beaver and Widener Colleges, the Swat
women and their coaches are confident
that they can meet it.
With less than one week until their
opening game, the Swarthmore women
anxiously await this big event. Mental
and physical preparation are underway
as practices get longer and more intense
by the day. As the team learns new
defenses and fast-break strategies, signs
in the team locker room read, "Think
Hopkins," or "One More Week!" For
three hours a day the women try to forget
about their other stresses and responsibilities and focus on basketball.
A team meeting was held with exactly
seven days until game time to discuss
ways to pick up the level of playing a
notch. Academics and social events had
begun to bear down on some of theplayers, making it hard to direct all their
thoughts towards basketball. But personal drive and hard work are the keys to
battling this problem. Team members
agreed to try to put all their concentration
into the team for the next week during
this important period ofpreparation. This
meeting proved to be inspirational and
successful because the subsequent practice was one of the most intense since the
start of the season.

Mental and physical
preparation are underway as practices get
longer and more intense by the day.
The Garnet coaches, headed by Donna
Davis, are currently putting their heads
together to find new strategies on how to
effectively play Johns Hopkins. They
review old game tapes from past years to
evaluate Hopkins' playing, as well as
Swarthmore attacks that did or did not
work against them previously. They
watch other game tapes, too, to get a
sense of what has helped Swat perform
well in the past and what has hurt them.
Reading books, talking with other
coaches, brainstorming, and working and
reworking strategies have occupied much
of the coaches' time the past few days.
As for theplayers, each daythey come
to practice with a drive for victory and
success. They play through sickness and
injury in order to ready themselves for
next Tuesday. Senior co-captain Nancy
Rosenbaum tirelessly attempts to inspire
her teammates to push themselves and
give it their all. Other team members
cheer each other on and help each other
surpass their limits and achieve their

goals.
The atmosphere at practices is one of
focus and intensity; deep concentration
can be seen on the faces of the Swat
women's basketball players. The sounds
that can be heard at practices are those of
encouragement from team members and

Mascot Choices:
The GarnetFoxes: They're clever, of
course. They're wily and smart and native to the Crum. We could dress ours in
a broad-brimmedQuaker hat, likeGeorge
Fox, founder of the Religious Society of
Friends.
The Griffins: With the body ofa lion
and the wings of an eagle, this mythical
beast is said to have its head in the clouds
and its feet on the ground. What could be
more apt for Swarthmore?
The Little Quakers: Old-fashioned?
Yes, but traditions tend to be. Swarthmore
was known as the Little Quakers (as
opposed to that big University in Philly)
for many years. Why not resurrect our
old Friend?
from little
The Mighty Oaks:
acorns grow. As a metaphor, there's
none better for a college. Picture a
sprightly acom along Magill Walk.
Swarming Earthworms: Whatcould
be more intimidating than a swarm of
worms? And "earthworms," essential
elements in the health of the campus
landscape, is also an anagram for ...well,
you figure it out.
The Wild Kangaroos: For many decades, students sang, "Oh we're going to
the Hamburg Show; see the lion and the
wildkangaroo." We see a cantankerous,
capricious kanga with a brain
probably carrying a few books in her pouch on
the way to the game.

Two fellow liberal arts arts schools
will be the first opponents to test the
division
champion
defending
Swarthmore Garnet in this weekend's
annual Equinox Classic. Amherst and
Macalester Colleges make their first appearances in the tournament co-hosted
by Swarthmore and Haverford.
This weekend's games will start to
answer several pressing questions concerning scoring, rebounding, and overall
team size. Last season, one player accounted for an average of 17 points and
10rebounds a game. This load will probably be distributed among the starting
rotation rather than forced upon one or
two players.

The Brains and Brawn Behind Swat Wrestling
By Anne Frankenfleld
The Swarthmore wrestling program is
the most successful both on campus as well as in the Centennial Conferone of

ence. The program has produced more
NCAADivision 111Academic All-American wrestlers than any other college in
the United States, several Division HI
Ail-Americans. Many individuals have
placed well in Centennials, Regionals,
and continued to the National Championships. So, who are the brains behind
this thriving group of aspiring athletes?
Ronald A. Tirpak proudly holds the
respected position of head coach for the
Swat team. Coach Tirpak graduated from
Millersville University from which he

received his baccalaureate degree in social science. He also has a MasterofArts
degree in anthropology and is a doctoral
candidate at Temple University. At
present, he teaches UnitedStates foreign
policy and archaeology at Ridley High
School and is a senior consultant for an
international archaeological research
firm, MAAR Associates, Inc. However,
his success as a coach and athlete are just
as impressive as his professional credentials.
Coach Tirpak is well-versed in
freestyle, collegiate, and Greco-Roman
wrestling. His knowledge of the Soviet
System, together withhis mastery of technique and his adaptation of Asian martial
arts, have made him a very well-known

and sought after coach. He holds the
Coach's Silver Certification, the second
highest coaching honor presented by
U.S.A. Wrestling, which recognizes him
as being among the top five percent of
coaches in the United States.
His accolades, however, do not stop
here. In his own wrestling career, Coach
Tirpak was an NAIA Ail-American, a
Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference
runner-up, six-time Eastern Freeestyle
Champion, and a two-time Middle Atlantic States Greco-Roman Champion.
His overall competition record is an amazing 502-96-6 (24-5-0 international).

direction from coaches.

school. The best thing about him is that
he cares abouthis athletes as people first,
then wrestlers. Most of the team thinks
of him as a father and not just a coach."
Coach Tirpak also has some very talented help behind him. Assistant Coach
Ron Artingstall serves a dual role as
coach and strength and conditioning coordinator.
Participating as a freestyle wrestler
for Great Britain in the 1980 Olympic
Games held in Moscow, he is a world
renowned author and lecturer on physical conditioning. He holds positions with
both the U.S. National Rugby Team and
the Philadelphia Wings pro indoor lacrosse team as conditioning coach in
addition to positions as a personal trainer
for various national and Olympic level
figure skaters, rowers, and wrestlers. He
was even sought by the Soviet national
baseball team for his amaxing expertise.
Coach Artingstall's dedication to the
fields ofhealth and fitness extend much
further than just to the athletic field. He
is very active in the community, serving
as an exercise and rehabilitation therapist with E.T.S.
Finally, Jay S. Peichel serves as the
third leg in this strong coaching trio.
Serving as Assistant Coach, he is recognized as one of the most successful wrestlers in Swarthmore history. By the time
he graduated in 1989, hehad amassed an
impressiverecord of 107-29-2,along with
three Middle Atlantic Conference medals and NCAA Division 111 All-American laurels.
In addition to his success on the mat,
he was also named twice as an NCAA
Academic All-American in economics.
Coach Peichel is well-known for his technical abilities and tenacity and brings a
dynamic aspect to the team which is
reflected in the spirit of the squad.
Together this group, along with the
natural talent of the wrestlers, bring to
you the successful Swat team you see
from season to season.

At only the second meet ofher college career, Jill Belding '99 broke the Swarthmore
College record in the 200 yard butterfly and qualified for the National Championships
in the same event. Jill remarked about her race, "It surprised the heck out of me! I
certainly did not expect it"
It would be easy to say that Jill is a great swimmer and that she works hard- that's
obvious. To stop there, though, would be to omit what she most offers the team and
everyone she meets. A teammate remarked, "Jill is just a great person. She's fun to talk
to and practice with. Her kind-hearted and playful attitude influences everyone around
her."

"I really don't care where the points
come from. I just want them to keep
coming. If we can't execute our half
court offense effectively and score out of
it, we're going to struggle," said Coach
Lee Wimberly. Two key players in this
offense are guard Colin Convey '97 and
forward Ben Schall '97.
Convey andSchall developed into fine
all-around players last season. They both
have excellent outside touch and were
the two leading percentage shooters from
behind the three-point line. They are often the playmakers, displaying an uncanny court vision and always out-hustling opponents for loose balls.
The co-captains Craig Rodner '96 and
Matt Grossman *96 join them as key
playmakers. Rodner is an excellent defensive player and ball handler. He is
able to draw charges through his excellentpositioning. Grossman is deceptively
quick and regularly sacrifices his body
for loose balls.
AaronBond '97 and Sam Voolich '96
will share most of the duty at center.
Voolich had a breakthrough season last
year, averaging nearly 10points and over
five rebounds per game.Bond has all the
physical tools needed to be a dominating
big-man, and this could be the season he
puts it all together.
Two forwards, Mark Pletcher '96 and
A.J. Shanley '97, should make huge contributions. Pletcher can fill any one of a
number of roles. He has a nice outside
shot and among the best verticals on the
team, allowing him to rebound much
better than one would expect for his size.
Shanley is a wild card because he has
been sidelinedfor much of the last two
seasons with injury. As a freshman, he
averaged over six points and three rebounds per contest.
Rebounding and free throw shooting
are Wimberly's two biggest concerns.
"The question is whether or not we are
going to be able to defend post players
because we're small," he said. "It [free
throw shooting] has been abysmal in both
scrimmages. That's going to have to
change or we're going to have problems
in close games."
These are two areas where last year's
team excelled. Swarthmore was second
in the league in free throw percentage
and out-rebounded conference opponents
by an average of three per game.
Against Macalester, the Garnet
rebounders will be tested by a team that
will tower over them in size. Although
Macalesterhad a poor record last season,
the team is reported to havehad an excellentrecruiting year. Amherst, on theother
hand, has made the Division 111
postseason tournament several times recently and will be among the tougher
teams the Garnet will face this winter.
The Equinox Classic begins Friday at
Haverford. Amherst challenges
Haverford at 3:00 pm, and Macalester
faces Swarthmore at 6:00 pm. On Saturday the games are played at Swarthmore
also beginning at 3:00 pm. Amherst will
face Swarthmore in the early game, followed by Macalester against Haverford.

Saturday marks the beginning of what
looks to be a very succesful season for
Swarthmore's wrestlers. Coming off a
season where the team failed to reach its
full potential, despite several outstanding individual efforts, Head Coach Ron
Tirpak searches to find consistency and
intensity in this year's squad.
The line-up scheduled for this year's
Swarthmore Takedown Tournament is
no pushover. Conference nemeses Western Maryland, Johns Hopkins, and
Ursinus will test the MenofSparta early.
The additionof York, Williamson, and
an ever-improving LaSalle squad to the
tournament also provides an opportunity
for the matmen to hone their skills.
Rounding out the field are St. John's,
Rutgers-Camden, Middlesex County,
Gloucester, and GallaudeL Haverford
will also be available for drubbing.
Because the rules for the tournament have been amended in order to
allow for more than one competitor in
each weight class, look for several wrestlers to be competing out of their inseason weight classes.
Keep a close eye on first-years Scott
Timm (118) and Adrian Wilson (126).
Word has it that they are capable of
putting on quite a show. Balvanz (142)
and Teplin (134), each with a large
repertoire of flashy moves, should provide stiffcompetition for conferencefoes.
Also worthy of attention are the everexciting and unpredictable Jason Sturm
'97 (134/142), Rufus Frazier '99 (134),
and GabeBenjamin-Fernandez '98(142).
