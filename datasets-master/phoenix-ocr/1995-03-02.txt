Judson Gives Lecture on
Nationalism at IC Lunch
History professor believes nationalism is too artificial a concept
By Elizabeth Weber

The idea that countries can be
founded on the basis ofnationalidentity is very recent and shouldn't be
taken for granted, history professor
Pieter Judson said Monday in a lunchtime lecture sponsored by the Intercultural Center.
"I want to take some of the power
out of nationalism by looking at it
critically," he told a munching group
of 25 students, faculty, and staff. "I
mean, it's all a lie anyway."
He noted thateven inFrance, which
is often considered the most nationalistic of states, most citizens didn't
consider themselvesFrench until the
latter half of the 19th century.
Judson, who is a specialist in 19th
century European nationalism, especially in the Czechoslovakia and
German regions, expressed his "personal belief that national identities
are 'made-up' identities." He emphasized that such identities are
neverthless extremely powerful.
He saidnationalismis "not a single
coherent ideology." However, it al-

ways includes certainnotions. These
include the ideas that viable communities of equals can and should be
based on shared characteristics, such
as language and ethnicity, and that
such communities have the right to

political independence.
Concepts of who should be included in nationaliststates have generally been split between the French
model, which is based on institutions, and the German model, which
is based on ancestry.
With the fall of Communism,

Judson said, some European countries have adopted more nationalist
political outlooks. He explained that
nationalist separatism in areas such
as the former Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia has "raised the stakes" of
nationalist ideology.
Judsonoffered the example of the
long-lasting Hapsburg monarchy in
Central Europe as a viable multinational state. He explained, "If you
recognize in that [example] a critique
of people who believe that multiculturalism is making America fall
apart, you're right."

However, he said, nationalism is
entirely bad idea. 'To fight
certain battles, [nationalism is] very
important, but we should realize it's
constructed," he said. "We might not
validate the Kurds if they didn'tspeak

not an

in nationalist terms."
In response to one student's question, Judson said that nationalist identities outlive their usefulness when
"the group starts imposing homoge-

neity on itself."
The lecture, entitled "Nationalism:
What It Is, Where ItCan Lead," was
the second in the IC's "In Our Own
Backyard" series this semester.
The series consists of lunchtime
lectures on the last Monday of every
month and weekly workshops on
Tuesday afternoons.
Lunch is provided at the lectures,
which are intended to "give students
some perspective" on multicultural
issues in the outside world, according
to Fernando Chang-Muy, Assistant
Dean and Director of the IC.
Chang-Muy will give the next lecture in the series, on US immigration
and refugee law, on March 27.

LBGA Sponsors Discussion of Queer Issues at Swat
By Jon Francis

plained that "We wanted it not to be

who are questioning their sexualiden-

LBGA thing."
The meeting was part of an attempt by LBGA members to revive
interest and activity in campus queer
groups and to make the queer community more cohesive.
Among the goals adopted during
the meeting, one of the most important was to hold more social events
where gays, lesbians, and bisexuals
can get to know one another. Other
than parties and business meetings,
the queer community has held few
social events recently.
Walterick noted that more frequent
social gatherings would bring the
community closer together, and allow for greater support for students

tities or considering coming out.
Anotherkey goal which came from
the meeting is to increase diversity
within LBGA. The group has been
comprisedprimarily of white females
in the past, and members want that to
change. "That's one of the primary
reasons we held it," said intern Julia
Bryan-Wilson '95. "There's a lack of
diversity on many differentfronts."
Other goals were to create a safe,
comfortable place for people to talk,
to increase communication with queer
groups at other schools, to workmore
with other queer-friendly groups and
individuals, to maintain confidentiality, and to increase contact with other
campus groups, like SAO and HOLA.

an

At an LBGA-organized meeting

last Thursday, all lesbians, gays, and

bisexuals were invited to speak out.
Approximately thirty people attended, abouthalfof themnon-LBGA
members. Gender affairs advisor
Karen Henry guided the meeting
through a discussion of the LBGA's
history, major concerns, goals, and
future plans, according to students
who attended the event.
Though the meeting was organized
by LBGA members, LBGA intern
Stefanie Walterick '97 emphasized
thatit was open to allmembers of the
queercommunity at Swarthmore, not
just LBGA members. Walterick ex-

Plans for achieving these goals
include holding alternating business
and discussion meetings, forming
intramuralsports teams, having more
activites during orientation, holding
a weekly lunch or brunch, and developing a list of students and staff
who are willing to talk to those who
do not feel comfortable attending
group gatherings.
Many other concerns were raised
at the meeting. Some said they see
LBGA as exclusive to outsiders.
Others said the Coming-Out Group
and Fluid Women do not meet the
needs of queers on campus. One
studentnoted that S warthmoreis not
as safe from homophobia as many
often feel it is.

SC Busy Writing
New Constitution
By Fred Bush

Photo by Eric Walton

Spideiman, a.k.a. Peter Parker '62, climbed the walls of Sharpies Dining Hall in a
valiant attempt to findhis date for Screw Your Roommate last Saturday. He ran
into trouble when he lost his footing and fell 20 feet to the floor.

New rules for chartering student
groups will be among the most obvious features of the Student Council
Constitution Committee's draft for a
new Student Council constitution,
according to committeechairman Seth
Harvey '97. He said the committee
also hopes to clarify the relationships
between SC, Budget Committee, Social Affairs Committee, and the Forum for Free Speech.
The committee has written two articles and has begun work on the third
articleof the draft constitution, Harvey
said. The current draft is a revision of
one written last semester by Tony
Cheeseborough '97 and Mike Pan
'97. The full committee never considered the old draft, and so did not
ratify it.
Harvey said SC is seeking student
comments on the prior draft, and will
incorporate changes based on these
comments into the new draft. A copy

of the old draft is posted on the SC
bulletin board; the committee plans
to distribute additional copies and
put one on reserve at McCabe Library. It will consider comments and
suggestions until March 17.
The Constitution Committee has
not decided whether to submit the
constitution to the student body for
ratification or to confine the vote to
SC. Harvey said that SC feels that
since it was duly elected by the student body, it has the power to ratify
the constitution without a popular
vote. He added, though, thatthe Constitution Committee is "very, very
interested in what the student body
thinks would be appropriate."
Traditionally, SC has draftedconstitutions behindclosed doors. However, Harvey plans to ask SC to
consider allowing non-members to
watch drafting sessions, though the
whole council would have to agree
before a non-council member could
be allowed entry.

A visiting student spoke of a program at her college called BLAST, or
Bisexuals, Lesbians, and Straights
Talking, which holds open discus-

sions without assumptions regarding
sexual orientation. Support group
coodinator Ryan Bush '95 said he
would like to see similar meetings at
Swarthmore.
In general, organizers agreed that
the atmosphere at the meeting was
positive. "We were starting to see
some more energy coming back," said
Bush. "It was a good start."
Bryan-Wilson added LBGA must
continue with its efforts. "While it's
important to recognize the meeting
was positive in a lot of ways, there's
still a long way to go."

IC Shuffles Offices
to Spur Interaction

Did you work

C'mon, you miss it,
don't you?

A new arrangement of offices in
the Intercultural Center should increase opportunities for interaction
among members of the center's constituent organizations, said Fernando
Chang-Muy, Assistant Dean and Director of the IC.
Untilrecently the IC's three member groups—HOLA, LBGA, and
S AO—had offices in separate rooms
in the center. Two weeks ago, the
groups moved into a single office
that they share with Chang-Muy. The

Committee Warns
of Potential Student
Housing Shortage
Apotential housing shortage could
keep some first-year students from
obtaining dorm rooms at room draw
in April, the Housing Committee
warned in a statementreleased Tuesday by committee member Laura
Gitelson '97.
The committee added that there is
a "strong likelihood"that extra rooms
will open up over the summer if students who initially applied for housing decide to take the semester off or
live off-campus.
Housing ran short last year, but by
the start of classes in September, the
College had found rooms for all of
the students who did not get rooms at
room draw.
According to Gitelson, the com-

mittee recommended at a meeting
Monday that the Dean's Office encourage RAs to room in singles except in unusual situations, such as
when there re no singles on a hall.

Computing Society
Considers Future
The Swarthmore College Computing Society met Monday to discuss
how to deal with future Raptor
crashes. Prompted by last week's
overload of the SCCS's UNIX machine, the group discussed whether
to write strict policies restricting user
load or to keep a looser policy.
SCCS officers commendedJustin
Paulson '96 for reducing the number
of people visiting his World Wide
Web (WWW) page by finding new
homes for several parts of his page.
Members briefly considered putting
a limit on how much memory to allot
each Raptor account, but instead
opted to formalize communication
between system administrator, officers and Raptor users.
Several members had voiced support for a strictly worded policy because they thought it would makefair
enforcement easier, but most in attendance agreed that such a policy
would be against the open philosophy the group has followed thus far.
Officers also said they are looking
for a program which would be able to
limit the number of connections to
the c rmputer at any one time.

Promotions and tenure awards okayed
By Tamar Charry

In meetings last weekend, the
Swarthmore CollegeBoard of Managers decided upon a 4.5% increase
in student tuitionand fees, assessed
the financial aid policy, and announced awards of tenure to several
faculty members.
The increase in tuition and fees is
similar to those made in previous
years. According to President Al
Bloom, it reflects increases in the
"cost of salaries, [and] expenses outside of the College's control, such as
the cost of books and periodicals for
the libraries, utilities, and technology." The increase translates into an
increase of about $1,150 for each
student.
The cost increase was made with
careful consideration, said Bloom, of

the financial restraints it places

on

students. Last year, Swarthmore's
increase was one-half of one percent

Janet Talvacchia of the Department
of Mathematics and Statistics.
Tenure only was granted to Stephen
O'Connell, who had already attained
the position of Associate Professor.
President Bloom praises these appointments, saying, "eachadds a significant measure of distinction to an
already extraordinary faculty."
Promotion to the position of Professor was granted to Stephen Golub
of the Department of Economics,
Charles Grinstead of the Department
ofMathematics and Statistics, Helen
Shapiro of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and Judy Voet
of the Department of Chemistry.
In addition, two Endowed Chair
positions were awarded to faculty
members. The Sara Lawrence
Lightfoot Professorship was awarded
to Kathryn Morgan, Professor ofHistory, and the Richter Professorship
was awarded to Raymond Hopkins,
Professor of Political Science.

Student Council Announcement
To all the members of the Swarthmore Community (students, faculty and staff):
Student Council hasrecently been focusing on improving the communication on this

campus, particularly the announcements of all-campus events hosted by student
organizations and departments.
We would like to inform you of a new weekly activity update sent through all-campus
email, In which all Swarthmore organizations and departments can announce all the
events they are hosting each week. This program should alleviate costly publicity,
improve communication of events, and support the recognition ofcampus groups and
departments. It will also provide a more complete guide than the Weekly News, which
does not accept ads for parties, bands etc. The e-mail willalso accept submissionslater
than the Weekly News. Hopefully, it will be an efficient way ofcutting downthe number
of emails sent by members of the community. With the exception of the semester
Student Council Elections and the Airport Shuttle messages, this would be another
form in which SC would use all-campus email.
To appear on the SC Announcements of all-campus events hosted by a Swarthmore
group or department, the President, Chair orrepresentative ofthe group must submit
the material every Wednesday, sothat the email can be sent out the next day. It is only
necessary to include announcements that fall within each week (the Friday after the
message is submitted, up to the Thursday when the next email is sent).
In order for this plan to be effective and helpful, SC asks that the annoucemehts to
follow the following criteria:
Respect the 25 word limit
-Announce only all-campus events (parties, speakers, gatherings...)
Announcements must represent a Swarthmore organization, club, or

less than that of comparable educationalinstitutions; theBoard projects
that this may be the case this year as
well.
Financial aid awards will remain
as they have been. "We remain unqualifiedly committed to need-blind
admission, and to meeting the assessed financial needs of all our students," said Bloom.
"There is a cap on the number of
foreign students that we admit on
financial aid," said Bloom. This cap
remains 10%of the Financialaid budget, as it has been in the past.

Opinions

Moving Beyond Affirmative Action Dem's Detect Hypocrisy
Affirmative action.
Those two controversial words have recently come
under Congressional scrutiny. And rightly so.
The Philadelphia Inquirer recently reported that
"[t]wo of thenation's most prominent black politicians
acknowledged...a need to review the effectiveness of
affirmative-action programs...." The article, on page
A 6 of the February 27 issue, goes on to say that Democrats and Republicans alike are expressing support for
President Clinton's decision to reassess federal programs of this type. At the heart of the issue, it said, is a
"debate over whether programs intended to reverse
centuries of discrimination are now themselves discriminatory." These are weighted words, and heavy
ideas, with which lawmakers are grappling.
The issue ofaffirmative action poses many problems.
Itis true that some minorities bear a social and economic
burden due to a history of oppression and poverty. It is
true that, historically, these groups have been deprived

programs replace one flavor ofracism with another. We
all know the saying: two wrongs don't make a right.
The problem is that some groups are deprived. The
answer isn't to deprive other groups. Withoutknowing
any ofmy qualifications, The Associated Press told me,
no, thankyou. Simply, ifI may coin the phrase, because
of the color of my skin.
Perhaps some would argue that affirmative action
programs are the only way to approximate the reparations owed these people. Others may argue that it is
justified to deprive White people—as the wide array of
ethnicities bearing Caucasian coloration are typically,

of privileges, education, and the stable lifestyles necessary for upward mobility. It is true that some minorities
have been placed in a position of disadvantage, and that

towards a deep problem. Racism and discrimination
persist regardless of mandates and regulations. It's
about the way people feel; the laws can't touch that.
The solution, then, is to change the way people feel.
The only way, it seems, to reverse the injustice is to stop

and inappropriately, lumped together—of jobs and
opportunities; that the injustices committed by the

White race can be repaid today.
But this is replacing hate with hate. And nothing
good ever came of hate.
The attempt to ameliorate racial tensions through
affirmative action programs is a superficial gesture

it is society's responsibility to help those people.
On the other hand, though, it is also true that when I,
a white woman, attempted to apply for a summer internship with the Associated Press for the coming summer,
I was told that there was no opportunity for me there. All
internships, I was informed, were reserved for members
of the Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian
ethnic groups. I call that discrimination.
Affirmative action programs are designed to reverse
a form of injustice. The burdens under whichminorities
have suffered are clearly unfair.But these programs do
not solve the problem. In effect, affirmative action

it at its source—the individual. It is about how people
learn, at a young age, about who they are, and who the
rest of the world is. That is what we need to change.
How do we do that? Apparently, no one knows.

Congress doesn't know. The market doesn't know.
Citizens don't know. What we do know, however, and
what Congress is apparently realizing, is that the issue
runs deeper than hiring policies and ethnic quotas. This
is not about laws; it's about people.

in Common Sense Claims

To the Editor:
The fitting response to Matt
Schenk's title in CommonSense, "Can
SwarthmoreHandleTrueDialogue?"
might be "Can Conservatives Handle
That Not Everyone Agrees With
Them?" Schenk attacks College
Democrats and other liberal groups
on campus for their alleged narrow
views and ignorant, knee-jerk politics, yet his article proves that conservatives fall prey just as easily to
these vices.
Schenk denounced the College
Democrats' use of "clever soundbites" in our signs which took "potshots" at Newt Gingrich and the GOP
platform, saying that our signs demonstrated how uninformed and immature the group is. Let's be realistic. Our signs, which displayed photos ofNewt Gingrich withred slashed

circles around him, and phrases such

"Say No to Newt," were designed
to be humorous and eye-catching,
and hardly strove to describe in depth
our stance on welfare reform and the
Contract With America. Open a
Newsweek or a New York Times and
you will see plenty of potshots at
as

Newt and company. It is disappointing to think that conservatives such
as Schenk cannot stomach a little

To the Editor:

Dumb and Dumber and On Deadly

I have been called an intellectual
snob so many times that I can not keep
count and have fought against the
specter of anti-intellectualism my
whole life. So, I find myself in the
awkward position of defending
Forrest Gump from Sam Adams' vicious critique in the February 24th
issue of ThePhoenix. I feel so moved
because I believe that Adams' re-marks reveal, among other things,
some of the reasons the Republicans
won the 1994congressional elections.
Adams has set himself up for this
by associating Gump with Joesph
McCarthyand Jesse Helms who "have
risen to power by exploiting the average American's fear that somebody,
somewhere, thinks he's smarter than
they are." Adams has adeptly captured a key element of conservative
strategy with this statement. He, however, falls into the modern left/liberal
view of merely seeing such sentiments as baseless grievances of the
ignorant and irrational masses. After
all, even demagogues need actual
grievances to tap into.
The reaction ofcertain left/liberals

interfering in the space/time continuum.
Rather, I think Gump was successful because it tapped into more positive emotions that Adams himself puts
down. "Entire historical epochs are
reduced to obvious musical references
and details taken out of context."

Again, this is not Ken Burns' Civil
War. It's a movie that baby boomers
enjoyed because it walked them
through the defining moments of their

lives and made them remember their
youth. As an 80's child who grew up
idolizing 60's icons like the Kennedy
brothers and John Lennon, I found
this particularly enjoyable. Adams
seems to be worrying that people
watch Gump and decide that PBS and
the NEA are unnecessary. He seems
to be placing his own concerns in the
minds of the average American. The
only people who are really concerned
about government sponsorship of the
arts are conservative elites.
Finally, there is the question of the
true message of the movie. Was it
telling you to be stupid?Indeed, Gump
is so "dumb" that he does not understand racism and helps a black women
integrating the University ofAlabama
to pick up her books. Gump's low IQ,
however, does not stop him from loving his sweetheart, Jenny, and risking
his life to save his best friend in
Vietnam.Forrest's lack of intelligence
does not prevent from living a fulfilled life as a worthy human being. I
certainly did not feel the film was a
promotion for anti-intellectualism.
The movie showed that if you are
decent person you will be rewarded.
Is that such a dangerous message?
There was no deep message embedded in the movie. People like
Adams who read a huge social commentary into the film are a bit on the
paranoid side. He says that anti-intellectualism is baseless, and then proceeds to tell everyone who enjoyed
the movie that they enjoyed it for the
wrong reasons. As long as people in
his position despise every movie and
form of popular entertainment the
American public enjoys, Newt
Gingrich and his pals will continue to
have a field day.

political humor; after all, we take
plenty of shots at Clinton—just look
at the Conservative Union's board
for proof of that.
Schenk claims

that the College
Democrats called
the Republican

welfare platform
"evil"
and
"scary," which
leads him to

crats] really are

form this semester, I don't doubt that
they would get a much greater turnout this time.As for Schenk's insinuation that the liberals or Democrats
against welfare cuts did not attend
the speech, several College Democrats did indeed go to hear Star Parker

speak, and his claim that she "is one
of the most exciting contributors to
the welfare debate today" is disputable, as is the GOP's welfare platform in general.
I agree wholeheartedly with
Schenk that not enough people are
informed about the issues they claim
to stand for, but these people fall on
both ends of the political spectrum.
Knee-jerk conservatism is hardly the
most meritable response toknee-jerk

liberalism.
Schenk demonstrated by his attack
on College Democrats, a group that
has been striving to promote dialogue on campus, his own bias in
labeling liberals as the only ones on
this campus who are ignorant and

intolerant. Schenk conveniently ignores in his article the College Democrats efforts in initiating debates with
the Conservative Union, such as the
one on the Contract With America's
welfare reform plan, which will take
place the second week after break.
'

Schenk,. furthermore, overlooks

the spirit of bipartisanship that College Democrats has exhibited in attending conferences with the Conservative Union,
such as the First
spending Amendment Coalition in New York

Instead of
so much time and
energy complaining
about the ignorance
on campus, the Conservatives should try
to dispel it...

when it comes to

discussing this
complex issue." Schenk expounds
upon the CollegeDemocrats' alleged
narrow-mindedness by pointing oul
that less than thirty people attended
the speech on welfare reform given
by conservative speaker Star Parker
last fall.
It seems a bit of a stretch to equate
a low attendance for one speaker at
Swarthmore to a narrow-minded and
intolerant College Democrat group
and college community. For a campus that is overstressed and busy, a
campus that turned out only about
twenty-five people to hear Sara
Nichols, a congressional candidate,
and about six people to hear Michael
McCurry, Clinton's Press Secretary,
conservatives need not feel personally affronted that their speaker did
not pack the house.

Schenk continues with this Star
Parker point, criticizing the organizers of last month's letter-writing event
against welfare cuts by writing: "Are
they aware of the arguments in favor
of reforming, or even ending, the
welfare system?... If so, they missed
an excellent opportunity last semester when Ms. Parker spoke here."
Schenk accuses these people ofmissing a lecture last fall when their actions this semester are probably
largely in response to the Republicans' reactionary welfarere form plan,
which did not become an impending

last fall. He also
disregards our efforts to promote

political dialogue
and activity on
campus, such as
providing for the
voting shuttle last
fall, whose efforts
and costs were

taken on entirely
by the CollegeDemocrats. These are
hardly actions of a group seeking to
silence or ignore their opposition.
Schenk does a great disservice to a
group on campus which may be ideologically opposed to his, but which
strives for the same dialogue he so
strongly espouses.
Instead of spending so much time
and energy complaining about the
ignorance on campus, the conservatives should try to dispel it, and the
first step is recognizing that ignorance knows no party lines. The conservatives should also stop blaming
their possible ineffectiveness or unpopularity on campus (such as with
Star Parker's turnout) on the "narrow-mindedness" of the community.
They ought to recognize the difference between disagreement and intolerance, and, as Neal Potischman
effectively critiqued in his article in
ThePhoenix last week, they ought to
spend more of their energy on trying
to change our minds effectively than
offering knee-jerk responses of their
own and on complaining that we
aren't listening.
Frankly, we can handle dialogue;
we welcome it, and we are listening—we just might not like what you
are saying. Schenk and his fellow
conservatives need to address their
own ineffectiveness at diffusing their
message, and perhaps start pointing
fingers at themselves for once.

Not really stealing; just liberating the food
By Joe Khan, Nick Lehmann
and Phil Spector
On Wednesday, Mike Scott '97
had just come out of a lab which had
gone an hour over.
He arrived at Tarble at 8:03 PM,
leaving 180 seconds between a
$3.50 dinner and a $2.25 snack.
Damn. So, he looked at his options
on the menu. He finally resolved
that since French Fries cost $l.OO,
and Fingers & Fries costs $2.75, he
should be able to squeeze by with
just the Fingers on his $2.25. No
such luck.
"You're over."

Resisting the urge to reply with
"it ain't over till it's over baby," he
pleaded with the cashier. Needless
to say, Mike's arguments were in
vain; he was told to walk back
inside, return the chicken fingers
and instead retrieve a Tastykake and
Elliot's juice. As he turned to
return, the bomb dropped:
"We don't allow backpacks in
there."
He turned in shock. He was being
told that he wasn't trusted enough to
carry a bag inside the food area?
This was insult upon injury.
Grinding his teeth, he quietly
-errioved the back pack and reentered Essie Mae's. This, he
resolved, means war.
So, let the battle begin. The sign
in Tarble forbidding backpacks is
one that treats students like criminals. Fine. If students are to be told
that they are not allowed to bring
back packs into Essie's because they
might hide stolen food inside them,

then we are making it our personal
mission to teach Mike and students
like him on this campus how to steal
stuff from Tarble without using a
bag/backpack/pocketbook. Fear not,
Swatties
your Unscrupulous
Uncles are here to help with ten
quick and easy tips to stealing junk
from Tarble.

1) Phoenix Special
The "Phoenix Special," as we call it,
is the perfect way to double your
Essie Mae's breakfast pleasure!
Walk up to the grill, grab two
Phoenixes. Unwrap both. Take the
eggs, cheese and bacon from one
sandwich and stuff it in the other.
Then wrap the extra english muffin
in the wasted wrapper and hide it
somewhere behind some packaged
goods.
Wrap your "Phoenix
Special" back up, and walk out with
a double decker breakfast sandwich

on credit.

2) Free

Pretty basic idea here.

If you're

really thirsty, especially if you're
waiting in line, there's absolutely no
need to pay for your beverage.

Simply fill up your paper cup as
many times as you like and drink to
your heart's content. Whatever you
do, do not leave Essie's until you
have finished drinking. Then, hide
your cup somewhere behind some
more packaged goods.

3) Popcorn Pocket
The microwave popcorn in Tarble is
ideal for smuggling. It's nice and
two-dimensional, and fits really easily inside your pants pocket without
the cashier noticing. Steal one popcorn with each meal, and by
Thursday night, you have enough to
throw a movie study break on your
hall.

Tasty Sharples Recipe

tic carryout boxes.

5) The Club
Imitations

The club sandwich is like two sandwiches in one; instead of four pieces
of bread, it has three. So, what happens when you can't afford that
extra layer of sandwich? Simply
order yourself a club. Then, before
walking over to the cashier, pull out
the middle piece of bread, shove it in
your jacket and walk innocently
over to the cashier. If all goes well,
she will do nothing more than marvel at your packed sandwich. As she
does, pocket some chocolate pretzels from the candy bin.

6) Palming
Before walking up to the cashier
with your plate of turkey melt and
chips, grab a donut, place it on your
palm, tucked safely underneath the
plate. If the cashier happens to
notice the donut stuck to the bottom
of your plate and asks, "What's
that?" Look her in the eye, and
reply cooly "It's a donut. What's
the problem?"

7) I can't believe it's not

10) Keep on truekin'
This one is the most natural impulses of all. When you emerge from
Essie Mae's and you see the cashier,
make a hard sharp 45 degree left.
Pretending as if you have done nothing wrong, keep walking. Do not
stop until you reach Parrish

Parlours.

The problem of shoplifting at
Tarble does exist, but it exists for a
reason. Students on limited budgets
faced with an unfair meal plan are
likely to leave morality along with
their backpacks at the door. It is not
that Swarthmore students are kleptomaniac by nature; they are just hungry-

Though our tricks are pulled on

the Essie Mae's staff, our frustration is not directed at them. The
cashiers are simply doing the job
they are forced to do, and we doubt
that they take any perverse pleasure
in watching students starve. Our
anger is with the administration.

The adminstration requires on-campus students to subscribe to one
meal plan. Fine. But if we have to
be on the meal plan, then it should

be a fair one.

In spite of campus-wide dissatisfaction, no long term solution has
been implemented. If the administration has come to the conclusion
that the meal plan cannot be made
more fair, then it should at least
allow us the dignity of opting not to
subscribe to it. Until then, Mike
Scott and students like him will continue to use their pockets to express
their dissatisfaction with donuts and
Pepsi for dinner.

Like many Swatties, we happen to
like potato chips and french fries for
their merits as camoflauge gear.
Example: After getting your fingers
and fries, walk over to the freezer.
Grab a Dove Bar, stick it underneath
your fries, and if any part of the
wrapper is still visible, coat that area
with ketchup. It may be a littly
messy, but it's a great value deal.

can hide underneath them.

Wharton Business School, gets
elected to Congress, or blends into
the Rugby team and DU, here's our
solution to the quagmire of What to
Do With the Phi Psi House.™
"What to do with the Phi Psi
house?" has been one of the most
perplexing questions of modern
times, rivaled only by the enigma of
"Where is all the SAC money
going?" Since we now know that the
answer to the latter question is clearly Alice's wardrobe, this opens up a
whole new bag of worms and unresolved dilemmas. For instance,
where the hell is she going to find a
shoe rack to fit ten grand worth of
shoes? The answer is right under our
noses. The Phi Psi house, of course.
OK. So some of you are saying,
"Well, that's perfectly fine for this
semester, but what happens next
semester as the shoe stash increases?
There's no way the Phi Psi house is
big enough." Maybe that's true,
which brings us neatly to contingency plan number two. Use it as a

peace offering for the arsonist.
As the old adage says, "If you
can't use it, bum it." Sure, we made
it up, but one day it may be an old
adage. Besides, it seems like a couple of you over in Parrish are getting
a little antsy over the idea of being

roasted alive by some dissatisfied
Swattie. For you we have one word.
APPEASEMENT. Throw her/him a
bone and maybe s/he won't bite, or
burn. It worked in Munich...uh,
oops.
There's a slight hole in the argument. Never fear. There's still plan
number three. The one major weakness we've noticed in the women's
center is that very few keg-stands go
on there. Female alcoholics need a
voice on campus, too. They're a
very marginalized community.

Why You Should
Skip It: Just 'Cause
By Dave Rich

You'd think that a film starring Sean
Connery, Kate Capshaw, Laurence
Fishbume, Ed Harris, and Blair Underwood
couldn't fail. Think again. Just Cause dies
before it even starts and never gets resuscitated. Stop reading if you want to see this
film because I'm going to give it away; but
I recommend reading this and sparing yourself the pain....
Blair Underwood plays an educated
Black man from southern Florida who gets
arrested for the murder of an 11-year old
white girl. His confession is beaten out of
him, he claims. Eight years of sitting on
death row have convinced him that he needs
to retry his case. Another inmate (Ed

where he got castrated by crooked cops.
The cast really is pretty good. It's nice to
see Capshaw doing films again, instead of
just showing up at Oscar time next to her

husband, Steven Spielberg. Fishbume does

job convincing us that he's a bad
guy, only to be vindicated at the end.
Connery is... just ok, really. His character is
too small and seems suppressed. Ed Harris,
though, is awesome as the psycho-nutbag;
really over the top.
The film fell apart somewhere in the
script, though... like the beginning. It never
gets started. There is nothing going on, no
action, no courtroom drama, nothing. The
suspense does pick up for about ten minutes
near the end, I have to admit, but it!s a real
let down when it is all wrapped up.
Hey, that's still ten minutes more suspense than say...Highlander HI.
It's a real shame about this flick. The
trailer made it look like it might have been
alright, but they fooled us. It's a train wreck
of a movie, and only gets mini-weenies, a

Harris), who happens to be a major nutcase
(the latest attempt to replay Hannibal

Lector), admits that he killed the girl. Sean
Connery plays the liberal, Harvard professor
who hasn't practiced law in 25 years, but
takes this case to save another innocent man
from the electric chair. Kate Capshaw plays
his wife, who (as it turns out), tried
Underwood's character in Florida 20 years
ago. Laurence Fishbume is the bad cop who
supposedly beat the tar out of Underwood
for a confession.

Reviews of Blidge's My Life and Hathaway's A Moment
By Tanya G. Wiggins,
alias DJ. Brooklyn

Mary J. Bilge, My Life, MCA(R & B). Released the latter
part of 1994, the thirdrelease of Mary J. Blige has brought everyone
to their feet. After "What's the 411? The Remixes," I didn't expect
this album to go much farther until I heard it for myself.
Fueled with hard core beats from yesterday and today, this LP has
a great arrangement of hot dance beats and sultry ballads. You'll be
pleasantly surprised by many of the sampling choices, coming from
both the '7os and 'Bos. This is by far the smoothest album for Mary
yet, and definitely not a waste ofmoney. � � �
Lalah Hathaway, A Moment, Virgin (Jazz/R &B). This is
the second release for Lalah, daughter of the late Donny Hathaway of

'7os R &B fame. And again, she shows that her father's talent for
soulful music was inherited. On the first album, ballads seemed to be
her strength. Lalah comes back on her second album not only with
stronger, sweeter ballads, but also showing her versatility on funky
dance tracks like "Rise" and "Bad By Myself." This is an LP you can
play from beginning to end, and not be disappointed. � � �

year for the first time in 18 years and looks to return this season. The Garnet opened
the season last Saturday with convincing victories over Millersville and Kutztown.

The result was nearly a clean sweep of their
Northern Pennsylvania opponents as
Swarthmore won 6-1 over Millersville in the
morning and beat Kutztown 7-0 in the afternoon.
Coach Mike Mullan mixed up the lineups in

The men's team generally plays one of the
toughest schedules in Division 111, most of their
matches coming against nationally ranked opponents or Division I programs. The matches
last Saturday were a way to experiment with
different lineups before the Garnet men play
more challenging opponents, says Ciunci.
"At this early stage of the season we're just
trying to figure out where people are going to fit
in," explained Ciunci. 'The team is bigger than
normal this year and we can use these matches
to give everyone a little experience early on."
The 1995 Swarthmore men's team, top heavy
with five seniors, hopes toreturn to the 12 team
NCAA National Tournament after missing the
cut for the first time in 18 years last year.
"Our goal is definitely to get back to the
tourney, or 'big dance' as we call it in the tennis
world," mused Ciunci. "I think that we've got
the desire.'the players, and the winning attitude
that it takes to get there."

Zengerle Looks Ahead to March Madness and Hoyas
By Jason Zengerle

By the skin of our teeth, it's March ... and
it's hard to discount the importance of this
month in our nation's history. Let's see, we've
got Saint Patrick's Day, Gabe "Welcome Back
Kotter" Kaplan's birthday (March 31 if you're

For without college basketball and the NCAA
tournament (a.k.a March
Madness for you neophytes out there), where
would the United States
be as a nation?
feeling festive), Fatty Arbuckle Day in 49
states save Arizona, and
March Madness.
Of course, the former three are important, but
it is the latter that concerns us most, for without college basketball and the NCAATournament (a.k.a. March Madness for you neophytes out there), where would the U.S. be as
a nation? A question almost too scary to ask,
but one that we must in our dogged pursuit of
truth, justice, and the Fatty way. So without
any further ado, ladies and gentlemen....
Not Your Average Joe: In my lastcolumn I
declared thatNorth Carolina sophomore Jerry
Stackhouse was the best player in college
basketball, in the sense that he had the most
potential to excel at the next level. In this
column I'll argue that Maryland sophomore
Joe Smithis thebest college basketball player.
When I say that Smith is the best college
basketball player in the land, I'm merely stating that at the college level, in the college
game, there is no player better than Smith. As
a pro Smith will likely be a star, but his domi...

nation of the college game will likely not carry
over into the NBA. A 6'10" center who came
out of Norfolk, Virginia two years ago as a
relatively unheralded recruit, Smith hasproven
himself to be a monster player for Terrapin
coach Gary Williams.
Smith plays the game with a sense of poise
and maturity thatis rare for a player of his age
and position. Simply put, Smith does not make
mistakes. While many college stars who play
the pivotposition force shot after shot, bricking
every one, against collapsing zones, Smith
wisely passes the ball out to open teammates
when facing a double team. When presented
with an open shot, or a single defender, Smith
will shoot and he will normally make it. His
rebounding is formidable and his shot-blocking skills hinder opponents.
Three-and-a-half years ago I saw Joe Smith
in a summer all-star gamebefore his senior year
in high school. He was a gawky kid who, while
playing a nice game against a tough group of
D.C. high school all-stars, seemed a bit softand
a tad uncoordinated.The word was that he was
going to Maryland, and while no one was angry
at Williams for his recruitment of Smith, few
people were overly excited. While Smith's
Virginia all-star squad took a victory, it was in
large part due to a junior-to-be phenom point
guard named Allen Iverson. He was the player
who was remembered from that day. Now,
both are excelling at the college level, but it
goes without saying that Smith is playing the
college game at the highest echelon.
Whose Title Is It? While I hate to jump the
gun and give away my Tournament picks before the actual draw and my eagerly anticipated
next column, I feel a little speculation might be
kind of fun. So who's going to win the big
dance this year? Dunno for sure, but I have got
a few ideas..
There really are no dominant teams in this
year's college basketball field, as there were in
past years with Arkansas, North Carolina,

Michigan, Duke, and UNLV. What we have
this year is a truly wide open field, and a group
of about ten or eleven teams that have legitimate title hopes. If I had to pick an odds-on
favorite in the Tournament, I'd have a hard
time not dubbing North Carolina as my team.
While theTarheels are rather thin (they only go
about three deep off the bench) their starting
five is unmatched. The super sophomores
Stackhouse and Rasheed Wallace are
complimented quite nicely by fellow sophomore point guard Jeff McGinnis, senior scorer
Donald Williams, and the unheralded but extremely talented Dante Callibria. If Dean
Smith's troops don't run out of gas, they're a
formidable bunch.
Picking NorthCarolina as my favorite, however, should not lead you to believe that they
are head and shoulders above the competition.
There are any number of teams that have a
legitimate shot at the title. At the front of that
list are Kansas, Connecticut, UCLA, Arizona,

Massachusetts, Maryland, and Virginia. Throw
in the likes of Kentucky, Arkansas, Michigan
State, Syracuse, Villanova, and Georgetown
(yes, Georgetown!), and we have one of the
most wide open fields in years. It should be a
fun show to watch.
Happiness is Georgetown Basketball: I
would feel remiss if I didn't mention the past
week that my mighty Hoyas enjoyed. After
ending a four game skid by beating Providence
two Saturdays ago, Georgetown greeted streaking Villanova, proud owners of an eleven game
winning streak including a twenty point road
victory over then number one Connecticut.
Needless to say, the Hoyas dispatched of the
Wildcats in a route, as Iverson dazzled the
ESPN national television audience with his
speed and sound play. On Sunday, the Hoyas
traveled to Syracuse for another national television match-up, this time against the
Orangemen. Syracuse has been a sight ofmuch
heart-break for Hoya fans like myself, and

when they came out of the Carrier Dome with
a three point victory, I felt like happy days were
here again.
Now I might just be intoxicated with joy, but
if Georgetown plays as it did Sunday against
Syracuse (when Iverson and the previously-

Georgetown has a realistic shot of sticking
around until the first weekend of April.

Track Finishes Season
with Meet at Haverford
By Jill Wildonger

Last weekend, the conference track
meet at HaverfordCollege began with

the Swarthmore team's high anticipation for top finishes in race and
field events. After the track was unlocked for the early-arriving Swarthmore runners, the team followed the
sage advice of co-captain Sam
Paschel '96 and used the extra time to
visualize their upcoming races.
The first gun went off for the
5000m—22 grueling laps around the
red, plastic Haverford oval. Running
the 5000 m was frosh Shoshana
Pearlman, who upset a top Haverford
runner and placed an exciting second. As Pearlman circled, Shan
Sutherland '97 slipped in a smooth
third place finish in the pole vault.

Athletes of the Week
Barry Mook '96
With a clean sweep ofhis threematches this past Saturday, Barry Mook
'96 is our men's athlete of the week. Mook didn't drop a set last weekend
as the men's tennis team cruised to victories over Millersville and
Kutztown State. Against Millersville, Mook singlehandedly carried his
doubles team to an 8-1 victory at number two doubles.
Mook's partner, Chris Pearson '95 remarked, "Without Barry, we
wouldn't have won." Against Kutztown State, Mook started at number
one singles, coasting to a 6-4, 6-2 victory behind the strength of his
blazing serve. In doubles, he and Jeremy Shweder '95 blanked their
Kutztown State opponents 8-0.
This weekend was especially difficult. According to Mook's teammates, the matcheslastSaturday were more or less a chance to experiment
with various lineups before facing tougher opposition

Freshman Danielle Duffy joined the Swarthmore track team as a
sprinter, never having run an open 400m. But, her talent was soon
recognized by Coach Ted Dixon, and Duffyplaced easily first in the 400
in the ConferenceMeet. Duffy anchored the conference-winning 4x400m
team and placing a strong second in the 200m. In an earlier season meet
she broke the 200 m school record with a time of 27.84. She is also a
member of the school-record-breaking 4x400 team with a 60.9 split.
Danielle, a quiet, soft-spoken soul, admits that the 200 meter is her
favorite race and the Boston University track, with its raised platform and
incredibly banked surface, is the neatest indoor oval she's cruised this
season.

Last weekend, Swarthmore's wrestling team traveled to Ursinus College to compete in the NCAA Division 111 Regional Qualifier Tournament. Winners of this annual two day
meet, which included twenty teams
from the Centennial and Middle Atlantic Conferences, qualify to compete in the national wrestling championship tournament.The tournament
will be held this year at Augustana
College in Augustana, Illinois.
Although the Garnetdidnothave a
particularly strong overall showing
in this highly competitive tournament,
Swarthmore wrestlers did provide
some outstanding performances.
At 167 pounds, co-captain Eric
Williams '95 finished third with an
impressive 4-2 record in the tournament. Pete Balvanz '9B also turned in
another respectable performance in
the 142 pound weight class. Balvanz
placed sixth in the tournament,breaking even at 3-3 overall. He commented on his performance, saying,
"It was respectable, but I had hoped
to do a lot better."
About the tournament in general,
Balvanz added that, "It was the toughest meet of the year. The competition
was at a much higher level."
