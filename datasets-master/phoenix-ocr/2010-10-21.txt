Garnet Weekend invites alumni and
families in autumn for the first time
BY GAIL ENGMANN

gengmanl@swarthmore.edu

Amidst the fall foliage, crisp
autumn air and post-break excitement, this weekend, the college will
extend its welcoming hand to those in
its larger community and host hun-

dreds of families and alumni. For the
first time in college history, family
and alumni have been invited to see
the campus in the height of the fall
season and bring back a real home-

coming.
According to Stephen Bayer, vice
president of development and alumni

relations, the purpose of Garnet
Weekend is to foster pride and spirit.
"We want people to realize the special
nature of this place, in terms of academics, athletics and spirit," Bayer
said. Garnet Weekend will welcome
families and alumni while the school
year is in full swing and the campus is
adorned with lavish fall splendor.
In the past, Swarthmore has hosted
Family and Friends Weekend in the
spring and a separate reunion weekend for alumni in June after the students have left campus. According to
Bayer, the creation of Garnet
Weekend came about for two main
reasons. The first is that spring is an
incredibly busy time for students and
the program proved too hectic with
everyone's schedules. The second is
that parents were beginning to
request that they see their kids earlier
in the school year. Bayer noted that
having alumni also come this weekend allows them to see the campus
while students are still here and see
themselves in the students, which is a
rare experience.
Janessa Esquivel 'l3, however, disapproves of the timing.
"I think that it was weird that it's
only a week after Fall Break. If you
went home for the week, you probably
wouldn't really miss your parents
yet," Esquivel said.
Esquevil said her parents will not
be coming.
Dan Spagnolo 'l3, however, said his
mother, who did not come last year,
will come this year since he was
unable to go home during Fall Break.
Other students, like Nicole Cox 'l2,
don't think the time will matter for
students.
"I'm not sure what attendance will
be like. I don't think a lot of students
have a lot of strong opinions about the
weekend in general, so I don'tknow if
it will really be a big deal on campus,"
Cox said.
Nevertheless, Bayer thinks this
weekend is perfect since it coincides
with the emergence of fall colors on
trees around campus. "We take for
granted the beauty of this place,"
Bayer said. "And for the first time
alumni will be able to come back and
relive fond memories of walking
through the Crum as the leaves are

changing".
The planning for this weekend
began in the spring and, due to the
nature of having less hectic schedules

in the fall, the organizers were
allowed to be more creative in planning the events. Associate Director of
Parents Programs,
Melissa M.
Pizarro, said she felt that she was
given more room to breathe while
planning this event. "It enabled us to
be creative with programming,
including fascinating faculty discussions and great athletic events,"
Pizarro said.
The events range from academics
and art to campus life, sports games
and tours. Some highlights include
the President's reception, the pep
rally, the McCabe lecture and the
Crum Regatta.
On Friday evening President
Rebecca Chopp and Dean of Students
Liz Braun will welcome parents and
alumni and answer any questions
they may have about life and academics at Swarthmore.
It will also be a time for parents to
meet professors and get to know the
faculty. Chopp and Braun also continue their accessibility to the visitors
throughout the weekend by conducting open conversations that will entail
introducing members of the administration and demonstrating how they
facilitate the student's college experience.
Visitors to campus will also be
encouraged to come out at the pep
rally on Friday night.
The rally will include music, games
and student performances geared at
not only getting the student body
revved up for an array of sport games
over the weekend, but also showing

the visitors a taste of the Garnet spirit.
A McCabe lecture is also scheduled
for this weekend. The event is already
more popular than planned. With 400
visitors signed up to attend, the organizers were forced to move the event to
LPAC. "We're thrilled to have Cindi
Leive 'BB, who's the editor in chief of
Glamour magazine, with us," Bayer
said. "She's a very dynamic, high profiled person, and we expect to have a
large turn out."
In keeping with tradition, the annual Crum Regatta will also take place
this Saturday. Students have been
charging the Crum waters with
makeshift floats since 1972 and this
year will be no different. Pizarro
noted that boat submissions are still
being accepted from any group of students who would like to register their
floating device into the competition.
Prizes will also be awarded, including
for best use of materials and best costume, and the organizers hope that the
event will be a great time for everyone
attending.
According to Bayer, this weekend
will be a time to raise spirit amongst
alumni and provide families with an
opportunity to see Swarthmore's
inner workings. Bayer also encouraged students to get involved with the
events by coming to lectures, picnics

and sports games. This is a weekend
that involves the whole community,
which Pizarro is hoping will continue
to grow throughout the years.

New group tries to
help students fit in

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

Andrew Cheng Phoenix Staff

Sixteen Feet and John Hopkins' comedy a capella group The Mental Notes perform on
Friday the Bth.

Swarthmore can be a place where
quirky high schoolers hope to come
into their own and make friends
who have similar interests. For
some, this becomes reality, but others are left struggling, unable to
find their niche within the
Swarthmore Bubble. Karen Henry,
dean of the classes of 2013 and 2014,
and Daniel Livney, a clinical intern
with Counseling and Psychological
Services, hope that a new group
they are forming will help those
who find themselves on the outskirts of Swarthmore. "There needs
to be room for students like this,
who find that this isn't what they
had hoped." Henry said.
The group, which is unnamed, is
geared toward first-year students,
but will be open to anyone who feels
left out socially. An e-mail advertising the group was sent to first-years,
sophomores and juniors.
Henry said, "I've had the experience of being the first-year dean two
years in a row, and I think that
there are students who are struggling in silence over not feeling like
and as a somethey're fitting in
body who's trained as a therapist, I
thought, I love groups, personally,
and I think they can be very powerful." She said she is concerned
about those students who find difficulty in making social connections,
and wants the group to help them.
She believes that for students who
face these challenges, talking to people with similar issues can be very
helpful.
Livney, who is entering his second year with CAPS, realized the
power groups hold while working
on his dissertation. "They can be a
useful way for people to feel connected to one another, and to learn
about what makes us all both different and alike," he said in an e-mail.
"As an intern at CAPS, it's no surprise that I'm a strong believer in
the value of individual psychotherapy. [But] I felt that there were things
that could be done with groups
more readily than with one-on-one
therapy, and this was one of those
types of problems."
Though Speak 2 Swatties has run
groups, workshops and events for
the emotional and mental health of
students, CAPS does not manage
any. Most of the existing groups of
that nature are managed by the
dean's office, and include the
Swarthmore Wellness Advisory
Team (SWAT Team), Acquaintance
Sexual Assault Prevention (ASAP)
and
the
Sexual
Misconduct
Advisors' and Resource Team
(SMART Team). Because of the
deans' office's experience with coordinating these groups, Livney contacted Henry toward the end of the
last academic year.
Henry said, "As the first-year
dean, there are a number of students who always come to my attention. Either they come to my atten...

tion because they come to my office
asking me to fill out forms because
they're interested in transferring or
they come to my attention because
they've been talking to other people,
such as parents and RAs
about
their struggles." Henry hopes that
providing a place for frustrated or
lonely students on campus will help
them overcome the difficulty of connecting with new people.
The group, which will meet once
a week for five weeks, will focus on
helping the individual students
learn strategies that have worked
for other people, and discussing the
specific difficulties the members
feel they are experiencing. Its first
meeting will be this week, but at
press time, an exact date had not
been set. Though the meetings will
be closed for the privacy of the students, new members will be accepted after the initial meeting, if they
express interest.
Henry said some upper-class students have contacted her in order
to offer to act as resources for the
younger students, but nearly all the
people interested in being in the
group are first-year students. So far,
11 people replied with "questions
and interest," according to Henry.
"We're very happy with [the]
...

response."

The Phoenix approached eight

first-years, none of whom said they

would be interested in joining. Dan
Cho 'l3 said that he probably would
not have joined such a group. "It
might be helpful for some people,
but I think it might have been kind
of an awkward thing to talk about. I
mean, what do you say? 'Sorry, I've
got to go now, I've got a meeting
about making friends'?"
Will Hopkins 'll, an RA, liked the
idea of the group, but had doubts
about how successful it will be,
"I think it's a great idea, but it
seems like the sort of thing that I
don't know if all the freshmen
would use it," Hopkins said. "I think
students who are already pretty outgoing are more likely to use something like that, so I don't know if it
would get the sort of people who are
more likely to want more friends."
Livney expects that the group
itself will be a help for its members.
"Sometimes, just figuring out that
other people are in the same situation that you are in, and also hearing ideas from other students about
what their experiences are can be
helpful. Part of the job Karen and I
see for ourselves is to just help that
conversation along," he said.
Hopkins observed that the social
atmosphere first-years are first
introduced to might not be conducive to friendships for everyone.
"A lot of freshmen's social lives are
sort of arbitrarily assigned. You
have your CA group, and you have
your hall. [As RAs] we try to build
hall life, but it's great to have other
things outside these semi-arbitrary
groups that are designed to give students a chance to get to know each
other."

New consortium to study
family, child development
BY AARON FREEDMAN
afreedml@swarthmore.edu

For some Psychology students at
Swarthmore, it may be frustrating that
no school in the Tri-Co offers a Child &
Family Studies major or concentration.
However, this may soon change thanks
to the newly formed Tri-Co Child and
Family Studies Consortium.
The Consortium, currently in its initial planning phase, was created with
the help of a Mellon Tri-Co Seed Grant
applied for by faculty from Haverford,
Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore. According
to Swarthmore psychology professor
Jane Gillham, the purpose of the
Consortium is to "support a series of
meetings/conversations about Child and
Family Studies." An informative e-mail
about the group, sent to the student body
a few weeks ago, stated that, "Interests
of the group are wide-ranging, including
cross-cultural perspectives, advocacy,
approaches to research, inter-professional collaboration, and linkages
between family, school, learning, and

opportunity."
Currently, the nascent Consortium is
working on two main projects
speaker series and brainstorming sessions as
well as development of a possible Tri-Co
Child & Family Studies major or con,

centration.
On the. latter topic, students are
enthusiastic. "I absolutely support the
idea of a Swarthmore Child and Family
Studies major," psychology major
Katherine Ernst 'l2 said in an e-mail. "I
think that it spans a fascinatingly wide
range of academic fields, ranging from
soci-anth to educational studies to psychology to history to political science, as
well as being a valid stand-alone subject
with which to create a major."
Other students agree with Ernst's
sentiment. "I would definitely support

Swarthmore/the Tri-Co offering a Child
and Family Studies major or concentration because it's a fascinating subject
and can lend itself to very specialized
job opportunities, like family counselor
or
child psychologist,"
Miriam
Goldstein 'l3, a potential Psychology
major, said.
Maya Marzouk 'l3 also supported a
Child and Family Studies program. "It
would 100 percent definitely be my
major."

For other students interested in.the
Consortium and the possible Child and
Family Studies major, the Consortium
will be holding an open brainstorming
session on November 2nd. And, on
November 12th, an anthropology professor from Utah State University will be
giving a lecture on child development at
Haverford.
Still, many students, even those taking psychology, don't know much about
the Consortium yet. "I remember getting
an e-mail a few weeks ago," remarked
Kyle Krainock the e-mail sent out to students about the Consortium.
Child and Family Studies majors are
not common in most colleges and universities for undergraduates, especially
those of Swarthmore's size.
There are some notable exceptions,
like the B.S. program offered by
Gallaudet University, a university for
the hearing-impaired in Washington
D.C., and California State UniversityLong Beach.
However, many schools do offer
Masters programs in Child and Family
Studies, thus offering a postgraduate
path for Psychology majors interested in
the subject.
For now though, students who want
to pursue child development in the TriCo will be limited to these few talks and
programs. But, as the Consortium and
interest in it grows, so will its offerings.

Drug ring member sentenced at PSU
ZACH GEIGER

dailycollegian.psu.edu Oct. 20, 2010
A State College man received five to
10 years in state prison for his involvement in a local cocaine ring run out of
his former gas station.
Greg Palazzari, 54, of 2243 Bristol
Ave., was sentenced on three felony drug
charges Monday, Centre County District
Attorney Stacy Parks Miller wrote in an
e-mail. Palazzari was arrested Aug. 21,
2009 at his former gas station, Greg's
Sunoco, 605 University Dr., after officers
from the Centre County Drug Task Force
surrounded the location.
After conducting a two-month investigation, police determined that Mario
Rincon, 28, of 621 Elmwood St., sold the
cocaine to Palazzari.
Palazzari bought an ounce of cocaine
from Rincon every three days, according
to court documents. Police said
Palazzari sold about $50,000 worth of
cocaine per month throughout State
College.
The state's request to seize control of
Palazzari's gas station was granted by
Centre County Judge Bradley Lunsford
in Sept. 2009.

The two other men involved in the
case Rincon and his roommate, Curtis
Vonada
were previously sentenced
for their involvement in the drug traf-

ficking operation.
Rincon is serving an aggregate sentence of 10 to 20 years, Centre County
District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller
said in September. He turned himself in
on Aug. 25, 2009 after a four-day manhunt and was found guilty on one count
of fleeing or attempting to elude an officer and five counts of delivery of
cocaine, Parks Miller said.
Vonada fled following Palazzari's
arrest.
A former Centre County Correctional
Facility employee, Vonada was charged
with possession with intent to deliver a
controlled substance, felony conspiracy
and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance. In 2009 he pleaded
guilty in exchange for one year's proba-

Students drink more while abroad, study finds
BY ALEX NAWAR

DAILYFREEPRESS.COM OCT. 14, 2010
Students who go abroad absorb
every part of their adopted country's
culture, including its alcohol.
A recent study conducted by
researchers at U. Washington revealed
college students significantly increase
their alcohol consumption while
abroad.
The study, which was published in
the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors
journal on Monday, examined the
drinking habits of 177 UW students
before and after they studied abroad.
UW researchers found that students reported drinking more because
they observed other students in their
study abroad program drinking more,
and followed suit.
Students considered drinking

abroad an important aspect of cultural
immersion.
Students who participated in the
survey said they drank over twice as
much than they normally did at home
while abroad, which amounted to
about 10 drinks per week, according to
the study.
After returning home, they said
they resumed their normal drinking
habits of three to five drinks per week.
While
the
student
average
increased his or her alcohol consumption by 105 percent, students under the
age of 21 increased their drinking by
170 percent, the study said.
Joseph Finkhouse, the director of
institutional relations for Boston U's
study abroad programs, said "students' behavior abroad generally
reflects students' behavior at home."

'Pink Party' raises breast
cancer awareness in PSU
BY ANITA MODI

COLLEGIAN.PSU.COM, OCT. 19, 2010
While the guests seated around a
rectangular table at the Tapestry
Family Planning and Health Services'
Bellefonte office had heard of tea parties, no one had ever been to a "Pink
Party" before Monday afternoon.
Tapestry Family Planning, a nonprofit organization providing family
planning, sexual health, women's
health and community education
services
four
different
in
Pennsylvania locations, planned four
such Pink Parties this October—one
hosted by each of its offices.
Women in the local Centre region
were invited to partake in Monday's
Pink Party, held from 3 to 6 p.m.,
which featured a variety of activities
designed to raise awareness about
advancements in breast cancer
research and prevention.
This is not the first year the organization honored Breast
Cancer
Awareness Month, with previous
events including "complete busts"
according to Natalie Ferrigno, outreach coordinator for Tapestry
Family Planning.
"Last year, we had free clinical
breast exams, but no one showed up,"
Ferrigno said. "We decided to revamp
the event and make it sound less
scary. It's essentially a breast cancerthemed open house for each of our
four offices."
This year, guests were offered free
clinical breast exams and mammogram referrals and shared personal
family experiences over cookies, pretzels and pink lemonade.
Tapestry Family Planning staff
also gave a mini-lesson about six
steps women can take to prevent
breast cancer: learn your family history, learn your personal history, lead
a healthy lifestyle, go for routine clinical breast exams, conduct monthly
self exams and schedule routine mammograms.

Tfl^fKQE^

As a non-profit organization,
Tapestry Family Planning does what

it can to offer free exams and checkespecially those
ups to its patients
without insurance, Ferrigno said. But
as funding for a number of the clinic's
health programs and services has
been cut recently, nurses are further
stressing the importance of conducting regular self breast exams.
<reri Reeve, a representative of the
County
Centre
Breast
Cancer
Coalition who attended the Pink
Party Monday afternoon, said she
identified her first lump when conducting a self breast exam when she
was 28 and was soon diagnosed with
breast cancer. Thirteen years later,
she found another lump and was diagnosed again.
"My first thought was, 'They'd
made a mistake,'" Reeve said. "And if
the first diagnosis is bad, the second
one is devastating. But I had the same
attitude going into treatment for the
second time that I did the first—I had
a daughter at home and I needed to
survive."
At age 60, Reeve now works with
the American Cancer Society's Reach
to Recover group, Relay for Life and
Strides for Cancer to emphasize the
importance of self breast exams and
early detection to women all over the
nation.
The Pink Parties also served to promote the organization's new outreach
program, "Breast and Gynecological
Cancer Awareness" designed to make
women more aware of why routine
procedures such as Pap smears and
pelvic exams are necessary for maintaining sound health.
The clinic held its first Pink Party
on Oct. 13 at its Philipsburg office,
and plans to host two other events on
Oct. 19 and Oct. 21 at its Huntingdon
and Lock Haven offices, respectively.
The Pink Parties are free to attend,
but women are encouraged to R.S.V.P.
to the main office in Bellefonte beforehand.

showed the behavior of a small sample
of students and could not be used to
generalize the behavior of BU students while abroad.
Many of the more than 2,200 students who travel abroad through BU
travel to places where the drinking
age is under 21, he said.
"Our policy is that students are
bound by the laws of the country that
they're in," he said. "We're not going
to tell them that they can't drink, but
we like to emphasize that drinking
isn't necessarily part of the culture."
While the BU study abroad program sometimes has rules about alcohol consumption
in residences
abroad, the program does not attempt
to curb legal drinking in the host
country, Finkhouse said.
Alice Boudes, a senior in the
College of Communication who studied in Paris last Spring, said that there
was no pressure to drink more alcohol
because alcohol was readily available
everywhere. "I think people were
drinking about the same amount,"
said Boudes.
However, instead of drinking a lot
at once, students spread out their alcohol consumption over a longer period
of time, she said.
Alexa Fernandez, a senior in the

College of Arts and Sciences and COM,
had a similar experience when she
was studying abroad in Sydney last
fall.
"I guess I did drink more because I
could actually go out to the bars and
the program would provide alcohol at
events as well," she said.
Fernandez said that students
seemed to be more responsible while
drinking abroad, as they "would be
going to bars, not parties."
Both students agreed traveling
abroad changed their drinking habits
for the better.
"I learned to enjoy it," Boudes said.
"My program actually had a wine-tasting event during which we got to learn
how to drink, savor and recognize
wine properly."
Boudes swaid that binge drinking
seemed much more common in students in Boston than in Paris, regardless of their legal drinking status.
"My bosses would bring beers to
work and we would drink on the job,"
added Fernandez.
"They have a 'work hard, play hard'
lifestyle," she said.
According to the study, Europe,
Australia and New Zealand were the
countries where students' drinking
increased the most.

WRC joins discussions on modern hipster culture
BY DINA ZINGARO

dzingarl@swarthmore. edu

In the 1940 and 19505, hipsters were the black performers
of jazz and swing music. "Hip" referred to forms ofmusical
expression originated in African-American culture.
Though hipsters could be black or white, the term was later
predominantly used as a reference to whites who were aficionados of jazz. Considered groupies and members of the
Bohemian or Beat Generation, hipsters and their mellow,
laid-back attitude were cool and "hip."
Yet in contemporary subculture whetherfrom a fashion, artistic, or political perspective
the term "hipster" is
difficult to define. Perhaps one imagines the most cliche
conception of the hipster: meticulous hair, skinny pants
and black-rimmed glasses. But what lifestyle choices, political affiliations, music preferences, and style choices clearly identify someone as a hipster? Without a resolved set of
necessary characteristics, contemporary "hipsterism"
seems to resist categorization.
Amidst the pool of writers addressing the subject, N+l
magazine recently considered hipsterism as a sociological
trend in its Oct. 15 publication of "What Was the Hipster?"
Similarly, the college's Women's Resource Center considered contemporary hipsterism in an open discussion that
focused particularly on hipster racism and sexism. Both
hipster racism and sexism define humor inspired by the
hipster trend of rejecting or mocking the mainstream
because is it the "cool" thing to do. Thus, participants in
either behavior will often joke or accept offensive jokes
about people in the mainstream because it is the "in" thing
to do. AJ Plaid, an online blogger for "The Cruel
Secretary," defines hipster racism similarly as "ideas,
speech, and action meant to denigrate another's person
race or ethnicity under the guise of being urbane, witty,
educated, liberal, and/or trendy."
Along with web-only content, N+l bi-annually publishes
a print journal about politics, literature and culture.
Hoping to generate discussion about contemporary hipsterism, the magazine hosted a symposium at the New
School in New York City in April 2009. Following the conference, articles, responses, and essays were published and
printed in the pamphlet "What Was the Hipster?" In the
preface, editor of N +1 Mark Grief describes the investigation as a means "to find out if it is possible to analyze a subcultural formation [hipsterism] while it is still happening,
from the testimony of people who are close to it."
Printed immediately after the preface, his essay for the
conference, titled "Positions," considers both the historical
background of the term "hipster" and also proposes a variety of definitions of the contemporary hipster intended to
spark discussion.
Referring to the work of Anatole Broyard, Griefconsiders the hipster as the black subcultural figure of the late
19405. "Broyard insisted that black hipsterism was developed from a sense that black people in America were subject to decisions made about their lives by conspiracies of
power which held a monopoly of information and knowledge that they could never possibly know," Grief said. So,
the "hip" reaction of the black community was to insist,
purely symbolically, on forms of knowledge one knew
before anyone else, and knowledge independent of experience a priori knowledge.
Later in the 19505, the hipster was a white subcultural
figure inspired by "the desire of a white avant-garde to disaffiliate from whiteness," and achieve the cliched "cool"
knowledge of the African-American community. Beginning
in the 1980s, new subcultures such as the 1990's "neobohemia" and "indie-rock" cultures, emerged as alternatives to the success of consumer capitalism. So contemporary hipsterism, which is defined by its rejection of the
mainstream, emerges from a tradition of youth subcultures
that tried to remain independent of consumer culture.
Yet contemporary hipsterism, according to Grief, is
more complicated since it is defined as a subculture of people, but is currently quite dominant. Grief said, "The hipster is that person, overlapping with declassing or disaffiliating groupings
the starving artist, the starving graduate student, the neo-bohemian, the vegan or bicyclist or
skate punk, the would-be blue-collar or post-racial individual
who in fact alights himself both withrebel subculture and with the dominant class, and opens up a poison-

8

ous conduit between the two."
Also interested in the contemporary hipster ideology,
Women's Resource Center housesitter Yena Purmasir 'l4
organized the "Discussion of Hipster Racism and Sexism,"
which occurred on Sept. 22. In addition to running open
hours for the WRC, housesitters are responsible for facilitating weekly events. Having grown up in New York City,
Purmasir witnessed a widespread hipster culture in her
high school, and observed evidence ofboth hipster racism
and hipster sexism.
In terms of fashion, music, or other lifestyle choices,
Purmasir believes that hipsters are generally defined by
their rejection of the mainstream. "Slowly, the hipster
trend or ideology is also sort of becoming to mock mainstream things," she said. Rejecting certain aspects ofmainstream culture characterizes what is hip.
"Hipster racism and hipster sexism are the ideas that
because we are so hip and cultured, we can say things
about certain minorities and we clearly don't mean them.
Whether you are from a minority or have a friend of a
minority, you obviously are not a racist or a sexist, but you
just are just making fun of people in mainstream who act
in these certain ways," Purmasir said. Though such humor
is often considered harmless, if someone is no longer
defined by or held accountable for what they choose to say,
it becomes difficult to differentiate between what actually
identifies someone as a racist or a sexist.
"Anyone can commit hipster racism or hipster sexism,
but it has its roots in hipster culture, although I am sure
that there are people who are identified as hipsters who do
not engage in either behaviors," Purmasir said. Neither
hipster racism nor hipster sexism define the contemporary
hipster. Instead, it is the general hipster ideology of mocking the mainstream that inspires these behaviors of
endorsing potentially offensive statements for the sake of
looking cool.
During the WRC discussions, the students considered a
popular Facebook group, "I'm the boy. You're the girl.
Make me a sandwich, or we don't talk today." On
Daily Collegian.com, in March 2010, Dave Coffey noted the
harmlessness of the joke and said, "Laughter itself is a natural reaction to a noted inconsistency." He explains his
laughter as a consequence of the irony of society since it
considers itself socially progressive, yet women's suffrage
is less than one century old. Coffey's casual approach to the
potentially offensive statement is considered evidence of
the hipster sexism trend.

Such denigrating humor based on individuals' assump-

tions leads to efficiency-based stereotyping.

Society

becomes assimilated to a mindset where such sexist or
racist jokes are considered funny and thus become increasingly accepted. Individuals feel less and less validated in
becoming angered or offended by such statements because
as Purmasir explained, "it's not hip and it's not cool."
Allison Roseberry-Polier 'l4 attended the discussions.
"Whatever the intention is [of sexist or racist jokes], having this demeaning sense of humor does reproduce certain
ideas. So, in that way, it can be harmful to have jokes that
are quite offensive and demeaning because they are only
reinforcing stereotypes," she said.
While researching for the discussions, Purmasir
noticed no shortage in pop culture of humor excused by
"It's ok, I don't really mean it." For example, at Amy
Sedaris' book signing in 2009 for "I Like You," the comedian used the phrase "ching-chong" during an interview to
jokingly describe an Asian colleague. On the online blog
"The Society Pages," co-author Dr. Gwen Sharp, who teaches at Nevada State College, believes the incident raises the
question: "Who can claim the right to appropriate racist
humor and use it in an ironic way?"
In this case, Sharp believes it is Sedaris' status as a "hipster darling [that] surely buys her more ironic credit." Her
quirky persona gives her leeway to use the racist comment
ironically; instead of showing outrage, people laugh,
because to accept such jokes is the cool thing to do.
He considers the public uproar over Rosie O'Donnell's
use of the same phrase "ching-chong" earlier in 2006. Since
O'Donnell lacked a cultural status of being cool or hip at
the time, her actions received widespread criticism.
In considering hipster racism and hipster sexism,
Purmasir joins N+l magazine within the widespread
debate on college campuses, online blogs, and in literary
publications about the varied conceptions of hipsterism in
2010.

Is the contemporary hipster merely a "hip consumer"
who understands consumer purchases the right shirt or
the right bag within the familiar mainstream categories?
Does their rejection of the mainstream lifestyle make them
possessors of knowledge and tastes that are increasingly
hard to possess? Though hipsterism is an identifiable phenomenon, the specific exterior markers, lifestyle choices,
and ideologies that identify someone as a hipster are complicated and ambiguous.

Great TV theme songs go beyond bland hipness

swarthmorephoenix.com

The television theme
song is a tricky thing to get

right. In less than thirty seconds (unless, of course, your
show is on HBO) you have
to successfully set the mood,
even if you don't plan on
explaining the premise or
introducing the characters.

Alex Israel
Pencils Down,
Pass the Remote

Some themes succeed with
flying colors, as anyone who
sing
can
the
entire
"Gilligan's Island" theme
from memory, despite not
being born before the show
was cancelled, can tell you.
(Disclaimer: I can sing the
entire "Gilligan's Island"

theme from memory.)
Today, however, the TV theme song is something of a
lost art. Gone are the days when everybody knew Gary
Portnoy's name, because he wrote the theme song to
"Cheers." Today, many of TV's most popular shows suffer
I'm looking at you,
from bland, derivative theme songs
"Modern Family" and "Community" that don't tell you
anything about their shows except that the creators are
aiming for some sort of generic hipness. Which is really a
shame, because these shows are the opposite of bland and
derivative, and they should have theme songs to match.
The death of the television theme song, however, is not
yet upon us. Despite the disheartening attempts at catchy
themes found on network television, cable shows are
increasingly embracing moody, atmospheric themes that
capture the essence of the series. The most striking examples of truly artistic opening credits can be found on HBO
(where, to be fair, credits go on for about a minute and a
half, rather than being cut off at fifteen or thirty seconds,
which gives the creators a whole lot more to work with).
While some HBO sequences are just not up to snuff like
the "Big Love" credits, which are inexplicably awful the

opening credit sequences for "True Blood," "The
Sopranos," and "Six Feet Under" are truly exceptional
pieces of work. Each song, combined with the accompanying graphics, is richly evocative of its show's setting and
mood: Jace Everett's "Bad Things" combines with images
of death, decay, sex and religion to anchor vampire drama
"True Blood" in the evangelical fervor of the deep South;
Alabama 3's "Woke Up This Morning" follows scenes of
mob boss Tony Soprano's daily life, to create a picture of a
thug living a suburban life; and Thomas Newman's creepily austere theme song combines with images of embalming
and funerary rites to show the clinical side of death.
The best HBO opening theme, however, came from a
much less popular show. Anyone who watched the Great
Depression-set supernatural mystery "Carnivale" (which
was sort of like "Lost" combined with "Supernatural" on
crack) will no doubt remember the haunting opening credit sequence, which featured tarot cards blending with
scenes from Depression-era life, set to Wendy Melvoin and
Lisa Coleman's gorgeous composition. The credits perfectly encapsulated both the mood and the subject matter that
defined the show, and they remain the best opening credit

sequence I have ever seen.
There are shows other than HBO shows that have good
opening credit sequences, however. One of the most noteworthy is "Doctor Who," the absurdly long-running British
sci-fi series. The show's theme song (besides being ridiculously catchy) has, with some minor alterations, remained
the same for the over 30 seasons the show has been on the
air. The "Doctor Who" theme song also holds the distinction of being the first piece of music to be composed and
performed entirely electronically, without any instruments. This gives the song a futuristic feel appropriate to a
series about a time-traveling alien, but without completely
sapping it of feeling and fun.
Another much-lauded TV theme is that of AMC's "Mad
Men." Now, I don't really believe all the hype over the
theme song for "Mad Men" after all, it's no "Carnivale"
but I will admit that the music is lovely, the imagery is
great, and the theme song is in keeping with the show's

general feel, which is one of a stilted 60's middle-class life
in which the only possibility for excitement comes in the
potential for tragedy lurking around every corner. The
theme encapsulates, for me, the central factor that keeps
me from getting involved in this show; it's beautifully
done, slickly designed, and just a little too calculated and
removed to be genuinely engaging. At least, that's how I
feel. "Mad Men" worshippers, feel free to start your barrage ofhate mail at any time.
Of course, some shows eschew the traditional theme
song altogether, instead starting a show with different
strategies. The voiceover is particularly popular on the
CW: "Gossip Girl" starts with the titular narrator (Kristen
Bell) intoning, "And who am I? That's the only secret I'll
never tell," while "The Vampire Diaries" opening features
the usually cute-and-cuddly Stefan uttering the extremely
creepy line, "I know the risks, but I have to know her." But
the voiceover also appears at the beginning of one of the
most successful franchises in American television history.
That's right, I'm talking about "Law and Order." When
you've vegged out in front of enough USA L&O marathons,
it becomes quite easy to remember that, in the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet
equally important groups, and that these are their stories.
Of course, for some shows, even a voiceover isn't concise enough. On "Lost," a mood of mystery, dread, and the
unexplained is created in the space of one swirling, drawnout note. Let me repeat that: one note. I take back what I
said earlier about HBO having the best theme songs,
because those whiners take a whole minute and a half to set
their moods, while "Lost" does it in one note. The undisputed king of the TV theme hasbeen crowned, and it didn't
even need a melody to do it. Now that's why "Lost" was the
best show on television. (Well, excluding that whole season
finale part. And season three. Not to mention that episode
with C.J. from "The West Wing"...)
Alex is a senior who can sing theentire Gilligan 's Island
theme from memory. If you ask really nicely, she might perform it for you in Sharpies one day. You can reach her at aisraell@swarthmore.edu.

those cities,
I would encourage you to consider visiting
cities further east in Europe. Cities like
Kyiv, Sarajevo and Prishtina that look and
feel nothing like they did 15 years ago, and
that will look and feel nothing like they do
today in another 15.
Outside of the European Union, it's possible to really see history in action and
watch new cities rising out of the difficulties of the 20th century. Sarajevo, in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, which survived a
four year siege by the Serbian army during
the 19905, today has rebuilt its office buildings and markets, and today only a few
bombed-out buildings remain. Similarly,
the Serbian capital, Belgrade, has been
transformed into Europe's biggest party
city, and many of the buildings that the
United States and other countries to end
the genocides of the 1990s have been
replaced by cafes and new buildings as
well. Georgia is also recovering rapidly
from its war with Russia two years ago.
Less visible changes are also underway, as

considered major constitutional referendums. Although these cannot be seen-like
buildings, you will be sure to meet many
locals eager to discuss the current political
issues.
The biggest surprise for me during my
three months of traveling was how social
solo travel is. I had worried that it might be
lonely to set off on a trip without knowing
anyone. Instead, the last three months
have left me starved for actual alone time.
Staying in hostels and using mass transit
means that you will always be near someone who wants to meet you. It can be difficult for the first few days to be outgoing in
a strange place, but think of it as being similar to arriving at Swarthmore as a freshman. If you were able to find friends and
not eat alone at every meal your first week
on campus, then you will be able to find
friends at hostels and on trains. Plus, if you
don't like your roommates, you can always
switch rooms, or even hostels.
Solo travel has also allowed me to experience far more than I ever would have
traveling with a friend who could help
keep me in my comfort zone. It gave me
enough flexibility to decide one morning to
go to Ukraine instead of Austria. Not needing to coordinate with anyone else means
that you can enjoy a week of traveling with
a French guy you met at your hostel across
Kosovo and Macedonia, and then part ways
amicably when the places you wanted to go
differ, as I did in September.
It's not easy to travel for months at a
time, and obstacles like plane tickets,
school and work make it difficult to travel
outside of the country. I worked five jobs
during the summer to raise enough money,
and I probably won't be able to do another
trip like this for a long time. One way to
make a trip more affordable if you choose
to do a semester abroad is to take advan-

tage of travel funding the Off-Campus
Study Office provides each student. Buy
your plane ticket abroad a month in
advance so that you can travel before class-

es, and you already will have dealt with the
largest cost of travel.
If you can visit now, you will have the
opportunity to watch modern societies
being built. At times, I feltlike I was watching moments from American history when
the bus I was in passed rail workers tunneling through Turkey's mountains to link
the Caspian and Mediterranean Seas, and
when it passed road workers building highways in Kosovo. In the past decade, both

Georgian and Ukrainian reformers led
nonviolent revolutions that brought democratically elected governments to power,
and in both countries those democratically
elected governments lost significant support in the last four years. If you are interested in more than museums, now is the
time to see these places.
Solo travel is not always easy, and
Eastern Europe contains particular challenges for travelers. To be sure, there are
certain privileges that come with being a
white male, but I also have met women
who had traveled solo safely as far as from
France to Israel by bicycle. Other women I
met told me that they wore fake wedding
rings to avoid unwanted attention or even
found male travelers who were willing to
pretend to be their "husband" when traveling in more rural areas.
I also met people of color who had traveled safely and enjoyably around Eastern
Europe. Although usually the non-white
travelers I spoke to had traveled without
issue, too often they told me that they had
been treated, at best, as objects of extreme
curiosity. I remember spending a frustrating night with two men I met in Greece and
an African-American traveler trying to

dctc&efr'£Ti!£bi>a

explain that he and I could be equally

"American" and should both be allowed
into a club. Though this was not the only
time this American had a difficult time
traveling, he told me that overall, he was
having a fantastic time in Europe.
Language can also be an obstacle.
However, anyone reading this article has
the extraordinary privilege of knowing
English. Although most people over the age
of 30 in the former-Soviet countries speak
Russian, rather than English, most students today learn English as a second language. My lack of knowledge of the Eastern
European languages was never an obstacle, as English has become the de facto
international language. In any important
situation, such as buying a train ticket or
checking in to a hostel, someone will speak
English.

Food and store items can be bought by
pointing, and all of Europe uses the same
numbers, meaning that you can say the

name of the local currency
"lari" or
'tiram"
and write a number
"5" or
to agree on a price. Holding up
"1000"
fingers also works, assuming that whether
you're talking about l's, 10's, 100's, or 1000's
is already mutually understood. To be
polite, I would recommend also learning
how to say "hello," "thank you," and "goodbye" in the local language, at a bare minimum.
Travel abroad certainly is not easy, but
if you can go, go! If solo travel makes you
feel uncomfortable, plan a trip with a
friend from home, or wait until you leave
the country and ask other travelers you
meet along the way if you can travel with
them. Even if you decide to go solo, you
will almost never be alone. Trust yourself
and try going a little further East.

several years in Displaced Persons camps in colors than one might expect in art that often depicts
scenes inspired by the Holocaust or other genocides.
Still, it often sticks closely to earth tones and frequently calls upon colors that Packard describes as
"burnt sienna" and "greenish blue." Packard
explained that, by restricting his use of color in a
sense, the artist was able to unify what otherwise
often looked like a very disjointed world. An excess
of unusual color choices might have been a distraction from a major appeal of Bak's work: his "inventive recombination of images."
Bak himself has insisted on the fact that he is not
just a "Holocaust painter," and he is indeed much
more than such a label might suggest. The trauma of
the Holocaust does serve as the backdrop for much of
his work. In a sense, even when it is not directly
addressed, it is always haunting the canvas.
However, the questions and claims that are identifiable in Bak's work have profound universal
implications that anyone can engage with regardless
of his or her personal background and even beyond
the historical context of the Holocaust. "Bak's paintings exhort us to persist in our commitment to create a world based on knowledge and ethics,"
Weinberg said.
"There is a call to witness his experience, to
understand and inquire into history...to recognize
that just because the imagination itself is inventive
does not mean that it makes up reality. Rather, it
gives form to real things," Packard said.

Making life easier
Get a Gmail account. Each comes with over 7.5 gigabytes of free storage, and given Gmail's product management director Georges Harik's promise to "keep giving
people more space forever," you can rest assured that you
won't soon run out. In addition to space, your free account
with Google comes with many features that will make
your life easier and better connected. Not only can Gmail
sync with AOL Instant Messenger but it lets you physically call other phones for free. Few things are cooler than
being able to type your phone number into your Gchat
window and see your phone start ringing. And Gmail has
a fun and flexible development staff that constantly
updates the service based on user input, so new surprises
are available all the time. These can include anything
from an "undo" feature that retroactively un-sends emails
to the "Gmail Goggles" that force you to solve math problems if you try to send any emails on late weekend nights
the assumption being, of course, that you may be trying
to email someone under less-than-sober conditions.
Your technologasm from the use of Gmail need not
occur solely in English, as Gmail supports many language
platforms. However, there may be times when you receive
an email in a language you don't fully understand. Never
fear:
Google
Translate
at
(free
for
use
translate.google.com) far outperforms traditional translating programs. It relies not upon formal rules in grammatical structure, but rather upon an extremely complex algorithm that amasses thousands of authentically translated
texts in order to determine the most likely translation of
your content. The more translations available for Google
to sift through, the more accurate its algorithm becomes.
After you've gotten Google to accurately translate all
your Spanish homework (bad Swattie!), you can head over
to our campus's free citation service through Tripod in
order to give Google its due credit (good Swattie!).

Saving Money
When it comes to Google, the idea of multiple technologasms is not out of the question. I already mentioned that
you can call anyone in the world from your computer
using your Gmail account (for free in the US and Canada,
and two cents per minute to call international landlines).
But the cost savings don't end there. Your free Google
account entitles you to photo sharing and uploads through
Flickr, video uploads via YouTube and my personal
favorite, Google Docs, Google's response to Microsoft
Office. Thanks to Google Docs, I have not had to purchase
Microsoft Office software for years or worry about the
threat of data loss from a crashed hard drive. Google Docs
saves all of your documents (including PDFs, PowerPoint
presentations, Excel files and more) in a well-organized
online database that you can access from any device with
a browser and Internet connection.
Even if you choose not to set up an account with
Google, you can still engage in some technoloforeplay with
some other free Google services, like Google Books and
Google Shopping. Google has scanned over 12 million
books into its online e-brary, all of which are accessible,
whether in full or in part, to virtually everyone on earth.
Before you go out and buy a book, take the extra minute to
check Google Books (books.google.com) in case they have
already scanned it in for you. In the event that they have
not, you can simply go to Google Shopping
(shopping.google.com) and immediately find and compare

any burning questions that remain after all this new information enters your mind, WolframAlpha.com can probably answer them. Wolfram Alpha is an alternative to the

Even Google Shopping still sometimes misses out on a
few nifty online gems. For a one-stop shop for virtually all
your computing needs, bookmark Newegg.com, a computer hardware site with one of the best customer service reputations around. For extremely novel and creative technological gifts and gadgets, Think Geek.com will not let you
down. Finally, if you are just looking for absolute rock-bottom prices (and free shipping!) on a wide array of techrelated products, don't miss DealExtreme.com, a site with
its own dedicated section to deals under two dollars.
Learning new things
Of course, there's more to life than communication,
cost-effectiveness and consumerism; there's also the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom for its own sake. One of my
favorite sites is TED.com, dedicated to "ideas worth
spreading." It hosts yearly conferences in which some of
the world's most intelligent and influential people talk
about new findings or trends related to technology, entertainment and design. Best of all, TED publishes videos of
the talks online for all the world to see. Watching TED
videos is the ultimate form of procrastination, because
there's never guilt attached (it's pure learning, after all).
If TED inspires you to further pursue knowledge in a

Thus concludes my column's three-part look at technology. While you may not receive any further technologasmic recommendations from me, I encourage you to harness the power of the Internet and explore its myriad wonders for yourself, and when you do come across truly useful and interesting things, spread the love
share them

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Sarah
Year: 2013

B. Vogelman

From: New York City, NY
CurrentResidence: Hallowell
What She's Wearing:
"This is my dad's old shirt and his letterman sweater
from high school and this is my mom's scarf so none
of it's really mine," Vogelman said. Vogelman is also
sporting saddle shoes and Uniqlo jeans. Her jewelry is a
collection of items that belonged to her grandmother
and mother. Her earrings, which combine a white, ivory
elephant and bronze triangle, are from Vermont.
From her carefully rolled-up, dark wash jeans to the
small-checkered, pink button-down and letterman
sweater, Vogelman's look is the epitome of a collegiate
chic. It's at once put together and simple, but then she
infuses her outfit with quirky accessories, like the saddle shoes and clock-printed scarf. She's also particularly mindful of proportions by balancing out the oversized shirt and sweater with slim fit jeans.
How She Describes Her Style:
"It changes, it definitely changes," Vogelman said.
Currently, she's been emulating her father's collegiate
style. "I think it's more of a subconscious thing," she
said. "I always think about, whenI wear something, like
would my dad approve of this?" Vogelman is drawn to a
combination of masculine and feminine aesthetics. "I do
like [the androgynous look], whether it's a conscious
decision or not," she said. "I think it's just like a comfort
thing for me mostly." From over-sized men's buttondowns to comfy sweaters, Vogelman tends to "stay more
classic and simple than anything else."
Fashion Influences / Inspiration:
Since most of her clothes come from her parents'
closets, Vogelman turns to them for inspiration. "I think
my dad has really a great eye for like fashion and cuts
and lines and patterns," she said. "My mom does too,
but in a different way." Her mother was an interior
designer, so her aesthetic deals more with one's 'environment [and the] space around."
Apart from her parents, Vogelman also takes inspiration from her hometown of New York City. "There's
intent behind what [New Yorkers are] wearing, no matter what it is, and I think that that's the coolest thing,"

she said. She also likes the utilitarian aspect of most New
Yorkers' clothing.
Where She Shops:

Vogelman said, as well as her
friends' closets. She also enjoys
Gap and Zara. "I don't do a ton of
shopping. I only shop for things that
I really need," she said. When she
pilfers through her parent's closets,

she looks for comfortable, "soft"
items like the cozy letterman
"Sometimes it has to do

with sentimental value, like this
sweater. I just love it because it was
sweater,"
my
dad's letterman
Vogelman said. "I probably wouldn't
have picked it up if it was just a random person's letterman sweater." She
looks for a connection to her clothes,
which is why she shies away from frequently shopping at stores.

Favorite Item(s) in Her Closet:
Besides the letterman sweater,
Vogelman also loves her quilted Moschino
bag and a Jean Paul Gautlier romper, both
of which she scored for little money. Two
summers ago, Vogelman interned at her
friend's mother's PR sales company, which
represents both designers. "I didn't get paid,
but at the end of the summer, I got this beauit's like
tiful, red Moschino bag. I love it
my payoff after the whole summer,"
Vogelman said. She also got the romper for
less than $lOO at a company sample sale.
Wardrobe Staples:
Her gold bangles,

button-down shirts

(preferably her dad's) and big sweaters are
three main staples for Vogelman.

Never Leaves the House Without:
"I never leave the house without something to tie my
hair up with or my phone," Vogelman said.

Barnes Foundation moving its famous galleries
BY CAMILA RYDER
cryderl@swarthmore.edu

It's a collection unlike any other, as many pieces
are distinct from some of the great artists' famous

Since the Barnes Foundation opened its galleries
to the public in 1961, professors, students, art lovers
and tourists have flocked to the location in Lower
Merion. The contemporary, avant-garde collection is
far from humble, as it's said to be worth over $25 billion, and has been embroiled in much controversy
and legal battle since it's owner, Dr. Albert C. Barnes,
died in 1951 As the Barnes Foundation prepares to
make its big, albeit controversial, move from Lower
Merion to the new Benjamin Franklin Parkway building, many are flocking to the original building for one
last look at the artwork in its original home. The
estate will officially close its doors by June 2011 and
the new building will open by January 2012.
To many, the Barnes Foundation is just another
museum you visit while on vacation, just like you
would go to the Philadelphia Museum of Art or the
Met for the day. But the collection was intended originally to be utilized for an art institution, where students could apply for free and get the opportunity to
see Matisse's "The Joys of Life" or Renoir's "Card
Players and Girl" in the flesh. The move of the collection has sparked widespread debate. Is this going
against Barnes' will and intentions? Will the artwork
become just a part of a large museum? Will the educational traditions remain the same?
Barnes, born into a middle-class family in
Philadelphia, made his fortune through developing
the antiseptic solution Argyrol. Barnes developed a
love for art and acquired modern, eclectic pieces like
Matisse's "The Joys of Life," Seurat's "Models" and
Van Gogh's "Postman." His personal collection consists of 181 pieces by Renoir, 59 works by Matisse,l6
Modiglianis and 46 ofPicasso's works, to name a few.
"Its an amazing collection with some terrible stuff
and some jaw-dropping stuff like Matisse's 'Joys of
Life' and Seurat's ['Models']," Janine Mileaf, associate professor of Art History, said. Mileaf has
brought many of her classes and alumni trips to the
Foundation. "It's idiosyncratic and that's what's great
about it, because it's not installed in any way you
would see things installed in [any other place]."

"He has a lot of pieces that are kind of unusual for
especially a couple of Van Goghs that
were really peculiar but really interesting because
they were differentform the mainstream stuff," Isabel
Newlin 'l3 said, who visited the Barnes at the beginning of the school year.
But when exhibiting his collection in 1923, Barnes
was met with much ridicule from art historians and
critics about his unabashedly idiosyncratic collection
as well as Barnes' decision to display the works in
both a non-thematic, non-chronological order.
"Part of what he hated was the art establishment,"
Mileaf said of Barnes' dissatisfaction with the art
world. "What he hated was it being interpreted in
terms of a kind of master narrative of art history that
went against his ideas about how art should be inter-

works.

preted."

Instead, Barnes created the Foundation to be an
educational art institute where students could apply
and take classes for free. The students ranged from
artists to those simply interested in art itself.
Jay Raymond is a former student and faculty member at the Barnes Foundation, as well as a member of
the Friends of the Barnes Foundation, and took classes at the Barnes in the 1970s with Violette de Mazia
Barnes' protege and long-time Barnes educator.
Raymond described the classes and educational experience Barnes intended as quite unique amongst
other typical ways of teaching art.
"[The] first year was basically teaching people the
fundamental ideas that [Barnes] had developed,"
Raymond said. "In the second year, the class was split
into three sections [and] was devoted to learning
the visual traditions." Barnes emphasized the importance of understanding and interpreting the painting
or sculpture itselfand rejected the common academic
focus on the history of the artist, the society at the
time and other historical and biographical contexts.
Understanding the "visual traditions" was essential,
Raymond said, and educators taught that paintings
could speak to the viewer and express themselves in
terms "primarily of color, but also in light, line, space,
composition and texture."
For the period when Barnes was running the
Foundation, the coUection was mainly for students,
though it was envied by museums and collectors.
Barnes' will, written in 1942, stipulated that the museum wouldremain an educational institution, could be
open a few days out of the week for visitors at a low
price, and the collection was never to be loaned, sold
or moved from the original building. Throughout the
rest of his life, Barnes was vociferously defensive of
his art never leaving the building in Merion.
As the Foundation passed to different presidents
and with a shrinking $lO million endowment and the
need for refurbishment, new leaders like former president Richard Glanton saw that there was a need for
money. During Glanton's term as president, there was
a world tour of some of the artwork. The debateabout
moving the collection to a more accessible, public
location began as well.
"The trend at the Barnes Foundation for about ten
years now is to move away from what Barnes wanted
to be taught and how he wanted the material to be
used," Raymond said.
In 2004, Judge Stanley Ott of Montgomery County
Orphan's Court allowed for the Barnes Foundation all
of the artwork as well as furniture and wall decor to a
new location on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in
Philadelphia by 201 L As emphasized in "The Art of
the Steal," it seemed as if Barnes will was entirely
overlooked.
At the root of this long battle and history of the
Barnes Foundation is the question of whether this
move is good or not. Barnes believed that art should
be accessible to people who want to see it and appreciate it, not just art critics or those with money. The
Foundation is also in Merion, which is not readily

accessible to those visiting the city.
"I understand the frustration that that causes,
especially for people who come from out of town,"
Mileaf said. It is not readily accessible, as reservations need to be made in advance. Mileafalso said that
she's "sympathetic" to the fact that art should be seen.
"Art shouldn't be for people to keep to themselves."
But Mileaf struggles, like many others, in being
strongly opinionated on one side of the issue.
"It's a shame," she said about the move overall.
"I'm nostalgic about what it has been and that it will
change."

Newlin also expressed her dismay at the move. "I
think when you take it out of its house, you disassociate the artwork from him," she said. "I think that
gives [the artwork] another of authenticity or helps
make it a coherent collection."
Raymond is much more vehement in his anger
towards the move.
"It's [a] serious tragedy," he said. "It's not just the
loss of a beautiful place, it's the loss of a very important set of ideas, as far as I know, unique in the world,
and it's been 501 just to serve the tourism interests
of Philadelphia. It's a disgrace, it really is."
The new building will keep the same dimensions,
floor plan and set-up that Barnes had. They are also
continuing classes that will be in rooms separate from
the galleries (though Raymond mentioned that
Barnes wanted classes to be taught in the galleries), as
well as a cafe, a seminar room and an auditorium. All
that will remain at the original building are horticulture classes and the arboretum that the estate sits on.
While Mileaf understands the argument of moving
the collection to a more accessible location, she also
worries that the aesthetics may be lost in translation
and also feels that students, faculty and the general
public should see the artwork at the building in
Merion.
It should also be reiterated that all the artwork
Barnes owned was within his private collection a
collection that he enjoyed for himself and wanted students to enjoy.
"It's a type of collection that represents a lifetime
and a way of thinking about art and it wasn't just put
together in a couple weeks or a couple months the
way a lot ofexhibitions are these days," Newlin said.
"So much thought is put in [to them]. People spend
their whole lives collecting."
Whether or not you agree with the move to the
Parkway building, traveling up to Merion before it
moves is essential. Witnessing Matisse's "The Dance
II" mural or "The Joys of Life" in the flesh and at it's
original setting is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

THE PHOENIX

Opinions

swarthmorephoenix.com

Sestak, Onorato, Lentz best candidates for Pa.
Less than two weeks away, this year's
midterm elections are likely to greatly
shape the next few years across the country.
The Phoenix has endorsed a candidate for U.S. Senate, Governor, and the
7th Congressional District:
Sestak for Senate
Joe Sestak, the Democratic nominee,
offers the kind of rationalism, ambition
and experience that a frustrated state
and country need right how. His
Republican opponent Pat Toomey, on the
other hand, typifies the uncompromising
small-government, tax-cutting conservatism that was the cause for our country's distress in the first place.
Toomey has long had a wide lead over
Sestak, but the gap seems to be closing
a recent poll from Public Policy indicates
Sestak is up by one point (46 to 45).
Sestak representative since 2007 for
the 7th Congressional district, which
Swarthmore is a part of
served 31
years in the Navy and attained the rank
of three-star admiral. He is the most senior military veteran to ever serve in
Congress, and was named the most productive House freshman.
Importantly, he has close ties to the
college. Swarthmore students who have
canvassed for him and worked in his
office speak highly of him as both a
Democrat committed to progressive policy and a person genuinely engaged with
his constituents.
In turn, he supports the same kinds of
issues that students at the college are
interested in. He wants to repeal the
"don't ask, don't tell" military policy;
voted for the economic bailout; and has
supported unions, abortion rights and
gay rights issues.
On the other hand, Toomey
formerly a small business owner and representative for the 15th congressional district
is a hard-right conservative;
Pollster.com, for instance, found that
Toomey ranked more conservative than
97.9 percent of all U.S. legislators since
1995.

.

His uncompromising and staunch
views would only exacerbate an already
fragmented Congress
and, more
importantly, hurt an already distressed
country. He opposes abortion, embryonic stem-cell research and gay marriage.
Demonizing "big government," Toomey
has contended that cutting taxes for
everyone will create jobs, contrary to
what many economists say.
Toomey,
like so many other
Republicans now, simply offers inflated
rhetoric. Only Sestak seems to have the
rationalism required to rectify current
issues.
For instance, Sestak's call to rescind
Bush tax cuts for taxpayers making
more than $250,000 would shore up

money in a still-struggling economy and
relieve unfair burdens on the middle
class. Like other Republicans, Toomey
adamantly opposes taking this measure.
Nevertheless, he bemoans the national
deficit and places fault on Democrats
when, actually, current economic problems came largely from Bush-era trickledown economics.
This hypocrisy and inflated rhetoric
is a pattern for Toomey. Sestak rational, experienced, and passionate
offers
the real kind of responsibility and
engagement the country needs right
now.

Onorato for Governor
The gubernatorial race has been
defined largely by the candidates'

approaches to taxes.
Tom Corbett, the Republican nominee
and state attorney general, originally
made a "no-tax pledge" but has been
vague throughout the last few months on
what exactly that means. His Democratic

opponent Dan Onorato, however, has
been more concrete.
For instance, as reported in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Onorato has
supported an
extraction tax on
Marcellus shale drilling that he believes
could bring money to repair state roads
and bridges; restore the past two years'
28 percent budget cut in state EPA budget; and shore up money for a statewide
environmental program that seeks to
preserve farms and restore old industrial sites called brownfields (the debate
with building a soccer stadium in
Chester centers on this very issue).
And still, Onorato currently executive of Allegheny County has shown a
moderate nature that is reassuringly
opposed to raising taxes in a few other
areas.
Nevertheless, Onorato's outlined plan
for a shale tax offers the kind of concreteness that a struggling state
strapped for money needs right now.
Admittedly, Onorato has received political donations from drilling interests.
But, as he criticizes, Corbett's opposition to a gas severance tax illustrates
that his laissez-faire approach, in fact,
favors drillers, not taxpayers. Corbett
has indicated this ignorance and disregard throughout the campaign, such as
when he said in July that "the jobs are
there But if we keep extending unemployment, people are going to sit there."
Corbett has been the favorite throughout, in many polls with a double-digit
edge over Onorato. Recent polls suggest
that the gap is tightening, but minimally
so, with Corbett still at a 10-point lead.
...

Lentz for 7th Congressional District

The best candidate for the 7th
Congressional district is Bryan Lentz
because he brings a degree of accessibility and engagement that his Republican
opponent, Pat Meehan, does not. As a
resident of Swarthmore and two-term
state representative for Delaware
County, Lentz has opened himself up
during the campaign to various townhall meetings and, even, a casual visit to
campus last month. He also maintained
a connection with the college.
Meehan, on the other hand, seems
unsure and removed. When it comes to
debates, Meehan struggled greatly in one
and, even, skipped a later one, claiming

Emma Waitzman for The Phoenix

that he would not attend if the third candidate, Jim Schneller, was also there.
Schneller, a tea party affiliate running under the American Congress
Party, is on the ballot after Lentz's campaign pushed to gather thousands of signatures for him in hopes of siphoning

votes from Meehan.
While ethical questions have been

raised about Lentz's campaign, he nevertheless is a pretty straight Democrat
with solid stances on important issue's.
He has called for a timetable in exiting
from Afghanistan, repealing "don't ask,
don't tell" and rescinding tax cuts for
people making over $250,000
all issues
that Meehan, a traditional conservative,
is opposed to.

We may believe that our society is progressive but in actuality little is being
done to improve the social conditions

I want it to get better. I really do.
But I will not spout blind hope because
popular media have decided that this
is a marketable time to start focusing
on those whom we usually push to the
periphery. The problem with such an
impromptu outcry is that it lacks
pragmatic implications.
We shouldn't wait for people to be
dead, literally or metaphorically, to
start sounding the trumpets. It will
not alter the pitiful situation that
racism, homophobia, sexism and
ableism have created, nor will it erase
our years of inaction. I will be the first
one to say it gets better when networks decide it is worthy to profile the
experience of students of color in independent schools, similar .to their
obsession with the lives of white
elites. Or when a full-figured, darkskinned African-American actress
like Raven Goodwin is able to play
opposite someone like Michael Cera in
a romantic comedy without the subject of her status as "other" serving as
the central point of the film.
Until then, I, like Councilman
Burns, will encourage my peers to
stick around, if only because there is
strength in numbers and perhaps
together we can shed light on the
injustices that plague our reality.

Prevalence of pornography likely to damage relationships
What is pornography?

And pornography has become accepted by many
as a means of pleasure, just as viewing porn on the
computer is what many people do: one in four
Internet searches are for porn, according to a study
by the Witherspoon Institute.
One of the problems is that porn is a habit-forming activity. If you watch pornography regularly
now, it is likely you will do the same in the future. So
when you are in a committed relationship, you probably will not be able to kick the habit.
According to psychologists, pornography can create expectations about sex and women that cannot be
fulfilled in real life. And, if these expectations are
not fulfilled, they can be detrimental to relationships.

A Time magazine article titled "The Porn Factor"
(2004) states that "experts say men who frequently
view porn may

have difficulty forming and sus-

taining relationships and feeling sexually satisfied."
This is a precarious situation that nobody wants

to be in (There is very minimal research about this
situation. It is, however, far from the only problem

Finally, all of those references to

Gibson vs. McClain that baseball writers have had in their back pockets since
1972 got to be used. Not as fortunate: the
matchup itself turned out to be the
worst-case scenario for something so
insanely hyped. It wasn't good enough
to justify that hype (still being played,
with each pitcher working on a perfect
game through fifteen innings), not bad

seven innings, struck out a bunch of hitters, gave up two home runs apiece, and
had more balls squared up by the hitters
than they had in the last month.

Halladay four, and the Giants ended up
winning. Decently pitched game, but

Turns out, that's exactly what seems
to have happened to C.C. Sabathia so
far. Just like Halladay vs. Lincecum was
supposed to be something we would tell
our grandchildren about, the big workhorse* was going to be the only pitcher
the Yankees would be able to count on
during the playoffs. Instead, he was
uneven against Minnesota and horrendous against Texas (lone bright spot: he
did manage to remind us of the benefits
of having a former tight end as a pitcher
when he tagged out Nelson Cruz at
home plate). C.C. attributed his struggles to "being "too strong," which apparently meant that since the Yankees were
too much better than Minnesota in the

keep his pitches down in the strike zone.
Meanwhile, Andy Pettitte has given
the Yankees two excellent performances
and Phil Hughes one. The moral, of
course, is that the more you hear of a
"sure thing" in baseball, the less chance
there is of it coming true. Unfortunately,
that has yet to cross over to football, but
one of these days the Bills will beat the
Patriots and ifI'm still alive by then, I'll

C.C. Sabathia is identified: "workhorse," because he throws a lot of
innings and "big" because he's "fat."

pitcher who never goes more than five
or six innings, would be called. What
animal would represent a pitcher who

Halladay against the Giants' ace (and

Lincecum, would be the greatest pitching matchup in half a century, I made
plans to do something else while that

The Key to Beating the East: Power
Arms
The same list of names was trotted
out again before this year's postseason:
Josh Beckett, Curt Schilling, Randy
Johnson, Justin Verlander, Fausto
Carmona. Pitchers who have beaten the
Yankees in recent playoff series by
throwing in the upper 90s, racking up
strikeouts and not relying on "finesse"
pitches and hitting corners to get outs.
This was supposed to be the only way to
beat teams like the Yankees and Rays,
the ones baptized in the river of fire
called the AL East. When Carl Pavano
and Brian Duensing, Minnesota's two
decidedly non-power pitchers, got
knocked around by the Yankees in the
ALDS, the chorus grew louder.
But then a funny thing happened in
Texas: two "finesse" pitchers, C.J.
Wilson and Colby Lewis, armed with
fastballs that rarely hit 90 on the gun

OptoberJ2l,.3QVV,

Meanwhile, "power pitchers" David
Price and C.C. Sabathia have allowed fifteen earned runs in four starts this postseason. Either Wilson or Lewis will
probably have to face the Yankees once
more in New York, but for now, finesse
just might be the new power.

The debate continues: Cheerleading as a varsity sport?

swarthmorephoenix.com

Before fall break, my

class discussed the use of
concepts in the learning of

language. The grouping of
new objects into conceptual
categories helps young children learn new words quickly. However, defining the

boundaries of these conceptual categories can be difficult even for us much-older
children. While the entire
class agreed that a Solo cup

Things got even more interesting with the introduction

of the conceptual category of sports. When the professor
asked for some examples of popular sports, I was interest-

stream sports franchises, I realized we were having more
difficulty in defining what constitutes a sport than I would
have expected. The debate over what a sport is, in fact, is
being fought in arenas outside of psychology classes and
has far-reaching consequences few would suspect from
such a simple question.
Recently, the debate over the definition of a sport has
centered on the recognition, or lack there of, of cheerleading as a collegiate sport. Last year the issue was put to rest,
at least temporarily, not on an athletic field but instead in
a courtroom. It started in 2009 when Quinnipiac University
of Connecticut wanted to drop the women's volleyball team
and add competitive women's cheerleading as a varsity
sport to fulfill Title IX requirements that dictate gender
equality in collegiate sports.
Members of the volleyball team responded with a class
action suit against the school on the basis of gender discrimination. A judge ruled in their favor this summer,
arguing that although competitive cheer may have a
future, as of now "the activity is still too underdeveloped
and disorganized to be treated as offering genuine varsity
athletic participation opportunities for students."
Quinnipiac is one of several schools that recognize
cheerleading as a varsity
sport, including schools
like University of Oregon
and the University of
Maryland. A study of

Most of the cheerleaders that were interviewed express

hope that NCAA recognition would force other athletes to
rethink the typical stereotypes of cheerleading as "girly."
Participants at the University of Maryland broadcasted
their hopes for sports status with slogans such as, "Hold
my weights while I stunt with your girlfriend" and, "Other
sports use one ball, we use two."
While the aim of garnering respect from other athletes

is admirable, more changes need to be made to cheerleading to take it out of the realm of supporting other sports and
turn it into a sport in its own right. Felicia Mulkey, the
coach of the team stunts and gymnastics program at
University of Oregon, seemed to think that a new name
would be enough to give cheerleading a new start. "It was
the perception of that word, cheer," Mulkey saidfor an article in the New York Times. "Once people understand, you
get a lot more fans and some of that perception goes away."
While a new name might help with stereotypes of cheerleading, it is not the only thing that needs to change.
Anyone who has watched an actual cheerleading competition can attest to how physically demanding the stunts
done by the teams are. Yet it is difficult for many to get past
the emphasis on aesthetics to the real athletic showmanship. Cheer cannot just be removed from the name of the
sport; it also has to be removed from the goals of the programs. While defining the concept of a sport is difficult,
most argue that a main objective of any sports program
cannot be the support of other sports, as cheerleading still
does to this day. There needs to be more competitions within the sport and less sideline cheering for other sports.
Team gymnastics is an interesting idea for a sport, and
as the judge in the Quinnipiac case said, there may well be
a future for it in collegiate athletics. However, this future
will never be realized without some serious changes to
cheerleading programs. Competitive cheerleaders are athletes and deserve the type of programs that will allow them
to be recognized as such, as long as it is not at the expense
of other women's athletics programs.

Field hockey in playoff contention for stretch run
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS
aapostol@swarthmore.edu

Despite a 4-2 loss to McDaniel on
Saturday, the 2010 Swarthmore Garnet
field hockey team has already been a surprise success story. With a combined two

Centennial Conference wins in the past
two seasons and only fourteen players in
a sport where eleven are on the field at
once, it is not a stretch to say that expectations were low for the Garnet squad.
However, in the final two weeks of the
regular season, the team finds itself in an
looking to make a
unfamiliar position
playoff run.
The Garnet's six wins overall are the
most that the team has recorded in a full
season since Lauren Fuchs took over as
head coach in 2008. With three
Centennial wins so far, the team has
tripled its total from last year and currently stands in sixth place in the conference. Five teams will ultimately make
the championship tournament, but the
remainder of the schedule is no walk in
the park for Swarthmore.
After yesterday's match-up with the
Ursinus Bears, undefeated on the season
in conference play, Swarthmore will
have to take on Haverford, currently
third in the Centennial Conference,
Gettysburg, currently fifth, and an
underachieving Franklin & Marshall
team that was picked in the preseason
poll to finish fifth.
These final few games will certainly
test the mettle of the young Garnet
squad, as playoff hopes depend on
pulling out victories against these far
more seasoned teams.
The loss to McDaniel on Saturday put
the team in even more of a "must-win"

all, but they jumped on the Garnet early
and scored four unanswered goals in the
first half of play.
Catie Meador 'l3, who scored one of
the two Swarthmore goals on Saturday,
said that Swarthmore was overwhelmed
by the physicality of the Green Terror.
"McDaniel is a very physical team, so
our main problem defensively
was
that we were unable to adjust to this
physicality, so we were getting beat to
the ball and pushed off the ball, and
McDaniel was essentially able to muscle
their way [to the win]."
Swarthmore rallied in the final 35
minutes, keeping McDaniel scoreless
and netting two on the backs of Meador
and Sophia Ferguson 'll, but it was not
quite enough to make up for the first half
play. "We really needed a win against
McDaniel to have a good shot at making
the playoffs, but we definitely still have a
chance," Meador said. "Based on the way
this season has been going for everyone
in the Centennial Conference, I still
think anything could happen."
The team is aware of the precarious
nature of its playoff position, but it also
seems to know what it needs to work on
in order to reach the next level. In order
...

to respond to the shortcomings exposed
by McDaniel, Meador said that "in practice, we are going to be working a lot on
how to deal with this physical style of
play [as exhibited by McDaniel] and staying low over the ball, as most of the
teams we will be playing over the next
four games are also rather physical."
Sophia Agathis 'l3 has observed a

level of excitement and optimism about
the season despite the tough finish.
"We're really looking forward to these
last couple of games," she said. "They're
all very good teams, so we'll have to play
some of our best hockey of the season,
but as long as we're doing the little
things right, there's no reason why we
can't finish the season with a couple of
wins."
Fuchs agrees with the confidence
abounding among her players. "We have
improved and learned something, each
and every game," she said. "We will have
to put everything together and make the
most of our opportunities
which I
know we can [do]."
Before Saturday's defeat, the Garnet
had taken advantage in Centennial
Conference play, winning back-to-back
games in Centennial Conference play for
the first time since 2007. On the first
Saturday of October break, Swarthmore
travelled to Dickinson and knocked off
the Red Devils 2-1, thanks to two second
half goals from Aarti Rao 'l4 and Nia
Jones 'l4.
Four days later, Swarthmore shut out
the visiting Muhlenberg Mules 3-0, as
Katie Teleky 'l3 scored twice and Jones
scored again. Before Saturday, Jones had
scored in four consecutive games.
Regardless of the outcome of this
year's playoff push, the Garnet has certainly turned a lot ofheads in the conference and things only promise to get better. Four of Swarthmore's five leading
scorers so far this season are either firstyears or sophomores, and the team only
has four seniors total. Agathis, Jones,
Teleky, and Rao comprise a core of firstyears and sophomores whose play so far
promises to make Garnet field hockey

extremely competitive in the next sever-

al seasons.

"We're all extremely confident in the
future of this team," Agathis said. "I
think because we're a small team, we've
all just stepped up and not used it as an
excuse. In the next two years, we're
going to really surprise some teams
around the conference."
As it stands, however, the Garnet
women remain firmly focused on the
present. Picked to finish 10 of 11 in the
Centennial preseason poll, the team has
already blown past all expectations and
the squad is not content to settle.
Agathis displays a level-headed
approach to the remainder of the season.
"We're all just focusing on the little
things we need to do to win games. We
can't get worried about how many teams
we have to beat and who has to lose to
whom. We just have to know that if we're
all doing what we need to do to be successful, the playoffs will come."
"I believe anything can happen at this
point," Meador said. "We've already
exceeded the expectations many people
had for this season, so if we keep working hard, I think we'll be able to pull off
a few huge upsets."
As for head coach Fuchs, who continues to shape the Swarthmore field hockey program with her excellent recruiting
classes, the future is the furthest thing
from her mind as she gears her team up
for the stretch run. "We still have important games to play this year," she said.
"I'm not going to talk about the future
when we have four important games left
here."

Men's soccer reaches

No. 1 despite second road

Micah Rose, Roberto Contreras, Kieran Reichert and David Sterngoid celebrate

BY SAM LACY AND VICTOR BRADY
slacyl, vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

While the rest of the campus was on
October break, the Swarthmore men's soccer team picked up dominant wins over
Ursinus, 3-0, and Moravian, 4-0, before settling for a tightly contested scoreless draw
with Franklin & Marshall this past weekend.
When the clock struck zero on the second overtime period, the scoreboard at
F&M's Tylus Field said Swarthmore 0,
F&M 0, but the Diplomats' celebratory
mood suggested a different score. The F&M
game proved that the tactics and ambitions
of the opposition have changed now that
the Garnet has established themselves as a
top team in Division 111.
Several recent opponents have packed
in extra defenders to limit Garnet scoring
chances in hopes of a draw. "The longer you
go through the season undefeated and with
a top ranking, more and more teams will go
negative against you, playing eleven men
behind the ball and only looking to score on
the counterattack," captain Micah Rose 'l2
said.
Unlike in its previous tie with
Gettysburg, which was 2-6 at the time, the
Garnet was content with its level of play
against F&M. "Against Gettysburg, we didn't show up. At F&M, we showed up and
created good chances, but got unlucky and
couldn't convert," Morgan Langley 'll said.

Swarthmore's David D'Annunzio 'l2 made

The Garnet's 2-0-1 October break pushed
its record to 11-0-2. Despite the draw, the
Garnet became the new No. 1 in the NSCAA
Division 111 poll. It is the first time any
Centennial Conference men's soccer team
has ever been ranked No. L In the D 3 soccer
poll, however, the Garnet dropped one spot
to No. 3, behind Messiah and Dominican.
The Garnet is honored with the milestone ranking, but keep it in perspective.
"It's awesome to get the recognition of
being No. X but we want to be No. 1 in the
last ranking. Until then, it doesn't mean
that much," said Rose.
Wagner added that the ranking should
serve as motivation for the team to continue it's high level of play as the race for
home field advantage in the Centennial
playoffs heats up. "We're still in the driver's seat, but we've got our work cut out
for us," Wagner said.
The Garnet is 13 games into a season
that they want to last 25 games, including
two in the Centennial Conference tournament and six in the NCAA tournament.
Some younger players are seeing

increased roles as the Garnet try to get
some rest for the upperclassmen who have
logged most of the minutes. "As the season
grinds on, depth becomes more important,
and our depth is better than it has ever
been," Rose said.
Jack Momeyer 14 has made the most of
his increased opportunities. With goals
against Ursinus and Moravian, Momeyer
now has 3 goals on 3 shots in his rookie season. Momeyer stressed that the transition
to his increased role is made easier by the
skill of the experienced players like
Langley.

"When [Langley] is in the game, it
allows the rest of us more space and time.
We can take more chances on the ball
because the defense knows they have to
keep an eye on him," Momeyer said.
Although quiet on the score sheet
against Ursinus, Langley continued his torrid campaign against Moravian, scoring his
eighth goal and earning his 11th and 12th
assists. The senior continues to lead
Division 111 in assists per game with 0.92.
The match against Ursinus on the first
Saturday
of October break
was
Swarthmore's first contest after the
Gettysburg tie. Just over 16 minutes into
the game, Rose gave the Garnet a 1-0 lead
with a laser from beyond the top of the
Ursinus box. Kieran Reichert 'l3 and
Momeyer added late second half goals to
secure the victory over the Bears.

opponent Moravian, the

struck early, this time just under five minutes into the match. After a turnover by
the Moravian keeper, Langley gathered the
ball in the box and played it into an open
net for the quick 1-0.
Just ten minutes later, Langley set up
the Garnet's second goal with a through
ball in the middle to a cutting Contreras.
In the final twenty minutes of the game,
the Garnet scored twice more, with Castro
dribbling in for a goal off a pass from
Reichert. Momeyer capped the scoring,
taking a Langley cross on the far side of the
box and beating the keeper after the pass
trickled through two Swarthmore forwards
and two Moravian defenders.
Swarthmore is 8-0-0 at Clothier Field
this season, but struggled on the road again
Wednesday at Richard Stockton.
Up 1-0 early in the second half thanks to
a Langley goal, the Garnet conceded the
game-tying goal in the 65th minute.
The two teams played through a scoreless first overtime period before the
Ospreys scored the game winner 1:11 into
the second overtime.
Swarthmore outshot Richard Stockton
26-14 but couldn't find a second goal. The
loss is the team's first of the season.
Swarthmore returns to Clothier Field
this Saturday for a 7:30 p.m. match against
McDaniel on Garnet Homecoming weekend
