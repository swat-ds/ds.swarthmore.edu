Alum discusses uneven consequences of climate change
BY JON EMONT

jemontl@swarthmore.edu

Last Thursday, alum Michael Greenstone '9l presented a
lecture entitled "The Consequences of Climate Change on
Mortality in the United States and India." His presentation
came as this year's Bernard Saffran Memorial Lecture.
Bernard Saffran was one of Swarthmore's most prominent
economics professors until his unexpected death in 2004.
Greenstone began the lecture by revisiting his experience studying under Saffran over eighteen years ago. He
described his former professor as a father figure and said
that it was 'Vmite an honor" to be the keynote speaker at an
event held in memory of his former mentor, whom he fondly referred to as "Bernie." Greenstone said that it was
Saffran who convinced him to pursue a graduate degree in
economics, a decision that led to his career as a member of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
After concluding his remarks on Saffran's Swarthmore
career, Greenstone discussed his research on the impact of
climate change on mortality rates in the United States and
India. He used these numbers and a few other indicators to
predict the extent to which "business-as-usual" levels of climate change would result in mortality increases in India
and the U.S. He concluded that in the year 2100, there would
be a "relatively minor" two to three percent increase in the

mortality rate of the U.S. India, however, would exhibit a
more extreme increase. One of his models indicated that
India's increase in mortality could be as high as 36 percent.
Greenstone began his lecture by describing why an
analysis such as his is useful and, in fact, necessary.
"Evidence on the magnitude of these impacts is necessary
for the design of optimal policy," he said. Greenstone proceeded to describe the methodology behind his results. By
calculating the extent to which past mortality rates have
increased due to high temperatures, Mr. Greenstone predicted the amount of "very hot" days there would be in 2100,
and combined the two figures to determine the rate of mortality increase in both India and the U.S. Before conducting
the study, Greenstone had considered that a reduction in the
number of very cold days (and the associated public health
risks) could mitigate the increase in mortality resulting
from the very hot ones. As a result of the study, however, he
determined that the impact of a reduction in dangerously
cold days was negligible. "The truth is the hottest days are
the worst days," Greenstone said.
Greenstone explained the large disparity between
American and Indian increases in mortality rates by suggesting that it was the high rate of poverty which made climate change affect Indians so much. He said, "If you need a
measure of why it's good to be rich, here's a measure." He
argued that people with less money would be less able to
adapt to the changing climate, and also suggested that the

"Would you date me?" The
MULTi dating discussion on Oct. 30
posed this question within the context of multi relationships and various complicated issues including
exotification, fetish-izing the other
and objectification. MULTi, the student affinity group for those who
self-identify as multi-racial, -ethnic,
socioeconomic or -religious, etc.,
hosts the discussion each semester.

Kavita Hardy 'O9 and May Maani
'O9 co-facilitated the discussion,
which, according to Hardy, is one of
the most successful of MULTi's
events and usually draws a large
audience. "We hold this conversation on multi dating every year
because we feel that it's something
that a lot of students can relate to,"
Hardy said.
This year, unlike last year, the
facilitators focused on integrating
different types of diversity
socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, religious
and tried to make a smooth transition between them, Hardy said.
Students of all four class years
attended the discussion for various
reasons. "I'm in a multi relationship,
and we wanted to see how other
multi relationships function, and
whether we could provide proof that
multi relationships can work,"
Adam Chuong 'l2 said. While
Chuong is not a member of MULTi,
he attended an information meeting
during Ride the Tide.
Hardy noted that the discussion
was particularly illuminating for
those new to the discourses of multi
relationships. "For the freshmen
especially, who I talked to, they felt
like this sort of opened their eyes to

G Patrick 'lO attended the discussion in part because he wanted to
learn more about others' experiences with exotification. "I don't
find exotification to be as much as
an issue as apparently other people
do, and I wanted to figure out what
the problem was," Patrick said.
Throughout the discussion, students brought up experiences and
elements of their relationships that
were at times reassuring, illuminating and disappointing.
"One student commented that his
multi relationship had received, in
my mind, surprising amounts of negative comments, which is something
that surprised me because I hold our
community to a higher standard
than that, and I was quite hurt to
know that a fellow student's relationship had not been accepted by

heat would lower the Indian rural agricultural wage by as
much as 29 percent, as the climate would become much less

conducive to agriculture.
"The costs of climate change are unlikely to be spread
evenly across the globe
This has not-so-hot implications
for ever producing a worldwide climate change policy."
Greenstone said during his lecture. He acknowledged, however, that his study was only designed to produce rough predictions of the impact of anticipated climate change.
In such a broad study, there were many variables to take
into account. Greenstone acknowledged the possibility that
his study may have "overestimated the costs" associated
with climate change, because his data did not take into
account adaptations that would be developed by people as a
result of climate change. Greenstone's estimations additionally varied widely depending on the models he used to assess
the changes in temperature resulting from climate change.
According to Visiting Professor ofEconomics Ted Crone,
Greenstone's analysis 'tiidn't deal with all the costs, or,
therefore, benefits of reduction ofcarbon emissions, but did
illustrate how difficult it is to do cost-benefit analysis for
real world externalities."
Students generally found the lecture to be informative
and timely. "I really enjoyed the lecture. We always learn
about climate change from a scientific standpoint, so it was
new to hear about it from an economic standpoint, as well,"
said Tania Doles 'l2.

Patrick felt similarly. "What I
thought was compelling was how
even though we're at Swat, sometimes there is this feeling of people
looking at multiracial couples and
not seeing them as just another couple, but as an interracial couple,"
Patrick said. "People do look at them

"There were some more positive
comments, too, [from] students who
had experienced relationships
between two people of color coming
together
and how their relationship differed from a relationship
between a person of color and a person not of color," Hardy said.
"It's certainly not the only discussion about racial interactions that
should occur," she said, "because
there are students that don't relate
to relationships, which was a concern raised during the discussion."

Anti-oppression workshops aim
for empowerment of community
BY MARTHA MARRAZZA

mmarrazl@swarthmore.edu

Training for Change, an activist
training organization, will conduct
workshops this Friday and Saturday on
issues surrounding community-building
and anti-oppression. The workshop is
entitled "Creating Community: Tools for
Collective Empowerment."
A group of students wanted to bring
Training for Change to Swarthmore to
address issues of marginalization that
occur every day on campus. "I worked
with George Lakey over the summer,
and I was bouncing a couple of ideas off
of him when he said that Training for
Change did these types of things, antioppression work, so he gave us a contact

there," said Maurice Weeks 'O9, one of
the workshop organizers. "A lot of workshops are focused on how to win campaigns or do other things, and they
always have a section on anti-oppression, but since I've been here there hasn't been a workshop on oppression
inside campus groups."
Zoe Bridges-Curry 'O9, another workshop organizer, said plans for the
upcoming event began as early as last
summer. "I think plans for the workshop started as a discussion among
friends," she said. "A community-building workshop was something that we
wanted to see on campus."
"There's not one group of people who
organized this, but there are representatives from several action-based groups
on campus that got together at the beginning of the semester to make this happen," Kavita Hardy 'O9 said. "We're really looking to reach people who are concerned with group dynamics, and that's
everyone from people who do sports to
people who are feeling marginalized in
the classroom. We're not targeting a particular segment of the population since
it's important for any group to talk
about these issues."
The workshop will take place over
two days this weekend, beginning with a
shorter Friday evening session in the
Admissions Commons and continuing
on Saturday afternoon in Bond Hall.
Attendees are encouraged to go to both
sessions if possible.
Student organizers of the workshop
focused on encouraging a wide variety
of students to register for the event. "We
have 99 people registered from so many
different groups there is an incredible
...

diversity among the people registered,"
Hardy said. "I think this weekend has a

lot of potential."

"They're good at having

discussion and internal
work but also at focusing
on concrete ways to
address problems."

organizer of the event, said the workshop will benefit a wide variety of students, not just student activists on campus. "In the first meetings we were
thinking that sports teams and other

groups, not just activists, but cultural
groups, comedy groups, even friend
groups, should have access to this," he
said.

"Most of what people
learn here is [from]
outside class. Training like
this can be mind-blowing."
Kavita Hardy 'O9
"It's the kind of thing that a community like this should go through in order
to remain healthy. I think we're all
excited to provide this opportunity for
all students here, especially new students who may be taking on these discourses and ways of thinking for the

first time," Delude-Dix said.
Hardy agreed, saying that issues of
oppression are present in a variety of
settings at Swarthmore and deserve discussion. "I think the dynamics of some
science classes make it difficult as a
woman to speak up, for example. I think
the dynamics of the IC community can
sometimes be very exclusive," she said.
Hardy gave more examples of oppressive power dynamics in social situations. "Team structures: when freshmen
come in they're not confident, and it
takes really good captains to create an
inclusive team. Not being able to talk in
class because of power dynamics surthe point is that it often
rounding race
happens without people realizing it,"
Hardy said.

"It's the kind of thing that
a community like this

Organizers worked with Dean Darryl
Smaw in the planning stages and
secured funding from the Office of
Multicultural Affairs, the Fun Fund and
the President's Office, Hardy said. While
an overwhelming number of students
have already registered for the training,
organizers said that the workshop is
still open for a few more students.
Bridges-Curry said the Training for
Change program is known for not only
facilitating discussion but also for moving beyond that discussion to equip students with real tools for change.
"They're good at having discussion and
internal work but also at focusing on
concrete ways to address problems.
They're not just into discussion, they're
also into the practical side of things,"
she said. "I have faith that they'll have a
workshop that is as useful as it is interesting for individuals."
Hardy said the upcoming training
will change the way students think
about things like power hierarchies in
their community. "I firmly believe that
most of what people learn here is not
from their classes but from things that
happen outside class," she said. "A training like this can be mind-blowing."

Class Awareness Month refocuses discussion on politics and aid
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu
Class Awareness Month kicked off earlier than usual this year to include discussions about the intersection of race, class
and the election. Later on in the month, the
dialogue will shift to issues currently facing
Swarthmore students, such as the recent
concern about financial injustice and inadequate financial aid packages.
Earlier this month, with an African
American candidate for president, a female
candidate for vice president and constant
references to Joe the Plumber, a dialogue
about the election quickly evolved into a dialogue about class. One of the month's first
events, last Thursday's "Class and Race in
the 2008 Presidential Election," was a forum
for just such a discussion. History professor
Allison Dorsey, political science professor
Carol Nackenoff and education professor
Cheryl Jones-Walker shed light on how race
and class played into the election. Student
questions led the panelists to talk about Joe
the Plumber, national identity, and what
types ofcandidates are seen as "electable."
"All [the panelists] had a similar understanding of [how candidates were] using Joe
the Plumber to talk about class. The way we
talk about [the] working class is very coded.
Democratic candidates have learned that
talking about poverty does not win elections.
So it's been interesting to see how the

Democratic candidates were really about the
middle class and eager to talk about the middle class. The Republican Party hasn't been
generally [eager], but now all of the sudden
in the eleventh hour, Joe the Plumber comes
up," Jones-Walker said. She considered the
panel a success, noting that nearly one hundred students attended and actively engaged
in the discussion.
Inspired by her participation on the

panel, Jones-Walker brought the discussion
into her Intro to Black Studies class. "I've
been careful not to talk about the elections
in my courses," she said. "But I've decided
for Wednesday to integrate a discussion into
part of my class because I can't imagine not
speaking to it the day after we've elected a
new president given how historic this elec-

tion is."
Besides addressing issues the entire
nation is facing, CAM is also focusing on
issues of race and class on campus. "One of
the aims of Class Awareness Month is to
give Swatties and students some perspective
on where other people are coming from in
the campus community, but it's also to
encourage dialogue about these issues,"
Brianne Gallagher 'O9, one of the students
who helped plan this month's events, said.
To this aim, two discussion groups were
hosted to kick off the month, a working class
discussion and a privileged class discussion.
The working class discussion took place on
October 27 and drew about a dozen people.

"[The discussion] gave me a lot to digest and
a lot to think about. It also really pushed me
towards trying to understand what it means
for me to be someone from a working class
background and to come into this world of
privilege," Sable Mensah 'll said. The group
talked about the impact they experienced on
a day-to-day basis as well as in the long term.
Also, to focus on issues at Swarthmore,
attendees at each event are asked to sign
fake dollar bills as a way to indicate that
they support two on-campus initiatives. One
asks the libraries to devote a portion of their
budget to ensure that it has up-to-date text-

books for each class on reserve for students
that don't want to or can't afford to buy
expensive textbooks that will only be used
for one semester. The second initiative
addresses seminar snack breaks. It asks
departments to put aside a seminar break
fund that students can choose to tap into to
purchase snacks for their seminar classes.
Some of the upcoming events also have
direct ties to Swarthmore. This Friday,
Tayarisha Poe 'l2 and Eva McKend 11 will
be performing alongside recognized spoken
word groups iLL-Literacy and 3xLady Crew
at Olde Club. "I don't write a lot about class,
but I'm so excited about this month because
it's giving me the opportunity to write about
class," McKend said. "I think in the
Swarthmore community we have tremendous issues surrounding financial injustice.
I wanted to take a break from spoken word

this semester, but since I'm dealing with
financial issues, I felt I needed to give voice
to students dealing with the same issues."
McKend said that like several other students
she's spoken to, her family received less
financial aid than expected this year. Her
performance on Friday will speak specifically to financial injustice.
A financial aid question and answer session on Nov. 18 will have incredible relevance for Swarthmore students. "We turn in
all these important forms and paperwork
and get this number. A lot of people might
not understand what it means. [So it's] a
chance for the student body to go into the
financial aid office and say, 'Can you shed
some light on this?'" Mensah, a CAM organizer, said. Recent news concerning the
changes in individual aid packages from
year to year and the inflexibility ofaid packages is bound to make this session popular.
Other events this month include a lecture
by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot
Diaz, a movie screening and an anti-oppression workshop. At its heart, each event is
designed to raise awareness about class
issues and get people talking.
"There are a lot of issues that play into
and intersect with class," Gallagher said.
"It's not necessarily separate from women's
rights. It's not necessarily separate from
race and injustices in that regard. It can
really potentially involve a lot of people and
get people talking."

Obama victory exhilarates campus
The results of Tuesday's election inspired hope and celebration among many students
BY CLARISSA SKINNER
cskinnl@swarthmore.edu

On the night of Tuesday, November 4, 2008,
Swarthmore students clustered around televisions and
computer screens across campus
in dorm lounges, in
Paces, in Tarble. Hours of anxious waiting and second
guessing finally culminated in screaming, dancing and
singing across campus as the West Coast poll results came
in: Barack Obama had been elected the next president of
the United States.
To Obama's supporters
on
Swarthmore's campus and across the country, the outcome of the election marks an unprecedented transcendence of partisan, racial and geographical differences.
After winning the election, Obama opened his victory
speech with an affirmation of the opportunities available
to all participants in the American democratic process. "If
there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is
a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if
the dream of our Founders is alive in our time, who still
questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your
answer," Obama said to a crowd of 125,000 supporters in
Chicago's Grant Park.
Obama's promise of a post-partisan society appealed
not only to the Democrats on campus, but to Republican
students as well. David Pupkin 'O9, who helped found the
current chapter of the College Republicans, acknowledged
that Obama's victory says something powerful about the
state of American politics. "This is the revitalization of
the American Dream. People around the world can say, 'I
too can watch my child become President of the United
States by the sheerfact that if they work hard enough and
have the skill, anything is possible.' The United States is
again the paragon of possibility," Pupkin said.
Dani Noble 'l2 captured the combination of euphoria
and incredulity that many students expressed over the
course of the evening. "It's surrealism," Noble said.
"People are overcome by the election, by the hope and
potential for this country to be the nation that we would
like it to be."
Many students were won over by Obama's promise to
restore a broken political system. "Four years ago, I lost
faith in my country, and today it was restored almost completely," Margot Adams 'lO said.
The success of Obama's campaign has been widely
attributed to his unique ability to construct a coalition of
disparate demographic blocs. Referring to the diversity of
his supporters in his victory speech, Obama said, "It's the
answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat
and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native
American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled."
-

"I just started singing and dancing. I
called my parents and made up a
song about Obama. I just started
yelling and smiling, and I haven't
stopped smiling since."

Hundreds of students stare, mesmerized, at the projector screen in Upper Tarble as results from exit polls pour in
Tuesday night. Later that evening, Obama supporters cheered and reveled at Obama's ascension to the presidency.
an old, black man, and he was crying, I understood. These
people lived in an America where they were not real people. They risked their lives forty years ago when they
walked through the streets singing that they will overcome, and now they have," Farnos-Wilker said.
Noah Lang 'lO said that his mother offered an interesting historical perspective on the election. "My mother
grew up in the 1950's in Tennessee. The first thing that she
messaged to me tonight was, T remember segregated
water fountains!' That was the first thing to her mind,"
Lang said.
At Swarthmore, the reaction to this election was elation. An Obama cardboard cut-out went crowd-surfing,
Sixteen Feet sang a rendition of The Star-Spangled
Banner, and McCain was serenaded off of his speech platform by masses of students singing Steam's "Na Na Hey
Hey Kiss Him Goodbye." Students were still singing,
yelling and dancing in celebration hours after Obama's
victory speech.
Upon the announcement of the election results, Luke
Rampersad 10 said, "I just started singing and dancing. I
called my parents and made up a song about Obama. I just
started yelling and smiling, and I haven't stopped smiling
since." Brigette Davis 'lO said, "I lost my mind. I think I
actually blacked out. I ran over the entire campus in
about ten minutes."

Andrew Loh 'lO, an international student from

Malaysia, could not vote in the election, but was nonetheless blown away by its outcome. "I just stood up and

stared and took it all in, because this is a part of
I was compelled to receive it, to perceive
Swarthmore
it, to just sink myself and immerse myself in that feeling.
It's a feeling of solidarity, of happiness, of hope, of change,
...

No candidate with a background as diverse as Obama's
has ever been elected to the country's highest office. Early
in his candidacy, many observers questioned whether
Obama could overcome historically entrenchedracial barriers. The candidate proved skeptics wrong on Tuesday
night and his ability to dismantle racial barriers was
inspiring to many students. "This man is biracial, his

States. That makes me smile," Ali Farnos Wilker 'll said.
Brigette Davis 10 captured the perception that the election's outcome reflects the beginning of a new era when
she said, "America has transcended; it has reached a new
plane of existence."
Although his campaign did not emphasize Obama's
racial identity as an African-American candidate, the
election of a biracial president marked an important turning point in American history. "We're studying the civil
rights movement in class, and when the camera panned to

Many Swarthmore students campaigned extensively
for Obama and felt that his victory was their victory, too.
Obama himself said that the campaign "drew strength
from the millions of Americans who volunteered and
organized and proved that more than two centuries later
a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from the Earth."
Molly Weston 'lO, president of the College Democrats,
noted that college students were extraordinarily active in
this election. "We're college students. We have the energy
to go out and stand on our feet and knock on doors. People
that have never been involved in an election before are
really coming out. They're taking the time to make a difference," Weston said.

Daniel Leigh 'O9 said, "Door-to-door voter canvassing can
increase voter turn-out by seven percent. It's about one
citizen going out and talking to other citizens. Door-todoor, person-to-person voter contact. It's far and away the
most effective contact."
After the election of Obama, Noble, who also did canvassing, said, "I think everyone who had a part in the election, in canvassing, the phone bank, feels like they personally won tonight. Obviously a lot of it's a wash, but I
can think of two to three people that I convinced to vote
for Barack Obama who wouldn't have otherwise, and to
me that's powerful."
Obama's victory has significant implications for
America's standing in the international community.
Speaking of Obama's election, Jess Engebretson 'O9 said,
"I hope it means that the course we're going on as a country can change for the better. It'll change the perception of
America in the world, the place of America in the world,
and America's ability to act in the world."
Loh offered his perspective as an international student.
"The world's going to be very happy. His foreign experience definitely shaped him in his convictions, his ideals
and his values. He's sympathetic to how other people
think and feel. And you can see that in how he's running
now. He's running on a platform of compromise and consensus. He's not only the Democratic nominee, but also
the world's nominee," Loh said.
Now that he has won the presidency, Obama faces the
challenge of making good on his campaign promises in
spite of the accelerating economic downturn and present
U.S. involvement in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama
acknowledged these obstacles, saying, "The road ahead
will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there
in one year or even one term, but America, I have never
been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get
there. I promise you: We as a people will get there."
Katie Schaffer 'l2 said she has no illusions about
Obama's progressivism and said that "people looking for
significant change" may be disappointed by Obama's moderate stance on many issues. "First of all, he's inheriting
an awful state of affairs, and second of all, he's a moderate," Schaffer said.
Obama acknowledges the challenges that lie ahead, but
said he does not believe they are insurmountable. In his
victory speech, Obama said that a new approach to domestic politics and international affairs is essential to overcoming adverse conditions
and he promised to bring
this new approach to Washington. "Change has come to
America," Obama said in his speech, summing up the
momentous outcome of a fiercely contested race.

AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION

Fiscal crisis may be a boon for applications
BY TYLER WARNER
CHICAGO MAROON (U. CHICAGO)
(U-WIRE)
When the economy sours, students start
thinking about grad school. At least that's what early
graduate application numbers at the University of
Chicago seem to indicate.
Applications at the University's Law School have
increased 10 percent compared to this time last year,
according to Ann Perry, associate dean of admissions for

the Law School. She noted that economic downturns tend

to spur increased application yields. The Law School saw
a similar increase in applications in 2001, she said.
During that same period, the economy shed three million
jobs.
A popular explanation for the trend is that students
attempt to dodge the job market by turning to graduate

school instead.
Increased interest in graduate school has been noted
outside the University as well, as more students take
graduate school entry exams. The number of GMATs
business school entry exams
taken in the United
States increased by about six percent compared to last
year, according to Jennifer Kedrowski, the GMAT program manager for Kaplan Test Prep and Admissions.
Outside of the U.S., the figure rose by 22 percent.
But like most of those interviewed, Kedrowski would
not directly attribute testing numbers to an economic
downturn.
"Traditionally, students, those in the workforce and
those who have recently lost their jobs turn to business
school, law school and grad school, as safe refuges to ride

out the economic storm," she said. "Graduate-level programs saw this trend in the aftermath of September 11,
and we are seeing another shift now."
Kedrowski also noted that registration for free practice tests and seminars has achieved even higher levels
of growth: attendance has more than doubled some
months this year. The number of students registered for
all tests has risen in the past few years, although
Kedrowski noted that MCAT courses are generally less
affected by economic instability because the preparation
for medical school requires a number of years. Interest
in the GMAT, however, has shown the largest increase

over the past year.

"Traditionally those who have
recently lost their jobs turn to business school, law school and grad
school, as safe refuges to ride out
the economic storm."

Jennifer Kedrowski
GMAT Program Manager for Kapian
According to Perry, the financial crisis will not necessarily reorient career goals. But it could encourage
earlier applications from those who would have other-

wise put off graduate school. "Usually someone's already
been thinking about law school; now they just move it up
a few years," she said.
At the Divinity School, however, the trend seems less
apparent. According to Teresa Hord Owens, the dean of
students for the Divinity School, this year's application
numbers are on track to wind up at roughly the same
level as prior years. To date, the Divinity School has
received 300 applications out of a yearly average of 400.
In fact, Owens worries that the financial crisis could
have a negative impact on graduate studies. As problems
in the financial sector leave credit harder to come by, she
worries that many students who want to attend graduate
school may be unable to afford the rising costs of continuing education.
"If credit for student loans becomes tighter, it may
have an adverse impact on students' ability to finance
their graduate education," she said. "Ph.D. programs are
now financed more generously in terms of student aid
here at the Divinity School, but master's level students
will likely feel the pinch more immediately."
Unlike many other University graduate programs, the
Law School, which uses rolling admissions, has a better

opportunity to gauge application numbers this early in
the cycle. In the Physical Sciences Division, time will tell

whether a similar increase will be seen.
"Conventional wisdom holds that applications to
graduate schools increase when the economy stumbles,"
said Richard Hefley, dean of students in the Physical
Sciences Division, in an e-mail interview. "It is still too
early in the application season to draw any meaningful
conclusions about the applicant pool for 2009-2010."

Voter politics influenced by family Sea melting glaciers
BY HANNAH BOEN
DAILY TOREADOR (TEXAS TECH)
(U-WIRE)
Steven and Elyse Keaton
could be considered by many to be zealous
left-wing hippies, raising children with
entirely different values from the characters
on the television series "Family Ties."
Upon watching the show, viewers are left
to wonder if a real family exists with such
contradictory political ideals.
But Alan Reifman, a Texas Tech professor
of human development and family studies,
said a voter's family is only a part of their
political influence.
"How often that exists in real life," he said
about the probability of a real-life Keaton
clan, "I don'tknow."
The professor, who studies adolescence
including
and transition into adulthood
political identification said parents do play
some role in developing a child's party loyalty, but so do other factors, including school,
peers and the media.
Although children often are influenced by
their parents' political ideals, Reifman said,
it is likely the exposure to politics in college
can be another significant influence.
For Reifman, proof of this influence lies in
the Bennington College Study led by late psychologist Theodore Newcomb.
Reifman said the private women's college
in Vermont was widely known as liberal, but
students came to the college mostly from
Republican families. The study, conducted in
the 19305, showed education affected political
identity.

"You figure the kids will be fairly conservative," Reifman said, "but when professors
and upper-year students are liberal, the two
forces hit each other."
Reifman said the study showed conservative women who pursued higher education at
a liberal college may have left the party loyalty of their families and shifted to the left.
"A roughly small group of women
remained conservative," he said, "stuck to

THE PHOENIX

their families' viewpoints." The women who
remained conservative, Reifman said, were
aware of the shifting views of their peers, but
made a conscious effort to stay close to their
family values.
While the Bennington study suggested the
college environment plays a large role,
Reifman said he believes the results would
not be consistent on Tech's campus.
"Certainly, Texas Tech is not overwhelmingly liberal like Bennington College is," he
said, suggesting that Tech students who grew
up in a conservative household will be
exposed to much the same ideals in college.
Reifman said coming to Tech from primarily Republican regions will receive the same
exposure on campus, but students who come
from more liberal regions may be exposed to
very different political ideals.
"If what you're exposed to in college is the
same as what you're exposed to at home, it's
probably going to reinforce what you
believed at home," he said. "The difference is
if college experience clashes from ideals
taught at home."
That difference, Reifman said, is where
students may allow their pursuit of higher
education to have an influence on political
ideals.
Cindy Rugeley, assistant professor of
political science at Tech, said researchers
cannot be 100-percent certain, but the best
indicator of political socialization is family.
"Family is a big part and it continues
through to whether or not they vote and
party identification," she said.
When children are young, Rugeley said,
they learn from their families, and what they

learn typically follows them through their
entire life. She acknowledged young people
often change their opinions, and that does
not exclude politics.
Rugeley attributed political shifts in college to the fact that higher education is being

pursued.
"As people become more educated," she
said, "they tend to become more liberal."

WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS (NYU)
(U-WIRE)
It is getting colder in New
York, but hotter underwater.
According to a recent study by NYU
researchers, it's not just warming air temperature that causes glaciers to melt.
The Center for Atmosphere Ocean
Science, a part of the Courant Institute of
Mathematical Science at NYU, discovered
that rising oceanic temperatures have
been melting glaciers from below land
surfaces.
David Holland, the director of the center and lead author of the study, found

"Our goal is conservation
of efficiency. Better than
changing a light bulb is
not using it at all."
Jeremy Friedman
NYU Sustainability
Administrator
that rising ocean temperatures are more
important thanfirst thought.
Scientists originally believed that
warming air temperatures were causing
surface snow on the inland Greenland glacier to melt. However, Holland's team
found that it was actually subsurface
water temperatures that were rising and
causing the ice sheet to break apart.
Using data from other studies that
relied on NASA's Airborne Topographic
Mapper, the researchers noticed a rapid
rate of glacial thinning, which coincided
with rising subsurface water temperature.

November 6, 2008

"Modest changes in atmospheric circulation can drive warm ocean water
towards and under the edges of the ice
sheets, and when this happens, the ice
sheets fall apart, and the rate of rise of sea
level increases," Holland said. "This is not
so much a warming of the global ocean as
it is a simple redirection of warm waters
towards the ice sheets."
However, Holland noted that it would
be the application of the information
gained from the Greenland region that
would be most important. Holland found
that if these results translated to
Antarctica, which holds 10 times the volume of ice compared to Greenland, the
impact would be much worse.
"Antarctica holds the potential for
producing a rapid change in global sea
level in this century and beyond a situation that, if it happened, society is illprepared to deal with," he said.
Jeremy Friedman, project administrator of the NYU Sustainability Task
Force, said that students could have a
tangible impact on fighting the effects of
global warming.
"The fire in NYU students has been
driving the entire initiative," Friedman
said. "From participating in sustainability task force to doing research, student activists act like watchdogs keeping the university honest. Our goal is
conservation of efficiency. Better than
changing the light bulb is not using it at

all."

Although the research warns that a
continuation of glacial melting could
become a dire situation, Holland admitted that researchers in the field have no
way of gauging how long it would take or
to what degree sea levels will change.
The National Science Foundation,
which offers more than $6 billion per year
to scientific studies, supported the study
through a grant to NYU in conjunction
with the NSF Office ofPolar Programs.

The end of an era: counting down the films that capture the Bush years
cal subtext. This racist, testosterone-filled
movie helps explain how so many
Americans are able to paint millions of
Middle Easterners as an amorphous,

abstract "Other" that can be demonizedfor
the purpose of our political discourse.
Madness? This is America!

JOEL SWANSON
They're Watching
I've said from the start of this column
that I intend to write about movies in a
broader social context, examining theirrelevance within the framework of contemporary societal issues and current events.
This week, what event could be more perti-

nent than Election Day?
The 2008 presidential election mercifully marks the close of the long and painful
George W. Bush era, and although we have
to wait until January to actually get rid of
the guy, I thought it was appropriate to list,

on the week that marks the selection ofhis
successor, the movies that I believe to be
most emblematic of the Bush years.
Therefore, without further ado, I present to you my list of the five films that historians will look back on and wonder how
we could possibly have elected and supported this guy.

5. "Left Behind" (Columbia TriStar
Pictures, 2001)
Few groups have been more studied and.
vilified in interpreting the success of the
Bush political coalition than the emergent
religious right, and few pop culture phenomena better show these people in all of
their glory than "Left Behind," a movie
based on the frighteningly successful series
of Christian novels about the end times.
"Left Behind" tells the story of reporter
Buck Williams, played with appropriate
gusto by child actor turned evangelical
activist Kirk Cameron. This is the sort of
film that begins with the destruction of
thousands of Syrian jets by God as a means
of protecting Israel. You pretty much know
what you're getting into from there. Along
the way, we get to meet Nicolae Carpathia,
a United Nations official who actually
turns out to be the Antichrist. If you, like
myself and most other secular left-wing
Swarthmore students, are more than a bit
curious that people actually believe that
Obama is the Antichrist, you should watch
this movie to see how the Other Half
thinks.

4. "300" (Warner Brothers, 2007)

Few movies better capture the paranoia

and racism of right-wing political discourse than this piece of cinematic dreck.

This lavish, visually arresting video game
masquerading as a film tells us the story of
the Battle of Thermopylae, where three
hundred Spartans fought valiantly but
futilely against a vastly larger Persian
invasion force. Since the Persians are darkskinned and tyrannical and the Spartans

are white and (at least comparatively) democratic, it isn't very hard to read the politi-

8

3. "W." (Lions Gate Entertainment, 2008)
Okay, so it might seem like a bit of a copout to say that a biopic about George W.
Bush reflects the George W. Bush era. But
what's fascinating about "W." is that it was
made before the end of Bush's presidency.
It's as if filmmaker Oliver Stone decided
that history has already declared its verdict on Bush, that there isn't any need to
wait a bit longer before making a movie
about him. "W." is unlikely to be very successful; Americans are unlikely to want to
see a movie about the president who can't
leave office fast enough. But the fact that it
was created at this point in timespeaks volumes about Bush's unlikely ability to unite
the American people behind the unani-

the American people feel about Bush.
So there you have it, five films that I feel
represent America during the George W
Bush years. As awful as they've surely
been, at least they've inspired a variety of
artistic depictions. This, of course, raises a
good question: Who are we going to mock

now, with Bush gone? Luckily, the farce
that was the McCain 'OB campaign leaves us
with plenty of material. How long can it

mous decision that he is a failure as a president.

2. "Fahrenheit 9/11" (IFC/Lions Gate
Films, 2004)
The surprising financial success of
Michael Moore's controversial anti-Bush
documentary, which is deeply flawed in
many ways, at least shows that millions of
Americans were willing to consume entertainment that openly questioned the
motives of their president. Nevertheless,
"Fahrenheit 9/11" was ultimately unable to
influence enough voters to swing the 2004
election in favor of John Kerry, so its actual value as political propaganda is questionable at best
it probably only served
to reinforce the views of the half of the
country that already hated Bush by that
point. Nonetheless, it did succeed in winning President Bush a Razzie award for
Worst Actor, which means that Bush managed to do something better than anyone
else that year
And the number one film that tells us
about the Bush era in America is
...

1 "G.I. Samurai" (Toho, 1979)

While browsing the movies in McCabe
freshman year, I discovered this one
a
truly bizarre, widely forgotten Japanese
samuraimovie. Of course, I had to watch it.
But the aspect of the film that struck me as
strangest was when I learned that it had
been remade in 2005. Why, after all these
years, would a justifiably obscure samurai
movie need a remake? And then it struck
me: this film is the perfect parable for the
present time. "G.I. Samurai" tells the story
of a small group of Japanese forces that
invade 16th century Japan. (Don't ask how
they do this; it's never really clear.) Despite
seeming to have the advantage in terms of
military technology, they are invading a
land about which they know little, for no
apparent reason and with no plan for how
to win peace, and they go in with far too
few forces to do the job. Sound familiar?
The analogy gets even better at the end of
the movie, when the filmmakers seemingly
either ran out of money or were too bored
to make a proper ending, and all of the
main characters just die anticlimactically.
(Sorry ifI ruined it for you, but let's face it,
you're not going to see this movie anyway.)
The filmmakers just wanted to get the
movie over with at that point. Sort of how

Digital
I have many happy vinyl memories: sifting through
my mother's old record collection, pouring over the
psychedelic album jackets that seemed to be from
another world, fidgeting with our turntable's needle to
find the most ridiculous track on "The Warsaw Men's
Choir Sings Classic Polish War Songs." After a listening experience that had me rolling on the floor in sonic
ecstacy, I even started to agree with those vinyl diehards who say that the sound quality of a CD is incomparable to that of a record (try listening to Lou Reed's
"Transformer" first on a computer and then on a
record player; let me know if you can hear the difference or if at any point your body is overcome with the
desire to make orgiastic contact with the ground).
Recently, vinyl has been doing more than furnishing fuzzy childhood memories to 'Bos babies like
me who grew up treasure hunting in their
parents' piles of musty records. Music listeners are choosing to buy vinyl over
CDs and, in some cases, over digital
downloads, reviving the medium
which seemed doomed to rot in sale

bins. CDs, which many once
believed would usher in the
death of vinyl, are now being
eclipsed by their 7-inch predecessors. RIAA reports have
shown that the sale of physica
CDs has been waning since th
early years of the new millennium. But while CD sales fell by
17% in 2007, 7-inch single sales
increased by 13%.
Although
records have
always carried with them the
essence of cool, it has become
increasingly hip for teenagers
and young adults to purchase
vinyl. Alongside obsessive collectors, kids now scavenge for
retro gems and snatch up new 7inch releases frombands such as
the White Stripes. Some club DJs

"Cream dried beef biscuits," "vegetarian vegetable," "blintz bar,"
"old-fashioned meatloaf," "patty grilla bar," and, let's not forget,
"pasta bar." These delicacies are all available at Sharpies, your allcampus food source. But don't be intimidated by these incomprehensible terms; there are alternatives available to you at Sharpies.
For those times when the lines are too long because everybody
decides to have lunch at the same time on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
there is a salad bar, a sandwich bar, two panini presses and a wok.
There are other options besides cereal, and here are some toothsome
delicacies and tips by our own Swarthmorean chefs.
Tired of the meals Sharpies had to offer, Esther Burson'lo looked
into the cafeteria's other facilities. "I think I just got tired of the
options that were there everyday... and I realized that it doesn't take
much more time to get creative," she said.Burson cooks a good deal
at home but hadn't thought of doing the same in Sharpies until after
freshmen year, when shedecided that it was more varied and healthier for her to make her own food. Whenever Burson goes to Sharpies,
she first makes a round and scouts for unusual or different foods or
ingredients. "I don't think I'm particularly creative, I just try to
work with what Sharpies has. It really depends on what they have on
a given day," she explained. Her default, though, is to check out the
salad bar and get ingredients for a sandwich, salad, or stir-fry.
broccoli,
When making a stir-fry, Burson cuts up vegetables
and after warming up the wok and
onions, mushrooms, peppers
adding some water, she steams them for a couple of minutes, adding
soy sauce or other seasoning. To make fried rice, also using the wok,
she beats an egg, acquired at the grill, and scrambles it. Burson then
adds brown rice, usually found at the vegetarian bar, and mixes it in
with some peas or corn. One of Burson's favorite salads includes
mixed greens, sliced apple, raisins, feta cheese, and sunflower seeds.
For a sandwich, Burson recommends adding hummus, and whatever other interesting ingredient you can find, as well as using the
panini press. "Any sandwich is better with heat," Burson said. Her
current favorite is making a grilled cheese sandwich with sharp
cheddar and an egg from the grill.
The grill is another great resource at Sharpies, serving up fast
food options every day and making omelets on weekends with ingredients from the other food stations brought by students. Sarah
Reece'll and Megan Colombo'll prefer to use the wok to make their
own omelets, however. "We make our own omelets, because at the
grill they don't use real eggs, they use the ones in cartons," they both
explained.
Sundays and Wednesdays, Sharpies brings Swarthmore students
additional ingredients to work with: chocolate chips and M&M's
from ice cream bar. With these, Nicole Singer 'lO and Myles Dakan
10 make "Banana Boats," a campfire dessert Singer learned from a
friend. "I came up with the idea to make it in Sharpies when I saw
that sundae bar conveniently supplied all the ingredients, and that
the rungs of the toaster ovens happen to be the perfect distance apart
for baking bananas," Singer wrote in an email response. To make
this delicious dessert, according to Singer, get a banana, pull back
the strip of its peel on the inside of the banana's curve, but do not
detach it. Scoop out about 1/3 of the banana lengthwise, and stuff
with marshmallows and chocolate chips; toffee, peanut butter, and
M&M's could also work as scrumptious alternatives. Put the peel
back in its original place, covering the stuffings, and place the
banana in the toaster oven, making sure that both the top and bottom elements are turned on. Once the peel turns black, the banana
boat is ready to eat.
Another original make-it-yourself-dessert is sauteed apples. Back
to the wok, Burson melts butter, then adds cut apples and raisins and
when the apple becomes soft, sugar and cinnamon.
To learn other recipes adapted for our cafeteria, a student cookbook is available at Sharpies, to peruse and add on to.

Crumb, a legendary figure in underground comix movement.
Born in Philadelphia. Crumb moved to the HaightAshbury district of San Francisco in 1967 and immersed
himself in the counterculture movement. His trippy
inventions include Fritz the Cat (made into a movie in
1970) and the Keep on Truckin' illustration (also a Grateful
Dead song). But what Crumb is best known for is his no
holds barred take on animation, one that encompasses old
style drawing with a laissez-faire and semi-satirical atti-

RE CONSIDERING THE AUDACITY OF ART
charged male characters and the weak women. "Three
Graces” is characteristic of Crumb's drawings of women.
They are universally large-breasted with huge buttocks.
I'll admit that I did not so much as chuckle during my
visit to the ICA. I'm one of those easily offended types and
1 can't find humor in Angelfood xMcSpade or female sex
slaves. To people like me. Crumb offers “A Word With You
Feminist Women,” a strip printed in “Big Ass #2” in 1971
In the first few panels, a smiling Crumb appears on a
couch, ready for reconciliation. As the one-sided dialogue
ensues. Crumb works himself up, insisting, “I'm not a
politician! I’m an artist!” The comic concludes with a
close-up of Crumb's enraged face as the illustrator

tude to all things good: sex, drugs and rock and roll (well,
early blues, but you get the picture). In the 1980s ho moved
to the south of France, where he continues to draw comix.
Comics are often relegated outside the domain of fine
art, but Crumb has recently been welcomed behind the
velvet ropes of the art world. In 2004, the Ludwig Museum
in Cologne. Germany hosted a retrospective of Crumb’s
work. The exhibition at the ICA features works from
throughout Crumb’s career, building up from a 1959 drawing to a series of wooden spools completed in 2006.
Crumb's fine eye for detail, conveyed through minute
illustrations and lengthy chunks of dialogue, demands a
time commitment from the exhibition's visitor (the New
York Times recommends spending two to three hours at
the show). Each scene on his bustling pages is filled to the
brim with the tiniest strokes of the pen as Crumb represents individual strands of hair and the fine grain of wood
floors. Traces of white liquid eraser are often visible as
Crumb rehashes his designs. His aggressive characters
rant about life ad nauseam, covering Crumb's comics in

screams, “Fuck You!”

While it can be difficult for me to separate form from
content, I was able to enjoy a few of the more neutral
pieces in the show. My first exposure to Harvey Pekar
may have been in the movie starring Paul Giamatti. but 1
had the chance to view strips from “American Splendor”
at the ICA. I was also pleasantly amused by “Short
History of America,” a color serigraph printed in 2001 In
the 15-panel print, a natural wilderness slowly succumbs
to the adverse effects of industry and modernity. In the
final three panels, Crumb presents three possible conclusions to American history —■ ecological disaster, the space

piles of dialogue.

For some. Crumb is a comic genius. He boldly goes

wr here only the most audacious (or most insensitive)
comedians will venture, tackling any and all topics that
are politically incorrect. Angelfood McSpade. the Zap
Comix ‘Dream Girl of the Month,” may perhaps be his
most offensive character. Crumb combines a number of
derogatory stereotypes to create McSpade. Her dark face
with wide lips comes straight from the minstrel's stage
and her palm leafskirt indicates the ‘primitive” nature of
Africa.
Crumb s depiction of women is also less-than flattering. Females are sex objects and eye candy; Crumb graphically renders sexual encounters between the highly-

age and “the ecotopian solution.”
R. Crumb’s Underground is one of those hit-or-miss
exhibitions. You either love or hate Robert Crumb. If you
have a sense of humor, this show provides an endless supply of material to absorb. If you're easily offended, it’s not
your best bet. My advice? Think about your humor radar

Video games? Gotta catch 'em all, my fellow junkies

is a video game, and I'm not entirely sure what
Interpretation Theory is but it sounds like it could be a

FLETCHER WORTMANN
We Are Far Too Young and Clever
We all have vices, and in the wild world of college, we are
instructed to indulge them shamelessly. But, of course, this
is Swarthmore, and the strongest narcotic available is free
ibuprofen distributed by matronly health-center attendants.
Here the sex is infrequent and oppressive, inextricably psychologically linked with getting bonked in the head by neon
condoms during the freshman orientation play; the drugs
are nonexistent; the rock *n roll is performed a capella in
five-part harmony by girls in matching purple sweaters.
With conventional avenues of reality-modification closed,
Swarthmore students must seek out alternative addictions.
And, as always, we succeed. You see the junkies here every
day. Our skin is sallow and our eyes red, our thumbs convulsing at imaginary buttons, slaying invisible Metroids
against the sulphur skies of planet Zebes. We are broken,
hearts depleted, and lives lost. I am talking about our universal indulgence. I am talking about video games.
You scoff. But, you insist, "I am one of the popula' kids!
I have a girlfriend, and I have seen her while she is not
wearing a shirt, several times even! I play sports, Fletcher.
Sports." But we are undeniably addicted to electronic entertainment in all of its insidious forms. Yes, fantasy golf is a
video game, that thing online where you shuffle little pixelly gems around until they explode into arbitrary numbers

video game even if it isn't. Also consider Facebook, wherein one collects a mercenary menagerie of freakish, brightlycolored characters that do little other than chirp their own
names over and over again. These lovable and highly marketable creatures can be collected, traded, photographed
(snap!) and then ruthlessly judged for their aesthetic qualities; given proper time and experience, they may even
evolve into biophysicists or temporary accountants. Of
course these two-dimensional virtual familiars aren't quite
the same as 'Actual friends," but hey! Gotta catch 'em all!
None of us are immune to this kind of thing. I am an irredeemable geek and I am willing to admit this in a public
forum, but not without dragging every one of you repressed
degenerates down with me.
That being said, video games are awesome. They are
engaging, they promote proper hand-eye coordination or
something, they are incredibly entertaining, and they also
silence the endless sobbing voices in my head better than a
thousand packets of free ibuprofen. Everyone should play
video games. As a trusted journalist, it is my responsibility to guide my peers towards quality entertainment, with
the impartial, understated approach my columns are
known for. That said, here are descriptions of the three
major game systems currently available, two of which are
produced by massive faceless corporate behemoths and one
of which lets you wave your arms around and is the origin
ofall joy.
The Sony Play Station 3 is the most notorious of modern
systems. It is also the most expensive, costing something in
the range of seven hundred billion dollars, although as an
alternate payment method, Sony has agreed to accept their
customers' personal submission to sexual slavery, in addition to offering a very generous black-market kidney
exchange program (gamers who convince a friend to trade
in organs will also receive a coupon good for a free copy of
"Soul Calibur IV" at participating locations). The
Play Station 3 is the most powerful system currently on the
market, with lower-end models possessing not one but several giga-things of memory, and is roughly the size of a
small Honda. Indeed, I encourage any and all liberal arts
students who can afford to spend six hundred dollars on a
video game system in our current economy to immediately
rush out and buy one.
The X-Box 360 is known for its utterly confounding
name, which proclaims to be cubical, cross-shaped and

spherical simultaneously. The "X" may be intended to signify 'Extremity" of some sort, and the "360" some kind of
snowboarding trick a person might perform twenty feet in
the air while drinking an energy drink and high-fiving a
ninja. Of course, since the system is produced by those
counterculture badasses at Microsoft, the name is entirely
appropriate. The X-Box is known for its high failure rate,
although this may be deliberate, as the only thing more
extreme than killing aliens with an assault rifle is doing so
using a video game system that has spontaneously burst
into flames. Also, the X-Box features the game "Bioshock,"
a first-person shooting game that incorporates a critique 6T
writer Ayn Rand.
Microsoft has yet to release
"Remembrance of Things Ultimate" or "F. Scott Fitzgerald's
The Legend of Zelda," but announcements are surely forthcoming.
The final company currently producing consoles is the
ancient and venerable Nintendo, producers of the beloved
Nintendo Wii. Ah, yes. The Nintendo Wii. Say its name
slowly. It's okay, no one's looking. Say it. Nin. Ten. Doh.
Wiiiii. My sin, my soul. It is undoubtedly the most subtle
and sumptuous of video game consoles. You wantto curl up
with it at night and whisper secrets to it as you fall asleep,
not that I have done so more than once or twice. The Wii is
notable for its unique controls, where a motion-sensing
remote is used to direct your character inevitably into pits
of spikes or molten rock. The Wii also has the game "Super
Smash Brothers Brawl." I love "Super Smash Brothers
Brawl." It is fantastic. It is like sex, if sex somehow
involved explosions and hammers and Italian stereotypes
fighting transvestite ninjas fighting giant inflatable penguins on top of a spaceship. It is like a gentle summer rain
on your face, or like a symphony.
I hope I have helped you to make an informed decision.
If one is to waste life and shrivel brain cells (and one is!),
then one should only employ the highest-quality entertainment equipment. Friends and family will age and die, but
the unrequited love of decades-old Japanese intellectual
properties is forever. It cannot be bought, except for the fact
that it can be bought for $249.99 plus tax. We can try to find
meaning in the company of others, in self-expression, or in
social service. But let me tell you, my friends: that princess
is in another castle.
Fletcher is probably old enough to know better. Other literary game titles he consideredfor this article included Catch-666, Pride and Extreme Prejudice, and Super Karamazov
Brothers. You can reach him atfwortmal@swarthmore.edu.

Hats off to creative costumes, sexy or scary
BY AMBER WANTMAN
awantmal@swarthmore.edu

Halloween

starts off innocently
enough: unsuspecting toddlers waddle
from door to door of perfect strangers,
asking to be tricked or treated. Poor little
Billy, if he only knew what he was asking,
he might pause before he catapulted that
Baby-Ruth down his gullet. Hey! I don't
care if "Uncle Jimmy" let you take five
pieces of Nutrageous; He's NOT your

uncle! He laced that chocolate with
arsenic, and at this very moment he's
watching you from his front window with
a ghoulish smile, curling his upper lip
and letting his long finger-nails rap
against each other in a spider-like fashion. If only Billy knew: Halloween is not
an innocent holiday. It never was, it never
will be and it only gets more corrupt as
we get older.
The evolution of Halloween rites-of-

passage continues on the path of degradation in middle school. Boys generally

roam the streets armed with silly-string,
shaving cream and egg-cartons, asserting
their manhood (or hoodlumry?) by defacing property that does not belong to them.
Middle school females, on the other hand,
take the high road to assert their womanhood. In the 7th or Bth grade, girls usually
dawn their first adult-themed costume: in
the case of me and my girlfriends, we Bat
Mitzvahed ourselves on October 31st of

12

the 2002 school year (our last of middle
school): we trick-or-treated as prostitutes.
Things pass from R-rated to X-rated
very quickly as students gain years, wisdom and, of course, balls. Here at
Swarthmore, we are blessed with a plethora of different costumes, from the sexy to
the shudder-inducing unsexy to the phallically symbolic (there was no shortage of
protuberant banana costumes this year)
to the just-plain-gonzo. At Swarthmore,
however, not all students give into the
sexual explosion that has become "Adult
Halloween" as a result of the monopoly
that the Playboy Industry has over costume production. My hat is off to those
students who agonized this year over
their homemade costumes. Top efforts
include the cutting-up and sewing-backtogether of two leotards to make a court
jester costume, the writing of math equations all over purple balloons that were
strung together to create "The Grapes of
Math" and one student's effort to look so
unmistakably like an NBA player coming
out of retirement circa 1982, that until I
touched his brawny torso
which I
thought was an authentic Hawks' jersey
I could not tell he was actually wearing
a wifebeeter etched meticulously with
Crayola. As a bonus, this man's fully
exposed thighs, barely covered by his florescent yellow 'Bos-style basketball shorts
(or they could have been women's cheerleading shorts), created a look so emascu-

lating as to masculate him far beyond any
Batman, Superman or "Shirtless Guy"
strutting his stuff around Sharpies.
But as I mentioned, not every
Swarthmore student follows the sexual
trend that dominates Halloween costumes. Aside from "The Grapes of Math,"
puns impregnated Sharpies last week;
Poking fun at the sexualization of
Halloween, one student attached a giant
safety pin to her shirt, from which she
drew an arrow pointing straight upward.
So instead of dressing like one, she literally went as a "Pinup Girl."
But for every creative costume that
hits the dance floor, an equally bootilicious outfit does it one better. For clarity
purposes, I'd like to state now that I have
no personal problem with this, and if I
could attend Halloween naked, I would, if
only doing so would not defeat the concept of costume-wearing. So if we estimate
that half of the women who attended last
week's bash are like me and enjoy objectifying themselves for some reason or
another, then I have to ask myself just
this: why?

Bethanne Albert-Bruninga 'lO offers us
one explanation, an explanation that
sounds a bit like the way I rationalize the
scandalous outfits in which I sometimes
dress myself, the way in which I shut out
those second thoughts that tell me,
"Amber, it might not be a good day to
have your ass cheeks hanging out."

November 6, 2008

"Looking extremely sexy is a type of
high; it makes you feel good about yourself,

superior

and desirable," Albert-

Bruninga said. While I'm well aware that
this type of superiority is purely superficial, I cannot deny that lust is a legitimate
urge. So if adults lust after one another,
and in daily life do little to profess their
attraction (which tends to be the case at
Swarthmore), what better time than
Halloween to act on this urge?
As sophomore Katherine Stockbower

maintains, Halloween is a time when peoof character.
"They wear what they would not normally wear. It's an excuse to break the
rules, or at least that's what people
think," Stockbower said.
For Albert-Bruninga, breaking the
rules is actually a role-reversal: "The
word I like to use is empowerment.
Because we live in such a male-oriented
society where a girl has to wait for a guy
to ask her out, I love being able to take the
first step towards an interaction, where I
can implicitly say, 'Look at me! Notice
me!' Guys are checking me out and I can
decide whether or not I want to give them
the time of day. You just feel so confident
ple act out

and strong."

Lucky for your gag-reflex, the destruction of innocence caps off around the college years, and so I end my report without
having to cover the trends of the elderly
and their Halloween misbehaviors.

A tale of two elections: Israeli politics matters, too
Israeli voters face four months of uncertainty as they wait to elect a new prime minister in February
The curtains around voting booths have
blinded Americans to more than just the
ballots of their neighbors. In the face of a
historic American presidential election, it
has become easy to lose sight of the fact that
events in the rest of the world do not suddenly come to a halt merely because we
make our way to the polls.
Threats from Tutsi rebel leader Laurent
Nkunda in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo to lead militants in a march across
the country leaving violence and destruction in their wake have scarcely warranted
mention in the American press. News of
two bombings in Iraq on Tuesday, killing 16
and wounding over 40, was pushed far
below the fold ofThe New York Times. And
in Israel, the Knesset, the state's governing
body, seems poised to disintegrate, leaving
a lame-duck government until a general
election in February. This warrants a closer

that, together, are able to govern the country.
The problem facing Tzipi Livni, the current head of Kadima, the largest party in
the Knesset, is that she has been unable to

look.
For

Bank. Kadima's opponents, and the Likud
party in particular, take much more hawkish positions, refusing to budge on the question of Jerusalem and insisting on maintaining control over parts of the West Bank.
Nevertheless, any sort of referendum on

all the discussion during the
American presidential campaigns about
candidates' "Israel policies," it seems that
both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain had forgotten that Israel is an active and complex
democracy, not a marionette to be played by
American politicians. American foreign aid
buys this country a voice in some of Israel's
affairs, but by no means does it guarantee
the United States veto power over Israel's
actions. Accordingly, if Americans want a
complete perspective on the future of the
reason, there is cause to pay a great deal of
attention to its present political dilemmas
and future electoral prospects.
At the core of the present issues in
Israeli politics is its multiparty parliamentary system. Whereas Americans directly
elected Barack Obama, Israeli voters don't
specifically select the leader of their government. Instead, voters choose parties,
who are then allocated seats in the Knesset
proportional to the number of votes they
receive. The leader of the government, the
prime minister, is simply the head of the
party that receives the greatest number of
votes. Among the duties of the prime minister is the formation of a coalition of parties

form such a coalition. The reasons for this
difficulty are myriad. First, Ms. Livni has
run afoul of Shas, the Sephardic-Orthodox
party, who demanded that, among other
things, she refuse to negotiate with
Palestinians over the issue of Jerusalem.
Without their support, forming a viable
coalition became extremely difficult.
But second, and more importantly, Ms.
Livni's coalition difficulties represent a
broader divide in Israeli politics over how
to proceed with negotiating peace agreements with the Palestinians and Syrians.
Kadima as a party supports a two-state solution, obtained through Israeli withdrawals
from contested territory, such as the West

these issues seems unlikely in the near
future. Israeli voters will have to wait until
February to cast their ballots either for
Livni, Benjamin Netanyahu (a former
prime minister and the leader of Likud), or
Ehud Barak (another former prime minister and head of the Labor party). In the
meantime, Israelis are left with a lame-duck
government, unable to effectively negotiate
or pursue policy changes.
And this is where President-Elect
Obama enters the fray. During this time of
relative political instability in Israel, the
American government should not put
undue pressure on it to take radical actions
in the name of peace. The dismantlement of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
already in a precarious position, will have
to remain on the back-burner. And large-

scale peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians, even with the mediation of an
eager American regime, ought to be put on
hold for the moment a placeholder Israeli

government is in no position to make promises of change, even in the most general
sense.
Instead, Mr. Obama should use this
opportunity to look at the other side of the
peace equation: the Palestinian government. The Palestinian National Authority
has been perennially hamstrung by the
divisive Hamas, a radical party which
presently controls the West Bank and to
which many Palestinians remain loyal.
Without a united Palestinian front, any
peace process an Obama administration
may undertake is doomed to the same failures President Bush encountered in his
contrived 2007 summit in Annapolis
specifically, despite the best intentions of
the Palestinian and Israeli people and gov-

ernments, squabbling between the PNA and
Hamas serves to derail any substantive
attempts at negotiation. This infighting,
rather than any malicious intent on the
part of the Palestinians, represents one significant blockade along the path to peace.

While the fragility of the Palestinian
regime precludes putting an excessive
amount of pressure on it for reform, Mr.
Obama should stress the need for reconcili-

sam

ation efforts between the PNA and Hamas.
If autonomous unification seems unlikely,
American aid should be put on the line.
While Palestinian politicians have cried
foul at the suggestion, claiming the humanitarian implications of decreased aid could
be devastating, the intransigence of some of
their lot (the cataclysmic Hamas, which has
yet to formally denounce terrorism as one
of its methods, comes to mind) has left
America with few options. Hamas' grip
over some Palestinian hearts and minds
will indubitably become less firm if they
are seen as the dam holding back American
aid dollars.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been
a thorn in the side of American politicians
for decades, to the point where President
Bush appears to have lost interest in the
matter. But as he prepares to assume office,
Mr. Obama needs to make a clear commitment to achieving substantive progress in
the region. There are, undoubtedly, great
foreign and domestic problems he will have
to address during his time in office
but
they cannot come at the cost of once more
allowing the Middle East peace process to
falter.

I find myself in the position of an
opinions columnist on deadline, on the

week of the election, which for those in
the know, means that what you are
reading right now was written before
the results of the election were known.
That also assumes, though, that the
results of the election were able to be
known by this wonderful Thursday
morning and that the result was decisive enough that all of us know who the
victor was.
Whatever the result of November 4,
2008, many serious questions remain,
the most important being
What now?
After all, both parties' candidates have
spent the past twenty months campaigning on constantly evolving platforms, shaking untold numbers of
unwashed hands, kissing scores of newborns, and giving speech after speech to
anyone who would listen.
And over those past twenty months
they also made countless promises in
their sales pitches to the nation and its
legions of eligible voters. Thus, two

And though the next step has been

really as clear now that the people have

that yes, it is clear.
I want to believe that the candidate
elected will make good on the promises
that he made to us during his campaigns, but my political instincts tell
me to believe otherwise.
In our democracy, once the ticket has
been elected, the Executive Branch may
maintain whatever level of commitment
to the popular electorate that it so
chooses. The Executive Branch is only

achieving its goals. But political sensibility is next to impossible for we, the
electorate, to assess, as we do not have

all of the information that our leaders
have available to them. As a result,
there isn't much that we can expect
from those elected.
We can still hope that they make
good on some of the promises that they
made to us, and hope that they don't
make good on other less appealing
promises they made to us. However,
hope will only get us so far, and as
always we will continue to have to
make our voices heard to all of our
elected officials to help influence their
decisions and bring about favorable
outcomes for us and the nation as a
whole.

There isn't much that
we can expect from
those elected.
For the presidential ticket to, for
some unknown reason, interpret the
popular show of support for them to be
indicative of a commitment to stand for
the nation at large, that would be something! Such would be historically
improbable for the victor to actually do,
given the dearth of examples of politicians making good on their campaign
commitments.
Even so, the American electorate
ought to demand the actions that it has
been promised, by whichever candidate
was popularly elected. And the other
half of the electorate not pleased with
the result ought to make every effort to
make sure that the majority does not
trample on the rights of the minority in
the process of realizing those campaign
commitments.
Regardless of who the victor was, we
would be wise to continue to expect the
following: Death, not limited to individuals, but rather death in all of its forms;
taxes, which may or may not be
increased depending on who won;
stolen artifacts from the White House
by the current administration; DC corruption and the greasing of the K Street
lobbying wheel before the changeover;
and midnight hour pardons by the current administration.
To friends who are not happy with
the way the election turned out, you are
entitled to a period of mourning of
course, but soon thereafter you would
be well-advised to move on. It's only 28
months until the start of the next presidential campaign cycle, and 2012 certainly has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

our courts and institutions leave no room
for hoping that things will ever improve.
How this distancing will yield a just, socially responsible, and democratic state is a
question that members of the opposition
think the Chavez administration cannot
adequately answer.
What makes things significantly worse
is that there is currently no viable political
alternative to Chavez's revolution. In my
opinion, this is the case not because the segment of the population that wants "change"
in Venezuela is a political minority (which
is debatable), nor because there is no single
political figure strong enough to stand up to
Chavez (which may be true). The very root
of the issue at hand is that the democratic
system in Venezuela is far from being functional, let alone transparent or just. The
omnipotence of the Chavez administration
in electoral matters and otherwise has led
to disbelief with regard to voting urns as a

Republicans were angry too when they

And yet, despite the inflamed electorate and the stressful circumstances,
neither campaign delivered a brutal,

have been raw.
But there appears to have been a disconnect between the generally calm,
respectful tone of the candidates and the
teeming mass of electors who in polls said
they were increasingly "scared" of what

the other candidate would do.
Surely, liberals have something to fear
besides fear itself. Everyone has seen the
effects of George W. Bush's "compassionate" neo-conservatism, and a reasonable
person could be scared by the prospect of
four more years like the last eight.
Conservatives, too, have their reasons
to be wary of an Obama presidency. They
recognize the failure of the last eight
years and are afraid that the pendulum

will swing too far to the left. It is possible
they are angrier with Bush than liberals
are
they expected better
and now his
failures could result in a long-term shift
toward liberal economic and social poli-

cies.
But beyond the many grievances that
inevitably affect a political base, a pervasive cultural attitude has also allowed the
political poles to increasingly fear the other
side. The dichotomous labeling of blue and
red has created the false notion that conservatives and liberals have entirely different goals, when in reality they mainly disagree over how to arrive at the same spot.
Given the close quarters in which they
must work, most politicians understand
better than voters the common ground
between the left and right. (Governor Palin
is the exception there.) Throughout the
campaign, Obama has recognized the
shared goals that shine through the ideological differences like reducing unwanted pregnancies and promoting affordable
education
and he has used them to
ensure that his campaign does not become
too divisive.
McCain, for his part, deserves credit
just for keeping the Rovians from entirely
dishonoring his campaign and himself. A
few guilt-by-association attacks are pretty
mild compared to what could have spewed
forth.
So some praise is due to Senators
Obama, McCain and Biden. Maybe next
time we could all follow their examples a
little more.

Examining liberal-conservative relationships in film

another woman. When plucky Amanda decides to take
up the defense, things start to go awry.
She argues that a woman has a right to defend her
home, especially in light of the fact that Doris has children to feed. But Adam believes that the law is the law.
The fundamental issue here is Adam's inability to conceive of the ways in which men are privileged in society.
So, even if men and women are technically "equal under
the law," how is that standard being arbitrated?
During one scene, it becomes perilously obvious what
is at stake for Amanda, when she interviews one of the
jurors, asking him, "Do you believe in equal rights for
women?" and he replies with a staunch, "I should say
not!" (It still shocks me every time I see it.) But work is
quickly mixed with pleasure as Amanda sits back down
on the bench next to her defendant. She looks across the
aisle at Adam, who slyly drops a pencil beneath his desk.
She quickly follows suit and the two exchange a flirtatious glance or two surreptitiously under the table before,
work is quickly resumed once more and Adam must

with impunity. But as the film progresses, things just
aren't that simple.
At one of the wackiest points during the film, Amanda
decides to bring in a gaggle of women: doctors, chemists,
construction workers, even a circus performer as witnesses in court. Her aim is to prove that women are just
as capable as men and therefore deserve equal treatment
under the law.
The scene ends when the circus performer lifts Adam,
against his will, high into the air. Obviously, such a gag
is a source of comedy and, as Adam claims, these women
really have nothing to do with the case, but there is
something evocative about Amanda's proclamation that
"not only one woman is on trial here, but all women."
Should women be forced to acquiesce to the laws of a
society that doesn't have their best interest in mind? For
that matter, should women have to follow the law when
men regularly break it without care?

Navigating political differences with a spouse can be
more dangerous, as proven by the scene in which Adam
gives Amanda a massage. Amanda begins singing the
song that the Bonners' overeager next-door neighbor,
Kip Lurie (David Wayne), wrote for her. Adam is overcome with anger: not only does his wife emasculate him
by kicking his ass in court, but also other men (gasp!)
find her attractive! He gives her an abrupt SLAP! on the
ass, after which Amanda breaks down into tears, complaining of "typical, instinctive, masculine brutality."
"And it felt not only as if you meant it but as though you
felt you had a right to!" she shrieks. Of course Amanda's
response to this situation is quickly gendered and trivialized. "Guaranteed heart melter, female tears!!!" Adam
exclaims. But Amanda throws the game right back at
him, kicking him in the shins with a shrill, "LET'S ALL
BE MANLY!!!!" In what seems to be a purely personal
domestic exchange, gender roles are used like weapons.
Every action taken is seen as a symptom of gendered
socialization. According to Adam, women only use tears
to get what they want and for Amanda men are all brutes
who would love nothing more than to abuse their wives

Out of my whole miserable high school career, one
day stands out. I was in my 10th grade English class and
we were talking about how attraction is formulated. Not
surprisingly, most people in the class felt that people
were more likely to be attracted to those who share their
political beliefs.
Ever since then I've marveled at the spectacle of actual liberal-conservative couples. "How do they do it?" I
asked myself.
Well, George Cukor's wonderfully orchestrated classic "Adam's Rib" (1949, USA) answers that question
resoundingly: "With great difficulty!" Revolving around
a pair of married lawyers, Adam (Spencer Tracy) and
Amanda Bonner (Katharine Hepburn), the film explores
the tensions that arise when the personal meets the political.
Mildly conservative Adam decides to take up the prosecution in a case involving a nervous housewife, Doris
Attinger (played by a brilliant Judy Holiday), who is
arrested for shooting her unfaithful husband Warren
Attinger (Tom Ewell), after catching him in the arms of

ironically, a few tears.
It is only when the roles are reversed that theBonners

after, which offers a little hope that we can all learn to

Chase's depression column sparks debate
Fletcher Wortmann characterizes article as thoughtless'

Linking mind and body

Chase seems concerned that, as psychiatric medicine
becomes more widely practiced, poor diagnoses are being
made and people are using drugs to escape from their problems instead of facing them. This isn'tunreasonable. Hell,
I'd be surprised if it didn't happen frequently. But consider all of those suffering with undiagnosed mental illness;
the tremendous financial, emotional and psychological
burdens placed on the mentally ill and their families; the
cruel social stigma that discriminates against survivors.
As a society, we have a lot of work to do on the perception
and treatment of mental disorders before we start worrying about over-diagnosis. How is it possible for us to have
gone too far, when we haven't even come close to doing

To the Editor:
C.A. Chase's column "The problematic placebo," published on Oct. 30, presents a grossly misleading depiction of clinical depression. Chase's
argument seems to be that because some people
with depression respond to placebos, it must
mean that depression is all in our minds and that

To the Editor:
As some of you may be aware, last week marked the
observance of Speak to Swatties' first "We're All Mad
Here" mental health awareness week, and the apparently

coincidental publication of C.A. Chase's "The Problematic
Placebo" article. It is moments like these that my withered, blackened heart is opened to the possibility of the
existence of an interventionist god. Presumably one with
a bastard sense of humor. As an associate of Speak to
Swatties, I had a number of problems with Chase's column,
which in classic Swarthmore fashion I shall now comprehensively and humorlessly elucidate.
First off, Chase significantly misrepresents the October
23rd New York Times article "Half of Doctors Routinely
Prescribe Placebos." The statement that the "effect [is] on
patients' psyches, not their bodies," for example, specifically refers to placebo pain medications and not to psychiatric drugs as Chase implies. Although the article does
mention that placebos may effectively treat depression in
"controlled clinical trials," it remains frustratingly vague,
and fails to mention any other (potentially significant)
forms of treatment offered to the subjects.
More so than its inaccuracies, however, I was troubled
by the article's trivialization of mental illness. Chase
begins by referring to psychiatric treatment as "self-medication," (apparently "self-medication" actually refers to
"physician-prescribed medication") and proceeds to equate
psychopharmaceutical treatment with college binge drinking and huffing Windex. Although I generally enjoy
Chase's music references, her suggestion that the "awful
female yowling or pseudo-rock grimaces that populate the
airwaves" may in some way correlate to modern mental illness seems slightly unfair; I'm not wildly enthusiastic
about Katy Perry or Nickelback, but even at my most indieelitist their music does not inspire in me soul-crushing
existential despair. Chase accuses psychiatry of enabling
a "bland sugarized version of depression," a "watereddown version of the teenage angst," an "adolescent emo-ish
attempt at control." "[W]e aren't really depressed," she
claims, "we're just so boring we can't realize that we're
bored with ourselves." Such language betrays at best a
careless and deeply flawed understanding of mental illness, and at worst outright contempt for the mentally ill.
Troublingly, Chase also equates mental illness with creativity and individuality.
She praises the "creative
despair" and "authenticity",
that offer the tortured but
poetic soul the chance of "actually saying something real
about the world". This is a common misconception, but a
dangerous one.
"[G]lamorizing depression", as Chase
freely admits that she does, is at best condescending, and
at worst callous and misanthropic. Depression is not the
result of "relentless analysis" but of maladaptive cognitive
mechanisms. It is not "reading into things" and it offers
no "creative or analytical benefits." Depression makes
people suffer meaninglessly for long periods of time, and
then it very oftenkills them. The human creative impulse
is completely unrelated to "the sort of unhappiness that
can be cured by sedatives," and to claim otherwise is to
belittle those who manage to express themselves through
such overwhelming pain. Insanity does not enable art, but
only hinders its expression. To claim that the genius of a
troubled artist such as (to use two pertinent examples)
David Foster Wallace or Heath Ledger is born not of talent
and effort, but of a debilitating psychological condition, is
to demean their achievements.
The most perplexing thing about Chase's piece is her
depiction of life on medication, one she groundlessly
assumes is "teeth-gnashingly mundane...The weather outside is neither bright nor stormy; instead it's dull and drizzly and everyday." Taken out of context this quote serves
as a beautiful encapsulation of life with clinical depression, at least as I understand it. Everything is poisoned,
everything is corrupted; the mind pathologically seeks its
own misery. Every day, as it were, is like Sunday.
"Constant picking at the world and at yourself is a distor"

tion," Chase claims, "but within that distortion is a mech-

anism for seeing things as they are that healthy people
have learned to put aside in their personal lives in order to
function." Since when are functionality and mental health
things to be ashamed of? Since when is meaningless,
ceaseless, unproductive suffering a virtue?

THE PHOENIX

enough?
I don't necessarily blame Chase for her arguments, as I
think such misconceptions are (distressingly) quite common. The tone of the article strikes me as thoughtless
rather than genuinely malevolent. Yet the fact that depression and psychiatric treatment were deemed acceptable
subjects for such an inadequately researched and poorly
constructed argument suggests that neither Chase nor the
Phoenix editorial truly understand the severity of this
issue. I urge Chase or anyone on this campus who harbors
such views on mental health to please re-evaluate them,
and consider a more nuanced and compassionate perspective. If Chase is willing, I'd like to talk to her about her
article and her opinions on mental health; generally, however, I believe that Swarthmore students would be better
served by contacting a Speak to Swatties counselor, as I am
a horrible person and I enthusiastically embrace many of
the misanthropic, life-denying philosophies that Chase's
article inadvertently espouses.
A final note to Phoenix editorial:This is the second time
in two years that the paper has published a misinformed,
inflammatory article about mental health. I believe that in
engaging such a delicate subject, one assumes the responsibility to put forth a consistent, respectful, and carefully
researched argument, and while I admire the Phoenix's
opposition to censorship, it is inexcusable that such articles are not subjected to a more rigorous editorial process.
That Chase's article was deemed publishable in its current
state, factual errors and all, is not a testament to freedom
of speech but to lazy editing and production. There is no
doubt in my mind that if a columnist submitted a similar
article that suggested that homosexuality could be 'cured,'
or that argued in favor of racial eugenics, the Phoenix
would at the very least demand exhaustive editorial revision.
Chase's column offers a similarly confused understanding of biological and psychological issues; the only difference is that her arguments are directed at a less visible
minority. The fact that mental illness is considered an
appropriate topic for such cavalier writing speaks poorly
not only of the author and the Phoenix, but of our supposedly enlightened campus as a whole.
Fletcher Wortmann 'O9

we're just bored with ourselves.
She neglects to realize that lots of illnesses,
physical and mental, can be treated successfully
with placebos, suggesting a connection between
mind and body about which we still know very little. If placebos treat depression effectively, it only
means that people's minds are stronger than we
think. Furthermore, Chase's column serves to
belittle a very serious issue. By comparing clinical depression, a severe and debilitating mental
health issue, with ordinary teenage angst, Chase
reveals how little she understands depression and
the experiences and struggles it causes. It's far
beyond run of the mill angst and boredom. Those
with clinical depression deserve compassionate
treatment, be it therapy or medicine, and deserve
to have their concerns listened to and taken seriously, not belittled like they are in Chase's col-

umn.

Joel Swanson 'lO

Chase's tone dismissive
To the Editor:
Speaking on behalf of the Speak 2 Swatties peer

counseling program, Charlotte Chase's recent
article is an insensitive treatment of the delicate
subject of depression. Depression is not, as she
implies, just "teenage angst," but a serious biological difficulty with which a number of people,
including many Swatties, struggle. For many,
medication is crucial to their ability to lead a normal life. We are disturbed to see such complex
struggles dismissed in such a cavalier fashion in
the Swarthmore community. This article is a testament to the flippant and ignorant way that many
people still approach mental illness. The witty but
haphazard style suggests carelessness in her
approach towards this sensitive issue.
We believe that these issues are important, and
we know that we also have a lot to learn about
them. We hope that Chase's article will be
an impetus to discussion on the complex nature of
the phenomena of mental illness, rather than an
unattendedand careless barb attacking the reality
of many genuine personal experiences.

Phillies fanaticism warranted after stunning victory
good deal of star power, but there were some
noticeable holes as well. A weak back end of
the rotation and a few dead spots in the lineup looked like they might doom the Phillies
campaign. So like every other year since
2001, the Phillies entered the final few weeks
of the season with a real-but-not-great possibility of making the playoffs and contending.

From 2001 through 2006, this same situation would always unfold and the Phillies
would always fall short a few games away
from the much dreamt-of playoff spot. Last
year, they pulled it offand won the National
League East on the last day of the season but
were eliminated from the playoffs without
winning a game. Up through midSeptember, 2008 was shaping up according
to plan: close enough to dream, but it just
looked like they would not have the firepower to make it happen.
Then, on September 11th, a funny thing
happened: the Phillies stopped losing. They
closed out the regular season with 13 wins
in 16 games, easily overcoming sizeable
deficits in the standings, and then cruised to
the World Series title with 11 wins in 14

Called Third
As a Phillies fan, I am having trouble
understanding what just happened last

month. I think I watched them breeze
through the playoffs to capture their first
World Series in my lifetime, but nothing in
my years of avidly following the team and
the league suggests that that should have or
could have just happened.
For five and half months, the 2008 season
resembled all the other 2000-era Phillies seasons. The Phillies were a good team with a

playoff games.
Err, I think that's what I saw.
In no venue other than sports can something like this happen. Where else can a formula that has so often led to disappointment
spit out a beautiful outcome every once in a

while? I was four years old the last time the
Phillies played in a World Series. Since
then, I've been waiting for their next opportunity, watching thousands of games hoping
it could somehow happen. And every season
for the past eight, that lovely prize would
seem possible, and it would approach quickly as September rolled around. Then suddenly it would disappear amidst a fourgame losing streak or some other meltdown.
The Phillies marched us down that same
path this season, and though it is my nature
as a baseball fan to hope, as a Phillies fan, I
could recognize all the signs of another near
miss. I waited with a pit in my stomach for
the other shoe to drop and for the World
Series's quick approach to suddenly halt.
But it never did, and this season, which
looked to be another source of heartbreak,
became something completely different
over the course of five weeks. The season
transformed from a pit in my stomach to the
very thing I had been dreaming of for a lifetime.
In the wake of the World Series championship, we tell ourselves that we saw it coming
that we saw the difference in this
team. "Well, with Brad Lidge anchoring the
bullpen, this team really was built to win."
"They had never had an ace like Cole
Hamels this decade, so they were finally
able to get over the hump this time." But we
didn't. In each year this decade, we've said
-

that that year's club had the new element
that would lead it to the promised land. The
simple, if bizarre, truth is that this Phillies
team was probably not that much better
than the ones that broke our hearts time
and again for the past seven years. They
won only three more regular season games
than in 2007 and had a markedly inferior
offense. Though the pitching was certainly
much improved, the 2008 version of the
team just did not look like it would break
the trend and push deep into October.
But then it did. And that's what makes
us love sports. In early March, we watch
Duke play Acorn State because we want to
see a #l6 seed stun a #1 in March Madness.
It's not going to happen. But then again, it

could, so we watch. When our team trails by
four runs in the 9th inning, we watch, praying for the lineup to erupt and come back.
It's not going to happen except for the rare
time it does, and you certainly don't want to
miss that one. So as a sports fan, you root
for the #l6, you hope for that 9th-inning
comeback, and you pray for that World
Series run. Amid all the crushing iterations
that betray your faith, that magical one is
lurking. And when it arrives, it is beautiful,
and all the heartbreaks of yesterday are
instantly worth it. As of October 29, 2008,1
can tell you that with complete confidence.

Two fierce fights end in tough losses for field hockey
BY DANNY FRIEL
dfriell@swarthmore.edu

Despite two valiant efforts, the Swarthmore field hockey team dropped two conference matches in its last two
games of the season, losing at home to Haverford on
Wednesday by a score of 4-3, and falling to Franklin and
Marshall in an away game on Saturday by a score of 4-2.
Even after holding onto a 1-0 lead early in the second
half on Wednesday, the Garnet was unable to come out on
top of a scoring frenzy in the final half hour of the game.
Within three minutes of Joslyn Young 'lo's initial goal,

each team added another tally. Haverford bounced back to
tie the game at 14, only to have Sarah Reynolds 'O9 retake
the lead for Swarthmore at 2-L
After a pair of consecutive Haverford goals to bring the
score to 3-2 in favor of the Fords, Hadley Roach 11 tied up
the match again at three apiece in the 61st minute, but it
was not enough as Haverford first-year Roxanne Jaffe
scored what would turn out to be the game-winner three
minutes later. The Fords broke even on the season with
the win, finishing at 9-9 (5-5 CC). Goalkeeper Gina Grubb
'lO notched 17 saves in the loss for the Garnet.
Against Franklin and Marshall in the season finale on
Saturday, the Garnet was unable to overcome a 2-1 deficit
at halftime despite out-shooting the F&M in the second
half. Natalie Stone 'O9 tied the game at 1-1 in the 16th
minute after connecting on a pass from Devon Novotnak
'll The tally, her 9th, makes Stone Swarthmore's leading
scorer on the season. Young has the second most goals on
the team, with 7 marks to her credit.
Co-captain Ashley Gunter 'O9, who was given AllCentennial Conference second-team honors this year,
added a goal offof a penalty stroke in the middle of the second half, but it was not enough as the Diplomats scored
twice in the second half to clinch the victory. F&M ends
the season at 6-11 (3-7 CC).
Grubb tallied 5 saves in goal against the Diplomats,
bringing her total to 113 saves this season. Katie Ashmore
'll finishes the season with 48 saves.
After a series of tough losses, the Garnet finishes the
season with a record of 5-13, standing at 1-9 in Centennial
Conference play. Yet despite the statistics, the season is
not completely devoid of positive memories for the women.
Jordan Schmidt 'O9 looks back on her time on the team
with fondness. "The thing I will miss most is the closeness
of the team, especially the five seniors. Our class has an
awesome relationship, and I couldn't have imagined being
on the team without them," she said. "I don't think we'll
ever lose touch with each other."

Running: terrifying but necessary

KEVIN FRIEDENBERG
Get Down With
Your Bad Self
If you recall my previous column you will
remember that I wrote about something that I
love: bowling. Subsequently I feel like it is
only fair that this week I write about something I hate terribly: running. There cannot
possibly be any activity as horrible and
painful as running. I would classify myself as
a reluctant runner, one who runs only out of
absolute necessity. There are so many aspects
of running that are unappealing, yet probably
its most vile feature is its centrality to so
many

sports,

including

my

much-loved

lacrosse. But surely there are some redeeming

qualities to running, right?
Running is probably the most basic and
simplest exercise known to the human race;
after all, it is a survival mechanism (when
was thelast time you saw an overweight caveman?). That being said, however, for those of
you out there who are like me, running is a
terrifying and scarring experience (perhaps
the survival aspect is actually surviving the
run I am on). Running has made my feet hurt,

my knees hurt, my shins hurt, my back hurt,
my chest hurt, and unfortunately sometimes
all of those simultaneously. I have heard people say that once you get into running and the

endorphins kick in, running can be fun and
addicting. In my experience these 'endorphins" have been mysteriously and painfully
absent. Over the years I have flirted briefly
with running, some experiments more successful than others. As much as I may curse it,
running is something many of us cannot
avoid. Not only is running critical to nearly

best way to keep the human body in good
physical shape. I apologize in advance, but
you track and cross-country types are out of
your minds. Running is the worst part of
every sport, yet you choose to do it as your
only sport. Needless to say I could never participate because my capacity for running is

I simply must run to keep from being beaten
to a pulp (a necessary skill since I like having
intact bones).
On my most recent foray into the dark
world of running, I did notice one thing I did
like about it: the camaraderie. Anytime I am
out pounding the pavement and I pass another runner, jogger, biker, walker, etc. that person always seems to give me a smile or a
thumbs-up. Maybe it's just because they see a
disheveled kid stumbling at them with a
crazed look on his face like he was just forced
to watch "Garden State." It's impossible not to
feel that connection to other human beings
tormenting themselves through physical exercise. Additionally, I like to think that with

every car that passes me there is a driver say-

ing, "Wow, maybe I should get back into running," and I feel like my suffering has maybe
changed a person's life. More likely, however,
it is just a traumatic overload of pain in my
mind causing me to have these thoughts. The
fact that these total strangers seem to share a
fleeting bond with me through exercise
always helps to add a little fuel to the tank.
I recall watching my sister run the Boston

Marathon a few years ago, and the energy
between both the athletes competing and the
onlookers was electric. People are always
cheering on random runners, not just those
that they came to see. After experiencing a
marathon first hand, I have decided that one
of my life goals is to run the Boston Marathon.
For me that would represent the ultimate
achievement over the physical capabilities of
my mind and body since running has always
proved to be my top athletic adversary. Yet I
am not alone in this quest. Many of my friends
have confided in me their wish to also run a
marathon at some point in their lives. As you
can probably guess, running the aforementioned marathon is probably not in the cards
for me right away. It will most likely take several months (sigh) of training to even be prepared. Damn, why can't running be as fun as
bowling?

Haverford by one point, meaning that
if one of the top five runners finished
one place further or one of Haverford's

the Garnet would have tied for third.
On the women's side, Melissa Frick 'l2
finished eighth with a personal-best
time of 23:0317, leading the women's
team to a seventh place finish in a nine
team-field. Nyika Corbett 'lO ran a season-best time of 23:32.66 to register a

finished the race with times of 23:50.46

'll and Hannah Rose 'l2 crossed the
line at 24:06.44 and 24:15.72 to register
28th and 30th places.
"It felt like we were out in the middle of a battleground
it was
Gettysburg," Frick said. "The Battle of
Gettysburg caused some of the worst
casualties in the Civil War, but acted as
a turning point for the Union. The
ladies suffered some casualties on the
way, but I think this meet has given us
plenty of motivation to do some significant damage at Regionals."
Johns Hopkins women's team won
the championship with a score of 49,
toppling Dickinson and Haverford who
had scores of 83 and 92. The Johns
Hopkins women's team captured their
first-ever Centennial Conference title,
beating out eight-time defending champion Dickinson.
"We really showed our depth and
ran as a team this weekend. Cross
country is not an individual sport, and
when the going gets tough in the middle of the race, it's great to be able to

look in front of you and see another
Swattie just ahead. No matter where in
the race you are, you know there are
teammates nearby who are pushing
you to run harder and helping you get
through the race," Rose said.
On the men's side, captain Erik
Saka 'O9 finished the race with a personal season-best time of 26:53.85 to
earn a 24th place. Co-captain Dan
Hodson 'O9 came in 44th place, clocking
in at 27:44.82. Patrick Harnett 'll, David
Riccardi 'lO and Chris Mayer Bacon 'll
covered the course with times of
28:07.51, 30:12.68 and 30:47.40, rounding
out the team scoring. Overall, the
men's team finished with a score of 212,
and registered Bth place.
"As to how well our team performed, it could best probably be
described by the phrase from the
Roman poet Horace, 'Dulce et decorum
est pro patria mori.' Although no one
expired for our valiant cause, many
suffered extreme travails and in so
doing reached the heights of Roman
glory," Saka said. "If only we had been
in a different age, Roman legions
would have marched and hailed the
greater glories that were displayed on
the field of running this past
Saturday."
Unseasonably warm weather and
the flat course were said to affect both
teams' performance. "I think some

girls really had an advantage because
of that but on the other hand, some
women were negatively impacted by
the heat. I didn't really like the end of
the course, because it was really just
running around this enormous field,"
Woo said. "It kept on dipping in
towards the finish line, and then moving out again, so I was never really
sure how far away from the finish I
actually was. It was a little bit frustrating, especially because in the last 2000
meters of the race, you're really just
fighting not to give out." "The conditions were less than optimal for some
people but our months of tough training in all types ofconditions paid off on
Saturday," Stanley said.
The cross country teams will return
to action on Saturday, November 15th

Volleyball racks up record-breaking kills despite narrow loss to F&M
BY DENNIS FAN

dfanl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore's women's volleyball team ended their season this past weekend in a flurry of shattered records and
accomplished milestones. In the last game of a long season
that began in August, the team fought with passion through
five sets against Centennial Conference rival Franklin
Marshall CoUege, 25-16,15-25, 20-25, 25-16,15-12, losing in the
fifth by a mere three points.
The outstanding performance of the Garnet women
against the Diplomats prompts us to recall the past season
and gives us glimpses at the future of Swarthmore Women's
&

Volleyball.
In her last game, captain Jen Wang 'O9 led the team on
offense and on defense, amassing 22 kills and 28 digs. Wang
wouldfinish her last game playing as dominantly as she had
all season, earning her school records for season kills (360)
and career kills (U7l). Furthermore, Wang ranked impressively nationally, entering her last week with 3.74 kills per
set, 35th in Division m Volleyball.
Captain Erin Heaney 'O9 would also end the season on a
high note, solidifying her place in school and conference history with a school record 1,560 career digs, or 14th in
Centennial Conference history.
Though the team will sorely miss its two seniors, the
team looks to be equally strong going into next season.

THE PHOENIX

According to Kearney Bangs 10, who added 44 assists this
weekend, "The freshmen stepped it up this season." As a
result, "The team will be able to play the same," Bangs said.
The team's four first-year players, Genny Pezzola, Hillary
Santana, Lisa Shang and Sasha Wijeyeratne have all been
significant in shaping this team and their strong performances will likely continue in future seasons.
Pezzola has consistently supplied double-doubles (in kills
and digs) as well as a significant number of aces. In fact, this
season she leads the conference in aces with a total of 62.
Santana has become a more versatile volleyball player, playing a greater role on offense as the season has progressed,
while Shang has put up team highs in digs over various
matches. Wijeyeratne is constantly praised by coach
Harleigh Chwastyk for improving every practice and by
teammates for her motivating influence.

The formula for success this year has been a strong
defense, a smart offense, and a tough serve. Coach Chwastyk
states that, "by the end of the season we were digging harder balls and scrambling to make plays ... We played defense
well and were really smart offensively." This impressive
defense ended the season with a national ranking, 23rd in
Division HI by virtue of 18.95 digs per set.
The season was also successful because the team played
unselfishly and with great passion. Sarah Lambert 11 commented that, "As a team we really came together." Whether
it was preparing for Senior Day, dressing up for Halloween,
November 6, 2008

or just everyday practice, members of this year's women's
volleyball team have been dedicatedand have formed a community that has shown on and off the court. According to
Bangs, "[The women] did well working together as a team.
Our team played for each other and with each other."
The Garnet women certainly showed tremendous heart
and passion this season at a time when, as Chwastyk put it,
"We couldn't afford to play tentatively." Even in the last set
against Franklin & Marshall, the women battled back from
two five-point deficits before finally losing.
During the offseason, the women will hope to continue
practicing and continue to stay in shape. Furthermore, the
team often comes together to engage in charity work for the
community. The offseason is a chance for these volleyball
players and Swarthmore students to retool and refocus on
the grueling academic demands ofSwarthmore College.
Though the team finished 6-19 and 2-8 in Centennial
Conference play, these numbers do not nearly speak for the
number of personal, team, and career accomplishments of
Swarthmore's volleyball players.
"As a coach you always want to have a winning season,
but this year we've accomplished more team goals than
here. These women have shown dedication, determination,
and passion," Coach Harleigh Chwastyk said. Throughout
the season, the women's volleyball team never played halfheartedly, played neck-and-neck with the best of them and
never gave up.

Men's soccer trounces Haverford on home turf
BY ALYSSA BOWIE

abowiel@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's soccer team (142-1, 8-1 CC) defeated school-rival Haverford
on Saturday, a victory that marks the end
of the regular season for the Garnet. This
final win at home instilled in the team a
heightened energy, which will be important heading into upcoming conference
championships.
Throughout the entire game the crowd
was a contributing factor: 822 fans, mostly
of Swarthmore
students,
comprised
showed up to support the Garnet men, stirring up a degree of excitement which
seemed to permeate the field. "The crowd
was amazing," commented senior forward
Evan Nesterak, "It was one of if not the
best crowd we've had at Swat." This energy was especially evident in the first 10
minutes of the game, during which the
team appeared to be running on pure
adrenaline, driving shots and passes with
great force and urgency. When they began
to settle into a more composed style of play,
scoring opportunities became increasingly
frequent. The Garnet defense was extremely effective in using their speed and
strength to penetrate the attacking third of
the field and create chances for the for-

wards. Haverford, however, lacked this
seamless connection between the various
positions, and had trouble possessing the
ball outside of their defensive half.
In the first half, this tactical domination
on the part of the Garnet led to numerous
chances to score. Defender Jason Thrope
'O9 dominated the right side of the field out
of the back, and was able to both penetrate
the midfield and switch the field through
his explosive dribbling. The best chance of
the half came from forward Morgan
Langley 11, who was able to receive the
ball at the top of the penalty box, take on
and beat several players, and rocket off a
powerfully driven, low shot on goal. Going

into halftime scoreless did not accurately
reflect the offensive pressure placed upon
Haverford by the Garnet.
The first and only goal of the match
would come ten minutes into th 6 second
half. The Garnet drew a foul just inside
half-field, and captain Jeff Kushner 'O9
stepped up to take the kick. Kushner lofted
the ball towards the box, where it hung
until Nesterak made contact, heading the
ball past the Haverford goalkeeper, giving
Nesterak his Bth goal of the season.
Kushner noted that Nesterak is "really
starting to peak at just the righx time for
us, as we're poised for our playoff push this
weekend." Nesterak's offensive contribution for the Garnet this past weekend
should bode well for the post season.
Swarthmore carried this momentum
throughout the entire second half letting
Haverford into its attacking third (only in

the final minutes of the game. On the left
side of the field, midfielder Yoi
'o9,
dominatedhis mark, setting up the Garnet
offense on numerous occasions by driving
to the end line after catching his defender
flat-footed. Haverford was pressured in all
areas of the field, especially by the relentless Garnet defenders, all hungry for goals
of their own. Although the game was low
scoring, mentions Kushner, Swarthmore,
"being the better team, definitely controlled the game but just struggled putting
the ball in the back of the net." One needs
to only direct their attention towards the
shots on goal statistic (28-4 in
Swarthmore's favor) to understand the
dominance demonstrated by the Garnet.
Additionally, with the superb defense
exhibited by the Swarthmore men, including freshman goalie David D'Annunzio's
sixth shutout of the season, a high number
of goals was not necessary in capturing a
victory.
Upon completing the regular season, the
next step for the men is hosting the

field advantage," said Brett
McLarney 'l2. While focus has undoubtedly shifted towards post-season play, the
Garnet men still acknowledge the pride
that comes from beating Haverford. "Most

streak we hope continues for many years to

Despite scoreless games, women's soccer poised for future victory
BY JARED NOLAN

jnolanl@swarthmore.edu
In the final two matches of the regular season,
Swarthmore women's soccer (9-3-4, 5-1-4 CC) posted two
scoreless draws. The first 0-0 tie came against Haverford
(7-9-1, 4-4-1 CG) on the Garnet's Senior Night last
Wednesday. The one point from the draw was, however,
enough for the Garnet to clinch a spot in the Centennial
Conference tournament. This marks the third year in a
row that Swarthmore has made it to the playoffs. On this
past Saturday the Garnet registered its second consecutive
scoreless tie in a match against the Franklin & Marshall
Diplomats (8-4-3, 4-3-3 CC) to close out the regular season.
While no goals were scored in the match against
Haverford, the Garnet controlled the tempo early and had
numerous close chances. In the first half Swarthmore held
the shot advantage 7-2 over the Fords.
Forward Melinda Petre 'O9 missed an early shot over
the net and midfield Maggie DeLorme 'lO came even closer
when her kick rattled the crossbar and ricocheted downward, barely staying out of the goal. Later in the half the
Haverford fans anxiously gripped the cold benches of
Clothier Field when their goalkeeper completely whiffed
on a ball played back to her, but the Fords regained possession before any harm was done.
Swarthmore also started the second half promisingly,
getting an early opportunity off of a cross by Amy Vachal
1L Forward Kelsey Cline 'll connected with the ball, but
banged it harmlessly off the post. The team was not able
to find the net, even after both overtime periods. Cline was

not terribly distraught, explaining, "It happens. I would

rather fail to score here than fail in the playoffs." A low-

20

scoring match could have been predicted, because both
teams' keepers are in the top five for career shutouts in
Centennial Conference history. All that mattered was that
the team clinched a playoff berth on Senior Night with all
four seniors: keeper Lauren Walker, defenders Cait
Mullarkey and Alexa Bensimhon, and forward Melinda
Petre starting.
The match against Franklin Marshall had a similar
story line. The Garnet outshot the Diplomats 15-10 for the
game and had multiple goal-scoring chances.
The best scoring opportunity came in the 70th minute,
off of a corner by Petre. Forward Emily Coleman 'l2 positioned herself well and headed the ball, but it struck the
bottom of the crossbar and was cleared away. "The goalie
pushed me and the ref said it would have been a PK, but he
didn't call it," Coleman said.
She elaborated that the play was a testament to the
strength of the Centennial Conference and how every team
played hard to win. The Garnet had more chances, but
Coleman conceded that "luck just wasn't on our side that
game."
Swarthmore Head Coach Todd Anckaitis expressed con\
fidence that the team will return to its scoring ways, but
also noted the lack of goals is also due to the strong defense
in the Centennial Conference.
In relation to other comparable conferences, Anckaitis
observed that the Centennial Conference has significantly
more teams ranked in the top 50 in the country for Goals
&

\

a result in practice he is focusing on improving the offensive, "doing more
work this week on our set pieces and penalties, as those
can often determine a championship." Cline also noted
that the team has been using different combinations up

front. "We're still getting used to each other's play," she
said. This is partly due to the concussion forward Megan
Colombo 'll suffered during the Haverford game, but she
will be back on the field for the playoffs.
While the Garnet could not get lucky around the opponent's net, they did so in another way. "We finally caught
a break when Gettysburg and Muhlenberg tied and put us
in third," Cline said. The tie meant Muhlenberg fell one
point short of Swarthmore, granting the Garnet a firstround bye and automatic placement into the semifinals.
The extra rest is welcomed because Swarthmore had
played three straight overtime matches.
While all of those games ended in disappointing ties,
the team is staying positive. "In some ways we're kind of
discouraged, but I think everyone is really excited and
pumped for this weekend," Coleman said.
Anckaitis agreed. "Sometimes on a journey you have to
take a detour. The detour doesn't lessen the splendor of
the destination," he said. "The upside for us is huge and
we're not letting the route spoil the view from where we
stand."
