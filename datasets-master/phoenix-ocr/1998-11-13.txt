IC Vandalism sparks rally
by Amy White
News Editor
After a week that began
with the vandalization of the
Intercultural Center Saturday
night and culminated in a rally
in front ofParrish yesterday afternoon, several key questions
concerning the week's events
remain unanswered. Despite
this uncertainty, a large number
of students responded decisively
to the incident, organizing meetdiscussions
and
ings,
yesterday's protest.
In particular, the events surrounding Saturday night's vandalism remain largely unclear,
pending an investigation by the
College Department Public
Safety. Although students discovered what appeared to be
vomit and feces in the IC late
Saturday night, it was not until
Sunday night that Public Safety
received a call about it. According to Janine Gent '99, when she
discovered that there were in
fact several piles that appeared
to have been deliberately placed,
she notified Public Safety that a
possible hate crime had occurred.
Gent said that when she realized there were several piles
in various places around the
main room of the IC, she was
"100% sure" they had been intentionally placed there. She
said she found five collections
of what appeared to be vomit,
feces, and candy sprinkles in
various places in the main room
ofthelC.
"This was not someone who
just got sick," said Gent regarding the piles. "Obviously someone took time to set it up." Although the waste was cleaned up
by maintenance crews Sunday
night, Gent said, the smell of
vomit was so strong that HOLA
could not hold its weekly meeting in the IC.
However, according to Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave, "We really don't
know yet" what the substances
consisted of. "It's not obvious

by a layman's evaluation," he
said.
Redgrave said Public Safety
is holding the evidence but has
no immediate plans to test what
the substances consist of. "We
are waiting for the appropriate
time," said Redgrave. "We are
working on a number of other
aspects of the incident right
now."
Regarding the investigation,
which is being conducted solely
by Public Safety, "We have had
a few statements and interviews" with students, said
Redgrave.
In response to the incident,
a group of students led by Jenny
Yang 'OO and Ben Maulbeck '99
organized an open meeting held
Monday night in Parrish
Parlours. An estimated 200 students gathered at the meeting to
voice theirreactions to the incident and exchange ideas about
how to respond.
In addition to many individual students who expressed
their feelings about the event,
several representatives of administrative committees appealed to the group for input.
Meredith Hegg 'OO spoke on
behalf of the Dean's Advisory
Council, arecently formed committee comprised of students,
deans, faculty and staff members, which had held an emergency meeting called by Dean
of the College Bob Gross earlier in the evening. Hegg said
the DAC sought ideas for creating community support for IC
members and for "changing
ideas that allow incidents like
this to occur."
The ultimate product of the
forum was the decision to hold
a rally Thursday in order "to
condemn this crime and to support the IC and its values," according to a statement by the
rally's organizers. The organizers held subsequent meetings
Tuesday and Wednesday nights
to prepare for the rally, whose
aim, according to Yang, included "a reaffirmation of our
community values of respect,

Committee's decision to fund
the Ballroom & Swing Club.
On November 8, Student Budget Committee had granted
Ballroom & Swing a budget of
$3475.
Ballroom & Swing, however, is not satisfied with the
amount of money Budget
Committee has given them and
plans to appeal to Student
Council for more funding.
"We are still held up in the
bureaucracy," said Allan
Friedman 'O2, Ballroom and
Swing's Vice President and
Treasurer. In October, the club
applied for a charter so it could
receive funding from the Budget Committee.
Ballroom & Swing had
asked Budget Committee for
$7305. Budget Committee,
however, cut the proposed
budget to $3475. Budget
Committee members defended
the cuts, noting that their Discretionary Fund has less than
$20,000 remaining. They also
said that Ballroom & Swing
had asked for retroactive funding for its instructors, but that

"I'm not expecting anybody

Barron 'O2, Student Budget Committee member, "but new clubs

people have to realize that there
is a limited amount of money

"The system needs to be
overhauled," said Friedman.
He did note the efforts of Josh
Bess 'OO, Student Budget
Committee Treasurer, and his
assistance with Ballroom &

BC, SAC leaders dispute over DU/Phi Psi Halloween party
by Nate Ashby-Kuhlman
Staff Writer
Funding for the recent
Delta Upsilon-Phi Psi Halloween party has been called into
question. Social Affairs Committee coordinators Tony
Skiadas '99 and Brian Bell '99
spent $3OOO on the party although the SAC committee
only approved an expenditure
of $lBOO. Davirah TimmDinkins, Coordinator of Student Activities, agreed to reimburse SAC with $l2OO of
college money after Skiadas
and Bell had withdrawn the
$3OOO from the SAC account.
Largely because of these
events, said Budget Committee treasurer Josh Bess 'OO, a
new policy is being implemented that mandates advance
contracts for any groups or
DJs that cost more than $5OO.
Only $lBOO of student
money was spent on the party
in the end, said Skiadas, who
is also a member of the DU
fraternity. The remainder
came from the account TimmDinkins oversees and occasionally taps into to fund student events.
"It was established that
she was going to help us out
with our events," said Bell,
who added, "to do what we're
doing, it's expensive." Once
the two coordinators started
shopping for around $lOOO
worth of decorations, they
were dismayed to discover
how little that would buy.
Bess alleges that on the
evening of Oct. 27, the Tues-

day before the party, Bell
called and asked him to write
checks totaling $3OOO.
Skiadas and Bell, he explained, told him that SAC had
approved the $3OOO, and that
they had to pay for the decorations before 1 p.m. on
Wednesday.
But Bell says that he
only told Bess that he and
Skiadas needed checks for
$3OOO, not that SAC approved $3OOO. "When I went
to get the checks I did not
say that. He may have presumed that," explained Bell.
According to TimmDinkins, on Wednesday Bell
and Skiadas told her they
wanted the party to be a
large-scale event because of
disappointment over the end
of the traditional Mary Lyon
party. They did not give her
a detailed proposal until Friday but discussed using
funds from the account she
oversees. That account also
pays wages of game room
workers, the SAC coordinators, Rattech workers, Paces
directors, and Olde Club
management, and it was
tapped last year to fund Mardi
Gras and Spring Fling.
Timm-Dinkins estimated
that she sets aside about $2OOO
of the account each year for
funding "big scale" SAC
events. Skiadas and Bell told
her they would pay for the
party with SAC money, she
said, and that she could reimburse the account later, provided they gave her detailed
receipts.

According to Skiadas, he
and Bell decided to take $3OOO
from the SAC account because
getting to the money in the account Timm-Dinkins oversees
requires processing by the
business office. They didn't
have the time to submit the
paperwork.
"Technically [the s3ooo]
was unapproved," acknowledged Skiadas. It was a discrepancy Bess discovered that
Thursday.
At its meeting on Oct. 20,
Skiadas said that the SAC
unanimously approved $lBOO
of the proposal, less than the
amount the fraternities requested. The committee
picked the Halloween plans of
DU and Phi Psi over a less
expensive proposal from the
International Club.
According to Bess, SAC
spent $llOO for a DJ from
QlO2, $575 on rented sound
equipment, $lOOO on decorations and $325 on food and

Halloween party at Mary Lyon
received last year.
Once they started planning
the party, Skiadas and Bell
said, they had difficulty finding the caliber of DJ and decorations they wanted for the
money they had. "We had nowhere near enough money to
do what this campus was expecting and what our vision
was," said Bell.
The two investigated using
a professional decorator, but
her fee would have been $ 1500
a room. After shopping
around, they bought out Halloween Adventure's inventory
for $973 with a 20 percent discount, according to Skiadas.
Two black lights and two
skeletons would cost about
$lOO, Skiadas said, adding
that with only those decorations a room would look
sparse. But they had eight
rooms to decorate.

History, understanding are key to learning
why affirmative action is necessary
by Mark Charette
Staff Writer
Imagine the following

scenario.

away provisions which attempt to alleviate the racial
and gender inequality that
has plagued the American labor market since the first African slaves were transported
across the Atlantic. Under
auspicious titles like "The
California Civil Rights Initiative", these laws promise voters an end to 'all racial preferences' Without these preferences, it is argued, American society will finally become a true meritocracy and
no one will have to worry
their race or gender is an impediment when applying for
college or a
job. Objective standards
can be applied to all
candidates,
regardless of
their background.
Before
hailing
Propositions 187 and 200 as
purveyors of unblemished
equality, it is worth considering what the terms
"meritocracy" and "objective" mean. If the United
States is ready for the end of
affirmative action and a
"meritocracy" is waiting in
the wings to replace our current system of "reverse racism", one would assume that
American institutions are already awarding enrollment
and employment to candidates of color
based upon
the same (if
not easier)
standards applied to white
candidates.
The
1995
Economic
Report of the
President released the results of an experi m en t
which tested
this assumption. A group
of nearly identically qualified
(in terms of educational attainment and work experience) white and black candidates applied for the same
jobs. Among the candidates
who reached the interview
stage, whites were four times
more likely to be offered a
job than blacks.
Statistical evidence of income inequality along racial
and gender lines abounds.
According to the Department
of Labor, for every dollar
white workers make, black
workers earn 79 cents and
Latinos 70. White women
make more than 25% less
than their male colleagues.

Phoenix damages DU's rep.
To the Editor,
I read with interest your feature on the fraternity system
included in your October 30, 1998 edition and found most of
your articles to be interesting and fairly accurate. As a
Swarthmore alum (class of '75) and a member of Delta
Upsilon, it is true that DU has had a "bum rap" for years.
But there are a few points that may have been overlooked in
your piece on this house. First, the Swarthmore DU Chapter
left the national organization because of discriminatory
practices, which our DU house was the first to combat
nationwide. Second, the fraternity has indeed made significant strides to be part of and not apart from the Swarthmore College community, and beyond., In fact, the Big
Brothers/Big Sisters connection, a first for any Swarthmore
organization, was started during my years with DU. But I
must take exception to the accompanying article about
fraternity hazing. While your disclaimer appropriately
indicates that the "article is in no way intended to reflect
upon or draw parallels to the practices of Swarthmore Greek
organizations", one must question why it was included in
the first place. Was the intended desire to inflame or sensationalize? How can you avoid the possibility that "parallels

latter case, if any reader does draw conclusions that Swarthmore fraternities have similar hazing practices, your article
has done a serious disservice to not only those houses on
campus, but to the good deeds they provide. Hazing activities suggested in the article have long been universally
banned by Swarthmore houses, as they are considered
repugnant, demeaning, and destructive. So, I ask again,
what was your purpose for including this piece?

The

Mulrah

Becoming a senior confers a
sense of liberation. One
can say what one thinks in the secure knowledge that after this
year, all stigmas will be gone, lost
to the same memory vortex that
leads one to recall intermediate
micro as "pleasantly challenging."
In confirmation of this spirit, I've
decided that something really
needs to be done about a significant group of people at this school
who just don't seem to care about
others. I'm not recommending
corporal punishment, just maybe
a little emotional trauma.
The people I'm talking about,
of course, are those who so love
the billowing cumulus clouds of
spring that they try to recreate
these same clouds wherever they
go by burning tobacco. Now, in
all honesty, I think people should
be able to do what they like to
themselves within the bounds of
reason (and perhaps handcuffs),
but I draw the line when they drag
others into it. There is something
wrong when one walks into an
80's party in Paces and can't decide whether the Madonna music
is worth the price of carcinogenic
asphyxiation that necessarily ac-

certain

I'll say it directly.
Smoking bothers

companies it. This is all the more
true since the Student Handbook
specifically prohibits smoking in
all public areas, period.
I'll admit, perhaps the idea of
leaving a party to go have a smoke
might be a bit formidable. It is,
after all, a good twenty feet and
two doors away, and an oft-cited
aspect of winter is that it's cold
outside. As much as I respect this
difficulty, though, when it comes
down to it, smoking is an elective
activity. I can't accept the argument that because it's inconvenient to go outside to fulfill a
chemical need, it's ok to share it
with everyone else in the room.
Perhaps that's the problem—
I mean, come on Damon, it's a
party. Just relax. It's not that
bothersome. Well, I'll confess:
my dancing evokes images of nervous disorders and my social
skills are most compatible with
Montana militias. That by itself,
though, doesn't mean that I have
any less right to enjoy myself than
the next misanthrope.
I'll say it directly: smoking
bothers me. A lot. While it might
be true that many people don't
care about the air, I do. If we as a
community decide that smoking
should be allowed at parties,
formals, and other social events,
then that's certainly a different
story, but as it is, I think Party Associates should adopt this added
responsibility. Just as it's not
good for people to drink themselves into obvlivion, it's not good
policy to make people choose between tolerating a smoke-filled
party or wandering around the
Crum looking for lonely men.
Party Associates are paid to
maintain an environment amenable
to everyone, and by and large they
do quite a good job. The time has
come, though, to stop implicitly
condoning something that really
takes away from a lot of Swatties'
enjoyment of parties. It's true that
it might be awkward or inconvenient to ask certain people to step
outside for their fix, but the fact that
it's not easy doesn't mean that it's
not right or worthwhile. Ultimately,
of course, I wish that smokers
would take it upon themselves to
undergo a minor inconvenience for
the good of the many, but it's a bit
naive to expect them to actually do
it in practice. Given that, I think
something needs to be done, and
Party Associates should step up to
the challenge.

SQU board vandals apologize,
SQU members respond
A few weeks ago, we were notified by Dean Tedd
come forward voluntarily
to apologize for this year's second incident of vandalism
of the SQU bulletin board in Parrish. The students made
this decision after talking to a third party, who heard
about the vandalism through the work of Operation:
CQW. We all met, and we think we agreed that it was
very positive to be able to talk face-to-face with the
people who hurt us/who we hurt. Unfortunately, this is
not an option for the rest of the community: the students
came forward under the condition that they be allowed to
remain anonymous, and in support of their decision, we
are respecting that condition. They fear ostracization,
something we can sympathize with, and we feel it isn't
their job to become queer activists. We also felt that
since the students came forward voluntarily—the first
time this has ever occured—and since their remorse
seemed sincere, it was not advisable to take disciplinary
action against them, so as to encourage them and others
who might voluntarily come forward to apologize for
such hurtful actions. They have, however, each written a
letter of apology to SQU, which we would like to share
with the college community. Since the members of SQU
can't express their reactions to the students in person, we
invited them to address their comments to them in this
forum, so that all of our voices will be heard. As such, all
the thoughts that follow are indicative of the diverse
opinions and feelings of individuals in SQU and QSA,
and not the opinions of the SQU leadership or the official
position of SQU or QSA as an organization. We hope that
the apologies and the responses to them will help restore
a sense of safety to some degree, and that they will
contribute to an ongoing dialogue about hate crimes such
as the repeated vandalism of the SQU Board and the
more recent desecration of the Intercultural Center.

To the Swarthmore Queer Union,
I believe that college is a place where people search
for their respective identities. It is a place where people
mature and become adults. Therefore, college should be a
comfortable environment; people should be comfortable
as they search for their true selves. I violated this belief
when I vandalized the Swarthmore Queer Union's message board. Without thinking, I made a whole segment of
the student population uncomfortable. Thoughtless
mischief became an attack. I did not know that my prank
would hurt and offend so many people. I did not intend to
attack the queer students. I apologize for my inappropriate
actions. I hope that in some way my environment will
make college a comfortable environment again.
Members of the Swarthmore Queer Union,
Recently I was involved in defacing the Swarthmore
Queer Union bulletin board. I wanted to offer my apologies for my unacceptable behavior. I believe college is a
place where students can discover their true identities
while being surrounded in a comfortable environment.
Without even thinking, I made college uncomfortable for
a group of students here. I did not intend to offend so
many people in the way that I did. I hope this apology
will make this college a more comfortable environment
where students will not be frowned upon for the decisions
they make.
Dear fellow students,
I'm writing to thank you for your letters to SQU
members. I wish you could have been at the meeting
when Ben and Julie read them out loud to us. Since you
weren't, I'd like to tell you a little bit about it.
A lot of us were really moved that you were aware of
the effects your actions had on the atmosphere for queer
and questioning students at Swarthmore. One student
said right away that she wanted to write you a thank-you
letter. Others said they were really proud that all the
energy they had put into raising visibility and awareness

IC RALLY RESPONSE
Ben Fritz: The Real World

November 13,1998

4

by Ben Fritz
Columnist

I just came back from the
rally, and I have to write...
In my poli-sci seminar on
Monday, we were talking
about community vs. the individual. Knowing that the professors love us to relate the
political theories we study to
our own lives, I decided to
bring up the example of Swarthmore. "Swarthmore," to
paraphrase myself from three
days' ago, "is a great example
of what de Tocqueville is talking about. Despite its problems, this is a community
where a diverse bunch of
people coalesce around shared
values and goals and, together,
we develop as individuals."
Not much more than a day
after the Intercultural Center
was vandalized and a student
in ML was called a "homo" by
an anonymous bigot, in the
same semester that the SQU
board was torn down three
times and a queer-friendly
friend of mine was "invited"
to a SQU meeting, I said that
Swarthmore is a place where
we all share similar values and
support each other in personal
development.
You know what, though?
I'm not (very) sorry. I don't
feel guilty. I'm not sorry for
my privilege as an uppermiddle class straight white

male that allowed me to be disgusted and repulsed when an
e-mail informed me my
friends' safe space had been
viciously violated and then a
day later to talk about this
school as if that and similar
events didn't happen.
I'm angry.
Angry at myself for not
going beyond simple visceral

disgust at this noxious bigotry
think about how it and so
many other acts make my
friends and neighbors feel unsafe and unwelcome. Angry
for not challenging myself so
that I did not understand that
"community," a term I constantly apply to Swarthmore,
must mean that no (wo)man
stands alone, that as long as
to

this is not a safe and comfortable community for any
Swattie, it cannot be for me.
But I'm not just angry at
myself. I'm not going to solve
this problem by enrolling in
Stat 1 and going to every class
as punishment. I'm angry
that, despite its many laudable
efforts, this college is not set

Administrators should take cue from rally
by Corey Datz-Greenberg
Opinions Editor
As the Swarthmore community should know by now, the Intercultural Center (a space that
was created to be a safe haven
for those who are institutionally
made to feel unsafe) was vandalized last week.
So one should understand
that while the reaction was surreal and sensational, the response of the friendly community at Swarthmore was neither.
Their "our" movement,
Thursday's rally, the organization, the unity, the anger and the
love are all timely, and their
strength is a tribute to the aspects of the Swat community
that we highlight in our propaganda. The pure spontaneity and
size of the reaction can be seen
as an answer to the doubt held
by one unnamed dean last year,
after students responded with
strong fear and anger to a hateful expression aimed at someone in an oppressed group.
Students are getting paranoid. At Tuesday night's planning meeting for Thursday's
rally, one student suggested that
at the rally, we express displeasure with the administration's
reaction to the IC crime. Another student retorted that we
should instead laud them for
their effort, and that while we
have never been pleased with
our administration as students
never should beowe are appre-

ciative and want more of the
same.

We do feel the support of
the administration, and strongly.
The day after the discovery of
the defecation, Al Bloom called
an emergency meeting with the
newly formed Dean's Advisory
Council and the executive
boards ofthe IC support groups.
He sat on the floor with the
group as we discussed our reactions and ideas for how the
school should respond. He fully
expressed his understanding of
the gravity of the incident, the
way that such hatred affects the
whole community and that the
college will not stand for such
hateful expression. He listened
clearly to the concerns of students, some of whom were angry with the administration's actions, and he responded with
sensitivity and care. The next
day, we all received a letter of
condemnation from the President, that eloquently expressed
his personal feelings as well as
the college's general understanding of the student's moral
indignation.
The force of the crime was
felt not just by the loud minority students, overworked in their
double roles as students and as
advocates for their own safety,
but also bv the administration
that purports to include them.
However, as strong as the
college's reaction was, and as
much as I felt actively supported, the IC incident clearly

points to a gulf between the feelings of minority students who
are victims of hate and the
administration's understanding
of those students. Minority students did not merely respond to
an act which they felt was morally repugnant. Instead, we reacted because the statement of
hate had stronger value than just
the brown piles with sprinkles
littering our space.
The true meaning of that hatred, which we can see in the
brutal murder of the black gay
drag queen Lynn Vines last
Thursday, is the power of oppression. It can systematically
silence and disempower us. It
is the statement of the power of
the straight and the white over
those who are not. The institution of Swarthmore, which
claims to be progressive and
moral, still holds remnants of
the oppressive forces we all fear.
Our faculty and administration
still lack significant diversity,
our IC still lacks significant labor resources and our minority
students still lack institutional
acknowledgement that their
strong fear and anger is understandable and respected, and
that their physical and emotional
safety is to be protected. By not
giving its active support, the institution ofSwarthmore remains
our passive adversary.
The active support of our
administration must not only
send a message that moral indignation is unacceptable, but

had paid off. Some people called you heroes. Some people
thought you should be punished more than you were. Some
people were upset that you apologized without revealing your
identities. Other people said it was understandable that you
didn't, since you didn't know how we might react. Our
meeting showed, I think, that we had a lot of different reactions
to such a a significant event.
Part of what was so surprising and cool about your letters
was the feeling they gave us that behind the "incidents" that
seem to plague SQU are real people, not some mysterious
force of nature that's out to destroy us. It's nice to know you
cared enough to come forward. Even if I can't meet you faceto-face, I'll still be appreciative when we cross paths in
Sharpies or in the mailroom. I hope your semesters go well
and you have fun. Take care.
-Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol
Dear fellow students,
It doesn't matter who you vandals are. I'm not interested
in publicly humiliating you. To require you to acknowledge
your act other than anonymously would be poor thanks for
your courage in confessing what you did. I don't approve of
people who are prejudiced against queers (or anyone else, for
that matter), but I approve heartily of someone who can admit
a mistake and try to make amends for it. Whoever you are,
have set a wonderful example by choosing to open yourselves
up. We need to make the most of this opportunity to unite and

also that it will actively fight
against the institutional oppression marked most often by silence: the silence of the innocent
police who watched the beating
of Rodney King and the silence
of hall security in Philadelphia
public schools as they watched
the physical and verbal harassment of a lesbian student. This
is not about moral indignation,
this is about egregious, historical relations which are always
present until they are exposed,
acknowledged and confronted.
Our fear was not just of the potential for violence marked by
the IC crime, but also of the potential that no matter what happens to us, that we will never
receive the same care given to
the straight and white in our
community.
The Dean's Advisory
Council is an excellent enforcer
ofthe college's new obligations
to formulate short-and longterm institutional responses to
the weaknesses in our community that have been reflected by
this incident. The job of community education and minority
support has been delegated
solely to students for too long.
We have taken that job seriously, and we have done it well.
The rally Thursday showed our
unity and our energy. Now, we
need the aid and active support
of the institution which has for
too long, although rhetorically
righteous, remained productively silent.

-Willa Bandler 'Ol
Dear fellow students,
I am more than grateful that somehow, due to the level of

visibility of the queer community this year at Swarthmore, and
due to the sense of community that we have constructed here,
you realized that you were at fault and turned yourselves in for
destroying the SQU board. Some part of me, however, wishes
that you had received more than a slap on the wrist. Some part
of me wonders how sorry you really are. Some part of me
thinks that your anonymity is a shield by which you can
remove yourselves from how many people you hurt and
offended not just in the queer community, but those people in
support of everyone's basic humanity.
I want you to know that when cowardice and subversion
are your weapons of choice, you leave the burden of teaching
on those who are strong enough to persevere against an enemy
that they cannot address directly. Petty acts of vandalism don't
solve the problem—they breed intolerance and immaturity.
You supposedly have learned a lesson. How many more
will reach the same conclusion? How much more outrageous
do these attacks have to become before they are considered a
danger to those ideals that Swarthmore so identifies with and
people become upset enough to allow their own apathy to
recede and do something about it?

IC Rally won't change
perpetrators' minds,

confrontational
environment created
by George Balgobin
Contributing Writer
I question the goals behind
the actions taken in response
to the defacing of the IC. To
me, it seems there were two
distinct ideas that could have
provided the backdrop for the
Thursday rally: the feeling that
a show of scorn would shame
the perpetrator(s) and future
perpetrators into not committing more acts, or the notion
that such a rally would change
the minds of the people who
would deface public space.
Both these ideas require differing, and in many ways opposing, methods of approach,
however, the rally seemed not
to truly address either of these
concerns.
Were the rally founded on
the concept of
shaming
people into
cowardice so
that future
vandalism/
hate
acts
not
would
take place, the
organizers
missed the
point that stirring up confrontation is
exactly what
serves to provoke normally
listless people
to act out.
Such public displays fly in the
face of people who may have
unpopular opinions regarding
the IC but normally wouldn't
be triggered to express those
actions. While rallying may
serve to curb public outbursts,
it pushes counteraction underground manifesting itself in
the form of anonymous acts.
Rallyers fail to see that by asserting themselves (though
they have the right to), they
don't fail to engage in real dialogue with the opposing viewpoint. People are not inclined
to change their minds when
they are uniformly informed
that they are wrong (even if
one feels they are).
However, this may have
been the point, if unstated.
The idea of changing the aggressors' minds appears to
have been the subcurrent of
the rally. Signs posted around
campus stated, "Put the WAR
back in Swarthmore." Such
signs call into question what
the purpose of responding to
the IC incident in the form of
a rally was. Was it an attempt
to secure the campus against
future acts of vandalism, or
was it to try and convert

people's modes of thinking?
Such statements seem to be
part of a trend. For example,
the Campus Queer Watch,
while not possessing the virulence connoted by "war", is
targeted in a similar direction.
While the stated purpose of
such a movement is to show
support amongst the student
body, the group must be concerned with the remaining
people on campus who choose
not to wear buttons. I do not
mean to deny them the right
to have such a movement,
however, as someone who has
no beef with queer people, I
still feel that such a movement
is counterproductive. Being
visible for the sake of the right
to be visible is not effective for
anything but provoking the
very people who already oppose prominent displays
of lifestyles
they don't
endorse.
This, forme,
translates to

Yet, this
seems to pin-

the

more insidious under-

belly of such
a rally. Perhaps the unis
goal
to maintain a
spoken
feeling ofmoral superiority. It
may be justification enough
for a rally that doing so allows
people to feel good about
themselves, and feel vindicated in a certain sense by the
show of consensus that they
are all in the right. Was the
rally trying to stop further vandalism? Was it really trying
to uphold a dialogue with
those with differing opinions?
If either of these ideas were
truly the goals of such a rally,
I feel the arrow certainly sailed
wide. Let me be perfectly
clear, it is because I feel rallying is not an effective way of
addressing the gap which lies
between people of different
opinions on this campus that I
write this at all. Sometimes,
the best course of rebuttal is
to steal the other side's fire by
not reacting, and thereby lending credence to the perpetrators' actions. Of course it is
incumbent upon the deans to
investigate any matter of public disturbance, but maybe if
the rallyers didn't feel the
need to one up the vandal izers,
future acts would be fewer and
far between.

dents carrying picket signs and chanting, "The rally is starting, are you
there?" walked through the public
buildings gathering people. Then, with
the chant of "respect, safety, unity," the
rally began.
The themes ofrespect, safety, and
unity were emphasized both by the
emcees, Jin-Fang Yang 'OO and
Michelle McKeithan 'OO, and by the
rally's first speaker, Ben Maulbeck
'99. Maulbeck began his speech by
describing the emotional impact that
the IC vandalism had had on him,
stating, "I cried, and it was not what
I would call a good cry." His description evoked the pain felt by many
members of the IC groups, but his
tone soon grew more positive, as he
described the planning meeting in
Parrish Parlours, where he was "once
again moved to tears, this time not of
horror, but of hope."
Maulbeck also emphasized
that the rally was not meant to be simply a condemnation of the incident
in the IC, or ofprevious the incidents,
but that it had specific goals beyond
this, such as a full-time Dean of
Multicultural Affairs, more diversity
workshops for faculty, a vigilant
documentation of hateful acts, a re-

Contributing Writer

quirement for a class on social justice,
and others. Maulbeck stressed, however,
that being at the rally did not necessarily mean that one had to agree with
each of these specific goals.
Maria McMath '99 spoke next,
specifically addressing assumptions
that had been formed by members of
the Swarthmore community, "it is
naive to assume that the perpetrator
is not someone you know," she said.
She then spoke out vehemently
against the rumor that the IC vandalism was perpetrated by a member of
one of the IC groups to create an incident to rally around. She used violent examples to disabuse people of
this idea, and explained that those
who suggest that this could be true
"do not understand that the IC is used
not to promote division, but empowerment."
Rodney Morris 'Ol described
why he found support groups to be
important, stating that they "support
you and help you to be who you are
and, when you get knocked down,
they help you up." He suggested that
support groups do not have to be delineated by ethnicity or sexual orientation,
but can also be families, hallmates, and
sports teams. He found support in the

5

BCC, because there were experiences
that he felt were very difficult for him to
communicate to those who had not experienced them and felt their effects.
Nonetheless, he stated that the support
groups make an effort to reach out and
communicate with those outside the
groups.
This emphasis on communication
was echoed by many when the mike
was opened to a public forum, guided
by Katrina Clark 'Ol. The audience
snowed respect to all participants in the
open mike, and many different messages were conveyed by a great variety
of individuals. This provided an example
ofthe respectful communication that can
continue beyond the rally.
After the open mike, Marissa
Colston 'OO led the audience in a moment of silence followed by a brief period of chanting, after which the rally
was closed with the message that we
must keep the spiritof the rally and not
lose momentum. Before leaving, the
audience signed a large banner in a lasting symbol of communication and respect. This banner will be displayed, the
signs will be hung in the IC, and a collage of photos of the event is being
planned for Parrish Parlors.

"He Got Game"
starring Denzel Washington

Give Oscars

Ben Fritz

The Other
Unreal
World

Quick! Name five big movie

stars.
That should not have been too
tough. But here's the rub: how many
of them are women? Probably zero,
maybe one.
Is the situation for the fairer sex
really that dire in Hollywood? It certainly is clear that, from Harrison to
Leo to Tom, all the top talent who
can draw $2O million or more for a
couple of months work is male. In
general, however, it is no longer true
that men are in a class of their own
in Hollywood.
Despite persistent, albeit narrowing, gender gaps, actresses such as
Julia Roberts and Demi Moore do
command phenomenal salarieswell over $lO million—which put
them far ahead of most of their male
counterparts. Furthermore, and much
more importantly, there is very little
in the way of a division between
"manly" roles and "female" roles
anymore. Helen Hunt holds her feisty
own against Jack Nicholson in "As
Good As it Gets", Joan Cusack steals
the show in a role W.C. Fields might
have once played in "In & Out";
Sigourney Weaver kicks more ass in
each "Alien" movie than Arnold
could ever dream of; Judi Dench exudes just as much dignity as Anthony
Hopkins was ever to able in "Mrs.
Brown." I could go on forever.
It is obvious that although there
are persistent problems of sexism in
the entertainment industry, this bias
no longer manifests itself in continuous and blatant division of roles
based on traditional gender stereotypes. Given all this, it does not make
sense that Kim Basinger is not allowed to compete against Robin Williams. In short, why are there separate categories for actors and actresses at the Oscars?
Many Swatties are surely familiar with the arguments of "difference
feminists," who assert that treating
people equally does not always mean
treating them the same, and in some
cases there are real differences between men and women which require
that different standards be applied.
But can anyone out there seriously
argue that that criteria applies to acting? A woman can act just as well as
a man in any role.
Acting Oscars are still divided by
gender based on ancient, and no
longer applicable stereotypes. Think
about how you would feel if there
were separate categories for Best
white, Asian, black, and Hispanic Actor. Pretty ludicrous and offensive,
eh? The same logic applies to gender differences in this case. Yes, roles
are often cast based on racial stereotypes, but successful actors such as
Denzel Washington and Whoopi
Goldberg have gotten past many of
the barriers that face minorities and
made clear that the differences between white and non-white actors
result from casting, not talent. In fact,
the differences in pay and fame between minority and white actors are
much more substantial than those between men and women. For instance,
try to name five famous white actors.
Now name five famous non-white actors. Name two famous non-Black
actors of color. Regardless of how
substantial those differences are,
however, people of all political
stripes and backgrounds would be
rightly outraged if someone proposed
creating separate categories in the
Oscars for actors of different races.
Some of you may remember
three years ago that Jesse Jackson led
a protest outside the Oscars when
nary a single minority was nominated
for any prestigious awards despite a
wealth of potential talent. Last year,
as well, not a single actor of color
got a nomination; hacks like Minnie

Odundo visits the List Gallery
By Tannia Jauregui
Contributing Writer

The amazing works of Magdalene Odundo are
now being exhibited in the List Gallery. As a vis-

iting artist welcomed by the William J. Cooper
Foundation, Magdalene Odundo has come from
Kenya via the United Kingdom to share her eclectic pottery designs with the Swarthmore community. Odundo is one of the most important postwar period potters creating elegant, organic designs
which are meticulously worked to perfection.
Combining styles and traditions from such diverse
cultures as ancient
Greek and Roman,
Japanese, Native
American, and African, Odundo's hybrid pots portray the
universality of the
human experience.
In abstracting her
forms from the essence of all cultures she creates images that can
affect and inspire us all.
Being a post-modern artist, Odundo adheres
to the discipline of her own technique and is free
to work with her own ideal of aesthetic values,
rather than having to conform to values set by the
community or society. To the inspiration for her
work she looks carefully at the world around her.
Yet the path to inspiration did not come easily for

MUSIC REVIEWS: Phoenix Picks

Butterfly Child
"Soft Explosives"

Fan Modine
"Slow Road to Tiny Empire"

Class
"First"

Hitlt!

Phovsho

Double Agent

I hated this album the first time
I listened to it; it's so schmaltzy!
But it has grown on me, and I feel
that it is now within my conscience
to recommend it to my readers.
Butterfly Child's work has a kind
of new-wave ballad appeal that is
difficult to resist after extended exposure. It insinuates itself so secretly, and so annoyingly, that it is
a total surprise when you're humming along with the melodies and
hearing the words of certain refrains
like "You're still my number one,"
ringing in your addled head. The
music is loaded with synths, echoes,
and strings, and it is definitely
overproduced. The vocals try very
hard to milk every sort of emotion
from the listener. They don't succeed,
but at the same time, they aren't a total turnoff. "Drunk on Beauty" is a
shamelessly epic river-ride, and
"Someone's Sister" really has a beautiful texture under all the gloss. At
the beginning, it reminds me of my
favorite song off the new Arab Strap
recording; maybe that's why I like it.
So maybe this CD is enjoyable just
because itreminds you of other things
that you like. Give up to this music
anyway and let it tuck you into a big
bed of complacency. Let it take care
of you. It may be a little oppressive
at times, but if you justlet it, it treats
you real nice.

Here is another good band that is
Gordon Zacharias is Fan
Modine, a real quality 10-fi band that
combines the epic with the homegrown. There is a lot of beautiful music on this album, a good deal of it programmed into a computer by "The Fan
Modine" and the rest contributed by a
bunch of guest artists. A lot of it is very
rough and percussive, but underneath
there is always a really wonderful,
shimmery pool of pop that is made all
the more beautiful by its disguise.
Chimes hint in the background, and
Zacharias' voice, though mostly hidden
by other noise, is a beautiful floating
thing that really cries for attention.
There isn't much that is new here; the
10-firevolution has come and gone in
my opinion (oops, did I say that?).
Everybody's messing up their tunes
with nasty noises these days. One thing
that distinguishes this album is that a
good deal of it, in addition to the name,
claims roots in Asia. A lot of the melodies are heavily string-laden and have
the lingering quality of sitar music.
That is, perhaps, what lends this work
its peculiar beauty. These are not the
anthemic 10-fi celebrations we've
come to expect from bands like
Guided by Voices, Neutral Milk Hotel, and The Mountain Goats. Rather,
the music is more subdued and meditative, though it's rough and nasty on
the outside.

Class seems to be a mellow bunch
of people. The work on this, which I
can only assume is their first album, is
pretty sparse, and even withdrawn, led
by soft girl-and-boy lyrics. So why
does it seem like huge, shouting pop?
There is an undercurrent of energy in
all this music that makes one wish the
band would amp everything up, electrify all the acoustic work, and turn the
whole thing into a romping punk song.
Of course, it's much better this way.
Class has put together a really nice collection of songs here about all the classic sensitive pop things: love, and,
Well, it's really all about love.
And they use all the right love words.
On "Could You Ever Love Me?" we
have: "I am crying all the time. And I
am sorry now. I knew if I made you
choose, I'd lose." And that's basically
the gist of the whole album. But they
do the sensitive young lovers thing so
expertly, it's hard to see this as a drawback. These thinly-laid acoustic tracks,
which are the main attraction, are sandwiched between slabs of driving DaftPunk-y electronica in a sort of disconcerting juxtaposition. I think they
could have dispensed with the electric
stuff altogether, maybe to make way for
karaoke edits of their songs. Despite
the jarring effect of the computer-generated action movie music, however,
the rest of the album makes for a very
pleasant listen.

one guy.

Whale
"All Disco Dance Must End in
Broken Bones"
Virgin

Whale is back. But what is this?
They don't have Tricky doing his delicious rap work on their new album!
Don't give up on them, though, because they are actually a fine band on
their own. Most of the work on this
album has a very good driving slidepop sound, and Tricky's grinding vocals are hardly missed. It's easier on
this new work to pay attention to the
other merits of the band. The lead
singer has a wonderfully breathy, evil
voice of her own which usually floats
coolly over the chaotic sounds of the
rest of the band. The instrumental
work on the album is by turns, trip
hop, power pop, and grindy, angry
noise. The music echoes the city. A
lot of the random computer noise on
this album is reminiscent of alarm
bells, screeching cars, and sirens. And
Whale is the gang of kids that owns
the streets. The band remains as insulting and chaotic-minded as ever.
They have a mocking sort of attitude
found in very few other bands; it's
almost like they're little kids who are
telling on you, or talking back to your
parents. That might be annoying coming from some musicians, except that
these people do it so convincingly and
with such appeal.

No one's smiling at "Happiness"
Solondz's film is
uncompromising,
unflinching and
simply unpleasant

forms is that the vessels suggest their utilitarian potential,
while simultaneously repelling any and all possible attempts at actually being used.
They very clearly assert their
status as aesthetic pieces
which are to be contemplated rather than handled
and used.
Aside from the breathtaking forms of her pots, the
magical qualities of the pieces
are accentuated by the
smoothness of their surfaces
and the intriguing color patterns they have. To finish and
color her pots Odundo uses a
gas. kiln following oxidizing
and reduction methods to get
a charcoal-black color, or she
uses purely oxidizing methods
to get a bright red-orange result. Odundo has fired her

pieces up to five times to get
the result she wants and thus
manages to keep a tight grip
on the random "chance" of the
alchemical process of firing.
The results of her disciplined
and patient process are pots
which are as stunning in
color and texture as they are
in form.
The level of skill and feeling which Odundo has developed is the result of fifteen
years of hard work and exploration. As Andrea Packard
pointed out, we all have journeys to make and it's interesting to be able to observe different people at different
stages of their journeys. Taking a look at Odundo's journey, and the point at which she
is now, can give each of us insight into our own journeys
and encourage us to continue
even in times of struggle.

For all its faults, basically every suburban satire is little more than a footnote to
David Lynch's challenging and imperfect
1986 masterpiece "Blue Velvet." Todd
Solondz's uncompromising, fascinating,
and deeply unpleasant "Happiness" is the
most recent challenger. After having been
awarded at festivals and dropped by its original distributor, "Happiness" has arrived at
art-houses across the nation amid a flood
of critical praise and the sort of "controversy" which independent films seem to
need to make a profit these days. The movie
has also been released without a rating, and
no review has failed to mention the reason
why "Happiness" is without arating: a frank
presentation of a homosexual pedophile's
predatory actions and two more-or-less uncalled for ejaculation shots.
Although the film is extraordinarily
well-acted,generally well-made, and often
powerful in its straight-faced depictions of
American desperation, "Happiness"
amounts, as a whole,
to little more than a
somewhat sadistic
envelope-pusher
which packs more
indie creed and "serious" aims than
"Something About
Mary."
This is not to
say that Solondz has nothing more to offer
than grittier jism gags than those provided
by the Farrelly Bros. But, he does not have
the clarity of vision which made "Blue Velvet" great. Whereas Lynch built his own
world by making Lumbarton, "Blue
Velvet's" setting, into a bizarrely idyllic fifties suburb where people actually look like
Kyle MacLachlan, Solondz sets "Happiness" in a drearily "real" version of New
Jersey. While his view of his characters is
as distanced as Lynch's, Solondz gives us
characters whose ugly lives are supposed
to be as "real" as the ugliness around them.
"Happiness" demonstrates that
Solondz's vision is neither compassionate
nor measured enough to pull that off. The
characters never develop into people we can
care about, despite the Herculean efforts of

the cast, because Solondz does not care
enough about them to make their outrageously dysfunctional lives believable. Also,
"Happiness" never coalesces into a whole
in any recognizable way, and the stories do
not so much evolve as they accrue. The continued accumulation of misery upon misery does not count as development.
Solondz does not ease the audience into
his remarkably bleak vision of suburban hell
as much as he drops us into it. The first scene
of the film depicts
Joy (Jane Adams),
the sweet sad sack of
the three sisters
around whom "Happiness" is loosely
focused, breaking up
with her boyfriend
Andy (Jon Lovitz).
Things get rough,
and Lovitz
in a
surprising and imwinds up
pressive dramatic performance
delivering a memorably vicious monologue
eviscerating Adams. After he delivers the
final line ("...and you're going to be shit until
the day you die."), the two stare at their
plates for an awkwardly protracted moment
before Solondz finally gives us the
punchline: the title of his film, appearing
onscreen.
The word "happiness" appearing after
so unhappy an affair is funny, I suppose; if
you are the type who laughs out loud at that
kind of juxtaposition, you might want to
wear some sort of adult diaper to "Happiness." That sort ofcomedy is Solondz's sort
ofcomedy, and "Happiness" is jam-packed
with this special
type of mean-spirited yuks.
Of course, the
juxtaposition is not
funny if you care
about the people to
whom these misfortunes are happening.
ln order to enjoy
"Happiness," the viewer has to be as distanced from the characters as Solondz himself. Apparently, some members of the audience were able to do this, or at least tried
to do so. There were numerous painfully
forced laughs at unfunny moments in the
film, as if audience members who had heard
the film described as a comedy were having a difficult time giving in and realizing
that most of it was not very funny at all.
Solondz is not asking the audience to
laugh at "Happiness"' pedophile, Bill (portrayed
in an astonishing and bold performance
by Dylan Baker), a psychoanalyst and family man who spends his leisure time lusting after his 11 year old son
Billy's (Rufus Read) friends and masturbating to Teen Beat-sty\e magazines in the
parking lot of a local convenience store. Bill

"Happiness" seems
to be its primary

No bones about it: Philly's White Dog
Cafe, though obscure, is a real treat
This off-campus canine cafe
has great atmosphere,
friendly, unpretentious service
by David King
Writer at Large
Although Philadelphia has been
called the best restaurant city in
America, most Swarthmore students
would undoubtedly be hard pressed
to name even a handful of the city's
notable restaurants. Le Bee-Fin, an
extreme, might come to mind. Or perhaps Jim's Steaks.
But for those lucky enough to
stumble upon a jewel of a restaurant
in peaceful University City, Philadelphia suddenly becomes a more alluring place to trek to on a lazy weekend morning. Case in point: the White
Dog Cafe.
A recent trip into the city for Sat|
urday brunch with Mom sufficiently
reminded me that the White Dog Cafe
is far more than a quaint, collegetown restaurant. It is, you realize
upon entering, almost an urban bed
and breakfast, with just the right
amount of charm.
It's the details that immediately
grab your eye: the little lamp on the
table with a white, wooden dog for a
base. The ornate plates with painted
dog faces lining the top of a wall, the
Paintings of people and animals in extravagant frames.
Still, while decor is important,
this finicky eater made the journey all
the way into Philadelphia for a delicious meal (well, the meal and to see
Mom). Ordering, however, proved
even more overwhelming than looking around the room.

The diverse brunch menu,
"printed on 100% tree-free paper," offers a wide variety of choices. In addition to the usual brunch options,
such as eggs and omelets, French
toast, and pancakes, it lists delectable-sounding sandwiches and an
array of interesting salads. Fortunately, the food more than lived up
to the mouth-watering memories
of my two previous

visits—-

brunch for the first time (or so he
said),really seemed to mean well. But
when we asked for an order of bread,
he brought us an assortment of muffins instead a disappointment, but
not really. The muffins, served in a
basket lined with a pretty cloth, were
soft and delicious (A subsequent request for bread brought a basket of
room-temperature, thickly-sliced rye
bread that lacked a noticeable flavor).
Not quite full, I then ordered an
organic golden apple salad with cider
thyme vinaigrette. What came was an
attractive medley that included endive, baby spinach leaves, toasted
walnuts, and goat cheese. But the
combination of flavors, and perhaps
too strong dressing, didn't work
as well as I had
anticipated.

taste that in and
of itself made the
meal a wonderful diversion from Sharpies.
An order of poached eggs with
seasoned, fried potatoes (a special request that our waiter was willing to
accommodate) received a positive review from my mom. On the other
hand, my stack of multi-grain, lemonricotta pancakes, topped with walnuts
and served with maple-walnut syrup,

attractive as the other rooms.
Beware, though. The underlying
theme of this culinary canine extends
to where you might, depending on
your mindset, least expect it.

is an essential part of Solondz's satirical
goal; although he outwardly fulfills all the
requirements of bourgeois normality, Bill
is utterly debauched, thoroughly miserable,
and completely unwilling to deny his urges,
whatever the cost to himself or innocent others. As a personification of a generation's
self-centered, consumptive, and unsatisfying lifestyle, Bill is almost too potent. He
is satire so good that it is just not funny.
Solondz's satire of suburbia is merciless but also repulsively cold and hilariously unfair.
Solondz clearly had
a rough time growing up in New Jersey; "Happiness" is
filmed in a far dingier town than upscale Livingston
where
Solondz
spent his youth. His
first feature, 1996's "Welcome to the
Dollhouse," was an equally vicious portrayal of miserable youth. Unfortunately,
Solondz is held back from achieving his
goal of a cutting portrait of suburban depravity and misery by his own rage. Clearly
there are issues which need to be resolved
before he will be able to make an evenhanded film, let alone a truly sharp satire
about the suburbs.
By contrast, in "Blue Velvet," Lynch
provided the distance for his treatment of
suburbia by making hjs setting an archetype instead of a real town; the moments of
viciousness and depravity shredded the barriers between intellect and emotion, and
made for a film of explosive impact.
Solondz gives us something much more unpleasant for all his film's supposed "realness." Nevermind that successful writer
Helen lives in what looks like a housing
project, the same building as wage-slave
Allen; forget that the film's single most
powerful scene (a brutal dialogue between
Bill and his son) is all but unimaginable
under any realistic circumstances. Even if
we suspend our disbelief, Solondz offers us
nothing and no one to believe in.
Solondz's main point may be that there
really is nothing and no one for us to believe in, but it makes for an unpleasant
filmgoing experience. If "Happiness" were
more illuminating, or even interested in being illuminating, perhaps the discomfort
would be effective. Instead, the ugliness, the
deep wwhappiness of "Happiness," seems to
be its primary purpose. "Happiness" has
been called a "brave" film by some critics,
but they mistake audacity for real, creative
bravery. Sure, it's audacious, but "Happiness" is lacking the fundamental bravery
necessary to care about its miserable characters, or to regard life in suburbia with any
perspective other than the desperate conviction that the film is above it.

SPORTS
Basketball season soon to tip off
8

by Jean Quinn

Contributing Writer
The start of the basketball
season is rapidly approaching,
and the women's team is shaping up to be a legitimate force
in the Centennial Conference
this year. For months, the Garnet have been rigorously training for the 1998-99 season, and
soon they will be able to show
their merit on the court.
Head Coach Adrienne
Shibles returns for her third year
at the helm of the women's basketball program and is joined by
Assistant Coaches Pamela Porter and Lisa Rubin. Things already look promising, as
Shibles notes, "We should have
a lot more depth this year than
last. Several people are looking strong in the guard spots and
are competing for a starting position. I think we should be
stronger in all areas."
The team spent four days
every week in the fall preparing
for the upcoming season and appeared at the first official conditioning practice in better
shape than in recent years. Having twelve players participating
m the pre-season practices and"
drills made the intense work-out
a possibility; last year, only
seven players were available in
the fall. "The effort that the
women put forth this pre-season
has been amazing. Captain Jean
Quinn '99 did a great job of organizing workouts in September and October," said Shibles.

"Not only did the team play basketball, but they were busy running on the track, lifting in the
weight room, and working on
their defensive footwork. The
hard work put forth early in the
school year will certainly pay
off this season."
The team finished 8-16 last
year, but fared well in several
games against tough opponents.
The players aim to improve their
standing this season and to rack
up more victories.
Three starters from last
year's squad Kristen English
'Ol, Heather Marandola 'Ol,
are back to lead
and Quinn
the team. Marandola led the
team in scoring last season with
13.4 ppg. An excellent defensive player, she picked up a
team-high 66 steals and averaged 7 rebounds per game as
well. English poured in 10.5
ppg from the point-guard position and returns as the team's
sharpest outside shooter. Quinn
dominated the boards last season for the Garnet, collecting
10.3 rebounds per contest, and
averaging 9 ppg.
New faces on the team include posts Heather Kile 'O2 and
Cai'tlin Ryland 'O2, guards
Christina Ciambriello 'O2 and
Katie Tarr 'O2, and Emily Gray
'O2, who is practicing at both the
three and four spots. "The first
year students have already
found their niche on the team,
and there is a cohesiveness
which is rare this early in the
season," said Shibles. Guard

The Green Terror ofWestem Maryland College began last
season with two games on the
road. In football, the away team
wears customarily a white jersey for road games. After notching two early wins, Western
Maryland decided not to mess
with a good thing, and they have
worn white jerseys to every
both home and away
game
without losing a contest
since. As the Garnet Tide
stumbled into Westminster reeling from a last second defeat the
week before, the Green Terror
took the opportunity to end any
superstition that may have clung
to their traditional home jerseys.
Wearing green for the first time
in two years, the Green Terror
rolled over Swarthmore, with a
final score of 42-0.
The final score does not accurately reflect the true nature
of the game, however. Swarthmore found itself within seven
points of the defending conference champs after the first period. The 21 point second quarter sealed the game for the Terror. Swarthmore's ground
game, hindered without starting

tailback Donovan Goodly 'O2,
faltered throughout. Joe Aleffi
'OO worked the middle of the defense behind the lead blocks of
fullback Prirce Achime 'OO.
Aleffi led the team with five
catches for 32 yards. The bulk
of the offensive production
came through the air, and tight
end Charlie Ellis 'Ol snared four
passes for 58 yards.
The defense showed great
resilience early, despite the poor
field position surrendered by the
offense. A pair of freshman, Joe
Corso 'O2 and Axel Neff 'O2, led
the Garnet with 13 tackles each.
Adam Booth 'Ol came up with
nine tackles of his own, while
Tony Hillery 'Ol added eight. In
the end, the athleticism ofWestern Maryland proved too much
for the outmatched Garnet defense.
This week marks the final
game for the Tide, as the Generals of Washington and Lee
march to Swarthmore. The Tide
will have to work without its
leading tackier, Jon Banner 'O2,
who was injured during the
week. The offense will have to
find some balance and provide
better field position for the defense if Swarthmore has any
chance to close out the season
with a victory.

The A-side women's
rugby team lost a heartbreaker
to the Horned Toads of Bryn
MawrHaverford (BMH) 14-10
on Saturday, while the B-side
squad won its game 12-0.
The A-side match was
rough, and although Swarthmore led 10-0 at the half,
BMH fought back to gain the
lead and eventually the win. In
the end, the difference between the Swat and BMH
teams was only two conversions. The first half, however,
was full of high points for
Swarthmore.
Danielle
D'Olivera 'OO used her speed
to score the first try of the
game with a beautiful
breakaway from around half
field. The backs were in sync
throughout the first half and
the second Swat try was also
from a back—this time, Noelle
Goodin 'OO, who didn't touch
the ball down in the try zone
until after she had banged
neads with a BMH player, receiving an injury that required
22 stitches.
After Goodin left the field,
Swarthmore was playing without four of its usual starters,
but the team did a valiant job
nonetheless. Alice Hershey
'O2 played well at prop in her
first A-side stunt and the back

line adjusted well to Goodin's
departure as Cathy Vaughan
'Ol took over as fly half.
Danielle Thomas '99 and
Tracy McNeil 'OO played aggressively as loose forwards
and tackled with great force.
Laura Louison 'O2 had a historic day as she played wing
in her first Aside game and
then switched over to hooker
in her first attempt at being a
forward —an attempt so successful that she is now practicing in that position.
The B-side game was not
as bloody as the A-side game,
but it had all the guts and then
some. The first try ofthe game
went to Hershey, who utilized
her forwards in support and
then fiercely touched the ball
down. The second try was
completed by Abigail StewartTeitelbaum 'Ol who finished
off a beautiful sequence of
back passing to set herself up
perfectly for the twopoint conversion. For the backs, Shira
Kost-Grant 'O2 was also a big
contributor in the game, playing tough and with confidence.
The forward play looked
dominant as Cori GarrettGoodyear '99 and Elizabeth
"Phil" Meehan 'Ol led the way

Hockey loses to Wesley to end season

Haverford loss

by Jean Quinn
Sports Editor

by Jill Eaton
Contributing Writer
Last Saturday's game against
Haverford marked the end of the
season for the men's soccer team.
Despite a disappointing 6-1 loss, the
game was exciting for spectators as
Swarthmore stepped up their play.
Swat's lone goal came in the first
half when Scott Samels '99 tipped
from Austin Harris '99.
There was no disappointment
sr the game. MattMenendez'99
emphasized the progress the players and the team have made over
the year. "Saturday's game was a
moving display ofskills learned and
perfected on the Jay-V's," he said.
"Mason [Astley '99] and Morgan
[Adams 'oo] are fine examples for
all aspiring athletes. They have
stepped up out of nowhere and
made sure we noticed."
The men ended up with an
overall record of 3-17 for the season. However, the record's importance was minimal for many members of the team. "It goes beyond
winning or losing for us," claimed

Mhot

The Garnet field hockey team
fell in the semi-final round of the
ECAC Championships last week
to Wesley to bring their season to
a close. The squad ended the year
with a 13-7 record and with a second place finish, tied with Washington College, in the Centennial
Conference.
Wesley had been the number
two seed in the tournament and
benefited from hosting the semifinals and finals on their own
fields. Their players came out
strong and had a 2-0 advantage
at the half. Holly Baker' 99 managed to get one ball past the
Wesley goalie, but the Garnet's
offensive attack could do no
more. The final score was 2-1.
According to Head Coach
Julie Mazer, a combination of
skill and luck helped Wesley win
the game. "Wesley is a very physically aggressive team, and they
knew how to play their field—the
lifts, the speed on the ball, the free
hits, the goal-keeper was good off
of the bounce," Mazer said.

"Wesley had a potent attack, two
very quick wings—they were a
strong team." But Mazer was disappointed with the Garnet performance. "It took us too long to
adjust to the field. We lifted too
many free hits and did not execute
well," she recalled.
Although they did not repeat
the success of previous Garnet
hockey teams, the 1998 squad has
much reason to be proud. Five of
the team's seven losses came at
the hands of teams who advanced
into the NCAA Championship.
Mazer added, "[We] are playing
at the most competitive level of
Division 111 hockey, and to be
ranked fifth in our region is excellent. The top four teams in our
region go to the tournament. It is
a credit to our five seniors [Baker,
Lurah Hess, Jen Hagan, Donna
Griffin, and Lynne Steuerle], who
were all four year starters. They
are a big part of why we are competing at this level."
Defender Katie Tarr 'O2
painted the picture of a strong,
unified team. "I have never
played on a team that had such a
passion for winning. Since the

first day, we knew our goals and
worked our hardest to achieve
them," she said. "The supportive
atmosphere made each practice
exciting. Each player had the love
for the game and it showed every
time we were together on the
field."
Several players received individual honors at the end of the
season. Hagan was named to the
second team All Centennial and
to the second team, Regional All
American. Baker (who led the
conference in scoring) and Griffin were both named to the first
team All Centennial and to the
first team Regional All American.
The pair will also compete in the
prestigious North/South Senior
All Star game on Nov. 21st at
UPENN.
"I am very proud of this
team," concluded Mazer. "They
faced a great deal ofadversity this
season and never gave up. No
other team we face has the same
academic demands placed upon
them. Our team excels academically and athletically, and I think
they are a remarkable group of
women."

Samels.

Mike Schall '99 agreed. "We
did what we could with what we
had and damn it, we were justthere
to play together," he said.
According to Alvaro Munoz
'O2, the team has shown vast improvement over the
