Tri-Co tests Moodle against Blackboard
BY ALLISON

GANTT

aganttl@.swarthmore.edu

Earlier this month, the college
began testing Moodle and an upgraded
version of Blackboard as possible
replacements for the current learning
management system Blackboard.
Discussion of Moodle's test-run
began as early as last semester
amongst Tri-Co and ITS, prompted by
the release of the newest version of
Blackboard in January 2009. The financial downturn also played a large role
in the talks. Collectively, Tri-Co pays
approximately $35,000 a year for
Blackboard use, Associate CITO Eric
Behrens said. Over 90 percent of students access the current Blackboard
system each week.
"All three schools were interested
in looking around if there were alternatives less expensive than Blackboard
but offered the functionality that we'd
like," said Andrew Ruether, Academic
Technologist for the Natural Sciences
and Engineering.

After thorough investigation and
research, Moodle appeared as the leading alternative, Ruether and Behrens
said.
Moodle is an open source software,
which means that the program is available to the public to download and use
at no cost.
"[That] isn't to say it's free to run,
but we wouldn't have to pay licensing
costs," Behrens said. "The other costs,

WEEK IN PICTURES

BY HANNA KOZLOWSKA
hkozlowl@swarthmore.edu
This piece is part ofongoing coverage of
administrators' transition to Abu Dhabi.

With the creation of the 2010-2011 budget and the search for the new dean of stu-

dents still in the works, no definitive deci-

sions have been made regarding replacements for outgoing Assistant Director of

Student Life Kelly Wilcox '97 and
Assistant Dean and Director of the Black
Cultural Center Timothy Sams.
Although Wilcox is set to leave for
NYU Abu Dhabi at the end of the week,
it's unclear what will happen to her
responsibilities in the long run. Wilcox
was in charge of a number of projects,
including the Drug and Alcohol Resource
Team, which she created, and the

Swarthmore Wellness Awareness Team.
She was the go-to person for the parlor
parties and Paces as well as an academic

advisor.

"We haven't absorbed and re-sorted

everything yet," said Myrt Westphal,
associate dean for student life. According
to Westphal, the president and the new
dean will eventually evaluate the positions and, keeping budget constraints in
mind, make hiring decisions for the long
term. However, at the moment there are
no concrete plans or committees.
"This is a time to stop and analyze.
I would love to see a separate person for
wellness, but there are budget constraints," she said, referring to Wilcox's
position.
How the budget will impact the hiring

absence yet.
She added that she has neither met
with Acting Dean of Students Garikai
Campbell '9O nor been e-mailed about the
matter. Though it's typical for the president and vice president to meet with the
dean of students frequently, she said that
this has been delayed by the special vice
presidential election.

In the meantime, DART and SWAT are

undergoing a process of reshuffling and
self-evaluation. DART has recently doubled in size, acquiring twenty new members. "We're more in the process of phasing in the younger students in than phasing Kelly out," said Tyler Bradshaw 'lO, a
DART team member.
Two December Swarthmore graduates, Sami El-Dalati 'lO and Humzah Soofi
'lO, were hired as paid interns to take

over the administrative part of Wilcox's

job, including overseeing DART and

SWAT.
El-Dalati worked with Wilcox as a
Party Associate during his time at
Swarthmore. Currently he is shadowing
Wilcox during her last week. "The team
itself is pretty self-sufficient. I'll just be
working as a facilitator for meetings," ElDalati said of DART.
Soofi was not available for an interview because he is currently out of the
country.
DART member Rosalie Lawrence 'l2

might not foster enough stability within
the group. "We're trying to be more self-

sufficient, but there is a lot of uncertainty
because both Kelly and the seniors are
leaving," she said. "It's going to be

messy."
Though an action plan for the spring
semester has been established, events
have been planned, and staffing arrangements have been made for the time being,

students have voiced a need for an advisor. Bradshaw said this need is connected
with the issue of liability and safety of the
advice DART gives to students.
Wilcox stressed, however, that she is
making sure that student leadership is in
place.

"It is my responsibility to leave [the
teams] structurally sound," she said.
"There might be a slight learning curve
at the beginning, but the students will
have the institutional memory [needed to
carry on]. It was a collective effort from
the start."
Natalie Degaiffier 'lO, who has been a

member of SWAT since her freshman
year and even a leader at one point, said
that she thinks Wilcox has "done a good
job at making the transition go smoothly." She added that leadership within
SWAT will be spread out for example,
one member may be responsible for publicity and another for education.
"In an ideal world, a new position
would be a full-time wellness director,"
said Wilcox. Beth Kotarski of the Worth
Health Center and Westphal, a wellness
advocate, will be deliberating long-term
wellness initiatives.
Wilcox said that a person replacing
her should be "detail-oriented, hardworking, listening to the students, patient, not
narrow minded. It would be helpful if
they had background in public health and
student affairs."
Both Wilcox and the students acknowledge that her being an alumna was also
very helpful in conversations about campus life.
"When talking about drug and alcohol
issues you have to be candid, and with

Wilcox has been a part of the
Swarthmore community for 17 years, asa
student, alumna, field-hockey coach and
member of the Dean's office. She said she
is grateful for the freedom and space she
had been given, the deans' trust in her
vision, the support. "I had the opportuni-

ty to directly give back to my alma mater,
a place I love, students I love," she said.
"I will miss the people, the beautiful
campus, the woods that bring me peace.
But above all the people, the interactions
which bring me joy. This has been such a
collegial, supportive, vibrant environment," she said.
Since Wilcox got involved with SWAT
over the past two semesters, Degaiffier
said that Wilcox has helped the team
rethink its mission statement, get dean
support and create a website.
"She's just been great, and she'll be
sorely missed," Degaiffier said.
Bradshaw agreed. "We're sad, but it's
a smart career choice for her," he said.
Wilcox won't be directly transplanting
her Swarthmore projects to NYU Abu
Dhabi. "It's a different cultural context,
perspective," she said of DART. She will,
however, be working on wellness initiatives there. "My core value is supporting
students anywhere I would go," she said.

Brian Craig said that about 15 to 20 bikes

she said. "I feel like we're in

bikes]."
Redgrave, though, said that the num-

ber of thefts is in line with the past.
"With crime, you have to look at a
fairly long period of time to see trends...
I don't see this as an unusual trend. The
bikes that were taken were valued at
anywhere from $5O up to a few hundred.
I don't see any trend that somebody's targeting high-end bikes," Redgrave said.
However, Public Safety also does not
receive reports of all bike thefts that
occur on campus.
Jonathan Hui 'l2 had his unlocked
bike stolen outside of Rogers, and chose
not to report it to Public Safety.
"I was already thinking of getting a
new bike," Hui said. "When it got stolen,
I decided it wasn't worth the effort [to
report it to Public Safety."
Redgrave also acknowledged the fact
that not all information about bike thefts
are reported to Public Safety.
"Whether students report this or pot,
if anything, is up to them," Redgrave
said. "One could've been stolen but if it
wasn't reported to us, we wouldn't have
known."
The stolen bikes are usually never
recovered, and little can be done in the
attempt. A reduction in student faith in
the security of Swarthmore is sometimes
left behind.
"There's some trust that I have that's

dorm and took [taken] it, who knows
what else they could've done if they were
more malicious."
While both the Borough Police and
Public Safety provide students with tools
to prevent bicycle theft, these are rarely
publicized or used.
For example, the Borough of
Swarthmore Police Department provides
a bike registration program that allows
anyone to come in with a bike and to
report its serial number, allowing it to be
identified if stolen and recovered. Craig
said, though, that only two to three people per year register their bikes.
He added that the

borough recovers
about 20 to 25
bicycles a year
that, if unregistered, are hard to
return
to the

owners.
"It's very hard
to match them up

with the owner.
Because we have
such limited storage space, we hold the
bicycles for 90 days and then we try to
make arrangements with a charity to
donate them," he said.
Students may also check out
engravers for free to engrave their driver's license numbers on their bikes.
Redgrave said the engraver purchases
were inspired by the national Operation

Identification Program, which encourages people to mark their belongings to
prevent theft and allow recovery for

stolen objects.
He admitted, however, that he "can't
think of the last time anyone's used" the
engravers.
Redgrave said, though, that engraving
the owner's driver's license ID is the best
way for police stations across the country to return recovered bikes to their
owners. Whereas serial numbers are
only known to police stations where the
bikes are registered, any police station in
the US can retrieve information from a
driver's license number.

most stolen bikes were unlocked.

"We get very few reports of bikes
stolen that are secure, and just being in
the dorm is not secure. It needs to be
attached to something," Craig said.
The presence of locks does not always
guarantee bike security, though. Both
Nick Palazzolo 'l3 and Alex Huber-Weiss
'l3 had locked bikes stolen last semester
one from the bike rack outside
Wharton and one from the rack between
Dana and Hallowell.
Redgrave said that while any type of
lock deters a thief, U-shaped metal bike
locks are recommended because they are
hard to clip.
"The number of bikes that have been
locked with that kind of lock, I can only
think of one case of when it has been

up the bike over the pole," Redgrave said.
In addition, Craig recommends students take off parts of their bike when
leaving it behind. "The other possibilities are maybe removing the wheel or

and teamwork, and guide them
through the development of a
final project that uses all the
skills they've learned.
"Primarily, I was very
interested in this because I felt
people turned a blind side to it,
either Colombians living in
Colombia, Colombians living
abroad, the world, or the government," Rojas said.
"And just like people in
Colombia have learned to live
with violence, people have
learned to live with displacement."
Currently, Rojas and Frye
are seeking two committed
proficient
students
with
Spanish background to join
the Taller de Paz team. These
students will become workshop leaders and collaborate
with another member of
Conciencia Social to develop
lesson plans.
Colombia has the largest
population of internally displaced people in the world. For
50 years, La Violencia, an
armed
internal
conflict
between drug dealers, guerilla
insurgencies, militaries and
paramilitaries in Colombia,
has forcibly pushed peasants,
farm workers and villagers
from their homes and into the
outskirts of large cities where
resources are scarce.
Outside Bogota, the capital,
40 to 50 displaced families find
refuge in the northern district
of Suba every day. They often
have to fend for themselves
due to a lack of resources and
governmental support.
After working with ESL students in Kennett Square, PA,
through Club Despertar and
with children greatly affected
by the 1992 Bosnian genocide
following his freshman year,
Rojas decided to gather a team
of three other students and
develop a program to focus
specifically on helping the

6

children of displaced families
in Bogota.
Rojas discovered Conciencia
Social, an organization initiated by two students of La
Universidad Javeriana in
Bogota that has dealt specifically with this crisis since 2007.
"We got involved because we
wanted to create room where
people could be aware of the
displaced peoples' problem,"
said Daniel Huerga, one of the
founders of Conciencia Social
which partnered with Rojas
and his team during the fall of
2008.
"I'm pleased working with
Swarthmore students. They
provide us knowledge and compromise [and] they are very
responsible with the project
even though they are far away,"
Huerga said.
The program offers displaced children ages 10 to 14
the opportunity to spend several weeks during the summer cycling through four workshops in photography, art,
English literature and social
justice. All workshops, focusing on empowerment and nonviolent self-expression, culminate in a concrete final project.
In the art workshop, children created murals exploring
topics such as basic human
rights and the importance of
taking care of the environment.
In the photography workshop
students created digital stories
about different people in their

strong relationship formed
between Swarthmore students
and the community in Bogota
was the most significant
accomplishment ofthe summer
for the members of Taller de
Paz.
This upcoming summer,
Rojas and his team hope to
establish a parent committee in
order to further the sustainability of the program.
With input from parents and
guardians, the program can
adjust to the needs of the community and rely less on
Swarthmore students.
"We're looking for someone
who is just really excited, who
can really on some level connect to the crisis, who's really
about working with kids and
social justice," Rojas said.

community.

Taller de Paz plans for the
final projects to be displayed
throughout the community as
well as in the United States to
spread awareness about the
program and the current crisis
in Colombia.
While Taller de Paz shares
many elements with traditional
schools, members of the team
try to make the workshops as
fun as possible for the students.
"[Taller de Paz] is school-like
in that we have workshops
which are educational, but we
try to run in a nontraditional
style and very rarely was I ever
standing up in front of them
while they were sitting down
and dictating a lesson," Frye
said.
"Everything was very interactive and usually without
desks or chairs or anything like
that. It was kind of like a
hybrid version of a camp and
school."
Last summer, the displaced
families in Bogota welcomed
the program into their community.

Parents transported their
children to and from the program. It was customary for parents to invite members ofTaller
de Paz to their homes for casual gatherings or to watch their
children compete in soccer

tournaments.

The Bumpit: From Sarah Palin to the masses
ture become enough of a trend that they
reflect back upon society; their trendiness either reveals pre-existent meaning, or creates new meaning. Today, and
once every two weeks for the rest of the
semester, I hope to explore such phenomena, to observe these deepest and
darkest reaches of human nature. And I
will start with the institution of hair
manipulation that is the Bumpit.
I discovered the Bumpit one day
when, bewildered by the numerous
comedic references that I had heard and
seen made about them, I decided to
Google-search the word. I shall warn
you, the infomercial clips that I found
were some of the most terrifying
Youtube videos I have ever stumbled
upon, aside from the time someone
made me watch one of an elephant giving birth. The glazed-over eyes of the
robot-like hair models, the sinister
stage smiles, the sheer height of the
hair... Oh dear God, what's she putting
on her head?!
For those who are thoroughly confused by now, a Bumpit is a hair accessory, or more accurately, a hair insert,
that one wears and then combs the hair
back over, creating a bouffant-like hair
style that literally looks like a bump on
the crown of the head. Apparently they
are advertised on TV all the time, something that my time abroad last semester
sadly deprived me of. They even come
in different sizes, so that one can make
those weird little frontal hair-bumps
with their bangs should they choose, as
opposed to the larger back-of-the-head

Fortunately for us, some pretty hilarious stuff becomes normalized too. In
this column, I hope to explore these
nuances of popular culture, the absurdities that go unnoticed or undiscussed,
and the implications that they carry
with them.
Sometimes, when a few people notice
an abnormality in the daily drudgery of
celebrity gossip, reality TV and whatever else comprises the background static
of American pop culture, they point the
anomaly out. They tell people about it.
They blog about it, twitter about it,
write about it. They post it on "Texts
From Last Night." These abnormalities
in the fiber of popular culture turn into
trends to be spread and replicated.
Some trends mill about for a time, and
some almost instantaneously disappear
again with the rest of the drivel. They
might even become memes, if only I
could figure out exactly what that word
means. Yet often, elements of pop cul-

bump.
My initial reaction was that we are
clearly just reverting to the beauty standards of pre-Columbian Latin America
by replicating the distorted-head look
that the Mayans created by strapping
boards to babies' foreheads. Then I realized that most Bumpit wearers were
probably not aware of this practice, so I
thought again. Is there some deep,
primeval human attraction to having a
lumpy head? Has the concept of volume-

cartoon

by

oriented hair products just gone wildly
out of control, with people following
along like lemmings? Then, a more

recent factor suddenly occurred to me:

Sarah Palin's hair.
For those of you who were only horrified by her politics and happily able to
ignore Palin's awful red suits, caked-on
makeup, and beauty queen up-do, the
woman had some significantly high
hair, especially relative to most female
politicians. There was definitely some
major hair teasing going on, if not a
kind of Bumpit prototype. Sarah's manicured image in general was a topic of
much scrutiny, but her hair became
especially symbolic, to the extent that
"Sarah Palin hair" is now a recognizable term for most. But it wasn't just that
her hair was very obviously styled: It
was showy, dramatic, over the top. It
was what Bumpit-wearers might call
"luxurious," and sane people might call
"ridiculous." Sarah Palin was sending a
message with her hair: "I am sophisticated, but spunky too!" Personally, I
would argue that in reality, "sophisticated" translated into "tacky" and
"spunky" into "trying too hard," but
unfortunately it seems that Bumpit
owners everywhere would disagree.
The clientele of my food store at home
in rural Maryland is strong evidence of
this. Palin's hair started a trend that
declared bigger to be better when it
came to hair, and it escalated from
there, quite literally.
So, it might seem that Sarah Palin
has convinced American women that
they too can be both "serious" and glamorous, if only they express their ambition through the height of their hair.
But there is more to it than that: Much
like Palin, Bumpits are as famous for
being made fun of as they are for being
liked. Rapidly replacing Palin as the
high-hair icon of the day is Snooki from
MTV's Jersey Shore, a figure who is
famous almost entirely for making people feel superior to her. The female
image has developed a dichotomy where

women are besieged with images to
replicate
and then ridiculed the
moment they misstep or get carried
away. This mentality of using artifice to
create a supposedly "natural" image has
escalated to the point that
are
actually putting hidden plastic support
systems into their hair.
When confronted with this fact, it is
tempting to call for a stop to this madness, or to give up hope for a sane society altogether. But the truth is, we have
been doing strange things to our hair
for centuries, and it's not likely to stop
now: Just think about powdered wigs.
But it is possible to benefit from such
absurdity by observing, learning and
hopefully being entertained as well. I
hope you will join me in this endeavor
as I delve into topics like these, the
dregs of popular culture that we laugh
at but seldom really think about. I am
diving into the abyss.

rather than her past. Li said, "I see art as

BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT

qgounotl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore students and faculty are
in for a treat. The List Gallery is currently
holding an exhibit of the artist Ying Li's
work. This exhibit, which features some
thirty paintings and drawings, is sure to
evoke a powerful response. Spanning
many styles, techniques, and settings, it is
a visual journey through a culturally and
emotionally rich life. Its stunning depth
and breadth of expression make it well
worth the detour.
Li's life story bears the mark ofadversity. A native of China, she experienced
the Cultural Revolution of 1965-1977. This
period was tryingfor her family. After her
father, a professor of Russian literature,
was accused of sedition, her family was
broken up. She was "re-educated" in a
hard labor camp in the countryside and on
occasion had to create propaganda murals
for the government.
When political repression eased, she
studied art at the Anhui Teachers'
University, where she learned Westernstyle oil painting. In 1983," she immigrated
to the United States and obtained her
Master's of Fine Arts degree at Parsons
School of Design. Today, Li is chair of the
Art Department at Haverford College.
If Li is haunted by anything, however,
it appears to be her creative compulsion
:

an expression of the artist. You just have
to do it" Her creative fever is clear in the
intensity of her deliberate, sweeping
brushstrokes, the density of her compositions, and the contrast between her colors.
Through the thickness of oil paint, she
creates different levels of meaning, using
paint to play with the texture of her paintings. Andrea Packard, the director of the
Swarthmore List Gallery, said, "Painting
is a very elastic medium so it allows for a
response to a subject over time." While the
painting might appear frozen in place, it is
actually a dynamic entity.
The play on texture makes Li's paintings interesting from both close up and far
away. At a close proximity, one gets a
glimpse of the intricacy of her work, the
precision and passion inherent in her
brushstrokes.
At a distance, one acquires perspective
on the work as a whole, as a set of signs
that communicate something greater
together. These paintings invite a doubletake and call for careful and active looking. Li said, "I don't want people to look at
my paintings in one second. A painting is
a slow process. First, you see the boat,
then the paint, then relief, then tension..."
Li's paintings, while straying from
strict representation, are deeply imbued
with setting. The notion of place is at their
very core. Indeed, Li's artistic career has

■

■

takenher to a variety of places. It is impossible to really talk to her without hearing
names such as rtFogd" (Capeverde) and
"Montecastellb" (Italy). These places have
spurred Li's personal and artistic growth.
She seeks to both know and call upon
them through her work. Li said, "Every
place I have been [to,] I am attached to. I
think about it; I dream about it." About
Pogo specifically, she said, '"There are so
many layers to that place. I really want to
get to the center ofit."
Li takes the viewer along on her trips
in a subtle, often fairly abstract way.
Transcending simple illustration, she
aims to conjure moods or atmospheres.
For example, she evokes natural elements
such as water, earth, and sky without really representing them. She wants to bring
not just the physical beauty of a place to
the canvas, but also its "people, history,
culture, and sentiment." Faye Hirsch, senior editor of Art in America, wrote,
"{These places'] remarkable diversity
results purely from the interior dialogue
she carries on with nature and her own
artistic process."
As for any political or social function,
Li was insistent on the notion ofher art as
self-contained.She said, "Art is a language
with its own integrity. It extends on its
own, interconnected like a spider web."
Although she appreciates the artistic freedom she finds in the United States, the

Weina Qiu Phoenix Staff

denunciation of propaganda is not an
overt goal on hers. Rather, her experiences of censorship and repression are
biographical elements that color her life
and inform her art,
Ying Li's work is already up in theList
Gallery in the Lang Performing Arts
Center, Today, January 28th, she will be at
Swarthmore to give a lecture on the
exhibit at 4:30 p.m. followed by a reception.

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Genevieve Woodhead
Class Year: 2012
From: Pasadena, CA
Current Residence: Alice Paul

What She's Wearing:
"These boots are Etienne Aigner
mom's. I think these socks are Hue and

Helsinki residents) among

...

probably Hue," Woodhead said. Both the cardigan and
corduroy skirt are from J. Crew. "This top was a handme-down from my best friend's boyfriend's mom and
the belt I found." Her necklace is a geode, an intricate
rock formation found in mainly sedimentary and volcanic rock. "My dad's a geologist, so he buys my mom a
lot of rock jewelry at craft fairs," Woodhead said, adding
that her necklace is probably from a craft fair as well.
Woodhead loves wearing black; this outfit highlights
this preference. Her Etienne Aigner boots are one ofher
favorite items in her closet and are a great auburn
color. With the black tights and knee-high gray socks,
Woodhead is spot on with a current fashion trend.
Though many women have done this over the years,
having socks peek out over boots is a fresh way to stay
warm and look effortlessly cool. The combination of
black, gray and brown is especially appealing.
How She Describes Her Style:
Woodhead came up with a unique description of her
style. "My friend and I collectively decided that I have a
sort of bitchy nerd," maybe nerdy bitch [kind of style],"
she said. She added that it's usually "pretty prim."
Her Fashion Influences and Inspirations:
"A lot of the things I like, I don't actually copy or
model myself after," she said. Most of her inspiration
comes from movies, including the recently released
Brothers Bloom and the 'Bos Madonna movie Desperately
Seeking Susan. The fashion in both these films involves
a lot of black with some pops of color, very similar to
her style and penchant for black.

Woodhead also likes street style websites. "All the
Scandinavian people know how to dress," she said, citing blogs Stockholm Street Style, Copenhagen Street
Style and Hel Looks (which features fashionable

favorites. She also included her
roommate, Alex Rodriguez, as
another source of inspiration.
Rodriguez was featured in the Swat
issue.

Where She Shops:
Woodhead frequently shops at The
Salvation Army. "It's always funny
there because it's usually old people,"
she said, but when there is another

young person browsing, "you're like
glaring at them to make sure they don't
take anything that you want, or if they
do, that they'll put it back." She admits
that she can sometimes leave with too
much pleather or polyester, but it's a
great shopping experience for her. "I
love J.Crew, too. I think J.Crew is a place

that can bring people together," she said.

Favorite Designers:
Woodhead has expensive taste in "highclass stuff that I can't really get," such as
Chanel and Mayle. Since she spends most of
her shopping time in thrift stores, though,

she feels that she favors certain brands
more. "Etienne Aigner and Easy Spirit shoes
are always a good win."
fit

Most Fashionable Time Period:
"I love Victorians," she said, "and I'm an
Anglophile." She is also interested in the
Edwardian era. Both eras featured an emphasis on the small waist and wide hips with the
use of corsets and billowy bottoms to dresses.
Lace was used in many women's clothes
because of its delicate and feminine nature.
Woodhead's lace top evokes the Victorian and
Edwardian style, and her waist-cinching belt with the

A-line skirt is a modern twist to the fashions of both
eras.

synopsis,

ESPN shot of a penalty kick and just
like Beckham.
Love and lovely looking characters
fortunately coexist in this film. Jess
eventually falls for Joe (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers), the coach of Jess and Jules'
team. Understandably so
Jonathan
Rhys Meyers in this movie is tremendously handsome. It's a rather G-rated
romance as far as depictions go, but
charming all the same. And heterosexual male or lesbian viewers need not
feel left out: Knightley and Nagra, as
usual, are equally as beautiful.
Remember they are in tip-top shape for
soccer season.
"Away We Go" (2009) is very similar
to "Bend It Like Beckham," but with a
different storyline and more sophisticated, mature concepts. And before
this was one of the
you ask, yes
movies that the Movie Committee
brought to campus last semester. Burt
(John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya
Rudolph), a couple mutually agreed to
be indivisible even without marriage,
fmd out that they will soon be parents.
The couple soon learns thatBurt's parents, whom Burt and Verona originally moved to live near, are packing up
and moving overseas (impending
grandchild notwithstanding). Dejected
and unsure of where to go, Burt and
Verona tour the United States and
Montreal looking for somewhere to
start their family. They visit siblings

and old friends

all of whom have

enchanting dispositions or highly
amusing quirks that make for unforgettable vignettes.

A lot of the characters are down-

right outrageous, and yet very plausible. Naturally, then, hilarity ensues
throughout the movie. The roles
played by Allison Janney ("Juno") and
Maggie Gyllenhaal ("Dark Knight,"
"Secretary") are especially noteworthy; Janney plays an unreserved and
robustly opinionated mom who picks

on her own children, and Gyllenhaal
plays a borderline lunatic neo-hippie
who has anxiety over strollers. Need I
say more?
The ways in which "Away We Go"
is shot certainly reinforce the main
theme of rare devotion as well as the

quirky undertones. Any example I can
think of would be too hard to adequately explain without living in
Burbank for 10 years or interning with
MGM. It's something that you need to
experience for yourself. Again, like
"Bend it Like Beckham," the movie is
not exactly a cinematic Rembrandt or
even Chagall, but it's just right for

what the movie is about.
To top it all off, this movie has one
of the most sincere, warm, make-abeliever-out-of-you depictions of love
I've ever seen. It's nowhere near the
cookie cutter variety you'd find on
Lifetime or in Hallmark Classics,
either. "Away We Go" makes that myth
of everlasting devotion feel very real,
even for those who either secretly or
not-so-secretly
despise those impossibly pleasant chick flicks and
Nicholas Sparks novels alike. What
makes it so believable is the fact that
no one person or one thing or one
event is perfect in the entire movie.
The film is grounded and punctuated
by the sadness, the so-called imperfection and the frustration that we know
too well, which makes the laughs and
love so clear and so authentic.
So whether you need a laugh, something or someone nice to look at, a
pick-me-up or a break from the now
standard CGI-saturated action flicks, I
strongly recommend "Bend It Like
Beckham" and "Away We Go." Trust
me when I say that it's films like these
that can yield not only genuine smiles
but also a fresh appreciation for life,
even for the most acrid of critics.

romances or, hey, just eye candy, neither of these films will disappoint.
"Bend It Like Beckham," released
in 2002 in the U.K. and in 2003 in the
United States, details the story of Jess
(Parminder Nagra), a girl who must
bend the rules imposed by her stiflingly traditional and devoutly Sikh family
in order to pursue her dream and gift:
football, or soccer for us Americans.
When Jess meets Jules (Keira
Knightley), a similarly footed girl from
a typical and slightly more supportive
British family, she is convinced to try
out for her town's semi-official
women's league. Needless to say, Jess's
mum and dad don't care for the idea of
their future doctor kicking around a
football in short shorts instead of
learning how to be a cultured, "proper
Indian woman," so they forbid her
from playing. But, in true teenager
fashion, Jess plays anyway and simply
neglects to tell her parents. Of course,
there's a happy ending that I'll leave
for you to either figure out or see for
yourself: (Come on, people, I said it

Previews continue to pack a punch, despite criticism
&

swarthmorephoenix.com

Last Friday, the Wall
Street Journal ran an article
Broadway
titled
"Are
Previews Outdated?" which
explored the ways in which
amateur theater bloggers
and soaring ticket prices
have
rendered
the

Broadway preview superfluous. What the article did not

discuss was the way in
which this new generation

of outspoken theatergoers is
lending a hand by speaking

up.

The purpose of the preview is to give the director
and the actors a chance to
see how an audience will
respond to their work and to make changes accordingly.
After a show officially opens in any equity theater, the
actors' and stage managers' contracts prevent the director from making any further changes. Without a preview,
there would be no opportunity for fine-tuning.
Ellen Gamerman, who authored the piece, is not saying the previews aren't useful for the cast and crew; in
fact, she points to several shows that have greatly
improved during previews. Rather, what Gamerman is
suggesting is that the hazards of allowing a plugged-in,
modern audience to see a show before it is "ready" overshadow the benefits of seeing a live audience react.
What Gamerman neglects to mention, however, is that
the bloggers and Internet peanut gallery are doing exactly what a preview audience is supposed to do. They are
providing a detailed response, one that is more nuanced
than any survey could capture and more precise data
than any director can collect with simple observation.
Audience members who go home to report on line flubs
and set issues do the show no great service—undoubtedly someone else has noticed them as well—but the other
moments they remember, the images and actions that
stuck with them, and the emotions they express are useful details for a savvy director.
To those who fret that early critical comments on the
web will adversely affect ticket sales and attendance, let
the words credited to showman P.T. Barnum ring clear:
"All publicity is good publicity." Most people are still well
enough informed about the hazards of the Internet that
they understand the difference between an anonymous
comment on Broadway World.com and the opinions
expressed by a review in the New York Times. If they
take the comments with a grain of salt, then all the blogger has done is make the show better known.
Hopefully, those readers also understand that the experience of sitting behind a director and choreographer
who are wildly writing notes by flashlight is an experience strictly reserved for one or two (un)lucky guests
during early previews—a problem which can, incidentally, be remedied at virtually every preview by an usher,
since extra seats are always kept empty in previews, for
financial backers and industry big-wigs who decide to
swing by.

Another concern that audiences and producers face is
the question of preview pricing. Previews are just as taxing on the cast and crew as long-running shows, if not
more so, and a celebrity does not cease to be a celebrity if
they forget a lyric from time to time. In addition, while
some shows have made great strides during the preview
period, the majority of the show will resemble the end
result, if only because of time constraints. To charge full
price for a show in its first few days of previews may be
unreasonable, but as the opening night approaches, it no
longer makes sense to offer a discount, and there will
always be people willing to pay to be in on the next big
thing.

When tourists visit Manhattan and want to see a show,
they are often looking for more than just a great production. Often, they are hoping to see the thing that everyone
has been talking about, or to beat their friends to the
punch by seeing a show before anyone else. If a trip to
New York happens to line up with previews for a show,
tourists have the chance to become an industry insider,
even if only for a few days. Imagine the satisfaction they
might feel when a review shows up in the paper a week
later and they can disagree with the critic and picture the
moments mentioned therein. To pay the same price for
the experience one week that someone else has paid for
the following week is no injustice it's just a matter of
-

scheduling.

] Moreover, if a tourist unwittingly stumbles into a preview and has a bad experience, it is regrettable, but it is
more than likely their own fault. Tickets sold online by the
theater always put the word "preview" in italics and when
buying in person the box office has a large sign proclaiming the opening date and that the show is in previews. For
purchases over the phone, employees are trained to confirm that the purchaser wants to attend a preview. Even
the TKTS website (the discount ticket seller run by the

Theatre Development Fund) carefully explains previews,
when they rarely have preview tickets available. Only a
scalper could get away with hiding the fact that a show is
a preview, and those who buy tickets from scalpers are
already taking a risk.
Gamerman is worried about theater becoming too
affected by popular opinion, but it is farbetter to have con-

versations about theater turning viral than to have them
stop altogether. At least with this trend, the fears that have
plagued the theater business since the advent of film can
be momentarily set aside: there is still a place for theater,
amidst all this new-fangled technology.

Zucker,
I suppose that,
when one

letter to a

powerful
figure

such

Alex Israel

as

yourself,
it usually
begins

'

with
some sort
of pander-

ing formality that thanks you profusely
for your time and attention and suggests
that, while you are an extremely busy
man, if you could just take a few minutes
out of your day to read this letter the
author would be so grateful, blah blah
blah.
However, I don't really feel like taking
this route. While I do realize that you
have your hands full desperately trying
to breathe life into the once-great network that you've managed to destroy, I
think you can take some time out from
crushing people's hopes and dreams and
answer one simple question: what were
you thinking?
Actually, I know what you were thinking, at least up to a point. You thought
that moving Jay Leno from 11:35 p.m. to
10:00 p.m. would not only save you a bundle on developing those pesky scripted
shows (some of which don't even manage
to succeed!), but would also allow you to
keep in your employ a talentless hack
whose show is the comedic equivalent of
a hot dog from 7/11: it will suffice if you
have nothing else to eat, but you certainly won't like it, and it will probably give
you indigestion.
All this because, five years earlier,
you had made a promise to a lanky redhead (whose show, by the way, is the
equivalent of a well-made mole sauce:
creative, unexpected, and awesome) that
he would, one day, realize his dream of
hosting The Tonight Show.

in which he said, "I
cannot participate in what I honestly
believe is [the] destruction [of The
Tonight Show]." It was a ballsy move,

released a statement

and one that left you in the unfortunate
(albeit well-deserved) position of having
to fire either Conan or Jay. You chose to
fire Conan. In other words, you stayed
perfectly consistent with your established pattern of championing profits
over creativity.
Public opinion, however, is turning
against you. The other late-night hosts
are all championing Conan: Jimmy
Kimmel spent an entire episode of his
show dressed as Leno in order to take
pot-shots at him; David Letterman hit
new heights of relevance by continually
and hilariously deconstructing the situation; on Conan's last night on the air,
Jimmy Fallon and the Roots sneaked
into Conan's old New York studio to sing
Boyz II Men's "It's So Hard to Say
Goodbye to Yesterday," and Craig
Ferguson sarcastically noted that NBC is
the only place on television, other than
Mythbusters, where the prevailing philosophy seems to be "This is working, so
blow it up!"
The anti-Zucker (not to mention antiLeno) backlash is also palpable among
the general public. There are over 50
Facebook groups named "I'm with
Coco," the largest of which has almost
750,000 members. Conan himself has
thanked all his fans, who "made a sad situation joyous and inspirational."
Ironically enough, all those fans earned
Conan's last episode of The Tonight
Show a truly impressive 7.0 rating.
Maybe, Mr. Zucker, you were a little too
hasty in canning Coco.
Anyway, it's about time for me to
wrap this letter up; I have to finish my
seminar reading, and I assume that you
have mergers to make, situations to spin
and puppies to bludgeon to death.
However, I'll leave you with one last
thought. Conan doesn't need The
Tonight Show. He's smart and talented,
and he'll find his way back into the spotlight.

But there were a group of people who

were lovers and long-time collaborators
on Mateo's films. But Ernesto Martel

usurps the actress under his rich industrialist wings. Before the triangle takes
over their lives, Mateo and Lena are in
the middle of making a kinky comedy

of the Almodovar classic "Women on the
Verge of a Nervous Breakdown." When
Mateo loses his love to Ernesto and his

FLASH THEATER
This Friday, the Department ofTheater will present the first of this semester's five honors thesis productions. Showing on Friday and Saturday evening
at 8 p.m. in Frear Ensemble Theater located in LPAC, the performance will be
a staged reading of M. Sam Goodman's first finished full-length play, "Eats
Shoots and Ladders." An earlier version of the play was presented as a workshop reading last October under the title "Love Touched by the Plow."
Since then, Goodman has performed in Senior Company's "Melancholy
Play" as John (a re-imagining of playwright Sarah Ruhl's British nurse character Joan as a gym teacher). Goodman has also begun work on his honors
directing thesis, Frederico Garcia Lorca's "Blood Wedding," which will be
performed in mid-April. He has spent time revisiting and revising the script
in preparation for this weekend with outside director Rebecca Wright, who is
currently serving as literary director and dramaturg at Philadelphia's
InterAct Theatre Company.
A staged reading is a formal production of a play, staged by a director and
usually including some design elements, as will be the case with this production, whichfeatures the work of sound designer and recent Swarthmore alum,
Dan Perelstein 'O9. The difference between a staged reading and a fully realized production is usually evident in the set and costume designs, which are
minimalist if present at all. The reading will undoubtedly benefit from
Perelstein's sound design, but Goodman's script is rich enough in imagery
and stories to keep the audience engaged, without the accompanying visual
simulation of a complete production. The tale is one of a love which exists
independent of time and the constraints of our banal reality. The reading
promises to be a playful, striking and occasionally poignant experience for all.

Urging the importance of the Tri-Co relationship
Since The Phoenix strongly
supports the relationship that
Swarthmore has with Bryn

that the college should strive to

that students often encounter
when taking classes at another
school in the consortium.
While we recognize that some
of these are too expensive to

smoothed out to encourage
more students to take advantage of the Tri-Co relationship.
One of the major obstacles
to taking a class at Bryn Mawr
or Haverford is the registration process. Currently, a student must discuss with and
obtain signatures from her
advisor, the head of the department from which she wants to
credit,
receive
and
Swarthmore's registrar. Only
then can she travel to
Haverford or Bryn Mawr,
obtain approval from the professor and registrar there, and
enroll in the course.
Also, the software used by
the Swarthmore Registrar is
incompatible with the software
used at Bryn Mawr and
Haverford. Transitioning to a
common system would require
at least one college to purchase
a new software package and
retrain most ofits IT staff, professors and workers in the
Registrar's office. Doing so
would be prohibitively expensive even in economically better times, and the process for
such a change usually proceeds
very gradually, taking place

system with that of the other

While we cannot hope to

simplify the registration procedure at the' other two Tri-Co
colleges in the near future,
some steps can be taken to
make the entire process easier
for students. Swarthmore students who take classes at
either Haverford or Bryn
Mawr will naturally want to
eat
some

there.
Currently, students have to

student who takes a class at
Haverford or Bryn Mawr is

However, a recent decision on the

this decision is based on the potential
for our coverage to give other candidates an unfair advantage in the search

strong impressions about candidates in
readers who were not present at the

Boosting student involvement in college budget
Cuts in the college
budget are, unfortunately, a fact for the foreseeable future. Over the
course of the fall semester, the Student Financial

Planning

Advisory

Committee,
Student
Council and the Ad Hoc
Financial
Planning
Group have worked to
include students in the
discussion of and deciMolly Weston
sions regarding these
Budget Break-down
cuts. Especially with the
proposed cuts to financial
w^m
aid, many students have
strong opinions about
where these cuts should come from and what the college's priorities should be. Over the course of this
semester, this column will try to explain how the college's budget works, where funding comes from, how
it is allocated, and how students can be more effective
advocates for the priorities they want the college budget to reflect.
Why write a column about the college budget? First,
the information the college releases about its budget
can be overwhelming.
As a result, numbers are
thrown around
a billion-dollar endowment, eight
million dollars in cuts
without background or context. For the 2009-2010 budget year, the college's expenditures totaled $lO7 million. Of those dollars, just over
$4B million came from student charges, meaning our
families and us. Understanding where the other $6O
million dollars comes from and where all $lO7 million
goes requires exploring the worlds of faculty compensation, capital expenditures, annual fund giving and
the billion-dollar black box: the endowment. The college has made a number of efforts over the years to
make the necessary explanations available to students, but those efforts have been limited in both time
and space. It is my hope, through this column, to pro-

vide a basic introduction to the ins and outs of the col-

lege's finances, so that students can make sense of the
often confusing or isolated information available, particularly as the college's belt is being tightened along

recognizing the steps that have been taken. In particular, without the past generosity of alumni and friends
of the college and the ongoing support of alums, parents and friends in addition to tuition payments, our
day-to-day lives at Swarthmore would be very different. The college's budget, as you will see in this column, only works if alumni, parents and friends of the
college donate millions of dollars each year. Without
those donations, the lights don't go on, the shelves
don't get stocked, and the faculty and staff don't get

with our own.
Second, informed activists are more effective
activists. Each year, student groups push for the college to make policy changes that necessitate spending
more money

FROM THE 81-CO NEW

Stricter policies aggravate Bi-Co drinking problems
BY JAMES MERRIAM
BICONEWS.COM, JAN. 12, 2010
Everything changed after Lloyd. The
carefree edifice of Quaker cooperation
and trust collapsed in upon itselfand the
entire bi-college community plunged
into a fiery vortex of anger, destruction,
theft, and alcohol poisoning.
Yes, I severely exaggerate, but we do
have a problem. But before you stop
reading out of frustration and boredom
with this tired and overplayed topic, let
me assure you that I at least have a different assessment of the situation and a
genuine alternative as to what should be
done.
The last few years have seen both a
tightening of student and administration party and alcohol policies and, for
no apparent reason, a shift in the cultural context and comfort of the student
body, particularly at Haverford and perhaps linked to the demise of the
Haverford social fund.
Of course the greatest truths are
often revealed through comedy. In the
2008 April Fools' edition of The BiCollege News, sometime Editor-in Chief
Andrea Milne BMC 'O9 wrote of a new
party policy whereby all parties would
take place in Merion and Erdman and
all party-goers would be required to
wear "turtlenecks in the following colors: moss, tawny, and mustard." In view
of the 2009 Halloween parties, her proposed party policy hardly seems like a
joke. With so many "grownups" on cam-

like a church social function, although

the dangers associated with parties are

and quickly.
Three explanations jump to

endary Haverford awkwardness. This is
a clear correlation, and everyone's well
intentioned efforts to "keep us safe" are

completely counterproductive.
On that front, I hate to say "I told you
so," but I did run for JSAAPP co-chair as

Continuing such a policy is absurd.
We are, for all effective purposes, bashing ourselves in the heads with hammers and wondering why our headaches

won't go away.
Unfortunately, the "grownups" aren't
helping, as The Bi-College News reported after the unfortunate events of the
2008 Halloween party. '"[The Lower
Merion Township Police] said they did
not want to work a party again unless
we changed the way we were managing
it, because they felt things were too
much on the edge of getting chaotic,'
said Dean of the College Karen

Tidmarsh '7l"
The raid on Lloyd has clearly aggravated the problem it ostensibly sought to
combat. I do, of course, call for overhauls in social structures quite regularly and the police are not exempt. Why
weren't the state police putting more
effort into preventing the two murders
that occurred in Philadelphia on the
night of the raid, rather than battling
the sociopathic and demonic forces of
Quaker school social events? In this
case, we should clearly try to distance
ourselves from the insane perspective
taken by the so-called local "authorities"
rather than attempt the Herculean task
of reforming them. Keep the cops away
and show the grownups how things
could actually function around here,
before it's too late.

Predictions for the sports world in 2010, part 1

of Lee instead of Roy Halladay (2.79 ERA,
sub-1 WHIP on three days rest) did inadvertently cause them to lose the World
Series, and Miami wasn't eliminated from
NFL playoff contention until the final weekend of the season.
Keep

that in mind as you read my new

set of predictions for sports this year if you
felt I've become a disreputable source. I
may be completely wrong on some of these,
but I'm hoping that my credibility will survive; perhaps people will be more likely to
remember my correct predictions (if any)

rather than my incorrect ones.
One prediction your roommate could make:
Roy Halladay wins the National League Cy

Young
I really do hope this prediction comes
true. If Halladay wins this year's NL Cy
Young Award (given to the best pitcher in
the NL in baseball), I formally get to declare
to all the Phillies fans that read my column
(all one of them, considering how many emails I've received) something along the
lines of, "I TOLD YOU SO." Ignoring personal, self-interestedmotives, however, this
prediction still makes sense.
Over the past four years, Halladay

has

gone 5-2 against the National League in
Interleague Play with a 2.95 ERA and L 22

WHIP. The 'Doc' pitched about six innings
in each ofhis games (this number would be
higher had he not been a reliever for a
game), striking out 55 batters while walking only 14.

There's no reason to think that Halladay
won't be able to keep this dominance up
pitching for the Phillies against other NL
teams. The pitching god that is the 'Doc'

does not seem to be affected by age the way
mortals are (he struck out a career
high 208 batters just last season).
Furthermore, former AL pitchers C.C.
Sabathia and Cliff Lee went a combined 186 after switching to the NL. Since Halladay
is a better pitcher than both, 2010 looks to be
a fun-filled Cy Young season for him. He
even gets to show off his batting skills. Did
you know he's the only Blue Jays pitcher to
earn two base hits in a regular season
mere

game?

One prediction that my father did make:
The New York Yankees make it to the World

Series... again

I figured I'd give my old mana cameo in
my column, as he is partially responsible
for igniting my passion for sports as a kid.
We always watched Yankees games together, and he was the bank behind my forays

into coach-pitched Little League (my
crowning moment, an in-the-park grand
slam) and high school lacrosse. He couldn't
make all the games I played in, but he
always had a camera in hand and a pack of
Big League Chew when he could.
My father and I have different approaches to sports, however. He is a casual fan,
and roots for the New York teams when it
suits him (read: when they're winning). On
the other hand, saying that I love sports is
something of an understatement. So I wasn't surprised when my father didn't give
me a reason for why he thought the
Yankees were making it to the World
Series. He's always helped start things for
me. I've always had to fill in the blanks for
myself.
The Yankees don't lose much from last
year's championship team coming into the
new season; in fact they return an even
stronger lineup and rotation, much to the
chagrin of most baseball fans.
They traded for a quality pitcher (Javier
Vazquez, a strikeout stud who placed fourth
in NL Cy Young voting last year) without
losing any integral pieces of their championship team. To free agency they lost
Hideki Matsui and (potentially) Johnny
Damon, two clutch hitters for sure, but
whose current overall athletic abilities I
venture even I could match.
The Yankees have switched them for
two more than adequate replacements.
Nick Johnson really likes getting injured
and getting on base (he was second in onbase percentage to a guy named Albert

Pujols in 2009) and Curtis Granderson doesn't really enjoy partaking in either of those
things (though he did hit a career high 30

home runs in 2009).
The Red Sox, in comparison, acquired
big bad ace John Lackey. JLAX, however,
has had middling results against the
Yankees. Over the past four years, he's gone
2-2 against the Yanks with a respectable 3.63
ERA, but a pedestrian WHIP of L606. The
Yanks acquisitions seem to put them in the
fast lane to the World Series, especially considering how last year's playoff teams are
worse off after their losses and moves made
in this offseason.
One prediction made

for completely arbitrary reasons: Germany wins the 2010 FIFA

World Cup
I love the World Cup because people
unite to watch it (even those who don't like
sports), announcers compete to see who can

scream "GOALLLL" the longest and most
obnoxiously, and most importantly, I can
watch it without commercials (the soccer is
okay I guess).

It's obvious why I love the World Cup;
what's not as obvious is why I think

Germany will win (to my readers), why
Avatar won best motion picture at the
Golden Globes (to my roommates), and why
Dark Matter is important (to astronomists).
I know Germany faces relatively tough
group play. I know based on purely statistical figures (1 team of 32 wins the tournament), Germany has a 312% chance of winning everything.
The beautiful thing about soccer and
most sports, though, is that their outcomes
are rarely decided by just statistical data (I
guess I just kinda contradicted my last two
predictions). So do away with the stats for
this prediction. Why Germany? Germany
was the team I rooted for at the most recent
World Cup and European Championships
(they almost won both). They have some
players with some really cool names. And
Miroslav Klose has got a pretty slick front
flip. Yep. Those reasons seem good enough

for me.

One surprising prediction because it
involves the Detroit Uons in a positive manner: Matthew Stafford will come of age

interception (as a Packers and Saints fan,
thank you Brett Favre!), and the rest is history. The turnover reminded me of how
momentum and success changes quickly in
the NFL. For example, consider how the
Atlanta Falcon lost both its starting quarterback (Michael Vick) and head coach
(Bobby Petrino) and finished last place in
its division in 2007, but then advanced to
the playoffs in 2008 (behind rookie Matt

Ryan).
I believe Detroit is primed to turn it
around. Though I have insulted the Lions
futility in previous columns, I do want
them to improve. If it's tough for me to be a
sports fan, it's got to be even tougher for a
Lions fan. But there's hope, guys. His name
is Matthew Stafford.

It's a little overdramatic and maybe premature, but I believe Stafford's got what it
takes to be a great quarterback in the
league. I believe Stafford had the best year
of all the rookie QBs drafted in the first
round (forget that Sanchez brought the Jets
deep into the playoffs—l could have handed
the ball off to Greene every play too). He
threw a comparable number of interceptions (he only started 10 games), but he was
also asked to throw a lot more than either
player (as necessitated by Detroit's tendenplaying from behind).

Furthermore, unlike Sanchez, Stafford
stepped onto a team without a strong running game to ease the transition into professional football, and with a leaky offensive line. In fact, Stafford's low tendency to
fumble (four fumbles this season) despite a
weak line is one of his most impressive
stats.
A young group of talented offensive
players (halfback Kevin Smith, tight end
Brandon Pettigrew, and wideout MEGATRON) will give Stafford the dangerous
weapons he needs to score points. Finally,
Stafford has shown flashes of a quality that
few QBs in the league own: the ability to

pain of a dislocated shoulder, Stafford
threw the game-winning, come-frombehind touchdown (in a 5 TD effort) to

for (after quite some time) with the New

games? Of course it would.
Someday they'll probably
hire me. At any rate, here
are a few of my observations about the two conference
championships.
Indianapolis Colts 30, New York Jets 17
Much has been made of the fact that Mark Sanchez has
become just the second rookie quarterback to take his team
to the. conference championship after Baltimore's Joe
Flacco did it last year. Now that Sanchez has finally completed his rookie year, it's time to rush judgment on both of
them by comparing how they each fared. Verdict: While the
Sanchize was undoubtedly more inconsistent than Flaccman (give it a chance) during his first regular season, the
tables turn significantly when looking at how each passer

fared in their inaugural playoff experience, each having

played in three games:
Sanchez (2009): 41/68, 539 yards, 4 TD, 2 INT, 92.7 passer
rating
Flacco (2008): 33/75, 437 yards, 1 TD, 3 INT, 50.8 passer
rating
Unlike most comparisons, this one comes with surprisingly few caveats. Both quarterbacks played with offenses
that emphasized running the football. Both had the benefit
of an aggressive, Rex Ryan-coached defense to keep them in
the game, and both played all three games on the road.
Given the similar set of circumstances, it's hard not to conclude that Sanchez was by far the better quarterback during his first playoff run. The regular season was a different
story, as Flacco was considered a focal point of the
Baltimore offense almost from the beginning, while the
Jets often treated Sanchez as a liability who was most valuable when handing off to his running backs. Nevertheless,
the poise and ability Sanchez showed in both the GQ
spread he did in May as well as throughout this postseason
should give Jets fans reason to be excited for next year.
With a little bit of luck concerning key players returning
from injuries, their biggest concern going into 2010 is finding a capable deep-threat receiver to either complement or
replace Braylon Edwards. Yesterday's loss was disappointing for New York, but the foundation is now there for them
to consistently challenge the Patriots for the division title,
and with the young quarterback and defense, time is most
certainly on their side.
Still, it's hard to look toward the future when you've
only just finished with the past, and while the performance
of Manning proved that the Colts deserved to be in the
Super Bowl, the Jets' left a lot to be desired, particularly in
areas of strength. The Jets' susceptibility to the run was
effectively masked last week due to the Chargers' pass-first
nature as well as their insistence on sticking with
LaDainian Tomlinson. This week, despite facing the lowest-ranked rushing offense in the league, the Jets had no
such luck, surrendering 101 yards on 24 carries. The Colts
became the first team to outrush the Jets since the Patriots
in Week 11, which was also the last time the Jets suffered a
loss by two scores.
While it's hard to be ashamed of getting burned by
Peyton Manning, the easiness with which he exploited
individual matchups against any Jet not named Darrelle
Revis reinforced New York's continuing need for another
cornerback to complement their All-Pro. To be fair, the Jets
suffered some injuries in the secondary during the game,
causing them to insert emergency defenders. (Remember
James Ihedigbo? Me neither, but he got significant playing
time.) Nevertheless, DB depth should be their second-highest priority for 2010.
Offensive MVP: Peyton Manning (26/39, 377 yards, 3
TD). Last week against Baltimore, Manning was content to
take what the defense gave him, running an offense that
was effective and efficient albeit devoid of big plays. This

16

week, an early eleven-point deficit caused Manning to open
it up more, which he did was shockingly little difficulty
against the best defense in football. He was still economical—four receivers had at least 3 receptions—but this time
the big plays were attempted and made, the highlight coming on a perfectly thrown 46-yard bomb to rookie Austin
Collie that would have earned 10s across the board were it
an event at the Winter Olympics (February 12 on NBC).
Defensive MVP: Kelvin Hayden (6 tackles, 2 passes
deflected, 1 INT). As a unit, the Indianapolis defense played
solid if unspectacular football, and held the best rushing
offense in the NFL to just 86 yards on the ground.
Cornerback Hayden played the most physical game of all
the DB's and essentially ended it by picking off Mark

New Orleans Saints 31, Minnesota Vikings 28
On Sunday, the Vikings rushed for about 100 more yards
than the Saints, passed for about 120 more, had 50 fewer
yards in penalties, controlled the ball for nine more minutes, converted twice as many first downs...and lost the
game. How is this possible? Turnovers, turnovers, and
more turnovers! Five turnovers, to be precise, three coming on fumbles and two coming on interceptions by Brett
Favre, whose 'gunslinger' mentality never seems quite as
endearing once he's blown a chance for his team to go to
the Super Bowl. More damning for the Vikings, in a threepoint loss, is where on the field these turnovers actually

occurred:
Fumble on Saints' 4-yard line
L
Interception on Saints' 34-yard line
2.
3.
Fumble on Vikings' 22-yard line
4.
Fumble on Saints' 10-yard line
5.
Interception on Saints' 38-yard line
Four out of those five turnovers came when Minnesota

was inside the New Orleans 40. Assuming they would only
have had time to attempt the game-winning field goal
before the fifth turnover, the Vikings left anywhere
between 12 and 24 points on the field due exclusively to
turnovers in Saints territory. Once again, they missed the
Super Bowl by three points. In overtime. Can I interest you
in some Timberwolves basketball, Vikings fans?
Say what you will about Brett Favre's fourth-quarter
interception that sent the game into overtime, and with
open field ahead of him, the decision to throw was a horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible one. But the true backbreaker of that drive and the only reason the Vikings
would have even considered running a pass occurred one
play earlier. This was when Minnesota had the ball on the
Saints' 33-yard line (from there, a game-winning field goal
would be about 50 yards, within their kicker Ryan
Longwell's range), when miscommunication on the sidelines resulted in a 12th player coming into the Minnesota
huddle. This resulted in a 5-yard loss, and put the ball at the
38, now outside of Longwell's range. Given everything that
followed, this may have been the costliest 5-yard penalty in
Vikings history for how it forced Minnesota's hand.
Offensive MVP: Drew Brees (17/31,197 yards, 3 TD). The
numbers are fairly pedestrian—for him. Yet, in a game
where the opposing team squandered a Super Bowl berth
due to turnovers, Brees' mistake-free day looks that much
more valuable now that his team has the NFC
Championship trophy to show for it.
Defensive MVP: Jonathan Vilma (5 tackles, 1 forced
fumble, 1 fumble recovered, 1 INT). It wasn't exactly a dominating performance by the New Orleans defensive unit,
but Vilma stands out here for his involvement in several
momentum-shifting plays.
