Prof. Bernard Saffran, 68, passes away
BY JULIE BAKER

ibakerl@swarthmore.edu

Beloved Swarthmore professor Bernard Saffran passed
away Monday morning due to a heart attack while visiting
family in Montreal. He was 68 years old. Saffran is survived
by his daughter, Jenny Saffran, and two grandchildren.
The Franklin and Betty Barr Professor of Economics,
Saffran was the longest-serving member of the
Swarthmore economics department, having taught for 37
years. Saffran lead a long and distinguished career as both
a professor and an economist, with accolades ranging from
undergraduate distinctions to national fellowships.

"Bernie was a source of wisdom in
our department. Whenever someone
had tough issues to decide, people
would always go talk to Bernie."
John Caskey
economics professor
Born May 13, 1936 to Eastern European immigrants,
Saffran grew up in Brooklyn with his father, who worked
as a union carpenter, and his mother and his two brothers.
As a child he spoke Yiddish at home and later learned
Hebrew. At the age of 20, Saffran graduated with honors
from the City College of New York and attended graduate
school at Johns Hopkins University. Finding himself stifled by the social environment, he left for the University of
Minnesota. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1963, he spent four
years teaching economics at the University of California,
Berkeley, where he was awarded the Distinguished
Teaching Award. He came to Swarthmore in 1967 where he
spent the remainder of his career, serving as chair of the
economics department from 1977-1983 and receiving the
Franklin and Betty Barr Professorship of Economics.
During his time at Swarthmore, Saffran played an integral role in shaping the economics department. For years

he taught a required honors seminar in economic theory
that was the capstone in many students' education. "He
was involved in the hiring of everyone who came after he
did. Bernie's opinion carried far more weight than any one
person in the department," economics professor John
Caskey said.
Caskey recalled his own experience as a prospective
Swarthmore professor. "When I came to interview, he had
a bad back and was not able to sit in on the regular interview. I went to meet with him separately in Parrish Hall. I
was told in advance that this was the most important meeting in the department," he said.
Economics professor Mark Kuperberg remembered a
similar experience. "Nowadays we take all our candidates
to nice restaurant. At the time I was hired, my dinner was
that Bernie took me down and talked with me at Sharpies
while I ate my spaghetti. This was my first real knowledge
of Bernie
he was the only one who wanted to eat with
me," he recalled.
Saffran's influence in the department extended well
beyond hiring and promotional issues. His advice was
sought on all matters, from personal finance to career decisions. "Bernie was a source of wisdom in our department.
Whenever someone had tough issues to decide, people
would always go talk to Bernie. It was almost a joke in the
department, 'What did Bernie say about this?' It was even
a joke in my house," said Caskey.
"My daughters had to clear everything with Bernie. My
older daughter brought her future husband down to meet
him; we couldn't go ahead with it until Bernie approved,"
Professor Rob HoUister, whose children grew up with
Saffran's, said.
Saffran's colleagues were particularly touched by
Saffran's desire to connect with both students and fellow
faculty members on a personal level. "He really was a contradiction; he would teach all this economics stuff, but he
would act at a human level that had nothing to do with economics. He would teach self-interest in his classes, but his
personal life was not about that. He knew all his students'
boyfriends and girlfriends. He would worry about their
personal lives, and the same thing with the professors,"
Kuperberg recounted.

Friends remember Robert 'Bobby' Berman '05
BY IVAN BOOTH E

iboothel@swarthmore.edu

Wearing his frayed, white Swarthmore
tennis cap backwards, Bobby Berman 'O5
seemed to leave a spirit of joyfulness wherever he went. On the night of Friday, Nov.
19, Berman left his friends saddened but
remembering his ability to inspire happiness. The cause of his death has not been
determined, according to the college

administration.

"Bobby had a fantastic sense of
humor," friend Jon Ehrenfeld 'O4 said. "I
can remember no time at which humor
was ever entirely absent from our conversation."
James Zvokel 'O4 called his sense of
humor "spectacular," and said that
"there's now one fewer great guy around."
"He was great at keeping things light,
even if he was depressed," Jordan Rosen
'O5 said.
Berman was a physics major who
arrived at Swarthmore in the fall of 2000.
He took some time off after his sophomore
year and was planning to graduate at the
end of this semester. In the spring of 2003,
he ran for Student Council co-president,
and he was an avid tennis player.
Physics professor Carl Grossman
taught Berman several times, including in
an electronics class normally done over

THE PHOENIX

the course of an entire year. Berman was
completing the course in a single semes-

ter.
In his

first year, Grossman said
Berman approached him after the final
exam. "He, amazingly, seemed to like the
final," Grossman said. "I [had] never had a
student tell me the final was cool."
"Bobby was a really bright kid," Rosen
said. "He saw things with more clarity
than other people."
"In many ways, the [physics and
astronomy] department

feels Bobby was
one of our own," Grossman said. "We'd

like to do something for his memory,
though I'm not sure what yet."
Despite Berman's dedication to his
work, however, his friends described him
as a social force at the college. "Bobby
Berman knew how to throw a party,"
Zvokel said.
"At no point did Bobby ever let his
work consume him, nor let it interfere
with his social life," Ehrenfeld said. "We
spent a lot of time in his room because he
would never kick us out to work."
"When I was hanging out with Bobby, I
didn't have to worry about anything
my
stress and concerns just melted away,"
Rosen said.
"My memory of Bobby is with his
group of friends," Grossman said, "at my
house for dinner, sitting around in the

back yard cooking food on the grill."
"He was always around to sit and talk
or help with physics homework," Rob Cox
'O2, who lived on Berman's hall during
Berman's first year, said. "As a frosh
Bobby naturally usurped the RA's role as
the social glue of our floor."
Two years later, Berman was still making a good impression on his other hallmates. "He was one of the few upperclassmen who would talk to freshmen," Jason
Lee 'O6 said. "Right away he came up to us;
he always made himself available."
Ehrenfeld said his memories of Bobby
were the "simple but enjoyable times we
had
playing video games in his room,
watching movies on the large screen in
LPAC, breaking into the [Kaori] Kitao
gallery to drink and going to truly abominable Paces parties."
One ofBerman's strengths seemed to be,
in Rosen's words, being "a pretty normal
guy." Berman "went to concerts, had parbut he was a really regties, drank beer
ular person, and he could make you feel
pretty decent no matter what," Rosen said.
"He liked to pull pranks a lot," Lee said.
"No one could be considered safe from his
wrath. But you always knew, deep down,
he would do anything for you."
On Sunday, Nov. 21, the college held a
memorial gathering for Berman in Bond.
"Bobby was friends with a lot of differ-

...

ent people," Lee said, "and you could see

all those different circles of people."
"I'm impressed the administration got
on its feet to do that," Rosen said, though
he was not entirely comfortable with the
way the campus community was informed
through a reserved-students e-mail.
"I was annoyed that they sent out the email so early without any information
about his death. I mean, they had to do it,
and it's hard for me to be mad about it. But
it was hard finding out about his death in
an e-mail," he said.
"At this point the official cause of death
is undetermined. It was initially reported
as an apparent suicide, but in the absence
of a note the medical examiner wants to
wait until toxicology tests are completed
in several weeks," Dean of the College Bob
Gross said in an e-mail to The Phoenix.
"There are no signs of a struggle or of
foul play," he said.
Berman's friends said he had had an
immense impact on their lives. "His loss
creates a void in the lives of everyone who
knew him," Ehrenfeld said. "Especially at
Swarthmore, someone who has the ability
not to take things too seriously is a rare
gift indeed."
"There's just nothing to say; there's
just a big emptiness," Cox said. "He treated everyone around him like family, and
I've never met anyone else like that."

A look back on the living wage
BY BENJAMIN BRADLOW
bbradlol@swarthmore.edu

The push for higher minimum staff
compensation and benefits will reach a
watershed moment when the Board of
Managers votes on a proposal on staff compensation that President Al Bloom will
present to them at their meeting this weekend.

The proposal includes an hourly minimum wage of $10.38 and the continuation of
the benefit bank, which would amount to
another 88 cents in hourly wages to be used
for health or childcare benefit packages.
The living wage campaign has often
exposed divisions within the various parts
of the Swarthmore community, as issues
central to the college's mission have come
into play, primarily the extent to which the

college is obliged to give its workers fair
compensation and what that actually

means.
The Swarthmore Living Wage and

Democracy Campaign, which is made up
mostly of students, but includes faculty and

staff, has been both a major catalyst for
action and a lightning rod for dissatisfaction with the process of creating a proposal
for staff compensation.

Bitterness and hope: A divisive campaign

"One of the reasons why there's

student

resentment against the campaign is that
the campaign is a strong presence on campus," campaign member Julia Smith 'O6
said.
For most people on campus, it has been
almost impossible to avoid the slew of rallies, panels and posters that have marked
much of the campaign's five-year history.
Smith said that the campaign has made

choices between uniting students behind a
living wage and achieving results. "On the
downside, we alienate people; on the

upside we won a raise from $6 (sic) to $9,"
she said, referring to the raise of the minimum wage from $6.66 to $9 passed by the
board in March 2002.
Campaign member Alix Gould-Werth 'O7
argued that the movement for a living
wage has been so polarizing because it
forces students to look at their basic priority systems.
"The living wage campaign pulls people
out of their comfort zones
I think people
...

feel very put on the spot," she said.

Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l

contended that the campaign may have
pursued unfair simplifications in framing
its case to the student body in order to

attract students to the campaign's cause. "I
have felt that at times students have been
seduced to a point of view by simplification," he said.
At a town hall meeting sponsored by
Student Council two weeks ago, uncertainty about student opinion on a living wage
took up a significant amount of the debate.
"I think there are a lot of people who
don't really have an opinion," Emily
Sydlowski 'O5 said at the meeting, as
reported in The Phoenix.
Smith argued that the current divisiveness of the campaign might work to create
more unity among students later.
"You tear the social unity we have now,
Being
and when it's rebuilt it's stronger
a community that challenges and reevaluates our values makes us stronger," she

said.
The campaign has had a sometimes-con-

tentious relationship with both the admin-

istration and the board, including walking
out of a meeting with Bloom and the Chair

of the Board of Managers Barbara Mather
'65 in September.
However, Eldridge described the rela-

Responding to concerns that, for some,
it may be hard to support a specific living
wage proposal without knowing where the
money for it would come from, Smith

economic justice even if we don't accept
the charge of us perpetrating an economic
injustice," he said.
"We've managed to demonstrate an
openness to listen that has allowed us to

fund it.

"We agree that [a living wage] is a priwe trust that the administration
will find the money for it," she said. "We
don't have line-by-line access to the budget."
Welsh said that a variety of elements,
including Bloom's staff compensation proposal, have yet to be factored into the budget committee's budget proposal for next
year. Other issues include anticipated rises

avoid the tension that other schools have
experienced," he said, referring to similar
living wage campaigns at other schools
that have included more belligerent direct
action such as sit-ins at the president's

office at Harvard University.
Bloom, while noting the campaign's
accomplishments, suggested that the campaign pursued too much political action.
"Maybe the political advocacy went a little
longer than was most helpful to develop
quickly a sense of common purpose ... But
that doesn't mean that the political advocacy didn't have an important role. It put this
issue on the map," he said.

in health insurance rates, higher utility
costs due to rising oil prices and depart-

mental requests for money.
The budget committee has had "preliminary discussions" about an extra raise in
tuition slightly above the usual annual
raise and an addition of five more students
than usual to next year's first-year class,
according to Welsh. Enrollment has risen
at about 1 percent per year, according to
Welsh.
She emphasized that such changes
would not be solely in response to the staff
compensation proposal. "It's not that the
living wage is the reason why we are conit's the whole
sidering a raise in tuition
mix of pressures," she said.

Finding the money
Another concern about the campaign
has been the generalities about where
funding for any compensation proposal
would come from.
Treasurer
According to
College
Suzanne Welsh, normally the college will
choose a program to be funded and the
budget committee will fit the program into
that year's budget. If the board votes to
approve the proposal, the budget committee will factor the costs into its final budget to be submitted to the board when it
meets in February.
"What we're doing at this point is putting [the proposal] into the budget
process," she said.

Five years of working to raise the wage
The living wage campaign has been one
of a few initiatives on campus focused on
staff compensation issues in the last five
years.

Fifty-year old Swat murder once again in spotlight
Robert Bechtel, now a professor, announced to his classes on Nov. 16 that he killed a classmate in his dorm

picked out Strozier as his first victim because he believed
him to be a leader of the pranksters." The article also said
that before giving up the shooting, Bechtel tried the door

Students entered Professor Robert Bechtel's psychology class at the University of Arizona on Nov. 16 expecting
to hear a lecture on children and the environment. What
they got instead was the recount of a murder.
Bechtel told his students that while serving as a
Wharton dorm proctor at Swarthmore in 1955, he shot
and killed Holmes Strozier, a 19-year-old sophomore at
the college.
Bechtel, who was a 22-year-old junior at the time,
claimed that bullying combined with previous psychological problems had triggered him to snap. "I think it was
because of my past," he said. "Anything that anyone did
at Swarthmore was certainly not worth killing for ... my
loaded past had loaded me."
According to a Jan. 12, 1955 New York Times article,
Bechtel had been a patient at Norristown State Hospital
for a week in January of 1950. During his stay, Bechtel
"had ideas of persecution and had been depressed, con-

Dean Bob Gross '62 said.
Bechtel said at the point he began spending more time
in the dorm enforcing the rules, "a whole series of things"
involving bullying began to happen to him.
Wharton residents put grease on his doorknob, broke
molding in the hall, set fire to his wastebasket, put things
in his laundry and taunted him in the hallway with choruses of "Bechtel will eat shit," according to Bechtel. At one
point, "they took my bed out on the quad and urinated on
it," he said.
Bechtel went home for winter break, but came back to
find the situation even worse. "When I came back, it
became even more severe it spread to the classroom," he
said. "It got to the point where I thought there was no

of a room across from Strozier's, but the door stuck and
that was when he fired off the additional shots.
The 1955 New York Times article reported that after
shooting Strozier, Bechtel "ran through the three-story
structure, firing the six bullets remaining in the clip of the
.22-caliber rifle, and trying to open the doors of other
rooms, all of which were locked."
After shooting Strozier, Bechtel said he went to a
friend's room and told him about the killing. "Everyone
was still asleep" on the hall, according to Bechtel.

pital during his stay said.
The murder sent Shockwaves through the Swarthmore
community in 1955, and recent publicity surrounding the
incident has once again brought awareness of the incident to the surface at Swarthmore, with Strozier's family,
and in the national media.

escape."

On Jan. 12, 1955, Bechtel took action. "I decided I was
going to go home and get my guns and wipe the whole
place out," he said. Bechtel drove to his home in Pottstown,
Pa. and came back with 200 shells, a rifle and a revolver.
Upon his return, Bechtel said he started walking down
the hallways in the dorm with a flashlight and went into a
room at the end of the hall. He saw someone who turned
out to be Strozier
in the bed, and fired one of his guns,
hitting Strozier and killing him instantly.
Bechtel said he did not remember aiming. "I just fired
then I had the sensation that was just
in that direction
like a hand had gripped my heart. I just gave up the whole
thing there," he said. He said he thenremembers emptying
a few more shots into the closet.

Bechtel said he was appointed proctor but spent most of
the time in the library until a group of students from the
dorm approached him during the fall 1954 semester, complaining of noise and other distractions from the other
inhabitants.

"I don't think [my mother] ever got over it," John
Strozier, Holmes' brother said of the killing. "When a
member of your family dies, you don't really get over it."
John said it was particularly jarring because his brother was not a tormentor, but rather a protector of Bechtel.

Barbara Ryan '59, a family friend, agreed. She said that

Students, faculty and alumni remember Saffran
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

From SAFFRAN, pg. 3
Saffran's renown extended well beyond the
Swarthmore community. A regular contributor to the
Journal of Economic Perspectives, Saffran gained international respect for his column, "Recommendations for
Further Reading."
"He's probably the most famous member of our department; everybody knew him. Whenever you would visit
another school, people would ask after him. He was
admired as almost a guru in the discipline and was a mentor for a whole generation of Swarthmore students who
went on to become distinguished economists," economics
professor Stephen Golub said. Saffran also served as a senior staff economist on President Nixon's Council of
Economic Advisors from 1971-1972.
Alumni from years ago remember Saffran fondly, many

of them staying in touch for years after taking his class.
"Bernie's mentorship was not limited to one's years at
Swarthmore. I continued to call him up for advice on the
most important job decisions in my life
not just in the
years after finishing my education, but more than 25 years
after graduation," Jeffery Frankel '74, professor of economics at the Kennedy School of Public Policy at Harvard,
said in an e-mail.
Many

students were struck by Saffran's complete lack

of intellectual arrogance. Martin Putnam '7l recalled a
public debate that was hosted at Swarthmore between a
prominent Marxist economist and Saffran, who was to be
representing the views of market economists. The Marxist
had delivered a deeply theoretical and obscure speech, to
which Saffran gave a meandering response. "Afterward,
Bernie came up to me and said, 'I didn't understand a word
he said, did you?' The thing that struck me about it was

that it was very typical of him; he was not trying to win an
argument. He was frustrated because he was not able to
engage in the debate," said Putnam.
Putnam's son, Daniel Putnam 'OB, has shared similarly
enlightening experiences. "A self-aware irony seemed to
run deep in his character. He joked that he chose his wife
because dating her minimized transportation costs.
Whenever we were talking about a consumer good, it was
always mango ice cream. He seemed like the kind of guy
who was very playful; a lot of his bantering with students
was at its heart a playful thing to do," he said.
Saffran is the second faculty member to pass away
while actively teaching at Swarthmore. This semester, he
had two sections of introductory economics which will

now be managed by other members of the economics
department. Details regarding a memorial service will be
provided as they become available.

As vote approaches, community examines living wage
According to Blair, the campaign began to meet regularly with staff to see what the major concerns for staff were.
"Wage was always one of the central concerns," he said.
"Many of the staff members
not only felt they were being
undervalued in terms of their wages, but also that they didn't have a way to express their concerns."
After a series of meetings with Bloom, along with faculty action on the issue, Bloom formed the Ad Hoc Committee,
which included students from the campaign, staff and faculty. After months of deliberation, the committee issued two
recommendations, with one receiving majority approval

would be whether that would be the right allocation of

for staff professional development."

raises to workers for merit.
Living Wage Campaign member Mariah Montgomery 'O4
said that the SCRC did not undertake a fundamental overhaul of the compensation system. "Their focus was never to
change the way compensation was done at Swarthmore,"
she said.
According to Young, the SCRC looked at a living wage at
the behest of Al Bloom. "We looked at the issue of the living
wage because we were asked to by Al Bloom," she said. "We
identified all the problems associated with implementing a
living wage.
Young described the current debate on campus as a mere
rehash of deliberations within the SCRC. "We're talking
about the same issues [now] that the committee talked
about three and a half years ago," she said.
Psychology professor Barry Schwartz, who headed the
Ad Hoc Committee on a Living Wage that issued a report in
February 2004, which had much more far-reaching recommendations than the SCRC, argued that the SCRC was too
influenced by cost issues to fully consider a living wage.
"Despite the fact that it claimed otherwise, I think the staff
committee was overly influenced by price tags," he said. "It
sort of closes down the discussion prematurely."
Young said that the discussion in the SCRC was no different than later debates on the issue. "Once costs became
an issue, the deliberations turned out to be exactly the
same," she said.
The Ad Hoc Committee was formed after Schwartz
brought a series of resolutions about the living wage to
members of the faculty. "It was a call for a kind of straw vote
expressing support for the idea," he said. According to

Schwartz, the vote won an "overwhelming majority."
The formation of the committee was "partly motivated
by the feeling that while the raises [from $6.66 to s9] were
substantial, they were inadequate," he said.
The committee included faculty, staff and students.
Schwartz argued that by not looking into the issue of
costs the committee could be open to many more ideas
about staff compensation. "We wanted to keep our sense of
what we wanted uncontaminated by what we thought was
achievable," he said.

From global to local: The living wage campaign
The Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy
Campaign began after a staff member spoke to a group
called Conscious Consumers, which former campaign member Sam Blair 'O2 described as having a "very global focus,"
about labor conditions at Swarthmore in the fall of 2000.
"It was a pretty eye-opening message," Blair said.

THE PHOENIX

...

Both proposals recommended a childcare benefit, health
coverage for workers and their families and plans to decompress wages, meaning that those with wages above the minimum would receive wage hikes as well. The majority proposal called for a minimum wage of $10.72 an hour, while
the minority proposed a wage of $13.89. Bloom's proposal of
$10.38 per hour plus 88 cents ofbenefit bank money per hour
amounts to the wage of $10.72 per hour when adding in infla-

tion.
Staff concerns: decompression
Despite the proposed raise of the minimum wage to
$10.36, staff are not in unanimous support of the proposal.
"Now that [low-wage staff] are really getting a big jump,
I feel there's a lot of people that I work with who don't
deserve it," Dining Services employee Kate Corbett said.
According to Corbett, at a meeting held by Bloom with
Dining Services staff in Sharpies two weeks ago, many
workers expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that lowwage workers would be receiving raises that it took other
workers much longer to receive. "There were a lot of Dining
Services people who were against it," she said.
Michelle Hartel, also a Dining Services employee, said
she supported Bloom's proposal but felt that it did not go far
enough. "I hope that when the board follows through with
this if they follow through with this that they will look
at other issues with the wage, like decompression," she
said.
When the minimum wage goes up, without a raise in
other wages, the wage scale becomes "compressed," as
workers of various experience and merit have more similar
hourly wages. "Decompression is the really expensive part

of this," Schwartz said.

According to Schwartz, by having 88 cents of the hourly
wage as part of the benefit bank, the difference between lowwage workers and workers with higher salaries will seem
bigger than it actually may be, alleviating some of the psychological problems associated with decompression.
"Psychologically, it's not going to feel to the staff that the

minimum wage is $1126," he said.
Schwartz said that the Ad Hoc Committee could not
expect decompression to be a part of any final proposal
because Bloom made it clear to the committee that such a
proposal would not be politically possible, though the committee did include decompression in its proposal. "As an
empirical fact, there were limits to what you could do to the
minimum wage without having to deal with decompression," he said. "We were boxed in by the fact that decom-

pression

was not going to happen."
Bloom felt that including decompression was an inappropriate allocation of resources. "In the [committee's] original proposal

this weekend, but noted that the proposal appears to have

general support among the different interest groups

on cam-

pus. "It's certainly encouraging that the campus seems to
have come together on the issue," she said.
Mather noted that debate on the issue has had a significant presence in previous board meetings. "The subject has

been discussed openly at at least the last two meetings, and
many different views have been expressed," she said. "The
board is not monolithic."

Eldridge argued that while the proposal will not affect

that many people, the symbolic value of a wage hike would
be large. "The number [of people getting the raise] is not the
point... The symbolism of it may be more powerful than its
actual ability to change the world," he said. According to
Young, about 30 people will receive actual wage raises if the
proposal receives approval.
Eldridge speculated that future boards will probably
consider wage hikes by comparing wages here to comparable markets, and that it is unlikely that such raises would
be pegged to inflation. He noted, however, the difficulties of
pegging the wage to a market comparison as the minimum
wage here is already much higher than other institutions in
the market.
Schwartz expressed disappointment that the board will
not consider a childcare benefit. "That's a big hole and I'm
disappointed that it is," he said. "[The view of the board] is
that there's something more voluntary about child care
than health care."
As the vote nears, and with all parties expecting the resolution to pass, a sense of finality seems to be setting in.
"The students have been absolutely inspirational in moving
me and the college to take this seriously," Bloom said.
Schwartz hoped that the campaign will view this as an
accomplishment. "People have to sometimes be willing to
accept victory," he said.
Blair said that he would consider donating money to the
school if the proposal passes.
"I didn't feel comfortable giving money while these
issues weren't being addressed," he said. "As an alum, it
makes me a lot more excited to consider donating to the college."

The campaign, while acknowledging their success, plans
to continue the fight for higher wages and benefits for staff
workers, including decompression and a child care benefit
package. The campaign will hold a rally on Saturday to both
celebrate their accomplishments and advocate for what it
perceives as the work still to be done, according to GouldWerth.
"My demand is that everyone is treated fairly and given
fair compensation," she said.

Board to vote on Bloom's wage proposal
constituents," Gross said.

BY REUBEN HEYMAN-KANTOR
rheymanl@swarthmore.edu

After years of planning, research and debate, the Board of
Managers will vote on President Al Bloom's proposal on the
implementation of a living wage this weekend. The discussion and vote will take place as part of the board's quarterly
meeting this Friday and Saturday. Athletics, Career
Services and the Capital Campaign will also be discussed at
the meeting.
Ifadopted, the proposal would create a minimum wage of
$10.38 an hour and increase healthcare benefits to the spouse
or partner of Swarthmore employees, essentially bringing
minimum hourly wages up to $1126, Vice President Maurice
Eldridge '6l said. The new package would also cover health
insurance for the children of employees who make less than
$l4 per hour under the Children's Health Insurance
Program, a program designed to cover the children of lowincome earners who do not qualify for Medicaid.
"I think because the process has been so extended and
thorough and there has been such an attempt to sample opinions and get some sense of a consensus on campus, I think
the board will respect that," Eldridge said. "I don't want to
make any predictions, but I think the president would not
take something forward that he didn't think could pass, so I
hope this is what the outcome will be."
Students and faculty have campaigned on campus for the
wage increase since 2000. In May of 2002, Bloom created the
Ad Hoc Committee on the Living Wage to determine what a
living wage would include. The committee also worked with
the administration to determine what would be financially
feasible for the college. The current proposal is the result of
the committee's work.
"I think that clearly this has been an issue pushed by students and faculty primarily, and in bringing us to this point
their role has been critical," Dean Bob Gross '62 said. "The
answers aren't as obvious as some people would make it out
to be. I think Al [Bloom] has done a terrific job in negotiating us to a solution that seems to be acceptable to most of the

"The financial officers of the college have put enormous
energy into running different economic models, trying to
find the approach that best meets the needs of the affected
staff members, while still preserving the financial integrity
of the college and taking into account its many
often conflicting
financial needs and obligations," Chair of the
Board's Working Group on the Living Wage Elizabeth
Scheuer '75 said in an e-mail. "Decent, smart, caring people
can disagree on this, for reasons based on either philosophy
or fiscal conservatism; but everyone who has been involved
in this issue has the best interests of the entire college community at heart."

While the Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy
Campaign is supporting Bloom's proposal, the organization
does not believe that the current proposal will fully meet the
needs of the college's lowest paid workers.
"I think it's a really important step towards something
that is in a meaningful sense a living wage. I think it's a victory for the whole college, but it's certainly less than what
the ad hoc committee came up with when they were determining what a living wage would be," campaign member
Julia Smith 'O6 said. "I think the most glaring shortcoming
of the proposal is the wage. We would have really liked to see
$1126, instead of $10.38. I think that would have brought
more people closer to meeting their basic needs."
While the current proposal would effectively bring the
wages of full time staff up to SIL26, part-time workers do not
receive these benefits, Smith said.
The campaign is planning a rally in Kohlberg courtyard
Saturday afternoon to "celebrate this victory without losing
sight of the work left to be done," according to the group's

Web site.
Scheuer commended the group for their hard work. "I
think the students should be extremely proud of their role in
this: raising the issue, doing lots of legwork to provide exten-

sive, useful information, and mobilizing people to really

examine the ramifications involved. Without student
activism and leadership, the college might have been slower

to move forward on this," she said.
On Saturday the board will also vote on managers for the
new year. The board will select at least four new members,
and perhaps as many as eight or nine, Eldridge said. "The
nominating committee has not finished its consideration of
the candidate, so it would be premature to disclose names,"
Chair of the Board of Managers Barbara Mather '65 said in
an e-mail. "[The nominating committee] will have until
Friday to finish its work, and then the names will go the
board on Saturday. The list contains some excellent candidates," she said.
On Friday, the Student Affairs Committee and Academic
Affairs Committee will meet jointly to hear a report from the

Ad Hoc Committee on Athletics. "[The report is] an update
of where we are in the [efforts] of strengthening the intercollegiate athletic program, post- decisions made about athletics in 2000," Eldridge said.
"We plan to introduce our new assistant athletic director,
Chrystin Chambers," Athletic Director Adam Hertz said.
"We've invited a couple of our newer coaches to introduce
them to the board and point them out as where we consider
the future of the athletic program at Swarthmore to be."

"We will also summarize the fall season and go over the
annual assessment that the physical education committee is

charged with writing each year," he added.
The open discussion section of Friday's meeting will

revolve around a report on the Career Services department.
"Our presentation will review the mission of Career
Services as well as current initiatives and directions for the
future," Director of Career Services Nancy Burkett said in
an e-mail.
The Board will also discuss the Capital Campaign, a
fundraising drive begun in 1999 to raise $230 million by Dec.
2006. Since September, the college has received two $2 million pledges, bringing the fund to just under $169 million.
"There is progress, but there remains the unrelenting, how
shall I put it, expenditure of energy to keep pushing ahead,"
Eldridge said. The campaign is making good progress,
according to Mather.

Hike in produce prices forces cuts
BY NICOLE KAST

nkastl@swarthmore.edu

Sky rocketing vegetable prices caused
by severe weather across the country have
led to cuts in Swarthmore's vegetable offerings at both Sharpies and Essie Mae's
snack bar, particularly with tomatoes and

romaine lettuce.
Until prices decrease, tomatoes and
romaine lettuce will be limited at Sharpies
and eliminated from the menu at Essie
Mae's completely. This year, tomatoes have
almost tripled in price from the standard
$lB-$24 a case to $6O a case. Similarly,
romaine lettuce has increased from $lB-22
to $4O a case this year.
Vegetable prices usually increase dur-

ing the off-season, according to Dining
Services Director Linda McDougall. The
holidays also tend to spur inflation in food
prices. But this year, hurricanes in the
South and severe weather conditions all
across the country have added to the problem. "There is just too much water, and the
plants can't grow," McDougall said.
According to a local produce inspector,
the situation is so bad that some produce
companies have lost all of their seedlings.
As a result, companies have to wait for a
batch of newly-planted tomato seeds to
grow.

McDougall said that the cuts in vegetables have nothing to do with budget cuts.
The college simply had not budgeted for the
huge inflation of prices. "We trying to be

good stewards of the money that we're
given," McDougall said.
Dining Services Cash Operations
Manager Scott Tutton said the college
would be wasting its money to pay such
high prices for tomatoes.
"No tomatoes are worth what they're
charging, whether you have the money

or

not," he said.
While the college is trying to limit the
use of tomatoes and romaine lettuce, students will still see these vegetables in the
dining options at Sharpies. Instead of offering tomatoes at four different locations,
however, students may only find raw tomatoes at one of the food bars.
"We go through an awful lot of tomatoes, and so now we're just trying to use
them more effectively," Dining Services
Administrator Janet Kassab said. To compensate, the staff is trying to incorporate
frozen tomatoes into more of the meal
options.
While the loss of tomatoes and romaine
lettuce is disappointing, many students
believe that the problem of inflated prices
is beyond the school's control. "It's too bad
that something as simple as tomatoes is
being so overpriced that you can't have it
at the cafeteria or Essie Mae's," Ranga

said.
Other students were upset with the cuts.
"I'm vegetarian, and I don't eat tofu or any
of the normal vegetarian foods, so tomatoes
are kind of a staple," Natalie Dunphy 'O5
said. "My parents were also upset about it

Tomatoes and romaine lettuce wiil not be served at salad bars until prices decrease.
when they found out. They wondered what
they were paying for if I couldn't even get
vegetables," Dunphy added.
According to a study done by the Heinz
Institude of Nutritional Sciences, tomatoes
are the second most consumed vegetable in
North America.
On average, every American consumes
upwards of 90 pounds of tomatoes per year,
according to the study.

Tutton said he hoped the college will not
be forced to cut any more vegetables in the
near future. According to Kassab, there is
the possibility that peppers may also be
limited if prices continue to rise.
These cuts are not permanent. Kassab
believes that prices may stabilize again
after Christmas, and once prices go down,
the limitations on both tomato and
romaine lettuce offerings will be lifted.

Students voice concerns about asbestos removal
Administrators say students are not at risk, were notified about abatement
BY ERIC MILES GLOVER
egloverl@swarthmore.edu

Students recently aired concerns to administrators
about asbestos abatement as part of the Parrish renovations, highlighting a lack of communication between project managers and students about the process.
"The students were not warned that asbestos abatement
was [occurring]," Kendra McDow 'O7, a Parrish Fourth resident, said.
McDow and her hallmates became aware of the abatement by accident. McDow was upset about the amount of
noise generated by the construction, so she searched the
Swarthmore Web site for "Parrish renovation" to find the
person she should contact about the complaint. The search
results included a link to the Parrish Hall Renovation
Committee Web site. Upon reading the Web site, McDow
learned that asbestos abatement was occurring in Parrish.

"Swarthmore cares about its staff and

the basic thrust of the college is to be

McDow and her hallmate, Khendi White 'O7, went to
Associate Dean for Student Life Myrt Westphal, who is a
member of the Parrish Hall Renovation Committee, with
their concerns about the abatement and about not being
notified of its occurrence.
"We went to Myrt Westphal and complained about
Parrish [lacking] heat and [a student lounge]," McDow
said. "More specifically, [we complained] about the lack of
communication between the Parrish [Hall] Renovation
Committee and students [about the asbestos abatement]."

Westphal directed White and McDow to Larry Schall
'75, vice president for the administration and chair of the
Parrish Hall Renovation Committee, who assured the two

students that the abatement was complete and that a subsequent letter would be drafted.
After meeting with Schall, McDow again searched the
Internet for more information about asbestos abatement.
She found a Web site about a similar project at Amherst,
which detailed how the college would "recognize, control
and mitigate asbestos hazards in or around academic facilities, dormitories and residential occupancies across campus." The Amherst site also notified students, staff and faculty about the asbestos to which they might have been

exposed.
Finding this more thorough Web site led McDow and
her hallmates to believe that Swarthmore was acting without regard for their safety and health. "Swarthmore had no
plan of action," she said.
But Environmental Health and Safety Officer Paul
Rodgers said plans were in place to ensure student safety

and that students were informed about the abatement over
the summer.
"The abatement started this past summer, [but] I've
been involved with [the project since] a year and a half
before that," says Rodgers. "I [oversee] the abatement
manager and the abatement team."
Before construction workers could renovate Parrish,
Rodgers had to examine the environmental health and
safety of the building this past summer. Accordingly, a certified licensed inspector inspected the building and found
asbestos in the pipe installation and structural steel. The
actual asbestos abatement included reinstalling Parrish
with foam and fiberglass. "We used a certified licensed
inspector to do inspection and a certified licensed remover
to do removal," Rodgers said.
Asbestos abatement is a serious matter, according to
Rodgers. The abatement team wore High Efficiency

Aware of the dangers of asbestos, Rodgers said precau-

tions had been taken to alert students and staff. "At the
beginning of the project, at the start of classes, [Project
Manager] Susan Sayer drafted a letter."
Students were sent letters but probably did not read the
letters because they were sent at the beginning of the year,
according to Rodgers. An informationalbreakfast was also
held Nov. 17.

Westphal understood the students' concerns. "We had
an open house in Parrish last year for the students and

staff, to talk about the project [with the Parrish Hall
Renovation Committee]." Nevertheless, Westphal said the
majority of students neither learned about the details of
the project nor attended the meeting.
"Communication is a tough thing around here,"
Westphal said. "I myself... skim through e-mails."
White and fellow Parrish Fourth resident Erika Dupree
'O7 expressed anger over what she viewed as a lack of
responsibility exhibited by the administration at
Swarthmore.
"It's just another grievance that I have with the college," Dupree

said.

After Bechtel admitted the killing

something like that," she said. She

described students as being "horrified," and said that many students
learned of the incident "by word of
mouth."
According to the Philadelphia
Evening Bulletin, Dean Everett Hunt
called a meeting of students in
Wharton the night after the murder.
Hunt told students of the event and
that he had spoken to the parents of
both Holmes and Bechtel.
"There was compassionate shock
and awe
an incredible shock
because it's the kind of thing that didn't happen at Swarthmore," Marian

Grade '56 said. "You do remember
those sorts of things because they just
don't happen in small communities.
No one could quite believe it."
John said the college community
was "very solicitous" after his brother's death, and many people sent letters to his family or came to the funeral. "The response of the college was as
good as it could be. The family never
had any feeling that the response of
Swarthmore was anything but great."
John said his family forgave
Bechtel, and though they did question
the college's hiring him as a proctor
considering his previous psychological problems, they did not pursue anything official to challenge the college.
"In their mind did they question it?
Yes. Everyone did. Did they do anything legal about it? No. They didn't
want to," he said.
College administrators at the time
said they were not aware of Bechtel
being unstable when they hired him as
a proctor. "We thought Bechtel could
handle it. He gave every appearance
he could handle it. But apparently a
change took place in him when he was
given some authority
perhaps too
much authority," Hunt was quoted as
saying in the Philadelphia Evening
Bulletin.
Louise Hodgson '56 took an ethics
course with Bechtel and remembered
him being a subject of ridicule. She
said that while most of the campus
was outraged, she had a somewhat different reaction. "I wasn't outraged, I
was very sad about what happened to
[Bechtel]
that he was so provoked to
do this. He was an ethical young man.
It was completely out of his character
as I knew him. He must've been thoroughly provoked," she said.
Despite coverage in Philadelphia
and other major metropolitan newspapers, the event was not covered by The
Phoenix or The Halcyon in 1955.
Ryan, who came to Swarthmore the
fall after the incident, said she never
heard administrators publicly discuss
the incident at weekly collections.
"If I hadn't had the family connection, I don't know if I'd have known
about it," she said. Gross and Vice
President Maurice Eldridge '6L both of
whom also matriculated within a few
years of the slaying, said they did not
hear about it while they were students. "The most amazing thing to me
about the story
is that it was not a
live story on campus among students,"
Eldridge said. "I heard not one whis...

After his arrest, Bechtel hired a
lawyer and was examined by a psychiatrist. The court ordered a sanity commission to be formed, which sentenced
him to go to Fairview State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane for the rest

of his life as incurably insane. Bechtel
stayed at Fairview for over four years,
at which point his lawyer got another
psychiatrist to reevaluate him and he

was released.
He was sent to country prison, and
was tried on Jan. 6,1960. He was found
not guilty by reason of insanity and
was released. At the trial, "the judge
read a letter from Mr. and Mrs.
Strozier saying they did not blame me

I really cried at that," Bechtel said.
After being released, Bechtel
received his bachelor's degree from
Susquehanna University and his Ph.D.
from the University of Kansas. He
worked
for
the
Environmental
and
Development
Research
Foundation. He began working as a
psychology professor at the University
of Arizona in 1976.
Bechtel is currently going to be featured in a documentary about bullying, to be released on the Discovery
Channel. Bechtel said he was not the
primary subject of the documentary,
but that his incident will be used "to
illustrate how many lives are affected
by just one case."
Director of News and Information
Tom Krattenmaker said the college
has recently received requests from
documentary makers about coming to
campus to shoot, but that "no official
decisions have been made."
"I don't know what will happen
with that... We weren't all that enthusiastic about that, frankly," Gross said.
Eldridge said the filmmakers
requested to come in January to get
some shots of the school. He said
Bechtel also requested to come back
for the 50th reunion of the class of 1955
in June. The college and the filmmakers are still discussing whether or not
this will happen, according to
Eldridge.
"It shouldn't even be our decision
alone. It would probably be the
reunion class that would be interested
in [making the decision]," Eldridge
...

said.
John said he was meeting with the
filmmakers today to discuss the film.
"I have a lot of pointed questions to
ask them," he said.
Bechtel approached University of
Arizona President Peter Likins and
other administrators before telling his
classes about the killing with the filmmakers present. "They gave us their
blessing for us to present this to the
students," Bechtel said.
Film crews were on hand when
Bechtel told his classes about the incident on Nov. 16. Bechtel said he told
his classes "so that everyone would

understand that this was not just an
academic exercise
there are real
people involved."
"It was an example of how the environment of the school is how the
school creates killing, suicides and
damaged personalities," Bechtel said.
He said the reaction was positive,

stories of bullying.

Since then, it has appeared in "surprisingly few" newspapers, according

"This is terrible. This is all wrong.
[Holmes] wasn't a bully. He wasn't a
tormentor," Ryan said.
John, who lives in Arizona, first
heard about the recent admission after
his wife heard a brief radio broadcast
about it. He described the Arizona
Daily Star story as "outrageous," saying "there couldn't have been a worse
kind of story written about it."
After e-mailing the paper and not
hearing back, John called the reporter
directly and spoke to him twice. He
said the reporter claimed that all the
statements and the quotes in the article were exact, and that he had not
written the headline.
John asked the paper to print a
retraction, but he "has yet to hear
back from them." He also said that he
has "not gotten very satisfactory
responses from the head of the [psychology] department" or other university officials.

"Neither Bechtel nor the president
of the university nor the provost nor
the head of the psychology department
... has asked the paper for a corrected

version of the story," Ryan said.
John's daughter, Jenifer Potts,
wrote a letter to the University of

them to contact the media about a

fund to combat
Sudan genocide

BY CHRISTINA TEMES
ctemesl@swarthmore.edu
As the genocide in Darfur, Sudan rages on,

Swarthmore students are raising money for the
Genocide Intervention Fund, a private fund that
would support peacekeepers in the region, as well
as any future costs for genocide intervention.
The fund, created by Mark Hanis 'O5 and
Andrew Sniderman 'O6, will provide financial
assistance to African Union troops who currently
lack the resources to carry out their mandate of
protecting civilians, securing delivery of humanitarian aid, and monitoring a tenuous cease-fire in
the region.

"These soldiers are willing and ready to go but
are unable to get to Sudan and be effective without
financial and logistical support," according to
"Creating a Genocide Intervention Fund," an informational pamphlet distributed by the organizers.
Organizers hope to raise $4 million by February
to meet the budget shortage of the AU, according to
the fund's outreach coordinator Cara Angelotta 'O5.

"Our only real yardstick for
measuring success will be
effecting real change on
the ground."
Andrew Sniderman 'O6
Hanis and Sniderman hope to secure an AU
endorsement by Friday and to set up a bank
account within the next two weeks. Because the
details have not been finalized as of press time,
organizers did not know how the money will be

spent, but emphasized that they will provide
donors with details of what their contributions will
purchase once more information is available.
"We do know it will be spent on helping the AU
stop genocide," Sniderman said. "We do know that
Colin Powell has said the single best short-term
way to contribute is by supporting the AU."
The fund has already received support from former senior officials, including the former secretary
to the National Security Council under Ronald
Reagan, seven-term Congressman Howard Wolpe
and Gayle Smith, a former director of African
affairs on the National Security Council and current senior fellow at the Center for American
Progress, according to Hanis.
To solicit enough funds, organizers are reaching
out to alumni, colleges and universities, faith communities, the media, as well as non-governmental
organization such as Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch. Other potential sources
include philanthropists such as George Soros and
Peter Lewis.
So far, Hanis and Sniderman have successfully
enlisted the college's help in their outreach efforts.
The Alumni Relations Office has agreed to include
information about the fund in its e-newsletter,
which is sent out to around 10,000 alumni. In addition, it has also put the fund's organizers in touch
with alumni in positions of power, according to

Hanis and Sniderman.
For the college community, Hanis has set up a
genocide information page on Blackboard, and
hopes students will help out in any way they can.
"We want and need their support," he said.
"Our only real yardstick for measuring success
will be effecting real change on the ground,"

Sniderman added.

BY BEN

boldfiel@swarthmore.edu

With the Nov. 2 presidential election
debates over Social Affairs
Committee funding for political events, as
well as the escalation of issues surroundinciting

ing the living wage, Student Council has

been kept busy this semester. Both issues
seem to be coming to a close as the semester ends, with the rewriting of SAC's
bylaws nearly complete and a potential
decision on the living wage by the Board of
Managers at their meeting this weekend.
The SAC debate began last spring when
the College Democrats were denied SAC
funding for parties that centered around

viewings of the Democratic primaries,
according to Campus Life Representative
Heidi Fieselmann 'O6.
The SAC bylaw that prohibited the com-

mittee from sponsoring these parties,
which states that the committee cannot
fund politically-oriented events, has been

under careful examination by Student
Council since then.
This issue was especially pertinent earlier in the semester when the Swarthmore
Voter Registration Coalition sought SAC
funding for a viewing of the first presidential debate, which was ultimately funded
by the council and the President's Office.
"Student Council has been working very
closely with SAC on rewriting the bylaw so
it's more open and inclusive," Fieselmann
said.

to Student Council CoPresident Andrew Gisselquist 'O5, the long
debate is coming to a conclusion. "We are
finally nearing the end of this long process
by working with SAC to finalize a reworkAccording

increase of staff wages, which will be the
defining topic on the table at this weekend's board meeting.
Gisselquist said that the council's goal
was to gauge student opinion of the issue in
a questionnaire. However, because the
council wanted to wait for the presentation
of President Bloom's proposal to the faculty and the resulting changes to his proposal before distributing the questionnaire, it
sponsored a town hall on the issue instead.
"As far as I know this discussion was the
first in at least a couple years in which
both sides of student opinion were well represented," Gisselquist said.
Additionally this semester, the council
attained its goal of having a meeting with
Haverford's Student Council. According to
Financial Policy Representative Bryan
Lantz 'O6, this has been a wish of the council for some time.
"Student Council had been looking for a
way to increase Tri-Co relations for years,"
he said. Among the results of the meeting
was SAC's decision to include Haverford
activities in its "weekend activities"
reserved-students e-mails. "We wanted to
make it easier to take advantage of the
social aspects of the Tri-Co relationship
that are so often neglected," said
Gisselquist.

Swarthmore has recently received

two alumni gifts of $2 million, each

as part
Swarthmore campaign.
The first gift, which will go
toward finishing the New Dorm, was
provided by a donor who wishes to
remain anonymous.
"The donor specifically requested
that students have a contest though
Student Council to name the dorm,"
Dan West, vice president for alumni,
development and public relations,

said.

Bruce Gould '54, a retired cardiol-

who lives in the Philadelphia
area, pledged the second gift, which
will be used to endow a professorship, according to West.
Gould did not specify to what
ogist

field the professorship should be
added, and the college is still deciding which position to endow, according to Director of Planned Giving Ted
Mills.
"Often what we do is instead of
adding additional faculty, which we
can support out of our regular budget, we endow a faculty chair. This
means that there is a dedicated
stream of revenue to support this
chair. In some cases we add faculty,"
Mills said.

the pledge of $2 million is paid. West

said that alumni typically pay their
pledges over a period of five years.

Gould has continued to be
involved in the Swarthmore community in a variety of ways since he left
the school. He went to medical school
at the University of Pennsylvania
and has stayed in the area since then.
"He has taken classes on campus
and developed an interest in the
Chinese language and culture," Mills
said. "He recently went to Tibet with
a tour group."
Gould used to be in charge of
alumni connections in Philadelphia.
He organized museum trips and dinners. Mills said that Gould was also
instrumental in planning his class's
50th reunion this year.
"He's done so much service for the
college," Mills said. "He spent hours
preparing for the reunion. Everyone
in his class was so delighted with it."
These pledges are part of the
Meaning of Swarthmore campaign,
which is geared to raise $230.4 million by December of 2006. The campaign, which began in July of 1999,
has already raised $l7O million,
according to West.
This money will serve a variety of
purposes, including endowing new
faculty chairs
and supporting
research and technology, financial
aid, and construction projects such as
the new Science Center, the Parrish
Hall renovation and the New Dorm.

Donations to the campaign can be

restricted or unrestricted for use
toward a particular purpose. The two
recent gifts were both restricted. "We
do get unrestricted pledges, but I
would say that the majority are
restricted," West said. "The most popular restricted pledge is to support
scholarships and financial aid." West
is cautiously optimistic that, with
hard work, the college will meet its
fundraising goals by 2006.
Anonymous

donations, like the

first gift of $2 million, are uncommon, but do occur.

"Some people don't like to draw

attention to themselves and think it
is more admirable to give without
getting credit. Some very wealthy

people don't want their names listed
because they don't want other solicitations from other charitable institutions. It's a very personal decision,
and we respect people's wishes. It can
help us to use the donor's name,
though, because it might encourage
other people who knew them to give
too," West said.
Since the campaign has started,
the college has received one $35 million pledge, a $lO million pledge, four
$5 million pledges and 17 $1 million

pledges.

The campaign has also received
133 pledges for $25,000. "We don't
often get pledges this large, but we do
depend on them to meet our goals,"
West said.

Lantz is also hoping that SC will establish a 24-hour study space for students in
the future. "We've had a lot of requests
from students for a place to study that has
computers and is open 24 hours," he said.
"That'll be on the table in the spring."
Lantz and Gisselquist, whose SC terms
extend into next semester, look forward to
progress with these issues in the future
with next semester's council.

NEWS IN BRIEF
Voice recognition months away from repair
Information Technology Services is currently
examining the college phone system's voice recognition system. Currently, when students try to use
the system, it does not connect them to whom
they are trying to call.
The system, which connects callers on campus,
not by dialing a number but by recognizing the
spoken names of people and departments, is five
years old, according to Mark Dumic, ITS networking and systems manager. The recent trouble,
according to Dumic, is mostly due to the increasing number of people using cell phones, which
have poorer connections than campus phones, to
connect to the system.
Because of its age, the system is no longer supported by the manufacturer, according to Dumic.
The problem will be fixed in 12-18 months, when
the college will install a completely new phone system, Dumic said.
Until then, Dumic will try to work out the system's kinks. "I haven't had many complaints," he
said, "but it's on the list of things to fix." Two
weeks ago, he deleted a number of unused logs
on the system that had been interrupting disk
space.
Dumic advises that students use the voice
recognition system on campus phones only. "Every
time I use it on my office phone, it works," he said.
But students have still had complaints. In fact,
the system has failed Nick Groh 'O7 so many times
that he avoids it entirely. "It never works anymore,
so I don't use it," he said.
Phoebe Vacharat 'O6 recalled being left in the
cold outside of Pittenger when she was unable to
call a friend inside to let her in the building. "I
haven't used it since," she said.

Dorm construction continues past deadline

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY RICHARD MUI
rmuil@swarthmore.edu

Construction in Parrish and the New
Dorm has continued throughout the fall
semester and will continue to progress
through the remainder of the academic
year.
The Parrish renovations have recently
caused the temporary relocation of many
offices. Some offices and a number of development services formerly located in
Parrish, such as the Bursar's office, have
been temporarily relocated to the Science
Center for the same reason. Career

Services was recently temporarily relocated to the west wing of Parrish. The next
impending move will relocate the office of
Dean Bob Gross '62 to Room 140, the previous location of Career Services, Project
Manager Susan Sayer said. According to
Sayer, the shuffling of offices in Parrish
has occurred in the most logical manner

possible, relocating offices to convenient
locations while keeping the number of
moves to a minimum.
A bearing wall that had been erected to
isolate the noise and dust in the center portion of the building, where most of the
heavy construction

has been occurring,
from the rest of Parrish was recently
removed. Substantial construction still
remains undone, including structural modifications as well as the installment of
mechanical heating and cooling systems.
The most critical renovations will include

two new fire stairs and an elevator that
will reaching the uppermost level of
Parrish, making the building compliant
with the accessibility standards of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
"We've been very grateful that the students and staff occupying the building have
been very understanding of the noise and
construction," said Sayer.
The renovation of Parrish began last
June and is, for the most part, progressing
as scheduled. The renovation schedule has

been modified to allow construction on student rooms to occur over the summer. Last

summer, the women's wing in Parrish

received updated electrical services, and
the men's wing will receive the same renovations next summer. Both wings will be
equipped with new sprinkler pipes that
will not be activated until the entire project
is finished.
"Because it's an old building, there have
been many unforeseen conditions that

were not anticipated, including floor
boards that needed replacement, and excavating soft soil and rock where it wasn't
expected to be," Sayer said. Another unexpected concern was protecting telecommunications equipment in the lower levels of
Parrish that may have been vulnerable to
damage because of their close proximity to
construction sites.
Construction work on the New Dorm is
still continuing as well. The construction
started in June of 2003 and was expected to
continue until last August, though con-

Wage wars

art

by

eliza

blair

This weekend, the Swarthmore College Board of
Managers will finally vote on and probably pass a farreaching proposal to raise the minimum wage at

Swarthmore to $10.38 and extend health care benefits, a
long-awaited victory for the Swarthmore Living Wage
and Democracy Campaign.

on our own editorial board remains
in some cases bitterly divided
over the living wage issue itself, none of us deny that the living wage
campaign has been born of the best impulses of idealistic
college students, the willingness to look for unjust suffering in one's own community and directly correct it.
At the same time, living wage campaign members
have expressed the worst flaws ofidealists
unwavering
confidence in one's own correctness, willingness to disregard or demonize one's political opponents, and hardheaded rejection of nuance and compromise.
There is and always has been a strong contingent of
liberal, conservative or other
students
who have
strongly questioned the ideals of the living wage campaign. Unfortunately, their representation in opinion
polls has never been reflected by an equal representation
in organized lobbying of the administration or in the volume of text generated in campus publications or handbills in their support.
Living wage opponents themselves bear some responsibility for failing to marshal the same political will as the
SLWDC. On the other hand, the campaign has used political tactics based on Swarthmore's own cultural biases to
help stifle dissent.
We have repeatedly heard assertions that those who
oppose the living wage proposal do so out of hidden
racism or sexism, or speak out of purely selfish motives.
Arguments against the practicality of a living wage proposal on economic grounds have been mostly talked
around and ignored. Rather than targeting and directly
debating their opponents, the campaigners preferred to
use rallies, petitions and open letters to generate publicity and a perception of widespread support.
The living wage campaign scored political victories
through endless repetition; for instance, the volume of literature they published eventually made the value-laden
term "living wage" automatically refer to their specific
wage increase proposal in campus discourse, to the point
that SLWDC and "the living wage" are now often synonyms. SLWDC has not spent much time out-researching
and out-arguing their opponents, but instead out-organized them and outspent them in time and energy.
As the inclusion of "democracy" in SLWDC's name
implies, this is how interest-group politics routinely
operates in democratic government, but we feel this is
less appropriate for small communities like Swarthmore,
especially when they claim allegiance to a long tradition
of inclusiveness and consensus.
We continue to encounter students and staff members
alike who feel skeptical about the living wage proposal
but feel uncomfortable speaking out because of a strong
perception that supporting SLWDC was what "good
Swatties" did. Even now there are disaffected opponents
who feel that in all the time up to the issue being brought
to the board, they still haven't been able to air their objections on an even playing field.
Though our own opinions are divided about the living
wage, we all feel the proposal has some merit. However,
we've never felt the campaign or others
Student
Council or the administration
have truly opened dialogue on this issue to those who dissented for reasons
moral or practical, or to those who favored a compromise
solution. Instead, the campaign has pushed for its goals
through focused political attacks, media manipulation
and peer pressure.
We understand the desire to absolutely commit to the
realization of an ideal, but, important as the living wage
issue might be, it should not be sacrificed to all other
ideals. This conflict has called into question
Swarthmore's sense of unity, its commitment to reasoned, respectful dialogue and compromise between
opposing political sides. Instead, a proposal has been
pushed through over the heads of objectors, in the name
of expediency and immediate moral imperative. We question whether it had to be that way.

dodged the bandwagon, and for good reason. By keeping Dinin
Services under the college umbrella we retain important con
trol over staff wages and working conditions. What's more, w
make it possible to ask that Dining Services work not just to ful
fill an inflexible contract as cheaply as possible, but rather t
provide us, the students, with the best experience it can.
Lately, though, it hasn't been living up to that bargain.
Let's begin with tomatoes, because they are just about th
only vitamin C I get and if I come down with scurvy I'm goin
to be very unhappy.
First, the situation. This time of year, Florida is usuall
responsible for providing around 80 percent of the country'
tomatoes. Four hurricanes and their associated flooding devas
tated the Floridian supply, and an insect infestation of th
Mexican crop compounded the problem.
So tomatoes exist, but they're expensive up to four time
more than usual. They're also not quite as red or as tasty as nor
mal. But so what? Tomatoes are profoundly important, espe
cially at a school where so many people have working tast
buds. Moreover, I'm going to go out on a limb and argue tha
tomatoes are more important than, say, vegan chili or quiche,

mean, come on.

At Essie Mae's, why not charge us thirty cents extra for
few slices of tomato on our sandwiches? I know I'd pay. A vio
lation of Quaker egalitarianism, you say? Then the first thing t
go should be three-dollar energy drinks
or, for that matter
any price variation at all. Pay-per-tomato seems an obviou
solution, and the management of Essie Mae's, which has don
an admirable job otherwise this year, deserves to feel the heat
Ironically, if Dining Services were an outside contractor w
would probably still have tomatoes to eat. Large companies
such as fast food chains, established restaurants and food con
tractors, have proven the most willing to absorb the high pric
of tomatoes for the sake of their customers. If one of the reason
we don't outsource Dining Services is the quality of service w
expect, then something has gone awry.
But tomatoes aren't all. Two weeks ago, the Dining Service
ruling elite decreed by posted edict that flyers and signs are n
longer to be affixed to the windows or wooden railings i
Sharpies.
To echo the marsupial who said it so well: WTF, mate?
The windows and railings in Sharpies are the most visibl
real estate for signs on campus along with the wooden door

Signs, to state the obvious, are critically important for studen
life and community on campus. Until the administration builc
large, free-standing, covered bulletin boards in the main thor
oughfares on campus (as it should) we cannot let Dinin
Services disallow student signs. The inside bulletin boards in
Sharpies just are not large or visible enough, and the general
ban on signs on windows in academic buildings should no
extend to Sharpies or any student life building.
When I confronted the Sharpies autocracy about the ban,
was told that signs made Sharpies appear shabby, which, eve
if true, is a fact stunningly less weighty than the role those sign
play in facilitating studentactivities. I was also toldthat remov
ing tape from the windows was too difficult. This, again, is prob
ably not such a fearsome problem, because students take dow
old signs when posting new ones, but it is also just profoundl
irrelevant when compared to the necessity of visible sign space
I haven't talked to a single student who has not echoed thes
sentiments on both issues, and the onus is jointly on Studen
Council and the Deans' Office to convey the college's wishes t

Living wage a matter of values
BY AL BRADBURY
abradbul@swarthmore.edu
I was among the students who attended Student
Council's town hall meeting to discuss the living wage
("Faculty choose staff compensation proposal," Nov. 18,
well, that we had begun to grapple
pg. 3). I left feeling
with exactly the vital issues at stake here. But that there
was more to be said about them, too.
A number of students argued that the college's prito train its students
mary responsibility is to educate
to think deeply, morally, creatively in all future endeavors. As much as possible, they suggested, the school
should spend money only to further this educational purnot to pursue political goals about which stupose
dents, parents and donors may disagree.
This argument raises an important question. Can a
responsible institution focus only on the mission it
frames for itself? What about the other impacts of its
actions? True, Swarthmore College is an academic institution. But Swarthmore can't be an educator withoutalso
being an employer and a community. So what kind of
employer should we be? What kind of community are we?
Some at the town hall suggested that the college could

choose an apolitical route, a neutral stance, by paying a
market-determined wage. These students are certainly
not alone

many people in the United States perceive

the so-called free market as ideologically neutral. But, as
the persistent structures of inequality in this country

demonstrate, the market system is in fact inextricably
bound up with a particular social order.

Why is it that the market dictates such drastically
higher pay for administrators than it does for

Environmental Services staff? Why does the market say
that faculty should be paid so much more than Dining
Services staff? Even accepting the argument that a certain amount compensates for the costs of education, we
can't really explain the discrepancy until we look at it as

preserving longstanding hierarchies of class. And
indeed, the market pays least for care work, cooking and
both at
cleaning, work done disproportionately
by
Swarthmore and in the United States as a whole

December 2, 2004

women and people of color.
Isn't the market wage level really just another way of
assigning more value to certain kinds of work than to
others? Doesn't the norm of the market wage mandate
our conformity to hierarchies we know to be racist and
sexist? As it turns out, the college
like every employer
finds itself in the position of choosing whether to contest or to re-inscribe these structural inequalities.
Neither choice, you may be sure, is ideologically neutral.
Of course, the choice is not really a simple binary.
Between the hierarchical market wage system and the
radically egalitarian wage system lies a broad terrain of
compromise. But how to navigate it? How can a single
institution feasibly and responsibly cope with what is,

after all, a problem much broader than one employer?
The living wage movement proposes one clear and
compelling framing principle: that any full-time job
should pay enough to meet basic needs for oneself and
one's family. In a way, it is a very moderate approach to
the problem of structural injustice. No drastic redistribution of wealth; no elimination of all hierarchy; just the
declaration that this much respect, at least, the institu-

tion owes to all the people whose work makes the college

possible.

Swarthmore has already taken a step towards the living wage principle by raising its minimum wage above

market. This Saturday, Dec. 4, as students, faculty, staff
and members of our broader local community rally outside, the Board of Managers will consider taking a further step, one unanimously recommended by the faculty:
raising the minimum to $10.38 per hour and increasing
the college's contribution to health care.
This is not the last word on the issue. We must all
continue to engage in vital conversations about how
principle translates into ethical, feasible policy. But it it
is a momentous occasion. Noted historian Paul Gaston
'52 has written, "The Living Wage Movement has the
potential to become the civil rights movement of the
early 21st century." This Saturday, Swarthmore has the
opportunity to set an example that will resonate on campuses around the country. Let's show our community's
priorities.

of this past Student Council
election. Though some won
by landslides and some

barely surpassed the (still
too large) margin of error,
most neglected to reference
a single concrete goal in
their platforms. They spoke

of vague, general goals
whose success or failure
will be difficult to measure.
The hoUow platforms on
RANDY GOLDSTEIN which individuals were
elected, however, are of little concern to me. Rarely

have Student Council members made good on their
pre-election promises in the past. In three and a half years at
Swarthmore, I have seen Student Council make little difference in the day-to-day lives of students. My concern is not
with the membership of the Student Council. I believe there
are a handful of Swatties interested in doing a good job, but
beyond that, participation is simply a resume-enhancing
opportunity. Still, I believe that, by looking largely at the
platforms of the losers of this past election, there is an
achievable agenda that would positively impact student life.
Food: I had the misfortune of being on campus for part of

the Bubble

THE PHOENIX

Thanksgiving break, during which Sharpies was open for
unreasonably specific hours. Very few people, given a
choice, will elect to eat dinnerbetween 4:00 and 5:00. Further,
the quality offood available during Thanksgiving break was
atrocious. The kaiser rolls were rock hard (so making a

sandwich for later was an unappetizing option), the fruit
was rancid, and the overall selection was simply poor.
Aside from Dining Services' inability to adequately
accommodate students' needs over Thanksgiving break, I
believe that there should be a publicly available framework
for the pricing of food in Essie Mae's. For example, Essie
Mae's has begun selling large energy drinks for $3.00. These
beverages are available wholesale at around SLOO per can.

The Co-Op, which is certainly not giving its products away,
sells the drinks for $2.00. So why do they cost $3.00 at Essie
Mae's? I sent an e-mail to food@swarthmore.edu nearly two
weeks ago regarding this, but have yet to receive a response.
If my voice is useless in this matter, maybe Student Council
can make my concerns heard.
Parking: It is wrong to ticket students who live in Mary
Lyon or Strath Haven and must occasionally drive to campus during the day. With a lack of reliable van service as
winter approaches, we cannot expect students with cars to
instead walk 20 minutes each way. Further, I do not understand why on-campus parking is a problem at all. In striving
to make campus life as equitable as possible, Swarthmore
ensures that virtually no additional expenses are incurred
beyond tuition, room, board and activity fees. The fact that
some students own cars and some do not, however, is not

price at which Swarthmore will be able to satisfy all student
parking demand. To say that wealthy car owners then have
an advantage over less wealthy car owners ignores the fact
that most students are not car owners at all. These parking
fees could be used to ensure reliable shuttle services for the

less fortunate residents of Mary Lyon and Strath Haven.
Residence hall access: Student Council needs to pursue
the installation of card-activated locks on residence halls.
Under this system, students could receive access to all dorms
and lost cards could be immediately deactivated. This would
make them useless to anyone who might find or steal them
and thus hamper intruders' ability to gain access to residence halls. Many, if not most, other schools do this already.
Armed men in search of drugs gained access to Worth this

semester. What visible changes in security have occurred?
These are just three of the many issues that could be
addressed in the coming year. I applaud Student Council for
finally posting minutes on their Web site, though the most
recent available minutes are still more than two months old.
If we are ever to recognize the work that Student Council
does, these minutes must be made available in a timelier
manner. Why not amend the Student Constitution to ensure
this practice? I am hopeful that this, in tandem with the pursuit of the above goals, will result in a Student Council
whose efficacy can be publicly recognized.

extinct.
That's why I'm confused
about why George W. Bush
does not believe in global
warming. In February, the

commissioned a
research team to investigate global climate change. They came
up with the same petrifying predictions we've been trying not
Pentagon

to hear for years: drastic temperature increases, melting ice
caps, ecosystem changes and extinctions, doomed agriculture,
massive political and social instability as the habitable world
becomes smaller and smaller. Even the defense department
was scared and urged the administration to consider policies
like caps on gas mileage and industry incentives to use renewable technologies. Yet the Bush Administration ignored the
report and dropped the EPA a few nice little hints that they
should do the same, leading the Environmental Protection
Agency to sign the prescription for environmental destruction.
Clearly, talking about the future survival of the human race
is not a winning plan of attack. (Bush and fans aren't much in
favor of survival these days.) So here's a new reason to work
for clean energy policies. A new report released by the Union
of Concerned Scientists, the United Steel Workers, the Sierra
Club and the Service Employees International Union shows
that cleaning up our energy policies would create L 4 million
new jobs in America, due to high-tech renewable energy technologies. Since most American manufacturers that produce
small cars are in the United States while SUV manufacturing
tends to take place abroad, focusing on fuel efficiency would
spur job growth right here, where all of us (blue and red) want
it. Also, jobs based on renewable technologies would be oodles
more secure than current energy sector jobs, because they
wouldn't fluctuate based on depleting sources, oil markets and
Middle Eastern conflict. (Any industry dependent on political
stability in the Fertile Crescent is guaranteed more angst than
a seventh-grade lit mag.)
gas costs 20 percent more
And it's about consumers, too
than it did two years ago. That's 20 percent that drivers could
have been spending on their children's education, hospital
costs and gas station candy. Clearly, decreasing our oil
dependence and upping our fuel efficiency would make everyone happy (besides, perhaps, Dick and George). Plus, going
greener would create more energy-efficient homes and appliances, boosting the average savings account by $1,275 by 2025.
So moving toward cleaner energy policies would save
humans and even put some extra cash in those humans' pockets. It would also make us some friends, of which we
Americans are in dire need these days. Last Thursday, Russia
ratified the Kyoto Protocol, making the worldwide agreement
to curb carbon dioxide emissions a reality. The only countries
that are still holding out against the Protocol are Monaco,
Australia, Lichtenstein and the United States. Yep, for yet
another reason, the world is pissed
especially since we
account for 36 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.
Why not give in on this one, especially since reforming our
energy policies would benefit us just as much as it would the
rest of the world?
Combating global warming is not just a leftist-progressivepost-pseudo-hippie-tree-licking-vegan-raw-food-eating

cause

anymore. McCain, Lieberman and other congressional übermoderates are currently pushing a major revamp of U.S. energy policy, working toward decreasing C0 2 emissions before it's
too late. McCain convened a summit last week to push his
Climate Stewardship Act, which would enact modest curbs on
greenhouse emissions. Bush replied that he favored "voluntary" means of reducing C0 2 waste. Hmmm. Well. Until the oil
industry decides to voluntarily jump off a cliff, we can push for
energy efficiency, caps on emissions and industry incentives
for using renewable technology.
Let's come together on one cause that we can all smile
about. Survival, money, allies, nice-smelling streets
not to
mention the preservation of Arctic friends like polar bears,
walruses, hares and phytoplankton. What have we got to lose?

jhausmal@swarthmore.edu
Before I took Introduction to Economics with

Professor Saffran, I had the typical prejudices against
economics. I suspected that economics might be no
more than first derivatives that told one something one
already knew about the world. Worse, I feared that
Econ L though of little use, would mean late nights in
McCabe pouring over graphs of supply and demand.
Saffran quickly dispelled my prejudices. In his
course, learning supply and demand was not about
memorizing graphs and equations, it was about understanding the unintended consequences of usury laws,
minimum wages and
rent control. The uninconsequences

Saffran loved to talk with students. He would come
to Kohlberg 226 before class and chat with us; he was
interested in everything
our academics, our sports,
our sleep habits, even our food. Later, after I became his
his TA and RA, Saffran would rarely let me leave his
office without asking me a question about my 19-yearold brother. ("Is he still taking the Chinatown bus to
New York? If I were his parent, I'd pay for the train.").
It was wonderful to answer Saffran's questions; he
made me feel that I was an equal, someone he could
learn something from, even someone who could give
him advice. Once Saffran asked me to call him at home;
he had a cold and wanted my

Saffran combined anecdotes with a passion for the
deep results and conflicts in economics. I vividly
remember how excited he was when he drew the graph
of perfect competition. Suddenly profits weren't evil,
they were the signal that told firms to enter a market.

Saffran's course was about the tension between this
invisible hand and pervasive market failures, between
optimal outcomes produced by individual self-interest
and suboptimal outcomes caused by externalities or
prisoners' dilemmas. To theoretical arguments, Saffran
added 45 years of experience. Pure theory says monopoly profits are bad profits, but we were told to remember AT&T's Bell Labs. Monopoly profits allowed AT&T

his editor; Saffran fought a
war against the convention that, in blatant violation of
logic, dictates that periods be placed inside quotation

marks.
Saffran treated me with tremendous thoughtfulness
and generosity. Last summer, when I worked in the economics research center, he would constantly stop by to
ask me about the latest results of my research.
Occasionally, he gave me passes to the Swarthmore
swim club. And he was concerned that I use them.
Once, when we had arranged to meet, he wrote me,
"Given the weather forecast, you might prefer the
pool." He joked that "my personal utility is maximized
by meeting tomorrow, but, depending on your preferences, the utilitarian optimum may well be not to

meet."

Though the economics language was in jest,
Saffran's concern for my welfare was typical.

Honor Saffran with dorm name
Dear Editor:

The economics department is doing a commendable
job withBernie Saffran's Econ 1 classes. Though he lost
a close friend, Professor Caskey took over Tuesday's
classes and is making sure that students will be ready
for the final. He has assured students that the final will

be designed and graded as Professor Saffran would
have done, and is making sure that students get proper
guidance in writing term papers. Professor Saffran's
death was such a tremendous personal and academic

loss for members of the department, and I thank them
for their plan to provide a fair end to the semester. I am
glad that the college seems to be honoring Professor
Saffran's academic legacy. But we can do more. Bernie
Saffran inspired hundreds of students, past and present, was a pillar in the economics department and was
very well regarded for his contributions to his field.

Swarthmore should remember Bernie Saffran by naming the New Dorm in his honor.

Pessimism distinct from apathy
Dear Editor:

My perusal of the Nov. 18 letter by Sue Chen 'O6 and
David Lovit 'O6 ("The cost of our sunshine," pg. 14) left
me neither filled with self-loathing nor desirous of

retracting my earlier remarks, but instead alarmed at
the ability of an ill-chosen headline to make an apparently indelible impression on readers' minds.
Whether chosen to conform to space constraints or to
indulge an editor's fondness for cinematic allusion,
the title "Eternal sunshine of the apathetic mind"
(Nov. 11, pg. 18) grossly misrepresented the op-ed
whose contents it purported to encapsulate.
First, the headline flatly discounted my eventual
conclusion that I am not, in fact, apathetic. More
objectionable even than this attempt to prejudice
readers against me from the outset, however, was the
implication that, were I indeed inclined to inaction
and disinterest, awareness of this listlessness would
not detract from my (supposed) enjoyment of it. The
careful reader quickly realizes the error in this. When
accused of indifference, I "was troubled," "worried"
about the possible truth of the allegations. Wouldn't
an advocate of apathy have proudly pleaded guilty as
charged, and proceeded to try to inspire others to

December 2, 2004

inactivism, too? Chen and Lovit seem to think that I
did so, but I defy them to show me where.
Pessimism is not, I contend, • incompatible with
compassion for one's fellow man or involvement in
worldly affairs. Acknowledgment of ineradicable violence and hardship does not imply approval of
much less perverse pleasure in
it. Recognition of
the world's admittedly sad state of affairs does not
paralyze; it tempers. While striving to alleviate suffering, the pessimistic humanitarian keeps in mind
not only personal limitations, but also the unlikelihood of ever accomplishing the desirable amount of
positive change, and is thus unfazed by the occasional (and, I think even Chen and Lovit would agree,
inevitable) failure. Aware of the spatial and temporal
übiquity of human atrocity, the pessimist need not
rely on "shock and outrage" engendered by particular
[him] into action." His
instances of it to "propel
motivation is an ever-present one. Unlike those who
are periodically mobilized by indignation only to be
subsequently incapacitated by post-setback depression, the stoical pessimist is able to sustain an
unremitting effort to "improve the world." Even the
worst, after all, admits betterment.

If you've ever caught a
glimpse of me making my
third trip to the pasta bar in

shy away from a good meal
(and by "good" I mean huge

cannot deny that food and

fashion don't always mix. No
Hip-ocrite
matter how much my inner
fat girl begs to differ, clothes
often seem to look better on
stick-thin waifs. So where do
the overindulgent yet fashion-loving masses fit in? As with
most things in life, the way your consumption is viewed by the
world is all in how you spin it. Gluttony is a problem, but
excess, well, that's hot. A little bit of suave discrimination and
you can have your cake and couture, too.
No one embodies the marriage of glamour and excess quite

Pas

like Oscar Wilde. Wedding hedonism to aestheticism, Wilde
still defines stylish indulgence. Unabashedly proclaiming that
"nothing succeeds like excess" and that he "can resist anything
but temptation," Wilde defies the notion that less is more, living extravagantly in everything from eating habits to dress. If
you look at that empty bag of potato chips as hedonism at its
finest, suddenly you feel more luxurious than slovenly.
Modern day dandies are making moderation look passe,
too. When Rufus Wainwright raspily* croons about a few of his
favorite cravings in "Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk," you
can't exactly look down on the pretty boy with the seductive
lisp. No, there's nothing wrong with excess, just so long as it's
stylishly executed. In the right hands, food can be fabulous.
Consumption has long been a mark of status; in America,
you are what you buy, edibles included. Going for an elite persona? Purchasing your first bottle of Cristal is also purchasing
your first bottle of pretension. Looking for a little edge?
Cancerous rebellion is just a pack of Marlboros away. Or, better yet, you can be rebellious and ironic with a pack of candy
cigarettes conveniently purchased at the coffee bar (bonus
irony points if you roll them up in the sleeve of your old
D.A.R.E. T-shirt).
My own unique definition through consumption came in an
unexpected place: the candy shop. I was asked to flash I.D.
before purchasing a package of aptly named "gummy butts,"
as they were technically "adult candy." My deliciously pornographic purchase set me apart from the younger crowd of
candy connoisseurs, and I've been living life in the fast lane

ever since.

Food makes a great accessory. Coffee is the perfect accessory to a thick book, flouting your iiber-studious lifestyle with flair
(thick glasses optional). Fruit is perhaps the most overlooked edible fashion accessory. The demure, retro styles that have domi-

nated this fall are just screaming for an apple to be kitschily
shined on them, giving you a school-girlish charm. Too tame for
you? Fruit seems to always be scandalously phallic or yonic, so
bite those bananas and chew those cherries if you dare (extra
scandal points if you transport your banana in your pocket).
Luckily, winter is forgiving to those of us obsessed with
excess; the fat-inducing holidays we know and love come accompanied by layer-inducing cold weather. There are so many easy
pile on the layers and
ways to hide your December bulge
there's no telling what amorphous blob lies underneath. Leg
warmers are the retro solution to lumpy legs, artfully concealing
those dreaded cankles (the melding calves and ankles of chubby
legs) but still letting you pull off the ever-so-essential New Year's
dress. An oversized sweater is concealing yet chic, and slouching
a big belt over the sweater and across your hips is sneakily slimming.

Food and the holiday season go hand in hand, so my advice is
to go with the flow and have fun while you're doing it. It is possible to eat fashionably a little imagination is all it takes. If you
are what you eat, then make sure you go for a big helping of fab-

that inspires the frantic shopping (that's for the
day after) and feverish anticipation of other holidays. Odds are, this Thanksgiving dinner was a
whole lot like the last, plus or minus one slightly
insane uncle or one pecan pie. That's part of its

beauty.

But if you look at the holiday in a semibiblical light, the day of thanks fails the purity
test. After all, behind the facade of family togetherness and grateful contemplation, Thanksgiving
is about one thing: stuffing yourself to that everso-tenuous point between perfect satisfaction and
who-made-those-biscuits-so-heavy pain. AD of the
feverish overindulgence that isn't released in the
form of credit card maximization is channeled
into a one-night-only feasting extravaganza that
would make any follower of the Middle Path (all
things in moderation, eh?) cringe.
And that's what we call gluttony, otherwise
known as deadly sin number six and often followed by deadly sin number seven: sloth. It's a

A note to the
culinarily inept
I'm not a great cook. In fact, I'm downright incompetent in
the kitchen. Over the years I've left in my wake dozens of bags
of burnt popcorn, several mangled tuna fish cans, and one

particularly ill-fated dish of macaroni mush and cheddar

Goldfish crackers. It hasn't been pretty. Still, even one so

incapable as myself manages to pick up some useful tidbits of
knowledge along the way. In hopes of providing similarly gifted individuals with some beacon of reassurance, I present to
you today....

1 Microwaves can explode. Avoid whenever possible.
2. Oven mitts are necessary attire for toasting, baking,
reheating, defrosting, melting, broiling, and microwaving.
Sure, they might look funny. But not as funny as THIRD-

DEGREE MUFFIN BURNS!
3. Ifa jar is hard to open, run it under hot water. If a jar is
REALLY hard to open, eh, there's probably something better
to eat anyway.
4. Pondering culinary philosophy is a great way to distract
yourself from the stress of preparing meals: "Isn't toasting
weird? Why does heated bread get all brown and crispy? Why
doesn't it, say, bake? Or melt? Or explode into flame? Could
Einstein maybe look into this?"
5. When in doubt, add peanut butter*
6. The safest foods to prepare are those that come with
cooking directions. Thus, safe foods: soup, macaroni and
cheese, popcorn. D-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s foods: eggs, mutton roast,
turnips.
7. Watching others cook is a great way to learn basic
kitchen skills. Watching late-night reruns of Iron Chef Japan
is not.
8. If you're left-handed, complain that any difficult-to-use
kitchen device (e.g. can opener, cheese grater) is "made for
righties." Gripe about the systematic righty-normatization of
our society. Whine about being oppressed. Then get a sympathetic right-hander to cook for you.
9. Remember this number: 610-544-2300. Renato's can save
any ruined meal.

The search for pastrami

When I got sick when I was little, I was given matzoh ball soup
and a black-and-white cookie. I'm
not Jewish, but this Jewish soul
food brings back the warm and
fuzzy memories of my childhood
better than anything else. So
when I get a craving for a sandwich, I don't want a bag lunch
I
want meat piled high on good rye
bread with deli mustard and a
pickle. I want pastrami, and I
wouldn't' trust pastrami from just
anywhere, so I tried Kibitz in the
City, which, according to the sign
on the window, is "the Real New
York Delicatessen," only in Philly.
New York delis have a certain
reputation: the gruff servers, the
massive heaps of meat, the pickles, and oy, the heartburn. Also, if
you visit such legends as the
Carnegie or Katz's, the prices can
be worse than the line outside.
The Kibitz in the City experience
is no-frills, but the food is quality.
The small seating area (more
room upstairs) is almost guaranteed to have at least one whitehaired couple kvetching about
something, and though Kibitz gets
good business, there are no long
lines at the service counter.

Unlike their all-attitude counter-

parts in Big Apple, the women at
Kibitz are friendly and let you
take your time placing an order.
Classic deli sandwiches run about

than enough. The rye is cut thicker than I'm used to, but this makes

it easier to keep the mountain of
sandwich together. The cole slaw

is nothing to write home about,
but the pickles are good, and the
combination definitely hits the
spot.
I was disappointed to find a
lack of certain classic beverage
options such as the malt or, my
personal favorite, the egg cream
(which contains neither eggs nor
cream, just seltzer and milk). Your

basic water, juices and sodas are

served, including Philadelphia's
own Hank's, which makes a
decent root beer and one of the
better cream sodas available. The
other food products available are
definitely
appetizing.

favorites like the kosher hot dog
(overheard

between a father and his toddler
son: "Can you say knish?"). The
fresh-cut fries are attractive, as
are other, cheaper sandwich
options, such as a smoked turkey
sandwich ($9.75 whole, $7 hah)
and chicken salad ($8.75 whole,
$6.50 half). Of course, there are
also liverwurst, salami and
tongue sandwiches, the classic
reuben (definitely not kosher with
its
sauerkraut
and
cheese,
Russian dressing), and for those of
you who didn't get enough
Thanksgiving over break, you can
also get a hot open turkey sandwich with challah stuffing and
cranberry sauce on the side.
Succumbing to the Atkins craze,
Kibitz offers almost all of their
sandwiches as "wraps" as well,
although wrap or no wrap, you

are guaranteed artery-clogging
goodness. For those who don't
care about cholesterol, and who

know to bring Rolaids,

triple-

back to try the challah french
toast (another childhood classic)
and to check out some of the other
breakfast-anytime options.

I did make sure not to leave
without matzoh ball soup, $6.75
for a quart to go. They pack it

right
veggies and broth in one
container, huge matzoh balls in
another. The result: a bit salty, but
even when reheated in a dorm

Eat your heart out, Buffy McBuffalo Wing

SARA SARGENT
AKA Alan Wingspan

All of you so-called chicken wing aficionados with your Sharpies Wing Bar, let
me tell you something: You wouldn't know
an authentic Buffalo wing if it bit you in the
face. You can keep your Wing Bar "Buffalo"
wings and your "blue cheese dressing" and
your "pride." I'll be at home with my real
Buffalo wings, the kind you can only get in
Buffalo, NY drumsticks of meaty chicken
goodness, fried to perfection and smothered
in spicy Buffalo sauce.
Oh, you thought we were only about
snow days and crappy football teams?

Wrong. Our city may not have much, but
tasty wings we've got. And let me tell you, by
second semester, I've had it up to here with
Wing Bar hype and the abounding wingnorance in this city. Swarthmore just can't
hack it when it comes to Buffalo wings.
Luckily for me, every winter, the poultry
gods deliver the Holy Grail of the wing world
right to Philadelphia: Wing Bowl. Never
heard of it? Neither had Erica Lukoski '08: "I
don't know what [Wing Bowl] is and I don't
want to know." Well, Erica, I'm glad you
asked. In February, more than 20,000
wingophiles (trust me, that's the technical
term) descend on the city to watch contestants compete in the annual Wing Bowl eating competition. (N. 8.: It's Wing Bowl and

not "PBR Bowl" or "Pork Rind Bowl,"
because when the contest was established 12
years ago, the Buffalo Bills were losing the
Superbowl every freaking year and the
Wing Bowl founders figured they'd throw
my city a bone by honoring The Wing.)
Hosted by WIP 610 Sports Radio, Wing Bowl
is held on the Friday before the Superbowl
at the Wachovia Center. From 6-10 a.m., this
sports-complex-come-mecca-of-hedonisticexcess is home to the contest's 24 ravenous
participants and enough wings to feed a
small country.
And don't forget about The Wingettes,
the Laker Girls for the chicken wing set.
Chosen for the size of their, erm, intellect,

The Wingettes are a contingent of sexy
women in tight T-shirts who prance around
Wing Bowl, carrying plates of wings to each
contestant kind of like Hooters on Parade.
These little flowers of hard-won innocence
are probably an attempt at balancing the
walloping mix of testosterone, cheap beer
and Buffalo sauce at 8 a.m., since chicken
wings and drunk guys are always the makings of a classy, fun-for-the-whole-family

event.
The actual wing-eating showdown takes
place over one hour, divided into two 14minute segments and one two-minute segment. In an attempt to join the ranks of gluttonous greats like Bill "El Wingador"
Simmons (154 wings) and Sonya "The Black
Widow" Thomas (167 wings), contestants
compete to eat the most Buffalo wings in the
30-minute period. And how do the ultimate
winners emerge as the most gluttonous gluttons of all? "Do people from Buffalo usually
win? Is it like a home-court advantage?"
asked Tiana Pyer-Pereira 'O7. Not really. The
fiercest competitors are those who prepare
by chugging gallons of water to expand their
stomachs and chomping on refrigerated
Tootsie Rolls to strengthen their jaws. But
the training is well worth it; the best chomper will go home with the title of Queen or
King of Wing Bowl and a new Suzuki Verona
and who wouldn't want to earn the right to
"WNGKING" vanity plates on that spiffy
-

automobile?
Now, you may be asking yourself, "How
can I get in on some Wing Bowl action?"
Simone Boyle 'O7 was certainly up for it.
"What's the big deal? I can do that!" she said.
Whoa there, Buffy Mcßuffalo Wing, not so
fast. Unfortunately, Wing Bowl is only for
professional eaters (read: really, really fat
men and small Asian women) who qualify
for the contest by eating a basketball-sized
hamburger or a can of worms.
Iknow, Iknow, you were all ready to bust
out your Wing Bowl alter ego, "Alan
Wingspan," and devour the competition, but
don't put grandma's chicken suit back in the
attic just yet. Even though amateurs like
ourselves can't compete, we can spectate for
free. Just hop on the proverbial Buffalo
Wing Bandwagon and head to Philly's
Wachovia Center on Feb. 4 at 6 a.m.
Seriously, though, don't be chicken
go
and get wingified. Part NFL pre-game show,
part WWF, part Man Show, part KFC and
part "Sesame Street" (you know, because
Big Bird might be a chicken), Wing Bowl is
not your average Paces party. Hey, if you can
get your kicks by grinding with random
LOTR fanatics, you can certainly have a
good time watching busty babes and gluttonous freaks devour slabs of meat dripping
in grease and hot sauce. Wing bar, anyone?

high school adventures into the Gothic oeuvre.
Fictional or no, the spokespeople/anthropomorphized ice
cream cones selling us food have to be distinctive and recognizable in order catch a consumer's mind as well as his
appetite. Although we cannot claim to be as debonair as the
monocled Planter's Peanut man-nut, we can learn from the
stylish characteristics that have made him (and others like
him) an icon, and good with beer.

the pompadour ever went out of style. No one can do it like

approval.

2. Mrs. Butterworth What we want to know is: Where is
Mr. Butterworth? We deduce that he was just holding her
back, and, like any career-sawy woman, she left him to
secure her place at the top of the syrup pyramid. As an ironic comment on domestic life, however, she continues to wear
the apron that once had her making pancakes instead of
making dollah. We'd like to see more vintage aprons outside

3. Tony the Tiger For all his suggestive growling and
muscular form, Tony the Tiger seems to give a lot of attention to the jaunty angle of his neck scarf. As we've said
before, one simple accessory, properly placed, can hide virtually any flaw
including nudity. That's right, he's not
wearing any clothes! Tony is no mangy tiger, but a proud
metrosexual. He's grrrroomed!
4. Ronald McDonald Even if a steady diet of Big Macs
and fries left his face blotchy and red, it's still no excuse for
Ronald McDonald's horrendous makeup job. Sure, he's a
clown. But consider his appearance before applying that
fifth layer of foundation. Makeup kills.
5. Quaker Oatmeal Man Quaker Oatmeal Man No, he is
not William Penn, as many suspect. According to the Quaker
Oatmeal website, The Quaker Oatmeal man is "not an actual person." He is the embodiment of Quaker values: "honesty, purity, integrity and strength." Who knew so much
could come from a benevolent smile and simple blue hat?
Think of the basic elements of an outfit like a nice big bowl
of Quaker oatmeal: you can dress it up any way you want
(raisins, walnuts, bangles) but if the oatmeal is burned the
result is ruined regardless.

'Winter Winter': Twice the intellectual fun
The plot of the play is simple: two women waiting in

BY DANA SEAY
dseayl@swarthmore.edu
It is perhaps the central question of our Swarthmore
careers: Is it possible to combine intellectualism with
fun? In "Autumn Summer Winter Winter," the Senior
Company's 2004 offering, the answer seems to be yes.
Taking existentialist questions of meaning and being

and exploring them through everything from pantomime
to schtick, esoteric concerns become surprisingly capti-

vating.

Is enlightenment found in a
Twinkie? Does the image of a man
on a leash have profound meaning?
Senior Company, a requirement for theater majors, is
the culmination of years of work in the theater department. Occurring first semester of senior year, the theater students produce, direct and act in a play to be performed at the end of the semester.
This year's Senior Company stays true to its name
and is composed entirely of seniors. Hannah Harvester
'O5, Jyoti Gupta 'O5, Joy Mills 'O5 and Matt Fitting 'O5
decided to utilize the skewed gender breakdown of their
group (three females and one male) to perform a play
that explores gender stereotypes as part of its discourse
on identity and being.

a bar for a man. The set of the play is similarly sparse,
with the focal point consisting of the bar where the two

women wait for days and days. "Two women in a bar is
certainly a powerful image
waiting for a man is
messed up," Mills said.
"By taking it to the extreme, it becomes more powerful. It's simultaneously logical and absurd," Fitting
added. "The audience can relate to the situation of waiting for someone who never seems to come." In this way,
"Autumn Summer Winter Winter" causes the audience
to come away from the play pondering the meanings
behind the most seemingly ordinary activities.
"Autumn Summer Winter Winter" offers a fast-paced
and exciting way to approach intellectual topics; what
keeps the viewer engaged is the lightheartedness with
which the play approaches grave subject matter. Is
enlightenment found in a Twinkle? Does the image of a
man on a leash have profound meaning? True, answers
don't lie at the bottom of a bottle, but they may just be
found in a bar.
"What I like most about the play is the comedy," Mills
said, as "Autumn Summer Winter Winter" manages to
mix humor into its discourse on existentialism. The dialogue, straightforward yet complex, elicits laughs nearly
as often as it does head-scratching contemplation.
And if spiritual enlightenment and laughs aren't
enough for you, there's sex appeal too!
"Working with a six-foot whip was challenging at
first," said Gupta, whose character introduces her presence with a crack of the whip, "but now I really feel that
the whip is an integral part of my character." Gupta, who

'04 celebrities (and scandals) in review
In a year of marriage and lip-syncing scandals, only a handful of celebrities truly stood out. Here's the rundown
mer where you probably couldn't go an
hour without hearing his voice on the
radio or seeing his Michael Jackson ripoff dance moves on various awards
shows.
In October, Usher benefited from rereleasing his album as a special edition
complete with four new songs, including
the infectious "My Boo," which still sits
at the top of Billboard's Hot 100 Singles
today.

BRANDY MONK-PAYTON
Pop Life
The end of the year always gives the
entertainment industry one last opportunity to toot its narcissistic horn through
multiple, excruciatingly repetitive countdowns. From the 100 Best Songs of the
Year to the 50 Most Infamous Celebrity

Scandals of 2004 to any other random
ranking on E!, countdowns have become a
staple way to remember the happenings

of the year.
To get a head start reflecting on this
year's memories, I have compiled my own
sample year-in-review list of the movers
and shakers that made these past 12
months entertaining.
1. Usher Music has had somewhat of a
lackluster year, but one R&B/Pop crooner
has managed to stay at the top of his
game. Usher dominated the charts for
weeks, with "Confessions" becoming one
of the few albums to pass the millioncopies-sold mark in its first week of
release. There was a time this past sum-

18

For the love of humanity,
let the breast-implant
rumors slide. Refuting
them never works. Ask
Britney Spears.
2. Ashlee Simpson No one really
wanted to hear her autobiography, but
unfortunately we got it anyway. And it
was, bizarrely, a hit. Anything MTV
touches inevitably turns to gold (besides
this year's VMAs), and Ashlee Simpson
was no exception. The lil' sis of the perennial dumb newlywed Jessica Simpson let
cameramen into her life to film her burgeoning career as an artist.
Her album did better than expected,
thanks to the reality show, but someone
should have told her that what goes up
and sometimes in
must come down
front of a studio audience and millions of
viewers at home on Saturday Night Live.
Apparently the "live" part didn't seep into
her brain well, and after an embarrassing
performance caught the younger Simpson
lip synching, she blamed her band for the
flub.

Artist integrity at its best? Not so
much. Stay tuned to see if she bounces
back.
3. Lindsay Lohan Another 'tween star
that garnered attention for her negative
and positive moments this past year was
Lindsay Lohan. For those of us who
shamelessly remember her days of obscurity in the remake of "The Parent Trap"
or her laughable feud with Hilary Duff
over Aaron Carter, the new and improved
Lohan may have come as a surprise. She
drinks, smokes and dates shady guys like
Wilmer Valderama!
If anything, this year should open her
eyes about the industry. Refrain from
making a fool of yourself by crossing over
into the music biz when your career isn't
solidified in movies. Stop hanging out
with Paris Hilton and Tara Reid; they are
scary people. And for the love of humanity, let the breast-implant rumors slide.
Refuting them never works. Ask Britney
Spears.
4. Britney Spears In my last column

I told myself that I wouldn't discuss the
Mrs.
subject of Miss Spears
oops
Federline. But her situation so epitomizes
one huge trend for celebrities this year:
Hollywood Gone Domestic.
Ever wonder where all of the huge
actresses and female singers went in
2004? Home with babies and/or husbands.
Million-dollar marriage ceremonies and
the pregnancy plague took over as some
stars became less interested in their
careers and more focused on family.
Britney was so excited that she got married twice this year. Jennifer Lopez got
hitched for the third time, to Marc
Anthony in a secret ceremony. Gwyneth
Paltrow gave birth to baby Apple earlier
in 2004. Following in bad names, Julia
Roberts welcomed twins Hazel and

Over the last 12 months, we have lost
four sexy singles and gained four desperate housewives in television. Actors like
Jude Law and Jamie Foxx are finally
making their mark in film. A green ogre
still dominated the box office. The whole
country saw Janet Jackson's bare breast.
We still jam to Outkast. People actually
bought Norah Jones' new album. As we
head into a new year in entertainment,
remember that any publicity is good publicity.

"Alexander." Yeah, and judging from the reception this
howler of an "epic" got from the audience with whom I
saw the movie, there probably won't be another film
made about the legendary leader, lest memories of this
misguided, thoroughly unengaging travesty pops up in
the minds of all those who managed to sit through its
interminable three-hour running time.

At one point, one of Alexander's
despondent generals, who speaks
in a Scottish accent to emphasize
his humble beginnings, actually
refers to some of the infantry as
"lads." Uh-oh.
Oliver Stone apparently spent $l5O million and more
than 10 years of his life trying to bring his vision of
Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell) to the big screen but
sadly, it was all for naught, as this piece of garbage clearly demonstrates. Right off the bat, you can tell there's
trouble brewing when Anthony Hopkins (an aged
Ptolemy) begins to blabber on (and on and on) about
Alexander's life, recounting the story of Alexander's life
to some Egyptian scribe. It's a sure sign the narrative is
in shambles when you use a boring old geezer to set up
the framework of your story.
Still, the narrative is just one aspect of the production
that blows this one to pieces. Stone uses a lot of time to
try and help the audience understand some of
Alexander's motivations by concentrating a huge chunk
of film on his childhood. Even at a young age, we can see
what a great leader Alexander will become because he
tames a wild horse. Awww, now isn't that cute? Kinda

Stallion."
Anyway, we learn later that Alexander's loyalties are
divided between his serpent-loving, vixen mother,
Olympia, and his crass father, King Philip (Val Kilmer,
doing a decent job of parading around as a perpetual
drunkard). Mommy encourages Alexander to conquer
the world, so, like any good son, he does what mother
wants and sets out to conquer the known world. Farrell
is an okay actor, but he's obviously in way over his head
here. With his dyed blond hair and unimposing physical
presence, Farrell makes Alexander seem more like a displaced wuss than one of the greatest leaders in human
history.
There are brushes of beauty here and there, most of it
in the extravagant costumes and the production design.
But it is only in the battle scenes that Stone makes any
sort of indelible mark in the viewer's mind. There is a
rawness in these moments of mass carnage that shows
the director at his finest. The elephants of India and the
gargantuan Persian army are certainly sights to behold.
Still, they're not enough to redeem the excruciatingly
awful screenplay, which loads every major character
with pretentious lines that play more like catchphrases
than actual human dialogue.
Never one for letting emotions simmer beneath the
surface, Stone pushes overacting to the extreme. I don't
think there's a single character in this whole production
that doesn't go into a massive fit of histrionics at one
point, including Alexander's exotic wife, Roxanne. As
played by Rosario Dawson, you'd think she accidentally
stepped off the set of Broadway's "The Lion King" for all
the growling and slapping she does in her hilarious wedding night encounter with Farrell.
It doesn't exactly help that the characters speak in a
mish-mash of Irish, British, Scottish, and Slavic accents.
Jolie, in particular, sounds increasingly ludicrous as the
movie progresses, maybe because she's stuck uttering a
series of comic diatribes against the backdrop of an overly sappy score. Even funnier, at one point one of
Alexander's despondent generals, who speaks in a
Scottish accent to emphasize his humble beginnings,
actually refers to some of the infantry as "lads." Uh-oh.
The personal aspects of Alexander's life mostly center
around his apparent bisexuality, but the matter is dealt
with in a pretty tame manner. There are plenty of longing looks and revelations of love between Alexander and

his lover, Hephaestion (Jared Leto, sporting a monstrous
amount of mascara), but Stone, knowing it probably
wouldn't sit well with most audiences, shies away from
showing anything more graphic than a series of bear
hugs. Still, one has to wonder why he's pushing the issue
so much. Is there a political agenda here, or is Stone just
trying to break some taboos?
So what does it all add up to? Alexander conquered
most of the known world by the age of 25. But why? We
hardly get an idea from this interpretation, except that
perhaps he was trying to get away from his mother.
When you spend more than the GDP of some small countries and more than a decade researching someone's life,
it is a tragedy indeed that, for all of its grandeur, you've
created a film that hardly gets into the mind of such a
monumental historical figure. Alexander the Great must
be turning over in his grave.

Running shoes: $9O. Flight to Wisconsin: $212.
Lucky socks: $5. Earning Ail-American honors at the
national meet in your first cross country season

ever: priceless.

Out of 215 nationally-qualifying runners, Sarah
Hobbs 'O6 took 31st place in the 6K national meet,
held at Whitetail Golf Course in Colfax, Wis.
Hobbs' time of 22:21.9 made her the first
Swarthmore runner ever to earn All-American honors in cross country. "The accomplishments that
Sarah made are difficult to do even if you've run
cross country for several seasons. The fact that she
came right out and earned All-American honors in
her first season is just incredible," head coach Pete
Carroll said.
Swarthmore was last represented at the national
meet in 2000, when Jokotade Agunloye 'Ol ran with a
Garnet jersey. "It's tough enough to simply qualify
for nationals, and often people will put their whole
body and soul into the regional race to qualify, and
then have trouble repeating that sort of performance
at the national meet," assistant coach Laura Feeney

Hobbs went into the race with a few butterflies.
"It was really scary," Hobbs said. "I've never been to
anything remotely like it in my life. People were so
excited to be there." Sixty-five teams were represented at the meet from every part of the country.
"Entire teams drove from a million miles away and
were running around in the freezing cold with no
clothes on to support their teammates," Hobbs said.
The team spirit was there. Fans did anything and
everything to support the runners from their respective schools. "There was one guy wearing only tiny
shorts and a knights helmet, which almost made us
run into a tree because he was so busy cheering one
runner on," Hobbs said.
On the whole, Hobbs had a great time. "It was just
an amazing and inspiring experience," Hobbs said.
"It gives me so much respect for the sport and the
people who love it." Even though this was her first
official season running cross country, Hobbs has
developed a love of the sport. "It's hard not to [love
it] in an environment like that. I'm the luckiest girl
ever."

Egg Donor Wanted

We are a couple who found each other too late in life to have children with our own eggs, but we
one in academics, one in creative
want to have children together. We're both highly intelligent
arts and we greatly value intellectual and creative life. We also value imagination, mathematical
or musical or artistic talent, compassion, kindness, honesty, a searching spirit, emotional insight
and sensitivity, among other things. Of course, these are not just in the genes, and we're not looking for the "perfect" baby. What we would like is to find an egg donor who embodies some of the
qualities we value in each other in the hopes that whatever portion of our selves is in the genes
might resemble what we would have with our own eggs. We're ethnically Jewish and relatively
small; resemblance to these is nice but less important. We're not rich but we can pay you $lO,OOO
in addition to all the expenses involved. Some travel within the northeast might be required. If you
think this might be for you, please write hopefulcpl@yahoo.com; tell us a bit about yourself and
why you think you'd be a good match for us. If you're comfortable including a picture, please do,
but it's not a necessity. You can stay anonymous (our doctor can handle things once we've identified the right person); final arrangements could range from complete anonymity to giving some
means for the child to contact you if it wants when grown up to our meeting one another. This is a
chance to do a good thing for someone who might be very much like yourself, just further down
the road of life; and in return, we can lighten your material load a little. We hope to hear from you.

NBA style

If you're reading this column, you know what went down in The
Palace nearly two weeks ago, and you didn't have to flip to the
sports pages to get the scoop on the brawl. Well, we're gonna talk
about it all
this is real shit. Not our typical Jon-Barry-was-contacted-by-the-Minnesota-Timberwolves-today shit, but something a
little more meaningful.
We'll start with the good that
came out of this mess. ESPN and
a handful of wannabes felt obligated to place this fight in the
context of other ugly moments in
sports history. Our favorite flashback was the footage from 1979
that captured a Boston Bruins
player fighting in the stands with
a fan at MSG. The fan tries to
escape by sliding headfirst on his
stomach into the next row, but the
SAM BELL
Bruin grabs his leg, wrestles off
SAM BRECKENRIDGE the fan's shoe and pummels him
with it. Khrushchev would have
The Dirty Corner
been proud.
Now, let's skip to the ugliest of
BH^aHßMaaniMHß^
the Detroit Pistons
all ugly
fans. ESPN commentators Steven
A. Smith and Bill Walton both said that there were no winners in this
debacle. We agree. Ron Artest, Stephen Jackson and Jermaine O'Neal
will lose some salary and respect in the eyes of some and the Pistons
we should say
organization will forfeitrevenue, but the Detroit fans
the suburban Detroit fans
have nothing to lose. They are just losers. These violent, garbage-throwing fans, after their prison sentences
are up, should be blacklisted from all sporting venues for a while.
Shit, even NASCAR doesn't want these vermin. What's the
over/under on the number of violent deaths at the 2005 MLB All-Star
game and 2006 Super Bowl, both hosted by Detroit?
That said, "cha-ching, cha-ching." Millions more "cha-chings." If
you were (un)lucky enough to be wrongfully attacked by Ron Artest
or Stephen Jackson, then throw some ice on your wounds, call up
Lionel Hutz and invest in the Dirty Corner Beverage Fund c/o Shmu
and Sammy.
So here's what it came down to: David Stern is a businessman,
not a judge. As the CEO of the NBA with unanimous judicial
authority, he simultaneously shat on the Players' Union an<| protected the interests of the NBA's fan base, the real cash cow. And as
hard as it is to defend Artest, especially after he goes on the Today
Show, donates a chunk of his face time to protesting his year-long
suspension, and then shamelessly plugs (three times!) the R&B
album he produced, he shouldn't sit for the remainder of the season.
While he might have a long rap sheet with the NBA, an equally troubled individual Vernon Maxwell acted similarly in 1995 and only
drew a 10-game suspension. To lay down such a severe punishment
on Artest for a similar infraction, when the fans were behaving far
worse than in Maxwell's case, demonstrates that Stern is really
worried about damage control and how much he thinks the NBA's
image has crumbled in only 10 years. Sadly, the NBA knows that it
can't alienate the wealthy white fan base who'll shell out $350 a seat
on the lower level. It just can't have large, angry, uncontrollable
black men threatening their experience. Ronnie's gotta go.
Artest should not have been in
Don't let our sarcasm fool you
those stands, and Stern had to make that clear to the players. We just
think that Stern made it a little too clear for the players, and by suspending Jermaine O'Neal, he failed to send an equally strong message

to unruly fans.

O'Neal has the best case of anybody punished. In addition to
being a genuinely affable person (one of the best interviews in
sports
arguably the most respectful and polite towards the hostile
media), he didn't go up into the stands. His involvement in the tussle with Pistons fans, after they threw a metal folding chair at him,
might actually merit the self-defense argument. But he got 25 games
for the one stinkand will be out more than two million dollars
ing punch (oh, but what a punch! Right handed and slipping on
beer) he landed on a gelatinous twit who rushed Artest on the court.
O'Neal shouldn't miss a game. This shouldn't be a tough argument
to win
the twit who got hit (we hope that nickname sticks, baby)
and his posse obviously weren't there to diffuse the situation on the
court. HIS FAT FRIEND SQUARED OFF AGAINST THE MEANEST
MAN IN ALL OF BASKETBALL
ON THE COURT. They weren't
pushed onto the court. It was a conscious decision to haul their fat
asses out of the seats and onto the court. Even if that wasn't the
case, O'Neal and Artest, given the melee, shouldn't have to ask what
their intentions are, at least on the court itself. It could have been
a parade of nuns, Lassie or Stephen Hawking (especially Hawking)
who caught four slugs in the chest from Ronnie or O'Neal's 45 and
we'd still be here defending their actions. But maybe that says a little too much about us.

Bag the BCS
Football season is coming to a close as this semester
wraps up, and all around the country teams are vying to
become bowl-eligible for a chance to play over winter
break, get on national TV, and of course earn some big
bucks for their schools' "academic" programs. That being
said, the end of the season

almost

always

along

with some

comes

BCSrelated controversy, and
this year proves to be no
different.
Auburn
and
USC,
Oklahoma are all undefeated this season, and all
of them have made a
strong case to play in the
national
championship
game in the Orange Bowl
this January. USC has

been the number-one team
all year, dominating the
ALEX RYAN-BOND
Pac-10 and all other comers
while
Oklahoma
has
Hardball
marched
through
the
tough Big 12 and Auburn
mmmmm hi^
has come out on top of a
very talented heap in the SEC. However, the Tigers are on
the outside looking in, needing an upset of either numberone USC or number-two Oklahoma this next weekend coupled with a win in their own SEC Championship game
against Tennessee to make it to the Orange Bowl. Talk
about long odds.
Chances are USC faces off against Oklahoma, and we're
stuck wondering whether an undefeated Auburn could
have come out on top of the winner (cough, USC, cough).
So all I ask is: Why are we still bothering with a BCS system that is riddled with problems and always leaves us
second-guessing at the outcomes? Let's just have a playoff.
It seems fair to let the top 16 teams take the month of
December and slug it out for the right to be called champion, doesn't it?
Keep in mind that every other major sport (not including golf, it's not really a sport so don't bother complaining)
at almost every level of competitive play has a playoff system for deciding its champion. Even Division 11, 111 and lAA football have their own playoffs; it's only Division I
that sticks to the outdated bowl system due to "tradition"
and the large amount of money school athletic programs
get from competing in bowls, which is why there has been
such a proliferation ofbowls for "eligible" teams in the last
15 years. For some reason I doubt the Continental Tire
Bowl has a longstanding tradition and pedigree in collegiate sports. So let the teams play.
You'd think that a playoff system would also give the
NCAA better press and more revenue, although they don't
seem to think so, ignoring the fact that March Madness is
easily one of the most popular and profitable events in
American sports culture. NCAA football also doesn't
schedule any games for the middle three weeks of
December, losing revenue and viewers over a time span
that could be spent playing the first rounds of a playoff system, letting the 16 best teams in America battle for the

championship.
Ostensibly, the NCAA will never allow a playoff system
to get put in place because of the entrenched marketing
system and revenues offered by the bowls, which is a
shame. For an organization that argues for fair competition amongst its members and athletes, it hardly seems
fair to allow computers and pollsters to determine which
two teams play each other for the championship. It seems
the more equitable option to let the top 16 teams decide
whose best by playing it out over the month of December,
providing quality football and high stakes excitement for
players and fans, and money for the NCAA and colleges.

Badminton battles Bryn Mawr early
BY SONALI SHAHI

sshahil@swarthmore.edu

On Nov. 20, the Swarthmore vs.
Bryn Mawr badminton rivalry continued at the Main Line Doubles
invitational. Abe Howland 'O6 and
Jessica Larson 'O6 combined with
Anna Ruff 'O6 and Miasha Howard
'OB to form two teams, putting forth
a strong effort but failing to advance
into the finals of their brackets.
"Because these were open tournaments, we played against a lot of
experienced older players, including some on the national and junior
national teams," Larson said. "I
think we played much better this
year, and I know that when we
begin our regular season we will be

ready to win."

At the Mid-Atlantic Tournament
the week before, Larson won her
bracket after defeating three Bryn
Mawr players.
Abe
Howland
advanced to the semifinals of his
singles bracket. "Candice Cherk
['o7] and Maishia Howard ['oB] also
played well and won several games
each," Larson said. "For doubles,
Candice and I made it to the semis of
our bracket, as did Maishia and
Anna Ruff. Andrew Sniderman
made it to the finals of his bracket.
He played with a non-collegiate
player."

With the preseason drawing to a
close, Swarthmore's focus is on Bryn
Mawr. "I think our preseason efforts
have really paid off," Larson said.
"We have been doing a lot of conditioning, which is beneficial because
we are no longer more tired than our
opponents during a game. Instead,
we are tiring them out."
With the addition of coach
Bhavin, coach Loomis said, the
team
has
made tremendous
improvements. "He's been running
them pretty hard. They're going to
be in good shape."
"Bhavin is just a great step in the
direction. Practices
right
are
intense. We do footwork drills and
about an hour of conditioning and
drills," Anjali Aggarwaal 'O6 said.
Swarthmore may finally achieve
consistent wins over Bryn Mawr. In
the past, the teams have broken
even. Last year, Swarthmore won the
first match, but, as Loomis said of

On Saturday Nov. 20, two members of the women's

rugby team did an excellent job of representing the college when they battled talented competitors as members
of the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union (EPRU) select

team.

Unfortunately, the odds of this happening are slim to
none, and nobody in the NCAA seems to believe the old
slogan "that's why they let them play the games." So, enjoy
the bowl season this winter break and let everyone speculate whether or not Auburn could have beaten USC for the
national championship. And get used to the feeling of inadequacy that comes from the current BCS system, since it
isn't going anywhere anytime soon. As a side note, happy
holidays to all, and since this is my last column of 2004,
thank you for the semester.
Alex Ryan-Bond is a sophomore. You can reach him at at

Katie Merrick 'O5 and Jane Sachs 'O6 were chosen for
the team along with 23 other women after an arduous tryout on the preceding Saturday. Over 60 girls from 10 colleges attended the four-hour tryout, held at Swarthmore
on Cunningham Field. After an extensive amount of
drills and multiple scrimmages, the team was
announced. Both Merrick and Sachs were surprised to
hear their names called. "I was just shocked because I
didn't feel as thought I did well in the tryouts," Merrick
said.
Sachs agreed. "They all sounded so much more knowledgeable, and I was just sort of wandering around aim-

The weekend after tryouts, the newly formed EPRU
team played in a tournament against other select teams
at Dorey Park in Richmond, Virginia. The team didn't
fair well in its first game against Virginia Rugby Union
(VRU), losing by a score of 30-5. EPRU wasn't working
well together, and VRU, who had gotten a chance to practice before the tournament, capitalized on the situation.
EPRU did much better in its second game, beating
Potomac Rugby Union 30-20. According to Merrick,
Sachs' performance was a highlight of the game. "Jane
made an incredible open-field tackle with such a huge
hit that even the crowd was astounded," she said. The
EPRU head coach has advised Sachs to try out for the
Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union (MARFU) this sum-

mer.

Sachs, who only began playing rugby last spring, is
confused a bit by all the attention she has received. "I
still don't know what's happening when I play rugby,"
she said. "I just pick up the ball and run with it."

Swimming tops conference foe Ursinus
BY TORI MARTELLO
vmartell@swarthmore.edu
No, Swarthmore has not become a
breeding ground for human Flippers,,
but one might have trouble distinguishing between the Garnet swim-

mers and the speedy mammals at their
meet last Tuesday, Nov. 23 at Ursinus.

Men's Swimming
The men's team traveled to face
conference opponent Ursinus and
overwhelmed the Bears. After a tough
trip for the Garnet against NYU, one of
the top squads in Division 111 competition, both teams took some time to
regroup and find the focus needed to
speed past Ursinus. The men came out
of the afternoon victorious by a score
of 118-80, while the women triumphed
134-114.
"Winning against Ursinus was a
definite ego boost for the team,"
Andrew Frampton 'OB said. Indeed,
many of the swimmers posted impressive times, led by Frampton's pool
record in the 500-yard freestyle of
4:57.91. He wasn't the only one who
seemed to glide through the water like
he had fins, as both Anders Taylor 'O7,

winners at the meet.
Taylor flew by the other swimmers
in the 1,000 freestyle and then pulled
out a close finish over Andy LeClair

'OB in the 100 butterfly. That second
victory won the meet for the Garnet
men. Their dominance was visible
throughout the meet as the team swept
the 200 freestyle, 100 backstroke and
100 breaststroke. The control they
exhibited over Ursinus allowed the
swimmers to try some different events
and gain valuable experience midway

through the season.
The win improved the Garnet's
record to 3-2 and an impressive 3-0 in
conference meets. "The senior leaders
know how to pump up the guys,"
Frampton said. Swarthmore will rely
on the seniors' experience to continue

its conference undefeated streak
throughout the long season.

Women's Swimming
While the men may be putting up
some amazing times, the women are
keeping pace as they employed all of
their swimmers to defeat Ursinus.
Since the Bears had a small squad, the
Garnet ladies depended on all 25 members of the team to wear down Ursinus
and gain a win.

Everyone was up for the task, especially the remarkable rookies, led by
Franny Zhang 'OB. "The [first-years]
are swimming really fast this year,"
Amy Kapit 'O6 said, and Zhang proved
her right as she won two events. Other
first-years also stepped up as Jennie

Lewis 'OB finished first in a Garnet
sweep of the 100 freestyle and Katie
Altynova 'OB sped by the others to win
the 200IM.
"The team swam strong when it
had to," Kapit said after the Garnet
women pulled out of a two-game losing
streak by thrashing the Bears. With
this victory, the team improved to 2-1
in the conference and equaled the men
with an overall record of 3-2.
This weekend, the men and
women will travel together to
Lancaster to compete in the Franklin
and Marshall Invite. The three-day
event includes match-ups against
Bloomsburg University, Elizabethtown College, Gettysburg College,
Ithaca College, Marymount University, McDaniel College, Millersville
University of Pennsylvania, Rowan

steals (L75 spg), and free throw percentage (80.8).
Gustafson earned Centennial Conference Player of the Week honors this
week after putting up numbers more obscene than the goings-on at the
annual Sager dance.
Coach Wimberly is excited about the performance of his star player.
"[Gustafson's] a kid who's gotten better and better every year. He's really coachable and keeps learning," Wimberly said. "I don't think we could
have asked for more." By "really coachable," Wimberly must mean "he
tears through our opponents like a hungry wolf in a KFC," because that
is exactly what he's done, putting up 25, 27, 37 (!), 35, and 29 points in this
season's games.
"[Gustafson] has picked us up and carried us on his back," McCormick
said. "I've never played with a better player."

Currently, I've gone
Less
over 75 days without
hockey.
The
last
lockout lasted 103
days, so time is running out if this season is ever
>
going to get underway.
Life must be rough for the players right now. Not
only are they not allowed to play the sport they're
most passionate about at the highest level, but
they're also losing valuable income. If Latrell
Sprewell can barely feed his family with $14.6 million, imagine what the average player in the NHL is
going through. Now that lockout pay has kicked in,
players are getting paid a sweet $lO,OOO a month to
do nothing. Arguably, that's a better appraisal of
their worth to society (when was the last time you
heard someone say we needed more hockey players?), but it's a bit of a step down from the average
salary of $l.B million. That must be a tough adjustment, except I just realized that I don't care.
While the players are too busy sitting around and
being greedy to notice their league is going down the
drain, the owners have reason not to rush back to the
ice. Nineteen of the league's 30 teams lost money last
year. Ted Leonsis, owner of the Caps, says he'll only
lose $lO million this year if the season is cancelled,
which is about $2O million less than what he threw
away last year. Plus, he has a special insurance fund
set up to cover these losses. The owners want reform,
and I don'tblame them. Yeah, they're a bunch of rich
guys who walk around in their Armani suits smoking Cubans, but they're rich for a reason. Not accepting any plan that doesn't add a salary cap and totally
change the nature of the NHL doesn't strike me as
being particularly stubborn. It's smart business. The
owners are probably* tired of feeling like they're running a charity for the fans.
Sadly, the real victims are the fans and the other
people who were affected by the league shutdown. No
one loses any sleep over the idea that Jeremy
Roenick might have to sell one of his mansfons, but
people should be upset when thousands lost their
jobs collecting tickets or working security (although,
I hear the NBA is hiring). Even sports writers are
affected. Read John Buccigross' weekly NHL column
and tell me he hasn't already gone insane; his latest
effort highlighted the "money lyrics" off the new U2
album.
The point is, I'm going home for winter break in a
couple of weeks and I want my hockey! There's nothing like taking a seat in the cool air of the MCI Center
with the Caps on the ice. Even if they lose (which
they did a lot last year), there's still more than
enough hard hits, amazing goals, and crowd-inspiring fights to make me happy. I love hockey, and I
want it back. So maybe, if the players and the owners
aren't listening, Santa is.

Gustafson shines but Garnet drop three in OT
BY TARIQ FISCHER

Talk about cardiac arrest.
After an 84-79 overtime loss to
the Philadelphia Biblical Crimson
Eagles Tuesday night, Swat basketball fans probably stumbled

into Worth Health Center with

complaints of chronic chest pain.
The game was the Garnet's third

consecutive overtime loss this

season, dropping the team to 1-4
with

the

Centennial schedule

looming.
Centennial Conference coaches picked the Tide to finish
eighth out of 10 teams in a preseason poll. Last year's preseason was a similar story, but Swat
managed to surprise quite a few
conference foes.
"We were in
contention for the playoffs up
until the final minute of the season last year," coach Lee

Wimberly explained.

Swarthmore opened up the
season on a strong note with a
four-point win over Connecticut
College on Nov. 19th at the
Equinox Classic, then faced a talented Williams squad, last year's

afternoon at home. The Garnet
battled the Ephs early and earned
a 31-31 tie at halftime. But

Williams put on an offensive
showcase in the second half, hitting 70 percent of its 3-point
attempts, gnd ultimately prevailed by a convincing score of 816L
Swarthmore then dropped its
next three as well, battling Drew,
Neumann,
and Philadelphia
Biblical into overtime play but
coming up just short in each
game. "In the OT games we had

chances to win, but we didn't,"
Wimberly said.

"We didn't play even up to half
of our potential," lan McCormick
'OB said of Tuesday's loss. "We

were pressured, and we didn't

handle the pressure well. We
haven't played a full game this
year up to our potential."
Wimberly is fielding an
extremely young team this year,
working many sophomores and
first-years into the rotation. "We
have a group of sophomores that
have to step up," Wimberly said.
"I haven't been thrilled with the
way it has gone." Jeff Maxim 'O7,
Chris Casey 'O7 and Dillon
McGrew 'O7 all scored in double
digits against the Crimson Eagles,
showing progress in the transition from role players to playmakers. A strong group of recruits is
also making an immediate

impact,
explained, "they've all struggled
making the adjustment to the college game." With the team's sights
firmly set on the conference playoffs, Wimberly said the firstyears' have a key role. "We need
[the first-years] to make significant contributions if we are going
to contend."
McCormick, who has been
receiving significant playing time

agreed
Wimberly's assessment. "The
freshmen that we have are very
capable of playing a big role on
this team," he said. "I think it's
just about adjusting to the next
level of college play."
However, the star of the Garnet
basketball show this season has
been 6'4" forward Matt Gustafson
'O5. Gustafson has picked up where
he left off last year, when he added
his name to the Swarthmore 1000Point Club and was regonized as

Lee's career-high night helps Garnet maul Bears
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

Now that it's December and is snowing
in some parts of the country, it's time for
Swat athletes to hang up their cleats and
head to the comfort of indoors for a great
winter pastime: basketball.
With a few new faces, the Garnet
women are back on the court and ready for
another shot at the Centennial Conference
title. After finishing 11-7 in the conference
last year and barely missing a spot in the
playoffs, Swarthmore aims to improve its
outcome this season after losing key contributor Katie Robinson 'O4 to graduation
but adding a number of talented first-years.
The Garnet women halted its two-game
losing skid Tuesday night, when the team
traveled to Ursinus for an important conference match-up. The Garnet got off to a
quick lead, going up 40-20 at halftime.
Despite stumbling early in the second half,
Swat was able to finish off the Bears 63-49.
Essential to the Tide's win was a seasonhigh 471 shooting percentage.
"We're getting it going offensively,"
Walters said. "Our shots were on [against
Ursinus]. We're playing together as team."
Tri-captain Kristen Lee 'O5 led the scoring drive against the Bears, tying her
career high with 18 points. Fifteen of her
points came in the first half. Jessica Fuhr
'O7 had 10 points for a career high, and

Berk, Walters, and tri-captain Alison Wolff
'O5 all contributed eight points. Debra
Farrelly 'O6 had five steals and six assists
in her strongest showing of the season.
"I think we had an amazing start,"
coach Adrienne Shibles said of the game.
"The women were really ready. Lee got us

24

started on the right foot." In terms of the
rest of the season, Shibles said the team is
focusing on each game as it comes and concentrating more on playing solid games
than on the individual wins and losses.
Last week, the women opened their season on a strong note against Immaeulata on
Nov. 19, destroying the Macs 76-39 m> the
first game of the Swat
Tournament.
Radiance Walters 'O6 powered the team
with 11 points and 12 rebounds, and Laura
Popovics 'OB led the squad with 13 points in
her first game for Swarthmore. The next
night, the Garnet fell to Mary Washington
61-52 in the tournament final despite coming out strong early to take a 24-20 lead at
halftime. The team struggled with shooting
in the match, hitting only 3L7 percent of its
field goals. Walters again was the key offensive force for the Tide, recording game
highs in points (21) and rebounds (13), numbers good enough to earn her a spot on the
All-Tournament team and recognition on
the week's Centennial Conference Honor
RoU.
In its first conference game of the season,
the Garnet lost a tough match at McDaniel
on Nov. 23. Despite out-rebounding the
nationally-ranked Green Terror 42-37,
Swarthmore once again struggled with hitting field goals and fell 66-49. Karen Berk 'OB
led the team with 13 points and 10 rebounds
and was rewarded with a place on the
Centennial Conference Honor Roll.
Lee, for one, sees a team that is headed
in the right direction and has a chance to
do big things this season. "We've got a lot
of potential," she said. "We work well

together." Though she was the leading
scorer in Swarthmore's win over the
Bears, Lee emphasized the contributions

made by all the players. "Every night it's
somebody different," she said. "We're a
very well-rounded team. I think we definitely have a chance to win the conference."
For now, the Garnet will be concentrating
on the annual Seven Sisters
Tournament this weekend held at neigh-

boring Bryn Mawr. Swarthmore will open
the tournament Friday night at 8 p.m.
against St. Josephs. "It's a long weekend.
Everybody has to come ready to play,"
Shibles said. But, she said, if all goes well
the Garnet could have a trophy to add to
the case come Sunday night. "I definitely
think we have the talent to win it all."
