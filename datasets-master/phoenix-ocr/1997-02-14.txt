Trotter Construction to Be Done by May
By

Min Lee

Sick of the ongoing construction work on campus?
Students will not have to put up with the hideous conditions for much longer, as one of the latest campus construction projects is coming to an end.
Trotter renovations are well on schedule, according to
Stuart Hain, Director of Facilities Management. The
building is due to be completed in mid-May. Hain hopes
to have the various academic departments move in a few
weeks before the beginning of the next academic year.
The renovations have reached the so-called "roughing
in" stage, said Hain, which means that the basic infrastructure of the building is in place. More specifically, the
partitioning in the building is complete, as well as theduct
work, plumbing and electrical wiring. At this stage, the

construction workers are focusing on the "dry-walling"
process.
The interior walls in Trotter are made by constructing
a metal framework along the sides of the building, and
attaching dry wall boards to the structure. The procedure
of smoothing out of the seams between boards through
applying tape and a chemical called "joint foundation" is
known as dry-walling. According to Hain, 80 percent of
the walls have been completed on the third floor, while 50
percent are done on second; the walls have yet to be
mounted on the first floor. On the other hand, most of the
windows on all floors have been installed. The next stage
a coat of primer
in the renovations will be spackling
paint will be applied to the dry walls, the floor leveled and
carpet laid, and finally, the ceiling put up. Right now all
the ducts and pipelines still remain exposed. Technicians

will be coming to install light switches, water sprinklers
and other fixtures.
Hain expects the construction itself to be finished in
May, after which the contractor will go through a "punch
list," inspecting the building for possible "flaws and
blemishes," which will take approximately a month.
Furniture will be moved in on July 7, while Hain expects
the academic departments to make the move sometime in
late August. The surrounding area
which, currently is
still very muddy will be prepared for landscaping over
Spring break. On the actual plans for the site, Jeff Jabco,
Director of Grounds, remarked, "By the time students
return next fall all the new sidewalks and paths around
Trotter will be in, and the soil graded." The turfareas will
also be planted at the same time, said Jabco, in order to
minimize the muddiness of the area.

The new Trotter building will no longer feature a
baserrieTfit; the surrounding soil which the former basement was submerged in has been cleared away. Exits on
both the east and west wings have been created on the new
first floor, and a new front doorway will be built for the
south entrance. The main staircase will be horizontal in
the layout, as opposed to opening in the direction of the
entrance.

The departments moving into Trotter are Classics,
History and Political Science, on first, second and third
floor respectively. A new computer classroom will be
created on the west wing ofthe secondfloor. The Writing
Associates Center will be relocated to the east wing of the
first floor. All three floors have a seminar room, while the

WSRN Receives Lots of
Applications; Gets Choosy

Local children gleefully tobaggan on the Swarthmore campus. Students also took time off from
studying earlier this week to enjoy outdoor recreation in the snow. Some tossed snowballs, others
careened down Parrish beach on red trays pilfered from Sharpies. The snow quickly melted in the
subsequent sun, but more snow is expected this weekend.

Due to an increase in the number of
students applying for the WSRN
shows and a decision to no longer
broadcast 24 hours a day, many students were denied time slots this semester. Nick Gisonda '97, Program
Director of WSRN, commenting on
the difficulty of the selection process, remarked, "the nine directors
sat and bickered for three hours."
According to Brian Scott' 97, General Manager of WSRN, 75 applications were picked up at the organizational meeting. An additional 15 applications were picked up at the
station's bulletin board. Approximately 25 students were not given
time slots for their shows.
The board selected students from
the applicant pool based on two main
factors. Broadcast experience was the
top criterion; several applicants had
as much as four or five semesters of
experience on WSRN.
The second selection factor was
the actual applications. Applicants
were asked to categorize their show

Tri-College News

Committee Works for Tri-Co Unity
By

Mandara Meyers

The Tri-College Committee, composed of students from Haverford, Bryn
Mawr and Swarthmore, is currently
working to implement changes that
will increase the unity of the schools.
In the past, the Tri-Co Committee has
been responsible for putting together
social events like Battle of the Bands
and parties for the three colleges. The
committee is now hoping to improve
interaction and create more of a real
community between the schools. Adam
Bucky, a member of the Tri-Co Committee, explained, "The members of
Tri-Co Committee have various different ideas for improving Tri-Co communication and unity."
One idea the committee is currently

working on is redoing the schedules for
the buses and vans that run between the
schools in order to make it easier for
students wishing to take classes at other
colleges within the consortium.
Other possibilities for the future include putting the course catalogs of
each of the schools on-line, thereby
making them accessible to students at
all three colleges and encouraging more
students to take advantage of the course
options. Students at Bryn Mawr and
Haverford currently receive eachother's
catalogs, but not Swarthmore's.
Another idea the committee has is to
plan activities for students from all three
schools during orientation week. Sarah
Tarlow, a Bryn Mawr student on the
Tri-Co Committee explained, "We are
hoping to implement a Tri-Co orienta-

tion for the first-years to try to break
down stereotypes and get people going
back and forth to each campus earlier.
They will be familiar and hopefully
even make friends at all three schools,
which may convince people to take
better advantage of our courses."
One problem with the Tri-Co Committee is Swarthmore's general apathy.
Bryn Mawr and Haverford's proximity
to each other facilitates more interaction between the two schools. But, as
Mary Harris, a sophomore at Bryn
Mawr, explained, "The big problem
with the Tri-Co system is that Swat
students have no reason to leave campus—unless they want to live in a language dorm, take Japanese, or major in
geology. We'd like everyone to be a
litle more Tri-Co minded... that's probably our biggest goal."
The Tri-Co Committee doesn't currently have a S warthmoremember.Last
semester, one Swarthmore student
served on the committee unofficially,
but the lack of a regular Swarthmore
student makes it difficult for the committee to make decisions involving all
three schools.

Swat's
importantly,
underrepresentation suggests a lack of
interest in increasing interaction with
Bryn Mawr and Haverford. Several
members of the current committee expressed their eagerness to find a
Swarthmore student to become a part of
the new planning.
According to Harris, the Tri-College
Committee is interested in finding anyone at Swarthmore who would be interested in planning activities for improving the Tri-Co system. Interested students who wish to find out more information should contact any current member of the Tri-Co Committee.

from a list of choices, including rock,
worldmusic, jazz,rap/hip-hop, blues,
folk, classical and news/non-music.
The application included a "pop quiz,"
which asked students to list ten songs
that they would play on their shows,
and students were asked to describe
their shows and request time slots.
According to Scott, the quality and
originality ofmusicchoices were important in the application process.
Applicants were also asked to request a time slot for their show. This
semester, WSRN will air shows between 7 a.m. and 3a.m. DJs have to
be available when WSRN typically
plays the type of music featured in
their show. Classical music is played
in the morning, jazz, blues, and folk
in the afternoon, and rock at night.
Most accepted applicants were given
their first choice time slot.
A large applicant pool is not the
only reason why WSRN had to reject
many applicants. The station has also
decided not to continue theirroundthe-clock program. This semester,
several applicants who were not given
a time slot opted to have a show after

2 a.m., but the WSRN directors did
not ask anyone to take

the time slots

from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m.
Eliminating the early morning
shows has left WSRN with only ten
slots a day, seven days a week. Some
of these slots are split into one-hour
segments, which results in a total of
73 shows each week. Fifteen of these
timeslots were already given to members of the WSRN board, who did not
have to submit written applications.
The WSRN board was surprised
with the large number and high quality of applicants this semester. The
board is incredibly pleased with the
variety of shows that will air. "This
schedule is the best we've ever had,"
said Gisonda, "There are some great
new talk shows, a wonderful news
show, and more classical, bluegrass,
and world music this semester."
At the same time, Scott said, "I and
the rest of the WSRN board regret
that so many potential DJs had to be
refused. They and anyone else interested in broadcasting at Swarthmore
are encouraged to apply again in coming semesters."

Odetta, American Folk
Legend, Performs Tonight
By

Gabriel Cumming

Odette: one name, many talents. A folk singer and
social activist, Odette is currently teaching"Music as
Social History" at Swarthmore. Odetta is a major
figure in American folk music, and her success has
been cultivated and developed through her immersion in American social history. She performs at 8
p.m. tonight in the Lang Performing Arts Center.
Odette's musical background is deep and varied.
"In grammar school, someone discovered that I had
a voice," she said. This was an important turning
point in Odette's life: "[Had] that teacher not discovered and told my mother about my voice, I don't
know if I would even have thought to [sing]. Probably not, because when growing up I was a very shy
person—to the point of being backward." The disPhoto by Joanne Savio
covery, once made, was not forgotten. "At thirteen I
became serious about studying...voice." Pop, gospel, and rhythm and blues were all aroundher during
this period but "when I studied music I was really a snob—if it wasn't classical, it wasn't."
During Odette's early years in Los Angeles she heard many great musicians perform live in local
concert halls, including Count Basic "The soundof theband...was lush," Odette saidofCountBasie's
Orchestra. She considered herself fortunate to have been "growing up at the end of the big band
era...The classical pop ballads were really crafted beautifully," and Duke Ellington was "such an
elegant figure."
Two great singers of the period, Marian Anderson and Paul Robeson, were particularly important
to young Odetta as examples ofAfrican-Americans achieving fame and fortune. "[We] heard about
them with much pride." Odetta took pride in the fact that "in spite of the prejudices and biases in this
country, someone of us got out there."
A second turning point came in San Fransisco where Odetta encountered "bohemians," the group
she characterized as laterbecoming the Beats and then the Hippies. "Weirdos...that's what we were."
For Odetta this was a time of new musical exploration: "people would play guitars" for hours on end.
She discovered this "wealth of songs...songs that addressed my anger, frustration, fury..."
Odetta began singing these songs, both at fundraisers for various causes and at a series of clubs.
Other musicians in the folk tradition, including Guthrie, Seeger, Dylan, andBernice Reagan (of Sweet
Honey in the Rock) have influenced and worked with Odette. In 1956 she released her first album
Sings Ballads and Blues, which sent ripples through the music community. Dylan later said: "The first
thing that turned me on to folk music was Odette. I heard [her first album]...l went out and traded my
electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar..."
Odetta has continued to be an influential force in the definition of folk. Many are moved by her
voice and style, which in turn has been influenced by vibrant traditions in American music. She has
become a part of this tradition, and continues to leave her mark upon it.

Dialogues on diversity begin
Dialogues are forming around campus. "A Dialogue is a small group
discussion...in which people bring articles, poems, and videos from
which to begin discussions" about race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality, and religion, said Amy Albert '9B, a Dialogues coordinator and
facilitator of last semester's Race and Ethnicity study groups.
According to Albert, Dialogues are a means to "make underlying
tensions on campus explicit and face them," in order to make Swat a
more comfortable place. They are sponsoredby Diversity Umbrella and
inspired by study groups started by SASS two years ago. There are a
variety of Dialogues to choose from, with various meeting times and

No

sub-free halls next year

Unless students convince the Housing Committee that there's a good
reason to offer substance-free housing, there will be no sub-free halls
next year, the committee decided Monday night.
Committee member Laura Gitelson '97 said students must file
petitions in favor of sub-free housing by February 28. If no petitions are
filed, or if the petitions fail to convince the committee that sub-free
housing is worthwhile, the College will no longer designate halls on
which residents promise not to use cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs.
Gitelson explained that the Housing Committee believes many
residents of substance-free halls are not committed to promoting
substance-free social activities. "One of the reasons not to have subfree housing is the fact that the College does not cater to other lifestyles
which you might consider as important as sub-free
anything from a
foreign language hall to a sexual orientation hall," added Tinsley Davis
'9B, a housing committee member who is also the resident assistant in
Dana basement, this year's only sub-free hall.
Petitions for substance-free halls will have to convince Housing
Committee not only that many students want sub-free housing, but that
there's a good reason for wanting the option. "In addition to numbers,
we want to see a decent argument for why it should exist," Gitelson said.
Gitelson said the February 28 deadline was set to give the RA
Selection Committee time to pick RAs for sub-free halls if necessary.
She said students planning to petition for sub-free halls should notify
Myrt Westphal, Director of Residential Life, as soon as possible so the
RA Selection Committee can plan ahead.

Re-entry groups help students acclimate
A re-entry group for students returning from leave has been created
by Sonja Shield '97 and Megin Charner '97 in order to ease the
adjustment period that such students face and "serve as a support
system," according to Charner. The group began last semester; the
concept was motivated by Shield and Charner's experiences after
going abroad last fall. Says Charner, "Both Sonjaand I went away last
fall and found that coming back was definitely more tumultuous than
we had expected."
Upon their return, Shield and Charner found support from themselves and others who had undergone the same experience.
Among the many challenges to returning students is the "difficulty
in [fitting in] immediately, with friends because they have already
established theirpatterns during the previous semester," says Charner.
Another difficulty returnees encounter is the re-adjustment to Swat's
working conditions. While abroad, students may be exposed to
"vastly different academic experiences," according to Charner, and
their arrival at school may well make them feel like frosh all over
again. This semester, there are around 50 students returning from
leave and the group has held four meetings.
Dan Green, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, and Nick Attanasio contributed to these briefs.

SC Decides Some Appointments;
Second Round Stili Necessary
By

Aarti Iyer

Student Council co-chair Naomi Michlin '9B
all-campus e-mail last week to announce a second round of applications to fill
vacant seats on various College Committees.
According to Josh Alloy '9B, an SC member who
currently chairs the Appointments Committee,
some positions were left unfilled after the first
round simply because not enough people applied. "This is not unusual," he explained, "In the
three years I've been here, we've had second
rounds of applications almost every semester."
Usually, there have been enough applications
during the second round to fill vacant positions.
There were some positions that were filled
during the first round. According to Alloy, almost every person got the position they were
applying for. The only position for which there
was some serious competition was for Curriculum Committee, for which four people ran.
The following appointments were made during the first round: Amber Halsey '9B, Ben
Hanani 'OO, Isiuwa Iyahen 'OO, and I-Lien Tsay
'99 were appointed to Budget Committee; David
Adler 'OO was appointed to Curriculum Committee; Melissa Morrell '99 was appointed to Student Activities Committee; Jared Miller 'OO and

"I definitely urge students to run forany and all

and integral to the maintenance of the College."

Rumors About Room Changes Explained
By

Nick Attanasio

Contrary to rumors of an increase in empty

rooms, Director of Residential Life Myrt
Westphal said that, proportionally, room abandonmentrates are "the same or less" compared to
other years.
Traditionally, the spring semester always sees
an increase in the number of vacancies, says
Westphal. Compared to last semester, she says
that there are "about 30 more empty rooms;" a
typical number for the second semester and one
that is "certainly equal to previous years."
Westphal also suggested that the unusual size
of this year's freshman class may inflate the
numbers, though the actual percentage of housing changes is unremarkable.
Another misleading factor may be the number
of students on leave during spring semester as
well as students moving off campus. The increased availability of rooms second semester
has also led to room switching by roommates and

single occupants moving into more desirable
quarters on campus, thus increasing the overall
number of room changes.
Sophomore roommate conflicts are probably
as much a cause of room changes as are second
semester freshmen personality conflicts, says
Westphal. She asserts that when students first
begin to pick their own roommates, their choices
are not necessarily any better than those of the
college. Many sophomores just pick a good
friend for a roommate and "don't pick based on
personal habits."
Though Westphal herselfusually assigns roommates, this year Jen Leigh, Director of Student
Activities, made the decisions with the aid of
both Dean Tedd Goundie and Westphal.
Westphal says Leigh did "a good job" pairing
roommates.

The empty rooms are "reasonably sprinkled
out" all over campus according to Westphal
though the most vacancies occur in the Lodges,
and in Worth.

One More Thing.

Some members of the College community let out a sigh ofrelief upon their
first look at the early admissions numbers for next year's class. There had
been speculation that the numbers of students of color who applied and were
admitted would drop in contrast to the excellentreturns from last year (which
were boosted by extensiverecruitment strategies on the part ofadmissions of
officers previous to the admissions process).
At a first glance, the rise from 11 to 30 students ofcolor accepted during the
early admissions process is encouraging though there was a very small pool
of international students admitted. In her comments to The Phoenix, Admissions Director Robin Mamlet seemed enthusiastic about the diversity of the
early applicants, stating that it was an especially good number considering the
fact that students of color do not tend to apply early to Swarthmore and in
national trends, do not tend to apply early anywhere in the country.
Upon a second look, the numbers are not quite so encouraging. As opposed
to the 110 applicants who were accepted through early admissions last year,
148 students were accepted. These students were involved in a binding
admissions process and therefore, virtually all of those students will come to
Swarthmore in the fall. The class for next year is projected at 350 as opposed
to the more than 400 students in the class of 2000 this year. This means that
the numberof spaces which have been leftopen forall students, but especially
students ofcolor and international students, in the regular admissions process
will be sparse. Moreover, our ranking for competitiveness will go up because
such a small percentage of regular admissions applicants will be admitted.
In the end, we could certainly end up with a class which is nearly as diverse
as the class of 2000. However, we have to worry about the way admissions
procedures for this year were designed. This year marked the reinstatement
ofthe double installment early admissions program. This year there were two
dates for early admissions, one in November and one in January, while last
year we had only one early admissions date. This decision increased the
number of early acceptances dramatically. While the number of early admittances went up, the number of admittances in total went down.
All of these decisions were made withthe knowledge that students ofcolor
tend to apply during the regular admissions process. While we are not at all
convinced that the decisions were made with this fact in mind, as a small
liberal arts college with a less than perfect record in terms of race-relations,
Swarthmore must work to insure that our admissions policies promote
diversity.

Collections are integral to

our community

Until 1974, Collections were obligatory events. That's right, until a few
years before most of us were born, the Swarthmore College community—which included students, faculty, staff and administration—was required to
go to every single Collection that was held. In 1974 the rule was changed
because it made Collections out to be these dull required events; people just
didn't enjoy going to them anymore.
The Collections that were held the next few years after that change were
pretty bad, to say the least. They occurred sporadically, and were primarily
lectures. Then, two years ago, in response to student complaints about the lack
of decent, regularly scheduled Collections, the College put together a Committee on Community (from the College Planning Committee) to discuss how
to improve Collections and increase their frequency.
They picked a time during the day that they felt was most suitable for
people—faculty, staff and students—on campus to attend. They rearranged
the class schedule so that all students and faculty had a block of time open
between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m.
But still Collections have been rather sporadic for the last two years. Even
when they are scheduled, attendance is often poor.
That's why this semester has been so refreshing. There has been a Collection every single week. Not only that, but the Collections have been remarkably interesting, targeting different parts of the College community. So far,
we've heard from the inspirational Swarthmore alumnus Eugene Lang '3B,
founder of the "I Have a Dream" foundation, watched and been entertained
by performance artist Ruby Dee, and debated the College's financial aid
policies. Although it has fluctuated, attendance at these Collections has been
quite strong, and students, faculty, and staff have given positive reviews.
It would also be interesting to see more future Collections that focus on the
acheivements ofalumni. We are constantly told that our Swarthmore education will take us in any direction, for any distance. It would be great to learn
more about the specific paths that the lives of alumni have taken.
Collections are an integral part of our heritage as a Quaker school. We all
know that our community is rarely allowed to come together as such: the new
faculty-only lounge in Kohlberg is only the most explicit example of this
chasm between the levels at the College. But Collections are an opportunity
for everyone at the College to come together at the same level in the true
Quaker spirit—for housecleaning staffand students to sit together side by side
and enjoy the same lecture or performance or join in the same discussion.

Corrections
In last week's issue, the front page photo of Sally was not credited; it was
taken by Fang Cai. On page 7, the photo of the women's badminton team in
action was mistakenly credited to Susan Hunt. It was taken by Jared Miller.
In the article on Professor Graybill's case against the University of
California at Berkeley published on January 24, the author mistakenly
indicated that both Graybill and her colleague accepted the ninth year offer
and subsequently applied for tenure. In fact, the latterdecided against staying
for a ninth year and proceeded to sue the school directly. Also, the Title IX
officer had first contacted Graybill while the review process was taking place
during her eighth year to notify her of the administration's investigation, not
after the decision to deny tenure was made.

Euthanasia May Mean Insurance Profits
By

Diversity in admissions needs to be maintained

.

Vincent Jones

Soon the Supreme Court will decide whether or not terminally ill
patients have the right to die. Dr.
Kevorkian
and his crusade to help
the suffering end their
pain have
brought this
issue into
the limelight and
through the
judicial systern to the
high court.
Euthanasia has raised several questions and divided the nation much
like the debate on abortion. Many
organizations and individuals ranging from the American Medical Association to the Christian Coalition
have come out in support of and
against allowing doctor-assisted suicide.
Regardless of what you believe on
the issue, the inconsistency ofAmerican policies dealing with death must
be recognized and seriously exam-

ined. Presently, women can elect to
abort a fetus and states can terminate
the lives of criminals convicted of
capital crimes. Yet terminally ill patients cannot decide to die with dignity and without incurring a great
deal of debt.
Granted, a woman's right to choose
and the deathpenalty have generated
a great deal of controversy of their
own. Nonetheless, both remain legal.
Also, one cannot easily ignore the
fact that abortion, physician-assisted
suicide, and the death penalty involve many different legal and constitutional issues. Despite these facts,
two glaring connections between the
three issues stick out in my mind.
The sanctity of a human life and
the beliefthat the procedure results in
the murder of an unborn child lie at
the core of much anti-abortion sentiment. Opponents ofthe death penalty
liken capital punishment to state-sanctioned murder.
At the same time, people against
doctor-assisted suicide feel that terminally ill patients will not receive
the best quality care available and
will be euthanized far too often if the
Supreme Court legalizes this practice. Thus, in each instance, the sane-

tity of a human's life rests at the heart
of the matter. Yet the fact that judges
can sentence citizens convicted of
capital crimes to death, women can
elect to abort pregnancies and terminally ill patients do not currently posses the right to die suggest that the
law views some lives as more valuable than others. Or does it mean
something else?
This brings me to the second similarity between these controversial issues—life insurance. A woman cannot receive life insurance for an
aborted child and, to my knowledge,
a prisoner's family receives jio financial compensation (or concern at all)
in return for the loss of a loved one. If
the Supreme Court overturns state
laws prohibiting physician-assisted
suicide, will family members of the
deceased beable to cash in their loved
ones' life insurance policies?
In my opinion, this question colors, to some extent, the debateamong
the powers that be. Consider the
amounts of money insurance firms
contribute to political action committees, directly to candidates or to
political parties. We all know that the
millions of dollars spent by insurance
companies for political purposes

comes with some strings attached. It
provides them with greater access to
the halls of power and significant
influence over the drafting of legislation which affects them.
Legalizing doctor-assisted suicide
affects insurance companies concerned with theirbottom-line. Ifthousands of terminally ill patients with
life insurance afflicted with AIDS,
cancer or some other disease decide
to forgo the painful and expensive
medical treatment and die on their
own terms, insurance companies will
have to pay out a larger amount of
money than usual. Moreover, they
will have to incorporate such expenditures in their budget forecasts and
pass off a majority of the increased
costs to customers through higher
premiums. This would, in turn, ignite
a series of feedback loops.
Now I don't profess to be an authority on this issue or on the intricacies of the health insurance system. I
merely made an observation that I
wanted to share in hopes of stimulating discussion and to encourage
people to question the consistency of
their beliefs. We often point out contradictions in the arguments ofothers
but rarely in our own.

Swarthmore Students Need to Get Real
By

Brian Gobin

As I was walking past Cornell, I
saw some scribbles on the sidewalk
and was curious ifanybody actually
said something entertaining. As usual,
it was something boring. What really
annoyed me was this big sidewalk
scribble thatread "screw hypocrisy."
Not that I'm an advocate of hypoc-

risy.
It's just that you have to wonder
about the mindset of people who
scrawl things like that on sidewalks.
In general, are juvenile delinquent
scribbles on the sidewalk supposed
to raise anybody's consciousness? I
think there should be a rule in the
handbook saying that "Sidewalk
scribbles can only be written as directional signs to alcohol, food, or
entertainment."
Instead of college students wasting
time talking about their idealistic fantasies among each other, why don't
they taketheir tactics and beliefs into
the real world where it mightactually
make a difference. I dare somebody
to scribble these stupid messages in
the Ville. And for those people who
do leave the hill every once in a
while, they need to ask themselves if
they are accomplishing anything. If
yes, great. If not, then you might want
to think about why.
For those working on the outside,
I'll give you a short list of things that
usually do not count as productive
activities: 1) class, race, and ethnicity
conscienceness raising, 2) awareness,
3) protests. Unless these activities
are part ofa strategy to provide socioeconomic uplift, then they are probably a waste of time.
One ofthe reasons I came here was
because the students were socially
conscious. Indeed, this is true about
Swarthmore. But once here, I had to
figure out why a number of people
really confused me. I mean, in theory
at least, I should be quite content
around all these issue-oriented people.
Obviously, I'm not, and here are
some of the reasons why: 1) Clothier
Tower Syndrome (CTS): This terrible affliction usually hits issue-oriented high school graduates as soon
as they reach campus. CTS is sort of
mental claustrophobia caused by
never being more than one mile from
Clothier Tower. Symptoms include
delusions about the Parrish Administration building being the center of
the universe. Victims of CTS are
prone to scribble on sidewalks and
make an issue out of everything, including the faculty lounge. CTS tends
to be a disease afflicting white middleupper class youth who have no real
experience in the world. CTS is extremely contagious and is usually
spreadby prolonged dialogues, seminars, reading of new age garbage, and
yuppy foods.
2) Awareness: Some people at
Swarthmore are always trying to make
you aware of something. Basically,
they think that scribbling on sidewalks and putting up flyers with simplistic messages will somehow make
a difference and raise people's consciousness. These folks have forgotten that the admissions staff selected
people who could read very well. In
fact, I'm so literate that I read The
New York Times once in a while and
get a much more thoughtful presentation of information than anything ever
scribbled on the sidewalks.

3) Naivete: Here are some things
that people say that really annoy the
hell out of me. "Oh gosh, everybody
is equal, and we should all work on a
consensus basis." Try sitting down
five people with very different viewpoints, and see if you can get them to
agree on anything. Have you ever
noticed that Congress has a real hard
time passing legislation? See, even a
group of mostly white males doesn't
agree on much.
For all our super-consensus-loving-democratic morons, people in
society form organizations and hierarchies so decisions can be made and
things can get done. Justbecause you
don't like the person controlling a
hierarchy doesn't mean hierarchies
should not exist.

4) 3rd WorldSyndrome: Each time
that I pull a cold can of Pepsi out of
the fridge, do you think I take time to
consider that Pepsico has investments
in Burma that might be contributing
to slavery? Of course not. I think, boy
what a good deal at Acme—12 cans
for $1.99. Besides, Pepsi is bottled
locally. I think the only reason why
white liberalish people care about
Third World people is because they' re
tired of dealing with minorities in
their own country. It's sort ofescapism to worry about Amazon Indians
and Mexican peasants when they are
so far away that you don't have to
worry about one of them mugging
you or getting your job.
Let's justbe real, there is very little
that college students can do to change

backward policies in backward countries, so their concern must be driven
by some domestic issue—how to feel
good about themselves without actually doing anything productive. So
much for "screw hypocrisy."
It's amazing how some people are
so "concerned" about people on the
other side of the globe and don't have
a clue about how to deal with domestic issues at their back door. That's
typical American arrogance: "We
know what's best about your domestic policy, and our domesticsituation
is all rosy."
As a final word, I hope neither
Brian Schwartz nor an IO Frosh (issue-oriented freshman) wastes space
by bothering to respond to my article.
I'm way out of your paradigm.

Letter to the Editor
The Godfather Review Betrays Film's Brilliance and Demeans Actors
To the Editor:
I would like to express indignation
over the way in which The Godfather
was portrayed by your reviewers last
week. Such writing diminishes what
is a true work of art while conveying
a totally false impression of the film
itself.
A reader who has never seen the
first two Godfather films will put
down your article feeling absolutely
no desire to see the movies. Classifying The Godfather as "one of the
classic Mafia movies of all time" is
absurd. Of course it is, since it was
released in 1972 (a year in time) and
is about the Mafia.
To portray the two films as comparable to Goodfellas, Casino, and Oscar is like classifying Citizen Kane
as a great movie about the press, right
alongside The Paper. These are films
which obliterate genre. The Godfather parts I and II stand with Kane,
Dr. Strangelove, and Taxi Driver at
the pinnacle of Hollywood artistic
achievement.
In fact, that amazing period from
1964 to 1977 reached its zenith in
1974withpart II ofThe Godfather, as
Coppola stretches all epic conventions to create an epic masterpiece which simultaneously
explores the deepest recesses of
the soul. These are personal films
in the grandest sense.
Warning the readers of impending brutality doesn't further the cause of bringing viewers in either. The violence is not
the point. As PaulineKael points
out in ,her review in The New
there is a need to see the
violence. Coppola plunges the
viewer so deep into the minds of
every single character that there
is more than voyeurism in watching these acts unfold. There is a
sense ofcompletion. These characters would seem incomplete if
the violence were separated from
their personas. The violence
seeps into us just as it seeps into
them, corrupting and destroying their humanity.
This corruption is the point of
The Godfather. There is no
simple morality here, but rather
an examination ofthe extent that
one will go to in order to protect

his family.
Part II is so devastating because of
this; the flashbacks constantly remind
the viewer that this monstrosity is
what Michael has sacrificed himself
for. In the process of trying to protect
his family, Michael is destroyed by
his own power, isolating himselffrom
all that ever mattered to him.
This is what the viewer cares
about—a character we identify with,
falling apart before our eyes. Referring to James Caan' s, Robert Duvail' s
or Diane Keaton's hair cuts and giving away the plot does an injustice to
the film and to the viewer.
I have one final grievance with
your article. It states, "You should
see this movie, just for Marlon
Brando..." Excuse me? Did Al
Pacino's character get lost along the
way somewhere? I seem to remember theentire trilogyrevolving around
his corruption and quest for redemption.
Pacino's Michael is the true character of these films. Initially, and in
the dancing scene with Apollonia especially, Pacino exudes a youthful
innocence, but by the end of part I he

stands arrogantly before us, having
his hand kissed.
Part II immediatelyplunges us back
into the horror and Pacino looks like
he is rotting before our veryeyes. The
role is nearly impossible, entirely internal, and his performance is of the
highest order. We can see all the
anger, power, and longing in him but
he never betrays his true feelings. It is
the most complicated and terrifying
performance I have ever encountered.
Over his career, Pacino has given
us five performances which define
the role he is in, which is more than
can be said for Brando, DeNiro, or
Hoffman.Brando's Don Vitois rightfully famous, for itis a wonderfuland
memorable impersonation, but
Pacino's Michael is a living being
who still exists in the mind and stomach of anybody who has seen him.
In the future, please refrain from
writing about art in such a superficial
and degrading manner. If you feel the
need to do a plot summary, do so for
Evita ox Beverly Hills Cop, but don't
trivialize one of the few great accomplishments ofcinema.

Opinions
Student Council Platforms
The candidatesrunning for Student Council were asked: "How,
if at all, would you change the
structure of SC?" The answers
are printed below.

Jeannie Gallego
One of the main issues that I believe needs improvement is the lack
of the interaction between the students and SC members.This past semester, I don't believe that I have
been made sufficiently aware of the
issues that arose in SC meetings and
how [and if] they were dealt with and
resolved. The primary reason that
Council hasn't been a contributor in
making student voices heard is not
because the SC hasn't had many accomplishments, but because of its
interaction with students. This absence of communication should and
must be transformed so that there can
exist a constant connection. This can
be accomplished through a variety of
methods, such as the reinstallment of
a suggestion board. This will make
Council aware of students' opinions
so that the members can be better
representatives of the students by
accurately reflecting these opinions
to the administration. The opinions
and ideas offered by the students
should also be actively collected by
the members.as opposed to just waiting for people to come up to them
with input. There should also be
more accessible and publicized meetings so that the students can also be
involved in learning about issues
that concern the students themselves
and so that they would be able to
express their viewpoints to a receptive audience who hold positions
where something can be done about
issues.

Mandara Meyers
Student Council has recently been
grappling with the issue of creating a
consensus within the group. Several
meetings have been devoted to this
topic, and at their retreat just before
the start of classes, they actually
worked with a "consensus builder" to
provide insight into the process.
In my opinion, the only effective
way for Student Council to work is
through consensus. A situation in
which the majority vote wins implies
that there is still an unheard minority
whose views will not be expressed at

all in the ultimate decision. While it
is clearly impossible to please everyone through the process of achieving
consensus, the very process suggests
an essential component of working
together on a common goal.
Compromise is an integral part of
working in a group; it is not enough to
be a good leader without also being
able to listen and at least partially
accept other views.
It is important to recognize that
Student Council represents a myriad
of opinions. Like any other meeting
of ideas, the process is as important
as the eventual outcome. Swarthmore
is a school of strong thinkers and
leaders; many of us are accustomed
to being right and getting our way.
Yet this attitude does not provide
effective group leadership.
One of my main reasons for running for a position on Student Council is my desire to bring a diversity
both of opinion and of experience to
the Council. Added diversity, however, accomplishes nothing unless a
forum exists in which this diversity
can be heard. Thus, I feel it is imperative that Student Council work to
coalesce the diverse opinions of its
members in order to come up with
some semblance of a representative
decision on each and every issue it
tackles. I recognize that this is not
necessarily the most efficientmethod
of solving problems, but I sincerely
believe that it is the method most
suitable to the ideals of Swarthmore
College.

Michael Klunder
Despite the fact that this is supposed to be a platform, I don'tintend
to present one. Since the appointments committee serves the college
administrative process in a supporting capacity rather than functioning
as part of that body, one's personal
views and biases should not regularly
come into play in making appointments.

And as such I feel that the presentation of a platform for the position of
appointments committee Chair is not
very appropriate, outside of explaining my position on the question of
restructuring SC: I feel that while the
consolidation of the many committees that compose SC may improve
efficiency and streamline the council, before considering any sort of
restructuring a way must be foundto

promote student involvement in its

workings.
Which leads me to the commitment I offer in lieu of a platform. I
feel very strongly about the body of
committees that allows our involvement in the administration of our
college and if elected Chair of the
appointments committee, I'll be thoroughly dedicated to providing all the
support for that process in my power.
There's not much more to say.

FordO'Connell
Last year Swarthmore students
demanded more representation on
student council last. We lobbied for
more representation in the decisions
affecting all aspects of college life.
Student Council worked and achieved
that greater voice last year. All they
asked was that students, who were
both interested and qualified, step
forward and assume the duties and
responsibilities that these new freedoms entailed. However, when the
time came, precious few answered
the call. Why?
Perhaps, the answer is apathy.
Maybe Swarthmore students really
don't care about influencing the world
around them, but we all know that
isn't true. I know there are people out
there who, if given the opportunity,
would do an excellent job on any of
the committees.
My role, as Appointments Chair,
would be to insure that these qualified people can fill these positions.
Too many people say that they would
love to be on Student Council, but
they missed the deadline, or simply
didn'tknow that an election was coming up. I feel that by informing a
greater percentage of the student
body, we can make sure that we have
acompetent, hard-working, and dedicated Student Council. We need all
the people who would normally refrain from participating in this process to become involved now. It is
unfair to complain about the problems without becoming involved in a
solution. This is something thatI have
learned frommy Swarthmore experience. Rather than complaining with
the current structure or acting improperly due to frustration, I have
been convinced ofthe significance of
working within the system and correct any of the improprieties and injustice that is created by its inefficiency.

Appointments Committee
The candidates running for Appointments Chair were asked:
"How would you structure and
enforcethe Appointments process,
and how is this different than the
old process, if at all?" The answers are printed below.

Jeannie Gallego
As many of you may know, the
person in the position of Appointments chair has the responsibility to
decide whom shouldbe elected to the
several committees that influence our
lives directly or indirectly. The importance of this position lies in the
selection of dedicated people willing
to give their time and effort for a
cause. I don't
believe that the
Student Council keeps in touch as
much with the smaller committees
due to its concentration on larger
issues. What is important to consider
is that the effectiveness of these
groups are essential for improvements in that particular area and also
have a resulting impact on other
places.
My goal is to keep these committees more involved with Student
Council so that there can be an awareness of the influence that these committees hold. One suggestion that
hasn't been tried in the past is to have
representatives from these committees come in and keep the Council
informed of their progress.
These meetings will serve to

strengthen relations between the two.

Michael Klunder
Despite the fact that this is supposed to be a platform, I don't intend
to present one. Since the appointments committee serves the college
administrative process in a supporting capacity rather than functioning
as part of that body one's personal
views and biases should not regularly
come into play in making appointments. And as such I feel that the
presentation of a platform for the
position of appointments committee
Chair is not very appropriate. Rather
than that, I will use this space to make
a commitment. I feel very strongly
about the body of committees that
allows our involvement in the administrationof our college and if elected
Chair of the appointments committee, I'll be thoroughly dedicated to
providing all the support for thatprocess in my power. There's not much
more to say.

FordO'Connell
Specifically, my first priority would
be to facilitate the availability of information to the student body. This
would include the requirements of
each position and the number of vacant positions available. What are the
best methods to present information
to students? It is time to take the
initiative and support a web-page for

student council thatwould include all
relevant information for committee
appointments. Furthermore, students
should have the opportunity to view a
separate appointments bulletin board
that is clear, well-constructed, and
user-friendly. Of course, my personal number would be posted on the
bulletin so that students could call me
forany additional questions and concerns.
We must curtail the nit-picking that
has hindered Student Council processes in the past. The best way to
attain communal involvement is by
diversifying theface ofStudentCouncil. Different people mean different
perspectives. Involving people who
would not otherwise participate in
the process of Student Council will
enable us to attain higher objectives
by having more perspectives to con-

sider.

As Appointments Chair, I would
have some direct bearing on theCommittee on Educational Planning, College Budget Committee, and College
Planning. These three committees
directly influence the future of all
Swarthmore students. Therefore, it is
essential that people who are sound
representatives of the greater student
body help propel us into the next
millennium. Swarthmore requires
individuals who have the capability
of ascertaining current problems,
implementing pragmatic solutions,
and foreshadowing the obstacles of
the future.

Postmodernism Not Sufficient
By

Mark Charette

Is "elite" academic thought relevant to today's social problems?

After a weary day spent reading the
stuffy prose wafting off the keyboards
of American critical theorists shoehorned inside boxes wallpapered with
the disjointed English translations of
their French predecessors, an easy
"no" comes impulsively. From a distance, elite academia looks like an
ivory sanitarium with padded rooms
housing burnt-out and would-be politicos who strike so much fear into
conservative corporations that they
pour billions of dollars into the construction of self-contained environments (Phillip Morris, in which the
College holds a $9,977 million investment—good Quaker values—has
doled out generous gifts as a thank
you note) where the dissidents can
funnel their rebellious energy into
convoluted rantings so illegible to
the outside world that they alienate
all potential allies.
That was the rash oversimplification I carriedinto Swarthmore, which
I have slowly learned to abandon. A
closerlook at therelationships among
academic theory, public policy and
economic conditions in urban
America reveals a scenario more
alarming than the intellectual madhouse seen from afar. Historically,
one of the most disturbing trends in
elite academia has been our affection
for the All-Encompassing Explanation. Marxism, New Criticism,
Postmodernism. While none of these
theories has been fully accepted, they
have rarely been placed in their proper
context before being applied to virtually everything. The implications
have often been disastrous.
The Modernism envisioned by the
French architectLe Corbusier —long
lines ofuniform towers separated by
may have ofparks and freeways
fered a salient model of community
for the French. But while the French
government rejected most of the
architect's proposals in favor of preserving traditional architectural districts, American scholars jumped on
theLe Corbusier bandwagon without
considering the applicability of the
architect's understanding of culture
to American society.
Enchanted by the sweeping symmetrical beauty of Le Corbusier's
theoretical landscapes, the U.S. government razed predominantly African-American neighborhoods across
the country as part of an "Urban Re-

development" program which displaced homesand locally owned businesses with uniform towers and lowrise apartment complexes often
flanked by freeways (the parks were
substantially reduced from Le
Corbusier's model). Residents
weren't asked if the projects would
suit their social or economic needs. It
was assumed that inner-city communities couldn't possibly graspthe auspices of the momentous step toward
civility being handed to them taxfree.
While the mainstream media hails
the strength of the nation's economy
and D'nesh D'souza proclaims the
"End of Racism," joblessness is still
near all time highs in the communities subjected to the brick experiments inspired by Le Corbusier
evidence that academic theory has an
effect on larger society.
Many of us would like to believe
the decay perpetuated by housing
projects is a remnant of a withering
parochial relationship between "elite"
academia and inner-city poor, especially poor African-Americans.
Postmodern theory has enveloped
American campuses, ushering in an
era of detachment in which material
reality is conceptualized as a flexible
instrument at the fingertips of the
theorist. Actions have become "performances" in which each individual
uses his orher"selfconstruction identity kit" to "construct" an identity fit
for presentation.
Before hailing a "postmodern" age
in which gender, race and sexual preference are no longer binding realities
placed on the bodies of women,
people of color and homosexuals by
a White male power structure, we
should carefully examine the theory' s
applicability to American society in
light of the disastrous effects of Le
Corbusier's modernist fantasy.
While it is important to recognize
that historically oppressive categories are systematically created rather
than genetically apparent, this has
been obvious to many members of
American society for hundreds of
years. Puzzling over our (elite
academia's) discovery like a rare gem
only spotlights our distance from the
people who must deal with the implications of being a "construct." As
wealth continues to concentrate in
the top tier of American families, it
becomes easy for a privileged student in a predominantly upper-middle
class setting like Swarthmore to believe in the mirage of postmodernity.

Letter to the Editor
To the Editor:
It has been brought to our attention
that Screw Your Roommate, one of
the most highly anticipated social
events of the spring semester, has
been scheduledfor February 22,1997.
As you are well aware, over one hundred and fifty students (as well as
theirrespective dates) will be unable
to attend this event due to their athletic commitments to the swimming,
indoor track, men's basketball,
women's basketball and wrestling
teams. We are also aware that the
Sager party, sponsored by the Sager
Symposium and the Swarthmore
Queer Union, has been scheduled for
the following weekend, March 1,
1997, and that Tarble In Clothier has
been reserved for this event.
In writing this letter, it is our intention to draw your attention to the
large number of students, athletes
and non-athletes, who are displeased
withthe current scheduling of Screw,
many of whom have signed below, as
well as to suggest alternatives which
would enable the entire student body
to participate in what is intended to
be an all-campus event.
We are aware that SAC had considered scheduling Screw on the same
day as the Sager party, March 1, but
that SAC found this option to be
unreasonable due to a lack of space
and aconcern thatattendance at Screw

would be depleted as many students
would choose, instead, to attend
Sager. It has also been brought to our
attention that SQU is aware of the
current conflict, that they have been
asked to relinquish Tarble, and that
they have refused.
In an effort to resolve this conflict,
we would like to suggest that SAC
investigate the possibility of using
Sharpies as a space in which to hold
Screw on March 1. We are aware of
the extra cost involved in order to
have Sharpies cleaned after the party,
which may make this a less desirable
option. In an effort to overcome this
problem, it has been suggested that
the athletes offer their own time to
clean up after the event. Ifwewereto
do so, we would essentially be paying to attend a free all-campus event.
SAC does not ask the general student
body to clean up after formals or
other SAC funded events in order
that they may attend, so there is no
reason that this should be asked of
these athletes.
The most preferable option, due to
the current scheduling ofSager, would
be to reschedule Screw for a weekend
after spring break. There are two
reasons why we find this the most
desirable option: first, having both
Sager and Screw before break, within
a week of each other, would leave
only one heavily attended all-cam-

Candidate for the Council on Educational Policy
The candidate running for the
CEP was asked: "What is the most
important issue facing the CEP
and how would you implement
your solution to this problem?"
The answer is printed below.

Mandara Meyers
Last spring, the Council on Educational Policy released a report on
President Bloom's request identifying topics they deemed central to
Swarthmore's long-term academic
planning. The six areas they selected

as crucial to long-range planning were

distributionrequirements, innovation
in the curriculum, community-based
learning, technology, support for the
teacher-scholar, theHonors program,
diversity of the College, and size of
the College.
To me, virtually all of these fall
under the realm of the last issue: the
size of the College. Increasing the
size of Swarthmore's student body
would effect each and every part of
the academic experience at Swarthmore: larger class sizes, more limited
access to faculty, less individual attention from professors and advisors,

fewer curricular options, etc.
Now that Swarthmore has been
deemed by U.S. News & World Report the top liberal arts school in the
nation, the job of the Admissions
Office becomes all the more difficult; this year, the College received
over4,2ooapplications. Buttheranking of our College should not be
permitted to change the essence of
the Swarthmore experience.
The current value of the Swarthmore education stems directly from
the benefits of attending a small
school. It is impossible to discuss, for
example, innovation in the curricu-

The hundreds of African-American
men who are shot or beaten each year
by police officers aren't given the
option of yelling "Stop, it's only a
construct" at their assailants.
In our attempts to create liberatory
theory, we cannot neglect the opinions of the humans we are theorizing
about. Referring to people ofcolor as
"the Other" in course titles reflects
the racist patriarchal structure which
still pervades institutions like ours.
Implicit in the use of such terminology is the assumption that people of
color will not mind the fact that they
are left out of the discussion due to
their "otherness" because, after all, it
is just a "construction." Like Le
Corbusier, we (students and faculty
who embrace postmodernese) rarely
consider the voices we are attempting to articulate.
Blinded by the theory's enticing
rumors of a cy ber-future in which our
identities can be reconfigured over
telephone lines, we fail to recognize
the blatant inapplicability of
"postmodernity" to the majority of
this nation and watch a prison system
which locks up one-fourth of African-American males as part of a cinematic adventure we can only sit back
and explain in complex terminology.
White males are eight times less likely
to be imprisoned thanAfrican-American males, due in large part to the
chasm in sentencing between the
crimes most commonly committed
by Whites and those most commonly
committed by AfricanAmericans.
More than fourteen percent of African-Americans will soon be ineligible to vote due to criminalrecords.
Only to the tune of a master narrative
so predicated upon self-absorbtion as
postmodernism could this injustice
continue with such minimal resistance from liberal academia.
All the legal and economic gains
which have altered the legacy of hypocrisy initiatedby this nation' s slaveowning founding fathers who theorized about the "rights of man" from
planation porches have come through
struggle. If we continue in our privileged apathy to be satisfied with cerebral gymnastics, accepting the economic inequalities which underwrite
our ability to do so in such lavish
environs, we fallinto the same trap as
Jefferson.Direct protest is necessary,
but the internet can serve as a tool for
organizing successful protests like
the Free Burma Coalition's recent
campaign to force Pepsi out ofBurma.

classroom environment. If the average class size were to increase substantially, students would lose out on
what is currently one of the best parts
of Swarthmore classes: small discussions which permit ideas to freely
flow among students as well as between students and faculty.
The mission ofthe Council on Educational Policy is to determine the
academic future of the College. No

than sustaining, supporting, and
supplementing the already existing

keep the College the size it is and the

We would like to remind you that
the purpose of SAC is to provide

By scheduling Screw on February 22
you have knowingly prevented more

commitment to the student body.
We would also like to point out that
this is the fourth year in a row that

SAC was unaware of the conflict at

the future it would benefit SAC to be
more attentive to the athletics schedules, which large numbers of students are committed to, in order to

FEATURES
Daihatsus Keep Campus Humming Along
By

David Mimno

Ever

since coming to Swarthmore, I
have been fascinated by Daihatsus.
You know, those little white vehicles
you always see
zipping around
campus, looking
like pickup trucks
with severe vitamin deficiencies.
They're always
around, but no
one ever seems to
pay any attention
to them.What are
they, and why are
they here? These
questions plagued
me until one day,
I decided to find

Dupont, but then lost sight of it. I then wandered around the campus for a few minutes,
questioning several professors and students
along the way. Unfortunately, none were able
to offer me any assistance. I was almost ready

and lack of creature comforts.
This seemed like a good day' s work, so I set
off for home. On the way, however, I noticed
two more Daihatsus parked outside ofTarble.
I went in to investigate, and met Gator and
Tim, both Physical Plant employees, who
were cleaning out a radiator in the small room
between Paces and the IC. They explained
that the original Daihatsu, a small van design,
was bought for the Physical Plant around
seven years ago. It came with seats for eight
people, which were removed and replaced
with cargo space. Daihatsus are apparently
used to transport people at Disney World.
The van design is no longer produced,
which means that the newer pick-up style
Daihatsus have much less space for tools and

out.

My quest began
outside Tarble,
where I spotted a
Daihatsu marked
«^^^hmh^h
"Swarthmore
MailDelivery." Driving it was JohnFlanagan,
an employee of, surprisingly enough, the
mail room. He was, it turned out, in the
middle ofthe daily mail delivery route, which
links more than thirty departments throughout the College.
The whole route covers between five and
six miles, and takes around two and a half
hours. According to John, the Daihatsu, which
is known as "the mail truck", is not too fast,
but is very useful for getting around campus.
The hardest part about driving it, he says, is to
avoid the wooden pegs that mark the edges of
paths for snow removal. Flanagan then
showed me the interior of the Daihatsu, which
is cramped but can fit two adults of average
height fairly comfortably.
Justabout then, another Daihatsu, this time
with a load of wood chips in the back, drove
by. I said goodbye to John, and went off in
pursuit. I managed to follow it as far as

good in snowy or icy conditions—all they
need is a different set of tires with chains.
They generally handle quite well, although,
as Tim pointed out, they are top heavy and the
wheels are directly underneath the driver's
seat. In fact, the only time a Daihatsu has ever
been involved in any sort of incident was
when the van was found tipped over in the
parking lot one morning several years ago. I
also learned that these things are not cheap.
The Daihatsu van apparently cost around
$ 10,000 seven years ago, and the newer ones
have cost even more.
At this point, I knew a fair amount about
the trucks, but I still knew almost nothing
about the Daihatsu corporation itself. So I
firedup my trusty web browser and sent it off
to search tor
"Daihatsu."
Daihatsu, as it
turns out, is one
of the oldest and

largest automobile manufacturers in Japan.
They are cur-

rently focusing
on the "minicar"

to call it a day when I happened to spot the

market, which
apparently does

characteristic white shape of a Daihatsu along
the edge of the Crum woods behind Cornell.
I made my way down and talked with Gus
Eriksen, a Grounds crew employee. He said
he loves the job, which he has had for 10
years, because it allows him to work outside
and to deal with plants. He uses the Daihatsu
(one of two owned by Grounds) primarily for
hauling material around campus.
The vehicles can easily carry up to 600
pounds, have a tight turning radius, and can
get up to 25 miles per hour. The Daihatsus are
not street legal, which saves the College
money in insurance and registration fee c .
Eriksen says he would prefer using an
American-made vehicle, but only the Japanese produce anything like a Daihatsu. The
vehicle itself, he said, is not terribly comfortable, especially if you are over 6'2". However, its versatility makes up for its small size

not meet U.S.

supplies. The Daihatsus, however, offermany
advantages over the golf carts used by Maintenance. According to Tim, they have more
power, and are heated. Both vehicles are
powered by gas engines, but there has been
some talk recently of using alternative fuels,
such as propane or natural gas.
The Daihatsus are also apparently very

safety regulations and are thus
limited to "offroad use only."
Daihatsu also
the

Mira and the
Charade, passenPhotos by Adam Stern
ger cars, and the
Feroza, a sport-utility vehicle, in addition to
the small Hijet vehicles.
The mail room, the Grounds crew, and the
Physical Plant all use their Daihatsus for
differentpurposes. They all, however, agree
that on this campus, with its narrow pathways
and high foot traffic, a Daihatsu is the only
way to travel with style!

On-Campus Movies: A Streetcar Named Desire, The Last Supper

Sex, Violence, Stella, Liberals With Forks
By Jeremy

Mathias & Julia Sable
Tom Stenson

and

This

weekend, Marlon Brando returns
again in A Streetcar Named Desire.
Dropping twenty years, forty pounds,
and the gravelly voice from the Godfather,
Brando's new character, Stanley Kowalski,
is slightly less prestigious. He is now a young,
working-class second-generation Pole living
in a run-down district of New Orleans with
his wife, Stella (Kim Hunter).
The sultry city provides the backdrop for
the drama that unfolds when Stella's sister,
Blanche Dußois (Vivien Leigh) comes to
live with them. The movie, directed by Elia
Kazan, and based on the famous play by
Tennessee Williams, provides all the implied
sex and violence that a film released in 1951
possibly could. It was pretty scandalous for

its time.
The beginning of Streetcar follows a
straightforward path, as seductive, beautiful
and fragile Blanche takes refuge in her sister's
house after being fired fromher job teaching
English (Southern English, of course) at a
local secondary school in Mississippi.
When she arrives, she's appalled lo find

Stella living in such disgraceful conditions
with a "common" man. Although Blanche
likes Stanley well enough to flirt with him,
she reprimands Stella for forgetting her upbringing and tells her "not to hang back with
the brutes." Stanley is immediately suspicious ofher story about the loss of the Dußois
family land, Belle RSve. Thus begins the
tension between Blanche and Stanley that
lies at the center of the story.
Stella is caught in the middle, not wanting
to believe the horrible rumors Stanley tells
her about her sister. Mitch (Karl Maiden), a
friend of Stanley, complicates matters by
falling in love withBlanche.
The movie's biggest assets are its two main
characters, Blanche and Stanley, played with
skill and intensity by Leigh and Brando.
Blanche's outward innocence and
playfullness belies her shrewdness, as well as
her mysterious past. She is materialistic and
extremely sensitive about her age and appearance —it's Oil of Olay or nothing!
Leigh has an impressive presence (and
figure) on screen, and she plays the mockSouthern belle to perfection, batting her eyes
and flirting with every man on scree n (including the newspaper boy). However, her

New Columnist looks at Urban Life

Streets Of Philadelphia
By

Perhaps

Christine Leahy

my thoughts have been reduced

to cliches, but after a semester at the
most prestigious liberal arts college in

the country, I am anticipating its antithesis:

"the real world." It's that far-removed place
which my classmates refer to as the "macrocosm," a place where theory evaporates and
common sense is valued over intelligence. I
immerse myself in it whenever I get the
chance.
Well, I was walking down a street in the
middle of Philadelphia (a veritable metropolis of the real world) when one of those life
jarring visions struck me. It was the sort of
revelation that occurs every time I get away
from the supposed Utopia of Swarthmore.
While sauntering through center city, I
recognized the form of a human body huddled
on a street corner. Bundled in tattered blankets and soiled remnants of fabric, a young
woman was trying to keep warm on a February morning. A heavy stench enveloped her
as she rocked over a sewer drain.
She appeared haggardly, yet could not have
been more than thirty years old. That face,
once fresh and beautiful, was now filthy and
hardened by life on the streets. In front of her,
presumably her only possession, was a trash
bag filled withthousands of dull, frayed pages.
As far as I could see, each was covered with
her sweeping, cursive penmanship. Indeed,
the woman before me was scribbling feverishly on a tattered sheet of loose leaf. This

homeless woman, huddled over a sewer drain
in the center of Philadelphia, was writing her
life story.
For me, it was a visual epiphany. But I was
not shocked because my white suburban upbringing had sheltered me from such visions.
I was not alarmed by the disparity between
my relative luxury in a college dorm and her
nothingness. Nor was I disturbed that yuppie
businessmen, filtering in and out of the bank
behind us, were oblivious to this sad, grotesque woman. None of these emotions occurred to me because I was not staring at just
any of the millions of anonymous homeless
people found in every big city. Instead, what
I saw was a vision of myself.
It's not difficult to imagine myself in such
a position, say ten years from now. My passion turned insanity. My creativity overwrought with madness. My goals obscured
by delusions. Somewhere in a trash bag full
of genius, amongst a haphazard diary, an
autobiography and worksin-progress, will lie
my bachelor of arts degree and maybe even a
doctorate. Having spent tens of thousands of
dollars learning about "post-modern social
theory," without a job ora place to live, I' 11 be
in debt with a sign hanging around my neck:
"Will write for food."
I would never wish poverty on anyone,
including myself. But if you're ever in the
real world and happen to see me struggling in
that concrete jungle, don't bother to throw
money in my cup. I'dmuch prefer your Mont
Blanc and a legal pad or two.

kittenish personality can quickly give way to
either an attack of nerves or a hissy fit.
Stanley' s volatile characterfluctuatesbetween
cynicism, violence and cruelty, although he
does cry a few times. The buffed (and hunky)
Brando has little emotional depth to work
with in Stanley, but he portrays his ignorance
and "macho"ism well.
Overall, the movie was...well, bizarre. The
ending reaches almost surrealistic levels, and
the first impressions ofmany characters, particularly Blanche, turn out to be very wrong.
It is definitely interesting, but if you don't
like movies that only loosely follow a rational story line and show the darker side of
human nature, then you probably won'tenjoy
Streetcar very much. If you do appreciate
this sort of film, this is certainly one of the
best of its genre.
Seldom does a film come to the Swarthmore campus that seems so tailor-made for it.
In light of recent editorials, this Saturday's
movie, TheLast Supper, should not be missed
by people of any political persuasion.
The story of The Last Supper is thatoffive
lowa grad students living in a commune who
invito s trucker to dinner. This racist rightwinger disturbs the peace of the evening in
this left-wing household.
After making comments about Hitler"having the right idea," the veteran trucker demonstrates a soldier's manliness by threatening one of the grad students with a combat
knife. He then threatens to rape one of the
women and breaks the arm of another stu-

dent. The meal is finished when one of the
students stabs him fatally.
The trucker turns out to have been a child
molester and criminal—the antithesis of the
average ACLU member. Naturally, the students begin to wonder: "What if we met a
young art studentnamed AdolfHitler in 1924?
Would we be justified in killing him?" They
decide to start inviting right-wing extremists
to dinnerand poisoning them for dessert.
Of course, this does not work out as planned.
The students' plan gets out of hand (or,rather,
more out of hand) and the law begins to get
involved as the body count rises. I won'tspoil
the ending, but what emerges from this newwave morality play is a complex examination
of extremism, intolerance, and vigilanteism.
The characters are fairly well-drawn, with
the focus fairly evenly spread on the five
students.The students are all smart enough to
know better.
This movie has powerful messages for both
liberals and conservatives. No one who has
any political tendencies shouldmiss this careful examination of the national conscience.
By the way, the cameos in this movie are
more star-studded than the main cast. If any
of you out there dislike Jason Alexander as
much as I do (Winner of the 1994Emmy for
MostObnoxious Portrayal of a New Yorker),
now's your chance to see him end up face
down in his stew.
A Streetcar Named Desire will show at 7
and 10 p.m. on Friday in DuPont, and The
Last Supper will show at 7 and 10 p.m. on
Saturday in LP AC.

Another Side of Africa
Film offers new perspective
on the "big country"
comprising fifty countries
and hundreds of languages
By Joseph

To

Armah

the naive, Africa is just one big
country, but to the intellectual and the
widely read or travelled, this "country" is just as much a "country" as Europe is.
One question that most Africans are asked
can be paraphrased as follows: Yeah, I know
you come from this country but do you know
this friend of mine who comes from South
Africa? That's as silly as asking your friends
in London ifthey know your friend in Berlin
is.
"How is Africa like?" is another form of
the same question. Most Africans, pardon my
generality, normally find themselves in a
dilemma when they attempt to answer the
question. This is because the question is extremely ambiguous. One does not know
whether he/sheshould describe his/her country, or give the curious enquirer a taste of
some aspects of the continent. For Africa has

over fifty countries and some ofits countries
are capable of boasting of thirty different
languages and twice that number of tribes.
What is representative of Africa? Is it the
drumming or the dancing or the exotic culture? Images of slaves and tribal warfare? Or
is it the notion that African women are not
treated the same way their contemporaries in
other cultures are treated? Faces Of Women
shows us another side ofAfrica
Faces of Women is a movie that attempts to
portray some African traditions— the roles,
pressures and adventures of the African
woman in the African society. It must be
stated that this movie is representative of
only some aspects of some African countries,
just as Dutch love for "gouder" cheese.to take
an example, cannot be representative of the
eating habits of all of Europe!
Faces of Women is one of those movies
thatleaves everlasting memories in the minds
ofits viewers. Above all, by raising eyebrows
and—better still—questions, it provides
grounds for the beginnings of a healthy
debate.So come and witness another aspect
of the "African culture."
The movie will be shown on Thursday
February 20th from 7-9 p.m. in Kohlberg
320. Refreshments will be provided for all
who attend..

Menzer
asks:

Is
This Seat
Taken?

Picture

this. You're going toclass.
It's one of those touchy-feely,

stare-into-the-eyes-of-a-classmate-and-understand-the-innermostworkings-of-his-soul classes, so the
chairs ofthe classroom are arranged in

a circular pattern. You're a bit early,
so you take a position with an excellent view of the clock, and you sit
down. The minutes pass. Your fellow
classmates slowly begin to trickle in
the room. One sits across the room
from you. One sits two seats down
from you. More and more students
come and the classroom begins to fill
up. Finally the professor arrives and

class begins.
Suddenly younotice that every chair
in the room is occupied except the two
immediately surrounding you.
What are you supposed to do in a
situation like this? You are sitting there
like a giant pimple on the face of
academia. You could try to move to
one of the neighboring seats so that
you are actually sitting beside another
carbon- based life form, but its difficult to play musical chairs in themiddle
ofclass whenthere's no music playing
and you're the only one in the game.
Everyone will look at you like your
some kind of fleshy-headed mutant.
The only thing to do is to sit there
and question the effectiveness of your
personal hygiene products.
Classroom seating etiquette is a difficult thing to understand, and it is,
unfortunately, not covered in the student handbook.
What if, for example, you have the
choice between a seat beside snaggleteethed, gangly-armed strangers who
will, no doubt, violate your overly
developed sense of personal space, or
a chair by yourself, sitting in a bottomless classroom abyss as you struggle
against the black hole of ignominy?
Do you always sit in the same place
in a class, thus establishing your dominant turf within the room, or do you
mix it up a bit, choosing an unfamiliar
yet exciting territory to explore?
I don't know the answers to these
and other seating etiquette questions,
so I decidedto survey the S warthmore
student body and ask them what rules
or maxims they follow in choosing the
place to place their bums in class.
I accosted a couple of people who
were standing outside my room late
one night (serves them right for chatting by my door) and probed their
preferences. Though the answers were
diverse and provocative, I learned one
significant fact that I would like to
pass on to you today: I am the only one
who really cares about this issue.
Yes, it appears that I'm the only one
who is concerned about where people
sit in class. So, instead of thinking of
myself as some deranged neuroticobsessed with spatial placement of derrieres, I would like to consider myself a
pioneer in the field of posterior positioning.
I plan to write a book which, I am
sure, will soon be bought by FOX and
developed into a made for TV movie.
Julia Roberts will, most likely, play
me.
But while you're waiting for the
broadcast debut, I'll give you a brief
preview of the book.
Rule #1: If given the choice between a seat beside strangers and a
seat by yourself, choose the latter,
unless the stranger is very attractive or
has chocolate. If the stranger is both
attractive and has chocolate, forgo the
chair and sit on the stranger's lap.
Rule #2: Establish your territory in
the classroom by urinating on the chair,
desk, or general area. If you are knowledgeable in the ways of the canine,
you'll recognize that this behavior is
known as "marking your territory,"
and, as any good dog will tell you, it is
highly effective. Just make sure the
professor doesn't swat you with a rolled
up newspaper and try to get you fixed.
If urinating in class just seems a
little too aggressive for you, just vomit
on your desk instead. Either way, I bet
you'll get that chair for the rest of the
semester.

To find out more you'll just have to
wait for the publishing of my book,
which will be entitled either The Old

Man and theSeat orKeister in the Rye.
I'm taking advance orders now. No
C.O.D.s, please.

All

hail, pathetic mortals! It is I,
mistress of Darkness. My masters
at The Phoenix have declared that
because of the proximity to that most arbitrary and human of holidays, the one called
Valentine's Day, that I must write of love. I
despise love; it distracts one from the contemplation of occult secrets and can generally ruin one's day (or decade, or century),
but some of you probably thinkit's almost as
neat as Hypercolor clothing.
Now I could just do a boring old love
horoscope, but can't you find that in Details,
my little darlings? Instead, I've got a little
surprise for you.
In the workof theancient sorcerer-philosopher, Cornelius Agrippa, I have found something that you may be interested in. Scrawled
on the margins of the dusty copy I stole from
McCabe's Peace Collection is a ritual for a
love potion. Now love potions, for those of
you not familiar with Wagnerian opera, can
be dangerous, so I'm not recommending that
you use them. So if you do, you didn't read it
here, okay? This one's so simple that even
you neophytes can get it right.. .maybe.
First, you must find an apple (your standard symbol of desire: Paris got one, Eve got
one, etc.). It must be without blemish and
completely fresh. I wouldrecommend checking local supermarkets instead of spending
vain hours looking for one in Sharpies. Peel
the apple carefully—and make sure you throw
the peelings away, or else somebody might
guess what you're up to.
Then, cut the apple into two sections, corresponding to the number two (and not three)
which is the number ofVenus (as Venus isthe
second planet from the Sun). Take those
sections of apple, and bring them to the sundial on Parrish beach. There, at two o'clock in
the morning, carve your name on one ofthem
with a number two pencil. On the other half of
the apple, carve the name of the person who
you desire—but do it backwards—and in
Mandarin Chinese. If the person you wish to
attract is a double major, you must carve their
name twice.
Take the apple halves to a secluded place,
and read a couple of Shakespeare's sonnets
for inspiration. Take care that you don'tread
ones you' ve studied in classes, as that can kill
the effect. Then, smoosh the apple halves
together and put the resulting juice and apple
chunks intoyour favorite mug (I recommend
the "I've been mugged by theAlumni Office"
ones.) This is obviously highly symbolic.
The rest is easy. Put some of your toothpaste, in the potion so they'll like you in the
morning, and if you smoke, throw in a cigarette or two as well. Fill the rest of it up with
your favorite beverage, while playing your
favorite music, and say some interesting
things. Tell it your SAT scores. Be careful to
take this seriously, and please don't lie.
Nowyou have your love potion. The trickiest part, of course, is getting the unwitting
target to drink it. You could tell them that
you're experimenting for a bio project. Or
perhaps you could find them near the end of
a party. Either way, once they consume it,
you will notice that they develop a liking for
you, or at least think you're pretty interesting.
Good luck my friends, I'll be here next
week with some other exciting and arcane
hintsabout how to make life at Swarthmore a
little more...magical.

Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age old
pain,
Its ancient tale of being apart or together,
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you
emerge
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the
darkness of time:
You become an image of what is remembered
forever.
You and I have floated here on the stream that
brings from the fount
At the heart of time love of one for another.
We have played alongside millions of lovers, shared
in the same
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful
tears of farewell
Old love, but in shapes that renew and renew
forever.
—

Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found
its end in you,
The love of all man's days both past and forever:
Universal jov. universal sorrow, universal life.
The memories of all loves merging with this one
love of ours—
And the songs of every poet past and forever.

when all my life was missing was

when I would promise you'd remember
how to live on watery breath, when I
would promise anything...

Sonnet 116
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
William Shakespeare

//

I wake up in your bed. I know I have been dreaming.
Much earlier, the alarm broke us from each other,
you've been at your desk for hours. I know what I dreamed:
our friend the poet comes into my room
where I've been writing for days,
drafts, carbons, poems are scattered everywhere,
and I want to show her one poem
which is the poem of my life. But I hesitate,
and wake. You've kissed my hair
to wake me. / dreamed you were a poem,
I say, a poem I wanted to show someone...
and I laugh and fall dreaming again
of the desire to show you everyone I love,
to move openly together
in the pull of gravity, which is not simple,
which carries the feathered grass a long way in down the upbreathing air

The moon appears from the mouth of the sheer bluff,
its light shining behind the boat over there.
I sit drinking alone with my wife;

A bunny loved a semi
With a love so true and sweet,
The bunny in the forest
Loved the semi on the street.

The bunny loved her windshield,
He pined for her gas cap,
He longed to stroke her fenders,
And kiss her pert mud flap.

how much better than facing some dreary stranger!
The moonlight slowly spreads over our mat,
dark shadows bit by bit receding.
What need is there to fetch a torch?
We've joy enough in this light alone.

A Hunting

One day the bunny's shyness
Was overcome by need.
He stepped into the busy street,
His heart's true love to plead.

It began—l bore the Weapons—
You the Victim were—and Small
But I Know now—in a Hunting—
That the Dogs are All in All

He saw the semi coming,
His heart quickened its pace.
He opened up his arms to hold her
Close in his embrace.

I set out upon your Trail—
But the Hounds—Scented my Soul
They Tore me—l am Bloody—
And you—the Prey—are Whole

The bunny loved the semi
But they say that love can hurt.
Now no one knows it better
Than the bunny in the dirt.

drink out of the container late at night serenaded by the hum ofthe refrigerator. In that
space between your warm bed and feet cold
on linoleum...itis liquid love.

I am imagining being in love with you and
playing with your feet, holding them up to my
cheek and kissing the pads of your pink toes.

I long for the embrace of other arms and the
lingering of other lips upon mine. It is coded
in my mind thatkisses are security, that I can
taste calm and drink peace in the essence of
another. Through a joining,by a rape of their
selves, I take them into me to fill the void that
is dark and wanting escape from looking at
myself. I look instead into you, but, no I am
not satisfied evennow holding you within me
for you are a mirror of my imperfections
superimposed by the promise of a kiss.

Fulfilling Expectations
By

Sarah McClure

After an impressive performance
at the Franklin and Marshall meet last

weekend, Swarthmore's Track and
Field team had a lot to live up to.
At the home meet on Saturday afternoon, the team went well beyond
their expectations. "This was our
house, and we weren't gonna let anyone take it away from us," explained
captain Eric Pakurar '97.
Enthusiasm, support and determination were thekeys to this weekend's
success in all the track and field

events.

In the men's competition, Nate
Mason' 99 stole first place in the pole
vault competition as he towered over
the 13' mark. In the long jump, Steve
Dawson 'OO took first place overall
leaping across 19'8.25" of sand, followed by Mason Tootell '99 who

where they are sure to have yet another impressive performance.

A Successful Week
of Shooting Birdies
By Wendy Kemp

The women's badminton team this
past Saturday morning participated
in Bryn Mawr College's annual
PAIAW championships. Their goals
were to defend and repeat last year's
triumph of carrying off five out of
eight awards. The following Tuesday
marked an away match against Academy of New Church College from
which Swarthmore returned at ten in
the evening stained with both triumph and Chinese food.
The competition at the PAIAW this
year was by far stiffer than in the
Spring of 1996. Even so, Swarthmore walked away with almost half
of the awards given out amongst the

five participating teams. Doubles
team Becky Fischer '97 and Wendy
Kemp '99 captured first place in the
consolations doubles tournament.
Herrin Hopper '9B and JenniferKlein
'9B were not far behind, coming in
second right after Kemp and Fischer.
For the quartet's final match determining the first and second place
consolations winners, the two Swarthmore doubles teams were pitted
against each other. It was only after a
long and grueling match, though not
without some laughter and fun, that
Kemp and Fischer triumphed by a
narrow margin of 15-10, 15-9.
Erika Johansen '99 and Jennifer
Chen '99, who captured first place in
the doubles tournament last year, were
ranked as the number one seed in this
year's tournament. They reached the
semifinals round before one of Bryn
Mawr's undefeated doubles team
ousted them after a long hard match.
In addition, singles player Catherine
Chomat '97 beat all the odds to capture first place in the consolation

has set college records in both the 200 and 500 freestyle.

1:59.42 ranked her at the top of the
list of Conference times.
Captains Alice Unger '9B and
Kristen Robertson '9B raced each
other to personal records in the 200
yd. Individual Medley, with times of
2:21.0 and 2:22.85, respectively.
The list of notable races for the
men starts with the 1000 yd. freestyle.
Brent Wasser 'OO won the event with
a swift 10:58.33, followed by Julien
Lartigue '97, who clocked an
11:11.10.
Keith Earley '99 also had a good
day in the freestyle events; he swam
season best times in the 200 and 500,
a 1:53.77 and 5:06.20 respectively.
The 200 yd. free was a good event
for the Garnet men. Ryan Fruh's '99
season best 1:52.63 took first and
Earley finished second. Lan Brown
'99 had a good swim in the 50 yd.
freestyle with a time of 26.40.
Yet the success of the Ursinus meet

fades into darkness when compared
to the stellar performances by
Swarthmore's swimmers against
Washington. After the cheerleaders
concluded the pre-meet festivities,
the swimmers dove into their swims
and set two college records and a
National qualifying time.
Arbour's 5:18.03 set the school
record in the 500 yd. freestyle, while
the men's 200 yd. freestyle relay of
Fruh, Brandon Walsh 'OO, CarlSanders '9B, and Andy Robbins '9B set
another record with a 1:29.91.
Robertson reached her long soughtafter goal of a national cut in the 200
yd. backstroke, swimming .04 seconds faster than she needed to go.
The meet concluded with more rejoicing; bodies thrown both voluntarily and involuntarily back into the
water. More than anything else, the
final meets have psyched the athletes
for conference championships.

Struggling for a Top Finish

Nebulous Future for B-Ball
Seeking to solidfy its hold on third place in the Centennial Conference,
the women's basketball team drops a tough loss to Washington College.
By

the head with a badminton racket.
At first singles, Hoang pulled off
an 11-5, 11-1 win over ANC's Ruth
Homber. Playing at second singles,
Doan, who usually plays doubles,
lost her first game, butgave her smashing arm a workout as she rallied back
to win the next two by a wide margin.
The third and final game lasted the
longest, with numerous steep drops,
high clears and cataclysmic smashes
brandished by both Doan and her
ANC opponent. In the end, Doan
triumphed, winning the final game
and her match: 8-11,11-2, 11-7.
Ani Hsieh '99 made her debut of
the season as she started at third
singles. Hsieh, who, like Doan, usually plays doubles, worked long and
hard by challenging her opponent's
every point; however, in the end she
succumbed toANCC'sJessicaMyatt.
After wrapping up a successful
week with a 4-2 record and capturing
three out of eight PAIAW awards,
the cancellation of Thursday' s match
has allowed the team to rest and get
psyched up for this Sunday's Northeastern Intercollegiate Tournament,
which will take place at Swarthmore's
very own Tarble Pavilion. This is an
open invitational tournament where

the match-ups will undoubtedly be
interesting and tough.

Jean Quinn

The Garnet faced two Centennial
Conference rivals this week and experienced the game at both ends of a
blowout. The team trounced Bryn
Mawr, 81-39 and then lost to Washington College, 69-38. With a Conference record of 4-8 and an overall
record of 7-12, the Garnet have
slipped into fourth place in the eastern division and lost a shot at this
year's playoffs.
Ursinus, Muhlenberg, and Johns
Hopkins have already clinched three
of the four berths, and the remaining
spot will go to a team in the western
division. The Garnet still have four
games left to their schedule, and with
three conference match-ups to play,
might be able to move into thirdplace.
Against Bryn Mawr, the team arrived fired up and ready for action.
The Mawrters had recently gained
three players and now fielded a team
of eight women, in contrast to Swat's
first two meetings with them when
they had no subs. The Garnet tookthe
game seriously and quickly notched
a lead which would only increase as
the game progressed.
Rachel Gutman '99 said, "I think it
was the first time we played with the
confidence to know that we were the
better team and that we could stop
them every time and then go down
the court and score."
A number of players noted that

seeing their teammates smiling and
having fun on the court was a clear
sign of the unity and camaraderie
necessary for a successful team.
Coach Adrienne Shibles felt the
team's intensity was a great factor in
the win, as was the team's strong
showing defensively. "We really
stepped up the defense, out-rebounding them by 21. Michelle Walsh '9B
did afabulous job on Emilie Brondyke
(BM's best player), holding her to
just 6 points (she averages 15ppg)."
"Holly Baker' 99 and Holly Barton
'99 both did a great job of defending
Bryn Mawr's point guard, Richelle
Takemoto, who averages 21 points,
but scored only 15 on Saturday.
Lastly, Pia Houseal '97 has made a
serious commitment to her rebounding and came out ofSaturday's game
with an amazing 19 rebounds."
On top of those boards, Houseal
had 12 points for her sixth doubledouble of the season. Jean Quinn '99
had 14 points and 12 rebounds. Walsh
threw in 13 points and had her nose
broken for the second time this season.
Lisl Cochran-Bond '97 led all scorers with a season-high 28 points, on
11 of 16 shooting from the floor.
Everyone on the team truly contributed to the victory, with Barton and
Baker combining for 10 assists,
Houseal and Lisl Cochran-Bond
blocking 3 shots apiece, and Baker
stripping three Bryn Mawr players

for a trio of steals.
The team did not fare as well against
Washington College. Had the Garnet
defeated them, they would have been
tied for third place in the conference
with Washington College. Although
WC was missing two oftheir starters,
including their 6'o center who is
fourth in the conference in scoring,
the Garnet could not pull off an upset.
The intensity and the positive
mindset which the players brought to
the game against Bryn Mawr were
missing. Nothing seemed to workfor
the Garnet, who struggled on both
ends of the court.
Housealled the team with 10points
and 10 rebounds. Leslie Young 'OO
had 7 points and Walsh grabbed 6
boardsand had 3 steals, even withher
playing impaired by a protective
mask.
The Garnetwere out-rebounded4229, and shot a poor 32 percent from
the field, compared to WC's 46.6
percent. The team will regroup and
try to get their intensity and chemistry back before taking on Ursinus this
Saturday.

Last week, Swarthmore's men's
and women's swim teams finished
up their dual meet season with a
sweeping victory over Ursinus on
Saturday and a win over Washington
at home on Wednesday.
Both meets were final checkpoints
for the swimmers before the Centennial Conference championships in
terms of achieving faster seed times
and improving race technique.
Wednesday's meet began with the
traditional festivities for seniors at
their final event in Ware Pool. Seniors, Jaime Raich, Julien Lartigue,
Justin Herring, Ross Dickson, and
Kim Killeen were presented with
gifts from their teammates recognizing them for their personal and athletic contributions to the team.
Both the men's and women's teams
swam well at Ursinus, and they

Ben Schall '97. Last week Aaron Bond, senior center, averaged 13.5
points, 10.5 rebounds, and 4.5 blocked shots in victories over Haverford
(52-39) and Ursinus (79-70). His six blocked shots against Ursinus tied
a Centennial Conference record. For his performances he was named
Centennial Conference Co-Player of the week. Aaron is an invaluable

Streak
Stopped

David Lischer

In a battle for first place in the East
Division of the Centennial Conference, Swarthmore's men's basketball team fought incredibly valiantly
against a quick and overpowering
Washington squad. The Garnet's efforts were to no avail as they fell to
the Shoremen 77-64 on Wednesday
night,
"They played better than we did
and deserved to win. They're quicker
than we are at almost every position,"
said Coach Lee Wimberly.
Swarthmore lost by only one point
to Washington earlier this season, on
January 16. Both teams played poorly
in that contest, but the offenses were
definitely on the right track Wednesday night.
A normally stingy Garnet defense
allowed the Shoremen to sink some
46% of their shots. WhileSwarthmore
held Ben Harris, the conference's
seventh leading scorer, to just two
points, 12 below his season average,
other Shoremen stepped up to carry
the scoring load.
Swarthmore out-rebounded its opponents 43-35, but that advantage
could not make up for the team's 22
turnovers. Washington's efficiency
in converting its steals into points
more than made up for its rebounding

disadvantage.
Swarthmore was also hurt by the
fact that, at the referees discretion,
physical play, especially under the
basket, was allowed to continue without a whistle. The Garnet only shot
six free throws in the game.
Both teams' centers had strong
games. Mark Awantung for Washington scored 18 points, grabbed eight
boards, had five steals, and blocked
four shots. On the other side of the
ball, Swarthmore's Aaron Bond '97,
recently named conference co-player
of the week, recorded his fifth doubledouble of the season. Bond had 14
points and 11 rebounds as well as two
blocked shots.
The unfortunate loss ended the
team's six game winning streak and
set them two games behind Washington in the East Division standings.
Muhlenberg defeated Franklin and
Marshall to even itsconference record
at 5-5, just a game behind
Swarthmore.
Tim Schofield '99 led the team
with 15 points against Washington
after a red-hot first half. Ben Schall
'97 added 14 points and five assists
but struggled with his shooting.
There is not a single easy contest in
the final three games of the Garnet's
season. First, the team hosts
Dickinson on senior night Saturday
in the final home game of the year.
The alumni gamekicks off the day at
3:00 p.m. It is followed by JV at 5:30
p.m. and Varsity at 7:30 p.m.
Dickinson will definitely pose quite
a tough challenge. "They are similar
to Washington but not as big. However, they execute better than any
team in the conference," said Coach

Wimberly.
After Dickinson, the Garnettake to
the road to face first the Mules of
Muhlenberg and then Haverford in
the season finale. With a one-game

lead, Swarthmore controls its playoff
destiny, to some extent, yet each of
the next three games must be treated
like a must-win situation.
