SEPTA dumps construction debris in the Crum
BY SARAH POZGAY

slong6@swarthmore.edu

A Swarthmore resident recently
reported construction waste left in the
Crum Woods by SEPTA contractors
working on a trestle of the R3 Regional
Rail line, which runs through the woods.
In November, Sarah Chenkin, who walks
daily through the Crum, first noticed the
two-ton carrying bags filled with construction materials.
Though noting their continued presence in the following months, Chenkin
did not realize the materials had been
abandoned until one of the bags was
blown into the Crum Creek. After fishing
this bag out of the Creek on Feb. 13,
Chenkin more closely examined the contents of the other bag, which included
unused but noticeably ruined cement
mix. She also noted that the location of
the trash was largely inaccessible to
motor vehicles, which otherwise could
have been used to remove the materials
without aid from SEPTA. The materials
were apparently lowered off the tracks to
the construction location.
Chenkin's response to SEPTA'S abandonment of these materials was critical.
As a resident of the borough who regularly makes recreational use of the
woods, she said this irresponsibility on
the part of SEPTA is disappointing. "I
feel that it's incredibly disrespectful
because there are numerous people that
come to these woods not only from the
college, but from the Swarthmore community and other communities that take
very good care of the woods," Chenkin
said, citing one community group called
the Chester-Ridley-Crum Watersheds
Association that annually cleans the

stream.

Anne Murphy, Executive Director of
the association, explained that it's not
uncommon to encounter construction
waste in the creek, whether left by
SEPTA or others. She said in an e-mail,
"There have been problems with contractors leaving things along Crum
Creek in the past, such as giant pieces of
PVC pipes used at Smedley Park, which
washed down to the stretch by the college. CRC through joint action with the
college, managed to get the county's contractors to remove and hopefully reuse
Unfortunately, this hapthose pipes
pens a lot along streams, since they are
visible places, and this is one benefit of
the two upcoming cleanups of Crum
Creek."
Chenkin feels that SEPTA should
nonetheless be held accountable for the
waste. "I think that because it's SEPTA
and because they're supposed to have a
relationship with the college
they
have a trestle that goes across the college, and they have a train stop
it
seems to me they really should be
responsible for removing things that
they leave in the woods," she said.
Though according to Jeff Jabco,
Director of Grounds and Coordinator of
Horticulture for the Scott Arboretum,
SEPTA owns the property on which the
rail is built. "They do have the right of
way," he said, adding, "There's actually a
property line."
On the other hand, the materials
blown into the creek certainly constituted illegally deposited trash according to
www.cleanpaforests.org. This makes the

an

infraction

of

the

Pennsylvania Crimes Code, which dictates under Title 18, Chapter 65 that littering on private property is punishable
by a fine of between $5O to $3OO, imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or
both, according to the website.

When informed of the incident and

given the opportunity to rectify the situation, SEPTA authorities seem to have
responded promptly and effectively to
complaints of the litter. The materials
were removed within days of their hearing of the trash. SEPTA was notified of
the materials by a Phoenix reporter on
Monday, and again more formally by
Jabco Tuesday morning.
"I put in a call to SEPTA, and they

were very responsive. They said they'd
put in a work order, and it would be
taken care of," Jabco said. "I was quite
surprised. It seemed to be very easy;
they were very agreeable." Jabco
explained that if the materials were not
taken care of within "a week or two," he
would follow up contact with SEPTA.
However, by the end of the working day
Tuesday, the site appeared to have been
cleared of the materials.
More generally, Jabco said that
SEPTA itself is not one of the chief contributors to littering in that part of the
woods; instead, trash is often illegally
dumped off the tracks themselves by
civilians. Citing just one example of this
behavior, Jabco said, "We always find

computer monitors that people will
throw off the trestle or the track up top."
And while a part of the general debris in
the area is a result of some dilapidation
of the rail structure, this trash is usually
picked up during cleanups hosted
throughout the year by the arboretum.
"I don't think SEPTA normally
polices along their right of ways to do
cleanup; we do that," Jabco said. One of
these cleanups is quickly approaching
on Tuesday, April 28. "We welcome students to come and help with that if
they're available," Jabco said. For those
interested in participating in the
cleanup, Jabco can be contacted at jjabcol@swarthmore.edu for more information.

Applicant pool shrinks for Swarthmore, peers
BY ALEXANDER ROLLE
arollel@swarthmore.edu

Applications to Swarthmore for the
class of 2013 dropped by approximately
10 percent from last year, according to
Jim Bock, Dean of Admissions. This is
part of a national trend among small
liberal arts colleges; according to
Bloomberg, seven out of the eight liberal arts colleges that were top rated by
the US News and World Report have
received fewer applications this year
than last.
While Williams College received 20
percent fewer applications this year,
most of the drops in applications were
less than five percent.
Meanwhile, all eight Ivy League universities saw their applications
increase from last year.
Downplaying the seriousness of the
drop in applications, Bock pointed out
that it was, historically, a good year.
"We've only been over 5,000 [applicants] three years, two years ago we

were roughly at 5,300, last year we were
roughly at 6,100, this year we're going
to be roughly at 5,500, so I think you
have to look at the number in the context of history
we had a 50 percent
increase [in applications] over the last
four years.".
And while the number of applicants
decreased, Bock emphasized that the
caliber of those applicants did not.
"The academic quality of the applicants and the academic quality of
acceptances is going to be
very similar [to years past]." Similarly, Bock was
not concerned about the effect this
decrease in applicants might have on
the diversity of the pool.
"What's intriguing or hopeful is
that we are nearing the national demowe're down evenly men,
graphics
we're down evenly women, we're down
...

...

...

in internationals, we're down in .every-

thing across the board. The one group

we're up in is Hispanic/Latino, which
is the fastest growing demographic [in
the United States]," Bock said.

March 19,2009

Reacting to the downturn, Dean of
Students Jim Larimore also emphasized the historical context of the application numbers.
"Since our applicant pool is on par
with the pool two years ago, we are not
anticipating any major changes in the
composition of the student body," he
said in an email.
While Bock recognized that the drop
in applications to liberal arts colleges
is probably influenced by their cost, or
their perceived cost, he thought other
factors were at play.
"I think it's deeper than [the perceived cost]
there's a question of
what a liberal arts education is worth."
Bock suspects that, in tough economic
times, more prospective students and
their families might take future career
prospects more heavily into account,
and some might favor larger universities with greater name recognition on
those grounds.

After months of what they felt was
inaction by the Swarthmore administration, members of the Swarthmore
StudentLabor Action Project sent a letter to the editor of the local paper, The
Swarthmorean, which was published
in the Feb. 13 issue. In the letter, SLAP
activists urged community members to
join in efforts to prevent the inn from
being developed through a ballot initiative if proper agreements over
unionization could not be reached.
"We had been in communication
with the administration but we felt we
weren't being given any consideration
on legitimate concerns and issues that
as students we have the right to voice,"
SLAP member Megan Long 'l2 said.
"After months of not being taken seriously, I think the ballot initiative was
more a way of showing that we care
about this issue."
According to SLAP's letter to The
Swarthmorean, a ballot initiative
would prevent the hotel from gaining a
liquor license, one of its primary
sources of revenue, by overturning the
2001 referendum that originally
allowed liquor to be sold in hotels in
the Swarthmore Borough
SLAP is a student-ledactivist organization which has been pressuring the
administration this year to agree to a
card check neutrality agreement for
the prospective Swarthmore Inn to
ensure that workers at any future
hotels on campus will have the chance
to unionize. The implementation of
this policy would allow hotel workers
to form a union when a majority of the
workers sign cards expressing their
wishes to join as opposed to going
through the process of holding a secret
ballot before recognizing a union.
The letter to The Swarthmorean
was intended to inform the residents of
the Ville about the possibility of the
ballot initiative if proper labor protections were not in place. "Part of the
reason for the letter was to have a call
for awareness in the community," JJ
England 'O9, a member of SLAP, said.
"There have been so many changes to
the project since its inception that we
felt that letting the community know
what we were up to was a good idea."
In the letter, SLAP accused the college of continued inaction and claimed
"the campaign [for card check neutrality] must escalate if we hope to make
work place democracy at the hotel a
reality." Signers of the letter explained
that their strong rhetoric was aimed at
encouraging members of the community to become involved in SLAP's
efforts.
The letter, however, evoked a mixed
response from The Swarthmorean's
readers. In the following week's letters
to the editor, one Swarthmore resident
went so far as to accuse the students of
violating the RICO act. The writer,
David M. Maola, claimed, "I can't support this mob-style racketeering,"
arguing that what the students were
doing was blackmail against the president's office which "only perpetuates
what these students are trying to eradicate and does nothing to move a reasonable agenda forward." Other letters

March 19, 2009

were not as accusatory but still highlighted the complexity of the issue and

the need for discussions without stop-

ping the project completely.

Plans to pursue the ballot initiative
in upcoming community elections
have since been abandoned, according
to members of SLAP, after discussions
at the most recent board of managers
meeting did not go as well as SLAP
members had hoped. England and
Long, as well as Maurice Eldridge,
attribute this to miscommunications
between the administration and SLAP
members. "When we got to this meeting we had been told that these communications [concerning SLAP's
efforts] between the administration
and the board had been happening on
our behalf so they could be kept in the
loop," England said. "But we got there
and it just hadn't happened."
Eldridge recognized that the communication might not have met the
needs of SLAP members, but noted that
it was not necessarily the board's position to be involved in the everyday discussions between SLAP and the administration and questioned the effectiveness of using an ultimatum to pressure
the administration and board into
making a decision they are not yet prepared to make.
"I think that as [SLAP members]
quickly learned at the board meeting,
the board didn't like having a gun put
to their head," Eldridge said. "They
would have much rather talked about
the substantive issues that were on the
table. In both what was printed in the
newspaper and what was said at the
board meeting, they were presented
with the idea that they had to make the
particular decision in a short period of
time or else. It was very hard to deal
with and not the way the board operates."
Whether the hotel will be constructed at all is still up in the air, according
to Eldridge, especially considering the
hard economic times. This uncertainty
only added to the board's hesitance in
making a decision now about future
labor agreements for inn workers.
"Given the state of the economy and
given that we are working with one
contractor who is not going to be the
person or company who is likely to be
the actual inn operator, we are several
steps removed from being in position
to influence the outcome," Eldridge
said.
However, Eldridge does believe that
some positive discussions did come out
of last month's meeting. "I think what
SLAP has achieved is a greater understanding ofhow the board operates and
a promise that the process going forward will be as transparent as we can
make it for them and everyone else."
Although the ballot initiative is no
longer being pursued, SLAP is still
planning an educational panel and
other events in upcoming weeks to
spread information about labor issues
involved in the future inn. Both SLAP
and the administration hope to continue discussions about the possibility of
a card check agreement when and if
the plans for the inn become more definite. "There are a lot of unknowns
right now, but we'll just have to wait
and see," Eldridge said.

Sager Symposium breaks off ties with Genderfuck
BY ASHIA TROIANO

atroianl@swarthmore.edu

While the Sager Symposium and the
Genderfuck Party have never officially
been associated with one another, the
party is generally publicized as the culminating event of the Symposium. This
Symposium
however,
the
year,
Planning Committee has formally terminated its unofficial affiliation with
the party, on the grounds that the
party's atmosphere is antithetical to the
"safe space" that the Symposium strives
to cultivate.
Sager Symposoum Committee CoChair Maria Kelly 10, alluded to the
heightened incidence of sexual misconduct and harassment at last year's party
as one factor motivating the decision.
"After last year, with the occurrence of
homophobic events, even from people
within the campus, we were getting so
disheartened about the party," Kelly
said. Kelly emphasized the extreme
divergence between the party and the
events that precede it. "The goals of the
Symposium and the party are becoming
separate. We talked about it and concluded that it wouldn't be' associated
with us. The party has been detrimental
to the Symposium," Kelly said.
Started 21 years ago by Swarthmore
alumnus Richard Sager '73, the
Symposium was designed to explore
issues concerning the queer community. "It was pretty much the only queer
thing in town. The party was originally
just an after-party," said Sasha Raskin
'O9, co-chair of the Sager Symposium
Planning Committee. "Now, the Sager
committee would have to plan around
the party
There was almost no dialogue
[between
Symposium
the
Committee and the Party Committee].
We had to look up who was on the committee from last year."
Erika Slaymaker 'll expressed disappointment that the party no longer
embodies the goals of the Symposium.
"[The party] should be an empowering
space for queer people and celebrate

symposium
this
fabulous
Unfortunately, the party has not been
safe for women and queer people. It has
not reflected the intentions of the symAccording to
posium," she said.
Slaymaker, the party has taken on a life

...

of its own, and the Committee is powerless to control the message it conveys
and the behavior of its participants.
"Over the years, we have worked hard
to make the party a more safe space, but
the party had .become bigger than us,
with a whole culture around it. It has
become too big for us to tackle and this
year we decided we did not want to put
the energy towards changing it. It is
time for something new," Slaymaker
said.
The Symposium Committee brought
their concerns to the Social Affairs
Committee, which agreed to assume
responsibility for hosting this year's
party. "All of us on the Party Planning
Committee find the concerns of the
Sager Symposium Committee legitimate and important. We are working to
make the party a safe and fun space for
all students," said Alex Weintraub 'll, a
member of the Party Planning
Committee.
In lieu of the Genderfuck Party, the
Symposium will host a separate afterparty associated with the Symposium.
"We will have our own culminating
event closed to Symposium attendees,"
Kelly said. "The space will be different;
it will be for people who are interested
in the goals of the Symposium."
The Genderfuck Party and the
Symposium will occur on two separate
weekends. "Since the party is a tradition and its theme of exploring gender
is important for the Swarthmore community, we took (by default as the heads
of SAC) an active role in ensuring that
the party took place this year," Jessica
Hamilton 'O9, head of the Social Affairs
Committee and. member of the
Genderfuck Party Planning Committee,
said in an e-mail.
Weintraub said he views the party as
an asset to campus life and a venue for

community-building. "Personally, as a
queer Swarthmore student,

I believe the
party is an important one for the
school's social calendar, and one that
could be an asset for fostering community on campus. I would be disappointed if, when met with homophobia and
sexism, we decide to abandon a queerpositive party, instead of striving to
improve it. I have spoken to other queer
students on campus, most of whom
want to see it happen," Weintraub said.
Symposium
of the
In light
Committee's concerns about the safety
of the Genderfuck party, the Party
Committee, which is still looking for
members, has taken some extra measures to ensure that the space is safe for
everyone.

First, the party will only be open to
Swarthmore students who register and
receive their wristband prior to the
party. Second, the traditional theme of
"Boys wear a dress, and girls wear less"
will be dropped. Third, the Women's
Resource Center will be less dimly lit
and the music will be lower during the
event so as to make it more conversation-friendly. Lastly, if any one encounters a problem, SMART team members
and other students who can escort that
person out will be available at the
party.
"Due to the nature of the party and
the symposium's reasons for not wanting to throw it, SAC's approach is
aimed at creating a safe and comfortable environment for all students.
Thus, we are not just planning the party
as we would the Halloween party or the
formals, but we are working to correct
some of the problems in the past,"
Hamilton said.
Sager '73, who endowed the Sager
Fund, voiced a different set of initiatives to re-focus the Symposium. The
Fund was initially intended to fund
events specific to queer communities
but which would appeal to the campus
community as a whole. Traditionally,
the Fund has been used to support the
Sager Symposium's events and over the

years has become closely associated
with it. "The Symposium has become
synonymous with the Fund in people's
minds. It's important to make a distinction between the Sager Fund, which is
the vehicle I set up, and the Sager
Symposium, which the Fund sponsors,"
Sager said in response to the news.
"The goals of the Sager Fund, which
have morphed, were something the initial committee decided a symposium
could achieve best."
While the Symposium is funded by
the Sager Fund, it is not the only event
for which the fund can be used.
"The Sager Fund was set up to fund
multiple items and events," Sager said.
"There was never a rule or understanding that the [events] had to be held at
the same time."
"The goals of the Fund are to provide
LGBT specific materials, activities and
programs that are of particular interest
to the LGBT community, and also to the
whole community," Sager added.
Consequently, the administration is
working to increase the involvement of
faculty, staff and alumni in managing
the Sager Fund.
"We are re-thinking it so we get back
to the original intent. Faculty involvement will be reinstated, and they would
get credit as if they were on any other
committee
There are people who
have historical and institutional memories that students don't have by virtue
of being students. Students don't always
have connections and contacts to bring
in people [that faculty, staff and alumni
can]," Sager said. "There were a lot
more alums who were more involved,
but [if the events aren't reaching the
whole community], they are less motivated to get there and less motivated to
fund it. If outside funding has stopped,
that indicates to me that the events are
more limited in their appeal."
Sager expressed high hopes for the
Symposium and the Sager Fund. "The
money in the endowment is there, and
my commitment hasn't changed," Sager
said.

Despite decline, Wilcox says RA pool still "strong"
BY AMELIA POSSANZA
apossanl@swarthmore.edu

This year's RA selection
committee saw a decline in
applicants, continuing a trend
that has been occurring for the
past several years. Only 75 students applied, as compared to
the 91 that applied to serve as
RAs for the 2006-2007 school
year.

Myrt Westphal, Associate
Dean for Student Life, said that

the application process would
not change as a result of this
decrease. Currently applicants
must respond to a set of written questions and submit letters
of
recommendation.
Current RAs have a slightly
different set of questions as
well as a request for comments
that the committee sends to the
students living on their hall.
After these materials are
turned in, the applicants have
interviews during which they
are asked about their written
work and to role play through

THE PHOENIX

resident problems.
The committee then meets, in a
session that often lasts from
four in the afternoon until midnight, to select the RAs. The
committee must also consider
RA placement and construct
teams of RAs with complementing personalities to work
together in each dorm. Current
RA Arly Gease 'lO said of the
process, "It's kind of intense.
The first time around I was
nervous."
This rigorous process may
in fact help insofar as it turns
away halfhearted interest.
"This was the smallest pool
we've had, but I also think that
people are self-selecting and
understand whether this is the
right fit for them," Westphal
said. She emphasized that
although the group was small,
the applicants were strong and
the committee was forced to
turn away students who were
up to the job.
Kelly Wilcox,
Assistant
Director of Student Life,
possible

echoed this sentiment. "I think
we were unsure going in, but
now that we've reviewed the
applications we've come to
realize it's a strong pool. If [the
drop] means they really put the
time in before applying, I think
that shows respect for the
process."

As an initial response to the
unexpected drop, the Student
Life Team, composed of Rachel
Head, Elise Garrity, Myrt
Westpahl and Kelly Wilcox,
extended the deadline for the
RA application by an extra
week. This decision only yielded about a half-dozen new
applications.
Westphal doubts that there
will be any significant changes
to
either the application

or the way that the
school advertises the position
to students. The Student Life
team encourages RAs to tell
students whom they believe
would be strong to apply. In
addition, they host information sessions in both the spring

process

March 19, 2009

and the fall to inform students
of the responsibilities of an RA
and send emails to students eligible for the post.
Although this has not yet
developed into a concern for
the administration, it has been
a surprise. "In our minds this
is one of the most important
jobs on campus and certainly
the best paid," Westphal said,
suggesting that these aspects
alone should draw in appli-

cants.

In fact, these were Gease's

motivating factors. "It crossed
my mind as something I wanted to do freshman year," he
said. "The experience I had on
my hall and the way my

RA
took an interest in the freshman's lives put it in the back of
my mind." Although the financial aspect of the job was not
his sole motive for applying, it
played a role in his decision as
he was already on the lookout
for a campus job.
Another surprising and
worrisome fact for the Student

Life Team is that more people
have begun to decline the position once they have been
accepted. This could be due to
a variety of factors such as a
want of better housing or too
many time commitments.
Wilcox said that this summer the Student Life Team will
have a chance to step back and
reflect on whether changes
need to be made. During the
summer, the team will be better equipped to ensure that
their decisions are not kneejerk responses.

But Wilcox already has a
few ideas about what is essential to keep and enhance in the
RA application and selection
process. "I think that the element that can always be
improved is education. We
want students to be informed
about the role."

Students serve as observers Pool of applicants
in historic El Salvador election yields sizable drop

The group was on watch for any issues that arose

throughout the day. "In the particular case of El

Juan Victor Fajardo 'O9, Harrison Magee 'O9, Shadi
Rohana 'O9 and Alexa Malishchak 'O9 traveled to El
Salvador to serve as international observers to the
nation's presidential elections, a political event with
great historical significance, given the possibility that
the nation's leftist party would come into power
through democratic means for the first time in history.
Fajardo, Magee and Rohana left for the small
Central American nation on March 6 and returned to
campus this past Tuesday, whereas Malishchak traveled later and under the auspices of a different organization and initiative.
"We realized that their presidential elections coincided with our spring break, and received invitations
from a national fair democracy watch group based in
San Salvador called FUNDASPAD," Magee said in an
e-mail.
"We knew that these elections were a big deal,"
Fajardo said. "It was the first time the left had a chance
of winning."
The leftist party Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, or FMLN, comprised of former leftist guerrillas from the nation's recent civil war, took
power Sunday night with candidate MauricioFunes as
president. Because the right-wing Nationalist
Republican Alliance, known as Arena, has won four
successive presidential elections, Funes' victory highlights a major shift in El Salvador's politics as well as
an important moment for Latin America. It was, as
Fajardo said, "a huge moment for the history of the
country."

As international observers, the three functioned as
neutral voices in the election, helping to mediate election issues such as ambiguously marked ballots and
otherwise working to prevent electoral fraud. "We
were trained in the nuts and bolts of the voting procedure itself, as well as in the structure of the country's
electoral administration.
On election day, we oversaw the process from
beginning to end
the setting up of the voting center,
throughout the day as people cast their ballot, and the
vote count at the end of the day, taking note of any
irregularities or breaches of the legal procedure, and
fielding the claims ofany voters or voting coordinators
who encountered problems," Magee said in an e-mail.

Salvador, past elections have been marred with the
growing number of foreigners bused into the country
by the governing party to vote using fake national
identifications. We were trained to look out for these
and other such things, so for many organizations committed to maintaining a fair and transparent voting
process, having outside observers is an invaluable
tool," Magee said.
Since El Salvador only has two political parties and
because the election was projected to be very close, it
was particularly important for voters to be able to turn
to objective individuals manning the polls. People
"would actually listen [to you], because they wouldn't
want to listen to [representatives] of the party,"
Rohana said. According to Rohana, the roughly 5,000
observers weren't just from El Salvador.
The three friends' shared interest in Latin
American politics drove them to seek funding from the
college. Together, they drafted a letter to the
President's Office explaining why this trip was relevant to their experiences as Swarthmore students,
Fajardo said. They later submitted this letter to various academic departments. According to Fajardo, the
President's Office provided most of the roughly $1,400
of funding they received and the political science and
modern languages and literatures departments also
provided a "good chunk."
Fajardo said that he wanted to be part of the election process so he could see El Salvador through a "different lens."
"Normally when you go to vote it's less than an
hour," he explained. In El Salvador, however, Fajardo
witnessed people voting from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. For
Fajardo, the trip was fulfilling not only because of the
historic importance and relevance of the election, but
also because of the people he met, especially the "very
active students and young people who are very excited
about this triumph [and] this chance for change."
Though they were officially neutral, Fajardo said
that "In the end, I think all of us were rooting for the
'front,'" a name that many people use to refer to
...

FMLN.

Though the school covered the round-trip tickets
and housing, the students themselves had to cover
otheramenities like transportation within El Salvador
and food.

Continued from p. 3
While this perception may exist to some, Nancy
Burkett, Director ofCareer Services, believes that "a liberal arts education is not only a good stepping stone to a
meaningful career, but offers the best foundation for lifelong learning, which is vital in our rapidly changing
world," she said in an e-mail.
Burkett went on to say that "when we talk with employers about what they see in Swarthmore students, they consistently affirm that rather than seeking narrow knowledge of a specific discipline, they value the skill set of a
Swattie because of the breadth of their learning and the
diversity of their intellectual interests."
Along with the Ivies, public universities have also seen
their applications rise, a change that has also been attributed to economic conditions.
Bock acknowledged that public universities are "good
options and they're perceived to be less expensive." But
even so, Bock emphasized that, "for a lot of our students,
we're the best financial option."
One aspect of the class of 2013 that may differ slightly
from recent classes is the percentage of aided students,
though no one is sure how much that percentage will differ, or even if the change will be an increase or decrease.
According to Bock, "More people applied for need-based
financial aid
we expected that to go up." However, the
college does not know how many of the prospective students who applied for aid will eventually qualify for it, nor
does it know which accepted students will decide to matriculate in the fall, and how many of those students who
decide to enroll at Swarthmore will be aided.
Bock emphasized that there is much uncertainty in the
aided percentage of the class of 2013. While pointing out
that more students might qualify for aid because of the
worsening economy, Bock also said that "it could be that
we yield lower on aided students because they're going for
state tuitions or perceived lower-cost schools."
While the college cannot be sure at this point, it recognizes that demandfor financial aid may increase next year.
"We are attentive to the possibility of a slight increase in
the number of students receiving financial aid," said
Larimore.
According to Bock, the unknown variable for all admissions officers will be the amount that families are willing
to pay. "$49,600 is going to be the sticker price for next
year," said Bock. "What the asking price will be for any
family has yet to be determined."

FROM WAR NEWS RADIOI

Iraqi refugees flock to Syria in immense numbers
BY GABRIEL RAMIREZ
WAR NEWS RADIO
The following piece about the neighborhood of Jaramanah in Damascus,
Syria originally aired in War News
Radio's Show, Taking Flight, on March 6,
2009. Originally written by Gabriel
Ramirez and transcribed for publication
in The Phoenix by Elizabeth Hippie, the
original piece and full show, as well as all
of War News Radio's past shows, can be
heard at warnewsradio.org.
The violence and sectarian violence
that took hold of Iraq in the years after the
US invasion has caused the largest exodus
of people in the region since the creation
of Israel. Many Iraqis fled their homes for
safer destinations both inside and outside
the country. But this time, people aren't
moving to refugee camps. That fact makes
this refugee crisis unique, according to
Dr. Omar Dewachi, a social anthropologist who is researching Iraqi refugees.
"[The refugee crisis] has not concentrated
in camps and not concentrated in very
overt bases deemed as refugee camps or
considered as bases for foreigners who are

6

living there. It has been a flux into urban
settings," Dewachi says.
One of those urban settings is the
neighborhood of Jaramanah on the out-

skirts of Damascus. It is estimated that
16,000 Iraqi refugees are living there. One
of those Iraqis is Waseem, an Iraqi
Christian originally from Baghdad. "I am
from Iraq, I lived in Baghdad. I arrived
here July of 2007. They were trying to kill
me, so I left my home and came here,"
Waseem says.
The percentage of Iraqis living in
Jaramanah, a mainly Christian and Druz
working class neighborhood, has become
so high that the town has taken on an
Iraqi flavor.
"In Jaramanah there are more Iraqi
restaurants than Syrian restaurants, even
Syrian restaurants serve Iraqi foods. Also
sometimes when you walk in the street
you hear only the Iraqi accent," a Syrian
entrepreneur living in the area said when
asked to describe how he feels walking in
the streets of the neighborhood.
Waseem also says he feels the same
way. "One feels like he is in Baghdad. In
Baghdad there is the circle where every-

body is Assyrian Christian like me, many
of them are here now, just like in
Baghdad."
What makes Jaramanah a selling point
for many Iraqis is its diversity and toler-

ance.
Jaramanah is home to various religions and peoples. Druz, Muslims,
Christians of many sects all live together
there, relatively free from social pressures.
The Syrian entrepreneur from the area
reports that, "There is social and religious
freedom here. The people that are running
from prejudice come to Jaramana. In
Jaramanah there are people of all types.
There is no specific sect here."
This lack of sectarian division is one
quality that attracted Dewachi, the
anthropologist, to the neighborhood. "You
find Christians and Muslims and
Mandeans hanging out all together. I
think a place like Jaramanah has definitely provided this possibility that probably
in Iraq these different families and different friends were living in different neighborhoods it was much more difficult to do
the last few years."

March 19,2009

Similarly to the religious diversity and
tolerance ofJaramanah, Dewachi's family
liked the more secular nature of its culture. "It was more, I guess, reminiscent of,
let's say, Baghdad, kind of middle class
neighborhoods. My extended family, they
wanted for the women to at least go out
and walk in the street, wearing or not
wearing the hijab. Men, you know, wanted to be living in a place where there is no
religious pressure or political pressure on
them."
Jaramanah isn't perfect. Both Iraqis
and Syrians are suffering from the overcrowding, which is causing a spike in the
prices of commodities and housing. Many
Iraqis living there hope that their time in
Jaramanah is only a transition. Some are
hoping to travel to Europe or the U.S.
Others are waiting for the war to end to
return to Iraq. "God willing, I will return
to Iraq when the situation settles. Maybe
when I return, things will be like before,
or better. But right now, I can't
it's too
difficult," Waseem said.
In the meantime, Waseem and Iraqis
like him will continue to call Jaramanah
their home.

Two students selected for Watson Fellowships
swarthmorephoenix.com

dfuocol@swarthmore.edu

Neither Jess Engebretson 'O9 nor
Helen Chmura 'O9 is sure what career
she wants to pursue after college. Yet,
as of last week, both are confident they
will spend all of next year following
their passions.
Engebretson
and Chmura are
Swarthmore's recipients of this year's
Watson Fellowship, which grants graduating seniors the opportunity to pursue
a year of independent research internationally. The Watson Foundation provides Fellows with a stipend of $28,000 to
support projects which, from their genesis to their execution, are wholly selfdirected. In awarding this opportunity
to graduates with "unusual promise,"
the Foundation hopes to enhance graduates' "capacity for resourcefulness,
imagination, openness, and leadership"
and "foster their humane and effective
participation in the world community,"
according to the Watson Fellowship's
website.
After they graduate, Chmura and
Engebretson will take off on vastly different paths. Chmura will be exploring
how climate change has affected sacred
mountain regions.
Her project,
"Vanishing in Thin Air: Climate and
Culture
Sacred
Mountain
in
Conservation," will take her to Peru,
Chile, India, China, Papua New Guinea
and Argentina. "In some ways, I feel
like I've won the lottery," Chmura said.
Chmura was inspired to apply for the
Watson Fellowship after doing fieldwork in the Colorado Rocky Mountains
for her thesis this past summer. "I know
that [applying] would only feel right if
there was a project I felt passionate
about," Chmura, an honors biology
major, said. "[After doing field work in
the Rockies], I realized I love this
ecosystem and mountains."
While studying the environmental
impact of climate change on the mountains, Chmura also hopes to immerse
herself in mountain communities and
explore how people who reside in these
places are also affected. Chmura looks
forward to this immersion because it is
"a really important part of being a world
citizen," she said.
On the other side of the world,
Engebretson will be exploring how postconflict societies use radio as an effective means to foster peace and reconciliation. She plans on traveling to
Liberia, Rwanda and Indonesia to pursue her project entitled "Producing
Peace: Radio and Reconciliation in PostConflict Societies."
"By working with local producers on
everything from serialized soap operas
to policy talk shows, I hope to begin to
understand the ways thatradio can help
knit back together communities recovering from violence," Engebretson
wrote in her proposal.
Engebretson said that her work on
the student-run War News Radio and
the Darfur Radio Project were pivotal
for her proposal.
"Obviously I would never have
thought about or cared about radio" had
it not been for War News Radio and the
Darfur Radio Project, Engebretson said,
admitting that she knew nothing about
radio when she first came to
Swarthmore. Both programs run weekly
and aim to cover everything from civilians' narratives to a country's policy
changes and elections. War News Radio

THE PHOENIX

covers issues surrounding the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Darfur
Radio Project focuses on Sudan.
"The beauty of the Watson is that it's
flexible," Engebretson said. "It really
gives you a chance that is so wholly
your own and what you want to do." She
said that the Watson Fellowship is
unlike other grants and fellowships
you can
because it "isn't pragmatic"
be "passionate about something without
requirements."
The application for this competitive
fellowship consists of two parts: a personal statement and a proposal for a
project. Fellowship and Prize Advisor

Melissa Mandos and others from
Fellowship
Swarthmore's Watson
Nominating Committee chose ten out of
the pool of applicants to interview at the
beginning of the school year. Based on
these interviews and letters of recommendation, the college selected four students to be finally interviewed by the
Watson Foundation.
The number of Swarthmore applicants for this competitive fellowship
was atypically high this year, increasing to 41 from roughly two dozen last
year.

"We certainly get more worthy proposals than we have slots to fill, so it
comes down to some very hard decisions," Mandos said. "We're mostly
looking to see that their project is a
reflection of themselves, that they truly
embody their project
You hear the
word 'passion' a lot with the Watson."
A project "makes sense," she added,
when a student has "clearly thrown [his
or her] heart and soul" into it, demonstrating prior interest in the project's

Department travel warnings or under
U.S. Treasury embargo.
And though both Engebretson and
Chmura have concrete plans in pursuing their respective passions next year,
they are both reluctant to say what their
plans are after that.
"I know that I love being out of doors
and that alpine ecosystems are something that I care deeply about. However,
I'm not sure how these things will come
together in a career path down the
road," Chmura said. "I could see pursu-

ing a traditional path in academia,
something along the non-profit or science policy road, or maybe I'll just be an

avid hiker all my life and pursue something completely unrelated as a profession. Regardless, I know that the mountains will be an important part of my
life."
Engebretson echoed Chmura about
her experience with radio. "I'm not really sure what I'm going into,"
Engebretson said, but "this is something I really love to do."

subject matter.

Each of the Watson Fellowship's 50
member institutions, which are all
small liberal arts colleges, nominates
four students. Last week, the Watson
Fellowship announced the 40 finalists.
Since the fellowship started in 1969, the
college has had 71 fellows, including
Engebretson and Chmura. Last year's
Fellow was Wren Elhai 'OB. Elhai, a longtime singer and former member of
Sixteen Feet, is studying vocalization.
With the fellowship's flexibility, however, comes the expectation that Watson
Fellows will have the initiative to stay
committed to their project and be able to
live on their own for a whole year.
As the Watson Fellowship's website
says, "When they wake up in the morning most Watson Fellows ask themselves, What am I going to do today? If
you believe that you will wake up and
ask, What do they want me to do today?
then you are probably not imagining a
Watson."
Mandos said that they have to "be as
enthused about their project [from] day
one to day 366."
"[We look for] people who we think
can handle a year of travel on their
own," she said. "It's an exciting opportunity, but also a challenging one. Not
everyone can do it."
Chmura agreed, recognizing that her
project will be full of challenges.
"I'm sure there will be rough days
ahead when I'm soaking wet and freezing cold on top of a mountain and asking, 'Why am I here?'" Chmura said.
"You have to be able to do pursue this,"
she said. Watson Fellows cannot return
to the United States at all during their
year abroad. The fellowship's only other
main restriction is that students cannot
travel to countries under U.S. State

Richard Teerlink, retired CEO of

Harley Davidson.

This past Tuesday, the
Phoenix's Jeff Davidson interviewed Richard Teerlink. On
Sunday March 29, Teerlink will
be giving the keynote speech
for the ninth annual Lax
Conference in the Science
Center. The conference focuses on entrepreneurship and the
subject this year is "building a
strong enterprise: critical
skills for successful entrepreneurs." Teerlink is a retired
CEO of Harley Davidson. He
served the motorcycle company for 18 years and led them
from financial turmoil back to
public ownership and success.
His effort to revive Harley
Davidson was people-focused
and created a successful cultural transformation. He is
currently on the board of directors of Johnson Controls
Incorporated
and Snap-On
Incorporated. He was inducted
into
the
National
and
Wisconsin Business Hall of
Fame in 2002. He is the parent
of a 1983 Swarthmore graduate
Jeff Davidson: Much of
what you did for Harley
Davidson can be applied to
industries in today's failing
economy. Leaders must take
control of a bad company and
do something to turn things
around. GM is asking for $3O
billion in federal aid, but they
need a clear cut plan, one I have
yet to see, for revamping the
way they do business. What do
you recommend they do, in light
of the great strides you madefor
Harley Davidson, to fix the
dying Detroit automaker?
Richard Teerlink: One of
the unfortunate things in
today's society is people attach
what the leaders do to the company as a whole. We had to
determine how we can give our

customers

something

they

value rather than what we
think they value. You have to
be customer-focused on what
they want. There are many
times customers would like the
ultimate machine for 50 percent of what it costs, but that's
not something you can look at.

love our final customer, I ride
with them and such, without
the dealer we cannot get at that
final customer. We have to be
sensitive to dealers and those
requirements. Dealers who
don't make money don't serve
customers well. We helped customers that drive riders into
dealerships. We had to give the
final customer a reason to ride
and have fun. If they don'tride
and have fun, they won't buy
new parts and accessories,
they're not going to enjoy the
sport.
We started the Harley
Owners Group, shortened to
HOG, to focus on a cultural
transformation. That group
today has over one million
members around the world. As
we got through that, those
three items [customers, dealers, and the transformation]
took us about five years
We
started to see something good
happen. But Harley's been successful before then gone down.
We had to ask the question how
do you sustain success? Where
does it come from? Is it good
luck? Or is it the opportunity
to influence people and products and those things? We ultimately decided what really
went on in all that time was
that we had a very engaged
workforce. We had engaged
dealers, we had engaged riders,
we really started to understand
more completely that our competitive advantage was our
people, which is a new way to
look at it.
Our job as leaders was to
create an operating environment to do new things. When
you look at that, what is the
operating environment? Is it
one where they're encouraged
to do well? Or are they told
how to do it, when to do it? We
then set up a cultural transformation that started with four
questions. The challenge is
how do you get people to work
for a purpose, not just for
money. As we were discussing
this, we came up with four
questions that we thought
would be the foundation of a
business process that we put
together. It's how should we
behave? What's important?
How do we give people a framework? What's important with
the job descriptions?
We
needed to be clear on who we
serve
You can't just identify
one group you need to do well
by. If I have happy customers

...

and engaged employees, I'll
probably do pretty well with
making money.

JD: One of the things you
talked about was cultural
can you
transformation
expand a little more upon that?
RT: The cultural transformation started with the four
questions that I said
it's the
bedrock, the foundation of
what the organization is about.
Underneath that, then you
start doing the conventional
things that all organizations
do. You've got the planning,
you got to have a mission, you
got to have objectives, and
you've got to have strategies.
All of that is very interesting
and very important, except
while that's going on you
haven't sold one product and
you haven't made one product.
What's important is the execution of all of that. You get the
execution by having people
take responsibility for their
job, and how their job has a
positive impact on what their
group is supposed to do, which
filters into what the strategies
of the company are. So you
ultimately end up getting to a
point where all the employees
have the opportunity to influence what they do and how
they do it. So the cultural
transformation was how do
you go from an expanding control, top-down type of environment, into a very different collaborative environment.
JD: What positions before
coming to Harley Davidson do
you feel trulyprepared you to be
ready for the job?
RT: Every one I had. One of
the things I'm a strong believer
in is lifelong learning. One of
the key elements of lifelong
learning is experience. I had
the good fortune of working
with some very good companies and moving on when I felt
that they weren't fitting exactly what I was looking for in a
company. It was never money
it was value systems I was
given an opportunity early in
my career to be a plant manager, and my background is
financial accounting. Three
years as a plant manager
opened my eyes to the importance of what goes on and
everyone on the shop floor. I
could go through each one of
the jobs I had and say I learned
something here.
JD: Where and how did you
...

originally

start formulating

organization. You can't impose
a business process on anybody,
you have to allow them in on
the process. Harley is pretty
unique in having a labor union
but we try to partner with
them. We try not to have an
adverse relationship. We wanted to make sure we were all
going in the same direction.
JD: Can you talk a little
more about your opinion of

leadership in general?
RT: Leadership in general
really, what is leadership? I
really can't give a definition,

but I can say what I think the
job of leaders is. As I said earlier is to see that everybody
has the environment to do a
great job. If you have a couple
good ideas along the way,
that's great. But there's so
much power in every employee
along the way that gets wasted
because we have leaders who
think they are the only ones
who think. I don't think that
leadership is tough
the decisions you have to make are
tough. At the beginning at
Harley we had to lay off 40 percent of our people, that's a
tough leadership decision. It
would have been easy to say
well let's do 15 percent and see
what happens. We decided we
had to make aggressive moves
in order to survive. We as a
company were effectively
owned by banks, and banks
wanted their money back.
They don't want you to carry a
lot of costs. And the market
was terrible, there was excess
inventory out there. It made no
sense at all to continue to have
the workforce. We had to try to
be as humane as we could.
JD: How does communication play a role in making a
business successful?
RT: The business process
that I described is a huge form
ofcommunication. It gives people an understanding of how
they fit in the whole scheme of
things. Max Depris says a great
quote "leaders by their actions,
not by their words, establish a
sense of justice in the system."
Too many times we have leaders who can write wonderful
memos, and they're charismatic when they get up to speak,
but the rubber meets the road
in how they act. Sometimes
leaders forget that in their
actions. You communicate
more by your actions then you
do by anything else.
JD: The Lax conference you
will be the keynote speaker at
includes the subject "building a
strong enterprise: critical skills

these ideas of employee commitment and leadership? Did that
come out of a specific place, or
person, or is that something for successful entrepreneurs."
that evolved over time.
In responding to this subject,
RT: It's something that what are the steps that should
evolved as a group. Remember be taken for someone just starting out in the business world?
what I said in the beginning,
it's based on the joint experiRT: The first major issue is

and be able to produce it. You

JD: As a parent of a
Swarthmore student, what is
your take on the value of a liberal arts education? Do you see
what students learn at a place
like Swarthmore worthwhile in
rebuilding today's workplace?
RT: We have three children,
each of them had a liberal arts

education, one of them had a
liberal arts education at
Swarthmore. I had a very good
vocational education. I went to
college and learned how to be a
very good accountant. I spent a
number of years after thatreally trying to learn how to operate the world. Had I taken
more liberal arts courses, I
probably would have been in a
better position to deal with a
lot of things. I was an accountant, I learned accounting.
Doing accounting doesn't say
anything about understanding
what people were about.
Liberal Arts provides you with
that understanding. And it's
the understanding of what has
happened before that helps you
in some of the subtle issues.
JD: Do you have any comments on things in general
[about the economy]?
RT: It's obvious that our
country is going through some
very trying times and we've
been there before
this is different, as they always say. I
think throwing money at problem seldom solves problems.
Getting past people who want
to solve problems and get
involved in it can usually solve
it. It goes back to actions and
work. You have to be able to

SibShop directs efforts towards special needs siblings
BY KATHERINE ERNST

kernstl@swarthmore.edu

Founded nearly a year ago by Grace
Chang 'O9 and fellow head coordinators
Katie Altynova 'OB and Kristin Caldwell
'O9, SibShop is a program that aims to
support the siblings of children with
special needs in the local community by
providing them with peer support and
education within a recreational con-

text.

"A lot of families are really struggling with how to care for a member of
their family with a life-long disability,
and we typically think of the parents as
having this burden to carry," Chang
explained. "Siblings are often the overlooked family member."
Best described as events, Sib Shops
are designed primarily for school-age
children and emphasize a kids' eye-

view.
Erin Rondhovde 'lO explained the
need for a group like Sib Shop in light of
the lack of existing area organizations
serving siblings of children with special needs.
"I'd never heard of a group that
worked with the siblings of special
needs children before," she said. "I
think it'sa need that often goes unmet."
Currently run by Chang, Rondhovde
and Caitlin Daimon 'll, Sibshop bring
information and discussion activities
together with energetic games. While
the Swarthmore branch of the program
initially focused its attention on facilitating a space where the siblings of children with special needs could be the
focus of attention, SibShop has recently
been making an expanded effort to foster discussion.
y
'Last year the focus was a lot more
on just giving the siblings a place
where the attention was all on them,
and I think that was a good starting
point, because for obvious reasons they
don't get that a lot at home," Ronhovde
explained. "But since then, we've started to incorporate much more the aspect
of creating a dialogue with thekids that
are involved and between the kids that
are involved about what it means to
have a special sibling."

Erin Rondhovde, above, works with siblings of special needs children at a

Daimon believes the children noticed
that. "They've become more involved
with discussing their special siblings. It's
been great," Daimon said.
At the meeting this past Monday,
Chang, Ronhovde and Daimon passed out
nametags, markers and pieces of a giant,
homemade puzzle to participants, whose
ages ranged from four to 10 years. After

taped together to create a vibrant poster
with the word "autism" written in big letters. Everyone then created a circle
around the poster, and Chang asked the
children to take turns talking about their

brothers or sisters with autism. About
half of the children raised their hands.
SibShop is a partner program to
TOPsoccer, a branch of a national organization for young athletes with disabilities. Organized by youth soccer associa-

tion volunteers, the program is designed

to bring the opportunity of learning and
playing soccer to children between the
ages offour and 19 with mental or physi-

cal disabilities. At Swarthmore, both
SibShop and TOPsoccer meet at the Field
House every Monday at 7 p.m. so that
children with mental or development
needs can play soccer while their siblings participate in a separate set of
activities.

Syracuse president Cantor speaks at Bryn Mawr
you may be and it's either empowering

BY SARAH WESTBROOK
BICONEWS.COM, MARCH 12
The Center for Science and Society
and the Katharine Houghton Hepburn
Center co-hosted Nancy Cantor, the
11th Chancellor and President of
Syracuse University, at Bryn Mawr
Tuesday, February 24, for a lecture entitled "Women as Academic Leaders:
Insiders with Outsider Values."
President Cantor appeared as part of
Hepburn
ongoing
the
Center's
"Celebrating Women Scientists as
University Presidents" lecture series.
Introduced by Bryn Mawr President
Jane McAuliffe, Cantor began by citing
the rising number of women in the
highest levels ofacademic leadership in
recent years.

She noted that in 1986, less than one
in ten college presidents were women.
That number has recently grown to one
in four. However, Cantor added that
"the numbers are nowhere near as good
for minority groups in higher academics."
She stressed that as greater numbers
of women break into previously maledominated leadership roles in higher
education institutions, "it is critical
that we not forget where we come from."
For Cantor, this means constantly
remembering two critical lessons she
learned as a graduate student at
Stanford University, after earning an
A.B. from Sarah Lawrence College.
Cantor recalled finding herself in an
elevator on one of her first days at
Stanford with a famous psychology professor who told her that Stanford "did
not accept girls from Sarah Lawrence."
"In an instant," Cantor noted, "I had
become wary of insider status as you
are constantly reminded of your outsider roots."
This encounter taught Cantor that

The first was a commitment to

"inter-group dialogues" on campus that
strive to "facilitate meaningful, sus-

Second, Cantor mentioned an ongoing effort to create a more expansive
rewards system for academic scholarship in higher education.
This is designed to explore ways to
recognize, and dispel institutionalhesitancy towards public scholarship or
collaborative and interdisciplinary faculty projects.

These projects appeal particularly,
according to Cantor, to women and

minorities who "often feel a strong
sense of community."
Lastly, Cantor highlighted publicprivate partnership
of Syracuse
University and the surrounding community to seek a better future for the
next generation of college students.
Drawing on historical and modernday examples, Cantor explored the
power and implications of using an
insider status with outsider values for
institutional activism.
She stressed the need for such a person to "care deeply about bringing others into the room with us" by finding a
"common cause with others and opening several doors at once."
This collaboration is what, for
Cantor, ensures "the staying-power" of
broad-based change.
She also identified a need to "remain
as open as possible to institutional
change, as open to scrutinizing the way
we do things as we would be as outsiders."
Lastly, Cantor urged insiders to
"retain the spirit and courage of outsiders."
"We must," she said, "be comfortable
with our group identity, recognizing
that we are ideally situated for the
kinds of change that truly can be
described as transformative."

Haverford confronts honor code violation in trial
BY LARRY MILLER

BICONEWS.COM, FEB. 25

In the latest Honor Council
Academic Trial, the confronted
parties decided to break their
confidentiality in order to facilitate dialogue within the community about issues in the
Mathematic department's collaboration policy.
The "Odin and Thor" trial
addresses academic collaboration policies, the seriousness of a
frequent and pervasive infraction, and the potential value of a
confronted party revealing his or
her identity.
Issued on February 17, Odin
and Thor is the most recent
Honor Trial Abstract. Upon the
jury's deliberation, the confronted parties were found guilty of
breaking the Honor Code. The
Honor Trial Jury presented the
resolution that the confronted
parties must: (1) Write a letter to
the community to be released
with the abstract, (2) Engage in
dialogue with the academic

10

department to clarify and
improve the content or execution
of the collaboration policy, and
(3) Receive a zero on the assignment in question. Although it
wasn't requested of them, both
Odin and Thor decided to reveal
their identity in their letters to
the community.

Odin and Thor's trial was
unusual in that due to various
delays, the trial was unable to be
held the same semester as Odin
and Thor's infractions. Odin said
via email, "The seven months
leading up to the trial were
extraordinarily stressful. I had
trouble sleeping, I couldn't focus
on my schoolwork, and I spent a
good chunk of the summer worrying about it."
Thor was also anxious. "All
the other trials that I read about
seemed to end in separation or
no creditfor the course. We were
curious about what would happen to us," he said.
Once the trial started, however, Odin said it was less painful
than he expected.

"Everyone was very interested in finding out what happened.
It was more like a conversation
than 'Law and Order,'" Odin
said.
The reasoning behind breaking confidentiality, a first for a
confronted party in an Honor
Council Trial, was similar for
each party. Thor believed it
could be a good opportunity for
members of the community to
inquire about his experience and
to "work forward" with "discussing policy."

Odin said, "if I were to have a

meaningful resolution, I would
have to talk to a lot of people."
Breaking confidentiality was his
answer for his "need to do something."

Odin's and Thor's mathematics professor initially confronted
them for collaborating too closely on an assignment. Both were
surprised with the confrontation
because similar collaboration
practices happen on a normal
basis within the mathematics
department.

March

;

,

Correct collaboration procedure involves working out a sample problem on a separate piece
of paper and then completing the
real problem on one's own after
learning the method. Odin and
Thor printed out two copies of
the same problem to hand into
the professor.
The collaboration guidelines
state, "substantial agreement
between papers, verbatim or otherwise, will be construed as evidence of inappropriate collaboration."
Although Odin and Thor's
work was in clear violation of the
collaboration guidelines, the
"lack of uniformity across the
Math department" in condemning the practice left the students
in unsure waters when collaborating for their work.
Part of Odin and Thor's reasoning behind breaking their
confidentiality is to create an
open dialogue with other math
majors about the current procedures. From there, Odin and
Thor will meet with the depart-

ment with ideas for refining and
making universal professors'
interpretations of these guide-

lines.
On professors differing with
levels of enforcement of departmental guidelines, Provost Linda
Bell states, "whenever issues like
this come up with the faculty,
I've always said to be as explicit
as possible regarding therules."
On the other hand, one of the
confronted parties believes that
rules need to be reexamined for
their relevancy and effectiveness.
"I know [the guidelines] need
to exist... [but] if everyone is cutting the corners, why not just
keep the corners out?" Odin said.
Overall, Odin and Thor
thought they gained from their
experience with the Honor
Council court. In Thor's letter to
the community, he describes the
experience as "enriching," while
Odin says he has "never felt
more essentially connected to
this institution than I did in
those days."

Assessing the value of the Tri-Co's art collections
BY MICHAEL GLUK

mglukl@swarthmore.edu

When Brandeis University announced
last January that it would be dismantling
its Rose Gallery and auctioning off all
6,000 works it held, donor Lois Foster
likened the decision to a suicide. A New
York Times article on the incident commented, "It's hard to think of a comparably destructive
and self-destructive
move in the art world today." Why did
this small Bostonian university's decision incite such widespread outrage?
Perhaps because a college's art collection attests to how the institution values
art as a discipline, and moreover, perhaps academia's appraisal of the discipline indicates art's place in society. The
breadth, depth and intelligence of a college's collection can attest to its commitment to the history and development of
art and culture. Fortunately, each of the
colleges in the Tri-College Consortium of
Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr and Haverford
boasts an impressive commitment to the
visual arts, evidenced in their collections
and galleries.
Bryn Mawr claims 280 paintings, 750
sculptures, 7,000 prints, 1,500 drawings
and 15,000 photographs. Most prominent
in the college's painting collection is a
portrait of president M. Carey Thomas
which, according to Bryn Mawr's official
publication concerning its art collection,
"was awarded the Grand Prix at the

Universal Exposition of 1900." The painting collection, understandably, emphasizes 19th and 20th century American
works; however, the college's overall
repertoire is also rich in works from
other cultures, as M. Carey Thomas and
donor Mary Garrett assembled and
donated many works from their travels
in Europe and Asia, contributing substantially to Bryn Mawr's Decorative
Arts collection. Its 7,000 prints encompass
the 15th century through the present and
include works by Rembrandt, Durer and
Mary Cassatt, along with 300 Japanese
woodblock prints. Its photography collection contains, the publication reads,
"works spanning the history of photography, including a significant collection of
documentary photographs from the 1860s
to 1900, optical devices of the 19th century, and art photography of the 20th century."
Unique to Bryn Mawr is its collection
of archeological and anthropological artifacts. According to Bryn Mawr's publication on its art collection, "In 1896, Bryn
Mawr College established one of the first
independent archaeology departments in
America and from its early years the faculty emphasized the study of artifacts."
Since then, professors and benefactors
have continued to donate artifacts like
black and red figure painted vases and

Native American art to the collections.
This inventory proves useful for staging exhibitions
two were held during

the fall of 2008 in Bryn Mawr's Carpenter
and for classroom purposes.
Library
Bryn Mawr utilizes web-based and physical exhibits in multiple history, art history, and classics classes to enrich reading and lecture material.
Haverford is home to a similarly
impressive collection. The college owns,
according to its website, "hundreds of art
prints by such artists as Cezanne,
Hiroshige, Kandinsky, Miro, Piranesi
and Picasso and paintings by Cornelius
DeMann Delft, Egbert van Heemskerk,
Maxfield Parrish and Charles Willson
Peale as well as works of sculpture and
artifacts both ancient and modern."
These sculptures and artifacts range
from Greek artifacts dating back to ca.
1300 8.C., to artifacts from a dig at Beth
Shemesh, Palestine under the direction
of Haverford professor Elihu Grant, to
the eyeglasses of T. Wistar Brown.
Additionally, the college's photography collection contains approximately
3,000 images, including daguerreotypes,
printed photographs and digital images.
This collection is often displayed in
public exhibitions. Diana Peterson, the
college's manuscripts librarian and college archivist, co-curated a show in
Magill Library called "Revealed," featuring 60 works. When asked by a colleague

if "a show on this level could be repeated," Peterson said in an official statement, "Spanning many centuries and cultures, the show includes prints and paint-

ings by artists such as Peter Paul Rubens,
Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Wassily
Kandinsky, Joan Miro and Haverford's

own Maxfield Parrish, artifacts from
ancient Greece and Africa, as well as a
rich selection of photography including
prints by Walker Evans, Diane Arbus
and Andres Serrano."
Swarthmore's collection directors
were able to comment only briefly on the
college's
collection.
Constance
Hungerford, provost and professor of art
history, cites paintings of Benjamin West
and Edward Hicks as especially prominent samples from the college's relatively
small collection which also contains,
according to Swarthmore's Department
of Art website, more than 250,000 slide
and digital images spanning the course of
art history. However, the institution
boasts its commitment to visual art in
other ways, specifically in the active
Kitao and List galleries. The List gallery
exhibits works year-round from mainly,
though not exclusively, emerging contemporary artists. Additionally, every
spring, the gallery features an exhibit of
senior Art majors' and minors' work.
The Kitao operates similarly and had
recent
great
success
with
its
"Transgender Photo Narratives" exhibit,
in which Arthur Robinson Williams, discussed the process of making "My Right
Self," a documentary on people in the
Philadelphia area who identify as transgender.

'Arms and the Man' provides entertaining satire
BY ANNE COLEMAN

acolemal@swarthmore.edu

George Bernard Shaw was a
satirist by definition, but his
play "Arms and the Man" is gentle in its commentary, proving
that you can catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.
The title is the only thing in the
play that harkens to the heroes
of yore (it's a reference to the
start of Virgil's "Aeneid"), and
the Hedgerow Theatre's new production is no epic poem, but a
simple delight for easy consumption by audiences of any age.
Raina (Jessica Dal Canton) is
an idealistic and deliberately
naive
Bulgarian
girl
who
believes, contrary to abundant
evidence, that her fiance, Major
Sergius Saranoff (Steve Kuhel),
is a war hero. He is quite the
opposite
possibly one of the
worst soldiers in history, at least
according to Captain Bluntschli
(Brian Gallagher). The introduction of the Swiss Bluntschli into
Raina's uncomplicated life is the
catalyst for a major shift in her
world view and creates chaos in
a group of people with far too
much time on their hands.
Shaw's story studies the nature
of war, patriotism, aristocracy
and idealism, and does it all
while keeping a playful, indulgent eye on the protagonists.
Prepare yourself for some
truly peculiar facial expressions
and physical comedy, in addition

THE PHOENIX

to a few well-placed political

jokes that read as well now as
when Shaw first set pen to paper.
(When asked if he is the emperor
of Switzerland, Bluntschli says
he holds the highest rank in
Switzerland: a free citizen.)
Kuhel is magnificently foolish
as Sergius, providing the perfect
counterpart to Canton's stickysweet Raina. Sergius and Raina
are both excessively proud characters, and Kuhel and Canton
relish acting out that pride. The
actors may just be competing for
who can hold their chin the highest. Raina's perpetual posing and
Cheshire-cat smile come in second place, though, to Kuhel's
outlandish shifts from self-righteous to passive-aggressive.
Kuhel is a real scene-stealer
in his first show with the
Hedgerow Theatre, but he is not
the only one to leave an impression. Gallagher, as Bluntschli,
provides an agreeable straight
man in the second and third acts,
and wins enough credibility
with his comedic performance in
the first act to keep his pragmatic character relatable in the
world of the batty Petkoff family.
The servants also nicely contrast
the mayhem. One of this year's

apprentices, Maggie Cogswell,
shows real promise as Louka,
and while she doesn't always
own the scene, she is, in her own
way, just as winsome as Canton.
Greg Bell, as Nicola, is convincing as a servant satisfied with

his lot in life, despite an abundance of lines that would challenge any actor's believability.
Raina's parents, Catherine
Petkoff (Betty Lou Roselle) and
Major Paul Petkoff (Zoran
Kovcic), are under-realized, but
nonetheless sufficiently doddering to work as the parties responsible for Raina. When the play
brings their characters to the
foreground, Roselle and Kovcic
give just enough energy and spin
to get a laugh, but neither offers
much independent of the script.
The staging occasionally complicates scenes. In the first priMarch 19, 2009

vate encounter between Louka
(Maggie Cogswell) and Sergius,

several shifts seem more arbi-

trary than interesting. Director

David O'Connor's final act, however, is pleasing and inventive,
providing enough variety in
Sergius' and Raina's bouts of
fury to keep the audience
engaged and to ensure that the
characters live up to the erratic
silliness of Shaw's final scenes.
The Hedgerow has made several wise choices this season,
and "Arms and the Man" is a
part of that success. The first
ever production at the Hedgerow

was Shaw's "Candida," in 1923,
so the revival is a bit of a homecoming for the company, some of
whom have been with the
Hedgerow for over 20 years. The
real reward for doing "Arms and
the Man," however, is the discovery of Kuhel. The company is
keeping him for the season's
next

production,

Nagle

Jackson's "The White Room,"
and will no doubt be the better
for it.
"Arms and the Man" is playing through April 5. Tickets can
be purchased online or by calling

CRAMER VS. STEWART: COMEDY CENTRAL SMACKDOWN!

vs. Nicole. It
was...

Cramer vs. Stewart!
For everyone out there who didn't spend
the entirety of spring break watching
Comedy Central while eating a truly mindboggling quantity of cheese-based food, the
previous paragraph was a reference to the
weeklong Battle of the Sound Bytes between
Jon Stewart of "The Daily Show" and Jim
Cramer, the crazy bald guy who can be
found on CNBC's "Mad Money" alternately
screaming "Buy! Buy! Buy!" and hurling
small plastic animals at you through the TV
screen. In essence, the feud was a battle
between a financial expert (because Cramer
is quite knowledgeable, despite all the
antics) whose show too often sacrifices real
reporting in the name of entertainment and
an entertainer whose self-proclaimed "fake"
news show often contains better analysis
than anything on actual news shows.
The feud started when Stewart, in a
piece on how CNBC had ignored all signs of
the impending stock market crash, showed
a clip of Cramer telling viewers to buy Bear
Sterns a mere week before the entire brokerage firm collapsed. Cramer came back
swinging, accusing Stewart of using his
remarks out of context; Stewart countered
by finding more footage of Cramer exhorting his viewers to buy Bear, and by the end
of the week the entire nation (or at least
that fraction which avidly follows feuds
between cable television personalities) had
picked a side, and Cramer had agreed to
appear on The Daily Show to defend himself. Cramer's mistake was not realizing

that, behind the funny faces and fart noises,
Jon Stewart is an intelligent and wellinformed man who is not afraid to ask
tough questions.
This is not to say that Stewart is usually
anything other than a genial interviewer.
He rarely presses his guests for anything
more difficult than the release date of their
latest book. However, when he wants to,
Jon can hit just as hard as anyone else in
the business, and I mean anyone; when
Stewart is at his fiery best, I doubt that even
the most seasoned newsman could touch
him. (If you need proof of this, just ask
Tucker Carlson; that is, if he can even bring
himself to speak about the day when
Stewart tore him to shreds during an
appearance on "Crossfire.") Cramer, like
Carlson, probably came on the show expecting to endure some jokes at his expense and
then to return home unscathed. He certainly wasn't prepared for The Wrath of Jon.
I could summarize the interview for you,
but Stewart did it better by saying, at the
end of the show, "I hope that was as uncomfortable for you to watch as it was to do."
Don't worry Jon, it was; I almost felt sorry
for Cramer, who was forced to defend not
just himselfbut CNBC as a whole. Jon started early and hit hard, and his guest was
hard-pressed to fight back. Whenever
Cramer attempted to defend himself, Jon
had a clip that contradicted him, including
a particularly damning moment in which
Cramer defended and even encouraged the
controversial practice of short selling.
(Short selling, for the record, is when an
investor sells stock he doesn't actually own,
betting that the price of the stock will go
down, which allows the investor to purchase stock at a lowered price, making him
a profit of the difference between the price
at which he bought the stock and that at
which he sold it. Just so you don't get an
inflated idea of my economic knowledge, I
should say that this practice had to be
explained to me with the kind of dumbeddown syntax and repetition generally
reserved for a 3-year-old learning to use the

defended Bear Sterns a mere week before
the stock crashed, he said that the CEOs of
Sterns lied to his face, a defense he reprised
later when defending CNBC's financial
reporting as a whole. It took Stewart, the
anchor of a fake news show, to point out
that "You don't just take their words for it
at face value [...] you actually then go
around and try to figure stuff out."
Some news outlets have criticized
Stewart for taking such a serious, prosecutorial role on a show that is normally a

lighthearted look at the issues that most of
us take so seriously. I, however, agreed with

Stewart when he told Cramer that the economy "is not a fucking game," in response to
Cramer's assertion that his show is there in
a large part to entertain people. The eco-

nomic crisis is not a game to those who, in
Stewart's words, "were capitalizing your
adventure by our pension and our hardearned money," and the host used that
knowledge to tap into the frustration felt by
American citizens who lost their savings
because of Wall Street greed. The interview
with Cramer was, essentially, an articulation of the frustration that most Americans
feel, a howl of rage that was, at the least, an
act of catharsis. It says somethingabout the
state of television journalism that it took a
fake newsman to hold the financial press
accountable.

shortselling as a way to make a quick profit.

Superhero

of
adaptation
Snyder's
"Watchmen," superhero movies
have officially grown up, tackling deep, difficult questions
about morality. Whether they
successfully offer any insight
into these questions, though, is
another story.
The premise of "Watchmen"
centers on a group of self-proclaimed superheroes, who, like
us, have grown up with the phenomenon of the superhero comic
and have decided to bring these
stories of vigilantism into their
real lives. The graphic novel, created in the heat of the Cold War,
is fraught with nihilistic fatalism, and like "The Dark Knight,"
"Watchmen" offers the flip side
of most superheroes' cheery vigilantism. At the core of the story

THE PHOENIX

is whether or not individuals
such as the titular Watchmen
have the right to judge humanity.
These questions are best reflected in the film adaptation through
the character of the Comedian.
The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean
Morgan) is the key to the movie.
What is fascinating about the
Comedian is the irony with
which he watches over the people he protects. The polar opposite of the morally upstanding
superhero, the Comedian is

unacceptably violent and subdues the masses, who he claims
to protect, through brute force.

His methods are a skewed version of the tough love cliche.
Even the Comedian's death at
the start of the film is a punch
line of sorts. The repeated image
of a smiley face with a bloodstain
is a stirring reminder of the central
moral
of
dilemma

"Watchmen."
It's the character study of the
paradoxical Comedian that ulti-

mately allows Snyder to successof
fully
execute the plot
"Watchmen." Nonetheless, the
film has tons of flaws to weight it
down. "Watchmen" is not a
movie that faithfully follows a

story line as much as it is movie
whose scenes pantomime the
semblance of a story line. There
are many powerful set pieces and
sequences, but, put together,
they feel disconnected rather
than being cleverly intertwined
with one another.
For instance, the very long
opening credit sequence, which
introduces the audience to the
characters of the Watchmen,
slows down the plot rather than
accelerating it. The audience is
forced to place the murder of the
Comedian that began the movie
into the recess of their memory
as the film makes us learn about
each and every (boringly) flawed
member of the Watchmen before
allowing us to refocus on the
mystery at hand.

thorough depiction of each of
their favorite characters, on film
it is more cumbersome than
entertaining. The stories and

intense character' development
that follow the opening sequence
meticulously continue to elaborate on the complexities of the
Watchmen.
By the time Snyder finally
decides to resume the plot, somewhere around the hour-and-ahalf mark, the audience has likely forgotten that there was a
murder mystery story to begin
with. The initially striking slowmo sequences eventually get
fetishized to the point of exhaustion. Luckily, the second half of
the movie kicks into a more
interesting discussion of morality than the first half. And the
twisted ending that brings salva-

tion to mankind at a huge moral
price helps the audience to, for
the most part, forgive the endless
naval-gazing.

Nevertheless, the collage quality
makes the movie seem cumbersome and long. Snyder may have

of "Watchmen" to appeal to both

in satisfying readers of the
graphic novel, and helping nonreaders, like me, to understand

and making at least

Kendal Rinko
friend.
Kickin' the Bucket
Heading off
with
six
other
Swarth-more seniors to the sunny skies
ofSan Francisco, I found myself making
pancakes in a rather fab hostel, exploring the disturbing and yet captivating
Alcatraz prison cells, biking from
Fisherman's Wharf over the beautiful
Golden Gate Bridge (although, I must
admit I forgot that hills would be
involved!), attempting to blend in with
the Golden Gate Park hippie culture
(sadly, to no avail), waltzing my way
through the Castro (by far the best party
life), orienteering my way to the house
of a dear friend, unexpectedly getting
more than my money's worth of a $lO
haircut amid wonderful conversation
with a Bolivian peluquera and her son,
and, finally, eating my way through the
delicious delights of Mexican food, clam
chowder and 2 a.m. fresh donuts almost
every night. Oh, and did I forget to mention that oh-so-awesome trolley driver
who joined us in chorus every time we
shouted "ohhh-nine!" on our way
through the hills of the San Francisco
streets?
Now, that was a ride. Trying to find a
way out of a long, heated discussion
with a pleasant Alaskan couple in love
with Palin and very openly expressing
different views from our crew about the
public education system and why there
are so many "kinks," one of my girls and
I, hanging off of the trolley car in pure
excitement, began to shout "Oh nine!"
and soon, the trolley driver, Carlos,
began to play along with our chorus
line, pointing out the shoe stores, to our
"SHOOOOES!" response and pointing
out the liquor store, to our "LIQUOOR!"
response. Like little lemmings, we began
to repeat everything he said, and soon
he joined in our bliss by shouting, "Ohh
nine!" on his microphone as he rang the
trolley bell! Before we knew it, the entire
trolley was shouting "Ohh nine!" and
even the passers-by, young and old,
stopped on the street to give us a little
"Ohh nine!" love. While I cannot say
that everyone in my crew took pride in
this attention (remember one cutie who
slinked under his hoodie in pure embarrassment), every time we passed Carlos
over the next week, we'd point to him
from the street, he'd point back
and
almost in pure unison, we'd all shout
"Ohhh nine!" only to receive another
lemming-like chorus of "ohh nine!" from
the new passengers on his boat.
Of course, by now, these spontaneous
escapades are expected. What I did not
foresee, however, was that I would make
new connections among my own group
of friends this past week. There were a
few friends on our trip I've never really
sat down with one-on-one, and on this
break I finally had the chance to. I

it ever has in the past four
(seven) years. While I am delighted to
converse in Spanish without throwing
in an apologetic wince afterward for
the bewildered addressee, speaking
Spanish all the time has started to mess
with the only language I really know
down to its little semantic roots
ingles (although that certainly doesn't
stop me from loudly and irresponsibly
claiming fluency in any number of languages). Recently, when I traveled to
Berlin, I was more then a little perturbed to find myself uttering phrases
like, "How much cost a sandwich?" or
"Did you pass the day well?"
Spurred by this, I began noting in
conveniently bolded list fashion what
ways the Spanish way of life has
changed me, and one way it definitely
has not. Below, I have enumerated
Spanish customs to which I have
responded with a hearty "Si, sehor!"
and one in which I declare, "Hombre,
no!"

jGuapa!: In Spain, it is common to
call nearly all females, typically those
who are younger than you, "guapa" or
"beautiful." Teens say it to one another,
shopkeepers to customers, professors to
students and so on. Its frequent use has
left it with pretty much no connotation
at all (unless, of course, you add connotation with creepy I-am-touching-yourbody-with-my-eyes stares) but I still
enjoy the friendliness it engenders.
That and my cripplingly low selfesteem needs all the lovin' it can get,
even if that lovin' is from a store clerk
nervously watching me devastate the
local supermercado's supply of flan.
Bar none: I have really come to love
frequenting bars here, mostly for the
friendly and frequently noisy ambience
it provides as I wordreference.com the
crap out of my latest essay. While I
think bars are regarded as pick-up sites
in the States (I am not sure as I am
underage and have never attempted to
illegally enter -with any permutation of
a forged identification an establishment at which alcohol is being served),
the bars here are completely stigmafree. People enter into the bars at all
hours of the day for una copa as an
afternoon snack or even to take something for breakfast. There isn't anything like a typical barfly here either.
Walking into a bar on a normal weekday night, I expect to find everyone
from an abuela to a gaggle of teens to a
family of eight loudly enjoying a
refreshing cana of cerveza.
Milking it: I am not big on milk to
begin with (likely why my knee joints
sound like old Velcro ripping every
time I bend down), but I actually get a
little queasy thinking about warm
milk. I think what grosses me out is

that the temperature reminds me I am
drinking what is effectively cow juice.
However, my first morning here, my

Student offers course on native California tribes
BY DAISY SCHMITT
dschmitl@swarthmore.edu

A student-taught addition to
the sociology and anthropology
department's

curriculum,
"Native California: The Wind
in a Jar," has brought a new
perspective to Swarthmore.
Started by Crystal Richardson
'O9, the class is part of her
effort to start a discussion
about the issues facing native
Californians. The
course
works in sections, first discussing the history and traditions of Northwestern tribes,
then moving on to how these
traditions affected the arrival
of settlers, and finally learning
about the modern-day native
Californian experience. The
class meets once a week for
two hours, usually beginning
with a film and spending the
rest of the time with a discussion of readings.

I'm pretty familiar. I've been

open-ended discussions, which
are designed to get students

questions from her students

yet intense, classroom dynamic. At one point, Richardson
joked that the extent to which

Over a half-full jug of apple

blackberries,
Richardson
speaks, often using her hands,
of the modern native's experience in California, and in so
doing weaves her personal
knowledge into the texts. "I

Richardson said. "This is a

"Crystal is

and has a lot

one of the students in the class.
"I thought I was going to
have to cut the course short,
because with only two students
that's a lot of weight for discussion for each person," said
Richardson. "But we've actually been going five to fifteen
minutes over every class period." She also commented on
her freedom to tailor the class
March 19,2009

material to fit the interests of
the students, calling the experience "unique."
The course is unusual in
another way. Until now, as
Richardson pointed out, there
have been few courses of this
nature at Swarthmore, with
the exception of the Structure
of Navajo course offered by the
linguistics
department.
"Previously there was virtually no indigenous course material, no course of study, at

Swarthmore. And this semester, not only do they have my
course, but they also have the
Lenape language course and
the Navajo language course in
linguistics. And so there are
whole bunch of things that are
happening, which is a first for
Swarthmore,"
Richardson
said.
Apart from the course and
the usual rigors of Swarthmore
life,
Richardson's
work
organizing
includes
the
upcoming Indigenous Women's
Conference, which will take
place March 26-28. The conference's focus is to "address race,
place, culture, and continuity
for California natives," and it
will feature ten prominent
female native Californian
activists. "It's quite a time
commitment, considering I

have the double-thesis and the
conference going on, and the
course, and then
life," said
Richardson, going on quickly
to add, "The students in the
course are
really understanding the course material
and they're highly interested,
so even though it's just a couple students, I think it's a completely
worthwhile
time
endeavor."
Nakhoda's enthusiasm for
the course's material is clear.
"The most valuable lesson has
been becoming aware of the
extent of ignorance and misconception
many
around
Native American issues, such
as history, the native world
view, and especially current
struggles," he said. "Much of
the Native American dialogue
is thought to be an artifact of
history, rather than addressing
current legal and cultural
issues."
That Swarthmore is expanding its academic horizons to
include this important area of
study is something of which to
take note. This newfound interest in Native American studies
marks the beginning of what
will hopefully be a very positive trend in the courses available to the Swarthmore student body.

principle."

This passage comes
from Edgar Allen Poe. I
first encountered it in the
book "The Imp of the
Mind," by psychologist
Lee Baer, which is considered something of the
bible on purely-obsessional OCD. Baer is convinced that such perverse thoughts are not
exclusive to obsessivecompulsives; the human
mind percolates at a
tremendous rate and
some of the arbitrary
images it conjures are
inevitably

unpleasant.
Yet while a healthy person can recognize these
thoughts as a random
product of an active

mind, the obsessive-compulsive questions their
significance. Gazing over
Poe's abyss he wonders,
horrified, if he secretly
but sincerely desires to
jump, and if he might at
some point lose his senses and do so.
Desperately,
he
attempts to convince
himself that the thought
is meaningless, and so
eliminate it. Yet because
of the perverse quality of

recur with greater frequency
and strength.
Saint John of the Cross,
in his writings, identified
the paradoxical reinforcement of upsetting
thoughts: when a devotee
prays, he writes, the
Devil may distract him
with "fowl and impure
thoughts
Those who
attribute any importance
to such thoughts, therefore, do not even dare
look at anything or think
about anything lest they
thereupon stumble into

In some who are
troubled with this bad
humor the trial reaches
such a point that they
clearly feel that the devil

directly below a bath-

greeted by a sudden cas-

cade of fresh sewage. I
would have requested to
move, but was preoccupied by the fact that I was
sort of going insane.
Imagine
the worst
thing in the world.
I did not understand
that which I suffered
from. I recognized very
quickly that my mind
was fixating uncontrollably on things that disturbed me, but I did not
know why. I only knew
that they were horrible
and that they would not
stop. My grades began to
slip. Even though I was
no longer taking medication I began to again
indulge in marathon sixhour naps. I ate nothing
but grilled cheese sand-

ten pounds. I drank more
on weekends, never to
excess necessarily; I

never blacked out, no one
noticed or tried to intervene. But there were
nights when, quite deliberately, I would increase
my intake of alcohol to
quiet the voices in my
head.
Imagine
the worst
thing in the world.
The
disorder evidenced itself in the most
absurd situations. I performed
a
in
Tom
Stoppard play and it was
there when I sat backstage,
wearing
full
British military regalia
and rehearsing shouted
lines about gazebos. I
somehow allowed myself
to be talked into representing my sketch comedy troupe at the annual
"Mr. Swarthmore" competition, and it was there
as I marched down the
runway to "Hot-Blooded"
by Foreigner. I was in a
friend's triple in Willets
on a Friday night and we
all bounced around and
sang along to terrible
music together and it was
there. I recognize a surreal quality, looking back
at that evening; "Numa
Numa," blaring from the
speaker, my mind humming with atrocity.
My friends were oblivious. Such was the nature
of my condition. As Baer
remarks,
intrusive
thoughts are usually not
what "one discusses in
polite cocktail-party conversation." There were
moments when they
noticed my unhappiness
and tried to bring me out
of it, and I remain grateful for them. But human
especially
contact,
involving people that I
cared about, was a trigger for my symptoms,
and there were instances
when even basic social
interaction became agonizing. I had a friend who
delighted in calling me
"emo." When I was being
particularly melancholic,
she would jokingly press
her thumb and forefinger
together as if holding
something
small and
sharp, and then move her
fingers over her arm in a
teasing pantomime of
self-mutilation. And I
would smile and I'd do it
too, and we'd laugh
together and the whole
time I'd be thinking to
myself: ever tried it,
babe? It's not as much
fun as it sounds.
Imagine

Again and again I
asked my therapist for an
explanation of what I was
experiencing, but she
was content week after
week to offer glib reassurances. Despite my
obvious unhappiness she
neither recognized my
symptoms nor, apparently, consulted peers or reference materials that
would have allowed her
to identify it. I made my
initial diagnosis myself,
Internet,
over
the
because this is apparently the first place one
should go for psychological counsel. I read the
Wikipedia entry on OCD,
and right there on the
first goddamn page were
the exact symptoms I was
suffering from.
With an explanation, I
decided, I had no need for
further treatment, and
things were quieter. I
returned home to work at
the bookstore. I carried
textbooks back and forth,
and I locked myself in the
bathroom and imagined
my fist through the mirror. I stood by the third
floor window and gazed
out. I helped customers
and itched in strange
places. Occasionally I
would

say

enough,

I

would tell my mother as
she drove me to work
that I couldn't manage it
that day. She'd argue a
bit but eventually relent,
and bring me back home
to play videogames. She
seemed disappointed. I
certainly was.
I sought out a new
at
therapist
home.
Within an hour he confirmed my diagnosis and

recommended

I
seek
treatment. My family was
vacationing on Cape Cod

that week and I had peace

again, for a little while.
Here I played videogames

on my computer, read
downloaded
comic books, walked on
the beach and scratched
illegally

viciously at my scalp at
odd moments. And if I
paused by the kitchen
implements, if I glanced
at a stranger and my fingers flexed and

I sudden-

ly turned away, then no

one noticed.
We went home and I
went back to work. I lasted about two days. The
exact circumstances of
my breakdown are both
disturbing and deeply personal, and although I have
tried to be honest in this
column I think it best that
I do not describe them
explicitly.
Understand
that I never deliberately
hurt myself. But one
morning I miscalculated, I
pressed myself a little too
hard, and it was no longer
possible to deny my distress. My mother called
my job to say I would need
to miss work, due to illness, and brought me to
the car. We drove my sister to work, together,
without speaking.
Imagine
the worst
thing in the world.
She clutched my hand
and did not let go. We did
not speak. We were going
to the hospital.

DU continues support for Genderfuck and Sager
To the Editor:
As most of the campus is aware, the Delta
Upsilon Fraternity has helped host the
Sager/Genderfuck Party for the past two
years. Although the Sager Symposium
Planning Committee wishes to be disassociated from the Genderfuck Party, DU will continue its support for the party. We collectively made this decision because we believe that
the party will continue to be a night of gender-bending and experimentation. This year,
DU as well as the other coordinators of the

Genderfuck Party
will place an even
greater emphasis on the safety of women,
queer and transgender individuals; we will
use all available resources to see this
through. On a similar note, DU wishes to
offer our Lodge to the Sager Symposium as a
location for discussions, speeches and film
screenings. Thank you for your time. We
hope to see you all at the Genderfuck Party
on April 4 at DU, the WRC and Olde Club.

Environmental activism flourishing through EJ's efforts
To the Editor:
I would like to supplement the article
about activism that was written last week by
Hannah Purkey. While I am impressed by the
range and the influence of the activists and
campaigns that were mentioned, I want to
make sure that credit goes to some ofSwat's
environmental activists as well.
In 1996, Swarthmore students were a part
of a larger community campaign in Chester
to bring the first case of environmental
racism to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
They sought to ensure that clean air and
clean water would be preserved as basic
rights for everyone, regardless of income or
race.

These efforts continue with the
Environmental Justice group (EJ), which
meets Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. in the Lang
Center with the DelCo Alliance, which is
composed of Chester community members.
Last year, this committee prevented a tire
incinerator plant from coming into the area
and adding further toxic materials to air that
is already saturated with the particulates
from medical treatment and waste-burning
plants. This Saturday there will be a direct
action from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. demanding
cleaner air and environmental equity with
the DelCo Alliance. Contact ej@sccs.swarthmore.edu for more information.

Don't forget about the other activists on our campus
To the Editor:
The captivating cover of the last week's
Phoenix led me to read the article entitled
shapes
"Activism
student
life
at
Swarthmore" with excitement. However, my
excitement turned into disappointment after
reading the section entitled "Activism today."
While I realize that "chronicling the history
ofactivism at Swarthmore" is impossible to
do in a two-page spread, the incomplete picture of today's activism neglects to mention
the valuable efforts of many student organizations working hard for social change.
I am hoping that this article is part of a
longer series that could more adequately cap-

ture the activism that is alive at Swarthmore.
Mentioning only STAND and WNR as examples ofactivist groups is akin to picking two
plants to represent the entire Scott
Aboretum. There is rich diversity in terms of

student activist groups, including several
that use protests and mass demonstrations as
a means to shake both Swarthmore and the
world.
Please do not delete this work from the
richness of the history of social justice
activism at Swarthmore. I look forward to a
more complete picture in the coming editions.

The media's watchmen
This past Thursday marked a watershed

moment in the history of television news. It
wasn’t necessarily the interview itself, between
“Daily Show” host Jon Stewart and Jim Cramer
of CNBC’s “Mad Money”; neither was it the fact
that an ostensibly irreverent comedy show got
so much coverage after the fact by “serious”
news networks; nor, even, was it that Stewart
definitively exposed this classification as a
ridiculous and malicious fallacy. The importance of Thursday’s interview can be summed
up in Stewart’s brief send-off to his audience: “I
hope that was as uncomfortable to watch as it
David Sterngold
was to do.” It was that Stewart’s show, to put it
Not
Pragmatism
Idealism
succinctly, had balls.
This lack of journalistic, er, courage, has
come to define the television news industry.
Cramer and CNBC may have been the direct target of the "Daily Show" offensive, but only because their offenses were the most obvious, and, in light of the
financial crisis about which they got almost nothing right, the most egregious.
The larger problem is that their mistakes
failing to ask the hard questions
of businesses and executives; failing to see beyond cursory examinations of
stock prices and dividends into the deeper flaws of the economy; failing, in the
case ofCramer, to predict the total collapse of a financial giant like Bear Sterns
(in fact pleading with investors to buy Bear stock within months ofits downfall)
are part of a malignant trend that has long since metastasized to stations covering other types of news. The trend is of fusing the news business
with the entertainment business only maybe theformer has been swallowed
up by the latter.
In a 1985 book, "Amusing Ourselves to Death," communications theorist
Neil Postman argued that television would destroy reasoned political discourse. As a medium, it is better suited to thirty-second sound clips and slogans than to the logical, structured, detailed arguments of the pen or podium.
Indeed, the state of modern television news illustrates that there is more to
Postman's argument than simple Luddism. The modern newscaster is better
trained in speech delivery and teleprompting than in actual reporting, and
agencies choose their lead anchors by carefully calculating their "trustability"
(middle-aged male WASPs consistently get the best ratings, go figure). That
FOX News can boast of being the most popular cable news channel should confirm our suspicions; that "The O'Reilly Factor" can boast of being its most pop-

ular show, even more so.
Every time I walk into my local YMCA lounge I am confronted with an
O'Reilly or a Hannity on the large, prominent flatscreen. Coming from a rural,
conservative area that strongly identifies with the traditional, "family values"
ethic, I realize there is more to these pundit's popularity thantheir sheer entertainment value. But consider, for a second, the aesthetic feel of any given show
on FOX, or on MSNBC, its liberal analog.
They begin with the flourishing of computer graphics and the trumpeting
of theme songs. We are confronted with a host, or hosts, who read 20-second
blurbs about such critically important stories as "Paris Hilton in Prison" off a
prompter. The actual amount of screen space has been shrinking steadily for
years, due to increasingly prominent and flashy borders, tickers, logos and slogans that wrap the show in a bright, colorful glow. At some point, the host may
welcome a guest for an interview or debate. Often (as on CNBC), the guest is
asked penetrating questions like: "So, how does it feel to be a billionaire?" Or,
at the other extreme (typical of FOX shows like "The O'Reilly Factor"), the
guest functions as a radical, less-than-intellectual straw man, easily torn to
pieces by the courageous, patriotic, blue-collar host.
But I am tackling a stale argument. Stephen Colbert's popular "Colbert
Report" already functions as a pastiche of the news industry's fetish with
entertainment, egoism and staunch Americo-centrism. If there is any precedent for Jon Stewart's not-really-so-comedic skewering of Jim Cramer, it is
Colbert's not-really-so-comedic critique of the Bush administration in his infamous speech at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2006. Interestingly
enough, mainstream television news networks took criticism at the time for
focusing their coverage on other aspects of the dinner and paying little attention to Colbert's speech.
So, somehow we have come to the point where two self-labeled comedians
are able to make much more pointed and even more serious criticisms of pressing issues than any other personality on television news. It might be going too
far to suggest that "South Park," another Comedy Central show, engages in
this same serious criticism but Andrew SullivanofThe Atlantic did just this
in his blogged response to the Stewart debate. Surely, herein lies a very troubling philosophical statement about contemporary media culture, or perhaps
simply contemporary culture in general.
Still, we can take something heartening away from the "Daily Show"
debate. The fact is, the interview with Jim Cramer really was difficult to watch
at points painfully, cringingly so. The idea that we watched an irreverent
comedy show despite this means that we are still capable of valuing true, informational journalism over pure entertainment. Maybe the "serious" news
shows should take a hint.
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Jon Stewart and "The Daily Show," of course.

The Pope courts a contraception controversy
When Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope,
the Catholic right rejoiced. Michael S. Rose, in "The
Man who was Ratzinger" wrote that as Pope,
Ratzinger "will put to flight the reformists of the
Catholic left." The head of the arch-conservative
Catholics League said of Catholic liberals, "We expect
that the weeping and gnashing of teeth will begin
soon."
In the first couple years of his tenure, however,
Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict) disappointed these
Catholic reactionaries. Writing last April in Slate,
Catholic liberal Michael Sean Winters argued that
Ratzinger's politics appeared to be far less conservative than anyone had anticipated, citing the Pope's
moderate appointments, the Pope's belief that even
pro-choice politicians should be granted communion,
and the Pope's sacking of Vatican officials associated
with the Pinochet regime. In short, Benedict proved
that he was capable of being the moderate leader of a
modernizing Church. Winters concluded, "If there is
any gnashing of teeth, it will be coming from the
bleachers on the far right."
The last few months have proven just how wrong
Winter's appraisal was. A couple of days before last
Christmas, the Pope gave a speech where he declared
queer behavior, or any behavior that departed from
traditional heterosexual norm's, to amount to a
"destruction of God's work" and equated the fight to
save his version of human morality with the fight to
save the rainforest. Then, in February, Benedict overruled a prior papal decision to excommunicate members of the Society of Saint Pius, a far-right Catholic
sect. When it was revealed that the most prominent

member of the Society was Richard Williamson, a
Holocaust-denying former arch-bishop, Benedict apologized and acknowledged that "mistakes" had been
made. But Benedict's decision to overturn the prior
papal decree prompted even relatively conservative
Catholics to ask why Benedict saw the Church's reconciliation with Catholicism's extreme right to be
necessary.

Then, last Tuesday, Benedict struck again.
Addressing journalists on a flight to Cameroon,
Benedict said that AIDS "cannot be overcome by
money alone...cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the prob-

lems."
The Pope is partially right, of course. Condoms, in
of themselves, will not be able to halt the spread of
AIDS. But the Pope's radical statement, that condoms
"aggravate" the spread of HIV, is undercut by nearly
every study that examines the claim. Condom distribution, combined with contraceptive education, has
been proven to be one of the most effective ways to
prevent the spread of AIDS in the developed and undeveloped world. According to an editorial in
Wednesday's edition of the New York Times, "The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites
'comprehensive and conclusive' evidence that latex
condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are
'highly effective' in preventing heterosexual transmission of the virus that causes AIDS."
The Pope's statement did not attract immediate
controversy because people were surprised by its
anti-contraceptive stand. The Church decided against
endorsing non-natural contraceptives in the mid-

1960's and has been opposed to most contraceptive
techniques ever since. Benedict had already
expressed his skepticism of prophylactic utility
before, arguing that abstinence remained the only
"fail-safe" way to prevent the spread of HIV. But while
some of the Pope's earlier statement displayed a simplistic view of HIV prevention and a moral opposition
to the use of contraceptives, Tuesday marked the first
time that the Pope openly put forth such a clearly

counterfactual claim.
There are over 100 million Catholics in Africa and
Catholicism represents one of the fastest growing religions on the continent. The Church's teachings on
contraceptive education are, therefore, crucial to the
continent's fight against the AIDS epidemic. Rebecca
Hodes, director of the Treatment Action Campaign in
South Africa, said the Pope's statement "conveys that
religious dogma is more important to him than the
lives of Africans." Hodes is working in a country
where authority figures have misled citizens about
AIDS prevention techniques many times before. We
are disappointed to see that the Pope has contributed
to this trend.
While we respect the Pope's philosophical opposition to the use of condoms, the fact of the matter
remains that his claims are empirically incorrect.
And lest anyone confuse the Pope's opinions on contraception with the Catholic Church's as a whole,
other prominent leaders within the Church, including
the retired arch-bishop of Milan, Carlo Maria Martini,
believe that the Church should not reject the use of
condoms outright, as "the use of prophylactics can, in
some situations, constitute a lesser evil."

So while I am glad Senator Grassley is
the only one to offer a concrete solution
(kill yourselves, AIG guys), I hope it's
not the path taken. Let these executives
clean up the mess that they created, but
also let there be explicit restrictions on
their methods. And guarantee that they

Let the Ponzi victims receive full

sympathy from all of us, but also let
them know that they should suffer the

Accountability by itself isn't going to

Men's lacrosse stumbles before Centennial schedule

BY EMILY BRYANT

ebryantl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore men's lacrosse team (1-2) lost two
tough contests over spring break.
The men's team traveled to Long Island to play the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Mariners on Sunday,
March 8. They lost a hard fought battle, 7-5, in nonconference action. Gavin Musynske 10 scored two
goals, while John Bukawyn 'l2, Ben Young 'O9 and
Tyler Bradshaw 'lO each added a point. The Garnet
amassed a three-point lead by halftime by capitalizing
on assists and one-man-up opportunities.
However, they were not able to maintain momentum going into the second half. The Garnet were
plagued by penalties and were ultimately unable to
hold off the Mariners' charge.
"I think we have been playing well, but we have
been making mistakes that have been costing us
games," Matt Bowers 'l2 said. "We really need to work
on our finishing and making better decisions."
The Garnet's next contest was also a nail-biter. The

men fell 6-4 to the College of Wooster in a non-conference game at home on Wednesday, March 11. David
DeSimone 11 tallied two goals and five ground balls,
and Bradshaw notched a goal, an assist and five
ground balls for Swarthmore in the loss.
The team worked hard over break, focusing on
preparation for the upcoming Centennial Conference
season, which is enough to pose a real challenge to

defensive squad has proven itself worthy early on, but
is wary of the large void left by the graduation of last
year's line that it must continue to develop in order to
be able to truly replace.
"We have some big shoes to fill. We graduated two
long-time starters last year, so we are looking to build
this season," Zach Leonard 'l2 said. "Our goalie
[Kevin Friedenberg 10] has been playing really well,
so that has been a big help."
Despite the losses, the Garnet defense is in good
hands. They will be led this season by veteran Jesse
Handler 'O9, as well as defensive midfielder Jacob
Metzger 'lO and Max Wilson 'lO.
In the meantime, the men are working hard in
anticipation for upcoming conference action.
Swarthmore men's lacrosse will kickoff the
Centennial Conference schedule by heading off to
Dickinson to take on the Rams this Saturday, March

any collegiate squad.

"I think spring break training was really productive," said Bowers. "We are looking forward to our
conference games. Our conference is one of the best in
Division 111, so they will be the real test."
The team boasts a strong returning offensive line,
consisting of co-captain Stelios Wilson 'O9, Musynske
and Bradshaw. All three have proven themselves to be
threats on the field, and they are looking forward to
continue to be successful this season.

Washington's Will Mari gives an etymology lesson
BY WILL MARI

DAILYUW.COM, MAR. IB

The madness of March brings with it
a whole hustling host of intriguing basketball words, with one of the more
beguiling of these being "seed." I have to
thank Zac Mahlum for suggesting that
we dig into it, so to speak, and find out
where it came from.
We all know, of course, that a seed is
a "ripened plant ovule containing an
embryo," as the American Heritage
Dictionary defines it, "chiefly, when in
the form of 'grains' or small roundish
bodies," as the Oxford English
Dictionary further elaborates.
A "seed" in sporting terms is a player
or team placed in a tournament; "to
seed" is to arrange the contestants,
especially the higher-ranked teams, so

that they encounter one another in the
later phases of the championships on
more or less equal grounds (after having fought their way through the earlier

related to the same Germanic root as
the word "sow."
So what does this have to do with

It is a very old word indeed, first popping up, as seeds-tend to do, in the early
9th century, with its earliest forms coming to us from the Old English saed,
from the Old Frisian word sed, the Old
Saxon sad, the Middle Dutch saet (the
modern Dutch word being zaad) and the
Old High German word sat (the modern
German being saat).
It may ultimately (and a tad speculatively, I must confess, as I am only an
amateur at this level) arise from the
very old Gothic word seds (the "d"
standing in for a Germanic letter without an English equivalent), from manaseds, meaning "mankind," but also

The answer: lawn tennis.
Starting around the turn of the last
century, perhaps because the game was
played on manicured, seeded lawns, the
idea of carefully "seeding" tournaments
sprang up, with this handy definition
from Spalding's Lawn Tennis Annual,
from 1900: "It is generally advisable to
'seed' the draw in handicap tournaments so that the players in each class
shall be separated as far as possible one
from another."
An article from the June 23, 1924
issue of the London Times expounds on
this idea, "This year, for the first time,
the draw has been 'seeded.'
In some
countries the seeding is designed to

...

keep the better players apart until the
final stages." The 1933 Aldin Book of

Outdoor Games, with rules for various
sports, including tennis, brings up the
word as a noun for the first time, with
this offbeat line, '"But why put my
beloved lawners last?' wails the
Thibetan 'seed.'" ("Thibet" being a variant of "Tibet").
A seed-field, incidentally, is what it
reads like: a field of sowed seeds. A good
early example can be found in 1831, in
Sartor Resartus, by the enigmatic
British historian Thomas Carlyle (17951881), with the line, "For a speculative
man, 'whose seedfield,' in the sublime
words of the Poet, 'is Time,' no conquest
is important but that of new ideas."
So now you know what seeds have to
do with basketball. Here's to the
Huskies and their seeding!

Parikh, Kramer dominate Pennsylvania State Open
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY DANNY FRIEL

dfhell@swarthmore.edu

For the second year in a row,
it was all Swarthmore in the
finals of the Pennsylvania State
Open badminton tournament.
Last year, Kim Kramer 'lO
defeated teammate Maithili
Parikh 'lO in the finals of the
tournament, which, as an
'open' tournament, features the
most elite level of players in
Pennsylvania, not just NCAA
Division 111 athletes.
This year, Parikh turned the
tables on Kramer, winning the
title outright at Albright
College's
Bollman
Center
Gymnasium. To boot, the talented pair also won the
women's doubles bracket.
It was a familiar outcome for
the pair. In separate interviews,
each admitted that the end
result of one of a match
between the two is often a function of whichever one of the two
is "having a better day." Such is
the predicament for a team that
boasts two champions.
The tournament took place

within the span of a single day,
with the first round of matches
starting at 9:00 a.m.
"It was very tiring," Kramer
said, explaining that for those
players entered in all three
events
singles, doubles and
mixed-doubles the event was
especially taxing. Kramer estimated that matches usually
last from about 20 minutes to
an hour or more.
For players reaching the
finals of multiple events, like
Kramer and Parikh, this translates to many hours of competition; Kramer played a total of
12 matches by the end of the

in a double

format. So
when a team loses its first

C bracket. Lama and Xiang won
the remainder of their matches
to come out of top of the C
bracket.
As the remainder of the
squad sets its sights on the
2009-2010 season, Kramer points
out that a particular goal is
especially pressing: recruiting
well. "We only have two sophomores and no freshmen, so we

are going to be recruiting big

breathing room would lend
itself well to the Garnet, which
will take a big hit when the
class of 2010 graduates. "The
main goal is to get a new generation of players," Kramer
added.
Parikh noted that it would
be especially helpful "if we
could recruit some players who
are already experienced." She
went on to explain that the
squad often is larger at the
beginning of the season than it
is at the end of the season, as
players who decided to give the
sport a try end up losing inter-

est.

However, an influx of fresh
talent will help the Garnet
maintain its well-deserved reputation as a powerhouse, and
ultimately "qualify some players for collegiate nationals,"
Kramer predicted.

Face Shields
Helmets were made a
requirement for all new
players entering the
league in the 1979-80 season, but there were still
veterans playing without
any protective headgear
as recently as 15 years
ago. Although this seems

to be a needless danger to
most people, there still

remains a form of pride
surrounding players who
refuse to wear helmets.
This is hard to forget considering the frequency
with which announcers
comment on the fact that
Sharks general manager
Doug Wilson was one of
the last players to decide
to make the switch to
wearing a helmet whenever he is featured on a
broadcast.
All current players in
the league do wear helmets, however there is no
requirement for players
to wear any form of face
shields or masks. These
shields and masks have
been shown to severely
reduce the number of

head injuries reported by
players, yet still a significant number of NHL play-

ers do not wear them.
Several articles in the
Journal of the American
Medical Association as
well as the American
Sports
Journal
of
Medicine show that a
majority of injuries suffered by hockey players
ofall ages are facial lacerations and other head and
neck injuries and that the

reduced the risks of these

studies also debunked the
myth that wearing masks
influenced style of play
changes that eventually
lead to more serious
injuries.

The

more advanced

training becomes and the
more sophisticated equip-

ment is, the more protec-

tion players need to prevent injuries. It is understandable if players are
resistant to wearing full

metal masks like those
required in intercollegiate play, but there is
very little excuse for not
wearing face shields.

Remenda, an ex-coach, is
confused about when officials distinguish between

the players committing

understanding.
Hockey doesn't need

more rules. It needs
clearer definitions of the
rules it already has and
consistency amongst officials in calling them.
Whenever players drop
their gloves, it should be
considered a fight, and
five-minute major penalties should be awarded.
The league should also
consider changing the
rule to implement four-onfour play after a fight
instead of continuing fiveon-five play and simply
punishing the fight's participants. This further dis-

couragement

against
fighting might be necessary after the public con-

cern over the recent death
of a minor league player
when his head hit the ice
after a fight. While there
has been a crackdown on
penalties like slashing
this season, truly dangerous penalties like boarding and checking from
going
behind
are
uncalled.
A study in the Clinical
journal
of
Sports
Medicine showed a distinct decrease in injuries
after the 1989 enforcement
of the checking from
behind rule, but this rule
does not do any good if
officials do not aggressively enforce it. It is commendable that this rule
requires an automatic
major penalty, however
this should also apply to
rules such as boarding,
which can be a minor or
major penalty determined
at the discretion of thereferee.
These are not very big
changes but ones that
could significantly'reduce
the number of injuries
players receive and discourage some of the most
dangerous play. Fewer
injuries
mean
some
much-needed rest for the
team doctors, and more
time for fans to enjoy
their favorite players on
the ice instead of in the
training room.

Baseball bounces back after shaky spring break
BY JARED NOLAN
jnolanl@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore baseball stayed busy over spring break, playing nine games over nine days. The team spent the first half
of the week in Arizona and played two games against PittBradford (3-1) and four against Wesleyan (3-3). The Garnet
picked up a win against each team to leave the American
Southwest with a 3-5 overall record.
Back on the East Coast, Swarthmore heated up against
Baptist Bible (0-1), scoring 21 runs while only allowing three
in a lopsided victory. The success continued the following
day when the Garnet swept a double-header against SUNY IT
(3-7) on the last day of spring break. Swarthmore fell behind
early in both games but managed to rally and end spring
break with a 6-5 winning record.
Coming into the season, the Garnet set a goal to remain
competitive in every game and the team has met that objective. "So far we are heading to each game with a focused
approach," head coach Stan Exeter said. "We have been competing in every game to the last pitch." Thus far, the Garnet
has not lost by more than eight runs, and the average deficit
for a defeat is just over four runs, so all of the losses have
been close. Also, the team has won a game against every college faced, indicating that no opponent has been out of the
Garnet's league.
Overall, Exeter commended his players' effort over the
grueling spring break. "This year the schedule was more
challenging in quality of teams and number of games," he
said. "It was a very aggressive schedule, and the team handled it very well."
The number of games also allowed many different players
to see action in varied combinations and line-ups, and the
back-to-back games and doubleheaders played to the
depth.
Garnet's biggest strength
With 14 new faces on the team, Swarthmore has much
more to work with this year and has plugged some holes in
the line-up, but the biggest strength also created the greatest
weakness. "[Our] weakness is we are still a young team,"
Exeter said. He believes his players just need to gain more
experience and stop making the same mistakes in order to
succeed.
In spite of limited collegiate experience, many of Exeter's
first-year players are proving to be successful. Mike
Waterhouse 'l2, who has been selected as the Centennial
Conference Hitter of the Week, has safely hit in all seven
games he has started and leads the team in batting average
and slugging percentage. Among all the Garnet pitchers,
Kyle Crawford 'l2 has struck out the most batters. Spencer
Ross 'l2, Anthony Montalbano 'l2 and Michael Cameron 'l2
have all hit home runs and are among the RBI leaders for
Swarthmore.
Cameron made an especially strong contribution in an
away contest against Neumann College that resulted in a 2010 Garnet victory.
Two clutch home runs by the first-year helped
Swarthmore put the game out of reach in the eighth inning,
at which a setting sun caused the game to be called.
Cameron and classmate Waterhouse each contribued four
runs in the win, while Ben Schneiderman 'lladded three.
Seven other Garnet baseballers tagged home plate, a testament to the depth of the large squad.
While the team saw much improvement come to fruition
after spring break, there are still some concerns that must be
addressed before conference games begin in a little under a
week. "We need to sure up our pitching rotation and just get
more experienced," Exeter said. "This week leading up to
conference play is again pretty challenging." Indeed, the
Garnet finished 3-15 against Centennial Conferenece opponents last year, despite having a less discouraging 10-21
record when taking into account games against non-conference opponents.
Swarthmore's current record of 7-5 is a touch ahead of its
pre-conference record from 2008, when the Garnet were 6-5
before opening the season at Washington.
The Centennial Conference baseball season will kick off
on March 24, when Swarthmore will travel to Muhlenberg (59). Swarthmore currently has the best record in the conference, which is encouraging though it is important to note
that each team has faced different opponents thus far.
Only two more teams on the 2009 schedule separate
Swarthmore from Centennial Conference opponents. The
Garnet will have to finals opporunities for a pre-conference
tune-up this weekend, when the squad will travel to Penn
State-Berks (5-6-1) on Saturday for a double header before
returning home to play on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. against
Misericordia (9-6).

Garnet women rack up national accolades
at national track meet
Caitlin Mullarkey 'O9 continued a banner
year for the Garnet on Saturday by placing fifth
in the national finals of the women's mile at the
2009 NCAA Division 111 Indoor Track & Field
Championships.
Mullarkey qualified for the national meet by
virtue of a school-record provisional cut of
4:59.59 on the way to winning the 2009 E.C.A.C.
Division 111 Indoor Championship.
The performance earned Mullarkey her first
trip to the indoor national meet after missing
the meet for the last three years.
Mullarkey qualified easily for Saturday's
final in 5:00.30, which fielded the top ten qualifying times from the preliminary heats. The
final was a race of strategy, as the pack began at
a slower-than-normal pace before building up
to a sprint to the finish.
The lone Garnet entrant in the national
meet, Mullarkey emerged from the frenzy in
fifth place at 5:00.16, edging two other 5:00s to
finish in the top half of the elite field.
Mullarkey was the top finisher from the
Centennial Conference and from the East
Coast, peaking at the right time after a fourthplace finish at the conference championships.

Miller returns to NCAA swim meet
Four-time All-American Anne Miller 'lO has
earned her third consecutive invitation to the
NCAA Division 111 Swimming and Diving
Championships.
Miller's provisional cut time of 2:06.26, set on
her way to a second-place finish in the 200-yard
butterfly at the 2009 Centennial Conference
Championship, leaves her seeded 15thnationally.

Miller will also compete in the 500-yard
freestyle and the 100-yard "butterfly at the
national meet before finishing with her signa-

ture event.

Miller's Centennial Conference record of
2:02.44, set on the way to a second-place finish
in the 2008 national final, was the fastest time
posted by an underclassman in 2008.

Softball eyes Centennial title after recent near misses

The

Swarthmore softball
team journeyed south this
spring break, opening the 2009
season with- six games in North
Carolina and a tournament in
Salisbury, Md.
After a shaky start, falling 54 and 7-0 in a double-header
against Guilford College and 4-3
in the first game against Peace
College on Tuesday, March 10,
the Garnet began to find their
stride during the second game
against Peace, securing a 9-7
win. The team continued on to
sunny Raleigh, N.C. to play
another double-header against
Meredith College, once again
starting the day with a loss in
the first of the two games and

following with a commanding 60 win in the second game.
On Friday, March 13, the
Garnet women fell to the
University of Mary Washington
in a 5-2 contest. The second
game, scheduled to begin at 4:00
against
Salisbury
host
University, was cancelled on

account of snow.

On Saturday, Swarthmore
showed that this season still has
huge success potential, recording two
victories against
Cabrini College and Wilkes
University, respectively.
The
Cabrini game ended in a 3-2 victory. Co captain and pitcher
Alexandra Zelaski 'O9 held
Cabrini at bay with only two
runs, while Marley Spector 'l2
pitched her first-ever collegiate
game against Wilkes, bringing
:

home a Garnet win with a final
score of 7-5.
While Swarthmore saw
many outstanding individual
spring
performances

break, co-captain Christine
Sendelsky 'O9 stood out by establishing herself as a player to be

Sendelsky
earned
AllCentennial Conference honors,
and with key hits at bat and
consistent contribution, has
proved to be a permanent power
on the field. According to fellow

Saturday."

With some promising new
talent rounding out this year's
roster, the Garnet look to the
remainder of the season with
optimism. Elizabeth Cushing

Women's lacrosse undefeated after 'Tour de South'

BY ANDREW GREENBLATT

The women's lacrosse team
returned unscathed and energized from a "Tour de South"
spring break trip. The Garnet
were victorious in each of two
games over the break, beating
Savannah College of Arts and
Design 18-4 and Greensboro 15-11.
Swarthmore continued to carry
its momentum after returning

home, winning a double-overtime thriller against Widener on
Tuesday to give them a record of

4-0.
In a contest on Sunday,
March 8, Swarthmore showed
signs of its pre-break form, dominating Savannah College ofArts
and Design at the Bees' home
field in Savannah, Georgia, from
the get-go.
Amy Vachal 'll, who had five
goals on the day, scored 32 seconds into the game, and the
Garnet never looked back.
Swarthmore went on rallies
of four, five and six straight
goals during the game, repeating
their impressive defensive per-

formance from their seasonopening

against

Savannah did not score in the
second half.
the
Meanwhile,
Garnet
offense was as balanced as the
defense was stifling, as nine different players for the Garnet put
the ball in the net and combined
for seven assists.
The winning ways continued
in the second matchup of the
this
trip,
time
against
Greensboro
in
College
Greensboro, North Carolina, on
Thursday, March 12, though the
15-11 score was a little less lopsided than the previous game.
"The second game was a little
hard for us because we just got
out of an eight-hour car ride,"
Allison Kelly 'll said. "We were
a little rusty, to say the least."
The 11 goals are the most the
Garnet has surrendered all season. The unusually high total is
largely the result of a late run by

Greensboro.

The Garnet had held it together until the 13 minute mark.
After being up 14-7, thanks to a
run of six straight goals, the
Garnet were faced with a
•

Greensboro surge of four goals
in the final 13 minutes, an effort
that closed the gap but that was
not enough to make up for the
early deficit.
The women carried their
momentum into Tuesday, as the
Garnet won a 13-12 thriller
against Widener in double overtime.
After a 12-12 deadlock after
regulation play, an initial overtime period left both teams still
unable to pull out a victory.
It was Marie Mutryn 'l2 who
put the game away for the
Garnet, scoring her third tally of
the game with 2:01 left in the second overtime period.
Emily
Evans 'll scored five in the winning effort.
With a spring break and team
trip so early in the season, the
team had an opportunity to bond
and get comfortable with each
other earlier than players are
often able to do so on other
teams.
Sports teams in both the fall
and winter have their breaks
almost mid-way through their

seasons.

Lacrosse, on the other hand,
takes a trip after having played

March 19, 2009

only one game due to the timing
of spring break, which falls early
in the spring sports season. "It
was different than soccer,"
Mutryn said. "I got way closer to
the freshmen than I was
[before]," added the two-sport
athlete.

"We cooked dinner for each
other and had assigned vans.
There was a lot of driving, so we
got to know [the girls in] our van
pretty well," Vachal said.
The early comfort paid off for
the Garnet first-years. Goals
posted by Mutryn, Annalise
Mowy 'l2 and Maddie Williams
'l2, and assists by Williams and
Phoebe Hansen 'l2 have ignited
optimism throughout the Garnet
roster.
"We are more ready for our
conference schedule than we
were last season," said Kelly.
"It's a big confidence booster
that we've started out winning."
"It's cool to be a freshman and
be able to start," said Mutryn of
her early success. "Coach bases
starters on ability and how you
will be able to contribute. As
freshman, you don't expect to
play that much, but a lot of us
are."

The Garnet will need all of
the contributions they can
muster for a tough stretch of
games
against
Centennial
Conference opponents throughout the rest of the season. The
latest Intercollegiate Women's
College Lacrosse Association
poll ranks conference opponents
Franklin & Marshall at #3 and
Gettysburg at #4 nationally,
while Dickinson is also listed
among the teams receiving votes
for a ranking, but Swarthmore
remains optimistic and light-

hearted.

Leading scorer Vachal joked,
"That's how we roll; we have
momentum like a lacrosse ball
rolling down a hill." She continued, "We want to continue that
momentum. The ball rolls down
the hill and eventually into a
goal."

Ultimately, that goal could be

a Centennial Conference playoff
birth for the Garnet, which
would be the first since 2006.
