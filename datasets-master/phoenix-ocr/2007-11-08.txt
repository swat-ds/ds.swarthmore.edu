Bloom and Welsh discuss college finances
BY lAN YARETT
iyarettl@swarthmore.edu
On Tuesday night, Student Council hosted a discussion of the college's financial

structure with President Al Bloom and Vice

President for Finances and Treasurer
Bloom and Welsh
Suzanne Welsh.
explained various elements of college
finances to a large audience in Science
Center 101
Bloom started the discussion with a brief
presentation, followed by another presentation by Welsh. Afterward, the floor was
opened to questions from the audience, with
Student Council President Peter Gardner
'OB and Financial Policy Representative
Sarah Roberts 'OB asking the questions that
were sent to Student Council beforehand.
Bloom opened the discussion, describing it as a "wonderful opportunity" and then
asking how it is possible that he has to
spend 50 percent of his time fundraising, as
president of a college with a SL49 billion
endowment and a $45,000 tuition. After his
introduction, he went on to describe
Swarthmore's three major revenue sources:
tuition, the endowment, which has been
built by gifts over the years, and the annual
fund, which consists of non-endowed funds
given directly to the college.

While the tuition funds are used for
expenses such as room and board, financial
aid and faculty, the endowment and gifts are
used to fund other necessities, such as staff
salaries, equipment, programs, the library,

legal fees and the health center.
Bloom described the budget as extremely
tight when it comes to funding new things,
with no more than $lOO,OOO of leeway each

year. The total cost of each student's education per year is $78,427, with only about
$30,000 brought in annually per student on
average. "The college has been and will

continually be dependent on philanthropy,"
Bloom said.

Welsh described the timeline of the budget, explaining that most elements of the
budget stay relatively constant from year to
year. In October, the rolling 5-year budget
projection is updated, and then in
December, departments submit their
requested budgets. The budget is finally
approved at the February meeting of the
Board of Managers. Both Welsh and Bloom
emphasized that capital campaigns are really the only way to fund major new things.
Welsh also explained that there is a 4.25
percent use of the endowment every year,
but that it is limited by a number of factors.
Since much of the endowment is invested in
stocks, which can increase or decrease in
value, the budget can't be based on how well
the budget does in a given year. Welsh said
that the college works to avoid being put in

a position where budget cuts could be necessary.

According to Welsh, transparency in
terms of the endowment investment is limited because the college hires firms to handle the investment of various portions of the
endowment, and that these firms tend to
require confidentiality to maintain their
competitive edge. Hiring firms like this,
Welsh said, is essential to maintaining the
highest possible return on the endowment.
When asked if students would be able to
see a detailed budget for a department if
they had an idea they thought should be
added, Bloom explained that the best course

of action would be to go to the appropriate
department, the budget committee or the
planning committee. Bloom explained that
college will not provide information on the
specific budgets of departments, for example, because there is worry that people looking at the figures would not have the knowledge to fully comprehend them, and could
misinterpret their significance. The details
could potentially be used as "political
weapons," or used in "insidious comparisons."

"We thought that students
didn't have a solid sense
of how the endowment is
spent."
Sam Asarnow 'OB
Issues surrounding financial aid were
also discussed, especially the potential for
eliminating the loan component of aid, as

At
University has done.
Swarthmore, where 50 percent of students
are on financial said, that change would
cost $5O million in endowment. Bloom
emphasized that this is something that has
both benefits and costs and has to be evaluPrinceton

ated fully.

Marc Engel 'O9 said that he attended the
event wearing his 'activist hat," and was
generally pleased with the discussion.
"I thought it was good for the activist
community to show that we are sensitive to
these issues, but we still want what we

want," he said.
However, Engel was concerned that the
event was set up to "explain why they can't
do what we want them to do," suggesting
that it would have been better to approach
the discussion in terms of working with the
budget as is or looking at how it could be
tweaked to accomplish the initiatives campus activists are pushing for.
Dean of Students Jim Larimore,
who attended Tuesday's discussion, said
that "people were impressed by the turnout,
and the variety of questions students
asked." Larimore also emphasized the

to the college for summer internships as an
example.According to Student Council Vice
President Sam Asarnow 'OB, the initiative to
bring about a discussion on the college's
financial structure began last spring, spearheaded primarily by former Student
Council members Joella Fink 'O7 and
Eleanor Joseph 'O7. "We thought that students didn't have a solid sense of how the
endowment is spent," he said.
Gardner said that he thought the discussion was successful and well attended. "I
thought that there was a gap in information

between what the administration knows
and does and what the students know,
though I don't think this is deliberate on
anyone's part," he said. "[The discussion]
put in people's minds a different side of the
not that it wasn't there before

but not vocally expressed."

Worth Health Center envisions renovations and additions
BY KAITLIN KYI
kkyil@swarthmore. edu
The familiar confines of Worth Health Center may be facing a makeover, as administrators and faculty begin
discussing possible renovations for the health care
facility. Built in 1965 by the same architect who designed
McCabe and Sharpies, the actual building itselfhas seen its
fair share of medical advances, and new director
Beth Kotarski is hopeful that the building might reach a
level where it could be approved by the Accreditation
Association for Ambulatory Health Care, though this is a

far-off goal.

"I really believe in the accreditation process in elevating
the standards of the center, and accreditation is about elevating the process of college health to the highest level,"
Kotarski said. "It's a huge process. It takes a long time, but
we've already started on the path." Kotarski, who worked at
Haverford College's accredited health center, envisions
achieving accreditation standards in the areas of the center's pharmacy and laboratory.
The actual building itself may face some changes, though
specific logistics are still to be determined. "We need better
flow of the structure," Kotarski said. "I would like to see an
architect come in and give us their expert opinion on how to
make the flow of care more efficient and more modernized."
While showing one of the examination rooms, Kotarski
expressed hopes to have a new, more modernized doctor's
exam table, but noted that the room might not accommodate

a larger exam table.
Currently, talks are only in the preliminary stages. On
Sept. 24, a meeting opened discussion for renovations with
Kotarski, Associate Vice President of Facilities and Services
Stu Hain, former Worth director Linda Echols, Director of
Planning and Construction Janet Semler, Director of
Counseling and Psychological Services David Ramirez and
Dean of Students Jim Larimore. Larimore has spearheaded
the beginning discussion of possible renovations, according
to both Kotarski and Hain.
Larimore has been interested in the health center since
he arrived at the college over a year ago. "When I first got
here, I first looked at senior satisfaction on a variety of student services. The health center had a very high satisfaction
rate," Larimore said.

THE

PHOENIX

Larimore wanted to continue that standard of satisfaction in years to come. "If we're doing well at something,
there's still room for improvement," Larimore said.
According to Haiti, a plan for funding an architect to
inspect the current facilities is in place. "There will be a line
in the budget that will allow us to hire an architect to help

us understand problems and develop solutions for [the
health center]," Hain said. The line would be part of the capital budget, which is discussed by the Board of Manager's
Property Committee in their December meeting, and the line
would not officially be approved until the Board's February
meeting, according to Hain.
Hain emphasized that any major physical changes would
not be completed in the near future. "There are many more
questions now than there are answers," Hain said.
"There's a several-year long and multi-staged process
that we're just at the front end of," Larimore said. "We're
trying to do the best possible job for when [the renovations
go] forward."
In the interim between any potential renovations and the
health center's current status, Hain said that Facilities
would try to support the health center by providing equipment Kotarski deems necessary. "We'll try to support them
with new equipment as she decides she needs it... We'll certainly provide what she needs to run the operation the way
she needs it." Currently, the health center has received new
equipment including a state-of-the-art opthalmoscope and a
new computer. Kotarski believes that a computerized Worth
Health Center would be a great development.
"We are getting more computers here. We've added one
computer to our cycle that puts us up to a cycle of four computers in health services, and two of them that are able to be
accessed by the nurses up front," Kotarski said. In addition
to these new developments in technology, Worth may be
receiving new cabinets, according to Hain.
According to Larimore, a new medical exam table has
arrived at the health center in its largest triage room, inciting the equivalent feeling of a "new car" for the health center staff. "They feel really proud of it. The nurses and doctors
put so much of themselves [in their work], and their sense of
pride in their work environment gets a boost," Larimore
said.
Kotarski also cited the lack of central air conditioning as
another renovation possibility for the center. "We need to

update, and I don't think it's any secret to anyone in the comthat [Worth] is due for major modernization,"

munity

Kotarski said.

Counseling and Psychological Services, which adjoins
the health center in a separate wing, will also be undergoing
changes should a plan for renovations be approved in the

future. The wing that CAPS uses for offices originally consisted of rooms for patients, but was converted into offices
for CAPS.
In an e-mail, Director of CAPS David Ramirez said,
"Both WHC and CAPS need more space; in our case
we need at least two additional consultation rooms and a
conference room (which we could conceivably share with
WHC)."
Ramirez also said the renovations could have the "ability
to increase staffing therefore offering a higher service level
to students; increased ability for assessment for ADD and
Learning Disabilities; [and the] ability to host student
groups needing space for mental health oriented
groups/meetings."
According to Associate Dean of Student Life Myrt
Westphal, CAPS may be making intermediate changes to its
wing of the building in the form of making a "welcoming,
legitimate entrance."
"The one teeny-tiny renovation that I've heard that was
proposed and is likely to be done is to have a cover over the
back entrance and a sign that says CAPS, because some people don't want to come into the main building, so it doesn't
feel like you are sneaking into the back," Westphal said.
Currently, students using CAPS have to enter through the
WHC entrance and then cross over into the back where
CAPS is located.
Westphal uses WHC regularly, where she gets massages,
and has noticed where renovations could make a difference.
"The hallway's a little tired, and the bathroom is definitely
looking old," Westphal said.
These problems arise from the age of the building, which
is now over forty years old. "The exam rooms might have
been nice in the sixties, but they aren't what we need now,"
Hain said. "The question is: can we add onto the building
and how?"
Larimore encourages students who wish to bring forth
any ideas for future changes to WHC and CAPS to be in
touch with directors Kotarski and Ramirez.

Philly shuttle expansion plan anticipates more flexibility

The expansion could mean the shuttle will
visit more destinations or run more fre-

BY RAMYA GOPAL

rgopall@swarthmore. edu

Student Council members are working
with engineering students Sophia Pan 'O9
and Tina Yeung 'O9 to revamp the Philly
Shuttle service, which provides free transportation to Philadelphia on weekends.
Every Friday and Saturday evening, a
Swarthmore van rolls up to Parrish circle to
pick up students and drive them into
Philadelphia for free. Swarthmore students
who use the service must reserve seats
online in advance. The shuttle, the equivalent of a free chauffeur service, makes stops
at Chinatown, South Street and the Ritz at
the Bourse from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.
The Philly Shuttle program was initiated
by Student Council in 2002 as an experiment
to provide another mode of transportation
to Philly for students besides the SEPTA
train.

Ryan Budish 'O4 coordinated the project,
first as Student Council Campus Life
Representative and later as Co-President.
"We wanted to give people the opportunity
to be able to enjoy the resource of Philly
and make it affordable to everyone," he said.
"We tried it, and it was pretty successful.
I'm glad to hear that it is still successful."
...

Students identified a need for more
affordable transportation to Philly, but
there had not been successful alternatives
until the inception of the Philly shuttle. The
students worked with President Al Bloom
and Head of Public Safety Owen Redgrave to
initiate the Philly shuttle project.
The project was begun over the course of
a year and a half. "Everything was kind of
moving in an incremental way," Budish
said. The sign-up process evolved from
paper
to
the current Information
Technology Services Web site, and funding
for the program moved from the President's
discretionary fund to part ofPublic Safety's
budget. However, no additional changes
were made to the program once implemented, according to Redgrave. "We tried to
make it simple, and there is certainly nothing stopping people from enhancing it in
any way," Budish said.
The present push to expand the program

came from feedback from current students.
As a result of suggestions to Student
Council, members discovered that "students
were asking for an increased Philly shuttle
program," said President Peter Gardner 'OB.

quently. The scope of the project will be
developed based on the research of two engineering students.
Serendipity brought Pan and Yeung
together with Student Council members to
revamp the Philly Shuttle program. Pan was
searching for an idea for her final project for
her engineering course Operations
Research. Students in the course study how
to mathematically optimize complex systems such as business and government operations. As a final project, students are
required to apply their modeling techniques
to analyze a real-world problem through a
case study. During the week when her professor introduced the assignment, Pan used
the Philly Shuttle to visit Chinatown. "[The
shuttle driver] mentioned how long he had
been driving, and I realized transportation
is the perfect way to apply it," Pan said. "It
was a combination of good timing and my

Student Council discovered thatPan and
Yeung were trying to address the problem
and decided to join forces. "We want to help
her with her project, because it's in the
entire studentbody's interest," said Campus
Life Representative Alyssa Work 'OB.
Pan's research will only be the beginning
of the process. "We still don'tknow the timeline on this," said Vice President Samuel
Asarnow 'OB.
Through the process of their research,
the Pan and Yeung hope "to lay out a model
that could be used, modifying the existing
schedule and route, working with the framework and resources," Pan said. "We want to
optimize what we have based on the limitations."
Currently, the students are preparing to
collect data about the shuttle's usage among
students. Pan said that they were writing a
survey that will be distributed by Student
Council. By expanding the program, the
researchers are introducing a slew of new
variables that seem to limit them. One of
their struggles is finding additional drivers

with Philadelphia is an important element
of the Philly Shuttle program. "We were
lucky that we found a terrific driver right
away," Budish said.
Unfortunately, "Bill is an exception,"
Redgrave said. "Recruiting [a new driver]
might not be as smooth."
Wilson, too, is skeptical of the possibility
of finding another driver. "Friday night and
Saturday night is tough for the everyday
person," he said. "If they were offering fulltime jobs at it, it would be a different thing.
There's more to it than what people think
because I am continuously driving."
The opportunity offers few incentives
because it is a part-time job running only 30
weeks a year with 'toff the wall hours,"
Wilson said. Pan recognizes the difficulties
in trying to replicate the shuttle's success in
a model of a larger program. "With only one
driver, it's a lot to ask of him [to expand the
program.] We need to find a way to simplify
the route to train someone else. We're still

Search for new ITS director continues with Barton
BY ROSA KIM
rkiml@swarthmore.edu

The Information Technology Services Director Search
Committee is currently deliberating as to who will replace
Judy Downing as the new Information Technology Services
director. According to Thomas Stephenson, chemistry professor and committee chair, the committee received over 100
applications when it began its search last April.
Since then, the committee has narrowed down the applicant pool to two finalists Gayle Barton, director ofinstructional technology at Williams College and Eric Behrens '92
current associate director and humanities coordinator here
at the college. Over the past two weeks, the committee has
hosted open discussions with the finalists to gain the student
body's input in making a recommendation to Provost
Constance Hain Hungerford, who will make the final decision. Members of the campus community met with Behrens
last week, coverage of which can be found in the 11/1/ issue
of The Phoenix. This week, discussion forums were held
with Barton.
Barton, who has a BA in economics from Bryn Mawr
College and a MA in Education from St. Lawrence
University, revealed her view of technology's function in
institutions of higher learning in this week's open discussions.

She said that in addition to its indispensable role in classrooms and administration offices, technology is also a vital
communication tool both between members of the campus
community and between the college and the world at large.
Barton also shared with the audience personal information
including her upbringing, the various career decisions that
led to her current position at Williams and her vision of how
the introduction of new technologies can impact students'
and administrators' lives on campus.
Barton asked audience members to suggest one thing
they would like ITS to provide, and then provided feedback
on the feasibility of each suggestion. Barton said she envisions the ITS director as a communicator who is in the position to advocate for effective use of technology on campus,
lead policy issues and prioritize budgeting in introducing
new and improving existing technology on campus.
Stephenson said that the ITS director holds a very important position on campus. "It certainly affects the tone of the
relationship between ITS and the rest of the community," he
said.
Eric Christiansen 'OB, a student member on the search
committee, said, "The director, I think, formally doesn't have
a huge amount of legislative power. But the director implements lots of policies and can certainly have an influence."
Stephenson said while ITS is not as an essential part of
the college's academic life as the quality of the faculty and

November 8 2007
f

the breadth of the curriculum, it plays a critical role in the
quality of the educational experience. "Certainly just in
terms of day to day functioning; e-mail, providing software, and things like that, it's absolutely essential,"
Stephenson said. "Blackboard is probably an area where
ITS has the greatest impact on the day to day functioning
of the academic program." Stephenson added that ITS also
provides other classroom technology, such as projection
systems.

Christiansen said that other services students use

everyday, such as wireless networking, printers and the
help desk, are all provided by ITS. "We depend on IT[S] for
lots of things [we] do here," Christiansen said.
Stephenson said that the search committee looked for
applicants with an extensive experience with technology
in higher education, an open management style and good
communication skills, among other qualities. Stephenson
said that both Barton and Behrens have the complimentary skills and backgrounds that make them suitable candidates. "I'd say we're very lucky to have two really high
qualified finalists that know this kind of environment very
well," Stephenson said.
"I think they're both strong candidates. I'd be happy if
either one got the job," Christiansen said.
According to Stephenson, the new ITS director will
assume the position early next semester.

Students lobby on climate at Power Shift 2007

ywangl@swarthmore.edu

BY

This past weekend, 22 Swarthmore students joined
nearly 6,000 college and high school students from around
the world at the Power Shift 2007 Conference in College
Park, Maryland. According to Power Shift's Web site, the
conference was "the first ever national youth climate summit, involving thousands of youth from all over the nation,
from every walk of life, and from every racial, ethnic,
income, ideological and religious group."
Backed financially by a Swarthmore Foundation Grant,

funds from the Dean's Office and additional monies from
two of the attendees, the Swarthmore contingent participated in panels, workshops and a direct action protest
against Citibank. They concluded their trip, which lasted
from Friday, Nov. 2 to Monday, Nov. 5, with lobbying on
Capitol Hill.
Marc Engel 'O9 spearheaded efforts to take a
Swarthmore contingent to the conference. He was inspired
in part by Power Shift's size and scope. "I feel that the 2007
Power Shift Conference [was] basically the apex of the
youth climate movement. It's like the 1968 democratic convention, except not partisan. This was historic over 5,500
students from all over the country and world came to lay
out a vision and solution for the climate crisis," Engel said.
Engel also stressed Power Shift's ability to incite
activism as a significant motivator. "These types of inspiring, motivating and informing events always create new
activists. I got my start as an activist at an event similar to
-

this, and I know that if even one of the students that came
had a life changing experience then it would be worth it,"
he said.
While the trip was not officially sponsored by any
organization on campus, members of Earthlust, Students
for a Democratic Society, Swarthmore Progressive Action
Committee and Good Food, among others, attended the
conference. The first few days of the conference consisted
of panels and workshops on topics ranging from voting
issues to climate neutrality. Additionally, student attendees and panelists networked to share their experiences
and resources. On Monday, attendees of Power Shift lobbied Congress on climate legislation issues. According to
Engel, Swarthmore students lobbied local politicians Bob
Casey, Joe Sestak and Arlen Specter.
In addition to these activities, two Swarthmore students, Greta Pittenger 10 and Camille Rogine 'll, also participated in a direct action initiative organized by the
Rainforest Action Network against Citibank. Protesting
the company's investment in coal, the direct action led to
the eventual shutdown of the bank for the day. According
to RAN's Web site http://www.ran.org, nearly 300 people
participated in the protest, which involved marching in
front of the D.C. branch of Citibank, performing a "coughin/die-in" and dumping coal on the doorstep of the bank.
The protest was non-violent and resulted in no arrests.
The Swarthmore contingent left the conference feeling
strongly affected by the weekends' events. "For me, it was
exciting to see students like me from around the U.S. and
the world converging on one place who care passionately

about this issue. I guess you could call me a realist or a
cynic, and I don't usually get optimistic about things, but
this conference was a new hope, in a way, that something
will hopefully happen in Congress
The conference was a
way for future leaders to get together and really drive their
message to Congress," attendent Blaine O'Neill 11 said.
J.J. England 'O9 cited Power Shift's unique viewpoint
on climate issues to explain why he enjoyed the conference. "Honestly, the thing that I was most satisfied with is
that people generally view global warming as just an environmental issue, and when it comes down to it, it is first
and foremost a social justice issue. Global warming will
have a disproportionate impact on traditionally oppressed
groups such as people of color and low income communiI feel that in order to tackle the issue of global
ties
warming, you really have to understand that first,"
...

...

England said.
Engel echoed England's sentiments and added that the
conference also demonstrated the necessity for bold and
confident action. "The conference showed us the importance for and strength of equality and justice in this movement. If we are going to achieve the revolution as we talk
about it, the just transformation has to go with it," Engel

said.
"Schools all over this country are taking huge steps.
[They are] greening their fleets and purchasing 100 percent
renewable energy. I saw a school that brought all its students on a bus powered by veggie oil. I realized the time is
now, and we need bold and comprehensive action," Engel
said.

New Orleans Week fosters campus awareness and involvement
BY APOLLINE BERTY
abertyl@swarthmore.edu
The newly formed group New Orleans
Louisiana
rising,
also known as
NOLArize, will be hosting a New Orleans
Week on campus focused on encouraging
students to get involved in various issues
and connect with the New Orleans community. New Orleans Week will last from
Sunday Nov. 11 to Nov. 17.

NOLArize was recently founded by students who had been involved with various
Katrina Relief groups on campus in the
past.

"In the past, efforts from Swarthmore
have been on the more [physical] rebuilding of the city. NOLArize is all about raising awareness about the social, racial, economic conditions in New Orleans that the
storm obviously exposed, as well as highlighting the vibrant culture and community of New Orleans, of this honestly one of
kind city, and getting other people to fall in
love [with it]," said Mara Phelan 'lO, a
member of the NOLArize Steering
Committee. The group is thus centered
around several elements, one consisting of
rebuilding the city and addressing problems and issues brought to awareness by
the hurricane, and another concerned
with the appreciation of the city's community and culture.
"Two pieces [emerge]: there's the issues
side and the community and culture.
That's what our mission's about, those two
separate parts," Phelan said.
The group is not as much focusing on

Katrina Relief as on the culture of New
Orleans. "We're not relieving people from
Hurricane Katrina anymore, we're just
helping New Orleans at this point because
we love it," said Nabta Idries 10, another
member of the Steering Committee.
The week will begin with King Cakes
and music from New Orleans, followed by
a screening of the documentary "When the
Levees Broke." There will be another
screening later that week on the Indian
Mardi Gras tradition, "All on a Mardi Gras
Day," and a Sharpies takeover. NOLArize
has also invited two speakers from New

THE PHOENIX

Orleans whom Marissa Davis 'OB met during the summer as she interviewed them
for her thesis and worked on opening the
first Cut-Off Youth Library in New
Orleans.
One of the speakers, Carol Bebelle, is
the leader of the Ashe Cultural Arts Center
and had worked with Davis at a summer
camp prior to the interviews. "Every time
I've spoken with her there's just this hope
that comes out of what she speaks of, but at
the same time I think she tries to be realistic of the situation in New Orleans and
I'm hoping that that is what she'll be able
to share," Davis said. The other speaker is
the Mardi Gras Indian Queen Cherise
Harrison-Nelson, founder of the Mardi
Gras Indian Hall of Fame.
Davis stressed that most of the week
would focus on these speakers as only
rarely would it be that people from the
Swarthmore community would be able to
benefit from the presence of speakers from
New Orleans directly on campus. "My
biggest wish is that people will be in attendance at these events, particularly for the
speakers because for too long the media
has portrayed this image of [people] who
have done a lot more than what they would
be credited for, and to have those voices
from those communities actually here on
the campus and to have the Swarthmore
community have access to these people
I think that is exactly what NOLArize is
about and what we're trying to do," Davis

said.
"This is a new group, a lot of people
don't know what we're all about. So, it's
basically introducing ourselves and our
greater mission and also pressing help
from the community to see how they can
work with us in accomplishing what we're
trying to do, which is rebuilding New
Orleans, Louisiana, not just physically but
emotionally," explained John Boucard 'lO,
yet another member of the Steering
Committee.
Phelan also emphasized the importance
of New Orleans as a pillar of American
Culture. "We understand that we are not
experts on New Orleans culture and particularly New Orleans black culture. We

are neither the greatest politicians [nor]
the movers and shakers of this community
but we are friends and we are vehicles for
the voice of the people to be heard," Davis

experience, see how successful that program is we can expand," Boucard said.
NOLArize is also fundraising to provide
the Cut-off Youth Library with computers.
There will be another trip to New
Orleans at some point during the school
year to rebuild marshes, continue working
with the Cut-Off community center and

said.

Boucard explained that after New
Orleans week, NOLArize will focus on
working directly with youths by possibly
starting a pen pal program and also bringthirty students to
ing
twenty to
Swarthmore College to "[expose] them to

build more libraries.
"Please, people, show up," Davis said. "I
think it'll be very powerful when people
from New Orleans, who have been almost
forgotten, will see that there are people
still invested and care about continuing
the efforts to rebuild their city and to
understand that we can build a partner-

things that they're not seeing in New

Orleans."
"Last year we worked with a community center in the cutoff region of New
Orleans, Algiers, and our main focus right
now is those kids and once we have more

ship."

Library revamped at Chester school
We also organized books and files for

BY MATT BLEIMAN

mbleimal@swarthmore.edu

Until this summer, Chester's Stetser
Elementary School had stacks of books
but no library to house them. Swarthmore
chemistry lecturer Ginger Indivero has
begun work to transform an empty room
of the school into a new library for the
children.
Indivero became interested in the work
after reading an article in The Phoenix
last year that mentioned Stetser's library
dilemma, namely that the library had not
been in use for two years. "That caught
my attention, so I decided to see if I could
do anything," Indivero said.
Once the principal of Stetser granted
permission to her begin fixing the library,
Indivero and a team of junior high and
high school volunteers from her church's
youth group worked to clean up the former library, which resided in a trailer.
"The trailer basically became a dumping
ground," Indivero said.
The volunteers spent time over the
summer to fix and clean the trailer. One of
the summer volunteers was chemistry lecturer Maria Newport. "I was only able to
go a handful of times over the summer to
help get the library organized," Newport
said. "Basically, we went through the
books, pulling ones that were useful for
the kids at the elementary school level.

Swarthmore students to go down there for
an hour to help out," Indivero said. Now
that teachers are beginning to sign up to
bring their students down to the library
for projects, volunteers are needed to help
the children research and find books.
"None of us are library professionals,
but they have books and my goal is to get
books into the kids' hands," Indivero said.
Her goal, as the program expands, is to
have more volunteers so teachers at
Stetser will bring their students there
more often.
Indivero hopes that eventually the
library will be staffed by volunteers working several hour shifts who can interface
with the teachers to set up new projects.
Assistant professor of chemistry Liliya
Yatsunyk is one of the volunteers. She has
volunteered twice so far, and both times
had a different class visit

one day and second graders the next.
Yatsunyk helped the children find books
and check them out, spending the rest of

Now that the library has been established, Indivero has been searching for
volunteers to staff it. She has recruited
some of her friends to volunteer at the
library,
including
several
other
Swarthmore professors, with the hopes
that Swarthmore students will also volunteer. "What I would love to do is to get

tasks.
"The fifth graders didn't seem to know
what to do in the library," Yatsunyk said.
When she came back the second time, two
of the fifth graders came up to her and
began explaining their books to her.
While only a few of the fifth graders
seemed enthusiastic about the library,
Yatsunyk was pleased that some were

teachers that were not accessible for
them." Newport plans to volunteer for an
hour a week once the program gets going.
Indivero was able to continue the project by making use of the open space in a
room that had computers along the walls
but was empty in the center. The volunteers spent the next six weeks moving
everything to the computer room, and
decorating it with bulletin boards and
signs to make the room more welcoming.

The goal is that the combination of

A few of the parents from the community have already volunteered for the

project. Indivero's wish is that eventually

more involved so the program will be
turned over to them. If all goes according
to plan, the program will continue
through the school year.

ARMY STRONG.

Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for
the Committee on Education and Labor
from Miller's office, said this is one of
many options that will be explored.
"One of Chairman Miller's key goals
is to address rising college prices, which
could include working with colleges to
rein in increases in tuition and other
costs. He also believes more information
about college pricing and factors driving
increases must be made available to students and their families," Racusen said.
She said the committee is hoping to
move forward as soon as possible and
expects that legislation will be introduced within the month.
According to a report released by the
College Board, student fees have
increased by 31 percent nationally at
four-year public universities over the
last five years.
UC spokesman Ricardo Vasquez said
a decline in state financial support for

November 8, 2007

the University of California has had significant impact on the increases in student fees.
UC student fees for 2007-2008 school
year increased by 7 percent, along with
an additional temporary surcharge of
$6O per student.
He added that in 1970, around 7 percent of the state General Fund was
appropriated for the University of
California. Today, this figure has
dropped below 3 percent.
According to Vasquez, the drop in
state funding is larger than it has ever
been. "If the state was currently funding
as it did in 1990, then it would contribute
an additional $2,470 per a student,"
Vasquez said.
The proposed bill would also include
provisions that would hold colleges
accountable for rising costs of higher
education.
Kim Southard, legislative assistant to
Rep. Ric Keller, R-Fla, said the provisions that may be taken to ensure that
colleges take some responsibility for fee
increases are unknown at this time.
Southard said Keller is wary of the
real causes of rising education costs and
is opposed to punishing states unnecessarily. She said the provisions would
depend on what the infractions are that
would trigger penalizations as well as
how steep the punishments are.
She added that the committee will
work to come up with a bipartisan bill as
it has been doing in the past.
Based on the Nov. 1 hearing.
Southard said she expects that most
opposition to the bill will depend on why
the fees are increasing.
Southard added that staff salary
increases may be a point of contention
in deliberations over the bill, since it
may effect student fee increases.

Army and Navy cadets verbally spar in Peaslee-hosted event
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ELENA CHOPYAK
echopyal@swarthmore.edu
Last week the college's Amos J. Peaslee Debate society hosted a debate between Army and Navy cadets on the

topic of the use of private security contractors in warfare. Highlighting the presence of "men in uniform" in
advertising the debate, the Peaslee event attracted a full
room of Swarthmore students.
The debate was judged by four Swarthmore Peaslee
debaters, Jeeyoung Oh 'OB, Trude Raizen 'OB, Arley Gease
'lO and Nate Erskine 'lO. Although the debate concerned
private security contractors in general terms, the
debaters framed their arguments around the Blackwater
contractors in Iraq.

The Government side, represented by the Navy,
argued against the presence of private security contractors on the basis of their unscrupulous tactics, monetary
motivations and undermining of the Iraqi government.
The Army, representing the Opposition, presented
two main points, that the private security contractors do
the dirty work so that the Army is free to complete other
important tasks, and that these private contractors help
rather than hinder the Iraqi government. Army cadet
Thomas Perkins 'lO argued that private security contractors help save the United States' image abroad by allowing the army to "win the hearts and minds," while the
private contractors conduct police actions. Perkins also
noted that the contractors are higher service veterans,
and not "wild cowboys, shooting people up."
The Army acknowledged that private security companies, like Blackwater, have made mistakes and destroyed
themselves due to a lack of accountability . However, the

THIS

Opposition maintained the stance that private contractors allow the military to carry out important missions.
The Army argued that Blackwater had been beneficial
for the Iraqi government's image in that its removal at
the bequest of the Iraqi government empowered the governing body.

"The Army's mission is not just to
put warheads on foreheads."
Andy Christopher 'O9
Navy cadet
The Navy argued that private security companies run
counter to the ideals of the U.S. and that the lack of distinction between contractors and military personnel
jeopardizes the accountability of the military and its
actions. Additionally, the army, unlike the private contractors, has a vested interest in winning the war and in
returning home.
"The Army's mission is not just to put warheads on
foreheads," Navy cadet Andy Christopher 'O9 said to
drive home his point that private security contractors
are not helping the situation in Iraq and are not facilitating the winning of hearts and minds abroad.
Christopher also argued that contractors like
Blackwater hurt, rather than help, the Iraqi government
because the government loses sovereignty when it cannot control the contractors.

According to the cadets, theracial diversity within West

"At West Point, there is only one color, and that is grey,"
a cadet chaperone and professor said. When asked if hazing occurs, Army cadet Brian Bird responded,
"Absolutely not. Today, we make it stressful for the freshmen, but we don't make them do anything crazy."
Each cadet who spoke extolled the college's hospitality and the Sharpies meal they had eaten just prior to the
debate, comparing the Caribbean bar meal to the food in
their mess hall. "It's a beautiful area. I like the people
I've met so far," army cadet Perkins said of Swarthmore.

Citizens pledge to take back Philly streets
'lO,OOO Men in Philly' movement encourages hope in afflicted community
BY SARAH PETERSON

spetersl@swarthmore.edu

"Enough is enough." "It's a new day."
These and other phrases of renewed determination and hope have recently been
heard around Philadelphia, as the community responds to escalating rates of homicide and violent crime.

"This is a call for action for
all of us
nobody else [is]
going to magically come
into this community and
get it done."
Abdur-Rahim Islam
...

In the past several weeks, an alliance of
community leaders
including clergy,
local officials, media moguls and prominent businessmen
has come together to
organize

the

concerned

citizens

of

Philadelphia in an effort to "take back the
streets" and take personal responsibility
for fostering change in the areas of the city
that are most affected by the violence. This
grassroots effort falls largely under the
heading of the highly-publicized "10,000
Men In Philly" movement, which plans to
organize men into volunteer patrol groups
that will move around neighborhoods as a
visible peacekeeping presence meant to
deter violence and set an example for others in Philadelphia.

A History of Violence

According to an FBI report released at
the beginning of the summer, Philadelphia
had the highest murder rate of the nation's

largest cities in 2006. There were 406 murders last year, and as of November X 2007
there have been 321 homicides in 2007
putting the city on track to once again near
the 400 count. The increase in homicide
from 2005 was 7.7 percent in Philadelphia,
higher than the national average of 6.9 percent. Homicide, it appears, is not only
prevalent, but also on the rise. While this is
not breaking news, it is an ongoing emergency in Philadelphia and impacts the
lives of citizens every day if not directly,
then through the prevailing trends of population loss and a decline in the overall
quality of life. According to Philadelphia
Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson, 94
percent of those being killed and 94 percent
of those doing the killing are high school
dropouts. 87 percent of the victims had
criminal records, as do 84 percent of those
committing the murders.
Among the 321 killed this year, 265 were

black. Of those, 243 were black males, and
114 were black males under the age of 25.
Almost all homicides were carried out with
firearms. "Since January 1998, we have
lost 2,885 black men to murder," Johnson
said. Leaders have spoken about the crisis
as having a particular impact on the city's
African-American population, and consistently referred to the movement as specifically being an opportunity for black men to
"be the change that they seek."
Envisioning the Movement

It was entertainment executive Charlie
Mack who initially conceived the vision of
the 10,000 men movement over a year ago.

John Street
Philadelphia Mayor
The resulting committee of leaders
included such prominent figures as
Commissioner Johnson and Philadelphia
Mayor John Street, as well as religious
leaders, radio personalities, scholars and
community activists. Street, who earlier in
his term as mayor had implemented a
Safer Streets initiative towards preventing
violent crime, lauded the grassroots quality of the 10,000 Men movement during a
press conference.
"All too often people, not just men,
decide that change needs to happen: We
need to have a better city, we need to have
stronger communities, there needs to be
more recreation, there needs to be more
mentoring, there needs to be more activities—and then when it comes time to get
somebody to do it, they're looking for somebody else," Street said. "Well in this partic-

'The change that I want has to begin
with me.'" The movement was promoted
with flyers, radio announcements and an
official Web site where men could register
to participate. On Oct. 21, a rally and infor-

November 8, 2007

mational event was organized at Temple
University's Liacouras Center. Nearly
10,000 men arrived for the event alone,
where they were able to register in person
and also meet with various community
groups, services and non-profits that were
co-sponsoring the event.
The rally itself consisted of inspirational speeches, performances and an
overview of where the movement would go
from that day forward.
"Not Reinventing the Wheel"
The movement's leaders directly cite
their influences
Mack even pointed to
Gamble as the source of his inspiration
and acknowledged in the press conference
and the general assembly the movements
that had come before.
Particular mention was made of the
Million Man March in 1995, a large march
on Washington addressing issues of political power, education, spiritual values
and unity within the black community.
Moreover, there are a number of institutions and organizations already in place

in Philadelphia working to address the

issue of violence, as well as the other
problems closely related to violent crime.
Mothers in Charge, Men United for a
Better Philadelphia, Big Brothers Big
Sisters and Blueprint for a Safer
Philadelphia are just a few.
While emphasis has been placed on the
male volunteers' patrolling the streets
under the guidance of Operation Town
Watch, the movement is more broadly
framed as being about just getting more
involved.
"We are not today reinventing the
wheel," one of the organizers said. "We

are asking for our men to volunteer to
existing things that are happening in our
community."

More than being about patrolling the
streets, the movement is about personal
responsibility and refraining the community itself.

Being on the streets as potential witnesses will hopefully cut down the amount of
crime that happens in the public view
a
shift in values from the "stop snitching"
mentality that has previously permeated
violent neighborhoods and allowed crime to
carry on unfettered.
Volunteers on patrol will also talk to people in the neighborhood
specifically to
spread the word about the movement, get to
know the community, and be positive role
models for young males in their neighborhood. There is a symbolic purpose in the
patrols, and that is the articulation that people do care about their neighbors and their
city. This also accounts for the gendered
aspect of the 10,000 Men movement, the fact
being that young men are largely the ones
committing these crimes. Volunteers and
organizers did, however acknowledge the
role of women
both in organizing the
movement, and in having their own responsibilities in stopping violence through their
family and community roles. The consensus
was that everyone has a way of getting
involved and a responsibility to do so.

ways for men to get involved in the operation, beyond working with Town Watch and
going on neighborhood walks. The goal is to
increase mentorship and volunteerism as
well, and this can be done through many
other affiliated organizations and service

stressing the role of intervention in the plan.
"The only thing more police officers are
going to do is lock more men up. The fact is,
what this movement does is prevent them
from being locked up, is being proactive....
We're not taking the place of police; it's a
partnership."
According to the operation's spokesperson Norm Bond, men are still going through
orientation and training. "We're looking at
completing that process within the next
week," Norm said on Wednesday. They plan
to have men out on the streets within the
next 30 days. So far, an estimated 3,000 men

responsibilities include taking notes on the
neighborhood and areas .that need cleaning
up or have suspicious people.

Philadelphia, if my voice or my action can
make one step to keep something from being
out of the ordinary or violent, then that's
why I'm here, to make a difference," said
Albert Hayden, who was volunteering at the
Liacouras Center by helping men register.
"To be part of something that I think can
be a real positive change in our neighbor-

hood," said volunteer Shareef when asked
why he was at the West Philadelphia High
orientation. Shareef attributed the surge in
violence to "unemployment, lack ofboth parents in the home."
"They're lacking that male role model
and father figure," Shareef said of the young
men committing crimes.
"I just wish it would stop," said Rasheed
Collins, a young man who attended the rally.
"I hope something good comes out of this, I
hope people don't say 'lt was something they
just did it one day and that was it'
we're
going to keep going and keep going."
After the 90-day period of patrolling and
peacekeeping, the movement will step back
to assess its impact and reevaluate its goals
and methods.
The coming weeks and months will show
whether or not this potentially historic
movement will succeed, but organizers and
volunteers are enthused by the subsequent
turnout at local trainings and by the spirit of
initiative and personal responsibility for
one's community that has permeated the
movement. "All of us are going to do it, and
that's never happened. That's the missing
ingredient," Islam said. "This is a long-term
effort."

Transparency, endowment topics of finance forum
3

From COLLEGE FINANCE, p.

Gardner also said that he hoped this discussion helped
to point out how major a factor philanthropy is in terms of
funding for the college. "Today's students are tomorrow's
alums," he said. "The discussion was important from a
development point of view as well."
Roberts agreed that the discussion was successful.
"Many people had mixed feelings about the way the school
makes decisions, on things like socially responsible investing, for example, but I think everyone was glad to learn
more
everyone's glad it happened," she said.
"We are considering holding a second round, focused
primarily on financial aid, with [Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid] Jim Bock," Asarnow said. "If there is student interest, we will plan this with Jim Bock."
"President Bloom and Sue Welsh have been behind this
the whole way
this has been really important to them,

too," Asarnow said.
In interviews with The Phoenix, Bloom and Welsh
explained further explored some of the points made at
Tuesday's discussion.
Bloom said that he has been wanting to hold a discussion on the financial structure of the college for some time
to satisfy students' intellectualfascination with the college
budget, as well as to get across the major role of philanthropy and how institutions like Swarthmore survive even
though costs are much higher than tuition.
"At the last RA dinner, I stated talking about these
issues, and I was pleased to see how interested students
were," he said. Bloom said that beforehand, he was confident that the information presented at the meeting would
be well received.
Bloom also expressed hope for future discussions like
this one. "It would be wonderful to begin a tradition which
had precedence with periodic meetings with students on
topics of mutual concern," he said.
According to Bloom, issues like this have been discussed on a much smaller scale at Kohlberg fireside chats,
but he decided with Student Council to make this one a
larger forum, changing both the name and the venue.
Bloom said thathe hoped students would take away several major understandings from Tuesday's discussion
including an "overall view of how the college is financed,
why despite our sizable tuition and endowment we all still
have to live underfinancial constrains and how imperative
philanthropy has been and will continue to be to the college."
"I would hope that my office is seen as very approachable whatever opportunities I have to show that it is will

help to create a greater readiness to use that approachability," Bloom said. "If students have suggestions, ideas or
just want to get to know the president, they would have to
make an appointment, but I would appreciate them coming
to see me."

"If a student has an idea that

requires

more under-

standing than can be taken from the data that is available,
they should take the initiative to ask," Bloom said. "If a student is serious about understanding in detail, the college
will do its best to make that information available
though not everything can be released."
While Welsh confirmed that Tuesday's discussion was
the most wide-ranging forum on the college's finances that
the administration has held, she and other administrators
would be happy to do this again on the same or other topics. "We want to encourage this
it is really important for
students to understand the financial structure [of the college]."
"It is important to understand the role of philanthropy
and to discuss priorities
we welcome student input."
Welsh said that she and Bloom were pleased with student turnout at Tuesday's discussion. "We were also
pleased to get such thoughtful questions and dialogue
going."
According to Welsh, the original idea for the discussion
on financial structure came up last spring, though the
scheduling did not work out until this fall, when Student
Council continued planning the event with administrators.
"We're willing to share quite a bit we don't want to
give the impression that everything is closed and nontransparent," she said.

Welsh stressed that there are four student members on
the college budget committee, and that the Student Council
president and vice-president, Peter Gardner and Sam
Asarnow, observe the Board of Managers meetings and are
privy to all the budget information that is discussed.
While Welsh said that the college can talk in general
terms about the budget and financial structure, details
such as departmental budgets are kept confidential for several reasons. "Budgets are important to people [who manthey reflect their authority and accountabiliage them]
ty," she said. "People compete to get more resources in
their area There is more information we can give than
what was discussed last night, but we won't get into departmental budgets."
However, Welsh noted that departments are free to disclose information on their budgets if they choose to do so,
though she would not be able to disclose such information.
Welsh acknowledged that public institutions are
required to be more open with regard to their financial

...

information, and even publish salaries. "I've never worked
in a public institution there is a different decision making structure," she said. "Our structure is probably more

efficient... We would have to explore this question would
better decisions be made with a more public disclosure of
detail? We don't think so, otherwise we would be exploring
that."

and

Swarthmore, with
five teams.
The scoring was
based on how many
out of five problems
each team could
complete correctly
within the allotted
time

five-hour
frame.

Within these daunting five hours, each team of three students had to design test beds and construct the software necessary to solve the problems, followed by thorough evaluation and scoring by the judges. In this competition there are
only two types of answers: right or wrong. Andrew Danner,
Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science and coadvisor
of
the
Swarthmore
computer programming team said, "The judges are
very meticulous in terms ofhow the problems are solved. If
you hit the space bar one too many times, you lose it."
At the end of the competition, three Swarthmore teams
solved at least one problem, and one team was able to complete two problems, tying for second place with the teams
from Johns Hopkins and University of Maryland. However,
the tie-breaker led to victory for the University of
Maryland, whose team was able to solve the problems
faster.
The results on the competition's Web site show that
Swarthmore landed a third place finish and is now ranked
33rd in the Mid-Atlantic region. Madeleine Abramowitz 'lO,
a two-time competitor in the competition, was very pleased

with the turnout of the event. "Everyone had a really great
time, and even though we didn't do as well as we would have
liked, we were still able to have fun," Abramowitz said.
One aspect that did make the competition more difficult,
however, was the programming "language barrier." This
competition is done entirely in C++ or JAVA, while
Swarthmore students are taught how to use only Python in
the introductory-level course.
Fortunately, there were three Swarthmore students who
were familiar with the necessary programming languages,
and one of themwas in Madeleine's group. "We were able to
divide up the tasks so that one of my two teammates and I

November 8, 2007

worked on solving the problem, while the third member
then worked on the translation (of the solutions),"
Abramowitz said.
However, not all participants were entirely impressed
by the format and structure of the competition. Allison
Barlow 'OB, a first-time competitor, disliked the fast-paced
nature required to succeed in the competition.
"There is encouragement for taking short-cuts," Barlow
said. "You have to be cautious not to make any slip-ups at
all in this process, but that type of programming makes it
difficult to de-bug, should that be necessary."
Abramowitz added that "everything about the event was
exactly the same as last year, except this year had lots more
people from our school competing." Both Barlow and
Abramowitz agreed that everyone had a good time, and
Danner gave his own advice to future computer programmers interested in participating next year. "It was an
encouragement for students to want to take Computer
Science 35, so that they'll have the background necessary to
come back and win next year."
He also mentioned that recently there has been
interest in perhaps organizing a programming contest that
Swat could host in the near future. "We're teaching in
Python as are some other surrounding schools (including
Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges), and even
for those who know how to use C++ and JAVA, using
Python is easier to write correct programs quickly,"
Danner said.
This competition served as an opportunity for the students to scope out other programming languages and other
teams' strategies for complex problem-solving, and a motivating experience for many students who expressed wishes

to return next

year.

work

Thus far, I have written
mostly on what I would call
body-based activism: personal
actions one can take in order to
live responsibly on the planet.
This week, I want to talk about
the world of representation in
environmental issues, mostly to
get the word out on some great
progress in student agency over
ethical living at Swarthmore

and how you can take action.
There are now two committees: the Sustainability SubMARSHALL MORALES
committee of the 2025 Planning
Committee (appointed through
Greenery
formal process) and a consensus Committee on Sustainability, made up of students, faculty
and staff working daily on issues concerning sustainability. The first
is vital for integrating sustainability into the long-term mission of the
college; the second is indispensable to allowing all the stakeholders to
work together. Considering our 'B-' grade from the Sustainable
Endowments Institute, these moves from the administration are wellfounded for the leadership of our institution in higher education.
This brings up a larger point. If you feel that your environmental
or organizing concerns are not being met, e-mail those groups and provide feedback on what you want students and the school to work on.
Some may think the old letter-writing campaign is passe or unproven,
but I challenge you to prove the pundits wrong! Please (please, please)
write to me your vision of the sustainable future of Swarthmore.
Please CC our President (ablooml). Here are pointers on the issues for
the knowledge-hungry yet fact-deficient.
1) Carbon Inventory: We need to catalogue in a detailed, updatable
report our carbon emissions as accurately as possible so that we know
the chief sources on our campus and can find the most affordable
means to reducing our carbon emissions. Doing this on our campus
encourages other educational institutions to do the same. Every
movement needs a vanguard, and what good is an ivory tower that
does not fulfill our ideals.
2) Food: As far as I am aware, no other university has attempted to
incorporate emissions from the production, transport and storage of
food in their carbon inventories, even though they may account for 3040 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is an opportunity
for Swarthmore to set the bar for inclusive carbon inventories that
focus more on changing daily lives of the community rather than
retrofitting expensive piping in the boiler plant (as other schools have
chosen to do). Food and recycling is the only component of our campus operations that the Sustainable Endowments Institute graded 'A'
(up from 'B' last year and the only grade that improved). We are at the
front of this pack and can move forward even more.
3) Waste: As activists and community members can tell you, the
presence of toxic facilities in and around Chester is astounding.
Earthlust is working hard directly with community members on these
issues and supporting recycling on our campus, while the Good Food
Project has initiated a pilot composting program this semester. The
administration has supported these initiatives, and the Sustainability
Committee will be vital for coordinating these efforts. Swarthmore
has an obligation to educate its students on the importance of recycling and composting as ethical waste management.
In another vein, the leadership and membership of organizations
working on environmental issues at Swarthmore has recently been
called into question in the public forum. Some say those working on
environmental issues are almost homogenously white and wealthy,
historically a common accusation towards environmentalists often
matched with the (often accurate) point that their campaigns are concerned with the wealth and health of the affluent only in (overdeveloped nations. This is most decidedly not the case at Swarthmore.
Environmental organizations maintain at least modestrepresentation
of people of color and students from working class backgrounds
(myself included), and work on issues of environmental justice in
Chester. I say this to emphasize that environmental advocates on our
campus speak for a range of communities and, though representation
could be improved, have influenced the actions and efficacy of these
groups as a whole. Environmental interests of people of color and the
working class are represented and considered in Earthlust and the
Good Food Project to a degree conspicuously absent at other schools.
But these groups need to know more from the student body and
encourage you to take a step to write a short e-mail to Facilities, the
President, Earthlust or the Good Food Project to claim your support
for these issues and put in your voice. We need to hear it.

Imani Winds impresses crowd
BY SUNNY COWELL

scowelll@swarthmore.edu

On Sunday, Nov. 4, the Grammy-nominated
Imani Winds performed in the Lang Concert Hall
as part of the Orchestra 2001 concert series. The
group gave an astounding performance to a full
and enthusiastic audience. Imani Winds bring a
fresh edge to traditional wind quintet repertoire
with the fusion of European, African and Latin
American music. Imani Winds consists of five talented musicians, Valerie Coleman on flute, Toyin
Spellman-Diaz on oboe, Mariam Adam on clarinet,
Jeff Scott on horn and Monica Ellis on bassoon.
The group has an extensive touring schedule
nationally and internationally, and recently performed in Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, San
Francisco and Washington, D.C.
Imani Winds opened the French music themed
concert with Eugene Bozza's "Scherzo" (1905-1991).
Next, they played the famous and very melodic "Le
Tombeau de Couperin" by Maurice Ravel (18751937). They finished the first half of the program
with "Scherzo" by Cesar Franck (1822-1890),
arranged by Geoffrey Emerson.
There was a diverse audience comprised of
Swarthmore students and community members
that have been supporting the college for years.
One couple, Ken and Eleanor Hiebert, parents of
biology professor Sarah Hiebert Burch, has been
supporting the Orchestra 2001 concert series since
1993.
Eva Amesse 'll said, "I loved how they interacted with each other" in reference to the group's visible sense of unity expressed on stage while they
played. Fumiko Egawa 'IL who had previously
heard about the group from a friend, was also very
impressed with the new level of energy Imani
Winds brought to the stage. Many audience mem-

bers talked about the group's visual stimulation
and how Imani Winds seemed to have a musical
conversation and unity while they played.
Imani Winds began the second half of the concert with Mozart's "Divertimento" in B flat Major

Clare Kobasa Phoenix Staff

Imani Winds performs with Orchestra 2001 in Lang
Music Hall on Sunday Nov. 4
(1756-1791). The group ended the performance with
the beautiful and very rhythmic World Premier of
Concerto "Afro-Cuban" for Wind Quartet and
Orchestra composed by Imani Winds' own Valerie
Coleman. Orchestra 2001 joined the group in performing this piece. When writing this composition,

Coleman built upon the instrumentation of
Mozart's famous "Sinfonia Concertante," which
features a wind quartet. The work has three movements: Afro, Vocalise and Danza. Each movement
has a tribal and spiritual essence incorporating
improvisation and authentic Afro-Cuban percussion instruments. Imani Winds finished the performance with a bang to deafening applause as
well as a standing ovation from the audience. The
group indulged the audience again with an encore
of "Umoja," one of the group's standard pieces.
Overall, Imani Winds gave both a visually and
aurally enticing performance that was well
received by the audience. A reception in the lobby
followed the concert where audience members
could meet with the artists.

bites and various skin conditions.
While in Venezuela, Heo experienced the
vastly different conditions of health care
firsthand. "The clinic is a home, just with
open doors. It was amazing to see the lack of
equipment there," Heo said. "The table
where we did the paperwork was the same
table where we stitched patients. We just
laid some plastic down."
Heo also observed how Sambrano had to
work with limited supplies. The health
administration gives doctors set supplies of
medicine, regardless of what quantities or
medications are actually needed. Additional
supplies must be flown at great expense by
plane to the remote village.
Part of Heo's learning experience included adjusting to the 'amazing amount of
responsibility" of a doctor. "The patients
who came in with malaria, their lives were
in the doctor's hands, our hands," Heo

explained.

tliaol@swarthmore.edu
When Yongjun Heo 'O9 first arrived in
Venezuela, he was armed only with limited
Spanish and no formal medical training.
The very next day, Heo found himself in
the jungle, working as the primary assistant
to a doctor responsible for 4,000 patients. He
would stay there for the next two months,
living what he calls "the best experience of
my lifetime."
It all began last year, when Heo decided
he "wanted to try doing something different." Andres Pacheco 'O9 told Heo of an
opportunity to work with Simon Sambrano,
a doctor working in a free medical clinic providing care in the village of Uriman.
Heo was immediately interested and
applied for a Swarthmore Summer Social
Action award to fund his trip. By April 2007,
he received the grant and "realized I was
going to be in Venezuela in the outskirts of
the Amazon jungle."
Despite his lack of hands-on medical
experience, Heo was trained immediately
and soon responsible for doing "everything
the doctor did. As soon as I stepped off the
little plane, I hit the ground running."
Heo admitted that initially, he was "very,
very hesitant to do anything concerned with
the actual practical medicine because in the
U.S., we don't have that opportunity."
However, Heo quickly found that there
was little time for uncertainty when the clinic fielded 60 patients a day and Sambrano
worked 12-hour days.
"I realized I really needed to do the work.
I dove right in and got over that initial fear
and saw some incredible things," Heo said,
adding that in Venezuela, his college education qualified him for the work.
His schedule was often grueling, starting
at 7 a.m. and lasting for hours as villagers
streamed in and out of the clinic. The majority of Heo's tasks consisted of administering
vaccinations, assisting in childbirths, putting in IV lines for malaria patients and

While Heo became involved in the community, he initially had to overcome language and cultural boundaries with the villagers. It took Heo several weeks to effectively communicate with the villagers with
a combination of his limited Spanish and
hand signals. He remembers that there was
much laughter at the expense of his
"heinous Spanish."

Children from the village of Uriman gather on the bank of a river to watch passers-by.

Heo, who is Korean American, also found
his race to be of great interest to villagers.
"I said I was American and they were
very confused because they expected a
blond, blue-eyed person," Heo said. Over
time, Heo was referred to affectionately as
"chino," Spanish for "Chinese man," and he
soon grew accustomed to the curious stares
of the village children.
When he wasn't treating patients, Heo
actively participated in the community. He
taught children to use a computer or, more
often, explained what a computer was, did
the occasional odd job around the village
and would play soccer with the villagers.
After a month in Uriman, Heo spent a
month in the village of Wonken, with another doctor. While there, he was struck by the

contrast between the two villages.
According to Heo, the economy of
Uriman is based primarily on a diamond
mine that had recently been shut down by
the government. There is a huge economic
crisis in the village, with the result that "the
villagers eat once a day if they're lucky.

Everyone is malnourished."

"Because of this economic shock, lack of
food and lack of hygiene, there has been
more sickness than ever before this past
year," Heo said.
In contrast, Wonken had a comparably
good school based on an agricultural program and the standard of living was much
higher, with the result of fewer patients. Heo
was inspired when he saw how proper education could greatly alleviate the problems
in Uriman by attacking the root causes.
"I began to think, what can I do?" Heo
said, "I realized that the villagers in Uriman
will never have the opportunity to ask anyone for any resources or any help whereas I,
as a college student at a good college, do."

Yongjun Heo enjoys a rare moment of rest on the Caronf River downriver from the village.
Currently, Heo is developing an intern-

ship program for college students to follow
his path, free of charge. Heo has met with
Venezuelan officials, as well as Swarthmore
faculty about realizing his program and
received positive support. He is recruiting
students from Swarthmore and other colleges for the program. After graduation,
Heo plans to return to Uriman and help
create agricultural schools and malaria
prevention programs. However, Heo stresses that making a difference doesn't always

"Tutoring children in Chester, participat-

ing in volunteer activities at Swarthmore,
these are all avenues to do good in the world.
With the opportunities you are given at
Swarthmore, you can do a lot, and that's one
of the biggest things I've learned," Heo said,
"If enough people can work to do that, I
think we can slowly make things right."

SWARTHMORE

UPROOTED

Fall LSE act The Roots and Hezekiah bring down the house with their unforgettable performances
BY ANNA ZALOKOSTAS
azalokol@swarthmore.edu

This Saturday I did something new: I stopped doing
homework before 6 p.m. (actually, I stopped at 4:30
CRAZY, I know) and then I went to go see The Roots,
Hezekiah, and some seriously incredible light shows.
Starting off Saturday's Large Scale Event with solid synthfunk and hip-hop beats, Philadelphia native Hezekiah and
D J Static got the 800 or so students in Land Performing Arts
Center dancing, moving, bopping, calling and responding,
shouting back "You psycho! / You psycho!" to fill in the lyrics
of his song "Psycho Chicks," and even jumping on stage, in
the case of two awfully brave girls, to lithely dance along to
"I'm Single Now."
Though Hezekiah's fusion of live and electronic hip-hop
did certainly engage the crowd, it wasn't until The Roots
entered the stage that LPAC thundered with cheers. The
floor of the lower level started shaking in a way that eerily
reminded me of that precarious looking bridge you had to
somehow manage to get all your Zoombinis across during
fourth grade computer class. Roots crew members MC Black
Thought, ?uestlove, Captain Kirk, Kamal Gray, F Knuckles,
"Tuba Gooding Junior" and Owen Biddle started off the
night with a beautifully grand, jazzy symphonic sample of
songs off their newest album, "Game Theory," before they
plunged into a long series of pop covers.
While many students enjoyed this part of the concert
most, since songs like "Sexy Back" and "This Is Why I'm
Hot" were ones they'd heard before and had fun dancing to,
others could not help but see the irony of the situation.
"All I can do is frame it within the context of a spectacle
of global capitalism," Dennis Hogan 'lO said. "This concert is
an example of how something which is hip-hop, which was
originally against the dominant culture, has been integrated
into the dominate consumerist market, and I couldn't help,

as much as I enjoyed the concert, thinking about how The
Roots were here, putting on a spectacle, because we paid
them money to put on something spectacular."
Though it seems that some people could have gone for a
few more Roots songs in place of the Paces-reminiscent covers, one of the most memorable songs of the night was, in
fact, a cover
a Roots-ified version ofBob Dylan's "Masters
of War." Starting out by singing Dylan's lyrics to the tune of
the Star-Spangled Banner, The Roots introduced the song in
the context of contemporary politics and talked about how

Bob Dylan actually took a stand and protested against the
things he didn't believe in. Though that statement wasn't
necessarily accurate, the lengthy jam session and the
crescendo of instrument solos that ensued was unquestionably one of the highlights of the night.
Regardless of what you thought about the covers, it's

undeniable that The Root's performance on Saturday night
was positively thrilling and one of the best that Swarthmore
has seen in a long time. Rachel Baumann 11 said that the
legendary crew "did a great job interacting with the crowd,"
and that she "especially liked the tuba player," whose stage
presence and smooth harmonies were beyond the realm of
impressive.
David Weeks 'lO said, "I was really impressed by their
ability not to just regurgitate their songs, or their top hit list.
I felt like they gave us a show in the real sense of the word,
in that they displayed their musical talent. I mean, they had
the balls to play This Is Why I'm Hot' and then they went
into that Bob Dylan thing, which I think is a real testament
to ?uestlove's ability as a drummer. Those two things put

Indulging in guilty pleasures on the tube

BY JOAN KIM

Television is going down the tubes and we absolutely
love it. We have replaced television with problem sets
and scores of pages of dense philosophical readings from
which we all want to escape. Club meetings and sports
have been another excuse to miss scheduled
shows. However, the new magic of full, free online
episodes has opened a new portal to another land of procrastination.
We have obsessed about what "The Others" would do
next on "Lost" (cue the dramatic sound effects). The Jim
and Pam romance captured the hearts of many hopeful
"The Office" watchers. Dr. McDreamy swept us away in
"Grey's Anatomy" and everyone has or knows someone
who has watched an entire season of
"Scrubs" in one sitting. Some of

Honestly, when I first heard the title, I thought
that I was above all that, but after watching the

only kicker is, if Ned and Chuck ever touch, Chuck will
die and be lost forever since Ned cannot bring anything
back to life more than once. With characters named
Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth) and characters that
play hermit-like, former synchronized swimmers, the
essence of the show sings out fairy tale. The witty banter
between the characters and the strange quirks of each
character keep the audience attentive.
Narrator Jim Dale leads the audience along throughout each episode, which give way to phantasmagorical
settings and scenes. Characters spend episodes visiting
windmills for hidden treasures and driving mini-cars
powered by daisy-fuel. "Pushing Daisies" is a wonderfully, refreshing show with a bit of cheesiness that leaves
you floating on a cloud. ABC, Wednesdays 8 p.m.

Time's a wastin' on the World Wide Web
BY ALEXANDRA ISRAEL

aisraell@swarthmore.edu

Now, I know, as Swarthmore students,
that we spend all our time working in the
library, bent studiously over our textbooks
or furiously typing papers. When we have a
free moment, we're usually found doing

charitable work, practicing music or playing a varsity sport. Sometimes, however,
even a Swattie needs a break from continuous productivity, and that's where I come
in. I'm here to introduce you to the world of
delightful internet time suckers that can do
anything from giving you a quick break
from those 80 pages of econ reading to causing you to stay up all night in a desperate
attempt to keep your toast avatar from
being devoured by a giant squid (more on
that one later). So sit back, relax and make
sure that your computer is ready, because
you're going to want to test these out.
Possibly in lieu of doing that problem set
you've been obsessing over.
The first and biggest Internet time-sucker is Facebook. You all know this, so I
won't spend a lot of time detailing the
numerous gift-giving, zombie-attacking and
small-animal-racing applications you can
add to your Facebook profile. However, I
the "Addicted t0..."
will mention one
application. This is the one that keeps me
up at night in an attempt to prove to my
friends that I do, in fact, know more about
"Lord of the Rings" than they do. (I do,
thank you very much). This app has trivia
quizzes, quotes and pictures from any TV
show that you can think of, as well as vari-

14

ous movies, books and comics. It's well puttogether and fun, and it allows you to prove
to your friends that you know more than
they do. Always a plus.

"Charlie the Unicorn" is
great if you want your
childhood images of
unicorns and candy turned

completely upside-down.
Next on everyone's list of time-wasters

is Youtube. There are innumerable videos
to watch, and I know that you've probably
seen many of them, so I'll just mention a

few. Both "Shoes" and "Let Me Borrow that
Top" play to the vain shopaholic girl we
either know or secretly are; "Terrorist
Subtitles" is an amazingly funny satire of
war correspondents and insurgents; and
"Charlie the Unicorn" is great if you want
your childhood images of unicorns and
candy turned completely upside-down. I
would also recommend "Medieval Help
Desk," "Women in Film" and anything
involving Monty Python or Parkour, a
sport that has participants leaping from
building to building in acrobatic stunts.
Now, on to less well-known, but equally
fun, sites. Entertainment Weekly's website (www.ew.com) has a dailyphoto gallery
that can be anything from a recap of a certain actor or actress' previous best roles to

»^"/°en,

a countdown of anything (be it the hottest
celebrities of the 90's, the juiciest celebrity
scandals or the most sexually explicit song
lyrics ever) or even just a list of things that

the Entertainment Weekly staffers hate.
The Internet Movie Database
(http://www.imdb.com) is a searchable database of every film ever
made, which in-cludes cast
lists, trailers and photos. You
could start an account and
take part in a discussion board
about your favorite movie or you could
play the IMDb version of "Six Degrees of
Kevin Bacon" by picking an actor, then, one
of their co-stars, then one of the co-stars' costars and so on until you get back to your

original actor.

Another great website is Addicting
Games (http://www.addictinggames.com),
where you can play such favorites as "Toast
of War," in which you are a piece of toast
fighting evil sticks of butter (and squids, for
some reason), and "Indestructo-Tank," in
which you are a tank that can bounce off

other tanks. Another good option is
Bored.com (http://www.bored.com), where
you can find the incredibly addictive game
"Boomshine."
For the fashion- and gossip-obsessed,
there's the "Celebrity Fashion Hit or Miss"

and clothing-minded shoppers out there,
AllPosters (http://www.allposters.com) is a
great place to browse when looking for just
the right poster to inject some personality
into your room; I recommend the selection
of vintage propaganda advertisements. If
you're looking for just the right book to
read outside of class visit The Strand's web
site (http://www.strandbooks.com). The legendary New York City bookseller has every
book you can think of at discounted prices,
and you can even buy cool bags and t-shirts
to show off your love of reading.
I hope that you've learned something
from this article; namely, how to waste
your precious time, give yourself a break
from studying and learn a juicy piece of
celebrity gossip or get some new shoes
while you're at it. And if your professor
asks why you didn't manage to finish that

made high heel marks power, grooming and
professionalism. Or perhaps we can go a step
further, and argue the heel, in all its blistering impracticality, is designed to signal
social status, much like the hard-to-maneuver Victorian corset and bustle combo? After
all, rendering yourself vastly less mobile
proves that you don't have to engage in any
kind of physical labor.

As I understand it, the primary purpose

of a winter coat is warmth. But fashion is all
about challenging conventional wisdom.
Navy paired with black was a faux pas of
poor lighting until it turned unbearably
sophisticated; slouching bobby socks with
pumps were dorky until suddenly they
weren't. And now, short and 3/4 sleeve winter coats, which once seemed fundamentally
contrary to their purpose, sashay down
Madison Avenue as though cold forearms

were the new it-accessory.
Yet to lambaste fashion's whimsy for
impracticality is to accuse Nantucket of
being just a little too inaccessible: in other
words, that's the point. If function begat
form, then stiletto heels, white pants and
dry-clean only children's wear would be safely sequestered to the realm of the hypothetical. As they are, for better or for worse,
among us and available for sale at Macy's,
there must be another force at work inspiring designers to crop their sleeves at the
elbow.

The key is in the expanded redefinition of
"function." Fashion may not be practically

functional, but it is certainly semiotically

functional; if the stiletto heel

or even the

less extreme high-but-not-dagger-like heel
were judged based on its ability to facilitate

movement outdoors, then it would be a mas-

sive failure and we would all wear sneakers
with good arch support. But we don't.

Despite the assertion of certain male cohorts
that high heels are not in fact attractive but
"terrifying," let's say that the stiletto does
have some kind of aesthetic appeal. The fact
that the shoe contorts the body into positions
that accentuate the breasts and hips, elongate and sculpt the legs and significantly
hinders the wearers' mobility turns the

wearer into a kind of caricature of womanhood. It's not an accident; it's intrinsic to the
design of the contemporary heel, which,
shall we say, "functions" as a marker of fem-

ininity.

To lambaste fashion's
whimsy for impracticality is
to accuse Nantucket of
being a little too inaccesible:
that's the point.
It's true, of course, that all trends "function," at least somewhat, as markers of social

status and economic prowess. Wearing the
latest trends proves not only that you're hip
to this season's preferred cuts/colors/shapes,

but also that you have the economic means
to be so. The cropped sleeve coat, however,
pushes the status implications into the realm
of the bustle, the corset and the high heel. If
your winter coat stops at the elbow, clearly
you're not spending your day outdoors. Even
though I'll bet the vast majority of urbandwellers wearing cropped-sleeve jackets
actually do depend on public transportation,
the garment seems designed specifically to
announce that the wearer's private car picks
her up outside her brownstone every morning. As Gregg Andrews, fashion director for
Nordstrom, explained it to the Chicago
Tribune, "This is where the coat has evolved

from being a utility item and a necessity into
being a fashion item." Flaunting its impracticality, the short-sleeve coat screams out
"luxury item."

No plot? No problem! NaNoWriMo begins
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY LIANA KATZ

lkatzl@swarthmore.edu
It took F. Scott Fitzgerald the better part of three years to
write his 50,000 word novel, "The Great Gatsby." National
Novel Writing Month, a writing contest during the month of
November, challenges ambitious amateur authors to write
50,000 words in just 30 days. Novels can be written about
any subject, in any genre and can even make no sense at all.
The contest's only stipulation is that its participants,
known as "Wrimos," have 50,000 words written by Nov. 30 at
11:59 p.m. All who do so are declared "winners."

"Ideally, my novel will spring forth
and capture both the Pulitzer and
the Nobel prizes on its own."
Greg Albright 'lO
NaNoWriMo veteran
NaNoWriMo was created by Chris Baty, a freelance journalist from San Francisco, in 1999. Gathering momentum
and recognition, the contest has grown from 21 registered
participants in 1999 to 79,000 in 2006. In an interview with
Vision Magazine, Baty said that NaNoWriMo is intended to
stress "that you can have fun writing novels even if you're
not particularly gifted at it."
"Valuing enthusiasm and perseverance over painstaking
craft," as NaNoWriMo's web site declares, the month is a
testament to quantity over quality.
In order to participate, hopeful Wrimos are encouraged
to register with NaNoWriMo's web site and to update their
novels as they progress throughout the month. The website
hosts an active and supportive forum community where
Wrimos can turn to find advice about everything
NaNoWriMo. There are groups for everybody, from authors
struggling with writing romantic fiction to teens struggling
to balance writing and high-school.
NaNoWriMo has even managed to steal time away from
busy Swarthmore students. Bethanne Albert-Bruninga 'lO is
attempting her fourth NaNoWriMo. She has yet to complete

a novel in the past, but this year she may have a better
chance. Her strategy is to team up with some friends from
other universities for late-night writing binges and to fuel
her frenzy with coffee. Albert-Bruninga first found out
about NaNoWriMo from a high-school friend, but is unsure
why she continues to participate as the writing process is
"pretty suicidal."
Yet, she recognizes that "the stress and the deadline [are]
part of the fun, because you can't worry about whether or
not what you're writing is actually any good." AlbertBruninga also enjoys creating and animating her novels'
fitfully and
characters, even though "they come to life
...

incompletely."
According to Albert-Bruninga, her novel "explores sexuality in a friendship between two women. It follows them
from through their lives from when they meet in high
school."

Like Albert-Bruninga, Greg Albright 'lO is also a
NaNoWriMo veteran and is participating this year
out of habit." Albright takes a mathematicalapproach to the
month and writes approximately 1667 words per day, adding
up to a total of 50,000 on Nov. 30. "I have a sheet taped to my
desk lamp showing word-count per day, and I will not go to
bed until I've made word count," Albright said. Unlike
Albert-Bruninga, Albright plans on revisiting and revising
his novel after NaNoWriMo is over. "Ideally, my novel will
spring forth and capture both the Pulitzer and the Nobel
prizes on its own," Albright said, "More realistically, I will
ignore it for December and begin editing over winter
break."
Albright's hopes for literary fame may not be so farfetched. NaNoWriMo has produced some works that were
ultimately successfully published. Sara Gruen's best-selling
novel, "Flying Changes," began as a NaNoWriMo manuscript. Based on her rough start, Gruen was offered a five
million dollar contract from Harper Publishing Company.
Gruen later used NaNoWriMo to prototype her next novel,
"Water For Elephants," which became a New York Times
best-seller.
Maddening, sleep-depriving, rewarding; NaNoWriMo is

all of the above. 50,000 words later, Wrimos are rewarded
with "the glow [that comes] from making big, messy art, and
watching others make big, messy art," says NaNoWriMo's
website. "The act of sustained creation does bizarre, wonderful things to you."

glancing down and igniting dust motes to a brilliant
sheenoflifelike warmth suspended above the stage,
the same warmth captured in the strands of her
sometime-white and sometime-honey hair as it
catches a ray of sunshine. I feel high, the nervousness of theater making my body quiver and the
superposition of images in my mind confusing me
and confusing timeand place. Am I here, about to
enter according to my cue, or ami there, some
amorphous and indefinable there, but there with
her? I feel her essence pulling at me in this moment
of imagination and almost her voice is whispering
in my ear, her overwhelming presence just behind
my shoulder.
My hand goes up, fingers reaching, softly curled,
to brush her curved cheek and feel the silky skin,
but before I touch her I hear my cue and bam! No
longer me but now a character in a play; a quick
glance behind the curtain as I cross the stage shows
that she is gone."

'American Gangster' makes an offer movie watchers can't refuse
BY ABIGAIL GRABER

agraberl@swarthmore.edu

The making of "American Gangster"
deserves an entire movie of its own. Since
2004, at least three directors, two sets of
screenwriters and an ever-rotating galaxy
of movie stars have been attached to the
project. It's been shelved at least twice for
budget reasons, for casting reasons, for
ego reasons, whatever. So when I tell you
to run, don't walk to the Cineplex to catch
the next showing, you'd better believe the

film has earned it.

Scott is best when he steps
back and lets the material
speak for itself. (For. Three.
Hours. Every. Single. Time.)
And take that advice about the running seriously, since nearly all showings
of "American Gangster" sold out at the
AMC Marple in Springfield last Saturday
night. As the film clocks in at a whopping
two hours and 37 minutes, its popularity
should speak for itself. Normally, we
attention-challenged Americans don't
truck with movies that butt-numbingly
long unless the Ring of Power gets
destroyed in the end.
But "American Gangster" overcomes
its lack of hobbits, wizards and ores (no

16

easy feat for any film). Despite its length,
it's both understated and streamlined.

I know you're thinking, "Ridley Scott?
That man wouldn't know 'understated
and streamlined' if it danced a naked jig
in front of him! Woman, did you not see
'Kingdom of Heaven?'" Yes, and I paid
dearly for that mistake. Scott is best when
he steps back and lets the material speak
for itself. (For. Three. Hours. Every.
Single. Time.) His worst movies feel
manipulated
and
self-conscious.
"American Gangster" grows at its own
pace, and one can scarcely see the director's hand at work, were it not for the
obligatory casting of Russell Crowe. Scott
made a film about drug kingpins, crooked
cops and some really, um, interesting New
York accents feel organic, at times even
elegant.
Part of the credit must be given to
screenwriter
Oscar-winning
Steven
Zaillian, redeeming himself after the
bloated monstrosity of "All the King's
Men" (and I'm not just talking about Sean
Penn). He clearly went through the
screenplay with a red pen, trimming the
fat and tightening the remains. We are left
with no plot exposition and yet do not
notice, so tightly packed are Zaillian's
sentences with meaning and information.
This belying simplicity is much needed for a tale that will take you long
enough to disentangle without the overwrought pontifications of an overexcited
screenwriter in the way. "American
Gangster" recounts the true story of the
rise and fall of Harlem drug lord Frank

Lucas (Denzel Washington
the "truth"
breaking down immediately, for somewhere the real Frank Lucas wonders

whether his teeth were ever so impossibly
and
white). Richie Roberts (Crowe
somewhere the real Richie Roberts wonders whether his accent was ever that
bad) is assigned to track down the man
behind a suspiciously cheap, mysteriously pure new brand of heroin that has cornered the market.

Receiving an important

message while not being
bludgeoned over the head
with the obvious is always
a plus in any movie.
Zaillian and Scott do an excellent job
switching between Lucas' and Roberts'
operations just enough for the audience to
slowly piece together exactly how Lucas
is "selling something twice as good for
half as much" and how Richie is going to
catch him. For Roberts' part, this mainly
seems to involve driving around taking
photographs, but in a gripping, exciting

kind of way. Lucas' machinations are

much more exotic and not to be spoiled.
Scott and Zaillan have much to say
about the obvious topics of the '6os and
racism, the Vietnam War
'7os
but
only do so indirectly and appropriately

November 8, 2007

through the characters themselves. For
example, the cops don't even catch on that
Lucas is running the show until halfway
through the film, the District Attorney
protesting, "No black man has accomplished what the American Mafia hasn't
in a hundred years!" Receiving an important message while not being bludgeoned
over the head with the obvious is always
a plus in any movie-going experience.
As Lucas commands the plot,
Washington commands the screen. Every
inch of him reeks of pride and control,
climbing into regal arrogance and disdain
as his carefully monitored operation
begins to fray. He's the kind of actor who

can shoot a guy with total calm and then
flip when his wife tries to rub the blood
out of the carpet instead of properly blotting. Crowe is saddled with really bad
hair and the world's most annoying sideplot (divorced wife, custody battle over
kid
spare me, I've had to review at least
three crime dramas with this same gimmick in the last year), but he certainly
has his moments. I especially liked
Richie's ever-wearier reactions whenever
people reference the time he turned over
one million dollars in unmarked bills
instead of keeping them for himself.
It seems counterintuitive to describe a
movie so long and weighty as concise and
unpretentious. Don't let the running time
keep you away
after an eternity of
forced confinement in our chair at the
theater, your butt may not thank you for
seeing this film, but more importantly,
your brain will.

"I insist upon

never was, and

never could have
been, a brutal
scoundrel." Hail
Muse. It would
make sense to
me for an audience of the 1950s
to decry "Lolita"
by
Vladimir
Nabokov

AAKASH SUCHAK

as

meaningless: it
is meaningless
in the regard

that it comes
with no moral
lesson, lewdness
stains a great
number of its
pages, and our narrator, Frenchman Humbert Humbert,
ends his lusty memoir in the same miserable position as he
began. He is as static as the GreatPlains.
Beyond this, however, stretches an expanse ofmerits that
perhaps were overlooked by the slew of American publishers that initially refused the work; the first being that
"Lolita" the novel is far more than a pornography, as its earliest critics declaimed. The second is that Lolita the character is far more than a young girl, as the narrative might sug-

words or sex or soup

gest.

"Lolita" is not a didactic novel and it's not meant to be.
The work is one of distinct voice, written by a Russian who
mastered English with stunningprecision. Nabokov created
a piece of such sensual rapture it should have easily eluded
its initial banishment (the UK kept the French-published
volume out for years). His talent for the language, his wisdom and wit in the medium of English, has tremendous
force.

As for its "immorality," the author wrote: "For me a work
of fiction exists only in so far as it affords me what I shall
bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow,

ent, but more: upon receipt, as Part II develops, the thrill is
quenched, the fantasy is over, and all that's left is the reality
of the thing. It points towards the danger of romanticizing,
but we can't disregard our hearts: we have to keep dream-

(curiosity,

ing.

somewhere, connected with other states of being where art
tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm." This
idea of 'aesthetic bliss," above all else, is the purpose of this
column, to seek beauty in its multiple forms.
And the pages of "Lolita" overflow with examples.
Speaking to my second point, the opening scenes ofHumbert
Humbert's first love Annabel sweetly explain what
develops, over the time, into the grown man's obses
sion. As a boy, our humble narrator engages in a
erotic relation with a family friend's daughter, a
relation of such fierceness and passion restricted
by the limits of their overwrought parents, they
enjoy their vacations seeking any scrap of privacy: "There, on the soft sand, a few feet away from
our elders, we would sprawl all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of
every blessed quirk in space and time to touch

each other: [...] sometimes a chance rampart built
by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each other's salty lips; these

incomplete contacts drove our healthy inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cool blue water, under
which we still clawed at each other, could
bring relief."
The next year Annabel dies of Meghan Downie
typhus in Corfu and Humbert is left
Phoenix Staff
with aching, perpetual desire for that
pre-pubescent wrestling. He grows, becomes an
invincible scholar of French literary translation,
and creates Annabel again in another: Dolores Haze. Lo.
*

Lolita.
It is a result of this creation which births a pursuit that
characterizes Part I of the novel, and I take from this that
Lolita is not just the inappropriate obsession of a grown
man, but a symbol of the endless desire in all of us for those
things we as humans yearn for; within each heart it's differ-

When Humbert is exposed to Lo for the first time a gross
aberration of Oedipus develops: the male still possesses the
desire and bloodlust, but he dons the father position.
Humbert is enamored with the littleLolita and wants to kill
her mother, Charlotte, for time with the girl. Humbert
ould consume the novel without his peculiar lust: he
really is deranged, and the truth of it haunts us in the
narrative's practical points, but we are so seduced by
the writing, by the wit, by Humbert's eloquence, we
forget the violation he is presenting.
Slowly we begin to detest our narrator, that horrid Humbert, for detaining his concubine at such
length, all artful speculation has been lost to the reality of violation, and two years of her has not satisfied
him. He drives himself along to insanity (he's been
institutionalizedmore than once before) and we wonder "What are we doing trusting our crazed narrator?" We see the deranged gentleman manipulate
so many women with his European charm, and
when he turns that charm on us, we're dumbfounded, caught in his trap. The character, for
his dubious practices and rich personality,
makes "Lolita" one of the finest works of
English fiction.
Seeing her years after she finally escaped
w
from him, 17, pregnant, lost in hillbilly Ohio, he
just lovesher. It's no longer pedophilia but unconditional love: "And I looked and looked at her, and I
knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more
than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or
hoped for anywhere else." This declaration contrasts the
witty, scholarly prose of the rest of the novel; it is a resigned
confession of unending, miserable love.

Not just another lit mag The arts in first person
BY SARAH BRICAULT

sbricaul@swarthmore.edu

Eli Epstein-Deutsch 10 decided to
start his own magazine when he realized that "there wasn't a space for me
to write in the Phoenix." He was interested in writing longer pieces, specifically about Philadelphia and students'
encounters with the world outside of
Swarthmore.

From this initial inspiration, the
magazine "burgeoned into a bigger
thing," Epstein-Deutsch said. It is now

intended for articles about "culture
and the arts not on campus" in a style
similar to Harpers, yet it will also
include articles in which students
"express scientific ideas" similar to
pieces found in Scientific American.
This publication will differ from existing magazines and newspapers on
campus because it will consist of mostly longer articles and essays and will
include pieces in which students
express their ideas.

According to Epstein-Deutsch, the

magazine is currently in its

startup

phase and is thus "very open to new
ideas." The magazine is meant to
"appeal to new* voices," to meet the
needs of writers who feel that they do
not fit within the constraints of existing publications on campus. Chief editor Marina Tempelsman 10 said that
"interest set the tone" for the current
form of the magazine. Both EpsteinDeutsch and Tempelsman strongly
encourage anyone who is interested to
contact them. They welcome anyone
with a specific area of interest for an
article or photography or illustrations

THE PHOENIX

to submit. Specifically, they are looking for more editors and are taking
submissions for cover art.
The current deadline for articles
for the first issue is Nov. 16, with the
first issue to be released in early
December. This first issue will be
about 24 pages long. In coming
months, Epstein-Deutsch hopes to fall
into a regular pattern, most likely
printing two or three issues per semes-

ter, but currently the two are trying to

determine the level of interest and the
best form for their as of yet untitled
magazine. However, the magazine is
definitely coming out and any prob-

lems they encounter "will be logistical."
This publication is meant to appeal
to a broad range of readers and writers. The first issue, for example, will
include articles on diverse topics. One
student is writing an essay comparing
the structure of a specific video game
to the structure of language. Another
describes her summer research on
solar magnetism. This issue will also
include a memoir and an article about
playwright Michael Hollinger.

Although Epstein-Deutsch and
Tempelsman do not object to having
perhaps one work of fiction in each
issue, they emphasized that the magazines was not just another literary
magazine. With its longer articles and
essays based on students' ideas, their
magazine is also distinct from the
Living and Arts section of the Phoenix.
Anyone who is interested in becoming a part of this publication should
contact Eli Epstein-Deutsch or Marina
Tempelsman.

Art reflects life, as the saying goes. This
week, the two will become all the more intertwined during the Sixth Annual First Person
Festival of Memoir and Documentary Art, running in Philadelphia from Nov. 7 to 1L Vicki
Solot, the festival's creator, said, "I always was
very

...

interested in people's stories."

Solot also observed a similar movement in
historiography "where individual impressions
and memories of what had happened became
valid ways of accounting for historical events."
Solot has similarly made a point of giving voice
to marginalized communities in her festival.
Showing on Friday as part of the fest's "Free @ 5
Series," the documentary "Garlic and
Watermelons" looks at a Gypsy community displaced because of preparations for the 2004
Olympics in Athens.
Another doc "If You Break the Skin, You Must
Come In" tells a story much closer to home.
Originally, director David Kessler was making a
documentary about Philly-based photographer
Zoe Strauss. Meanwhile, Kessler was teaching
kids in foster care how to shoot film and enlisted
their help for the film. Soon enough, the cameras
were turned on the youth and their lives.
The fest focuses equally on the written word.
On opening night, Laura Schenone read from
her forthcoming book "Lost Ravioli Recipes of
Hoboken" about her journey back to her family's
home in Genoa in search of her great-grandmother's ravioli recipe. On Saturday, in "Race
Matters," June Cross will tell of how, as a mixed
race child, she was given up by her mother and
sent to live with a black couple. Afterwards will
be a discussion with Bryn Mawr College sociology professor Mary Johnson Osirim.
Quite a few events in the festival combine the
two mediums. One such program, "Life and

November 8, 2007

Death over Coffee," on Friday will feature
Michael Gates Gill's memoir "How Starbucks
Saved My Life." Comfortably living as a top
advertising executive, Gill was abruptly laid off
of and, desperate for health insurance, became a
Starbucks barista. The reading is coupled with a
short film documenting comedian Michael
Malkoff s attempt to visit every one of Manhattan's 171 Starbucks cafes in a single day.
Thefest is also holding several workshops. In
"Worn Stories" and "Portrait of a Thing," participants will use old personal belongings to tease
out past memories. There will also be a workshop on blogging, certainly a powerful new
medium for first person arts. Solot said, "with
respect to young filmmakers, emerging artists,
giving them much
we're instrumental in
wider visibility." The fest's biggest success story
to date was this year's memoir winner Deborah
Derrickson Kossmann. After winning, Kossmann saw her story published in the NY Times
column "Modern Love" and now has a book deal.
...

Perhaps the biggest event is the Philly premiere of "Strange Culture," which exposes the
case of Steven Kurtz, an art professor at SUNY
Buffalo accused ofbioterrorism and detained by
the FBI. Self-reflexively experimenting with
dramatizing nonfiction (with reenactments by
actors Thomas Jay Ryan and Tilda Swinton) and
infusing its subject with a scathing activist message, "Strange Culture" melds the fest's two
goals of exploring both the entertainment value
and social value of nonfiction art.
"Personal stories allow you to [jump] into
somebody else's skin," Solot said. "At this time,
when we tend to demonize other cultures
the
...

opportunity to really
understand how other
people live and how they see the world is especially valuable."
All of the festivals events are held on 2111

Benefits of universal health care outweigh costs
In the general election

ofNovember 2008, a question critical to the welfare
of the country is likely to
hang in the balance. With
a Democratic win, the
prospects of implementing a universal health
care system of high quality and convenience in the
U.S. will become brighter.
The National Coalition on
Health Care says that our
health care system is "riddled with inefficiencies,
excessive administrative
expenses, inflated prices,
poor management and

RASA PETRAUSKAITE

m

inappropriate care, waste

and fraud." What bothers
me most is that not all U.S. citizens, let alone residents, can
afford to have surgery or a medical examination. The U.S.
should adopt a universal health care system of the same
quality and convenience as the one that operates now. Some
people certainly disagree with me, but I would like to
address some of their concerns in this article.
Universal health care of high quality and convenience
arguably exists nowhere in the world. However, there is no
reason (other than purely political) why it should not exist.
In Britain, many complain that their universal health care
system functions badly. The same complaint has been made
in Canada and Scandinavia. The problems in Scandinavian
countries stem from the fact that the governments there do
not provide enough funding to hire a sufficient number of
doctors. In some cases, patients have to wait several months
before they can see a dentist or a physician. This is not how
it should be in the U.S. The number of doctors employed in
this country should rise rather than decline from the current level. Waiting periods for appointments longer than
they are now are unacceptable.
Currently, about 40 million Americans live without
health insurance. About 180 million pay for insurance
through their employers, about 30 million purchase it on
their own, and about 80 million have the government pay for
it. This means that about 15 percent ofU.S. citizens may not
be able to afford surgery or medicine. Someone who lacks
the necessary thousands of dollars in his savings and does
not have health insurance may never have his cancerous
tumor detected at an early stage
even though the technology exists.
Bush proposed some health care reforms in 2006, but
none of them adequately address the problem. According to
his plan, a family of four making $25,000 or less would be
able to get a refundable tax credit of $3,000 from the federal
government to help buy insurance. Single people or families
of fewer than four would not qualify, however. Bush also
proposed building over 800 community health centers in
low-income areas. It remains unclear what services the

community centers would provide, how high the quality of
services would be and how much patients would have to pay
for them. In short, Bush's proposals did not include providing all Americans

with health insurance.

An ideal universal health care
system would provide incentives for
patients to seek the best
possible prices for the best
possible services.
Now on to a possible solution: a universal health care system that would make all Americans able to afford life-saving
surgery and necessary medicine. It is possible to implement
a universal health care system in the U.S. that would avoid
such problems as the ones in Scandinavia. The new system
would simply have to be just as good as the current one from
the patient's perspective. It is possible to design it so that it
functions this way. The incentives of patients and doctors
would have to be aligned to reduce economic inefficiencies,
and additional funding would most likely be required.
An ideal universal health care system would provide
incentivesfor patients to seek the best possible prices for the
best possible services. This is why co-payments for seeing
doctors should be preserved at the levels of the typical
health plans thatexist now. Similarly, today's incentives for
seeking generic alternatives to brand-name drugs should
remain. I pay $2O to see a physician, and pay less for generic drugs than for branded products, which should not
change.
The system should also preserve incentives for physicians to provide the best possible care. Patients should continue to be be able to choose which doctors they want to see.
If a patient thinks that his doctor is incompetent, he should
be able to switch without any penalty, the way he can do
now. The new health care system should not be significantly more expensive than our current system. If more doctors
and correspondingly fewer insurance company bureaucrats
were employed in the U.S., then the universal medical system would cost the country approximately the same as the
current exclusive system costs. I would much rather have
more doctors around than private health insurance agents.
Another factor that critics ofuniversal health care cite as

problematic is the cost associated with maintaining high
standards while serving the whole population. Basically, if
more people were eligible to receive medical care in the U.S.,
it would possibly increase the demand for hospitals and doctors. To prevent this, the government would have to be prepared to fund a corresponding increase in supply.
Furthermore, governmental infrastructures and personnel
that do not exist now might need to be put in place. So, it is
likely that a high quality universal care system would
require additional funding, perhaps in the billions of dollars.

Misrepresentation of columnist
■

To the Editor:
I read Charlie Decker's parody of
my column in "The Paenix" twice to
make sure I wasn't being too sensitive. Lord knows I didn't want to
take it too seriously. It wasn't until
a friend of mine called me to ask ifI
had written "that piece in the
Phoenix parody" that I realized how
irresponsible Spike was in publishing Decker's piece.
I have no problem being parodied; it's even a sort ofhonor. I was
there, in fact, when the editors of
Spike decided to have Decker write
this piece. But ifI had seen the final
copy I would have made sure it had-

n't been printed. Forget the fact that
it was immaturely offensive and
grossly misrepresentative of anything I've written. I've written
things I wish I hadn't, and it's fair to
call me out on them, even unintelliI have to accept that as a
gently
consequence of being naive enough
to write a column.
The real point is this: if Decker
wanted to write such an attack, he
should have been bold enough to
put his name and face on the piece.
Associating me with his type of
humor is not just insulting; it's dis-

the

On the other hand, it is possible that a high quality universal health care system might turn out to be cheaper than
the system operating now. If the corporate intermediaries,
such as insurance companies, were eliminated from the
health care equation, medical care would become cheaper
for everyone. The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that
relies on insurance companies to provide medical coverage.
The country also spends aboutfour times more on its health
care system per capita than the average industrialized
nation. While we cannot establish causality here, we can
hardly find another explanation for such a staggering difference.
Also, it is possible that the demand for doctors and hospitals would decrease because more diseases such as cancer
would be diagnosed earlier and treated less expensively,
reducing government expenditure on Medicare. According
to the American College of Physicians, the fact that many
Americans do not have health insurance increases the
financial burden for America as a whole. The uninsured do
not get early detection of diseases, so they often become sick
for prolonged periods and into their elderly years, or they
become disabled. Early detection and treatment are often
less expensive than treating diseases at more advanced
stages. A universal health system would help some individuals avoid getting very sick. A Congressional Budget Office
study found that if health care costs continued growing at
the same rate over the next four decades as they did over the
past four decades, federal spending on Medicare and

reasonable

given the

benefits.

Finally, research findings suggest that some of the high
costs incurred by Americans for health care stem from the
fact that the system is partially for-profit. The World Health
Organization estimates that more than a fifth of all the payments for medical care in the U.S. covers administrative
costs, which include income paid to insurance companies
and to those who audit them. Administrative costs of forprofit hospitals are [about a third] higher than those of public and private non-profit hospitals by about a third. Thus
the growth of for-profit insurance providers and hospitals in
the U.S. has contributed to the growth of health care prices.
A superior universal health care system is worth implementing. Even if it seems more expensive than the existing
system, the benefits would outweigh the cost sand difficulties. The current system already costs 915 billion, but the
price of the new system may actually be less than that. To
further off-set the costs, the government could cut expenditure on other endeavors, such as some portion of the more
than one trillion dollars spent on the Iraq war. What it boils
down to is that everyone living in the U.S., the richest country in the world, should have access to superior and con-

venient medical care.

in Spike's 'The Paenix' libelous
■

To the Editor:
I was excited to read Spike's spoof of The
Phoenix when it was published last week, but I was
extremely upset and offended by one of the pieces
in "The Paenix." "Bad Things Are Bad", allegedly
written by Josh Cohen 'O9, was a distasteful spoof
of Cohen's column in The Phoenix. The joke column made fun of the genocide in Darfur and featured overtly racist statements, among other grievances. What's most egregious in my mind is that
Josh Cohen did not write the column, even though
it was made to look like he did.

editor Jon Peters 'O9 published the column, but neither of their names appeared on the byline of the

made-up topics; this piece included Cohen's actual
headshot, byline, column title and e-mail address,
and it was mainly written on the genocide in
Darfur, a real atrocity that is anything but funny.
For those who know Josh, reading this piece was
startling and a cause for concern. For those who
don't, this piece may have damaged Cohen's reputation.
In his editor's note, Peters cautioned readers
with the following words: "I insist that any and all

If you feel offended, then don't." Peters' disclaimer

Fiscal accountability
Last Tuesday, the Swarthmore
administration opened its arms to
an incredibly important discussion.
In a talk that involved President Al
Bloom and Treasurer Suzanne
Welsh, among others, students were

given the opportunity to learn about
the financial structure of the college.

But while the mere fact that this

conversation happened was of
utmost importance, it seemed to put
emphasis on the necessity for open
communication between the admin-

istration and its students in regards
to how money is used and distributed throughout the college.
First and foremost, we want to
commend Student Council and the
administration for taking the necessary steps to make this discussion
happen in the first place. By organizing this event, both parties showed
observance and care for the concerns of the student body here at
Swarthmore that was greatly appreciated. Many of us came to
Swarthmore well aware of the institution's large endowment and with

the curiosity of how it would affect
us in the years between first collection and graduation. While interest
in the distribution of the college's
funds range from personal issues to
support of social causes, it is quite
clear that students at Swarthmore
desire to be involved in these decisions. Attempting to address these
issues was certainly a step in the
right direction.
However, given the administration's consistent reputation of seeking (and, most importantly, using)
student advice in important decisions, it seems unsettling that there
is little knowledge of where the conversation will go from here. While

President Al Bloom seemed to stress
the administration's desire for student input in the decisions regarding the financial structure of the college, many of the fundamental
aspects needed to make informed
commentary have yet to be
addressed. It makes sense, for business reasons and otherwise, that the
administration should want to keep

some details of its process under
wraps, but without some degree of
transparency, students are left in

the dark. And without more knowledge, it's almost impossible to make
worthwhile contributions to a topic
that many of us are so curious and
concerned about.
When many of us made the decision to enroll at Swarthmore, we did
so with knowledge of the school's
reputation for academic excellence
and quality of life on campus. We
also came in with knowledge of the
responsibility we had to upkeep
these hallmarks of a Swarthmore
education. While it might be correct
to say that the most immediate questions that students have might be
most relevant to current situations,
it's not to say that we aren't also
thinking about the implications that
our actions now have in the future.
With more transparency in the
administration's decisions, and
more proactiveness within the student body in seeking this information, it will be easier to find a middle
ground. If that happens, then students can both be satisfied by know-

ing how the school's financial choices directly affect them now and,
also, how the contributions they

make as future alumni will be
directed to address the concerns of
generations of Swatties to come.

on people's
need for comforting delusion. That is, test prep doesn't do
much for your scores (you're only buying the
opportunity to earn an extra 100 points), and it
certainly doesn't educate you in any meaningful
way. I'll bet that a basic economic analysis would
show that, considering its costs, test prep isn't
worth it. Further, it's clear, especially if you grew
up in a community where test prep is a rite of passage, that the superstitious need to feel like you've
done all you can do, compounded by the fact that
everyone around you is equally superstitious, is
what drives parents to spend thousands of dollars
on tutors for their kids. Corporations will be corporate. What's most egregious is what's evident in
the number of students beginning to exploit the
in my own serious desire to just take
demand
the $6O/hr. job rather than write a column
namely, the way that the test prep culture unique
to our generation is subsuming our minds.
The transformation of students into consumers ruins college education. It seems like too
many institutional decisions are made to cater to
students' fickle demands the flip side of which
is that colleges are hesitant to exert any sort of
potentially offensive authority. More importantly, though, is the way that the Process affects us
on a mostly unconscious level, I think
as
individuals. The first time I considered tutoring a
kid for the SATs, I had this weirdly nostalgic feeling for the confidence I felt in high school, when
the system rewarded me by rating me. I think a lot
of us are similarly torn between our affection for
a system —embodied by the SATs that likes us
so much and our increasing sensitivity to the fact
that the system represents not just a version of
ourselves we want to transcend but a culture we
don't really want either.
This may be sort of absurd, but I'm thinking
about whether I really want the test prep culture
for my kids. No way not just for the unproductive stress, but for the way it singly dominates
education and culture. I hope thatthe system will,
under the duress of its own consumption, implode
like some primordial blob. Until then, though,
we're faced with being society's most wanted. It's
true that students and student-started groups usually charge less than the corporate top dogs, and
that they usually sport some sort ofrhetoric about
reaching out to those that didn't have the privilege they had. And even then, it's still really, real-

since

become a bona

has become a serious employment possibility.
There are the corporate top dogs Kaplan and
the Princeton Review looking to employ recent
liberal arts graduates, but there's also the odd
family friend that calls your mother to see if you'll
help her stressed 16 year-old kid out when you're
home on break, the exclamatory flyers posted
around "top-rated" campuses, and the favor the
middle-aged woman you meet in Da Vinci's tells
you she'll pay you for after you tell her you're a
student. The money is too good and, if you can
handle recognizing yourself in a pathetic kid and
your father in his, the work is too easy. And yet, I
think that those of us that are propositioned to

tutor high school kids
for
their SATs have a responsibility not to do it.
The inequity perpetrated by the SAT is a fact;
and the fact that the inequity is perpetrated by the
test-prep industry seems obvious. Students from
lower economic strata do significantly worse than
students from higher strata, though this is more
the symbolic result of a convergence of external
socio-economic factors than it is the single proof

of the unfairness of the testing system.
The changes made to the test in 2005, which

eliminated analogies, introduced a writing section and made the math less elementary, seem like
an improvement
at least knowing that "oarsman" is to "regatta" as "runner" is to "marathon"
is no longer a requisite piece of knowledge. And a
growing number of colleges are joining the "SAT
optional movement,' which seeks to gradually
lessen the emphasis on standardized testing in
admissions, though with the greater, perhaps selfish, intention to subvert (and correct) the U.S.
News and World Report's infamous rankings.
For now, though, the future isn't an SAT-less
one, and the $lOO million test-prep industry is only
growing. America wants test-prep tutors like
India wants cars, and the past few years have seen

for their SATs is worth more than what it can buy
it could actually initiate a cultural change deep-

the inequities of our education system is your

Diversity within SCF should not be characterized as 'fundamentalist'
SETH DONOUGHE

sdonougl@swarthmore.eclu

I would like to thank Julian Chender for addressing ques
tions of faith in his columns. It is an area of discussion tha
remains far too taboo at Swarthmore. Unfortunately, in his
most recent column "Fundamentalism can
leave little room for discussion" he exem
plifies the misconceptions that many
Swatties have about Christianity in genera
and the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship in particular.
Julian characterizes SCF as fundamentalist. While the
original goal of the fundamentalist church movement (get
ting to understand and live out the fundamentals o
Christian belief) is quite fitting, today's connotations of the
word are not at all an accurate description of SCF. In the
.United States today, "fundamentalist Christians" are the
people that many Swatties despise. The term evokes an
image of indoctrinated Republicans that do not care abou

the environment, do not care about the poor, and are terrified of the "gay agenda." Julian connects this image to SCF
by describing the club as Swarthmore's "religious right", but
he is badly mistaken.
SCF is composed of students who come from an extremely diverse array of backgrounds, spanning many different
denominations and including people with no Christian
upbringing at all. How faith informs our political ideals is
different for everyone, so as a result we land all over the
spectrum from quite liberal to conservative and from those
disinterested in politics to the politically active.
Furthermore, there is a wide diversity of belief among
people who attend SCF events. Many of us have come to
believe in the truth of the Bible and God's plan to make
things right through Jesus Christ. Others may attend to see
if their churched past has meaning anymore, while still others come entirely as skeptics bringing with them questions
like those that Julian brought up in his column. Everyone
knows that we don't have it all sorted out. We enjoy having
-

a place, together with other students, to seek God more
deeply, to understand the Bible, and to see how it applies to
our lives.
Julian may find Christianity to be as ridiculous as belief
in "The Flying Spaghetti Monster", but perhaps that is
because he thinks it is 'accepted unquestioningly" and "has
no experiential basis." I believe that my faith is both rational and profoundly reinforced by my experience. Yet as Julian
rightly points out, it is worthy of being questioned.
Like any other, the Christian worldview should be
thoughtfully examined. Is it true? How could I know? If it
were true, what would it mean for me? For our world?
Everyone believes in things unseen and un-provable. I hope
that we as a community would continue this trajectory of
respectfully discussing such deep questions of faith, instead
of hiding our personal beliefs and outwardly surrendering to
the politically correct and contradictory position that all
things are true.

CAM raises additional class issues
This

LAUREN MENDOZA

We Need to Talk
■!■■■■■■■■■■■■■

is
November
Swarthmore's
third
annual
Class Awareness
Month. CAM is
a month when
Swarthmore students can reflect
on how their
class
social
influences their
academic experience

at

Swarthmore.
Although
for
many

students

class significantly shapes how they assimilate
to Swarthmore's rigorous academic environment, attendance to CAM events declined after
the initial year. Taking advantage of the panels
and discussions can be a valuable experience
for everyone, especially students who feel
their class influences their identity at Swat. By
digging deeper into class issues and seeking
the support offered during CAM, we can
improve the long-term support resources for
students from low socio-economic backgrounds.

Unlike race, gender or sexuality, class is
one of the less talked about pieces of a student's identity at Swarthmore. Class is often
an uncomfortable topic of discussion because
it is not necessarily a visible trait.
Swarthmore has students from various socioeconomic backgrounds, so it can be uncomfortable for a student to initiate a conversation
about how money, or the lack of it, has influenced him with someone who possibly doesn't
share the same experiences. Addressing
issues of class requires students to come out of
their class closets and share their personal
backgrounds, so many simply choose not to
bring it up.
Although class isn't a primary subject of
discussion at Swat, once a student returns
home or graduates and enters the real world,
class matters. In our contemporary capitalist
society, social advancement is on everyone's
mind. Many Swarthmore students are here to

enrich their minds, while some are also here
because it was the natural thing for them to do
since everyone in their family went to college.
But some students are here because they know
if they want to have the money to live comfortably, they need a degree to get a high paying
job. They know their family does not have the
money to support them after school. For these
working-class college students, coming to

Swarthmore can be a rough transition, especially since there are very few prominent support networks available to them, despite all the
pressure they are under to succeed. Being a
student from a low income family at Swat is
comparable to being in class limbo. On the one
hand, they can feel separated from upper class
peers who seem to have made an easy transition into the upper class academic world. On
the other hand, they can feel separated from
their former sense of self as a low income student, since they are in fact going to a highly
ranked college, a choice often associated with
being a member of the upper class. These factors make support networking and discussions
extremely useful for first generation and lower
income college students.
Many students come from a place where
they were part of the same social class as all
their friends. Many first-generation college
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are not used to the environment of a
college with a billion-dollar endowment, or
with having peers from the upper class. When
they arrive at Swarthmore, they are exposed to
challenging academics and are expected to
promptly learn challenging material, an
extremely different experience from what they

THE PHOENIX

were used to at their high schools. For example, coming from a public school where they
were expected to do most of the work on their
own, these students can initially feel apprehensive about approaching their professors or
deans, or unsure of how to adjust to constantly
having an overwhelming amount of work.
When they see how easily some of their peers
who went to private school have made the
transition to college, they can feel discouraged
if they are not making the same progress.
In an environment where class is an awkward subject, seeking support is difficult. In
order to completely dissolve class barriers in a
student's education, the college needs to
acknowledge that not all students can comfortably adjust to the college environment without
putting class out into open discussion. They
need to feel comfortable about seeking help. If
the college encouraged more student discussions year-round, if academic advisors talked
to students about class issues in the beginning

of their first year, or even if the deans
addressed class-consciousness during orientation week, it would help create a comfortable
space for students to seek the help they need.
By emphasizing that people at Swarthmore are
open to talking about class issues and are willing to offer support, the deans, faculty, and
wealthier students can help ease a low income
student's adjustment.
Swarthmore provides students many
resources to remove class related issues, such
as offering free printing in the library, free
entrance into Paces parties, meal plans and
numerous free campus events. Class issues
still come up when students discuss their
break plans, summer internships or jobs, or
even when they order take-out from the Ville.
For some students these actions do not seem
like potential stress factors, but many do not
feel comfortable telling their friends, "I can't
get this internship I really want because I have
to work in order to pay for my books," or "I
can't go home for break because I can't afford
the plane ticket." Bringing up such issues is
especially uncomfortable if it is the first time
students talk openly about class.
Class Activists, the group responsible for
hosting CAM, is one of the few groups that promotes discussion focusing on class awareness.
Unlike the numerous intercultural or gender
and sexuality resources, low income students
have few places where they can comfortably
find support networks. What can students do
when they feel helpless about adjusting to this
environment? Where can they go, and to
whom can they speak? Because there are so
few opportunities and resources for students to
address their concerns about how their class

affects their learning experience, students can
feel alienated from help. CAM is a chance for
students to find the support they need, as well
as a good way to get people talking about class
issues and to improve long-term assistance for
first generation and low-income students. In
order to see any improvements, students need
to first participate in CAM. Low-income and
first-generation students should take this
opportunity to speak up about the impact class
has on them at Swarthmore, so that it can
become a more prevalent issue on campus. At
that point these students will be able to find
the support they need to thrive here, as well as
help build support networks for future
Swatties with similar backgrounds.
CAM is a great start in raising awareness of
class issues on campus, but the College and the
students need to give more attention to class
issues like they do other prevailing issues on
campus. Until stronger support networks exist
for the working-class and low-income students
on campus, these students will continue to lack
the opportunity for an easier, more class sensitive adjustment to life at Swat.

Defending beliefs
To the Editor:
In response to Julian Chender's
column last Thursday, November 1:
First, let me thank Julian for talk-

ing to a Christian about his beliefs.
This subject is very, very politically
incorrect on campus, and I find that
very few people who are not

assume and then stew about
or
simply ignore how my beliefs might
influence my views on political,
economic, and social issues. Bravo
for asking someone about Christian
salvation theology.
However, I am not sure that
Julian placed this conversation in
the proper context. He seemed to

conflate this one aspect of salvation
which is often debated,
theology
still unclear, and does not describe
the attitude that Christians are supposed to have towards nonwith our entire belief
Christians
system. I have not been taught that
everyone who does not confess
Jesus as their savior goes to hell,
and I am what you might call a
"fundamentalist Catholic."
I have learned that Jesus is the
path to salvation—but more importantly, I have been taught that I am
not God, so I do not decide who goes
to heaven and hell. I wish Julian
had looked up the extensive passages in the Bible on the Christian
call to be humble and not judge
rather than assume that one sentence sums up an entire belief sys-

Julian goes on to suggest that
this belief system is one of those
obtained from "those creeds passed
downfrom generation to generation
that are accepted unquestioningly,
and which hold no experiential
basis." Not possible; we go to
Swarthmore. We question everything! No way would a "creed
passed down" with "no experiential
basis" go untouched.
Does Julian truly think that the
Christians on this campus don't get
into all the ethical debates that
everyone else does? If anything, it
is harder to be a Christian here
than it is to be, say, a secular
humanist, because you are faced
with more questions: how do I
think about those from other faiths?
How do I prove to people that I did-

n't just learn the Lord's Prayer and
let go of all critical thinking skills?
How do I explain to someone who
hasn't read the Bible what's in it?
How do I talk about my faith in a
secular place at all?
And if those creeds and Bible
readings hadn't held up to all those
questions, you can bet that I would
not be a Christian. Why would I
continue trying if I didn't think it
!
were right?
I hope that Julian continues to
discuss these questions. If he doesn't, he is in danger of falling into
the "fundamentalist" pit himself by
believing that refusing to believe
anything is the only way to get to

heaven.

To the Editor:

Although we respect the point of
view expressed in last week's arti-

cle, "Fundamentalism can leave little room for discussion", Mr.
Chender seems to suggest that
Christian beliefs have little or no
rational basis, an opinion prevalent among Swatties.

Our faith springs from
the constant
realization of God in
our environment.
Both of us were previously atheists due to similar assumptions
about faith. Our atheism changed
not due to brainwashing or willful
ignorance, but in the face of mounting evidence in favor of the biblical
God. While it is true that one cannot understand all of God's workings, thereby preventing a proof of
all articles of faith, in our experience, belief springs from experiential evaluation of truth claims and
the resulting implications.
While we cannot address every
challenge to faith in a short letter,
we will address two key points.
First is the idea that religion is
"accepted unquestioningly". Due to

the nature of faith, being a believer
requires the investigation and dis-

Alicia de los Reyes 'OB
cussion of notions about God and

ourselves that a naturalistic philos-

ophy precludes.
Examples include Mr. Chender's
questions on the nature of heaven
and hell, which we personally were
recently examining. Secondly, we
feel that by suggesting that there is
"no experiential basis", faith is put
to a standard to which one does not
hold other implicitly trusted val-

ues.

We rely on our textbooks
because we accept the plausibility
of the concepts that we ourselves
can perceive, and, with that indication of the author's credibility,
trust her or his expertise regarding
those phenomena beyond our experience.
Similarly, our faith springs
from the constant realization of
God in our environment and the
acceptance that we do not fully
understand God. Many articles of
faith, such as God's response to
prayer, are not scientifically
testable, but nonetheless reasonably extend other rational concepts. Furthermore, at the root of
concrete subjects such as science
and math lie axioms that we must
accept on the basis of faith.
We would invite all to attend
campus

religious

events

and

become better acquainted with students of faith and the reasons supporting their beliefs.

Swat women's soccer falls in semifinals
BY CONOR CASEY
ccasey2@swarthmore.edu

"Sometimes it's just how the
ball bounces."
Those were the words of
women's soccer head coach Todd

Anckaitis in describing the team's
frustrating Centennial Conference
semifinals match against Ursinus
College Saturday afternoon. In
that game, the Garnet played the
Bears to a 0-0 through two overtimes, but ultimately fell short in
penalty kicks, 5-3, because of one
unlucky bounce.
The first 110 minutes of the
game were fierce, with both
teams trading shots, but neither
team able to break through.
Swarthmore controlled the flow
for the better part of the game,
out-shooting the Bears 16-5, forcing Ursinus goalie Ashley Potter
to make 10 saves over the course
of the game, while Garnet goalie
Lauren Walker 'O9 only had to

make four.
"We dominated the play and
possessed the ball really well,"
Cait Mullarkey 'O9 said. "We had
some good combinations out of
our midfield. We ran them silly."

Ultimately, however, neither
team was able to find the back of
the net during regulation time, or
during the two subsequent overtime periods. Of note for their

efforts on the Garnet offensive
were Julia Luongo 'lO, Kirsten
Peterson 'll and Megan Colombo
'll, each of whom put up two shots
on goal, as well as Sarah Reese 'll,
who was responsible for three
shots on goal.

"It's hard to be

With the two teams knottedup after the second overtime
period had ended, a winner needed to advance to the following

against
Johns
University, who had won their
semifinals match earlier in the

day. Thus, the game advanced to
penalty kicks. Ursinus went

first.
Each of the two teams scored
on their first two attempts. Then
the third Ursinus kicker stepped
up, and drove the ball off the
crossbar, where it bounced to the
ground, and had enough spin on it
to bounce across the goal line.
The Bears had notched their third
point in three tries. It was up to

Midfielder
DeLorme 'lO stepped up for the
Garnet and delivered a searing
shot that ricocheted off the crossbar, and like the Ursinus shot just
before it, bounced directly down
to the ground, but this time spun
in the opposite direction, away
from the goal. Swarthmore was
down 3-2 because of an unlucky
bounce. The Garnet made its next
shot, but because the Bears made
each of their next two,
Swarthmore's fifth and final shot
was not necessary.

Delaware county to construct MLS stadium
BY ROSARIO PAZ

Two months ago, negotiations began between Delaware
County

officials and investors of a Major League Soccer fran-

chise concerning a new 20,000 seat pro-soccer stadium to be
constructed on the Chester waterfront as soon as 2010. The
$155 million complex will be funded by a $3O million investment on the part of Delaware County, in addition to privately-raised funds and supplemental capital funds from the state

government.
According to Andrew Reilly, Chairman of the Delaware

The host agreement is the consensus between the

recent negotiations between the Delaware county officials
and the MLS franchise investors, in which the officials made

One objective was to increase access to the Chester waterfront for Delaware County and Chester city residents.
According to Reilly, the stadium is predicted to bring in $4OO

built to be an anchor for positive development," Reilly said.
"It's going to spur other economic development in the city of
Chester. We wanted something compatible with a soccer stadium, such as retail and office buildings and town homes
There's [also] going to be a marina constructed there."
Conversely, despite the estimated revenue towards city
economic development, Mayor of Swarthmore Elric Gerner
has expressed ambivalence towards the stadium initiative
and doubts whether it is the most reasonable spending of
such an exorbitant amount offunds.
"If somebody said to me they were going to give me 30 million dollars to help Chester, I would say that building a soccer stadium wouldn't be on the list... and I am saying this
within the context of being a super duper sports fan,"Gerner
said. "[On] the flip side of this the folks who are in charge
are trying to do something that they believe is going to be
constructive. They feel this is going to be something that is
going to be an economic benefit."
Another objective of the project was to ensure the security of the county's investment. The $3O million dollar investment provided by Delaware County was to be used by the
sports authority of the region towards the purchase and
development of the land on which the stadium is to be built
and for the stadium itself. The investment is coming from
economic development gaming funds from casino hotels in
the region, including Harrah's Casino Hotels.
Delaware County gets a certain percentage of gaming
funds that must be used towards economic development,
which totals $2 million per year, according to Reilly. The
third objective was to create a sports authority to issue $3O
...

....

million in bonds towards the construction of the stadium.
"No county tax dollars are going to be used for this project,"
Reilly said. "The project is going to be wholly funded by gaming revenue that must be used for gaming development."
Eric Wagner, headcoach of the Swarthmore men's soccer
team, speculated that "these investors said, 'This is going to
be a huge tourist attraction and if we kind of tag team and
build our stadium at the new time they build their slots and
venues, it would be an enormous potential draw for professional sports and gambling in the same area.' The development that has been going on down there has been a hot topic
between the developers and the legislators."

"[The stadium] is going to spur other
economic development in the city of
Chester."
Andrew Reilly
Delaware
Chairman,
County Council
Despite the assured belief that the stadium initiative will
undoubtedly prove beneficial to the city of Chester,
Economics Professor John P. Caskey, whose primary
research interests and expertise lie in financial and urban
economics, argues that the number of games and the number
and quality of burgeoning businesses in the surrounding
area, particularly restaurants, have important impacts on
the successes of professional sport initiatives.
"Generally, when a city thinks about a stadium, the ones
[include]
that are viewed as most beneficial by economists
Camden Yards in Baltimore Because it is a baseball stadium,
people come frequently and it is surrounded by restaurants
and other amenities that the fans tend to use."
According to Reilly, the last objective was to ensure that
the MLS franchise would maintain an active presence in the
community. "They've already taken big steps in that regard.
They're committed to being a really big benefit to the
Delaware County and the Chester community," he said.
Additionally, Governor Edward Rendell has supported
the stadium initiative and is proposing to allocate additional
capital funds towards its construction. "Governor Rendell
has given his stamp of approval," Wagner said.
Ultimately, the building of the new stadium would be an
initiative to further promote the investors' MLS franchise.
Although MLS has been around for almost 11 years,
Philadelphia has yet to establish a franchise within the
league. With the development of the new stadium, MLS will
be looking to add two new teams within the coming years.
"One, for certain, will be added one year from now. It
might start playing in 2008 but it might not. That is going to
be decided before Christmas," Reilly said.
Though the additions seem certain, MLS is still in the
early development stages offranchise expansion. "We continue to be interested in Philadelphia as a potential MLS expansion market, and discussions are ongoing. At this time, we
will refrain from commenting on any specific developments
in the process," MLS President MarkAbbott said in an e-mail.
....

There are clear indications that the development of the
Chester soccer stadium is underway. According to Bryan
James, President of Sons of Ben, a supportive 890-member
fan club base for a Philadelphia-based soccer team that does
not yet exist, there was a press conference concerning the stadium on Oct. 22 in which Delaware County politicians and
stadium and franchise investors discussed the possibility of
the stadium being built by 2010.
Investors are not the only ones interested in generating
an MLS franchise in the Chester area. According to Wagner,
Sons of Ben has recently been petitioning in support of the
prospective Chester stadium. Because only teams with 'a
plan for a soccer-specific stadium" can be approved by the
MLS, Sons of Ben, in hopes of being given an expansion team
to root for, has given strong approval to the plans for a new
soccer stadium in their area.
"We started in January this year and tried to get some
members to start a supporter's club," James said. "Hopefully,
we'll be supporting a real team soon."
The tenacious no-team fan club has begun petitioning the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives. It has made its petition available on its Web site and has collected nearly 3,500
signatures, in addition to 300 on paper. "We started the petition a month and a half ago, at the end of September Just
to show the number of people in this area that were interested in [MLS] and watching a game in their own backyard
rather than having to travel..." James said.
According to their Web site, the petition is made up of
three articles stating the stadium's purpose as a venue for
shows, performances and high school and college soccer
games, its predicted economic benefits for the currently
underachieving waterfront and its commitment towards
Olympic-related initiatives and events. Their slogan is
"We've got the fans. We've got the city. We just need a team!"
Both excitement and concern is being raised by the stadium initiative on all sides of government, soccer fans'and the
...

college community.
"I just want to make sure if I was involved with [the soccer stadium initiative], the people of Chester would not be
left holding the empty bag," Mayor Gerner said. "I would
want to make sure that they could reap some benefit from

that."
"That's not to say this is bad for Chester," Caskey said.
"Chester is probably going to get some tax revenue and jobs
from it but they're also going to get a lot of traffic in there.
This could be both good and bad
Some of the people driving to and from the stadium might stop. This might give
Chester the opportunity to develop a restaurant sector that
begins to make the place more appealing and brings in more
tax revenue and jobs."
"There's a whole lot going on right now with regards to
an expansion of the MLS," Wagner said. "Bottom line is that
I think this would be fantastic in this region. We're the
biggest region in this country that doesn't have a soccer stadium in our area."
Currently, negotiations between Delaware County officials the stadium investors are still in progress. Exact
....

details about the stadium and the prospective expansion
teams are undisclosed by MLS and the Sons of Ben stadium
petition continues to ask for more supporters' signatures.

Evil Buzzards fall to Haverford to close out season
BY ZHENG ZHENG

zzhengl@swarthmore.edu

On Saturday, Nov. 3, the Evil Buzzards
competed against their archrival, the
Haverford College men's rugby team. It was
an infinitely picturesque and especially
breezy autumn afternoon, with celestial
dashes of white clouds drifting across a brilliantly lit sapphire sky. The men's rugby
team stormed across the field pluckily, passionately
with enough fuel and momentum to make the earth quaver beneath their
feet. A Swarthmore alum, who came all the
way from Florida to watch the game, called
it a "terrific competition between two major
academic powerhouses."
Alas, after two intense sessions of running, thumping, bumping, shoving, jostling,
wrestling and at times all-out, full-contact
bodily collisions, the Evil Buzzards fell to
Haverford 24-12. Scott Bird, a Buzzards member from Newmann

THE

PHOENIX

College,

and Malcolm

Thomas 10 each scored five points for the
team with their tries, while co-captain Pauly
lezzi 'O9, also fromNewmann College, scored
two points with his conversion kick. Tries
are achieved by grounding the ball over the
goal line at the rival's end offield and goals
are scored when the ball is kicked over the
crossbar between the goalposts.
The team played an excellent game during the first half, but was faced with less auspicious circumstances during the second
halfof the game. "We gave 120 percent to the
game," lezzi said. "But the problem was that
we had a rather inexperienced referee who
basically didn't know what he was doing
half of the time. Our forwards outplayed
[Haverford's] forwards. Our backs ran really
hard ... though we did make some mistakes
which [ultimately] led to this unfortunate
score."
Many other players agreed that the
Haverford team just got lucky this time.
Rugby alum Nick Farrar 'O7 added, "We

have a relatively young team with relatively
few seniors and a lot of carryovers from last
year's freshmen rugby players, but everyone put in a good effort."
Brendan Work 10 said that the team's
"strong unity and familiarity with each
other" allowed them to play responsively
and communicate well on the field.
Developing close rapport and a strong sense
of camaraderie with fellow team members
are integral components ofplaying any team
sport. Long hours of practice three times a
week would naturally contribute to the formation of strong interpersonal bonds
between the players.
Joel Tolliver 10 expressed his passion for
the sport and sentiments for the team succinctly when he said, "The fall season was
fun. I love these guys!"

Although the rugby season was already
over, this non-league game was the last one
that the team would play this fall. Thomas

admitted that it was indeed a rather

November 8, 2007

"tough

way to end the season." Nevertheless, the
loss will function as a powerful incentive for
further improvements. "We need to work on
you know,
conditioning over the winter
getting all buffed up in preparation for the
spring," Bird said.

Besides doing plenty of weight training
and running throughout the winter months,
the players may also spice things up with
some Greco-Roman wrestling, as suggested
by Ryan "D-Town" Walker 'lO. With its combination of cardiovascular and anaerobic
strength training, the men's rugby team will
undoubtedly be able to spring into next season with confidence and a fully revitalized
spirit. This time, Haverford might have gotten lucky. But evidently, it takes more than
pure luck to win a match. And the Evil
Buzzards will not leave anything to chance
come this spring.

The numbers,
they confuse me

j«I

y*

»

No one's ever accused
me of being a real whiz
with numbers. Growing up
to be a great statistician
was never really one of my
life goals. Maybe this is the
reason why I constantly
want to slam my head on a
table whenever I see some
of the stats on TV when I
watch sports. I mean, sure,
I like to know some of the
numbers game, and things
generally look really dramatic when a large number
is juxtaposed next to a
KEVIN FRIEDENBERG
small number. Yet, aside
from some of the generic
Get Down With
stats that you see on TV,
Your Bad Self
many of the things the
broadcasters show in those
sexy little graphics mean
less to me than most of Heidi Montag and Spencer's dialogue
on "The Hills." Do the guys sitting in the booth really have
nothing at all to talk about that they need to drivel on and on
about how one player does in some obscure condition? Also,
how do these fools even come up with some of this garbage?
Maybe they have a crew of joker interns from schools like
Swarthmore frantically trying to impress the Man by
researching the most insane little tidbits known to man.
Granted, some of the stuff is cool. I mean, when I see that
Navy hasn't beaten Notre Dame in a football game in 43 years, it
makes me appreciate its win on Saturday even more. I find the
worst cases of this ridiculous numbers mumbo jumbo in baseball, where almost anything a player does can be calculated into
some statistic. Sure I care what Manny Ramirez's batting average is with runners in scoring position, but what I really don't
care about is, say, Manny's batting average with runners in scoring position when the right fielder scratches his ass on the pitch.
Maybe I was curious how many times Coco Crisp strikes out
when he sees JoshBeckett throw in a monster lip of Skoal before
the inning. Sure I'm exaggerating here, but I literally could not
believe my ears when the ALCS sportscasters, JoeBuck and Tim
McCarver, made some comment regarding the likelihood of a
multi-run inning when the first batter hits a homerun instead of
drawing a walk. No freakin' way: are these clowns serious? If my
year and a half at this school has taught me anything about logic,
I think I can piece that stat together.
The Boston Globe even has someone dubbed "The Maniacal
One" who calculates some truly out-of-this-world statistics
about the Red Sox. Here is one example from the Sox midseason report: "Opponents are batting only .200 against Boston
with two outs and runners in scoring position." Oh thank God!
All we need to do is get two outs then walk a few batters and
we'll be in great shape! Honestly, who has the time to figure
out stuff like that? That really grinds my gears. The sheer
effort and meticulousness that must go into figuring a stat like
that out must be off the charts. It takes a real specific type of
person to undertake such a Herculean task. Here's a guess
I'm willing to bet that the Red Sox win more than 50 percent of
their games when their starting pitcher lasts longer than the
other team's pitcher (actually they went 41-5 at the midpoint).
Seems pretty self-explanatory, no? Thank God the bullpen didn't suck or else this stat would really be nuts.
Maybe I just don't appreciate the plethora of knowledge
that sportscasters have, or the effort that a production crew
undergoes to dig up something as historic as the last time a
player in the NFL used a drop kick to score (first in 65 years
by the Patriots' Doug Flutie in 2006, a real BC product). Stats
like that are pretty cool and impress me to no end. John
Madden repeatedly asking us to take a look at the time-out
chart (neither team had any) in the final few minutes o:
Superbowl XXXVI, not so much. I guess as long as sports wil
continue to exist then so will extreme stats, not just the coo
ones, but the really, really useless and ludicrous ones. I just
hope that the next time I watch any baseball on FOX I don't
feel like Jessica Simpson trying to do multiplication tables
Wait, those things are actually hard.

Tide drowns Terror, looks to F&M
BY GENEVRA PITTMAN

gpittmal@swarthmore.edu

A few talented new faces appeared last weekend
and veterans picked up where they left off as the
Swarthmore men's and women's swim teams both
defeated squads from McDaniel College at the Green

Terror's home pool. The meet opened a tough
Centennial Conference schedule, which kicks into
full gear against conference rival Franklin and
Marshall College this Saturday.
The men defeated the Green Terror 56-30 and the
women prevailed 58-33, with the races officially turning into exhibition and not contributing to the scoring after the Swarthmore team recorded enough
points to clinch the meet.
After the leading Swarthmore women's team was
disqualified from the opening relay and the men's
teams faced no competition after a McDaniel disqualification, the Garnet earned points quickly from
swimmers across the boards, as both the men's and
women's teams gained victories in the first three
individual events. The women's 1000 yard Freestyle
was a display of fresh blood, as Allison Bishop 'll
(11:23.70) and Sarah Bedolfe 'll (12:05.24) took first
and second in the event, while senior captains
Andrew Frampton (10:29.69) and John Heagy (11:02.61)
got early points for the men. Julia Wrobel 'lO (2:04.97)
and Franny Zhang 'OB took the top two places in the
women's 200 Freestyle, and Stephen Shymon 'O9 won
the men's side with a time of 1:52.66. The 50 Freestyle
was also a show of domination for Swarthmore, as

Jennie Lewis 'OB (26.07) and Claire Shelden 'lO (26.76)
went 1-2 for the women, and Michael Ahn 'lO (22.77)
and Sterling Satterfield 'll filled the same spots for
the men.
After McDaniel took both the 200 IM events,
Swarthmore's powerful butterfly duo of Anne Miller
'lO and Casey Osborn 'lO put any question of a
momentum shift to rest as they both broke the pool
record in the 100 Butterfly with times of 59.91 and
1:00.65, respectively. Their closest competition,
McDaniel's Whitney Scheiren, was almost six seconds behind Osborn. Brian Roth 'O9 followed up the
women's success with a victory of his own in the 100
Butterfly in 54.94. Swarthmore's lead persisted as the
Garnet recorded the top time in all but one of the
remaining events. Victories came from Wrobel again
(57.90) and Doug Gilchrist-Scott 'O9 (50.08) in the 100

November 8, 2007

Freestyle, Allie Jordan 'O9 (1:05.46) and Guy Seaton
'lO (1:02.03) in the 100 Back, Bishop (5:40.02) and
Shymon (5:01.45) in the 500 Freestyle and Stephanie
Su 'll (1:15.83) in the 100 Breaststroke. Satterfield's
1:02.23 in the men's 100 Breaststroke was topped by
McDaniel star Chris Reed, who finished in 1:0L03.
Though theresults were not part of the final scoring,
Swarthmore also took both of the final 200 Freestyle
relays, with a team of Melinda Neal 'll, Shelden,
Wrobel and Zhang swimming a combined 1:4816 to
win the women's race and Heagy, Tom Kelleher 'O9,
Roth and Gilchrist-Scott teaming up to take the men's
in 1:3211.
The wins bring the Swarthmore women's overall
record to 2-0 and the men's to 1-1, after both team's
faced off against tough competition against Widener
College last Thursday. The women won that meet,
132.5-68.6, while the men fell 109-96.
Swarthmore will need all the momentum it can
take from the win over the Green Terror going into
Saturday's meet at F&M, a perennial powerhouse in
the conference known for its incredibly loud and spirited fans. While coach Sue Davis acknowledges that
the loss of the class of 2007 is a big blow, she remains
positive. "On the whole they're swimming very, very
well for this time of year," she said of the teams. "The
new incoming class is getting faster by the week."
Frampton echoed Davis' thoughts about the firstyears. "The freshmen this year are like an injection
of 1000 cc's of awesome into the heart of the team,"
...

he said.

Jordan has faith in this season's group of women,
both for this upcoming weekend and in the long run.
"F&M is just going to be an intense meet," she said.
"It's going to come down to who wants it more."
Jordan said that the team has been participating in
lots of psych-up activities this week to get everyone's
spirit up for the meet, and both teams are being motivated by a little bit of history too. "F&M has never
beat us in our pool and we have never beat them in
their pool," Jordan said. "This is the first year in
Swarthmore history that we have a shot of beating
them in their pool
They want to keep that streak
and we're ready to break it."
Osborn agreed that both the men's and women's
teams are ready for the challenge. "We have a really
...

tough meet ahead of us against F&M," she said, "but
our strength really lies in our teamwork and if we
can capitalize on that, we can beat them."
