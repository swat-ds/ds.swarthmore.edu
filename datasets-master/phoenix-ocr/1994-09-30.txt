1988 Presidential Candidate Returns to His Alma Mater for a Day

By Tamar Charry

Michael Dukakis '55,Swarthmore
alumnus, former Massachusetts governor,

and former presidential candi-

date, will return to the College com-

munity on Monday, October 3. He
will meet with students in small
groups and will later address the entire community with a speech entitled"Healthcare Reform: Where Do
We Go fromHere?" at 7:30 pm in the
Lang Performing Arts Center. This
speech will constitute the first allschool Collection of the year.
Anticipating Dukakis' visit, President Al Bloom reflected that it is
"wonderful to have an alumnus come
back to campus who so represents the
highest ideals of a Swarthmore education—of putting acute intelligence
and ethical concern into action for a
better world."
This event is the third all-school
Collection in recent years, which was
firstrevived withcomedian/actorBill
Cosby in 1992,and environmentalist
Bill McKibbon in 1993. The Collection, which emerged from the
college's Quaker roots, required students to attend a lecture and meeting
once a week. Registrar Jane Mullins,
'5O, recalls that "it was...mandatory,
with people taking attendance, and
penalties for taking more than two
cuts a semester."
Attitudes toward it were mixed.

which case, "one read the NY Times,
Herald Tribune, anovel, knitted, ...did
tetting or needle point, [or] slept,"
according to Mullins. It was also unpopular, she says, with those "who
didn'tlike being told whatto do."The
tradition was discontinued when the
college became too large for the entire studentbody to fit into one place,
and because student opinion was
negative.
Now, however, several sources,
including a subgroup of the College
Planning Committee and Student
Council, have suggested that it be
brought back in its current non-mandatory form. Barbara Ryan, '59, Associate Vice President for External
Affairs, welcomes its revival. "Despite the mandatory aspect," she said,
"there was a spirit of community
bonding, an all-college experience,
that came from the [Collection]."
The college is pleased to welcome
Dukakis as the speaker for this, the
third of a new breed of all-school
Collections. Dukakis, who graduated
Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 with adegree
in Political Science, has taught since
1991 at Northeastern University in
Boston, at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, and acted as a
critic and political expert on health
care reform. He has also taught at the
John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

Flag Referendum Results
On Monday, September 26, Mat-

thew Schenk '95 organized a referendum on whether or not to have the

American flag raised aboveParrish.
Last year, some members of the
community expressed concern that
the flag was to be raised without
first gauging student opinion on the
issue. 615 students cast their votes
at Sharpies dining hall during lunch

and dinner; 376, or 61%, voted in
favor of raising the flag, whereas
239, or 39% were against it
In response, the S w arthmoreCivil
Liberties Society sponsored an alternative vote. Students were asked
to answer the question, "Would the
Constitution and Amendments be a
more appropriate symbol to fly over
Parrish?" A total of 157 students
responded, 103 in favor, and 54 opposed. Kevin Keenan '95, leader of
the Civil Liberties Society, notes
thatthis proportionprobably reflects
the fact that those in favor of this
plan were more apt to vote than
those opposed, who may have been
more interested in the other vote.

The flag is now flying on top of
Parrish.

When he arrived at Swarthmore
as a first-year student, he had only
been outside of New England once
before, and "wasn't quite sure what
a Quaker was." But he soon realized
that he was "very much a smallcollege guy, in the sense that ideally, that kind of atmosphere is the
best...for undergraduates."
"It was just a terrific experience.
I had a great time. I learned a lot, I
did a lot." He especially enjoyed the
seminar format of the Honors program and the opportunities for domestic and foreign exchange. The
time he spent in Peru and at American University in Washington, D.C.
were important in the development
of his political awareness.
More importantly, however, he
stresses the effect that the period's
political events had on him. He was
in college during the McCarthy era,
which was "a tough, tough time,
politically," during which the entire
country labored with issues of the
"Red Scare" and segregation. As
examples, he noted that the barber
shop in the 'Ville refused to cut the
hair of Black students, and schools
in Delaware and Maryland were still
segregated. These events formed the
context within which Dukakis first
embraced politics: "In a way.. .1made
the decision while I was at

Swarthmore that at some point I
would run for political office."

Michael Dukakis '55, who claims that "ha wasn't quite sun what a Quaker
was" when he first came to Swarthmore, Is returning to campus on
Monday, October 3 to preside over this year's first Collection, an allcampus meeting based on Quaker traditions.

The political activities in which he

took part enabled him to realize his
strengths. He was involved in campaigns in Philadelphia, the campaign
of one ofhis Political Science professors for county commissioner, and a
membership drive for the American

Civil Liberties Union, in which he
"signed up a third of the entire campus." He added, "since I almost

Swat Places Germany under a Magnifying
Glass at Cooper Symposium this Weekend
By Cathy Glasheen

This weekend, Swarthmore will
be hosting a symposium entitled "Re/
Visions: Memory, Identity, History,
and the New Germany" in the Cinema of LP AC. The symposium will
begin with the showing of the movie
Deutschland, bleiche Mutter {Germany, Pale Mother) on Friday, September 30 at 8:00 pm. On Sati
day, October 1 at 9:30 am t
panel of experts will discuss
the topic of Germany's
struggle to define its role in
the European and world 1
communities in light of its li
turbulent history and present II
situation several years after
reunification.
Hans-Jakob Werlen, Professor of German and an organizer of the symposium, said that
since the presentation content was
left to the panelists' discretionwithin
the bounds of the symposium title, it
is still uncertain which issues will be
most prominent. He thinks that topics may include the upcoming election on October 16, in which German
citizens will decide whether or not to
re-elect Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the
effect of the neo-Nazi movement on
Germany's political climate, Gerrelations,
man-Jewish
and
multicultural issues in Germany resulting from the entry of members of
different ethnic groups from former
Eastern Bloc countries. Because the
four have different areas of expertise
about thenation and its institutions, it
is expected that various viewpoints
will be represented.
Panelist James Kurth is a Professor of Political Science at
Swarthmore. Joining him is Claudia
Koonz, Professor of History at Duke
University and author of the book
Mothers in the Fatherland. Also on
the panel are Henrykßroder, apolitical essayist and journalist from Ber-

lin, and Rafael Seligmann, a write
from Munich, both of whom are ex
perts in German/Jewish relations.
A question and answer period wi]
follow the panelists' prepared re
marks. This should last until abou
noon. The audience will be invited to
engage any member of the panel.
Friday's film, Deutschland, bleiche
Mutter, was made in Germany in
1980 and was directed by

Professor of German
states that the movie's title
'is a quote from a poem by
Bertholt Brecht, and the
movie follows that quote by explor
ing connections between family his
tory and national history, war anc
peace, men and women. It is a very
powerful and provocative film, wit
some troubling moments, blending

realism with a poetic use of newsreel footage from the period of the
war."
"Re/Visions" will be thethird German Symposium held at
Swarthmore. "Germany, Incorporated" was held in Spring of 1990
and focused on Germany's role after
the fall of the Iron Curtain. "Der
Zeitgeist 1993 Reflections on Germany after the Wall" took place in
Spring, 1993.
The German Symposium is open
to all members of the Swarthmore
community and will be conducted
in English. Werlen hopes that it will
be well attented by those who have
an interest in German affairs and
that the "qualified experts can give
[the audience] an individual picture
of Germany that might be less monolithic than what [is presented by] the
American mass media."
The GermanSymposium is sponsored by the William J.CooperFoundation, the German Academic Exchange Service, the Program in German Studies, and the Departments
of History and Political Science.

New Building Will
Bring Innovations,
Facilities For All

By Tamar Charry
Parrish Annex has been torn down
and there is now massive construction work underway where it once
stood. Everyone knows that What
many may not know, however, is that
the building which will soon rise in
its place will be an innovative facility
tailored to the needs of the College
community.

The new academic building, which
as yet remains unnamed and is generally referred to as the N.A.8., will

house the departments of Economics, Sociology and Anthropology, and
Modem Languages and Literature.

Its highlights will include a spacious
lounge area with a refreshment facility (tentatively planned as an
espresso bar), a glass-walled lecture
hall, an "outdoor classroom" and gardens, a turret (yes, a turret), and a
walkway running from Parrish to
North Campus. It will also have individualized seminar rooms, an improved language lab, and new classrooms and offices.
The building will be built using
rocks from the same quarry as those
used in the construction of Parrish.
Furthermore, "the building will be
constructed such that the dome of
Parrish will be visible above it, looking at it from DuPont," reports President Al Bloom. In this way, the two
buildings, built over one hundred
years apart, will resemble one another.
The first floor will be the more
recreational section of the building,
while the upper two levels will be
more classroom oriented. The "Forum" on the first floor is planned as a
lecture hall which will combine aesthetic pleasure with the utility of,
say, a DuPont lecture hall. The front
wall of the hall will be constructed of
opaque glass, which will flood the
room with light while maintaining a
closed feeling. Beyond this wall will
be a walkway lined with pine trees,
leading from Parrish to the North
Campus stairway to Martin. This is
currently known as the green-fencelined walkway beside the PAC.
Bloom hopes that this area will have
an ambiance much like the oak-lined
Magill Walk.
Another aspect of the first floor
will be the "North Campus Commons," an area in which "students
and faculty members will be able to
sit together and have a cup of coffee
[cappuccino?] between classes," according to Harry Gotwals, VicePresident in charge of Alumni, Development, and Public Relations. It is
planned as a leisure space to supple-

ment Tarble, with the advantage of
proximity to other academic buildings. The first floor will also contain
the Franklin Mint Credit Union office, a faculty lounge, and classrooms.
A one-story walkway will cut
through the first floor and lead from
North Campus to Parrish. There has
been talk of mosaic tiling here, but
the decor, like other details, is as yet
undecided. "There is a lot ofcreativity going into the design of this building," said Gotwals, "That's what
makes it fun." Indeed, the plans continueto change. Thatmeans that some
of the aspects mentionedhere, though
accurate today, may not ultimately
exist in the building.
Perhaps the mostrefreshing aspect
of the ground level will actually lie
outside its walls. This will consist of
the "outdoor classroom" and gardens
in thespace formally occupied by the
Annex. It will include a courtyard
and walls from the Annex, reconstructed toresemble an open-air room,
in which classes may be held
(weather-permitting, of course). Window and door holes will be left intact,
so that the more adventuresome
among us may partake of their lofty
position.
The second and third floors will
have a more academic feeling. Department offices will neighbor class
and seminar rooms, some of which
will be designated for specific departments. These rooms could also
be reserved as meeting places for
juniors and seniors of the major to
meet. Some seminar rooms will be
located in a"turret" at the southwest
corner of thebuilding. The rooms in
this section will be variously shaped,
yet together will constitute a towerlike structure.
The third floor will contain a new
language lab, replacing the one that's
currently squeezed into the bottom
corner of Martin. The lab will be
wired to a satellite dish on the roof
which will enable students to undertake language study on an international scale. The prospect of our very
own satellite dish raises other possibilities; we may have international
conferences in all sorts of fields, or
more sophisticated telnet communication with students on foreign ex-

change.

These are just some of the projections for the building, which will
open for the Fall 1996 semester and
thus not be enjoyed by members of
the current junior and senior classes.
It will change the face of the campus
and provide Swarthmore with facilities and services from which everyone can benefit.

Boycott Honors Lite
By Eugene Sonn

The new Honors Program has
good points, but in an attempt
to attract more students, the Council
on Educational Policy Task Force
has taken away the most important
aspect of honors: no grades.
According to Provost Jennie
Keith's all-campus memo, the task
force suggested grading all seminar
work in order to assist students in
getting into graduate school. Where
did they get this idea? From Honors
students who did not get into the
graduate or professional schools they
wanted. But what about those who
did get into the best law, medical and
graduate schools? It seems those students complaining they did not get
into Harvard Law School should look
to their academic record, not the
Honors program, for a scapegoat. We
have no proof that these discontented
students would have been admitted
to their graduate schoolofchoicehad
they received grades for their seminars. The suspicion that they might
have is not enough to warrant changing the program.
Apparently, the task force did not
consider that by grading all seminar
work, there is little incentive to go
through the harrowing process of
Honors exams at the end of Senior
year.
Let's weigh the pro's and con's of
going Honors in the new program.
On the pro side, you have the possibility of having "honors," "high honors" or "highest honors" on your diploma, the more in-depth, intense

having discussed the matter withother
Honors students, I have not found a
single one who is excited about the
exams. Most of us think of them as a
good thing we're forced to do to
compensate for going Honors.
Now, let's look at the con's. Why
would students be chased away from
the new Honors program? Seminars
will be much different. For years,
professors have worried that grading
students on their work would spoil

By Kevin Keenan

It is a belief, largely unique to
America, that we can instill respect
for life by extinguishing it. Executing a capital criminal shows the rest
of society, the argument goes, that
we will not tolerate the taking of
lives. Implied in this logic are, one,
that the death penalty has some sort
of deterrent effect, and, two, that our
society derives either utility or satisfaction from retribution.
The deterrence argument seems
plausible
you would not kill a
person if you knew you yourself
but factual eviwould be killed
dence does not support it. Deathpenalty states have almost exactly
the same averageannual rate ofcriminal homicides (7.5 vs. 7.4 per 100,000
people) as abolition states. Since
Canada abolished the death penalty
and more strictly controlled handguns, their homicide rate has de-

creased. It is safe to assume that
murderers who act in a heat of passion do not stop to consider that they
might get the chair. Premeditated
murder is usually planned to include
evasionof punishment altogether.
As for utility, society is just as safe
if the murderer is locked behind bars
for his entire life with no chance of
parole. Many would find that locking a person in a 6 foot by 6 foot cell
for eternity was adequate retribution.
For others, the death penalty is more
inhumane than any crime. Equal
retribution through the death penalty, according to Albert Camus,
would only be achieved when punishing "a criminal while death on
him and, who, from that would find
that placing somehow had warned
his victimof the date he wouldinflict
a horrible death on him and, who,
from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months."
But, for those who want real retribution, perhaps our state could begin to

rape, then kill rape-murderers. For
multiple murders, we couldkill them,

then kill them again.
Retribution is a silly argument in
favor of the death penalty. Murder is
a horrible thing, yet no one feels that
every murderer should himself be
murdered. In fact, only 1% ofcapital
criminals receive death sentences,and
overwhelming evidence shows that
this one percent is not determined by
therelative severity of their crime.
Who are the lucky 1% which our
society chooses for the most severe
sanction? 80% of all studies on the
death penalty show that race is the
single greatest determinantofwhether
a person gets a sentence of death or a
lesser sentence. More specifically,
84% of the criminals executed since
1976 were charged withkilling a white
person. Murderers of black victims
represent only 13% of those executed.
Most shocking of all, there has been
only one execution of a white man
whose victim was black since 1976.
Finally, the death penalty unfairly
discriminates against those with less
money. 90% of defendants eventually sentencedto deathwere unable to
hire an attorney at the time of their
trial. The question. Do you know of
an affluent person who has ever been
executed?, is not a research topic.
Money decides your fate in our legal
system. In capital cases, it decides
whether or not you are one of those
who "deserves to die."
Randall Dale Adams, the subject
of tonight's film The Thin Blue Line
(9:30, Martin), spent more than three
years on death row for a crime he did
not commit. If there had been no in
depth exploration by a vanguard director, he would have probably been
killed by the state. His is one ofmany
cases of mistaken justice. Justice,
that when followed through to the
execution chamber, can never be corrected.

Hate Speech: Same Pattern, New Targets
&

Betsy

Everyone knows by now that the
vaunted S warthmore traditionofhate
speech has continued unimpeded in
this new school year: are we all
salivating for details yet? Last Monday, someone defaced the bulletin
board for the Lesbian, Bisexual, and
Gay Alliance. "Cunt" was scrawled
under the name of the female
LBGA intern and "pickle stuffer" under the name of the male intern.
There is an interestingdiscrepancy
between these two terms. "Cunt"
popularly signifies misogynistic distaste and makes no overt comment
about same-sex desire (as if the horrible abyss that is the vagina is grotesque enough to leave unspoken the
homophobia implied by its context
on the LBGA board). "Pickle stuffer,"
on the other hand, is a slightly more
obscure term, possibly regional or
arcane (we couldn't find it in the
OED, so its etymological roots remain unclear). However juvenile and
surrealistically metaphoric, it obviously renters around the silent center

Goldman Sachs, an equal opportunity employer, does not discriminate in employment on any basis that is prohibited by tederal, stale or local law.

Last week Brian Schwartz wrote a
well-meaning if vague opinion piece
on the COBE (Cosmic Background
Explorer satellite) project. John
Mather, a Swarthmore alumnus, is
using the satellite to explore the origins of the universe.
Mr. Schwartz states, as far as I can
establish, that the project is unpractical and that economic factors should
decide whether a project is worthy.
He is suggesting that space science
and other profitless work is a waste.
What a typical response in this postmodem age!
In this day and age, everything has
turned into a commodity. Modern
societies stand only for their economic abilities. Determination and
ambition have been replaced with
suchbuzzwords as accessible, small,
mobile, quick turn around, short term,
and tactical research. Mr. Schwartz,
when he offershis ideaof (again, this
is the bestI can understand it) moneyfor-informauon, cannot help but have
his ideas; heknows no other way but
the post-modem one.
Some vision is required when
thinking in the world-wide scale.Simply suggesting a free marketeconomy
ofinformation is not exactly a global
solution. How can scientific knowledge be traded as a good? Who decides if it is free? Who gets it? The
needy, or those who can pay for it?
The answers are not as simple as Mr.
Schwartz would have us believe.
Mr. Schwartz suffers from the common misconception that there is little
value in space science or anything
that does not immediately gratify the
"people." He forgets that the fruitless
work done in the 60's and 70's in
terms of space science has paid off in
the formofcommunication satellites,
weather satellites, and navigation
satellites, all of which "clothe and
feed the people of the earth."
So, I call to all those Mr .Schwartzes
out there: reconsider your positions
for a second with open minds. Space
science and other research with no
immediate gratification for the taxpayer may not be as useless as you
assume. It may even reveal andrevel
in the origins of the universe.

According to Penn Courts, No Just Doesn't Mean No
By Abby Swingen
Why doesn't no mean no in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?
On May 27 of this year, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled
that a victim's saying "no" to a potential sexual assaulter isn't enough
to make the events that ensue a rape.
In its decision, the Court overturned
the rape conviction of Robert
Berkowitz by stating thathis victim's
"...testimony is devoid of any statement which clearly or adequately
describes the use offorce or thethreat
offorce against her." In addition, the
Court's ruling makes it more difficult to prove that a crime has been
committed because it states the victim must show that s/he attempted to'
escape or used some sort of force
against the assaulter. In other words,
victims in Pennsylvania must show
evidence that they were physically
harmed or that physical harm was
imminent for a crime to have been
committed. Emotional or psychological damage alone is no longer sufficient in the eyes ofthe Supreme Court.
The decision in Commonwealth v.

Berkowitz is a huge setback for all
victims of sexual assault because it
adds even more ambiguities to an
issue that is hardly black and white.
The specifics of the case are as follows: a female college student was
waiting for her boyfriend in a dorm
lounge; when he
didn't show up, she
went to a friend's
room. The friend's
roommate,

Berkowitz, was in
bed when she came
in. He asked her to sit
on the bed with him.
She refused and instead sat on thefloor.
Berkowitz
then
locked the door and
began to remove her
clothes. He placed her
on the bed and

quickly penetrated
her. In court testi-

mony the victim states that she repeatedly said "no" and other phrases
that made it clear that she did not
want this to happen to her.

In the original court case, a jury
agreed that the evidence was enough

that she ran out of the room

crying
and reported the incident immedito convict RobertBerkowitz ofrape;
ately after it occurred. Berkowitz's
however, the Supreme Court overconviction of the ambiguous crime
turned the conviction because the of "indecent assault" was not overvictim offered "no physical resis- turned, though, because "...the crime
of indecent assault
does not include the
element of forcible
compulsion as does
the crime of rape."
Indecent assault is a
less serious crime
than rape and carries
a lesser punishment.
So a crime was committed, but in Pennsylvania that crime
wasn't rape.
This decision sets
a horrific precedent.
It could be interpreted to mean that
victims in Pennsylvania have to try to
use force againsttheir
tance" to Berkowitz's advances, nor assaulters—even when there are
did she try to unlock the door and weapons involved—for the crime to
escape. It wasn't enough that she be considered rape. Reaction to the
made herintentions clear verbally or decision has been primarily critical.

Rape survivors' groupsand women's
groups are condemning the ruling; in
addition many police departments
now fear thatrape prosecutions will
be even harder to obtain, especially
in cases of acquaintance rape. In
these cases, thereis often no threatof
being harmed or killed, but that
doesn't change the reality of rape.
The Supreme Court decision contrasts markedly with laws of other
states, including those of neighboring New Jersey, which make it clear
that verbal expression of resistance
is sufficient evidence to prove a rape
occurred. The all-male Supreme
Court, in attempting to turn back the
legal clock to the days when rapes
only occurred at knife or gun point,
has made the Commonwealth a dangerous place for all potential victims
of sexual assault. The notion that
victims of sexual assault must physically fight back is preposterous. If
the victim says "no," there shouldn't
be any question of intent. That is
how laws in other states are interpreted. Why should Pennsylvania be
any different?

Swarthmore is one of the best institutions for higher learning in the

After the initial confusion regarding subterranean vegetables, my fellow

Swarthmore's true identity as a liberal arts college. They gaped at me

I was pleasantly surprised to discover
that all the stigmas attached to
Swarthmore by my Idaho comrades
held very little truth. Not everyone
drove a Beamer or Mercedes, wore a

was so relieved that my doctor took
me off my medication.
I'm not saying that we here at
Swarthmore aren't privileged—we
are and we had better be for the cost
of attending. This high cost of tuition
provides sufficient returns, including top notch faculty, excellent communicationtechnology, Sharpies, free

So the next time someone sneers at

to educate others as to what
Swarthmore is all about.

They have recorded on Proteen Records of
Harrisburg, PA, and "I Have So Many

Proteen's next releases. In addition to recording, Meringue has played gigs at the Khyber

at CBGB's in New York City.
The band is hoping the fall tour may enable
them to go on a longer tour next summer, but
the band's plans are somewhat tentative
because all three members are graduating this

Repression, Injustice and Movies
The Remains of the Day is Merchant-Ivory's finest
drama yet, but like most movies made from great books,
it doesn't quite measure up. It retains the poignancy of
Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, but it can't find a visual analogue for his exquisite prose, and the novel's rich psychology is diluted into a more typical love plot
Still, it's hard not to be moved by
Anthony Hopkins' performance as
Mr. Stevens, an English butler so
devoted to the ideal of decorum and
restraint his position commands that
he bleeds himself dry, submerging
passion and sorrow alike beneath a

white FBI agents sent to investigate the case.
For a film about one of the most important moments
in this country's history, Mississippi Burning is distressingly generic. You've seen all these characters before:
the overzealous, by-the-book FBI agent; his older, more
cynical partner; the seemingly endless parade of rednecks who make Roscoe P. Coltrane
look like Thomas Edison. As you
watch the stream of familiar faces
doing familiar things, the question
that comes to mind is 'Why?'
The film's explicit purpose is to
serve as a reminder of the ugly facts
of America's racist past, but it's so
slick, it's violence so "tastefully" hidden, that it might as
well be set on another planet. When a group of Klansmen
waitoutside a black church with sticks in their hands, the
gospel music on the soundtrack swells, as if to insulate
us from the violence, aestheticizing it before it has even
occurred.
Although these incidents have a certain power of their
own that clumsy direction cannot obscure, the film
comes close to doing just that. It's long on generalizations and short on specifics; we end up with a film full of

Hopkins' finely-tuned performance allows us to
glimpse what was explicit in the book; for all its outward
dryness, his life has a finely-wrought, if ultimately stifling beauty. Without it, the film would likely be unbearable, but Hopkins makes us feel sympathy for a man who
spends twenty years pining after the same woman, and
supports his employer's Nazi sympathies because "His
Lordship knows a great many things."
Emma Thompson is also excellent as the servant with
whom Stevens falls in love, bringing a warmth and energy necessarily lacking from Hopkins' performance.
Anyone who doesn't find daunting the idea of a film in
which none of the characters actually does anything is
advised to check this film out.

Sooner or later, every major tragedy gets turned into
mediocre art. Nazi Germany has its Swing Kids, Vietnam
its Casualties of War, and the American civil rights
struggle has Mississippi Burning. It takes the true story
of the murder of three civil rights workers (two white,
one black), and uses it as backdrop for the bending of the

empty gestures.
The film's great realization is that hey, racism did
exist (it never goes so far as to say it does), and gosh it
was pretty terrible, wasn't it? At one point, Willem
Dafoe's character actually asks, "Where does it come
from, all this hatred?" It's as though if we could only figure out where racism came from we could head it off at
the pass and be home in time for supper.

Worst is the fact that a movie about the dehumanization of African-Americans goes from start to finish without a single significant black character. The black characters are all dead-eyed and hopeless; it takes the white
FBI agents to show them something must be done.
Mississippi Burning plays Saturday in the PAC.

Sacred Blue Tray Stolen from Sharples
I contemplated submitting this column to the
news section of The Phoenix because my subject matter this week is so compelling, so significant, and so pressing that it is worthy only
of the front page.
But then I remembered that no one really
reads the news section of the paper (c'mon,
admit it), so I had better keep this weighty
topic right where it is in the good ol' movie
reviewing, advice giving, trash talking features section.
So, before I impart this devastating news to
you, I just want to remind my readership for its
own sake and the well-being of others that
murder is not a viable resolution to any problem. First of all, it's illegal. Second, it's morally reprehensible. And third, it's normally just

Nick Lehmann steal the sacred BLUE TRAY
from Sharpies.
I know, I know. It will take a few minutes for
a confession of this magnitude to sink in. The
seven stages of grief (which are, I think,
denial, anger, depression, enw. ffhmnnv
sloth, chocolate, and paper
goods) must all be satisfied
before full comprehension of the
enormity of Nick's sin can be
attained. Be patient, my friend.
Now, before passing sentence
on poor ol' Nickypoo, I should
explain how I gained such intimate knowledge of this sordid
affair.
It went something like this. I
was sitting in Sharpies, consuming my apple sauce and discussing social constructionism
with two-thirds of the inhabitants of the stunning Roberts
quad, when I just happened to
turn around to see Nick taking all his dishes
off the sacred blue tray.
I greeted him in my typical demure manner
by screaming across Sharpies, "Nick! You got
the sacred blue tray!"
He looked up, smiled sheepishly, and continued with his task.
When he started to clean the tray with a cou-

pie of napkins, I began to get suspicious.
"Hey, Nick!" I bellowed, "What are you
doing to the sacred blue tray? Polishing it?"
No comment.
"You're not going to steal that sacred blue
trav are vmj Nick? That tray is our covenant
with God that someday all the
red trays will all be returned to
Sharpies. There is an unwritten
Swattie law that no one shall
steal the sacred blue tray. You
wouldn't defile the unwritten
word, would you now?"
No response.
I begged, "Please, Nick,
please. Don't do it! The only
happiness I have been able to
glean from this crazy, mixed up
world is wholly represented by
that blue tray. Please!"
He slid the tray into a
friend's backpack and walked

too messy.
I mean, even

Katie

if you can avoid getting blood
all over the place by either strangling or poisoning your victim, you still have to dispose of
the body. And although you can get those safe
ride guys to do a lot for you, they probably
will draw the line at carrying you and a cadaver in the guise of night in their golf carts across
campus and helping you dump the deceased in
the Crum.
Well, I've put it off as long as I could. I must
tell you something although it hurts me as
much to write of such gruesome activities as it
does for you to read them. Here goes: I saw

Menzer

out of Sharpies.

I have not seen the sacred blue tray since.

But before we can pass judgment on Nick, I
think we must entertain the possibility of
extenuating circumstances that might have
forced the wretched Nick into this life of
crime. Perhaps Nick is truly sick. I don't mean
he's got a little case of the sniffles, but maybe
he is touched, mentally ill, insane, deranged,

psychopathic, schizophrenic, or otherwise out
of his mind.
Maybe he has a clinically diagnosed obsession for smooth, turgid, blue things belonging
to other people.
Maybe a loved one was once killed in a horrible blue tray sledding accident and he is
magnanimously trying to save his fellow
S watties from the same cruel fate.
Or maybe he was denied oxygen for a long
time as a small child.
Who knows?
But no matter what the reason, 1 think that
Mr. Lehmann deserves our pity, not our hate. I
know it will be tough. I, too, have to suppress
the urge to plunge a couple of knives into
strategically placed areas ofNick's body every
time I see him at dinner.
But that, I know, would serve no purpose
other than teaching Nick to steer clear of short,
red-headed women wielding cutlery in the dining hall.

So I am going to make one last appeal to you,
Nick. Please, oh please, return the sacred blue
tray to Sharpies. No questions will be asked.
No stigma will be placed on your name.
You're being given an infrequent chance to
redeem yourself. Take it.
By the way, applications are now being
accepted for the lynch mob. Only 752 positions are still open, so be sure to apply soon.

The Phoenix

And the Muse Speaks
The Poetry and Prose

of Swarthmore's Writers

September Again
Another year has begun at Swarthmore, as it has every year
since 1864. A school transformed so subtly year after year, that change
goes barely noticed before it is somehow dramatic. Having spent my
junior year abroad, I did not witness this past year's changes. At times
I convinced myself that the hardest part of being away was that I would
not be on the Swarthmore campus to watch the year unfold. A
Swarthmore year has a rhythmic regularity to it, and yet no year is
quite the same...
To return to Swarthmore at summer's end with boxes and duffel bags
and posters and hotpots is to make endless trips up and down more endless
stairs in the sticky-sweet chaos of Back-to-School. The stickily elated
greetings which send returning students bounding through Parrish its wall
quiet and bare, into arms and arms and arms. To arrive at Swarthmore with
that first anxious, stiffly held smileof the first arrival, looking enviously
upon the sophomores who know each other, hoping that will be you next
August. You dig your withered, taped and illegible I.D. from the safe
forgotten place you have hidden it in your backpack and recite it to the
checker. She notices that you have cut your hair. 'The Graduate' plays to
an airless audience and classes begin. One of these days you will
remember your mailbox combination.
Itis September and somehow we have managed to evade the oppressive
humidity which makes even your most worn cotton t-shirt a second skin.
Parrish beach is peopled by the white Adirondack chairs, and students
barely feigning to be productive as they savor the sun and barefeet and
delicately position their chairs out of the sightlines ofMcCabe. Classes
seem whimsical titles, reading lists seem unlikely. To leave Sharpies after
dinneris to enter the milky timeless time of dusk. Magill walkis full and
green. Grey campus squirrels bound. You venture in the late afternoon
down into theCram and vow that you will do this every afternoon. A walk
to the Village Porch.
The air dries with October. First years begin to feel their fog lift.
Campus fashion plays a wide range from unwashed shorts to wool
sweaters and boots. Hats have begun to appear. The Ginko trees send
down theoccasional teaser of their yellow leaves. Talk of looming papers,
the too early arrival of midterms, and plans for October break when the
semester has just begun. But the semester has just begun. The heat is
turned on. Thank God the heat is turned on miraculously over break. Ml
and Halloween. To venture through the tunnel below the tracks (with any
luck the train will pass over right then and there) past intriguing steam
pipes of Physical plant, past the track with it counterclockwise traffic
flow, the brief patch of homes and Suburbia, test fate as you dare to cross
Yale, and then to climb the hill with Ml looming, hauntingly at the top, into
the darkened lounge, the deafening weirdness of seeing half the campus
in drag.
November brings coats and it becomes easier to smuggle coffee into
McCabe. Cross from Beardsley to Cornell across the great lake ofleaves.
They crush musically under the weight of your feet. You find theskeletal
remains ofleaves in your socks whenyou take of f your shoes in the library.
Breathbecomes visible. The Fall Jamboreetests the holding capacities of
Lang. You have become friendly with the night staff at Worth Health
center. What will it be tonight Renato's, Alfredo's, Swat Pizza? McGill
Walk has become thin, from your seat in the secondfloor classrooms of
Parrish you can see down to the station. One night the Ginko trees spread
the word and drop their leaves intriumphant piles. The campus shrugs off
its rolled-out-of-bed attire and cleans up real nice for the fall formal.
The frenzy of December as it swings wildly between endless nights

during which you fasten your eyelids
open with caffeine, with tape, you walk
between buildings clutching your coat,
your head tipped downwards.With those
moments of hedonism as you plunder
the snack machine with some friends,
and sit in an unabashed stupor on the
basement floor, breathing the mold air
deeply into your lungs. You run into
your mailbox-mate for the very first
time, and are vindicated, she's convinced all the mail's for you. Finals
arrive and it is all you can do to keep
yourself from flinging yourself on a
plane, a train, a bicycle and head home.
Papers are painstakingly produced over
hours of 1rounded shoulder work. Papers are miraculously handed to you
down from the clouds. Bagged heads
and naked bodieshave stormed through
Sharpies. Do you buy your mother her
Christmas present at Galleria Maya?
January nearly doesn't come. And whenit does you are firmly resolved that
this semester you won't save anything for reading week. Your plants have died
over the winter break, you dispose of them surreptitiously. Careful steps are
taken on the frozenpath down to Sharpies. Thefieldbetween campus and PPR
is sheer frosted white in the mornings. You spend an afternoon sitting in a
window with an open, and otherwise untouched book in your hand watching
a snow flurry. Already there is talk ofScrew Your Roommate. To walk into
a party at the OldeClub is to peel layers off into the upstairs coatroom, stand
on the balcony briefly to take stock of the situation, the sweat and heavy
breathing rises. You bend your knees in slow rolling bends to the saxophone
on stage.
In February, you begin to recognize people based on their shoes. "Hey,
there's Jake, I'dknow those duck boots anywhere." Tuesday night you meet
a friend, a lover, an interest at Paces. The walls and coffee are bright and warm,
and Swarthmore seems somewhere else for the brief time. Talk is reduced to
SYR. A genuine snowfall. Students leave Sharpies with oh so flat chests.
SYR happens at long last. Talk is reduced to what went on at SYR. You are
drawn from your corner near the microfilm to witness the McCabe Mile.
March. And what are you doing for spring break? You have worn a deep
andfamiliar path in your routes to and from your room to Sharpies to class to
McCabe. A fire alarm in the mid morning is a satisfying class distraction. You
carry your travel mug with you every where you go. It is forever filled with
a hot liquid and carries a lingering scent of the cinnamon apple tea you drank
after lunch. Birds begin to reappear. You pin napkins demanding tortillachips
on the board in Sharpies.
April. Tauntingly clear days leave Swatties in shorts and t-shirts. Tour
groups pass with red-nosed, wool coated prospective students. Couples begin
to appear as though from nothing. The weather turns and the tulips burst forth
from the still chilled ground. The tunnel to the fieldhouse is made beautiful by
its hillside of daffodils. Trays are carriedfrom Sharpies outside. Barefeetand
volleyball games. You maximizeyour daylight hours, nights become later. An
unseasonal snow storm traumatizes the flowers, they stand limply on timid
stalks. When the sun returns their petals curl up browned. The trees explode
like muted fireworks.

I am standing on the concrete slab that lies beneath the house.

The television is on. It is dark. It is late.
The dishwasher churns and cleans another dishload fullof plates.

How I know
what I believe is something
of a trivial matter.
Mathematicians understand
trivial solutions as not in the least

and, in fact, I think it is true
that men with names and brains
like Euclid did not lie
easily,
for a sum of two bodies,
two lives,
is equal to nothing
if both those bodies are themselves
nothing. No more

can be found,
this an axiom,

there was nothing

Week In Review...

Baseball
Baseball in the fall? While it is not as
exciting as the Orioles winning the World
Series, the Swarthmore's Men's Baseball
team (minus members of the football team)
takes the field every weekend for a couple
of "games" against local teams. Swat has
been playing solid baseball led by returning
pitcher and secondbaseman Jeremy Bonder
'97 and shortstop Matt Grossman '96. Jon
Francis '9B has displayed a strong bat and
the ability to play both infield and outfield
well. Swarthmore takes a 1-2 record into
this weekendwhen they will face a semi-pro
team, Delaware County Community College, against whom they are 1-1 this fall.
Last weekend, DCCC was able to avenge an
earlier 4-3 loss to Swat with a 4-3 win ofits
own. Swarthmore will have a much more
experienced team this year, having lost only
two starters compared to last year's team,
which only returned one starter.

Men's X-Country
Johns Hopkins is a lacrosse school, not a
cross-country school; this is one of those
absolute truths upon which a life philosophy
may be based. While our compatriots, the
Men's Soccer team, were forced to compete
on the ankle-biting astroturf lax field, the
cross-country team, for its part, was shown
a hellishly repetitive

and suspiciously long

(i.e. over 8K or 5 miles, the normal distance)

course by Hopkins' aging-hippy coach. But
the spunky Swat squad remained undaunted.
Those who gambled with the Garnet garnered gross gains as they triumphed over
Johns Hopkins University andThe Catholic
University ofAmerica. But more important
than who won or lost in this contest was the
return of resident adviser and cross-country
co-captain Gene Vann '95 to NCAA Division HI competition. In traditional Vann
fashion, Gene came back from serious injury and months of obligatory pool and
bicycle cross-training to utterly shame his

nominally healthy yet pathetically impotent
opponents, streaking to a second place finish overall behind Hopkins' lone decent
runner. In a textbookresult, team senior and
co-captain John McKenna Kane loped in a
scant second behind Vann. Close behind
Kane strode sturdy Steve Laubach '96 like a
gallant gazelle across the line. A little later,
the capacity crowd, raised to a fever pitch
and threatening to riot after Varm's finish,
witnessed the conclusion of junior John
Freeman's race. Freeman has been epitomizing hard work and dedication lately,
logging70-80 mile weeks, pushing through
a brutalrun, and lifting weights like it's his
job. Kerry Boeye '97 pushed through some
pain and a nagging knee injury to finish as
the Garnet's fifth man. This week, they
travel to AllentownCollege to wrangle with
Allentown, Lebanon Valley, and
Muhlenberg.

Women's Volleyball notched another Centennial Conference victory Tuesday and improved its overall record to 4-4 when it defeated Dickinson 15-9, 15-9, 15-13.
Swarthmore showed few ill effects from a
disappointing three set loss to Washington in
its last match. Strong serving was one of the
keys to the victory over Dickinson and the team
combined for a total of 12 aces, 7 by weak-side
hitter Chi Yun '95. Diana Bieber '96 led the
team in kills with 5 and was the boost off the
bench Swat needed to pull out the second and
third games. Nancy Rosenbaum '96 contributed 4kills, 2 digs, and an ace in another solid
performance. In its two matches before hosting the all-important Seven Sisters' tournament October Bth and 9th, Swat looks for the
consistency that it has lacked for most of the
season. Swarthmorehosts Kutztown at 1:00on
Saturday.

Men's rugby faced a strong team this week
against the University of Delaware and suffered a tough loss, 30-14. The Buzzards scored
two tries; the first within the opening minutes
of thematch by Justin McLean '95 as he skirted
in early from the five meter mark off of a line
out The second try was scored by Jack Schecter
'96 late in the game off of a long pass from
DarinFriess '95. Friess converted both kicks to
bring theBuzzards to 14. The game proved to
be a cohesive attack between the forwards and
the backs.
"We've been lacking a plan," said Friess,
"but this week we've been concentrating on
that and on our tackling so we're looking forward to this weekend's game." The Buzzards
face East Stroudsburg tomorrow in an away
match.

Earthworms Crawl All Over Tournament Opposition
By Matt Robison

Swarthmore Men's Ultimate swept through
this past weekend's tournament at Lehigh University, toppling regional rivals and setting the
stage for a conference showdown with perennial nemesis Haverford this Thursday.
Swarthmore divided into two even teams for
the tournament in order to limit team sizes.
Swarthmore 1 proved unstoppable throughout
the day, finishing 4-0 and winning the tournament.

Swat 1 drew Lehigh in the first round and
crushed them 13-6 before the host team could
catch their breath. Lehigh was stymied close to
their end zone by the tight Swat defense. "We
just shut them down before they could ever get
going," said co-captain Robin Mandel '97 "our
defense was unstoppable."
In the second round, Swat 1 faced Delaware,
who tested the Earthworms' offensive skills
with a pressing zone defense. The 'worms
relentlessly pushed the disc across the field,
relying on steady passing from Mandel, Ben
Rutter '97 and Ali Momeni '97. With the
Delaware zone on the run, the Swarthmore

handlers exploited the holes in the middle,
connecting with rookie wonders Carl Mas '9B
and Matt Van Italie '9B. Swarthmore's grinding offense proved too strong for Delaware,
and Swat took the game 13-9.
With momentum building, Swarthmore faced
their toughest challenge of the day against
Lafayette. The teams slugged away at each
other, with Lafayette pulling spectacular grabs
from Swat defenders. But the Earthworms'
long-distance aerial attack could notbestopped,
as Rutter connected with cross-country recruit
Tim Sibley '9B four times for goals. Fellow
track runner Matt Peck '96 bolstered the scoring with streaking deep cuts, helping
Swarthmore pull out a hotly-contested 13-10
victory.

In the final round, Swarthmore played an
exhaustedHaverford B squad. Having played
the first three rounds with only eight players,
the Fords were no match for Swat, who easily
defeated them 13-2.
"It was incredible," said Rutter, "we played
so well all day, and everyone was huge, especially the new players."
Swarthmore 2 was likewise successful

throughout the day, but lost two frustratingly
close games. In the first round, Swat played

Delaware with its pressuring zone defense.
TheEarthworms handled the zone impressively,
with steady passing by Mike Morton '97 and
Dave Sacker '97, but Delaware hung in and
capitalized on Swarthmore's miscues. With the
game tied at 8-8, Delaware punched a quick
score into the end zone on a spectacular diving
grab, and won the game 9-8.
"It could have gone either way," said Sacker,
"we played a great second half, and put ourselves in a position to win it; they just made a
great play on the last point."
Bristling at the last-second loss, Swat 2 came
out strong in their second game against
Haverford. Swat took advantage of slack defense, hitting the corners of the end zone for
scores, and in the second half Swat clamped
down on their defense, pulling away to win 138.
The Earthworms next faced Lehigh, who had
awakened since their early round loss to Swat
1. With strong mid-cuts from Andrew Groat
'97, Swarthmore was able to keep the disc
moving and match the Lehigh scoring eaily. As

Lehigh began to slip, they attempted a surprise
zone defense, but the 'worms patiently swung
the disc across from sideline to sideline, relentlessly pressing Lehigh against their endline to
score. Late in the second half, Swat forced
three turnovers leading to scores, and won the
game 13-10.

Tired from the long game with Lehigh,
Swarthmore 2 played sluggishly in their last
game against Lafayette. The 'worms kept it
close in the first half, with blazing long cuts by
Eric Rosolowsky '9B. However, in the second
half Lafayette pulled away, as Swat fell victim
to drops on key points. "We were pretty tired
by the Lafayette game, and we couldn't pull it
out in the second half," said Morton.
With the strong showing this weekend,
Swarthmore is poised for a conference matchup
with Haverford, whose A team was busy winning the tournament at Rutgers this past weekend. Swarthmore will play Haverford as part of
the Pennsylvania Conference series, but will
also participate in the national series' Sectionals
Tournament this weekend.

Climb Into the Outsiders Club For a Change of Scenery
A Night Off the Swarthmore Campus
By Dave Sturtvant
How many Saturday nights have I ended
in the Old Club; and how many Sunday
mornings have I wondered why. I have
ritualized this sequence in my two years here
and the time to break the routine has been
up

long overdue.

As theLuau ragged in Willets last Saturday, the Outsiders Cluboffered a more pleasant alternative. Swarthmore and everything

climbed on and around the massive structures. Some theorized about the origin of the
field, proving that you can take the student
out of Swat, but you cannot take the Swattie
out of the student.
When we hit the road for home, we were all
exhausted from our day in the wilderness.
The fog of hangover still lingered over some
at campus, as we pulled into the Rose Garden, returned completely satisfied from a
wholesome weekend.

associated with it disappeared from sight and
mind as seventeen of us traveled to Hickory
Run State Park in the southern end of the
Poconos.
The ruggedness of theindividuals and their
outdoor experience varied; some brought pillows, while others slept in tree branches. We
all came for different reasons, but we all
shared an appreciation for the outdoors, even
if we only enjoyed it on a small scale the
hike was short and the marshmallows were
miniature (then again so was the fire).
Saturday evening, after camp was set up,
we talked over hamburgers and potato salad,
relaxing in the ambiance with a little help
from James Taylor at thenext site. We stayed
up over the campfire, and for those who
didn't know already, learned the nuances
involved with climbing the dome of Parrish
and following the steam pipes to ML. One by
one people crept off to their tents as the fire
burned to its embers.
Early Sunday morning we rolled out of our
tents to find breakfast waiting on the table.
We struck camp, brushed our teeth, and hit
the trail. Despite gray weather at first, the
view of the river meandering through mountains of fall foliage was spectacular from the
Sky Line Trail.. No one remained entirely
dry through the two river crossings, and we
missed one rum on the trail. However, spirits
were still high and we were shortly reunited
at the cars.
As the trip wound down, we decided to
make one last stop in the park— the Boulder
Field. At this surreal sight we ate lunch and

New Organization Focuses on Nature
By Matthew Halpern
Are you sick and tired of the bulldozers,
green plastic fences, and other forms of construction paraphernalia that currently clutter
Swarthmore's once beautiful campus? Would
you love to leave this demolitionsitebehind for
a while and immerse yourself in nature's untouched magnificence? Well, there is currently
a group ofabout twenty S watties who are doing
just that The members of the Outsiders Club,
a newly formed student organization, organize
outdoor overnight trips that are open to the
entire Swarthmore student body.
Started by Dave Sturtevant '96 and Lauren
Jacobi '97 at the end of last semester, the
Outsiders Club was created to provide a forum
for nature enthusiasts. "Dave and I thought it
would be neat to get together a group of people
who loved nature as much as we did," commented Jacobi. "We thought it wouldbe a lot
of fun and a great excuse to get away from
schoolfor a little while." Typically, Outsiders'
trips leave on either a Friday or Saturday afternoon and return the following evening.
This past weekend, the Outsiders Club embarked on their first official expedition to
Hickory Run State Park, in Hickory, Pennsylvania. Members were encouraged to bring
numerous items, but were also reminded of the

club policy: "You bring it, you carry it." They
arrived at the park on Saturday evening, set up
a camp site, and setded in for a evening offun
and relaxation. "Even though we were only
two hours away, it was just awesome," enthused Sturtevant, adding, "It felt so nice." "It
was the first time I've ever done something
like this. I'm definitely going to do it again,"
said club member Ben Henwood '97.
The Club has set the first weekend ofOctober break as a tentative date for theirnext trip.
Sturtevant and Jacobi have not yet decided
upon a location and they are open to suggestions. "We're always looking for people who
are familiar with the area, and have ideas for
possible trips," stated Sturtevant. Sturtevant
emphasized the fact that no experience is necessary to join the club. He said, "We have the
tents, and we're putting together a collection
of sleeping bags for anyone who doesn't have
one." "We're also trying to expand the focus
of the group to activities other than just hiking," noted Jacobi. "Inprevious years, similar
clubs have gone caving and hang-gliding."
The activities of Outsiders offer breathtaking alternatives to jack-hammers and yellow caution tape. The next time you feel
trapped or isolated in the microcosm of
Swarthmore, remember this option now available to the slightly more adventurous at heart.

Women Ruggers Are Victorious In First Home Match
By Margaret Patterson
Last Saturday, Swarthmore Women's
Rugby competed and von their first divi-

sional game of the season. They shut out
Westchester University with a final score of
23-0.
Both teams began the game in a sloppy
fashion with numerous missed passes and
loose balls. However, within ten minutes
Swarthmore regrouped and began showing
the skills and teamwork for which they are
known. With the score still tied at zero,
Swarthmore attempted to make a field goal on
a penalty against Westchester. The kick did
not go through the uprights, but Swarthmore
quickly recovered the ball and Delta
Ruscheinsky '95 scoredthefirst try on a weak
side play. Shortly thereafter, Swarthmore
again found themselves positioned directly in
front of the uprights after a penalty against

Westchester. Paula Garrett's '95 kick was
perfect, bringing the score to 8-0.
At this point, Swarthmore incurred a series
of penalties for offsides, hands in theruck, and
not retreating quickly enough on one of the
previous penalties. They faced a scrum and a
lineout dangerously close to their own try line.
Fortunately, Swat overcame this position with
the help of Ruscheinsky's kicking ability.
Still in the first half, Ruscheinsky scored her
second try of the game.
In the second half, with a strong back line
and stellar performance of rookie Margaret
Coote '9B, Swarthmore scored their third try
of the game. Coote sped through their back
line and past the full back to touch the ball
down in good position near the uprights.
Garrett attempted a conversion, but was
unethically distracted by the ranting screams
of Westchester. The referee, Steve Cohen,
granted Swat a second attempt.

As a result of KatieLaird's '96 never-ending
lecture after the team's loss to Bryn MawrHaverford last week, Swarthmore'sfitness level
was much higher, and they kept up their intensity throughout the second half. The forward
pack led by flankers, Bridget Arbour '97 and
Kelly Shannon '96, was in support at every
breakdown of play. With about five minutes
remaining Ruscheinsky received the ball off of
a ruck about five meters off of Westchester's
try line and forced her way through their back
line to score once again.
Although Westchester often varied their cadence in the scrums, the strength of the
Swarthmore scrum dominated. (A rugby scrum
can be described as a pack of forwards from
each team rucking for a loose ball) Often their
best defense was to collapse the scrum.
Swarthmore controlled the lineouts, withrookie
Andrea Johnson '9B jumping in. At one point
thereferee warned the Westchester scrum-half

Men's Soccer Prepares for Competition
By Dan Malkoun
Despite the bizarre scheduling fiasco that
started the season, the Swarthmore men's soccer team has since come on strong to chalk up
an overall record of six wins and three losses
coming into thisweekend. However, the game
this Saturday at Dickinson in Carlisle, Pennsylvania will probably set the tone for the rest of
the year.
As if their 6-3 overall record wasn't impressive enough, two of those three losses came at
thehands ofDivision I and II teams. In fact, the
only Division EI loss of the year came this past
weekend when the Garnet Tide, playing on
artificial grass for the first time sincelast year,
fell to Johns Hopkins University 1-0. The trim,
slick turf at Johns Hopkins allows for a much
faster style of play than Swarthmore is normally accustomed to, and theseunusual condi-,
tions played a large role in the heartbreaking
defeat. Said Sophomore Kyle Barnett of the
Hopkins game, "The turf just kills you."
But make no mistake about this team. If
anything, they've showed an ability to battle

uncontrollablefactors to play hard-nosed soccer, and to gather a 2-1 league record going
into the weekend's big game against the Red
Devils
After recording their first league loss of the
season, the men's team promptly came back to
defeat GoucherCollege 5-3. Though missing
several key starters, the team picked up the
slack inMonday's win to provide the momentum for this Saturday's match-up. In fact, all
five goals against Goucher came oddly enough
from a trio ofSophomore roommates Kyle
Barnett, Amber Thompson, and Dave Lane.
Barnett, who notched himself a hat trick in the
game, raised his total to five goals on the year,
while Thompson scored his third and Lane
recorded his sixth, making this the highest
scoring room on campus.
Although this tandem of bedfellows has
scored 64% of the teams goals allyear, B arnett
attributes the team's success to the outstanding play of such teammates like Ben Cook' 95,
Len Cuelow '96, and Jeremy Dittmar '97.
Keeper Shawn Bundy '97 agrees, noting that
the defense continues "to come up big" in the

games, and that the team as a whole has played
solid ball all season. Bundy says the guys are
putting a lot of emphasis on the upcoming
Dickinson match, calling it "a make-or-break
game for both teams."
The team hopes to come home from Carlisle
with a key victory to carry them into the
Mulhenberg game at home on Wednesday. A
loss to Dickinson would place the Garnet in a
tight spot for the remainder of the season,
forcing them to beat nationally ranked
Muhlenberg (who beat Dickinson 2-0) and
sweep the rest of its league games in order to
have a chance to play in the NCAA tournament.
A win in thisweekend's game, however, would,
in Bundy's words, "...fire us up for the rest of
the season," giving Swarthmore momentum to
play Muhlenberg and setting them on a pace to
reach the end of the year national tourney.
WithNathan Fairman '95 coming back from an
injury, the Garnet team is pumped up for this
weekend; said Bundy, "We have all the tools,
and we've already put them to the test to prove
we can play well, now we just have to go up
there and win."

for telling her team to put Andrea in the hospital
(as ifthey could have caught her, had they tried).
The women ruggers will play Bucknell this
Saturday at noon on the Dupont Field.
Swarthmore must win this game and defeat
Franklin and Marshall on October 29 in order to
be assured a place in the playoffs.
