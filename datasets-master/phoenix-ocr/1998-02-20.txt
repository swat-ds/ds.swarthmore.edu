Overflow Crowd Packs Staff Collection
by Tony Sturm
Last Friday, beneath murals
depicting the hardships of the
proletariat in Hicks' Mural
Room, well over a hundred
staff and various other members of the Swarthmore community gathered to voice their
concerns about staff and administration relations and to
hear an administrative response
to many of their questions.
This was the second, and

originally scheduled to be the
last, meeting that would serve
as an open forum for staff to
express their concerns to the
Staffing Long Range Planning

Committee (SLRPC). The first
meeting, held January 28 in
Hicks basement, was standing
room only, as over sixty inter-

ested staff and faculty attended.
The much larger Mural
Room was again filled past capacitv last Friday, and Vice
President forFinance andPlanning Paul Aslanian of the
SLRPC announced a third
meeting, to be held on March
5 from 12:00p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
An informal committee of
staff, faculty and students has
recently been petitioning the
College for better staff treatment in a variety of areas. A
request was made for a number of changes in College
policy in a letter recendy sent
to the members of the SLRPC.
The letter included the signatures of 50 staff members and
a handful of students and faculty, and set forth many spe-

cific and general changes that
the staff would like to see
made.
"Staffer" is a remarkably
broad and encompassing job
title at Swarthmore that can
describe workers from dining
services and the physical
plant, administrative assistants, and deans of the College. Staffers, such as the
deans, who are paid on a salary basis are called "exempt"
staff. All other staff members,
who are paid by the hour, are
"non-exempt." As of last
spring, there were 340 staff
members on campus, meaning
there are just over four students for every staff member.
The letter, drafted by the ad
hoc committee composed
mainly of both exempt and
non-exempt staff members
and dated January 28, took issue with several minor and
more significant matters. One
the more serious concerns was
the fact that on the SLRPC,
only one member was a nonexempt staffer.
"Non-exempt staff don't
have much of a voice," said
Kae Kalwaic, an administrative assistant in the Program
in Education Department who
helped to write the letter.
A few years ago, a group
called the Committee on Staff
Procedures (COSP) was
formed in order to address
staff concerns. However, the
COSP's sole function is to advise the President on issues regarding the staff.

Starr, Students, and Faculty gather to discuss start issues.

In response to the letter, the
SLRPC has added four new members, from and appointed by
COSP. Of those four new members, two are non-exempt staff.
These new members have not yet
met with

the SLRPC.

Many staffers also have major
problems with the communications between staff and administration. For instance, SLRPC has
been criticizedfor its fact-finding
methods. "Information gathering
[by the SLRPC] was basically
talking to theheads of departments
to see what they thought," said
Mary Ellen Chijioke '67, Curator
of the Friends Historical Library,
member of the ad hoc committee

are working to empower COSP
to have the ability to deal with
issues like this," said Jeff Lott,
Director of Publications and a
member of COSP. Pat Trinder,
Recruitment Coordinator of the
Career Planning & Placement
Office and a member of COSP
newly appointed to the SLRPC,
added, "We are in the process
of looking at COSP's function.
This ad hoc committee has
brought a lot of stuff out in the

open."

Last Sunday, about 17 students met in
Parrish Parlors to discuss their dissatisfaction with Swarthmore's dining services. The meeting was convened by
Vincent Jones '9B, who felt that it was
"time for students to take a more proactive approach in obtaining the things
that they want on campus." After the
meeting, Jones along with many of the
students in attendance, decided to form
a committee, calling themselves
"SURFS" or Students United To Reform
Food Services.
According to Jones, SURFS chose four
goals as their primary focus: 1) to have
$3.75 credit in Tarble at all times, 2) to
have decent quantities of hot food in
Sharpies from opening until closing, 3)

4

to

decrease the proportion of fried food

in the menu at Sharpies, and 4) to make
sure that students are more actively involved in dining service decisions.
"Students should be provided with adequate food service just as they are provided with adequate academic facilities," says SURFS member Michelle
McKeithan 'OO. "It is unfair for athletes
to have to come into Sharpies after a
long day ofclasses and practice and have
nothing left to eat but cold cereal, fruit,
and ice cream because there is no hot
food left."
Student Council, which has been
working on the food issue since the beginning of the semester, is in agreement
with SURFS. According to SC co-Chair
Ryan Peterson 'OO, "the Council said
that it would support SURFS efforts,

although they [Council] intend to refrain from taking on any sort of militant attitude. It has been the Council's
opinion," he continued, "that a lot of can
be accomplished through dialogue and
efficient communication with the appropriate people and that a militant attitude is unnecessary."
In a meeting withDining Services Director Linda McDougall on Tuesday,
Peterson discussed Student Council's
desire to improve and reform dining services and explained to her therecent formation of SURFS and the four goals
outlined by them. According to
Peterson, "Ms. McDougall was open
and responsive to all of the ideas and
goals."
As a result, many changes are already
under way. McDougall has agreed to

speak to the chef about less fried food,
and ensured that hot meals in Sharpies
will be available until 7:15 p.m. She also
will try to help in extending Tarble hours
and creditlimitations, and will work with
Student Council to ensure that students
play an active role in dining service de-

cisions.
When asked how he feels about Ms.
McDougall's plans to adhere to students
suggestions, Vincent Jones stated that
"he was glad that dining services decided
to recognize the merit of our goals and
are willing to find the most feasible way
to make them a reality." But he also
hopes that "students continue to speak
up when they notice that things need to
be improved as well as acknowledge
through compliments and praise when
things are going well."

Robert Putnam '63, considered by many of his
colleagues to be America's most prominent and provocative political scientist, used more than an hour
Wednesday night describing declines in social and
leisure group participation among younger generations of Americans. Delivering the Political Science Department's annual Charles E. Gilbert Lecture, Putnam told the audience these declines are
balkanizing Americans socially and decreasing political participation.
Pausing frequently to offer humorous or methodological footnotes about the data he collects on
American behavior, Putnam attributed most of the
civic and social slowdown to changing lifestyles.
"It's as if people who came of age after World War
II were permanently irradiated by an anti-civicness
X-ray," mused Putnam, making an oblique reference
to the television viewing that he considers responsible for declining civic engagement.
In contrast to documentarianMichael Moore who
lectured at Swarthmore last semester and encouraged students to dive into forms of mass and popular culture, Putnam offered more guarded and skeptical opinions about television and theInternet. "Undirected â€”thatis unless we sort of think consciously
about how we work the technology to evolve
[high-tech solutions] are unlikely to solve the social capital problem because, I think, the natural tendency of technology is to move us toward smaller
and smaller audiences and toward more and more
passive entertainments."
Still, in an interview with The Phoenix, Putnam
said that he has met with research directors from
computer and Silicon Valley firms including
Microsoft, Apple, and Xerox, to discuss how communication platforms can be used to build what he

The name Beyond the Box has
particular significance to the conference organizers. "We're trying
to get beyond simply numerical diversity on campus, beyond just getting higher numbers of minorities,"
says Chikkatur. The forum will be
a place to discuss ideas for increasing institutional support of diversity, such as, for instance, adding
Primary Distribution Requirement
courses to Black Studies and increasing the number of faculty of
color, says Chikkatur.
In addition, the title Beyond the

says Chikkatur.

The conference officially opens

Hail the Dining Services Crusade
The oldest of college cliches is the poor quality ofthe food, while
the oldest of Swarthmore cliches is our campus' abundance needless
and ultimately purposeless discussion and misery poker. Together,
these make for a potent combination of undirected rhetoric about
the poor quality of Sharpies food and the attendant limitations of
Tarble, thealternative by default. While barely a Sharpies meal goes
by without some comment as to its low quality, such commentary
serves little purpose. As self-evident as the students of this college
find the poor quality of the food served in Sharpies and the miserly
amounts of credit and food provided at Tarble as an alternative, this
message rarely reaches administrators. While sporadic comments
to Linda McDougal, the Director of Dining Services, may present a
facade ofactivism, they have accomplished little. Simply complaining about food does little, clearly enunciated suggestions presented
through Swarthmore's corridors of power are the wisest and most
visible solution.
A meeting held on February Bth strongly supported the ideas of
extending $3.75 Tarble credit, rather than allowing it to drop to $2.25
after 8:00 PM, serving healthier food, and providing the full complement of food throughout the posted mealtimes. It also supported
restructuring the Dining Services Committee so that itresembles the
College Planning Committee, thereby raising it visibility and hence
accountability. While the middle two are simple policy matters which
are technically supposed to be in effect, the first runs up against the
rationale behind decreasing Tarble credit: lowering credit will lower
the number of people who eat at Tarble.
As anyone who has seen the half-hour long lines during the 7:008:00 period knows th'aOowering credit (besides being financially
unfair) does nothing to decrease demand. Rather, it simply squeezes
those people interested in eating at Tarble into even less time, causing more confusion and inefficiency. Fortunately, the campaign has
met with some success, McDougal has already begun sending out
the week's menu and guaranteed that there will no longer be nights
when both bars serve fried food. She has been extremely receptive
to the students' other requests, setting a positive precedent for cooperation. It is our hope that this progress, which represents the success of concerted action by concerned students, and a respectful administration open to suggestions, will continue.

An Invigorating Tradition
screw Your Roommate, the February formal which graces campus each year, is a Swarthmore tradition that affords Swatties the
chance to loosen up, smell the roses, and take life a little less seriously, if onlyfor one evening. Screw provides a much needed break
from Swarthmore intensity that many of us would neglect to take if
not provided with this opportunity. Because it has come to be such a
tradition on campus, participation tends to be widespread and, as a
result, Swatties who would usually spend their Saturday night hitting the books are encouraged by friends and roommates to join in.
The often self-defacing Sharpies portion of Screw during which dates
reveal their identity to each other by doing something embarrassing
is a definite strength of the event. It gives Swatties a sense of perspective by reminding us that we are 18 to 22 year olds who need to
have fun; it gives us the chance to take ourselves less seriously.
Screw contributes to the social atmosphere at Swarthmore in more
ways than just bringing us out of our shells. It affords us the chance
to go on a real date in an environment that otherwise is not at all
conducive to dating. With Swat gossip levels out of sight, the inaccessibility of cars, and only one "date place" on campus (Paces),
casual dating at Swarthmore is all but extinct. Screw addresses all
three of these issues.
Since everyone is involved, the gossiping that occurs is acceptable
and expected and since the dance is held in Upper Tarble, transportation is not a concern. Finally, Screw is a positive addition to the
Swarthmore sense of community. Even if romantic ties are not
formed, it gives Swatties the opportunity to get to know other
Swatties who we might not meet otherwise. With so much to gain
from spending Saturday, February 28, getting screwed, there is no
excuse for any Swattie to pass up this opportunity. The Phoenix
issues a campus-wide appeal to fully immerse in the spirit of Screw!
With the formal less than two weeks away, keep this fact in mind:
one in six Swatties marry another Swattie...maybe you Screw date
will be the man/woman of your dreams!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Detractors of Pamphlet Don't Offer
Concrete Evidence, Says Revisionist
To the Editor.
ThePhoenix (News Analysis, 2/13) reports
that President Bloom ("himself Jewish")
states that I wrote my article "The Holocaust
Controversy: The Case for Open Debate" to
"express [my] personal prejudices," and that
I have an "anti-Semitic agenda," a smallminded ad hominemassault that I dismiss out
of hand. It's the kind of thing you overhear
in your local butcher shop.
PresidentBloom apparently did not address
any specific statement or language in the text
of my article, but was content to slander me.
In this he is following the precedent set by
his academic peers, together with special-interest pressure groups such as the two mentioned in the Phoenix article: The Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith (ADL), and
its campus front, Hillel.
College presidents and their professors have
had six years to correct the errors of fact contained in my article (it was first published in
the Daily Northwestern in 1991) but have
failed to do it. Why? Because if an error of
fact is discovered in the article I'll correct it.
What then? The professors and their presidents will be left with what's left over. What
are they going to do with all the statements
of "revisionist" fact that are left over?
The "Holocaust" is not one story but a vast
collection of documents, testimony, and
yarns. Some ofit is true and some of it isn't.
How ordinary! Revisionist theory addresses
those documents and outs those that can be
shown to be fabrications. It addresses eyewitness testimony and outs that which can be

shown to be mere invention, or worse. If
President Bloom's professors were doing it, I
wouldn't have to.
The use of slander by those in authority
against those of us who doubt what they say
we must believe is the response of the petty
tyrant. Academics, pledging* their, allegiance
to orthodoxy rathe'rthan to*open debate, have
become mere patriots of the Holocaust, the
last refuge on campus for the intellectual
scoundrel. Rather than trusting themselves
to the processes of free inquiry, they turn to
supermarket tabloid psychologizing to convince students to avoid the texts that their professors themselves vilify
for reasons the
professors are not called upon to reveal.
Meanwhile, revisionist theory is metastasizing (I love giving the profs a straight line) all
over the place. When I opened my website
on the Internet two years ago we were getting
forty and fifty hits a day. Now, every 24 hours,
close to 2000 revisionist documents are accessed on our site alone. Slander is a wonderfully effective tool in the hands of our college presidents (I know!), but in a free society an honest search for truth is even more
potent.
When students become aware that their professors and their professors' leaders are evading the specific language of the text they condemn, thus replacing education with indoctrination, I think they will be a little disappointed with the intellectual level of the college they are attending.

I admit it, I'm interested in Bill Clinton's
penis. It may justbe the most interesting thing
: about the
man. What's sad is that he makes it
his most interesting feature â€”by making the

but does he have passion? (Get your mind out

when was the last timethat the man said something that would stick withyou, make you turn

something not

2 build a bipartisan coalition and "get things
done" but he neglects to mention that he takes
all the fun, not to mention content, out of polil tics when he does that.
I've no doubt that I will be berated for bemoaning the current state of political discourse
and then attacking one of the few men who is
even on the fringe of interesting. I maintain
; that this only goes to prove my point. Consider this analogy. The circus freak is spellvbmding, you can't take your eyes offhim, you
listen to every word that comes out of his
that's what makes him a good cirmouth
cus freak. Likewise, Clinton can deliver a
speech in a manner that grabs people's attention, he can make you listen to him, but I'm
not willing to admit those criteria as what
makes a good politician. Catching people's attention is good, but not so that they can see a
sideshow. Let's catch theirattention with clever

People disagree about politics. If you disagree
with this statement, then head to Parrish Parlors on Mondays at 7pm for the SCU meeting.
Sorry to be so elementary, but I'm in a bit of a
muddle. If people disagree about things that
are supposed to be important, then why don't
they say so? Is our nation really so repressed
that we can't just stand up and say how we
feel? Do we really need to hide behind studies
that "prove" that we are statistically right about
this thing or that thing? Take responsibility for
your beliefs, and force others to do the same.
The British have got one thing figured out
(well, two if you count tea). The have this
amazing knack of insulting each other in parliament. Their insults make wonderful earlymorning-wake-up-and-get-out-of-bed radio,
and they reinforce the connection (not to mention respect) that people with their elected
members of parliament. True or no, it really
does seem like these people care about what
they are fighting aboutâ€”why else would they
engage in personal attacks?
I'm not talking about negative advertising
type of things here; some smooth voice-over
!with pictures of starving children doesn't
! count. Let me give an example. In 1964, Parliament was debating nuclear weapons as a
:deterrent. George Edward Cecil made the following statement, "For Honorable Members
â€¢opposite, the deterrent is a phallic symbol. It
convinces them that they are men." Clever, eh?
;The speaker didn't even catch it soon enough
to rule it out of order.
One can hardly claim that this kind of attack â€¢
is the type that engenders strong resentment.
It is clever. It makes a point. If you can't shake
it off (or better yet, come back with an even
wittier comeback), then you justignore it, and
"sit strong in the truth of your views". The
British Parliament has some strict rules about
proper modes of respectful address, but that
doesn't stop the members of parliament from
inventing ever more clever ways of trying to
get around them. Everyone understands that
these aren't to be taken personally
they are
just part of the job.
This part of the job makes the whole organization much more interesting. What constituency would not want to hear a clever and witty
thing come out of their representative's mouth?
It shows that not only is the representative
paying attention, but that in some way she is
passionate about what's going on in front of
heir. The Republicans drone on about the "fiscal realities" of democratic programs, the
Democrats accuse the Republicans of starving the children of the nation, but no one
sounds like they believe in what they are saying. How can you when you're phrasing it in
such a horribly dull way? I've had math professors more interesting.
This is, as I said, not by any means only a
Democrat's problem. Trent Lott may well be
the most boring man I've ever heard. I'm quite
certain that the most boring man in existence
is certainly a conservative. In truth, one of the
most interesting politicians ofour time, Barney
and he really is quite
Frank, is a liberal
clever. The whole attitude of politics is wrong.
The nation wants some actionâ€”but it appears
that Bill's got the corner on that.

Reagan. When playing word association games involving Ronald Reagan and airport, the first combination that leaps to mind is his replacement of striking airport traffic controllers in 1981. This signalled
the beginning of a long decline in theAmerican labor
movement that lasted until last year's successful UPS
strike.
The added irony of the act, which set labor solidly
against "The Great Communicator" and his heirs, was
that PATCO (the union in question), was the only
union to endorse Reagan in the 1980presidential election. The irony is not the first of its kind involving
President Reagan and public edifices: just last year
the Ronald Reagan Federal Office Building in Washington, DC opened its doors as the second largest
Federal building (after Reagan's beloved Pentagon).
Among its occupants are some staff members of one
of Reagan's least favorite federal agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency.
Besides its flimsy role as an 87th birthday present
to the Gipper, why incur the bureaucratically wasteful expense of renaming a newly reopened (complete
with new signage) airport in honor of big
government's most celebrated foe? Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer once proposed a Cold
War Memorial, with Reagan among the "heroes" to
be commemorated. Yet, besides being fortunate
enough to be the man who had the opportunity to tell
his Soviet counterpart: "Mr. Gorbachev tear down this
wall," he didn't do much. While Reagan's detente
and securing of the START treaties certainly helped
matters, a close investigation reveals that it was
Gorbachev's acceptance of the inevitability of democratization from within that led to the collapse of the
Soviet Bloc.
Giventhe hollowness ofclaims that he won the Cold
War, Reagan's presidency was not extraordinary. As
Swarthmore alumnus Michael Dukakis noted during
a 1988 debate with Reagan's Vice President George
Bush, the national debt grew more under President
Reagan than every other President from Washington
to Carter combined. These policies, which have resulted in annual interest in excess of 300 billion dollars have left the country with a series of unbalanced
budgets that have only exacerbated die problem. Even
in the time of the present "surplus," the debt still requires servicing and its principal remains a constant
burden on future generations of American taxpayers.
Reagan's economic policies led directly to a recession during his successor George Bush's single term.
In view of the results ofhis presidency and his policies, it would have made the most sense to rename
the Pentagon after Reagan, or certainly, an Air Force
base. No peacetime president did as much for the
defense industry. While the idea of renaming an airport in Reagan's honoris as hilariously ironic to those
who remember his dealings with PATCO as the
Ronald Reagan Federal Office Building is to those
who remember his crusades against big government.
On a less humorous level, the renaming is an insult to
the air-traffic controllers and an unsubtle piece of propaganda. In decades to come, people will think of
the Ronald Reagan Airport as they do of Fiorello
LaGuardia Airport in New York: "He must have done
something good to have an airport named after him."
Only in the case ofLaGuardia would they be correct

Take a Break From Activism
by Benjamin Chan
On April 10, 1899, Theodore Roosevelt
delivered an historic speech in praise of "the
strenuous life," denouncing "those poor
spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much,
because they live in the gray twilight that
knows not victory nor defeat." I think
America is finally ready to be told that
Teddy was wrong.
I am one of those poor souls who dwell
in the gray mist of twilight, not so much in
enjoyment as in contentment. Sure, contentment ain't much fun, but what has fun
done for us lately? Fun belongs to the realm
of victory and defeat. Victory and defeat
belong to the realm of games, sports, contests, fights and wars. So, Teddy, pardon

me for not partaking in the wonderful
world of war.
I concede that the land of twilight
breeds inaction, but I ask you: what's
so bad about inaction? Okay, nothing
gets done when we're inactive, and
Swarthmore is all about social action
this, social action that. But there's really nothing all that spectacular about
action per se. It's a purely aesthetic
choice; I happen to think stillness is
nicer than all of that here, there, everywhere, action stuff.
Most importantly, it is literally impossible to harm someone through inaction.. Every single act of evil in the
history of mankind has been the result
of an action of one human upon another.

Slavery, war, genocides, imperialismâ€”all human actions. If everyone would
just stop, sit, close their eyes and do
nothing, mankind's long-fancied dream
of Utopia would at long last be realized!
Of course, there are some practical
problems. I have had balance problems
of late, and I am not sure whether it's
an inner ear problem or it's that I've
gotten to lazy to stand up. But since
when have practical problems stood in
the way of a man's dream of Utopia?
So go ahead T.S. Eliot, call me a hollow man, but that means I make a nice
sound when you tap me with a stick,
and there aren't many men around who
can truthfully say that.

long-range planning, with several College
Planning Committee subgroups attempting
to explore and define the future of Swarthmore in all areas, including staffing.
Some staff members have taken this opportunity to push for more voice in the community, more well-defined systems for airing grievances, and better general communication between the administration and the
staff.
"This long term planning was a great possibility to address all those conditions," said

Professor of Russian Thompson Bradley,

Kalwaic. The College has recently made

another member of the ad hoc committee.
"[Our ideals] in terms of the long-range
planning process is that it be open and the
COSP be able to relate for themselves," said
Chijioke.
Another change pushed for in the letter is
a published salary schedule, the absence of
which exemplifies the lack of communication between the staff and the administration.
"Unless you have a published salary
schedule there us no way of knowing how
you could move up on the scale," said

some movement towards publishing pay
schedules. Aslanian noted at the meeting
Friday that justlast year Swarthmore started
publishing the minimum wages for all job

opportunities.
There are also questions about staff levels and grades. "The present system for
grading staff positions is outdated and unevenly applied," states the letter. "We consider it essential for staff at all levels and in
all areas of College activity to participate
actively in the development of a new system."

"The [grievance] procedures are extremely well developed for students and
faculty, why shouldn't they be that waj* for

The letter also presses for a higher rftinimum wage within the College, though
Kalwaic did not know how many employees this might affect.
The staffing issue can be expected to continue to unfold next Thursday when the final open meeting with the SLRPC takes
place. A location for the scheduled meeting is not yet known.

Also brought up are the base wage,

Crummy Advice
THE BEAR

(as

told to KATIE MENZER)

Dear Bear,

The other morning, I opened up my bureau drawer

>to get

out a pair of clean underwear, when, to my

surprise, there was none left! I had just done laundry
2 weeks ago! If my calculations are correct, and they
always are, I should have had 15 pairs left.
I started frantically searching the room for my renegade shorts. I looked in my other drawers, in the
bottom ofmy closet, and even in my desk. My roommate, John, saw my exasperation and asked me what
was wrong. I told him I couldn't find my underwear.
He agreed to help me look. We searched for another
half hour. John even went down the laundry room to
see if I had left it there.
When he got back, he said, "Well, there's nothing
down there. I can't imagine where ALL your underwear could have gone."
I responded, "Neither can I. But it's not ALL my
underwear. It's justALL my clean underwear, about
15 pairs."
"Oh," said John, "That's sounds about right..."
"What 'sounds right'?"
"Well, I've been wearing your underwear for the
last two weeks or so."
"You've been wearing my underwear!?!" I exclaimed.
"Yeah, I didn't think you'd mind."
I was so angry, I stormed out of the room, and we
haven't spoken since.What couldhe have been thinking? He's my best friend, but I can't put up with this.
What should I do?

Thanks,

The Black Writers Conference, a series of lectures,
workshops, readings and other events, was held this
past weekend in Philadelphia. It explored the evolution of black writing in the United States, as well as
its current issuesand future goals. The conference included a panel discussion moderated by June Jordan,
the well-known poet who gave several readings last
semester on the Swarthmore campus. The panel featured Omar Tyree, a fiction writer; Kimmika L. Williams, a poet and playwright; Charles O'Harris a publisher; Irene Smalls, a children's writer; Ralph Wylie,
a journalist and a nonfiction writer; and the Dark
Room Collective, a group ofAfrican American poets
and fiction writers. Three Swarthmore students who
attended, Maurisa Thompson, Kia Hayes and Kim
Foote, recently met together and reviewed the conference in a round-table discussion.
Maurisa: What did you like about the conference?
Kia: What I liked about the conference was just the
fact that it existed. I am an aspiring black writer, and
it was nice to be in a room filled with black intellectuals and writers who sort of laid down their wisdom
upon the people who were there, and laid down the
history of black writers in this country; it was a very
powerful and inspirational time.
Kim: I liked the fact that the conference gave me
the opportunity to connect with different writers. It
also gave me the opportunity to see some very successful black writers; that really encouraged and motivated me because I'm also an aspiring writer. And it
just felt really great to see these black people who
had come from where I had come from and are now

doing the things that I would hope to do some day.
Kia: So what about the workshops?
Kim: Well, I attended the fiction workshop led by
Omar Tyree and it was really' interesting. He talked
about how he writes his novels. . .once he has an
idea he makes an outline, gets more ideas and
and a book is formed. That
thoughts from that
was really interesting, but I think the most important
thing that I got out ofit was that he talked about how
he got started. I believe he graduated from Howard
University [with] a degree in communications, and
how he got started was that he produced his own
books. He would go to writers' conferences and
things like that to show his books around, and he
would be very verbal, very expressive and aggressive, and this is how people were attracted to him
and took interest in his works. And he was saying
that probably the most important thing that you want
to do as a writer is develop an image, and I thought
that was very [meaningful].
Kia: Maurisa and I attended the drama workshop
with Kimmika L. Williams; she was a very outgoing
person, very dynamic, had a lot ofenergy, and she's
been really [involved in] the poetry scene, but she
has this new play at the Adriane, called "Dog Days
the Legend of Obi Kato." Obi Kato is a historical
figure in black life in Philadelphia.
Maurisa: She really helped us to think about doing
dramatic writing, and it was really encouraging to
hear her say that writing poetry is a good place to
start writing plays, because you are [already so] specific about language.
Kia: She said if you are a poet, to make that transition into being a playwright is very easy because
[you] already have this 'command' on brevity, which

is good for dialogue. Also, she talked about how hard
it is for African-American playwrights in Philadelphia
to get their stuff shown to the public. She mentioned
that in Philadelphia there are only two places that show
African-American plays by African-American people
the Bushfire Theater in West Philadelphia, and Freedom Theater in North Philadelphia, and she said that it
is especially hard for African American female playwrights to get their stuff shown and taken seriously.
Hard, but not impossible.
Maurisa: What about the panel?
Kia: I think [one of] the people who really stood out
for me was Irene Smalls, who was the children's book
writer. She writes books for African-American youth,
and she really hit it home when she said [that] black
people need to see their images, especially at a very
young and impressionable age... This foundation can
only increase self esteem and self value. And that really hit home; as a young African-American girl growing up it was rare that I would actually get the opportunity to see images of myself reflected; and [this] made
it a period of time which was very uncomfortable and
very isolating, so Irene Smalls made a good point of
promoting black images in black children's stories...
Another person who made a great impression upon me
was June Jordan, and her comments about the state of
black writing now. She compared it to the black writers' movement years ago during the 60's; how back
then black writers were more politically motivated
within their poetry and stories. And she sees within the
90's the state ofblack writing as being very based upon
individualistic success and motivation, and the politics
in the writing as lacking; she made the whole question
of 'what are we writing for?' an issue and I found that

Sub-Pop Records

Willie Wisely's newest album, Turbosherbet, has a
lot more octane in it than did his previous couple solo
releases, but it's still full of his characteristic pop genius and unabashed heterosexuality. The twelve tracks
are, as is usual with his work, quite varied, and here
they are primarily a mixture of hard-edged rock and
jazz. His producer and good buddy John "Strawberry"
Fields, frontman of the neo-funk band Greazy Meal,
plays most of the instruments, while Wisely focuses
most of his talent on the beautiful vocals and eclectic
songwriting.
Most of the album is electric, and when it's electric,
it's all-out nasty electric. Wisely's sound is at its fuzziest and most jagged in this effort, and when his conventional instruments just don't have the grind he needs,
he gets Fields to crank out some supplementary computer noises that push his work just to the brink of palatability. None of this excess noise is ill-conceived,
however. It doesn't obscure the beautiful hooks and
cadences of Wisely's music so much as emphasize them.
The album is certainly pop, but it belongs nowhere near
the shallow bubblegum that gets published everyday in
indie rock land. Wisely exhibits a freshness, an honesty, and an exuberance that are difficultto find in most
indie-pop these days.
Part of the excitement must be due to his subject matter; Wisely sings glibly about sex, then love, then lovemaking, clearly displaying his unbridledenthusiasm for
themwith a wit and a sass few can manage. The sexual
fervor and anxiety of an adolescent Willie is complemented by the intelligence and taste of a seasoned
songsmith. Songs like "She Said Yeah," "Flower for
the Lady," "So Turned On," and "Sleeping with Girls"
show us that he's a total romantic, that he knows it,
and, what's more, that he's totally proud of it.

Dear Bear,
I'm taking five anthropology classes this semester, and I have no time to do laundry. I ran out of
underwear a few weeks ago, so I borrowed some from
my Roommate, Marc. Since we're best friends and
we share everything, I didn'tthink he'd mind. I guess
f was wrong. He's really angry at me and won't talk
to me anymore. I'd offer to let him wear some of
mine, but I don't think he'd accept since my underwear isn't as pretty as his. What should I do?

Useful. That was my first thought upon reaching the
end of godheadSilo's latest album, Share the Fantasy.
I liked some of what went on in the CD, possibly because they have a sound I've never really heard in any
other group. They have a really good, primal grind going on in their music thatreminds me a lot of the sound
that I like in early proto-punk bands like The Stooges
and The Modern Lovers. On the other hand, it's also
very different, because, for one thing, godheadSilo is
guitarless. It's a pair of two guys, Mike on bass and
Dan on drums, both from Fargo, North Dakota. They
do fine without a guitar, however, and for a duo, they
really make a huge sound. From what I understand, the
pair is dwarfed in concert by the size of their amplification equipment; Mike's bass rig is a gigantic thing, and
Dan's kick drum is taller than he is.
Aside from the guitar's absence, they are different from
most early punk, or from their self-proclaimed heavymetal influences, in that their sound is hardly melodic.
It is focused on long grooves of loud, distorted bass and
heavy percussion that almost covers up the indecipherable yellings of both guys. The movements of sound
are well-executed, but probably the album derives its
greatest merit from the pure volume and depth of the
sound; the overamplification adds its own complexity
to the music, changing what might otherwise be a simply uninteresting tonal randomness into something
explorable. The problem is that this only stays interesting for a while. The album is useful when one is in the
mood to explore the sonic excess of Mike and Dan's
work, but the rewards diminish after a while, and the
sound just becomes oppressive. There are some good
experiences here: "Time to Feed the Pythons" and "In
the Air Tonight," a Phil Collins cover, are especially
worth listening to.

This is an album with three dudes ripping it up. The technical skill
of the musicians is unremarkable, and their style is a kind of standard
alterna-metal deal, a lot like the stuff put out by bands like Tool and
King's X. There are a few interesting parts of the music where they
develop a mood that seems about to go somewhere, but usually these
passages are interrupted by a burst of undirected teen energy or a toointrospective guitar solo. There are a lot of good ideas that go undeveloped; one track, "Daily Bread," has a really cool anthemic thing
going for a while at the beginning, and it had my complete attention
until the band suddenly lost their testosterone balance, expanding the
guitar work to metal proportions and overlaying the music with a yelled
chorus ofall three guys. The band uses a lot of sound samples (wind,
water, seagulls) to spice up their work, but the technique really doesn't
seem to jive with the music.
The second track, "Flashback" is prefaced with a very lengthy segment of druggy dialogue from Cheech and Chong's movie Up in Smoke,
which is certainly a strong testament to the band's respect for the comic
duo, but contributes little to the strength of the album. Stem's work
certainly shows some promise at times, but the band has not as yet
found a way to distinguish itself from all the other rockin' dudes that
are out there.

On the day after Valentine's, The Spice
Women were aware that though we didn't have
love, we had our food.. .So, in perfect time for
our next Phoenix column we rose early Sunday morning and headed off to Chinatown for
Dim Sum. Rachel, Mary Jeanand Arati had all
had Dim Sum before, but for Cayley and Joanna
it was a new experience.
Arati wore her new high heeled boots (trying
to achieve the full Spice effect) but hadn't quite
broken them in yet. Incidentally, the restaurant is located a short walk away from the Market East Septa Station. Taking thetrain is probably a better idea than driving. You'll appreciate the walk at the end of the meal, when you
realize you've eaten one too many Dim Sum
dishes.
After pushing through a mass of people to
make it into the actual dining area, we were
seated in a large room next to the door, which
afforded us a pleasant February draft throughout the meal. Dim Sum is traditionally an informal, leisurely Chinese brunch. At most restaurants it is a whirlwind of activity with people
moving about all the time, attended by couples,
friends, as well as entire families. The Imperial Inn was no exception. Many families came
and brought their young children and babies.
This activity could conceivably be noisy and
annoying, but the room was large enough to
accommodate it. Rather than ordering everything you want at the beginning of the meal,
initially, you only order your selection of tea.
Dim Sum is an informal conglomeration of
small dishes selected individually. As a side
note to vegetarians, most of the Dim Sum
dishes, with a few notable exceptions, do have
meat in them and you might want to order an
additional vegetarian dish from the menu. Otherwise, waiters are constantly sailing around
theroom, pushing little metal carts offood. One
cart might have soups, piping hot with steam
coming out of the canisters; another cart might
have shrimp, chicken, or vegetable dumplings,
a variety of rice dishes, jellos, roasted pork
buns, spare ribs
the list goes on. The tricky
is
to
part trying get the attention of a waiter as
he or she rushes by you. When you select a
dish, your server adds it to your tab but beware, while none of the dishes are more than
five dollars, they add up, and unless you look
at your tab or ask, you won't know how much
money each dish costs. The small Dim Sum
dishes are only $ 1.90 but the slightly larger ones
are a little more expensive.
The first dish we sampled was sticky rice
with meat wrapped in lotus leaves. The lotus
gave the rice an interesting taste which both Jo
and Arati described as "dusty." A dessert cart
came around next and none of us could resist
the moist cake we saw. It was similar to
cornbread except it was sweeter and didn'tcontain any corn. We thought butter was probably
the "secret ingredient" that made it especially
delectable. (Okay, so it wasn't exactly a lowsee Dim

Valentine's day love
Cathy Muller
story...or is it?
On February 14, the infamous holiday of love, LPAC theater was packed with
couples and a few lonely hearts seeking an hour of
entertainment from the chamber choir, pit orchestra,
singers, and dance students in their collaboration performance ofDido andAeneas. The third event in the
FebFest series, it certainly provided entertainment,
with ample moments of both humor and sorrow, romance and wickedness.
The operatold the classic story ofDido and Aeneas,
tragic lovers whose affair is broken when Mercury
brings a message from die gods telling Aeneas he must
leave to go found Rome. In the opera, the story has
the added twist of a sorceress who sets up the plan to
unite and then divide the lovers. This is accomplished
by her mischievous coven, who provide the audience
with delightful humor as well. Aeneas feels that he
must follow the god's command, and Dido is distraught that this man, whom she had so much difficulty trusting in, has betrayed her trust. She will not
accept him back, even when he tells her that he has
changed his mind, and so the opera ends in sorrow.
Aeneas heads off to found Rome and Dido kills herselffrom grief. Although the audience knew this end
would come, the final moments of the dance were so
touching that many left the theater with tears in their
eyes. As the orchestra played on, Dido lay beneath a
scarlet cape as red flowers were dropped from above
and die dancers moved behind the scrim in a sorrowful parade.
This ending was only one of the many surprises that
even those who had seen both the dance concert and
the chamber choir performance of this piece last semester had in store for them. One delightful surprise
was the use of masks, which served to emphasize the
dilemma that Aeneas faces over his identity
whether he will define himself as a lover or do his
duty to the gods. Another addition was the use of
two levels, one of which was behind the scrim. These
created another dimension, which allowed the audience to separate the background action from the more
important action in front In this way, the action behind the scrim set die mood while that in front of the
scrim told die plot of the story. One other pleasant
surprise was the chamber choir's incredibly powerful and sickening interpretation of the witches' chorus.
Most surprising of all, however, was the electricity
of connection that one felt between the chorus, orchestra, singers, and dancers. The music and live
voices gave new energy, as well as context, to the
dance, while the dance provided a delight for the eyes
that even the most animated choir could never provide. Rather than detracting from each otherand taking the audience's attention away from one another,
the different elements of the performance complemented each other exquisitely, providing all with a
rich cultural experience.

Sandler Hits High Note with The Wedding Singer
Thanks to the marketing
department of New Line
Cinema, two weeks ago I
was sitting 5 feet away from
Adam Sandler and Drew
Barrymore as they talked
about their new movie, The
Wedding
Singer, which is a
Altered States
love letter to the 80's. While
Patrick Runkle
listening to Sandler talk
he uses his trademarkfake kid-voice at all times
it
occurred to me that Sandler is just like a fart noise:
sometimes he's funny and sometimes he's not.
In The Wedding Singer, Sandler plays Robbie Hart,
an aspiring rock star in 1985 who makes a living by
being a not-incredibly-talented wedding singer. When
he gets stood up at the altar during his own wedding,
his life falls into disarray until he meets a beautiful
waitress (Drew Barrymore), who, unfortunately, is engaged to marry another man.
Anyone familiar with Sandler knows that his songs
are the centerpoint of most of his comedy, and The
Wedding Singer gives him a chance to perform on
numerous occasions. His own material is typically
ridiculous, and his performances of 80's hits, like "You
Spin Me Round (Like a Record)," are filled with a
kind of karaoke energy that made me laugh.
Some of the smaller moments in The Wedding Singer
are the funniest, like the cameo appearances by Billy
Idol, Jon Lovitz, and Steve Buscemi. And, of course,
no Adam Sandler movie would be complete without
elderly people doing funny things; The Wedding
Singer doesn't disappoint by featuring a 70-year-old
rapping.
The romantic aspect ofThe Wedding Singer is something different for Sandler. All of his trademark jokes

Kia: Jim the black man...
Maurisa: ...the black man, the hero and the

Kia: I mean, a white man writing about a
black man in the 1880's couldn't say "oh,

form of language.
Kim: And the main point that Wylie

find something.
Maurisa: You can read anything, you just

There will be a special poetry event to celebrate Black history taking place at the
Deshong museum Feb. 22, 3-6 p.m., between 9th and 10th streets on Avenue of the

calorie meal.)
Mary Jean selected a dish she described as a "rice stew" which she
though, after tasting it, we would all just love. It had a pretty thick
consistency (like a soupy glue) and was pretty bland. She renewed our
faith in her, however, by picking out a pork dish that was a lot better.
What initially looked like a puff pastry turned out to be soft bread encapsulating some shredded pork. It had a barbecue flavor, but it was
much sweeter. Some barbeque-like chicken on a skewer came around
next and it had a slightly spicy taste to it. It was a big hit with the meat
eaters in the group.
Next a cart with shrimp spring rolls and shrimp balls came around.
The shrimp rolls had mainly shrimp in themand no shredded vegetables.
The shrimp balls were both yummy and deep-fried. Next, we sampled
shrimp and chicken dumplings at which point Jo expressed her concern
that she might soon turn into a fish if she ate any more seafood.
For dessert (number two) in addition to the cake which we ordered
again, we chose almond and coconut jellos, as well as a sticky bun.
Not everybody likes jello and jello-like consistency, but this desert was
light and cool in our mouths after the tasty, but heavy meal weighing at
the bottom of our stomachs.
We highly recommend Dim Sum because the food is probably a little
more traditional than what you might order out from ChinaMoon. Also,
it can be very cheap, especially if you go with a large group of people.
We paid nine dollars a person, but we thought that it could have been
less expensive if we hadn't felt compelled to try every dish that went by
us. Dim Sum is, inherently, a leisurely meal, and might offer a nice
escape (at least for a few hours) from Swat.

In the Pool With
ELIZABETH NEWCOMB

Draw Near

byJillÃŸelding

by Wendy Kemp
Between swimmers spending semesters abroad and injuries, the women's swim team was facing a difficult semester especially in the butterfly events. Instead ofrelinquishing these events to the other teams, sophomore Elizabeth Newcomb rose to the challenge. Newcomb has
dropped two seconds in her 100 butterfly and almost six
seconds in her 200 butterfly this season. These time drops
have established Newcomb as a top finisher.
Newcomb's improvement appeared at the ideal time for
Swarthmore, but even without the situation on the women's
team, her times might have dropped. The dire situation of
the team may have been one of the driving factors, but
Newcomb's own initiative is certainly a major force.
Newcomb was a consistent performer during her freshman year, contributing in the butterfly events, but had yet
to reach her peak. Her times unfortunately had remained

The season is drawing to a close. Yet
with the annual PAIAW tournament at
Bryn Mawr on Saturday, and a match
against Bryn Athyn on Tuesday night, the
women's' badminton team was far from
idle. With one conference match and the
Northeastern Collegiate Tournament left
to go, the tension mounts for the highlycoveted number one spot in the conference. Bryn Mawr, last year's champs, trail
at a dismal fourth, with Bryn Athyn
slightly ahead. This year's crown will fall
either to Swarthmore or Albright.
Although Swarthmore achieved high
standings in the PAIAW tournaments of
the past, this year's final scores were not
as impressive. However, morale was high
and a good time was had by all. The high
point of the day was the victory of first
doubles team JenniferChen '99 and Erika
Johansen '99, over all the other doubles
combinations in the tournament. Rated
the number one seed, Chen and Johansen
exceeded all expectations to easily capture the championships, surpassing all of
die Bryn Mawr, Bryn Athyn, and Albright

duos.
Tuesday's match against Bryn Athyn
had the team both tense and excited. Although armed with a previous victory, the
Swarthmore women knew that Bryn
Athyn had felled Albright once, something that Swarthmore has not done yet
this year. However, the women faced the
odds and conquered them, winning by a
narrow 3-2 margin.
First singles Tarn Doan '9B losther first
game 9-11, but quickly struck back and
improved by leaps and bounds in the two
succeeding matches, winning them 11-8,
11-6. Wendy Kemp '99 at second singles
finished off her Bryn Athyn counterpart
withrecord speed, 11-7,11-5, while third
singles Ani Hsieh '99 battled for every
point before meeting defeat. At first
doubles, Johansenand Chen were unable
to duplicate their Saturday feat at Bryn
Mawr, falling to their opponents only after a long match of smashes, drops and
high clears.
But by far the heroines of the day were
second doubles team Siobhan Carty 'Ol
and Jane Ng 'Ol. As both Swarthmore and
Bryn Athyn had won two matches, the
duo's game was the deciding factor. With
one win on each side going into the third
game, all membersof both teams, as well
as coaches and parents, had their eyes
fastened on the Fearless Frosh. After a
halfhour and numerous smashes from Ng
and drops from Carty, the score rested at
14-12, Swarthmore. One more point was
needed as Carty stepped up to serve
amidst the silence. The resulting rally was
long and fast, with the birdie turning into
no more than a blur of white and red as

stagnant.

Two More Losses Extend
Drought for Men's B-Ball Team
by Pat Donaghy

both teams scrambled in their haste to
keep it afloat. A moderate clear down the
middle put Carty on the offense; she
smashed the birdie into the doubles lane,
right on the line. The game was over:
Swarthmore had triumphed, 3-2. The
team's record soared to 4-1.
With the PAIAW tournament and the
tense Bryn Athyn match behind them, the
team eagerly awaits the final showdown
with Albright College on Thursday. The
last match against Albright resulted in a
very narrow loss, so this coming confrontation can easily go either way. Both colleges have a 4-1 record, and the winner
of this next match will walk away as the
conference champions.

Sophomore Joe Culley looks for an opening to make a shot. The mens basketball
team dropped two conference games to Dickinson and Muhlenburg bringing
their record to 0-22.

Poor Defense Plagues Women's B-Ball
by Jean Quinn
The women's basketball team enjoyed a smooth victory over
Immaculata last week, but dropped
two tough conference matches to
slide to 7-15 overall, 2-12 in the Centennial Conference. The Garnet were
routed handily by Ursinus, 72-59, in
a home-court contest and were
crushed by defending conference
champs Muhlenberg, 54-27, on Tuesday in Allentown. The Garnet hope
to finish their season with a definitive victory over Haverford tomorrow.
The Garnet fared well against
Immaculata and cruised to a 64-54
win. While fouls plagued some players, the team united to persevere and
hold on to their lead. The team's leading scorer, Heather Marandola 'Ol
matched her career-high 22 points

While in high school, Newcomb was considerably older
than her teammates and thus not involved in the team aspect of the sport. She was used to swimming alone, and
instead chose to focus on personal betterment. "I had to
swim for myself," said Newcomb, "and thus I was swimming for the next time to beat or meet to make." Practice
was merely a means to an end, competition rather was her
interest. "Swimming had become a habit for me," she
added.
Newcomb came to college with hopes for a "different
environment, one that was more social" than her past experience. Freshman year was a disappointment. Finally
she came to the revelation thatit was her overindependence
was getting in the way of her improvement.
"I began to realize that I needed others to improve," she
said. As a result of the mental shift, for the first time, at
the beginning of the season, she felt more relaxed. She
began to fully immerse in the team spirit of practice. "I
had just taken the pressure off myself," said Newcomb, "I
feel like I'm part of the team now."
Her new attitude coupled with her already apparent need
for competition resulted in amazing swims thus far. Last
year, Newcomb finished in consolation finalsofher events
(100 and 200 butterfly, 200 backstroke) at the conference
meet. This year, Newcomb heads into the conference meet
ranked fifth in the 200 butterfly, her strongest event. Given
the had amount of work and the support of her team,
Newcomb shouldrise to yet another challenge this weekend at Centennials.

and notched four steals. Jean Quinn
'99 added 14 points and matched her
personal best on the boards, pulling
down 17 rebounds. Michelle Walsh
'9B added 11 points and Kristen English 'Ol chipped in 8.
Unfortunately, the team could not
post back-to-back victories and fell
to the visiting Bears, 72-59. Although
they only trailed by 3 points at the
break, the Bears opened the second
half with a 20-4 run from which they
would not look back. Marandola'ol
again posted 22 points, and Leslie
Young 'OO tossed in 12 points for a
new career best. The Garnet, normally successful when they have high
scoring (+5B) nights, did not play
with their normal defensive intensity.
A trip to Muhlenberg illustrated the
same problem of defensive inconsistency for Swat. The Garnet put only

11 points on the scoreboard in the
first half, compared with the Mules'
38, and the second half was little
better. The squad connected on a
dismal 17% of their shots, 9 for 52
from the field. Quinn and English
each had 8 points in the outing, and
Marandola had 5.
The Mules and the Bears clinched
play-off berths this week as the representatives of the Eastern division.
With the best Conferencerecord (121), Johns Hopkins leads the West.
The final spot will go to either Western Maryland or Gettysburg.
.The team is striving to finish the
season with a big win over Haverford
on the final day of the season. The
game will be the last one for the lone
senior on the squad, Co-Captain
Michelle Walsh, who will be honored in pre-game festivities.

The men's basketball team had another
disappointing week, dropping two conference games as its record fell to 0-23
on the year. The last chance for Swat to
avoid a winless season comes tomorrow
night against archrival Haverford. Against
Dickinson last Saturday, Swarthmore
blew a three point lead with just over two
minutes remaining for a 60-57 loss. Tim
Schofield '99, who had a team high 24
points, made a basket with just 2:08 left
in the game to take a 57-54 lead. But
Swarthmore missed three shots and turned
the ball over twice in their final five possessions, and Dickinson capitalized on
free throws to seal the game. The rematch
of last year's conference championship
was close throughout as Schofield and
Cassidy Westbrook 'OO, who posted a
career high 17 points, scored 41 ofSwat's
57 points to keep the Tide in the game.
Sophomore Joe Culley, who earned a spot
on the Conference honor roll for his
double-double last week, added 8 points
and a team high 11 boards. Culley has
averaged over 10 rebounds a game since
getting his first start four games ago. Swat
had a one point lead with 1:11 left, but a
turnover finally gave the Red Devils the

ball. Dickinson took advantage and the
lead on the ensuing possession. A missed
three at the buzzer was off the mark and
Swat droppped its 23rd in a row.
Following the heartbreak of the
Dickinson game, Swat had trouble scoring against Muhlenberg Wednseday night.
Fortunately, in the first half, so did the
Mules. The score was knotted at 9 with
just nine minutes to go in the opening half
before Muhlenberg finally erupted on a 102 run to take the lead. With the halftime
score at 27-16, Swarthmore still had a
chance to stay in the game, but
Muhlenberg got hot and scored 14 of the
game's next 16 points for an overwhelming 41-18 advantage. Muhlenberg then
cruised to a 70-43 victory. Swarthmore
shot just 27% from the field as they could
not get open shots. The Tide also shot just
35% (7-20) from the free throw line.
Schofield led the squad with 14points, and
Jacob Jurado 'Ol finished with a career
high 6 points. The Garnet Tide will try to
